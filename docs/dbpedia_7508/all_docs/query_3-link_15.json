        "text": "By: Yahiya Emerick\n\nAllah has revealed many verses in the Qur’an which advise us to travel and see the world. (6:11) This, of course, is not a command to go on vacation constantly, rather, it is meant as a learning experience. Allah tells us to look at former civilizations, ruins of ancient days and upon how no people or generation is permanent. When we realize that others have passed away before us, we begin to understand that we, ourselves, will be less than a memory for generations to come after us. (6:6)\n\nIt has been a long time since I traveled. Too long, if what I learned is any indicator.\n\nMy wife and I arranged to take a trip from New York to Arizona. Yes, the lure of the Grand Canyon found its way into our collective imagination. One brother said to me before we left, “When you go to Mecca, you feel insignificant. When you go to the Grand Canyon you realize you are nothing.” Boy was he right.\n\nOur flight from JFK was delayed, of course. From our hard waiting room seats we watched the Saudi Airlines pilots and flight attendants flirting with each other in their nearby lounge quite blatantly. I wonder if they become more Islamic during Hajj season? Insha’llah I’ll find out one day.\n\nWhen we finally arrived in Phoenix, Arizona, we were amazed to see that everything was cast in hues of sandstone and clay: the buildings, the ground, the people and the roads. We were truly in another land. The drive north to the Grand Canyon was pleasant enough. (Our rental car had a great air conditioner.) It was amazing for me to see wide open countryside, baked to a crisp by the sun, with a small house here and there. How could anyone live in this hot place?\n\nWhen we arrived at the Grand Canyon and looked upon that great pit for the first time, both my wife and myself became nervous inside. I hardly expected that I would feel shaken, but until you look down over a sheer cliff taller than the world’s tallest building, you won’t understand how we felt. It is truly awe-inspiring. (Not to mention there are no guard rails anywhere so one mis-step and you’re history.)\n\nGiven that we were over 7,000 feet above sea level, our breathing became difficult and we ran out of breath easily. I often remembered from that point on the verse in the Qur’an where Allah mentions high altitude as related to the difficulty to breathe. In fact, I remembered so many ayat during this trip and gained a greater appreciation of their full import that I might as well have been in school.\n\nThe Grand Canyon is truly an amazing sight to behold. A little tiny river carved it out over the course of five million years. The tour guides give you a little paper when you first arrive that describes the age of each exposed layer of rock. The upper layers are only a few hundred thousand years old, while the lowest layers are about two billion years old! Talk about feeling like nothing!\n\nAs I gazed over the multi-colored layers, the remembrance of another Qur’anic verse came to mind. Allah tells us that just as our colors and races are different and we can learn from that, so too is the earth filled with many colored layers which are also a sign of His power. Allah is telling us His earth is very old and took many ages to form, even as humans have variations which only time has wrought. (35:27-28)\n\nThere are many peaks, plateaus, and geological formations in the canyon. They all have names too. You’d be surprised to know that most of them are named after Hindu gods and such. There is the Brahmin temple, the Shiva Temple, the Vishnu schist, the Buddhist temple, the Zoroaster temple, the Throne of Wotan (a Viking god) and about two dozen others. The non-Muslim American tour guides all said these names as if they were a part of their own heritage.\n\nI reflected on this for a moment. There was no “Muslim Temple” or “Muhammad Peak” or anything connected to Islam. All the names were given about a hundred or so years ago by various explorers and educated men. Did they not know about Islam? Now before you start saying they were enemies of Islam or hated Muslims, consider this: even in our modern world, the average person, nay, even the highly educated person, gives no thought to Islam whatsoever.\n\nIn other words, if some professor was going to write a book on global trends, he or she would probably not include any mention of Islam or Muslims whatsoever, other than to say trouble will come from the Middle East one day. The rest of his book will concentrate on Europe, America and East Asia. The people who want to keep Islam from popular society have done an excellent job of keeping Islam hidden behind curtains and many Muslims seem content to pray to Allah from the shadows. But that is another issue.\n\n(I just hope the political-oriented secular “Muslims” don’t start a crusade to have some peak in the Grand Canyon named “Crescent Temple” or some other nonsense.)\n\nIf you’ve ever seen one of those prehistoric dinosaur movies then you’ll know how we felt when we were at the bottom of the canyon. We took a raft ride down the Colorado river and truly felt we were in “The Land That Time Forgot.” (We didn’t take a mule ride down the trails because we thought it was cruelty to animals after we saw how miserable the mules appeared in the noon-time 118 degree heat. I wouldn’t want to have that mule accusing me on Judgment Day of having pleasure at its expense when there was no real need for me to ride it.)\n\nThe water was cold and blackish-green. Our raft pilot was a middle-aged woman who spoke continually of how insignificant the Canyon makes her feel. After an hour of listening to her narrate the tour, both my wife and I realized that this non-Muslim was asking for spiritual direction and felt very empty inside. It was as clear as day. We left the raft a few hours later wishing we had some way to talk to her and some mechanism of follow-up.\n\nA park ranger later led our group to view some rock carvings left by the Anasazi Indians about a thousand years before. To stand there and look upon what was once important to someone from long ago is quite humbling. The hands that made those stick figures and animal carvings are dead and crumbled to dust. What will become of us?\n\nThe next leg of our tour took us to the great Navajo Reservation. But first we passed through the Petrified Forest and saw trees that had turned to stone over the course of millions of years. Again, the lessons of our own insignificant existence came to mind. Then we arrived at Canyon de Chelly. A lush labyrinthine valley in the process of re-vegetation still inhabited by the Navajo to this day.\n\nA jeep tour took us to see cliff-dwellings and petroglyphs made over a thousand years before and long since abandoned. “In the traces left by (former peoples) you will learn wisdom” came to my mind. Every time I saw a new set of ruins I tried to imagine what it was like long ago: full of people and life. Real people in real homes. People just like you and me. But a few crumbling bricks are all that remain of those countless souls. What were their Prophets like?\n\nWe spent a lot of time on the Navajo Reservation. (We left da’wah literature in every hotel we stayed at.) I was quite surprised to see churches all over the place. Even in the most desolate of areas I would spot some church or another. There were Mormon churches, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Catholic, Assembly of God, Pentecostal, Baptist and a dozen others. I was quite speechless upon realizing that these people were worshipping the god of those who killed their ancestors en masse.\n\nWhite Catholics and Protestants, Spanish and American, came to this land and killed almost all of the tribal people they could find. The survivors were then herded onto desolate desert tracts and told to stay there where many others died. Government policies were enacted just a hundred years ago which forcibly removed children from their parents and banned the practice of their native religions.\n\nNow those same Apaches, Hopis and Navajos are going to church and singing “Praise Jesus” all the while white Americans snicker. The brief revival of old Indian ways on various reservations has done nothing more than feed the white New-Age movement by providing Indian souvenirs like Dream Catchers, flute music, artsy paintings and neat quotes from long dead Indian chiefs.\n\nSomething tugged inside my soul when I witnessed firsthand the contemporary legacy of a proud people. Many of the men whose faces mirrored the black and white photographs of their noble ancestors revealed the shadows of alcoholism. Most of the Native Americans on the Reservation appeared to have become so assimilated; trading their ancestral solidly grounded spirituality and cosmology for a diffused “do as you want to do” ethic of Western mass culture. I could tell there was a great cultural struggle going on in the society there. Half the Navajos dressed like cowboys (boots, cowboy hats, jeans and short hair) while the other half had traditional long hair and wore less identifiable Western dress.\n\nAll the Navajo and Hopi radio stations play country and Western music even though they have their own music. So complete was the assimilation process that it could be said that in some sections of the Reservation Navajo identity is nearly just a quaint New Age feeling rather than a firmly grounded spirituality. In the same way that someone might call themselves Jewish but then have less than ten percent Jewish heritage and ethnicity. (Blond hair and blue eyes does not a Hebrew make.) In fact, I learned that most of the Native Americans in the region have abandoned the Reservations and now live in the big cities doing mostly menial labor. Crazy Horse and Geronimo’s legacy had indeed been abandoned– with only a small percentage still fighting to hold on to the traditions of their ancestors.\n\nMy wife and I discussed how a da’wah program might be started for Native American people. The usual short-sighted efforts by our “Islamic workers” would doubly fail here. A group of dedicated brothers and sisters would have to actually come and live on the Reservation permanently, work there and become friends with the local people. (Yes, I know you wouldn’t get to be a rich doctor or engineer there, but you would have a good shot towards the highest places in Jannah, the real home.)\n\nA business venture would provide the perfect pretext for such an effort. Local people could be hired and shown how Islam blesses the relationship between boss and worker, a Masjid could be built near the business or in town. Free classes on Islam could be offered, a tight-family atmosphere could unite the Muslims and the new converts. Free housing could be provided to those who need it. Respect for native ways would be expressed in both deed and fact and the Muslims would show what true brotherhood and sisterhood is all about.\n\nFor that phase to succeed, however, you would have to face up to a very harsh truth. Most of our “Sheikhs,” “Maulanas,” “Scholars” and other self-appointed priests are arrogant, devoid of practical knowledge and filled with unIslamic cultural ideas. There I said it. Someone had to. But what do you expect? Such is the condition of “Islamic” education in the Muslim world today that this is what is produced in many cases. Not all cases, but many. (3:159)\n\nThink about it. If you take a five year old kid living in an unIslamic “Muslim” culture, put him in a prison of a school where he is commanded to memorize vast amounts of words that he can’t understand or he’ll get a beating, don’t you think the end product would be less than desirable from the standpoint of the needs of the Islamic movement?\n\nYou would need a caring, understanding, knowledgeable and dedicated person or persons to do da’wah among the Indians of Native America. Of course you need that for da’wah to anybody but especially with those who have been crushed completely by America so much so that they now identify with their oppressor. Author Paolo Friere elucidates this strange master-slave process in “The Pedagogy of the Oppressed”.\n\nThe more I learned of Native American practices and beliefs the more I saw how Islam would be easy to introduce here. Basic American Indian religious practices resemble Hinduism to a great degree. Complete with spirits, gods, mysticism and the like. If the Blessed Prophet Muhammad can eradicate idol-worship in a pagan society, then we can at least attempt the same with a people who have mixed tribal paganism with Christian paganism.\n\nWe have advantages as Muslims in this endeavor. Christian missionaries come in and say that all Native American beliefs and practices are from the Devil. Then they command that they must abandon their culture and become like Westerners to be saved.\n\nIslam, however, takes the basic attitude that there is some truth in the beliefs of others which came from authentic Prophets in the past. We don’t automatically condemn others but rather seek to understand their beliefs. (6:108) Then we can compare their teachings with Islam and gradually invite them to abandon what people made up in their past and to affirm what truth they have which Islam promotes. The “Great Spirit” is Allah, we would teach, and there is no need for other spirits or gods between us and the Great Spirit. This notion was first fostered during a discussion I had with a Navajo Muslim brother in New Mexico a few years back. This brother stated to me: “The reason I became a Muslim is because Islam takes the traditions and conceptualizations of my people to a purer level. I believe that my Navajo identity is complemented by my Islamic beliefs and practices.”\n\nChristianity is never fully practiced anywhere in the world because it is a man-made religion hand-crafted from pagan sources. It never has any impact on the lives of a people or community other than to give them a feel-good ideology they can recall on Sunday. Islam, however, gives a life program which is designed to transform the individual on a day-to-day basis.\n\nNavajo, Hopi and Apache traditional beliefs are filled with rituals that are performed every day. (22:67) Wouldn’t it be easier to offer Islam to a people who will then be encouraged to retain their unique cultural characteristics and at the same time joining the community of believers? All it requires is dedicated people. There are already a couple of Muslims from among the Navajos and others. Who will answer the call and set forth united to call these people to Allah’s way? (2:143)\n\nThere is a unique task for everyone in this life. A small or large part in a larger picture. Beyond our daily affairs of work and family, Islam calls upon us to act on a higher level for the common good of ourselves and all of humanity. There’s one thing I learned on this trip and it is that we must all listen to our hearts and answer this call. Only when we act out our faith in the world around us do we become truly happy–we become our faith rather than perform it externally.\n\nBy: Yahiya Emerick\n\nHave you ever been confronted with such stupidity that you were speechless? It happens all the time and in all spheres of life. The person driving ahead of you can’t make up their mind whether to turn left, right, stop, go or travel ahead. The teenager is wearing a full “uniform” of baggy pants, shaved head, ear-ring and gold chains and exclaims he’s being “unique.” Or my favorite example is that of a man at an auto auction who yelled out “three hundred” when the auctioneer just lowered the price to fifty. Stupidity is sometimes an art form and many people spend a lifetime perfecting it.\n\nUsually, the strange actions and behavior of others have little immediate impact on our lives. It often takes a long time for the stupid actions of some to build up to a point where the rest of us suffer. Take for instance the problem of the United Nations. Two-faced people will stand up and tell us that it’s the forum for the world and that it’s committed to world peace, conflict resolution, justice, etc… But after almost fifty years of bungling, this front for Western, secular domination has prolonged more wars than it solved.\n\nThe UN’s budget is riddled with corruption and inefficiency and UN headed military missions come with more feebleness, bad action and/or inaction than anything else. (Think Bosnia, Somalia, Korea, Rwanda, etc…) Twenty years ago it didn’t matter as the two superpowers kept the world on a tight leash. But now that one superpower is gone, the UN’s stupidity and confusion is unable to keep the last superpower in check, let alone tin-pot dictators. The prolonged weakness now makes the world more dangerous.\n\nWhat about Muslims? Are there any incredibly stupid actions which have built up to a dangerous level. Of course! Of the many to choose from, which one am I going to pick on today? Yep, you guessed it. I’m going to point out how some (not all) “scholars” have steered us wrong and taken us away from the path of Islam.\n\nYou often hear the terms, Shaykh, Scholar, ‘Alim, ‘Ulema, Maulana, Mullah, Allamah, Imam, etc… There are so many people with these titles in front of their names that it’s dizzying. You know how so many Muslims are into the whole “Doctor” thing? Seeking status by having everyone call them Doctor? Well, the whole scholar thing is there too and it’s much older than the Western oriented “Doctor” worship. (Sometimes you see people writing their names as “Dr. Shaykh whatever.” Now that’s funny.\n\nHere’s the problem I see. When I first became a Muslim, I read so many books that extolled the wondrous virtues of the Islamic system. That is the system that I love. And one of the things that was mentioned over and over was that there was no clergy in Islam. No “Holy” men or intermediaries between Allah and people. Then I was introduced into the whole culture of “Scholars.” That’s where my alarm bells started to ring.\n\nOf course, I have nothing against a person acquiring a lot of knowledge, whether it’s for Islamic learning or worldly benefit. I have nothing against the concept of the scholar, the doctor, the engineer, etc… I do have a problem if some people use those terms as a cover for their arrogance and mistakes and then it affects me in a negative way, either directly or indirectly.\n\nFor example, as you well know, there are many competing groups of Muslims today in the ideological wars. There are the Saudi-funded Salafees, the Iranian funded Mullahs, the Egyptian/Syrian Brotherhood groups, the Tablighi Jamaati people, the mysterious Hizb at Tahreer, the Jamati Islami groups, the African American Muslim groups, the secularist Indo-Pak groups and about twenty others. Each group has its own scholars who “prove” to the faithful that the other groups are inferior. These same “scholars” often issue “Fatwas” or religious verdicts about items of concern for individual members and life goes on in the happy dreamland of exclusive truth.\n\nThese groups often issue contradictory Fatwas and rarely ever work together on anything. How many of you have been to a gathering of one of these or other groups where the “big scholar” is treated like a celebrity? Well-wishers and sycophants fawning all over him. (It’s always a “Him.”) What’s the average, concerned Muslim supposed to think when the “scholars” are often so full of pride and arrogance that they are repulsive? The hierarchy involved in the “scholar” system in amazing! The big Maulanas are usually the fattest. The medium Maulanas have shorter beards and smaller bellies, while the Maulana wanna-bees are thin and stand off in the fringes of the great procession. (Don’t get angry at me for pointing out what everyone knows.)\n\nSo where does the stupidness come in? There are several areas to look at and the first is on the issue of who is a “Scholar” or “Shaykh?” Allah is very harsh against the Jews and the Christians for considering their priests and rabbis as people who could make religious judgments without consulting Allah’s revelations. The priests made the eating of pork allowed for Christians, with no authority from Allah or from Prophet Jesus, while the rabbis made laws such as a woman could not be in the house during her period and that milk and meat could not be eaten together. In this respect, the people “worshipped” their leaders besides Allah.\n\nSadly, this is exactly what Muslims have done for the last thousand years. In the early days of Islam, no one went around with ostentatious titles, as if they were somehow set apart from the rest of the people. Everyone was usually addressed as brother or sister. No one earned overly glorified titles, either, just because they studied with a Sahabi. The only real special term that I have ever come across which was frequently used by the Prophet to describe others is ‘Alim (learned person). And this term was never used in the sense of a “priest” or Holy man. It was just that: a person who is learned.\n\nIn Madina, everyone was “learned” to one extent or another. The trader knew how to practice Islam, the housewife knew how to practice Islam and the traveler knew it too. If someone needed to ask a question about Islam that they didn’t know, they would go to a friend or neighbor. For really detailed questions, they might consult someone who was known to be a teacher. But they wouldn’t fawn all over the teacher nor would the teacher dress or act in such a way as to set him or herself apart from the rest of the believers.\n\nCenturies passed and a funny thing happened. The Islamic world spread in so many different directions and millions of people were becoming Muslims. The common knowledge of Islam was not so common anymore. If a Muslim teacher went to any area where Islamic knowledge was scarce, suddenly, everyone was wanting to be around him. The teacher became special. (Think of Sufi-style Shaykh worship for example.) Fast forward many more centuries. There are millions of Muslims, but few know much about Islam. Teachers have become “holy” men and have such titles as “Shaykh” or “Maulana”. They are a special class, or caste, of people who are sought after and revered by people who want to see their “god” in the flesh because the concept of an unseen Creator is to intellectual for most. (Hence, Muslim “Saints!”)\n\nSo what of the world today? Any person who learns a few dozen ahadith and one or two ajza is calling himself a scholar and making pronouncements about Islam to his flock who knows little. I have met people who knew little about Islam calling themselves Imam, or Shaykh or whatever. Who made them Imam? Who promoted them to the role of a guardian of the Deen? Was it their ignorant followers? Was it by virtue of the fact that they attended some madrasa in another culture? Is it because they’re rich? Who knows? All I know is that a real scholar doesn’t call himself by a title. He doesn’t need it. A real knower of Islam realizes he knows so little and is humble. A title makes him feel uncomfortable. That is a real Muslim leader. But what we have mostly is a clergy class. (Think of that hadith about the Day of Judgment where the pretentious scholar is thrown in Hell.)\n\nAnd what do the self-appointed scholars say? The stupidity is amazing! (These are all actual Fatwas:) One scholar will say that chewing gum does not break the fast. Another says that using a fork is haram. A third says that eating McDonald’s meat is okay while a fourth says of it, no way. One scholar says human cloning is halal, while another says it’s haram. One local scholar in New York says the Sunnah is not important and that most ahadith are fabricated. One in Egypt says that wife-beating is okay if the wife doesn’t make an effort to look pretty while another says that mortgages are allowed under duress. (Have you ever heard the Fatwa that living in America is haram? It’s there.) Each one of these scholars backs up their arguments with Qur’an and hadith, in a usually twisted way, and then says anyone who does otherwise is a kafir.\n\nThe Muslim masses, especially in the West, become very confused. The Blessed Prophet advised us to ask the learned people if a tough question comes up, but we have incredibly un-learned people leading us. I’m sure you are all aware of that hadith where the Prophet said that he doesn’t punish a nation until the learned are no more. I’m sure you’ll agree that having a lot of “scholars” doesn’t preclude learning being gone.\n\nThe biggest confusion among the scholars that I’ve seen is the issue of Bida’, or innovation in the Deen. The blessed Prophet once remarked that if anyone brings something new into Islam that it would be rejected. On another occasion, he said, referring to Islam, that every innovation was a wrong and that every wrong will be in the fire. So what have some of our self-proclaimed scholars gone and done? They have included ordinary, everyday things in this definition of Bida’. Even though the Prophet was talking about people changing the beliefs and practices of Islam, our “scholars,” in their infinite wisdom, have said that any new invention after the time of the Prophet is also an “innovation” in Islam.\n\nI’m sorry, I have no clue how a new type of saddle, weapon, hairbrush, toothpick or shovel can possibly be called an innovation in the Deen. They have no relation to the Deen. Everyday items for common use are just that, ordinary aspects of life. Of course, these “scholars” apply this rule selectively. They will take a plane when they go to Hajj, instead of riding a horse. They’ll use a microphone instead of shouting and they’ll print their ideas in books. (Remember, the Blessed Prophet did not use any printed books in his da’wah.) Oh my gosh! Bida’! (Look at page 691 of Reliance of the Traveler and you will read a hadith where the Prophet encourages good innovations. I guess the scholars didn’t read that hadith from Sahih Muslim.)\n\nIf you think I’m exaggerating, then ponder over the things I’ve written. Have you seen anything like it? Have you seen pride on the faces of those who claim to be scholars? Which brings me to my last point. Many scholars make Islam seem totally distant and unreachable. How many times have I been sitting in a Masjid or lecture hall and saw some scholar expounding on Islam in an overly-technical way? Why do you think that teenagers and twenty-something Muslims run away from the Masjid? The scholars use too much Arabic terminology and don’t explain things in a digestible way. If it’s Sunnah to speak to people according to their level, why do our self-appointed leaders speak as if they’re addressing a gathering of scholars all the time?\n\nDon’t get mad at me. Don’t write angry letters about me. I’m telling you the truth. Listen, I understand the Arabic terminology. I understand even the most difficult concepts. Perhaps you do also. But the average Muslim has no clue what Taddabur is or what derivative verbs are or what Tassawaf is or what Usuli Fiqh is. We have ninety percent of our “next generation” one step away from kufr and these “scholars” give lectures that few of the youth, teenagers, converts or average Muslims can understand.\n\nOf course, the older, immigrant Muslims may understand some of the speech or du’as because they grew up in a Muslim country and heard of some of the concepts. But Islamic knowledge is cut off in the generation raised in the West. Don’t the “scholars” of Islam realize this? They are acting like they are teaching in Medina when in fact they are in pre-Islamic Mecca. (Do you know how many da’wah workers mess up their da’wah by using excessive Arabic grammar and concepts that American people don’t understand?)\n\nI’ve often lamented that in our Masajid and centers, in many cases, the Imams and “Scholars” have no clue about the needs of their community. They often can’t counsel, teach effectively or even show compassion and understanding. I’m just glad that there are a few good scholars around. I just wish there were more, that they could be in the majority. Then we wouldn’t have the confusion and stupidity on such a high level making it difficult for all of us. I know of one Masjid where the Imam carries a gun and has pulled it on Muslims in the Masjid! (How did he get to be an Imam?)\n\nHave you ever heard of a Doctor of Divinity? It’s a special degree that Christians usually get before they can become priests or ministers. The candidate must not only study the beliefs and teachings of his or her religion, they must also study: marriage counseling, youth psychology, administration, public speaking, philosophy, comparative religion, management, writing, literature, etc… Why doesn’t the board of directors of Masjid X, Y or Z require this from their Imams and resident “scholars”? In many communities I’ve been in, the Imam, who is almost always a hafiz, is the least respected because all he knows is the Qur’an, he usually has no practical knowledge of anything else whatsoever. The Islamic movement needs real, well-rounded and versatile leaders. We need humble people who don’t hide behind titles and enter exclusive “scholar’s” clubs.\n\nI don’t want anyone to think I’m speaking out against the concept of scholars. I’m not. I repeat, I’m not. I’m speaking out against the laziness in the Ummah which has let our standards for what a scholar should be drop so low that anyone, regardless of intelligence can claim to be a scholar, and then have people follow him. (Do you know how many “Imams” I’ve seen carrying sticks to beat their students of Qur’an?) I’m also speaking out against those who have acquired such a high level of knowledge but then don’t know how to relate it to the people. (Do you know how many big scholars I’ve seen drunk on their own knowledge while the people around them are lost?)\n\nSome brothers from Saudi Arabia once told me an interesting thing. They said that in their country, everyone tries to get their children on the doctor track in the schools. If the child isn’t smart enough to do that, then they try to direct them to the engineer track. But if they fail in that also, then they send them to the religious schools to be an Imam, and that is the lowest level of respect in society. May Allah help us to reclaim the middle ground and bring the knowledge of the real scholars to the masses who are in desperate need of it. Ameen.\n\nBy: Yahiya Emerick\n\nThe Qur’an and example of the Blessed Prophet Muhammad, or Sunnah, are the two main sources from which the entire framework of Islamic theology are derived. But they unfortunately are not the only sources which Muslims have consulted to formulate their philosophy and teachings through the centuries.\n\nThese other “sources” include what was customary among the Arabs of early Arabia, what is customary among Muslims today, as well as the writings of theologians and philosophers throughout the centuries which may or may not be based on authentic Islamic texts.\n\nThe danger in relying on these peripheral sources is that they may, in time, be accepted as authentic, even ranking as high as the Qur’an and the Sunnah! This is the evil Bid’a, or innovation, that the Prophet spoke out against but which Muslims have embraced with abandon. What are some examples of this to help us understand the dangers?\n\nThe ancient Arabs used to organize themselves into tribes which considered non-members inferior in status. Although this system was broken by the egalitarian nature of Islam in the first century of the Muslim era, modern Muslims have brought it back with a vengeance in their allegiance to Indo-Pak, Arab, Turkish, African or whatever nationalism they can manufacture (or on the basis of European-imposed divisions on the Muslim world).\n\nYou all have experienced it. If you are from a different ethnic group than the majority of the people at any particular Masjid or community function, you may feel a bit lonely or disassociated from the majority who don’t seem to make much space for you in their tiny “world.” This is due to a lack of Islamic brotherhood in the hearts of the people and a love for “Asabiyya” of nationalism. But even big Maulanas with beards and huge Sheikhs with thobes often promote these differences in their actions and public statements. A new reality in the world of Islam was imposed upon us with our own complicity!\n\nAs for trends in the Muslim world today, you will find many extremist-oriented Muslim groups (no, not “terrorists”,) whose view of Islam is based solely on the word “anti-.” They are anti- everything and anything. They are against America, they are against the West, they are against their national governments, they are against the local culture, they are against women’s emancipation, they are against “the Jews,” they are against writing for literature’s sake, they are against TV, against madh-habs, against differences of opinion, against women driving or working, against women in the Masjid, against, against, against…\n\nIt’s hard to understand what they’re for because they are often the same people, thobes and kufis notwithstanding, who cheat on their taxes, lie on their passports, marry Western women for their green cards, break any and every law at a whim, shout like donkeys in their emotional fervor and deny women their Allah-given rights. As one brother told me, “The anti-everything Muslims make the worst neighbors because they don’t care about you and don’t respect any laws.”\n\nSadly, this reckless, cavalier, “Wild-West” attitude has infiltrated the thinking of many Muslims so much so that the President of Iran has to publicly declare that people must live “by the rule of law.” You can’t just take the law in your own hands as a street mob or disobey a decision just because you don’t like it.\n\nYou wouldn’t believe how many times I’ve seen these “vigilante” type Muslims, of all races, here in America, publicly causing fitnah over nothing, just because they want to be seen as “standing up for their principles.” Well, if early Muslims felt that way, they wouldn’t have obeyed Abu Bakr and fought against the rebels in the Wars of the Ridda. At that time, many Sahaba opposed Abu Bakr’s handling of the crisis, but when the order came, they all marched and saved Islam for future generations. And we’re not even talking about things as dire as that! We’re talking about who should be chairman of the board, walls hiding women in the back, men being allowed to abuse their wives at will, is McDonald’s meat halal, teens wearing baseball caps, etc…\n\nIslam is not a religion of revolution. It is not. Everyone says it is, even big Maulanas, but they’re grossly mistaken. Islam is a religion of establishment. No, not a religion of agreeing with established wrong-doers. It is a religion which seeks to establish itself in place of every man-made system and once it is established, it is a religion of law and order. There are no vigilantes allowed in Islam. We have a definite political structure, a hierarchy of command and an exhortation to obey Allah, the Prophet and those in authority over us who abide by the first two. And it is not for us to oppose a leader simply because we don’t agree with him. There has to be a clear violation of an authentic Shari’ah injunction. Even then we don’t just go and assassinate the leader. We remove him through whatever legal means have been established for that purpose. Take that and think on it for a while.\n\nWhat about the thinking of Muslim scholars through the ages that has become accepted among Muslims, even though it may be faulty? Take these rapid fire examples as food for thought: If an ancient scholars basically copy from the Bible and say that those are the missing links in the stories of the Prophets, see how many Muslims fall down on their knees prostrate and worship them. (In fact, it was common for Muslim theologians in the Middle Ages to consult the Talmud, Torah and Bible for info on the Prophets that they didn’t find in the Qur’an. But Allah told us the Christians and Jews made up their books!)\n\nIf a contemporary scholar, whom I will not name, says Riba is Halal, see how many other Muslims follow him blindly. If Sufi mystics kiss hands, pray to other dead mystics and write about wine all the time, see how influential they become! And if the fifth Khalifa, named Muawiya, starts living in palaces, all Khalifas after him live in palaces- even down to our own times where “princes” and “Presidents for life” do so as well. (Saddam Hussein has 70 or 80 palaces!) And what about the Muslims who issue Fatwas saying McDonald’s meat is halal!\n\nNow, as for the cultural level, if the Muslims in one area have a tradition of wearing charms around their necks to ward of evil spirits, no one disputes it. If others view Islam as only being concerned with laws and punishments, like the Salafees do, then no one argues. “Viva the Taliban!” they cry.\n\nIf some believe that Islam requires female circumcision or marrying more than one wife, then who is there to disagree? If one big conservative scholar, who I will not name, says that the Blessed Prophet was wrong for letting prisoners live after the Battle of Badr, saying he should have executed them all, we all jump up and agree with him. Allah forbid our own ignorance!\n\nThese, and many other things, are the built up distortions and mistakes that have encircled themselves around the neck of real Islam. If you forget about the Qur’an and Sunnah and rely on people’s opinions, blind following and superstition, then what you will get is the modern mess we call the “Islamic” world.\n\nWhen I came to Islam almost ten years ago, I read only the Qur’an- from cover to cover. In it I found no superstition, no unjustifiable harshness, no idiocy or contradiction. I discovered it to be the most rational book I ever read. I accepted Islam after reading only that one book.\n\nThen I came into contact with the Hadith, or sayings of the Blessed Prophet. I read many different Hadith books and again I found nothing wrong. The picture of the Prophet that I developed in my mind’s eye was one of a compassionate seeker of truth who stood up against wrong and knew how the better man should behave. I was so happy with myself as a new Muslim.\n\nThen I began to read another type of book: the books that talked about Islamic philosophy, beliefs and ideology. What was different about these from the Qur’an and Sunnah? There was more input from the author and his or her opinions than from the two primary sources of Islam. Think about it: The Qur’an and Hadith are there and unchanged from antiquity, but you can pick up a book written by a Shi’a, a Sunni, a Za’idi, a modernist, a Salafi, a Tablighi or a Sufi and get an entirely different view of Islam- one that would make you think you were reading about different religions!\n\nIt was after years of seeing these battling currents of opinion among Muslims that I decided to reject every type of Muslim sect and rely only on the Qur’an and Sunnah and what the Madhahib all agree on. No exclusive Madh-hab worship, no Tariqas, no Sheikhs, no points of view, no opinions, no “Masters,” no cultural understandings and no ideological groups. I decided to become the most dangerous kind of Muslim there is: a simple one who seeks to follow Islam and who tries to associate only with sincere people, shunning obvious hypocrites and worldly wealth seekers.\n\nI rather like to take as my model, after the Blessed Prophet, Abu Darda and Abu Dharr, both of whom led simple, pious lives away from the disunity and turmoil of society. Not that I’m a hermit or anything. I believe in the Islamic cause and give lectures and Khutbas, teach Muslim youth and write books. I just don’t see any use anymore for sitting with groups of emotionally-oriented people who are easy victims of sloganeering, manipulation and ignorance.\n\nIn the interest of trying to clear away some of the cultural and unscholarly garbage that has festered in our minds, I would like to present a few theological issues for you to consider that may need some rethinking to bring them more in accordance with Islamically acceptable teachings. I am not offering the solution to each problem, nor am I issuing Fatwas or anything of the sort.\n\nI am merely asking you to read each issue and think about the points that are raised. If they can be cleared up, please, write an e-mail to the editor and share your solutions to the Ummah, because I’m sure I’m not the only person who has thought about these and other things. So let’s begin with the first issue to be liberated.\n\nIt is commonly accepted among Muslims that a women should not hold the position of leader of a state. This evidence is based on a Hadith of the Blessed Prophet, who had been recently informed that a woman was made the ruler in the neighboring country of Persia. He reportedly said that “A people who make a woman their ruler will not prosper.”\n\nI know many people take issue with this Hadith and I know that there are two groups of opinion. One group says this proves that Islam forbids women to be the head of anything. The Hadith, of course, doesn’t say that, but the supporters of the first position say that the idea is implied.\n\nThe people on the other side of the debate state that the Prophet was commenting on a specific case, that of a nation of disbelievers whose men were so rotten that they had to resort to a woman to rule them. Whatever the answer is to this question, however, and both sides will advance a load of arguments, the fact remains that it is a vague Hadith which mentions only top political leadership.\n\nNow the issue I want to bring to consideration is this: in light of this specific Hadith, many from among the first group say that a woman is even barred from being the head of an organization, an office holder in any capacity, a member or head of a Masjid Board or even a director of a charitable project! The other side takes an equally extreme position also: seeking women (who usually don’t wear Hijab) as their leaders in all respects simply on the basis of their being female.\n\nOftentimes the more conservative-run Masjids don’t have adequate provision for women even to offer their Salah, arguing that women are banned in the Masjid. (I have read their literature that says so. Even the premier “Salafi” translation of the Qur’an, “The Noble Qur’an” by Hilali and Khan states this very thing. See footnote 2A to ayah 2:3.) This, even though the Blessed Prophet said, “Do not prevent the female servants of Allah from going to the Masjid.”\n\nOn the other hand, it is sad to note that there are now “modern” Masjids where everything is so secular that the prominent women in charge of things almost never wear Hijab. Where can a balance be found? How can the desire for women to participate be joined with a social conservatism that is not oppressive or male-oriented exclusively? I think this is another job for the next generation and for new Muslims because the “ethnic” Muslims seem to be hopeless on this issue. What do you think?\n\nAnother issue for our consideration: this time a theological one. I’m a person who loves history. The greatest enigma for a history buff is pre-history. What were humans doing ten thousand years ago, fifty thousand years ago? Where was Adam and Hawwa and what events changed the course of history forever in those long lost days?\n\nThis type of interest raises a bunch of questions for me. First, the religious Jews and fundamentalist Christians are taught to be believe that the world is only 6,000 years old. For them dinosaurs may have existed for a few hundred years near the beginning of creation, but that was it. The world is 6,000 years old and that’s what they believe.\n\nObviously the world is millions, if not billions of years old. All the evidence is there for any half-wit to see. We Muslims are not constrained to any figure of years, as the Qur’an and Hadith are silent on this. The only ayat in the Qur’an that mentions anything about this is vague: “Didn’t a long time pass before humans were ever even thought of?” (76:1)\n\nNow most Muslim scholars reject any argument in favor of evolution, while at the same time not offering any other solution. Well, most Muslim “scholars” only know rote “religious” knowledge anyway, with no practical knowledge of science or anything else. Alas for the days when Muslim scholars were also scientists and searched for knowledge!\n\nThus, the majority of Muslims say nothing about this issue and silently follow along in secular science classes all over the world while their teachers teach unrestrained evolution. Not many Muslims have seriously exerted themselves to tackling this issue. The few I know of are Maurice Bucaille, Muhammad Hamidullah and Wahiduddin Khan and that’s about it. Any other writers I’ve seen dealing with this issue merely were attacking evolutionary theories using well-worn (and probably copied) Christian arguments.\n\nWhere does Islam stand on this issue? Where does it really stand putting aside all the ignorant “religious” scholars and sell-out “Muslim” secular scientists? That’s what I’d like to know and I’m sure you would, too. The two above-mentioned authors have formulated the most reasonable responses that I’ve seen yet.\n\nAnother related question that pops up is this: Where was Adam after he was made? Traditionally, Muslims have assumed that Adam was made in Heaven and when he sinned, Allah put him on Earth. But what is the basis on this belief? It would seem strange for Allah to tell the angels He was going to place in the world (Al ‘Ard) a Khalifa if He, in fact, created him in Heaven.\n\nThe Angels even objected at first saying that humans would kill and create disorder. Clearly those things are not possible in Paradise. If either the Angels or Allah thought Adam was going to be just another creature in the realm of Heaven then there would have been no further issue.\n\nEven further, Adam had a physical body while the Angels and Jinns had immaterial forms. (18:50) We all have to die before our essence can go into the next realm. So why this traditional view which seems a little odd?\n\nThe reason goes back to two simple words: Jannah and Ahbitu, both found in 2:35 and 2:36 respectively. The word Jannah means “garden.” Allah put Adam and his wife, Hawwa in a garden. The word for Heaven in Arabic is not Jannah, although it is sometimes synonymous. The word most accurately used for the next life is “Akhirah” or “Next (world)” The only time the word Jannah is used when talking about the next life is to emphasize that it will be like a beautiful garden, even better than what we have on earth. It must be pointed out that in Surah 18, Allah uses the word Jannah to refer to both a garden on Earth as well as one in Heaven. (See the story of the Owners of the Garden. (18:31-32) Jannah is a generic term for place of beautiful plant life.\n\nThe Blessed Prophet said in a Hadith that Adam was in Jannah, or a garden. The location of the garden is never, to the best of my knowledge, said to be in the Akhirah, or Next World. There is no ayah or Hadith, that I know of, that specifically says that Adam lived in Heaven (the Akhirah) with Allah. Anyway, how could the Shaytan be in Heaven to tempt Adam and Hawwa? He was not allowed there, based on the command of Allah, after he had refused to bow along with the angels. So how could he go into Heaven to tempt them later on. Another ayah in the Qur’an even states that flaming meteors are used to drive the Shayateen away from Heaven.\n\nNow it seems reasonable to assume that Adam was created in the ‘Ard, or Earth, as ayah 2:30 states. To strengthen this point, Allah says in the next ayah that He taught Adam the “names” of everything. All Muslims are in agreement that this means Adam learned about all the plants and animals. Again, that can’t be in the Akhirah as Allah created those things on earth, as so many other ayat prove. To further drive the point home, when Adam was commanded to tell the angels the names of all the plants and animals to show that he was superior, what plants and animals was he naming? Those things were on earth. Are there Zebras and Porcupines in the Akhirah?\n\nWhat about the next word, Ahbitu? That word means to get down or go down. Early Muslim scholars based their opinion, and the entire crux of their argument about Adam being made in a garden in Heaven (the Akhirah Heaven,) on this one word. They say that after Shaytan tricked Adam and Hawwa, that Allah kicked them out of Heaven and made them “go down” to Earth. I wonder if a spaceship was used or instantaneous molecular transport from the Akhirah to the surface of the earth!\n\nNow before going on, I must clarify that I am not insulting the understanding of the “scholars” and great minds of the past. Don’t you remember the Prophet (p) remarking that he hoped people who heard this message in later times would understand it better than those who heard it first? And don’t we always say the Qur’an is a book for all time? Don’t we say every generation will find something new in Islamic understanding?\n\nWe have to remember that Muslims in previous eras really believed that Heaven was up there in space somewhere. That it was up there in the midnight sky. Today we know that space is a vast empty domain filled with rocks, planets and stars. You can’t get to Heaven in a space ship, but, following the understanding of earlier Muslims, it would be theoretically possible. Remember, they couldn’t have known any better. So while they would be saying the Ghayb, or unseen world of Angels and Heaven, existed in a spiritual way, they would also think that Heaven was a real place with a geographical location up in the sky somewhere. Now we understand Heaven is completely in another plane of existence all together.\n\nNow, back to this word: Ahbitu. Anthropologists have discovered the earliest human bones in east Africa. Kenya, Ethiopia and other highland areas are virtual treasure-troves of ancient human bones. Now isn’t it just possible that Adam and Hawwa’s GARDEN was in the east African HIGHLANDS, which were steamy, tropical jungles tens of thousands of years ago? When Allah was telling them to “get down” from there, isn’t it entirely possible they had to GO DOWN from their mountain gardens into the harsh plains and valleys below, which led out into the wide world?\n\nAnthropologists have even charted the course of human migration out of east Africa and constantly remark how amazing it is that people seemed to explode out of the east of the continent and rush out to fill every corner of the world in less than 75,000 years. Now I’m not saying all these things are true or false. What I am saying is that it may be time to re-examine what our scholars have interpreted in the light of our increasing knowledge. Doesn’t Islam teach us to learn more all the time? I just want some food for thought to be served on our dormant tables again.\n\nTime to slay one more sacred cow. The family tree of Prophet Muhammad, may he be blessed, going back to Prophet Adam. Perhaps you’ve seen a poster of one or saw a listing of the alleged ancestors of the Prophet going back to Adam. What I want to know is this: how accurate is it? Are Muslims required to believe in it? Is there any ayah in the Qur’an that lists the Prophet’s ancestors, one by one? Is there any Hadith where the Prophet, himself, recited every name in his family tree back to Adam? I have never seen anything of the sort.\n\nThe question I want to pose is this: most of the names on those “family trees” are taken from Jewish writings, at least from Prophet Ibrahim on back to Adam. It is based on the assumption that the world is 6,000 years old only. Most of the names going from Kedar on down to Hashim, a prominent ancestor of the Qur’aish, are taken from Arab traditions, which were, by the way, the oral tradition of Bedouins for quite a while.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad never approved of such a list and there is no record that I have ever seen of him hearing the names of his ancestors back to Adam being recited and him approving of that list. So by accepting it, simply “because our ancestors” believed it, aren’t we letting ourselves be held hostage by a world view that is based on faulty, unIslamic assumptions.\n\nTo be sure, Islam is not against having a family tree; the Qur’an and Hadith extol the virtue of lineage. And we do know, based on ahadith, that the Prophet is descended from Ibrahim, but isn’t Islam against ignorance based on mere traditions that have no basis in authenticity? Of course it is. Am I going to trust the names collected by Jewish historians three thousand years ago, considering that those names are recorded in a book, the Bible, that Islam teaches is the work of corrupt men? Am I going to accept blindly an unapproved and untested oral tradition that someone happened to say was the family tree of the Prophet? Even the Prophet, peace be upon him, never verbally approved of such a list going back to Adam or authenticated one, to the best of my knowledge.\n\nWhat am I saying? There are some incredibly naive Muslims who believe in customs and traditions simply because those things come down to us from “old times.” If Allah chastises the Jews and pagan Arabs for following ignorantly the ways of their forefathers, are we so arrogant to believe that we would never do the same? We must re-examine ourselves and return to the authentic Qur’an and Sunnah. We must leave aside the honest, but inadequate reasoning’s of those who lived before as new discoveries and knowledge came to light about specific issues.\n\nIf I haven’t ruffled enough feathers, let me bring up one more thing that will insure my name will be off the invited speakers lists of conventions for years more to come. How many of you have heard of John Esposito or Yvonne Haddad? Those are two Christian academics who specialize in the study of Islam and Muslims.\n\nBoth of them have written numerous books on their area of expertise and Muslims often praise them for their “balance” and “fairness” in their treatment of Islam. It has gotten to the point where they have become celebrities in the Muslim world, both here in the West and elsewhere.\n\nThey are now commonly invited to speak at most Muslim conventions and many local events so much so that all you see sometimes are there names, in big, bold letters. One Muslim organization, which claims to be the umbrella organization of all Muslims in North America, has even gone so far as to place John Esposito on its Board of Advisors. Other smaller Muslim organizations have followed suit.\n\nNot belittling the “fairness” or “objectivity” of the many Christian scholars who have made Islam their specialty, I just have one small issue in my mind. Esposito and Haddad and others like them are so well-versed in Islamic teachings and beliefs that they would put most Muslims to shame. They know Islam inside and out. So why haven’t they accepted it? They know all the beliefs, practices and strengths of Islam as well as the ideological superiority of Islam over Christianity, but still they don’t surrender their wills to Allah.\n\nForget about the argument of letting everyone accept it in their own good time, these two are experts in Islam and according to the Hadith of the Blessed Prophet, “Any Jew or Christian who hears about Islam and doesn’t accept it will go to Hell-fire.”\n\nAre we placing people on pedestals whom Allah has promised Hell-fire to!!! What is the world coming to?\n\nBy: Yahiya Emerick\n\nThe conversion experience is one of the most unique feelings that any person can have. When a person’s heart and mind have opened up to something that they never knew was possible, the exhilaration, the passion can be tremendous. If you ask someone who recently underwent some type of religious conversion, the responses will range anywhere from elated to having come into true reality.\n\nMany people base the truth of their beliefs on how intense their experience was in accepting them. Many Christians undergo extremely emotional conversions which are often accompanied by singing, dancing, clapping, crying and such. Buddhists report a quiet sense of “calmness” entering their soul as they give up all love and desire for anything and everything in the world, while people who convert to Judaism (the few) often speak about how they are impressed with the rituals, tradition and history associated with their new-found faith. The experiences here range from the emotional to the vague ethereal.\n\nI haven’t been privy to very much data on the experiences of people who convert to Hinduism, other than seeing white American college students with bald heads, yellow and red robes and incense, beating drums and singing about Krishna on campuses and in airports. Invariably, most of them don’t remain Hindus and eventually give it up and enter corporate America.\n\nBut what about the experience of converting to Islam? Does it have any defining characteristic which one can use as a generalization? It would be wrong to automatically assume that the experience I had in converting would necessarily be the general rule, so one must look for empirical data and common threads in the experiences of many converts to try and identify a singularly focused trend.\n\nThis task is not very difficult as we have the records of converts to Islam which span almost 1500 years. The experiences of the first converts, the Sahaba, were recorded with startling detail and such “records” continue to be compiled even into our own time with new anthologies of convert experiences being published all the time. (I’m consciously avoiding the use of the term revert here because most people are not as familiar with the import of this term, although I recognize it is better to use than the word convert.)\n\nConversion to Islam, as any cursory glance at the lives of the Sahaba will show, was almost never emotionally based. It could be said that part of the reason why Islam was so attacked in its early days by the dominant powers in Arabian society at that time is precisely because of the fact that Islam was not based on superstition, emotionalism, or any factor that the common unprincipled person would be attracted to.\n\nThink about it. The Arab idol-worshippers were confirmed drunks, heathens, cheats and especially uncouth and uncivilized, even by the standards of the day. The law of the jungle prevailed in Arabia, as it did in many other places, and the only control over a man was his tribal leaders and perhaps the limits of his own individual conscience.\n\nIslam didn’t come offering a party-like atmosphere and an absolution of any guilt or personal responsibility. Nor did it offer a new man-god or other idol-like fetish that simple barbarians could understand and latch on to.\n\nInstead, Islam offered an abstract-seeming God, a detailed set of rituals and teachings and a lifestyle which forbade most of the vices that were prevalent (and popular) in society. To the average wine-swilling Arab, it probably sounded pretty dull.\n\nWhen we read about such primary personalities as Abu Bakr, Khadija and Ali, we find that their conversion was influenced as much by their absolute trust in the integrity of Muhammad as it was of the strength of his message. He never lied to them and was never false. If he said something was true, those who knew him best could believe it. They accepted it willingly and calmly with full conviction.\n\nA second, wider circle of individuals such as Rumaiysa, Abu Dharr and Abu Hurairah, were more discerning individuals who wanted to find out what this man named Muhammad was teaching. They listened to the Prophet and made an intellectual decision that what they were hearing made sense. They compared the beliefs and traditions of their society, which were brazenly unjust and demeaning, to what they were now hearing, and they accepted Islam as the only alternative that could be believed rationally, even though their conversion might get them into trouble. But so deep was their conviction that they often were subjected to torture, harassment and even death for their beliefs. This second group describes nearly all the first converts in the Meccan and early Medinan period. Conversion to Islam was based on an intellectual choice, requiring one to compare the merits of Islam with whatever else was current in society.\n\nA third group of converts could be termed the tentative people. These are the people whose conversion to Islam was based on factors such as the apparent success of Islam, following the crowd, not wanting to be left out, etc… Such converts, whose hearts were fickle, often made it difficult for the true Muslims to move forward. They represent a large number of converts in the later Medinan period and further on. (There are many verses in the Qur’an which address these types. Hypocrisy was rife among them.)\n\nWhen you read the stories and autobiographies of the first two types of converts, one can’t help but notice the common thread running through the accounts of these people who chose Islam when it was unpopular to be a Muslim. They were people who knew what society was about and then learned Islamic teachings and compared. People in Arabia knew something about idol-worship, Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism and gnosticism; but few if any ever converted to those things.\n\nBut when Islam came, it had a fire to it, a compelling call that drew people’s attention. It couldn’t be ignored in the mosaic of religions which was Arabia. The intelligent and discerning studied it and accepted it after much thought and reasoning. The corrupt and arrogant drew anger from their souls and inflicted the most horrible torture in their fight against Islam.\n\nIf you fast forward to our own present era, we live in a world that in many ways resembles pre-Islamic Arabia. The idol-worship of choice today is basically atheism colored with a belief in personal invincibility. The worst behavior is committed by most people on a daily basis. Even in America, “the land of prosperity and goodness,” poll after poll shows that the average person thinks lying is okay. Wife beating and child abuse are just as high here, if not higher, than anywhere else in the world and all the worst vices from alcohol, pornography and smoking to drugs are readily available on every street corner.\n\nThe uneducated masses in third world nations see flashy American movies and think that it’s the reality in America, and so, to be like their idols, they throw away any and every traditional value that has held their societies together and embrace every immorality (and it’s often rewarded with wealth and abundance! Ah, the reward of Shaytan!)) Bribery, lying and cheating become institutionalized in the governments themselves. This is done on such a scale that two Muslim countries top the list for the most corrupt nations to do business in on earth.\n\nThis modern religious atheism comes along with all its own idolatrous rituals and accessories. For contact with the supernatural, there are Tarot card and palm readers (big business), phone lines with psychic advisors (who charge a very spiritual fee), crystals, Zen rock gardens (for $39.95 you can achieve inner peace), Ouija boards, health clubs (where the scantily clad can worship each other’s bodies) and artsy-secular, new age “interpretations” of Christianity or “spirituality” (such as Oprah’s kind of Christianity.)\n\n(Oprah was once confronted on a show by a Christian activist who challenged her liberal stand on pre-marital and homosexual sex- pointing out that they were outlawed in the Bible. Oprah merely responded, to the great applause of the audience, that the “god” she worshipped was a loving god who didn’t judge people. Talk about following your own lusts and whims!)\n\nSo this is the modern, heathen world. There is a mosaic of religions everywhere and a prevailing style of atheist-centered “idol-worship.” Christianity is relegated to the quaint cultural level of a minor factor in Christmas and Easter. It has no impact in people’s daily lives, or in the world, other than to convert uneducated third worlders with offers of bread and Bibles. (Oh, the growth in gay-churches is tremendous.)\n\nJudaism is hardly followed, even in Israel. Buddhism is so compromised that someone as promiscuous and immoral as Richard Gere is being declared a “non-celibate” monk by no less than the Dalai Lama, who is as fruity as they come. Hinduism, well, what can you say there? It’s pure Neanderthal in the spiritual evolution of humanity.\n\nWhat is happening with Islam and why are so many diverse people accepting it? And this, even though Islam is the most vilified ideology/religion in the world. Interestingly enough, the same factors which influenced the first two categories of converts from the Prophet’s time are still in operation today.\n\nIt must be pointed out that in the history of Muslim civilization, from about 650 to 1600, the issue about whether to be a Muslim or not wasn’t there. The Islamic world considered itself superior to all other civilizations and there were no rivals. If you were a non-Muslim in the Muslim empire, you would be constantly impressed with the power and glory of it and Islamic teachings were readily available, as well as a practical model for organizing community life.\n\nWith the decline of the Muslim world and the ascension of the secular West, the barbaric inclinations of human baseness rose to the surface. After all, to be accurate, Christians have been responsible for the cold blooded murder of more innocents than anyone else in history. The story of Islam is one of toleration and even modern Christians admit this, while the history of Christianity from Charlemagne until the Bosnian holocaust in 1992 has been written in repression and blood.\n\nAs much as the idol-worshippers opposed Islam in Mecca, we find that, in turn, the atheist Westerners and their followers in the third world oppose Islam today. Vilifying and slandering it at every turn. But two types of people are accepting Islam in the world today which, as was mentioned before, closely correspond to the two types which accepted it in Mecca.\n\nPeople who become acquainted with the life, teachings and example of the Blessed Prophet Muhammad find him to be like no other as far as personal strengths and characteristics are concerned. He was truly honest, generous, compassionate and convinced of the worth of his cause. He can be taken as a hero or role model for anyone. Writers such as Martin Lings and Thomas Cleary were so impressed by his model that they eventually accepted Islam.\n\nThe second type, which is much more numerous, are the vast millions in America, Europe and elsewhere who know what the beliefs and values of their society are. They’re no fools. And when they hear about Islam somehow, they give it a fair hearing, never expecting to accept it. After they compare the facts and cross-reference and study deeply, they, too, accept Islam. This is demonstrated in such people as Jeffrey Lang, Aminah Assilmi and Hamza Yusuf.\n\nThere is, in my research, no overly emotional outburst, no screaming, “Hallelujah” and fainting, no dancing and feeling giddiness in their head. Is it any wonder that most people who are “saved” in the churches revert to their former ways quickly, when the emotional outburst and feeling wears off. While those who accept Islam, even hard-core felons, tend more to stick with it.\n\nAt the same time, there wasn’t any hard to define “tranquility” or calmness which suddenly engulfed their soul in a fit of “realization.” Instead, what research shows, (and anybody can talk to a convert and get similar results,) is that the conversion experience feels remarkably similar to the feeling one gets when they are returning to their family after a long and hard journey. A sense of belonging and place which resides deep within the psyche. The rational approach put to rest any and all objections and the absence of emotionalism ensures that the person knew exactly what they were doing when their mind and heart were in the position to see clearly. Satisfaction, certainty and contentment are hallmark feelings which accompany the new convert.\n\nTo illustrate this further, in my own case, I underwent two emotional conversion experiences to Christianity when I was younger. The first was when I was about twelve. Church services are the ultimate theatrical production and they have the techniques of swaying a person mastered into a science. After an hour of beating us down with our guilt and sin, making us feel low and dirty, the preacher suddenly offers a way out. The church organ plays a well-rehearsed soft melody as the preacher reaches out to us from the pulpit and offers us absolution, forgiveness and the wonderful joy of having our “burden” lifted.\n\nLike the naive kid I was, I took the bait and walked to the front of the church so the pastor could pray for me and I accepted Jesus as “my personal Lord and Savior.” Three hours later I felt as if nothing had changed, and not just because Christianity makes few real demands on a person’s life. The second time came when I was in my first year at college. I was feeling disconnected and wanted spirituality in my life.\n\nI was easy prey for those Campus Crusade people and when my meeting with their preacher ended, I felt a huge rush inside, it felt so supernatural that I was convinced it was true. I broke away from them, however, after only a couple of weeks, when I saw them playing rock music and singing like idiots in their evening services. My heart and mind knew that that wasn’t what obedience to God was about.\n\nWhen I came across Islam, it was through a friend who I knew all my life. He gave me a Qur’an and I took it back to college with me during my second year. I had already read so much of the Bible in my previous years that I was quite well versed in its contents.\n\nTo my utter amazement, the Qur’an challenged my perceptions from the first day. Before I started reading it I thought it was going to be just another “spiritual” book of sayings or fables like those Zen or Taoist new age kind of books. Boy, was I in for something different.\n\nI literally felt that God was talking to me from the first page I read. You don’t get that feeling reading the Bible or any other books. This book told the story of my life and asked me to compare what I knew to what it offered. Within just a few days I knew who was the winner. It was me. I found something that I could accept and know to be true.\n\nI still didn’t accept Islam yet, though, because I didn’t know how. I was learning. I raided the campus library for books on Islam and read books both pro and anti Islam. I found that the books written against Islam were based on hearsay, opinion and some very strange conclusions. (One book said that Khadija was an agent of the Pope sent to deceive Muhammad. Who could believe such idiocy?)\n\nAnyway, after several months, I came into contact with some Muslims from the Gulf states and was invited to dinner at one man’s home. He started telling me that if I was “going to be” a Muslim that this and that would be a part of my life. I remember answering him back with, “But I’m already a Muslim!” It crept upon me without my even realizing it. The message of the Qur’an bonded so completely with my world-view, attitude and heart that it and I were one.\n\nRead the account of Muhammad Asad contained in “The Road to Mecca” or that of Jeffrey Lang in “Struggling to Surrender” or even further in Maryam Jameelah’s “How I Came to Islam” and you’ll see a similar conversion experience at work. Islam reaches the heart through the mind so imperceptibly that before a person knows it, they already feel as if they are Muslim, i.e. surrendered to Allah. That’s the kind of conversion that has lasting power. That’s the kind of life change that is motivated by the informed man or woman; not one orchestrated by some outside influence playing upon a person’s emotions with church organs, drums, singing, dancing or whatever.\n\nThe next time you’re talking to someone or meeting someone who converted to something, ask them how it felt, and you’ll get a good idea of how long their conversion will last and how much of an impact it will have on their life.\n\nBY: Shaykh Abdullah bin Bayyah\n\nShaykh Abdullah bin Bayyah visited the Bay Area in the last week of July 1999. He offered a week long course on Usool al-Fiqh in Fremont, California. He then gave a talk on July 31, 1999 at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, California. An edited transcription of that talk appears below. As Shaykh Abdullah spoke, Shaykh Hamza Yusuf translated. At times, Shaykh Hamza added some of his own comments and explanations. These appear in brackets in the text.\n\nThe Shaykh’s Insights on the Muslims’ Condition and Responsibilities in America\n\n[Bismillah irahman iraheem. The shaykh began his talk by praising Allah subhaana wa ta’aala and sending prayers on the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam.] I wanted to speak tonight about your conditions, your circumstances here. You are a group that is small in number and yet strong in faith, a group that has diverse ideas and understandings and whose individuals come from many different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, a group that is few amongst a dominant group that is many. The dominant group is strong in many areas; in fact, they are controlling many areas of the world. I would like to speak tonight about what the priorities of such a group would be: What are the obligations of such a group? What are the responsibilities of such a group? I would like to present some ideas to you, and I hopes that Allah subhaana wa ta’aala helps me to present some ideas that relate to a methodology, to approaches, and to things that will be beneficial to this group if they implement them.\n\nI want to speak about the responsibilities that you carry here. In contrast to Muslims living in the dominant Muslim world at large, you are, in many ways, strangers in a strange land. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “Tuba lil guraba.” In other words, the conditions of the stranger are blessed conditions, and it also means, “lahum al-jannah: they have paradise” for bearing the burden of alienation. An Arab proverb is, “ya ghareeb kun adeeba: oh stranger in a strange land, be a man of courtesy and cultivation.” There is also a hadith, “Islam began alienated and will return as it began, alienated. So, blessed are the alienated ones.” This alienation should not mean that you distance yourselves from the rest of the people. That is not the meaning of this state of estrangement. It does not mean you should not work with others or that you should avoid the dominant society and distance yourselves completely from it even though your state is one of estrangement.\n\nSince we know that Islam has legal injunctions and that Muslims have a code of law, a question that occurs immediately to us in looking at these conditions here is whether or not there are rules in our deen that apply to one land and do not apply to another land. As we know, the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said that Allah subhaana wa ta’aala has made incumbent upon you to fulfill certain obligations, and Allah has also set boundaries for you, so do not transgress those boundaries. As we know, these rules in Islam relate to every Muslim. In terms of human beings, every one is equal in relation to these rules. You cannot say that one Muslim does not have to pray and another one does. All Muslims who are responsible adults have to pray. So, these rules of prayer and fasting, what are know as the arkan al-Islam-the pillars of Islam, the foundations of Islam-are things that are binding upon all Muslims, no matter where they are or what place they are in.\n\nIn addition, there is another type of set of rules in Islam that is known as al-ahkam as-sultania, and these are rules related to governmental authority, to the state. These rules involve certain things, such as the penal code of the Muslims. There is a code related to criminal law: if you do this, then this is the punishment. The implementation of those laws is related to the ahkam as-sultania or the rules related to the legitimate authority of the state. The ahkam as-sultania include the rules related to jihaad-in other words, martial activity in which men fight in war and battles. They also include the rules related to zakaah collecting: the gathering of wealth that Allah has obliged people to pay. In addition, they relate to the establishment of imams, not only the greatest imam, who would be the khalifa, but also the aaimma who will be in the masaajid and the qadaat who are the people who give the khutba on the jumu’a. All these types of things are traditionally related to the authority of the legitimate governing body of the Muslims. Muslims need judges; they need courts; they need police-all of these things relate to these ahkam. These types of rules which are known as the ahkam as-sultania are not the concern of those people who are living in a land in which there is not a legitimate state authority of Muslims.\n\nIf we want to look at an analogy, we will find it in the Makkan stage of the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam. If you look at the Makkan period, the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, was not making any claims to government authority. He was calling people to tauheed: the unity of Allah. He was calling people to prayer. He was calling people to the purification of their hearts. He was calling people to leave shirk. All this is known as the jihaad of the tongue: jihaad al-kalima; it is not the jihaad of the sword-or now the gun or the atom bomb or whatever. It was the jihaad of the tongue. Allah subhaana wa ta’aala said, “jaahidhum bihi jihaad al-kabir.” “Jaahidhum bihi” means to struggle against them with the Quran. In other words, “speak the Quran to them, and struggle against them with the truth in word;” and this was the jihaad of Makkah. You can say in a modern sense that this is speaking with a strong tongue in the face of wrong, in the face of injustices.\n\nWhen the Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, went to Medina, a different stage began, and there was now a jihaad of a physical type, a martial struggle where they went out. However, Allah subhaana wa ta’aala says to fight them until the war comes to an end. This type of jihaad has an end in time, and yet jihaad in its broader understanding in the sharia’ never ends. The struggle for the sake of Allah never ends as long as somebody is in this abode. This is why jihaad is the expenditure of one’s efforts for the sake of good. It means to do good things. It means to exert one’s effort in the society to help people, to expend one’s wealth-to give charity-to change the conditions around you: if they are bad, make them better. This can be done without martial effort in many places, and this is still a type of jihaad. This is why it is wrong for people to narrow the understanding of jihaad to some limited definition which only gives the understanding of military struggle because that is not what jihaad means in Islam.\n\nNext, I would like to address the issue of our responsibilities. Given our state of weakness and our minority status here, the governmental aspects of the sharia’ do not apply to us. We are not legally responsible for the governmental aspects because of our condition here. Given that, what becomes our responsibility? If Allah has removed from us those governmental responsibilities here, what then are the responsibilities that we have? I want to look at two aspects.\n\nRelationships of Muslims with Other Muslims\n\nThe first aspect concerns the relationships that we have with one another. These relationships have to be based on brotherhood. They have to be relationships based on love. Since we are minorities here and are few in number, we have to understand that we need to have solidarity. In order for us to have solidarity, there is something that is very important that we must understand about our legal structure, which is the jurisprudence of difference of opinion: fiqh al-khilaaf. We have to look deeply into this because if we understand this, this is a way in which we can be united and have good feelings towards each other and not negative feelings based on our understandings of valid differences of opinion amongst us. This last week in the classes that many of you have attended, we have been looking at usool al fiqh: the foundations upon which our fiqh is based. We looked at many differences of opinion amongst the scholars and how they were linguistically valid, how they were actually differences of opinion that had foundations; they were not differences based upon empty opinions. They were differences based on real issues that have validity and substance. If we understand that, this will enable us to rise up spiritually to another level of relationship with our fellow Muslims. It will take us to a higher level so that we begin to have differences that are still based on love and mutual respect. We will begin to see that there are different ways of doing things and that there is validity in them all.\n\nWe can learn a lesson from the western people who have individuality as one of the foundations of their culture. They respect the rights of people to explore their individuality. There is some good in this understanding, and the Muslims should learn from this even though it is originally from our own tradition. We should see that part of their strength lies in this ability. What this will enable us to do is build bridges. Despite the fact that there are two different opinions which place us in two different positions, this love and mutual respect enables a bridge to be built from one perspective to another perspective, and this creates contact; this creates the ability for us to visit each other, to be together. We should look at these hadiths in which the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “the Muslims are one hand;” “the Muslims are strong;” “a Muslim is strong by his brother;” “the Muslims come together as one hand against those who oppose them;” “the Muslims are like one body: if one part becomes afflicted with some illness, the rest of the body shares in that affliction with insomnia and fever.”\n\nFurthermore, the Quran says, “Do not disagree:” do not “tanaaza`u” that is a strong word in Arabic. It is different from “ikhtilaaf: disagreement.” “Tanaaza`u ” is saying, do not have conflict with one another-not disagreement-but conflict. Do not have conflict with one another, and if you do that, the wind that gives you strength to move forward will dissipate, and you will fail in your task. You will fail in what you want to achieve. Allah subhaana wa ta’aala said, “Rectify what is of between you.” That is, Allah says to rectify the differences that you have. Rectify the hearts, so that you come together. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam,said, “Al-muslimu akh ul-muslim: The Muslim is a brother of his fellow Muslim.” He does not oppress him nor does he give him up to the enemy. Thus, all of these are indications that we should be together in spite of our differences if those differences are based on valid fiqhi differences; and this is why we must look into the jurisprudence related to differences of opinion.\n\nWe should look at these differences of opinion like different trains that are carrying different baggage or that are going to different places. These trains could be traveling on the same track at different times. If you do not organize them, the result is a disaster. They will crash. But if you organize them, the trains could be using the same tracks even though they are going to different destinations, have different concerns, and have different purposes. So, the blessing of organizing these differences is that the differences do not cause us to crash into each other so that we do not get anything done in the end.\n\nIn a sense, we could look at this like a famous fable. There is a legend about a lion and three bulls who were in the jungle. One of them was white, one was yellow, and one was black. The lion was not able to eat these three bulls because if he came near them, they would all stand up together, and each one of them would face the lion, so he could not eat them. The lion began to think about how he could get them to become divided.\n\nHe saw the bulls grazing once, and he approached the black and the yellow ones, and he said, “You know that white one over there” He kind of looks like the people around here. He’s different from us. Why don’t you let me eat him?”\n\nThe two bulls said, “Yeah, go ahead. Get rid of him.” So, the lion went and ate the white one.\n\nThen, the next day, the lion came to the yellow bull, and he said, “Haven’t you noticed that you and I look the same? We have the same color. We’re really cousins! And this black one over here-he’s different from you. So, why don’t you let me eat him?”\n\nThe yellow one said, “Yeah, you’re right. Go ahead.” So, the lion went and ate him. Then, on the third day, the lion came for the yellow bull and said, “I’m going to eat you.” The yellow one replied, “I was eaten the day you ate the white one.”\n\nThis is what happens when you get separated. You lose your strength; you lose your power to do anything. We have to realize that what unites us as Muslims is so much greater than what divides us as Muslims. Our areas of difference are very small in relation to our areas of agreement. This is why we should recognize the power of being together setting aside our differences. In the western world, you have arbitrators. In the whole world, you have arbitrators. You don’t want to bring in a judge. You want to bring in somebody who arbitrates. What an arbitrator tries to do is get both people to be satisfied so that one does not lose while the other wins. An arbitrator will try to get each group to compromise a little bit, to come to some kind of compromised agreement where they are both content; each one has given up a little bit, but in giving up, they have come together, and there is a win-win situation. You go to the qaadi (judge) as a last resort-“aakhiru dawaa’ al-kay: surgery is the final remedy.” You do not go to a surgeon the first time. The surgeon is always the last one you go to in the line of specialists. Doctors will try to cure you in other ways first and will send you to the surgeon as a last resort.\n\nOne of the disasters of the situation that we find ourselves in here is that you have Muslims making hijra to these lands from the Muslim world bringing their baggage along with them. So, they are bringing all of these problems with them that have nothing to do with the new circumstances they find themselves in. Furthermore, the challenges that they have in these new circumstances are so great that these problems that they are opening up are causing all kinds of trouble for them. Thus, the are not able to unite. They are not able to do things to benefit them because they are arguing about all these ridiculous things. There is something that we can learn from in the qawaa’id of the Maliki school. [The shaykh gives legal opinions or fatwas from all the schools even though the primary school that he studied was Maliki.] This particular qaa’ida is one that you find only in the Maliki school. This interesting qaa’ida is “jama’til muslimeen taqumu maqaam al-qaadi: a group of Muslims can stand in lieu of a judge.” That is, the group can actually take the place of a judge.\n\n[I told the shaykh the other day that there is an American researcher who says that the twelve jury system that we have here in America is from the Maliki school. It was actually taken by western people from the Maliki school. The principle is that a jury of peers will judge you because in those days they did not have qaadis (judges).] The wisdom behind this principle that Imam Malik was indicating is that when people come together, there is a synergistic power of unity in which they will more likely be right in their judgments than wrong. So, if the group makes a judgment, this is why their judgment has the weight and authority, in the Maliki school, of a legal scholar making a judgment based on his knowledge of the sharia’.\n\nThe Need for Three Institutions\n\nThe Mufti\n\nIn order for us to come to a point where we can work together in spite of our differences, or with our differences, we need three institutions. The first one is the institution of fatwa. Fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion. It is not binding on all the Muslims. It is binding on those who ask for it, but it is a non-binding opinion, and there is room for differences and other opinions. The mufti is somebody who gives legal opinions based on the understanding-on the ijtihaad-of all of the different areas of need in the sharia’, such as marriage, the rules of buying and selling, the rules of prayer, and the rules of tahaara (cleanliness and purification). The mufti is involved in all of these different things. So, we need a muassasa that deals with this for the Muslims. They need a sound source for guidance when these issues occur in which there are differences.\n\nThe Court\n\nThe second institution we need is a muassasa of tahkeem, which is an institution that issues rulings. In this culture, it is called people’s court. A people’s court is where the state does not get involved with the case. The parties that are differing agree to go to somebody who will listen to both sides and then make a judgment, and that judgment becomes binding upon them based on the prior agreement of the two. This has been done already in the United States in Texas, so there are Muslims that are doing this, and we should be competing with them in good.\n\nReconciliation\n\nThe third institution we need is the sulih. A musassasa deals with sulih which is reconciliation. It deals with bringing people together. Somebody brings the differing groups together and reconciles between them so that they can work together or work separately in peace; thus, they are not fighting each other, undermining each other’s work.\n\nAll of these institutions are necessary, but it is impossible to get these without having the least amount of respect and desire to bring this about. There has to be a desire for this, and if the desire is not there, then it is a disaster. Furthermore, setting up these particular institutions is not different from setting up other organizations such as those that are created for social issues, for helping the needy, and for doing all the other different things that organizations do. These three institutions are necessary for us in order for us to move on and to resolve a lot of the things that are causing disruption.\n\nRelationships Between Muslims and non-Muslims\n\nThe first thing we looked at was our relationship between Muslims in these lands living together. The second thing we have to look at is the relationship that we have with non-Muslims. Now, an issue that we must look at is that of the abode: the daar. Although there may be some people who are educated in Islam who are aware of this issue of the abode, there are many people who are unaware of this issue. In fact, you will even find some people who are fuqaha, scholars of Islamic law and the legal system, who are unaware of this issue. The issue of the abode is this: most people think that the world is divided into two abodes, the abode of peace and the abode of war. The abode of peace is the land of the Muslims, daar al-Islam, and the abode of war is everywhere else. In Nixon’s book that I read a translated version of called Seizing the Moment, Nixon wrote a long chapter on the Islamic phenomenon of the modern world. One of the things Nixon said after praising Islam a great deal and saying many nice things about Islam is that one of the most fundamental problems with the Muslims is that they view the world as a dichotomy of two abodes: the abode of peace and the abode of war. So, the central aspect of international relationships with the Muslims is aggression; it is one of war. This idea is wrong. There are three abodes: there is the abode of peace, the abode of war, and then there is the abode of treaty where there is a contractual agreement between two abodes.\n\nFor instance, when I came into this country, they issued me a visa, and I signed something. In the issuance of the visa and my signing of it, a legally binding contract occurred which was a sulih. It was an agreement that when I came into this country, I would obey the laws and would follow the restrictions that this visa demanded that I follow. This was a contractual agreement that is legally binding according even to the divine laws. In looking at this, we have to understand that the relationship between the Muslims living in this land and the dominant authorities in this land is a relationship of peace and contractual agreement-of a treaty. This is a relationship of dialogue and a relationship of giving and taking.\n\nRight to teach Islam\n\nWe should remember that when the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, was in Makkah, what he asked for from the Quraish was just that they left him alone to do his da’wa. He said, “Khalu bayni wa baynan naas: Leave me alone to talk to these people. Let me speak to them; let me call them.” And they wouldn’t let him do that. However, in this country, the ruling people are allowing you to call people to Islam, and this is exactly what the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, was asking that they allow him to do in Makkah. These people here are allowing you to call people to Islam. They are not prohibiting you. If you go out and proselytize, they don’t come and arrest you; they don’t punish you; they don’t torture you. This idea here should be understood, and the verse from the Quran that we should take as the overriding verse in our relationship with this people is where Allah subhaana wa ta’aala says concerning those who neither fight you because of your religion nor remove you from your homes that He does not prohibit you from showing them birr: righteousness. “Birr” in the Arabic language is the highest degree of ihsaan-it is the ‘aala daraja of ihsan. Allah does not prevent you from showing them excellence-moral excellence-in your transactions with them nor from sharing with them a portion of your wealth.\n\nQadi Abu-Bakr, Ibn ‘Atiyah, and others have also said that this is what “antuqsitu ‘ilayhim” means. You give non-Muslims qistan: a portion of your wealth. In the early period of Islam, this is ta’lif al-quloob: one of the things that they used to do in order to bring people close. They would give monetary gifts to people whom they saw had inclinations towards Islam in order to draw the hearts. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “give gifts to each other and love one another.” So, the act of giving something naturally inclines the one who is receiving the gift to have feelings of love towards the person who is giving them. The reason for doing these things-for treating these people with respect, showing this good character, and having this good courtesy-is that you will get from amongst them those who respond and will actually enter into Islam. This really is how we should see our relationship. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, not only gave gifts to some of the mushrikeen in Makkah, he also received gifts from them because his goal was that they become Muslim. He did not want to fight them-that was the last resort. The goal was that they become Muslim, that they enter into Islam.\n\nNon-aggression and honesty\n\nAlso, it is necessary for us to show respect to these people. Islam prohibits us from showing aggression towards people who do not show aggression towards us. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “Do not enter the houses of the Christians nor eat anything of their fruits except with their permission.” Islam prohibits theft; it prohibits fraud; it prohibits cheating; and it prohibits these things in relation to the Muslims and in relation to the non-Muslims. The things that you cannot do to a Muslim, you also cannot do to a non-Muslim. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, also said, “None of you truly believes until he wants for his brother what he wants for himself.” Imam Shabrakhiti ibn Rajul al-Hambali and others mentioned that “brother” here not only means your brother Muslim because this is a close brotherhood of Islam that others are not in, but it refers to the greater and broader brotherhood of our Adamic nature. It is a brotherhood in the sense that we are all from Adam, that Adam is the father of all us. Understanding this should cause us to realize that we have distant relations with all of these people out there, and all of them are potential Muslims. We should see them as potential Muslims.\n\nAllah, subhaana wa ta’aala, for that reason says, “Call to your Lord with wisdom and with a beautiful admonition, and dispute them in the most excellent of ways.” In other words, debate with them and dialogue with them in the most beautiful of ways. Don’t be argumentative; don’t be cruel; don’t be mean; don’t humiliate them. Do it ways in which they can listen to the truth, respect the truth, and come to the truth. For this reason, we have to be du’ahtis salaam: people who are callers to peace.\n\nWe also have to be good citizens because an excellent Muslim is also an excellent citizen in the society that he lives in. This does not mean that we lose our distinction, that we become completely immersed in the dominant society to where we no longer have our own identity-that is not what I’m calling to. We have to maintain those things that are particular to us as a community, but we also have to recognize that there are other things that are not particular to us but rather general to the human condition that we can partake in; and these things are not things that we should be ignorant and neglectful of but things that we should be engaged in. We have to maintain our roots. We have deep roots in our faith, but at the same time we have to be open to allow others to come into that deep-rootedness.\n\nIn addition, we have to recognize that the creation itself is a creation of diversity. It is a creation in which you see variation of colors. Allah did not make all the trees one, and He did not make all the animals one. He diversified the creation. He diversified even our colors and our languages; and He did all this for a wisdom. Not only that, Allah subhaana wa ta’aala made us on different religions and different paths, and He did that intentionally because He said in the Quran, “They continue to be in differences except those whom your Lord has shown His mercy to, and for that reason He created them.” So, Allah subhaana wa ta’aala is saying that He actually created us in order that we differ-that there is a wisdom, a divine wisdom in the differences that we have. He created us to show mercy to us as well. So, we have to rise up to this challenge. This is a high challenge, and we as Muslims have to rise up to this challenge.\n\nModeration: avoiding the Extremes\n\nAnother thing that is very important for us to remember is the moderation of Islam. This is a deen of wasatiyyah: it is a deen of moderation. We are a moderate community. We are between the two extremes of excess and deficiency. We are in the middle. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “Those people who go into matters too deeply will be destroyed.” [The shaykh is an expert in the Arabic language, and he said, “those people” are people involved in “tatarruf” or extremism. That is what “tanata`u’” is.] The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “The extremists are destroyed,” and he said, “Beware of extremism in the deen.” The Prophet, sallal"
