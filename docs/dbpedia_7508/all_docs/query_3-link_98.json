And alhamdulillah for His Decrees, the Universal and the Legislative ones. Alhamdulillah – for He deserves all the Praise. Wa ash-hadu al-laa ilaha ilAllah – and I bear witness that no god deserves worship except Allah, the True God, without a partner or an associate. And I bear witness that Muhammad ‘abduhu, al-Mustafa, (is) His chosen slave and Messenger and Prophet, the truthful one, who is inspired and sent as a mercy to mankind, an evidence against all those who rebel.\n\nAllah subhana wa ta’aala, when He got Adam down to earth, He sent him down by a Decree, manifesting His perfect Attributes and Actions, so that Adam returns to his earlier, best conditions. He wanted, subhanahu wa ta’aala, to make Adam and his offspring taste from the toils of this life, and its worries and concerns, that which will make him magnify and make them magnify the value of entering the Abode of Bliss again, because the opposite is manifested by its opposite, and if they were to be raised in the Abode of Bliss, they wouldn’t have estimated its proper value.\n\nHe also, subhana wa ta’aala, wanted to command them and to test them and to try them, and Paradise is not the Abode for checking legal responsibility, so He sent them down to Earth. And in return, He compensated for that with the best of rewards, which would not have been possible to attain without His Commands and Legislations. And He subhanahu wa ta’aala wanted to make from them Prophets and Messengers and friends and martyrs, loving them and they love Him. So He left a free encounter between them and between His enemies, and tried them through that. And when they preferred that which leads to their Creator, and exerted themselves and their wealth in His Pleasure and in that which He loves, they attained from His Love and from His Pleasure and Nearness to Him, that which would not be possible to attain without all of this happening – sending them for the place of trials and checking.\n\nHe, subhana wa ta’aala, is qualified with the best Names: the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful, the Oft-Pardoning, the Clement One, the One Who lifts in honor, and the One Who humiliates to disgrace, the One Who gives life and causes death, and it is inevitable that the manifestations of these Names occur, and thus, His Hikmah, His Wisdom was to send Adam down and his offspring in an abode, manifesting upon them that, which is entailed by His Beautiful Names: forgiving whomever He wishes, having Mercy upon whomever He wishes, lifting in honor whomever He wishes, disgracing in humiliation whomever He wishes, lifting in might whomever He wishes, and avenging from whomever He wishes, giving and taking – all in accordance with His Wisdom, Knowledge and Justice.\n\nHe subhanahu wa ta’aala, is al-Malik, the King, and the King, He is the One Who commands and prohibits, the One Who commands and forbids, the One Who gives reward and the One Who punishes, the One Who honors and the One Who humiliates, so His Kingship entailed that Adam and his offspring be in an abode, upon them manifested the rulings of the King; then He takes them to an Abode, perfecting what His Decrees entail. He subhana wa ta’aala sent them , to an abode in which their belief in the Unseen is the beneficial belief, whereas the belief in the witnessed, it is such that everyone will believe on the Day of Resurrection, when, at that time, no soul will be availed except if it believed in the Unseen. So if they were created in the Abode of Bliss, they wouldn’t have attained the rank of believing in the Unseen, and the enjoyment and the honor cannot be attained without the belief in this Unseen. As a consequence of their belief in the Unseen, they will be in the Abode of enjoyment and honor.\n\nAnd Allah subhana wa ta’aala created Adam from a hold: He held a Hand-full from all earth, and the earth has the good and wicked, the easy and difficult, the honorable and the wretched and the mean. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ‘Allah created Adam from a hold of a Hand-full from all earth, and so the children of Adam came like the earth. From them is the white and the black and the red and the yellow, and between them, and the easy and the difficult, and the wicked and the good.’ And this hadith is of authentic narration. So He knew subhana wa ta’aala, that in the loins of Adam, there are those who are not fit to be in His Abode, so He brought them down to an abode to extract from them the good and the wicked from their loins, then He distinguished them separately in two Abodes, making the good the ones deserving His Nearness in His Abode of Paradise, and as to the wicked to be the inhabitants of the Abode fitting the evil and wicked ones. That’s why Allah said, ‘In order that Allah may distinguish the wicked disbelievers from the good believers and put the wicked, one on another, heap them together and cast them into Hell; those, it is they who are the losers.’ And when He subhana wa ta’aala knew that amongst his offspring, Adam’s offspring, there are those who are not fit for Allah’s Closeness and Nearness, He threw them down to an abode from which He extracted those and (will) send them to the abode that fits them. Perfect Wisdom and penetrating Will, and this is the Taqdeer of al-Aziz al-Aleem, this is the Decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.\n\nAnd when He said to His angels – ‘And remember when your Lord said to the angels: ‘Verily I am going to place mankind, generations after generations, on earth’, they said, ‘Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, while we glorify You with praises and thanks?’, He answered them, ‘I know that which you don’t know.’ Then He made His Knowledge manifested to His slaves and to His angels, in that which He made, on earth, from the special of His creation and His Messengers and His Prophets and His friends, and from those who draw near(ness) to Him, exerting themselves and their lives for His Love and for His Pleasure and content, while struggling against their lusts and their desires, leaving that which is beloved to them in order to draw nearer to Him, abandoning their lusts for His Pleasure, exerting their blood and themselves in His love and praising Him day and night, worshiping Him while facing the impediments of desire and lusts, and the self and the enemy, while you, the angels, worship Me without any impediment opposing you, and without any lust overwhelming you, and without an enemy facing you; your worship of Me is just like your breath. Furthermore, I want to make manifest that which is hidden from you in relation to My enemy and his war against Me and his arrogance, taking the path against My Pleasure. This and that were hidden in the father of mankind and the father of Jinn. So He brought them both down, making manifest that Knowledge which was known only to Him subhanahu wa ta’aala, and making manifest His Wisdom, and His Decree was perfected and executed, and then it became clear to the angels, that Knowledge which Allah kept from them and which they knew not.\n\nAnd since He subhana wa ta’aala loves the patient ones, and loves the good-doers, and those who fight in His Cause in ranks solidified, and those who turn to Him in repentance, and those who purify themselves in His Pleasure, and those who love gratitude – and His Love is the utmost of honor – then accordingly, His Hikmah, His Wisdom, is to put Adam and his offspring in an abode to bring forth these qualities, through which they can attain the highest of His honors from His Love. And thus, their sending down to the earth is from the greatest favors upon them. ‘But Allah choses for His Mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the Owner of great Bounty.‘\n\nAnd He subhanahu wa ta’aala wanted to have from Adam’s offspring an offspring who will receive His Help and Love and they love Him. His Love of them is their greatest objective and perfection, and this would not be manifest except by agreeing to His Pleasure and following His Command, and relinquishing the wills of the self and its desires, so He brought them down to an abode, commanding them therein and forbidding them from what He forbade them, so they carried on His Commands and kept away from His Prohibitions, attaining through that their love of Him, so He gave them His Love. And this is from His Perfect Wisdom and Perfect Mercy.\n\nHe subhana wa ta’aala, when He created His creation in states and conditions and many forms, part of His Decree is that He made Adam and his offspring excel over many of His creation; He made their ‘ubudiyyah to Him, their slavery in worship of Him, the best of their ranks. It is affirmed that Allah subhana wa ta’aala sent Jibril to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , giving him the choice to choose between to be a king-Prophet, or a slave-Prophet. He looked at Jibril as if consulting him. Jibril indicated to him, ‘Be humble’, so he said, ‘Rather I choose to be a slave-Prophet.’ And this hadith is reported by Ahmad and others and its chain is sahih, is correct. And Allah mentioned him, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , as a slave in the highest mentioning of ranks, in the rank of ‘Isra, of Ascension to Heaven; He called him a slave worshiper, and in the rank of da’wah and in the rank of challenges, He called him ‘abd, slave. In the rank of Isra’, He subhana wa ta’aala described him and mentioned him, ‘Glorified be He (Allah) Who took His slave, Muhammad…‘ – He didn’t say, His Messenger Muhammad, He didn’t say His Prophet Muhammad – ‘for a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque’, the Sacred Haram, ‘to the farthest mosque’ in Jerusalem, in al-Quds, denoting that he attained this rank of ‘ubudiyyah, of slavery to Allah, and this is at the highest and most perfect station a person can reach.\n\nAnd in the station of da’wah, in Surah al-Jinn, ‘(It has been revealed to me that) When the slave of Allah (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم )‘ – He didn’t call him His Messenger, He didn’t call him His Prophet here – ‘stood up invoking (his Lord Allah) in prayer to Him they (the Jinns) just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other (in order to listen to the Prophet’s recitation).‘ At this da’wah station, He called him, the slave.\n\nAnd in the station of challenge also He called him a slave, as in Surah al-Baqarah 2:23, ‘And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur’an) to Our slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.’ A station of challenge. And in the sahihain, al-Bukhari and Muslim, in the hadith of intercession and when the Prophets direct people to go to whom? To go to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم; listen to Jesus peace be upon him, to ‘Isa ‘alayhi salaam, saying to them, ‘Go to Muhammad, a slave whom Allah subhana wa ta’aala forgave him his past and future sins’, indicating that he صلى الله عليه وسلم attained this greatest and most perfect station, and this is the station of ‘ubudiyyah to Allah, slavery to Allah.\n\nAnd if this ‘ubudiyyah to Allah has this level, then His Wisdom entailed that Allah made Adam and his offspring reside in an abode to work for this rank through their obedience to Him and through drawing nearer to Him in that which He loves and abandoning and relinquishing their familiarities, what they prefer, for His Sake, and this therefore, is from His perfect Bounty and Favor upon them.\n\nHe subhana wa ta’aala wanted His slaves, whom He bestowed upon them from His Bounty, wanted them to appreciate the Bounty so that they become more loving of Him and more perfect in their gratitude, and more in their enjoyment of what He gave them, so He subhana wa ta’aala made them see what He does to His enemies and what He prepared for them of punishments and all sorts of painful torments. This would not have been, without having them on earth and testing and trialing them, giving success to whom He wishes, as Mercy and Favor from Him, and humiliation to whom He wishes, entailed by His Wisdom and Justice, and He is All-knowing and All-Wise. Each of them received what they received because to him – either one – is the proper place: one receiving the Mercy and the Bounty and fitting for it, and the other not fit for that, and therefore dealt with His Justice. And there is no doubt when the believer sees his enemy and the enemy of the One he loves, and Who is most beloved to him, Allah, seeing him going through the punishments, while he is enjoying the Mercy and the Bliss of Allah, then his pleasure increases and his enjoyment intensifies. And the Favors will be perfected.\n\nAnd He subhana wa ta’aala created us – created them to worship Him, this is the objective sought: Allah says what means, ‘I have created Jinn and mankind for the sole purpose of worshiping Me Alone,’ and it is known the perfected ‘ubudiyyah requested from the creation would not occur in the Abode of Bliss and other living, rather it occurs in the abode of trials and tests. As to the Abode of Bliss, that’s an Abode of enjoyment and favors, it is not an Abode for testing and trials and legal checking of responsibility. So it is from the Favor of Allah upon Adam and his offspring that He made them examine and see what their enemy did to them and to their father, so they are to be prepared and take guard. And if it is said, ‘It would have been possible that He may not try them with their enemy’, then it is to be said, ‘It preceded that Allah subhana wa ta’aala created Adam and his offspring in a form which entails their mixing with the enemy and to be tried by him, and if He would have wished, He would have created them like the angels: intellect without desire. So in this case, the enemy would not have a way to them. But had they been created on this nature, there would have been creation other than the creation of the children of Adam. The children of Adam had been formulated on intellect and desire, and that’s why they have to face the enemy.’\n\nAnd since man’s happiness is in Allah’s Love, and since the true love can be attained when the beloved is given precedence and preference over everything else from the desires of the self, and since this requires hardship in obedience and to attain His Pleasure, in this way, the love really settles and its affirmation becomes known through such struggles. As such then, His Hikmah, His Wisdom, Allah’s Wisdom entailed bringing them to this abode which is engulfed with desires and what the self loves, in order for them to attain His Love and giving Him preference and precedence over everything else. And that’s why they can bear the difficulties and (have) patience against temptations and misguidance. Through that, the authority of love intensifies and its tree in the heart grows and its fruits on the limbs sprout, because the true love is the one which is affirmed despite the impediments, and the other love which is conditional upon pleasure, good health, is not affirmed when it is faced by impediments and oppositions, because the thing which is dependent upon a conditional thing, will not exist when the condition is not existing. And anyone who loves you for a certain objective, he will turn away from you when his objective is over. And there is a difference between the one who worships Allah in all of his conditions, happiness, prosperity, distress, adversity, testing and trials, from the one who worships Him only in conditions of prosperity and happiness.\n\nAnd since to Allah belongs all the perfect Praise, then, the manifestation of the causes which He is to (be) praise(d) for them, this is entailed by the fact that He is the Praised One, and that it is binding to His Praise. How is that? Because the causes are of two types: a bounty and a justice, and He is praised in all of that. Therefore, it is inevitable that the causes of justice be manifested so that the perfect Praise is attained, which He deserves. In the same manner, that He subhana wa ta’aala is praised for His Favors and Bounties and Rewards, He is praised for His Justice and Avenge and Punishment, because all of that originates from His Might and Wisdom. And that’s why He subhana wa ta’aala pointed to this so many times, as in Surah ash-Shu’ara, where He mentions at the end of each story from the stories of the Messengers and their nations, He mentions the following verse, in (Chapter) 26, meaning, ‘Verily! In this’ – what happened to the Messengers in their confrontation with their nations and the punishment that came to their nations when they rejected – ‘is indeed a sign (or a proof), yet most of them are not believers. And verily, your Lord! He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.’ So here, He tells us that this is coming from His Might, which comprises His Perfect Ability, and from His Wisdom, which comprises His Perfect Knowledge and putting things in their fitting places. So, He put His Favor and safety to His Messengers and their followers, and put His Anger and Revenge and destruction on their enemies, each in its proper place, because of His two Attributes: ‘Izza wa Hikmah – Might and Wisdom. And that’s why He subhana wa ta’aala, after He tells us about His Decree between the people of happiness and people of wretchedness and the destiny of each of them to their respective abodes, which do not fit except them, and which his wisdom cannot entail except that, He said, (in Chapter) 39:75, which means, ‘And you will see the angels surrounding the Throne, exalting [Allah] with praise of their Lord. And it will be judged between them in truth, and it will be said, “[All] praise to Allah, Lord of the worlds, the Lord of all that exists.”’\n\nOn this one we stop, and we continue this subject inshaaAllah tomorrow, and this is based on Imam Ibn Qayyim’s rahimahullah discussions on the Wisdoms of Allah subhana wa ta’aala and His creation, and this is from his book – based upon such discussion which he had in his book, ‘Miftahu Daarus-Sa’aadah’ – ‘The Key to the Door of Happiness’.\n\nWe ask Allah subhanahu wa ta’aala to have mercy on Imam Ibn Qayyim rahimahullah and to make us from the people of the Abode of Happiness, al-Jannah.\n\nWa salAllahu ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala aalihi wa sahbihi wa sallam. [end of part 1]\n\nPart 2 –\n\nBismillahir-rahmanir-rahim. All praise is due to Allah, the Most High, the Originator and Creator of the heavens and the earth. He decrees what He wills, and He does what He wills. He subhanahu wa ta’aala brought Adam to earth, put him and his offspring in an abode, commanding them and forbidding them, in order to bring forth from them those that He loves and they love Him. His Love of them is their utmost objective for perfection and the most of nobility they can attain, and such objectives, noble and high, cannot be achieved except in complying with what pleases Allah and following His Decrees and Commands, and abandoning the self and its lusts. His Wisdom subhanahu wa ta’aala made them excel over eachother in order those upon whom He bestowed the Mercy give gratitude to Him and for them to know that they were given this favor and this honor, and were they all to be equal in the favor and safety, then no one having favor would really estimate its value and would not exert at all thanks as it should be exerted, because he would see of the others the same as his condition, all equal in favorability. But from the main causes for extracting the shukr, the gratitude, is, that those who receive Allah’s na’mah and favor, sees his condition in an opposite condition to others, not forgetting that there is nothing that Allah loves most from the slaves more than his humility and humbleness and submissiveness before His Hands subhana wa ta’aala, and poverty to Him, and this is not achievable in the abode of endless Bliss, where there is perfect Bliss and there is no accountability and no legal responsibility. The causes that will bring forth the humility and humbleness from man to Allah, for them to be in the Abode of endless Bliss, is not perceivable, because this would be mixing together two opposites. And that’s why they are here, in order to bring it forth here on earth, and to prove themselves.\n\nAnd He subhana wa ta’aala, to Him belongs the Commandment and Creation, and the Commandment is His Legal Ways with which He sends His Messengers and brought down His Books, and the Jannah is not Daarut-takleef, an abode for legal checking of responsibility. It is an Abode of Na’eem, Pleasure and Bliss. So, His Hikmah, subhana wa ta’aala, His Wisdom, entails extracting Adam and his offspring to this abode here, upon them, the rulings and the decrees to be applicable, in order to manifest from them what is entailed by His Commands. Since we know that His Action subhana wa ta’aala is from what is entailed by His Perfect Names and Attributes, similarly, His Amr and Sharra’, His Command and His Legal Ways and what they produce from reward and punishment, all of this is from what is entailed by His Names and Attributes. And Allah directed to this meaning in many parts of His Book; listen to what He said in Surah al-Qiyaamah verse 36, (which means), ‘Does man think that he will be left Suda [neglected without being punished or rewarded for the obligatory duties enjoined by his Lord (Allah) on him]?‘ – functionless, without being commanded nor forbidden, nor to be punished or rewarded. And, you know, this is obviously in opposition to the perfection of Allah’s Wisdom and His Ruboobiyyah, His Lordship, and His Might, wa ‘Izzati. And His Wisdom does not fit to have such a neglected creation. And that’s why He subhana wa ta’aala, in this Statement, look at it carefully: ‘Does man think that he will be left neglected?‘ – this is denunciation for anyone who claims this to be the case. Similarly, when He said in Surah al-Mu’minoon 23 verse 115, (which means), ‘Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?‘ It’s not befitting His Wisdom. Next verse: ‘So Exalted be Allah, the True King, La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne!’ He glorifies Himself, declared it above any imperfection in this respect, because this is in opposition to what is entailed by His Names and Attributes, subhana wa ta’aala. Many are the verses like this in the Qur’an.\n\nAdd to this the fact that Allah subhana wa ta’aala loves from His slaves many things to be done, but these cannot be done without the causes that lead to them, and then cannot be done except in this Daar, in this abode of tests and trials. For He subhana wa ta’aala loves the patient and the persevering, and He loves those who give gratitude, and He loves those who fight in His Way, and He loves those who often repent, and loves those who are pure and purify, and there is no doubt that the manifestation of these beloved things, without their causes, is not perceivable. Impossible! And Allah subhana wa ta’aala loves taubah from His slaves, and He is so pleased with it. Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His slave than a man who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized but he has his riding animal carrying his food and water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a short while and wakes to find his riding animal gone. He starts looking for it and suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Allah wished him to suffer from. He then says, ‘I will go back to my place.’ He returns and sleeps again and then, getting up, he raises his head to find his riding animal beside him, as in Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol 8, 320. What is meant here is that this Pleasure of Allah is in response to the taubah from the slave, to the repentance from the slave, and therefore repentance and sin are inter-related and they are causes which draws the Pleasure of Allah. Because it is impossible for what is entailed to occur without that which entails it. So this Pleasure is due to the taubah, which is related to the sin, and it is impossible for this to occur in the Abode of Bliss, because there is no sin in the Abode of Bliss. And since this Pleasure to Allah is so beloved than its non-existence, then His Love necessitated to create its causes, which would lead to it, and which are beloved to Him. And that’s why man is in this abode of trials and tests and sins and repentance, with all these causes that would lead to that which is beloved to Allah and therefore for His Pleasure.\n\nFurthermore, Allah made Paradise an Abode of Reward, and divided it into ranks, people dwelling in different ranks according to their deeds. And on this condition Allah created it, because of the Wisdom entailed by His Names and Attributes. Paradise are levels on top of levels, and between each two levels is as that which is between the heavens and the earth, as came in the hadith reported by al-Bukhari, from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, ‘Paradise is 100 levels, between each two levels is that which is between the heavens and the earth (from a distance).’ And the Wisdom of Allah subhana wa ta’aala necessitates the habitation of these levels, and that it will be established, and differences between levels of people in these different ranks in accordance with their deeds, as therefore entailed by His Wisdom subhana wa ta’aala. And it is, as more than one of the Righteous Predecessors has mentioned, they are saved from the Fire of Hell by the Forgiveness and Pardoning of Allah, and they will enter Paradise by His Favor and Bounty and Forgiveness, and they will be divided into the ranks and levels and abodes within Paradise in accordance with their deeds. So the entrance and admittance to the Paradise originally is by the Bounty and Favor and Forgiveness of Allah and His Mercy, and this is what explains the hadith of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, ‘None of you will enter Paradise by his deeds.‘ They said, ‘Nor even you, O Messenger of Allah?’ he said, ‘Even me.’ What he intended here صلى الله عليه وسلم, is the forbiddance to or negating the origin of admittance, and this is related to the Mercy and Bounty of Allah and His Forgiveness; and what is negated is the kind of trade, i.e. our works for Jannah. Because there is no comparison between man’s righteous deeds, even though they are beloved to Allah, and what Allah gives him from the Favors. Our deeds cannot stand to equate the Favors of Allah subhana wa ta’aala in no way. In fact, they will fall short in comparison with the least of His Favors upon us. And had it not (been) therefore for the Mercy of Allah upon His slaves, He wouldn’t have admitted them to Paradise. Because the deeds of man, even if they are so much, they on their own are not or do not necessitate the entrance to Paradise. What is intended therefore, is that His Wisdom, subhana wa ta’aala, necessitated the creation of Paradise on different levels, and to populate them with Adam and his offspring, in these levels, in accordance with their deeds, and this by itself entailed sending them to this abode of action and striving, where they are going to be different in terms of their deeds.\n\nHe created Adam and his offspring generations after generations, as Allah spoke about this in Surah al-Baqarah, Chapter 2 verse 30, (which means), ‘And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: “Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.’ And as He subhana wa ta’aala said also in Surah al-An’am 165, (which means), ‘And it is He Who has made you generations coming after generations, replacing each other on the earth.’ And Allah said in Surah al-A’raf, Chapter 7 :129, (which means), ‘It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors on the earth, so that He may see how you act?‘ So Allah intended to remove Adam and his offspring from this succession on earth to inherit him the Abode of Bliss, and He subhana wa ta’aala knew in His Foreknowledge that Adam and his offspring are weak and that they may hasten to that which is minimal and prefer it for that of the long-run in the Hereafter. Allah He knew, He created him, He knew his nature, so His Wisdom, subhana wa ta’aala, entailed admitting him to Paradise in the first place to recognize and to see its Bliss which he saw it really, in order what? In order what? So that he yearned to it, he longs to it and becomes more keen to return to it and becomes more intense in seeking it. Because loving something, requesting it, yearning, longing to it, is entailed by its examination, is entailed by examining it. Once it’s examined, once it is seen, then the attachment, the longing. So anyone who examines that which is good and sweet, he will be motivated intensely to attain, for when the self tastes, it longs to the thing. And that’s why, when the slave tastes the sweetness of iman, of faith, and it intermingles with his heart, it becomes established, and nothing will affect it. In Sahih Bukhari and Muslim, from the hadith of Abu Hurairah, illustrating this point, ‘Allah asks the angels, saying to them, ‘What are my slaves asking Me?’ The angels respond, ‘They ask You Paradise.’ ‘Did they see it?’ They say, ‘No.’ He says, ‘How about if they saw it?’ ‘Had they seen it, they would be more intensely requesting it and seeking it.’ So His Wisdom subhana wa ta’aala necessitated that He showed their father Paradise and made him dwell in it. Then He related to his offspring, his, Adam’s story therein, so they all became as if they saw it with their father. And those who had been created for it, responded and hastened to it, not looking for the early gains in this life, rather, they prepare themselves for it and looked at it that it was taken away from him by his enemy: shaytan. And therefore he looks at it as his first Abode, longing for it, always yearning to it, to his Abode, to his first home. And he rahimahullah put the following poem, illustrating this point:\n\n‘And come for the Jannaat of bliss,\n\nit is your first home and therein is your camps,\n\nbut we are the captives of the enemy,\n\nso do you see we return to our homes and be saved.’\n\nSo the secrets of all these angles is that Allah subhana wa ta’aala in His Fore-decree and in His Wisdom, is that the sought objectives cannot be attained without it’s causes, causes which Allah made them means to attain these goals, and from these goals is the highest in bliss and most magnificent in bliss, and therefore it cannot be attained except in causes which He had set leading to it. And imagine the lower objective that we encounter, if they cannot be attained except by their respective causes, though weak and disconnected many times, like gaining the food, looking for food, looking for drink, looking for clothing, looking to have children, wealth, prestige, in this life; so how it could be under your delusion that the attainment of the most highest objectives and the most noble, would be without causes leading to it, and that these causes cannot be except in this life, in this abode of striving and cultivation. So therefore, consequently, habitating Adam and his children in this land, on this earth, and creating for them the means for them to utilize, to reach that greatest objective of bliss, is from His Perfect Bounty and Favor upon them.\n\nNot to forget, the other secret is that He subhana wa ta’aala made the Message and Prophethood and love and speaking to whomever He spoke to and slavery to make from the most noble of His creation, so He put them in an abode extracting from them Prophets, sending them the Messengers, taking from them beloved to Him, speaking to Musa directly and taking from them martyrs and slaves and friends and specials who love Him and He loves them, and therefore, sending them to this abode is from the perfection of His Wisdom, from His Bounty, Favors and goodness.\n\nAnd from the secrets is that He manifested for His creation what is entailed by His Names, subhana wa ta’aala, and also He made Himself known to His creation by His Actions, His Names and His Attributes as well, and in that which He put forth amongst them from His friends and from His enemies, and gave them help against them and humiliating them, the enemies, responding to those who responded to Him, fulfilling their needs, making them turn in all sorts of good and evil, in all of this making it known to them that He is their Lord and He is their King, and that He is Allah, la ilaha illa hu – none has the right to be worshiped but He, and that He is the One, All-Knowing, All-Wise, All-Hearing, All-Seeing, the True God, and anything besides Him or to the exclusion of Him is baatil/false. And thus, the evidences for His Rububiyyah, for His Lordship, and His Tawheed on the earth is compounded and His slaves knew Him and attested to His Tawheed, and the losers rejected Him and committed shirk, unjustly and arrogantly.\n\nAnyone who, therefore, ponders His Signs witnessed on earth and His Signs heard on this earth and His Signs seen, and their effects, would come to know His perfect Wisdom in habitating Adam and his offspring in this abode for an appointed term. Because verily Allah had created Jannah, Paradise, for Adam and his offspring, and He made the angels therein servants for Adam and his offspring, however, His Wisdom necessitated that He created for them an abode from where they take provisions to the other One which He created for them, and that they will not attain it except with these provisions, as Allah subhana wa ta’aala said about this abode in Surah an-Nahl 16:7, – this is the example of moving on this earth from one place to the other, then how about the movement from this life to the Next one? – (which means), ‘And they carry your loads to a land that you could not reach except with great trouble to yourselves. Truly, your Lord is full of Kindness, Most Merciful.’ So if this is applicable to moving from one place to the other in this life, that it requires some great trouble, then what about the case of moving from this life to the Abode in the Hereafter? And Allah subhana wa ta’aala said also with the same meaning in Surah al-Baqarah, (which means), ‘And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness, etc.). So fear Me, O men of understanding!’\n\nSo the deceived ones sold their houses for the cheapest and most degradable price, and the successful ones sold themselves and their wealth and put it a price for Paradise, and so they won, and they won the great reward. Allah subhanahu wa ta’aala said in Surah at-Taubah 9:111, (which means), ‘Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties; for the price that theirs shall be the Paradise.’ Nasallaahu min fadhlih – Nasallaahu min fadhlih.\n\nSo Allah did not expel Adam from it, except that He intends to return him to it in the most perfect way. It is as if, ‘O Adam, don’t be worried about My Saying to you, ‘Get out of it’ because it is for you that I created. I am the One Free of want concerning it, Paradise, and regarding everything else, and I am the One Who is Most Generous, Most Noble, and I don’t enjoy there anything, because I am the One Who feeds, but fed not (am not fed), and I am the Rich, Free from all want. Rather, come down to the abode of seeding, and if you spread the seed and the produce stands up firm and it becomes a harvest, then afterwards come, I will give you in full, return, that which you need most; one single seed for 10, to 700 folds, much more amplified reward, because I am Most Perfect in Knowledge concerning your benefit than yourself, and I am the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.’\n\nWe ask Allah subhana wa ta’aala to make us from those who plant the seeds and take care of it; we ask Him subhana wa ta’aala to amplify the reward in Paradise, in seeing His Face, inni huwa ‘ala kulli shayin qadeer, walhamdulillahi Rabbil ‘Alameen, wa la ilaha ilAllaha al-‘Aliyyul-Qadeer, wa Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala aali wa sahbih wa sallam, and may Allah’s Mercy be upon Iman Ibn Qayyim rahimahullah, wa salAllahu ‘ala nabiyyina Muhammadin wa akhira da’wana alhamdulillahi Rabbil ‘Alameen.\n\nTranscribed (with minor additions in italic) by Sister Umm Abdalrahman\n\nShare this, Baarakallaah Feekum: [“One who guides to something good has a reward similar to that of its doer” - Saheeh Muslim vol.3, no.4665] [This website protects the copyrights of the authors/publishers.

Indeed He has prohibited us and He has given us command and He has made it clear to us the path of khair and the path of good and He has encouraged us to follow that. And He has made clear to us the path of evil and has prohibited us from following that. And indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala is more knowledgeable concerning that which is good and that which has the best for His servant in this life and the Hereafter. And He is the Most Knowledgeable concerning that which will give them bliss and that which will give them good fortune in this life and in the Hereafter.\n\nAnd indeed from the things that Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala has made it important and placed importance upon\n\nprotecting it and upon making sure that the Muslims are mindful with regards to it and that He has prohibited us and made us something that we should be distant from corrupting and that is the honour of the Muslim and that is going to be the title of the talk. And indeed it has been established in a hadith in Saheeh al-Bukhari that the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said : ‘indeed your blood, and your wealth and your honour, is haraam upon you (it is prohibited upon you) just as this day is haram or considered sacrilegious and just as this month is considered sacrilegious.\n\nAnd indeed the honour is something that should be protected by the Muslims in two ways :\n\nAs for the first way, that which is apparent from the honour of the Muslims : and that is by clothing it using the\n\ngarments that the Shariah has laid down and prescribed and what the Messenger has prescribed (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).\n\nAnd as for the second type is that which is hidden from the honour : and that is to protect it from zina and to protect it from homosexuality and those types of affairs.\n\nAllaah tabarak wa ta’ala has said : ‘O you who believe, indeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala has sent down upon you a garment that will cover your modesty and He has given you a leash which is something other than from the standard covering. And indeed from the greatest of things that will make the honour of the Muslim corrupt whether they are male or whether they are female and indeed it is that which is referred to or known as ‘zina.’\n\nAnd indeed Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala has said, ‘.. and do not come close to zina. Indeed it is something that is lewd and it is an evil way.’\n\nAnd indeed in this ayah Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala has made Haraam anything that leads to zina and that is never mind the actual committing of the act. Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala has said, ‘ and do not come close to fawahish, do not come close to lewdness, that which is apparent from it and that which is hidden.\n\nAnd indeed the issue of fornication (may Allaah protect us all from it). Indeed along with it being prohibited it is something that likewise corrupts the society, corrupts the community. And indeed it is from the reasons for the spreading of corruption in and amongst the community.’ Insha-Allaah I am going to mentions some of the reasons and some of the things that corrupts the society.\n\nAnd from the first of the evils that come from zina is that it is one of the causes for the spread of many evils and many diseases connected to fornication, just like the sickness of AIDS and other in that from the sicknesses that destroy the lands and destroy the servants.\n\nAnd likewise it is from the reasons that causes commotion in and amongst the family — as far as it relates to the husband or as far as it relates to the wife and to the children and if the family indeed is split, that will lead to the splitting of the community and indeed they will fall into that which are of the lowly actions and will fall into corruptions.\n\nAnd likewise from the evil effects of zina is that it is from the reason for talaaq (or divorce) being plentiful in the societies. Because you find after the marriage, after a small space of time you will find the people divorcing each other and sometimes this happens after a space of few hours.\n\nAnd likewise, from the evil effects of zina and fornication is that it lowers the marriage rates in the society. So as for the person who commits fornication and is constant and regular in doing that, then he does not look to marriage except as another way of having a sexual relationship. Not that it is a beautiful way of uniting two bodies, neither it is a life that is built of love and emotions and raising a family and having children and indeed from bringing and having children, it is by way of those children our that lives become happy lives. And likewise it makes life easy with the presence of the children.\n\nAnd likewise we see from the evil effects of zina and fornication is that we find the level of children and the level of having kids fall in that particular society. Because when zina is one of the reasons for the spread of deadly diseases like AIDS and other than AIDS, we find as a result of that many people die in the society. And as a result of that we find people having children as a result of that die. And as a result of that also the strength of the community is lost.\n\nAnd also from the evil effects of zina, is that it leads to much crime in that society. And from that the crimes that generate and likewise a person will enter into stealing and rape in order to satisfy his sexual desires. And likewise as a result of that we find people even killing each other and killing themselves as a result of this spread of this zina.\n\nAnd likewise from the evil effects of zina, is that we find that we have many children, many offspring that are the children that have come as a result of that fornication. And this likewise is from the sins meaning these children have come about as a product of fornication. This is also from the sins that increases crimes, and increases evil doings in and among society. Because the child from a young age is in need of receiving the love and attention from both his parents. So when the child loses out on that care and loses out on that attention, and when he loses that love, then what happens is that he has a reactory feeling as he grows that he was not nurtured upon love and upon affection. So that breeds from him and lead him to haste and dislike to society and the surrounding that he lives in. So, when he reaches the age of maturity, we find that these individuals enough of time end up themselves being individuals that commit evil acts and committing different crimes in order to avenge that society.\n\nAnd brothers and sisters from the things that we can utilize to protect this evil, to protect ourselves from this evil is by following the message, and the measures and the means that al-Islam has laid down for us. The means have been laid down for protecting our ‘ird — lineage.\n\nSo from the most important means for protecting the limits is the establishment of the belief of Allaah in the hearts of the servant. So if the slave then knows and believes that Allaah is the Creator of the creation, and He is the One that is worshipped and there is none worthy of worship other than Him, then he would carry out his commands and he would stay away from his prohibitions.\n\nAnd likewise he will believe in his heart that Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala knows the hidden things and knows those things which are apparent. And likewise he will know that Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala sees everything that takes place in this creation. And so this Imaan of his will carry him to be odd and over keeping in mind the presence of Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala. And it will lead him likewise, to be distant from disobeying Allaah and it will make him to carry out Allah’s commands and the things that please Allaah. So not once will Allaah see him in a place where Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala dislikes to see him in and likewise he will not be absent from places that Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala loves for him to be in. And that is a condition with the mu’min and the believer who is sincere with his Imaan, the one who is certain concerning his Lord.\n\nListen O brother and listen O sister, to the story of that great Sahabah ; that Sahabi who before Islaam used to commit sins as of fornication and he used to visit prostitutes ; look at his condition after his Islaam. Did he continue upon that which he was upon, in his days of Jaahiliyah before Islaam? .. (not clear) …. And likewise he took upon himself chastity and distanced himself form all evil and all lowly acts.\n\nThis appears in the Sunnan of Tirmidhi that a person from amongst the Sahaba (radiallahu anhu) who was referred to as al-Martad. He used to carry the prisoners of war from Makkah until he reached Medina and there was a woman from amongst the Mushrikeen who was a prostitute or she was a fornicator and her name was ‘Anaaq and she was his girlfriend before Islaam. And he had promised a man from amongst the prisoners of war from the people of Makkah that he was carrying. He said to them radiallaahu ‘I continued until I came to a wall from the walls of Makkah in the shade of a wall on the full moon night man, so ‘Anaaq (this woman) came to him and she had noticed that this man being detained near the wall. So when she came to me she realized that it was me. So I said, ‘my name is Martad’ and she said, ‘welcome.’ She then said, ‘come and sleep with me tonight.’ So she was calling him to the lewdness. So I said, ‘O Anaaq, indeed Allaah has made zina Haraam. Allaahu Akbar!’. So the Shaykh is saying look then brother Muslim may Allaah guide you and myself to success. Look at the Imaan that Martad had concerning Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala and how it prevented him from committing zina even though it was easy for him to commit that act. So may Allaah have mercy upon him and be pleased with him. Look how his complete turn around came for him after he was a committer of major sins and major evil deeds prior to his Islaam? Look how Islaam turned the whole direction of his life. And he became the best of the people as regards to him being chaste, as regards to him having adab, and with regards to him having taqwa.\n\nTherefore from the first of the things that we can utilize to protect ourselves from this sick disease, it is to have Imaan in Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala.\n\nAs for the second affair is that we make sincere tawbah to Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala for all of our sins. Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala has said, ‘and those who when they commit a sin or when they run themselves, they remember Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala and make isthighfar for their sins. And who will forgive sins other than Allaah as long as they do not persist upon that which they did while they know.’\n\nLikewise from the things that will protect ourselves and from the methods and means that have been laid down in the Shariah is that indeed Islaam is the deen of the fitrah and its way is the just way, balanced way.\n\nAnd it has affirmed for mankind that which he has established or that which he has within him a way of desire for sexual actions. But Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala has not made it absolute for him to utilize or enjoy his desire in any way that he pleases. And at the same time He has not prohibited him from enjoying sexual pleasures absolutely but rather it has reigns and orders for him that desire of his. And that sis with the connection of the link of marriage. Because when Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala created mankind, He created for him his wife so that he may receive tranquility from her.\n\nAllaah subhanahu wa ta’ala says, ‘and indeed from His signs is that He has created for you wives so that you may\n\nreceive tranquility and reside with them. And He has made between you love and He has made between you Mercy.’\n\nTherefore Allaah has made and prescribed marriage by way or which a person can increase in love and emotional feelings. And a way for him to protect himself from falling into evil deeds and lewd deeds. And for that reason Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) encouraged that we should marry.\n\nIn both Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim it is recorded that Ibn Mas’ud (radiallaahu anhu) that the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: ‘O gathering of youth, whosoever from amongst you is able then let him marry. Because it is better for the lowering of the gaze. And it is better as a protection of the private parts. And whosoever is not able to do so then let him fast, because then indeed it is a protection for him.’\n\nAnd likewise from the things that protect ones private parts (and things connected to that), that the method of protecting — – that men not mix with the women. Ibn Qayyim rahimahullah mentions in his book, ‘and there is no doubt that to let the women mix with the men is the origin of every evil. And it is from the greatest reasons for Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala revealing or sending upon the people punishments and likewise it is from the reason that the general and the specific affairs become corrupt. And the men mixing with the women is a reason for zina, fawahisha, lewdness and evil act connected to sexual related acts being committed between men and women. And it is from the reasons for diseases and plagues when the prostitutes began to mix with the army of Musa, and evil deeds and lewdness began to spread among them. Indeed Allaah sent upon them at that point plague and diseases and 70,000 people died as a result of that. And we ask Allaah that He protects us.\n\nAnd likewise from the protective reasons that has been laid down by the Shariah for the male Muslim and the female Muslim, that the women wear the hijaab and screen themselves from strange men. Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala says, ‘..and stay in your homes and do not display yourselves like the displaying of the days of Jaahiliyah’ and Allaah azzawajal says addressing his message to his Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) : ‘O Messenger, say to your wives, daughters and to the women from amongst the Muslimeen, that they should throw the jilbaabs over themselves, that is better for them not to be known or not to be recognized and they will not be harmed. And indeed Allaah is al- Ghaffoor ar-Raheem.’\n\nAnd likewise from the reasons is that a woman stays in her home and that she doesn’t leave her home except for a\n\npressing need. Allaah says in the previous ayah, ‘.. stay in your homes and do not display yourselves like the displaying of jaahiliyah. And you know O servants of Allaah, (O female slave of Allaah) that the Shaitaan who is the major enemy for us utilizes the issue of the women leaving out of their homes, using her as a means of corrupting the men and utilizing the men for corrupting her. And indeed the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) has said, ‘indeed the whole of the woman is an awrah. So if she leaves her home, then indeed the shaitaan beautifies her and makes her fall into some type of fitnah and attempts her to fall into some lowly deeds.\n\nAnd likewise from that a person distances himself from music as it is established with the people who have intellect that the beautiful voice has a direct effect upon the heart especially the heart of the woman. Music has an effect more on the woman than it has on the men. And if that music is accompanied with singing and with the playing of musical instruments, the effect that it has on the hearts in calling that person to lewdness is indeed greater. And for that reason Fudayl Ibn Iyyad rahimahullah mentioned that music is the ruqya of zina – meaning it is the thing that will lead towards it and will draw towards it.\n\nIndeed Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala says in the Qur’aan, ‘and indeed from the people of those who buy lahwal hadeed (meaning music here) in order to misguide from the path of Allaah and Ibn Masood radiallaahu anhu swore three times by Allaah regarding the tafseer concerning this ayah and the explanation of the lahwal hadeed that it is ghina, it is music and likewise from the reasons that protect ourselves from this lewdness will be mentioned in a summarized form so that we don’t spend too long here.\n\nThe first of them the Shaykh mentions is that a person both men and women lowers their gazes. Because the sight that it takes to look is from the arrows from the arrows of Iblees. And for that reason the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) explained, ‘that the first look that you take for a woman is for you i.e it is overlooked and the second one is against you. And that is because the first look that a person took was not intentional i.e he did not intentionally take that look of that woman. So Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala had mercy upon us and forgave us for that. And as for the second look then the mu’min the male and the female believer are both taken to account for that.\n\nLikewise, the woman should not perfume herself when she leaves from her house. Indeed Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) prohibited that. And likewise from the reasons that will protect the society from this is that a woman does not show her beautification or that which she wears underneath her jilbaab except to those individuals who are from her mahrim (Mahram) who are lawful from her relatives.Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala has said that she should not show anything of her beautification except that which is\n\napparent from her.\n\nAnd likewise from the reasons that will protect us bi-iznillaah that a woman does not enter in her speech i.e she does not go into too much depth with her speech and that she does not soften her speech to strange men. Whether that is upon the telephone or upon other than the telephone. And this is indeed from the greatest of reasons that leads to that evil. Because indeed if she is soft in her speech, then that one who has something from sickness from his heart , will enter into his heart to have something with her by way of evil actions or by way of adultery or fornication.\n\nAnd likewise from the reasons that we can protect, is that a person distances himself from intoxicants. Because indeed the khamr and the intoxicant are the mother of all evils. And by way a person would fall into zina and likewise it is a stealing and likewise it is a killing these souls that have been prohibited for us to kill. Rather a person would fall into every type of lowly act.\n\nAnd likewise from the things that will protect us is that we keep clear from touching in any way a strange woman except in extreme necessity. O Servants of Allaah, indeed when the believer believes in Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala there is no doubt that he is going to be tested and that he is going to be under trial. And for that reason Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala when he created the Jannah, He surrounded it with the distasteful things. It was surrounded by things that are distasteful like Jihaad because a person may possibly die and it is something that is difficult for a person.\n\nAnd likewise he wakes up at night at the time that it is very cold, and that you make wudhu and you pray. As for the tareeq or path to the Hellfire may Allaah protect us and you from it, is something that is easy iyaazu billaah. By doing those things that have connections with our desires like zina and drinking khamr and consuming wealth unlawfully and other than that from the evil act. Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala has said, ‘Alif Laam Meem, do the people believe that they are going to be left alone saying that we believe and that they will not be put under trial. Indeed we put to trial those who came before them and Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala will know those who were truthful in their Imaan and Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala will know by way of those that who are liars &ndash; the kaazibeen.nd likewise Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala has said, ‘do you believe that you are going to enter Jannah and it did not come to you that which came to those who came before you? They were struck with hardships and calamities and they were shook until the Messenger and those who believe along with him said, ‘when is the aid of Allaah going to come? Indeed the aid of Allaah is near.’\n\nSo you O my brother Muslim, and you O my sister Muslimah indeed you have chosen al-Islaam as your religion and this is the way of the anbiya alaihissalaatu wassalam and it is upon you that you remain firm upon the religion of Allaah and that you are not shaken in your Imaan and that you are not deceived by the duny and by its beautification and by Allaah you don’t know when you are going to die. And you don’t know when that thing that thing that stops all of one’s desires and stops all of one’s pain is going to end and going to come, so die while you are upon Islaam and while you are upon Imaan and while being in a state of being distant from the lewd deed and the evil deeds. ‘O Allaah make us to see the Haqq and bless us to follow it. O Allaah make us see the baathil and the falsehood and bless us to stay away from it. And do not make it something that is not clear to us, so that we go astray. O Allaah make the best of our deeds of the dunya the last of our deeds, and the best of our action the last of our actions and the last of our days the day that we meet you.’\n\n—\n\nMay Allaah reward the sister who Transcribed from the Audio\n\nShare this, Baarakallaah Feekum: [“One who guides to something good has a reward similar to that of its doer” - Saheeh Muslim vol.3, no.4665] [This website protects the copyrights of the authors/publishers.

Some hearts are so bad, and so ill that they see a good as a Munkar, (as an evil), and they see an evil as a good. These are not as they should be.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan. We need a Ramadhaan because our connection with Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala is not correct.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because we do not have any Khushoo or devotion in our Salaah.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because our Qura’an has dust and is sitting o­n a shelf.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because we never read the books of Sunnah.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because we don’t fast, and if we fast physically without food or drink, we don’t fast with our eyes by lowering them and our tongue by not slandering and our tongue by not lying and back-biting. We need a Ramadhaan to get ourselves back in order, to work for the Hereafter, to connect ourselves to Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because relationships brother to brother and sister to sister is in a miserable condition.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because we have bad thoughts about o­ne another.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because of dhulm, injustice to o­ne another.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because there is backbiting, there is envy, there is jealousy, and there is slander.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because we are despicable, because we are sick, because we are ill. (All these are diseases of the heart)\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because we don’t believe in the promise of Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala, or if we do, we do not implement it.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because it is time for us to change and become something better then we are now.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because that is the o­nly thing that is going to get us together…\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because we don’t have unity, there’s no brotherhood\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because there’s no respect for elders\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because there’s no real love between us\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan, full of love and the Mercy of Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala.\n\nA Ramadhaan like we come in, like in a clinic or a hospital, trying to solve our illnesses, trying to come out of there without the disease we came with, trying to be better than we went in with.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan. Look around you, look to your right, look to your left, look in front of you and look behind you and you’ll say, “We need a Ramadhaan”.\n\nThe sisters aren’t covering properly, we need a Ramadhaan. Brothers and sisters are mixing. We need a Ramadhaan. Talking o­n phones and o­n the internet, we need a Ramadhaan. This is a mess, we are in a fix, we are in a bind, and this is a problem… We need a Ramadhaan. We need a Ramadhaan to get ourselves together.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan, that we come in the Masjid and we face the Qiblah and we say “Allaahu Akbar” and we stand in qiyaamah a long time until those diseases, that filth, that sickness, that hardness the heart goes away.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan that reminds us of the Hell-fire. We need a Ramadhaan that tells us that we haven’t been given a certificate that we are people of Jannah.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan that lets us known that we are servants of Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala.\n\nAnd if we were to spend our whole life, from the time we were born until Yawm al Qiyaamah in Sajdaah, it would not be enough to thank Allaah for His Mercy, His Grace and His Blessings.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan and it is clear. If there is any fear of Allaah left in the hearts of ours and if there is any hope of Jannaah left in us, and if there is any desire to change and to be better and to be righteous and to come to the level of Ihsaan, to come to the level of a Mumim, to have taqwa, to fear Allaah … we need a Ramadhaan.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan, a month of Tawbaah.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan, a month of Maghfira.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan to correct our behaviour, to correct the differences & the difficulties and the envy / jealousies in our relationship between o­ne another.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan to understand that we have been committing injustice to o­ne another. And as the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said : ‘Az-Zulm (injustice) – “Zulumaat yawmal Qiyaamah” –we’ll be changed physically into darkness o­n the Day of Judgement.’\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan to understand the Hadith : to fear the duaa of the o­ne to whom we have done injustice. For there is not between Allaah and the person making the invocation, the person making that supplication of the person to whom injustice has been done, there is no veil between that person and Allaah. That duaa is immediately accepted.\n\nThe oppressor is the o­ne for whom things are not going right; He is tripping into this and falling into that; He is Slipping there and sliding here. Why I can’t get ahead? Why I can’t progress in my Deen? Why I can’t memorize this ayah? Why I can’t understand this hadeeth? We may be living under the invocation, the answer for invocation for someone whom we abused or stepped over. You know you need a Ramadhaan. I know I need a Ramadhaan. We know we need a Ramadhaan. We need to get ourselves together. We’ve been running around in filth, we have been having our hearts around the low matters; We need our hearts to be around the thrones of Allaah; We need to think about the high matters, high goals; We need to think about Jannah; We need a hope for al-Jannah.\n\nYou’re planning for marriage, you’re planning for education, you’re planning for a job, but we need to plan for the Jannah. We need to prepare for the Jannah during the month of Ramadhaan.\n\n“‘Nahnu be haajathin Ma’aasa fir Ramadhaan.”\n\nWe are in severe need for Ramadhaan, so that we come into Ramdhaan with repentance, we come into it with regret, we come into it realizing that we are weak, that we need Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala to correct us, realizing that we are wrong and that we need Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala to place upon us that which is right, realizing that we are weak and that we need Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala to grant us strength. We need a Ramadhaan. Oh Yes !! We need a Ramadhaan.\n\nWe needs nights of Qiyaam, we need dua and sujood, we need nights of Ramadhaan to do thilawaah of Qura’an. We need to listen to Husri, or Sudays or Shurain, or Hudhaifi. We need a Ramadhaan to listen to the Qura’an. When was the last time that we listened to the Qura’an?? When was the last time we recited Qura’an? We need a Ramadhaan to study Qura’an, to implement the Qura’an, and this Ramadhaan may be our final Ramadhaan. As o­ne brother spoke, I believe it is Abu Thasleem Hafidahullaah, where is the guarantee that this is not our final Ramadhaan? What is the guarantee that it is not our final Ramadhaan? We have to come into it seriously. And we want to come out of it much better than we came into it. We want to come out of Ramadhaan with Taqwa, because that was the main reason that it was legislated.\n\n“O you who believe fasting has been written upon you as it was written for those before you, so that you may gain Taqwa.”\n\nTaqwa is fear of Allaah. If we had taqwa, our condition will be better than it is now. If we had taqwa our relationships would be smoother, if we had taqwa …father to son who is a Muslim, sister to brother who is Muslim, uncle, aunt, niece and nephew who is Muslim, husband and wife who are Muslims.. the relationships would be better if they are based upon Taqwa. And we can achieve Taqwa during the month of Ramadhaan. I don’t believe that our hearts are that hard, I don’t believe that we can’t change, I don’t believe that some of us who hold hatred for the last 10 years cannot learn to love, and because we have been taught deceit and deception now we can’t learn to trust.\n\nI don’t believe that those brothers who have left circumstances physically but have the teachings and the behaviours that they had while they were up there, that they can’t change. The sisters who remove their bodies from the fitnah and physically remove their bodies from a mistake, physically remove their bodies from foolishness but their hearts have to follow. Be iznillaahi tha’aalah ! Their hearts have to follow.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan to be as the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) was. That he was the most generous, he was generous in general and he was most generous in Ramadhaan. Like a wind … spending, giving to his right, giving to his left, giving in front of him, giving behind him, giving to anyone who came. He gave without them asking.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan to inculcate these qualities. We need to control our desires. We need to control our tongue. We need to control our limbs. We need to learn self-discipline. We need to control our anger. We must do things in Ramadhaan not out of habit, something that is just tradition., that we are more despicable when we went in. We have to change our condition. We have to change our connection with Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala. For how light is the view of Allaah when they disobey Him. This is what was said by o­ne of the sahabas when he had the crown of the Persian King in his hand.\n\nAnd the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said, ‘that he had been sent before the hour. And my provision has been provided for me under the shade of my spear and humiliation has been written against anyone who goes against my orders. Humiliation has been written upon anyone who goes against my orders. If we want to continue in the position of humiliation that we are in, then do not take the grand opportunity act like it doesn’t exist, neglect and forget and be hard headed, be obstinate, follow your desires like you have been doing for the last 11 months and don’t benefit from Ramadhaan. And when our circumstances doesn’t change, when the Kuffar don’t remove their spears from our necks, when our women are consistently raped and they are now these days in many parts of the world, when all of that happens, don’t say “Why?” You know why. For we need a Ramadhaan and we have to correct ourselves in this Ramadhaan. And that you are a part of this Ummah and if you have an illness, and if you are a member of this ummah with a sickness, with filth, with crime, this affects the rest of the Ummah. It is like your body when you have an illness. It is like when you have hurt your finger or your toe, it affects the rest of the body. And it doesn’t have to be said to you that the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said, “the believers are like o­ne body”. If we want to correct the position of the Ummah, then we must first start by correcting ourselves. Don’t worry about Ubyaid, Hassan and Musa, but worry about yourself. Be selfish this Ramadhaan. Not regarding giving sadaqa but where you are going to focus your rectification or how to rectify yourself. Your focus is going to be o­n yourself. Not worrying about this person and that person’s manhaj. Are you o­n the correct Manhaj?? Not worrying about whether a particular brother is o­n the bidah or the Sunnah. Are you upon the Sunnah? Have those brothers stopped committing their sins — have you stopped committing that sin? Has the brother made tawbah —- Have you made tawbah?? Has the brother corrected a situation —– have you corrected your situation? Worry about yourself. Worry about yourself this Ramadhaan.\n\nAny other Ramadhaan do what you will. But my sincere advice to you is, this Ramadhaan worry about yourself. Am I backbiting? Am I slandering? Am I committing fahishah? Am I committing gheebah? Am I committing Nameemah (tale-carrying)? Do I have ‘hasad’? Do I have pride (Kibr) ? Am I arrogant? Am I too harsh? Am I unkind? Am I not gentle enough? Am I gentle enough? Question yourself. Was my intention when I said what I said or did what I did for the pleasure of Allaah or to be noticed? When I spoke what I spoke was it for the pleasure of Allaah or to be seen or heard? Was I doing it “Haarisa min Qalbi’— sincerely from my heart or I did it to be known? ‘Khutbath Duroor’ — Loving to be known breaks it.\n\nBe Mukhlis. Be sincere. Be like that servant of Allaah like the Hadith that has been related in the Kitaab al tawheed of the soldier whose head is disheveled, who is bare-footed and dirty.. but he is sincere to Allaah. If he was placed at the rear of the army, he is pleased with that. And if he is placed in the front of the army he is displeased with that. His goal is Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala. Not where I sit. Not us and them, Not you and I but his brothers and sisters ..its the servants of Allaah, it is the believers, it is the Muslim, the salafiyoon, it is Ahlul –athar, it is Ahlus-Sunnah, it is Ahlul-Hadith. No o­ne’ bigger and no o­ne is smaller . No o­ne wants to step o­n anyone nor desire that. All of us should be working for the pleasure of Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala. And if we don’t we have an illness which is Riyaah — doing things to be seen or Sum’aah — doing things to be heard and we need a Ramadhaan to correct that behaviour.\n\nIf we find that we talk to the sisters or brothers too much, we need a Ramadhaan to learn to stop talking to those who are not halaal for us to talk to. And if we find that we are mixing too much, we need a Ramadhaan to start mixing with those whom you are not supposed to mix with. We find that we have jealousy in our hearts, vengeance in our hearts, distrust in our hearts for other Muslims based upon nothing but Shaitaan whispers to us, we need a Ramadhaan.\n\nWe get all the good in front of us when we have the Book of Allaah tabarak wa ta’ala and the Sunnaah of the Messenger (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and the fahmas Salafus Saalih and the connection to the inheritors of the Prophet alaihissalaam – the Ulamaa – we got all the good in front of us but we are like that individual who has a disease and he has the prescription for the medicine in front of him but he refuses to open the package – let alone read it —– let alone take it.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan, Our condition won’t change. We’ll continue to complain.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan or we’ll forever be in pain. We need a Ramadhaan or we’ll go insane.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan, you and I. Why can’t we lift up, roll up our sleeves? Why do we have to beat the hands of o­ne another? Why do we have to step o­n somebody to get somewhere? Why do we have to step o­n our brother – he wants to go to the same place where you want to go? The Jannah. Why can’t we do it together? Why can’t we be side by side? You roll up your sleeves and I’ll roll up my sleeves, we’ll get busy and we’ll get help and support o­ne another.\n\nWhy can’t we make excuses? Why can’t we forgive? Why can’t we forget? Why can’t we let things go? Upon clarity, upon Haqq, knowing the Sunnah, knowing the Deen, connected to the scholars, not preceding them in any statement or action and if they make a statement, we make their statement (not add our own), This is important. We need a Ramadhaan.\n\nThis blessed month where you can go in as the most despicable devil and come out like an angel. That blessed month when you can go in as a miser and come out as the generous … that blessed month where you can be o­ne of those hard-hearted brothers – (everybody usually gives you a smile but you don’t give anybody a smile) – and if you do it right, you’ll come out of Ramadhaan giving smiles to those brothers , not in the faces of the sisters but the faces of your brothers..\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan to correct our condition : we are slow, we are lazy, we don’t have any incentive towards the deen and the Aakhiraah, the Hereafter . Our incentives are towards the Dunya and if the opposite of this was true most of the neighbourhood around here would be Muslims. Many would enter Islaam in folds, as Sheikh Ubaid Madkhali Hafidaallaah says in his explanation of ‘Usool as thalaathah’, that Islaam is a Mahaasin – the beauty of it is explained. Islaam he said is a Mu’jizaa minal Mu’jizaath’ — Islaam is a miracle of the Mircales. Ayah minal Ayaahs. It is that, when it is presented to the hearts, when it is presented to the people, and it is done in the right way, what happens? They enter Islaam ‘Afwaajan’ – in the multitudes.\n\nHe said that if o­ne of them has a business and we want to advertise, very few who wouldn’t advertise at all would say that “I have a business but I am going to be silent.” Business won’t be successful and no o­ne will benefit, he will loose. Generally a good business person gets a good advertisement – he may use the print media, he may use the radio, the audio media, to get his advertisement — his dawa’ah , he’ll call out so that people will come and he mixes in the most beautiful way and has the most beautiful response. This is what he does. The Sheikh said, ‘if we were to do that with Islaam, show its beauty, explain its Mahasin –its beauty, it is the natural fitrah of the person (unless his fitrah has been polluted) that he wants to know Islaam. He wants to know why he walks upon the earth. He wants to know his prayer. He wants to have his connection with his Creator. He wants to know the purpose of his existence. But who will explain it to him or her? Who will tell them? Who will open up those hearts? It is supposed to be ‘us’.\n\nThose of us who cannot express ourselves, what about our actions? If the person sees you are truthful , why you are truthful? Because Islaam teaches you truthfulness and you must be truthful and there is high martaba being truthful and minas-Siddeeqi is the o­nly martaba — level after the Prophets… It is the first level after the Prophets, rather. Closest to the prophet’s stations are those who are Siddiqeen, the most truthful. So you be truthful because of that. You keep your word because of that. You are gentle, you are nice, you have good behaviour, you have good etiquette, you have good deportment, so when it comes to Islaam it is Afwaajan. So if you don’t see them doing it, we are doing what we are not supposed to be doing. If we were doing what we are supposed to be doing, we would probably have to have this type of fundraising at o­ne of the football stadiums. If we are doing what we are supposed to be doing, people will be hearing Islaam from the radio, they will see articles written in the papers regularly, they would see good behaviour, they would see kindness and gentleness, patience and forbearance. They would see the qualities and characteristics of Mustapha sallallahu alaihi wassallam. i.e if we were doing our job. But we are not. Not the male or the female. Not father or mother or child. We are not upon what we should be upon, we are not doing what we are supposed to be doing.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan to clarify our situation. We need a Ramadhaan to put us in position. We need a Ramadhaan to give this Ummah a rebirth, air .. we have to understand that we are global. Whoever follows the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and the Manhaj of the Salafus Saalih, then they are our closest brothers. And those who are upon ignorance, innovation, not mukaffarah, they are still brothers from a distant but from within this Ummah. So it affects all of us. And we are connected in that way.\n\nIf you sit there saying, ‘I don’t care what they do to the Muslims in India doesn’t concern me; I don’t care if they bomb Afghanistan up the planet… I don’t care…. it has nothing to do with me …then you are a racist, a nationalist, you are not a Salafi. Because a Salafi concerns himself about this Ummah. Salafi at night thinks about this Ummah. Salafi cries in his salaah about the condition of this Ummah, he cries about all locally, he cries about their condition internationally. We need a Ramadhaan so that we can realize the Islaamic brotherhood again.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan because some of them never practiced brotherhood ever in their lives and may have been Muslims 50 years. We need a Ramadhaan so that the sisters learn sisterhood,\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan so that we can focus o­n the Aakhirah — Hereafter and we give Naseehah and advice to o­ne another that is of benefit and that our talking and our mixing is just not about the Dunya, and what you want to do in the Dunya and how you are gonna be in this Dunya.\n\nWe need a Ramadhaan so that people learn to inculcate in their children to be like Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq, Umar al-Khattab, Sa’ad abi Ibn Waqqas and like this. We need a Ramadhaan so that they can study knowledge. This Ummah needs another Bin Baaz, this Ummah needs another Al-Albani, this Ummah needs another Muqbil, this Ummah needs another Ibn Taimiyyah, this Ummah needs all of these and more. You are gonna tell me that none of them can come or no o­ne like them can from our families? None of them can come from us? Not everyone who comes from us have to be Goofi. Can’t our children speak the Arabic language at a young age? Can’t we put in the hands of our children books that will benefit the Ummah.. the same love the Kaafir have for Harry Potter and their imaginary books? Our hope is low. Our desire is low. We are supposed to be having high goals. We should be looking at our kids Abdullaah and Abdurrahman and saying : You might be Sheikh Naasir for this Ummah. We should be saying when listening to Sudaisi and Shuraim that it could be you leading the salaah in haram. We are supposed to be having high goals. But until we brush off the dust, the foolishness of the jaahiliyyah , the hastiness of the youth, the bad characteristics that we have, we have to get rid of them , we have to change our condition, we need aRamadhaan.\n\nWe need our Qiyaam at night, we need recitation of Qura’an, we need to sit together and talk together o­nly about the deen, not about the Dunya, we need to worry about our status in the Aakhirah, in the Hereafter. We need to wake up from our sleep. Wake up Oh Sleepy o­ne. !! our slumber has been too long. You got to wake up, take wudoo, get within the caravan of Mohamed Ibn Abdullah, Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq, Umar al-Khattab, Ibn Taimiyyah – you have to get with it. How long are we going to stay sick? How long are we going to be unsettled? How long are we going to have our problems? We need a Ramadhaan. And let this Ramadhaan be the o­ne where you come out of it better, come out of it committed, come out of it devoted, you come out of it with your head held high.

Sometimes these doors are called the door towards attaining sustenance or the means of sustenance.\n\nFrom the doors are :\n\n1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness in the Religion) : Allaah says, ‘and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.’ So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, a door from the doors of sustenance.\n\n2. Eemaan (Faith) : al-‘Eemaan is a door from the doors of relief of difficulty, a door from the doors towards attaining rizq (provision). ‘Eemaan in Allaah and his books, and his angels, the last day, qadr (divine decree), its good and it’s bad, the Qur’aan, the Rasool (Messenger), the pure prophetic Sunnah and what is contains.\n\n3. Taqwaa (Fear and consciousness of Allaah) : ‘And if the people of the towns had Taqwaa and had piety, certainly We would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth. But they belied the Messengers so We took them with punishment for what they used to earn..’ Whoever has Taqwaa of Allaah, Allaah provides for him from where he would never have expected, where his mind would never have though about. However, Taqwaa of Allaah provided these means for him and gave him ease.\n\n4. Tawakkal ilallaah (having trust in Allaah) : If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trust in Allaah, Allaah would have provided for you like the bird who goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full. Having trust in Allaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the job, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work with, however it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah.\n\n5. Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) : Not giving shukr decreases one’s good deeds, if you give thanks to Allaah, Allaah will increase you and Allaah does not go back on a promise. Always make your tongue used to giving thanks to Allaah, even a little. ‘Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful.’\n\n6. Dhikr (Acts of Obedience and Remembrance) : A person who remains upon the remembrance of Allaah will have a pleasant life, whoever turns away from remembrance will have a wretched life.\n\n7. Zakaat (Charity) : It is upon the Muslim to fear Allaah with Zakaat, it is from the five pillars of Islaam. Give Zakaat from the apparent and the non-apparent, from the jewellery and possessions.\n\n8. Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) : ‘Spending on one’s parents, family and companions. The angels make du’aa for the one who spends, that Allaah replenishes them, and another makes du’aa that the one who refrains from spending that his wealth is destroyed. Allaah says ‘whoever does even an atoms worth he will see it and whoever spends in the path of Allaah, Allaah will replace it’.\n\n9. Du’aa (Supplication) : Allaah says, ‘Call on Me and I will answer you’. Allaah orders us to supplicate; supplication should be made for one’s rizq. ‘O Allaah give us the good in this life and the hereafter and save us from the Fire’. The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say this du’aa.\n\n10. al-Birr (The Righteous) : A door from the doors of relief, ‘Verily the pious people will be in the paradise and the evil doers will be in the hellfire Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (Rahimahullaah) stated that this ayah refers to the dunyaa (worldly life), the barzakh (the period between death and the day of resurrection) and the Aakhirah (hereafter) contrary to what people comprehend.\n\n11. Material Means : The means from the material means are also from the means of sustenance but self-control must be observed, knowing that dependency is upon Allaah alone. It is merely a means by which you work. We Should say ‘O Allaah, this is the means by which you provide for me if it wasn’t for the fact that Allaah provided we wouldn’t have used it. When Maryam (alayhis-salaam) was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says ‘And shake the trunk of the date palm before you and it will provide ripe dates for you. We are not dervishes who do nothing, we work by the means but we do not go by means which are unlegislated by Allaah. Many of those who are obsessed with their means fall to diabetes and Cancer, their minds obsessed with their work.\n\n12. Holding Fast to the Book and the Sunnah : And if only they had established the Toraah and the Injeel, they would have eaten from above them and under their feet.’ If this is in regards to those who should have held on to the scriptures then it is pivotal to hold on to the book and the Sunnah. We have mentioned 11 of which are abstract and now we mention the last which is physical.\n\nAfter the Khutbatul Haajah the Sheikh mentions our subject tonight deals with: The means of getting sustenance and the doors towards sustenance. This subject in which everyone likes it, however many of them went wrong in the way of going about it. So, the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards attaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qura’an and of the Messenger has mentioned and carried those legislated means out he would have gained what has been promised to him. And sometimes these means are called ‘Abwaabur Rizq’ or ‘Abwaabul Furaj’ i.e doors towards relaxation and relief or if you wish to say ‘Abwaabul Rizq’ – doors towards obtaining sustenance or if you wish then say ‘Asbaabur Rizq’ i.e the means of sustenance. So the first means insha-Allaah (the students of knowledge should write these down in the notebooks with the proofs which we will mention from the Qura’an and the Sunnah). The Sheikh continues with the first door of means is :\n\n1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness on the Deen of Allaah) : Al-Istiqaamah of the Deen is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from the means of sustenance. Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says,\n\n‘and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.’\n\nSo Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly without increasing in them or taking away from them, this is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from its means. On the contrary it is from the greatest means of Rizq in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. And if you knew the following means you would have known how much the people had gone away from them these days except whom Allaah has had mercy on. They want Rizq but they went wrong in the ways of attaining it and the doors towards it and its means except who Allaah has had mercy on them and they are very few. Even to the point where it might come to the thought of a person that if he wants rizq all he has to do is engross himself in pursuing the dunya and leave off the ‘Asbaab-al-Shar’eeah’ – (that is the means designated by the Shariah). So he doesn’t find except adverse hardship and you ofcourse know what rain has of benefits for the Ummah. The Sheikh mentions the ayah in Surahtul Anbiah :\n\n‘We made all things living from water.’\n\nWhen rain comes, i.e the rain that has the mercy of Allaah with it, all of the good in turn comes – the earth vegetates fruits and various herbs and waters in rivers become plentiful and the cattle and the riding beasts benefit and the good of humans and animals become abundant and agriculture becomes successful and ghee and honey becomes abundant, and sheep, cattle becomes abundant and the market prices become lower. And even the heat it gets lowered a great deal from the people. The Sheikh mentions the ayah again :\n\n‘and if only they had Istiqaamah on the right path, We would have given them water (rain) from the sky in abundance.’\n\nAnd Istiqaamah as you know as Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says :\n\n‘That is verily those who say, “Our Lord is Allaah, then they have Istiqaamah, the angels descend upon them saying, ‘have no fear and do not be sad and have good tidings of Jannah (Paradise) that you have been promised. We are your protecting friends in the Dunya and in the Aakhirah. ‘\n\nAnd whomsoever has Allaah as his wali or his protecting friend and has the angels as his awliyaah, his protecting friends, will Allaah leave that person to be by himself without any protection? Whoever thinks that Allaah will let go to waste his awliyaah, the ones that are close to Him, that hold firm to the Book and the Sunnah – then he has thought negatively about Allaah. So, the first door from the doors of rizq is Istiqaamah upon the Deen. And visualize the time that the people were Mustaqeemeen – when they had Istiqaamah upon the Book and the Sunnah.\n\nIbn Qayyim (rahimahullah) he mentioned in his book ‘Zaad al-Maad’ that he found a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. The Sheikh reiterates : a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. And a cucumber the length of it being such and such … This is barakah from Allaah. So then Istiqaamah would probably lead to having a tomato that would need two people to hold it, a water melon which needs 5 or 6 people to hold it – i.e if there is present holding to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah, no bid’ah, no khurafaath (superstitions & folklore), no sheer foolishness, no magic, no taking of intoxicants, no ribaa and no zinaa, no ‘liwaath’ — no sodomy and no lying and no fujoor – witness evil doing and no ‘shahaadatuz zoor’ — bearing witness to falsehood, and no wicked oath and not putting off of the prayers.\n\nWith Istiqaamah there will be present an abundance of good by the permission of Allaah. Our forefathers mentioned to us (May Allaah forgive us and them and all the Muslims) that they used to sell a young sheep for a Riyal. So, they eat its meat and sell its skin for a Riyal. So he slaughters it, he eats it with his family, his neighbours and whoever comes and at the end of it he sells the skin for a Riyal. He didn’t lose anything. So Isthiqaamah its affair is great in this Dunya and Aakhirah, in your Deen and dunya and in your Barzaakh, in your Aakhirah if you held on to the Kitaab and the Sunnah.\n\nAnd the second means is Eemaan and Taqwa : i.e the second and third. Now we have three means, Eemaan and Taqwa. As Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says :\n\n”And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwaa or piety, certainly We would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth. But they belied or denied the Messengers so We took them with punishment for what they used to earn. Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep? Or did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing? Did they then feel secure against the plan of Allaah? None feels secure from the plan of Allaah except the people who are losers.’\n\nThe first three means he returns he says with the ayah : walaw anna ahlal Qura ..’ and ‘Qura’ here encompasses al-Qura wal Mudah. i.e the word Qura means villages and he says this ayah encompasses both villages and cities. And Makkah is the Ummul Qura as you know. This is not specific to villages but on the contrary villages, cities and all. He repeats the ayah :\n\n‘If only the people of the cities had believed and had taqwa, We would have opened for them the blessings from the heavens and the earth.’\n\nHenceforth al-‘Eemaan is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty, and a door from the doors towards attaining rizq (provision) and a means from the means Rizq. ‘Eemaan in Allaah and His Books, and His angels, the Last Day and in Qadr (Divine decree), its good and its bad, the belief or Eemaan in the Qur’aan and in what the Qur’aan contains, Eemaan in the Rasool (Messenger) and what he came with from Allaah, Eemaan in the pure prophetic Sunnah and what it contains.\n\n‘If they believed and had piety, We would have opened up for them the blessings from the heavens and the earth.’\n\nAnd as He said (subhana wa ta’ala) :\n\n‘And whoever has Taqwaa of Allaah, Allaah makes for him a way out and provides for him from where he would not expect.’\n\nThe Sheikh reiterates that ‘He would have provided for him from where he never would have expected – from where his mind would never have thought about it. And hence not expecting that he would find this prepared blessing, the blessed sustenance from this source. However, taqwa of Allaah prepared for him these different ways and made ease for him the means.’\n\nThe Sheikh reiterates: ‘He would make for him a way out and provide for him from where he would not expect.’\n\nWe want rizq. However we lost gaining it by its legislated ways except whom Allaah has had mercy on. Rizq by lying and playing and zig zagging, stealing and deceit, evil plotting : ‘O people’ the Sheikh implores : Is this the way to get rizq? You are right now spreading up the establishment, you are right now speeding up the establishment of punishment on yourself and torment if you disobey Allaah. Therefore why not hold onto the deen and have glad tidings of good and have glad tidings of relief from hardship?\n\nSo right now we have three doors : Al-Istiqaamah, al-Eemaan and Taqwa.\n\nThe fourth door is : Tawakkal alallaah (having trust in Allaah) : The Prophet said, (as recorded in Tirmidhi & Ahmad) ‘If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, Allaah would provide for you just like he provides for the birds. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full.’\n\nAt-tawakkal alallaah – ‘having trust in alAllaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the bag, not on the job or employment, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the farm, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work. It is nothing more than a means. However it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah and to trust in Allaah.\n\nHe alahis-salaatu wassalaam, you have heard him say : If you put your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, He would have sustained or provided for you as He provides for the birds. That is the rizq or the sustenance of the bird is easy. i.e the sustenance of the bird is very easy. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening satisfied with their bellies filled not with difficulty. It gets its rights with ease and then returns and birds are of many types. Take notice. Some of those birds are those that are big and don’t eat except meat. And Allaah azzawajal gives it meat. And every bird takes what Allaah has decreed for it. And no one enumerates it except Allaah and the amount that no one can enumerate except Allaah and their sustenance is due upon Allaah. i.e He will sustain it. And He mentions the ayah :\n\n‘And so many a moving creature carries not its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you.’\n\n‘And there is no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah and He knows its dwelling and its deposit i.e in the uterus or in the grave. All is in a clear Book.’\n\nHe is talking about the ‘Lawh al Mahfudh’ — the Book of Decree which is with Allaah.\n\n‘ We have not created the Jinn and the mankind except that they should worship Me. I do not want from them sustenance nor do I want them to feed Me. Verily Allaah is the One that provides. He is the Owner of Power and Strong.’\n\n‘In the sky is your sustenance and what you are promised and by the Lord of the sky or the Heavens and the earth, verily it is the truth just like it is the truth that you can speak. Verily it is the truth that Allaah is Ar-Razzaak and your rizk is with Allaah and it is written for you and that is coming to you and there is no doubt about it.’\n\nAnd the Sheikh reiterates : Verily by the Lord of the Heavens and the earth, it is true, just like it is true that you can speak. However where is the Eemaan in the Book and the Sunnah these days? Where is the one who wholeheartedly believes in the word of Allaah and the words of the Rasool alaisalaathu wassalaam and who is aware and feels the power of Eemaan and the power of tawakkal alallaah? And Tawakkal alallaah does not mean that you don’t work with the means. No, you carry out the means. However, you don’t depend totally on the means. You carry out the means. However you depend upon the ‘Musabbibul Asbaab’ – the One that makes the means and actually from above. He is Allaah. Look at the bird – it carries out the means; it went out hungry and returns satisfied. So it carried out the means. It flew and moved from tree to tree, and from place to place with comfort and received its sustenance and then it returns. So you also carry out the means in a way that i"
