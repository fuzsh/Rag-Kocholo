        "text": "Advice on Living a Healthy Life : https://www.instagram.com/p/BSRWeYTjBqY/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nMany Muslims in today’s day and age (exists usually in young Muslims) go through stress and depression. Firstly, the best way to avoid stress and depression is remembering Allah and developing a relationship with him:\n\nالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۗ أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ {29} ‘Those who believe, and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Aye! it is in the remembrance of Allah that hearts can find comfort;(13:29)\n\nAccording to Qur’an and ahadith true believers go through trials and some trials are extremely tough which we cannot deny. However, Allah Also tells us that after hardship there is ease, and in fact Allah repeats this twice. Furthermore, Allah Tells the believers to always remain patient and deal with trials with prayer and patience. To find true comfort pray in congregation, read the Qur’an, read the ahadith and read the books of the Messiah(as) and his Khulafa as well. Lose yourself completely in Allah. Stay away from what is bothering you and focus on the good things in life and thank Allah as Allah States:\n\nAnd remember also the time when your Lord declared, ‘If you are grateful, I will, surely, bestow more favours on you; but if you are ungrateful, then know that My punishment is severe indeed.’ (14:8)\n\nAnother tip is to join the gym or involve yourself in some physical activity every single day. This can include running, horse riding, sports and physical weight lifting. Eat healthy and enough fruits and vegetables. Less junk food. The Prophet(saw) taught us not to eat too much and to have a balance. He more meals but smaller portions. The Prophet(saw) said : “A strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than a weak believer” (In terms of Physical strength)\n\nThe Holy Prophet(saw) had the strength of 20 horses and the Promised Messiah(as) had the strength of 8 horses (Not literal but shows how strong they were). Now I will post a reference of Hadhrat Musleh Maud(ra) which inspired me to work much harder in the gym and change my lifestyle and I promise you it makes life so much better. He(ra) stated: “It is the duty of Khuddamul Ahmadiyya that they stop and shun all such activities which result in wasting one’s physical and cerebral faculties. Sports are NOT a waste of time. I once saw in a dream a man telling me about another person, that he wastes his time in exercising. I replied that this was not a waste of time. When someone does not look after his health, he cannot fully participate in serving his faith. The Almighty Allah taught me a lesson through this dream as I was negligent about taking exercise. Exercising is also an (important) task! The Promised Messiah(as) used to lift weights. A year or two before his demise, he asked me to find some weights because he was feeling worn out. I sourced the equipment from someone. The Promised Messiah(as) exercised or a few days and also taught me how to use the apparatus in order to derive maximum benefit. Therefore, exercising should be part of one’s routine. Wandering the streets aimlessly, indulging in conversations or debates (of useless topics) while sitting indolently are all a waste of time. It is the duty of Khuddamul Ahmadiyya to remedy (these ill habits). If you preach to the world, but leave Ahmadi children trapped in idle activities, all your efforts will be in vain” (Mash’ale Raah, Volume 1, Page 109) (This is not just for khuddam rather the message is for everyone)\n\nThe Prophet(saw) and his khulafa also taught us to exercise. It is stated in a hadith:\n\nNarrated Aisha, Ummul Mu’minin:\n\nwhile she was on a journey along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): I had a race with him (the Prophet) and I outstripped him on my feet. When I became fleshy, (again) I had a race with him (the Prophet) and he outstripped me. He said: This is for that outstripping.(Abi Dawud #2578)\n\nDo not make the excuse that you have no time. If the Khalifa of Islam in today’s day and age (who is more busy in serving Islam more than all of us combined times a million) has time to exercise and stay healthy how can we make any excuse? May Allah help these words keep us all away from any sort of stress and improve our physical condition as well, ameen!\n\nTrial or Punishment: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bds946GnrCn/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nOne question which always comes to mind of many is “Am I being trialed, or is this a punishment from Allah?”\n\n–\n\nWe will take this step by step, and end off with quotes of Hadhrat Ahmad(as). This answer will also contain Qur’an and ahadith. Firstly, there are trials, punishments and also accidental events. The natural phenomenon of calamities include earthquakes, floods, abundance of rain, lack of rain, or disease in general. Hadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) used to teach us that every natural disaster is not a divine punishment, however some natural disasters may be divine punishments. –\n\nWhen earthquakes take place, or people drown, or accidents occur, all are natural disasters where a person’s actions may be involved. However, there are other disasters where a person has no control which include floods, hurricanes, tornados, etc. However, when they are employed by God for a punishment, they behave in a different manner. They begin to pick and choose whom they want to kill, and whom they would like to spare. They are like other disasters in appearance, but much difference in their outcome. For example what happened at the time of Prophet Noah(as), what happened to Pharoah and his followers? What happened to those who opposed the Promised Messiah(as) and went to the highest extent of extreme mockery? They are natural disasters but prophesied. Same way accidents take place like that of ZIa ul Haq. However, just four days before, Khalifa Rabai(rh) was told by Allah that he will be destroyed. Before the next Friday, his plane was blown up. Nobody detected any fault with the plane or that it was an organized murder. That was clearly a punishment on Zia ul Haq from Allah, and was foretold.\n\n–\n\nProphets are sent by Allah to give glad tidings but also to warn the people. Mankind has the choice to listen, and based on the reaction of the people, Allah Decides whether He will Punish or Save. We must remember that Allah is All Forgiving and All Merciful. He makes it clear that He is Slow in punishment. Allah Gives every chance for reformation and also explains that I do not punish, unless a messenger is sent. Hadhrat Ahmad(as) has also explained that the rejection of a Prophet on its own does not cause divine punishment rather that is dealt with on the Day of Judgement. However, when rejection combines with persecution, abuse, and the enemies of the Prophet put obstacles in the way of the Prophet, then the wrath of Allah descends on the people. –\n\nIf we are close to Allah, we pray, we accept his prophets, and follow Islam then it is obvious that we will be tested. The Prophet(saw) stated:\n\n“Indeed greater reward comes with greater trial. And indeed, when Allah loves a people He subjects them to trials, so whoever is content, then for him is pleasure, and whoever is discontent, then for him is wrath.” (Tirmidhi)\n\n–\n\nAnd: “O Messenger of Allah(s.a.w)! Which of the people is tried most severely?” He said: “The Prophets, then those nearest to them, then those nearest to them. A man is tried according to his religion; if he is firm in his religion, then his trials are more severe, and if he is frail in his religion, then he is tried according to the strength of his religion. The servant shall continue to be tried until he is left walking upon the earth without any sins.” (Tirmidhi)\n\n–\n\nThis hadith beautifully explains it. We are tested and our tests help us get even more closer to Allah. If we are being tested, we should use that to gain the pleasure of Allah even more.\n\nAllah also states in the Qur’an:\n\n“And whatever misfortune befalls you, is due to what your own hands have wrought. And He forgives many of your sins” (Chapter 42 Verse 31)\n\nHadhrat Ahmad(as) explained that if we are not being tested we should be worried, because it means we have moved so far away from Allah that He has forgotten us.\n\n–\n\nDuring the fire which happened in Baitul Futuh a while back, Hadhur (aba) beautifully explained in his khutba:\n\nTribulations should not be considered bad. One who considers tribulations as bad is not a true believer. Allah the Exalted states: ‘And We will try you with something of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth and lives, and fruits; but give glad tidings to the patient, Who, when a misfortune overtakes them, say, ‘Surely, to Allah we belong and to Him shall we return.’ When such difficulties descend on Prophets of God they bring them glad-tidings of blessings and when the same difficulties descend on the wicked they ruin them.\n\n• Some people allege that Allah the Exalted does not listen to their prayers or people are critical of saints that their such and such prayer was not accepted. In fact these people are foolish and unaware of Divine laws. Anyone who has experienced such a thing will be fully aware of the principle that Allah the Exalted has presented two aspects whereby He listens and also has Him listened to.\n\n–\n\n• The Promised Messiah(as) has said that those who are patient are blessed. Patience does not mean one is not saddened at a loss. It means one does not let it get the better of one and lose one’s senses in the process. It is OK to be saddened but this should be followed by a renewed resolve to better one’s practices more than ever. It should also be remembered that only those who are patient know the realities of prayer.\n\nOne thing we must remember is that we are Ahmadi Muslims and have a long life ahead of us. We are the last Jamaat of God and have such a heavy load on us in regards to defending Islam and protecting the honour of the Prophets. I pray that Allah helps us throughout our trials and never forgets about any of us, and that through the trials we face we get even closer to him ameen.\n\nThe True Meaning of Love for All Hatred for None: https://www.instagram.com/p/BWyyDN-B9Bc/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nMany often misunderstand the concept of Love in Islam. Firstly we must understand that there is a difference in loving and loving in the sense of having compassion for the people, and wanting them to be guided. For example Allah States in the Qur’an in regards to the Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw):\n\nفَلَعَلَّكَ بَاخِعٌ نَفْسَكَ عَلَىٰ آثَارِهِمْ إِنْ لَمْ يُؤْمِنُوا بِهَٰذَا الْحَدِيثِ أَسَفًا\n\nSo haply thou wilt grieve thyself to death for sorrow after them if they believe not in this discourse. (18:6)\n\nHadhrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad (ra) stated: “The holy Prophet’s solicitude and concern for the spiritual well being of these people and his deep grief over their opposition to truth had almost killed him. But such is human ingratitude that from the very people for whom he felt and grieved so much, he received nothing but abuse, invective and ridicule. Never, indeed, were selfless love and kindness so ill requited!” Hadhrat Ahmad (as) beautifully explained “The Reality of Love” :\n\n“The fourth objection is that Islamic teaching never enjoins love for the followers of other religions; it only enjoins love for Muslims.\n\nIn reply, let it be clear that all this is the unfortunate outcome of the New Testament which is neither complete nor perfect, and because of which Christians digressed from the truth and reality. If one reflects deeply on what love is, when it should be exercised, and what hatred is and when it should be exercised, then not only does one comprehend the true philosophy of the Holy Qur’an, but the soul also achieves the perfect light of true understanding.\n\nRemember, love is not pretence or affectation. It is one of the human faculties. The essence of love is to have sincerity for something and to be drawn irresistibly towards it. Just as the real characteristics of an object are only truly perceived when it reaches perfection, the same is the case with love, in that its qualities are openly revealed when it is extreme and reaches perfection. Referring to this, Allah the Almighty says:\n\nوَأُشْرِبُوا فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْعِجْلَ\n\nThat is ‘They loved the calf as if their hearts were permeated with it’ (2:194)\n\nIn point of fact, when a person falls in love with someone and his love is total, it becomes his food and his drink, as it were. Indeed he takes on the complexion of the character and lifestyle of the beloved. The greater the love, the more a person is involuntarily drawn towards the qualities of the loved one, so much so, that he becomes his very reflection. That is why, consistent with his capacity a person who loves God acquires, metaphorically speaking, God’s light. Similarly, those who love Satan acquire the darkness which belongs to Satan. This being the reality of love, how can a true Scripture, which is from God, even permit that you should love Satan as you love God, or love the successors of Satan the way you ought to love the successors of the Gracious One.\n\nHadhrat Ahmad(as) further stated:\n\n“In short, the true meaning of the Qur’anic teaching is that love, which in reality means to reflect in one’s person the qualities of the beloved, is not permissible except for God Almighty and for the righteous ones. Indeed it is strictly forbidden for all others. For instance, the Holy Qur’an says:\n\n‘And those who believe are stronger in their love for Allah.’—AlBaqarah, 2:166\n\nIt also says:\n\n‘O ye who believe! take not the Jews and the Christians for friends.’—Al-Ma’idah, 5:52\n\nAnd:\n\nO ye who believe! take not others than your own people as intimate friends.’—Al-e-‘Imran, 3:119\n\nThat is to say, do not love the Jews and Christians, nor those who are not righteous.\n\nReading these verses, the uninformed Christians are misled. They think that Muslims are enjoined not to love Christians and other non-believers, but they do not realize that every word is used with reference to the context. What constitutes love can be entertained for evildoers and the disbelievers only when one partakes of their disbelief and impiety. Ignorant indeed would be the person who enjoined love for the enemies of his faith. We have pointed out several times that love means to look with pleasure on words, actions, habits, morals and faith of the beloved, to be pleased with them, and to accept his influence. But this is not possible on the part of a believer with regard to a disbeliever.\n\nA believer will, however, have compassion for the disbeliever and will have full sympathy for him and will seek to help him in his physical and spiritual ailments. Allah the Almighty has repeatedly admonished that we should have sympathy for people regardless of their religion, should feed the hungry, procure freedom for slaves, pay off the debts of those burdened with them, and have true sympathy for the whole of mankind. He says:\n\n‘God commands you to be just or, even more than just, to be benevolent like a mother to her child, or like a person who is kind to another because of the feelings of kinship.’ Al-Nahl, 16:91\n\nAnd:\n\nThat is: ‘The fact that Allah forbids you from loving the Christians and others should not be taken to mean that He forbids you from doing good or showing compassion and sympathy. No. Be compassionate, sympathetic and just to those who have not fought to kill you, nor have they driven you out of your homes, whether they are Jews or Christians, for Allah loves the people who do so.\n\nAnd:\n\nThat is: ‘Allah forbids you from being friendly and intimate with only those who have waged religious wars against you and have driven you out of your homes, and have aided others in driving you out of your homes. Friendship with them is forbidden, because they are bent upon destroying your faith.’\n\nahmadianswersIt is worth remembering that the reality of friendship is sympathy and well wishing. A believer can, therefore, have friendship, sympathy and goodwill for Christians, Jews, and Hindus and can exercise benevolence towards them, but cannot love them. This is a fine distinction, which should always be kept in mind. (Nur-ul-Qur’an part 2, Ruhani Khazain, Volume 9, Pages 429-436)\n\nThe true love is only for the believers, however love from a compassionate sense is an obligation upon every Muslim. The love spoken here by Promised Messiah(as) is true love, which is obviously only for the believers. But as we showed above with the Qur’anic ayah, the love of compassion and love of wanting everyone guided is a key quality of every believer.\n\nHadhrat Ahmadas spoke about general love of compassion many times in the same way Allah describes the compassion of Hadhrat Muhammad (saw). Hadhrat Ahmad (as) stated: ‘I would like to make it known to all Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Aryas that I have no enemy in the world. I love mankind as dearly as an affectionate mother loves her children, nay, even more. I am the enemy only of false beliefs and doctrines which undermine truth.’\n\nThis further makes the issue much clearer, and reading this a couple of times can help us understand the more difficult questions of loving people who are committing different types of sins.\n\nSomeone asked Hadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) in regards to the Palestinian Issue and said that he had entered the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and that he is very happy about it. However, he asked about Love for All Hatred for None and what was happening in Palestine and said he cannot accept that love for all, hatred for none is hard to accept because of what is happening in the Palestinian issue. He asked Hadhur (aba) if he should love them or pray for their destruction.\n\nHadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad (rh) stated:”I think I agree with you that this noble action is not for everyone to follow. We must follow the truth. Some of us cannot suppress our hatred against evil, and as such they are forgiven and excused and there should not be any artificiality in Ahmadi sentiments. Just because its our slogan and we write it large on walls, does not mean we change our nature and become false. I am really happy to hear from you and that you are not a false person. You are true and will remain true In sha Allah. The point is that you should not hate those, anybody, just because of racial differences, religious differences, and for any general view but personally if somebody is evil, and you know they are evil, I don’t think anybody can help hating him. What man hates is evil. If somebody commits a really really grave crime against a poor innocent child, I don’t know how an Ahmadi can love him and say “Love for All Hatred for None”. So you should understand the message. It does not mean you must love satan or evil personified. What it means is initially this is our attitude to everybody. The whole mankind this is our message. We are here to love you not to hate. But if somebody behaves in a manner that is impossible for us to continue to love him then he must be forgiven, I mean this is true. Sometimes I myself find it very difficult to, not to hate some mullahs when they commit cruelties against Ahmadis and I am deeply cut too, and it is impossible for me then to withhold myself and say I love you Mullah. Go on doing it, its impossible. All I say is be true and honestly try, again I say, honestly try to love everyone. But where you can’t, you can’t help it”\n\nHadhrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad(aba) stated in regards to love of compassion:\n\n“We use this slogan to signify that the members of the Ahmadiyya Jamā‘at do not bear grudge or ill-will towards anyone, and that Islām teaches us to love others, treat them with due respect and serve them. The slogan also signifies that we wish to live together by breaking down the walls of hatred. Indeed, when we serve humanity or propagate the message of Islām to the world, we do so because we love our fellow beings and want to root out the seeds of hatred from the hearts of the people and plant the seeds of love and harmony instead.”\n\n“The humanitarian work we do and the propagation of message of love and compassion we carry out is to earn the pleasure of God and to establish His Unity in the world. We have ill-will towards none in the world. We only hate evil and evil is to be condemned by everyone alike. We are even sympathetic to those who are involved in evil acts, but in this case our sympathy is based on the fact that we want to bring such people out of the filth they live in, so that we may help them save themselves from Divine punishment. Hence, we must not raise slogans like ‘love for all, hatred for none’ to ingratiate ourselves with the world, but rather to further the cause of true Islām, which is to establish peace and harmony in the world.”\n\nPraying to the Dead: https://www.instagram.com/p/BXiXzjnBbVT/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nHadhrat Ahmad(as) was asked if it was good to say “O Abdul Qadir Jilani, give us something for God’s sake” Hadhur replied in the negative.\n\nOn hearing Hadhurs reply, someone said: The Holy Qur’an says that those who are killed in the way of Allah should not be taken as dead people, for, they are alive. Hadhur replied: “This does not prove that they can hear your voice. Do you think that the people who are living in Batala (at a distance of eleven miles from Qadian) can hear you if you say something to them, here (in Qadian); will they answer you? Not at all. If you call a dead person he also will not answer you. That shows that he does not hear. Go to Baghdad and visit the tomb of Sheikh Abdul Qadir; call him and see if he answers you. of course if you call God with a sincere heart, you will receive a reply from Him. If the dead lying in the grave can also hear the voices, come along and prove it.\n\nThe questioner again said: God says in the Holy Qur’an: Rather, they are alive in the presence of their God. The questioner was told: Of course, God says that they are alive in his presence, not in your presence. This life of their does not necessarily show that they can hear and they are really present. We are alive but we cannot hear a voice from Lahore (a distance of about seventy miles). If they can hear and accept the prayers of the people who pray to them, then, tell me what is the difference between them and God the Almighty. It is a matter of shame. Do you think that the Holy Prophet(saw) is lower in rank that Sheikh Abdul Qadir, that this power is not attributed to him? Why don’t the people say: O Abu Bakr, or O Umar. Just to pick up one person and to pray to him that he should give them something, is nothing less than associating others with God. Islam was ushered into the world to establish the Oneness of God. If Sheikh Abdul Qadir had communion with God, it was through the concept of Oneness of God. Had he called on someone other than God, he would have been thrown away from the nearness of God. He got the rank, that he got, through the perfect obedience to God the Almighty. (Al Hakam, March 10, 1904)\n\nAlcohol in Medicine: https://www.instagram.com/p/BXn-u2GhVP2/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nIf alcohol is forbidden, why do we use it for medicinal purposes?\n\nIn Islam, alcoholic drink that can cause intoxication are forbidden, but alcohol is not forbidden in and of itself.\n\nWine has been forbidden in the Holy Qur’an, “O ye who believe! wine and the game of hazard and idols and divining arrows are only an abomination of Satan’s handiwork. So shun each one of them that you may prosper.” (5:91) When asked about preparing wine as medicine, the Holy Prophet (sa) said: “It is no medicine, but an ailment.” (Muslim) Also, consuming wine in any quantity is forbidden. The Holy Prophet (sa) said, “If a large amount of anything causes intoxication, a small amount of it is prohibited.” (Nasai, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah)\n\nHowever, this Hadith also teaches us that if a large amount of a drink cannot cause intoxication, then there is no reason for it to be prohibited even if it does have some alcohol in it. Hazrat Khalifa Rabi (rh) said , “Excess of any substance which may intoxicate you, even the small quantity of that substance is forbidden … As far as those food preparations are concerned where alcohol is applied and burned, there this principle of excessive use does not apply at all, because if alcohol is burned after adding to some food, even if you eat tons of that food, you can never become intoxicated. So you can become a mullah and very narrow-minded of course as you please, but, as far as the principles are concerned, they’re not applicable. That is why the Prophet (sa) permitted the use of Nabidh. Nabidh was also a food, it was not a medicine. A drink prepared from sometimes dates, and sometimes barks of trees, mixed in water, it was permitted to be buried in the ground over night, and if you drank it fresh after that, if you drank it in enough quantities to quench your thirst, it would quench the thirst but still would not intoxicate you. So it was not possible to use it as an alcoholic drink. But if it was permitted to stay longer than that, then the amount of alcohol which would have been found in it would exceed this limit. So Sahaba used to drink this drink in which elements of alcohol were definitely found.” (@ 46:10 http://www.alislam.org/v/2430.html)\n\nIn Sahih Muslim, under the chapter on “The permissibility of Nabidh so long as it has not become strong and has not become intoxicating”, “Ibn ‘Abbas reported that Nabidh was prepared for Allah’s Messenger (sa) in the beginning of the night and he would drink it in the morning and the following night and the following day and the night after that up to the afternoon. If anything was left out of that he gave it to his servant, or gave orders for it to be poured out.” Hazrat Khalifa Rabi (rh) said, “That is what I am saying to those extremists who say that if a food is touched even by a very minute amount of alcohol it becomes forbidden in Islam. I say the Holy Prophet (sa) knew Islam better than anyone, why did he (sa) permit the use of this drink in which now the experiments have revealed traces of alcohol are certainly found. Because of the same principle, you generally can’t drink it enough to make you intoxica(ted). It may burst your stomachs apart, but it would not be able to intoxicate you in the quantities you can consume. So, can you eat such cakes enough, on which alcohol has been poured and burnt out, so that you become intoxicated? Even if you eat tons of such cakes, you can’t.”\n\nThat is why the Holy Prophet (sa) said, “All drinks that intoxicate are unlawful.” (Bukhari) Consuming alcohol is not unlawful in and of itself. Only those drinks are unlawful that can intoxicate, but a drink that cannot intoxicate is lawful even if it does have some amount of alcohol in it. For example, a person cannot become intoxicated from drinking cough syrup because the quantity of medicine in it will kill the person before the quantity of alcohol in it can intoxicate him. The same applies to Nabidh or any similar food or drink.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that we should consume food or beverages that have alcohol in them. Rather, the teaching of the Holy Prophet ’s (sa) practice shows us that it is better to abstain in our circumstances. When Muslim society was initially surrounded by idolaters in Arabia, drinking intoxicants was common and so it was important for Muslims to make extra efforts to distinguish themselves from their surroundings. In those circumstances, the Holy Prophet (sa) placed restrictions on consuming even permissible amounts of alcohol. However, once Muslim society had been properly established and there was a social aversion to intoxicating drinks, then there was no longer a need for such extra restrictions. That is why the Holy Prophet (sa) said, “I prohibited you from the use of Nabidh except in dry waterskins. Now drink, but do not drink when it becomes intoxicant.” (Muslim) A similar situation applies in our circumstances, and we live in a society where drinking intoxicants is common. In these circumstances, it is important for our society and for our offspring that we abstain from consuming foods and beverages with even permissible amounts of alcohol in them. .\n\nHazrat Khalifa Rabi (rh) said, “But I told this lady, which I am telling you as well, I don’t eat such cakes, knowing it, because if I take one step in this direction, I know other people will start taking many steps in that direction and start misusing this license. So safe principle is something else, correct true application of a principle of jurisprudence is something else. As far as my advise, I told her, to you and to you children is concerned, don’t take this license because if you permit your children to start eating such cakes you’ll have a society of wine drinkers and beer drinkers. So they will have this taboo destroyed, you know, this inborn inhibition will be damaged, then they will gradually be drawn into transgressing into other positively forbidden areas. So this is the safe principle.”\n\nHadhur made it clear that we should abstain from this as one step towards this direction, can cause others to take extra steps towards it which can lead to their downfall. Furthermore, Assim Al Hakeem is drinking the type of beer that would have him over the legal blood alcohol limit to drive in the USA if he drinks 6 of those “light beers” of his. Being a great scholar of the Muslims (according to many) he should not dare to say that he is proud of drinking alcohol\n\nCombining the Prayers: https://www.instagram.com/p/BlDs8GEHknK/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nMany non Ahmadi Muslims often ask why we combine our prayers and sometimes raise allegations on this, that why do Ahmadi Muslims combine their prayers? Firstly, Ahmadi Muslims do not always combine prayers. All Ahmadi Muslims are required to pray all of the five obligatory prayers. –\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (saw) would also sometimes combine the prayers during some occasions, which shows that this is permissible . Combining prayers is definitely allowed, since our beloved Prophet Muhammad (saw) also combined. Now it is up to the person as to when he deems it appropriate to combine. His decision may be right or it may be wrong. He should see that what is my ability right now. When there is bad weather, or we are travelling or any other difficulty, or perhaps an important gathering, only then we combine the prayers. This is allowed in Islam. –\n\nWe also know that the ahadith tell us that prayers would be combined during the time of the Messiah(as) which shows us that it would be more frequent than normal, as prayers were already being combined. One reason is because of the sign of the end times that time would pass much quickly and the Messiah and his followers would always be busy in the cause of Allah in those times, which is why they would have to combine the prayers more.\n\nيَنْزِلُ عِيسَى بْنُ مَرْيَمَ , عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ , فَيَقْتُلُ الْخِنْزِيرَ ، وَيَمْحُو الصَّلِيبَ ، وَتُجْمَعُ لَهُ الصَّلاةُ ،\n\nHazrat Abu Hurairah narrated that : “The Messenger of Allah, May Allah Bless him stated: When Jesus son of Mary descends, he will kill the pig, break the cross, and prayers will be combined…. (Musnad Ahmad)\n\n–\n\nAnother hadith states:\n\nوَيَتَقَارَبَ الزَّمَانُ\n\nMeaning that during the end times, time will pass quickly. With all of the events the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat is doing it is obvious that prayers would be combined. We must remember that the task of spreading the true Islam and removing misconceptions is all on the shoulders of this small community. However, combining prayers for everything is not allowed and should only happen in extremely important situations.\n\nWhere is Allah? : https://www.instagram.com/p/BlvwtHxnZNQ/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nHadhrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) has done so much for Islam and at times people do not realize this. He didn’t only prove the death of Isa(as) and a peaceful Islam, rather he corrected many misconceptions that came into Islam. Hadhrat Ahmad(as) stated:\n\nIn fact, many errors had arisen such that if Allah Almighty had not established a community and appointed someone to rectify them, the world would have perished and Islam would have been annihilated completely\n\n–\n\nOne problem which has been raised by many Muslims, in specific the so called Salafi Muslims, is where is Allah? They have Ruined the characteristics of our Beloved Character and describe Him in a way which is unacceptable.\n\n–\n\nThe omnipotence and omnipresence of Allah is clear from the Qur’an. Allah has no direction and is not confined to a single area. Let us look at the countless proofs from the Holy Qur’an.\n\n–\n\nAnd when My servants ask thee about Me, say: ‘I am near. I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he prays to Me. So they should hearken to Me and believe in Me, that they may follow the right way.’(Chapter 2 Verse 187)\n\n–\n\nAnd assuredly, We have created man and We know what his physical self whispers to him, and We are nearer to him than even his jugular vein.(Chapter 50 Verse 17) –\n\nOne might now say that Allah is only referring to knowledge but then Allah would not need to use jugular vein and nor has He used the word knowledge anywhere in this Ayahs. Allah is clearly referring to his omnipotence and omnipresence. –\n\nAnd He is Allah, the God, both in the heavens and in the earth. He knows your inside and your outside. And He knows what you earn.(Chapter 6 Verse 4) –\n\nHe it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods, then He settled Himself on the Throne. He knows what enters the earth and what comes out of it, and what comes down from heaven and what goes up into it. And He is with you wherever you may be. And Allah sees all that you do.(Chapter 57 Verse 5) –\n\nHadhrat Ahmad(as) stated:\n\n“The true Unity of God, the affirmation of which is demanded by God and upon which salvation depends, is to believe that God in His Being is free from every associate, whether it is an idol or a human being, or the sun or the moon or one’s ego, or one’s cunning or deceit; and to conceive of no one as possessing power in opposition to Him, nor to accept anyone as sustainer, nor to hold anyone as bestowing honour or disgrace, nor to consider anyone as helper or assistant; and to confine one’s love to Him and one’s worship to Him and one’s humility to Him and one’s hopes to Him and one’s Fear to Him. No unity can be complete without the following three types of particularisation. First, there is the Unity of Being, that is to say, to conceive the whole universe as nonexistent in contrast with Him and to consider it mortal and lacking reality. Secondly, the Unity of attributes, that is to say, that Rububiyyat and Godhead are confined to His being and that all others who appear as sustainers or benefactors are only a part of the system set up by His Hand. Thirdly, the Unity of love and sincerity and devotion; that is to say, not to consider anyone as an associate of God in the matter of love and worship and to be entirely lost in Him” (Four Questions by Mr Sirajjuddin, A Christian, and Their Answers, Ruhani Khazain, Volume 12, Pages 349-350)\n\n–\n\nAllah is not Limited to a single place as many Non Ahmadi Muslims believe.\n\nKey to Success: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmV44gTnol5/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nSuccess in Life\n\n1.

If we are going to study away from home we really need to prepare ourselves. I know of the best students who loved Islam but because of studying away from home, they have destroyed their lives in every way possible. We should keep good company and start an amsa, even if we are one student alone. Amsa is Ahmadiyya Muslim Students association. To be honest with you, if I could go back in time, I would love to study at a university where I am the only Ahmadi and would love to start an Amsa. You start alone, but Allah would send His Help and bring many to Ahmadiyyat. –\n\nI posted a post on success to life just before this which should be followed.\n\n–\n\nHadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) stated:\n\n–\n\nIt all depends. There are certain girls whose parents know that they have a complete control over them and no harm can come their way. Even if they are trusted to go and study with students, male students and they can observe purdah too. For example, one girl was sent from Multan in Pakistan to study in Oxford and she was a science student. She did her study or doctorate in solid state and all through she observed purdah and she guarded herself. She was one of the muhsinaat. Muhsinaat is one who is capable of guarding herself. So in that case, there is no objection for that girl to study in any university. But if that girl is weak and the parents know better and she is liable to be influenced wrongly by that trial, then it will be very dangerous to send that girl and to cry later on. It would be too late then. So you should not put weight beyond ones capacity. –\n\nThis is the fundamental rule. لَا يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا\n\nAllah burdens not any soul beyond its capacity.(Chapter 2 Verse 287)\n\n–\n\nIf the children, even if it’s a male child, is sent to conditions where its too much for him to resist, and he is yet in a formative state, then it will be destroying your own son with your own hands. It’s not a question of male or female. Its applicable equal to every situation. ” (Hadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad (rh) , 5/6/1984)\n\nLife on Other Planets: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmWFclHnAeB/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nThere is most certainly life on other planets and the Qur’an makes this clear.Allah States in the Qur’an:\n\nوَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ خَلْقُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَثَّ فِيهِمَا مِنْ دَابَّةٍ ۚ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ جَمْعِهِمْ إِذَا يَشَاءُ قَدِيرٌ {30}\n\nAnd among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and of whatever living creatures He has spread forth in both. And He has the power to gather them together when He pleases.(Chapter 42 Verse 30) –\n\nAllah makes it clear that there is creation of the heavens and the earth and that living creatures exist within them. Allah Also makes it clear that He has the knowledge and power and it is He who would bring together the creatures of the heavens and the earth whenever in His infallible wisdom He would deem it appropriate. This verse gives the possibility of the creatures living on earth and in other heavenly bodies to unite in some future time. –\n\nHadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) was asked about life on other planets to which he said “Yes, most certainly. There is life on other planets or other stars or their planets. But there is most certainly life there because according to the Holy Qur’an such life as we find here on earth a life similar to that exists elsewhere also and that life form will come into communion with human life form one day” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1AcIiG6FeQ\n\nPraying With Eyes Closed: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmWG_bJHtH7/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nA person asked that must we look in sajdah? Can we not close our eyes? And why is it makrooh?\n\n–\n\nHadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) replied: “Are you keeping your eyes open in front of me? Why don’t you close them?”\n\n–\n\nThe person tried replying but Hadhur said answer my question. You are speaking to me why not close your eyes? It’s because your soul tells you it’s not appropriate to speak to one with your eyes closed.\n\n–\n\nHoly Prophet (sa) said do ihsaan in namaaz, meaning feel as if you are in front of God standing, and seeing him and if not that then feel as if Allah is seeing you. This is the rule that your eyes should be kept open and you should not speak with your eyes closed. Closing eyes also leads to negligence while with open eyes you can keep concentration and speak while being focused.\n\n–\n\nSecondly Hadhur explained that apart from eyes being opened, we should keep our eyes low so we are concentrated in our prayers. We should not keep our eyes up because if we did that, then anyone coming and going would distract us. Left, right, and in front of you would be people who would cause distraction. If you keep eyes on the sajdah gah you will not be bothered and your namaaz will not be disturbed. (4th September 1996)\n\n–\n\nHadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) also stated:\n\n“Nobody shuts his or her eyes. If somebody does you better tell him or her that its wrong. You shouldn’t shut your eyes, in fact its prohibited. Hadhrat Rasul (saw) strictly prohibited people standing in prayer and shutting their eyes.” ( November, 11, 1984 Question Answer Session)\n\nIslamic View on Surrogacy: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmYiJxxHMH6/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nOne question which is often raised is whether surrogacy is allowed in Islam. In regards to the progeny in Islam, gives us clear instructions. The central point is that the progeny from the husband and wife should be safeguarded. No one else’s children should be mixed with them that the offspring of a husband and wife should be kept separated from all others and no one else’s progeny should be mixed in. The concept of illegitimate children, not just Islam, but all religions are against it. This causes a lot of problems. It is not allowed. –\n\nHadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) stated:\n\n“Surrogate mothers and surrogate children. Islam defines children as those born of husband and wife. So the concept of surrogate mothers does not arise. And this concept in the modern science has been made possible with lots of problems with the result that now some governments are legislating against surrogate children either in favor their real parents or in favor of the mothers. So this controversy goes on. The reality is, that the true son and the true daughter are those who are made or born out of the genes of the father and the mother. Now scientifically, it can be said that the ovum is taken from the wife of the person and the sperm is taken from the husband, so it’s the same thing. But it is not the same thing because once ovum is fertilized then all through the pregnancy the child continues to inherit characters from the mother, which does not happen in the case of surrogate mothers. So this is scientifically proved beyond a shadow of doubt. So they cannot replace the system which God has created by creating artificial scientific means to achieve something which they just cannot achieve” (Questions & Answers in English with Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad (London UK, October 1998)\n\nIntroduction to Ahmadiyyat: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bml8TPlH1tJ/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nAhmadiyya Muslim Islam is a sect of Islam. International and a revival moment with Islam. It was founded in 1889 and spans over 200 countries with membership exceeding tens of millions. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is the only Islamic Organization which believes that the long-awaited Messiah has come in the person of Hadhrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) (1835-1908). He claimed to be the metaphorical second coming of Hadhrat Isa(as). The Prophet Muhammad (saw) prophesied his coming and gave his exact time as well. –\n\nAhmad’s(as) advent has brought about an unprecedented era of Islamic revival. He divested Islam of fanatical beliefs and practices by vigorously championing Islam’s true and essential teachings. He also recognized the noble teachings of the great religious founders and saints, including Zoroaster(as), Abraham(as), Moses(as), Jesus(as), Krishna(as), Buddha(as), Confucius(as), Lao Tzu and Guru Nanak, and explained how such teachings converged into the one true Islam.\n\n–\n\nAll Muslim sects generally dislike Guru Nanak and claim that he brought a new religion, but according to us, he was a Muslim and did not change Islam. Hadhrat Ahmad(as) said:\n\n“Guru Baba Nanak also claimed to be a recipient of revelation from God and he enjoyed the Divine blessing of showing many miracles. Thus he roundly debunked the erroneous claims that there was no revelation after the Vedas or that no signs were manifested thereafter. No doubt Baba Nanak was a great blessing from God for the adherents of Hinduism. You may deem him, if you please, the last avatar for Hinduism who endeavoured to eradicate the hatred which Hindus had for Islam. But it is tragic for this country that Hindu faith did not derive any benefit from this Divine blessing which came in the person of Baba Nanak. On the contrary, the Pundits inflicted much pain upon him for praising Islam wherever he went. It was his mission in fact to bring Hinduism and Islam to a state of mutual peace. Unfortunately for this country, the followers of the Hindu faith paid no due attention to his teaching. If he and his pious teachings had been shown any respect, the Hindus and the Muslims would have become united by now. O grief that such a righteous man came into this world, remained with us and passed away, but the imprudent did not gain any benefit from his light! In any case, he proved that the institution of revelation and communion never terminates and that the Divine signs of Allah always appear through the agency of His chosen ones and he stood witness to the fact that harbouring enmity towards Islam is tantamount to harbouring enmity towards the Divine light. Similarly, I can also, from personal experience, give testimony that the present age has certainly not been deprived of communication and revelation from God. On the contrary, God still speaks as He used to speak and still hears as He used to hear. It is not that His eternal attributes have become inoperative. (Message of Peace, Pages 14-15)\n\n–\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is the leading Islamic organization to categorically reject terrorism in any form. Over a century ago, Ahmad(as) emphatically declared that an aggressive “jihad by the sword” has no place in Islam. In its place, he taught his followers to wage a bloodless, intellectual “jihad of the pen” to defend Islam. To this end, Ahmad(as)penned over 90 books and tens of thousands of letters, delivered hundreds of lectures, and engaged in scores of public debates. His rigorous and rational defenses of Islam unsettled conventional Muslim thinking. As part of its effort to revive Islam, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community continues to spread Ahmad’s(as) teachings of moderation and restraint in the face of bitter opposition from parts of the Muslim world.\n\n–\n\nSimilarly, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is the only Islamic organization to endorse a separation of mosque and state. Over a century ago, Ahmad(as) taught his followers to protect the sanctity of both religion and government by becoming righteous souls as well as loyal citizens. He cautioned against irrational interpretations of Quranic pronouncements and misapplications of Islamic law. He continually voiced his concerns over protecting the rights of God’s creatures. Today, it continues to be an advocate for universal human rights and protections for religious and other minorities. It champions the empowerment and education of women. Its members are among the most law-abiding, educated, and engaged Muslims in the world.\n\n–\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is the foremost Islamic organization with a central spiritual leader, known as the Khalifa of Islam. Over a century ago, Ahmad(as) reminded his followers of God’s promise to safeguard the message of Islam through khilafat (the spiritual institution of successor ship to prophethood). The Community believes that only spiritual successorship of Khilafat can uphold the true values of Islam and unite humanity. Five spiritual leaders have succeeded Ahmad(as) since his demise in 1908. It’s fifth and current spiritual head, His Holiness the Khalifa of Islam Mirza Masroor Ahmad, resides in the United Kingdom. Under the leadership of Islamic Khilafat, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has now built over 16,000 mosques, over 500 schools, and over 30 hospitals. It has translated the Holy Quran into over 70 languages. It propagates the true teachings of Islam and the message of peace and tolerance through a twenty-four hour satellite television channel (MTA), the Internet (alislam.org) and print (Islam International Publications). The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has been at the forefront of worldwide disaster relief through an independent charitable organization, Humanity First.\n\nAll Ahmadi Muslims believe in the Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw) as the seal of the Prophets and accept everything in Islam. Hadhrat Ahmad (as) is the Prophesied Messiah who was prophesied by all prophets to come in the end times to revive Islam as a sub ordinate prophet\n\nPilgrimage: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmqdVoZn6iK/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nOne of the pillars of Islam is the performance of Hajj which is the pilgrimage. If a Muslim is able to, he must perform the pilgrimage at least once in his life. The ka’ba is in the middle of a large courtyard of Masjid al Haram. It contains the maqam e Ibrahim and the famous fountain of Zamzam as well.\n\nHajj is performed in the Muslim month of Dhul Hijjah, which is two months after Eid ul Fitr. The ceremonies of Hajj include:\n\nEntering into the state of ihram by wearing only two seamless white sheets. This is done by the pilgrims when they reach certain designated places close to Mecca.\n\n2. Saying of talbiyah starting at the place where the ihram is worn. Talbiyah consists of saying aloud the following:\n\nHere we come, O God, here we come No partner have You, here we come\n\nIndeed, praise and blessings are Yours, and the Kingdom too No partner have You, here we come\n\n1. On entering Mecca, the pilgrims perform the first tawaf which consists of going around the Ka’ba seven times in an anticlockwise direction.\n\n2. After completing the tawaf, the pilgrims perform the sa’yy which consists of running between the two little hills of Safa and Marwa located near the Ka’ba. These are the two hills where Hajirah ran in search of water when Prophet Abraham had to leave her there on Divine command.\n\n3. After performing the sa’yy, the pilgrims move to Mina, a plain located about four miles east of Mecca, and spend the night there.\n\n4. Next morning, the pilgrims leave for the Plain of Arafat located nine miles southeast of Mecca. They arrive there in the early afternoon, say the combined Zuhr and Asr Prayers and listen to a sermon given by the Imam. The pilgrims stay in the Plain of Arafat only till sunset. This is the same plain where the Prophet Muhammad delivered his farewell sermon.\n\n5. After sunset the pilgrims leave Arafat and come to a place called Muzdalifah. In the Holy Quran, this place is referred to as al Mash’ar al Haram, the Sacred Monument. On reaching Muzdalifah, the pilgrims say their combined Maghrib and Isha Prayers and spend the night there. In the morning, after saying the Fajr Prayer, the pilgrims return to Mina once again.\n\nThe pilgrims reach Mina on the tenth day of Dhul Hijjah. This is the busiest day of the pilgrimage. The first ceremony that is performed at Mina is the throwing of small stones or ramy al jimar. In this ceremony the pilgrims throw stones at three pillars in a symbolic act of striking the devil.\n\n7. The tenth day of Dhul Hijjah is also the day when pilgrims sacrifice their animals. This day is also celebrated all over the Muslim world as the festive day of Eid al Adha.\n\n8. After performing the sacrifice the pilgrims have their heads shaved or their hair clipped. After this they emerge from the state of ihram by wearing their everyday clothes.\n\n9. Clad in their everyday clothes the pilgrims perform another tawaf of the Ka’ba. This tawaf is called tawaf e ziarat.\n\n10. Before the tenth day of Dhul Hijjah ends, the pilgrims perform another sa’ yy between the hills of Safa and Marwa.\n\n11. After this the pilgrims return once again to Mina where they stay until the twelfth or thirteenth day of Dhul Hijjah. During these two or three days the pilgrims continue to perform the ceremony of ramy al jimar or throwing of stones.\n\n12. On the afternoon of the twelfth Dhul Hijjah (or of the thirteenth) the pilgrims return to Mecca for the last ceremony of the pilgrimage. This ceremony consists of the farewell tawaf of the Ka’ba after which the entire pilgrimage is completed and the pilgrims are free to go wherever they wish.\n\nMany non Ahmadi Muslims are doing Hajj but have not yet accepted Hadhrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) which certainly takes precedence and should be done first. May Allah Guide all Muslims on the true path of Islam ameen.\n\nWe Ahmadis are not officially allowed to perform Hajj because of the so called religious clerics but in reality love Hajj and it is all of our dreams to perform this important ritual at least once in our lives when we are able to. It is narrated about Hadhrat Ahmadas:\n\nOne day the Promised Messiahas was feeling unwell and was lying down on his bed. The Promised Messiahas’s wife, Hadhrat Amma Jaanra and her father, the late Mir Nasir Nawwab were sitting in the house talking to one another. When the topic of Hajj (Pilgrimage to Makkah) came up, Hadhrat Mir Nawwab said, “these days the journey for Hajj has become very easy, people should go to Hajj”. The Promised Messiahas was listening to this discussion. The Promised Messiahas began to think of the Ka’bah (i.e. the House of God in Makkah – a cube shaped building), and the grave of the Holy Prophetsaw (in Madinah). Due to his immense love his eyes began to flow with tears. The Promised Messiahas’s extreme desire to perform Hajj revealed itself and as tears flowed from his heart he would wipe them He addressed Hadhrat Mir Nawwab and said only:\n\n“This is true and it is our heart-felt desire as well, but I think to myself, will I ever be able to see the grave of the Holy Prophetsaw?” This is the love he had for our master, Hadhrat Muhammadsaw! Hadhrat Ahmadas was a true lover of the Holy Prophetsaw and defended him day and night. May Allah Guide the Muslims and develop love in their hearts for His Messiah, Ameen.\n\nNote On Sacrificing an Animal: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmvufrOn5z3/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nI wanted to share an important note in regards to Qurbani. Many ask whether it is necessary that a person should do the qurbani themselves, in person, rather than sending money to other countries so that one may do qurbani on their behalf.\n\n–\n\nThe fardh qurbani is only for those performing Hajj in ardh-e-haram. For the rest, the Qur’an does not mention anything. We are only following the traditions of Hajj out of love and for the blessings. It is only to attain nearness to Allah and help the needy. We should understand the reason of qurbani. To slaughter a goat in a country where people are eating meat everyday and are almost crazy because of the amount of meat they eat, will not have as much blessings as sacrificing a goat through someone else, in a country where poor Muslims are dying out of hunger, such as Pakistan or Africa. We can do qurbani in the west as well, but it is better to do it for our brothers who do not even get meat once a year and wait for this day so they may eat. The flesh of the goat or the blood will not reach Allah, rather it is the righteousness of a person which reaches Allah. If we slaughter a goat in a poorer country, we will in sha Allah attain righteousness. This was explained by Hadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) in a question answer session of April 27, 1997.\n\nQuestion on Homosexuality: https://www.instagram.com/p/BWy1C3nhLHD/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nLove for All, Hatred for None\n\nMany people misunderstand the concept of Love for all, and Hatred for none. They think it’s like the concept of freedom, meaning do whatever you like without any restrictions. This is a completely false expression of this slogan. Allah is the all loving, but even Allah punishes and shows displeasure for the behaviours of his creation for the commands of God they rejected and wherever they disobeyed him. We love the person in a compassion sense, and want the best for everyone. We pray they are all guided and wish for them to be guided. But at the same time, we are displeased with their behaviour and tendencies and positions in certain things we know it will ruin the society and be detrimental to it.\n\nCertain things are against Allah and homosexuality is one of them. If someone wants to become a Muslim but is homosexual, they must hide it and suppress it, just as one who is hooked on marijauna or other drugs would have to completely suppress it and would have to ignore it and with prayers overcome it. Allah hates the behaviour of homosexuality so you must suppress it.\n\nHuzoor explained that it was not only the Quran that taught that homosexuality was wrong but also the Bible did. Huzoor said Muslims should never hold any ill-will towards homosexual people and to persecute, attack or discriminate against them was completely wrong and contrary to Islam’s teachings. Regardless, he said that a person should be able to hold peacefully held religious beliefs.\n\nSee previous post on what true love is and how Hadhrat Ahmad (as) explained from Qur’an and sunnah\n\nThe Seven Heavens: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQx5QcH4g6/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nA person asked about the seven heavens which are often mentioned in the Holy Qur’an. Hadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) explained this beautifully. He stated:\n\n–\n\n“I have already spoken on the word seven many times. The word seven is a letter or a numerical expression which speaks of perfection. So the seven stands for perfection and also it stands for in a manner of speaking eternity. Because God has created weeks of seven days and they never end. A week is followed by another and another. So the word seven or the figure of seven is constantly repeated. So this is why the Holy Qur’an and the bible earlier spoke of the creation of the heaven and the earth in six days followed by one in which God is stated to have occupied His throne. So that also comprises of seven. So the word seven does not literally mean the seven as we understand in the human language. The word seven stands for a perfect symbol of eternity or a very large expression of something. So the same seven as I have explained used in the Qur’an and the Bible stands for eons. You see the time spreading over 20 billion years is expressed by the word seven. So the seven heavens as I understand, stand not only for one universe but many universes. Each of that universe could be categorized or divided into seven categories within that universe. So the scientists have not yet been able to understand the word seven in application to the creation of the heavens and the earth, or heavens in that respect but I am quite sure that as science progresses, in sha allah, they will discover, that each universe is further sub divided into seven spaces. Some categorization has already been made regarding this heaven which is the first sky. The sky of the earth, the Holy Qur’an also calls it samau al-dunya. This has already been divided into many spheres within it. I don’t remember whether they are divided into seven zones or less, perhaps less so far but most certainly each heaven in itself has already been subdivided into several suborders and regions. That is the meaning of the word seven. It continuously goes on multiplying by itself and within itself it goes on splitting into further sevens.\n\nThat is why Surah Fatiha also comprises of seven verses which means something which has endless meaning, and you can never reach the ultimate or the last end of it in fact. So that is the meaning of seven. It doesn’t mean you count one two or three and the universe is finished.” (Hadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh), Question and answer session, 6/29/1990)\n\nThe World is A Prison for Believers: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQ5IkpHJCJ/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nThe Holy Prophet Muhammad(saw) stated:\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:\n\nThe world is a prison-house for a believer and Paradise for a non-believer.(sahih Muslim #2956)\n\n‏ “‏ الدُّنْيَا سِجْنُ الْمُؤْمِنِ وَجَنَّةُ الْكَافِرِ ‏”‏\n\nHowever the Qur’an also states:\n\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ أَلَّا تَخَافُوا وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا وَأَبْشِرُوا بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِي كُنْتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ {31}\n\nAs for those who say, ‘Our Lord is Allah,’ and then remain steadfast, the angels descend on them, saying: ‘Fear ye not, nor grieve; and rejoice in the Garden that you were promised.(41:31) –\n\nWe have to remember that when the Prophet Muhammad (saw) said that this world is like a prison to a believer and heaven for a disbeliever, he refers to the freedom of action. In the heavens, you can do whatever you please and are not permitted from anything. But on this earth, we are forbidden from certain actions. You are imprisoned in the sense that you are restricted. According to the Qur’an, there are many things we cannot do. In the case of a believer, living a life following all commandments, is not an easy job. To get up a certain time in the morning for prayers for example is difficult for many. –\n\nTo believe in certain manners, for example respecting ones elders, and treating juniors with respect, and being watchful of what we bring forth for our future generations. There are over 100 things that restrict the life of a believer. In this sense, he is living in a prison. He could break the prison wall, but he does not in comparison to a non believer who does as he pleases. He can take revenge in a wrong way, take rights of others, steal, abuse, and take part in much more which is not acceptable in the Sight of Allah. Its heaven for him because he has complete freedom.\n\n–\n\nWhen the Qur’an tells us of the heaven for the believers, He is saying that the believers love Allah so much that following Allah ultimately becomes the pleasure for them and what seems to be a restriction to others, is a pleasure for them and brings them happiness. You grow a taste for them.\n\nIn the world of beasts, there are no restrictions, but in the civilization there are restrictions. For example, the way we eat. If we do not follow the appropriate way of eating, we are looked down upon. There are more restrictions put by the civilizations on a civilized people than perhaps a religion but because people get used to them, and they have acquired that taste, it becomes a heaven for them. But to begin with, when you begin to teach children how to behave, it is a hell for them. For example, how children rebel against parents saying that they are interfering with their lives. They thoroughly disapprove of what their parents say but when they grow up and get used to these things, they take pride in them and look down upon those who enjoy a sort of freedom in comparison to them. It’s a world of comparison and relativity. The hell becomes a heaven for the people and the heaven becomes a hell for the disbelievers. Those who really believe in Allah and act according to His desires and wishes, (not only orders but wishes as well), they attain heaven in this world. The same world of restrictions becomes a world of pleasure and full of comfort. –\n\nWe as Ahmadi Muslims are witnesses to this ahadith and the Qur’anic ayah. Our beloved Imam and parents kept us away from evil and we witness what has happened to those who rejected their parents and the imam and followed the way of satan. We may not see the fruits the same day but we will one day realize how important it was to listen to the Khalifa and our beloved parents and how it saved us and our future.\n\nHow To Safeguard from Bad Dreams: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQ7FsXHLxY/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nHadhrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad(aba) explained that the Holy Prophet (sa) said that before you sleep, recite ayatul Kursi and blow over yourself and read the last three kuls, the last three surahs of the Qur’an and then blow on yourself three times and you will be safeguarded from bad dreams and Allah will Protect you from other evil influences and your mind will be focused towards Allah. This is from the ahadith. (Gulshan e Waqfe Nau Atfal December 8, 2013)\n\n–\n\nNarrated ‘Aisha:\n\nWhenever the Prophet (ﷺ) went to bed every night, he used to cup his hands together and blow over it after reciting Surat Al-Ikhlas, Surat Al-Falaq and Surat An-Nas, and then rub his hands over whatever parts of his body he was able to rub, starting with his head, face and front of his body. He used to do that three times.\n\nحَدَّثَنَا قُتَيْبَةُ بْنُ سَعِيدٍ، حَدَّثَنَا الْمُفَضَّلُ، عَنْ عُقَيْلٍ، عَنِ ابْنِ شِهَابٍ، عَنْ عُرْوَةَ، عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم كَانَ إِذَا أَوَى إِلَى فِرَاشِهِ كُلَّ لَيْلَةٍ جَمَعَ كَفَّيْهِ ثُمَّ نَفَثَ فِيهِمَا فَقَرَأَ فِيهِمَا ‏{‏قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ‏}‏ وَ‏{‏قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ‏}‏ وَ‏{‏قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ‏}‏ ثُمَّ يَمْسَحُ بِهِمَا مَا اسْتَطَاعَ مِنْ جَسَدِهِ يَبْدَأُ بِهِمَا عَلَى رَأْسِهِ وَوَجْهِهِ وَمَا أَقْبَلَ مِنْ جَسَدِهِ يَفْعَلُ ذَلِكَ ثَلاَثَ مَرَّاتٍ‏.‏ –\n\nIt is also narrated:\n\nIt was narrated from Abu Qatadah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:\n\n“(Good) dreams come from Allah and (bad) dreams come from Satan, so if anyone of you sees something that he dislikes, let him spit dryly to his left three times, and seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan three times, and turn over onto his other side.”\n\nحَدَّثَنَا مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ رُمْحٍ، حَدَّثَنَا اللَّيْثُ بْنُ سَعْدٍ، عَنْ يَحْيَى بْنِ سَعِيدٍ، عَنْ أَبِي سَلَمَةَ بْنِ عَبْدِ الرَّحْمَنِ بْنِ عَوْفٍ، عَنْ أَبِي قَتَادَةَ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ـ صلى الله عليه وسلم ـ قَالَ ‏ “‏ الرُّؤْيَا مِنَ اللَّهِ وَالْحُلْمُ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ فَإِنْ رَأَى أَحَدُكُمْ شَيْئًا يَكْرَهُهُ فَلْيَبْصُقْ عَنْ يَسَارِهِ ثَلاَثًا وَلْيَسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ ثَلاَثًا وَلْيَتَحَوَّلْ عَنْ جَنْبِهِ الَّذِي كَانَ عَلَيْهِ ‏”‏ ‏.‏\n\n(Ibn maja)\n\nVegetarian Diet: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmRATfMHb8n/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nMany ask about having a vegetarian diet, and abstaining from all meats. Islam calls us towards a balanced diet which includes meat and dairy products. For example, in regards to milk which many try avoiding, Allah States:\n\n” And surely in the cattle too there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of what is in their bellies, from betwixt the faeces and the blood, milk pure and pleasant for those who drink it.” (Chapter 16 Verse 67)\n\n–\n\nAs for our diet, Allah States:\n\n“O ye who believe! Make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Surely, Allah Loves not the transgressors” (Chapter 5 Verse 88)\n\n–\n\nJust as the making of something forbidden thing lawful is an act of excess and transgression, similarly the declaring of a good and lawful thing into unlawful or practically treating it as such is an act of Islam.\n\n–\n\nBeing a vegetarian does not give you more reward. In fact, it is not a way to get closer to Allah. A narration mentions a companion thinking of leaving all meat. It is narrated:\n\n–\n\nNarrated Anas:\n\nIt was narrated from Anas that there was a group of the Companions of the Prophet, one of whom said: “I will not marry women.” Another said: “I will not eat meat.” Another said: “I will not sleep on a bed.” Another said: “I will fast and not break my fast.” News of that reached the Messenger of Allah and he praised Allah then said: “What is the matter with people who say such and such? But I pray and I sleep, I fast and I break my fast, and I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me.” (Sunan An Nasai, #3217)\n\n–\n\nIf one does not like a certain food, it is allowed to stay away from it. However, to cut off all meats does not make sense. –\n\nHadhrat Ahmad(as) stated:\n\n” Experience also shows that different types of food affect the intellect and the mind in different ways. For instance, careful observation would disclose that people who refrain altogether from eating meat gradually suffer a decline of the faculty of bravery; they lose courage and thus suffer the loss of a divinely bestowed praiseworthy faculty. ” (Philosophy of Teachings of Islam, page 9)\n\n–\n\nHe also stated:\n\n” Conversely those who are given to a diet consisting mainly of meat and eat very little of greens suffer a decline of meekness and humility. Those who adopt the middle course develop both types of moral qualities. That is why God Almighty has said in the Holy Quran: “Eat and drink but do not be immoderate (7:32)\n\nThat is to say, eat meat and other foods but do not eat anything to excess, lest your moral state be adversely affected and your health might suffer.” (Philosophy of Teachings of Islam, Page 10)\n\n– “Once Hadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) was asked about compassion to the creatures of Allah. He explained that he believes in the validity of religious practices all over the world of partaking of animal flesh. He said that he thinks there is nothing in it which is overall against the grand plan of God who is the All Compassionate and Merciful.” (Question and Answer Session (29 Jan 1995, p2)\n\nAdoption in the Qur’an: https://www.instagram.com/p/BmTu2x1HkK4/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nNowadays many are asking about the Islamic teachings regarding adoption. They ask what the way of adoption is in Islam and how have the rights of children and parents been safeguarded. In regards to adoption, the Qur’an makes it clear that the children do not become your real children.\n\n–\n\nAllah States:\n\nAllah has not made for any man two hearts in his breast; nor has He made those of your wives, from whom you keep away by calling them mothers, your real mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. That is merely a word of your mouths; but Allah speaks the truth, and He guides to the right path. (Chapter 33 verse 5)\n\n–\n\nThis is what Allah Tells us in the Qur’an and this is the Islamic viewpoint. The notes of Hadhrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad (ra) make it clear that “The other custom was that of adopting the son of another man as one’s own. This custom, apart from being calculated to cause complications in blood relationships was also puerile and foolish” –\n\nFirstly, despite adoption, the natural relations can never be changed. Whether one makes someone their son, sister, or daughter, it is only a worldly tradition. According to the shariah, the relations do not have a change in them. If he is old, the rules of purdah and what is halal and haram and wedding rules will remain the same. We cannot say since a person was made into a son, so he cannot marry the persons daughter. This rule applies to all rulings. If we know the persons parents, his name should not be changed. Even if you adopt, you cannot say he is the son of you. The Qur’an makes this clear. There is no right to change the natural relations which Allah has made.\n\n–\n\nIf there is a unknown person, whose parents we have no knowledge at all, it is said he is your brother and think he is from you. There is no reason to give them a different caste or tribe. Consider him amongst yourselves. He will be a brother of the tribe. He is a Muslim and that is enough. He can be recognized by where he lives. –\n\nWe see the famous story of the Prophet Muhammad (saw) and Zaid (ra). In his childhood, he was kidnapped and sold as a slave in Mecca where he was brought by the brother of Khadija(ra) and given over to her. On her marriage with the Prophet (sa), Khadija(ra) presented Zaid to him. Zaid was so attached to the Prophet(sa) that when his father and uncle begged the Prophet (sa) to let him go, as the grief of his separation from home had almost killed his mother, the Prophet(sa) gave permission. However, Zaid himself refused to leave the Prophet (sa) saying he was dearer to him than his parents. In fact, Zaid was referred to as the son of the Prophet. However, he was not the real son.\n\nTrials: https://www.instagram.com/p/BXvfPFIB21j/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\n“During the interval between a supplication and its acceptance, one is often subjected to trial after trial, some of which are back breaking. A persevering and good natured supplicant smells the perfume of the favors of his Lord in these trials and difficulties and his intelligence informs him that they will be followed by help. One aspect of these trials is that they foster eagerness for prayer. Ths greater the distress of the supplicant, the more his soul will be melted. This is one of the factors in the acceptance of prayer. So one should not lose heart and should not think ill of God through impatience and restlessness. One should never think that one’s prayer is not accepted or will not be accepted. Such a notion is a denial of the attribute of God that He accepts prayers” (Malfuzat Vol IV Page 434)\n\nFreemasons: https://www.instagram.com/p/BX3qWnTB-QM/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nOn the night of September 30 Hadrat Ummul-Mo’minin, peace be on her, saw a dream about midnight and she immediately narrated it to the Promised Messiah[as]. It is the following: The problem of ‘Isa has been resolved. God says that when I send down ‘Isa, I withdraw my ladder.\n\nFrom this she understood that the life and death of Jesus were unaffected by any human intervention. The above was the subject of her dream. The Promised Messiah[as] said: When I pondered over it, it was conveyed to me that: [Urdu] In truth, the revival that has now taken place after a thousand years of death is free from human intervention.\n\nThis means that as God has created Jesus without any father, the Promised Messiah[as] was bestowed spiritual life without the intervention of a teacher or a spiritual preceptor. A teacher is like a father; indeed he is the true father. Plato has said: A father brings a soul to the earth and a teacher raises a soul from the earth to heaven. In short, just as Jesus had been born without a father and without the intervention of a human being, in the same way, in this case God bestowed spiritual life out of His pure grace and benevolence without the intervention of a teacher or a preceptor. Then, while I was thinking about death, I was overtaken by a light slumber and the revelation came:\n\nFreemasons will not be put in power to destroy him. From Freemasons, I understood people who conspire secretly.\n\nFrom the word ladder [which had occurred in my wife’s dream], I understood that spirits descend from heaven and ascend to heaven. What an interesting matter it is that Allah the Almighty has put a grand prophecy in it. It predicts that people will conspire to kill me, but God Almighty will not give them power over me. [al-Hakam, vol. 5, no. 37, October 10, 1901, p. 7]\n\nFurthermore, in Al Badr March 28, 1907 reports that somebody told Hadhrat Ahmad(As) that the people of Kabul were very much annoyed with their Amir(non Ahmadi) for being a member of the Freemason Society. Hadhrat Ahmad(as) said: His people are rightly annoyed with him. No believer in the Oneness of God can ever become a member of the Freemason Society. It is rooted in Christianity. There are certain high ranks of the Society which can be attained to only if one gets himself baptised. To join this Society is equal to becoming a renegade\n\nAlcohol in Cake : https://www.instagram.com/p/BYLvmzCBEtO/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nSomeone asked Hadhur that one of my friends made a cake, and in that cake, there was alcohol. I asked what did you put in the cake, and they said I used alcohol and she said I can eat it. Can we eat such cakes?\n\nHadhur (aba) basically explained that you cannot eat it. This is an excuse to open ways (to wrong things). First burn, then this then that. Unless it is a must, we should avoid it. Like in medicines there is alcohol, in medicines, like coughing syrups and sometimes homeopathy uses some alcohol and we eat that. However those are cures and are needed by us. These excuses of eating are wrong. The recipes which come here and are shown on TV, like BBC, have a habit of adding alcohol to every single food. For example, they use it in even their meat. Ahmadis should not eat such things and these are excuses and with these excuses, one might fall into the wrong path.\n\nOrgan Donation : https://www.instagram.com/p/BdF1vxnH1dr/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\n‪Beautiful answer by our Beloved Khalifa Hadhrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad (aba) on the topic of Organ Donations.

They also claim if one listens to it, they will go to the hellfire. Hadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) has beautifully answered this question. Below is his answer: ‘It all depends on the degree of the habit and the nature of the Music. Music in itself, as a whole, cannot be dubbed as bad. The Islamic principle is that a thing which has more than 50% of bad in it should be rejected and a thing which has less than 50% of bad in it should have its better things utilised and bad things avoided. Music falls in no mans land, it was neither forbidden entirely nor permitted without any conditions.\n\n–\n\nWe know that at the time of Hadhrat Mohammad(saw) when he walked into Medina the ladies of Medina sang a song of welcome whilst beating a drum which is called the ‘duff’. That was a sort of music which was available to the Arabs and nobody can say that it was not music. However, it was not the practice of the Holy Prophet(saw) to permit the companions to enjoy music and be given up to music and neither was that their habit. They enjoyed the recitation of the Holy Qur’an or the meaningful verses of good poets but gradually their taste developed and shifted from poetry to the Qur’an.\n\n–\n\nIt therefore requires some time and patience for you to improve the quality of your taste, and without first doing that to abandon certain things would be cruel. In these things it is a matter of taste, in some other things the matter of prohibition is subject to fast and hard rules and you cannot change it. For example you can’t say I have to improve my taste in water before I can stop drinking wine. That would not be permissible because wine is forbidden and what is forbidden is forbidden, but music does not fall into that category.\n\n–\n\nAs regards to music you can acquire a wise approach of a systematic and gradual deliverance from that habit. As far as pop music is concerned I don’t know how people can tolerate that, it is just sheer nonsense. With pop music when people hear the music they leave with some kind of madness and craving which they cannot quench. The taste left behind by this modern ‘so-called music’ is ugly and evil and the society under its influence is becoming uglier and more permissive and more careless of traditional values, so this music is obviously evil and sinful.\n\n–\n\nYou can’t treat every form of music alike which is why I said you have to be wise and selective in your choice. An occasional brush with music cannot be considered a practice whereby you will be sent to hell, I assure you not. However, if you have an occasional brush with music which draws you into itself at the cost of higher values, the memory of Allah (swt), and prayers, where you are taken over by it so much so that it becomes your sole ambition and obsession then you become an obvious looser.’\n\nIblis, Made of Fire: https://www.instagram.com/p/BklaBsehSYg/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nOne question which is often brought up by non Muslims and Muslims is “Who is Iblis”? Let us firstly see a quote of Hadhrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad(ra) on Iblis:\n\n–\n\n” Since the word Iblis and satan refers to beings that manifest in similar ways, there is at times crossover in the use of terminology. Iblis is a satan and satan is the source of Iblis. Hazrat Musleh Mau’ud (ra) wrote, “The word satan has been used in the Holy Quran for the evil spirits that place doubts in one’s heart, and it has been used for humans. However, the word Iblis has only been used for that being who refused to submit to Adam. Iblis refers to that evil spirit which is opposed to angels and places doubts in the heart. The word satan also refers to this, and also to the manifestations of Iblis who do the works of Iblis among humans.” (Tafsire Kabir, vol 1, pg 331)\n\n–\n\nHadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) stated:\n\n” “According to a tradition of the Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa (sa), satan runs in everybody’s blood (Bukhari and Muslim). He is in the bloodstream of every human being. So Nafse Ammara is essentially satan. Your inclination to do evil, which is in every human being, that is satan. If somebody becomes the manifestation of satan, his whole being is overpowered by his will to do evil, and if this happens at the time of a prophet, then he becomes the symbol of hostility to that prophet, a symbol of rebellion and defiance. That symbol is called Iblis, and he appears in different forms and different times. Adam’s Iblis was different and Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa (sa)’s Iblis was different and Moses’ Iblis was different. In names of course, in characters and things (they are different), but they have the fundamental most unfortunate quality of rebellion and defiance.” (Question Answer Session, April 13 1985)”\n\n–\n\nThe Five Volume Commentary of The Qur’an further mentions:\n\n“Wherever the Quran speaks of the being who, unlike the angels, refused to serve Adam, it invariably mentions the name Iblis, and wherever it speaks of the being who beguiled Adam and became the means of his being turned out of جنة (garden), it invariably mentions the name ‘satan.'” (Holy Quran English w/5 Vol. Commentary, 2:35)\n\nThe Qur’an describes Iblis for us. Allah asked Iblis “what prevented you from submitting when I commanded you? Iblis responded: “I am better than he. You have created me of fire while him You have Created of Clay” (Qur’an Chapter 7 Verse 13). It is written in Five volume commentary:\n\n–\n\n“The chief angel is Gabriel, Similarly there are evil spirits chief is Iblis. The evil spirits make civil suggestions to men and incite them to disobey God. So while the angels in obedience to God’s command submitted to Adam, Iblis, chief of the evil spirits, refused to submit to him and help him in his work” (Holy Qur’an English w/5 Vol. Commentary, 7:13)\n\n–\n\nHadhrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad(ra) stated:\n\n” Adam (as) was of a temperament of clay and could submit, however Iblis was of a temperament of fire and rebelled against submission, and that Iblis was proud of his nature and looked down on those who submit “\n\n(Sere Ruhani, pg. 32). –\n\nTo understand what Iblis is, is quite simple. However, to actually identify who has the characteristics of Iblis among the people is not as easy. This shows us the importance of arrogance and humility when it comes to our fate in the sight of humility. However, most of these qualities and characteristics remain hidden until tested. We must realize that all of our work, if successful is only by the Will of Allah and without His Grace we are literally bound to fail. – Hazrat Musleh Mau’ud (ra) said, “We have had research done about Molvi Muhammad Hussein of Batala, the greatest enemy of the Promised Messiah (as). He strictly followed the apparent commands of the Shariah, he observed Tahajjad regularly and, except for compelling reasons, he would not miss Tahajjad.” (Khutbate Mahmood, vol 2, pg 66)\n\nSo we see that one who was regular in his prayers, was not a true believer and in fact an enemy of a Prophet. He at first praised the Promised Messiah(as) a lot but because of his arrogance he fell into the deepest pits of disbelief. –\n\nThe same happens with the Prophets of Allah. Before the Prophets make their claims, they are known to be the best of the people. It is after their claim that the people begin to oppose them. Even in the life of the Prophet (saw), Abu Jahl would excel in many of the deeds. He was respected and called the “Father of Wisdom”. We also see that the Prophet (saw) was close to his paternal uncle named Abu Lahab at first. Two of the daughters of the Prophet (saw) were married to the two sons of Abu Lahab. However, he ended up opposing the Prophet(saw) which caused these marriages to be nullified. (Seal of Prophets, Vol 1, Page 149)\n\n–\n\nWe may think a person is really good but it is when their humility is tested when we can actually see how they are. For this reason it’s always important to do everything for the sake of Allah and ignore hatred.\n\n–\n\nHadhrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad(ra) also said : “It is said that Iblis was very righteous (Tareekhul Kahmees) (Khutbat-e-Mahmood Volume 2, Page 66)\n\n–\n\nWe see the same with people of our Jamaat. When Hadhrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad(ra) became the Khalifa, those who were seen as great scholars of Jamaat began to oppose him because they lacked humility. He (ra) stated:\n\n–\n\n“Those who opposed were of the disposition of fire, but you people were of the disposition of clay. You said that, according to the command of Allah, we have been obeying people from the time of Adam. Now, why would we turn away from obedience to the Khalifa of the time?” (Sere Ruhani, pg. 37)\n\n–\n\nThis is a great lesson for all of us. When our beloved Khalifa tells us something how do we respond? It is our duty to hear and obey. We must mould ourselves according to the desires of the Khalifa. Now who is truly obedient? Hadhrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad(ra) stated:\n\n” “whenever a command is given by Allah, His Prophets, or His Khulafa, he find no apprehension in his heart in following it, and he be completely ready to act on it.” (Khutbate Mahmood, vol. 2 pg. 65)”\n\n–\n\nIn summary, when Allah Mentions being created from clay, it means being readily obedient to Allah. But this obedience can require one to be rebellious as well. However, the rebellious nature will be for the sake of Allah alone. For example, being rebellious to your chief or leader when it comes to religious matters like the companions did. Being created of fire means rebellious against Allah. This is often because of obedience to society as well. The early disbelievers were like fire since they were obedient to their chiefs despite their chiefs leading them astray. So being created from clay is obedience for the sake of Allah and being created from fire is disobedience to Allah and His messengers and their khulafa.\n\nWoman Imam: https://www.instagram.com/p/BeizbZrHS8V/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nRecently something which went viral in the Muslim world was a female who lead prayers of a congregation of both men and female. Many even gave her death threats and warnings. Firstly, I am against any sort of persecution against her, despite disagreeing with her actions. We should explain the view of Islam to her rather than persecute her.\n\n–\n\nOut of respect for the chastity and honour of women, they are advised to not stand in front of men during the prayers. The rows of the women are always behind the men’s rows, from the time of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw) up until now. This gives the women complete freedom to offer their prayers without behind embarrassed by being in the presence of men. It s preferable to even separate the halls for women which makes it much comfortable for the women. A woman cannot lead the congregation of men and women, and doing this would be against the Islamic teachings. However, she can lead a congregation of women. She can also lead children of either sex among worshippers. –\n\nHadhrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad(rh) explained that women can lead other women in prayers and that there is no harm But Islam also teaches segregation of sexes and does not want human attention to divert to other channels. It should only be focussed on Allah and worship alone. It is not a reflection upon women, that they cannot lead men, rather it is a reflection upon men that they are so perverted that if ladies lead prayers, their thoughts will be towards other things and not God or worship, which would frustrate the purpose of prayer.\n\n–\n\nHadhrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad(aba) was also asked about this question. He said women have days away from prayers as well which is also a reason for them not being the imam. He said that Hadhrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) explained that this is a day and age where bad thoughts come to men much more than they did in the past. Once a politician told Hadhur (aba) that you claim men and women are equal, but women cannot eve nlead men in prayers. Hadhur (aba) said that even in the time of the Holy Prophet(saw) the women would pray behind the men at the back. Now the women have a hall because of the advancement of the world and they themselves like having their own area. When Hadhur (aba) answered this question, the person himself admit that he has become quiet and is impressed with the answer. In prayers we need full concentration, and if men and women prayer together it may affect ones concentration.\n\nIslamic View on Hookah: https://www.instagram.com/p/BeyVx2SHbqM/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nAllah makes it clear in the Qur’an, that the believers shun all that is vain. A hadith further tells us that the Holy Prophet said:\n\nمن حسن إسلام المرء تركه ما لا يعنيه\n\nIt is from the excellence of Islam, that he should shun that which is of no benefit to him” (Tirmidhi)\n\n–\n\nThe Promised Messiah(as) stated:\n\n“We do not classify tobacco as an object which intoxicates. However it is a futile act, and Allah has said about the believers: “They shun all that is vain”\n\nHe further states : “Had it existed in the days of Rasulullah (saw), he would hate it and would not like it for the companions” (Al Hakam, March 24, 1903)\n\nHe also stated: “Suppose tobacco existed during the time of Rasulullah (saw), he would not tolerate it”\n\n–\n\nAnd someone once said to Promised Messiah(as) that he should forbid hookah to which he said that I haven’t come to bring any new law and make anything haram. However every believer should leave such intoxicants unless it be for medical reasons.\n\n–\n\nLet me make one thing clear. Going to the shisha or hookah bar doesn’t make you cool. You’re paying to kill and ruin your body. The true winners are those who are obedient to Allah And His Prophet not those wasting their lives at a shisha bar.\n\n–\n\nAllah also says in the Qur’an : وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ meaning do not kill yourselves (4:30) and also States: وَلَا تُلْقُوا بِأَيْدِيكُمْ إِلَى التَّهْلُكَةِ meaning do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction (2:196)\n\n–\n\nNowadays many try using smoke pens or other types of vape pens but even these are wrong. Some use fruit smoke pens and those are also not good to use. If a Prophet said its wrong we should abandon it altogether rather than look for loopholes. The smoke itself is dangerous for the body and falls under lagw (vain) which affects spirituality. If we want to attain our goal we need to shun all that is vain\n\n–\n\nIf we know someone who has the ill habit of hookah, we have to show them the truth in the best manner. Here is a beautiful narration of Hadhrat Ahmad(as)’s life:\n\nHadhrat Sheikh Zain ul Abideen sahib (may Allah be pleased with him): He relates that when Hafiz Hamid Ali came to Qadian he used to smoke hookah a lot. He used to go to a particular household to smoke hookah. When the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) came to know, he gave Hamid Ali sahib some money and asked him to get himself a hookah and said he should not go to that house to smoke [as it was bad company]. Six months later the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) asked Hamid Ali sahib to give up hookah. He immediately did so.\n\n–\n\nHadhrat Khalifatul Masih explained that this should not be inferred as an endorsement of smoking. The Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) once said that had tobacco existed in the time of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be on him) he would have prohibited it.\n\nOnce the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) expressed his dislike of tobacco during a journey. Upon hearing this, his companions broke their hookah and then did not even touch it again.\n\n–\n\nHadhrat Maulwi Sakandar Ali sahib (may Allah be pleased with him): He relates that on one visit to Qadian prior to moving there, he went with the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) on his early morning walk. He remembers the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) saying that those who could not give up small matters, abandoning which would not upset anyone, like tobacco or other addictions, how could they give up bigger matters which would make their near and dear turn against them. Maulwi sahib writes that at the time he used to smoke the Hookah but instantly resolved to give it up. It was the love and devotion of the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace)which made it possible for him to give it up.\n\n–\n\nA beautiful story of a person who came to visit the Messiah(as) which shows that good company will keep you away from all of these evils:\n\nA man came to Qadian in the lifetime of the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace) but left after a day. Someone had sent him to Qadian with the thought that he would stay there and listen to the discourses of the Promised Messiah (on whom be peace). He was asked the reason for his abrupt departure. The man said Qadian is not a place for decent people. When asked to explain, he said. I arrived Qadian in the morning and was well looked after. I told them I had travelled from Sind and did not get a chance to smoke hookah during my journey and wanted to smoke hookah and relax. There was some delay in the hookah preparation when someone said Hazrat Maulana Nur ud Din was about to give a dars of Hadith, so I went and listened to the dars thinking I will have my hookah at leisure after the dars. After the dars someone said lunch was ready, have lunch first. I thought fine, I will relax after lunch and smoke hookah. After lunch Zuhr adhan was heard and I was asked to join Zuhr Salat. After Salat Mirza Sahib held an assembly. I thought, very well, let me listen to Mirza Sahib and then smoke hookah. Later, having been to toilet, I lighted the hookah and had barely taken two puffs when it was time for Asr Salat.\n\nI thought I will be free to smoke hookah in the evening. Just then someone said Maulana Nur ud Din was giving a dars of the Holy Qur’an. Soon after the dars, Maghrib adhan was sounded and hookah smoking still did not come to pass. After Salat Mirza Sahib held another assembly. I thought maybe I will have hookah after this but it was dinner time. After dinner I thought it was now time for hookah but people said lets offer Isha Salat. After Salat I thanked God that now there would be nothing more to do and I could eventually enjoy my hookah. I had barely lighted my hookah when I found out that Maulana Nur ud Din Sahib advised people visiting from outside Qadian after Isha. Maulana started preaching. My journey had been tiring and owing to this I fell asleep while still sitting and had no clue where I was and where my hookah was. When I awoke the next morning, I gathered my bedding and ran, thinking Qadian is not a place for a decent man stay!\n\n–\n\nLetters to the Khalifa: https://www.instagram.com/p/BfCLWFWn9_C/?taken-by=ahmadianswers\n\nAlhamdulillah, we all love Hadhrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad (aba) and always try to be obedient to him. However, sometimes many feel that they should not write Hadhur letters because “they are wasting his time”. Hadhur (aba) himself has said that this is a excuse and we should never think this way. We have to remember that Allah has given us Khilafat, and we should use this blessing rather than ignore it. Writing regular letters is a key to success in all aspects of life. Whether that be worldly, or spiritually, it only leads one to success and grants one nearness to Allah. Hadhur (aba) loves us so much. Once some letters were on the ground and he immediately said that you think these are papers? They are pieces of my heart.\n\n–\n\nSome often ask help in writing a letter. It’s actually really simple. Once you get the hang of it, you can write letters in minutes and be regular as well. It soon becomes a habit, and you want to write daily. Trust me, it will change your life. It is actually quite simple.\n\n–\n\nFirstly, write Bismillah on the top middle of your paper, whether typed or written. Write your Islamic greeting of peace. After this, have your own person line. For example: My name is —— and describe yourself briefly in one line. Always use this one liner so Hadhur may recognize you. After this send your prayers for Hadhur about his health. Once that is done, have your main body. Keep your letters 3-4 lines only! That way the summarizing team can always get your full message to Hadhur and Hadhur may even read the entire letter himself. Make your writing 16 font and bold. After that write your name, address, and country with postal / zip code. Also add the date if you wish. –\n\nAlways remember that Hadhur (aba) has the highest rank among mankind living today. We should use this blessing of Allah and attain a close relationship with Hadhur. Being physically close to Hadhur is not hard, however being spiritually close is what matters. To get close to Hadhur (aba) spiritually, one needs to get close to God. Writing regularly to Hadhur for prayers for your spirituality, studies and anything else always helps. I hope this has helped ! You can also use hellofax for some free faxes every month. You can al"
