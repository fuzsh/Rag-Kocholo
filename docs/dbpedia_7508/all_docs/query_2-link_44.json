        "text": "Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism. A common complication of prolonged therapy: a report of eight cases\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHawthorne, G.C.; Campbell, N.P.; Geddes, J.S.\n\n1985-06-01\n\nAmiodarone is a widely used antiarrhythmic drug, which contains 75 mg of iodide per 200 mg of active substance. Eight patients receiving long-term amiodarone therapy became hypothyroid. Seven of these patients had no previous history of thyroid dysfunction or goiter. Antithyroid antibodies were absent, and standard perchlorate discharge tests were positive in seven patients when hypothyroidism was diagnosed. In one patient, amiodarone therapy was withdrawn; over the next nine months, the hypothyroidism resolved, and results of the perchlorate discharge test reverted to normal. The authors conclude that amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism is similar to previously described iodide-induced hypothyroidism. It may develop inmoreÂ Â» the absence of a previous history of thyroid disease, and all patients receiving long-term amiodarone therapy should therefore be regularly monitored for hypothyroidism.Â«Â less\n\nAmiodarone induced pneumonitis and hyperthyroidism: case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrabczak, Elzbieta Magdalena; Zielonka, Tadeusz M; WiwaÅa, Joanna; BareÅa, Anna Dagmara; Opuchlik, Andrzej; Potulska, Anna; Ambroziak, Urszula; Chazan, Ryszarda\n\n2008-09-01\n\nAmiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic agent used in life-threatening ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Its long-term use may however lead to several adverse effects, including corneal deposits, liver and thyroid gland dysfunction, lung lesions, bone marrow injury, skin lesions, or neurological abnormalities. The article presents the case of a 56-year-old man with a history of a stroke, who after a few days of amiodarone therapy for an episode of atrial fibrillation was diagnosed with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism and interstitial pulmonary lesions. Clinical and laboratory symptoms of hyperthyroidism and radiographic signs of pulmonary involvement did not occur until several weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone therapy. Differential diagnosis of causes of hyperthyroidism and diseases causing nodular pulmonary lesions did not demonstrate any other pathologies. Empirical antibiotic therapy and administration of thiamazole and high doses of propranolol failed to improve the patient's clinical status. It was not until thiamazole was given in combination with glucocorticosteroids, when a slow relief of hyperthyroidism symptoms and resolution of radiographic pulmonary signs were observed. Based on the presented case, the risk of appearance of 2 serious concomitant adverse effects was demonstrated, even following a short-term amiodarone therapy. This paper also contains an overview of adverse effects which may be encountered during or after therapy with this effective antiarrhythmic agent. It was emphasized how important it is to select patients appropriately, and to monitor potential adverse effects during amiodarone therapy.\n\nAdverse effects of oral amiodarone therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSinha, P R; Dube, S; Sujata; Gupta, P R; Avasthey, P; Somani, P N\n\n1992-04-01\n\nOral amiodarone was administered to 38 patients (25 males, 13 females) with mean age of 43.6 years. Ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias were present in 30 and 8 patients respectively. Amiodarone was given as 400-1200 mg/day for 1-2 weeks as loading dose and then it was maintained as 100-600 mg/day. The mean duration of therapy was 12.4 months. Adverse effects were noted in 21 (55.3%) cases. The commonest adverse effects observed were asymptomatic corneal microdeposits followed by gastrointestinal, cardiac, neurological and cutaneous disturbances. The drug was withdrawn in 2 (5.3%) patients because of nausea and vomiting. One patient died of pulmonary infiltrations. It is concluded that adverse effects are common with amiodarone but are tolerated well, making this drug an excellent choice for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n[Thyroid and treatment with amiodarone diagnosis, therapy and clinical management].\n\nPubMed\n\nMikosch, Peter\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAmiodarone is a frequently used antiarrhythmic drug with a high antiarrhythmic potency. However, beside its antiarrhythmic effects Amiodarone also reveals a variety of adverse effects and drug-related complications. The affected organs include the eyes, skin, lungs, nervous system, liver, gastrointestinal tract and the thyroid. The thyroid is one of the most frequently affected organs by Amiodarone. An altered hormone equilibrium always occurs and has to be distinguished from Amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. The differentiation of these states frequently causes problems and may even be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in certain cases. The article gives an overview on the interactions between Amiodarone and the thyroid, the diagnostic and therapeutic options and management strategies of patient on Amiodarone therapy in the view of thyroid function.\n\nPulmonary hypertension and isolated right heart failure complicating amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism.\n\nPubMed\n\nWong, Sean-Man; Tse, Hung-Fat; Siu, Chung-Wah\n\n2012-03-01\n\nHyperthyroidism is a common side effect encountered in patients prescribed long-term amiodarone therapy for cardiac arrhythmias. We previously studied 354 patients prescribed amiodarone in whom the occurrence of hyperthyroidism was associated with major adverse cardiovascular events including heart failure, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, stroke and even death [1]. We now present a case of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism complicated by isolated right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension that resolved with treatment of hyperthyroidism. Detailed quantitative echocardiography enables improved understanding of the haemodynamic mechanisms underlying the condition.

Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) can develop in patients with an apparently normal thyroid gland or in those with an underlying chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. On a clinical ground, AIH is not challenging and can be easily treated with L-thyroxine therapy. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) can occur in patients with (AIT 1) or without (AIT 2) an underlying thyroid disease. AIT 1 is a true iodine-induced hyperthyroidism occurring in patients with an underlying thyroid autonomy while AIT 2 is a drug-induced destructive thyroiditis. According to the different pathogenetic mechanism, AIT 2 is treated with glucocorticoids while AIT 1 usually responds to thionamides. Thyroidectomy should be considered when AIT represents an imminent risk for cardiac conditions, when patients require a prompt resolution of thyrotoxicosis or when they do not respond to the medical therapy. An effective collaboration between cardiologists and endocrinologists is crucial in each part of the management of AIT patients, including the evaluation of cardiological conditions with regard to thyroid hormone excess and whether, or not, it is necessary to continue amiodarone therapy.\n\n[Amiodarone and thyroid].\n\nPubMed\n\nCapraro, JoÃ«l; Thalmann, SÃ©bastien\n\n2011-06-01\n\nAmiodarone is a widely used antiarrythmic drug and can lead either to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism due to its molecular structure which is similar to levothyroxin. Amiodarone induced hypothyroidism can be treated easely with hormonal subsitution. Hyperthyroidism is more challenging. There exist two forms of amiodarone-induced Hyperthyroidism (AIT): AIT type 1 is directly related to the iodine compound of amiodarone and responds to thyreostatic therapy. Type 2 is a consequence of the direct toxicity of amiodarone to the thyroid gland and is treated primarily with glucocorticoids. However, this differentiation often is impossible in clinical settings and a pragmatic approach is needed.\n\nElbasvir/Grazoprevir, an Alternative in Antiviral Hepatitis C Therapy in Patients under Amiodarone Treatment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWeiss, Lina; Wustmann, Kerstin; Semmo, Mariam; Schwerzmann, Markus; Semmo, Nasser\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA sofosbuvir/ledipasvir combination is part of a first-line treatment of hepatitis C. However, in patients concurrently treated with amiodarone, cardiac side effects have been described, resulting in an official warning in 2015 by the American Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency when combining those substances. This deprived numerous hepatitis C patients with concurrent cardiovascular problems of receiving this highly effective treatment. Here we present a treatment alternative with an elbasvir/grazoprevir regimen, based on our successful treatment of a patient under concurrent amiodarone therapy. Our observations indicate that patients treated with amiodarone can finally benefit from effective antiviral therapy. PMID:29606942\n\nUninhibited thyroidal uptake of radioiodine despite iodine excess in amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWiersinga, W.M.; Touber, J.L.; Trip, M.D.\n\n1986-08-01\n\nIodine excess is associated with a low thyroidal radioiodine uptake due to dilution of the radioisotope by the increased stable iodide pool. We studied thyroidal uptake of radioisotopes in cardiac patients with iodine excess due to amiodarone treatment. /sup 99m/Tc-pertechnetate scintigraphy was performed in 13 patients receiving long term amiodarone therapy. Five patients had a clearly visible thyroid gland, and 8 patients had no or a very faint thyroid image. All patients with positive scans had an increased plasma TSH level, whereas all patients with negative scans had a normal or absent TSH response to TRH. Thyroidal uptake and dischargemoreÂ Â» of 123I were studied in 30 other patients. Group I (n = 11) had normal plasma TSH responses to TRH and no iodine excess, group II (n = 7) had normal TSH responses to TRH and excess iodine from metrizoate angiography in the previous month, group III (n = 7) had normal or decreased TSH responses to TRH while receiving long term amiodarone therapy, and group IV (n = 5) had increased TSH responses to TRH while receiving long term amiodarone therapy. The mean radioiodine uptake value in group I (5.4 +/- 0.8% (+/- SE) at 60 min) was higher than those in group II (2.3 +/- 0.7%; P = 0.009) and group III (0.8 +/- 0.3%; P = 0.0005), but not different from that in group IV (5.3 +/- 1.2%; P = NS). Radioiodine discharge after perchlorate (expressed as a percentage of the 60 min uptake) in group I (10.1 +/- 2.2%) was lower than those in group II (24.9 +/- 10.6%; P = 0.05) and group III (28.8 +/- 5.3%; P less than 0.005), whereas discharge in group IV (58.0 +/- 6.1%) was greater than those in group II (P less than 0.05) and group III (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, 1) thyroid visualization by /sup 99m/Tc-pertechnetate and thyroid radioiodine uptake during iodine excess are decreased in euthyroid and hyperthyroid patients, but preserved in hypothyroid patients.Â«Â less\n\nAmiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis: A review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTsang, Wendy; Houlden, Robyn L\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) develops in 3% of amiodarone-treated patients in North America. AIT is classified as type 1 or type 2. Type 1 AIT occurs in patients with underlying thyroid pathology such as autonomous nodular goiter or Gravesâ disease. Type 2 AIT is a result of amiodarone causing a subacute thyroiditis with release of preformed thyroid hormones into the circulation. OBJECTIVES: To review the literature and present an overview of the differentiation between and management of type 1 and type 2 AIT. METHODS: PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Medscape searches of all available English language articles from 1983 to 2006 were performed. Search terms included âamiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosisâ, âcomplicationsâ, âmanagementâ, âtreatmentâ and âcolour flow Dopper sonographyâ. RESULTS: There is evidence to suggest that to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 AIT, a careful history and physical examination should be performed to identify pre-existing thyroid disease. An iodine-131 uptake test and colour flow Doppler sonography should be performed. Patients with type 2 AIT should receive a trial of glucocorticoids, whereas those with type 1 should receive antithyroid therapy. For patients in whom the mechanism of the thyrotoxicosis is unclear, a combination of prednisone and antithyroid therapy may be considered. PMID:19584973\n\nSevere congestive heart failure patient on amiodarone presenting with myxedemic coma: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaheen, Mazen\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy. Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20% with treatment. The condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine (T4) or intravenous tri-iodo-thyronine (T3). Patients with CHF on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism, and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among CHF patients. The myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among CHF patients presenting with hypotension, weakness or other unexplained symptoms.\n\n[Acute hepatitis following amiodarone administration].\n\nPubMed\n\nTagliamonte, E; Cice, G; Ducceschi, V; Mayer, M S; Iacono, A\n\n1997-09-01\n\nA 61 year old man, treated with amiodarone since 1993 for resistant supraventricular arrhythmias, developed acute hepatitis after an intravenous amiodarone administration. Kidney and liver function tests were performed and pointed out abnormal results. Symptoms ascribable to hepatotoxicity were absent. These changes returned to normal levels within 20 days from withdrawal of the drug. Amiodarone hepatotoxicity can be related to prolonged therapy with a high dose. Intravenous amiodarone may cause acute hepatic disease, but it is suggested that polysorbate 80, a solvent added to the intravenous infusion, is a more likely cause of this complication.\n\nEffect of amiodarone therapy on mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and asymptomatic complex ventricular arrhythmias: Argentine Pilot Study of Sudden Death and Amiodarone (EPAMSA).\n\nPubMed\n\nGarguichevich, J J; Ramos, J L; Gambarte, A; Gentile, A; Hauad, S; Scapin, O; Sirena, J; Tibaldi, M; Toplikar, J\n\n1995-09-01\n\nThe efficiency of prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone in reducing 1-year mortality in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction ( < 35%) and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias (Lown classes 2 and 4) was investigated in a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled study. Among 127 patients who entered the study, 61 were assigned to no antiarrhythmic therapy (control group [CG] and 66 to amiodarone treatment (amiodarone group [AG]). Amiodarone was administered at a dosage of 800 mg/day for 2 weeks followed by 400 mg/day thereafter. A 12-month follow-up was completed for 106 patients (57 in the AG and 49 in the CG). Amiodarone reduced the overall mortality rate, which was 10.5% in the AG versus 28.6% in the CG (odds ratio [OR] 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10 to 0.84; log-rank test 0.02) and sudden death rate, which was 7.0% in the AG versus 20.4% in the CG (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00; log-rank test 0.04). Side effects were rare, and in only three patients did amiodarone treatment have to be discontinued.\n\n[Prevention of recurrent amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism by iodine-131].\n\nPubMed\n\nHermida, J S; Jarry, G; Tcheng, E; Moullart, V; Arlot, S; Rey, J L; Schvartz, C\n\n2004-03-01\n\nAmioradone-induced hyperthyroidism is a common complication of amiodarone therapy. Although definitive interruption of amiodarone is recommended because of the risks of aggravation of the arrhythmias, some patients may require the reintroduction of amiodarone several months after normalisation of thyroid function. The authors undertook a retrospective study of the effects of preventive treatment of recurrences of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism with I131. The indication of amiodarone therapy was recurrent, symptomatic, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in 13 cases and ventricular tachycardia in 5 cases (M = 14, average age 64 +/- 13 years). The underlying cardiac disease was dilated cardiomyopathy (N = 5), ischaemic heart disease (N = 3), hypertensive heart disease (N = 2), arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (N = 2) or valvular heart disease (N = 2). Two patients had idiopathic atrial fibrillation. An average dose of 576 +/- 184 MBq of I131 was administered 34 +/- 37 months after an episode of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone was reintroduced in 16 of the 18 patients after a treatment-free period of 98 +/- 262 days. Transient post-radioiodine hyperthyroidism was observed in 3 cases (17%). Sixteen patients (89%) developed hypothyroidism requiring replacement therapy with L-thyroxine. There were no recurrences of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. After 24 +/- 17 months follow-up, the arrhythmias were controlled in 13 of the 16 patients (81%) who underwent the whole treatment sequence. The authors conclude that preventive treatment with I131 is an effective alternative to prevent recurrence of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism in patients requiring reintroduction of amiodarone to control their arrhythmias.\n\nAmiodarone-induced myxoedema coma.\n\nPubMed\n\nHassan, Syed; Ayoub, Walaa; Hassan, Mona; Wisgerhof, Max\n\n2014-04-12\n\nA 62-year-old man was found to have bradycardia, hypothermia and respiratory failure 3 weeks after initiation of amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation.

PMID:24729111\n\nLong-Term Opioid Therapy Reconsidered\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVon Korff, Michael; Kolodny, Andrew; Deyo, Richard A.; Chou, Roger\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn the past 20 years, primary care physicians have greatly increased prescribing of long-term opioid therapy. However, the rise in opioid prescribing has outpaced the evidence regarding this practice. Increased opioid availability has been accompanied by an epidemic of opioid abuse and overdose. The rate of opioid addiction among patients receiving long-term opioid therapy remains unclear, but research suggests that opioid misuse is not rare. Recent studies report increased risks for serious adverse events, including fractures, cardiovascular events, and bowel obstruction, although further research on medical risks is needed. New data indicate that opioid-related risks may increase with dose. From a societal perspective, higher-dose regimens account for the majority of opioids dispensed, so cautious dosing may reduce both diversion potential and patient risks for adverse effects. Limiting long-term opioid therapy to patients for whom it provides decisive benefits could also reduce risks. Given the warning signs and knowledge gaps, greater caution and selectivity are needed in prescribing long-term opioid therapy. Until stronger evidence becomes available, clinicians should err on the side of caution when considering this treatment. PMID:21893626\n\nAmiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis Recurrence After Amiodarone Reintroduction.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaqdasy, Salwan; Batisse-Lignier, Marie; Auclair, Candy; Desbiez, FranÃ§oise; Citron, Bernard; Thieblot, Philippe; Roche, BÃ©atrice; Lusson, Jean RenÃ©; Tauveron, Igor\n\n2016-04-01\n\nReintroduction of amiodarone in patients with a history of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is rarely used. To date, the risk of AIT recurrence after amiodarone reintroduction is unpredicted. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk of AIT recurrence. Retrospectively, from 2000 to 2011, all euthyroid patients with a history of AIT with amiodarone reintroduction were included. Type and severity of the first AIT, amiodarone chronology, and thyroid function evolution after reintroduction of amiodarone were investigated: 46 of 172 patients with AIT history needed amiodarone reintroduction. At first AIT episode, the mean age was 62.2 Â± 16 years with male gender predominance; 65% of patients were classified as type 1 AIT. AIT recurred in 14 patients (30%), 12 patients developed hypothyroidism (26%), and 20 patients remained euthyroid (44%). Characteristics of type 1 AIT during the first episode, namely briefer exposure period to amiodarone and longer duration of treatment to normalize thyroid hormones, were predictive of AIT recurrence; 73% of patients (8 of 11) with previous episode of type 1 AIT, who did not receive a preventive thioamide treatment, developed a second episode of AIT. Thioamide preventive treatment could be useful to prevent type 1 AIT recurrence. In conclusion, AIT recurrence after amiodarone reintroduction is 4 times more frequent in patients with type 1 AIT history. Thyroid ablation before amiodarone reintroduction in patients with a history of type 1 AIT is preferred. Preventive thioamide treatment could be suggested in patients with type 1 AIT history pending for surgery. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is usually mild and delayed onset. Acute hepatotoxicity is a rare side effect and usually correlated to intravenous form use. In this case, acute hepatocellular injury occurred within 24 hours after the administration of intravenous amiodarone. Liver enzyme significantly improved after holding intravenous amiodarone use. Because ventricular arrhythmia persisted and side effects occurred to alternative therapy, low dose of oral amiodarone was resumed and hepatotoxicity did not occur afterward. Acute hepatotoxicity of intravenous amiodarone is possibly related to polysorbate 80, the solubilizer of amiodarone infusion or higher dose. As a result, when intravenous amiodarone is prescribed, closely monitoring liver enzyme is highly suggested. If acute hepatitis takes place secondary to intravenous amiodarone, oral therapy should not be resumed afterward. If there is no alternative treatment, lower dose of oral amiodarone (â¤200 mg/d) could be tried and should monitor liver function regularly.\n\nHepatotoxicity after continuous amiodarone infusion in a postoperative cardiac infant.\n\nPubMed\n\nKicker, Jennifer S; Haizlip, Julie A; Buck, Marcia L\n\n2012-04-01\n\nA former 34-week-old female infant with Down syndrome underwent surgical correction of a congenital heart defect at 5 months of age. Her postoperative course was complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension and junctional ectopic tachycardia. Following treatment with amiodarone infusion, she developed laboratory indices of acute liver injury. At their peak, liver transaminase levels were 19 to 35 times greater than the upper limit of normal. Transaminitis was accompanied by coagulopathy, hyperammonemia, and high serum lactate and lipid levels. Hepatic laboratory abnormalities began to resolve within 48 hr of stopping amiodarone infusion. Heart rate control was achieved concurrently with discovery of laboratory test result abnormalities, and no further antiarrhythmic therapy was required. The intravenous formulation of amiodarone contains the diluent polysorbate 80, which may have hepatotoxic effects. Specifically, animal studies suggest that polysorbate 80 may destabilize cell membranes and predispose to fatty change within liver architecture. Polysorbate was implicated in infant fatalities from E-ferol use in the 1980s. This case illustrates a possible adverse event by the Naranjo probability scale. Given the extent of clinically apparent hepatic injury, this patient was not rechallenged with amiodarone during the remainder of her hospitalization. With amiodarone now used as first-line pharmacologic therapy for critical tachyarrhythmia in this population, the number of children exposed to this drug should be expected to increase. Laboratory indices of liver function should be evaluated at initiation of amiodarone therapy, as well as frequently throughout duration of therapy. Consideration should be given to polysorbate-free formulation of intravenous amiodarone for use in the cohort with congenital cardiac disease.\n\nHepatotoxicity After Continuous Amiodarone Infusion in a Postoperative Cardiac Infant\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKicker, Jennifer S.; Haizlip, Julie A.; Buck, Marcia L.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA former 34-week-old female infant with Down syndrome underwent surgical correction of a congenital heart defect at 5 months of age.

We sought to determine the long-term outcomes of VT control and need for antiarrhythmic drug therapy after endocardial (ENDO) and adjuvant epicardial (EPI) substrate modification in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. We examined 62 consecutive patients with Task Force criteria for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy referred for VT ablation with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Catheter ablation was guided by activation/entrainment mapping for tolerated VT and pacemapping/targeting of abnormal substrate for unmappable VT. Adjuvant EPI ablation was performed when recurrent VT or persistent inducibility after ENDO-only ablation. Endocardial plus adjuvant EPI ablation was performed in 39 (63%) patients, including 13 who crossed over to ENDO-EPI after VT recurrence during follow-up, after ENDO-only ablation. Before ablation, 54 of 62 patients failed a mean of 2.4 antiarrhythmic drugs, including amiodarone in 29 (47%) patients. During follow-up of 56Â±44 months after the last ablation, VT-free survival was 71% with only a single VT episode in additional 9 patients (15%). At last follow-up, 39 (64%) patients were only on Î²-blockers or no treatment, 21 were on class 1 or 3 antiarrhythmic drugs (11 for atrial arrhythmias), and 2 were on amiodarone as a bridge to heart transplantation. The long-term outcome after ENDO and adjuvant EPI substrate ablation of VT in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is good. Most patients have complete VT control without amiodarone therapy and limited need for antiarrhythmic drugs.

Current reports of amiodarone associated optic neuropathy identified from the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA-AERS) and published case reports were reviewed. A total of 296 reports were identified: 214 from AERS, 59 from published case reports, and 23 from adverse events reports for patients enrolled in clinical trials. Mean duration of amiodarone therapy before vision loss was 9 months (range 1-84 months). Insidious onset of amiodarone associated optic neuropathy (44%) was the most common presentation, and nearly one-third were asymptomatic. Optic disc edema was present in 85% of cases. Following drug cessation, 58% had improved visual acuity, 21% were unchanged, and 21% had further decreased visual acuity. Legal blindness (< 20/200) was noted in at least one eye in 20% of cases. Close ophthalmologic surveillance of patients during the tenure of amiodarone administration is warranted.

Review of relevant literature. In the 1970s and 1980s a plethora of new antiarrhythmic agents, including amiodarone, was introduced. Amiodarone is predominately a class III antiarrhythmic, but also possesses class I, II, and IV effects. By 1977 it was described as the ideal antiarrhythmic agent. However, clinicians underestimated potential difficulties caused by misunderstanding its variable absorption, slow initial response at nonloading dosages, and extended half-life. Elevated dosages also produced frequent adverse effects. Thus, early enthusiasm for the drug's efficacy was gradually replaced by a focus on its toxicity. The 1990s witnessed reacceptance of the agent as more logical initial regimens and lower maintenance dosages decreased adverse effects, and amiodarone emerged as one of the few drugs effective in suppressing and preventing arrhythmias that does not increase mortality. Remaining challenges include delineation of an optimal oral regimen, identification of markers useful in clinical monitoring, and elucidation of the relationship between dose-tissue concentration and response and dose-toxicity associations. Amiodarone is an increasingly valuable component of today's antiarrhythmic therapy.\n\nAmiodarone induced myxedema coma: Two case reports and literature review.\n\nPubMed\n\nHawatmeh, Amer; Thawabi, Mohammad; Abuarqoub, Ahmad; Shamoon, Fayez\n\n2018-05-21\n\nAmiodarone is a benzofuran derivative that contains 37% iodine by weight and is structurally similar to the thyroid hormones. Amiodarone has a complex effect on the thyroid gland, ranging from abnormalities of thyroid function tests to overt thyroid dysfunction, with either thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. Myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone use has been rarely reported in the literature. Our two case reports are an add on to the literature, and illustrate that amiodarone is an important cause of thyroid dysfunction including hypothyroidism and myxedema coma. Hence, healthcare providers should have a high index of suspicion for these conditions while treating patients who are taking amiodarone therapy as early recognition and management are essential to optimize outcomes.

We report two cases of bilateral optic nerve neuropathy due to amiodarone, and provide a detailed description of the disease. The first case was a 59-year-old man complaining from insidious monocular loss of vision within ten months of initiating amiodarone. Funduscopy and optical coherence tomography showed bilateral optic disc edema. The second case was a 72-year-old man presenting with a decrease in visual acuity in his left eye for a month. Funduscopy showed a left optic nerve edema, and fluorescein angiography showed bilateral papillitis. In both cases, the clinical presentation was not suggestive of ischemic neuropathy, because of the preservation of visual acuity and the insidious onset. In addition, both cardiovascular and inflammatory work-up were normal. An amiodarone-associated neuropathy was suspected, and amiodarone was discontinued with the approval of the cardiologist, with complete regression of the papilledema and a stabilization of visual symptoms. Differentiating between amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy may be complicated by the cardiovascular background of such patients. The major criterion is the absence of a severe decrease in visual acuity; other criteria are the normality of cardiovascular and inflammatory work-up, and the improvement or the absence of worsening of symptoms after discontinuation of amiodarone. Amiodarone-associated neuropathy remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and requires amiodarone discontinuation, which can only be done with the approval of a cardiologist, and sometimes requires replacement therapy.

It displays a wide cellular electrophysiological spectrum largely similar to amiodarone, inhibiting the potassium currents I(Kr), I(Ks), I(KI), I(KACh), and I(sus), as well as sodium currents and L-type calcium currents in isolated cardiomyocytes. In addition, dronedarone exhibits antiadrenergic properties. In vivo, dronedarone has been shown to be more effective than amiodarone in several arrhythmia models, particularly in preventing ischemia- and reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation and in reducing mortality. However, an increased incidence of torsades de pointes with dronedarone in dogs shows that possible proarrhythmic effects of dronedarone require further evaluation. The clinical trails DAFNE, EURIDIS, and ADONIS indicated safety, antiarrhythmic efficacy and low proarrhythmic potential of the drug in low-risk patients. In contrast, the increased incidence of death in the dronedarone group of the discontinued ANDROMEDA trial raises safety concerns for patients with congestive heart failure and moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction. Dronedarone appears to be effective in preventing relapses of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Torsades de pointes, the most severe adverse effect associated with amiodarone, has not yet been reported in humans with dronedarone. Unlike amiodarone, dronedarone had little effect on thyroid function and hormone levels in animal models and had no significant effects on human thyroid function in clinical trials. In conclusion, dronedarone could be a useful drug for prevention of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter relapses in low-risk patients. However, further experimental studies and long-term clinical trials are required to provide additional evidence of efficacy and safety of dronedarone.\n\nThree cases of severe acute hepatitis after parenteral administration of amiodarone: the active ingredient is not the only agent responsible for hepatotoxicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nGiannattasio, Francesco; Salvio, Antonio; Varriale, Maria; Picciotto, Francesco Paolo; Di Costanzo, Giovan Giuseppe; Visconti, Mario\n\n2002-01-01\n\nAmiodarone is one of the most effective antiarrhythmic drugs available and is widely prescribed despite several potentially life-threatening side-effects. Hepatotoxicity is the most frequent one during long-term oral therapy: occasionally acute hepatitis necessitates the suspension of treatment but monitoring of a transient increase in serum aminotransferases is usually sufficient; the clinical-morphological pictures of liver cirrhosis have also been reported. Fulminant hepatitis soon after a parenteral load of the drug is far less well described in the literature. Most published cases were reversible after the suspension of treatment. A negative challenge after oral amiodarone exposure suggested that polysorbate 80, a solvent added to the intravenous infusion and already implied in the pathogenesis of a similar syndrome observed in infants, is a more likely cause of this complication. The occurrence of acute hepatitis complicating parenteral amiodarone treatment does not preclude subsequent oral use of the drug: an evidence-based therapeutic behavior now definitively consolidated. Because of the rarity of this diagnosis, we report 3 cases of short-term hepatotoxicity secondary to amiodarone treatment for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias: in 2 male patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in a female with liver disease. The diagnosis was presumptive and based on a thorough drug history, the temporal relationship, the time-course of liver dysfunction, the exclusion of other causes and on the rapid improvement observed after parenteral amiodarone withdrawal in 2 cases; in no case could we find any other explanation for the liver damage. Since amiodarone is sometimes still an irreplaceable antiarrhythmic drug, we raise the question of whether careful and continuous vigilance should be mandatory in patients receiving the drug or whether it is possible to introduce a pharmaceutical preparation not containing the vehicle that induces acute liver toxicity.\n\nIs the Preoperative Administration of Amiodarone or Metoprolol More Effective in Reducing Atrial Fibrillation: After Coronary Bypass Surgery?\n\nPubMed\n\nOnk, Oruc Alper; Erkut, Bilgehan\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThis study examined the influence of preoperative administration of amiodarone and metoprolol in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.The study comprised 251 patients who underwent CABG surgery at our hospital between January 2012 and May 2014. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: amiodarone therapy group (nâ=â122 patients) and metoprolol therapy group (nâ=â129 patients).In the amiodarone group, the patients received amiodarone tablet orally 1 week before coronary bypass surgery and during the postoperative period. In the metoprolol group, the patients received metoprolol tablet orally 1 week before surgery and during the postoperative period. The AF development rate was retrospectively evaluated between the first 3 days and 4 weeks after surgery.AF developed in 14 patients in the amiodarone group and 16 patients in the metoprolol group 4 weeks after the operation (Pâ=â0.612).No significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of intensive care unit and hospital stay. Furthermore, hospital charges were similar in both groups (Pâ=â0.741).The results of the logistic regression analysis showed age, left ventricular ejection fraction, left atrial diameter, and aortic cross-clamping time to be predictors for postoperative AF.This study demonstrates that amiodarone and metoprolol have similar effects in prevention of AF after cardiac surgery. However, larger-scale studies need to be conducted to substantiate these findings.\n\nEffect of intravenous amiodarone on QT and T peak-T end dispersions in patients with nonischemic heart failure treated with cardiac resynchronization-defibrillator therapy and electrical storm.\n\nPubMed\n\nOgiso, Masataka; Suzuki, Atsushi; Shiga, Tsuyoshi; Nakai, Kenji; Shoda, Morio; Hagiwara, Nobuhisa\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe effect of intravenous amiodarone on spatial and transmural dispersion of ventricular repolarization in patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) remains unclear. We studied 14 patients with nonischemic heart failure who received CRT with a defibrillator, experienced electrical storm and were treated with intravenous amiodarone. Each patient underwent 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) and 187-channel repolarization interval-difference mapping electrocardiography (187-ch RIDM-ECG) before and during the intravenous administration of amiodarone infusion. A recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia was observed in 2 patients during the early period of intravenous amiodarone therapy. Intravenous amiodarone increased the corrected QT interval (from 470Â±52Â ms to 508Â±55Â ms, P=0.003), but it significantly decreased the QT dispersion (from 107Â±35Â ms to 49Â±27Â ms, P=0.001), T peak-T end (Tp-e) dispersion (from 86Â±17Â ms to 28Â±28Â ms, P=0.001), and maximum inter-lead difference between corrected Tp-e intervals as measured by using the 187-ch RIDM-ECG (from 83Â±13Â ms to 50Â±19Â ms, P=0.001). Intravenous amiodarone suppressed the electrical storm and decreased the QT and Tp-e dispersions in patients treated by using CRT with a defibrillator.\n\nEffect of antiarrhythmic therapy with intravenous loading dose of amiodarone: evidence for an altered response in diabetic patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nIervasi, G; Clerico, A; Bonini, R; Nannipieri, M; Manfredi, C; Sabatino, L; Biagini, A; Donato, L\n\n1998-01-01\n\nAmiodarone, a potent class III antiarrhythmic agent with adrenergic antagonism properties, is administered increasingly to diabetic patients with cardiac arrhythmias refractory to all other available forms of therapy. Because a large percentage of diabetic patients show a perturbed autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system, including a pertubed regulation of heart rate, we studied the antiarrhythmic response as well as the early effects (within 5 days) on heart rate of an intravenous amiodarone loading dose in diabetic patients. Seven type II (noninsulin-dependent) diabetic patients (age 64.7 +/- 9.7 years), affected by uncontrolled atrial fibrilation or atrial flutter, were enrolled for the study and a group of 12 well-matched (for age, sex and arrhythmia) nondiabetic patients served as a control group. It was found that before amiodarone administration, nondiabetic patients showed significantly wider variations in the circadian rhythm of heart rate values than diabetic patients (p = 0.0062, unpaired t-test). In all patients but one (who was nondiabetic), amiodarone treatment resulted in a cardioversion to sinus rhythm. After amiodarone administration, nondiabetic patients showed a significantly greater decrease (p = 0.0011) in heart rate values in comparison with the diabetic group (-35% vs. -20% on average, at the end of the study). Furthermore, in nondiabetic patients there was also an earlier significant fall (within the first 4 h after the start of treatment with amiodarone, p < 0.001) in the heart rate values in comparison with diabetic patients, in whom a significant decrease (p < 0.001) was found only at the 4th day. A significant (p = 0.0004), more rapid onset of the antiarrhythmic response to the drug was found in nondiabetic patients (6.8 +/- 6.0 h) in comparison with diabetic patients (98.0 +/- 14.8 h). Our findings suggest that the antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone in diabetic patients with uncontrolled atrial fibrilation or atrial flutter\n\nAmiodarone in the treatment of refractory supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWheeler, P. J.; Ingram, D. V.; Puritz, R.; Chamberlain, D. A.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nAmiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent unrelated to other drugs in current use. It has been little used in Britain, and no formal clinical trials have been possible because the drug has not been licensed by the Committee on Safety of Medicines. Nevertheless it has unique properties which can be valuable in the treatment of a wide spectrum of arrhythmias, particularly supraventricular tachycardias. Amiodarone has a slow onset of action and is cumulative. A sustained action is therefore achieved without the need for frequent maintenance dosage. Fifty patients have been treated with amiodarone in maintenance doses ranging from 200 mg on alternate days to 200 mg twice daily either alone, or in combination with conventional therapy. All were resistant to conventional therapy alone or could not be treated with usual agents because of unwanted drug effects. Of 27 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, 18 were completely controlled and the other 9 were markedly improved. Six of 8 patients with recurrent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias were well controlled symptomatically. Results were predictably less satisfactory in 15 high risk post-infarction patients with malignant arrhythmias and severe myocardial damage, but 6 were probably improved as a result of amiodarone. All patients on maintenance therapy for 3 months or more developed corneal microdeposits. None has any visual symptoms or other ocular defect, and treatment has not been curtailed as a result of this well recognized effect which is believed to be reversible and benign. Amiodarone can control patients with otherwise refractory arrhythmias including some which are life-threatening. Formal clinical trials are needed to define accurately its future role in the prevention and treatment of serious rhythm disorders of the heart.

'Apical rocking' is observed in asynchronously contracting ventricles and is associated with echocardiographic response to CRT. The association of apical rocking and long-term clinical outcome is however unknown at present. We assessed the predictive value of left ventricular (LV) apical rocking on a long-term clinical outcome in patients treated with CRT. Consecutive heart failure patients treated with primary indication for CRT-D between 2005 and 2009 were included in a prospective registry. Echocardiography was performed prior to CRT to assess apical rocking, defined as motion of the LV apical myocardium perpendicular to the LV long axis. Major adverse cardiac event (MACE) was defined as combined end point of cardiac death and/or heart failure hospitalization and/or appropriate therapy (ATP and/or ICD shocks). All echocardiograms were assessed by independent cardiologists, blinded for clinical data. Multivariable analyses were performed to adjust for potential confounders. Two hundred and ninety-five patients with echocardiography prior to implantation were included in the final analyses. Apical rocking was present in 45% of the study patients. Apical rocking was significantly more common in younger patients, females, patients with sinus rhythm, non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, and in patients with LBBB and wider QRS duration. During a mean clinical follow-up of 5.2 Â± 1.6 years, 92 (31%) patients reached the end point of the study (MACE). Patients with MACE had shorter QRS duration, had more ischaemic cardiomyopathy, and were more often on Amiodarone. In univariate analyses, MACE was associated with shorter QRS duration, ischaemic aetiology, and the absence of apical rocking. After multivariable analyses, apical rocking was associated with less MACE (hazards ratio, HR 0.44, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.25-0.77).

If the treatment needs to be interrupted, iodine remains at abnormal levels for months or even years. The aim of the study was to review the literature regarding the optimal tests for early diagnostic and to analyze the role of nuclear medicine tests in the differential and correct assessment of the amiodarone-induced thyroid pathology. We made a review of available publications in PUBMED referring the amiodaroneinduced thyroid pathology, focusing on the differential diagnosis, made by nuclear medicine tests, of hypothyroidism (AIH) and hyperthyroidism expressed as: type I amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT I), type II amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT II), and less frequently as a mixt form, type III amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT III). We presented cases from the database of a tertiary center in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Despite the frequent complication of thyroid function, this pathology is underestimated and diagnosed. There is a limited number of studies and clear protocols, especially in the mixed forms cases. This increase in iodine uptake interferes seriously with thyroid hormone production and release. The nuclear medicine tests are essential in the correct assessment and differential diagnosis of different forms of induced thyroid dysfunction. The destruction of the follicular cells can result in the release of excessive thyroid hormone into the circulation, with potential development of atrial fibrillation, worsening the cardiac disease, so any benefic therapeutic procedure should be known; the use of radioiodine as therapy alternative, despite the known limitations induced by blockade was clear benefic in the case presented. A special attention needs to be addressed to those patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, which will be submitted to radioiodine therapy and\n\nDronedarone: an amiodarone analogue.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoggrell, Sheila A; Hancox, Jules C\n\n2004-04-01\n\nOf the antiarrhythmic drugs in current use, amiodarone is one of the most effective and is associated with a comparatively low risk of drug-induced pro-arrhythmia, probably due to its multiple pharmacological actions on cardiac ion channels and receptors. However, amiodarone is associated with significant extra-cardiac side effects and this has driven development of amiodarone analogues. These analogues include short acting analogues (e.g., AT-2001) with similar acute effects to amiodarone, the thyroid receptor antagonist KB-130015 and dronedarone. Dronedarone, (SR-33589; Sanofi-Synthelabo), is a non-iodinated amiodarone derivative that inhibits Na +, K + and Ca 2+ currents. It is a potent inhibitor of the acetylcholine-activated K + current from atrial and sinoatrial nodal tissue, and inhibits the rapid delayed rectifier more potently than slow and inward rectifier K + currents and inhibits L-type calcium current. Dronedarone is an antagonist at alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors and unlike amiodarone, has little effect at thyroid receptors. Dronedarone is more potent than amiodarone in inhibiting arrhythmias and death in animal models of ischaemia- and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. In the Dronedarone Atrial Fibrillation Study After Electrical Cardioversion (DAFNE) clinical trial, dronedarone 800 mg/day appeared to be effective and safe for the prevention of atrial fibrillation relapses after cardioversion. The Antiarrhythmic Trial with Dronedarone in Moderate-to-Severe Congestive Heart Failure Evaluating Morbidity Decrease (ANDROMEDA) trial was stopped due to a potential increased risk of death in the dronedarone group. Trials of dronedarone in the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation and a safety and tolerability study in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator are ongoing. Further experimental and clinical studies are required before we have a definitive answer to whether dronedarone has advantages over amiodarone and\n\nPreoperative therapeutic apheresis for severe medically refractory amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamamoto, Jennifer; Dostmohamed, Hanifa; Schacter, Isanne; Ariano, Robert E; Houston, Donald S; Lewis, Brenda; Knoll, Colleen; Katz, Pamela; Zarychanski, Ryan\n\n2014-06-01\n\nAmiodarone is associated with thyroid dysfunction and life-threatening thyrotoxicosis. In medically refractory cases, or where medical therapy is contraindicated, thyroidectomy may be required. To decrease perioperative thyroid storm and to reduce overall surgical risk, apheresis may be considered preoperatively to restore euthyroidism. We report a 46-year-old female with a history of cardiac arrhythmia and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy for which she received amiodarone. Months after discontinuation of amiodarone, the patient presented with wide complex tachycardia and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. Laboratory testing confirmed severe thyrotoxicosis which was subsequently refractory to medical therapy. Total thyroidectomy was required. Following a total of 10 apheresis treatments, thyroid hormone levels were reduced to near normal levels and the patient's symptoms improved. Thyroidectomy was performed without intraoperative or postoperative complication. In the setting of life-threatening, medically refractory amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, therapeutic apheresis can effectively reduce thyroid hormone levels and restore a state of clinical and biochemical euthyroidism.

The authors present a retrospective analysis of ten patients with amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction. Six patients were female and mean amiodarone intake was 17.7 months. HPOIA was more common (six patients). From all the patients with HPEAI, two had type 2, one had type 1, and one had type 3 hyperthyroidism. Symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction occurred in five patients, most of them with HPOAI. In HPEAI, the most frequent symptom was exacerbation of arrhythmia (three patients). Discontinuation of amiodarone and treatment with levothyroxine was chosen in 83.3% of the HPOAI cases, while thyonamide treatment with corticosteroids and without amiodarone was the option in 75% of the HPEAI cases. There were three deaths, all in patients with HPEAI. HPEAI is potentially fatal.

An important clinical consideration is its long-term effectiveness. This research aims to study the long-term expression and effectiveness of gene therapy in promoting spiral ganglion neuron survival after deafness. Adenoviral vectors modified to express brain derived neurotrophic factor or neurotrophin-3 were unilaterally injected into the guinea pig cochlea one week post ototoxic deafening. After six months, persistence of gene expression and significantly greater neuronal survival in neurotrophin-treated cochleae compared to the contralateral cochleae were observed. The long-term gene expression observed indicates that gene therapy is potentially viable; however the degeneration of the transduced cells as a result of the original ototoxic insult may limit clinical effectiveness. With further research aimed at transducing stable cochlear cells, gene therapy may be an efficacious way to introduce neurotrophins to promote neuronal survival after hearing loss.\n\nCost-effectiveness of cardioversion and antiarrhythmic therapy in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.\n\nPubMed\n\nCatherwood, E; Fitzpatrick, W D; Greenberg, M L; Holzberger, P T; Malenka, D J; Gerling, B R; Birkmeyer, J D\n\n1999-04-20\n\nPhysicians managing patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation must consider the risks, benefits, and costs of treatments designed to restore and maintain sinus rhythm compared with those of rate control with antithrombotic prophylaxis.

Therapeutic strategies using different combinations of cardioversion alone, cardioversion plus amiodarone or quinidine therapy, and rate control with antithrombotic treatment. Expected costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness. Strategies involving cardioversion alone were more effective and less costly than those not involving this option. For patients at high risk for ischemic stroke (5.3% per year), cardioversion alone followed by repeated cardioversion plus amiodarone therapy on relapse was most cost-effective ($9300 per QALY) compared with cardioversion alone followed by warfarin therapy on relapse. This strategy was also preferred for the moderate-risk cohort (3.6% per year), but the benefit was more expensive ($18,900 per QALY). In the lowest-risk cohort (1.6% per year), cardioversion alone followed by aspirin therapy on relapse was optimal. The choice of optimal strategy and incremental cost-effectiveness was substantially influenced by the baseline risk for stroke, rate of stroke in sinus rhythm, efficacy of warfarin, and costs and utilities for long-term warfarin and amiodarone therapy. Cardioversion alone should be the initial management strategy for persistent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

Factors associated with the onset time of AIT were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. The median onset time of thyrotoxicosis was 3.5 months (95% CI 2-6 months) in patients with type 1 AIT (AIT1) and 30 months (95% CI 27-32 months, P<0.001) in those with type 2 AIT (AIT2). Of the total number of patients, 5% with AIT1 and 23% with AIT2 (P=0.007) developed thyrotoxicosis after amiodarone withdrawal. Factors affecting the onset time of thyrotoxicosis were the type of AIT and thyroid volume (TV). The different pathogenic mechanisms of the two forms of AIT account for different onset times of thyrotoxicosis in the two groups. Patients with preexisting thyroid abnormalities (candidate to develop AIT1) may require a stricter follow-up during amiodarone therapy than those usually recommended. In AIT1, the onset of thyrotoxicosis after amiodarone withdrawal is rare, while AIT2 patients may require periodic tests for thyroid function longer after withdrawing amiodarone.

We present a case of an 88-year-old man with history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and severely depressed left ventricular function that was admitted to our coronary care unit with diagnosis of decompensated heart failure and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. A few hours after the beginning of intravenous amiodarone he developed an acute hepatitis. There was a completely recovery within the next days after amiodarone withdrawn and other causes of acute hepatitis have been ruled out. This case highlights the need for close monitoring of hepatic function during amiodarone infusion in order to identify any potential hepatotoxicity and prevent a fatal outcome. Oral amiodarone is, apparently, a safe option in these patients.\n\nAmiodarone causes endothelium-dependent vasodilation in human hand veins in vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrossman, M; Dobrev, D; Kirch, W\n\n1998-09-01\n\nAmiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic agent, is a potent coronary vasodilator. However, direct evidence for its vasodilatory effects in human vasculature in vivo is not available. The aim of the study was to investigate the short-term effects of amiodarone in preconstricted human hand veins and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Thirty-one healthy male volunteers were studied with the use of the dorsal hand vein compliance technique. The hand veins of the subjects were preconstricted with the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine, and amiodarone, inhibitors of nitric oxide formation (NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, L-NMMA), and adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channels (glyburide [INN, glibenclamide]) were infused in the presence or absence of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (acetylsalicylic acid), and the venodilator effect was measured. Furthermore, amiodarone was infused in prostaglandin F2 alpha (dinoprost)-preconstricted hand veins. Amiodarone produced dose-dependent venodilation (51% +/- 3% maximum). Maximum amiodarone-induced venodilation was lower in dinoprost compared with phenylephrine-preconstricted veins. Pretreatment with acetylsalicylic acid reduced the amiodarone-induced venodilation by 40% +/- 6%. L-NMMA reduced the amiodarone-induced venodilation after pretreatment with acetylsalicylic acid by 72% +/- 3%. Glyburide decreased the venodilatory response of amiodarone by 31% +/- 11%, whereas only a slight but not statistically significant additional reduction in venodilation was detected after pretreatment with acetylsalicylic acid. Infusion of the solvents of commercially available amiodarone (polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol) did not cause vasodilation in phenylephrine-preconstricted veins. Amiodarone dilates preconstricted human hand veins in vivo and acts as a venodilator through the cyclooxygenase pathway, activation of nitric oxide synthase, and blockade of alpha adrenergic mechanisms.\n\nAcute epigastric and low back pain during amiodarone infusion; is it the drug or the vehicle to blame?\n\nPubMed\n\nPetrou, Emmanouil; Iakovou, Ioannis; Boutsikou, Maria; Girasis, Chrysafios; Mavrogeni, Sophie; Pavlides, Gregory\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAmiodarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent used for cardioversion and prevention of recurrences of atrial fibrillation. However, its use is limited due to its side-effects resulting from the drug's long-term administration. We have described acute epigastric pain following treatment with intravenous amiodarone for atrial fibrillation in a previous report. Hereby, we describe a second patient who suffered acute epigastric pain, as well as one who suffered acute low back pain. Intravenous amiodarone has been related to a series of minor and major adverse reactions, indicating other constituents of the intravenous solution as the possible cause, possibly polysorbate-80. A possible correlation between acute epigastric and low back pain after intravenous amiodarone loading is unproven; however it is of crucial importance for clinicians to be aware of this phenomenon, and especially since an acute epigastric pain is implicated in the differential diagnosis of cardiac ischemia.

Objectives To determine the incidence and factors contributing to the development of amiodarone-induced phlebitis in the coronary care unit in an academic medical center and to refine the current practice protocol. Medical records from all adult patients during an 18-month period who received intravenous amiodarone while in the critical care unit were reviewed retrospectively. Route of administration, location, concentration, and duration of amiodarone therapy and factors associated with occurrence of phlebitis were examined. Descriptive statistics and regression methods were used to identify incidence and phlebitis factors. In the final sample of 105 patients, incidence of phlebitis was 40%, with a 50% recurrence rate. All cases of phlebitis occurred in patients given a total dose of 3 g via a peripheral catheter, and one-quarter of these cases (n = 10) developed at dosages less than 1 g. Pain, redness, and warmth were the most common indications of phlebitis. Total dosage given via a peripheral catheter, duration of infusion, and number of catheters were significantly associated with phlebitis. Amiodarone-induced phlebitis occurred in 40% of this sample at higher drug dosages. A new practice protocol resulted from this study. An outcome study is in progress.\n\nCyclosporine therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: short-term and long-term results.\n\nPubMed\n\nGurudu, S R; Griffel, L H; Gialanella, R J; Das, K M\n\n1999-09-01\n\nIntravenous cyclosporine therapy followed by oral cyclosporine therapy reduce the need for urgent surgery in steroid-refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our objective is to report short- and long-term results of cyclosporine therapy in IBD patients. Thirteen patients with steroid-refractory IBD, seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and six patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were treated with intravenous cyclosporine (4 mg/kg/day) for a mean period of 11.4+/-2.8 days (range, 4-15 days). Subsequently the patients were started on oral cyclosporine (8 mg/kg/day) and followed for a mean of 10.3+/-10 months (range, 1-30 months). Twelve patients responded to intravenous cyclosporine therapy. One patient with UC developed sepsis on the fourth day of intravenous cyclosporine therapy and needed urgent colectomy. Nine of 12 initial responders (6 patients with UC and 3 patients with CD) relapsed during follow-up despite oral cyclosporine and underwent elective surgery. One patient with CD relapsed 3 months after discontinuation of oral cyclosporine. Only two patients with CD are in long-term remission. There were no long-term side effects in any of the 13 treated patients. In conclusion, intravenous cyclosporine was effective in inducing remission or significant improvement in 12 of 13 patients with steroid-refractory IBD. However, with subsequent oral cyclosporine the remission could be maintained only for a short while. Each of the six patients with UC needed colectomy and three of the five patients with CD had intestinal resection within 12 months despite oral cyclosporine therapy.\n\nAmiodarone-Induced Thyroid Dysfunction: A Clinical Update.\n\nPubMed\n\nElnaggar, Mohamed Nabil; Jbeili, Kahtan; Nik-Hussin, Nik; Kozhippally, Mohandas; Pappachan, Joseph M\n\n2018-06-01\n\nAmiodarone is one of the most commonly prescribed antiarrhythmic agents in clinical practice owing to its efficacy, even with high toxicity profile. The high iodine content and the prolonged biological half-life of the drug can result in thyroid dysfunction in a high proportion of patients treated with amiodarone even after cessation of amiodarone. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are common side effects that mandate regular monitoring of patients with thyroid function tests. Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) is diagnosed and managed in the same way as a usual case of hypothyroidism. However, differential diagnosis and clinical management of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) subtypes can be challenging. With the aid of a case snippet, we update the current evidence for the diagnostic work up and management of patients with amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction in this article.

The most current treatment against leishmaniasis is chemotherapy. Pentavalent antimonials such as glucantime and pentostam have been administrated as the first-line drugs in treatment of various forms of leishmaniasis. The second-line drugs such as amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, miltefosine, pentamidine, azole drugs and paromomycin are used in resistant cases to pentavalent antimonials. Because of drawbacks of the first-line and second-line drugs including adverse side effects on different organs, increasing resistance, high cost, need to hospitalization and long-term treatment, it is necessary to find an alternative drug for leishmaniasis treatment. Several investigations have reported the effectiveness of amiodarone, the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug, against fungi, Trypanosomes and Leishmania spp. in vitro, in vivo and clinical conditions. Moreover, the beneficial effects of dronedarone, amiodarone analogues, against Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania mexicana have recently been demonstrated and such treatment regimens resulted in lower side effects. The anti- leishmanial and anti- trypanosomal effectiveness of amiodarone and dronedarone has been attributed to destabilization of intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis, inhibition of sterol biosynthesis and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. Because of relative low cost, excellent pharmacokinetic properties, easy accessibility and beneficial effects of amiodarone and dronedarone on leishmaniasis, they are proper candidates to replace the current drugs used in leishmaniasis treatment.

For a large proportion the cardinal symptom is inattention; in particular, deficits in selective attention prevail. The ATTENTIONER offers an effective training method for the treatment of selective attention deficit. In 2007, long-term effects of therapy were already reported by Jacobs and Petermann, who examined children ten weeks after therapy on average. In the current study three measurements were conducted: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at follow-up ten to 76 months after post-intervention. Significant long-term effects on measures of selective attention were observed. At follow-up the majority of patients achieved average results which were not clinically relevant. For most children stable therapy effects can be achieved with the ATTENTIONER.\n\nAmiodarone use in patients listed for heart transplant is associated with increased 1-year post-transplant mortality.\n\nPubMed\n\nCooper, Lauren B; Mentz, Robert J; Edwards, Leah B; Wilk, Amber R; Rogers, Joseph G; Patel, Chetan B; Milano, Carmelo A; Hernandez, Adrian F; Stehlik, Josef; Lund, Lars H\n\n2017-02-01\n\nPre-transplant amiodarone use has been postulated as a risk factor for morbidity and mortality after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). We assessed pre-OHT amiodarone use and tested the hypothesis that it is associated with impaired post-OHT outcomes. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of adult OHT recipients from the registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT). All patients had been transplanted between 2005 and 2013 and were stratified by pre-OHT amiodarone use. We derived propensity scores using logistic regression with amiodarone use as the dependent variable, and assessed the associations between amiodarone use and outcomes with Kaplan-Meier analysis after matching patients 1:1 based on propensity score, and with Cox regression with adjustment for propensity score. Of the 14,944 OHT patients in the study cohort, 32% (N = 4,752) received pre-OHT amiodarone. Amiodarone use was higher in recent years (29% in 2005 to 2007, 32% in 2008 to 2010, 35% in 2011 to 2013). Amiodarone-treated patients were older and more frequently had a history of sudden cardiac death (27% vs 13%) and pre-OHT mechanical circulatory support. Key donor characteristics and allograft ischemia times were similar between groups. In propensity-matched analyses, amiodarone-treated patients had higher rates of cardiac reoperation (15% vs 13%) and permanent pacemaker (5% vs 3%) after OHT and before discharge. Amiodarone-treated patients also had higher 1-year mortality (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.30), but the risks of early graft failure, retransplantation and rehospitalization were similar between groups. Amiodarone use before OHT was independently associated with increased 1-year mortality. The need for amiodarone therapy should be carefully and continuously assessed in patients awaiting OHT.

The most frequent identifiable causes of BVP are ototoxic drug effects, infectious and autoimmune disorders. The majority of cases, however, remain idiopathic. Medical records of patients diagnosed with idiopathic BVP were examined in five dizziness clinics. We identified 126 patients with \"idiopathic\" BVP. Out of these, 15 patients had a history of Amiodarone treatment before the diagnosis of BVP, resulting in a 12% prevalence. The present report supports the hypothesis that Amiodarone can cause BVP. Vestibular examination in patients taking Amiodarone and suffering from balance-related symptoms are recommended, to recognize this adverse effect as early as possible and allow for an informed judgement on a potential dose reduction or withdrawal for recovery of the vestibular function.\n\nPrehospital amiodarone may increase the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome among patients at risk.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarnatovskaia, Lioudmila V; Festic, Emir; Gajic, Ognjen; Carter, Rickey E; Lee, Augustine S\n\n2012-10-01\n\nAmiodarone has been implicated as a risk factor for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) when used in the hospital. This study aims to estimate whether prehospital amiodarone also increases the risk of ALI/ARDS. Adult patients admitted to 22 centers with at least 1 risk factor for developing ALI were recruited. In a secondary analysis of this cohort, the prehospital use of amiodarone was documented on admission, and the patients followed for the primary outcome of ALI and secondary outcomes of ARDS, the need for invasive ventilation, and mortality. Dose/duration of amiodarone therapy was not available. Propensity matching was performed to account for imbalances in being assigned to amiodarone. The adjusted risk for ALI/ARDS was then estimated from a conditional logistic regression model of this propensity-matched set. Forty of 5584 patients were on amiodarone at the time of hospitalization; of those, 6 developed ALI, with 5 progressing to ARDS. In comparison, 371 patients not on amiodarone developed ALI, with 224 having ARDS. After propensity score matching, the prehospital use of amiodarone was not statistically associated with an increased risk for all ALI (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-5.0; P = .25), invasive ventilation (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.6; P = .059), or in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5-2.9; P = .75); but its use appeared to significantly increase the risk for ARDS (OR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.1-13.1; P = .036). Prehospital use of amiodarone may independently increase the risk for ARDS in patients who have at least 1 predisposing condition for ALI. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

These trials included centers and countries with both high and low TTRs. What is the impact of amiodarone on the TTR in a single, high-quality anticoagulation clinic? TTR was assessed in amiodarone and nonamiodarone-treated patients from a University anticoagulation clinic. Baseline characteristics between patients ever-taking or never-taking amiodarone were similar, except more amiodarone patients were smokers (19.5 vs. 6.1%, Pâ=â0.0031). The TTR calculated from 8901international normalized ratios (INRs) in 249 nonamiodarone patients with a mean follow-up of 34âÂ±â20 months (mean INR 36âÂ±â18) was 66âÂ±â16.6% compared with 61.3âÂ±â16.2% (Pâ=â0.111) from 1455 INRs in 41 amiodarone-treated patients with a mean follow-up of 28âÂ±â20 months (mean INR 35âÂ±â22). Factors associated with a low TTR were male sex (Pâ=â0.0013), smoker (Pâ=â0.0048), and amiodarone use (Pâ=â0.0374). A second on-treatment analysis, in which the TTR was calculated only during amiodarone therapy, resulted in similar findings; however, amiodarone did not emerge as a predictor of a low TTR. In 11 patients, the TTR prior to amiodarone (54.5âÂ±â22.2%) was not significantly different in the first 3 months (54.6âÂ±â33.4%) or after 3 months (67.2âÂ±â33.7%) of amiodarone. In a single high-quality anticoagulation center, anticoagulation quality, as measured by the TTR, can be comparable in amiodarone and nonamiodarone-treated patients.\n\n99mTc Sestamibi Thyroid Scan in Amiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis Type I.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatel, Niraj R; Tamara, Luis A; Lee, Ho\n\n2016-07-01\n\nAmiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) type I describes inducement of clinical hyperthyroidism by excessive thyroidal iodine in the setting of latent Graves disease, and therapy differs from that used for AIT type II. A 65-year-old man previously on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation developed clinical hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis of AIT was made, but the type was not clear. Tc sestamibi thyroid scan showed diffusely increased uptake and retention in an enlarged thyroid gland, a pattern consistent with AIT type I. Methimazole was initiated and controlled the thyrotoxicosis. I iodide thyroid scan and uptake study performed later was consistent with Graves disease.\n\nAmiodarone and Catheter Ablation as Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy for Children with Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Sung Hoon; Jeong, Soo In; Kang, I-Seok; Lee, Heung Jae\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPreexcitation by accessory pathways (APs) is known to cause dyssynchrony of the ventricle, related to ventricular dysfunction. Correction of ventricular dyssynchrony can improve heart failure in cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP) with preexcitation. Here, we report the first case of a child with DCMP and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome treated with amiodarone and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) in Korea. A 7-year-old boy, who suffered from DCMP and WPW syndrome, showed improved left ventricular function and clinical functional class after treatment with amiodarone to eliminate preexcitation. QRS duration and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were inversely correlated with amiodarone dosage. After confirming the reduction of preexcitation effects in DCMP, successful RFCA of the right anterior AP resulted in LVEF improvement, along with the disappearance of preexcitation. Our findings suggest that ventricular dyssynchrony, caused by preexcitation in DCMP with WPW syndrome, can worsen ventricular function and amiodarone, as well as RFCA, which should be considered as a treatment option, even in young children.

A 60-year-old Caucasian man arrived at the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was noted to have a subdural hematoma, multiple rib fractures, sternal body fracture, abdominal wall injury, left clavicle fracture, right humerus fracture, and vertebral fractures. His medical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and stroke with residual right-sided weakness. On postoperative day 1, the patient developed atrial fibrillation and was started on i.v. amiodarone. Treatment resulted in conversion to sinus rhythm, but the patient again developed atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 5. During the morning hours of postoperative day 6, the patient experienced a peripheral i.v. line extravasation of amiodarone in his left arm. The amiodarone drip was discontinued, and amiodarone 400 mg orally twice daily was started. The nursing staff was instructed to treat the patient for the amiodarone extravasation with traditional nonpharmacologic measures, including warm compresses and elevation of the extremity. After extravasation, the patient reported severe pain at the site. Due to the patient's continued complaints of pain and the expanding area of induration, the interdisciplinary team elected to proceed with intradermal hyaluronidase. The patient reported significantly decreased pain and was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation on postoperative day 10 without any significant adverse effects. Administration of intradermal hyaluronidase after amiodarone extravasation was associated with decreased expansion of erythema and warmth as well as an improvement in patient-reported pain scores without any noted adverse effects.

Since filoviruses use a complex route of cell entry that depends on numerous cellular factors, we hypothesized that there may be drugs already approved for human use for other indications that interfere with signal transduction or other cellular processes required for their entry and hence have anti-filoviral properties. We used authentic filoviruses and lentiviral particles pseudotyped with filoviral glycoproteins to identify and characterize such compounds. We discovered that amiodarone, a multi-ion channel inhibitor and adrenoceptor antagonist, is a potent inhibitor of filovirus cell entry at concentrations that are routinely reached in human serum during anti-arrhythmic therapy. A similar effect was observed with the amiodarone-related agent dronedarone and the L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil. Inhibition by amiodarone was concentration dependent and similarly affected pseudoviruses as well as authentic filoviruses. Inhibition of filovirus entry was observed with most but not all cell types tested and was accentuated by the pre-treatment of cells, indicating a host cell-directed mechanism of action. The New World arenavirus Guanarito was also inhibited by amiodarone while the Old World arenavirus Lassa and members of the Rhabdoviridae (vesicular stomatitis virus) and Bunyaviridae (Hantaan) families were largely resistant. The ion channel blockers amiodarone, dronedarone and verapamil inhibit filoviral cell entry. Â© The Author 2014.

There have been few comprehensive reviews to establish a relation between hypogonadism with chronic opioid pain management. The OPISHD is often not treated and literature guiding this topic is scarce. To investigate hypogonadism associated with long-term opioid therapy based on qualitative data analysis of the available literature. Systematic review. The review included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed, Cochrane, Clinical Trials, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, and EMBASE, for the years 1960 to September 2013. The quality assessment and clinical relevance criteria used were the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group Criteria for randomized control trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale Criteria for observational studies. The level of evidence was classified as good, fair, and poor, based on the quality of evidence. The primary outcome measures were clinical symptoms and laboratory markers of hypogonadism. Secondary outcome measure was management of OPISHD. Thirty-one studies were identified, of which 14 studies met inclusion criteria. There were no randomized control trials and eight of 14 studies were of moderate quality. The remaining studies were of poor quality. Four studies report most patients on long-term oral opioid therapy have associated hypogonadism and three studies of patients receiving intrathecal opioid therapy suggest that hypogonadism is common. There is lack of high-quality studies to associate chronic opioid pain management with hypogonadism. At present, there is fair evidence to associate hypogonadism with chronic opioid pain management, and only limited evidence for treatment of OPISHD.\n\nAmiodaron in atrial fibrillation: post coronary artery bypass graft.\n\nPubMed\n\nHabibollahi, Paria; Jam, Shahrzad Hashemi; Vahdati, Samad Shams; Baghi, Hamidreza Morteza; Amiri, Hassan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAtrial fibrilation (AF) is the most common complication following heart surgeries; it often occurs in patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The purpose of this review is to categorize prophylaxes or treatment by administration of Amiodaron in patients with CABG. We searched google scholar, pubmed, and Cochrane Library databases (the period 1970-2010) for articles on Amiodaron in CABG and cardiac surgery. A total of 1 561 articles were identified, and 30 articles met the criteria and were enrolled in this review. Most studies supported Amiodarone for prophylaxi purpose in patients who were performed with CABG; few papers supported Amiodaron as a drug for treating CABG. The prophylaxis can decrease the incidence rate of AF in CABG, but if it uses as a treatment, the side effect of Amiodaron will decrease because all of the patients will not get Amiodarone. In the other hand use of Amiodarone as a treatment does not influence the length of hospital stay significantly but these kinds of study are so few. No appropriate therapeutic method has been defined for AF. At present, the common way of treating AF following cardiac surgery is mainly based on prophylaxis in medical books and references.\n\nAmiodaron in atrial fibrillation: post coronary artery bypass graft\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHabibollahi, Paria; Jam, Shahrzad Hashemi; Vahdati, Samad Shams; Baghi, Hamidreza Morteza; Amiri, Hassan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: Atrial fibrilation (AF) is the most common complication following heart surgeries; it often occurs in patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).

This study investigates if long-term humidification therapy with high flow fully humidified air at 37 degrees C through nasal cannulae can improve these clinical outcomes in this group of patients. 108 patients diagnosed with COPD or bronchiectasis were randomised to daily humidification therapy or usual care for 12 months over which exacerbations were recorded. Lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, and measures of airway inflammation were also recorded at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Patients on long-term humidification therapy had significantly fewer exacerbation days (18.2 versus 33.5 days; p = 0.045), increased time to first exacerbation (median 52 versus 27 days; p = 0.0495) and reduced exacerbation frequency (2.97/patient/year versus 3.63/patient/year; p = 0.067) compared with usual care. Quality of life scores and lung function improved significantly with humidification therapy compared with usual care at 3 and 12 months. Long-term humidification therapy significantly reduced exacerbation days, increased time to first exacerbation, improved lung function and quality of life in patients with COPD and bronchiectasis.

Its predisposing factors are incompletely defined yet a higher prevalence was reported in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD). Therefore we sought to determine the incidence and risk factors for AIT in adults with CHD. At a tertiary care center we followed a historical cohort of amiodarone-treated CHD patients for the period 1987-2009. Follow-up concluded at AIT diagnosis or with last thyroid assessment on amiodarone. Cumulative incidence of AIT was calculated. AIT association with nutritional status was hypothesized a priori. AIT developed in 23/169 patients or 13.6%. The AIT incidence peaked in the 3rd year at 7.7%. AIT patients had a lower body mass index (BMI) at AMIO initiation compared with the rest of the cohort (mean Â± standard deviation: 21.9 Â± 2.9 vs. 25.1 Â± 5.0; p<0.001). Patients with BMI<21 were more likely to develop thyrotoxicosis (RR=6.1) compared to those with BMI>25 (p<0.001). Presence of goiter was strongly associated with AIT (RR 3.6, p=0.002). Affected patients had a trend for higher cyanotic heart disease prevalence (34.8% vs. 17.8%, p=0.059). On multivariate analysis body mass index and goiter remained independent predictors of outcome. BMI<21 at initiation of amiodarone therapy and presence of goiter are strong predictors of AIT in this population. Its incidence is time dependent. These predictors can be used clinically in assessing overall impact of amiodarone therapy in congenital heart disease patients. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Grupo de Estudio de la Sobrevida en la Insuficiencia Cardiaca en Argentina.\n\nPubMed\n\nPinto, J V; Ramani, K; Neelagaru, S; Kown, M; Gheorghiade, M\n\n1997-01-01\n\nAmiodarone appears to reduce sudden death in patients with left ventricular dysfunction resulting from an acute MI or a primary dilated cardiomyopathy, particularly if complex ventricular arrhythmias are present. Amiodarone's beneficial effect on mortality in these patients could be unrelated to its antiarrhythmic effects. Multiple factors could account for the improvement in mortality such as the drug's antiischemic effects, neuromodulating effects, its effect on left ventricular function and on heart rate. Moreover, patients with LV dysfunction who have survived an episode of sudden death would potentially benefit from amiodarone therapy. Future trials are needed to determine the precise subsets(s) of patients who would benefit from the drug and the most efficacious dosing regimen for the drug. Based on available data, amiodarone is the only antiarrhythmic agent which has not been shown to increase mortality in patients with chronic heart failure.\n\nThe Long Term Effectiveness of Intensive Stuttering Therapy: A Mixed Methods Study\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nIrani, Farzan; Gabel, Rodney; Daniels, Derek; Hughes, Stephanie\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of client perceptions of an intensive stuttering therapy program that utilizes a multi-f"
