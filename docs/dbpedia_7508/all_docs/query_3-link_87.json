        "text": "Adverse effects of oral amiodarone therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSinha, P R; Dube, S; Sujata; Gupta, P R; Avasthey, P; Somani, P N\n\n1992-04-01\n\nOral amiodarone was administered to 38 patients (25 males, 13 females) with mean age of 43.6 years. Ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias were present in 30 and 8 patients respectively. Amiodarone was given as 400-1200 mg/day for 1-2 weeks as loading dose and then it was maintained as 100-600 mg/day. The mean duration of therapy was 12.4 months. Adverse effects were noted in 21 (55.3%) cases. The commonest adverse effects observed were asymptomatic corneal microdeposits followed by gastrointestinal, cardiac, neurological and cutaneous disturbances. The drug was withdrawn in 2 (5.3%) patients because of nausea and vomiting. One patient died of pulmonary infiltrations. It is concluded that adverse effects are common with amiodarone but are tolerated well, making this drug an excellent choice for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nEffect of prophylactic amiodarone on clinical and economic outcomes after cardiothoracic surgery: a meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nGillespie, Effie L; Coleman, Craig I; Sander, Stephen; Kluger, Jeffrey; Gryskiewicz, Kristen A; White, C Michael\n\n2005-09-01\n\nTwo previous meta-analyses of amiodarone for prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiothoracic surgery did not evaluate total hospital cost, concluded that data on stroke are incomplete, and did not evaluate the effect of clinical heterogeneity between trials. To conduct a meta-analysis examining amiodarone's prophylactic impact on cardiothoracic surgery POAF, length of stay (LOS), stroke, and total costs. Three reviewers conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library (1966-SEPTEMBER 2004). Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trial versus placebo/routine treatment, (2) coronary artery bypass graft and/or valvular surgery, (3) Jadad score > or = 3, (4) reported data on incidence of POAF or stroke, LOS, or total costs, (5) used electrocardiographic/Holter monitoring, and (6) monitored subjects for > or = 2 days. A random-effects model was utilized. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Fifteen trials were identified, including 1512 and 1429 patients in the amiodarone and control groups, respectively. Amiodarone reduced POAF (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.60) and decreased stroke (n = 8 studies), LOS (n = 10), and total costs (n = 6) (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.96; -0.73 days, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.51; and -dollar 1619, 95% CI -3395 to 156, respectively). Surgery type, beta-blocker use, route of administration, use of a fixed-effects model, or exclusion of unblinded/unpublished studies did not affect the overall results. No statistical heterogeneity was observed for any endpoint evaluated (p > 0.22 for all comparisons). Prophylactic treatment with amiodarone decreases patients' risk of POAF and stroke while reducing LOS.\n\nAmiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis Recurrence After Amiodarone Reintroduction.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaqdasy, Salwan; Batisse-Lignier, Marie; Auclair, Candy; Desbiez, FranÃ§oise; Citron, Bernard; Thieblot, Philippe; Roche, BÃ©atrice; Lusson, Jean RenÃ©; Tauveron, Igor\n\n2016-04-01\n\nReintroduction of amiodarone in patients with a history of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is rarely used. To date, the risk of AIT recurrence after amiodarone reintroduction is unpredicted. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk of AIT recurrence. Retrospectively, from 2000 to 2011, all euthyroid patients with a history of AIT with amiodarone reintroduction were included. Type and severity of the first AIT, amiodarone chronology, and thyroid function evolution after reintroduction of amiodarone were investigated: 46 of 172 patients with AIT history needed amiodarone reintroduction. At first AIT episode, the mean age was 62.2 Â± 16 years with male gender predominance; 65% of patients were classified as type 1 AIT. AIT recurred in 14 patients (30%), 12 patients developed hypothyroidism (26%), and 20 patients remained euthyroid (44%). Characteristics of type 1 AIT during the first episode, namely briefer exposure period to amiodarone and longer duration of treatment to normalize thyroid hormones, were predictive of AIT recurrence; 73% of patients (8 of 11) with previous episode of type 1 AIT, who did not receive a preventive thioamide treatment, developed a second episode of AIT. Thioamide preventive treatment could be useful to prevent type 1 AIT recurrence. In conclusion, AIT recurrence after amiodarone reintroduction is 4 times more frequent in patients with type 1 AIT history. Thyroid ablation before amiodarone reintroduction in patients with a history of type 1 AIT is preferred. Preventive thioamide treatment could be suggested in patients with type 1 AIT history pending for surgery. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, amiodarone is associated with significant extra-cardiac side effects and this has driven development of amiodarone analogues. These analogues include short acting analogues (e.g., AT-2001) with similar acute effects to amiodarone, the thyroid receptor antagonist KB-130015 and dronedarone. Dronedarone, (SR-33589; Sanofi-Synthelabo), is a non-iodinated amiodarone derivative that inhibits Na +, K + and Ca 2+ currents. It is a potent inhibitor of the acetylcholine-activated K + current from atrial and sinoatrial nodal tissue, and inhibits the rapid delayed rectifier more potently than slow and inward rectifier K + currents and inhibits L-type calcium current. Dronedarone is an antagonist at alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors and unlike amiodarone, has little effect at thyroid receptors. Dronedarone is more potent than amiodarone in inhibiting arrhythmias and death in animal models of ischaemia- and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. In the Dronedarone Atrial Fibrillation Study After Electrical Cardioversion (DAFNE) clinical trial, dronedarone 800 mg/day appeared to be effective and safe for the prevention of atrial fibrillation relapses after cardioversion. The Antiarrhythmic Trial with Dronedarone in Moderate-to-Severe Congestive Heart Failure Evaluating Morbidity Decrease (ANDROMEDA) trial was stopped due to a potential increased risk of death in the dronedarone group. Trials of dronedarone in the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation and a safety and tolerability study in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator are ongoing. Further experimental and clinical studies are required before we have a definitive answer to whether dronedarone has advantages over amiodarone and\n\n[Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis].\n\nPubMed\n\nBogazzi, Fausto; Tomisti, Luca; Di Bello, Vitantonio; Martino, Enio\n\n2017-03-01\n\nAmiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction occurs in about 15-20% of patients under amiodarone therapy. Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) can develop in patients with an apparently normal thyroid gland or in those with an underlying chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. On a clinical ground, AIH is not challenging and can be easily treated with L-thyroxine therapy. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) can occur in patients with (AIT 1) or without (AIT 2) an underlying thyroid disease. AIT 1 is a true iodine-induced hyperthyroidism occurring in patients with an underlying thyroid autonomy while AIT 2 is a drug-induced destructive thyroiditis. According to the different pathogenetic mechanism, AIT 2 is treated with glucocorticoids while AIT 1 usually responds to thionamides. Thyroidectomy should be considered when AIT represents an imminent risk for cardiac conditions, when patients require a prompt resolution of thyrotoxicosis or when they do not respond to the medical therapy. An effective collaboration between cardiologists and endocrinologists is crucial in each part of the management of AIT patients, including the evaluation of cardiological conditions with regard to thyroid hormone excess and whether, or not, it is necessary to continue amiodarone therapy.\n\nAcute hepatitis after amiodarone infusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nFonseca, Paulo; Dias, Adelaide; GonÃ§alves, Helena; Albuquerque, AnÃ­bal; Gama, Vasco\n\n2015-10-16\n\nAcute hepatitis is a very rare, but potentially fatal, adverse effect of intravenous amiodarone. We present a case of an 88-year-old man with history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and severely depressed left ventricular function that was admitted to our coronary care unit with diagnosis of decompensated heart failure and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. A few hours after the beginning of intravenous amiodarone he developed an acute hepatitis. There was a completely recovery within the next days after amiodarone withdrawn and other causes of acute hepatitis have been ruled out. This case highlights the need for close monitoring of hepatic function during amiodarone infusion in order to identify any potential hepatotoxicity and prevent a fatal outcome. Oral amiodarone is, apparently, a safe option in these patients.\n\n[Amiodarone and thyroid].\n\nPubMed\n\nCapraro, JoÃ«l; Thalmann, SÃ©bastien\n\n2011-06-01\n\nAmiodarone is a widely used antiarrythmic drug and can lead either to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism due to its molecular structure which is similar to levothyroxin. Amiodarone induced hypothyroidism can be treated easely with hormonal subsitution. Hyperthyroidism is more challenging. There exist two forms of amiodarone-induced Hyperthyroidism (AIT): AIT type 1 is directly related to the iodine compound of amiodarone and responds to thyreostatic therapy. Type 2 is a consequence of the direct toxicity of amiodarone to the thyroid gland and is treated primarily with glucocorticoids. However, this differentiation often is impossible in clinical settings and a pragmatic approach is needed.\n\nPM101: a cyclodextrin-based intravenous formulation of amiodarone devoid of adverse hemodynamic effects.\n\nPubMed\n\nCushing, Daniel J; Kowey, Peter R; Cooper, Warren D; Massey, Bill W; Gralinski, Michael R; Lipicky, Raymond J\n\n2009-04-01\n\nIntravenous amiodarone (Amiodarone i.v.) is widely used to treat cardiac arrhythmias. The most frequent clinical adverse event associated with Amiodarone i.v. administration is systemic hypotension which has been attributed to the cosolvents used in the formulation, polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol. To minimize hypotension Amiodarone i.v. is diluted in 5% dextrose in water prior to administration and slowly infused. PM101 is a novel intravenous formulation that uses sulfobutylether-7-beta-cyclodextrin to solubilize amiodarone, and thus should be devoid of the untoward hemodynamic effects associated with polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol. Beagle dogs (n=7/group) were anesthetized with morphine and alpha-chloralose and instrumented to assess aortic blood pressure, cardiac output, cardiac contractility, and heart rate. Animals were treated with the U.S. approved human-equivalent loading dose (2.14 mg/kg) of Amiodarone i.v., PM101, and their respective vehicle controls. Administration of Amiodarone i.v. rapidly and significantly decreased mean aortic pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac contractility. A significant increase in heart rate was also observed as was a transient, but not significant, decrease in systemic vascular resistance. A similar pattern of rapid and significant hemodynamic changes was produced by the Amiodarone i.v. Vehicle (polysorbate 80/benzyl alcohol) alone. In marked contrast, PM101 and its vehicle produced no significant hemodynamic effects. This study provides a useful model for the continued search for a safe and effective intravenous amiodarone formulation devoid of the hypotensive risk associated with the current commercial formulation.\n\nAmiodarone. Haemodynamic profile during intravenous administration and effect on pacing-induced ischaemia in man.\n\nPubMed\n\nRemme, W J; van Hoogenhuyze, D C; Kruyssen, D A; Krauss, X H; Storm, C J\n\n1985-03-01\n\nThe haemodynamic changes during intravenous amiodarone administration in laboratory animals and human studies are reviewed and compared with the results from our investigations. While the results of previous human studies have been rather variable, our investigations suggest that the cardiovascular changes following intravenous amiodarone include an early and usually short reduction of systemic and coronary vascular resistance, which may be partially due to the vasodilating properties of the solvent, polysorbate 80. As a result, a decrease in afterload and cardiac work and increases in cardiac output and coronary blood flow occur. Contrary to the observations in the animal experiments, heart rate increases in man, presumably as a result of the relatively greater fall in afterload which occurs. However, in spite of this increase in heart rate, contractility is reduced at the end of amiodarone administration and remains depressed after the infusion, resulting in a significant increase in left ventricular filling pressure. Neither myocardial oxygen demand nor consumption change during amiodarone administration. Although the intrinsic negative inotropic effects of amiodarone warrant a cautious approach in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, worsening of heart failure or the occurrence of myocardial ischaemia has been reported in only very few cases so far. In contrast, the drug was demonstrated to protect against pacing-induced myocardial ischaemia, in patients with both normal and depressed left ventricular function. These anti-ischaemic properties of amiodarone were investigated in a second study using a double pacing stress test protocol. Overall myocardial oxygen consumption did not change during pacing after amiodarone, but it clearly reduced (regional) myocardial ischaemia, as demonstrated by a reduction of ST-segment changes and anginal pain, and in particular by the absence of myocardial lactate production during pacing after amiodarone.

Review of relevant literature. In the 1970s and 1980s a plethora of new antiarrhythmic agents, including amiodarone, was introduced. Amiodarone is predominately a class III antiarrhythmic, but also possesses class I, II, and IV effects. By 1977 it was described as the ideal antiarrhythmic agent. However, clinicians underestimated potential difficulties caused by misunderstanding its variable absorption, slow initial response at nonloading dosages, and extended half-life. Elevated dosages also produced frequent adverse effects. Thus, early enthusiasm for the drug's efficacy was gradually replaced by a focus on its toxicity. The 1990s witnessed reacceptance of the agent as more logical initial regimens and lower maintenance dosages decreased adverse effects, and amiodarone emerged as one of the few drugs effective in suppressing and preventing arrhythmias that does not increase mortality. Remaining challenges include delineation of an optimal oral regimen, identification of markers useful in clinical monitoring, and elucidation of the relationship between dose-tissue concentration and response and dose-toxicity associations. Amiodarone is an increasingly valuable component of today's antiarrhythmic therapy.\n\nAmiodarone-associated bilateral vestibulopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nGÃ¼rkov, Robert; Manzari, Leonardo; BlÃ¶dow, Alexander; Wenzel, Angela; Pavlovic, Dusan; Luis, Leonal\n\n2018-03-01\n\nBilateral vestibulopathy (BVP) is a debilitating disorder characterized by the hypofunction of both vestibular end organs or nerves. The most frequent identifiable causes of BVP are ototoxic drug effects, infectious and autoimmune disorders. The majority of cases, however, remain idiopathic. Medical records of patients diagnosed with idiopathic BVP were examined in five dizziness clinics. We identified 126 patients with \"idiopathic\" BVP. Out of these, 15 patients had a history of Amiodarone treatment before the diagnosis of BVP, resulting in a 12% prevalence. The present report supports the hypothesis that Amiodarone can cause BVP. Vestibular examination in patients taking Amiodarone and suffering from balance-related symptoms are recommended, to recognize this adverse effect as early as possible and allow for an informed judgement on a potential dose reduction or withdrawal for recovery of the vestibular function.\n\nThe effect of amiodarone on warfarin anticoagulation: a register-based nationwide cohort study involving the Swedish population.\n\nPubMed\n\nHolm, J; Lindh, J D; Andersson, M L; Mannheimer, B\n\n2017-03-01\n\nEssentials Data on the effect of introducing amiodarone in patients already using warfarin regime are scarce. Information on 754 patients was extracted from three nationwide registers in Sweden. With amiodaron, 37% of patients had an international normalized ratio (INR) over 3.0 To avoid bleeding, the initiation of amiodarone should be accompanied by closer INR monitoring. Background Data indicate that the interaction between warfarin and amiodarone results in an increased warfarin effect. There are several large, well-performed studies using genetic and clinical factors such as co-medication to predict an adequate starting dose of warfarin. However, longitudinal data on the effect of introducing amiodarone in patients on an ongoing warfarin regime are more scarce. Objectives An investigation of how initiation of amiodarone affects the anticoagulant effect and dosing of warfarin, using data from three nationwide registries. Patients/Methods In a retrospective cohort study including 754 patients, warfarin doses were compared between two 4-week periods, before and 18-21 weeks after initiating co-treatment with amiodarone. In addition, warfarin doses and international normalized ratio (INR) values were calculated week-by-week after the initiation of amiodarone. Results The initiation of amiodarone increased the mean INR from 2.6 to 3.1. The proportion of patients with a supratherapeutic INR over 3.0 and 4.0 increased from 12% to 37% and 0.9% to 5.5%, respectively. The subsequent mean decrease in warfarin dose was 24.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.5, 25.6). The frequency of INR monitoring within 1 and 2 weeks after initiation of amiodarone was 67% and 90%. Conclusions Although warfarin doses in most patients were within the therapeutic range, more than one in three patients initiating co-treatment with amiodarone were exposed to a supratherapeutic anticoagulative effect within 3 weeks. In order to further avoid severe unnecessary bleeding, the initiation of\n\nAmiodarone-Induced Thyroid Dysfunction: A Clinical Update.\n\nPubMed\n\nElnaggar, Mohamed Nabil; Jbeili, Kahtan; Nik-Hussin, Nik; Kozhippally, Mohandas; Pappachan, Joseph M\n\n2018-06-01\n\nAmiodarone is one of the most commonly prescribed antiarrhythmic agents in clinical practice owing to its efficacy, even with high toxicity profile. The high iodine content and the prolonged biological half-life of the drug can result in thyroid dysfunction in a high proportion of patients treated with amiodarone even after cessation of amiodarone. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are common side effects that mandate regular monitoring of patients with thyroid function tests. Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) is diagnosed and managed in the same way as a usual case of hypothyroidism. However, differential diagnosis and clinical management of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) subtypes can be challenging. With the aid of a case snippet, we update the current evidence for the diagnostic work up and management of patients with amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction in this article.

The most current treatment against leishmaniasis is chemotherapy. Pentavalent antimonials such as glucantime and pentostam have been administrated as the first-line drugs in treatment of various forms of leishmaniasis. The second-line drugs such as amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, miltefosine, pentamidine, azole drugs and paromomycin are used in resistant cases to pentavalent antimonials. Because of drawbacks of the first-line and second-line drugs including adverse side effects on different organs, increasing resistance, high cost, need to hospitalization and long-term treatment, it is necessary to find an alternative drug for leishmaniasis treatment. Several investigations have reported the effectiveness of amiodarone, the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug, against fungi, Trypanosomes and Leishmania spp. in vitro, in vivo and clinical conditions. Moreover, the beneficial effects of dronedarone, amiodarone analogues, against Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania mexicana have recently been demonstrated and such treatment regimens resulted in lower side effects. The anti- leishmanial and anti- trypanosomal effectiveness of amiodarone and dronedarone has been attributed to destabilization of intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis, inhibition of sterol biosynthesis and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. Because of relative low cost, excellent pharmacokinetic properties, easy accessibility and beneficial effects of amiodarone and dronedarone on leishmaniasis, they are proper candidates to replace the current drugs used in leishmaniasis treatment.

Among 127 patients who entered the study, 61 were assigned to no antiarrhythmic therapy (control group [CG] and 66 to amiodarone treatment (amiodarone group [AG]). Amiodarone was administered at a dosage of 800 mg/day for 2 weeks followed by 400 mg/day thereafter. A 12-month follow-up was completed for 106 patients (57 in the AG and 49 in the CG). Amiodarone reduced the overall mortality rate, which was 10.5% in the AG versus 28.6% in the CG (odds ratio [OR] 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10 to 0.84; log-rank test 0.02) and sudden death rate, which was 7.0% in the AG versus 20.4% in the CG (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00; log-rank test 0.04). Side effects were rare, and in only three patients did amiodarone treatment have to be discontinued.\n\nAmiodarone induced pneumonitis and hyperthyroidism: case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrabczak, Elzbieta Magdalena; Zielonka, Tadeusz M; WiwaÅa, Joanna; BareÅa, Anna Dagmara; Opuchlik, Andrzej; Potulska, Anna; Ambroziak, Urszula; Chazan, Ryszarda\n\n2008-09-01\n\nAmiodarone is a highly effective antiarrhythmic agent used in life-threatening ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Its long-term use may however lead to several adverse effects, including corneal deposits, liver and thyroid gland dysfunction, lung lesions, bone marrow injury, skin lesions, or neurological abnormalities. The article presents the case of a 56-year-old man with a history of a stroke, who after a few days of amiodarone therapy for an episode of atrial fibrillation was diagnosed with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism and interstitial pulmonary lesions. Clinical and laboratory symptoms of hyperthyroidism and radiographic signs of pulmonary involvement did not occur until several weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone therapy. Differential diagnosis of causes of hyperthyroidism and diseases causing nodular pulmonary lesions did not demonstrate any other pathologies. Empirical antibiotic therapy and administration of thiamazole and high doses of propranolol failed to improve the patient's clinical status. It was not until thiamazole was given in combination with glucocorticosteroids, when a slow relief of hyperthyroidism symptoms and resolution of radiographic pulmonary signs were observed. Based on the presented case, the risk of appearance of 2 serious concomitant adverse effects was demonstrated, even following a short-term amiodarone therapy. This paper also contains an overview of adverse effects which may be encountered during or after therapy with this effective antiarrhythmic agent. It was emphasized how important it is to select patients appropriately, and to monitor potential adverse effects during amiodarone therapy.\n\n[Thyroid and treatment with amiodarone diagnosis, therapy and clinical management].\n\nPubMed\n\nMikosch, Peter\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAmiodarone is a frequently used antiarrhythmic drug with a high antiarrhythmic potency. However, beside its antiarrhythmic effects Amiodarone also reveals a variety of adverse effects and drug-related complications. The affected organs include the eyes, skin, lungs, nervous system, liver, gastrointestinal tract and the thyroid. The thyroid is one of the most frequently affected organs by Amiodarone. An altered hormone equilibrium always occurs and has to be distinguished from Amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. The differentiation of these states frequently causes problems and may even be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in certain cases. The article gives an overview on the interactions between Amiodarone and the thyroid, the diagnostic and therapeutic options and management strategies of patient on Amiodarone therapy in the view of thyroid function.\n\n[Prevention of recurrent amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism by iodine-131].\n\nPubMed\n\nHermida, J S; Jarry, G; Tcheng, E; Moullart, V; Arlot, S; Rey, J L; Schvartz, C\n\n2004-03-01\n\nAmioradone-induced hyperthyroidism is a common complication of amiodarone therapy. Although definitive interruption of amiodarone is recommended because of the risks of aggravation of the arrhythmias, some patients may require the reintroduction of amiodarone several months after normalisation of thyroid function. The authors undertook a retrospective study of the effects of preventive treatment of recurrences of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism with I131. The indication of amiodarone therapy was recurrent, symptomatic, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in 13 cases and ventricular tachycardia in 5 cases (M = 14, average age 64 +/- 13 years). The underlying cardiac disease was dilated cardiomyopathy (N = 5), ischaemic heart disease (N = 3), hypertensive heart disease (N = 2), arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (N = 2) or valvular heart disease (N = 2). Two patients had idiopathic atrial fibrillation. An average dose of 576 +/- 184 MBq of I131 was administered 34 +/- 37 months after an episode of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone was reintroduced in 16 of the 18 patients after a treatment-free period of 98 +/- 262 days. Transient post-radioiodine hyperthyroidism was observed in 3 cases (17%). Sixteen patients (89%) developed hypothyroidism requiring replacement therapy with L-thyroxine. There were no recurrences of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. After 24 +/- 17 months follow-up, the arrhythmias were controlled in 13 of the 16 patients (81%) who underwent the whole treatment sequence. The authors conclude that preventive treatment with I131 is an effective alternative to prevent recurrence of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism in patients requiring reintroduction of amiodarone to control their arrhythmias.\n\n[Thyroid dysfunction and amiodarone].\n\nPubMed\n\nLima, Jandira; Carvalho, PatrÃ­cia; Molina, M Auxiliadora; Rebelo, Marta; Dias, PatrÃ­cia; Vieira, JosÃ© Diniz; Costa, JosÃ© M Nascimento\n\n2013-02-01\n\nAlthough most patients remain clinically euthyroid, some develop amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism (HPEAI) or hypothyroidism (HPOAI). The authors present a retrospective analysis of ten patients with amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction. Six patients were female and mean amiodarone intake was 17.7 months. HPOIA was more common (six patients). From all the patients with HPEAI, two had type 2, one had type 1, and one had type 3 hyperthyroidism. Symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction occurred in five patients, most of them with HPOAI. In HPEAI, the most frequent symptom was exacerbation of arrhythmia (three patients). Discontinuation of amiodarone and treatment with levothyroxine was chosen in 83.3% of the HPOAI cases, while thyonamide treatment with corticosteroids and without amiodarone was the option in 75% of the HPEAI cases. There were three deaths, all in patients with HPEAI. HPEAI is potentially fatal. The clinical picture may be vague, so the thyroid monitoring is mandatory.\n\nThe effects of sesame oil on the prevention of amiodarone-induced phlebitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBagheri-Nesami, Masoumeh; Shorofi, Seyed Afshin; Hashemi-Karoie, Seyedeh Zahra; Khalilian, Alireza\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPhlebitis is the most common complication associated with peripheral intravenous infusion of amiodarone. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of sesame oil on the prevention of amiodarone-induced phlebitis. This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Following peripheral intravenous cannulation, five drops of pure sesame oil were applied to the skin within a 10 cm radius of the infusion site prior to the administration of amiodarone in the intervention group. Sesame oil was rubbed on the skin at the infusion site every 6 h in the 24-h period of amiodarone infusion. In the control group, liquid paraffin, used as a placebo, was rubbed on the skin at the infusion site of amiodarone. Both groups were monitored for the development of phlebitis and its degree within the 24-h period of amiodarone infusion as well as 6 h after its administration. The incidence of phlebitis was confirmed and recorded by an assessor who was blind to the two groups. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 18, and descriptive and inferential statistics such as Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier, Hazard ratio, independent t-test, and Fisher's exact test. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in their catheter survival after 30 h and 10 min (P < 0.001). Over 60% of the patients (61.1%) in the intervention group did not show any sign of phlebitis, while 16.7% and 22.2% of the patients manifested signs of grade 2 and 3 phlebitis, respectively. In the control group, 22.2% of the patients showed no signs of phlebitis, while 5.6%, 27.8%, and 44.4% of the patients exhibited signs of grade 2, 3, and 4 phlebitis, respectively. The statistical analysis showed significant differences in the degree of phlebitis (P = 0.006) and the onset of phlebitis development (P < 0.001) between\n\nThe effects of sesame oil on the prevention of amiodarone-induced phlebitis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBagheri-Nesami, Masoumeh; Shorofi, Seyed Afshin; Hashemi-Karoie, Seyedeh Zahra; Khalilian, Alireza\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: Phlebitis is the most common complication associated with peripheral intravenous infusion of amiodarone.

Hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is usually mild and delayed onset. Acute hepatotoxicity is a rare side effect and usually correlated to intravenous form use. In this case, acute hepatocellular injury occurred within 24 hours after the administration of intravenous amiodarone. Liver enzyme significantly improved after holding intravenous amiodarone use. Because ventricular arrhythmia persisted and side effects occurred to alternative therapy, low dose of oral amiodarone was resumed and hepatotoxicity did not occur afterward. Acute hepatotoxicity of intravenous amiodarone is possibly related to polysorbate 80, the solubilizer of amiodarone infusion or higher dose. As a result, when intravenous amiodarone is prescribed, closely monitoring liver enzyme is highly suggested. If acute hepatitis takes place secondary to intravenous amiodarone, oral therapy should not be resumed afterward. If there is no alternative treatment, lower dose of oral amiodarone (â¤200 mg/d) could be tried and should monitor liver function regularly.\n\nManagement of amiodarone extravasation with intradermal hyaluronidase.\n\nPubMed\n\nFox, Ashley N; Villanueva, Ruben; Miller, Jamie L\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe case of a patient who experienced extravasation while receiving amiodarone via a peripheral infusion and was treated with intradermal hyaluronidase is reported. A 60-year-old Caucasian man arrived at the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was noted to have a subdural hematoma, multiple rib fractures, sternal body fracture, abdominal wall injury, left clavicle fracture, right humerus fracture, and vertebral fractures. His medical history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and stroke with residual right-sided weakness. On postoperative day 1, the patient developed atrial fibrillation and was started on i.v. amiodarone. Treatment resulted in conversion to sinus rhythm, but the patient again developed atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 5. During the morning hours of postoperative day 6, the patient experienced a peripheral i.v. line extravasation of amiodarone in his left arm. The amiodarone drip was discontinued, and amiodarone 400 mg orally twice daily was started. The nursing staff was instructed to treat the patient for the amiodarone extravasation with traditional nonpharmacologic measures, including warm compresses and elevation of the extremity. After extravasation, the patient reported severe pain at the site. Due to the patient's continued complaints of pain and the expanding area of induration, the interdisciplinary team elected to proceed with intradermal hyaluronidase. The patient reported significantly decreased pain and was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation on postoperative day 10 without any significant adverse effects. Administration of intradermal hyaluronidase after amiodarone extravasation was associated with decreased expansion of erythema and warmth as well as an improvement in patient-reported pain scores without any noted adverse effects.

Amiodarone is effective in treating this arrhythmia but is associated with multiple adverse effects, often with delayed onset. A novel case is described of a patient who developed type 2 amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism that presented as recurrence of outflow obstruction after septal myectomy. The patient's symptoms and echocardiographic findings of outflow obstruction resolved substantially with the treatment of the amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism of delayed onset can be a subtle diagnosis, requiring a high index of suspicion. In conclusion, recognition of this diagnosis in patients with recurrence of outflow obstruction by symptoms and cardiac imaging after septal myectomy may avoid unnecessary repeat surgical intervention.

To compare the cost-effectiveness of cardioversion, with or without antiarrhythmic agents, with that of rate control plus warfarin or aspirin. A Markov decision-analytic model was designed to simulate long-term health and economic outcomes. Published literature and hospital accounting information. Hypothetical cohort of 70-year-old patients with different baseline risks for stroke. 3 months. Societal. Therapeutic strategies using different combinations of cardioversion alone, cardioversion plus amiodarone or quinidine therapy, and rate control with antithrombotic treatment. Expected costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness. Strategies involving cardioversion alone were more effective and less costly than those not involving this option. For patients at high risk for ischemic stroke (5.3% per year), cardioversion alone followed by repeated cardioversion plus amiodarone therapy on relapse was most cost-effective ($9300 per QALY) compared with cardioversion alone followed by warfarin therapy on relapse. This strategy was also preferred for the moderate-risk cohort (3.6% per year), but the benefit was more expensive ($18,900 per QALY). In the lowest-risk cohort (1.6% per year), cardioversion alone followed by aspirin therapy on relapse was optimal. The choice of optimal strategy and incremental cost-effectiveness was substantially influenced by the baseline risk for stroke, rate of stroke in sinus rhythm, efficacy of warfarin, and costs and utilities for long-term warfarin and amiodarone therapy. Cardioversion alone should be the initial management strategy for persistent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. On relapse of arrhythmia, repeated cardioversion plus low-dose amiodarone is cost-effective\n\nAmiodarone causes endothelium-dependent vasodilation in human hand veins in vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrossman, M; Dobrev, D; Kirch, W\n\n1998-09-01\n\nAmiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic agent, is a potent coronary vasodilator. However, direct evidence for its vasodilatory effects in human vasculature in vivo is not available. The aim of the study was to investigate the short-term effects of amiodarone in preconstricted human hand veins and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Thirty-one healthy male volunteers were studied with the use of the dorsal hand vein compliance technique. The hand veins of the subjects were preconstricted with the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine, and amiodarone, inhibitors of nitric oxide formation (NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, L-NMMA), and adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channels (glyburide [INN, glibenclamide]) were infused in the presence or absence of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (acetylsalicylic acid), and the venodilator effect was measured. Furthermore, amiodarone was infused in prostaglandin F2 alpha (dinoprost)-preconstricted hand veins. Amiodarone produced dose-dependent venodilation (51% +/- 3% maximum). Maximum amiodarone-induced venodilation was lower in dinoprost compared with phenylephrine-preconstricted veins. Pretreatment with acetylsalicylic acid reduced the amiodarone-induced venodilation by 40% +/- 6%. L-NMMA reduced the amiodarone-induced venodilation after pretreatment with acetylsalicylic acid by 72% +/- 3%. Glyburide decreased the venodilatory response of amiodarone by 31% +/- 11%, whereas only a slight but not statistically significant additional reduction in venodilation was detected after pretreatment with acetylsalicylic acid. Infusion of the solvents of commercially available amiodarone (polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol) did not cause vasodilation in phenylephrine-preconstricted veins. Amiodarone dilates preconstricted human hand veins in vivo and acts as a venodilator through the cyclooxygenase pathway, activation of nitric oxide synthase, and blockade of alpha adrenergic mechanisms.\n\n[Acute hepatitis following amiodarone administration].\n\nPubMed\n\nTagliamonte, E; Cice, G; Ducceschi, V; Mayer, M S; Iacono, A\n\n1997-09-01\n\nA 61 year old man, treated with amiodarone since 1993 for resistant supraventricular arrhythmias, developed acute hepatitis after an intravenous amiodarone administration. Kidney and liver function tests were performed and pointed out abnormal results. Symptoms ascribable to hepatotoxicity were absent. These changes returned to normal levels within 20 days from withdrawal of the drug. Amiodarone hepatotoxicity can be related to prolonged therapy with a high dose. Intravenous amiodarone may cause acute hepatic disease, but it is suggested that polysorbate 80, a solvent added to the intravenous infusion, is a more likely cause of this complication.\n\nHuman Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes Reveal Bradycardiac Effects Caused by Co-Administration of Sofosbuvir and Amiodarone.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Yankun; Liu, Feng; He, Liuming; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Zheng, Monica; Bu, Lei; Xu, Ying\n\n2018-05-30\n\nCo-administration of sofosbuvir, an anti-hepatitis C virus medication, and antiarrhythmic amiodarone causes symptomatic severe bradycardia in patients and animal models. However, in a few in vitro studies, the combination of sofosbuvir and amiodarone resulted in tachycardiac effects in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). This discrepancy may be attributable to the use of immature hiPSC-CMs in the in vitro studies. To address this, we evaluated the ability of our in-house hiPSC-CMs to assess the interactions between sofosbuvir and amiodarone in vitro. We performed whole-cell patch recordings on hiPSC-CMs to examine the cardiac effect of sofosbuvir and amiodarone, alone or in combination. We found that sofosbuvir and amiodarone caused bradycardiac effects (the beating rate decreased to 75% of the vehicle control, P < 0.001) on our hiPSC-CMs when applied in combination, but they had no significant effect when applied alone. Furthermore, the bradycardiac effect was membrane potential dependent: it increased with depolarization. This raised the possibility that the bradycardiac effects in vivo may originate in nodal cells, which have a more depolarized resting membrane potential compared with ventricular cells. The bradycardiac effects of sofosbuvir plus amiodarone in vitro are consistent with the clinical phenotype and suggest that our hiPSC-CMs may serve as a useful tool in assessing cardiac safety during drug discovery and development process.\n\nAmiodaron in atrial fibrillation: post coronary artery bypass graft.\n\nPubMed\n\nHabibollahi, Paria; Jam, Shahrzad Hashemi; Vahdati, Samad Shams; Baghi, Hamidreza Morteza; Amiri, Hassan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAtrial fibrilation (AF) is the most common complication following heart surgeries; it often occurs in patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The purpose of this review is to categorize prophylaxes or treatment by administration of Amiodaron in patients with CABG. We searched google scholar, pubmed, and Cochrane Library databases (the period 1970-2010) for articles on Amiodaron in CABG and cardiac surgery. A total of 1 561 articles were identified, and 30 articles met the criteria and were enrolled in this review. Most studies supported Amiodarone for prophylaxi purpose in patients who were performed with CABG; few papers supported Amiodaron as a drug for treating CABG. The prophylaxis can decrease the incidence rate of AF in CABG, but if it uses as a treatment, the side effect of Amiodaron will decrease because all of the patients will not get Amiodarone. In the other hand use of Amiodarone as a treatment does not influence the length of hospital stay significantly but these kinds of study are so few. No appropriate therapeutic method has been defined for AF. At present, the common way of treating AF following cardiac surgery is mainly based on prophylaxis in medical books and references.\n\nEvaluation of the Hemodynamic Effects of Intravenous Amiodarone Formulations During the Maintenance Phase Infusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nLindquist, Desirae E; Rowe, A Shaun; Heidel, Eric; Fleming, Travis; Yates, John R\n\n2015-12-01\n\nTwo of the excipients in intravenous formulations of amiodarone, polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol, have been shown to cause hypotension. A newer formulation of amiodarone, which contains cyclodextrin, is devoid of these excipients. To evaluate the change in mean arterial pressure when utilizing 2 intravenous amiodarone formulations. This was a retrospective cohort analysis conducted at an academic medical center. Patients received intravenous amiodarone containing either polysorbate 80/benzyl alcohol (control) or cyclodextrin (cyclodextrin). Patients received these formulations based on a standard institutional protocol of 1 mg/min for 6 hours, followed by 0.5 mg/min for at least 18 hours or until discontinued by the provider. All data were collected from the medical record and included changes in blood pressures, time to lowest systolic blood pressure, concurrent antihypertensive use, and number of patients requiring treatment for hypotension. A total of 160 patients (120 control, 40 cyclodextrin) were included. There was a statistically significant difference in mean arterial pressure between the groups receiving the control formulation of amiodarone compared with the cyclodextrin formulation across the 24-hour maintenance phase infusion (P < 0.001). There was a significant difference between formulations with regard to the change in mean arterial pressure during the 0- to 6-hour and 12- to 18-hour time blocks. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of patients receiving fluid boluses for treatment of hypotension (P = 0.001). The excipients in the formulation of intravenous amiodarone may have a significant role in the hypotensive effects seen throughout the duration the maintenance phase infusion.

Amiodarone has a complex effect on the thyroid gland, ranging from abnormalities of thyroid function tests to overt thyroid dysfunction, with either thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. Myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone use has been rarely reported in the literature. Our two case reports are an add on to the literature, and illustrate that amiodarone is an important cause of thyroid dysfunction including hypothyroidism and myxedema coma. Hence, healthcare providers should have a high index of suspicion for these conditions while treating patients who are taking amiodarone therapy as early recognition and management are essential to optimize outcomes.

It displays a wide cellular electrophysiological spectrum largely similar to amiodarone, inhibiting the potassium currents I(Kr), I(Ks), I(KI), I(KACh), and I(sus), as well as sodium currents and L-type calcium currents in isolated cardiomyocytes. In addition, dronedarone exhibits antiadrenergic properties. In vivo, dronedarone has been shown to be more effective than amiodarone in several arrhythmia models, particularly in preventing ischemia- and reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation and in reducing mortality. However, an increased incidence of torsades de pointes with dronedarone in dogs shows that possible proarrhythmic effects of dronedarone require further evaluation. The clinical trails DAFNE, EURIDIS, and ADONIS indicated safety, antiarrhythmic efficacy and low proarrhythmic potential of the drug in low-risk patients. In contrast, the increased incidence of death in the dronedarone group of the discontinued ANDROMEDA trial raises safety concerns for patients with congestive heart failure and moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction. Dronedarone appears to be effective in preventing relapses of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Torsades de pointes, the most severe adverse effect associated with amiodarone, has not yet been reported in humans with dronedarone. Unlike amiodarone, dronedarone had little effect on thyroid function and hormone levels in animal models and had no significant effects on human thyroid function in clinical trials. In conclusion, dronedarone could be a useful drug for prevention of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter relapses in low-risk patients. However, further experimental studies and long-term clinical trials are required to provide additional evidence of efficacy and safety of dronedarone.\n\nSex Differences in the Relationship Between Amiodarone Use and the Need for Permanent Pacing in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEssebag, Vidal; Reynolds, Matthew R.; Hadjis, Tom; Lemery, Robert; Olshansky, Brian; Buxton, Alfred E.; Josephson, Mark E.; Zimetbaum, Peter\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground Amiodarone use was associated with an increased need for pacemaker insertion in a retrospective study of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and prior myocardial infarction. The aims of this study were to determine prospectively whether amiodarone increases the need for pacemakers in a general population of patients with AF and whether this effect is modified by sex. Methods The study included 1005 patients with new-onset AF who were enrolled in the Fibrillation Registry Assessing Costs, Therapies, Adverse events, and Lifestyle (FRACTAL). Multivariable Cox regression models, including time-dependent covariates accounting for medication exposure, were used to evaluate the risk of pacemaker insertion associated with amiodarone use. Results Amiodarone use was associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (hazard ratio [HR], 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08â3.76) after adjustment for age, sex, atrial flutter, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and hypertension. The effect of amiodarone use was modified by sex, with a significant risk in women but not in men (HR, 4.69; 95% CI, 1.99â11.05 vs HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.42â2.58 [P = .02]). This interaction remained significant after adjustment for weight, body mass index, weight-adjusted amiodarone dose, and use of other antiarrhythmic or rate control drugs. Conclusion The risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring pacemaker insertion associated with amiodarone use for AF is significantly greater in women than in men, independent of weight or body mass index.

Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, reduces sudden cardiac death in patients with organic heart disease. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of amiodarone on sarcKATP and mitoKATP channels. Single sarcKATP channel current and flavoprotein fluorescence were measured in guinea pig ventricular myocytes to assay sarcKATP and mitoKATP channel activity, respectively. Amiodarone inhibited the sarcKATP channel currents in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting its unitary amplitude. The IC50 values were 0.35 microM in the inside-out patch exposed to an ATP-free solution and 2.8 microM in the cell-attached patch under metabolic inhibition, respectively. Amiodarone (10 microM) alone did not oxidize the flavoprotein. In addition, the oxidative effect of the mitoKATP channel opener diazoxide (100 microM) was unaffected by amiodarone. Exposure to ouabain (1 mM) for 30 min produced mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, and the intensity of rhod-2 fluorescence increased to 246 +/- 16% of baseline (n = 9). Amiodarone did not alter the ouabain-induced mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload (236 +/- 10% of baseline, n = 7). Treatment with diazoxide significantly reduced the ouabain-induced mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload (158 +/- 15% of baseline, n = 8, p < 0.05 versus ouabain); this effect was not abolished by amiodarone (154 +/- 10% of baseline, n = 8, p < 0.05 versus ouabain). These results suggest that amiodarone inhibits sarcKATP but not mitoKATP channels in cardiac myocytes. Such an action of amiodarone may effectively prevent ischemic arrhythmias without causing ischemic damage.\n\nEarly acute hepatitis with parenteral amiodarone: a toxic effect of the vehicle?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRhodes, A; Eastwood, J B; Smith, S A\n\n1993-01-01\n\nA 72 year old white man developed acute hepatic impairment and renal failure within 24 hours of starting intravenous amiodarone for paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. After normal initial investigations, there was a noticeable rise in serum transaminases as well as an increase in clotting times, a decrease in renal function and a thrombocytopenia. These changes returned to normal within seven days of withdrawal of the drug without specific treatment, and the patient was later treated with oral amiodarone without any further evidence of hepatotoxicity. Intravenous amiodarone has been implicated in acute hepatic disease on four previous occasions, but it is suggested that polysorbate 80, an organic surfactant added to the intravenous infusion, is a more likely cause of this complication. Similar reactions have been described with polysorbate 80 in association with the 'E-ferol' syndrome in infants.

Because a large percentage of diabetic patients show a perturbed autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system, including a pertubed regulation of heart rate, we studied the antiarrhythmic response as well as the early effects (within 5 days) on heart rate of an intravenous amiodarone loading dose in diabetic patients. Seven type II (noninsulin-dependent) diabetic patients (age 64.7 +/- 9.7 years), affected by uncontrolled atrial fibrilation or atrial flutter, were enrolled for the study and a group of 12 well-matched (for age, sex and arrhythmia) nondiabetic patients served as a control group. It was found that before amiodarone administration, nondiabetic patients showed significantly wider variations in the circadian rhythm of heart rate values than diabetic patients (p = 0.0062, unpaired t-test). In all patients but one (who was nondiabetic), amiodarone treatment resulted in a cardioversion to sinus rhythm. After amiodarone administration, nondiabetic patients showed a significantly greater decrease (p = 0.0011) in heart rate values in comparison with the diabetic group (-35% vs. -20% on average, at the end of the study). Furthermore, in nondiabetic patients there was also an earlier significant fall (within the first 4 h after the start of treatment with amiodarone, p < 0.001) in the heart rate values in comparison with diabetic patients, in whom a significant decrease (p < 0.001) was found only at the 4th day. A significant (p = 0.0004), more rapid onset of the antiarrhythmic response to the drug was found in nondiabetic patients (6.8 +/- 6.0 h) in comparison with diabetic patients (98.0 +/- 14.8 h).

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its antifungal activity is mediated by calcium overload stress, which leads to a rapid nuclear accumulation of the calcineurin-regulated transcription factor CRZ1. In addition, low doses of amiodarone have been reported to be synergistic with fluconazole in fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans. To establish its mechanism of toxicity in C. albicans, we used expression profiling of key pathway genes to examine cellular responses to amiodarone alone and in combination with fluconazole. Gene expression profiling of 59 genes was done in five C. albicans strains (three fluconazole-susceptible strains and two fluconazole-resistant strains) after amiodarone and/or fluconazole exposure. Of the 59 genes, 27 analyzed showed a significant change (>2-fold) in expression levels after amiodarone exposure. The up- or downregulated genes included genes involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis, cell wall synthesis, vacuolar/lysosomal transport, diverse pathway regulation, stress response, and pseudohyphal morphogenesis. As expected, fluconazole induces an increase in ergosterol pathway genes expression levels. The combination treatment significantly dampened the transcriptional response to either drug, suggesting that synergism was due to an inhibition of compensatory response pathways. This dampening resulted in a decrease in total ergosterol levels and decreased pseudohyphal formation, a finding consistent with decreased virulence in a murine candidiasis model.\n\nTwo cases of bilateral amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nChassang, B; Bonnin, N; Moisset, X; Citron, B; Clavelou, P; Chiambaretta, F\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe widespread use of amiodarone is limited by its toxicity, notably to the optic nerve. We report two cases of bilateral optic nerve neuropathy due to amiodarone, and provide a detailed description of the disease. The first case was a 59-year-old man complaining from insidious monocular loss of vision within ten months of initiating amiodarone. Funduscopy and optical coherence tomography showed bilateral optic disc edema. The second case was a 72-year-old man presenting with a decrease in visual acuity in his left eye for a month. Funduscopy showed a left optic nerve edema, and fluorescein angiography showed bilateral papillitis. In both cases, the clinical presentation was not suggestive of ischemic neuropathy, because of the preservation of visual acuity and the insidious onset. In addition, both cardiovascular and inflammatory work-up were normal. An amiodarone-associated neuropathy was suspected, and amiodarone was discontinued with the approval of the cardiologist, with complete regression of the papilledema and a stabilization of visual symptoms. Differentiating between amiodarone-associated optic neuropathy and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy may be complicated by the cardiovascular background of such patients. The major criterion is the absence of a severe decrease in visual acuity; other criteria are the normality of cardiovascular and inflammatory work-up, and the improvement or the absence of worsening of symptoms after discontinuation of amiodarone. Amiodarone-associated neuropathy remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and requires amiodarone discontinuation, which can only be done with the approval of a cardiologist, and sometimes requires replacement therapy.

This study measured mean plasma concentration over 5 minutes, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of amiodarone administered by the sternal IO (SIO), tibial IO (TIO), and IV routes in a swine model of VF with ongoing CPR. Twenty-one Yorkshire-cross swine were randomly assigned to three groups: SIO, TIO, and IV. Ventricular fibrillation was induced under general anesthesia. After 4 minutes in VF, 300Â mg amiodarone was administered as indicated by group assignment. Serial blood specimens collected at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, and 300 seconds were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The mean plasma concentration of IV amiodarone over 5 minutes was significantly higher than the TIO group at 60 seconds (P = 0.02) and 90 seconds (P = 0.017) post-injection. No significant differences in Cmax between the groups were found (P <0.05). The Tmax of amiodarone was significantly shorter in the SIO (99 secs) and IV (86 secs) groups compared to the TIO group (215 secs); P = 0.002 and P = 0.002, respectively. The SIO and IV routes of amiodarone administration were comparable. The TIO group took nearly three times longer to reach Tmax than the SIO and IV groups, likely indicating depot of lipid-soluble amiodarone in adipose-rich tibial yellow bone marrow. The SIO route was more effective than the TIO route for amiodarone delivery in a swine model of VF with ongoing CPR. Further investigations are necessary to determine if the kinetic differences found between the SIO and TIO routes in this study affect survival of VF in humans.\n\nAmiodarone, anticoagulation, and clinical events in patients with atrial fibrillation: insights from the ARISTOTLE trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nFlaker, Greg; Lopes, Renato D; Hylek, Elaine; Wojdyla, Daniel M; Thomas, Laine; Al-Khatib, Sana M; Sullivan, Renee M; Hohnloser, Stefan H; Garcia, David; Hanna, Michael; Amerena, John; Harjola, Veli-Pekka; Dorian, Paul; Avezum, Alvaro; Keltai, Matyas; Wallentin, Lars; Granger, Christopher B\n\n2014-10-14\n\nAmiodarone is an effective medication in preventing atrial fibrillation (AF), but it interferes with the metabolism of warfarin. This study sought to examine the association of major thrombotic clinical events and bleeding with the use of amiodarone in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial. Baseline characteristics of patients who received amiodarone at randomization were compared with those who did not receive amiodarone. The interaction between randomized treatment and amiodarone was tested using a Cox model, with main effects for randomized treatment and amiodarone and their interaction. Matching on the basis of a propensity score was used to compare patients who received and who did not receive amiodarone at the time of randomization. In ARISTOTLE, 2,051 (11.4%) patients received amiodarone at randomization. Patients on warfarin and amiodarone had time in the therapeutic range that was lower than patients not on amiodarone (56.5% vs. 63.0%; p < 0.0001). More amiodarone-treated patients had a stroke or a systemic embolism (1.58%/year vs. 1.19%/year; adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.10; p = 0.0322). Overall mortality and major bleeding rates were elevated, but were not significantly different in amiodarone-treated patients and patients not on amiodarone. When comparing apixaban with warfarin, patients who received amiodarone had a stroke or a systemic embolism rate of 1.24%/year versus 1.85%/year (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.40 to 1.15), death of 4.15%/year versus 5.65%/year (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.98), and major bleeding of 1.86%/year versus 3.06%/year (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.96). In patients who did not receive amiodarone, the stroke or systemic embolism rate was 1.29%/year versus 1.57%/year (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.00), death was 3.43%/year versus 3.68%/year (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.05), and major bleeding was 2.18%/year versus 3.03%/year\n\nThe effect of the amiodarone-warfarin interaction on anticoagulation quality in a single, high-quality anticoagulation center.\n\nPubMed\n\nWhite, Ryan D; Riggs, Kyle W; Ege, Ed J; Petroski, Gregory F; Koerber, Scott M; Flaker, Greg\n\n2016-03-01\n\nClinical trials have reported a low time in therapeutic range (TTR) in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with both warfarin andamiodarone. These trials included centers and countries with both high and low TTRs. What is the impact of amiodarone on the TTR in a single, high-quality anticoagulation clinic? TTR was assessed in amiodarone and nonamiodarone-treated patients from a University anticoagulation clinic. Baseline characteristics between patients ever-taking or never-taking amiodarone were similar, except more amiodarone patients were smokers (19.5 vs. 6.1%, Pâ=â0.0031). The TTR calculated from 8901international normalized ratios (INRs) in 249 nonamiodarone patients with a mean follow-up of 34âÂ±â20 months (mean INR 36âÂ±â18) was 66âÂ±â16.6% compared with 61.3âÂ±â16.2% (Pâ=â0.111) from 1455 INRs in 41 amiodarone-treated patients with a mean follow-up of 28âÂ±â20 months (mean INR 35âÂ±â22). Factors associated with a low TTR were male sex (Pâ=â0.0013), smoker (Pâ=â0.0048), and amiodarone use (Pâ=â0.0374). A second on-treatment analysis, in which the TTR was calculated only during amiodarone therapy, resulted in similar findings; however, amiodarone did not emerge as a predictor of a low TTR. In 11 patients, the TTR prior to amiodarone (54.5âÂ±â22.2%) was not significantly different in the first 3 months (54.6âÂ±â33.4%) or after 3 months (67.2âÂ±â33.7%) of amiodarone. In a single high-quality anticoagulation center, anticoagulation quality, as measured by the TTR, can be comparable in amiodarone and nonamiodarone-treated patients.\n\nAmiodarone Versus Lidocaine for Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Due to Ventricular Arrhythmias: A Systematic Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcBride, Mary E; Marino, Bradley S; Webster, Gregory; Lopez-Herce, JesÃºs; Ziegler, Carolyn P; De Caen, Allan R; Atkins, Dianne L\n\n2017-02-01\n\nWe performed a systematic review as part of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation process to create a consensus on science statement regarding amiodarone or lidocaine during pediatric cardiac arrest for the 2015 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation's Consensus on Science and Treatment Recommendations. Studies were identified from comprehensive searches in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Studies eligible for inclusion were randomized controlled and observational studies on the relative clinical effect of amiodarone or lidocaine in cardiac arrest. Studies addressing the clinical effect of amiodarone versus lidocaine were extracted and reviewed for inclusion and exclusion criteria by the reviewers. Studies were rigorously analyzed thereafter. We identified three articles addressing lidocaine versus amiodarone in cardiac arrest: 1) a prospective study assessing lidocaine versus amiodarone for refractory ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital adults; 2) an observational retrospective cohort study of inpatient pediatric patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received lidocaine, amiodarone, neither or both; and 3) a prospective study of ventricular tachycardia with a pulse in adults. The first study showed a statistically significant improvement in survival to hospital admission with amiodarone (22.8% vs 12.0%; p = 0.009) and a lack of statistical difference for survival at discharge (p = 0.34). The second article demonstrated 44% return of spontaneous circulation for amiodarone and 64% for lidocaine (odds ratio, 2.02; 1.36-3.03) with no statistical difference for survival at hospital discharge. The third article demonstrated 48.3% arrhythmia termination for amiodarone versus 10.3% for lidocaine (p < 0.05). All were classified as lower quality studies without preference for one agent. The confidence in effect estimates is so low that International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation felt\n\nAmiodarone-Associated Optic Neuropathy: A Critical Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPassman, Rod S.; Bennett, Charles L.; Purpura, Joseph M.; Kapur, Rashmi; Johnson, Lenworth N.; Raisch, Dennis W.; West, Dennis P.; Edwards, Beatrice J.; Belknap, Steven M.; Liebling, Dustin B.; Fisher, Mathew J.; Samaras, Athena T.; Jones, Lisa-Gaye A.; Tulas, Katrina-Marie E.; McKoy, June M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAlthough amiodarone is the most commonly prescribed antiarrhythmic drug, its use is limited by serious toxicities, including optic neuropathy. Current reports of amiodarone associated optic neuropathy identified from the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FDA-AERS) and published case reports were reviewed. A total of 296 reports were identified: 214 from AERS, 59 from published case reports, and 23 from adverse events reports for patients enrolled in clinical trials. Mean duration of amiodarone therapy before vision loss was 9 months (range 1-84 months). Insidious onset of amiodarone associated optic neuropathy (44%) was the most common presentation, and nearly one-third were asymptomatic. Optic disc edema was present in 85% of cases. Following drug cessation, 58% had improved visual acuity, 21% were unchanged, and 21% had further decreased visual acuity. Legal blindness (< 20/200) was noted in at least one eye in 20% of cases. Close ophthalmologic surveillance of patients during the tenure of amiodarone administration is warranted.

Peripheral infusion of amiodarone may cause blood vessels irritation and phlebitis that is the most common complication of this drug by this route even when it is administered within recommended dosing limits. The effect of injection-site splinting on the occurrence of phlebitis among a group of cardiac arrhythmia patients receiving peripherally infused amiodarone. This research is a clinical trial on patients of Tehran Heart Center who were hospitalized due to cardiac arrhythmias. A sample of 60 patients with mean age 65Â Â±Â 14Â years were randomly divided into control and test groups. In the experimental group with close splint and restrict the movement of the injection site until the end of the infusion and control groups without closing brace, at the same time received amiodarone. Injection protocol was similar for both groups. The results were analyzed with Spss18. The results of this research still significantly reduced the incidence of amiodarone injection-site phlebitis in the injection time (PÂ =Â .005). Copyright Â© 2016 Society for Vascular Nursing, Inc.

Her postoperative course was complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension and junctional ectopic tachycardia. Following treatment with amiodarone infusion, she developed laboratory indices of acute liver injury. At their peak, liver transaminase levels were 19 to 35 times greater than the upper limit of normal. Transaminitis was accompanied by coagulopathy, hyperammonemia, and high serum lactate and lipid levels. Hepatic laboratory abnormalities began to resolve within 48 hr of stopping amiodarone infusion. Heart rate control was achieved concurrently with discovery of laboratory test result abnormalities, and no further antiarrhythmic therapy was required. The intravenous formulation of amiodarone contains the diluent polysorbate 80, which may have hepatotoxic effects. Specifically, animal studies suggest that polysorbate 80 may destabilize cell membranes and predispose to fatty change within liver architecture. Polysorbate was implicated in infant fatalities from E-ferol use in the 1980s. This case illustrates a possible adverse event by the Naranjo probability scale. Given the extent of clinically apparent hepatic injury, this patient was not rechallenged with amiodarone during the remainder of her hospitalization. With amiodarone now used as first-line pharmacologic therapy for critical tachyarrhythmia in this population, the number of children exposed to this drug should be expected to increase. Laboratory indices of liver function should be evaluated at initiation of amiodarone therapy, as well as frequently throughout duration of therapy. Consideration should be given to polysorbate-free formulation of intravenous amiodarone for use in the cohort with congenital cardiac disease.\n\nSynergistic Effects of Amiodarone and Fluconazole on Candida tropicalis Resistant to Fluconazole\n\nPubMed Central\n\nda Silva, CecÃ­lia Rocha; de Andrade Neto, JoÃ£o Batista; Sidrim, JosÃ© JÃºlio Costa; Ãngelo, Maria RozzelÃª Ferreira; MagalhÃ£es, Hemerson Iury Ferreira; Cavalcanti, Bruno CoÃªlho; Brilhante, Raimunda SÃ¢mia Nogueira; Macedo, Danielle Silveira; de Moraes, Manoel Odorico; Lobo, Marina Duarte Pinto; Grangeiro, Thalles Barbosa\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThere have recently been significant increases in the prevalence of systemic invasive fungal infections. However, the number of antifungal drugs on the market is limited in comparison to the number of available antibacterial drugs. This fact, coupled with the increased frequency of cross-resistance, makes it necessary to develop new therapeutic strategies. Combination drug therapies have become one of the most widely used and effective strategies to alleviate this problem. Amiodarone (AMD) is classically used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and is the drug of choice for patients with arrhythmia. Recent studies have shown broad antifungal activity of the drug when administered in combination with fluconazole (FLC). In the present study, we induced resistance to fluconazole in six strains of Candida tropicalis and evaluated potential synergism between fluconazole and amiodarone. The evaluation of drug interaction was determined by calculating the fractional inhibitory concentration and by performing flow cytometry. We conclude that amiodarone, when administered in combination with fluconazole, exhibits activity against strains of C. tropicalis that are resistant to fluconazole, which most likely occurs via changes in the integrity of the yeast cell membrane and the generation of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage that could lead to cell death by apoptosis.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its antifungal activity is mediated by calcium overload stress, which leads to a rapid nuclear accumulation of the calcineurin-regulated transcription factor CRZ1. In addition, low doses of amiodarone have been reported to be synergistic with fluconazole in fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans. To establish its mechanism of toxicity in C. albicans, we used expression profiling of key pathway genes to examine cellular responses to amiodarone alone and in combination with fluconazole. Gene expression profiling of 59 genes was done in five C. albicans strains (three fluconazole-susceptible strains and two fluconazole-resistant strains) after amiodarone and/or fluconazole exposure. Of the 59 genes, 27 analyzed showed a significant change (>2-fold) in expression levels after amiodarone exposure. The up- or downregulated genes included genes involved in Ca2+ homeostasis, cell wall synthesis, vacuolar/lysosomal transport, diverse pathway regulation, stress response, and pseudohyphal morphogenesis. As expected, fluconazole induces an increase in ergosterol pathway genes expression levels. The combination treatment significantly dampened the transcriptional response to either drug, suggesting that synergism was due to an inhibition of compensatory response pathways. This dampening resulted in a decrease in total ergosterol levels and decreased pseudohyphal formation, a finding consistent with decreased virulence in a murine candidiasis model.

The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: amiodarone therapy group (nâ=â122 patients) and metoprolol therapy group (nâ=â129 patients).In the amiodarone group, the patients received amiodarone tablet orally 1 week before coronary bypass surgery and during the postoperative period. In the metoprolol group, the patients received metoprolol tablet orally 1 week before surgery and during the postoperative period. The AF development rate was retrospectively evaluated between the first 3 days and 4 weeks after surgery.AF developed in 14 patients in the amiodarone group and 16 patients in the metoprolol group 4 weeks after the operation (Pâ=â0.612).No significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of intensive care unit and hospital stay. Furthermore, hospital charges were similar in both groups (Pâ=â0.741).The results of the logistic regression analysis showed age, left ventricular ejection fraction, left atrial diameter, and aortic cross-clamping time to be predictors for postoperative AF.This study demonstrates that amiodarone and metoprolol have similar effects in prevention of AF after cardiac surgery. However, larger-scale studies need to be conducted to substantiate these findings.\n\nAcute amiodarone promotes drift and early termination of spiral wave re-entry.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakagawa, Harumichi; Honjo, Haruo; Ishiguro, Yuko S; Yamazaki, Masatoshi; Okuno, Yusuke; Harada, Masahide; Takanari, Hiroki; Sakuma, Ichiro; Kamiya, Kaichiro; Kodama, Itsuo\n\n2010-07-01\n\nIntravenous application of amiodarone is commonly used in the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the acute effects of amiodarone on spiral wave (SW) re-entry, the primary organization machinery of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF), in comparison with lidocaine. A two-dimensional ventricular myocardial layer was obtained from 24 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, and epicardial excitations were analyzed by high-resolution optical mapping. During basic stimulation, amiodarone (5 microM) caused prolongation of action potential duration (APD) by 5.6%-9.1%, whereas lidocaine (15 microM) caused APD shortening by 5.0%-6.4%. Amiodarone and lidocaine reduced conduction velocity similarly. Ventricular tachycardias induced by DC stimulation in the presence of amiodarone were of shorter duration (sustained-VTs >30 s/total VTs: 2/58, amiodarone vs 13/52, control), whereas those with lidocaine were of longer duration (22/73, lidocaine vs 14/58, control). Amiodarone caused prolongation of VT cycle length and destabilization of SW re-entry, which is characterized by marked prolongation of functional block lines, frequent wavefront-tail interactions near the rotation center, and considerable drift, leading to its early annihilation via collision with anatomical boundaries. Spiral wave re-entry in the presence of lidocaine was more stabilized than in control. In the anisotropic ventricular myocardium, amiodarone destabilizes SW re-entry facilitating its early termination. Lidocaine, in contrast, stabilizes SW re-entry resulting in its persistence.\n\nAmiodarone affects Ebola virus binding and entry into target cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalata, Cristiano; Munegato, Denis; Martelli, Francesco; Parolin, Cristina; Calistri, Arianna; Baritussio, Aldo; PalÃ¹, Giorgio\n\n2018-03-02\n\nEbola Virus Disease is one of the most lethal transmissible infections characterized by a high fatality rate. Several research studies have aimed to identify effective antiviral agents. Amiodarone, a drug used for the treatment of arrhythmias, has been shown to inhibit filovirus infection in vitro by acting at the early step of the viral replication cycle. Here we demonstrate that amiodarone reduces virus binding to target cells and slows down the progression of the viral particles along the endocytic pathway. Overall our data support the notion that amiodarone interferes with Ebola virus infection by affecting cellular pathways/targets involved in the viral entry process.\n\nHepatotoxicity After Continuous Amiodarone Infusion in a Postoperative Cardiac Infant\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKicker, Jennifer S.; Haizlip, Julie A.; Buck, Marcia L.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA former 34-week-old female infant with Down syndrome underwent surgical correction of a congenital heart defect at 5 months of age.

AIT is classified as type 1 or type 2. Type 1 AIT occurs in patients with underlying thyroid pathology such as autonomous nodular goiter or Gravesâ disease. Type 2 AIT is a result of amiodarone causing a subacute thyroiditis with release of preformed thyroid hormones into the circulation. OBJECTIVES: To review the literature and present an overview of the differentiation between and management of type 1 and type 2 AIT. METHODS: PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Medscape searches of all available English language articles from 1983 to 2006 were performed. Search terms included âamiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosisâ, âcomplicationsâ, âmanagementâ, âtreatmentâ and âcolour flow Dopper sonographyâ. RESULTS: There is evidence to suggest that to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 AIT, a careful history and physical examination should be performed to identify pre-existing thyroid disease. An iodine-131 uptake test and colour flow Doppler sonography should be performed. Patients with type 2 AIT should receive a trial of glucocorticoids, whereas those with type 1 should receive antithyroid therapy. For patients in whom the mechanism of the thyrotoxicosis is unclear, a combination of prednisone and antithyroid therapy may be considered.

However, in patients concurrently treated with amiodarone, cardiac side effects have been described, resulting in an official warning in 2015 by the American Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency when combining those substances. This deprived numerous hepatitis C patients with concurrent cardiovascular problems of receiving this highly effective treatment. Here we present a treatment alternative with an elbasvir/grazoprevir regimen, based on our successful treatment of a patient under concurrent amiodarone therapy. Our observations indicate that patients treated with amiodarone can finally benefit from effective antiviral therapy.

We previously studied 354 patients prescribed amiodarone in whom the occurrence of hyperthyroidism was associated with major adverse cardiovascular events including heart failure, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, stroke and even death [1]. We now present a case of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism complicated by isolated right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension that resolved with treatment of hyperthyroidism.

A.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nAmiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent unrelated to other drugs in current use. It has been little used in Britain, and no formal clinical trials have been possible because the drug has not been licensed by the Committee on Safety of Medicines. Nevertheless it has unique properties which can be valuable in the treatment of a wide spectrum of arrhythmias, particularly supraventricular tachycardias. Amiodarone has a slow onset of action and is cumulative. A sustained action is therefore achieved without the need for frequent maintenance dosage. Fifty patients have been treated with amiodarone in maintenance doses ranging from 200 mg on alternate days to 200 mg twice daily either alone, or in combination with conventional therapy. All were resistant to conventional therapy alone or could not be treated with usual agents because of unwanted drug effects. Of 27 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, 18 were completely controlled and the other 9 were markedly improved. Six of 8 patients with recurrent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias were well controlled symptomatically. Results were predictably less satisfactory in 15 high risk post-infarction patients with malignant arrhythmias and severe myocardial damage, but 6 were probably improved as a result of amiodarone. All patients on maintenance therapy for 3 months or more developed corneal microdeposits. None has any visual symptoms or other ocular defect, and treatment has not been curtailed as a result of this well recognized effect which is believed to be reversible and benign. Amiodarone can control patients with otherwise refractory arrhythmias including some which are life-threatening. Formal clinical trials are needed to define accurately its future role in the prevention and treatment of serious rhythm disorders of the heart.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone was found to be 168 Î¼IU/mL (nl. 0.3-5 Î¼IU/mL) and free thyroxine (FT4) was <0.2 ng/dL (nl. 0.8-1.8 ng/dL). He received intravenous fluids, vasopressor therapy and stress dose steroids; he was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. He received 500 Î¼g of intravenous levothyroxine in the first 18 h of therapy, and 150 Âµg intravenous daily thereafter. Haemodynamic improvement, along with complete recovery of mental status, occurred after 48 h. Twelve hours after the initiation of therapy, FT4 was 0.96 ng/dL. The patient was maintained on levothyroxine 175 (g POorally daily. A thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse heterogeneity. The 24 hour excretion of iodine was 3657 (mcg (25-756 ( mcg). The only two cases of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma in the literature report patient death despite supportive therapy and thyroid hormone replacement. This case represents the most thoroughly investigated case of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma with a history significant for subclinical thyroid disease.\n\nAnalysis of computed tomography density of liver before and after amiodarone administration.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsuda, Masazumi; Otaka, Aoi; Tozawa, Tomoki; Asano, Tomoyuki; Ishiyama, Koichi; Hashimoto, Manabu\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTo evaluate CT density of liver changes between before and after amiodarone administration. Twenty-five patients underwent non-enhanced CT including the liver before and after amiodarone administration. We set regions of interest (ROIs) at liver S8, spleen, paraspinal muscle, and calculated average CT density in these ROIs, then compared CT density between liver and other organs. Statistical differences between CT density of liver and various ratios before and after administration were determined, along with correlations between cumulative dose of amiodarone and liver density after administration, density change of liver, and various ratios after administration. Liver density, liver-to-spleen ratio, and liver-to-paraspinal muscle ratio differed significantly between before and after amiodarone administration. No significant correlations were found between cumulative doses of amiodarone and any of liver density after administration, density change of liver, or various ratios after administration. CT density of liver after amiodarone administration was significantly higher than that before administration. No correlations were identified between cumulative dose of amiodarone and either liver density after administration or density change of liver. Amiodarone usage should be checked when radiologists identify high density of the liver on CT.\n\nAmiodarone prophylaxis for tachycardias after coronary artery surgery: a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nButler, J; Harriss, D R; Sinclair, M; Westaby, S\n\n1993-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND--Arrhythmias are a common cause of morbidity after cardiac surgery. This study assessed the efficacy of prophylactic amiodarone in reducing the incidence of atrial fibrillation or flutter and ventricular arrhythmias after coronary artery surgery. METHODS--A double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial. 60 patients received a 24 hour intravenous infusion of amiodarone (15 mg/kg started after removal of the aortic cross clamp) followed by 200 mg orally three times daily for 5 days, and 60 patients received placebo. RESULTS--6 patients (10%) in the amiodarone group and 14 (23%) in the placebo group needed treatment for arrhythmias (95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the difference between groups was 0 to 26%, p = 0.05). The incidence of supraventricular tachycardia detected clinically and requiring treatment was lower in the amiodarone group (8% amiodarone v 20% placebo, 95% CI 0 to 24%, p = 0.07). The incidence detected by 24 hour Holter monitoring was similar (17% amiodarone v 20% placebo). Untreated arrhythmias in the amiodarone group were either clinically benign and undetected (n = 3) or the ventricular response rate was slow (n = 2). Age > 60 years was a positive risk factor for the development of supraventricular tachycardia in the amiodarone group but not in the placebo group. Fewer patients had episodes of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation recorded on Holter monitoring in the amiodarone group (15% amiodarone v 33% placebo, 95% CI 3 to 33%, p = 0.02). Bradyca"
