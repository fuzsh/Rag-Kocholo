Early Muslim scholars were able to communicate with their Westerncounterparts through contacts made during the Crusades; at Muslim universitiesand centres of learning in Muslim Spain (al-Andalus, or Andalusia) and Sicily towhich many European students went for education; and at the universities andcentres of learning in Europe itself (such as Salerno, Padua, Montpellier, Paris,and Oxford), where Islamic works were taught in Latin translations. Among theMuslim scholars well-known in the centres of learning throughout the worldwere al-F&i (Rhazes), Ibn Sin2 (Avicenna), Ibn Rushd (Averroes), a1Khwiuizmiand Ibn Khaldm. Muslim scholars such as these and others produced originalworks in many fields. Many of them possessed encyclopaedic knowledge anddistinguished themselves in many disparate fields of knowledge. In view of this, the Center for Muslim Contribution to Civilization was estab-lished in order to acquaint non-Muslims with the contributions Islam has givento human civilization as a whole. The Great Books of Islamic Civilization Projectattempts to cover the first 800 years of Islam, or what may be called Islam'sClassical Period. This project aims at making available in English a wide selectionof works representative of Islamic civilization in all its diversity. It is made upof translations of original Arabic works that were produced in the formativecenturies of Islam, and is meant to serve the needs of a potentially large reader-ship. Not only the specialist and scholar, hut the non-specialist with an interestin Islam and its cultural heritage will he able to benefit from the series.Together, the works should serve as a rich source for the study of the early periodsof Islamic thought. In selecting the books for the series, the Center took into account all majorareas of Islamic intellectual pursuit that could be represented. Thus the seriesincludes works not only on better-known subjects such as law, theology,jurisprudence, history and politics, but also on subjects such as literature, medi-cine, astronomy, optics and geography. The specific criteria used to selectindividual books were these: that a hook should give a faithful and comprehensiveaccount of its field; and that it should be an authoritative source. The readerthus has at his disposal virtually a whole library of informative and enlighteningworks. Each book in the series has been translated by a qualified scholar and reviewedby another expert. While the style of one translation will naturally differ from\n\nP:09\n\nx THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMADanother, the translators have endeavoured, to the extent it was possible, to makethe works accessible to the common reader. As a rule, the use of foomotes hasbeen kept to a minimum, though a more extensive use of them was necessitatedin some cases. This series is presented in the hope that it will contribute to a greater under-standing in the West of the cultural and intellectual heritage of Islam and willtherefore provide an important means towards greater understanding of today'sworld. May God Help Us! Muhammad bin Hamad Al-Thani Chairman of the Board of Trustees\n\nP:10\n\nABOUT TIHIS SERIESTHISseries of Arabic works, made available in English translation, represents anoutstanding selection of important Islamic studies in a variety of fields of knowl-edge. The works selected for inclusion in this series meet specific criteria. Theyare recognized by Muslim scholarsas being early and important in their fields, asworks whose importance is broadly recognized by international scholars, and ashaving had a genuinely significant impact on the development of human culhire. Readers will therefore see that this series includes a variety of works in thepurely Islamic sciences, such as Qur'an, hadith, theology, prophetic traditions(sunna), and jurisprudence Viyh). Also represented will he hooks by Muslimscientists on medicine, astronomy, geography, physics, chemistry, horticulture,and other fields. The work of translating these texts has been entrusted to a group of profes-sors in the Islamic and Western worlds who are recognized authorities in theirfields. It has been deemed appropriate, in order to ensure accuracy and fluency,that two persons, one with Arabic as his mother tongue and another withEnglish as his mother tongue, should participate together in the translation andrevision of each text. This series is distinguished from other similar intercultural projects by itsdistinctive objectives and methodology. These works will fill a genuine gap inthe library of human thought. They will prove extremely useful to all those withan interest in Islamic culture, its interaction with Western thought, and itsimpact on culture throughout the world. They will, it is hoped, fulfil an importantr61e in enhancing world understanding at a time when there is such evident andurgent need for the development of peaceful coexistence. This series is published by the Center for Muslim Contribution toCivilization, which serves as a research centre under the patronage of H.H.Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, Amir of Qatar. It is directed by a Board ofTrustees chaired by H.E. Sheikh Muhammad bin Hamad al-Thani, the formerMinister of Education of Qatar. The ~ o a r his comprised of a group ofprominent scholars. These include H.E. Dr Ahul-Wafa al-Taftazani*, DeputyRector of Cairo University, and Dr Yusuf al-Qaradhaw Director of the Siraand Sunna Research Center. At its inception the Center was directed by the lateD r Mohammad Ihrahim Kazim, former Rector of Qatar University, who estah-lished its initial objectives. The Center was until recently directed by Dr Kamal Nagi, the Foreign CulturalRelations Advisor of the Ministry of Education of Qatar.

Wmar b. Kathir,' and,to a lesser extent, its editor, Mggafa 'Abd al-Wahid. In his introduction to theArabic, 'Abd al-Wshid points out that this work is in fact the culmination of asearch for a biography of the Prophet Muhammad to which Ibn Kathir makesreference in his celebrated exegesis of the Qur'm. There is, however, no extantcopy of any such independent biographical study traceable to Ibn Kathir. Thatsuch a study did exist is questionable, notwithstandingIhn Kathir's own allusionthereto. Given the unavailability of this particular work, 'Abd al-Wahid offersthe theory that the biography in question is none other than that which appearsin Ibn Kathir's chief work, his opus on history, the al-B~dayawa al-Nzh~yaH.~eargues that the sira section of the latter work is so comprehensive in its analysisof the life and times of the Prophet Muhammad as to almost obviate the need forany independent study of the same topic. The biography at hand, therefore, is thesame as found in the al-Brd~yaN. evertheless, 'Abd al-W@d must be commendedfor the not inconsiderable task of editing and publishing this particular section asan independent unit, and appropriately titling it al-Sira al-Nabawyya zI IbnKathir. Ibn Kathir, whose ancestors are said to have been from Iraq, was himselfborn around the year 1313 c~/700AH in the Boesra district of easternDamascus. He died 74 years later, shortly after suffering a total loss of vision.He counts as his tutors such illustrious personages as the eminent historianShams al-Din al-Dhahabi, the MZliki jurist Aba Mas%al-Qarsi, and the cele-brated Damascene polemicist and jurist Ibn Taymiyya al-Harrmi. Ibn Kathir's was an era of the great political and social upheavals that posedmany challenges to the Muslim world at large, and in particular, to its scholars.What with the scourge of the Tartars threatening the very existence of Islam as asoci~politicael ntity from the outside and the sectarian and ethnic strife createdby the Mamluk revolution doing much the same from within, Ibn Kathir and his 1. According to R. Y. Curtis, Authoritative Interpretation of Clanical Islamic Taf3r: CriticalAmlyni of Ibn Kathir's Tafjir ol-@+hn al-'Asfm (unpublished dissertation, Ann Arbor:University of Michigan, 1989) (21), d a s s i d bibliographershave cited Ihn Kathir's name in morethan one way. Al-Dbahabi for insrance, in the supplement to his bibliography,Dhayl Tadhkirot al-Huffzz, gives Ibn Kathrr's name as Ism%'llh. Wmar b. Kathir b. paw h. Kathir h. Zar'. Otherversions have been given, however, such as apptar in al-Zirikli's al-A'hm (1: 320) and Wmar RidaKahhaa's Muyarn ol-Mu'olli@n (1: 28). 2. According to C. Brockelman in his Gesclri~hteder Arabjschen Literatur ii. 49, this historicalwork of Ihn Kathir is itself based on d-Bi-li's chronicle. For more information see also, IhnHadjar d-Asqalmi, a l - h a r al-Kzmim (Cad. Vierma, no. 1172).\n\nP:15\n\nxvi THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMADcolleagues, no doubt, had huge challenges with which to contend. In addition,the unrelenting pestilence and drought that had plagued the Levant and areaseast thereof, made their burden all the more unwieldy. He died in 1387 c ~ / 7 7 5AH and lies buried in Damascus next to his master, Ibn Taymiyyah. He wasmourned by his wife Zaynab, the daughter of his teacher, al-Mizzi, who, accordingto some reports, was an accomplished scholar in her own right. She bore h i foursons, one of whom succeeded his father to the post of principal of the teachingacademy al-Madrasa a l - S ~ l & i ~ ~ a . ~ Ibn Kathir, true to the pre-eminent tendencies of the academic milieu withinwhich he functioned, brings to his study of the Prophet of Islam the method of themuhaddith, the scholar of hadith traditions, more assiduouslythan he does that ofthe traditional historian. In doing so, however, he has, I believe, substantiallysucceeded in combining two of the three sources available for the pursuit of thehistorical Muhammad: the hadith literature and the sira; the Qur'm, being thethird such source, features less prominently, if not altogether rarely, in hisstudy. Given the very extensive usage of hadith material in this particular work,a word about the classical nature of such material and its contemporaneousvalidity would be appropriate at this point. Early historical studies of Muslim society and culture, as A. A. Duri pointsout, \\\"followed broadly two lines that were distinct from each other - that ofhadith, and that of the tribes (i.e. the ayyam anecdotes as narrated by theakhbaris and the ruwat), which is in a sense a continuation of pre-Islamicactivities. \\\"These two lines\\\", he explains, \\\"reflect the two major currents inearly Islamic society - the Islamic and the mbal lines which influenced allaspects of lifen4According to Muslim tradition, the learning and transmissionof the sayings and actions of Muhammad, his tacit approvals and disapprovalsofthe actions of others, and his general behaviour had religious significance secondonly to that of the Qw'm.T o that end Muslim scholars began the collection ofsuch data as was related to the Prophet and his era even while he was stillalive. At first, the system of oral retention was popular, but by the middle of thefirst century of the Muslim era, written compilations of hadith traditions beganto appear. By the end of the third quarter of that century, 'Lapattern was fixedfor the learning and teaching of the hadith which flourished in the second andthud centurie~.\\\"~A system of sorts for verifying the authenticity of suchprophetic traditions was allegedly extant from the earliest of times - albeit in a 3. Curtis, 23. 4. Professor Duri's article is in large measure an elucidation of what he calls \\\"the mbal type ofhistory\\\". See in this regard 'The Iraq School of History to the Ninth Century', in HistoriansacheMiddle East, ed. B. Lewis and P. M. Holt (Oxford UniversityPress, 1962). 5. M. M. Azami, Studies in Ean'y Hndith Litwattrre (Indianapolis: American Trust Publications,1983), 186,\n\nP:16\n\nINTRODUCTION xviirather rudimentary manner. That system, however, was neither systematizednor rigorously applied until the advent of the civil wars Gtna), whereuponsources were no longer regarded, prima facie, as trustworthy, but were insteadincreasingly scrutinized to establish authenticity. Thus evolved the elaboratei s n ~ dsystem where every kadith was scrutinized from two perspectives: the text(matn) containing the information transmitted as such, and the chain of trans-mitters (sanad) giving the names of all those responsible for transmitting suchinformation from the Prophet himself. As indicated earlier, Ibn Kathir's method in this particular work is more thatof the hadith scholars than it is of the historian; al-Bukhari, Muslim and moreso, al-Baihaqi, Alpnad b. Hanbal, and Abii Nu'aim thus feature more promi-nently as sources for his biography than do historians such as Ibn Ishaq, IbnHish%n or Tabari. But, as 'Abd al-Wshid rightly points out, Ibn Kathir, onoccasion, is not averse to using some rather obscure historical works, some eventhat are no longer extant: the rare historical tractate of Masa b. Uqba, and theal-Ram4 al-Arrf of al-Suhayli are examples thereof. True to tradition, if not quite on the same scale as, for instance, Ibn Hishzm,are Ibn Kathir's copious citations of poetry, almost all of which seem to have beentaken from Muhammad b. Ishaq's biography of the Prophet. The poems deal witha variety of themes and styles: there is, for instance, the unmistakable sarcasm ofKa'ab b. Zuhayr as reflected in his lampooning of the Prophet, followed by hissubsequent retraction and apology as in the much celebrated poem, Elhut SuC(i.d;there is also the occasional celebration of pre-Islamic Arabian chivalry, as in thehaunting ode of Aba al-Bakhtari b. Hishm, when he speaks so movingly of hisvirtual self-immolation for the love of a friend. Then, of course, there are theevocative panegyrics of Hasssn b, Thiibit in defence of Islam, its Prophet, andhis Companions. Ibn Kathir, oddly enough for someone who has plumbed the depths of hadithmethodology, frequently paraphrases, not just the many references to scholarssuch as Ibn I s h ~ qb, ut also, at times, the very hadith material he so often quotes.He thus takes almost the same liberties with such material as he does withworks on history, and the reader, particularly of the Arabic text, sometimessearches in vain for all but the gist of the traditions that he ascribes to, say, thesahih of Bukhari or that of Muslim. 'Abd al-Wihid offers two possible reasonsfor this anomaly; the one I believe to be somewhat more plausible than theother. It may well be, he suggests, that Ibn Kathir was simply quoting frommemory, seeing no need for any further textual verification, or it may also bethat he is, in fact, using sources unavailable to us today. This latter hypothesisis, I believe, somewhat disingenuous for it requires, amongst other things, thatIbn Kathir possessed not one, but an entire set of hadith works unique to hislibrary alone!\n\nP:17\n\nxviii THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD The text itself suffers from a singular lack of the literary cadence that makesthe historical works of al-Tahari, for instance, more of a pleasure to read. Thisseems to result from Ihn Kathir's efforts to present an authentic description ofthe life and times of the Prophet of Islam, and to submit such data as is found inthe popular biographical works to the scrutiny of had& literature. The flow ofhis text is, without question, a casualty of this exercise. But, as has been pointedout by a scholar of the Bible, \\\"If we read biblical narrative (or in this case the siramaterial) as a story, we abandon its historical truth. If we read it as literature, wewill often find literary art in it, but this art takes us further from truth.\\\"6 Notthat the method of Ibn Kathir is altogether without its redeeming features: itcertainly provides useful information to scholars, particularly those of the tradi-tional schools, who would prefer to have the classical sources for sira studiesclose at hand. The contents of works such as Ibn Kathir's sir&are today regarded by manyscholars of Islam as largely proto-historical, focusing, that is, on an era whosesource documentation falls short of contemporary historiographical standards.It is, some say, the stuff of myth and legend, entwined in places with real his-torical data. For modem historians of Islam and the Middle East such asMaxime Rodinson, Patricia Crone et al., sira material contains, in the firstinstance, virtually \\\"nothing of which we can say for certain that it incontestablydates back to the time of the Prophetw.' And so, \\\"when doing research aboutthe life and work of the Prophet Muhammad\\\", Rudi Paret warns, \\\"we on prin-ciple distrust the traditional statement and explanation of facts given by latergenerations, in so far as they cannot be verified by internal evidence or in someother way.''8 In addition, the work at hand may be seen by some to be no more than theproduct of one who had a variety of interests in the topic: one who was, at oneand the same time, a historian, a scribe of \\\"sacred biography\\\", and also a devotee;the results of an endeavour such as Ihn Kathir's, therefore, risk being perceivedas less than the product of dispassionate scholarship? This critical approach to Islamic historiography emerged gradually in the18th and 19th centuries. It was, understandably, only a matter of time beforeAlbert Schweitzer's \\\"quest of the historical Christ\\\" would be appropriated by 6. See Robin L. Fox, The U~ourhon~eVdersion: Truth and Fiction in the Bible (New York:Alfred A. Knopf, 1992). 7. This particular statement appears in the ineoduction to Maxime Rodinson's own biographyof the Prophet.

Yet the entireprocess is, I believe, fraught with questionable hypotheses, broad generalizationsand a certain disregard for the spatiwtemporal factors that shape ostensibly sim-ilar events. The application of New Testament heuristic tools such as Form andRedaction criticism to the corpus of information pertaining to the sira seems tobetray a casual disregard for the Sitz im Leben of that very corpus. The life andwork of Jesus is clearly different from that of Muhammad; the former's mission- if it can be described as such -is, for example, singularly devdid of the politicaland socio-economic objectives that informed that of the latter. It is, therefore,hardly surprising, as F. E. Peters in his recent article \\\"The Quest of theHistorical Muhammad\\\" points out, that 'Leventhough a great deal of effort hasbeen invested in research into the life and times of Muhammad, the results donot seem at aJl comparable to those achieved in research on Jesus, and the reasonsare not at all ~ l e a r . \\\" ' ~ Ever since Gustav Weil presented his Mohammad der Prophet, sein Leben undseine Lehre in 1843, scholars have endeavoured to unravel the historicalMuhammad using a variety of tools and strategems. Initially the materialoffered by Muslim historians such as Ibn IshZq, Ibn Hishzm and more import-antly, al-Tabari was used almost unquestioningly by Christian scholars who, asHolt characterizes them, belonged mainly to \\\"holy orders\\\".\\\" Their primarypurpose, it would seem, was to provide a spirited defence of Christian theologyand dogma against the claims of Islam and its adherents. The polemics thatensued were, in the main, reflective of the attitude that there was \\\"not anyrational inducement in all (that Muslims) believe or practice; insomuch thatcommon sense must be discarded in order to embrace their system.\\\"'2 As forMuhammad, he was for many in that era \\\"so coarse and barbarous an imposter,that there is not a man, who does not or cannot perceive plainly his cheat andc~rruption.\\\"'~Humphrey Prideaux, the 17th-century lecturer in Hebrew atOxford, captured rather succinctly the disposition of scholars vis-d-vis thestudy of Muhammad, in the rather long-winded title of his work, The truenature of imposturefuNy display'd in the life of Mahornet.

Offered to the consideration ofthe Deists of the present age.I4 Later Simon Ockley, the somewhat less acerbicand brusque vicar of Swavesey in Cambridgeshire, authored The History of theSaracens, a \\\"much more solid contribution to historical knowledge\\\" as Holtputs it, but one that none the less did \\\"not fail to follow common form bystigmatizing Muhammad in his first line, as 'the great Imposter' and thendescribing the Arab conquests as 'that grievous calamity'.\\\"15 The liberalism thatswept across Europe in the 18th century helped create a relatively less hostileattitude among European scholars towards Islam and its leader. We thusfind during that era scholars such as Henri de Boulainvillier emerging.Boulainvillier, his theological affinities notwithstanding, assumed a decidedlymore conciliatory tone in his biography of Muhammad, La vie de Mahomet. Forhim, Christianity is undoubtedly superior to Islam but he is, none the less,quite charitable in his evaluation of his subject, and says: \\\"With respect to theessential doctrines of religion, all that (Muhammad) has laid down is true; buthe has not laid down all that is true; and that is the whole difference betweenour religion and his.\\\"16 The quest itself began in earnest in the writings of the Belgian Jesuit, HenriLammens. Whereas Theodor Noeldeke, prior to him, had largely failed in hisattempts to unravel \\\"the historical person of Muhammad\\\", Lammens ploddedon, and succeeded to some extent, in demonstrating \\\"the possibility of the criti-ical analysis of the sira\\\". Lammens' efforts, however, were directed, not at abiographical study of Muhammad per se, but rather on the search for the secretof his personal appeal and the rapid expansion of his message. \\\"Muhammad tohim, was a historical problem as well as a symbol of Islam's obstinacy and insen-sitiveness to the missionary influence.\\\"I7 Lammens also happened to be among the first to argue, with some conviction,that the hadith traditions as well as the sira material on the Prophet are, on thewhole, fictitious. This inaugurated a new perspective on Islamic history: theemphasis shifted from a critique of the actors in that history to the questioningof the source material itself. In the 19th century, the Hungarian scholar Ignaz Goldziier concluded thatmuch of the hadith material was but a \\\"pious fraud . . . invoked by every group(in early Islam) for every idea it evolved; . . . through solid chains (isnad)of tra-dition, all such matters acquired an unbroken tie to the 'Companions' who hadheard those pronouncements and statutes from the Prophet or had seen him act 14.

Lewis and P. M. Holt (Oxford UniversityPress, 1962), 330-342.\n\nP:20\n\nINTRODUCTION xxiin pertinent ways.\\\"18 Later Professor J. Schacht further explored the foregoinghypotheses by subjecting the zsnlad of a few legal traditions to an exhaustivescrutiny. He concluded that L'hardlyany of these traditions, as far as matters ofreligious law are concerned, can be considered authentic; they were put into cir-culation . . . from the first half of the second century onward^.\\\"'^ From thisothers were quick to extrapolate that even the biographical material is fraudu-lent. Crone thus states: \\\"that the bulk of the sira . . . consists of second centuryhadiths has not been disputed by any historian, and this point may he taken asconceded.\\\" Not all Western scholars, however were as eager to jettison the classicalmaterial. W. M. Watt, writing in his Muhammad at Mecca, is clearly morereluctant than Crone, for example, to reject out of hand all such material, simplyon the strength of Schacht's conclusion. He thus maintains that \\\"In the legalsphere there may have been some sheer invention of traditions, it would seem.But in the historical sphere, in so far as the two may be separated, and apartfrom some exceptional cases, the nearest to such invention in the best earlyhistorians appears to be a 'tendential shaping' of the material . . .\\\"\\\" It must he remembered, however, that traditionalMuslim scholars display littleawareness of the foregoing conundrum. The classical methodology of hadithcriticism as practised by early Muslim scholars, with its close scrutiny of the rmDdand the mutiin of prophetic traditions, has, in the main, not been discredited, oreven questioned, by Muslii scholars. If anything, that methodology has todaybeen given a new lease of life by scholars such as N z i r al-Din al-Albmi, who, forexample, regard the re-evaluation of the early sources as integral to what they callthe Islamic renaissance (al-Nah& al-Islamyya). Such a renaissance, A l W argues,will fall far short of its goals, without a thoroughgoing purge of what remains ofthe spurious material that had crept into hadith and sira works during the turbu-lent epoch of early Islamic history* He thus set himself the task of appraisingscholars and the Muslim laity alike to those traditions that were deemed spuriousby the regimen of classical hadith studies. His findmgs, which were first publishedunder the title \\\"al-Ahzdith al-Da'ifah wa al-Mauda'ah\\\" in a weekly column inthe magazine al-Tamaddun al-Islami, now comprise a multi-volume work,appropriately titled Silszlah al-Ahzdirh al-Da'ifah wa a l - M a ~ d i i h h . ~ ~ 18.

He maintains that thetheories of Margoliouth, Goldziher and more recently, Schacht can no longer beincontestably accepted given the recent discoveries of manuscripts or research.According to him \\\"In the period referred to, works on the biography of the Prophet and on other historical topics were in a very advanced stage. We h d that work on the biography of the Prophet was begun by the Companions. 'Abd All* b. <Amrb. &'As recorded many historical events. It is possible still to trace his work in the ahadith narrated by 'Amr b. Shu'aib (d. 118 AH) as he utilized his great grandfather CAbd All* b. 'Amr's books. Wrwah (d. 93 AH) in his biography of the Prophet names his authority and most probably he had obtained the information in writing. There are works mentioned here and there on a single topic of the Sirah, e.g. Memorandum on rke Servants of the Propher, a book on the ambassadors of the Prophet to different rulers and chieftains with their negotiations. There are referencesto the collections of the Prophet's letters in a very early period.\\\"\\\" But it is, in fact, these very sources that Azami cites that have, through the useof contemporary literary and hermeneutical tools, been relegated to no morethan \\\"the rubble of early Muslim history\\\". For Patricia Crone therefore, the\\\"inertia\\\" of material such as appears heretofore \\\"comes across very strongly inmodern scholarship on the first two centuries of Islam.\\\"2s \\\"The hulk of it\\\", sheargues, \\\"has an alarming tendency to degenerate into mere rearrangements ofthe same old canon - Muslim chronicles in modem languages and graced withmodern titles.\\\"26 Others, such as Juynboll, have sthved to arrive at the inevitable solution inter-mLdiaire, \\\"a conceivable position that could he taken between the two points ofview represented respectively by Muslim and Western s~holarshi~.\\\"~F'or h itherefore, the hadiih traditions \\\"taken as a whole\\\" do provide a fairly reliablerendition of early Islamic history, and \\\"a judiciously and cautiously formulatedoverall view of what all those early reports . . . collectively point to, may in alllikelihood be taken to be not very far from the truth of 'what really happened'.\\\"28 24.

Attempts at translation, therefore, inevitably represent strivings forcompromise. While accuracy and precision are prime objectives, the ultimatelynecessary requirements for clarity and comprehension in the host language mayrequire simplification or even omission from the original text. The dilemmasinherent in these conflicting objectives are at times irreconcilable, and this isparticularly true when one is dealing, as here, with languages and cultures so farremoved as ancient Arabic and modern English. This translation, composed ineveryday, contemporary English, gives no impression of the ubiquitous rarities,oddities and archaisms of vocabulary and syntax that make the originalextremely challenging to comprehend. It is hoped, of course, that the innumer-able compromises that this translation represents will be accepted as good-faithattempts to convey the spirit and purpose of the original in a form that readers ofEnglish wiU not find impossibly daunting. In some instances Ihn Kathir repeats anecdotal ahadith with differing chainsof authority that are almost identical in content; often, as will be seen, theaccounts differ in only very few of their words and these are typically vocabularyrarities. While such variations between accounts may seem of scant interest tothe Western reader, they have nevertheless been left complete and intact in thistranslation. Including them in full, as in the original work, gives a strong impres-sion of the care with which these anecdotes have been handed down and theimpression of their likely authenticity is therefore enhanced. This seems espe-cially the case where the discrepancies involve vocabulary rarities that aresynonymous. It seems that it would be just such words that would have beensubjected to dispute, change or loss from memory. Ibn Kathir's objective was to appear authoritative and discriminating in hischoices of inclusion and discussion of specific ahndith; to himthe listing of allthe names of his authorities and his comments on their reputations was an essen-tial component of this lectnres. The give-and-take of oral lecturing - of which-this work is essentially a record would have enabled immediate verbalclarification. Our English text, in contrast, has to stand by itself, and to presentan inherent and visible logic and clarity; it must also give some impression of thereliability of the Arabic text that is indicated by its complexity, and by the carewith which the names of quoted sources are given and at times evaluated. A perpetual challenge in presenting this text has therefore been to leave theessential narratives clear and succinct while including yet simplifying the lines ofauthority on which their authenticity is based. The names of authorities quoted\n\nP:24\n\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE XXVhave been included in full, since their identities were of prime importance forthe initial 'readership' of this work as well as to students and researchers today.However, the exact nature and relative value of the means of transmission fromauthority to authority and the suggestions implied of Ibn Kathir's preference forcertain sources over others, have not been conveyed with exactitude, since com-mon English vocabulary is unable to convey some of the subtleties of the Arabictechnical terms employed for this purpose. The essential completeness of theoriginal text in this translation does, however, enable serious students of earlyIslamic materials to bring their own differentiation to bear by their knowledge ofthe reputations of the persons quoted. Certain words common in this text - such as A& and sarat - change in theirform in Arabic to accord with basic grammatical rules. Here, however, to avoidconfusion for those readers who do not know Arabic, they have been left in theform in which they are most commonly met. Initial hamza, moreover, has beenomitted. Since early Arabic manuscripts, like the Arabic printed version of thistext, are devoid of quotation marks, the identity of the narrator is sometimesunclear. Similarly, it is occasionally difficult to discern whether comments at theend of an account are those of the transmitting authority or of Ibn Katbir him-self. Footnotes referring to these and similar textual difficulties have been keptto a minimum, while brief parenthetical explanatory comments have sometimesbeen inserted to aid the general reader. Discriminating and knowledgeable readers and reviewers will no doubt finddiscrepancies and perhaps inaccuracies in this lengthy and demanding text,especially in the extensive poems quoted. For these the translator - and hisreviewers, text editors and typesetters - apologize. But since this work offersintimate details not elsewhere available in English about Arabian history and theinspiration and leadership of Islam in its earliest formative period, it would seemunsatisfactory to leave it in a language and form accessible only to a small coterieof scholars. The evident religious historical and philosophical interest of thistext suggests that all those associated with its production may properly takerefuge and find consolation from criticism in the knowledge that 'to err ishuman'. T o attempt the impossible, moreover, while perhaps foolhardy, issurely more laudable than to make no attempt at all.Trevor Le GassickAnn Arbor. 1997\n\nP:26\n\nVOLUME II n the name of God, the most Benefcent, the most MercifulIt has been said that all Arabs trace their origins to Ishmael, the son of Abraham;upon them both be peace, salutation, and homage. However, what is well knownto be true is that the 'arab al-'Ariba (the original Arabs) came before Ishmael.Among them were the peoples of Ad, Thamad, Tasm, Jadis, Umaym, Jurhum,and the CAmeliq, as well as others known only to God. Also, these peoples bothcame before and were contemporaries of al-Khalil.' Yet the 'arab al-musta'riba(the Arabized Arabs), the Arabs of the Hijzz, were descendants of Ishmael, sonof Abraham; upon both of them be peace. The Arabs of the Yemen, the Himyar, are well known to have been fromWzn, whose name was Muhzam, as Ibn M~kiilPsaid. It has been stated thatthey were a group of four brothers; Q&t2n, @hit, M u q ~ fa,nd Fdigh. Q&@nwas the son ofHnd; it is also said that he was Had, or that Had was his brother orone of his offspring. C@hmis also said to have descended from Ishmael, as IbnIsh&qand others relate it. One authority stated that Qaf?Tznwas the son ofal-Hamaysac, son of Tayman, son of Qaydhar, son of Nabt, son of Ishmael. Andthere are other genealogies tracing h i back to Ishmael; but God knows best.Al-Bukhm treats this in his chapter on tracing the ancestry of Yemen back toIshmael. He states that Musaddad related to hi,quoting Y&y%i, from Yazid b.Abi 'Ubayd, and also Salama - God be pleased with him - as follows, \\\"TheMessenger of God (SAAS) went out and confronted a group from Aslam whowere fighting one another with swords. He said to one of the two sides, 'Combat,O sons of Ishmael, I am with the swand-so tribe.' So they stopped fighting.'What's wrong with you?' he asked. 'But how can we combat if you are with theso-and-so tribe?' they replied. 'Go on, combat,' he insisted, 'I'm with all of you.\\\"' Al-Bukhzri alone gives this tradition. In one of his versions the tradition goes,\\\"Combat, O sons of Ishmael. Your forebear was a skilled marksman. Combat;I'm with Ibn al-Adrac.\\\" And when they stopped fighting, he said, \\\"Go on, com-bat. I'm with all of you.\\\" Al-Bukhm states, \\\"And Aslam b. Afvz b. H&tha b. 'Amr b. 'Arnir is fromthe tribe of Khuz%'a.\\\"He means the following: that Khu%%Lwaas one group ofthose who were split off from the tribes of Saba' when God sent on them theflood of al-'Aram, as will be explained later. And the Aws and the Khazraj tribes 1. el-Khabi is an epithet of Abraham, which literally means in Arabic \\\"the m e friend\\\" or\\\"companion\\\".Here this honorihc cannotes \\\"the true follower of God\\\".\n\nP:27\n\n2 THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMADwere from Saba' also. The Prophet (SAAS) had said to them, \\\"Combat, O sonsof Ishmael.\\\" By so saying he was pointing out that they were from Ishmael's lineof ancestry. Others interpret his words as meaning the entire Arab race, thoughthat interpretation is far-fetched, since it contradicts without proof the apparentmeaning. But the overwhelming view is that the Qahtnni Arabs, whether theywere from Yemen or somewhere else, were not from the line of Ishmael. Most consider that all the Arabs are divided into two strains, those of Q&@nand those of 'Adnan. Those of Qahpn consist of two peoples: Saba' andHa&amawt. Those of 'A&% are also from two peoples: Rabi'a and Mudar, thetwo sons of Nu= b. Ma'ad b. 'Adn%. A fifth people, the Qudn'a, are the objectof dispute. One theory asserts that they are from 'Adnan; Ibn 'Abd al-Barrreports that the majority so believes. This theory is related from Ibn 'Abhas, IbnWmar, and Jubayr b. Murim. It is also preferred by al-Zubayr b. Bakkar, hisuncle Mus'ab al-Zuhayri, and Ibn H i s h m . According to Ibn 'Abd al-Barrand others, the name \\\"Qudaca son of Macad\\\" appeared in a hadith but this isincorrect. In addition it is said that Qudnca continued to trace the ancestry back to'Adnm, both before and after the coming of Islam. But by the time of K h g ~ bd.Yazid b. Mu%wiya, some of them being maternal uncles of his, they were trac-ing back to Q a h p . In that regard A'sha b. Tha'laba composed the followingverses: \\\"Inform @dab in the letter that but for the vicars of God's people, they would not have been embraced (into Islam). Qudx'a has said, 'We are among the fortuneblessed.\\\" And only God knows if they have been honest and spoken true. They claimed a father who never bad their mother; They may know, but they are fearful (to tell the truth).\\\" Abn 'Amr al-Suhayli has also mentioned unique Arab poetry whichreproaches Quda'a for attributing their descent to Yemen. But God knows best. T h e second theory is that Qudl'a has descended from Qahtm; Ibn I s h ~ q ,al-Kalhi, and a number of other genealogists subscribe to this view. Ibn Ishnq gave his genealogy as being Qu$a'a h. Malik, b. Himyar, b. Saba', b.Yashjub, b. Ya'rub, b. Qahtan. A certain poet of theirs, CAmr h. Murra, a Companion of the Prophet towhom two hadiths are attributed, composed the verses: \\\"0caller, summon us and rejoice; Be of Qudnk, stand not aloof in shame. We descend from the noble and handsome 2. A play on Yemen, pronounced ' ' y a m \\\" in Arabic, a word meaning \\\"success\\\", \\\"happiness\\\",\\\"luck\\\".\n\nP:28\n\nIMAM ABU AL-FIDA' I S M A ~ LIBN K A T H ~ R 3 Qudak, son of Mdik, son of Himyar. The line is well-known and fault-free, Engraved in the stone beneath the pulpit.\\\" One genealogist gave the line as follows: Qudacab. Mdik, b. CAmr, b. Murra,b. Zayd, b. Himyar. Ibn Lahi'a stated, on the authority of Macriif b. Suwayd from Abii VshabaMuhammad b. Masa, from Wqba b. 'Amir, that the last-mentioned said, \\\"Iasked the Messenger of God (SAAS) whether we were descended from Ma'ad.He replied that we were not. So I asked who we were. He replied, 'You aredescended from Quda'a b. Maik b. Himyar.\\\"' Abii Wmar b. 'Abd al-Barr said the following: \\\"People do not dispute thatJuhayna b. Zayd b. Aswad b. Aslam b. 'Imriin b. al-H%fb. Qudacais the tribe ofWqba b. 'Amir al-Juhani. Accordingly, Quda'a would be in Yemen in the tribeof Himyar b. Saba'.\\\" Some genealogists combine these ancestries, as in the report of al-Zubayr b.Bakkar and others to the effect that Quda'a was a woman of the Jurhum who wasmarried to Mdik b. Himyar, from whom she gave birth to Quda'a. Then, shemarried Ma'ad b. 'Adna, while her son was still small; some even claim that shewas pregnant with Quda'a prior to her marriage (to Ma'ad). Thus, Qnda'a wasascribed descent from his mother's husband, as was frequently the custom insuch cases. But God knows best. Muhammad b. S a l l w of Basra, the skilled genealogist, said, \\\"The Arabscame from three strains: âAdrian, Qahpn, and Quda'a.\\\" When he was asked whowere the more numerous, the descendants of 'Adna or those of Qahtan, hereplied, L'Itdepends on Quda'a; if they related to Yemen, then Qahpns are morenumerous; if to Aden, then CAdnas are more.\\\" All this points to Quda'a's inconsistencyin relating their descent. However, ifthe aforementioned hadith from Ibn Lahi'a is true, then it proves their beingfrom Qahtan. But God knows best. And God Almighty did state: \\\"0 people, wehave created you from a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes,that you may know one another. Truly, in God's sight it is the most pious of youwho are the most noble\\\" (siirat al-HujurZt, XLIX, v.13). Genealogists indicate that their taxonomy has the following order: shuciib(peoples); qab2il (tribes); 'amsir (tribal confederations); bu~iin(sub-tribes);aflh~dh(small divisions of a tribe); fa@'il (extended kinsfolk); and cashz'ir(extended families). And the last refers to those closest to a man, and there areno more terms thereafter. Let us begin with mention of the Q a h m , then the Arabs of the H i j a who arethe 'Adna, and discussion of thej~hiliyyaera (before Islam, that is) as a way ofleading up to the biography of the Messenger of God (SAAS). All this if it bethe will of God. in whom there is trust.\n\nP:29\n\n4 THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD Al-Bukh~ristated, in his chapter, An Account of Qah.tzn, as follows: \\\"'Abdd-'Aziz b. 'Abd A I M told us, quoting Sulaymm b. Bild, from Thawr b. Zayd,from Abii d-Ghayth, from Abii Hurayra, that the Prophet (SAAS) said,'Judgement Day wiU not come until a man from the Qahtm goes forth drivingthe people before him with his stick.' Muslim also relates it in that way, fromQutayba, from al-Darawardi, from Thawr h. Zayd.\\\" Al-Suhayli said that Qahtm was the first to whom were spoken the phrasesabayta al-la'na3 (i.e. \\\"you have scorned the malediction\\\") and an'rm ~abzhan(i.e.\\\"have a happy morning!\\\"). The Imam Ahmad said, \\\"Abii d-Mughira related to us, from Jarrr, andRashid b. Sa'd al-Muqra'i told me, from Abii Hayy, from Dhii Fajar, that theMessenger of God (SAAS) said, 'This status once belonged to Himyar, but Godwithdrew it from them and placed it with @raysh and maw, sm, yz, 'ayn, maw,dal, altf hamza, lam, yz, hh4 mim.\\\"' 'Abd Allah said, \\\"This was in a document ofmy father, and as he related it to us he spoke it out directly as meaning thewords, ma saya'ESdu rlayhim, meaning 'it will return to them.\\\"'The Story of Saba'.God Almighty said, \\\"For Saba' there was indeed a sign in their dwelling-place:two gardens, on the right hand and on the left. 'Eat of the bounty from yourLord, and render Him thanks.' Good was the country, and forgiving the Lord.But they turned away, so We sent down upon them the torrent of alLCArim,andchanged their gardens into ones of bitter fruit, tamarisks, and a few lote trees.Thus We punished them for their disbelief, and is it not the disbelievers alonewhom We punish? And We placed between them and the villages We hadblessed other settlements, easily seen, well spaced for journeying, (saying)'Travel in them in safety by day and night.' They responded, '0 God, extendthe distances between our travel stops.' They harmed themselves, and We madeof them tales to be told and scattered them asunder. In that there are signs for allwho are t d y patient and thankful\\\" (arat Saba', XXXIV, v.15-19). The genealogists, including Muhammad b. Is@q, give the name as Saba' 'AbdShams h. Yashjub h. Ya'ruh b. Q*m; they say that he was the first of the Arabswho sabd4and that that was why he was called Saba'. He was also called al-R2rsh(\\\"the philanthropist\\\"), because he gave to the people from his own wealth. 3. A salutationmade to kings in the pre-Islamic era, meaning \\\"your deeds are too impeccable todeserve malediction, O king.\\\" 4. The word lends itself to various interpretations.Thus A. Guillaume, in his translation of IbnIshaq's The Llfe of Muhammad (Oxford, 1955, p4) renders it \\\"to take captives\\\". Dictionaries giveother meanings that might also fit this context. For example, in E. W. Lane's Ara&c-EnglishLexicon we find saba'as \\\"to renege on an oath\\\" or ''to imply God's abandonment of a person\\\".\n\nP:30\n\nIMAM ABU AL-FIDA' ISMATL IBN KATHTR 5 Al-Suhayli said, \\\"It is related that he was the first person to he crowned.\\\"Some stated that he was a Muslim and that he wrote verses predicting theadvent of the Messenger of God (SAAS). In that poetry are the lines: \\\"He will control after us a mighty domain, A prophet who will give not licence to evil. After him, other kings from among them will hold sway Ruling all men, with no dishonour nor disgrace. After them, rulers of ours will control And our kingdom will be fragmented. After Qhtan a prophet will rule, Pious, humble, the very best of mankind. He will be named Alpnad, and I wish I could be given to live a year after his coming To support him and award him my aid With all fully-armed warriors and all marksmen. When be appears, become his helpers and let Him who meets him pass on my greeting.\\\" Ibn Dihya related this in his book al-Tanwir fiMawlid al-Bashir al-Nadhir(Illnminating the Birth of the Messenger, the Herald). Imam Ahmad stated that Aha 'Ahd a l - W m % nrelated to him, quoting 'AhdAll* h. Lahi'a, on the authority of 'Abd Allah h. Huhayra al-Saha'i, from 'Ahdal-Rahman b. Wa'la, that the last-named said that he heard 'Ahd Allah b.'Ahhas say that a man once asked the Prophet (SAAS) who or what Saha'might signify, whether a man, a woman, or a territory. He replied, \\\"Certainlyhe was a man who gave birth to ten children. Six of them dwelled in Yemenand four in Syria. Those in Yemen were Madhhij, Kiuda, al-Azd, the Ash'aris,Anmar, and Himyar, all Arahs; in Syria they were Lakhm, Judham, 'Amila, andGhassan.\\\" We related in our TafSr (Exegesis) that it was Farwa h. Musayk al-Ghutayfiwho asked about that; also therein we anaiysed the limes of transmission and thephraseology of this tradition. And all praise he to God! What is meant here is that Saha' encompasses all these tribes. Among themthere used to he [kings] in the lands of Yemen called the tabZbibi'a; tubba'in the sin-gular. Their kings would wear crowns during their reign, as also did the Chosroes,the kings of the Persians. The Arahs ,used to apply the word tubba' to each kingwho rules Yemen, along with al-Shahr and Hadramam, just as they applied qay~arto kings rulimg Syria and the peninsula, kisrz to those ruling Persia, fafin toEgypt's rulers, al-naj~shito those over Abyssinia, and batlaymz% to India's kings.Balqiss was one of the Himyarite rulers of Yemen. They used to he in a state ofgreat felicity, with abundant prosperity and a plenitude of local fruits and p r e 5. Balqis is identified as the Qeen of Sheba who married King Solomon\n\nP:31\n\n6 THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMADduce. However, they lived in rectitude, propriety, and right guidance. But whenthey replaced God's blessings by disbelief, these kings brought their people to ruin. Muhammad b. Ishaq stated from Wahb b. Munabbih, \\\"God sent to them 13prophets.\\\" And al-Suddi claimed that he sent 12,000 prophets to them! But Godknows best. What is implied here is that they deviated from the true guidance into errorand bowed down to the sun apart from God. That was so in the time of Balqisand beforehand as well, continuing up to when God sent the flood of al-CArimupon them. As the Almighty said, \\\"But they turned away, so We sent down uponthem the torrent of al-'Arim, and changed their gardens into ones of bitter fruit,tamarisks, and a few lote trees. Thus We punished them for their disbelief, and isit not the disbelievers alone whom We punish?\\\" (swat Saba', XXXIV, v.16-17). A number of former and contemporary scholars on the Qur'w commentariesand others have related that the Ma'rib dam was constructed where waters flowedbetween two mountains; in ancient times they built an extremely strong dam thereso that the water-level reached these mountain tops. On those mountains theyplanted many fields and orchards with elegant and highly productive trees. It is saidthat Saba' b. Yacribbuilt it and that it was fed by 70 valleys with 30 outlets forthe water from it. But he died before it was completed and so Hmyar finished itafter him. It was onefumkh6 long and onefarsakh wide. People lived there in greatfelicity, prosperity, and ease. So much so, that Q a ~ d and others related that theorchards gave fruit of such quantity and ripeness that a woman could fill a largebasket on her head from the fruit dropping in it as she passed below. It is said thatthere were no fleas or dangerousbeasts there; the climate being wholesome and theland excellent, as the Almighty stated, \\\"For Saba' there was indeed a sign in theirdwellmg-place; two gardens, one on the right hand and one on the left. 'Eat fromthe bounty of your Lord, and render Him thanks -a fair land and a much-forgivingLord\\\"' (srirat Saba', XXXIV, v.15). And He also stated, \\\"And so your Lordproclaimed: 'If you give thanks, I give you increase thereof; but if you show ingratkhlde, then is my punishment severe indeed'\\\" (-rat Ibrzhim, X N , v.7). Then they worshipped other than God and were discontent with His bounty;after He had made their travel stages close together, made good their orchards,and secured their roads, they asked Him to extend their travel stages, to maketheir journeys difficult and tiresome, and to replace good by evil. They did justlike the Israelites when they requested that He exchange manna and quails forvegetables, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions. And so they nullified thatgreat blessing and common good by despoiling the land and scattering the people,then, as the Almighty said, \\\"they turned away and so We sent down upon themthe torrent of al-'Arim\\\" (srirat Saba', XXXIV, v.16). 6. Parasang, an ancient Persian measure of length, equal to about 34 miles.\n\nP:32\n\nIMAM ABO A L F I D K ' ISMA?L IBN K A T H ~ R 7 More than one source related that God dispatched rodents against the baseof the dam, that is, large rats, or, it is said, moles; and when people knew ofthis, they set up nets. But, it having been so decreed, these efforts did no goodand their precautions were useless. When the destruction at the base was welladvanced, the dam fell and collapsed and the water flowed out. Thus thestreams and rivers were cut 0% all those fruits were lost and all the produceand trees perished. Afterwards they were replaced with inferior trees andfruits, as All-powerful and Almighty God has stated, \\\"and we changed theirgardens into ones of khamf and athl (bitter fruit and tamarisks)\\\" (siirat Saba',XXXIV, v. 16). Ihn 'Abbs, Mujhid, and others stated that khnmt is the arak tree which givesa fruit known as the barir, whereas the athl is the ~arf~'t,he tamarisk, or somesuch similar tree that produces wood without fruit. The Qur'm verse continues,\\\"and a few lote-trees\\\". This refers to the fact that when the nabaq, the \\\"Christ'sthorn\\\" tree, gives fruit it does so in very small quantity despite the profusenessof its thorns. The proportion of its fruit is similar, then, to what the proverbimplies, \\\"like the meat of a scrawny camel high on a rock-strewn mountain\\\", notan easy path to be climbed, nor a nice fat meal to be attained. This, then, is whythe Almighty states, \\\"Thus We punished them for their disbelief, and is it notthe disbelievers alone whom We punish?\\\" That is, He only metes out such severe punishment to those who disbelievein Him, give the lie to His messengers, disobey His commands, and defile Hissanctuaries. The Ahnighty also said, \\\"We made of them tales to be told and scatteredthem asunder.\\\" In fact, when their wealth was gone and their lands were in ruin,they were forced to depart. So they scattered into the lower areas and into thehigher reaches of the country, in all directions, aydi Saba' (in disarray that is) asthe common idiom goes. Some of them settled in Hi;%, the KhnzVa tribeamong them; they migrated to the suburbs of Mecca, with the consequences thatwe will relate later. Others went to what is now Medina, being the first to settlethere. They were later joined by three tribes of Jews: Banti Qaynuqxc, BantiQuray~a,and Banti al-Nadir. These made a pact with the tribes of Aws andKhazraj and stayed with them, as we will relate. Other groups from Saba' movedto Syria and it was later they who became Christian; these were the Ghassxn,'Amila, Bahrx', Lakhm, J u d h a , Tanakh, Taghlib, and others. Muhammad b. Ishiiq stated that Abn 'Ubayda told him that al-A'sha b. Qaysb. Tha'laba, also known as Mayman b. Qays, spoke the verses: \\\"In that there is a moral for those who seek morals, Ma'rib was wiped out by the torrent of al-'Arim, Marble, built for them by Himyar, Which did not budge when the raging billows came.\n\nP:33\n\n8 THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD Its water irrigated the crops and the vines Far and wide, since it was decreed Then they were scattered and could not Give drink toe child when just weaned.\\\" Muhammad b. IshZq, in his biography of the Prophet (SAAS), indicated thatthe first man to leave Yemen before the flooding of al-'Arim was 'Amr b. 'Amirof the Lakhm tribe. Lakhm was the son of 'Adi b. al-I;IZrith b. Murra b. Udad b.Zayd b. Hamaysac b. 'Am h. 'Arib b. Yashjub b. Zayd b. Kahlm b. Saba'.Lakhm's genealogy has also been given as Lakhm b. 'Adi b. 'Amr b. Saha', asIbn Hishan states. According to Ibn IshZq, \\\"The reason for his departure from Yemen was, asAba Zayd al-ansiiri related to me, that he saw rodents burrowing into theMa'rib dam which held back the water which they distributed over their landas they pleased. He realized that the dam would not last, and so he decided toemigrate from Yemen. So he tricked his people, as follows. He ordered hisyoungest son to stand up to him and strike him back if he should berate andstrike hi.His son did as he was told and 'Amr then said, 'I will not remain in aland where my youngest son has slapped my face.' So some of Yemen's triballeaders said, 'Let's take advantage of 'Am's anger and buy up his properties.'Then 'Amr moved with his sons and grandsons. The Azd tribe then stated thatthey would not remain behind after 'Amr; so they sold their properties and leftwith him. They journeyed until they reached the land of 'Akk, crossing to andfro across their territory. So 'Akk attacked them, their battles favouring firstone side, then the other. On this fighting, 'Abbs b. Mirdas spoke the followingverses: 'And 'Akk b. 'Adnm were those who toyed with Ghassan until they were completely expelled.' \\\" 'Amr's people therefore disengaged from them and dispersed in differentdirections. The family of Jafna h. 'Am b. 'Amir went to Syria, while the Awsand the Khazraj settled in Yathrib and Khuza'a went to Marra7 The Azdal-SarZt went to al-SarZt, the Azd W m m to W m n . Then God dispatched thetorrent down upon the dam and destroyed it, concerning which event Godrevealed these verses in the Qur'm.\\\" Something close to this account was alsorelated from al-Saddi. According to Muhammad b. Ishsq in this account, 'Amr b. 'Amir was asoothsayer. Others say that his wife, Tarifa daughter of al-Khayr, the Himyaritewoman, was a soothsayer and that she told him of the imminent doom of theircountry. Apparently they saw proof of that in the rats being given control overtheir dam, and that was why they acted as they did. God alone knows best. 7. Known as marr a/-Zahr~in,on the road to Mecca.\n\nP:34\n\nIMAM ABU AL-FIDA' ISMA'IL IBN K A T H ~ R 9 I have given a lengthy account of CAmr's story, from 'Ikrima, as related by IbnAbi Hatim, in my Tafsir (Exegesis).Not all of Saba' left Yemen when they were aftlicted with the torrent of al-'Arm;the majority of them remained. The people of Ma'rib, who had the dam, movedinto different parts of the country. That is the gist of the previously mentionedhadith coming down from Ibn 'Abbas to the effect that all the mbes of Saba' didnot leave Yemen, but four went to Syria while six remained. These wereMadhhij, Kinda, Anmar, and the Ash'aris. Anmzr was the father of Khath'am,Bajila, and Himyar; so these were the six tribes from Saba' who remained inYemen. They continued retaining the rights of power and the tababzcakingshipuntil the king of Abyssinia took that position from them through the army he sentunder his two generals Abraha and AryXt. The Abyssinian rule lasted some 70years until Sayf b. Dhn Yazan the Himyarite regained control, and that was ashort time before the birth of the Messenger of God (SAAS). This we willrecount in detail shortly, God willing, and upon Him is d l trust and dependence. Later the Messenger of God (SAAS) sent 'Ali and KhSlid b. al-Walid to thepeople of Yemen, then he sent Abii Miisa al-Ash% and Mu%dhb. Jabal. Theywere calling people to worship God and making clear to them matters ofdoctrine. After that al-Aswad alLcAnsi gained control over Yemen and heexpelled the deputies of the Messenger of God (SAAS). When al-Aswad waskilled, the power of Islam became firmly established over Yemen, during therule of Abii Bakr \\\"the trusting\\\", God be pleased with him.The Story of Rabicab. Nasr b. Aba USritha b. 'Amr b. 'ilmir.The man referred to in the above heading was of the Lakhm tribe; this is whatIbn Ishaq related. Al-Suhayli stated that the genealogists of Yemen give hisname as Nasr b. Rabi'a; but he was really Rabi'a b. Nasr b. al-H*th b. Namarab. Lakhm. Al-Zubayr b. Bakkitr gave his genealogy as Rabi'a b. Nasr b. Malik b.Sha'wadh b. Malik b. [Ajam b. 'Amr b. Namzra b. Lakhm. Lakhm was thebrother of Judhitm; he was named Lakhm because he had lakhrned his brotheron the cheek, i.e. he had struck him there. The brother bit his hand in return sojadhaming it; hence he was called J u d h a . Rabi'a was one of the tubbackingsof Himyar, and about him is told the tale ofhis contacts with the two soothsayers Shiqq and Saph, and how they warnedhim of the coming of the Messenger of God (SAAS). Saph was named Rabi' b. Rabib b. Masciid b. M e i n b. Dhi'b b. 'Ad! b.M e i n Ghassa. Shiqq was the son of Sa0 b. Yashkur b. Ruhm b. Afrak b. Qays b.\n\nP:35\n\n10 THE LlFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD'Abqar b. Anmar b. Nizz. Some say that Anmar was the son of Irash b. Lihymb. 'Amr b. al-Chawth b. Nzbit b. Mdik b. Zayd b. Kahlm b. Saba'. It is saidthat Saph had no limbs but was like a waterskin, with his face in his chest. Whenhe got angry he would puff up and sit. Shiqq was one-half a man. And it is saidthat Khalid b. (Abd Allah al-Qasri was of his progeny. According to al-Snhayliboth Shiqq and Saph were born on the same day when Tarifa, daughter ofal-Khayr, the Himyarite woman, died. It is said that she spat into the mouth ofeach of them, each therefore inheriting the gift of divination from her. She wasthe wife of CAmr b. 'Amir, previously mentioned. But Cod knows best.Muhammad Ihn Ishaq said that Rabi'a b. N q r was king of Yemen and of thetrue line of the tubbaCkings. He saw a vision that awed and terrified h i . So hegathered every single soothsayer, magician, b i d prognosticator, and star foretellerin his kingdom and told them, \\\"I have seen visions that amazed and scared me.Tell me what they were and how to interpret them.\\\" They replied, \\\"Relate themto us and we will interpret them.\\\" He responded, \\\"If I do tell you what they wereI won't feel secure with your explanation; the only one capable of interpretingthem will be someone who knows what they were before I tell them.\\\" One of the wise men then suggested, \\\"If that is what the king wants, then heshould send for Shiqq and Satih. No one is more knowledgeable than they; theywill tell him what he asked for.\\\" So the king sent for them, and Satih arrived before Shiqq. Their conversationwent as follows: The king: \\\"I have seen visions that amazed and scared me; teU me what theywere, and if you are right you will interpret them correctly.\\\" Saph: \\\"I will do so. You saw fire emerge from the darkness, fall on lowground, and consume every living being with a skull.\\\" The king: \\\"You've not made a single error, Sacih. So how do yon interpretthem?\\\" Satih: \\\"I swear by all the snakes between the two stony plains, that theAbyssinians will descend upon your land and will surely reign over all betweenAbyan and Jurash.\\\" The king: \\\"That, Saph, angers and hurts me greatly; will that occur in mytime or later?\\\" Saph: \\\"Later, by your father I swear, some time later, after more than 60 or70 years have passed.\\\" The king: \\\"And will their dominion endure or be cut short?\\\" Satih: \\\"It will be cut down to some 70 years, and then they will be killed andexpelled in flight.\\\" The king: \\\"Who will then follow, after their killing and expulsion?\\\" Satih: \\\"Iram Dhn Yazan will follow, emerging from Aden to fight them, andhe will not leave one of them in Yemen.\\\"\n\nP:36\n\nIMAM ABB AL-FIDA' ISMA'iL IBN KATH~R The king: \\\"And will his era endure or be cut short?\\\" Satih: \\\"It will be cut short.\\\" T h e king: \\\"Who will do this?\\\" Satih: \\\"A prophet, pure, to whom revelation comes from the All-high.\\\" T h e king: \\\"And from where will this prophet come?\\\" Satih: \\\"He will descend from Ghdib h. Fihr b. M3ik b. al-Nadr. And therule will be with his people till the end of time.\\\" T h e king: \\\"Does time end?\\\" Safih: \\\"Yes, on that day when the first and the last shall all be assembled andthe good will be happy, the evil mortified.\\\" T h e king: \\\"Is this really true, what you're telling me?\\\" Satih: \\\"Yes, by the twilight, the dark of night, and the spreading dawn, what Itold you really is the truth.\\\" Then Shiqq arrived and the king spoke to him as he had to Satih but hid fromhim what he had foreseen to establish whether they would be in agreement ornot. Shiqq told him, \\\"You saw fire emerge from the dark, fall down between ameadow and a hillock, and eat up every breathing creature there.\\\" When Shiqq said this, the king knew that they were in agreement and sayingone and the same thing, except for Satiws words being \\\"fall on low ground andconsume every living being with a skull\\\", while Shiqq's were \\\"between ameadow and a hillock and eat up every breathing creature there\\\". So the kingtold him he had it right and asked his interpretation. Shiqq: \\\"I swear by all the men who live between two stony plains that theblacks will descend upon your land, oppress all your young, and reign over allbetween Ahyan and Najran.\\\" The king: \\\"By your father, Shiqq, that angers and hurts me greatly; will thatoccur during or after my reign?\\\" Shiqq: \\\"No, it will he in a later period. And then a great man will emerge tosave your people and inflict on your enemies all disgrace.\\\" The king: \\\"And who will this great saviour he?\\\" Shiqq: \\\"A young man who is guilt-free and faultless and will emerge from theline of Dhn Yazan.\\\" T h e king: \\\"And will his reign last long?\\\" Shiqq: \\\"No, it will be brought short by a messenger dispatched, who willbring truth and justice, and come from a people of religion and virtue in whompower shall reside until the Day of Separation.\\\" The king: \\\"What is the Day of Separation?\\\" Shiqq: \\\"A day when the pious shall be rewarded, when calls shall he madefrom the heavens that the living and the dead shall hear, and men shall begathered to the appointed place. Then the pious shall receive victory andrewards.\\\"\n\nP:37\n\n12 THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD The king: \\\"Is it really true what you predict?\\\" Shiqq: \\\"Yes, by the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all high and lowbetween them both, what I have informed you is all true and doubt-free.\\\" Ibn I s h ~ qstated that the soothsayers' prediction had great impact on Rabi'a b.N q r and so he provisioned all his family and relatives for departure to Iraq. Hewrote for them to a Persian king called Sabiir b. Khurzadh who settled them ind-Hira. According to Ibn Ishaq, the progeny of Rabi'a b. N a ~ rincludedd-Nu'mzn b. al-Mundhir, son of a l - N u k a b. al-Mundhii b. 'Amr b. 'Adi b.Rabi'a b. Nasr. This al-Nu'miin was viceroy over al-Hira for the Persian kings;and the Arabs used to send delegations to him and gave him praise. This, then,is what Muhammad b. Ishaq said about al-Nu'ma b. al-Mundhir being of theline of Rabi'a b. Na~ra, ccording to most people. Ibn Ishaq related that when thesword of al-Nucm%nb. al-Mundhir was brought to the Commander of theFaithful, 'Umar b. al-Khatpb, he asked Jubayr b. M u ~ mfrom whom it hadcome. He replied, \\\"From the remains of Q a n b~. Ma'ad b. âAdrian.\\\" Ibn I s h qcommented that it was unclear who that person was.The Story of TnbbacAbii Karib Tubb~inAs'ad, king of Yemen, with thepeople of Medina; how he wished to raid the Holy Sanctuary a t Mecca.Then he dignified and venerated it and covered it with cloth; thus hewas the first to do so.Ibn Ishaq stated that when Rabi'a b. N q r died all kingship in Yemen reverted toHassan b. Tubban As'ad Abii Karib. Tubbzn As'ad was the last tubba'; he wasthe son of Kulki Karib b. Zayd.

According to Ibn Ishaq, Tubbzn As'ad Abii Karib was he who went toMedina and led two Jewish rabbis to Yemen and refurbished and covered withcloth the holy sanctuary. His reign preceded that of Rabi'a b. Navr. He hadrouted his return journey from a campaign in the east through Medina. First hehad passed there without bothering its inhabitants and left among them a son ofhis who was treacherously killed. He advanced against it, determined to destroyit, wipe out its people, and cut down its date-palms. So this clan of the an& 8. The Medinan followers of the Prophet Muhammad who gclnted him refuge after his emi-gration from Mecca.\n\nP:38\n\nIMAM ABU AL-FIDA' I S M A ~ LIBN KATHiR 13joined up against him, their leader being 'Amr h. Talla, the brother of Bantid-Najjzr and also one of Bana 'Amr b. Mabdhiil. Mabdhal's name was 'Amir b.Malik b. d-Najj*, and d-Najjsr's name was Taym All& b. Tha'laba b. 'Amr b.d-Khazraj b. Hnrith b. Tha'laba b. 'Amr h. 'Amir. Ibn H i s h a stated that 'Amr b. Talla was 'Amr b. Muswiya b. 'Amr b. 'Amirb. Maik b. al-Najjzr, that Talla was his mother and that she was the daughter of'Amir b. Zurayq al-Khazrajiyya. Ibn Ishaq's account proceeds: \\\"A certain man of Bana 'Adi b. al-Najjar, calledA h a r , attacked and killed one of the followers of Tuhhacwhom he found cuttingdown date clusters off one of his date-loaded palm nees, saying, 'Dates belongonly to those who pollinate them.' This added to Tubbac's animosity towardsthem and fighting broke out. \\\"The a q a r claimed that they would fight against him by day and host him bynight; their saying this surprised Tuhhacwho would say, 'Our people, by God,are certainly generous!\\\"' Ibn Ishaq related about the ansar that Tubbac's anger was directed onlyagainst the Jews and that they, the ansar, protected them from him. N-Snhaylistated that Tuhbac only came to give victory to the aqar, his cousins, against theJews who had taken up residence with them in Medina on certain conditionsthat they had not kept, and because they were behaving arrogantly. Godknows best. Ibn Ishaq's account relates that while Tuhba' was engaged in this fightingagainst them, two Jewish rabbis came to him; they were both deeply learned menfrom Bana Qurayp. When they heard how he intended to destroy the city andits inhabitants, they told him, \\\"0king, do not do this. Unless you adopt a differentcourse from that you intend, you will be prevented from accomplishingit, andwe will not be able to save you from swift retribution.\\\" Tubbacasked why thiswas so, and they replied, \\\"This is where a prophet will migrate; he will go forthfrom this holy sanctuary from Quraysh in times to come and this shall be hishome and his abode.\\\" So Tuhba' changed his plan; he recognized the learning they had and wasintrigued by what he had heard from them. He therefore departed from Medinaand adopted the rabbis' religion. According to Ibn Ishaq, Tuhba' and his peoplehad idols whom they worshipped. Tubba' then set off towards Mecca on his way to Yemen. When he arrivedbetween Wsfm and Amaj he was approached by some men of the tribe ofHudhayl b. Mudrika b. Ilyas b. Mudar b. Nizzr b. Ma'ad b. 'Adnm. They askedhim, \\\"0king, may we lead you to an ancient treasury overlooked by kings beforeyourself, in which there are pearls, chrysolite, sapphires, gold, and silver?\\\"Lâ Certainly yon may,\\\" he replied. They said, \\\"It is a building in Mecca whosepeople worship it and offer prayers there.\\\"\n\nP:39\n\n14 THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD Actually the Hudhaylis sought to destroy him by this, since they knew thatany king wanting this or being disrespectful there would perish. After agreeing to their suggestion Tuhbacsent word to the two rabbis askingtheir advice. They replied, \\\"Those people wished only your death and thedestruction of your army. We know of no other building than that in the landthat God Almighty and Glorious has taken for Himself. If you do as they suggest,you will perish, as will all those with you.\\\" Tubha' asked what he should do when he approached the building and theysaid he should do the same as those who lived there, that he should circumam-bulate it and venerate and honour it, shaving his head and acting with humilitybefore it until he left it. The king then asked, \\\"What is it that prevents you both from doing thesame?\\\" They replied, \\\"It certainly is the house of our father Abraham, on whomhe peace, and it is as we told you, but the people there have created a barrierbetween us and it by the idols they have set up about it and the hlood they shedthere. They are unclean and polytheists.\\\" This was the gist of their words. Tubhac saw the good of their advice and the truth of their words and so hesummoned the men from Hudhayl, cut off their hands and feet, and continuedto Mecca. There he performed the circumamhulation of the build'ig, madesacrifice, and shaved his head. He remained in Mecca for six days, so they say,providing sacrificial feasts for its people and giving them honey to drink. In adream he was shown that he should cover the building, so he clothed it withpalm fronds. Then, in another dream, he was shown that he should clothe it insomething better, so he dressed it with a Yemeni tribal fabric. Again he had avision that he should clothe it even better, so he covered it with fine sheets andstriped cloth. People claim that Tubbacwas thus the first to clothe the building.He ordered its guardians from the Jurhum tribe to clean it thoroughly and toprevent any blood, dead bodies, or menstruating women from coming close to it.H e also made for it a door and a key. On this subject Suhay'a, daughter of al-Ahabh, spoke the following verses forher son Khzlid h. 'Abd Manaf b. Ka'b b. Sa'd b. Taym b. Murra b. Ka'b b.Lu'ayy b. Ghdib, telling him to avoid sinning in Mecca and reminding himwhat Tuhhachad done there: \\\"0my son, in Mecca neither do wrong to the young nor to the old. Preserve its sanctity, my son, and let not conceit confuse you. Whoever sins in Mecca, my son, meets erueme disaster. His face, my son, shall be beaten, his cheeks consumed by fire. I have tested this there, my son, and found those harming it perish. God made it secure, though no towers are built in its courtyards. God made its birds inviolateand also the white-footed crows on Mt. Thabir. Tubba' raided it, hut dressed its buildings with new, smwth cloth.\n\nP:40\n\nIMAM ABIS AL-EIDA' ISMA'iL IBN KATHIRMy God humbled his power there, so he made proper sacrifice,Walking barefoot towards it, in its courtyard,And offering two thousand camels,Well-feeding its people the fleshof Mahry camels and cattle,Giving them strained honey and barley-water to drink.And God destroyed the army of the elephants, casting rocks amongst them,Ending their rule in far distant lands, in Persia and Khazir.So hear when this is told, and understand how thmgs ended.\\\"Ibn Ishaq continued: \\\"Thereafter Tubba' left for Yemen, taking his armedmen and the two rabbis with him. On his arrival he asked his people to adopt thereligion he had embraced, but they refused until it should be put to the test offire as was the custom in Yemen.\\\"He went on: \\\"I was told by Aba Malik b. Tha'laba b. Aba Malik al-Qurazithat he heard Ibrahim b. Muhammad b. Talha b. 'Ubayd All& say that whenTubba' reached the outskirts of Yemen, Himyar intercepted him and deniedhim entry. They told him, 'You shall not enter our land; you have abandonedour faith.' So Tubba' called on them to embrace his new religion, proclaiming itto be better than theirs. They asked whether he would agree to put the issuebetween them to the test of the fire, and he agreed.\\\"He continued: \\\"There was in Yemen, as Yemenis assert, a fire they wouldemploy to adjudicate differences; it would consume wrongdoers but not harmthe innocent. And so Tubbac's people and the two rabbis walked to the fire site.His people took their idols and carried their sacrificialofferings, while the rabbiswore their sacred books around their necks. They all sat near the spot fromwhich the fire would emerge. When it raged towards them they drew away andavoided it. The onlookers berated them and ordered them to endure it, and theydid so until it enveloped them and consumed their idols and sacred objects andthose men of Himyar who carried them. But the two rabbis emerged safe, withtheir holy books around their necks, unharmed though their foreheads weresweating. Thereupon the Himyarites adopted their religion; and this was howJudaism began in Yemen.\\\"Ibn Ishaq continued to report that one authority told him that the two rabbisand the men of Himyar approached the fire only seeking to force it back, for itwas said that truth lay with him who could do this. The Himyarites approachedthe fire bearing their idols to force it back, but it closed on them seeking toconsume them. So they drew away and were not able to force it back. Later thetwo rabbis approached it and began reciting the Torah. The fire withdrew fromthem and so they forced it back to where it emerged. Thereupon the Himyaritesadopted their religion. But God knows best which report is true.Ibn Ishaq went on: \\\" They had a temple called which they veneratedand where they made sacrifice; there they received oracular messages while\n\nP:41\n\n16 THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMADengaged in their polytheistic practices. The two rabbis told Tubha: 'It is just adevil who is deceiving the people that way; let us deal with him.' Tuhbacagreedand the rabbis, so the Yemenis say, forced out from it a black dog which theykilled. Then they destroyed that temple; and its ruins s o I have been told -stillto this day bear traces of the blood shed on it.\\\" In our new Tafse (Exegesis)of the Qur'm we have told of the tradition comingfrom the Prophet (SAAS) wherein he said, \\\"Do not curse Tubbac; he hadbecome a Muslim.\\\" Al-Suhayli stated that Mu'ammar related from Humiim b. Munabbih fromAbii Hurayra that the Messenger of God (SAAS) said, \\\"Do not curse As'ad theHimyarite; it was he who first clothed the ka'ba.\\\" According to al-Suhayli,Tubbac spoke the following verses when the two rabbis told him about theMessenger of God (SAAS): \\\"I do testify that w d is a messenger from God, guiltless his soul, If only my life were extended up to his, I would have been a helper, a cousin to him, I would have fought his enemies with the sword and cleared all cares from his breast.\\\" These verses continued to he handed down and memorised among the ansar;they were with Abii Ay@b al-anszri, may God be pleased with him and blesshi.Al-Suhayli stated that Ihn Abii d-Duny2 indicated in his Kitzb al-Qubar(Book of Graves) that a grave was dug up at Sans in which two females werefound and along with them a silver tablet on which was written in gold, \\\"This isthe grave of Lamis and Hubba, two daughters of Tubba', who died declaring,'There is no God but God alone and without peer,' and before them the righteoushad died saying the same.\\\"Later, rule passed to Hassm b. Tubb2n Ascad, and he was the brother ofal-Yamiima d-Zarq2' who was crucified on the gate of the city of Jaw, whichfrom that day on was named d-Yamaina. Ibn Ishaq continued that when Tubbac's son Hassgn h. Abi Karih TubbanAs'ad became king, he set out with the people of Yemen, wishing to subdue thelands of the Arabs and the Persians. But by the time they were somewhere inIraq, the Himyarites and the Yemenites disliked going further with him andwanted to return to their own countries and families. So they spoke to a brotherof Hassm named 'Amr, who was there with him in the army, as follows: \\\"Killyour brother Hasssn and we will make you king over us and you can take usback home.\\\" He said he would, and there was agreement about this except inthe case of Dhu Rucayn the Himyarite. He urged 'Amr against this, but 'Amrdisagreed. So Dhu Ru'ayn composed a poem containing the following twoverses:\n\nP:42\n\nIMAM ABU AL-FIDA' I S M A ~ LIBN KATH~R 17 \\\"Whoever would exchange insomnia for sleep?Happy he who sleeps in peace. Though Himyar has betrayed in treachery, Dhii Ru'ayn has God's forgiveness.\\\" This poem he then entrusted to 'Amr. When the latter did kill his brotherHassan and returned to Yemen, he was deprived of sleep and suffered insomnia.When he asked physicians, astrologists, soothsayers, and diviners what waswrong, they told hi,\\\"No one has ever killed his brother or relative unjustlywithout losing his sleep and suffering insomnia.\\\" Thereupon he set about killingall those who had encouraged him to murder his brother. Finally, he came toDhii R u m who told him, \\\"I have cause for you to spare me.\\\" When 'Amrasked why, he drew attention to the document he had entrusted to him. 'Amrthen took out the verses, read them and realized that Dha Ru'ayn had advisedhim well. 'Amr perished and Himyar's state fell into disorder and disarray. USURPATION OF THE THRONE OF YEMEN BY LAKHNT'A DHU SHANATIR.He ruled there for 27 years. Ihn Ishaq continued that a Himyarite not of the royal lines then took controlof Yemen, a man called Lakhni'a Yaniif Dhii Shanatir. He murdered the mostprominent Yemenites and abused the country's royal families. He was, more-over, a most depraved man, behaving as had the people of Lot. He would sendfor a royal prince and attack him in an upper chamber he had constructed forthat purpose; this was to prevent the prince from ruling after hi.Eventually hewould look down from his high chamber to his guards and soldiers below andplace a tooth-cleaning stick in his mouth to show them that he had finished withthe prince. One day he sent for Zur'a Dha Nuw2s b. Tubbiin As'ad, the brother of Hassm,who had been a small boy when Hassm was murdered. He had grown up to be afine, intelligent, and handsome young man. When a messenger came to fetch h ihe realized what was in store for him, so he hid a thin metal blade between his footand sandal. When they were alone and Lakhni'a attacked hi,Dhti Nuw% foughtback and stabbed and killed him. Then he cut off his head and placed it in thewindow out of which Lakhni'a had looked below. Having placed a tooth-cleaningstick in his mouth he then went outside. The guards called to him, \\\"Hey there,Dhii Nuwas, fresh and moist, or all dried out?\\\" He told them in reply to ask thehead of \\\"Hell-bent\\\" there in the window, and they saw that Lakhni'a's head hadbeen cut off. They then caught up with Dhii Nuwas and implored him to betheir king now that he had spared them from the evil tyrant. So they made him King, and Himyar and the tribes of Yemen united underhim. He was the last of the kings of Himyar. He took the name Yiisuf and ruledfor an extended period.\n\nP:43\n\n18 THE LIFE OF THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD In Najran there were still some remnants of followers of the religion of Jesus,son of Mary, on whom be peace. They were people of goodness and virtue andtheir leader's name was 'Ahd Allah b. al-Thanir. Ibn Ishiiq then related how the people of Najr%nadopted Christianity due tothe influence of a man named Faymi*, a Christian from Syria. He was a manwhose prayers were answered and was accompanied by a man named Salii.They spent each Sunday in prayer, while FaymiyCin worked the rest of the weekas a builder. He said prayers for the sick, the crippled, and the disabled, andtheir ills would be cured. Eventually he and his friend were taken prisoner bybedouins and were sold in Najrm. The man who bought Faymiyiin was astonishedto see that when he began his prayers in the house at night it would fill withlight. The people of Najrm worshipped a tall palm tree, bowing down before it andfestooning it with their wives' jewellery. Faymiym said to his master, \\\"If I wereto say a prayer to God against this tree and it were destroyed, would you recog-nize that your religion is false?\\\" His master agreed that he would, and gatheredall the people from N a i r a together. Faymiyiin then went into his prayer-roomand asked God to destroy the tree. So God sent a storm that tore it up by theroots and threw it flat on the ground. Thereupon the people of Najran adoptedChristianity and he encouraged them to follow the Gospel until they were over-taken by the same events that affected the Christians all over the world. That was how Christianity came to Najrzn in the Arab lands. Then Ibn Ishaq related the story of 'Abd All& b. al-Thmir when he adoptedChristianity at the hands of Faymiycin and how Dha Nuw% killed him and hiscompanions and dug the ukhdtid, the trench, for them. According to Ibn Hishiimthat ukhdtid was a long trench in the ground like a ditch. Dha Nuwas kindledfires in it and burned these people with them; he also killed many others, to thetotal of almost 20,000, as is examined at length in the study of stirat a l - B u ~ j(LXXXV) in our Tafsir (Exegesis)of the Qur'm? And all praise be to God! A n Account of how rule in Yemenpassedfrom Himyar and was transferred to the black Abyssinians.The aforementioned events support the predictions of the two soothsayers,Shiqq and Saph. Only one of the people of Najrzn survived; his name was DawsDhii Tha'labm and he escaped on his horse in the desert and could not becaught. He continued travelling until he reached Caesar, the emperor ofByzantium. Since the emperor was also a Christian, as he was, he told h i whatDhii Nuwas and his troops had done and asked his aid. The emperor replied 9. Ibn Kathir, Tafev.. . ,Val. 4, pp491-7.\n\nP:44\n\nIMAM ABU AL-FIDA' ISMA'iL IBN KATH~R 19that Daws' land was very far, but that he would write a message to the king ofAbyssinia who was also of the same religion and whose country was closer athand. The emperor then wrote such a message asking h i to provide help and toseek revenge for Daws. So Daws took Caesar's letter to the Negus10 who dispatched 70,000 troopsfrom Abyssinia under the leadership of one of his officers named Aryst, alongwith another named Abraha al-Ashram. Aryat crossed over the sea and reachedthe shores of Yemen, accompanied by Daws. Dhii Nuwas came out to meet himwith his forces made up from Himyar and the Yemeni tribes under his control.When they engaged, Dha N u w s and his men were defeated. When he realizedthat disaster had befallen himself and his people, Dhii Nuwas turned his horseto the sea and beat it until it entered the water and took him through the shallowsand out to the depths of the sea where he perished. Aryq entered Yemen andtook control there. At this point Ibn Ishaq records several poems by the Arabsdetailingthese strange events. These poems are in h e , eloquent, vivid, and elegantlanguage, but we omit them here to avoid boring or wearying the reader. AndGod is our helper. A n Account of how Abraha al-Ashram rebelled against,fought, and killed Aryiit, and so assumed power over Yemen.Ibn IshHq stated: \\\"Aryq remained in control over Yemen for some years buteventually Abraha challenged him and the Abyssinian forces split into two sides.One side moved to attack the other, but when the armies approached for battle,Abraha sent a message to Aryst suggesting that he was wrong to pit theAbyssinians against one another to the ultimate damage of all, and that theyshould meet alone in battle, all forces then combining under the authority of theone victorious. T o this AryXt responded with agreement. \\\"Abraha, a short, stocky man and a devout Christian, then went out to fightAryq who was tall, handsome, powerfully built, and bore a javelm. BehindAbraha was a slave named 'Atwada protecting his rear. Arya~struck out, aimingat the top of Abraha's head, hut his javelin hit him on the forehead and slit hiseyebrow, eye, nose, and lip; that was why he was known as al-Ashram, i.e. thecleft-face. Then 'Atwada advanced from behind Abraha and attacked and killedAryxt. The forces of k y a t went over to Abraha and all Abyssinians in Yemenunited under him. Abraha then paid over the blood price for Aryat's deat"
