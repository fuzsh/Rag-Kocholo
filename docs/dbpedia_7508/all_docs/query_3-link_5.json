        "text": "Ala-Maududi\n\n(29:45) (O Prophet), recite the Book that has been revealed to you and establishPrayer.[77] Surely Prayer forbids indecency and evil.[78] And Allah’sremembrance is of even greater merit.[79] Allah knows all that you do.\n\n77. The address apparently is directed to the Prophet (peace be upon him) but, in fact, it ismeant for all the believers. Until now they were being counseled patience and reliance on Allahto brave the extreme trying conditions in which they found themselves, and the persecutions theywere being subjected to on account of their faith. Now they are being told to recite the Quranand establish the Salat as a practical device, for these are the two things which endow abeliever with a strong character and a wonderful capacity by which he can not only bravesuccessfully the most violent storms of evil and falsehood but can even subdue them. But man canacquire this power from the recitation of the Quran and the prayer only when he does not remaincontent with the mere recital of the words but also understands well the Quranic teachings andabsorbs them in his soul. And his prayer does not remain confined to physical movements butbecomes the very function of his heart and the motive force for his morals and character. Thedesired quality of the prayer is being mentioned by the Quran itself in the next sentence. Asfor its recitation, one should know that the recitation which does not reach the heart beyondthe throat, cannot even give man enough power to remain steadfast to his faith, not to speak ofenabling him to withstand the furies of unbelief. About such people, a Hadith says: “They willrecite the Quran, but the Quran will not go beyond their throats; they will leave the faith justas the arrow leaves the bow.” (Bukhari, Muslim, Muatta). As a matter of fact, the recitationwhich does not effect any change in a man’s way of thinking, and his morals and character, andhe goes on doing what the Quran forbids, is not the recitation of a believer at all. About sucha one the Prophet (peace be upon him) has said: “He who makes lawful what the Quran has declaredunlawful, has not believed in the Quran at all.” (Tirmidhi). Such a recitation does not reformand strengthen a man’s self and spirit, but makes him even more stubborn against Allah andimpudent before his own conscience, and destroys his character altogether. For the case of theperson who believes in the Quran as a divine Book, reads it and comes to know what his God hasenjoined, and then goes on violating His injunctions, is of the culprit, who commits a crime notdue to ignorance but after full knowledge of the law. The Prophet (peace be upon him) haselucidated this point in a brief sentence, thus: “The Quran is a testimony in your favor as wellas against you,” (Muslim). That is, “If you follow the Quran rightly, it is a testimony in yourfavor. Whenever you are called to account for your deeds, here or in the Hereafter, you canproduce the Quran as a testimony in your defense, saying that whatever you did was in accordancewith this Book. If what you did was precisely according to it, no jurist in the world will beable to punish you, nor will God in the Hereafter hold you accountable for it. But if this Bookhas reached you, and you have read it and found out what your Lord demands from you, what Heenjoins and what He forbids, and then you adopt an attitude opposed to it, then this Book willbe a testimony against you. It will further strengthen the criminal case against you in thecourt of God. Then it will in no way be possible for you to escape the punishment, or receive alight punishment, by making the excuse of ignorance.\n\n78. This is an important characteristic out of the many characteristics of the prayer, which hasbeen presented here prominently in view of its relevance to the context. To counter the severestorm of opposition and resistance that the Muslims were experiencing in Makkah, they stood inneed of a moral force rather than any material power. To bring about the moral force and developit suitably two practical devices were pointed out in the first instance, the recitation of theQuran and the establishment of the Salat. Now they are being told that the establishment of theSalat is the means through which they can get rid of those evils in which they themselves hadbeen involved before they embraced Islam and in which the non-Muslim Arabs and the non Arabworld around them were involved at that time.\n\nWith a little thinking one can easily understand why this special advantage of the prayer hasbeen particularly mentioned here. Evidently, getting rid of the moral evils is not only usefulinsofar as it is beneficial for those who attain the moral purity, both here and in theHereafter, but its inevitable advantage is that it gives them unique superiority over those whomight be involved in diverse moral evils, and who might be exerting their utmost to sustain theimpure system of ignorance, which nourishes those evils, against the efforts of the morally purepeople. Indecent and evil acts are those which man by nature abhors, and which have always beenheld as evil in principle by the people of every community and society, however depraved andperverted practically. The Arab society in the days of the revelation of the Quran was noexception to this. Those people also were aware of the moral virtues and the evils: they valuedthe good above the evil and there might be none among them, who regarded the evil as identicalwith the good, or depreciated goodness. Under such conditions, in a perverted society like that,the emergence of a movement which revolutionized morally members of the same society itself assoon as they came into contact with it, and raised them in character high above theircontemporaries, inevitably had widespread effects. The common Arabs could not possibly fail tofeel the moral impact of the movement, which eradicated evils and promoted goodness. And couldnot go on following those who were morally corrupt and were fighting to sustain a system ofignorance which had been nourishing those evils since centuries. That is why the Quran at thattime exhorted the Muslims to establish Salat instead of urging them to collect materialresources and force and strength that could win over the people’s hearts and defeat the enemywithout any material force.\n\nThe virtue of the prayer that has been mentioned here has two aspects: Its essential andinseparable quality that it restrains from evil and indecent acts, and its desired quality thatthe one who performs it should, in fact, refrain from evil and indecent acts. As for the firstquality the prayer does restrain people from the evils. Anyone who ponders a little over thenature of the prayer will admit that of all the checks and brakes that can be put on man torestrain him from the evils, the prayer can be the most effective. After all, what check couldbe more effective than this that man should be called upon five times a day for the remembranceof Allah and made to remind himself again and again that he is not wholly free and independentin this world but is the servant of One God, and his God is He Who is aware of his open as wellas hidden acts, even of the most secret aims and intentions of his heart, and a time will surelycome when he will have to account for all his deeds before his God. Then he is not only remindedof this but is given practical training at every prayer time that he should not disobey any ofhis God’s commands even secretly. From the time that he stands up for the prayer till itscompletion man has to perform continuously certain acts in which there is no third person,besides him and his God, who can know whether he has obeyed God’s law or, disobeyed it. Forinstance, if the man’s wudu (state of ablutions) has become void and he stands up for theprayer, there can be no one, besides him and God, who will know that he is no longer in thestate of wudu. If the man has expressed no intention of the prayer but just goes on performingall the required movements and recites poetry, for instance, instead of the prescribed textsquietly, there is none, besides him and his God who can be aware of the secret that he has not,in fact, performed his prayer at all. Not with standing this, if a person offers the prayer fivetimes a day, fulfilling faithfully all the conditions of the divine law in respect of thecleanliness of the body and dress, and the essentials of the prayer and its recitation, etc. itmeans that through this prayer his conscience is being awakened to life several times a day, heis being helped to become a responsible and dutiful person, and he is being practically trainedthat he should, under his own urge of obedience, abide by the law which he has believed inopenly as well as secretly, regardless whether there is any external force to make him abide byit or not, and whether the people of the world have any knowledge of his intentions and deeds ornot.\n\nThus considered, one cannot help admitting that the prayer not only restrains man from the evilsand indecencies but, in fact, there is no other method of training in the world which may be soeffective as the prayer is in restraining man from the evils. As for the question whether or notman in actual fact refrains from the evils even after attendance at the prayer, this dependsupon the man himself, who is undergoing training for self reform. If he has the intention tobenefit from it, and endeavors for it, the reformatory effects of the prayer will certainly havetheir impact on him. Otherwise, evidently, no reformatory device in the world can be effectivewith a person, who is not prepared to receive any impact of it, or tries to avoid its impactintentionally. This can be explained by an example. The essential quality of food is to nourishthe body and develop it. But this advantage can be had only when food is allowed to beassimilated. If a person vomits what he eats after every meal, his food cannot profit him in anyway. Just as, keeping such a person in view, one cannot say that food is not nutritious for thebody, because so and so is becoming a skeleton in spite of eating food. So, one cannot presentthe example of an unrighteous performer of the prayer and say that the prayer does not restrainfrom the evils, because so and so is unrighteous in spite of his prayer. Just as about such aperson it will be apt to say that he does not offer the prayer at all, so about the person whovomits everything he eats, it will be apt to say that he does not eat his food at all.\n\nPrecisely the same thing has been reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) and some greatcompanions and their followers. Imran bin Husain reports that the Prophet (peace be upon him)said: “He whose prayer did not restrain him from the evil and indecent acts, offered no prayerat all,” (Ibn Abi Hatim). Ibn Abbas has reported the Prophet (peace be upon him) as saying: “Theprayer which did not restrain a person from the evil and indecent acts, led him further awayfrom Allah.” (Ibn Abi Hatim, Tabarani). A Hadith containing the same theme has been reported byHasan Basri directly from the Prophet (peace be upon him). Another Hadith reported on theauthority of Ibn Masud is to the effect: “He who did not obey the prayer, offered no prayer atall, and obedience to the prayer is that one should refrain from the evil and indecent acts.”(Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim). Several sayings to the same effect have been reported on theauthority of Abdullah bin Masud, Abdullah bin Abbas, Hasan Basri, Qatadah and Aamash, etc. ImamJafar Sadiq has said: He who wants to know whether his prayer has been accepted or not, shouldsee how far his prayer has restrained him from the evil and indecent acts. If he has beenrestrained from the evils, his prayer has been accepted, (Ruh-al Maani).\n\n79. This can have several meanings: (1) That the remembrance of Allah (i.e. prayer) is a thing ofmuch higher value: it not only restrains from the evils but, over and above that, it inducespeople to act righteously and urges them to excel one another in good acts. (2) That Allah’sremembrance in itself is a great thing: it is the best of acts: no act of man is greater invalue than this. (3) That Allah’s remembrance of you is a greater thing than your remembrance ofHim. Allah has said in the Quran: “So remember Me: I will remember you.” (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 156). Thus,when the servant remembers Allah in the prayer, inevitably Allah also will remember him, and themerit of Allah’s remembering his servant is certainly greater than the servant’s rememberingAllah. Besides these three meanings, there is another subtle meaning also, which the wife ofAbud Darda has explained. She says, “Allah’s remembrance is not restricted to the prayer, but,its sphere is much vaster. When a man observes a fast, or pays the Zakat or performs a righteousact, he inevitably remembers Allah. That is why the righteous act emanates from him. Likewise,when a man refrains from an evil act when an opportunity exists for it, even this also is theresult of Allah’s remembrance. Thus, the remembrance of Allah pervades the entire life of abeliever.\n\nAla-Maududi\n\n(47:4) When you meet the unbelievers (in battle), smite their necks until you have crushed them,then bind your captives firmly; thereafter (you are entitled to) set them free, either by an actof grace, or against ransom, until the war ends.[8] That is for you to do. If Allahhad so willed, He would have Himself exacted retribution from them. (But He did not do so) thatHe may test some of you by means of others.[9] As for those who are slain in the wayof Allah, He shall never let their works go to waste.[10]\n\n8. The words of this verse as well as the context in which it occurs clearly show that it wassent down after the revelation of the command for fighting and before the actual fighting began.The words, “So when you meet (in battle) those who disbelieve”, indicate that the fighting hasnot yet taken place and the Muslims are being instructed that when it does take place, what theyshould do.\n\nThe words of (Surah Muhammad, ayat 20)below testify that this Surah was sent down at a time when the command for fighting had alreadybeen given in (Surah Al-Hajj, Ayat 39)and (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 190), andthe hypocrites of Madinah and the people of the weak faith had been so upset that it seemed asif they were actually facing death.\n\nBesides,(Surah Al-Anfal, ayat 67-69)also testify that this verse had been sent down before the Battle of Badr. There it has beensaid:\n\nIt does not behoove a Prophet to have captives until he has crushed down the enemies in the land.You desire the gains of this world, but Allah desires the Hereafter, and Allah is All-Powerful,All-Wise. Had not a decree already been issued by Allah, you would have incurred a severechastisement in consequence of what you have done. So eat of what you have taken as spoilsbecause it is lawful and pure.\n\nA careful study of this passage shows that what had displeased Allah on this occasion was thatbefore crushing down the enemy completely in the Battle of Badr, the Muslims had started takingthe enemy soldiers as captives, whereas the instruction given to them in Surah Muhammad beforethe actual fighting was this: When you have crushed them completely, then bind the captivestight. However, as the Muslims had been permitted, among other things in Surah Muhammad, toaccept ransom from the prisoners, Allah declared the money taken from the captives of Badr aslawful and did not punish them for that. The words: Had not the decree already been issued byAllah, are clearly pointing to the fact that the command for permission to accept ransom hadalready been given in the Quran before this event, and obviously, there is no other verse in theQuran beside this verse of Surah Muhammad, which contains this command. Therefore, it will haveto be admitted that this verse had been sent down before the above cited verse of the SurahAl-Anfal For explanation, see (Surah Al-Anfal, ayat 69) note 49.\n\nThis is the first verse of the Quran in which preliminary instructions have been given about thelaws of war. Below is given a resume of the injunctions that are derived from this verse and theProphet’s (peace be upon him) and his companions’ practice according to it and the juristicinferences as based on this verse and the Sunnah:\n\n(1) The real aim of the Muslim army in war is to break the fighting power of the enemy until itis crushed and the war lays down its arms. Under no circumstances, should the Muslim’s losesight of this aim and start taking the enemy soldiers as captives. Captives should be takenafter the enemy has been completely crushed and its numbers thinned down. The Arabs have been soinstructed at the outset lest in the greed for ransom and taking slaves they should forget andoverlook the real aim of the war.\n\n(2) About the prisoners taken in war it has been said: You have the option whether you show themfavor or accept ransom from them. This gives the general law that the prisoners of war shouldnot be put to death. Abdullah bin Umar, Hasan Basri, Ata and Hammad bin Abi Sulaiman favor thisview, which is quite valid. They say that a man can be killed only during the war. When the waris over and one has been made a prisoner, it is not lawful to kill him, Ibn Jarir and Abu BakralJassas have related that Hajjaj bin Yousuf handed over one of the prisoners of war to Abdullahbin Umar and commanded him to put him to death. He refused to obey and cited this verse andsaid: We are not allowed to kill a man when he is a prisoner. Imam Muhammad in As-Siyat al-Kabiralso has related that Abdullah bin Amir had commanded Abdullah bin Umar to kill a prisoner ofwar, and he had refused to obey the command for this reason.\n\n(3) But since in this verse it has neither been clearly forbidden to kill the prisoner, theProphet (peace be upon him) understood this intention of Allah’s command, and also actedaccordingly, that if there was a special reason for which the ruler of an Islamic governmentregarded it as necessary to kill a particular prisoner (or prisoners), he could do so. This isnot the general law, but an exception to it, which would be applied only when necessary. Thus,the Prophet (peace be upon him) put to death only Uqbah bin Abi Muait and Nadr bin al-Harithfrom among the 70 prisoners taken at Badr, and only the poet Abu Azzah from the prisoners takenat Uhud. Since the Bani Quraizah had surrendered on the condition that they would acceptwhatever decision Hadrat Saad bin Muadh would give in their regard, and he had decreed that allthe males of the Quraizah should be killed, the Prophet (peace be upon him) had them executed.From among the prisoners taken at Khaiber only Kinanah bin Abi al-Huqaiq was put to deathbecause of his violating the agreement. At the conquest of Makkah, the Prophet (peace be uponhim) commanded in respect of only a few particular persons from among all the inhabitants ofMakkah that any one of them who was captured should be put to death. Apart from theseexceptions, the Prophet (peace be upon him) never killed prisoners of war, and the same alsocontinued to be the practice of the righteous Caliphs. During their times also killing ofprisoners of war was rare, which was resorted to only for a special reason. Umar bin Abdul Azizalso during his caliphate put to death only one prisoner of war for the reason that he hadpersecuted the Muslims very cruelly. On this very basis the majority of the jurists have heldthe view that the Islamic government can put a prisoner to death if necessary. But it is for thegovernment to take such a decision; a soldier is not permitted to kill any prisoner he likes.However, if there is the danger of a prisoner’s running away or of his committing a dangerousmischief, the guard can kill him. In this connection, the jurists of Islam have also made threeother points: (a) That if a prisoner accepts Islam, he cannot be killed; (b) that the prisonercan be killed only as long as he is in the government’s custody; if he has been allotted to, orgiven in somebody else’s possession by sale, he cannot be killed; and (c) that if the prisonerhas to be killed, he should be killed in a straightforward way; he should not be tortured todeath.\n\n(4) The general command that has been given about the prisoners of war is: Show them favor, oraccept ransom from them. Favor includes four things: (a) That they should be treated well asprisoners; (b) that instead of killing them or keeping them in captivity for lifetime, theyshould be handed over to the individual Muslims as slaves; (c) that they should be put underjizyah and made dhimmis; and (d) that they should be set free without ransom.\n\nThere are three ways of ransoming them: (a) That they should be set free on payment of a ransom;(b) that they should be set free after taking some special service from them; and (c) that theyshould be exchanged for the Muslim prisoners of war who are in the possession of the enemy. TheProphet (peace be upon him) and the companions at different times acted in one or the other wayas the occasion demanded. The divine law has not bound the Islamic government to act in only oneparticular way. The government can take any action it deems appropriate on a particularoccasion.\n\n(5) The practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the companions confirms that as long as aprisoner of war is in the government’s custody, the government will be responsible for his foodand clothing, and his treatment if he is ill or wounded. Islamic law does not permit prisonersto be kept without food or clothing, or be subjected to torture. On the contrary, instructionsalso have been given to treat them well and generously, and precedents of this very practice arefound in the Sunnah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) distributed the prisoners of Badr in thehouses of different companions and gave the instruction: Teat these prisoners well. One of thoseprisoners, Abu Aziz, has reported: The Ansar Muslims, in whose house I was kept, gave me breadin the morning and the evening, but as for themselves they had only dates to eat. About anotherprisoner; Suhail bin Amr, the Prophet (peace be upon him) was told: He is a fiery speaker, andhas been making speeches against you: please have his teeth broken. The Prophet (peace be uponhim) replied: If I have his teeth broken, Allah will break my teeth, although I am a Prophet.(Ibn Hisham). When Thumamah bin Uthal, the chief of Yamamah, was brought as a prisoner, he wasprovided with good food and milk on the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) orders as long as heremained a captive. (Ibn Hisham). The same was the practice in the time of the companions. Noprecedent is found when a prisoner might have been mistreated in their time.\n\n(6) Islam has not permitted that the prisoners be kept in captivity forever so that thegovernment may subject them to forced labor as long as it likes. If they are not exchanged forother prisoners of war, or ransomed, the method enjoined of doing them favor is that they shouldbe made slaves and given in possession of individuals, and their masters instructed to treatthem well This method was acted upon during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) as wellas of the companions, and the jurists of Islam have unanimously upheld it as permissible. Inthis regard, it should be borne in mind that a person who might have accepted Islam before beingtaken as prisoner, and then is somehow made a prisoner, will be set free, but the acceptance ofIslam by a person who accepts it after being taken prisoner, or after being given in possessionof somebody, will not gain him freedom automatically. A tradition has been related in MusnadAhmad, Muslim and Tirmidhi on the authority of Imran bin Husain that a person from among theBani Uqail was brought as a prisoner and he said: I have accepted Islam. Thereupon the Prophet(peace be upon him) said: If you had said this when you were free, you would certainly haveattained to success. The same thing was said by Umar: When a prisoner becomes a Muslim afterfalling into the hands of the Muslims as a captive, he will not be killed, but will remain aslave. Oh this very point, the jurists of Islam have unanimously ruled that the prisoner whobecomes a Muslim after being taken captive cannot escape slavery. (Imam Muhammad, As-Siyaral-Kabir). And this also is quite reasonable. If our law had been that anyone, who embracedIslam after being taken a captive, would be set free, no prisoner would be so foolish as not towin his freedom by pronouncing the Kalimah.\n\n(7) The third manner of doing favor with the prisoners according to the law of Islam is that theymay be put under jizyah and made dhimmi subjects of the Islamic state and allowed to live asfree citizens of dar-al-Islam (abode of Islam) just like the Muslims. Imam Muhammad writes inhis As-Siyar alKabir: Any person who can be made a slave, can also be made a dhimmi and putunder jizyah. At another place he says: “The ruler of the Muslims has the right to levy jizyahon them and a tax on their lands and set than absolutely free. This method has been practicedgenerally in the condition when the territory of the people who have been made prisoners, isconquered and annexed to the Islamic state. The Prophet (peace be upon him), for instance,practiced this method in the case of the people of Khaiber, and then Umar followed and practicedit extensively on the conquest of Iraq and other territories. Abu Ubaid writes in hisKitab-al-Amwal: After the conquest of Iraq a deputation of the leading men of that country camebefore Umar and submitted: O Commander of the Faithful, before this the people of Iran hadsubdued us: they subjected us to harsh treatment and committed all sorts of excesses against us.Then, when God sent you, we became very pleased, and we neither put up any resistance againstyou nor participated in the war. Now, we hear that you want to make us slaves. Umar replied: Youhave the option either to become Muslims, or accept to pay jizyah and remain free. They agreedto pay the jizyah and they were granted full freedom. At another place in the same book. AbuUbaid says: Umar wrote to Abu Musa al-Ashari: Set free every farmer and peasant from among thepeople who have been captured in the war.\n\n(8) The fourth favor is that the prisoner be set free without ransom. This is a specialconcession that the Islamic government can give only in case the special conditions of aprisoner demand it, or when it is expected that the concession will win the prisoner’s gratitudeforever, and help turn him a friend from an enemy, or a believer from a disbeliever; otherwise,obviously it would in no way be a wise thing to set free a person of the enemy camp, who couldagain return to fight the Muslims. This is why the Muslim jurists generally have opposed it, andimposed the condition: If the ruler of the Muslims finds it expedient to set the prisoners, orsome of them, free as a favor, there is no harm in doing so. (As-Siyat al-Kabir). Manyprecedents of this are found in the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and in almost everycase expediency seems to be the reason.\n\nAbout the prisoners taken at Badr, he said: If Mutim bin Adi were alive, and had spoken to me inrespect of these treacherous people, I would have let them go for his sake. (Bukhari, Abu Daud,Musnad Ahmad). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said this because when he had returned from Taifto Makkah, Mutim at that time had given him refuge, and his armed sons had escorted him to theKabah. Therefore, he wanted to repay his debt of gratitude in this way.\n\nAccording to Bukhari, Muslim and Musnad Ahmad, when Thumamah bin Uthal, the chief of Yamamah, wasbrought as a prisoner, the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked him: Thumamah, what do you say? Hereplied: If I am killed, then such a one would be killed, whose blood has some value: if I amshown favor, then favor would be shown to a person, who appreciates favor; and if you wantwealth, ask for it, you will be given it. For three days the Prophet (peace be upon him) askedhim the same thing and he gave the same reply. At last, the Prophet (peace be upon him) orderedthat Thumamah be set free. On attaining freedom, he went to a nearby oasis, washed himself andcame back, pronounced the kalimah and became a Muslim, saying: Before this day nobody was moredetestable than you and no religion more odious than your religion in my sight, but now for meno man is more lovable than you and no religion more lovable than your religion. Then he went toMakkah for Umrah and gave the people of Quraish a notice to the effect: After this no grain willreach you from Yamamah unless Muhammad (peace be upon him) permits it. So, he stopped the grainsupply and the people of Makkah had to request the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he shouldnot stop the supply of grain for them from Yamamah.\n\nFrom among the prisoners of the Bani Quraizah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forgave Zabir binBata and Amr bin Saad (or Ibn Suda), the former because he had given refuge to Thabit bin QaisAnsari in the battle of Buath, in the pre-Islamic days of ignorance; therefore, he handed himover to Thabit that he may repay him for his favor. And he forgave Amr bin Sad because it was hewho was exhorting his tribe not to be treacherous when the Bani Quraizah were committing breachof the trust with the Prophet (peace be upon him).\n\nAfter the Battle of Bani-al-Mustaliq, when the prisoners were brought and distributed among thepeople, the Prophet (peace be upon him) paid Juwairiyah’s ransom to the person to whom she wasallotted to secure her freedom and then married her to himself. At this all the Muslims settheir own prisoners free, saying: Now they have become the Prophet’s relatives. Thus, theprisoners of a hundred families became free. (Musnad Ahmad, Tabaqat Ibn Saad, Ibn Hisham).\n\nOn the occasion of the treaty of Hudaibiyah, at about dawn, 80 men came from the direction ofTanim with the intention of launching a sudden attack on the Muslim camp, but were all captured,and the Prophet (peace be upon him) set all of them free lest it became a cause of war on thatcritical occasion. (Muslim, Abu Daud, Nasai, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad).\n\nAt the conquest of Makkah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forgave all the people of Makkahexcept only a few men, and did not kill more than three or four of even those who had been madean exception. The whole of Arabia was well aware of what atrocities the people of Makkah hadcommitted against the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Muslims; yet he forgave them afterattaining complete victory over them, gave the Arabs the satisfaction that they had not beenoverpowered by a tyrant but by a merciful, affectionate and generous leader. That is why afterthe conquest of Makkah the Arabian peninsula did not take longer than two years to be completelysubdued.\n\nAfter the Battle of Hunain, when the Hawazin deputation came to secure the freedom of theirprisoners, the prisoners had already been distributed. The Prophet (peace be upon him) calledthe Muslims together and said: These people have come with repentance, and I am of the opinionthat their men should be returned to them. He who would like to set the prisoner allotted to himfree willingly without ransom, should set him free, and the one who would like to take ransom,shall be paid it out of the first income that is received in the Public Treasury. Thus, sixthousand prisoners were set free, and those who wanted to take ransom, were given it by thegovernment. (Bukhari, Abu Daud, Musnad Ahmad, Tabaqat Ibn Saad). This also shows that thegovernment is not authorized to set the prisoners free after they have been distributed; thiscan be done by the willing approval of those in whose possession the prisoners have been given,or by paying them the ransom.\n\nAfter the Prophet (peace be upon him), precedents of setting the prisoners free as a favorcontinue to be found throughout the period of the companions also. Abu Bakr set free Ashath binQais al-Kindi and Umar granted freedom to Hurmuzan and the prisoners of Manadhir and Maisan.(Abu Ubaid, Kitab alAmwal).\n\n(9) The precedent of setting the prisoners free on payment of the ransom in the time of theProphet (peace be upon him) is found only on the occasion of Badr, when the prisoners were setfree on payment of one thousand to four thousand dirhams each. (Tabaqat Ibn Saad, Kitab al-Amwal). No precedent of this is found in the time of the companions; and the jurists of Islamhave generally disapproved it, for it means that we should take money and set a man free so thathe may again rise against us with the sword. But since taking of ransom has been permitted inthe Quran, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) also acted according to it once, it is notabsolutely forbidden. Imam Muhammad writes in his As-Siyar al-Kabir that if the need arises theMuslims can free their prisoners on payment of the ransom.\n\n(10) The criterion of freeing a prisoner for a service rendered is also found in connection withthe battle of Badr. For those of the Quraish prisoners who had no ransom the Prophet (peace beupon him) imposed the condition that they should teach reading and writing to ten Ansar childreneach to win their freedom. (Musnad Ahmad, Tabaqat Ibn Saad, Kitab al-Amwal).\n\n(11) Several instances of the exchange of prisoners are found in the time of the Prophet (peacebe upon him). Once he dispatched Abu Bakr on an expedition and he brought some captives,including a beautiful woman, who fell to the lot of Salamah bin Akwa. The Prophet urged him togive her back, then sent her to Makkah and had several Muslim prisoners released, in exchangefor her. (Muslim, Abu Daud, Tahawi Kitab al-Amwal of Abi Ubaid, Tabaqat Ibn Saad). Imran binHusain relates that once the tribe of Thaqif arrested two men of the Muslims. Some time later, aman of the Bani Uqail, who were allies of the Thaqif, was arrested by the Muslims. The Prophet(peace be upon him) sent him to Taif and got both the Muslims released in exchange for him.(Muslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad). From among the jurists Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad, ImamShafai, Imam Malik and Imam Ahmad hold the exchange of the prisoners as permissible. A ruling ofImam Abu Hanifah is that exchange should not be practiced, but according to another ruling ofhis exchange can be practiced. However, there is a consensus that the prisoner who becomes aMuslim should not be handed over to the disbelievers for the purpose of exchange.\n\nThis explanation makes it abundantly clear that Islam has formulated a comprehensive code inrespect of the prisoners of war, which contains provision for this problem in every age underall sorts of conditions. Those people who take this Quranic verse in its simple meaning that theprisoners of war should either be shown favor and set free or freed for ransom, do not know whatdifferent aspects the question of the prisoners of war has, and what problems it has beencreating in different ages and can create in the future.\n\n9. That is, if Allah had only wanted to crush the worshipers of falsehood, He did not stand inneed of your help for this. He could have done this through an earthquake or a tempest in notime, But what He wills is that the followers of the truth among the people should enter into aconflict with the worshipers of falsehood and fight against them so that the qualities andcharacteristics of each are brought out clearly by means of the test and each is given the placeand rank that he deserves according to his conduct.\n\n10. It means this: A person’s being slain in the way of Allah does not mean that he lost his lifeand as far as his person was concerned, all his lifework was wasted. It is wrong to think thatthe sacrifices of the martyrs are not beneficial for themselves but only for those who liveafter them in the world, and take advantage of their sacrifices. The fact is that even for themartyrs themselves it is a bargain of profit, not of loss at all.\n\nAla-Maududi\n\n(60:10) Believers, when believing women come to you as Emigrants (in the cause of faith), examinethem. Allah fully knows (the truth) concerning their faith. And when you have ascertained themto be believing women, do not send them back to the unbelievers.[14] Those women areno longer lawful to the unbelievers, nor are those unbelievers lawful to those (believing)women. Give their unbelieving husbands whatever they have spent (as bridal-dues); and there isno offence for you to marry those women if you give them their bridal-dues.[15] Donot hold on to your marriages with unbelieving women: ask for the return of the bridal-due yougave to your unbelieving wives and the unbelievers may ask for the return of the bridal-due theyhad given to their believing wives.[16] Such is Allah’s command. He judges betweenyou. Allah is All-Knowing, Most Wise.\n\n14. The background of this injunction is that after the peace treaty of Hudaibiyah, in thebeginning, the Muslim men started fleeing Makkah, while arriving at Al-Madinah they were sentback according to the terms of the treaty. Then the Muslim women started arriving and first ofall, Umm Kulthum Uqbah bin Abi Muait emigrated to Al- Madinah, The disbelievers invoked thetreaty and demanded return, and two brothers of Umm Kulthum, Walid bin Uqbah and Amarah binUqbah, came to Al- Madinah to take her back. At this the question arose whether the treaty ofHudaibiyah applied to the women as well. Allah has answered this very question here, saying: Ifthey are Muslims, and it is ascertained that they have emigrated only for the sake of the faithand for no other motive, they are not to be returned.\n\nHere, a complication has arisen on account of the narration of the Hadith from the viewpoint ofthe meaning and content, and it must be resolved. The traditions that are found in the Ahadithabout the conditions of the treaty of Hudaibiyah are mostly traditions narrated from theviewpoint of the meaning and purport. About the condition under discussion the words in thedifferent traditions are different. In some the words are to the effect: Whoever reaches us fromyou, we will not return him, but whoever reaches you from us, you shall return. In some othersthe words are to the effect: Whoever of his companions comes to the Messenger (peace be uponhim) of Allah without the permission of his guardian, he will send him back. And in stillanother, the words are: Whoever, from the Quraish goes to Muhammad (peace be upon him) withoutthe permission of his guardian, he will return him to Quraish. The style of these traditions byitself shows that this condition of the treaty has not been reported in the actual words of thetreaty, but the reporters have reported its purport in their own words. But since most of thetraditions are of the same nature, the commentators and traditionists generally have understoodthat the treaty was general, which applied to both men and women, and the women too were to bereturned according to it. Later, when this injunction of the Quran that the believing women werenot to be returned, came to their knowledge, they interpreted it to mean that Allah in thisverse had decided to break the treaty in so far as it related to the believing women. But thiswas not an ordinary thing which should be accepted so easily. If the treaty was general, withoutany exception in respect of men and women, it could not be lawful for one party to amend itunilaterally and change a part of it by itself. And even if such a thing happened, it is strangethat the Quraish did not protest against it, whereas they remained on the lookout for anopportunity to raise objections against everything that the Prophet (peace be upon him) and theMuslims did. Had they found that the Prophet had committed a breach of the treaty conditions,they would have raised a loud clamor. But we do not find any trace of it in any tradition thatthey took an exception to this ruling of the Quran. Had this question been carefully consideredthe problem could have been resolved by reference to the actual words of the treaty. But manypeople paid no attention to it. If some scholars (e.g. Qadi Abu Bakr Ibn al-Arabi) did pay anyattention, they did not hesitate to say that the reason why the Quraish did not raise anyobjection was that Allah had miraculously scaled their mouths in this matter. It is strange howthese scholars felt satisfied at this explanation.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that this condition of the peace treaty had been proposed by thedisbelieving Quraish, and not by the Muslims, and the words that Suhail bin Amr, theirrepresentative, had gotten included in the treaty were: And that whichever man (rajul) come toyou from us, even if he be on your religion, you will return him to us. These words of thetreaty have been reproduced in Bukhari (Kitab ash-Shurut: Bab ash-Shurut fil-Jihad wal-Masalahah) through authentic channels. It may be that Suhail used the word rajul in the meaningof a person, but this might be the meaning he had in his mind. The word written in the treatywas rajul, which is used for a fullgrown man in Arabic. That is why when the brothers of UmmKulthum bint Uqbah came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and demanded her return, (accordingto Imam Zuhri’s tradition), Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) refused to return her, saying: Thecondition was about the men, not the women. (Ibn al-Arabi, Ahkam al-Quran; Loam Razi, TafsirKabir) Until then the people of Quraish themselves were under the delusion that the treatyapplied to all kinds of emigrants, men or women; But when the Prophet (peace be upon him) drewtheir attention to these words of the treaty, they were struck dumb and had to accept thisdecision.\n\nAccording to this condition of the treaty the Muslims had the right to decline return of anywoman who emigrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah for any reason whatsoever. But Islam wasinterested only in safeguarding the believing women and not to make the holy city of Al-Madinaha place of refuge for every kind of female fugitive. Therefore, Allah enjoined: Ascertain byexamination the faith of the women who emigrated to you and profess to have believed; and whenit is fully ascertained that they have emigrated with genuine faith, and no other motive, do notreturn them. Thus, the procedure adopted for carrying out this command was that the women whoemigrated were questioned whether they believed in the oneness of Allah and the Prophethood ofMuhammad (peace be upon him) and had emigrated only for the sake of Allah and His Messenger(peace be upon him), and not out of any worldly consideration, e.g. hatred of the husband, orlove of somebody in Al-Madinah, or some other worldly motive. Only those women who gavesatisfactory answers to these questions were allowed to stay, others were sent back. (Ibn Jariron the authority of Iba Abbas, Qatadah, Mujahid, Ikrimah, Ibn Zaid).\n\nIn this verse a basic principle of the law of evidence has also been stated and its furtherclarification has been made by the procedure that the Prophet (peace be upon him) had prescribedfor implementing it, The verse enjoins three things:\n\n(1) Examine the faith of the emigrating women who present themselves as believers.\n\n(2) Allah alone knows the truth about their faith; the Muslims have no means to find out whetherthey have really believed or not.\n\n(3) When it has been ascertained that they are believers, they are not to be returned.\n\nThen, in accordance with this injunction, the method that the Prophet (peace be upon him)prescribed for examining and ascertaining the faith of the women was that the statement given bythem on oath should be relied on and it should be made sure after necessary examination thatthey had no other motive of emigration than the faith. First, it gives the principle that fortaking decision on different matters it is not necessary for the court to have direct knowledgeof the truth; for the court only that knowledge is sufficient which is obtained throughevidence. Second, the statement given by a person on oath will be regarded as reliable until itis proved to be false by a clear evidence. Third, whatever declaration a person himself may makeabout his creed and faith, will be accepted and no search will be made into finding out, whetherwhat he states actually constitutes his faith or not, unless there is a clear indication to thecontrary. And fourth, in the personal affairs of a person, which no one else can know, his ownstatement will be trusted. e.g. in the matters of divorce and the waiting period (iddat) thewoman’s own statement about her menstrual course and state of purity will be regarded asreliable, whether it is true or false. According to these very rules, in the science of theHadith also, those traditions will be accepted, the apparent state of whose reporters testifiesto their being righteous, unless, of course, there are other circumstances which forbid theacceptance of a particular tradition.\n\n15. This means that, a Muslim who wants to marry any of these women should pay a fresh dower andmarry her. The dowers to he repaid to their unbelieving husbands will not be considered theirdowers.\n\n16. Four very important injunctions have been laid down in these verses, which relate both to thefamily law of Islam and to the international law.\n\nFirst, that the woman who becomes a Muslim is no longer lawful for her unbelieving husband norher unbelieving husband is lawful for her.\n\nSecond, that the marriage of the married woman who becomes a Muslim and emigrates from the abodeof disbelief (dar al-kufr) to the abode of Islam (dar al-lslam) is automatically annulled, andany Muslim who likes can marry her after paying her dower.\n\nThird, that it is not lawful for a man who becomes a Muslim to retain his wife in wedlock if shelikes to remain an infidel.\n\nFourth, that if there exist relations of peace between the abode of disbelief and the abode ofIslam, the Islamic government should try to settle the question of the return of dowers with thenon-Muslim government, thus: The dowers of the married women of the disbelievers, who becomeMuslims and emigrate to the abode of Islam, should be returned by the Muslims, and the dowers ofthe unbelieving married women of the Muslims who are left behind in the abode of disbelief,should be taken back from the disbelievers.\n\nThe historical background of these injunctions is as follows: In the beginning of Islam, therewere many such men, who accepted Islam but their wives did not become Muslim, and there weremany such women who became Muslim but their husbands did not accept Islam. Abul Aas, the husbandof Zainab, a daughter of the Prophet (peace be upon him), was a non-Muslim and he remainednon-Muslim for several years. In the early period no command had been given to the effect thatthe pagan husband was unlawful for the Muslim wife and the pagan wife was unlawful for theMuslim husband. Therefore, the marital relations continued to exist between them. Even after themigration for several years, it so happened that many women became Muslim and emigrated toAl-Madinah while their pagan husbands remained in the abode of disbelief. Likewise, many Muslimmen emigrated and their pagan wives were left in the abode of disbelief. But in spite of thistheir marriage continued. This was creating complications for the women in particular, for themen could marry other women, but this was not possible for the women. Until their marriage withtheir previous husbands was dissolved, they could not remarry. After the peace treaty ofHudaibiyah when these verses came down, they annulled the previous marriage between the Muslimsand the pagans, and laid down an absolute and clear law for guidance in future. The jurists ofIslam have codified this law under four major titles:\n\nFirst, the case when both the man and the wife are in the abode of Islam and one of them becomesa Muslim and the other remains an infidel.\n\nSecond, the case when both the man and the wife are in the abode of disbelief, and one of thembecomes a Muslim and the other remains an infidel.\n\nThird, the case when one of the spouses becomes a Muslim and emigrates to the abode of Islam andthe other remains an infidel in the abode of disbelief.\n\nFourth, the case when either of the Muslim spouses becomes an apostate.\n\nBelow we give the viewpoints of the jurists with regard to all the four cases separately:\n\n(1) In the first case, if the husband has accepted Islam and his wife is a Christian or a Jewess,and she remains faithful to her religion, their marriage will endure, for it is permissible fora Muslim to have a wife who is a follower of the earlier scriptures. This is agreed upon by alljurists.\n\nAnd if the wife of the man who has accepted Islam, is not a follower of the earlier Books, andshe adheres to her faith, the Hanafis say that Islam will be presented before her; if sheaccepts it, the marriage will endure; if she refuses to accept it, separation will be effectedbetween them. In this case, if consummation between them had taken place, the woman will beentitled to the dower; if there was no consummation, she will not be entitled to any dower, forseparation has been caused because of her refusal. (Al- Mabsut; Hedayah; Fath al-Qadir). ImamShafei and Imam Ahmad say that if the spouses did not have consummation, the woman would beoutside wedlock as soon as the man accepted Islam, and if consummation had taken place; thewoman will remain in wedlock till three menstruations. During this period if she accepts Islamof her own free will, the marriage will continue, otherwise it will become void automatically assoon as she is free from her third menstrual course. Imam Shafei also adds that it is not rightto present Islam before the woman on the basis of the pledge of non-interference in religionthat the dhimmis have been given by the Muslims. But this, in fact, is a weak argument; for itwould be interference in the dhimmi woman’s religion if she was compelled to accept Islam. It isno interference to tell her that if she accepted Islam, she would continue to be her husband’swife, otherwise she would be separated from him. In Ali’s time there has been a precedent ofthis nature. An Iraqi landowner who was a Majusi by religion accepted Islam and his wiferemained an unbeliever, AIi presented Islam before her, and when she refused to accept it, heeffected separation between them. (Al-Mabsut). Imam Malik says that if consummation has nottaken place, the unbelieving wife would forthwith cease to be the wife as soon as the manembraced Islam, and if consummation has taken place, Islam would be presented before the woman,and in case she refuses to accept it, separation will result. (Ibn Qudamah, Al-Mughni ).\n\nAnd if Islam has been accepted by the woman and the man remains an infidel, whether he is afollower of an earlier scripture or a non-follower, the Hanafis say that Islam will be presentedbefore the husband whether consummation between them has taken place or not. If he accepts it,the woman will continue to be his wife; if he rejects it, the qadi will effect separationbetween them. So long as the man does not refuse to accept Islam, the woman will remain hiswife, but he will not have the right to have sexual relations with her. In case the husbandrefuses, separation will become effective just like an irrevocable divorce. If consummation hasnot taken place before this, the woman will be entitled to half the dower, and if it has takenplace, the woman will be entitled to full dower as well as maintenance during the waiting period(iddat). (AI-Mabsut; Hedayah; Fath at-Qadir). According to Imam Shafei, marriage will dissolveas soon as the woman accepted Islam in case consummation has not taken place, and in case it hastaken place, the woman will continue to be the man’s wife till the end of the waiting period. Ifin the mean-time he accepts Islam, marriage will remain valid, otherwise separation will takeplace as soon as the waiting period comes to an end. But in the case of the man, Imam Shafei hasalso expressed the same opinion as he has expressed about the woman as cited above. That is, itis not right to present Islam before him. But this is a weak opinion. In the time of Umar, onseveral occasions, the woman accepted Islam and the man was invited to Islam; when he refused toaccept it, separation was effected between the spouses. There is, for examples the case of thewife of a Christian of the Bani Taghlib, which was brought before him. Umar said to the man:Accept Islam, otherwise I will effect separation between you two. He declined, and the Caliphenforced the decree. The case of a newly converted lady of Bahz al-Malik was sent to him. In hercase too he ordered that Islam be presented before her husband; if he accepts it well and good,otherwise separation be effected between them. These incidents had happened in front of thecompanions and no dispute or difference of opinion has been reported. (AI-Jassas, Ahkamal-Quran; Al Mabsut; Fath al-Qadir). Imam Malik’s opinion in this connection is that if thewoman becomes a Muslim before the consummation of marriage Islam should be presented before thehusband; if he accepts it, well and good; otherwise separation should be effected forthwith. Andif consummation has taken place, and the woman has accepted Islam afterwards, she will have towait till the end of the waiting period. If the husband accepts Islam in the meantime, marriagewill continue otherwise separation will take place as soon as the waiting period expires. Asaying of Imam Ahmad is in support of Imam Shafei. His other saying is to the effect that theevent of the difference of religion between the spouses will in any case lead to immediateseparation, whether consummation between them has taken place or not. (Al-Mughni).\n\n(2) If in dar al-kufr (abode of disbelief) the woman becomes a Muslim and the man remains aninfidel, or the man becomes a Muslim and the wife (who neither is Christian nor Jew but isfollower of a non-revealed religion) remains an infidel, the Hanafi viewpoint is that separationwill not take place, whether consummation between them has taken place or not, until the womancompletes three menstrual courses, or until she passes three months in case she isnonmenstruating. If in the meantime the other spouse is also converted, marriage will remainvalid, otherwise separation will take place on the expiry of the term. Imam Shafei, in this casealso, distinguishes between the occurrence of consummation and its non-occurrence. He maintainsthat if there was no consummation, separation would occur immediately on the event of thedifference of religion between the spouses. And if the difference of religion has occurred afterthe consummation, marriage will continue valid until the end of the waiting period. If in themeantime the other spouse does not accept Islam, marriage will dissolve as soon as the waitingperiod comes to an end. (Al Mabsut, Fath al-Qadir, Al-Jassas Ahkam al-Quran).\n\nIn case where along with the difference of religion between the spouses the separation of abodealso takes place, i.e. one of them remains an infidel in daral-kufr (the non-Muslim state) andthe other emigrates to dar al-lslam (the Islamic state), the Hanafi viewpoint is that marriagebetween them will automatically dissolve. If the emigrant is the woman, she has the right toremarry immediately; she does not have to observe any waiting period. However, her husband willhave to abstain from sexual intercourse until after she has discharged the menses once; and ifshe is pregnant, even then marriage can be contracted, but the husband must abstain fromcohabitation until after the delivery. Imam Muhammad and Imam Abu Yusuf have differed from ImamAbu Hanifah in this. They say that the woman has to observe the waiting period; and if she ispregnant, she cannot contract marriage before the delivery. (Al-Mabsut; Hedayah; AI-Jassas,Ahkam al-Quran). Imam Shafei, Imam Ahmad and Imam Malik maintain that the separation of abodehas nothing to do with this, for the real thing is only the difference of religions. If thisdifference takes place between the spouses, the injunctions to govern this are the same as thosewhich govern it in case such a difference takes place between the spouses in the Islamic state(Al-Mughni). Imam Shafei along with his above cited opinion has also expressed the view that ifthe emigrant Muslim woman has emigrated after a quarrel with her infidel husband, with theintention of dissolving his marital right, an immediate separation will take place not on thebasis of the separation of abode (ikhtilaf dar) but on the basis of her this intention.(Al-Mabsut Hedayah).\n\nBut a careful consideration of the Quranic verse under discussion clearly shows that in thismatter the most sound opinion is the one that Imam Abu Hanifah has expressed. Allah has sentdown this verse concerning the believing women who emigrated and about them He has said thatthey are no longer lawful for the pagan husbands whom they have left behind in dar al-kufr, andhas allowed the Muslims of the Islamic state to marry them after they have paid them the dowers.On the other hand, the emigrant Muslims have been addressed and enjoined not to keep those oftheir pagan wives in wedlock, who are left is dar alkufr, and to ask of the disbelievers thedowers that they had given to those women. Obviously, these injunctions do not pertain only tothe difference of religion, but it is the difference of abode that has given these injunctionsthis particular form. If on account of migration the marriages of the Muslim women with theirpagan husbands had not become dissolved, how could the Muslims be permitted to marry them. Andthat too in a way that the permission does not contain any reference to the observance of thewaiting period by them. Likewise, if even after the revelation of the command, “and you alsoshould not hold back unbelieving women in marriage” the pagan wives of the Muslim emigrants hadcontinued to be their wives, they also would have been commanded to divorce them. But there isno reference here to this either. No doubt, it is correct that after the revelation of thisverse, Umar and Talhah and some other emigrants had divorced their wives, but this is no proofthat such a thing was at all necessary, and their severing of the marital relationship withthose wives depended on their pronouncing divorce on them, and if they had not pronounced thedivorce, the wives would have continued to be their legal wives.\n\nIn response to this, three events of the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) time are quoted asprecedents, which are regarded as a proof that even after the revelation these verses theprophet (peace be upon him), in spite of the separation of abode, allowed the marriagerelationship to continue between the believing and the unbelieving spouses. The first event isthis, a little before the conquest of Makkah, Abu Sufyan visited the Islamic army at Marr az-Zahran (present Wadi Fatimah) and accepted Islam, and his wife, Hind, remained a pagan inMakkah. Then Hind accepted Islam after the conquest of Makkah, and the Prophet (peace be uponhim) ruled that their previous marriage would continue to be valid. The second event is thatafter the conquest of Makkah, Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl and Hakim bin Hizam fled Makkah and in theirabsence the wives of both became Muslims. Then they sought the Prophet’s protection for theirhusbands and went and brought them back. Both the men come before the Prophet (peace be uponhim) and accepted Islam and in their case too he held their previous marriages as valid. Thethird event relates to the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) own daughter, Zainab, who emigrated toAl-Madinah and her husband, Abul-Aas, was left an infidel in Makkah. About him Musnad Ahmad, AbuDaud, Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah contain a tradition on the authority of Ibn Abbas, saying that hecame to Al-Madinah in A.H. 8 and became a Muslim, and the Prophet (peace be upon him) allowedhis daughter to continue in marriage with him, without renewal of marriage. But the first two ofthese events, in fact, do not come under the definition of the difference of abode. For thedifference of abode does not mean a person’s temporarily leaving one place for another, or hisfleeting to another place, but the difference takes place only in case a person emigrates fromone place and settles down in another place and the difference of nationality takes placebetween him and his wife. As for the event relating to Zainab, there are two traditions, onerelated on the authority of Ibn Abbas, as referred to above, and the other related by ImamAhmad, Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah on the authority of Abdullah bin Amr bin Aas. In this secondtradition it has been stated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) allowed his daughter tocontinue as the wife of Abul- Aas after renewal of the marriage, and with a fresh dower. Thus,in the first place, this precedent, due to the difference in reporting, no longer remains adefinite argument with those who deny the legal effect of the separation of abode. Secondly, ifthey insist on the authenticity of Ibn Abbas’s tradition, it contradicts their own viewpoint.For, according to their viewpoint, the marriage of the spouses between whom difference ofreligion takes place and who have consummated their marriage remains valid only until threemenstruations. In the meantime if the other party also accepts Islam, the marriage continues tobe valid, otherwise it dissolves automatically as soon as the third menstrual course starts. Butin the case of Zainab from which they take their argument, the difference of religion betweenthe spouses had taken place several years earlier. Abul Aas had affirmed the faith six yearsafter Zainab’s emigration, and at least two years before his conversion to Islam the injunctionhad been revealed in the Quran, according to which the Muslim woman had been forbidden for thepagans.\n\n(4) The fourth case is of apostasy. Its one form is that both the husband and the wife shouldbecome apostates together, and the other that one of them becomes an apostate and the otherremains a Muslim. If both the husband and the wife become apostates together, the Shafeis andthe Hanbalis say that their marriage contracted in Islam will dissolve immediately if thishappened before consummation, and after the lapse of the waiting period if it happened afterconsummation. On the contrary, the Hanafis hold the view that although according to common sensetheir marriage should dissolve, yet in the time of Abu Bakr, when thousands of people becameapostates, and then again became Muslims, the companions did not direct anyone to renew themarriage; therefore, we accept this unanimous decision of the companions and admit, contrary tocommon sense, that in case both the husband and the wife become apostates together, theirmarriages do not dissolve.(Al Mabsut; Hedayah; Fath al-Qadir Al-Fiqh alal-Madhahib al-Arbah).\n\nIf the husband becomes an apostate and the wife continues to be Muslim, according to the Hanafisand the Malikis, the marriage will dissolve immediately, whether this happens beforeconsummation or after it. But the Shafeis and the Hanbalis in this connection make a distinctionbetween the two states. If it happens before consummation, the marriage will dissolvedimmediately, and if it happens after consummation it will endure till the end of the waitingperiod, In the meantime if the person returns to Islam, marriage will continue to hold good,otherwise, on the expiry of the waiting period, it will be deemed to have dissolved since hebecame an apostate. That is, the woman will not have to observe another waiting period afresh.All the four jurists agree that if this happened before consummation, the woman would beentitled to half the dower, and if after consummation to full dower.\n\nAnd if the woman became an apostate, the old ruling of the Hanafis was that in this case toomarriage would dissolve immediately. But later the scholars of Balkh and Samarkand gave theruling that in case the woman becomes an apostate, separation does not take place immediately;and by this their object was to discourage the women from adopting this course in order to getrid of their husbands. The Malikis verdict is somewhat similar. They say that if circumstancestestify that the woman adopted this course only as a pretence to win separation from thehusband, separation will not take place. The Shafeis and the Hanbalis say that in case of thewoman’s turning an apostate too, the law is the same as in case of the husband’s turning anapostate. That is, if she became an apostate before consummation, marriage would dissolveimmediately and if after consummation, Marriage will endure till the end of the waiting period.If conversion takes place in the meantime marriage will continue to hold good, otherwise it willbe deemed to have dissolved since the time of apostasy. There is consensus with regard to thedower. If the woman became an apostate, before consummation she would not be entitled to anydower, and if she adopted apostasy after consummation, she would be entitled to full dower.(Al-Mabsut. Hedayah; Fath al-Qadlr, Al Mughni; Al-Fiqh alal-Madhahib al-Arbah)."
