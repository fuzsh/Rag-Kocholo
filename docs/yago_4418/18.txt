Husband and wife MPs Alan and Ann Keen claimed almost £40,000 a year on a London flat although their family home was less than 10 miles away.

Having bought the flat in 2002, they claimed close to the top allowance since then.

Mr Keen is MP for Feltham and Heston, his wife represents Brentford and Isleworth.

They allegedly claimed for interest on mortgages worth £520,000 - even though the apartment only cost £500,000.

Usually MPs cannot claim on two homes. But Mr Keen said the fees office agreed to pay claims on mortgages on both..
