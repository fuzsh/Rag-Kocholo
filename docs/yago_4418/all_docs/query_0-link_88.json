        "text": "A GRANGETOWN boy who scouted for Middlesbrough FC and later became a Member of Parliament has died aged 73 after losing his battle with cancer.\n\nAlan Keen is credited as having discovered Boro legend Graeme Souness during an 18-year stint as a talent scout for the club between 1967 and 1985, having been appointed by then manager Stan Anderson.\n\nAmong those to pay tribute was Boro chairman Steve Gibson, who offered the club’s sincere condolences to his family and friends.\n\n“His passion for the club shone through and we are indebted for all the help he gave us in scouting opponents and potential transfer targets,” said Mr Gibson.\n\nBorn in Lewisham, London, Mr Keen’s family moved to Grangetown when he was a child. He attended Sir William Turner’s Grammar School in Redcar.\n\nAfter serving in the army for three years, he went on to work as a systems analyst and manager in London before running his own business in the fire safety industry - although he retained his links with Teesside through his scouting.\n\nHe entered politics in 1986 as a member of Hounslow Borough Council and became Labour MP for Feltham and Heston in West London in 1992. Mr Keen was chairman of the all-party member groups on football and athletics and was on the Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee.\n\nHe continued to support Boro and took an interest in Teesside matters including the campaign for the statue of Brian Clough which now stands in Albert Park.\n\nMr Keen’s Labour Party colleague, Middlesbrough MP Sir Stuart Bell, said he was a regular at Boro’s Riverside Stadium. Sir Stuart added: “His death at a relatively early age is a great sadness to all his fellow MPs and our heartfelt commiserations go out to his wife Ann.”\n\nMiddlehaven councillor John McPartland, who chaired the Brian Clough Memorial Fund Committee, said: “He was a great supporter of ours and one that I had a lot of time for.”\n\nLabour leader Ed Milliband said: “He was a great believer in the power of sport to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds make the best of their lives.”\n\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he “saluted” Mr Keen’s bravery in facing cancer.\n\nFrank Spraggon, star of Boro teams of the 1960s and 70s, and his wife Linda became friends with Mr and Mrs Keen through Linda’s dad, ex-Boro assistant manager Harold Shepherdson.\n\n“Alan was a lovely man who always kept in close contact with his mum and family on Teesside,” he said.\n\nMr Keen is survived by Ann, two sons and a daughter. Funeral arrangements are yet to be announced."
