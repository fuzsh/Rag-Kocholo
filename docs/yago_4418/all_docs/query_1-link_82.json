She passed on surrounded by her family and close friends on Thursday, November 14, 2002 at the Health Sciences Centre. Jo-Anne will be lovingly remembered and missed by her daughter Tracey and her husband Rene Pelland, her son Tommy Keen and beloved partner Leanne McIvor; grandsons, Brook, Jordie and Dusty. Late in life mom finally found her soul mate, precious friend and partner Debbie Vollett whom she lived with and enjoyed her last moments of life. Jo-Anne had a zest for life and enjoyed it to the fullest. She was always generous, outgoing and loved to laugh and joke around with everyone. When things got tough, so did mom. She always sought out the positive in any situation and kept us all going. Jo-Anne is also survived by her wonderful sisters April LaBerge, Susan Steppler and Patty Seniuk and their families. Jo-Anne especially loved her ABC girls and her rowdy boys! During her youth she admired and had a close bond with her Aunt Thelma, which did not end with her passing. Mom always expressed that God took only the best, I guess she didnt think that she fit into that category but she certainly did. She loved and remembered the gang at Shoppers Drug Mart - you know who you are! Cremation has already taken place as per Moms wishes. Memorial services will be held on Tuesday, November 19 at 1:00 p.m. in Thomson Funeral Chapels, 669 Broadway. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Fibromyalgia Group of Winnipeg at 825 Sherbrook St. Dad, wherever you are we all love and need you. Please come home, please. THOMSON FUNERAL CHAPELS 783-7211\n\nAs published in Winnipeg Free Press on Nov 18, 2002"
