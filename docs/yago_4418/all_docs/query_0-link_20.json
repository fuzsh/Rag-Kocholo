        "text": "Mr Keen said the couple were determined to move in as soon as possible and builders were in the empty home yesterday cleaning up after Friday's party.\n\nOn Friday, the squatters, who moved in two weeks ago in protest over the couple's expenses claims, were given 24 hours to leave by a judge and later held a final gathering.\n\nThe next day the house was free from squatters but it was made a crime scene by police after a 42-year-old woman told officers she was molested during the party. Police sealed off the house and scene of crime officers investigated the claims.\n\nMr Keen, who said the ordeal had been \"very unpleasant\", today said the couple would move back in as soon as building work is complete.\n\nHe said: \"It [the squatters] has made us extremely unhappy but we have to move back into our house. There is the feeling of violation but we have lived there for 22 years and it is our home.\n\n\"We were uncomfotable about the squatters being in there and bringing TV crews into our home but this is our home after all.\n\n\"It was an appalling mess when I saw the house yesterday, my grandson's train set I brought from a charity shop was ruined and had to be thrown away which was horrible.\n\n\"However uncomfortable we may feel about what happened in our home we are determined to get back in as quickly as we can.\"\n\nThe couple, dubbed Mr and Mrs Expenses, claim they were forced to leave their \"main\" Brentford home after a dispute with their builders in October and must live in their second home - a plush Thames waterside flat.\n\nAfter the case on Friday at Brentford County Court, the squatters claimed they had already won after their protest hit local and national headlines, sparking fury among campaign groups and constituents.\n\nNeighbours reported not seeing the Keens at their home for months and some even turned up at court to protest against the Interim Possession Order (IPO).\n\nBut Mr Keen said he has been overwhelmed with support from close friends in Brentford.\n\nHe said: \"People who we have known for years have been very sympathetic to us, sending flowers and support. And our two closest nighbours have been in touch to offer support, along with colleagues and politicians from all parties.\"\n\nA Met Police spokesman confirmed no arrests had been made over the alleged sexual assault and said investigations were continuing."
