        "text": "Allan E. Keen â70 â71MBA â10H, esteemed alumnus and longtime steward of Rollins, has made a $1.5 million bequest commitment to provide scholarships at the College. This future gift will establish three $500,000 endowed scholarships to benefit students in the College of Liberal Arts, the Hamilton Holt School, and the Crummer Graduate School of Business.\n\nThe Allan E. Keen Family Scholarships are the latest commitments of many from Keen, who has a generous history of investing his time and resources in his alma mater. He has been a consistent donor to The Rollins Annual Fund for more than 30 years. Most recently, he made a $1 million commitment to support the building of a new home for the Crummer Graduate School of Business, and he was essential in spearheading fundraising efforts for the commission of A Beautiful Day for a Neighbor, the statue commemorating Rollinsâ most beloved alumnus, Fred Rogers â51 â74H.\n\nâRollins is very near and dear to my heart, and the College has been a major factor in my lifeâs success,â says Keen. âGiving back is something that I, along with my wife, Linda, feel is an important recognition of Rollinsâ impact and role in my life.â\n\nA longtime resident of Winter Park, Keen is chairman and founder of the Keewin Real Property Company. He has been a member of the College's Board of Trustees since 1989, serving as chair from 2006 to 2008 and 2016 to 2019, and is currently the longest-serving member of the board. He received the Distinguished Alumni Award in 1988, the Crummer Hall of Fame Award in 2012, the Rollins Decoration of Honor in 2015, and an honorary degree in 2010.\n\nKeen has also served on the Alumni Reunion Committee, as a Rollins Fund Class Agent, and as National Chairman of The Rollins Annual Fund. Currently, he is serving as National Chairman of Rollinsâ Brighter Together campaign, a historic effort to invest in the people, programs, and places that prepare our graduates to lead meaningful lives and prosper in productive careers."
