This city has not only been her physical birthplace, but the grounds for her spiritual growth and development.

When Elise isn’t in the office she is often discovering obscure Christian artists, spending time at local coffee shops, studying God’s word at a coffee shop, meeting friends at coffee shops, sliding down cardboard hill with her daughter near a coffee shop, and many other things by or near a coffee shop!\n\nMakayla McKibben-Selby\n\nOffice Administrator\n\nadmin@chatthop.org\n\nMakayla has a deep passion for worship and songwriting - especially in the context of the end of the age.

Makayla is currently a worship leader at her home church, and co-producer for Eleventh Hour Worship tunes as well as her solo music. When music isn’t consuming her time, you will find her adventuring outside, teaching end times prophecy, or spending time with family.\n\nJosh Gilbert\n\nUnion Community Coordinator\n\njosh@chatthop.org\n\nWith 15 years of music and ministry experience, Josh Gilbert has served at multiple churches and denominations.
