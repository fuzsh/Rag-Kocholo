        "text": "Labour MP Alan Keen has died at the age of 73 after a battle with cancer, it was announced today.\n\nMP for Feltham and Heston in west London since 1992, Mr Keen was known for his passion for football, having worked as a scout for Middlesbrough before entering politics.\n\nHe made up half of one of Parliament's husband-and-wife teams, with wife Ann serving as Labour's MP for Brentford and Isleworth from 1997 until her defeat in last year's general election and as a health minister from 2007-10.\n\nMr Keen was chairman of the all-party parliamentary groups on football and athletics and a member of the Commons Culture, Media and Sports Committee. He spoke up for grassroots football and fans in Parliament and conducted two inquiries into English football governance.\n\nAs a football scout, he worked under former 'Boro manager Jackie Charlton and claimed credit for helping bring Graeme Souness to the club.\n\nFormer prime minister Gordon Brown led tributes to the long-serving MP, following his death last Thursday.\n\n\"Alan was a great MP locally popular, diligent London MP, and a great fighter for local causes,\" said Mr Brown.\n\n\"As Alan always said, serving the people of all his communities - Heston, Cranford, Hounslow West, Bedfont, Feltham and Hanworth - was his primary duty, supporting all the different and diverse groups in his constituency. He held regular advice surgeries and was assiduous and conscientious at all times in speaking up for local needs.\n\n\"I salute his bravery in facing cancer - fighting it as long as he could - and he will be remembered as someone who taught us how to fight illness.\n\n\"As he acknowledged, the NHS could not have done more to be of help and support.\"\n\nBorn in London, Mr Keen was brought up in the Grangetown and Redcar area of the North East of England, attending Sir William Turners Grammar School in Redcar.\n\nHe served in the British Army for three years before joining the fire protection industry, and later worked for Middlesbrough FC for 18 years.\n\nHe was a member of Hounslow Borough Council from 1986-90 before entering Parliament in 1992. He is survived by wife Ann, two sons and a daughter.\n\nMr Keen had a majority of 4,658 in the 2010 election."
