        "text": "Alan Keen held on to his seat much more comfortably than many were predicting, with a majority of almost 5,000.\n\nThe Labour MP began the night as little as 8/13 on to hold Feltham & Heston, traditionally a Labour stronghold. But Tory rival Mark Bowen barely made a dent in his 6,820 majority, only closing the gap to 4,658.\n\nMr Keen won 21,174 votes, a share of 43.6 per cent, up from 17,741 five years ago. Mr Bowen received 16,516 votes (34.0 per cent), up from 10,921 votes last time.\n\nMr Keen was helped by the boundary changes, which added parts of Heston East, Heston Central and Hounslow West - all strongly Labour areas - to his constituency.\n\nHe could not avoid a dig at his political rivals in his victory speech, accusing Lib Dem opponent Munira Wilson of lying, and claiming he had not been 'allowed' in the Civic Centre for the last four years - a reference to the deep rift between him and the Tory-led council.\n\n\"I'm delighted I can get back to work again helping all the people I've helped over the last 18 years or so,\" he added.\n\nHaving shown up with wife Ann Keen just minutes before the results were announced, he left just as sharply. He refused to answer journalists' questions, a clear sign he remains bitter about the way the expenses scandal was reported.\n\nMr Bowen congratulated Mr Keen but described Feltham & Heston as a 'constituency of two halves', pointing out that he had won all five wards in the western end.\n\n\"Alan and I are both football fans and I was hoping to equalise 1-1 but it's 2-0. Maybe in a few years' time I can pull one back,\" added the Feltham North ward councillor, who is almost certain to retain his seat on the council when the votes are totted up later today.\n\nThe turnout was 60.35 per cent, well up on 2005. But there were nearly 400 spoiled papers, many where confused voters had accidentally put crosses against three candidates for the general as well as local elections."
