He was a great believer in the power of sport to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds make the best of their lives.\n\n“Alan was great friend to me and he will be sorely missed by all.”\n\nLabour MP Gisela Stewart tweeted it was \"very sad news\". Tory MP Louise Mensch also paid tribute to the 73-year-old on Monday morning, tweeting: \"Very, very sad to hear of the death Alan Keen.
