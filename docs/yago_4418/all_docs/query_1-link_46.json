        "text": "Descendants of John Keen Sr.\n\nAnd\n\nA Partial History of the Keen Family and Name.\n\nAmong the pioneer families of Wilcox Co. was the Keen family who lived in sections of Pulaski, Irwin and Dooly Counties that would later become a part of Wilcox County on December 22, 1857. According to authentic records, the family name is found in the Domesday Book ordered by William the Conqueror shortly after the Norman Conquest. The name originally spelled Cahainges, and these ancestors were true followers of William the Conqueror. The earliest record of an authentic descendant is Henry Keen of Wadsworth, Co., Surrey, England. Henry's son John Keen m- Anne Hall in 1623 and they had three sons: Henry Keen; Lord Richard Keen (1628-1653); Edward Keen (1629-1675). These first arrivals in America spelled the name Keyne. Lord Richard Keen of St. Richard's Manor came to Maryland in Feb. 1653, in the company of his older brother Edward. Lord Richard was married to Mary Hopkins. The said John Keen (1657-1723) was the son of Edward Keen (1629-1675). This John Keen was a captain in the Colonial Militia for 13 years and Justice of Dorchester, Md., for 12 years. He m- Mary Hopewell, dau. of Hugh Hopewell, who was also a Justice of Dorchester Co. John Keen moved his family from Calvert Co. to Dorchester Co. Prior to 1704. Later, many of this John Keen's descendents moved on down to Ky., and NC. The said John Keen (1657-1723) was the American progenitor of the family who cast his lot with the colonist of Virginia. Source: St. Johns P.E. Church Register in Hartford Co., Md. and History of Wilcox County Ga. by Mrs. Mary Lou McDonald, PO Box 78, Rochelle, Ga. 31079\n\nIt is an established fact that Elizabeth Keen's husband was a soldier in the American Revolution, for her name is recorded as widow of a Revolutionary soldier living in Laurens County, Georgia, in the \"List of 600 Revolutionary soldiers living in Georgia, 1827-1828.\" compiled by Martha Lou Houston from original records in the National Capital. His service is further established by the fact that Elizabeth Keen drew land in the Cherokee Land Lottery of 1838, as the widow of a Rev. soldier. This land was located in Laurens Co., Dist. 9, section 1, Lot 205. (\"Georgia Roster of the Revolution\" by L. L.

He signed his will on the 12th. day of December, 1803. Note that the information with regard to Young Keen being the son of the elder, John Keen Sr., was given in a signed affidavit by his great grand- daughter, Margie Ann Keen Jackson, who had since died, but this affidavit was made when the History of Laurens County was being written and prepared. The latter, Margie Ann Keen Jackson, was a great aunt of the applicant, and this information was related to members of the family many times before her death. Information given by Deliah Autrey during her lifetime, but now deceased, and she was the daughter of Young Keen, and grandaughter of John Keen.
