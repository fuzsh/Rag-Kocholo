        "text": "MERIDIAN, Miss. (WTOK) -\n\nServices for Mr. Winfred Allen Keen, age 85, were 11 am, Tuesday, July 16, 2024 at Milling Funeral Chapel of Union. Brothers Rusty Walton and Lin Chesney officiated with burial in Memorial Park Cemetery in Louisville, MS. Visitation was 10-11am, Tuesday, prior to the service.\n\nWinfred Allen Keen, born August 6, 1938, to Abel and Lydia Keen, passed away peacefully on July 12, 2024 at his home.\n\nW. A.K., as he often referred to himself, began working as a meat cutter at Jitney Jungle Mart 51 in Jackson, Ms in 1958 alongside his former brother-in-law, Charles Crenshaw. The two of them could cut the best steaks in Hinds County. Following a move to Petal in 1964, he returned home to Union where he opened the Circle – K, he referred to himself as the first to serve fried chicken on a take-out basis in Union. KFC doesn’t hold a candle to his Circle K fried chicken. At some point, the love of logging started and he became known as Bulldog (dictionary definition) “a stubbornly persistent person”! On CB radio land, his handle was “The Brass Bulldog”. Along with his new love of logging came a friendship that he forged with Smith Welch. As he worked for and along with Smith Welch and Charles Winstead, the love of New Years Eve “pig in the ground” cooking started and the best stew recipe was developed. That stew is best cooked in an iron wash pot over an open flame. Even though he didn’t acquire the musical talents of his dad, sister, and nephews, he loved good country music, especially Blue Grass.\n\nHe is survived by his daughter, Beverly Keene (Robert Dickerson), Beverly’s Mother, Martha Poelzl; One Sister, Glenda Massey (Don); Two Step Sons, Kenny Hudson and Mike Hudson; Three Granddaughters, Sandy Robinson (Zach), Kristi Myers (Chris), and Courtney Havens (Michael), Eight Great Grandchildren: Sawyer, Catcher, Preslee, Connor, Carson, Adler, Allen, Kathryn, and Rose; Winfred is also survived by a Sister-In-Law, Barbara Hanna and a Brother-In-Law, Ricky Callaway (Rita).\n\nMr. Keene is preceded in death by his wife of 47 years, Dot; Parents, Abel and Lydia Keen; and two Brothers-in-law: James Hanna and W.C. Callaway.\n\nPallbearers was Michael Ross, JT Rigdon, Randy Skinner, Eddie Massey, Donnie Massey, and Nic Massey.\n\nHonorary Pallbearer was Jeff Winstead.\n\nThe family would like to thank Halycon Hospice; especially Chrissy Baysinger, RN, Randy Miller and Laird Senior Care IOP Cynthia Corbin. Their guidance and compassion over the last 8 weeks was a blessing.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Gideon International or Pine Grove Baptist Church Cemetery Fund (13291 Highway 492 Union, MS 39365).\n\nMilling Funeral Home of Union is in charge of the arrangements."
