        "text": "The Labour MP Alan Keen has died of cancer at the age of 73.\n\nKeen, the MP for Feltham and Heston, in west London, since 1992, was known for his passion for football, having worked as a scout for Middlesbrough before entering politics.\n\nHe was the chairman of the all-party parliamentary groups on football and athletics and a member of the Commons culture, media and Sports committee. He spoke up for grassroots football and football fans in parliament, and conducted two inquiries into English football governance.\n\nKeen is survived by his wife, Ann, a former MP for Brentford and Isleworth, whose defeat at the 2010 general election was blamed on the expenses scandal.The Keens were forced to repay £1,500 after an investigation found they had broken Commons rules in relation to second homes. He also leaves two sons and a daughter.\n\nKeen's death will trigger a byelection, which Labour will be expected to win. He had a majority of 4,658 in the 2010 election.\n\nThe Labour leader, Ed Miliband, paid tribute, saying: \"Alan Keen was a decent, generous man, and his death is a great loss to the House of Commons and the people of Feltham and Heston.\n\n\"Alan was Labour to his core – loyal, passionate about social justice and deeply committed to a fairer society.\n\n\"A dedicated football fan, Alan continued to play for the parliamentary football team until his illness took hold. He was a great believer in the power of sport to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds make the best of their lives.\n\n\"Alan was great friend to me, and he will be sorely missed by all.\"\n\nThe former prime minister Gordon Brown said: \"Alan was a great MP locally popular, a diligent London MP, and a great fighter for local causes.\n\n\"As Alan always said, serving the people of all his communities – Heston, Cranford, Hounslow West, Bedfont, Feltham and Hanworth – was his primary duty, supporting all the different and diverse groups in his constituency. He held regular advice surgeries and was assiduous and conscientious at all times in speaking up for local needs.\n\n\"I salute his bravery in facing cancer – fighting it as long as he could – and he will be remembered as someone who taught us how to fight illness. As he acknowledged, the NHS could not have done more to be of help and support.\"\n\nAs a football scout, Keen worked under the former Middlesbrough manager Jackie Charlton and claimed credit for helping to bring Graeme Souness to the club. He had served in the army for three years before joining the fire protection industry, and worked for Middlesbrough football club for 18 years.\n\nKeen, who was born in London, was a member of Hounslow borough council from 1986 until 1990 before entering parliament.\n\nPoliticians tweeted their condolences after the news of his death was announced on Monday. The Conservative MP Louise Mensch, a fellow member of the culture committee, wrote: \"Very, very sad to hear of the death Alan Keen. He was a colleague on the select committee and always good-humoured.\""
