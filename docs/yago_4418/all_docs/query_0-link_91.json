Not because of the latest revelations about cinema system maintenance, double council tax claiming and cleaning for his second home, but at the claims of his fellow members.\n\nDefending their claim for a Bose Engineer to reconfigure the cinema system in their Westminster apartment, Alan Keen told Hounslow Chroncle, “They [The Telegraph] have twisted the truth to put a different slant on it. That was just a repair to the sound of the TV. We claim for what are the basic necessities.\"\n\nWidely known as the original Mr and Mrs Expenses, Alan Keen claims he has never told a lie in his life. \"The public don't understand the culture of Parliament,\" he said.\n\nDespite calls for him to stand down, Alan Keen said he was going to stand his ground and argued that \"it would be impossible for him to do his work and make the 30 minute commute every day.\"\n\n“Yes of course there's a problem with the system. I have been surprised to say the least at what other people have been claiming but our claims have always been above reproach.”"
