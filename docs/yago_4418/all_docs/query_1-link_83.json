Could they have imagined that their\n\ngreat-grandchildren would have the world at their fingertips, able\n\nto share thoughts and ideas far and wide in just a few keystrokes?\n\nCreate their own custom manufacturing plants via 3D printing?\n\nEradicate polio and other infectious diseases?\n\nIn his book, The Singularity Is Near, author Ray Kurzweil posits\n\nthat the computing power of machines will surpass that of the\n\nhuman intelligence in approximately 2045 at which point those\n\nmachines will then go on to build smarter and smarter machines,\n\nfinally freed from the albatross of human intelligence. Whether\n\nKurzweil has it right or not, time will tell. However, itâs clear that\n\nthe pace of technology is not going to slow, let alone reverse itself.\n\nAs we as a society continue to produce engineers and scientists\n\nwho continue to fuel this technological revolution, we must also\n\neducate social scientists, activists, philosophers and ethicists who\n\ncan critically reflect on the human condition in a world where\n\nmachines may well outthink us, and perhaps replace most of us in\n\nthe fields in which we toil. It is not necessarily a future we should\n\nfully fear nor necessarily fully embrace, but it is a future we\n\nshould seek to intentionally shape.\n\nTherein lies the role for Solebury and like-minded institutions.\n\nWe continue to offer a balance to our students, believing that\n\nEnglish and Painting and Dance are as important as Math and\n\nPhysics and Biology. We believe that rote memorization and\n\njamming content into young minds in service to standardized\n\ntesting outcomes is, at its best, misplaced and misguided. At its\n\nworst, we educate generations of future policy makers whose\n\ndefinition of learning and knowledge is fatally flawed. We\n\nbelieve that curricular experiences like Teach2Serve, Ethics,\n\nBiomedical Ethics and The US and the Arab World are just as\n\ncritical to the developing mind and character of adolescents as\n\nanything labeled Advanced Placement. These categories are not\n\nplaced in opposition to each other, value judgments like good\n\nand bad are not applicable. Rather it is to highlight the choice\n\nof balance, of educating the whole human so she/he is able to\n\nunderstand the critical questions that must be explored: Why?\n\nIs this a good development? What is the moral/ethical dimension\n\nin this moment? It is more critical than ever that we educate\n\nour students to understand that the capacity to achieve some\n\ninvention/advancement/development does not necessarily mean\n\nwe shouldâwe have the responsibility to critically examine\n\nwhether we should pursue this new path.\n\nAnd so, we celebrate 90 years of learning. We look back to the\n\npast to prepare us well for the future, and we embrace change,\n\nnot merely for the sake of change, but when it enhances our\n\nprogress in fulfilling our mission and better serving our various\n\nconstituencies. For example, you may have noticed that this issue\n\nof the Solebury School magazine looks rather different than ones\n\nthat have previously arrived in your mailbox. In this issue, youâll\n\nread about our programs and whatâs happening on campus and\n\nin the lives of Solebury School alum. And youâll see that weâve\n\nupdated our look to reflect the Solebury School of today. We love\n\nto hear your thoughts â please send them our way at magazine@\n\nsolebury.org.\n\nI hope you enjoy this issue of Solebury: The Magazine and\n\ncelebrate with us the persistence of the idea our four founders\n\nhad some 90 years ago, that education can be achieved in an\n\nenvironment that nurtures and respects the student, engendering\n\nin them a passion for learning in a joyful environment.\n\nHead of School\n\nA Note from Tom Wilschutz\n\n2 The Magazine\n\nFor whatever reason, we humans\n\ntend to ascribe landmark status to those\n\nmoments when quintiles and deciles are\n\nattained. So, itâs with a feeling of celebration\n\nand pride that we kick off our 90th year,\n\noffering our unique Solebury School brand\n\nof independent school education.\n\nSummer / Fall 2015\n\nP:05\n\nHow often do you take a good,\n\nlong, hard look in the mirror? For most\n\nof us, self-evaluation happens rarely.\n\nBut at Solebury School, and many other\n\nindependent schools, it happens every\n\n10 years, when the school undertakes a\n\nself-study to earn reaccreditation. The\n\nrigorous year-long process involves\n\nin-depth analysis, introspection and scrutiny. Yet, for Solebury\n\nSchool, going through reaccreditation during the 2014-2015\n\nschool year was viewed as both an obligation and an opportunity.\n\nâSchools are busy, busy places,â said Tom Wilschutz, Solebury\n\nSchoolâs Head of School. âWe would never devote one-and-a-half\n\nyears to a self-examination if it wasnât important. If youâre a good,\n\nhealthy school, you can take advantage of this. Solebury is a good,\n\nhealthy school. The process itself is productive. It brings together\n\na lot of keen minds. We got good input and good insights.â\n\nSolebury Schoolâs reaccreditation process was administered\n\nby the Pennsylvania Association of Independent Schools\n\n(PAIS), a not-for-profit organization offering support\n\nand services to more than 100 independent schools in\n\nPennsylvania and Delaware. To earn reaccreditation, Solebury\n\nSchool spent months preparing documents, reports and data.\n\nThe process culminated in late October 2014 when Solebury\n\nhosted a team of educators from other PAIS independent\n\nschools who held meetings, visited classes, took tours of the\n\ncampus and spent time evaluating, observing and dissecting\n\nnearly every aspect of the school.\n\nHanna Howe, Solebury Schoolâs librarian, served as\n\nthe chairperson of the PAIS steering committee. While\n\nreaccreditation is truly a school-wide effort with faculty, staff\n\nand administrators all doing their part, Howe orchestrated the\n\ncompletion of the necessary documents and helped prepare the\n\nschool for the PAIS visit. She said the process was demanding,\n\nbut also a valuable experience for the school.\n\nâI do think itâs good for the school to have outside eyes look at\n\nour practices and culture,â said Howe. âThe visiting team takes\n\ncare to listen to what we want to be doing and reports back on\n\nwhether we are fulfilling our own mission. They try hard to help\n\nus be the best us, not try to force or expect us to be a school we\n\ndonât want to be. Itâs an interesting and useful exercise to be\n\nasked, âAre you who you want to be?ââ\n\nThis spring, the PAIS visiting committee granted reaccreditation\n\nto Solebury School and delivered a 48-page report that included\n\nboth commendations and recommendations. Wilschutz said he\n\nthought the document was thorough and comprehensive. âI think\n\nthey understood us,â he said.\n\nPAIS praised Solebury School for many of its core values\n\nand philosophies. The visiting committee recognized how\n\nthe school fosters a unique community where students can\n\nconnect with faculty, and where each student feels understood\n\nand appreciated. The schoolâs success in integrating boarding,\n\nday and international students was also noted, along with\n\nthe culture on campus that encourages students to think\n\nindependently and explore their individual interests. PAIS also\n\npraised Solebury for developing faculty and staff members who\n\nare committed to the school and devoted to the students.\n\nThe PAIS report also included some suggestions and ideas\n\nfor the school to consider. Wilschutz said that he, along\n\nwith an administrative team, have already compiled many\n\nof the ideas into an itemized spreadsheet and are currently\n\ndiscussing action plans for some of the items. For example,\n\na team is developing more comprehensive emergency drills\n\nfor unique situations, such as evacuation drills and lockdown\n\ndrills. Another team is considering creating a more uniform\n\nstyle guide for school documents and publications. Others are\n\nworking to broaden the schoolâs community service program,\n\noffering more service learning opportunities for students.\n\nThese discussions that grew directly from the PAIS report are\n\nexactly how an obligation becomes an opportunity. Wilschutz\n\nsaid his goal is to use the report to âkeep looking at best\n\npractices and keep seeking ways to improve Solebury School.â\n\nâIâm really happy with how we organized ourselves and the\n\nprogress weâve made,â said Wilschutz. âThere are clear\n\nroadways on what needs to happen and in what sequence. This\n\nhas all been a good process.â\n\nSolebury School Reaccredited\n\nPAIS Report\n\nwww.solebury.org 3\n\nBeyond the books\n\nSummer / Fall 2015\n\nP:06\n\n4 The Magazine\n\nFreerâs trip was made possible by\n\nthe John and Linda Brown Faculty\n\nEnrichment Award. The award,\n\nestablished by Solebury Schoolâs\n\nHome and School Association, honors\n\nJohn D. Brown â67, Soleburyâs Head\n\nof School from 1989-2008, and Linda\n\nBrown, Director of Advancement from\n\n1989-2008, for their years of service.\n\nThe endowment is designed to allow\n\na Solebury faculty member to pursue\n\na personal interest that sparks their\n\nenthusiasm for education.\n\nFor Freer, who teaches biology,\n\nenvironmental science and evolution,\n\ntraveling to Ecuador and the Galapagos\n\nIslands allowed him to tread on the\n\nlands where Charles Darwin developed\n\nhis theories, explore the diverse biology\n\nof an area known for its flora and fauna,\n\nand view the effects of ecotourism on\n\nprecious natural resources.\n\nâIt was a tremendous trip,â said Freer,\n\nas he scrolled through more than 1,000\n\nphotos and 100 videos from his travels.\n\nâI always talk about Darwin in my\n\nclasses, but to be there and understand\n\nwhat he was seeing was amazing,â said\n\nFreer. âExperiences like that will bring a\n\nlot to my classes.â\n\nFor part of his trip, Freer traveled\n\nwith Global Exploration for Educators\n\nOrganization (GEEO), a non-profit\n\norganization that runs travel programs\n\ndesigned for teachers. Following the\n\nGEEO tour, Freer traveled to Ecuadorâs\n\nremote Sacha Lodge to explore the\n\ndense rainforest. Along the way, he\n\nsaw sea lions, sea turtles, blue-footed\n\nboobies, marine iguanas, monkeys and\n\npenguins. He even swam with six-foot\n\nwhite-tipped reef sharks.\n\nâI knew people did it,â he said. âBut the\n\nfirst time, I was like, Oh, thereâs a shark.\n\nThen, all of a sudden, there were 30\n\nsharks. I was filming underwater, and on\n\nthe video, you can hear me. Iâm thinking,\n\nâStay calm, stay calm,â but Iâm saying,\n\nâHoly cow.ââ\n\nBeyond the books\n\nJon Freer\n\nEarns John and Linda Brown\n\nFaculty Enrichment Award\n\nWhen Jon Freer, Solebury School educational technologist and\n\nscience teacher, returned from his two-week trip to Ecuador\n\nand the Galapagos Islands this summer, he said that his trip\n\nhad no highlights. He quickly elaborated that it was impossible\n\nto pick favorite moments from his trip. Every single moment of\n\nthose 14 days was a highlight.\n\nJon Freer at the center of the earth in Ecuador.\n\nFaculty News\n\nSummer / Fall 2015\n\nP:07\n\nwww.solebury.org 5\n\nDuring his two-week trip, Freer not\n\nonly swam with sharks, but came\n\nface-to-face with a Galapagos tortoise,\n\nvisited the Darwin Research Center,\n\nkayaked, snorkeled, hiked through lava\n\ncaves and learned enough Spanish to\n\nask for directions when he got lost.\n\nFreer said he overcame his nerves in\n\nhis effort to maximize every moment of\n\nhis trip.\n\nâIf we were snorkeling, I was the first\n\nin, the last out,â he said. âIf there was an\n\nopportunity to do something, my answer\n\nwas âyes.â I sometimes lean toward shy\n\nand hesitant. I got over that. I was like,\n\nâThereâs sharks there? Letâs go.ââ\n\nFreer dreams of developing a course\n\nat Solebury School that incorporates\n\neverything he learned on his trip. The\n\ncourse would teach geology, biology,\n\nevolution, the history of Ecuador, basic\n\nSpanish language and would culminate\n\nin a class trip to Ecuador. Yet for now,\n\nhe is compiling his photos and videos\n\ninto lessons that he hopes to share in\n\nhis classroom and with the community.\n\nOverall, Freer seems driven to share\n\nwhat he learned.\n\nâI feel inspired by the love of places\n\nand seeing things,â he said. âThatâs the\n\npassion I can share. Itâs really exciting\n\nto bring the things that excite you as a\n\nteacher. It makes the classroom a more\n\nexciting place to be.â\n\nAnthony Porter\n\nReceives the First\n\nAbove and Beyond Award\n\nSolebury Schoolâs Home and School\n\nAssociation has created an award to recognize\n\nthe extraordinary dedication of Solebury\n\nSchool faculty and staff.\n\nThe Home and School\n\nAbove and Beyond Award\n\nfor faculty and staff was\n\ncreated using a portion of\n\nthe proceeds from the La\n\nDolce Vita: The Sweet Life\n\nannual auction. Each year,\n\na stipend will be awarded to\n\nan individual who has truly\n\nexceeded the expectations\n\nof their position in ways that have enriched the communityâs\n\nexperience.\n\nThis year, Anthony Porter was recognized as the first Above\n\nand Beyond Award recipient. Anthony has been a fixture on\n\nSolebury Schoolâs dining hall staff for the last eight years.\n\nAnyone who walks into the dining hall is met with a smile\n\nand kind word from Anthony. Need a helping hand? Anthony\n\nis the first to offer. In addition to his work in the dining hall,\n\nAnthony also assists with coaching and conditioning the\n\nschoolâs wrestling team. An accomplished musician and\n\nvocalist, Anthony is a frequent contributor to the schoolâs\n\nmusic program. âWhen we thought about the intent of the\n\nHome and School Association to recognize someone in our\n\ncommunity who goes above and beyond, we all immediately\n\nthought of Anthony,â said Tom Wilschutz, Head of School. âHe\n\ntruly epitomizes this award in his approach to every task, every\n\nassignment, everything he does, every single day, at Solebury.\n\nAnthony is the most amazing colleague I think I have ever\n\nworked with in my professional life.â\n\nThe Home and School Above and Beyond Award is available\n\nfor additional contributions.

â15\n\nDarvin Johnson â15\n\nAnastasia Babicki â15 has been a valuable teammate and\n\nsupporter of Solebury athletics since her first year as a seventh\n\ngrader. In total, she has played 15 of the 18 seasons she has been\n\nat Solebury, playing for the field hockey, basketball and lacrosse\n\nteams. Rob Eichem, the Director of Athletics, noted that she\n\nwould ask for more games to be added to the schedule.

Through her dedication and enthusiastic\n\nspirit, she not only earned three varsity letters during her senior\n\nyear, but also most improved in girls basketball and MVP in field\n\nhockey and lacrosse.\n\nSince arriving in the ninth grade, Darvin Johnson â15 has been\n\nunstoppable. Hitting the ground running, literally, he has been a\n\nSpartan since his first trimester on campus. Despite his calm and\n\ncollected attitude, he shows fierce competition on the field; as a\n\nresult, Darvin has earned an impressive collection of accolades.\n\nA four-year letter winner in basketball and two-year in Track and\n\nField, Darvin finished first in the 110m hurdles, 300m hurdles,\n\n200m dash, and was a member of the winning 4x400m relay team\n\nall at the league championships. He also scored the most points for\n\na male athlete in Track and Field this season.

This past\n\nseason, her team set a\n\nseason record of 13-6.\n\nSolebury won overall in\n\nthe Penn-Jersey League\n\nPlayoffs, capturing their\n\nfirst title since 2006. The win marked a perfect 10-0 in league\n\nplay.

A group of\n\nSolebury students with chaperones traveled to Hamburg\n\nduring spring break in March, and in April, Solebury hosted a\n\ngroup of German students here in the United States. While in\n\nGermany, Solebury students explored Hamburg on foot and\n\nby boat, took an excursion to the Baltic Sea and visited the\n\ncities of Berlin and LÃ¼beck.\n\nTOP RIGHT: Erik Daughterman â18 and Claire Maloney â15 visited the\n\nhistoric Holstentor building (the Holsten Gate) in LÃ¼beck.\n\nRIGHT: While in the States, the German exchange students visited\n\nPhiladelphia, stopping for a photo op at the famous LOVE sign.\n\nBOTTOM: Solebury students with their German counterparts at an\n\nice skating rink in Hamburg.\n\nP:21\n\nAdirondack Mountain Adventure\n\nStudents interested in a winter sports adventure took part in an exciting\n\ntrip to the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York.

Itâs so quiet here. The\n\nonly thing I hear is the howl of coyotes in the\n\ndistance. The night air is cool and dry and the\n\nsky is so clear. Iâve never seen so many stars\n\nin my life. I feel very awake right now and\n\nconnected to the universe. I am so thankful for\n\nthis experience.\n\nArizona, the\n\nAmerican Southwest\n\nFifteen students and three chaperones traveled to Arizona\n\nto learn the culture and traditions of the Native American\n\ntribes of the Hopi and Navajo Nations and participate in\n\na community service project. Students had time to hike\n\namong the stunning red rocks and cactus plants of Sedona,\n\nAZ. A visit to the Grand Canyon served as a magical grand\n\nfinale to their experience.\n\nDuring their trip,\n\nstudents documented\n\ntheir experiences in\n\ntheir journals.\n\nHereâs a sampling.\n\nDay 1\n\nWe started the day at the Heard Museumâs\n\nNative American Indian Market and Fair\n\nin Phoenix. Watched the Hopi and Navajo\n\nceremonial dances like the Kachina, hoop and\n\nsnake dance â the dance for rain to grow the\n\ncorn, dance for the harvest, dance to celebrate\n\nlife and rite of passageâ¦ Learned about\n\nthe clothing they wear for different dances\n\nand how they made them and what they\n\nrepresented. Ended our first day in Sedona just\n\nin time for a sunset hike to the top of a vortex.\n\nItâs so surreal here â the cactus, the red rocks,\n\nlike being on a different planet. My soul is\n\ncontent. I love learning about Native American\n\nculture through the experience and not from\n\na book. Tired, time to sleep. Hiking in the\n\nmorning then off to the Hopi. Must remember\n\nto THANK Mom and Dad for letting me go.\n\nSummer / Fall 2015\n\nP:23\n\nDay 3\n\nOur Hopi guide, Ed, took us to the First Mesa today, a village\n\non top of a plateau. You can see for hundreds of miles in all\n\ndirections. Ed says that the Hopi people are known for longdistance running, as itâs about 30 miles away to the next village.\n\nEd got special permission from the Tribal elders to take us to\n\nthe Kachina house, a very sacred place where the Kachina\n\nspirits live during the ceremonies. I feel honored to have a\n\nglimpse into their world.\n\nDay 4\n\nSome of the Hopi women taught us how to make fry bread with\n\nthem for tonightâs dinner. We prepared and cooked the flat\n\nbread outside. We took dough the size of ping pong balls and\n\npinched it into discs and then slapped it quickly between the\n\npalms of our hands to flatten it. I accidently dropped one in the\n\ndirt, oops! I threw it over the fence for the rez dogs to eat, they\n\nare so thin. In Hopi tradition, the woman serve the men first. Itâs\n\ntheir way to thank the men for their work the fields all day. Fred,\n\nJared and Jack are really liking this as they get to eat first.\n\nDay 5\n\nArrived at the Grand Canyon! Iâve always dreamed of coming\n\nhere and now I am HERE. We watched the sunset at the south\n\nrim. Itâs incredible! Every moment the sun drops in the western\n\nsky, the canyon changes colors.
