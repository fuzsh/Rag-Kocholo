        "text": "Mr and Mrs Keen were given a “lenient” punishment after findings against them by John Lyon, the parliamentary standards commissioner, were watered down by MPs.\n\nMr Lyon said the Keens committed a “serious breach” of Commons rules by claiming second home allowances while effectively only having one home.\n\nYet the Standards and Privileges Committee, which decides MPs’ punishments, said the couple deserved sympathy because Commons officials permitted the claims.\n\nIts decision was described as “appalling” by Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee on standards in public life. He suggested it further undermined the right of MPs to police their own conduct.\n\nMPs are allowed to claim £24,000 a year to cover the cost of running a second home that they need to work in both Westminster and their constituencies.\n\nUntil April this includes those in outer London, such as Mr Keen, MP for Feltham & Heston, and Mrs Keen, MP for Brentford & Isleworth and a junior health minister.\n\nIn all they have claimed about £250,000 in public funds to cover mortgage interest payments and other living costs since buying the flat in May 2002.\n\nThey said the building work then did not go “according to plan” and that in December 2008 they boarded up the house.\n\nThey admitted they did not stay there again until October 2009, by which time the local council had asked why the house was empty and squatters had held raves and sprayed graffiti.\n\nYet they continued to claim second home allowances for the London flat, receiving about £45,000 between the building work beginning and their return.\n\nHe said the fact officials allowed the claims was a “mitigating factor” but concluded: “Members are responsible for their own actions and I consider that both Members were equally responsible for what I regard as a serious misjudgement.\n\nHe said they should not have claimed allowances for the 10 months in which the property was uninhabitable, when they received a \"personal financial benefit\" from their expenses arrangements\n\nHowever the Standards and Privileges Committee said: “While we would normally agree with the Commissioner on the seriousness of a misjudgment of this kind, in the exceptional circumstances of this case we take a more lenient view.”\n\nIt said that the Keens, who have already repaid £2,644, should repay another £1,500.\n\nSir Alistair last night said: “John Lyon’s conclusion was not radical. I think it is appalling the committee has not followed it through.\n\n“Why have an independent investigator who has carefully considered the evidence if his view is not backed by the main disciplinary committee in the Commons?”"
