        "text": "Ann Keen (born 1948) is a Labour politician. She was member of Parliament for for Brentford and Isleworth from 1997 to 2010. Her husband, Alan Keen, was also an MP from 1992 to his death in 2011.\n\nIn 1995 Ann Keen was reunited with her gay son Mark Lloyd-Fox, whom she had given up for adoption thirty years before.[1]\n\nIn 1998 she proposed an amendment to the Crime and Disorder Bill 1998 which would have equalised the age of consent at 16 (17 in Northern Ireland). This was approved by the House of Commons, but rejected by the House of Lords. For her work on the bill she received a Brian Kennedy Award.\n\nReferences"
