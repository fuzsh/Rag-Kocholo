        "text": "He worked under Jackie Charlton and is credited with bringing Graeme Souness to the club.\n\nHe made up half of one of Parliament’s married teams, with wife Ann serving as Labour’s MP for Brentford and Isleworth from 1997 until her defeat in last year’s general election and as a health minister from 2007-10.\n\nKeen was chairman of the parliamentary groups on football and athletics and a member of the Commons culture, media and sports committee.\n\nHe spoke up for football and fans in Parliament and conducted two inquiries into football governance.\n\nBorn in London, he was brought up in north-east England and attended Sir William Turner’s Grammar School in Redcar.\n\nKeen served in the Army and then joined the fire protection industry. He was a councillor in Hounslow from 1986 to 1990.\n\nAlthough he made himself unpopular with his constituents when he changed his mind about the necessity of a third runway at Heathrow (the project was widely opposed by local residents and has since been abandoned), it was the parliamentary expenses scandal which threatened his political career.\n\nTwo years ago Keen and his wife were dubbed “Mr and Mrs Expenses” by the press after claiming almost £1.7million in expenses over seven years. They were ordered to repay money they had claimed for a second home while their house in Brentford was boarded up and under renovation.\n\nKeen was re-elected as MP for Feltham and Heston though his wife didn’t fare as well and lost her Brentford and Isleworth seat."
