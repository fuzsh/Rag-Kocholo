Does she earn a living from this?\n\nMr Davies: She is a journalist. She is a specialist in freedom of information. I think she is actually British and she worked in America and used their Freedom of Information Act, came back to this country just as ours was about to come into force so wrote a book which is a guide.\n\nQ486 Alan Keen: I have seen her being interviewed.\n\nMr Davies: You are wondering whether she has some vested interest.\n\nQ487 Alan Keen: Yes, because I have seen her on television being interviewed.\n\nMr Greenslade: I know her quite well. She teaches the students at City. She is a single interest journalist in the old tradition of having one niche interest and following it to its logical conclusion. She lives, in monetary terms, on the margins."
