        "text": "In Memory of\n\nReuben “Owen” Keen\n\nSeptember 10, 1937 - December 13, 2020\n\nReuben Owen Keen, age 83, died Sunday December 13, 2020 at the Medical Center in Bowling Green, Ky.\n\nThe Allen County native was the son of the late Jasper Owen Keen and Flora Brown Holland McGuffey. Also preceding him in death was his brother Bruce Edward Keen, sister Mary Elizabeth Scott and two brother-in-laws, Floyd Tyree and John Scott.\n\nOwen had a great love for his family and took pride in telling everyone about them. He shared that same love with his Beech Grove General Baptist Church family.\n\nHe enjoyed traveling, whether it be a one-day drive, or his trip of a lifetime; a cruise to Alaska with his wife, that they took just last year. For those lucky enough to know Owen, it wasn’t hard to see and feel his deep love for God. Preaching whenever he was called to at Beech Grove was among his deepest passions.\n\nOwen loved driving his golf cart past the front of his daughter’s house and seeing his precious great-grandkids smiling, waving their hands and yelling ‘Hi Papa!’ from the porch. While that may seem such a small thing, it wasn't to Owen, those little moments meant everything to him. His wife Edna, the love of his life, meant the world to him. Whether it was through small favors, or big surprises, he loved making her happy.\n\nThough he was a jack of all trades and had many jobs over his lifetime, he spent the past decade building a business with his son and daughter. His daily presence will be greatly missed by them both as he provided great advice and wisdom.\n\nOwen will be forever loved and missed by all those that knew him. With all the little moments of love, joy and happiness he left in our hearts, he will never be forgotten.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Edna McFarland Keen, his son Michael Keen, his daughter Ginger Partridge (Frank) all of Scottsville, his sisters Bertha Tyree and Jacqueline Ann Keen both of Indiana, three grandchildren, Andrew Keen (Paige), Matthew Partridge and Lindsay Partridge, four great grandchildren Isabella, Nolan, Donovan and Rebel Faye.\n\nVisitation will be from 5:00 to 8:00 PM Wednesday, December 16, 2020 at the T. W. Crow & Son Funeral Home.\n\nFuneral Services will be Thursday at 1:00 PM December 17, 2020 at the Beech Grove General Baptist Church with burial in the church cemetery.\n\nMemorial donations may be made to the Beech Grove General Baptist Church."
