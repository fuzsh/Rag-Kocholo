        "text": "The optical profession has congratulated Ann Keen MP on her appointment as under secretary of state to health secretary Alan Johnson with a remit for ophthalmic services.\n\nIn a joint letter, FODO, ABDO, the GOC and the AOP welcomed Keen to her position and emphasised the positive relationship the profession had enjoyed with her predecessor, Rosie Winterton. They expressed their intention to continue working in partnership in the future.\n\nFODO chief executive David Hewlett said: 'The optical sector provides services unrivalled in terms of quality, access and choice and we have a highly trained workforce that is ready and able to take on a far greater proportion of shared care in the community.'\n\nHewlett added that the optical bodies had included a copy of the proposals submitted last year for the GOS review.\n\nThe profession also invited Keen to attend the National Optometric Conference near Kenilworth in October.\n\n'We suggested that when Keen had settled in it would be nice to have a meeting,' Hewlett said.\n\nKeen, a former nurse, has represented Brentford and Isleworth since 1997 and was previously Parliamentary private secretary to Gordon Brown when he was chancellor."
