We claim for what are the basic necessities.\"\n\n\"The public don't understand the culture of Parliament,\" he added claiming that it would be “impossible to work and make the 30 minute commute every day.\"\n\n“Yes of course there's a problem with the system. I have been surprised to say the least at what other people have been claiming but our claims have always been above reproach.”\n\nIn contrast Steve Curran claims that Ann Keen “accepts that the current system is not acceptable.”\n\nHe added, “We should not forget the outstanding contribution Ann continues to make for the people of Brentford and Isleworth and the borough of Hounslow as a whole, both as a constituency MP dealing with literally thousands of requests for support and as a Health Minister.”"
