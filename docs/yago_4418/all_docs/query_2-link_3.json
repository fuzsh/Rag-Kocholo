        "text": "**In Loving Memory of April Colkmire-Keen**\n\nApril Colkmire-Keen, a radiant soul whose light touched everyone she encountered, passed away peacefully on July 29, 2024, in Chattanooga, TN. She was 38 years old. April's life was a beautiful testament to grace, love, and unwavering strength, and her memory will forever be cherished by those who had the privilege of knowing her.\n\nA devoted Christian, April lived her faith through every action and interaction. Her spiritual beliefs were reflected in the kindness and compassion she extended to all, and her life was a constant expression of her deep connection to her faith.\n\nApril's talents and passions were as multifaceted as her character. She was a gifted artist, her paintings capturing the essence of her vibrant spirit and the depth of her emotional landscape. Each brushstroke was a reflection of her boundless creativity and the love she poured into her craft. Her art was not just a hobby but a profound way she communicated her inner beauty and insight.\n\nProfessionally, April was a remarkable counselor and therapist. Her career was marked by her dedication to helping others navigate their challenges and find healing. Her wisdom, empathy, and insightful approach made her a beacon of hope for many, and her clients found in her a compassionate confidante and a guiding light. Her colleagues and friends admired her for her driven nature and the remarkable success she achieved in her field. April's sense of humor was another of her many gifts; it was an endearing quality that allowed her to connect with others on a deep and meaningful level. Her laughter and wit could brighten the darkest days and bring joy to all who were fortunate enough to experience them.\n\nApril was also an incredible wife and mother. She leaves behind her beloved husband, Alan Keen, who was her rock and a constant source of support. Together, they created a life full of love and happiness. April is survived by their cherished children, Ellsie and Elin Keen, who were the light of her life and whom she loved with a fierce and tender heart. April's devotion to her family was unwavering, and her presence in their lives was a source of immense joy and inspiration.\n\nIn addition to her immediate family, April is survived by her parents, Lance and Sharon Colkmire, of Cleveland, TN, and her sister, Allison Plummer. Her family was her greatest treasure, and the bonds they shared were deeply meaningful. The love and support they provided each other were a testament to the close-knit family that April cherished.\n\nA memorial gathering to celebrate April's life will be held in Cleveland, TN. The Service will be held at South Cleveland Church of God on Saturday August 3rd 2024. The visitation will begin at 1 PM with the service to follow at 2 PM.\n\nCompanion Funeral and Cremation Service, Chattanooga Chapel has been entrusted with compassionate care and support of the family during this difficult time.\n\nApril Colkmire-Keen's legacy of love, creativity, and compassion will continue to live on in the hearts of all who knew her. Her life was a shining example of how to live with purpose and grace, and her memory will forever be a source of inspiration and comfort. Though she is no longer with us, the impact of her life will remain a guiding light for those who love her.\n\nRest in peace, April. Your spirit, artistry, and loving presence will be deeply missed and fondly remembered."
