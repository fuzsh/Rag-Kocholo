        "text": "Writ issued over letters in Brentford, Chiswick and Isleworth Times\n\nRelated Links\n\nBrentford and Isleworth Constituency Guide\n\nWoods Cartoon on the Brentford and Isleworth Election Result\n\nLocal election battle could end in courts\n\nAnn Keen Joins The Stars to \"Make Poverty History\"\n\nLocal MP Ann Keen and her husband Alan are reportedly suing the publishers of the Brentford, Chiswick and Isleworth Times over two letters that appeared in the newspaper.\n\nAn item in the Press Gazette says that the Keens considered the content of the letters defamatory and they allege that the newspaper did not do enough to establish the facts of the cases involved.\n\nAccording to a High Court writ, the first letter suggested the MPs had threatened local councillors with expulsion if they did not toe the line dictated by the Keens. The Keens also say that a letter sent in 2002 falsely accused them of improperly preventing councillors standing for election, supporting their favoured councillors in corrupt activities and subverting local democracy.\n\nThey are also claiming that a second letter was defamatory. This appeared in the paper last September and allegedly implied Mrs Keen had failed for three-and-a-half years to take action to help three families that had written to her asking for assistance with problems they were having in relation to the residential care of elderly relatives.\n\nThe Keens say that they had received no substantive response to their complaints from the Newsquest group and were therefore forced to proceed with legal action.\n\nAnn Keen was re-elected for the second time at this year's election to represent the Brentford and Isleworth constituency. Her husband Alan represents Feltham and Heston which is the other constituency within the borough of Hounslow."
