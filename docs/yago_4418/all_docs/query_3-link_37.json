        "text": "Alan Smolowe died in January, less than 2 days after suffering a massive stroke. The 1971 Staples High School graduate was 69.\n\nHis sister Jill Smolowe — a 1973 Staples grad, and the author of “Four Funerals and a Wedding: Resilience in a Time of Grief” — wrote movingly about his life and death, and their long relationship as siblings, for the Next Avenue website. She wrote:\n\nI’ve buried a lot of loved ones — too many loved ones. It’s never easy. But I’ll say this about loss: each time, it teaches me something new about grief.\n\nMy first husband, Joe, died in 2009, two years after a leukemia diagnosis. My baby sister, Ann, died in 2010, two years after a colon cancer diagnosis. My mother went 18 days after Ann, and my father in 2018, both of them essentially of old age. All four losses left me bereft and hollowed out, but the numbness owed nothing to shock. In each case, it had been clear for a while that there might not be a happy outcome.\n\nEarlier this year, I lost my older brother Alan just 44 hours after he suffered a stroke. He was 69, an age our kids and grandchildren might think old, but you and I know is not. He was with us. Then, he was not. His sudden disappearance feels shocking for me and my younger brother, Jonathan. So does the fact that our tight-knit band of four siblings is now two.\n\nYet the fact of Alan’s death has not left me bereft and hollowed out. This time round, my sadness is eased by relief, gratitude and a tide of happy memories that make me smile. Let me explain.\n\nAlan, my senior by 19 months, was a role model of a big brother. Always supportive, encouraging and proud of his three sibs, he was never competitive with us. That he had lady-slaying good looks and was a graceful, natural athlete never stirred envy in Jonathan, Ann or me. He never lorded any of that over us. My parents refused to play favorites. And Alan’s raunchy humor shielded us from feeling like he was the heir and we the spares.\n\nAfter careers in marketing and real estate, he changed course, getting two doctorates in education. He then co-founded three charter schools for children with learning disabilities. The students adored him. So did his wife and son. His life was good.\n\nThen Alan’s body turned against him. Hobbled by immune deficiencies and arthritis, he spent the last 13 years of his life battling daily acute pain that disrupted his sleep, added weight to his once-slender body and left him unable to participate in any of the sports he loved. While his mind remained active, his body gradually closed the doors on his once-active life until he became essentially a shut-in.\n\nSo, relief? Yes, I and other loved ones, too, are relieved that Alan is no longer in pain. Though he never complained, it was clear that he was suffering every hour of every day.\n\nAs for gratitude, I am oh, so thankful that Alan and I parted on loving terms that have left me filled with happy memories of him. It could have been different. There could have been a lot of regret.\n\nIn recent years as political differences hardened across the country, tearing apart many families, the red-blue divide between Alan and me, hitherto quiet and largely unaddressed, deepened.\n\nThings grew more tense during COVID when Alan refused to get vaccinated. Knowing that his own immune system would not weather COVID well, Alan stayed at home, so he never put others at risk. But our divergent views put our relationship at risk.\n\nNo longer able to listen to one another, we drifted further and further apart. The humor that had been a hallmark of our relationship evaporated. The little surprise gifts we mailed each other stopped. The frequency of our phone calls, emails and texts diminished. I knew less and less about his life; he knew less and less about mine.\n\nIt was a stroke of luck that three weeks before Alan’s sudden death, I texted him the name of a movie I thought he and his wife, Lou Anna, might enjoy. He responded with the name of a TV series he thought my husband and I would like. Bob and I binge-watched it and a week later I phoned Alan to thank him for the recommendation. The tenor of the call was friendly, not tense, so when he asked how I was, I filled him in. There was a lot.\n\nAlan hadn’t known that for many months Bob has been battling acute pain, following what we’d hoped would be a pain-relieving back surgery. He hadn’t known that Bob’s adult son was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and was now often staying with us while he deals with chemo and intolerable pain. Alan hadn’t known that I was back in a worried, caregiving mindset, with little relief in sight.\n\nI could feel Alan’s empathy as he encouraged me to make travel plans with friends and do the things I enjoy (as he’d encouraged Lou Anna these last 13 years). In his repeated murmur of, “I didn’t know,” I could hear how much he wished I’d told him sooner so he could be there for me. I could feel his love and concern each time he said, “Oh, Meus,” our mutual nickname for each other.\n\nOver the next 2 weeks, Alan made his caring presence felt. He called to check up on me. He sent inspirational short videos. He emailed single-frame comics, and movie and TV suggestions. I found myself thinking, I am so glad that my brother is back in my life.\n\nThen, he disappeared again, this time forever.\n\nSad as that is, my feelings of gratitude have only strengthened since Alan’s abrupt departure. I am grateful that Lou Anna held the phone to his ear in his final hours (induced coma be damned) so that I could tell Alan how fortunate I’ve been to have him for my big brother. I am grateful that our final communications were loving and caring.\n\nAnd I am especially grateful that Alan and I had a good goodbye. Instead of being left to wallow in regret, I am basking in affectionate memories of my big bro (many of them too raunchy to share).\n\nAlan would hate that I’m saying this, but he really was a prince of a brother.\n\n====================================================\n\nHere is Alan Smolowe’s obituary, as submitted by his family:\n\nIn his younger years he dominated on the tennis court, and drew whistle calls as he wedeled his way down the fault lines of black-diamond ski trails. In his middle years he founded real estate companies and charter schools for students with learning disabilities. And in his later years he devoted himself to caring for his wife, son and parents.\n\nAll along that trajectory, Alan Smolowe delighted family, friends and colleagues with his keen intellect and wicked sense of humor.\n\nOn January 22, Smolowe died at Novant Forsyth Hospital in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, following a massive stroke. He was 69.\n\n“Alan was that rarest of older brothers, always supportive, never competitive,” said his sister Jill Smolowe. “He radiated kindness and compassion.”\n\nBorn in 1953, Smolowe grew up in Westport, the oldest of 4 siblings. At Staples High School he was a standout athlete on the soccer field, the ski slope and the tennis court. During summers he taught tennis to students that included Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford. “Alan was a natural athlete,” said his brother Jonathan. “He was a dominant tennis player, graceful skier and always a pleasure to watch.”\n\nAfter graduating from Lehigh University with a BA and an MBA, Smolowe embarked on a marketing career that included brand management for Playtex, Nestle and Jeno’s, for which he relocated to Florida.\n\nThe move ignited his interest in commercial real estate, leading in 1984 to his co-founding of Greater Florida Development, a business emphasizing on strip shopping center development. Two years later he founded the Rothschild Development Corporation, which combined his marketing and real estate talents to provide clients with marketing, business and strategic plans.\n\nA decade later, Smolowe’s insatiable curiosity propelled him into education. In 1998 he received a Ph.D. from the University of Orlando, followed two years later by an Ed.D. in educational leadership from Barry University.\n\nHis accomplishments included the co-founding of Summit Charter Schools, which opened Florida schools over 12 years, dedicated to serving elementary and middle school students who struggled with learning challenges.\n\nDeborah Romano, an education colleague, once described his efforts as “intelligent, imaginative, creative and caring,” and called Smolowe “that one role model that students crave, that one person who cares enough to make a difference.”\n\nIn his later years, despite battling chronic pain caused by arthritis and immune deficiencies, Smolowe relocated with his wife Lou Anna and his son Louis to Clemmons, North Carolina, to care for his aging parents. His father, Richard, died in 2018; his mother, Greta, in 2010. That same year, he also lost his sister Ann to colon cancer.\n\nSmolowe is survived by Lou Anna, his wife of 24 years; son Louis, a senior at the University of North Carolina; sister Jill of Little Falls, New Jersey, brother Jonathan of Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, and 6 nieces and nephews."
