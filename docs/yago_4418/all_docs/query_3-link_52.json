        "text": "Since joining GradGuard - College Life Protected one of my main priorities over time was to create an organizational alignment within the department I oversee that makes sense. At times as leaders we feel we can wear every hat...but that doesn't mean we can do it consistently and or successfully at all times. It's about recognizing where you need the most support to benefit everyone around you. Development has always been at the forefront of my objective with being a leader. I challenge myself to find the inner talent in all my direct reports even at times where they might not see the potential themselves. Positions in an organization sometimes are created because of the skillset that one brings - that is why I believe developmental opportunities are crucial within every area of business. Although it can be challenging to ask someone to pick up a responsibility they aren't being paid for, it allows time to see is the position you have in mind realistic, have enough bandwidth and or do you have the right people? And if all the above is true the payoff for that employee can be worth it. Well, I am fortunate to say after months of review the following team members have been promoted to first time positions within the Membership Experience Team. Emily Bruchmiller Membership Experience Team Lead Victoria Tanton Membership Experience Analyst Nyeedra BlackElk Noel Sr. Membership Experience Specialist I couldn't be prouder as a leader to witness and be a part of the development and growth these individuals established over the course of time I have been here. But not only is this a testament to their talent, but it opens a window for anyone after them that shows membership experience has levels and advanced roles that are achievable and allows them to stay in a space they love. Because like me when you ask yourself \"what's in it for me?\" the answer will always be my people and the customer."
