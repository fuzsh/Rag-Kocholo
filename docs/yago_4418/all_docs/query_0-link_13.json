        "text": "Template:Infobox MP David Alan Keen (born 25 November 1937, Lewisham, London) is a politician in the United Kingdom. He is Labour and Co-operative member of Parliament for Feltham and Heston.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nAlthough born in London, Alan Keen was brought up in the Grangetown and Redcar area of the north east of England. He went to Sir William Turners Grammar School (now the Connections campus of Redcar & Cleveland College) on Coatham Road in Coatham, Redcar - in the same school year as Paul Daniels. He joined the British Army in 1960 and after nearly three years of service, in 1963, he started his career with the Fire Protection Industry where he remained until his election to the House of Commons. He also worked as a tactical scout for Middlesbrough F.C. for eighteen years.\n\nParliamentary career[]\n\nHe served as a member of Hounslow Borough Council from 1986-90 and was elected to Parliament at the 1992 General Election when he unseated the sitting Conservative MP Patrick Ground. In Parliament he has served on both the Education (1995-96) and the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committees (1997-99 and since 2001).\n\nExpenses claims[]\n\nMr and Mrs Keen bought an apartment using their combined second homes allowance within Parliamentary rules. The couple bought the flat in May 2002 after spending six months in a London hotel, using two mortgages: one loan was for £350,000 from HSBC; the second loan was raised by re-mortgaging their property in Brentford, also through HSBC. The couple never submitted a single receipt, instead sending copies of their bank statements to the expenses department every month showing the payment of council tax, claiming £1,643.50 each month throughout 2002-03 and £1,699 each throughout 2003-04.\n\nThere are no allegations that Mr Keen broke any laws.
