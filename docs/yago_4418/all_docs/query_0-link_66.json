        "text": "Grace Ann Keen\n\nJul 10, 2001 -\n\nMar 18, 2021\n\nGrace Ann Keen, age 19, of Anchorage, Alaska, passed away unexpectedly on March 18, 2021, in Indianapolis, Ind. She was born in Palmer, Alaska, on July 10, 2001, to James Alan and Mary Catherine (Reuter) Keen. A 2019 graduate of the Family Partnership Charter School, Grace was working toward a degree in exercise science from Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, Mo. She planned to apply to physical therapy programs in the fall.\n\nGrace was saved at a young age and baptized into the membership of The Anchor Missionary Baptist Church in Anchorage, where she was a faithful member for many years. As her Christian walk deepened, she used her passions for music and teaching to help grow the church's musical worship. A piano player since kindergarten, she was currently teaching 12 beloved students. Grace's talents did not end with music, however. She was an accomplished athlete, swimming competitively at the state level. She did all this while prioritizing the highest of academic standards. Whatever Grace did, she did with all of her soul, mind and strength.\n\nAt the time of her passing, Grace was a member of Calvary Missionary Baptist Church in Bolivar. She continued there as before, forming friendships, encouraging others and using her gifts as only she could. She lived out the adage, \"Bloom where God plants you.\" Her commitment to excellence was surpassed only by her unparalleled love for those around her, wherever she may be.\n\nGrace is survived by her parents, James and Mary Keen; siblings, Josiah, Micah and Anna Keen; paternal grandparents, John and Barbara Keen; fiance, Aidan Welch; and several aunts, uncles and cousins; and a great-grandmother. She was preceded in death by her maternal grandparents, Robert and Ann Reuter.\n\nVisitation will be held on Tuesday, March 23, 2021, from 11 a.m. until 1 p.m. at Brandywine Community Church, 1551 E. New Rd., Greenfield, IN 46140. A funeral service will be held immediately following the visitation, beginning at 1 p.m. Pastor Michael Calhoun will be officiating.\n\nGrace's family invites you to watch a live stream of her funeral via the Zoom link in her obituary at www.erleweinmortuary.com."
