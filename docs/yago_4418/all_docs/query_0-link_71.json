        "text": "The Labour MP, Alan Keen, has died after a battle with cancer, it was been announced on Monday.\n\nThe 73-year-old MP for Feltham in west London was known for his passion for football, having acted as a scout for Middlesbrough before entering politics.\n\nHis wife Ann served as Labour's MP for Brentford and Isleworth from 1997 until her defeat in last year's general election and as a health minister from 2007-10.\n\nResponding to the news, Ed Miliband described Alan Keen as a \"decent, generous man\" adding his death is a great loss.\n\n“Alan Keen was a decent, generous man and his death is a great loss to the House of Commons and the people of Feltham and Heston.\n\n“Alan was Labour to his core – loyal, passionate about social justice and deeply committed to a fairer society.\n\n“A dedicated football fan, Alan continued to play for the parliamentary football team until his illness took hold. He was a great believer in the power of sport to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds make the best of their lives.\n\n“Alan was great friend to me and he will be sorely missed by all.”\n\nMr Keen was chairman of the all-party parliamentary groups on football and athletics and a member of the Commons Culture, Media and Sports Committee. He spoke up for grassroots football and fans in Parliament and conducted two inquiries into English football governance.\n\nMeanwhile, former Prime Minister, Gordon Brown said: \"Alan was a great MP locally popular, diligent London MP, and a great fighter for local causes.\"\n\n(DW)"
