Lisa was born in Red Bud to Erdman and Carol Esker.\n\nAfter graduating from Putnam County High School she married Jim Keen on Sept. 15, 1984. She worked most of her life at Hobbs in Spring Valley and as a housekeeper.\n\nShe was an unforgettable person who had an unforgettable laugh and smile to match. She never paid full price and was always looking for the deal of the day at garage sales or Goodwill. She loved to play the slot machines and watch every Cardinals game and would continue to watch even when they were losing, just knowing the would come from behind and win.\n\nShe loved her family and friends more than anything. She had the biggest heart and would do anything for anyone; her house is a home to many.\n\nShe is survived by her mother Carol Esker; husband Jim; children James, Chelsea and Clay Keen; along with several aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces and cousins.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her father Erdman Esker; brother Kevin Esker; and sister Sherry Siegmann.\n\nFuneral services were held Oct. 15 at Helmer Shields Funeral Home, Granville. Pastor Mike Slutz officiated.\n\nShe was laid to rest in Granville Cemetery.\n\nPallbearers were Daniel Siegmann, Jesse Siegmann, John Esker, Keith Smoode, Scott Kierski and Scott Zemanek."
