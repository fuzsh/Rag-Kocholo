        "text": "More than 40 people turned up to watch comics Mark Thomas, Wil Hodgson and Atilla the Stockbroker perform for refugee charities.\n\nSquatter Joe said the evening went well and there are plans for more events at the MPs' \"main home\".\n\nSince the group moved in a week ago they claim to have had \"overwhelming\" support from neighbours.\n\nMr and Mrs Keen claim a dispute with builders is forcing them to live at their £750,000 second home on the River Thames and pledged to move back to their constituency home in two months - but the squatters claim the home is fine to live in and think the Keens should have done something worthwhile with the empty pad.\n\nA statement, released last week on behalf of the couple, said: “We have lived in our house in Brentford for more than 22 years. We own the house and all mortgage payments and building work etc have always been paid by us personally. It is our home and has been very special to us for a long time.\n\n\"Alan started work on the Great West Road, Brentford, in 1963 and Ann, as a nurse, has spent a substantial part of her working life at West Middlesex Hospital. Long before Ann was elected to Parliament in 1997, first as a nurse and then as a nurse and prospective parliamentary candidate our door has always been open for people to ask for help.\n\n\"We find it extremely upsetting to know that our house is occupied by squatters who appear to believe that they are entitled to do what they wish in our property.\n\n\"Anyone who has experienced the feeling of violation on being burgled will understand the distress caused by intruders who refuse to leave. Obviously, we are working to resolve the situation and get our house back as quickly as possible.”\n\nThe Keens said they have contacted a solicitor."
