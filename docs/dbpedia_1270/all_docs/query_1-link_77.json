        "text": "2019 - 2022\n\nDECRA. Regime shifts from kelp forest to turfs: drivers, resilience and future.\n\nThis project is a Discovery Early Career Research Award funded by the Australian Research Council. Globally, marine ecosystems are increasingly pushed beyond critical thresholds of collapse, creating an urgent need to understand the drivers of sudden shifts in marine habitats and develop effective strategies to curb their loss. This DECRA will apply a comparative experimental and analytical approach to quantify linkages among multiple stressors driving kelp forest loss and expansion across three continents. Field and laboratory experiments will be used to develop and test ‘green gravel’, a novel restoration tool that aims to overcome reinforcing feedbacks (lack spores and hard substrate) preventing recovery of kelp forests. Findings will help identify solutions to address loss of kelp forests in Australia and globally.\n\nRole: Chief Investigator\n\n2019 - 2022\n\nTurf Wars: fighting the new battle facing blue forests.\n\nThis ARC Discovery project is led by Professor Thomas Wernberg with Dr. Melinda Coleman. Habitat loss is a leading threat to goods and services from the oceans. Globally, kelp forests are collapsing and being replaced by persistent unwanted algal ‘turfs’. Our understanding of this habitat shift is rudimentary, and solutions to mitigate the impacts virtually non-existent. This project will use ecological models and field experiments to uncover drivers and critical thresholds for turf expansion. Through stress experiments andgenomic analyses, it aims to discover resilient kelps that promote forest persistence under stress. By expanding our understanding of critical habitat transitions, and exploring new solutions, this project aims to enhance our capacity to respond to the ongoing degradation of Australia’s Great Southern Reef.\n\nRole: Project Investigator, Chief Investigator: Prof. Thomas Wernberg\n\nwernberglab.org/research/\n\n​\n\n2019 - 2023\n\nBlueConnect: Blue growth opportunities in changing kelp forests\n\nThis SANOCEAN project aims to create valuable training opportunities and research collaborations between South Africa and Norway that center around knowledge-based management of kelp forest resources under changing ocean conditions. This project will measure the ecosystem services provided by kelp forests in South Africa and Norway, and build capacity for coastal research, sustainable development and management of these resources through high-level post graduate training, collaborative research, as well as scientific knowledge transfer. This will better enable communities to anticipate and prepare for future changes and possibly even benefit from these expanding ecosystems.\n\nRole: Project Leader\n\nwww.blueconnectproject.com/\n\n​\n\n2019 - 2023\n\nArcticKelp: Fate of kelp forests in a rapidly changing Arctic\n\nKelp forests have been recorded throughout the Canadian Arctic, yet we know little of these habitats, and their fate in this era of rapid change represents a critical gap in our knowledge of Arctic coastal ecosystems. Research to date suggest that a warmer Arctic with less sea ice may increase the extent of kelp by providing extended periods of light and warmer waters for growth. However, melting sea ice and permafrost may offset this benefit by freshening and increasing water color and turbidity in coastal areas. This ArcticNet project will combine coastal surveys, scientific dive experiments, laboratory tests, community meetings, remote sensing, research cruises, and modelling approaches to map kelp forests in the Arctic, assess their importance for coastal ecosystems and coastal societies, and predict climate-driven impacts on them. Knowledge on Arctic kelp forests may help northern communities and societies anticipate and prepare for changes in the coastal zone and possibly even benefit from these new ecosystems.\n\nRole: Project Manager. PI: Prof. Philippe Archambault\n\nwww.arctickelp.ca\n\n​\n\n2017 - 2019\n\nSUKER. Broad-scale ‘litter bag’ experiment in SUGAR kelp forests.\n\nThe aim of SUKER is to discover how residence time and turnover of blue carbon varies on regional scales. Funded by the Norwegian Blue Forest Network. This is a collaboration among 12 kelp forest research groups in the northern hemisphere.\n\nRole: Project Leader\n\nwww.nbfn.no\n\nPEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS\n\n¥ = joint first authors.\n\nPessarrodona A, Franco-Santos RM, Wright LS, Vanderklift MA, Howard J, Pidgeon E, Wernberg T, Filbee-Dexter K.
