        "text": "From 24 to 25 November 2022, the 1st International Conference on Technological Advancement in Embedded and Mobile Systems (ICTA-EMoS), held at the Arusha International Conference Center (AICC) in Tanzania, successfully opened the series of bi-annual scientific and technological conferences planned for the future. The conference was organized by the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology, Arusha, Tanzania in collaboration with the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Germany and all implementing partner institutions from the Centre of Excellence for ICT in East Africa (CENIT@EA).\n\nThe first ICTA- EMoS Conference provided a hybrid platform for academia, industry, and policymakers to strengthen their ties for strong regional development and integration. Participants at the conference made ample use of this with inspiring keynote speeches, tutorials, and scientific workshops.\n\nAt the core of the conference, 78 scientific articles were presented by their authors orally or in poster presentations. Like the whole conference, the papers dealt with four major topics: Smart Systems Development, Artificial Intelligence Tools and Applications, Ethics in Information Systems and Cognitive Informatics and Wireless and Mobile Computing. The ICTA-EMoS conference received articles from all over the world, from Europe, Africa, Asia, North America or South America, that had gone through rigorous reviews leading up to the conference.\n\nThe Vice Chancellors of the partner universities of the Academic Consortium of dSkills@EA from EAC personally participated or were represented in the ICTA-EMoS conference. The organizers welcomed representatives from the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, the University of University of Technology and Arts of Byumba in Rwanda; Moi University in Kenya and Kabale University in Uganda. Additionally, from the region the University of Juba in South Sudan and the University of Burundi were also in attendance.\n\nThe conference was organised within the framework of the project Digital Skills for an Innovative East African Industry (dSkills@EA) and received strong support from the dSkills@EA implementing partners institutions EAC, IUCEA, DAAD, GIZ who also participated in the conference. The conference was further supported through generous sponsorships from industry partners in East Africa and Germany.\n\nColleagues from the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) visited the Department for Very Large Business Applications (VLBA) from 4 – 6 October 2022. During their stay they had an intense exchange with colleagues from different department at our university to get input for creating or strengthening similar institutions at their home university and developed several action items.\n\nThe topics covered during the visits were four key components of the joint German-East African project dSkills@EA – Digital Skills for an Innovative East African Industry: a Research Hub, an Entrepreneurship Hub, an Alumni Network and a Didactical Centre. There for elements ar to be implemented or strengthened at NM-AIST during the project. The following representative from NM-AIST attended the exchange:\n\nDr Efraim Kosia, Chief Academic Officer and Head of the Academic Department\n\nRebecca Magomere, 3rd Cohort Student Embedded and Mobile Systems, co-founder of student Embedded Club\n\nDr Edna Makule, Research & Innovation Unit Head\n\nDr Janeth Marwa, Entrepreneurship lead, School of Business Studies and Humanities (BuSH)\n\nDr Elizabeth Mkoba, Entrepreneurship lead, School of Computational and Communication Sciences and Engineering (CoCSE)\n\nDr Devotha Nyambo, Industry Lisaison/CENIT@EA\n\nDuring they stay they met with the Graduate School Science, Medicine and Technology (OLTECH) to discuss support for students to enhance their scientific independence and career planning. From a meeting with the OLDIES club, an alumni organization for Computer Science graduates at UOL, they took home impulses to further develop the alumni work at NM-AIST. With the Study and Counselling Service at the university they discussed the promising activities and offer to help students find employment. Transfer as the third pillar of modern universities featured heaviliy on the guests’ agenda. From a personal presentation by Hauke Precht, team member of VLBA and co-founder of blockchain endeavor HAPTIK, they received helpful insights into the founding process at UOL. The Entrepreneurship Hub at the university, giz, gave them the bigger picture of institutional support for entrepreneurship, while the Endowed Chair of Entrepreneurship covered research into entrepreneurship.\n\nThe visits provided the impetus for further intensive cooperation between colleagues from Germany and Tanzania in the various areas. In the course of all meetings, concrete points of contact for further cooperation were identified.\n\nFrom 19 – 30 September 2022, the VLBA department welcomed Prof. Kisangiri Michael, Centre Lead at the Centre of Excellence for ICT in East Africa (CENIT@EA), and Dr. Mussa Ally Dida, Dean of the School of Computational and Communication Science and Engineering (CoCSE), both at Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) in Arusha, Tanzania. During their stay, their participated in a Teach-the-teacher module on SAP S4/HANA and got to know the research landscape at the University of Oldenburg.\n\nTeach-the-teacher at CENIT@EA\n\nOne of the objectives of our Centre of Excellence for ICT in East Africa (CENIT@EA) that our department coordinates academically is to increase and apply the institutional quality at the Centre and ensure practice-oriented teaching. To this end, teaching staff is to be trained via Teach-the-Teacher approaches, competence, and skill development. This includes didactics, further trainings for teaching and administrative staff.\n\nGetting to know SAP S4/HANA\n\nWith Prof. Kisangiri and Dr. Mussa, who is also the Deputy Centre Lead at CENIT@EA, the two leading representatives of the Centre participated in the Teach-the-teacher module on SAP S4/HANA to pass on their experience to their staff and fellow teachers and supervisors. Colleagues from the VLBA department who are experienced experts on the subject introduced their colleagues from Tanzania to the use of SAP S4/HANA in teaching contexts by involving them in their lectures during their stay and introducing the virtual learning environment SAP University Competence Centre (UCC) Magdeburg to them.\n\nThe UCC will allow them and their colleagues at NM-AIST to enrich their courses with various practice-oriented teaching and learning environments. Staff at NM-AIST and the students in the Master program for Embedded and Mobile Systems at NM-AIST will receive access to the UCC which will allow the students to practically implement learned processes based on SAP technologies.\n\nResearch for Research\n\nThe second focus of Prof. Kisangir`s and Dr. Mussa`s stay in Oldenburg was an exchange on research activities. The Centre of Excellence will start its own Research Hub during the remaining run of the project to be continued after the project`s runtime. For this purpose, Prof. Kisangiri and Dr. Mussa discussed research projects at the VLBA department with the responsible colleagues and visited partner organisations OOWV and Granny & Smith to deep-dive into the transfer activities of the department. They also met with colleagues fom COAST, the Research Centre for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Oldenburg. The intense exchanges from colleague-to-colleague can provide the basis to further sharpen and strengthen the research profile of NM-AIST.\n\nOn August 23, the first on-site appointment at our practice partner Diephaus in Vechta was scheduled. Steffen Meeuw, Julian Helms, and Rene Kessler drove together to Vechta to meet with Marcel Peplies, whose master thesis also deals with drone inventory, and the IT manager of Diephaus. The appointment was used to take new drone pictures and to test the GPS waypoint control, especially regarding the drone's integrated collision protection.\n\nPictures and videos were taken of specific aisles of the warehouse, since taking pictures of the entire warehouse (see cover photo) would have been too time-consuming. These shots were taken to train the computer vision models. Pictures were taken in the front view and in the top view. Two different drones were used at the same time.\n\nMore exciting, however, was the test of the GPS waypoint control regarding collision protection. For the GPS waypoint control, a third-party app was used in which the waypoints were manually defined on site (a more detailed description of the process can be found in the blog post \"Aufnahmetag bei Getränke Essmann\").\n\nWhile creating the waypoints, the group already noticed that the drone needs to have a large distance to the storage location for some front view shots and accordingly flies close to the storage location of the opposite side. The large distance towards the target results from the drone's non-vertical-rotating lens, so for well-filled storage places, the drone must maintain a large distance to capture the entire contents of the place.\n\nHowever, the drone has sensor-controlled collision protection, which keeps it from flying too close to other objects. Manually, this can be bypassed, but the test now was to see if all waypoints could be approached during an automated flight. Some waypoints were not approached by the drone and accordingly no images were taken at these.\n\nFurthermore, the group noticed that the drone must stop at the waypoints for at least one second to give the drone enough time to position itself and align the gimbal. This ensures that the footage from each storage place is of similar orientation and quality.\n\nThe on-site appointment at Diephaus produced many helpful insights and recordings. Now the group can deal with these intensively so that a further step can be taken towards the goal of drone-supported inventory.\n\nThe call for the 5th cohort for a Master Programme in Embedded and Mobile Systems at our partner university in Tanzania is now open. The programme with strong regional industry links equips students with in-demand skills and competences in a dynamic field. Graduates with a Bachelor`s degree or equivalent in the STEM field can now apply until November 15, courses will commence in January 2023. The EMoS programme i spart oft he Centre of Excellence for ICT in East Africa, CENIT@EA, that the VLBA department coordinates with international partners.\n\nWhat is the EMoS Master Programme?\n\nCENIT@EA is hosted by the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) and located in Arusha in Northern Tanzania. For the fifth year in a row, the Centre offers a 2-year Master in Embedded and Mobile Systems that is geared towards the needs of the private and public sector in East Africa. The Master includes elements such as an internship, an applied Master thesis, Summer Schools, guest lecturers from the private and public sector, as well as Entrepreneurial and Soft Skills training. This enables the students to develop and marketize digital solutions, that are crucial for the transformation of industries and the development of the region.\n\nThe main academic goal of this programme is to strengthen teaching and research in Embedded and Mobile Systems in the EAC. The program is demand driven with industrial linkage in order to strengthen the entrepreneurial skills and the employability of graduates in this field. By closely cooperating with East Africanindustries, new opportunities are offered to graduates, as their skills are directly matched to the region’s needs.\n\nWho can apply?\n\nThe call is aimed at graduates with a first academic degree in Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) fields related to Embedded and Mobile systems, as well as professionals working already in the academia or private and the public sector. The CENIT@EA project especially aims to strengthen the role of women in STEM-related fields and the ICT sector. Female graduates are therefore particularly encouraged to apply.\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nThe admissions process is fully handled by NM-AIST. Interested students can apply for admission to the master programme in Embedded and Mobile Systems through the NM-AIST Online Admission System. You can find more information about required steps on the website of the Online Admission System.\n\nFor assistance or more inquiries on general admission applications to the EMoS programme at NM-AIST please write to admission@nm-aist.ac.tz or call +255 628 183 676 during office hours. You can also contact the CENIT@EA project office at the VLBA under cenit-ea@uni-oldenburg.de.\n\nThe need for an Emerging Trends in Embedded and Mobile Systems (EMoS) scientific and technology conference has been widely discussed at higher learning institutions, with students, academics, and researchers finding it difficult to publish their fresh research discoveries. The 1st International Conference on Technological Advancement in Embedded and Mobile Systems (ICTA – EMoS) will give an opportunity to the previous mentioned group to do profound research on EMoS and publish their novel findings, but also engage participants into face-to-face discussions and exchange ideas in their areas of expertise and interest.\n\nAt the conference, accepted submitted scientific papers to ICTA – EMoS will be presented followed by a questions and answers session, also there will be a poster session where presenters will be available to respond on the raised questions.\n\nCall for Papers\n\nThe conference covers all aspects of embedded and mobile systems and their applications. ICTA-EMoS draws researchers, application developers, and practitioners (industrial partners) from a wide range of embedded and mobile systems related areas such as Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, mobile applications development, etc. By promoting novel, high-quality research findings, and innovative solutions to challenging embedded and mobile application problems (EMoS), the conference seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in EMoS.\n\nPaper submissions should be limited to a minimum of five (5) pages (mainly from industrial partners) and a maximum of ten (10) pages (academic researchers), in the Springer 1-column format including the bibliography and any possible appendices. Submissions longer than 10 pages will be rejected without review.\n\nReview and Publication\n\nAll submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to scope of the conference, originality, significance, and clarity.\n\nA selected number of best papers will be invited for possible inclusion, in an expanded and revised form, in the the book “Advances, Trends and Applications in Embedded and Mobile Systems” published by Springer.\n\nDeadlines for Submission of Papers\n\nPaper Submission: 31 July 2022\n\nAcceptance Notifications: 31 August 2022\n\nCamera Ready Submission: 31 September 2022\n\nICTA-EMoS Conference: 24 – 25 November 2022\n\nAll details about ICTA-EMoS\n\nThis article was written by Johannes Schering, Zora Becker, Janika Hintzsche & Roland Hentschel.\n\nAlthough we get used to online meetings in the past years and its potential to avoid unnecessary traveling, the physical exchange is important to understand the different perspectives in an interdisciplinary project like BITS is. The Corona restrictions in the North Sea Region are slowly relaxing what gave room for realizing a smaller scale site visit at the BITS partners in Oldenburg. In one and a half days the BITS project managers Ronald Jorna and Robin Kleine learned a lot about existing and forthcoming smart cycling initiatives by the city of Oldenburg, baron mobility service GmbH (baron) and the University of Oldenburg (Department of Business Informatics VLBA).\n\nBaron Mobility service\n\nThere is not only a lot of research on the cycling domain in the Northwestern part of Germany, but also a lot of SMEs that push forward new cycling related business models. Ronald Bankowsky, the founder and innovator of baron, presented his new company and the related business potentials at the meeting at the inner city office of baron. The new company Fast2Work has launched two data-based mobility applications. The Bike Tour Guide (biketour.guide) is a free bike navigator and route planner. The website SteigUm.depersonally converts the switch from car to bike into vacations, fitness etc.\n\nAs part of their BITS participation, baron will provide the Changers CO2 Fit app to its corporate customers as another ITS implementation. Team competitions as internal company challenges are intended to motivate employees to cycle (more) by making it more fun. The app records the traveled distances and calculates the CO2 savings compared to the car, as Janika Hintzsche from baron mentioned in her presentation.\n\nCity of Oldenburg\n\nThe new business idea was also a connection point to the activities of the city of Oldenburg. Since the beginning of April 2022, the new bike sharing service OLi Bike is available to the general public. Kerstin Goroncy, the cycling coordinator of the city of Oldenburg, explained in detail how the new offer and its organization works. Commuting is an important topic in Oldenburg. With the same motivation as Fast2Work and baron, more employees from the surrounding area should switch from car to bike more often on their way to work. Part of this solution are infrastructure based ITS solutions to make cycling more attractive. The thermal imaging camera systems are able to detect a group of cyclists to prioritize these at traffic lights.\n\nUniversity of Oldenburg (Department of Business Informatics VLBA)\n\nPart of the municipal ITS solutions are also the induction slopes based bike counting systems. The collected data is processed by the scientific team at the University of Oldenburg (VLBA) as part of the Bicycle Data project as one of the BITS implementations. In this context research associate Johannes Schering introduced to the smart cycling innovations where the University is strongly engaged. Johannes explained the functions of a first prototype of SmartHelm - the project develops an awareness sensitive bicycle helmet that includes a headup display to provide relevant information in the cargo bike city logistics context based on measured distractions by biophysical sensors. The VLBA department is actually working on a new data portal (Behavioral Data Repository) to provide new cycling KPIs and awareness-sensitive open biophysical data consisting of EEG, eye tracking and GPS data. The recently started project INFRASense is working on a data driven assessment methodology for the bike infrastructure to support cities in the cycling promotion process. In this context the University is building up a cycling data lake that consists of citizen sensor data, traffic data, infrastructure data, accident data, reportings etc. New cycling KPIs on bicycle accidents and reportings on infrastructure shortcomings enable the comparability of different cities in terms of (perceived) traffic safety. SmartHelm and INFRASense are both funded by the German Federal Ministry of Digital and Transport as part of the mFUND programme that supports digital innovations in the mobility sector since 2016.\n\nBike tour\n\nThe site visit was rounded off by a practical experience of the bike infrastructure as part of the bike tour. According to the Changers app, the duration of the trip was 17.3 km while 3.3 kg CO2 was saved. The participants perceived the strengths and weaknesses of the bicycle infrastructure in Oldenburg. Part of the tour was also a closer look to the accident hotspots in the city area. The project managers from the Netherlands were surprised to learn that it is very common in Germany to put a white bicycle (the so called “Ghostbike”) to accident points in silent memory to cyclists who were killed at this location. There is still a lot to do in the cycling promotion process - not only but also in the field of cycling data collection. All in all, although the number of participants was limited, the live meeting was a great experience after such a long time. We are looking forward to the next live steering group meeting in Aarhus (Denmark) in June.\n\nStudent life at the Centre of Excellence for ICT in East Africa (CENIT@EA) that the University of Oldenburg coordinates within an international partnership, is moving ahead. With the beginning of this year, the fourth cohort of students enrolled in the Masters programme in Embedded and Mobile Systems. The students from the previous, third cohort, just started their internships in the East African Region.\n\nOn 14 January 2022 the fourth cohort of students took up their studies at Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST) in Arusha, Tanzania. Amongst the 30 new students and were 24 scholarship holders. Four students each from each of the six EAC member states receive full scholarships for the duration of their studies. The scholarships awarded by the project include a monthly living allowance, rent assistance and financial assistance for studies and research, and also cover the tuition fees applied at NM-AIST. Of the 24 scholarship holders, nine are female. With this fourth cohort, the Centre of Excellence has in total offered 112 scholarships for the Masters programme in Embedded and Mobile Systems.\n\nThe previous cohort is at a further stage now, having started their internships. The two-year Masters programme contains a compulsory industry placement for all of its students. The main objective of the industrial internship is to promote regional cooperation and linkage with the industries, with a strong focus on technology, innovation and entrepreneurship. The students also get the chance to gain additional practical experience and extend their network. The internships last six months and can be done at any private or public institution in the EAC region that fits the programme. During their placement the students carry out their own practical project that is submitted after their stay, while being support by a host supervisor within the company, NGO or public institution as well as an academic supervisor. The third cohort started their internships in February 2002 and will accordingly finish in August this year."
