We examine the current state and recent trajectories of 19 ecosystems, spanning 58° of latitude across 7.7 M km2, from Australia's coral reefs to terrestrial Antarctica. Pressures from global climate change and regional human impacts, occurring as chronic ‘presses’ and/or acute ‘pulses’, drive ecosystem collapse. Ecosystem responses to 5–17 pressures were categorised as four collapse profiles—abrupt, smooth, stepped and fluctuating. The manifestation of widespread ecosystem collapse is a stark warning of the necessity to take action. We present a three-step assessment and management framework (3As Pathway Awareness, Anticipation and Action) to aid strategic and effective mitigation to alleviate further degradation to help secure our future.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Combating ecosystem collapse from the tropics to the Antarctic\n\nAU - Bergstrom, Dana M.\n\nAU - Wienecke, Barbara C.\n\nAU - van den Hoff, John\n\nAU - Hughes, Lesley\n\nAU - Lindenmayer, David B.\n\nAU - Ainsworth, Tracy D.\n\nAU - Baker, Christopher M.\n\nAU - Bland, Lucie\n\nAU - Bowman, David M.
