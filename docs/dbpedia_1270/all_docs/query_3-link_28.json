        "text": "We are in the final stages of ramping up to what seemed like, six months ago, an insurmountable set of peaks of research-related activities, whilst trying to stay sane amidst all the \"business as normal\" crazy hectiness of everything else that doesn't stop. We're not quite there yet but getting close, and I thought I'd take the opportunity to thank some of my sponsors this week: 🍫 firstly sugar, in the form of marshmallows, M&Ms, chocolate - basically any form factor that can be delivered to the mouth easily without much concentration, whilst working (ice cream isn't so good for this) 🍸 Martinis, and some good Australian Shiraz 🍷 ☕ Caffeine in the form of good coffee, elixir of the Gods of Academic Productivity 🏃♂️ Exercise, which takes the edge off just about everything, whether it's an exhilarating but somewhat destablizing high, or a corrosively stressful low or daunting set of challenges ⌛ Uninterrupted, contiguous chunks of high quality working time - co-incidentally the topic of a recent Nature editorial, \"Science must protect thinking time in a world of instant communication\", which got a lot of discussion and debate going: https://lnkd.in/dJNGuw2R 🐕 Stress relief, aka Archie the Fluffball Of course, this is a gross oversimplification, and deigns to mention all the family members, friends, colleagues, collaborators, team members etc... without which it would be very hard to get anything done... (and without which I don't think there'd be much motivation to even attempt those things in the first place). #AcademicTwitter #AcademicLife #research #university\n\nToday we were fortunate to have Prof Gordon Cheng from Technical University of Munich visit the QUT Centre for Robotics, hosted by Tobias Fischer and myself, and give a special research talk on #humanoids, #bioinspired / #biomimetic #robotics and #AI. Gordon has been working on #humanoids and bio-inspired robotics for decades and shared his insights and experiences - especially valued with all the interest, hype and investment in #humanoids currently in the robotics field based on their pairing with #foundationmodels / #largelanguagemodels and new large scale initiatives to provide robot-specific datasets and models. Gordon is also an #Aussie expat!!! He did his undergraduate at University of Wollongong and his PhD at the The Australian National University working with colleagues like Alex Zelinsky, before long term stints in both #Japan and now in Germany at TUM. Some topics discussed and debated today included: 🔹 what can we actually claim about bio- and neuro-inspired robotics and AI? 🔹 how long will the current resurgence of interest and investment in #humanoids be sustained if results are slower than hoped for? 🔹 is it easier (from both a technical and commercial perspective) to make humanoids that do a) a slightly better near-perfect job of already highly optimized jobs in logistics and manufacturing, OR b) to do a \"not great but better than nothing\" job in more error-forgiving, nowhere near-optimized roles like home cleaning and tidying? Gordon spent much time talking about the middle case - somewhat optimized, somewhat generalizable humanoids. 🔹 what are the differences and similarities in the #German, and more general #European research ecosystems, compared to Australia, and what can Australia learn from Germany and Europe (and vice versa)? Gordon is in town (Brisbane) until late tomorrow (Thursday afternoon) if you want to catch him: get in touch on gordon@tum.de #robotics #Australia #Germany #research #humanoid #robot #robots #consumer #industry #servicerobotics #manipulation #tactilerobotics #electronicskin #grasping #humanrobotinteraction #HRI\n\n🤔 Can you write ✏ a high quality grant proposal from scratch to submission in 45 minutes ⏲ ? That's what I recently did, for a real grant submission, as yet another experiment in my ongoing investigation into what new AI capabilities can, and can't do. The answer? Yes you can, IF a bunch of pre-conditions are met: 👉 it's for certain types of schemes, AND 👉 with the right prior context and materials, AND 👉 if you're already a fast, experienced proposal writer, AND 👉 with a scheme that allows or even encourages you to use modern tools, including ChatGPT, as long as you disclose and describe your usage. That was one of the new additions to my \"Sailing the AI Seas: Exploratory Insights for Research Careers\" talk that I gave at yesterday at the wonderful Centre for Research Excellence (CRE) in preventing and managing bronchiectasis. I ran through the ins and outs of doing this as of July 2024 (always needs to be updated because the tools are always changing): pre-conditions include being one of those fairly simple 2 - 5 page short grant proposals, a body of documented preliminary research you've already done in the area, and a detailed idea of the *new* research you want to pursue, the stages of the project, the types and amount of resources required, and the likely outcomes. Those pre-conditions, along with the others stated above, mean only a fraction of opportunities will be suitable, but it's not zero... and you still need to do much of the writing yourself, plus editing: it's not a \"magic\" fix but it does give the experienced grant writer a lot more options. Plus I covered: the history of and recent advancements in AI, generative AI and large language models, disruptions caused by AI in various professions, the need for new response toolkits, the AI play triangle (data-compute-talent), impact of AI on productivity in workplaces, differences in AI's impact on various professions, ethical usage of AI & integration of AI tools in research practices. --- Thank you to Stephanie Yerkovich and Anne Chang for the kind invitation (and all those from the university and government sectors who recommend me to speak, it's always nice to get that feedback), to Julie Marchant for the photos, and to all the wonderful researchers and paediatricians I met and learnt from, who are doing such an incredibly important but challenging job. We had some interesting conversations about the nature of research in their area; the challenges of even if you make a difference in your \"sphere\" of health activities, the need for policy / activities / support in all the other parts of the ecosystem to back you up. Good to see and catch up as well with colleague Steven McPhail of the QUT Centre for Healthcare Transformation.

But TWO! finalist spots in the Australian Museum Eureka Prizes, announced this morning. QUT Media Release: https://lnkd.in/d-J8f4dG Aaron is a finalist in the 𝐈𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲 category, for his collision risk assessment technology – software that has revolutionised the way we analyse, assess and access airspace to make it safer and more efficient. Endorsed by aviation authorities, and supported by industry partners, his rapid, low-cost risk assessment and map generation software and technologies are being used to automate flight planning, assessment, and the approval of uncrewed – or drone – operations. Aaron would be the first to point out that this is also a massive team effort with many collaborators, supporters, team members along the way. This is the latest accolade for Aaron, following being awarded the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences & Engineering (ATSE) Batterham Medal in 2022 and multiple industry innovation awards since; Aaron is also an ARC DECRA and multi-recipient of the Queensland Government’s Advance Queensland schemes. 👀 Aaron's video: https://lnkd.in/dPdpCq8d Aaron is a key Chief Investigator at the QUT Centre for Robotics and his \"spot\" on the QCR tour - where we, or he, gets to show off what the tech can do - is always a highlight. --- Clinton is a finalist in the 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐒𝐚𝐟𝐞𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐚 category: you can read more about his work in human machine teaming, the electromagnetic spectrum, and building more robust recognition systems in the media release, and check out his video: 👀 Clinton's video: https://lnkd.in/dSxgS4xK Clinton co-directs the Signal Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Vision Technologies lab at QUT, is Assistant Dean Research and is, like Aaron, within the School of Electrical Engineering and Robotics led by Firuz Zare, and this finalist award is the latest in a long list of prestigious accolades including a previous Eureka prize. --- The winners of the 2024 Eureka Prizes will be announced on Wednesday 4 September.

A big congratulations to all those who were successful, and commiserations to all those who didn't get the outcome they were hoping for, including the many who were on a repeat submission of their application. With fellowship applicants I mentor, I try to strike a balance between hope and aspiration, but also a realistic idea of how stacked the odds are against them, when the success rates are so low, no matter what they do. This may sound dispiriting, but I think it's also important to instill an understanding that someone can do everything right, have great, well above average prospects, and still repeatedly strike out over many years - especially so there is no misconception, so people can actively explore other options - and there are a range of alternatives. How are the numbers so brutal? Using the current Future Fellow scheme as an example, you get three attempts at the scheme. If: 🔹 your first attempt has an actual chance of 16% (same as the scheme odds this year, which is no mean feat of itself - matching the prospects of your talented peers), and 🔹 through massive improvement in the proposal and your track record, your much improved second and third attempts *DOUBLE* the prospects of the proposal to 32% (again, an even more impressive feat given the standards of the other applicants), then 🔹 there is still a ~39% chance (more than one in three hypothetical candidates) you'd be unsuccessful over *all three application rounds*. In the current academic system, where so many career prospects are (formally and \"informally\") tied to success in schemes like this* - as well as the ability to really do what you want to get done - that's a pretty demoralizing message to be sending to Australia's very top research talent. I don't know what the solution is, beyond more funding for research in Australia - in terms of putting bandaids on the problem, things that have come up that *may* make *some* difference are: 🔹 a multi-stage EOI-based scheme, like the new experimental discovery project scheme - efficiacy to be determined but some cautious initial positive response to it, 🔹 a multi-stage assessment then lottery scheme, where the top cut of proposals then go into a completely random lottery, and 🔹 a scheme that has some type of memory - so that genuinely top rated repeat proposals that go multiple applications without success get some extra consideration (noting explicitly that this would then disadvantage new applications in some way) #research #ARC #applications #funding #grants #careers #academic #academic #trackrecord #fellowships #fellows #FutureFellowship * some of these problems at least partially go away in a system where grant success in this schemes is not as heavily weighted in various aspects of the career assessment processes, but we're also a ways from that in the current system...\n\nThis week in our research group at the QUT Centre for Robotics bookended the start, and finish, of the PhD journey for two of our students. Firstly, we welcomed Beverley Gorry as a brand new PhD student, in the exciting and open-ended initial exploration stages of her PhD, in the broad area of visual localization/mapping, place recognition and general computer vision. Beverley's PhD is supported by a special scholarship from the School of Electrical Engineering and Robotics (thank you Firuz Zare and co) as well as by the QUT Centre for Robotics and other organizations including the Australian Research Council. Beverley is supervised by Alejandro Fontan Villacampa, Tobias Fischer and myself. Secondly, we got to see Somayeh Hussaini in the very final days of her amazing PhD journey, who today gave her Final PhD Seminar, \"Spiking Neural Networks for Scalable Visual Place Recognition\", with principal supervisor Tobias Fischer (and myself as Associate), panel chair and autonomous vehicle and localization expert Sebastien Glaser from CARRS-Q, and panel member and computer vision / ML expert Maryam Haghighat from the EER school and computer vision discipline area at QUT. Luckily for us, Somayeh will be sticking around to commence a postdoc and there's a stack of really exciting, groundbreaking research in pipeline! --- WE'RE STILL RECRUITING FOR PHDS --- We are still recruiting PhD students for the main scholarship intake round at QUT (Queensland University of Technology) this year: international applications close very shortly (likely too late to get in on that but there are always potential at-any-time grant or project scholarships on offer); but domestic student applications have another month until August 31st to get in touch and go through the initial application process: If you're interested (and haven't already registered your details), you can send your CV and interest to michael.milford@qut.edu.au and tobias.fischer@qut.edu.au. You can also check out the details on this upcoming scholarship round: https://lnkd.in/deVsRRMh #PhDs #research #robotics #VPR #localization #mapping #VisualPlaceRecognition #neuromorphic #biomimetic #autonomousvehicles #mapping #SLAM #computervision #AI #ML #MachineLearning #bioinspired #careers #careeropportunities #QUT #QUTRobotics #positioning #technology #researchanddevelopment #tech #neuralnetworks #spiking #brain #neural #neuron #perception\n\nAfter three amazing years at the QUT Centre for Robotics, our wonderful Centre Manager Ilana Bolingford has landed a great secondment opportunity as Research Policy and Projects Manager in QUT's Office of the SDVC and VP (Research). There will be proper farewells to come, but this also means that there are over a hundred roboticists, especially myself and Niko Sünderhauf as centre directors, who are very motivated to find our new acting centre manager - with an initial 1 year secondment for existing QUT staff on offer. The Centre Manager role lies at both the the cultural and operational core of our centre. It's an exciting, \"every day is different\" role: it can at times be challenging, but also enjoyable and a fantastic learning and development experience. It's also, perhaps most importantly, a great bunch of people to come in to work with every day. We've collectively worked incredibly hard on the culture of the centre over the years, and I chose a montage of some of the fun things Ilana has got up during her time with us to advertise this opportunity: whilst not every moment will consist of karaoke with a centre director, helping wrangle 70 researchers into a team-building, sand-castle building competition, or dressing up in 80s theme, we do have our fun amongst what is a very demanding but fulfilling role with huge impact and engagement. The key skills for this role include strong leadership, excellent collaboration and communication skills, administrative and operational proficiency, research and writing capabilities, effective event and stakeholder management, governance and reporting expertise, and proficiency in maintaining communication channels and social media presence. If you're a current QUT staff member, and are interested, please reach out to chat and/or send a CV and a brief one page statement of interest and capabilities to: EOI are invited for any current QUT staff interested in this opportunity. When applying for this position we encourage you to send your current resume and response to the selection criteria, which can be found here: https://lnkd.in/dVkZHxyR to: michael.milford@qut.edu.au and niko.suenderhauf@qut.edu.au If you want to find out all the ins and outs of the role, please get in touch with Ilana: ilana.bolingford@qut.edu.au We're looking for a soonish start - ideally around August 26th, 2024 (or as soon as possible after that date).

It brings to light one of the challenging aspects of trying to forge a career in academia, especially for early career academics at that critical formative stage. There are a few key aspects: --- WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT --- 💡 The mousetrap fallacy, which debunks the \"Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door\" - is very much also true in much of academia. If no-one knows about your work, it's very hard to have any impact, and consequently to have a career. Citations to your papers are a key part of this. --- WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN? --- 💡 It's increasingly difficult to catch everything in a literature review for a paper you're writing. This is especially true in fast moving fields where the volume of new papers coming out is staggering. But it's also true for historical work - a phenomenon much bemoaned by many key figures in AI for example. This doesn't excuse missing key references, but it explains why this sort of thing happens, all the time. I know I've missed key references over the years. 💡 the CITATION CUTOUT phenomenon is real, and it's BRUTAL. Citation cutout occurs when you, in a relatively unknown lab, pioneer ground breaking new research. The field picks up on it, and some of the \"big brandname\" universities / groups publish a follow on paper. They, respectfully, (usually) cite your work. BUT, and this is a huge but, what often happens THEN is that from that point onwards, everyone cites their follow on work, and your initial paper is doomed to obscurity (and possibly your career 😥 ). 💡 Finally, people can deliberately not cite your work: my experience, and observations, has been that it's mostly the accidental neglect, rather than deliberate omission, that does most of the \"damage\" here. --- MITIGATIONS --- 💡 one way to ensure ongoing relevance is to establish enough of a \"beachhead\" in a field. Without ever planning it this way, I and collaborators were able to do this in the \"bio/neuro-inspired robot navigation\" area - we got enough pivotal work done initially that it's still referenced today. But this takes a lot of luck, resourcing, and enough time to get \"established\". 💡 another mitigation mechanism is to talk about and promote your work, constantly, and to stay vigilant and politely remind people of your work where appropriate. This can be exhausting and uncomfortable for many - but the international research community is a noisy, imperfect one, and sometimes you just have to nudge people a little to get the traction that the work deserves. Obviously, one can take this to the extreme - such as standing up in every presentation to talk about your work. #academia #research #CareerAdvice #Careers #publishing #citations #robotics #AI #computervision #metrics #profile\n\nAnd for the robotics fans who just want the robots without any of the distracting human backstory, here's the robot super cut from last week's Robotics: Science and Systems (#RSS2024) conference in Delft, the Netherlands.
