        "text": "HyPerformer II: TH2ECO-Mobility\n\nThe initial foundations for the TH2ECO MOBILITY project were laid in 2019. The Thuringian Ministry of Energy, Environment and Nature Conservation (TMUEN – Thüringer Ministerium für Energie, Umwelt und Naturschutz) commissioned EurA AG to conduct a feasibility study on the construction and operation of a hydrogen fuelling station for trucks at the Erfurt freight centre (GVZ – Güterverkehrszentrum), which yielded a positive result.\n\nHyPerformer II: H2 project region Rügen-Stralsund\n\nThe HyPerformer region H2Rügen-Stralsund is pursuing the development of a central hydrogen hub (production, distribution and consumer infrastructure)\n\nHyPerformer II Rhein-Ruhr\n\nThe HyPerformer Rhine-Ruhr region is pursuing the development of infrastructure and hydrogen mobility in the Ruhr area.\n\nHyStarter II: Region Bendorf\n\nBendorf am Rhein is an independent town in the district of Mayen-Koblenz in Rhineland-Palatinate with a population of around 17,000. In addition to the main town, it consists of the districts of Sayn, Mülhofen and Stromberg.\n\nHyStarter II: District of Eichstätt\n\nThe district of Eichstätt with its 134,000 inhabitants and 30 municipalities is the geographical centre of Bavaria. Its diversity makes it unique: In virtually no other district are tradition and progress, nature-oriented life and highly productive work, the preservation of history and forward-looking action so closely intertwined.\n\nHyStarter II: InterFranken special purpose association\n\nThe InterFranken special purpose association (Zweckverband InterFranken) is a municipal alliance of eight cities and municipalities. Members include: Diebach, Dombühl, Feuchtwangen, Schillingsfürst, Schnelldorf, Schopfloch, Wettringen and Wörnitz. InterFranken is located in the west of the Ansbach district at the A6/A7 motorway junction.\n\nHyStarter II: State Capital Munich\n\nThe state capital of Munich is one of the most sought-after locations for business and innovation in Europe. The city on the Isar River is characterised by renowned global players, especially in the industrial and high-tech sectors, an innovative SME sector and a creative, broad-based start-up scene.\n\nHyStarter II: Region Neubrandenburg/MSE\n\nThe Mecklenburg Lake District (Landkreis Mecklenburgische Seenplatte), with the four-gate city of Neubrandenburg as its main centre, is the largest district in Germany in terms of area, with around 280,000 inhabitants.\n\nHyStarter II: Region East Frisia\n\nThe coastal region of East Frisia (Ostfriesland) is located in the extreme north-west of Lower Saxony and consists of the three districts of Aurich, Leer and Wittmund as well as the independent city of Emden. Covering an area of 3,142 square kilometres, 469,000 inhabitants live in the region.\n\nHyStarter II: Municipality of Perl\n\nThe municipality of Perl is located in the district of Merzig-Wadern, directly in the border-free three-country juncture of Germany, Luxembourg and France, in the heart of the greater Saar-Lor-Lux region and in the midst of the four centres of Saarbrücken, Metz, Luxembourg and Trier.\n\nHyExperts II: City of Hagen\n\nThe city of Hagen, with a population of around 195,000, is considered the connecting link between the Ruhr region and the Sauerland. Due to its special geographical location and the high density of energy-intensive steel processing and logistics companies, Hagen has excellent conditions for entering the hydrogen age.\n\nHyExperts II: District of Havelland\n\nThe 164,000-inhabitant Havelland district is located in the west of Brandenburg and borders Berlin in the east. Havelland is known far beyond its borders not only through Fontane’s literature (Herr von Ribbeck), but also because of its many nature reserves – environmentally friendly living and farming has long been an important issue here.\n\nHyExperts II: District of Helmstedt\n\nBraunschweig, Gifhorn, Goslar, Helmstedt, Peine, Salzgitter, Wolfenbüttel, Wolfsburg – a total of three cities and five municipal districts belong to the region of South-East Lower Saxony (SüdOstNiedersachsen). From the Harz and the Heath to Hightech and HyExpert.\n\nHyExperts II: Mainz\n\nIn Mainz, one of Germany’s oldest cities, tradition and progress are not conflicting concepts.
