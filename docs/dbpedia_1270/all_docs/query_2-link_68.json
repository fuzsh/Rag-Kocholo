        "text": "Hugh Possingham's research interests are in conservation research, operations research and ecology. More specifically his lab works on problems to secure the world's biological diversity: efficient nature reserve design, habitat reconstruction, optimal monitoring, optimal management of populations for conservation, cost-effective conservation actions for threatened species, pest control and population harvesting, survey methods for detecting bird decline, bird conservation ecology, environmental accounting and metapopulation dynamics. He has always been actively involved in conservation policy and advocacy - to learn how listen to \"The 2023 Univ Canberra Krebs lecture on Science, Maths and Environmental Policy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix2_UamShUw\"\n\nHugh is 40% UQ in the Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science to our website homepage (https://cbcs.centre.uq.edu.au/); 10% Accounting for Nature and 10% co-chair of the national Biodiversity Council. He sits on c30 other boards and committees pro bono.\n\nHis research projects are in the field of decision theory in conservation biology, including co-developing Marxan MaPP - Marxan (marxansolutions.org):\n\nBiodiversity offsetting\n\nBiodiversity markets\n\nConservation policy at all levels of government\n\nReserve design, biodiversity management and fire regime management\n\nPopulation viability analysis (PVA) - including the development of ALEX\n\nPollination ecology\n\nMetapopulation dynamics\n\nEcological economics\n\nOptimal monitoring and environmental accounts\n\nStochastic modelling\n\nBiodiversity and climate change\n\nPopulation dynamics of marine organisms\n\nMarine reserve design\n\nMarine population dynamics\n\nAvian community ecology\n\nEdge effects and fragmentation\n\nLandscape ecology\n\nBehavioural and population ecology of parasitoids\n\nSome of Hugh's research impact can be lsitened to here - \"The 2023 Univ Canberra Krebs lecture on Science, Maths and Environmental Policy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix2_UamShUw\". Some of the highlights are in his Wikipedia Page, so it muct be true :) :\n\n\"Possingham was the Queensland Chief Scientist from 2020 to 2022, where he provided high-level strategic science, research and innovation advice to the Queensland Government and acted as an ambassador for science in Queensland.[1][11]\n\nPossingham is a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, chaired the Australian Government's committees on Biodiversity Hotspots, and on Biological Diversity,[12] the Queensland Government's Smart State Council,[13] and the Wilderness Society's Wild Country Science Council.[14]\n\nPossingham co-authored \"The Brigalow Declaration\"[15] with Dr Barry Traill, used by Queensland Premier Beattie to support an end to land-clearing in Queensland. Land clearance in Queensland was removing 500,000 hectares of native vegetation each year, and was responsible for 10% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions; its cessation enabled Australia to meet its Kyoto Protocol target.[16] In 2009 he proposed devoting a proportionate fraction of gambling revenues to saving an endangered species, to be selected by a random drawing shown on television before the Melbourne Cup.[17]\n\nFrom 2016 to 2020, Possingham was the Chief Scientist of The Nature Conservancy, a global conservation organisation with 400 scientists and 4000 staff, that has protected more than 40 million hectares of land and thousands of kilometres of rivers worldwide.[1]\""
