        "text": "Diversified, creative and close to nature: Made up of 13 municipalities, the district of Offenbach offers locals and visitors a vast cultural and recreational programme held in the pulsating metropolitan region of FrankfurtRhineMain. Those in need of a break have many options available to them, like a leisurely stroll along the River Main or an evening at a rustic apple wine pub. And if even that is too much activity for you, then simply take some rest in one of the many beautiful oases of green, for example the ´Mühlheimer Steinbrüche` or the `Langener Waldsee`. Seligenstadt with narrow streets affected by half-timber, pitoresque corners and impressive monuments invite the visitors to a historical expedition.\n\nDreieich with five very different districts offers a variety of cultural monuments. The most recently built of all districts, Buchschlag, with its garden city like housing estates from the early 20th century is exceptional. The “Villenkolonie Buchschlag” (colony of mansion houses) is characterised in part by outstanding cultural monuments. The district Dreieichenhain is member of the “Fachwerkstrasse” (Half-timber road). The old town together with the medieval castle area are listed monuments and marked by their historic franconian half-timber houses within the former city walls. The visitor experiences, whether he enters the beautiful half-timber ensemble via the upper or lower gate, a memorable voyage into the past.\n\nThe residential town Heusenstamm was mentioned for the first time in 1211. Passing through the Baroque-red town gate which today is the home of the museum of local history, you arrive directly in Heusenstamm’s idyllic old town at the Baroque square in front of the church St. Cäcilia. St. Cäcilia was built between 1739 and 1744 by Balthasar Neumann. Its architectural predominance is highlighted by the surrounding buildings. Leaving the square the Schlossstrasse with its gable fronted houses - former farmhouses (Hofreiten) - leads to the castle. The castle Schönborn (1663-1668), an impressive building from the Renaissance with a grand Baroque garden, today accommodates part of the city council. Walking through the castle’s main entrance the visitor arrives at the ruin of the former water castle (from 1211).\n\nThe old town of Seligenstadt within its former fortification is listed and takes the visitor on a fascinating journey to experience its over 1100 year old history. Highlights of the Einhard-City Seligenstadt are the monastery, founded in 1828, the Einhard-Basilica, sanctified in 1840 and thus oldest church in the Kreis Offenbach as well as the Kaiserpfalz from the era of the Staufen. Many carefully restored architectural treasures characterise the old-franconian half-timber town by the river Main. The historic market square impresses with its precious and fully preserved houses to which in comparison the “new” town hall from 1823 appears almost modern. The so-called “Einhardhaus” built in 1596 catches the visitor’s attention with its broad gable façade, the rich half-timber ornaments and the Rhenish oriel which is decorated with wonderful wood carvings. Despite the surrounding monastery walls the visitor looking left onto the Freihof-square has a wonderful view over the entire monastery of the former Benedictine abbey and the towers of the Einhard-Basilica. Fascinating are also the Baroque garden of the monastery, a demonstration of the restored mill and the historically important Einhard-Basilica, which was built in 1830 Carolingian era by Einhard, the chancellor of Charlemagne."
