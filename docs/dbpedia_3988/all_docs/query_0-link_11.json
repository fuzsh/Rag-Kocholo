Jürgen Eichenauer was the leader of the city's story. The history of the city is recorded in detail in the archive and in the museum. Offenbach is a factory city and was a center of the leather industry. In truth, Offenbach is simply a friendly little town just outside the city of Frankfurt with a neighbourly atmosphere. People could call it a suburb of Frankfurt but Offenbach residents would never agree to that and like to think of it as its own entity. Both cities are lined up right next to the Main, which are perfect destinations to get to by bicycle. After Frankfurt, Offenbach has the highest population of foreign residents in Germany, who work mainly in banking and service industries.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you want to go to Offenbach, your best plan is to go to Frankfurt and then take either a car (or taxi), or the train.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nOffenbach Hauptbahnhof (main station):\n\nRegional train (Regionalbahn), abbreviated RB 33 direction Hanau\n\nBy train underground\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral lines will take you from Frankfurt to Offenbach City:\n\nS-Bahn lines S8 and S9 direction Offenbach Ost or Hanau\n\nS-Bahn lines S2 direction Offenbach Ost or Dietzenbach\n\nS-Bahn line S1 direction Rödermark-Ober-Roden\n\nBy tram\n\n[edit]\n\nTram lines 15 and 16 from Frankfurt, direction Offenbach Stadtgrenze\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nBus Service gets you everywhere.
