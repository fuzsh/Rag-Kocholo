        "text": "He had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played Offenbach's quadrille, waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side.\n\nAs easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius if you take him unawares on the wrong subject, or as many a man who has the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill-inspired in imagining its lighter pleasures; unable to go beyond Offenbach's music, or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque.\n\nHe always went to Ireland for the fishing, and he came to Paris for the new Offenbach things.\n\n4 will feature soprano Solange Sior and mezzo-soprano Karen Archbold, who will perform the \"Barcarolle\" (\"Belle Nuit\") from the \"Tales of Hoffmann\" by Jacques Offenbach.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Jacques Offenbach composed more than 120 musical stage works.\n\nDelta Hotels, part of Marriott International, has officially launched Delta Hotels by Marriott Frankfurt Offenbach, marking the European debut of the hotel brand.\n\nKickers Offenbach to support the club through their financial problems.\n\nThe new station in Offenbach, Germany has 940-volt capability with four cars able to charge up to a maximum of 150 kW.\n\nThe Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment is a period-instrument ensemble that beautifully delivers the French clarity and proportion in the Offenbach score, as well as the composer's love and gift for imaginative orchestration."
