        "text": "Template:Infobox German Location\n\nOffenbach am Main is a city in Hesse, Germany, located on southside of the river Main just next to Frankfurt am Main. In 2009 it had a population of 118,770. The city is part of the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main metropolitan area as well as the Frankfurt urban area.\n\nOffenbach was a center of the leather industry, which has however declined in the last decades. It is still the seat of the Deutsches Leder Museum (German Leather Museum), and also of the international leather fair.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Boroughs of Offenbach\n\n3 Economy\n\n4 Main sights\n\n4.1 Edifices\n\n4.2 Museums\n\n5 Population history\n\n6 Mayors from 1824 - 2009\n\n7 People\n\n8 External links\n\nHistory\n\nthumb|left|The 120-meter high \"City-Tower\". The first documented reference to Offenbach appears in 977. In 1486 the Isenburg Family took control of city, and 1556 Count Reinhard of Isenburg relocated his Residence to Offenbach, building a palace, the Isenburger Schloß, which was completed in 1559. It was destroyed by fire in 1564 and rebuilt in 1578.\n\nIn the mid 17th century Offenbach passed into the possession of the Landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt who ruled it until 1815 when the Congress of Vienna gave the city to the Austrian Emperor, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. A year later it was returned to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. The city was ruled by Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine until the monarchy was abolished in 1918.\n\nDuring the Second World War a third of the city was destroyed by Allied bombing which claimed 467 lives.\n\nWith the new district Lauterborn the city was expanded to south in the 1960s.\n\nOffenbach is also the seat of the Deutscher Wetterdienst (German weather service) and home to the soccer club \"Kickers Offenbach\" and their stadium \"Bieberer Berg\".\n\nOffenbach is on the Rhine-Main S-Bahn with six stations: Offenbach-Kaiserlei, Offenbach-Ledermuseum, Offenbach-Marktplatz, Offenbach-Ost, Offenbach-Bieber, Bieber-Waldhof.\n\nBoroughs of Offenbach\n\nBürgel (incorporated 1908)\n\nBieber (incorporated April 1, 1938)\n\nLauterborn\n\nRumpenheim (incorporated April 4, 1942)\n\nWaldheim\n\nLohwald\n\nTempelsee\n\nRosenhöhe\n\nEconomy\n\nthumb|left|S-Bahn station: Marktplatz Until the early 1970s Offenbach was dominated by the machine-building and leather industries. The city hosts the German Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies to this day.\n\nOffenbach was also the European center of typography, with Gebr. Klingspor and Linotype (inventors of Optima or Palatino typeface) moving to nearby Eschborn in the 1970s and MAN Roland printing machines still a major employer today. Typography and design still remain important with a cluster of graphic design and industrial design companies, as well as the university level HfG Offenbach design school and the Klingspor Museum.\n\nIn recent years Offenbach has become a popular location for a wide array of services, especially from the transport sectors.
