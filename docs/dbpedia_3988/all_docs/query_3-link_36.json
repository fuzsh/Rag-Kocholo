        "text": "While hanging out in Frankfurt for a couple of weeks, I scanned Google maps for a nearby town for my next day trip adventure.\n\nOne place that popped up is Seligenstadt. A small, perfectly preserved medieval town, located about 25 kilometers southeast of Frankfurt am Main.\n\nEven after doing a little research, I didn’t find much about it, but I was still curious to explore.\n\nThis eccentric town- with a population of only 20,000 people is packed with more intriguing sights than you can imagine. To say the least, Seligenstadt had plenty to offer!\n\nHISTORY\n\nIts’ origins date from 100 AD, when 500 Roman soldiers were stationed in a fortress here. Then, in 260 AD, fierce Germanic tribes destroyed the fort.\n\nLater, during the Carolingian period—Charlemagne deeded the town to one of his most dedicated scholars and advisors, Einhard, as a reward. Einhard wrote Charlemagne’s biography, called Vita Karoli Magni (Life of Charles the Great), regarded as one of the most precious literary bequests of the Middle Ages.\n\nDocuments state that the bones of two martyrs, Marcellinus and Peter, were stolen in Rome and transferred to the basilica in Obermuhheim (the city’s original name). This led to the name change to Seligenstadt, meaning “Blessed Ones’ Town.”\n\nAfter the takeover by the Archbishop Albert of Mainz, a new order was brought to the town, limiting the townsmen’s rights. As a result, Seligenstadt suffered greatly during the Thirty Years’ War as the Swedish king spared it from complete destruction.\n\nThrough secularization, the monastery was dissolved, and the town became a part of the Offenbach district.\n\nSeligentstadt is a cultural melting pot where you will find several different European influences making their way into many of the dishes served in restaurants.\n\nSIGHTSEEING\n\nWater Tower Seligenstadt (Wasserturm)"
