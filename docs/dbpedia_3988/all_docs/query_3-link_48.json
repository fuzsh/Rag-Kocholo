        "text": "Frankfurt, the fifth largest city in Germany, has plenty to offer. A cosmopolitan city with historical and modern sights is waiting for you. The city is located southwest Germany in the most important economic area. Frankfurt is located at the northern end of the Upper Rhine Deep Plateau, one of the warmest regions in Germany.\n\nIf you want to visit Frankfurt, you should do the following:\n\nTake a look at the city from the Main Tower - If you are coming to Frankfurt for the first time and want to orient yourself in the foreign city, than the Main Tower is the most highest place where you should start. The two observation platforms of the skyscraper make it possible to get an overview of all the districts and the surrounding area around Frankfurt.\n\nWatch the colorful hustle and bustle at the Römerberg - The Römerberg as well as the city hall of Frankfurt, the Römer, are the most famous landmarks of the Mainmetropolis. Just because of the staircase-shaped three-peaked front of the Römer, countless tourists are flooding the historic town square. Located directly in the center of the old town, the Römerberg is the ideal starting point to start an exploration tour through Frankfurt.\n\nVisit the Paulskirche in Frankfurt - German history comes to life in the Frankfurt's Paulskirche: on 18 May 1848 the first freely elected National Assembly met in the Paulskirche during the German Revolution. Today it represents the foundation stone for democracy in Germany. Nowadays a permanent exhibition provides interesting information on the beginnings of democracy up to the development of German unity.\n\nRelax in the exotic Palm garden - In order to escape the hustle and bustle for a few hours, a trip to the Palmengarten is an option. In the largest botanical garden in Germany everyone finds a quiet place. Surrounded by rare flowers and colorful plants, it is easy to come to rest and leave the hustle and bustle of the city behind.\n\nEnjoy a delicious \"Ebbelwoi\" - This hessian national drink is, of course, also served in Frankfurt. If you want to taste the delicious specialty, you should make your way to Sachsenhausen. Many old restaurants and traditional cider vine stores are lined up in old Sachsenhausen. With cold \"Ebbelwoi\" Frankfurter usually order substantial amount of food, such as ribs with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.\n\nClimb on the Goethe Tower (Goetheturm) - After climbing 196 staircases, you have reached the observation tower built entirely of wood. Next to the view of the famous Frankfurt skyline from a height of 43 meters, an adjacent forest playground attracts families with children to the Goethe Tower.\n\nDiscover Frankfurt from the water - With a boat trip on the River Main you can experience Frankfurt from its most beautiful side. In a relaxed atmosphere, the ships sail along historic landmarks and pass through secluded landscapes or urban architecture. Even if you have already walked the sights on foot, you discover the Mainmetropole from a completely new perspective on the water.\n\nFrankfurt is versatile – with business, trade fairs, shopping on one side, and culture, cosiness and traditions on the other, Frankfurt offers something for everyone.\n\nThe Hessian metropolis Offenbach am Main is a large city with many faces and above all known as the headquarters of the German Weather Service beyond the borders. The city is an educational center in Hesse and consists of different districts, which have their own charm. Offenbach has a population of 126,934. In the 20th century the city's economy was dominated by the machine-building and leather industries, and it was also a major center of the typography and design industries. Other industries are the automotive and pharmaceutical industries. During the Second World War the city suffered heavily from bombing by the Allied Forces. More than half of the city's population has a non-German background, with Turks, former Yugoslavs, Arabs, Italians, Greeks, and Poles as major groups.\n\nThe Isenburg Castle as a renaissance building is the landmark of the city. Offenbach was a center of the leather industry. The German Leather museum is one of the attractions of the metropolis and is a multi-section museum, which also houses the largest Shoe museum in Europe. In the city center, classicism plays a role in the cityscape. The inner city with the Frankfurter Strasse is a great place to go shopping. Here you can find the central pedestrian zone or the Wilhelmsplatz. The eastern inner city forms the Mathildenviertel, where many foundations are still preserved because they were not destroyed during the war. Here, the Berliner Straße with the City Tower and the Town Hall is a popular street, which was created in the 1950s.\n\nOffenbach am Main is the fifth largest city in the state of Hesse and borders Frankfurt am Main. The educational metropolis extends along the southern and south-eastern banks of the river Main. Offenbach and Frankfurt are located on the Mainbogen, which stretches to the port of Offenbach. Offenbach is located on the left bank of the river Bogen with its city parts such as Offenbach-Bügel.\n\nOffenbach and Frankfurt are today a networked settlement area. The geographic center of the city is quite difficult to spot as Offenbach rises west and north into Frankfurt's urban area. Offenbach is a quite green city, which was created above all through industrialization and was destroyed in the Second World War by bomb attacks. Around one third of the city area was destroyed by the Allied Forces air raids. Traffic roads like Berliner Strasse were built only after the war. The suburbs are located in the east of Müllheim am Main or Obertshausen.\n\nThe cultural attractions of Offenbach am Main include the Leather museum, the House of City History and the Klingspor Museum of Art and Writing in the Büsing Palace. The neo-baroque Büsing-Palace borders Offenbach's city park and is one of the most representative structures of the Main metropolis. The Offenbach Capitol, built as a cultural and event center, was built in the neoclassical style. In the early 20th century the building was a synagogue.\n\nThe City Hall Offenbach was built from the 1960s is one of the largest venues in the Rhine-Main region and was modernized in the 1990s. There are numerous events taking place from pop concerts to boxing matches. The city's attractions include the large parks such as the Leonhard-Eißnert-Park on the Bieberer mountain. The Bieberer mountain is connected to the traditional football stadium. The Offenburger Kickers played here until 2011, then the old stadium was demolished and a modern football staduim was built in the same place.\n\nThe Mainufer with the large car park is a starting point for getting to know the city. Upstream towards Bürgel and Rumpenheim it is calmer than in the urban part towards Frankfurt with the city center. An interesting place is the Wilhelmsplatz with the historical buildings and the Weekly market. The Frankfurter Strasse, Herrenstrasse or the Große Marktstrasse are ideal for shopping.\n\nThe historic streets with flair in Offenbach include the Schloßstraße or the French alley. Along these streets is the Old town, which was rebuilt after the war. Today's city center with modern buildings is located in a square around the Berliner Strasse or Kaiserstraße. Offenbach also has the beautiful parks, such as the Dreieichpark nearby Parkstrasse and Frankfurter Straße. The park in the west of the city was the first public park and offers relaxing walks in an idyllic setting."
