        "text": "The city of Offenbach am Main has 140,000 inhabitants and is historically known as an industrial city and center for leather goods manufacture, today as a center for design and art.\n\nThe Isenburg Castle on the Main was built in the 16th century under the rule of the Counts of Isenburg. It is considered the most important Renaissance building north of the Alps.\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, many Huguenot refugees were taken in who brought tobacco processing with them and thus helped Offenbach to grow. In the 18th century, many manufacturers migrated from Frankfurt to Offenbach and strengthened this economic growth. Other booming industries were leather goods manufacture and lithography, with the associated printing of notes.\n\nGoethe, Paganini and Mozart visited Offenbach several times. Mozart's piano concertos appeared as printed sheet music from 1800 in Offenbach. With the establishment of numerous train stations and train connections, the industrial sector also grew strongly.\n\nIn addition to the Isenburg Palace, the Rumpenheim Palace and the Büsing Palace with its park are regarded as particularly beautiful sights. The Klingspor Museum was once a graphic design museum and is now a museum for the art of writing and typography. Together with the University of Design and the German Leather Museum, it becomes clear why Offenbach is a center for design and art.\n\nA higher federal authority is the German Weather Service, which provides meteorological and climatological services in general and in particular for economic sectors and science.\n\nThe largest area for shopping is on Marktplatz, Frankfurter Strasse and Grosse Marktstrasse.\n\nThe most famous festivals are the Mainuferfest in June and the Festival of Lights in Büsing Park in August."
