        "text": "Frankfurt is not exactly a major tourist destination. But this city is a great base for exploring the state of Hesse or Germany’s Romantic Road.\n\nThere are plenty of beautiful places near Frankfurt, including charming old towns and medieval castles. You can visit most of these attractions on a day trip. You might even find guided tours to help you truly understand the history and culture of the Hesse region.\n\nIn this post, I share my top recommendations for places to visit near Frankfurt. So, let’s dive right in!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTop places to visit near Frankfurt\n\nThere are many beautiful places near Frankfurt, and you may be able to visit more than one attraction in a single day.\n\nHere are some amazing day trips from Frankfurt.\n\n1. The stunning castle of Burg Eltz\n\nThe medieval castle of Burg Eltz looks like it’s been plucked out of a fairy tale.\n\nNestled among sprawling green hills, the castle dates back to the early 12th century and is privately owned by a branch of the same family that built it.\n\nSome of the rooms in the castle are open to the public. Here, you can see the building’s well-preserved frescoes and original furnishings. ​\n\nIf you’re up for a bit of hiking, you can walk down the footpath from the lower car park. The path winds around the unspoilt Eltzbach Valley and offers sweeping views of the castle and its surroundings.\n\n2. The old town of Limburg\n\nSituated on the banks of the Lahn River, the old town of Limburg is one of the best-preserved historic sites in western Germany.\n\nThe town’s main attractions include Römer 2-4-6, which is the oldest free-standing house in German, and the seven-towered cathedral of Dom St Georg.\n\nThere’s also the Werner-Senger-Haus; a 13th century building which houses one of the oldest restaurants in the country. ​\n\nLimburg is a joy to explore on foot. Some of the town’s gorgeous, half-timbered buildings have been converted into artisan gift shops and traditional German pubs.\n\n3. The beautiful forests of Taunus\n\n​The mountain range of Taunus is a popular getaway among local city dwellers.\n\nThis area is known for its geothermal springs and mineral waters, and is home to several spa towns including Bad Ems and Königstein.\n\nSurrounded by the river valleys of the Rhine, Main and Lahn rivers, Taunus offers many scenic walking trails through dense pine forests and along rolling green hills.\n\nThe tallest peak in the range is Großer Feldberg at 878 metres above sea level. ​\n\n4. The historic city of Heidelberg\n\nLocated on the banks of the Neckar River, Heidelberg is home to the oldest university in Germany. It also has some of the best-preserved Baroque buildings in the country.\n\nThe city’s star attraction is the Renaissance castle, which hosts a wealth of architectural styles, as well as the world’s largest wine cask.\n\nHeidelberg also boasts a rich literary history and a thriving cultural scene, and in 2014 it was named a UNESCO City of Literature.\n\nRecommended Heidelberg tours:\n\n5. The cute town of Michelstadt\n\nIf you want to experience authentic Germany, you might want to plan a day trip to Michelstadt in southern Hesse.\n\nDespite being a small town, Michelstadt is a treasure trove of architectural gems.\n\nIts stunning 15th-century town hall is one of the most significant timber-framed buildings in Germany.\n\nOther attractions include a Frankish medieval castle complex known as Kellerei, an 18th-century synagogue and Jewish museum, and the remains of a Roman bathhouse. ​\n\nMichelstadt is even more beautiful in December, when the town hosts one of the most magical Christmas markets in Germany.\n\n6. The spa town of Bad Homburg\n\nBad Homburg is one of the most beautiful places near Frankfurt. Situated at the foot of the Taunus Mountains, this spa town is known for its healing baths and health treatments.\n\nIt’s also home to several shopping halls and cafes.\n\nYou can stroll through the town’s picturesque streets, visit the castle and palace, and explore the large park and gardens.\n\nYou might even treat yourself to a day at the spa!\n\n7. The quirky city of Darmstadt\n\nDarmstadt is a city near Frankfurt that’s home to some very unusual buildings.\n\nThese include the iconic Wedding Tower; a seven-storey monument commissioned by the Grand Duke of Hesse Ernst Ludwig to commemorate his marriage to Princess Eleonore.\n\nIf you go up to the top floor, you can enjoy panoramic view of the entire city.\n\nThere’s also the stunning Russian Chapel and the Waldspirale. The latter is a multi-coloured residential complex designed by Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser.\n\nIt has over 1,000 windows in the building, each with a unique shape.\n\n8. The charming town of Ladenburg\n\nLadenburg is another beautiful place near Frankfurt.\n\nIt is one of the oldest towns on the right side of the Rhine River and is home to colourful houses and cute little shops.\n\nIf you want to get away from the crowds, you can spend an afternoon exploring the quaint streets of Ladenburg.\n\nYou can also visit the Carl Benz car museum and house.\n\nTIP: If you enjoy cycling, check out this bicycle trip from Heidelberg to Ladenburg.\n\nBest day trips from Frankfurt\n\nWould you rather explore these beautiful places near Frankfurt with a local guide?\n\nHere are some of the best-rated tours and day trips from Frankfurt."
