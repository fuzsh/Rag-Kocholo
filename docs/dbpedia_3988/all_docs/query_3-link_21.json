        "text": "Once a city more developed than Frankfurt and a bustling economic hub today, the city of Offenbach is a contrast to the quaint German towns and districts of Hesse. Established as a city around the 15th Century, the city was ruled over by numerous counts of Isenburg. Flourishing as a commercial hub with tobacco industry, today the city is known for being a vibrant modern city with headquarters of several companies. From Hyundai and Honda, the city of Offenbach houses headquarters of multinationals like Capgemini in its glistening skyscraper called \"City Tower\". Contrasting the metropolitan architecture, historical landmarks like Rumpenheim Schloss, Busingpalais and Isenburger Schloss keep the heritage alive. Wilhelmsplatz boasts of several quaint eateries and cafes. From being ultra modern to preserving its rich history, Offenbach offers a delightful contrast to its visitors."
