From this date on, only German and foreign vehicles with a valid green plaque placed on the windscreen can enter Offenbach am Main and the majority of other German cities.\n\nWhich types of vehicles are affected?\n\nThe obligation to own the environmental badge applies to both German and foreign passenger cars (M1); motorhomes (M1); heavy campers (M1); minibuses (M2); buses (M3); small transporters (N1); transporters (N2); trucks (N2); and heavy goods vehicles (N3).\n\nDriving in Offenbach am Main\n\nAre you going to Offenbach am Main by car?\n\nFrom January 1, 2015, if you plan to visit Offenbach am Main in Hessen by car, you have to have a valid green environmental badge on the windscreen. Entrance to the zone is therefore allowed only to vehicles that produce the lowest level of air pollution that falls under the Euro 4 (diesel) or Euro 1 (petrol) emissions classes. Failure to comply with these rules is punished in Germany with a fine of 80 €.\n\nThe Offenbach am Main low-emissions zone covers the entire territorial district of the city as it is bordered on the south by the A3 motorway, in the west by the A661, and in the north by the Main River.\n\nOrder your environmental badge to enter Offenbach am Main and get free shipping!\n\nThe plaque has unlimited validity and should be placed in the bottom-right corner of the windscreen."
