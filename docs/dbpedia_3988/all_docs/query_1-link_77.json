        "text": "The opportunity card (Section 20a of the Residence Act [AufenthG]) improves your chances of making contact with German employers and finding qualified employment in Germany.\n\nTo find out if you need to apply for an opportunity card visa to enter Germany, please refer to the Do I need a visa? section.\n\nWhat are the requirements for an opportunity card?\n\nAre you from a country outside the EU/EEA or Switzerland and would like to apply for an opportunity card under Section 20a of the Residence Act [AufenthG]? The following options are open to you:\n\nOption 1: You have a foreign professional or academic qualification that is fully recognised in Germany. Alternatively, you obtained your university degree or professional qualification in Germany.\n\nProof of language proficiency: You either have German language skills of at least level A1 as defined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) or English language skills of at least level B2 (CEFR).\n\nAbility to cover living costs:\n\nFor both Option 1 and Option 2, you must have sufficient financial resources to fund your job search in Germany. During the visa process, you can demonstrate this ability with a blocked bank account (containing a minimum of €1,027 net per month, amount applicable in 2024) or a declaration of commitment.\n\nHow does the points system for opportunity cards work?\n\nThe points system is only relevant if Option 2 applies to you, i.e. if you are unable to demonstrate that you have a German qualification or that your foreign qualification has been fully recognised. To apply for an opportunity card visa, you must also provide evidence of formal qualifications and the necessary language skills. You can score points for the following criteria:\n\nEquivalence of qualification: If you have already applied for recognition of your foreign qualification and it has been found to be partially equivalent, you will receive four points. You will still receive the four points if, in the case of a regulated profession, you are required to participate in compensatory measures before obtaining a licence to practise your profession.\n\nQualification in a shortage occupation: If your formal qualification is in a shortage occupation, you will get one point. To find out which occupations are considered to be in short supply, consult the List of shortage occupations.\n\nProfessional experience: You will also be awarded points for your previous professional experience in relation to your formal qualification that you gained after graduating. Two points will be awarded if you can demonstrate that you have at least two years’professional experience within the last five years. If you have at least five years’ professional experience within the last seven years, you will get three points.\n\nLanguage skills: You will also earn points if your German language skills are above level A1 (CEFR). One point is awarded at level A2, two points at level B1 and three points at level B2 or above. An additional point will be awarded if you have English at level C1 or above, or if you are a native speaker.\n\nAge: You also receive points if you are a certain age. People who are no older than 35 get two points until the day they turn 35. All those aged between 35 and 40 are awarded one point.\n\nPrevious stays in Germany: Have you already lived in Germany? If you can prove that you have resided legally in Germany for a continuous period of at least six months in the last five years, you will receive one point. Examples of such stays include study, language and work stays. Stays for the purpose of tourism or visiting people do not count. Copies of old passports and the visas and entry stamps they contain can be submitted as evidence.\n\nSkilled worker potential of spouses or life partners: Are you married or in a partnership and would like to come to Germany with your partner on an opportunity card? If your partner already meets the requirements for an opportunity card, you will be awarded one point in the points system. With this in mind, he or she can also do the self-check: opportunity card.\n\nPlease note that all information you provide in the above categories must be supported by appropriate evidence or certificates for the visa application.\n\nDid you get a positive result in the self-check? Congratulations! You can now apply for an opportunity card at your diplomatic mission abroad. To find the contact address, please refer to our world map . If you are already living in Germany with a valid residence title, please contact your local foreigners authority.\n\nWhat opportunities does the opportunity card offer?\n\nOpportunity cards are issued initially as job search opportunity cards for a maximum of one year. The card allows you to look for gainful employment in Germany, i.e. you can seek employment or become self-employed.\n\nWhile you are looking for gainful employment, you are allowed to have one or more part-time jobs (secondary employment) totalling 20 hours a week. You can also do job trials for a maximum of two weeks per employer as part of your job search. The aim of the job trial must be either to obtain qualified employment, an apprenticeship or a qualification programme.\n\nIf you have found a specific job or apprenticeship, or if you want to become self-employed, you can apply to your local foreigners authority for one of the existing residence permits for qualified employment, for vocational training, for the recognition of your professional qualifications or for self-employment. If your job meets the requirements for qualified employment but you are not eligible for any other residence title, your opportunity card will be extended for up to two years (opportunity card extension)."
