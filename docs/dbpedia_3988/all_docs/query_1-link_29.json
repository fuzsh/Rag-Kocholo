        "text": "For the Offenbach Harbor Project, the first development work on the port area began in 2009. There were delays in the planning approval because the commercial residents on the northern Frankfurt side of the Main river feared that the new tenants and residents could assert emissions and noise protection requirements. In September 2010, an out-of-court settlement agreement negotiated, among other things, that the northern residential and commercial buildings on the harbor island would be equipped with soundproofing on the water side.\n\nThe development work continued in 2011. In particular, Hafenstrasse was expanded and the first green spaces were created. Construction of the first residential buildings began in August 2011. ABG Frankfurt Holding completed the Mainzeile Offenbach residential project by 2013. ABG was the first investor to invest 50 million euros in the completion of 178 rental apartments. As a result, 7,020 square meters of the port area have already been built on.\n\nThe 3,200 square meter Obere Molenpark was opened in May 2012. The staircase leading to the harbor basin is the western part of the planned central harbor square and was opened in April 2013. A narrow promenade, which has also been completed, connects the harbor stairs with the Molenpark.\n\nIn July 2013 it was announced that Saint-Gobain Building Distribution Germany wants to build its new German headquarters with 210 employees on the port island. A seven-story office building was built with a usable area of ​​6,500 square meters and an investment volume of 20 million euros. Construction began in autumn 2013 and was ready for occupancy in spring 2015.\n\nIn February 2014, the first construction phase of the Hafengold residential complex north of the harbor stairs began. Around 200 condominiums are to be built in a total of nine six-story houses by 2016. The first construction phase of the Hafeninsel-Mitte project began at the beginning of 2015. By mid-2016, 68 additional condominiums are to be built in this section.\n\nIn May 2015, the construction of the elementary school with daycare began on the eastern property on what was then the Nordring. The basement-free structure closes off the pier to the south and acts as a noise protection against the noise pollution from traffic on the Hafenallee. The school was officially opened for the 2017/2018 school year. The four-class elementary school with two preliminary classes offers space for 420 children. A daycare center is available for 170 more, and after-school care is also offered.\n\nThe traffic development of the port island and its connection to the north end began in June 2014 with the construction work for the road bridge (roughly in the middle of the port basin) and the pedestrian and cycle path bridge (in the eastern part of the port basin). In the far east, between the Carl Ulrich Bridge, which opened in December 2014, and the port basin, construction of the port center also began in June 2014. This shopping and office center, planned as a striking entrance gate to the harbor district, with a separate multi-storey car park was opened in December 2015 and is intended to radiate into the northern north end of Offenbach am Main."
