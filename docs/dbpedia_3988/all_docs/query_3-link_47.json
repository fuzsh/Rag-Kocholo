        "meta_description": "Situated in the heart of Offenbach, B端sing Palais serves as a majestic Neo-baroque wonder dating back to the 18th Century. The city mansion is flanked by some arresting landmarks like Lili Temple and the B端sing Park. The palace's sprawling courtyard serves as an ornate venue for summer concerts. Also, a part of the palace is remodeled as a state-of-the-art convention center, used by the adjoining Sheraton Offenbach Hotel for conferences, seminars and presentations. In the past, B端sing Palais has played venue to the iconic Toujours Mozart, a highly attended musical extravaganza organized in the memory of the musical genius.",
