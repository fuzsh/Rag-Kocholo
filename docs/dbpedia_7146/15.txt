N2 - Wife Witch Whore forms a unique dialogic exchange (Helen Gorrill, Sue Williams and Marilyn Allen) which enables the reader to engage with essential conversations about women’s place in society, contemporary culture and the arts; through academic essays, creative conversations, philosophical endnotes and selected key excerpts, forming a definitive anthology of gender that is of central significance to contemporary visual culture today.The book is framed with three pivotal essays on the themes of ‘wife’, ‘witch’ and ‘whore’ (Gørrill); annotated through the urgency of handwritten and drawn conversations which explore and challenge the fantasies of feminism, sexuality, gender and culture (Williams); and elucidated through fascinating endnotes which take the reader on alternative journeys of discovery (Allen). In embracing the use of conversation or shared dialogue to explore the meaning of gender within contemporary visual culture, Wife Witch Whore enables you to follow the authors’ unique perspectives, encouraging you to add your own annotations to the book and thus directly participating in the authors’ conversations. Wife Witch Whore will serve as an excellent supplemental/recommended text for fine art, and art history students; and will enable a greater understanding of the vital and growing subject of gender and art - for artists, students, researchers and teachers in the visual arts, women’s studies/gender studies, the social sciences; and media, culture and communication. The book forms a leap away from former inaccessible academic texts and fills the essential gap in the market for a book which is accessible to all, and a thoroughly enjoyable and provocative read. It will stimulate research ideas, generate new visual work and enable the reader to break out of traditionally-held beliefs on gender, art and culture, through engagement with the world that surrounds us now.
