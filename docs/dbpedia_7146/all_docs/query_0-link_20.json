        "text": "March 29, 2018\n\nEs una corta historia que se incardina dentro de la novela naturalista francesa. Está bien, es entretenida (para el dramón que te está contando en realidad), no cuesta mucho leerla y es un buen exponente de ese movimiento literario que puede servir para conocerla un poco y no te apetece leer un tochazo de Zola.\n\n¿Cuál es el problema de la novela? La total y absoluta falta de empatía del autor por los personajes, sobre todo Marthe. Todos los personajes son seres horribles y egoístas, y como el autor pasa más tiempo describiendo lugares, personas y situaciones, queda muy poco para el desarrollo psicológico, que es esquemático. Son personas horribles porque son personas horribles. Y la que más sufre es Marthe, cuyo comportamiento muchas veces es porque sí, porque el autor piensa que las mujeres funcionan de esa manera y punto. Básicamente, la teoría de Huysmans de por qué se mete a prostituta es porque \"ya era un poco viciosa de serie\". Casi parece que se lo mereciera, según él. Hay dos personajes masculinos que tienen más desarrollo, o al menos, el autor parece ser más comprensivo con ellos... y uno de ellos es un maltratador. Tal vez la idea es que, por describir las partes más oscuras o \"inmorales\" de la sociedad, los que viven en ese mundo son bestias deshumanizadas, pero carga un poco demasiado las tintas contra Marthe.\n\nAl final son las opiniones de un señoro del siglo XIX. Tampoco se le puede pedir más. Para pasar el rato con un clásico sencillo está bien, pero si se quiere más desarrollo de personajes o que estos te caigan bien (o al menos que no quieras quemarlos en una hoguera a todos) no es el libro más recomendable.\n\nFebruary 8, 2015\n\nAs an amateur decadent historian, Marthe, histoire d'une fille (Marthe: The Story of a Whore) is a fascinating glimpse into the literary technique known as Naturalism, as this was J.K. Huysmans' first published novel, before he renounced Naturalism as 'gross materialism and over-simplified reductionism.' As with most of Huysmans' early work, there is little plot to describe. However, like Dostoyevsky's 'Notes from Underground', 'Marthe' is filled pervasive pessimism, exposing the dark harshness of life. In this tale, Huymans evokes low-life Paris with its seedy theaters, sketchy actors, and the miserable life of a Parisian prostitute in late nineteenth-century France. If anything, it is a key text in the analysis of Huysman's development as a writer, and a fascinating insight into the social attitudes and conventions of turn-of-the-century Europe.\n\n'Marthe' is also interesting for being one of the first French novels to tackle head-on the subject of prostitution. For this reason, the novel is more of a novella with a somewhat hurried ending. At the time of its writing, an insecure French government had begun clamping down on what it saw as threats to the moral health of the nation. In July 1876, the poet Jean Richepin had been fined and sentenced to a month in prison for publishing a collection of poems, Chanson des gueux, one of which, 'Fils de Fille' ('Son of a whore'), had been singled out by the prosecuting magistrate. Huysmans, of course fearing a similar fate for himself if he also published his novella in France, decided to publish in Brussels instead. Even worse was the news that Edmond de Goncourt was writing a novel on a similar theme and with a similar title, La Fille Elisa. Fearing both plagiarism and prison, 'Marthe' was a novel of political expediency, nevertheless Huysmans remained proud of the fact that 'his novel about a prostitute in a licensed brothel was the first of its time'.\n\nIt can be argued that Huysmans' Marthe is more interesting for its place in history than for the story itself-- and for readers of Huysmans, an important milestone in his career as a writer. For all of its faults-- its brevity, it's lack of characterization and patchy narrative as a whole-- the novel contains early indications of Huysmans' sense for detail and his upstartled eye for the strange and bizarre among the bold realities of everyday life that he would later become so infamously known for. His pessimistic tone conveys a powerfully humorous vision of a miserable world with wildly imperfect inhabitants. Describing piss-coloured couches and pugs 'whose breath stinks when they eat meat or anything sweet', the novella's Naturalism is an attack on the overidealised view of Bohemian life in Paris he found in such Romantic writers as Henri Murger, whose famous Scènes de la vie bohème had appeared in 1848.\n\nWhile Emile Zola saw Naturalism as a political tool, Huysmans saw it as a means to an aesthetic end. This difference can be seen in a comparison with Zola's own 'prostitute' novel, Nana (1880), which uses the demimonde as a means for exposing the hypocrisy and corruption of society. Rather, Huysmans' novella is less interested in political consciousness-raising, and more in confidence-boosting, as the credibility of 'Marthe' allowed him to pursue further explorations in novel form, eventually formulating a new aesthetic theory referred to as 'Spiritual Naturalism'. It's without saying, that Huysmans language is willfully perverse and grimly satisfying: \"She went to see one of her friends who worked as a waitress in one of the lowest dives in the Rude de Vaugirard. The saloon was almost empty when she went in and hadn't even swept yet. The mirrors on the walls, smeared with pommade from the heads that continually leaned against them, were clear at the top and tarnished at the bottom; the floor, powdered with rouge, was starred with dried spit, phlegm, cigar butts and pipe dottle, the marble table-tops were ringed with tacky stains from dirty glasses, and, at the back of the room on a sofa, a living image of infamy, lay the landlady' father, whose job it was to work the beer pumps.\"\n\nIn the end, 'Marthe' is a simple story about two love affairs between three people: the heroine of the story, a woman who struggles between jobs in artificial pearl casting and work in a seedy licensed brothel, a young and enthusiastic journalist called Leo, and an alcohol-ridden courtesan called Ginginet. Surpringly, 'Marthe' is more of a tale of a courtesan's rise and eventual downfall due to alcohol addiction than it is a tale of a low-life Parisian brothel. In fact, the novella lacks eroticism as a whole, and the descriptions of the brothel itself are very seldom mentioned. As an absinthe connoisseur, I must mention that even though Huysmans didn't become associated with the decadent movement until the publishing of À rebours in 1884-- after he split with Zola and renounced Naturalism-- absinthe is mentioned several times, and remains the only instances where Huysmans writes about the emerald muse. \"When everyone had a mop of bouffanted hair on their heads and a mass of ribbons and flowers hanging over their foreheads, they drank absinthe, shuffled the cards again and waited until it was time to set sail, whether for Lesbos or for Cythera.\"\n\nSeptember 10, 2020\n\nHuysmans’ first novel is also one of the first to attempt a realistic or *naturalistic* examination of prostitution. Limited by its artificial dialogue and character psychology, and somewhat clumsy plotting, this uneven story of a whore doesn’t quite measure up to Huysmans’ later work. Indeed, one contemporary critic rightly asked ‘what good does it do us to witness the blossoming of this venereal flower?’ BUT. . .Huysmans’ unmatched descriptive powers are already on display. No novelist ever saw the grimy truth of reality better, or could translate it so vividly. He wrote descriptions like Van Gogh painted the Night Cafe. Here is his rendering of the whore’s slum: A rusty door streaked blood-red and ochre yellow, a long dark corridor the walls of which oozed black drops like coffee, and a sinister staircase that creaked at every footstep and was impregnated with the foul stench of drains and the smell of the lavatories whose doors swung open in the slightest breeze. Also present is Huysmans’ remarkably blunt and still 144 years after its publication avant-garde assessment of the essential hopelessness of cohabitation:He also had to put up with the smell of her cooking, the heavy odour of wine in the sauces, sickening stench of onions fried in a pan, and look at bread crumbs all over the rugs and bits of cotton thread all over the furniture; the sitting room had been overturned from top to bottom. On cleaning days it was even worse. The ironing board had to be balanced across his desk and another table, and the washing had to be dried on a clothes-horse in the hall. The puddles of water on the parquet, the stale smell of lye, and the streaming laundry that left damp-stains on his brasswork and tarnished his mirrors, reduced him to despair.Page after page of both of the lovers’ resentments, which, stewing in poverty, turn the wine of love sour. As an indictment of carnality, Marthe makes Huysmans later turn to catholicism/spiritualism seem inevitable. Despite its flawed presentation of the anatomy of a prostitute, of which there is no need to detail, the book predicts Huysmans’ eclipse of other *naturalists* because his chief concern is the individual, and not the collective. He understood ruin is personal, not political:the daylight which filtered its gold-dust through the curtains showed him a face bruised by the depredations of the night, and a posture that revealed a whore who had been dragged through every gutter in the city.\n\nMarch 18, 2018\n\nHuysmans first novel is a patchy affair, concerning the life and eventual downfall of the prostitute Marthe. Lots of grim description of degradation and squalor. Quite a primitive effort in comparison to his more famous pieces but interesting to see where he began.\n\nJune 16, 2023\n\nDidn't enjoy it too much, but it was a short enough novel. I was drawn to it because of the really neat edition I found that had some illustrations by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec every couple pages. They were definitely a positive and exactly evoked the kind of story Huysmans is telling.\n\nOctober 6, 2023\n\n3.5/5\n\nToo short and not enough substance to really be something great. Pretty simple and average story. I feel like Huysmans style will work better for his longer and better known books.\n\nNovember 19, 2017\n\nThis 1876 novella about a prostitute was Huysmans’ first. It was printed in Brussels and imported into France because the material and subject was too risqué. The story is more a study on Marthe and her life, booze, brothel and loves; it’s tragic and realistic. It is also unsentimental about the men buzzing around her, notable perhaps because there may be some autobiographical elements to it. The story includes STIs and death of new borns.\n\nThis edition includes some good notes and a couple of original pen drawings to illustrate the book. Apparently this was a rushed novel because Huysmans wanted this to be the first such study of a tart but fellow author Goncourt was also working on such a theme at the same time.\n\nQuote: “That suicide of intellect that is called ‘living together’ started to weigh heavily on him”\n\nMarch 29, 2020\n\nUne très belle langue qui entraîne le lecteur au cœur du tourbillon infernal qu’est la vie de Marthe. Cependant, je trouve que le roman se complaît beaucoup dans le plus ordurier : la boue et la misère ne nous sont pas épargnés, d’autant que le roman finit à la morgue.\n\nPar ailleurs, le point de vue adopté sur la « fille » qu’est Marthe est plus le point de vue des hommes qui la désirent et la repoussent tout à la fois car elle incarne le plaisir coupable que celle de la femme poussée à cette situation, ce qui me dérange pour un livre centré sur « l’histoire d’une fille ». Marthe est souvent abrutie, spectatrice passive de sa vie, entraînée par l’ivresse de sa vie mais le récit s’attarde peu sur ses ressentis et sa souffrance\n\nJanuary 5, 2018\n\nGoing with the majority here of a 3.5 rating. Glimpses of Huysmans' genius with some very satisfying passages/scenes, but overall it shows his rush to publish. Still, a valid effort, and one that helps expand our knowledge of the author and his times.\n\nNovember 5, 2023\n\nIt is a good novel and a nice piece of naturalist or realistic fiction, especially for a first novel, but no near the quality of Huymans later work.\n\nFebruary 17, 2009\n\nHuysmans earliest novel, thrown together quickly in order to beat Goncourt's novel of prostitution to market, and then banned in France as soon as it was released. Huysmans was criticised for the shocking subject matter of the novel, but even by the standards of its time, despite its title, it must have been relatively tame. What's most remarkable is his opulent turns of phrase, and his graphic, almost beautiful depiction of the ugliest parts of Parisian life: \"Green pustules or rosy flesh, it makes little difference to me; we touch them both, because they both exist, because the lout merits study just as much as the most perfect of men, because fallen women swarm in our cities and have a right there just as much as honest women.\"\n\nMarch 3, 2013\n\nI would have to agree with some of the other reviews that whilst a fascinating read, the whole story lacked any real depth & I did feel completely disengaged from those characters depicted. Even had Marthe herself had me despising her, that would have felt better than putting the book down, thinking a plain \"oh\". I didn't want to know more, because I didn't care. Did get a few interested looks on the train though - not sure if that was the title or the fact I was holding a real book in a sea of e-readers - the horror!\n\nJuly 4, 2008\n\nNot nearly as depraved as his “La-Bas”, Marthe is still quite a scandalously dark story. Being one of the first writers and books to address prostitution, it is no wonder that it caused a complete shock and outrage at it’s publication in the late 19th century. J.K. Huysmans, along with Emile Zola and Rachild are among some of my most favorite writers of the Decadent Movement in fin-de-siecle Paris.\n\nDecember 14, 2013\n\nFunny, tragic and light. Huysmann's first novels hints at the depth and skill that is to come in his later works, but his characters seem barely written in this one. Gorgeous description, but rushed as admitted in the introduction.\n\nSeptember 14, 2016\n\nOther reviewers are much more eloquent, so I shall be brief: this book, and Naturalism in general, seems to be about setting, Society, and the state of Nature, more than the characters themselves - for these, all are quite shallow."
