The story concerns the incestuous love of Giovanni and his sister Annabella. When she is found to be pregnant, she agrees to marry her suitor Soranzo. The lovers’ secret is discovered, but Soranzo’s plan for revenge is outpaced by Giovanni’s murder of Annabella and then Soranzo, and Giovanni himself is murdered by Soranzo’s hired killers. The play exhibits an eloquent and glowing sympathy for the lovers, despite the unlawful nature of their union.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Kathleen Kuiper."
