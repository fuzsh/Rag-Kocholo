The due date is Friday, so I'd love to get feedback. :grad: **\n\nWritten and set in the late 19th century, Bram Stoker’s epistolary novelDracula is a pivotal book in horror literature. Like most novels written by men, Dracula appeals more to the male audience and fantasy. Firstly, it is more than apparent that there are strong themes of female sexuality and its symbolism. The entire Victorian culture revolves around the suppression of women and their belittlement is evident in several scenes and events throughout the novel closing with an ultimate ‘moral’ of the story regarding these ‘New Victorian’ views. In addition, only a subtle factor of how grudgingly a woman’s reputation influences a man’s judgment and leaves very little room for superstition is addressed. In one case, Holmwood does not believe that Lucy is the kind of woman without maternal nature until he witnesses the actions of the infamous ‘Bloofer Lady’. Perhaps even the most controversial fact is that though gothic, Dracula has incorporated female sexuality as a hidden message of Christianity and redemption. The book is rather littered with Christian propoganda.\n\nIn Victorian society, women were constricted to very narrow gender roles. Essentially there are two paths, she can either be pure and virginal (or a mother/wife) otherwise she was regarded as a whore, and expendable in any circumstance. This ideal is represented through two of Dracula’s main characters, Mina and Lucy. Both these woman are inexplicably feminine (pure, naïve and almost dependant on their husbands) but each with one exception. Mina is a secretary for the “Children of Light”; secretarial duties were a man’s job then. And Lucy had three suitors, suggesting her subtle promiscuity and desire to break social confines. Despite those facts, both women essentially were the embodiment of the ideal Victorian woman, as says Van Helsing about Mina,\n\n“She is one of God's women, fashioned by\n\nHis own hand to show us men and other women\n\nthat there is a heaven where we can enter, and\n\nthat its light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet,\n\nso noble, so little an egoist…” [stoker, Ch14. Sept. 26]\n\nThe threat Dracula poses in transforming these women becomes a battle that lies upon women’s sexuality. Thus the real fear in the book is not darkness and vampiric nature but the loss of female innocence, a trait apparently extremely valuable and important to men. If Dracula succeeds in turning the ladies into vampires, this will fully release their sexuality and its expressions. This is shown as an evil in the novel perhaps because a woman that embraces her sexuality has obtains power. This power is significantly demonstrated in two passages of the book. First was the ‘rape’ of Harker by the three Weird Sisters. The women take on the dominating role that a traditional Victorian man is supposed to possess. Harker then becomes the ‘submissive’ and is easily overpowered by their seduction and his own temptation. The fact that Harker is both aroused and disgusted by the Weird Sisters shows his super ego battling his id. His primitive want to satisfy his “burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips” challenges his stature as a respectable Victorian man that should be repulsed and considerate of his wife, “lest some day it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain”. Yet, it is also an indication that men in general, enjoy this aspect of women, but purely to satisfy themselves. Thus men are not as cultured as they think, submitting to their id and indulging in the sublime - a claimed female trait. Thus in the book, most of the characters are berdache and not one way or the other. It is seen as proper for women to be chaste, but not acknowledged that this is merely a man’s primitive instinct to expresses territorialism to its extreme.\n\nStoker brings out many fears in Dracula, perhaps the most notable are feminaphobia (the male fear of being feminine) and gynephobia (fear of women in general). Both the characters and the male reader experience these fears, for the crossing of genders are simply unthinkable. This is best represented by the infamous vampire bite. The bite is gender ambiguous because is can be interpreted as a sexual symbol for both men and women; for men the act of plunging teeth is equivalent to penile penetration – for women the act of sucking blood is the taking of ‘life fluid’. The vampires themselves seem to be gender ambiguous as Dracula (appearing male) creates a ‘vagina’ in his chest by cutting it open for Mina to drink.\n\n“His right hand gripped her by the back of\n\nthe neck, forcing her face down on his bosom.\n\nHer white night-dress was smeared with blood,\n\n… a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a\n\nkitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it\n\nto drink.” [stoker, Ch. 21 Oct. 3]\n\nIn Dracula, female vampires represent women sexuality and vampirism merely masks man’s forbidden fantasies. Though Dracula makes up the horror aspect of the novel, the true ‘terror’ lies in the awakening of female sexuality.\n\nIn combination with the exertion of power if women were openly sexual, the men in the book fear for their own safety. They are selfish in that they must repress and prevent this liberating movement so that they will not be associated with the socially outcast. When analyzing the character of Lucy, even before becoming a vampire, she exerts an aura of subtle sexuality and boastful flirtatiousness. “Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all the trouble? But this is heresy and I must not say it” [stoker, Ch. 5 May 24] When writing this to Mina, it suggests that Lucy has a hidden desire to break out of the constraints of Victorian social expectations. Another piece of evidence that Lucy is a subordinate sexual woman is her statement of “My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them?” Perhaps this was simply Stoker catering to male readers and appealing to their secret fantasies, but this one line reduces Lucy to a frivolous Victorian woman who’s desire to be satisfied by men is as strong her desire to satisfy men herself.\n\nOnce transformed by Dracula, Lucy’s sexuality is unleashed. Her lust for both blood and sex are untamable and insatiable, much to he horror and disbelief of her three suitors and Van Helsing. One must understand that before death, Lucy was already a woman of quiet sexual expression and once after death, she begins to feed on humans. But not any regular human being, but Stoker makes it painfully clear that she stalks children, discrediting her of any maternal instincts.\n\n“With a careless motion, she flung to the ground,\n\n… the child that up to now she had clutched\n\nstrenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog\n\ngrowls over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and\n\nlay there moaning” [stoker Ch.16 Sept 29]\n\nThough never directly noted that Lucy sank her teeth into the children, tossing a crumpled child to the floor without any stain of conscience along with the reader’s imagination, condemns her to the equivalent fate/label. Looking back at Lucy on the brink of death, she seems to be fighting an inner demon (perhaps her potentially heightened sexual hunger) with her pure, innocent self. On one hand, she wants Holmwood “Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!” but in a moment of confliction, she quickly gives Van Helsing her dying wish, “Oh, guard him, and give me peace!”. This analogy of demon to sexual appetite seems to warn and try to remind female readers of the black and white boundaries of their current society. At this point in time, Stoker writes Dracula when the New Victorian Women are beginning to emerge (ex. woman suffrage).\n\nThen looking towards the staking of Lucy, this passage connotates a deep sexual meaning. This scene occurs near the end of the book, suggesting that killing Lucy, thus punishing her for being sexually forward, will restore Victorian order. After the feminization of Harker with the three weird sisters, Stoker tops that by killing Lucy with four men to return her purity. The person that actually stakes Lucy is her fiancé, Arthur Holmwood. This represents the consecration of their union – implying that Holmwood puts Lucy back into a position of monogamy and passivity.\n\n“… in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing\n\n… her destruction was yielded as a privilege to\n\nthe one best entitled to it … her face of unequalled\n\nsweetness and purity…” [stoker Ch.16 Sept 29]\n\nBefore her destruction, Lucy stands as a threat to male willpower and judgment. Therefore, Stoker has the four men mutilate and destroy her to reassure male readers that the women are back in their rightful place.\n\nThen, in considering Lucy’s best friend, Mina, she is almost the opposite of Lucy but still infinitely womanly. Where Lucy is seen as the innocent and playful, Mina is viewed as a practical, down-to-earth, figure. Unlike Lucy however, Mina is not described as physically beautiful or voluptuous. Mina is virtuous and the picture-perfect woman not because she seems to be asexual but because she uses her “New Woman” skills to service men (an underlying meaning that Stoker suggests to give), be it the Van Helsing gang or her husband. She is intelligent and useful to the men, which is perhaps the only reason she is spared at the end of Dracula. Stoker consummates Mina’s ethical merit by having her hand over her body and soul to the men if she would become an enemy. She asks of them to, “without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head, or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!” [stoker Ch.25 Oct. 11] In essence, Mina compares her fateful destruction to,\n\n“… when brave men have killed their wives\n\n… to keep them from falling into the hands of the\n\nenemy … did not falter … because those that they\n\nloved implored them to slay them … men's duty\n\ntowards those whom they love…” [stoker Ch. 25 Oct. 11]\n\nIn addition, she praises and pleads that they allow Jonathan Harker to kill her as Holmwood did Lucy. All the while, blushing at the request, again implying at the sexual connotation attached to the staking; reaffirming that the death of Lucy was undeniable sexual but “to him who had best right to give her peace…”[stoker Ch. 25 Oct. 11] (a right only to her fiancé, not simply to those who loved her since all three men loved her).\n\nPerhaps opposing yet enticing entities to Lucy and Mina are the three Weird Sisters. Undoubtedly, these women have strong sexual prowess and seduction as their weapons thus a high danger to men and their reasoning. In the drawing end of Dracula, Stoker brings these three women back into focus. When Van Helsing sought after them to destroy them, he even hesitated because “She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion.” [stoker Ch. 27 Nov. 5] This heightens fiercely the danger of women’s sexual liberty now that the knowledgeable and powerful doctor has started to succumb to their ‘dark’ power. In addition to their power and control, is the fact that the women total three. Three is a strong mythological number demonstrated by such examples as the three witches in Shakespeare’s MacBeth, the three witches of in the Greek myth of Perseus, the three infamous sirens, and the three fates. It is because of this strong number that the vampires are associated with folklore and myth. Thus not only is now the battle between man’s reason and female sexuality, but also one of modern human beings and ritually religious.\n\n“… holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh...” [stoker Ch. 27 Nov. 5]\n\nStoker practically bends over backwards to show the reader the repercussions of women who are sexually freer than what they ‘ought to be’ and that even though they are the most sinful creatures, in their destruction, they will give Christian redemption. Dracula himself represents the sole opposite of god. He is seen as a demonic creature and might as well be the embodiment of Satan himself with his pointed teeth, pronged ears and eyes blazing with “demoniac fury” [stoker Ch. 2 May 8]. In fact, Dracula is Wallachia word for Devil of which Stoker found this name from a book. [Elizabeth Miller Lecture Feb. 4, 2005].\n\n... [incomplete]\n\n** Gah. Ok. The good thing is, I finished the essay and I'm posting the very final version here.... now. :) Thank you again. **\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nWritten and set in the late 19th century, Bram Stoker’s epistolary novelDracula is a pivotal book in horror literature.

Perhaps even the most controversial fact is that though gothic, Dracula has incorporated female sexuality as a hidden message of Christianity and redemption. The book is rather littered with Christian propaganda. Thus, religious superstition is the only effective weapon against the vampires, for technology and advances in modern age has no solutions rendering those who depend solely on it, helpless.\n\nIn Victorian society, women were constricted to very narrow gender roles.

All the while, blushing at the request, again implying at the sexual connotation attached to the staking; reaffirming that the death of Lucy was undeniable sexual but “to him who had best right to give her peace…”[stoker Ch. 25 Oct. 11] (a right only to her fiancé, not simply to those who loved her since all three men loved her).\n\nPerhaps opposing yet enticing entities to Lucy and Mina are the three Weird Sisters. Undoubtedly, these women have strong sexual prowess and seduction as their weapons thus a high danger to men and their reasoning. In the drawing end of Dracula, Stoker brings these three women back into focus. When Van Helsing sought after them to destroy them, he even hesitated because “She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion.” [stoker Ch. 27 Nov. 5] This heightens fiercely the danger of women’s sexual liberty now that the knowledgeable and powerful doctor has started to succumb to their ‘dark’ power. In addition to their power and control, is the fact that the women total three. Three is a strong mythological number demonstrated by such examples as the three witches in Shakespeare’s MacBeth, the three witches of in the Greek myth of Perseus, the three infamous sirens, and the three fates. It is because of this strong number that the vampires are associated with folklore and myth. Thus not only is now the battle between man’s reason and female sexuality, but also one of modern human beings and ritually religious.\n\n“… holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh...” [stoker Ch. 27 Nov. 5]\n\nStoker practically bends over backwards to show the reader the repercussions of women who are sexually freer than what they ‘ought to be’ and that even though they are the most sinful creatures, in their destruction, they will give Christian redemption. Dracula himself represents the sole opposite of god. He is seen as a demonic creature and might as well be the embodiment of Satan himself with his pointed teeth, pronged ears and eyes blazing with “demoniac fury” [stoker Ch. 2 May 8]. In fact, Dracula is Wallachian word for Devil of which Stoker found this name from a book. [Elizabeth Miller Lecture Feb. 4, 2005]. As for the exchanges of blood, it seems to be a deviant of a sacred Christian ritual. But in a vampire’s case, blood is taken to grant immortality at the expense of your ‘soul’. But whether a person or vampire believes in Christianity or not, once destroyed they are ‘restored’ and thus, ‘saved’.\n\n“… red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive\n\nlook which I knew so well… in that moment of\n\nfinal dissolution, there was in the face a look of\n\npeace, such as I never could have imagined might\n\nhave rested there.” [stoker Ch. 27 Nov. 6]\n\nThe frequency of these Christian motifs occurs so often, that it is impossible to miss its implications. The major repellant of vampires, are crosses and Communion wafers which are undeniably the paramount symbols of Christianity. Referring back to the vampiric mimic of Christian rituals, the Christian rite of Communion is symbolic because in it, one must drink a blessed wine (representing blood of Christ) and then be gifted with everlasting yet spiritual life. But in disgracing this influential ceremony, vampires do not drink holy blood but human blood, thus not gaining an eternal sacramental life but merely an everlasting bodily life.\n\nIn order to support Christian meaning, perhaps Stoker tries to restore faith by the telling of Dracula. Thus, the only means of permanently destroying a vampire is by superstitious means, not by means of science and technology. To instill this evil creature as a reality in a reader’s mind will lead them to think that faith is the only solution. This method renders scientific discoveries pointless and useless.\n\n“… sitting at a little oak table where in old\n\ntimes possibly some fair lady sat to pen, …\n\nIt is the nineteenth century up-to-date with a\n\nvengeance… the old centuries had, and have,\n\npowers of their own which mere \"modernity\"\n\ncannot kill.” [stoker Ch.3 May 15]\n\nConstantly feminization appears hand in hand with a sense of hopelessness in which, here, Jonathan Harker expresses. This clash of technology versus religion is address here by Harker. When Dracula was written, it was the time of rising doubt. When scientific theories arose, it seemed to negate and make spiritual doctrines invalid. You could either believe one or the other and science was beginning to prevail. Thus to renew faith, it suggests that Stoker made it so that Mina and Seward’s rational attempts to thwart vampiric evil were incompetent. Only the techniques of Dr. Van Helsing, a deeply religious man, have the ability and means to destroy Dracula and his minions. In speaking, Van Helsing states, “…to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get…” [stoker Ch.18 Sept. 29] meaning all aspects of knowledge including ritualistic, historic and religious principles.\n\nIn closing, the powerful subject of female sexuality in Dracula is not a sole statement on its own. Stoker cleverly weaves it in between the failure in advancement of technology and Christian salvation. The novel has become a fairy tale in which there mature morals are expressed from ever page of its story. Women are to be naturally obedient otherwise chaos will reign, for only reputation is what a woman should depend on (that and their husbands). Secondly, in the progress of science, one should not forget the teachings of faith lest one day that knowledge is needed. Clearly, in the analysis of Dracula, these are the hidden meanings and implications a reader is subjected to. But here we are, a century later and chaos has not yet broken loose into the streets and science has indeed triumphed over frivolous beliefs in closet monsters, and the best outcome? The freedom women have gained and their celebration of female sexuality is embraced."
