        "text": "Emphasizing the peculiar, the perverse, the clandestine and the scandalous, this volume opens up a critical discourse on sexuality and visual culture in early modern Italy. Contributors consider not just painted (conventional) representations of sexual activities and eroticized bodies, but also images from print media, drawings, sculpted objects and painted ceramic jars. In this way, the volume presents an entirely new picture of Renaissance sexuality, stripping away layers of misconceptions and manipulations to reveal an often-misunderstood world. 'Sex acts' is interpreted broadly, from the acting out, or performing, of one's (or another's) sex to sexual activity, including what might be considered, now or then, peculiar practices and preferences and a variety of possibly scandalous scenarios. While the contributors come from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, this collection foregrounds the visual culture of early modern sexuality, from representations of sex and sexualized bodies to material objects associated with sexual activities. The picture presented here nuances our understanding of Renaissance sexuality as well as our own.\n\nThe idea that Gian Domenico Ottonelli was an art theorist writing in harmony with Pietro da Cortona is deconstructed by an examination of his primary career as a critic and guerrilla fighter against popular theater. He is the Italian counterpart to William Prynne in England and his Trattato sulla pittura is comparable to Prynne's Histrio-Mastix of 1633. All notions that he is a legitimate theorist of art or theater must be dismissed."
