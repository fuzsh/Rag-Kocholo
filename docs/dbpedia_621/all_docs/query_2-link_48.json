        "text": ".\n\nRifles & Spears was originally aimed at portraying actions set in 19th century ‘Darkest Africa’, though always with an eye on ‘other stuff’. However, it doesn’t (and hasn’t) been limited to Africa as really the rules cover any colonial theatre of the mid to late 19th century. Whilst not appearing on this blog before the Indian Mutiny has been a period of interest for sometime. In fact, in this post, I’m stopping by in India on the way to looking at using Rifles & Spears for the New Zealand (Maori) Wars.\n\nHowever, before I venture to the antipodes, I thought it might be a good idea to pop up some information on using Rifles & Spears (or Muskets & Tomahawks for that matter) for the Indian Mutiny, as there are a number of people in our club that have armies and have requested some suggestions on the period… not to mention I have a rather large collection myself….oh, I wish Iron Duke Miniatures was around 5 years ago!\n\nSo, to that end this small post detais some thoughts and information on using Rifles & Spears for the Mutiny. Included are some thoughts that equally apply to Darkest Africa or any other theatre suited to the rules theme and scope, particularly those aspects relating to cavalry and artillery This may prove useful to others who want give it go working with the Studio Tomahawks’ rules Muskets & Tomahawks. As the Mutiny is in the mid 19th century Muskets & Tomahawks can quite easily be used for that period without having to delve into the later issues of breech-loading rifles and machine guns. Therefore, anyone with a copy of Muskets & Tomahawks will be able to use any/all of these rules suggestions as they like…on to Delhi!\n\nIf ever a period of military history revolved around the acts of individuals, the Indian Mutiny is it. The heroic efforts of individuals, formed such a tapestry of tales with stories of bravery and heroics that truly defined a Victorian Hero – the boy’s own adventure stories never had a grander stage than the Indian Mutiny. Put together with battles a plenty along with acts of cinematic tales worthy of the best yarns one could tell, it all goes to provide an endless back drop to Queen Victoria’s most devastating war of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe uprising, predominantly in the Bengal Presidency, came from the culmination of a steady rise of discontent with British rule, resulting in the fabled ‘soiled’ cartridge affair which sparked the tinderbox, which was the Sepoy Rebellion. In this, the mutinous elements in India rose up against their former Sahibs. So sudden and unexpected was the uprising, characterized by terrible atrocities military and civilian alike, which gave the war a particularly nasty ‘edge’, the British Empire strained to save its jewel in the crown – it was unlike any other colonial conflict yet experienced by Great Britain, involving more troops than she sent to the Crimea. In the Mutiny, troops came from all corners of Victoria’s realm to re-establish order, providing a military menagerie untypical of Her Majesty’s ordered legions.\n\nTo the miniatures gamer, the period has much to offer. There were alot of localised actions with the British forming ‘Movable Columns’ that generally limited the overall size of forces engaged, resulting in many small to medium sized actions, with very specific objectives. The Mutineers also mustered their troops in a similar way, usually under the leadership of a charismatic personality. Numerous sieges and ‘last stands’ of desperate outposts combine to offer all manner of skirmish scale actions perfectly pitched at the scale of Rifles & Spears. Battles were fought using handfuls of British battalions against masses of mutineers – stirring stuff!\n\nThese forces were lead by very colourful characters on both sides and the uniforms look great. It’s possible to field a force where every unit looks different, but need not be so if a player prefers a more homogeneous look to his army. Where else can you have on the same field of battle Bengal Lancers, Sepoys, Sikhs and Elephants, along with Her Majesty’s soldiers, sailors and marines, including such venerable units as Rifle Regiments, Ghurkhas and Highlanders all mixed in with civilian volunteers – the mutiny offers variety with which few periods can compete.\n\nAlong with this cast of characters the war was fought in that most exotic of places – India. Battles raged through cities, villages, deserts and jungles; along the banks of the Ganges and at the foot of the Himalayas, the war provides a backdrop that simply shines. Also, in recent times, the information that was once hard to get is now plentiful. There are many vivid accounts of the war and more popular histories that provide all the information needed to fully appreciate the scope and struggle that the Mutiny entailed. Whilst not initially well catered for, the prolific range of Iron Duke Miniatures along with the established range from Mutineer Miniatures really provides all that an Indian Mutiny gamer could ask for.\n\nWhat follows are some ideas and thoughts on organising and portraying armies using Rifles & Spears or its ‘mother’ rule set Muskets & Tomahawks. I hope it is of some interest.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRifles & Spears – The Indian Mutiny\n\nRifles and Spears is a massed skirmish game and it is worthwhile keeping that in mind when depicting forces in the Mutiny. The game system easily handles 50-70 figures a side and thus can be seen to portray company level actions.\n\nThe nominal scale is 1 figure equals 1 man though it would not be unreasonable to increase this ratio slightly if wishing to represent forces in the order of a 2-300 man engagement. This would provide a good spread of troops if wishing to field different types, though in the Mutiny, ad hoc organisations were possible even at the very low level…so it all works out rather well.\n\nRifles & Spears is however, not a battle system. So whilst your troops might line up and look like they are in battlelines, every unit is capable of being deployed in ‘skirmish’ mode. In fact , this is the default condition for all units except those that can adopt a ‘formation’. This is represented in the rules by the Drilled trait which enables ‘firing line’ formation with its attendant pluses and minuses.\n\nThis formation is depicted in the standard Muskets & Tomahawks game by having all Drilled troops, mostly trained Regulars, as having a reduced fire number (5+ vs 4+) thus encouraging them to adopt a formation that delivers them optimal firepower ie firing line, which gives a +1drm when shooting. This same design mechanic works equally well for the Indian Mutiny.\n\nThe British Army was in a period of transition, ostensibly from the late 1830s to the early 1860s, by having all troops being able to adopt open/extended order light infantry roles, as well as still form up in close order to deliver volleys much as they had in Wellington’s time. This resulted in the traditional flank and centre company distinctions becoming obsolescent. The soldiers in the Mutiny were very much at the forefront of this process.\n\nTherefore, in Rifles & Spears you can use the concept of ‘aimed fire’ if drilled regulars. This allows troops to adopt either a volley fire style of shooting or a more individual ‘in your own time’ aimed fire role. We limit this ability to the Regular troop type only, reflecting the training involved to achieve this level of proficiency worthy of the additional +1drm fire modifier. Other non regular types may be given this ability on a case by case basis.\n\nThe introduction of the rifled musket greatly enhanced the utility of the later as the weapon itself leant itself to the concept of ‘aiming’ which is much more problematic using a smoothbore musket…if realistically possible at all, except at the shortest of ranges.\n\nThus the Mutiny as a gaming subject provides us with an interesting tactical evolution as far as the British forces are concerned. We have troops trained to both operate in drilled close order with both smoothbore and rifled muskets as well as the general adoption of extended order fighting as well. This gives us interesting tactical decisions to choose from and combinations to play with.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWhat the Mutineers lacking in tactical-technical innovation they more than make up for in shear variety in the forces and styles of fighting their forces can incorporate.\n\nThe mutinous Sepoy units, essentially behave in the manner of Wellingtonian redcoat infantry. They can form up and function as they had under their British sahibs but do not derive an aimed fire ability ie they are best deployed in firing line formation to increase their fire ability (from 5+ to hit to 4+).\n\nHowever, generally speaking we shall reflect that the Sepoys are not as proficient in small unit fire discipline as their British counterparts so we classify them as ‘Poorly Drilled’.This classification gives them all the usual benefits of a firing line formation but the reduced effectiveness in delivering crisp, sharp, controlled volleys like British infantry which is reflected by not prevising them with the -1drm to any target reaction test received from volley fire. The heavy losses modifier still applies should they be fortunate enough to deliver such execution on their target.\n\nStill allowing sepoys the drilled ability in the rules seems more than appropriate. Whilst the increase from 5+ to 4+ when shooting doesn’t seem significant the main benefit is that when negative modifiers apply the infantry do not rapidly reduce fire effectiveness by going from 5+ to 6+…so form up your sepoys to get the maximum fire potential from them! When coupled to the presence of an officer, nearby regimental colors and the usual bonus for unit size and formation, they can become quite resilient. If you disperse them and use them in an ad hoc light infantry role they will be less effective in both shooting and their willingness to pass reaction tests.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTypical sepoy units had a specialist light infantry company and these troops are best placed to function as traditional light infantry unless other non regular types are used in this role.\n\nOther non sepoy units are aplenty in a mutineer army. Ranging from excellent cavalry support, both light cavalry and the more ‘battle cavalry’ Bengal types, generally good artillery support and and kaleidoscope of irregular ‘wallah types’ being anything from armed civilians, Badmasher bandits or the more deadly Ghazi fanatics. All these types combine to provide a potent force mix in the hands of a wily Mutineer commander.\n\nAll these troops have unique elements that the unit entries show, however, it is worth touching on a couple of other ‘arms’ to highlight their effect in the Mutiny, as their role is likely to be more prevalent and we haven’t discussed such issues for Rifles & Spears just as yet…cavalry and artillery.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nCavalry\n\nCavalry in Muskets & Tomahawks naturally enough plays second fiddle to the multitude of infantry types in North America, which the rules are principally aimed to depict. For the Mutiny, horse and guns are common, as they are in certain theatres in Africa such as Egypt and the Sudan and Southern African temperate climates clear of the dreaded tsetse fly, ever the enemy of mounted forces.\n\nCavalry follows all the normal rules in Muskets & Tomahawks but we include some additional rules which, in our opinion, better reflect some unique elements of mounted forces. Even with our additions, there may be exceptions so these extras can be seen as ‘standard’ or ‘general’ cavalry additions where in fact some may not apply to certain cavalry types. To be fair, Muskets & Tomahawks was never meant to really handle cavalry heavy games and the treatment they have in the rules is entirely appropriate.\n\nFollowing on from those caveats we can take these rules essentially in the sequence of a charge. When cavalry charge they move into contact with a target just as normal. However the ‘terror’ of a mounted attack we shall take to be the same as that of a bayonet attack by troops in firing line as currently depicted in the game i.e. troops receiving a cavalry charge must test their reaction in phase 2 of the charge sequence.\n\nIf the target unit is a long firearm equipped infantry unit in firing line, attacked frontally, that pass their phase 2 reaction test, they then add +1 to their defence rolls in the first round of melee. This essentially reflects drilled troops deployed in a firing line using bayonet armed muskets and rifles. Infantry or artillerymen with small weapons such as carbines do not get this bonus.\n\nIf cavalry successfully win a melee then they get a bonus in the post combat ‘hack’, as this is where cavalry are at their most deadly. We give them a +1, however a +2 doesn’t necessarily seem unreasonable either…perhaps this could be reserved for certain cavalry types…it’s +1 for all just at the moment.\n\nFinally, we include an optional, but we think, useful rule once the melee is over. After combat is resolved the involved cavalry unit(s) are given a ‘blown’ marker. This will limit the next activation to recovery. This is essentially the same as the current ‘shaken’ rule which requires that a unit so marked uses its next activation to remove the marker before doing anything else…as the horses catch their breath and the riders their composure…both getting themselves sorted.\n\nThese rules taken as a whole emphasise the power of cavalry in the attack, the terror they can instill in the enemy, the effectiveness of their pursuit but vulnerability vs steady infantry and relative vulnerability in a post melee situation.\n\nBefore we leave the topic of cavalry it is worth noting that the proper use of cavalry will be in the sequencing (or play) of your activation cards. This will largely determine their success or possible failure in launching an attack. To defend against potential cavalry attacks, infantry players should always remember they have the option to use Vigilance in a turn to ‘hold fire’ which, suitably armed, could be devastating against a mounted charge…\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nArtillery\n\nArtillery in Rifles & Spears is more comprehensive than those types presented in Muskets & Tomahawks. Artillery in Muskets & Tomahawks plays a minor part in most games, much like cavalry, but is more prevalent in 19th century armies so needs a closer look.\n\nWhen surveying armies of the 19th century, particularly in India and Africa, we see the full spread of ‘technologies’. Not only do we need to take account of the 18th century style smoothbore artillery but also the introduction of ‘modern’ smoothbore artillery types of the Napoleonic era subsequent to the introduction of rifled artillery in armies by the mid to late Victorian era.\n\nFor our purposes using the sub-divisions of ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ will be in keeping with the existing Muskets & Tomahawks system plus the addition of siege artillery used in a field-gun role. By using these broad categories we can delineate modern from antiquated or excessively large weapons and their use in the game, whether they be rifled or smoothbore.\n\nIf we look at the heavy and/or antiquated guns first. Siege artillery will generally encompass weapons larger than 12pdrs (and the rifled artillery equivalent) which saw service at various times in a ‘field gun’ role, most notably in the Mutiny, though certainly in other theatres as well.\n\nThe first way we account for these behemoths of the battlefield is by the number of activations the weapons can undertake and also the sequencing of how the weapons are used. For antiquated weapons of the pre Napoleonic era and siege pieces such as naval guns of 18, 24 and 32 pound categories, which often found their way into the field such as the navy crews of the Royal Navy, we use the existing mechanic of two 1-action artillery cards placed in the deck which limits their firing in a turn to one shot ie one action to fire and another to reload.\n\nIt also limits any move potential to two actions per turn, reflecting their cumbersome nature. For very large ‘siege’ pieces these weapons gain an additional +1drm when conducting fire against buildings accounting for the destructiveness capability of these ‘heavy hitters’ along with the usual increased lethality of heavy artillery over smaller pieces.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nModern artillery encompass all the Gribeauval style cannons and their successor weapons of the 19th century, typically 7pdr to 12pdr in size. These weapons activate on their ‘troop type’ card, so a Regular artillery battery will have two 2-action cards per turn…doubling the number of activations over siege or antiquated weapons, enhancing their effectiveness. When given a limber these weapons become much more mobile and capable on the tabletop.\n\nAnother intended effect of activation by troop type is the ability to coordinate field artillery with other troops of the same class, something not as easy to do with a separate artillery activation card, thus an entirely regular force gains a good deal of coordination between the various arms within a player’s force.\n\nAll rifled field artillery is considered modern and hence more accurate and with greater destructive power reflecting the general advancement of targeting and ammunition capability when fired at anything but point blank range, where the smoothbore weapon retains their lethality of 3+ to kill whilst rifled weapons have a slighty reduced 4+ to kill..acknowledging that smoothbore weapons are generally more lethal when firing canister than their rifled equivalents.\n\nWhilst not entirely a precise model overall, this approach broadly rings true and works well enough within the constraints of the card activation system for a mass-skirmish game, which I think actually does a nice job of bringing these factors into play through elegant interaction of the game systems.\n\nAs with all things, exceptions can apply where a particular weapon could be classed as a hybrid or different class eg the British muzzle-loading 7pdr in use during the Zulu War would be a good candidate to count as a smoothbore for fire purposes even though it was a rifled weapon.\n\nBy applying the full suite of ways the game portrays troop types it can be seen that a Royal Navy gun battery of 18pdrs during the Indian Mutiny, who would be considered elite, get three three activations during play ie the two 1-action Artillery cards and a further action on the Forward Boys! Card for being elite. The guns themselves would need a bullock train to move the weapon and the 18pdr would be considered a heavy artillery piece with enhanced destructive power vs built up structures.\n\nSo there you have it, a brief overview of how some in game effects apply for representing troops for the Indian Mutiny using Rifles & Spears. The force lists below can be equally used for players with the Muskets & Tomahawks rule system…they work just as well.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nYou can download the Rifles & Spears unit data information here. These can easily be used with Muskets & Tomahawks as well with little adaptation.\n\n∇\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSome Background\n\nThe following information is a truncated version relating to some background and general unit information presented as a quick overview. You can find the original page here for details including uniform information. It is included here as a quick primer describing units, battles, relative locations, etc – the original webpage has uniform details not relevant to our discussion so is omitted… John French wrote the excellent Wargames Foundry Book “The British In India”, which is an invaluable resource for all Indian Mutiny gamers.\n\nFor players wanting another online resource of the conflict with a bit more detail there is some excellent info on this webpage and part two here that covers the period very well. The Indian Mutiny gamer is well serviced with the Mutineer Miniatures line of figures from which most of my collection was built, however it is likely that it will now be eclipsed in scope by the excellent and ever expanding line of Figures by Iron Duke Miniatures which are retailed by Empress Miniatures online store.\n\nIron Duke a Miniatures, owned and supported by Mike Snook, has somewhat transformed the Indian Mutiny in recent times. On his web blog there is wonderful background information, which combined with the brief details described in this post and weblinks, gives you most of what you need to know to get going before spending a cent on the many excellent books on the topic.\n\nThe Mutiny is now very well serviced with top quality miniatures from both these manufacturers and excellent historical background information… quite a boom time for Mutiny gamers.\n\nA Listing Of Actions, OB’s, And Uniform Data For All Combattants\n\nCompiled By John French\n\nMuch has already been written about the causes and the course of the Indian Mutiny. The idea here is to help the wargamer set up an army in one of the most colourful campaigns of the Victorian era.\n\nVarious troop types were involved on both sides. There were men from the regular British army as well as units of the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). Added to this were regiments of Sikhs, Gurkhas and Beloochis. Irregular units, including Punjabis, also fought alongside the British, the Royal Navy provided detachments, and cavalry could comprise both regular regiments as well as ad hoc units. Artillery ranged from HEIC Horse Artillery (from Bengal & Bombay Presidencies), to elephant-drawn siege guns.\n\nTransport included camels and elephants, a wide variety of carts, and palanquins or dhoolies (portable screened beds). There were lumbering armies with masses of camp followers and highly mobile forces of cavalry and horse artillery.\n\nOn the mutineers side were units of Bengal Native infantry and cavalry, many of whom retained vestiges of uniform and equipment. Also present could be badmashes (“riff-raff”) and civilians who attached themselves to the mutineers and who could arrive and disappear with equal rapidity. Frequently present were religious fanatics, Ghazis, who cared nothing for their own safety. Afghanis and various groups of tribesmen fought for loot, and several princes provided troops. They looked upon this as an opportunity to regain lost prestige. Camel gunners and large numbers of wall-mounted guns on city walls, as at Delhi, also add interest.\n\nBattles ranged from skirmishes to those involving many tens of thousands of combatants. There were sieges, storming parties and street clearances with house-to-house fighting (again as at Delhi). Terrain can include built-up areas, large plains, farmland and swamps.\n\nSome of the actions fought are listed below, although this is by no means exhaustive. Skirmishes against guerilla bands took place until December 1858, and Tantia Topi was not captured until April of 1859. Numbers involved in the fighting are approximate. The figures in brackets in the “place” column refers to the state where the action occurred. These are detailed at the foot of the list.\n\nDATE PLACE BRITISH MUTINEERS 1857 6-25 June Cawnpore (1) 240 plus 135 women and children 3,000 8 June Baduli-ki-Serai (1) 3,500 2 guns 30,000 30 guns 8 June-20 September Delhi 12,000 22 guns 40,000 40 guns – 100 wall guns 30 June Chinhut (2) 300 10 guns 6,300 16 guns 12 July Fatehgarh (1) * 1,300 8 guns 3,500 12 guns 15 July Aong (1) 1,130 8 guns 3,000 2 guns 15 July Pandi Nudi (1) 1,130 8 guns 2,000 16 July Maharajpur (1) 1,130 8 guns 5,000 4 guns 25 July – 3 August Arrah (3) 9 British /Europeans + 50 Sikhs relief force 216 + 3 guns 2,500 29 July Unao (1) 1,500 10 guns 6,000 19 guns 29 July Bashiratganj (1) 850 2,000 16 August Bithur (1) 1,000 8 guns 4,000 4 guns 24 August Nazafghard (4) 2,500 16 guns 6,000 19-26 September Lucknow garrison 1,700 – relief 3,179 + 3 gun batteries 60,000 10 October Agra (1) 2,600 7,000 11-26 November Lucknow relief 3,400 + 8 naval guns 60,000 23-24 November Goraria (5) 1,500 9 guns 15,000 16 guns 26 November Cawnpore 1,300 12 guns 3,000 6 guns 6 December Cawnpore 5,600 35 guns 25,000 40 guns\n\n1858\n\n3 February Saugor (Sagar) (5) 4,500 8,000 9-17 March Lucknow 31,000 104 guns 100,000 18 March Musabagh (1) 4,000 10,000 21 March – 5 April Jhansi (1) 4,500 11,000 22-30 March Khota (6) 1,500 5,000 1 April Betwa (5) 1,500 22,000 28 guns 15 April Azamgarh (3) 2,500 13,000 19 April Banda (1) 1,000 7,000 5 May Bareilly (1) 8,000 36,000 40 guns 6 May Kunch (1) 4,000 10,000 19-23 May Kalpi (Calpee) (1) 4,000 11,000 16-19 June Morar, near Gwalior (5) 4,000 8,000 17 June Kotah-ki-Serai (5) 3,000 10,000 20 June Jawra Alipur (5) 800 4,000 25 guns\n\n*Sometimes written “Futtehpore.” Many place names have several spellings.\n\n(1) Uttar Pradesh, India.
