Major Hobbs was taken prisoner owing to his remaining too long attending to the wounded; he led the first line of the assault with judgment and good sense. The services of Lieutenant Nicholson have been specially brought to my notice for attention to duty and the situation when others were inclined to deal with matters of less importance; I recommend him for special reward. I also recommend Private Montgomery for a Distinguished Conduct medal; after being wounded in one leg he continued fighting in the firing line until again wounded.\n\nBearer Company-Major Ricketts commanded, and did good service both at the time and in connection with the removal of the wounded.\n\nGuide-The services of Mr Chapman, who was so unfortunately killed, were of the greatest value; his intimate knowledge of the ground alone made it possible to carry out the operation. I sincerely trust it may be found possible to bestow on his widow some mark of recognition of his distinguished service.\n\nBELMONT, November 23, 1899.\n\nFrom Lieutenant General Methuen's despatch, November 26, 1899: -\n\nStaff Major General Sir H Colvile has already gained my entire confidence; nothing is ever likely to shake his coolness. Captain Bulfin, brigade major, on whose shoulders great responsibility rested, did admirable work.\n\nScots Guards (1st Battalion)-The greatest credit is due to Colonel Paget for the manner in which he carried cut his orders, and for the intelligent handling of his battalion when left to his own resources. I note with pleasure the valuable services rendered by Lieutenant-Colonel Pulteney, and the courage displayed by Lieutenant Bulkeley and by Lieutenant Alexander (General Colville says, \"Both insisted on going on after they were wounded\"). The 9th Brigade had taken a correct bearing, Lieutenant Festing leading, a duty he performed admirably, and I regret he was wounded.\n\nYorkshire Light Infantry-Major Earle's leading, knowledge, and coolness were most noticeable.\n\nRoyal Army Medical Corps-By 10.30 my division was in camp, by 1 all my wounded were in a comfortable house being carefully tended, by 5 p.m. next day the hospital train conveyed the less severe cases to Orange River, the graver cases to Cape Town. This is the most perfect work I have ever heard of in war, and reflects the highest credit on Colonel Townsend.\n\nFrom Major General Sir H Colvile's report:-\n\nStaff Captain G Nugent, ADC, and my Brigade Major, Captain Ruggles-Brise; the latter was entrusted with leading the two battalions to Gun Hill, a task in which he was handicapped by never having seen the ground by daylight.\n\nGrenadier Guards (3rd Battalion-Daring the assault on Gun Hill, Lieutenant and Adjutant Fryer, who was leading the men with extraordinary gallantry, was killed. Lieutenant Colonel Crabbe was also leading with great gallantry. 2nd Lieutenant Powell's leading was very noticeable.\n\nColdstream Guards (1st Battalion)-Lieutenant Colonel Codrington's battalion was well and correctly handled. Colonel Codrington draws particular attention to the skilful handling of his company by Captain Fielding, the coolness displayed by Lieutenant the Honourable C. Douglas-Pennant, and the complete control exercised over his company by 2nd Lieutenant Price Jones. 2nd Battalion-Lieutenant Colonel Stopford's battalion had less severe work than the others, but I consider its advance under fire was distinctly well performed. Colonel Stopford particularly calls attention to the services of Major the Honourable A Henniker-Major and Captain Shute.\n\nENSLIN, November 25, 1899.\n\nFrom Lieutenant Colonel Money's report, November 26, 1899:-\n\nStaff-Captain Bulfin and Lieutenant Taylor rendered me great assistance, and were near me at the final assault.\n\nYorkshire Light Infantry-Sergeant Waterhouse at a critical moment acted with great coolness, and shot down one of the enemy's sharpshooters, who had been doing great execution to our men advancing at a range of 1,150 yards.\n\nMODDER RIVER, November 28th, 1899.\n\nFrom Lord Methuen's despatch, December 1, 1899:\n\nStaff Lieutenant Colonel Northcott, who never left me, fell mortally wounded. The Army has lost one of the ablest officers in the Service, and I cannot express the grief his death has caused me. I personally bring to notice the value of Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes's service and Major Streatfield's service in sending forward reinforcements to Major General Pole-Carew, for on this movement the result of the evening's success depended. Captain Bulfin, Yorkshire Regiment, did his duty admirably. The valuable services of Captain Nugent, ADC, and Captain Ruggles-Brise are again noted.\n\nRoyal Artillery-Major Lindsay, 75th Battery, ignored a painful wound, and continued in command of his battery. Lieutenant Begbie, suddenly placed in command of his battery, led it, and brought it into action with great coolness. Captain Farrell, wounded a second time, continued to do his duty, having first placed a wounded man on one of the gun carriages. Wounded gunners and drivers continued at their duty. Lieutenant Rockford Boyd, on this, as on former occasions, showed himself reliable and capable of acting without orders.\n\nGrenadier Guards (3rd Battalion)-Major Count Gleichen, CMG, showed coolness throughout the engagement, especially in attending to the wounded under a heavy fire. Sergeant Brown and Private Martin, who helped him, were both shot. Captain H Bathurst, was of great value in rallying a number of Grenadiers and Coldstreams shaken by the fire. Lieutenant the Honourable A Russell showed great coolness in working the machine gun, which he did with marked success. Sergeant Major Cooke displayed remarkable coolness under fire.\n\nColdstream Guards-Major Granville Smith volunteered to find a ford, which he did in dangerous mud and a strong river. Captain and Adjutant Steele did excellent service during the day. Sergeant Major S Wright showed great coolness when a change of ammunition carts was being made, and was of great value at a critical time. Drill and Colour Sergeant Price rendered excellent service at Belmont and Modder River, whilst commanding half a company. Drill and Colour Sergeant Plunkett collected 150 men, and helped the 9th Brigade crossing the river under Captain Lord Newtown Butler. Lance Corporal Webb twice asked leave to go into the open to bind up the wounds of a Grenadier; under a heavy fire he succeeded in his object.\n\nScots Guards (1st Battalion)-I call special attention to Colonel Paget's cheerfulness and intelligence under the most trying surroundings. He draws attention to the good services of the Master of Ruthven.\n\nNorthumberland Fusiliers-Major the Honourable C Lambton rendered invaluable assistance to brigadier. Lieutenant Percival managed with great difficulty to establish himself with a small party on a point near railway, from which, by his judgment and coolness, he was able to keep down fire of enemy, many of his small party being killed. Lance Corporal R Delaney, Privates J East, Segar, and Snowdon, under very heavy fire picked up and brought in a wounded man of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Private Smarley, No. 1 of Maxim detachment, showed great coolness and judgment when wounded.\n\nYorkshire Light Infantry-Lieutenant Colonel Barter rendered invaluable assistance to brigadier.\n\nRoyal Army Medical Corps-Captain Moores, although wounded in hand, said nothing, but continued his duties.\n\nMAGERSFONTEIN, December 10, 11, 1899\n\nFrom Lord Methuen's despatch, February 15, 1900.\n\nStaff I have to express my appreciation of the clear orders given out, and the careful arrangements made by Colonel Douglas, ADC, my chief staff officer, for the attack. Major General Sir H Colvile showed coolness and judgment throughout two trying days. The same remark applies to Major General Babington. Lieutenant Cuthbert, Scots Guards, my extra ADC, showed considerable coolness in taking a message from me to the Gordon Highlanders; a volley was fired at him, killing his horse; he took off wallets and saddle and returned, letting me learn from others how he had behaved. Major Maberley, RHA, acting galloper to Major General Babington, after rallying 30 or 40 men of different regiments, was severely wounded. Captain Ruggles-Brise, brigade-major, and the ADC; of Sir H Colvile's staff, again earn honourable mention, not only in delivering orders, but also for their clear and accurate description of the position.\n\n9th Lancers-Major Little, in the firing line, did good work all day. Lieutenant Allhusen did good work with Maxims.\n\n12th Lancers-Lieutenant Colonel the Earl of Airlie did excellent work with two dismounted squadrons, when good service was much needed. Lieutenant Macnaghten did good work with Maxims.\n\nMounted Infantry-Major Milton, commanding, behaved gallantly, and was shot three times before he died; he was making a successful effort to rally some men of the Highland Brigade.\n\nRoyal Artillery-I again recognise the business-like manner in which Lieutenant Colonel Hall, commanding RA, carries out his duties in the field. Major Bannatine Allason performed splendid work, and assisted greatly in checking enemy on right of our attack.\n\nColdstream Guards-Lieutenant Colonel Codrington, commanding, though wounded, insisted on remaining in command of his battalion till nightfall. Major the Honourable W Lambton refused to be carried because the bearers were exposed to fire. He remained on the ground 37 hours without food or water. Major the Marquis of Winchester was killed whilst displaying almost reckless courage. Sergeant Wilkinson, 2nd Battalion, showed courage in collecting ammunition. Corporal Bartlet, 2nd Battalion, under a very heavy fire went 1,000 yards to get a stretcher for Major Milton. Corporal Webb, 2nd Battalion, showed great courage in taking messages.\n\nScots Guards-Captain the Master of Ruthven performed, as on several other occasions, valuable services.\n\nRoyal Highlanders-Corporal Gayner, rallying men, and by his example encouraging his comrades.\n\nHighland Light Infantry-Majors Garland and Honourable H Anson performed good service throughout the day. Captains Richardson and Wolfe Murray were wounded, but remained in the front with their companies. Captain and Adjutant Cowan, DSO, gallantly led and rallied has men, and was killed at close quarters. Sergeant Major Stevens rallied men. Sergeant McDonald's gallant behaviour specially brought to notice for carrying messages to guns and to medical officer under heavy fire. Lance Corporal Fraser, Sergeant Piper Boss, and Piper McLelIan specially brought to notice for their cheery conduct under fire and helping to rally men. Captain Shaul brought to notice for several specific cases of bravery when in charge of stretcher bearers of battalion. Privates Peat, Richmond, and Stewart did excellent service and set a good example to their comrades.\n\nSeaforth Highlanders-Captain Honourable Forbes Sempill rallied and led his men straight up to the front in a conspicuous and gallant manner. Lieutenant Grant did good service, taking messages to the front from Colonel Hughes-Hallett under a heavy fire. Lieutenant Lindsay, very gallant and conspicuous behaviour when in charge of Maxim gun. Band-Sergeant Hoare, conspicuous for his coolness and gallantry during the day in helping Dr Ensor to succour wounded; personally carried Captain Fetherstonhaugh (wounded) on his back some 800 yards to dressing station.\n\nGordon Highlanders-Captain K B Towse recommended for special reward by his commanding officer for his gallantry and devotion in assisting the late Colonel Downman when mortally wounded in the retirement, and when close up to the front of the firing line; he endeavoured to carry Colonel Downman on his back, but finding this not possible supported him till joined by Colour Sergeant Nelson and Lance Corporal Hodgson; the conduct of these non-commissioned officers is described as admirable.\n\nArgyll and Sutherland Highlanders-Captain A Campbell displayed great coolness throughout the day, and helped to dress the wounds of Captain Gordon under a hot fire. Lance Corporal Ray and Private Phipps specially mentioned by Major General Babington as having helped him to rally men and take them into the firing line. Private Johnson helped to remove a wounded Highlander from the front under a heavy fire.\n\nRoyal Army Medical Corps-Major O'Donnell and Lieutenant Delap were indefatigable in attending wounded under fire. Lieutenant Douglas showed great gallantry and devotion, under a very severe fire, in advancing in the open and attending to Captain Gordon, Gordon Highlanders, who was wounded; also attending to Major Robinson and other wounded men under a fearful fire.\n\nCape Medical Corps-Private A Bettington, Cape Mounted Rifles (attached) helped to remove a wounded Highlander from the front under a heavy fire.\n\nSTORMBERG, December 10, 1899.\n\nLieutenant General Gatacre in his report, January 19, 1900, brings the following to the notice of the Commander-in-Chief: -\n\nRoyal Field Artillery-Major E M Perceval, 77th Battery, though severely wounded, continued to command his battery till the end of the day.\n\nNorthumberland Fusiliers (2nd Battalion)-2nd Lieutenant Duncombe-Shafto, Band-Sergeant J Stone, Colour Sergeant A Landen, Private G Benson.\n\nCOLENSO, December 15, 1899.\n\nIn a despatch from Chieveley, December 16, General Buller brings the following cases of distinguished services in the field to notice:-\n\nAt Colenso, on December 15, the detachments serving the guns of the 14th and 66th Batteries RFA had all been either killed, wounded, or driven from their guns by infantry fire at close range, and the guns were deserted. About 500 yards behind the guns was a donga, in which some of the few horses and drivers left alive were sheltered. The intervening space was swept by shell and rifle fire. Captain Congreve, Rifle Brigade, who was in the donga, assisted to hook a team into a limber, went out and assisted to limber up a gun; being wounded he took shelter, but seeing Lieutenant Roberts fall badly wounded he went out again and brought him in. Some idea of the nature of the fire may be gathered from the fact that Captain Congreve was shot through the leg, through the toe of his boot, grazed on the elbow and shoulder, and his horse shot in three places. Lieutenant Honourable F Roberts) King's Royal Rifles, assisted Captain Congreve; he was wounded in three places. Corporal Nurse, RFA, 66th Battery, also assisted. I recommend the above three for the Victoria Cross.\n\nDrivers H Taylor, Young, Petts, Rockall, Lucas, and Williams, all of the 66th Battery RFA, rode the teams; each team brought in a gun. I recommend all six for the medal for Distinguished Conduct in the Field.\n\nShortly afterwards Captain H L Reed, 7th Battery RFA, who had heard of the difficulty, brought down three teams from his battery to see if he could be of any use. He was wounded, as were five of the thirteen men who rode with him; one was killed, his body was found on the field, and 13 out of 21 horses were killed before he got half-way to the guns, and he was obliged to retire. I recommend Captain Reed for the Victoria Cross.\n\nNon-commissioned officers and men, 7th Battery RFA, recommended for medal for Distinguished Service in the Field: Corporals A Clark (wounded), B J Money, Acting-Bombardier J H Reeve; Drivers C J Woodward, W Robertson (wounded). W Wright (wounded). A C Hawking, J P Lennox, A Nugent (killed), J Warden, A Felton (wounded), T Musgrove, Trumpeter W W Ayles (wounded).\n\nI have differentiated in my recommendations, because I thought that a recommendation for the Victoria Cross required proof of initiative, something more, in fact, than mere obedience to orders, and for this reason I have not recommended Captain Schofield, RA, who was acting under orders, though I desire to record his conduct as most gallant.\n\nFrom General Buller's despatch, December 17, 1899: -\n\nRoyal Field Artillery-2nd Lieutenant Holford, 14th Battery, displayed particular gallantry.\n\nDevon Regiment (2nd Battalion)-Colonel Bullock behaved with great gallantry; he did not receive the orders to retire; his party defended themselves and the wounded of the two batteries till nightfall, inflicting considerable loss on enemy, and it was only when surrounded that he consented to surrender, because enemy said they would shoot the wounded if he did not.\n\nCOLESBERG, December 15, 1899, to January 25, 1900\n\nFrom Lieutenant -General French's despatch, February 2: -\n\nStaff-Major Generals J P Brabazon, CB, and B A P Clements, DSO, have rendered me much assistance, and I am anxious to acknowledge their valuable services. Colonel T E Stephenson, Essex Regiment, has, on several occasions, rendered me valuable assistance; his leading of the infantry brigade during the reconnaissance in force on January 25 was excellent. Major D Haig, 7th Hussars, Acting AAG and CSO, has shown throughout the same zeal, untiring energy, and consummate ability as have characterised his conduct and bearing since the very commencement of the campaign (in Natal), during the whole of which time he has acted in this capacity; I have had occasion to speak of him in a similar sense in former despatches. Captain J Vaughan, 7th Hussars, my senior ADC, has acted for the past two months as DAAG, and has done excellent service in that capacity. Major G O Welch and Captain T D Foster, ASC, DAAG's, have shown untiring zeal and energy in supervising the transport and supply services, which, in a force operating as this has been, on a very wide front, and often many miles from a railway, has been an arduous and difficult task. I am much indebted to Major Honourable H A Lawrence, 17th Lancers, for the great assistance he has. rendered me in having established such an excellent system of intelligence; his good work has been attended with the best results. Captain P A Kenna, VC, 21st Lancers, provost-marshal, has performed his duties with zeal and energy: he has on more than one occasion shown an excellent example of bravery by going personally to the assistance of wounded men. Lieutenant S L Barry, 10th Hussars, divisional signalling officer, has performed excellent service. Lieutenant Sir J Milbanke, Baronet, 10th Hussars (wounded), and Captain J F Laycock, Nottingham Yeomanry, my ADC's, have displayed the same marked zeal, energy, and conspicuous courage as I have commented upon in former despatches.\n\n1st Life Guards-Major G Carter has at various times shown considerable skill and resolution as squadron commander in the field, and has done valuable service.\n\n2nd Life Guards-Lieutenant C Champion-de Crespigny, when in command of a patrol on January 19, showed great gallantry, and an excellent example to his men, in bringing wounded men out of action.\n\n6th Dragoon Guards-Colonel T C Porter has frequently been employed as a brigadier and in command of advanced posts; he has always carried out the tasks allotted to him with much skill, zeal, and indefatigable energy. Major F S Garratt has at various times shown considerable skill and resolution as squadron commander in the field, and has done valuable service.\n\n6th Dragoons-Major E H H Allenby has at various times shown considerable skill and resolution as squadron commander in the field, and has done valuable service. Major M F Rimington, employed in command of a Corps of Guides, has rendered me much assistance since he has been attached to this command.\n\nRoyal Horse Artillery-Lieutenant Colonel F J W Eustace, officer commanding BA, Cavalry Division, has displayed conspicuous skill and sound judgment in his handling of the artillery, which has played so important a part throughout these operations; he has been of the greatest help to me, and indefatigable when the most severe strain was thrown upon him and his command. He has received much help from his adjutant, Captain A D'A King, who is deserving of great commendation. Majors Sir J H Jervis-White-Jervis, Baronet, and B Burton deserve the highest credit for the manner in which they have worked their batteries throughout these operations; in face, very often, of a most galling fire from the enemy's well-concealed and protected artillery positions, they have uniformly maintained an excellent practice with most telling effect on the enemy. Lieutenants E F Talbot-Ponsonby, J W F Lamont, J B Aldridge, and W G Thompson (wounded and a prisoner), deserve mention for signal services they have performed with their guns.\n\nRoyal Field Artillery-Major A E A Butcher, who joined with his battery of field artillery soon after the bombardment of Colesberg was commenced, with great energy and perseverance succeeded in placing two field guns on the top of a steep hill called Coles Kop, 800 ft high, and from this commanding position has inflicted great damage and loss on the enemy.\n\nRoyal Engineers-Brevet Major A G Hunter-Weston has commanded the field equipment, RE, attached to the Cavalry Division, and has acted as CRE to this force. I am much indebted to him for many services performed, not the least of which has consisted in his maintaining a perfect system of telegraphic and telephonic communication throughout the force on a front of 38 miles. He has received able assistance from Captain C O C Bowen, Lieutenant C Russell-Brown, and 2nd Lieutenant H L Mackworth.\n\nMounted Infantry-Captain H De B De Lisle, DSO, Durham Light Infantry, has done excellent service in temporary command; his action in the engagement of January 4, and the reconnaisance of the 25th, was of special value. Captain A H S Hart, East Surrey Regiment, and Lieutenant C Saunders, Dorset Regiment (attached), on two occasions made valuable reconnaissance sketches of important parts of the enemy's position with very indifferent cover in a nullah (down which they had crept), from a galling fire. Captain H L Buck-Keene, Oxford Light Infantry, Lieutenants Honourable C B Clegg-Hill, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and L K Smith, Boyaf Scots, have done specially good service.\n\nYorkshire Regiment-Lieutenant Colonel H Bowles has done very good service at critical times in command of his battalion. Captain M H Orr was dangerously wounded during the attack on New Zealand Hill, which post he commanded with great credit.\n\nRoyal Berkshire Regiment-To Major F W N Mc-Cracken and the four companies serving with this force is the successful attack on Colesberg on January 1 principally due; I cannot speak too highly of this officer's coolness, courage, and intrepidity, or of the gallantry and discipline displayed by his officers and men in making the night assault which he led so well; the regiment have intrenched themselves, and have established such an excellent system of defence that the enemy's fire, although nearly unceasing, is practically harmless. In connection with this work, I bring forward the names of Lieutenant A G E Bingley, acting adjutant, and Captain Sir T E S Pasley, Baronet. [Marker p10/1]\n\nNew Zealand Mounted Infantry-Major A W Bobin, commanding, deserves special mention for the frequent occasions upon which he and his men have performed signal service during these operations.\n\nNew Zealand Mounted Rifles-On January 15, in Boer attack on Stinger's Farm, which was held by one company Yorkshire Regt, and one company New Zealand Mounted Rifles, Captain Orr, Yorkshire Regiment, who was in command, was badly wounded, and the Sergeant Major killed. Captain W R N Madocks, RA (attached), saw the critical situation of the Yorkshires, and that they were practically without a leader'; with the greatest promptitude he took a few of his men to the west side of the hill, and rallied the troops holding it; be caused them to line their intrenchments and stem the enemy's advance; he then jumped up, gave the order to fix bayonets, and charge down the hill, upon which the Boers immediately turned; the greatest credit is due to Captain Hadocks and his New Zealanders for their prompt action.\n\nRoyal Army Medical Corps-Major H G Hathaway has been attached to my staff since my arrival at Naauwpoort; he has been unremitting in his attention to the sick and wounded; he has on several occasions and at critical times carried messages to commanders of units in the ield, and his services have been most useful\n\nSPION KOP, January 24-27, 1900\n\nFrom Sir R Buller’s despatch on the withdrawal, January 30:-\n\nRoyal Engineers (Pontoon Troop)-I must specially mention Major Irvine, and his men of the Pontoon Troop, who were untiring. When all men were over, the chesses of the pontoon bridge were so worn by the traffic that I do not think they would have lasted another half-hour.\n\nVAAL KRANTZ, February 6-8, 1900\n\nFrom General Buller's despatch of February 8, detailing the operations from January 26:-\n\nRoyal Field Artillery-Lieutenant T M Archdale, 78th Battery, specially mentioned for the manner in which he withdrew the battery waggons under a heavy enfilade fire, which struck two out of the three waggons and several horses.\n\nRoyal Engineers (Pontoon Troop)-Major Irvine, and the officers, non-commissioned officers and men deserve much praise.\n\nDurham Light Infantry-Lieutenant Colonel Woodland, Brevet Lieutenant Colonel FitzGerald, Captains McMahon, Barter, and Gumming, and Lieutenant Cochrane, Colour Sergeants Waiton, Johnson, Williams, Shea, Noble, Tilley; Sergeants Crump, Thomas, Iles; Corporals Kelly, Pratt; Privates Hall, Allien, Ismay, Miller, Nicholson, Stansfield.\n\nRifle Brigade-Lieutenant Colonel Norcott; Majors H F M Wilson, Lamb; 2nd Lieutenant Boston; Sergeant J Brooke; Acting Sergeant J Alderson; Privates S Molloy (since died of wounds), T Perry.\n\nRoyal Army Medical Corps-Lieutenant J J W Prescott specially mentioned for his care of the wounded in despite of a heavy fire.\n\nKIMBERLEY, September 13, 1899, to February 15, 1900.\n\nFrom Lieutenant Colonel Kekewich's despatch, February 15:-\n\nStaff-I wish to place on record the brilliant services of the late Brevet Major (local Lieutenant Colonel) H S Turner; in him the Army has lost a most valuable officer; he was a great organiser, full of energy, and possessed of real ability and courage; he was the principal organiser of the Town Guards, and acted as my staff officer, carrying out his duties with marked success under great difficulties; ... he commanded the mounted troops in numerous reconnaissances and sorties, and I cannot speak too highly of the manner in which he conducted them and loyally carried out my orders. Captain (local Major) W A J O'Meara, RE, my intelligence officer, carried out his many duties to my entire satisfaction, … and is, I consider, a most hardworking and capable staff officer; ... he also successfully carried out the duties of Director of Army Telegraphs; I cannot praise his good work too highly. Lieutenant (local Captain) D S Maclnnes, RE, worked out most carefully and constructed with marked ability and success the engineer operations for the defence; on Major Turner taking over command of mounted troops, cannot speak too highly of the manner in which he earned out his heavy and very responsible duties.\n\nRoyal Garrison Artillery-Major (local Lieutenant Colonel) G D Chamier commanded the artillery in the siege operations; he has carried out his very responsible duties my satisfaction, and the efficient and mobile condition of the artillery is greatly due to his energy; his advice has always been of the greatest assistance to me.\n\nRoyal Engineers-Lieutenant R L McClintock has done good work, both in the field and in the fortress.\n\nLoyal North Lancashire Regiment (1st Battalion)-Major (local Lieutenant Colonel) W H E Murray was in command of half the battalion and the Infantry Reserve daring siege, and performed his duties with success; also rendered valuable service in connection with supplies. Captain T H O'Brien was in command of a very important section of the defences; he performed his responsible duties to my entire satisfaction. Lieutenant F W Woodward did excellent work as signalling officer, and after Lieutenant and Adjutant Lowndes was wounded he also took over duties of acting adjutant Lieutenant C de Putron did excellent work as assistant signalling officer; also performed duties of brigade transport officer to my entire satisfaction. Lieutenant (local Captain) W Clifford commanded mounted infantry detachment, and had much hard work in connection with patrolling duties in early days of siege; has subsequently performed duties of acting adjutant Kimberley Light Horse with marked success; his conduct in action on many occasions has been most distinguished (wounded November 28). 2nd Lieutenant A McC Webster commanded armoured train in reconnaissances and sorties in neighbourhood, and displayed excellent judgment on all occasions. Sergeant Major E C Mudge, Sergeants H Herbert, H Helland, Corporal J Hopwood are deserving of mention for good work.\n\nArmy Service Corps-Captain (local) Major) H V Gorle had an exceedingly onerous task to fulfil in arranging for victualling and supply of garrison and 50,000 people in the town; I cannot speak too highly of his zeal and resource. Corporal F Benwell has done excellent work, and is worthy of special promotion.\n\nRoyal Army Medical Corps-Lieutenant C J O’Gorman was the only officer of his corps here, and in consequence had much hard work and responsibility; I consider him a very valuable officer.\n\nCape Police-Commissioner (local Lieutenant Colonel) M B Robinson assisted me in every way in his power; his duties have been many and various, and he has carried them out to my entire satisfaction. Inspector (local Major) F H Elliot performed the heavy duties of staff officer to the mounted troops with much tact and zeal; has shown much gallantry in action on numerous occasions.

Captain (local) More, resident railway engineer, organised most effectively the railway employees into a paid division for the armoured train and a division for the Guard; his energy and resourcefulness were conspicuous throughout; the armoured trains, defence railway, search-light, etc, were made under his supervision.\n\nNursing staff-The work done by the lady nurses was beyond all praise. Miss Hill, the matron of the Victoria Hospital, was assisted by a number of lady volunteers, in addition to her regular staff, consisting of Mrs Pannister and Miss Gamble. Mother Superior Teresa and eight Sisters of Mercy also worked in the hospital. Lady Sarah Wilson, assisted by other ladies, managed the Convalescent Hospital. Miss Craufurd managed the Women and Children's Hospital. These ladies worked with the greatest zeal and self devotion throughout. The protracted strain of heavy work, frequently carried out under fire (Lady Sarah Wilson was wounded), told on most of them, Miss Hill being at one time prostrated by overwork. It was largely due to their unremitting devotion and skill that the wounded, in so many cases, made marvellous recoveries, and the health of the garrison remained so good.\n\nCivil-Mr C Bell, resident magistrate and civil commissioner, had entire charge of native affairs, and managed the chiefs with great tact, and very successfully at a critical time, when they were inclined to sit on the fence and see which was going to win, and were being tempted with offers from the Boers; as magistrate he also rendered me great assistance. Mr F Whlteley's (Mayor of Mafeking) services were invaluable; in a most public-spirited manner he took up, at my request, the difficult task of arranging for the feeding and housing of all the women and children, and carried out their management with marked success; he was much assisted by Mr Rowlands, who gave up his house, garden, water supply, etc, to be used by the laager. Reverend W Weekes also rendered valuable service in assisting in management of women's laager, etc Mr Howat, post and telegraph master, with his staff, Messrs Campbell, Simpson, and M'Leod, did invaluable work in connecting up and in keeping in communication with headquarters the whole of the defence works by telephone. Mr Heal, the jailer, carried out most arduous and difficult duties most loyally and efficiently (killed by a shell, May 12). Sergeant Stewart, Cape Police, rendered valuable service as head of civil police. Mr Millar, head of refugees' laager, displayed much zeal and did excellent work in management of refugees' laager and defences, etc\n\nFor Special Recognition-In a despatch of June 6, General Baden-Powell recommends the following from amongst the above:-\n\nLieutenant Colonel Walford; Majors Panzera, Godley, Vyvyan, Lord E Cecil; Captain Ryan; all of whom did exceptionally good service.\n\nCapt FitzClarence, for personal gallantry, recommended for the VC; Captains Marsh and Ashley-Williams, and Lieutenant Lord C Bentinck, good service in action; Major Anderson, medical service; Major Goold-Adams and Mr C O H Bell, civil and political services.\n\nMr F Whiteley (mayor of Mafeking), eminent civil services; his reward would be highly appreciated by the townspeople, as recognition of their share in the defence.\n\nThe following ladies for hospital services: Miss Hill, Mother Teresa, Lady Sarah Wilson, Miss Crauford; latter also for attending wounded Boers under fire on May 12.\n\nSIR G WHITE'S RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nSir G White, in his despatch, dated Ladysmith, December, 2, 1899, brings to notice the following as being \"eminently deserving of reward\": -\n\nThe late Lieutenant General Sir W Penn Symons, KCB, I cannot too strongly record my opinion of the energy and courage shown by this distinguished general officer in the exercise of his command, until he was mortally wounded in the action at Talana Hill, near Dundee, October 20; in him the country has lost an officer of high ability and a leader of exceptional valour.\n\nMajor General Sir A Hunter, KCB, DSO, Chief of the Staff. The services of this officer have been of the very highest value to the State; his zeal is indefatigable, and he has carried out the business of the force under my command so as to relieve me of all anxiety; he is equally good in the field, and has the gift of carrying with him all with whom he is brought in contact; I have every confidence in recommending this officer for advancement as one fitted for the highest commands.\n\nMajor General J French, commanding the cavalry, rendered me most valuable assistance; he commanded the troops engaged at Elandslaagte, where his dispositions resulted in the most decisive victory; I consider his services have merited very special recognition.\n\nBrigadier General J Yule succeeded to the command of the Dundee force when Major General Sir W Penn Symons was wounded, and had a difficult duty to carry out; he conducted the retirement of the force from Dundee to Ladysmith with marked success.\n\nBrigadier General O Wolfe-Murray, commanding lines of communication, is an officer of great administrative ability, and has done his work excellently well; he has been specially selected for this most important post from the confidence felt in him, and, as it is one that entails hard work and is not as popular as employment in the front, I think the value of the service should be exceptionally recognised.\n\nColonel I Hamilton, CB, DSO, has acted as brigadier-general in command of a brigade since my headquarters have been established at Ladysmith; I have made a special recommendation in favour of this officer for the manner in which he led the infantry at Elandslaagte on October 21 and consider him an officer of special ability who is well fitted for higher rank and command.\n\nColonel B Duff, ISC, has been my assistant military secretary, and has discharged the duties of the office with marked ability and success; his advancement will be a benefit to the Service, and he is well fitted for the highest staff appointments.\n\nBrevet Colonel E Ward, CB, ASC, AAG (b). I cannot speak too highly of this officer; his forethought in collecting supplies in Ladysmith while railway communication was open with the sea at Durban has enabled me to occupy the position here with perfect confidence that the garrison could not be starved out. When the force originally at Dundee was thrown back on Ladysmith, having had to abandon the supplies provided for it, Colonel Ward's provision was ample, even for the extra strain thus thrown on the supply, as well as to meet the necessity of finding rations for the civil population; his power of work and resources are most marked, and he has won the confidence of all. I consider him an officer of the highest administrative ability, and recommend him most strongly for recognition.\n\nColonel C Downing, commanding RA, has been my adviser on all artillery matters, and I count myself fortunate in having had the assistance of such an experienced and highly-educated artillery officer.\n\nColonel W Knox, CB, colonel on the staff, Ladysmith, has, from the appointment he holds, been left in command of Ladysmith on all occasions when the field army has gone out; his services have been very valuable,\n\nColonel W Royston, commanding Natal Volunteer Force. The services which Colonel Royston and the forces under his command have rendered to the State and Colony have been of the very highest value; in him, I have found a bold and successful leader, and an adviser whose experience of the Colony and of the enemy has been of great value to me; employed on arduous duty, from the commencement of the campaign in touch with the enemy, I have found him prompt and ready for every emergency; he and his force reflect the highest credit on the Colony of Natal.\n\nColonel J Dartnell, Chief Commissioner Natal Police, rendered valuable services to the late Lieutenant General Sir W Penn Symons and to Brigadier General Yule when the Dundee column fell back on Ladysmith; his advice and experience were of the highest value, and I found him always ready and willing to help me in any way in his power.\n\nBrevet Colonel Sir H Rawlinson, Baronet, Coldstream Guards, DAAG, has acted as AAG since this force was formed, and has proved himself a staff officer of very high ability; he has great power of work, and carries out his duties pleasantly and thoroughly; he is also a most valuable staff officer in action, and possessed of a quick eye and great dash; I recommend him for advancement.\n\nLieutenant Colonel R Exham, Royal Army Medical Corps, PMO, has had an anxious time in the charge of the sick and wounded of this force, and has done everything in his power to meet the medical requirements of the various phases of the present campaign; his zeal and assiduity are worthy of recognition.\n\nRoyal Field Artillery-The services of the artillery have been so valuable that I have special pleasure in recommending Lieutenant Colonels J Coxhead and E Pickwoad, commanding brigade divisions. I consider the following have well earned special mention:-Majors J Dawkins, 13th Battery; W Blewitt, 21st Battery; C Goulburn, 42nd Battery; A Abdy, 53 Battery; J Manifold, 67th Battery; F Wing, 69th Battery.\n\nMajor S Rice, RE, acting as CRE, has been indefatigable in the discharge of his duties, and his services have been most valuable in preparing the entrenched positions occupied by the garrison, and in other matters connected with this particular branch.\n\nMajor E Altham, Royal Scots, AAG, Field Intelligence, has had a very difficult office to fill. I consider has has done all that was possible; he has kept me informed of the enemy's movements, as well as changes, in his strength and dispositions. I have a very high opinion of his ability and aptitude for the particular branch in which he is employed.\n\nMajor D Henderson, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, DAAG, Field Intelligence, is a most painstaking and reliable intelligence officer; he possesses boldness, discretion, and reticence, and is an officer of high promise.\n\nMajor W Adye, Royal Irish Rifles, DAAG, Field Intelligence, has proved himself an officer of a most adventurous spirit in reconnoitring and reporting on the enemy's positions, and his services have been valuable to me.\n\nMajor H Morgan, DSO, ASC, Assistant Director of Supplies, rendered most valuable service in disembarking and entraining the first reinforcements that arrived in Natal, and hurrying them on to the front.\n\nThe following carried out the duties of their departments with advantage to the State and credit to themselves:-Veterinary Lieutenant Colonel I Mathews, PVO; Majors W Savile, RA, Army Ordnance Department.; A Murray, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, who acted as staff officer to Brigadier General Yule during retirement from Dundee; Brevet Lieutenant Colonel H Lawson, BE, AAG, lines of communication and commanding at Durban; Major S Grant, RE, special service.\n\nRailway Administration-This, under David Hunter, CMG, was most excellently carried out, and was worked most harmoniously and successfully in concert with the military and naval officers.\n\nExcellent Service-Colonel C E Beckett, CB, AAG; Lieutenant Colonel R W Mapleton, Royal Army Medical Corps; Major C Hamilton, RA, who has been acting throughout as DAAG on my Headquarter Staff; Major H Mullaly, RE, DAAG; Brevet Major A King, Royal Lancaster Regiment, ADC to Major General Sir A Hunter, KCB, DSO; Captain F Lyon, RFA, ADC; Captain J Young, RE, railway staff officer; Captain F Tatham, Natal Mounted Rifles; Reverend E Macpherson, BA, senior chaplain, Church of England; Reverend O Watkins, acting Wesleyan chaplain; T Bennett, resident magistrate, Ladysmith; D Giles, resident magistrate, Upper Tugela magistracy; Conductor W Ashmore, Indian unattached list; Quartermaster Sergeant E Morton, Corps of Military Staff Clerks; Sergeant P Burke, Staff Clerk Section, ASC; Guides A Allison, T Loxton, and P Greathead, Natal Corps of Guides.\n\nThe following were brought to notice by general officer commanding and officers commanding units: -\n\n4th Dragoon Guards (attached to 5th Dragoon Guards)-Captain G Mappin.\n\n5th Lancers-Major A C King, Lieutenant and Adjutant H H Hulse.\n\n7th Hussars-Major D Haig; Captain R G Brooke, DSO\n\n11th Hussars-Lieutenant P Fitzgerald.\n\nRoyal Field Artillery-Captain W Thwaites, 53rd Battery\n\nRoyal Engineers-Captain G H Fowke; Corporall H Rawlinson; Sappers S Hudson, C Spurling.\n\nDevon Regiment (1st Battalion)-Major M C Curry; Captains W Lafone, H L Ravenshaw (adjutant); Lieutenants J Masterson, H Field; Colour Sergeant G Palmer.\n\nSomerset Light Infantry-Captain J Vallentin.\n\nLeicester Regiment (1st Battalion)-Lieutenant B Weldon.\n\nScottish Rifles (1st Battalion) (attached to 2nd Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps)-Lieutenant N Tod.\n\nKing's Royal Rifle Corps (1st Battalion)-Lieutenant Colonel R Gunning (killed in action); Captain and Adjutant H Blore (killed in action); 2nd Lieutenant R E Reade rendered himself conspicuous by his gallant service during the attack on Waggon Hill, January 6, 1900.

[Marker p17/2]\n\nMajor General Sir A Hunter, who acted as my Chief of the Staff, is an offieer of well-known reputation. I cannot speak too highly of him, whether for the performance of staff duties or for bold leading in the field; he is a most loyal and efficient staff officer, and I recommend him for advancement with the utmost confidence, being well assured such a step would be for the good of the State.\n\nMajor General F Howard, commanding 8th Brigade and in charge of Section B of defences, has proved himself a careful and able administrator; the works constructed in his section were exceptionally strong and well maintained.\n\nColonel I Hamilton, commanding 7th Brigade and in charge of Section C of defences, has during whole of operations been in charge of the most exposed and most extended front, including the immense position of Caesar's Camp and Waggon Hill, over four miles of perimeter. I cannot speak too highly of his indefatigable zeal in organising the defence of his front, and in keeping up the hearts of all under him by his constant and personal supervision; his leadership on January 6 was the most marked factor in the success of the defence.\n\nColonel W Knox, colonel on staff in charge of Section A of defences, exercised the command entrusted to him with great zeal and skill. The works constructed on his front were models of semi-permanent entrenchment, laid out from the commencement on a pIan which enabled him to strengthen them day by day until they became practically impregnable; he is an officer of fine nerve and a strong disciplinarian. I trust his services may be adequately rewarded.\n\nColonel W Royston, commanding Natal Volunteer Forces, and in charge of Section D of defences. I can only repeat the high praise which I had the pleasure to bestow on Colonel Royston in my despatch of December 2. He commanded Section D in an admirable manner, and with his force, though much reduced in numbers by casualties and disease, continued to the end to perform invaluable service. He is an officer exceptionally suited to his important position as commandant of the Natal Volunteer Forces, and I trust he may receive some suitable reward.\n\nMajor General J Brocklehurst continued to command the Cavalry Brigade until the horses became useless from starvation; in all cavalry actions round Ladysmith his personal gallantry was conspicuous.\n\nColonel C Downing, commanding RA, did all that a highly-trained specialist couid do to assist me, both as regards the employment of his batteries as mobile units and also in their distribution and action when it became necessary to demobilise them and place the guns in fixed epaulments; he is an officer in whose knowledge and judgment in artillery matters I have every confidence.\n\nMajor S Rice, commanding RE, was indefatigable in his exertions both by day and night, and showed considerable skill in laying out works and in giving to commanders of sections of the defences that advice and assistance in their construction which the trained officers of the Royal Engineers can so ably afford.\n\nBrevet Colonel E Ward, CB, ASC, AAG (b). As the siege continued and the supply difficulties constantly increased, his cheerful ingenuity met every difficulty with ever-fresh expedients; he is unquestionably the very best supply officer I have ever met, and to his resource, foresight, and inventiveness the successful defence for so long a period is very largely due; he is exceptionally deserving of reward, and I trust that he may receive tne advancement which his services have merited.\n\nColonel B Duff, ISC, assistant military secretary, performed the duties of his office with his characteristic ability and zeal; he also took a prominent part in the general staff duties of headquarters, in which his services were equally valuable; this officer is fitted for the highest posts.\n\nColonel R Exham, Royal Army Medical Corps, did all that a PMO could do in organising the medical services under circumstances of exceptional difficulty, and with personnel and materiel both inadequate for a siege of such long duration, accompanied by such a great amount of sickness.\n\nLieutenant Colonel R Mapleton, Royal Army Medical Corps, in charge of Intombi Hospital Camp, was placed in a most exceptional position, in charge of a neutral camp, where maintenance of discipline in the ordinary way was impossible, but in face of all difficulties he did everything possible to maintain sanitation of the camp and to ensure the well-being of sick and wounded.\n\nVeterinary Lieutenant Colonel I Matthews, Army Veterinary Department, PVO, did excellent work in maintaining: so far as want of proper forage would admit, the efficiency of all animals belonging to the force; he was a very valuable adviser on veterinary matters both to myself and to general officer commanding Cavalry Brigade.\n\nBrevet Lieutenant Colonel Sir H Rawlinson, Baronet, Coldstream Guards, DAAG, who officiated throughout the siege as AAG (a), is a staff officer of great ability and activity, with a wonderful eye for the topography of the country; his constant observations of enemy s positions and movements were of much value to me in forecasting their intentions; he is well worthy of advancement.\n\nBrevet Lieutenant Colonel H Lawson, additional AAG (a), is a staff officer of the highest ability and the soundest judgment, and rendered me most valuable service.\n\nMajor B Altham, AAG for Intelligence, has had to contend with all the difficulties inseparable from intelligence work under the limitations imposed by siege conditions; all that was possible under these conditions he has done, and I consider him an excellent intelligence officer in every respect.\n\nBrevet Major H Henderson, DAAG for Intelligence. Towards the latter end of the siege Major Altham was attacked by enteric fever, and Major Henderson assumed charge of the Field Intelligence Department.; he is a bold and accurate reconnoitrer, and the intelligence he brought back was always reliable; whether as a subordinate or as head of Field Intelligence Department. he has always afforded me the greatest assistance. I recommend him for reward.\n\nMajor C Hamilton, DAAG (a), has done a good deal of most useful work, and has shown himself a Staff officer of high promise.\n\nMajor W Hawkins, Director of Army Telegraphs, was indefatigable in maintaining electric communication between my headauarters and all portions of defence; the service thus rendered was of highest value, and conduced greatly to the successful defence.\n\nMajor G Heath, in charge of Balloon Section, is a bold and enterprising aeronaut, and rendered useful service; the constant watch which he kept on enemy's movements being a source of much disquiet to them.\n\nMajor W Savile, Senior Ordnance Officer, conducted the duties of his department with zeal and ability.\n\nColonel J Dartnell, Chief Commissioner, Natal Police, possesses an exceptional knowledge of the Colony of Natal and of native character; I am greatly obliged to him for the advice and assistance which he has always been ready to afford me, of which I have availed myself freely, and which I have found of the highest value.\n\nMagistrates-MrT Bennett, Resident Magistrate, was placed by me in charge of the civil camp at Intombi, and performed much good service in strictly enforcing the conditions on which I was permitted by Commandant General Joubert to maintain that camp. Mr D Giles acted as resident magistrate during Mr Bennett's absence, and was of great assistance in maintaining discipline among the civil population, both European and native.\n\nChaplains-Reverends E Macpherson, O Watkins, T Murray, and Father Ford, senior chaplains of the Church of England, Wesleyan, Presbyterian, and Roman Catholic denominations respectively, showed the greatest zeal and self-sacrifice in their attention to the sick and wounded as well as in their ministrations to those in health.\n\nEspecial Thanks are due to Lieutenant Colonel St J C Gore, 5th Dragoon Guards; Major E C Knox, 18th Hussars.
