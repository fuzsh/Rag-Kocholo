        "text": "Gallantry Awards – Courage and Sacrifice\n\nOur medal collection is not just a collection of medals.\n\n‘These intolerably nameless names’, as Siegfried Sassoon referred to them, should never be forgotten or ignored, and yet they cascade so relentlessly that they are often difficult to grapple with; within a very short space of time we are inclined to switch off; we soon start to lose our awareness of individual names as we become overwhelmed by the sheer torrent of them; our senses simply become overloaded to the point where we are only aware of the enormity of what stands before us. We can no more get to know the men behind the names than we can get to know people by reading their names in a telephone directory, and yet it is possible to breathe life into ‘these intolerably nameless names’ by uncovering and telling their stories.\n\nWhy not discover the story about the person behind the medal by selecting from any of the lists of recipients belonging to a medal below:\n\nAbout the information\n\nCurrently, we only have limited information available for the various awards shown.\n\nAs it takes many hours to research an individual to the level of detail that we aim to provide, it is a work in progress to cover the many records, and awards, that are missing.\n\nAll of these records contain information that has come from an original source, which in turn could be from a multitude of sources (The National Archives, The London Gazette, Regimental War Dairies etc).\n\nSometimes the information, from these sources, about the same person is slightly different, so an individual record may not appear to be exactly as you were expecting it to be.\n\nThe difficulties arise when soldiers ‘flesh out’ their stories, filling the gaps in their personal experiences with information from other sources. These inaccurate anecdotes find their way into general histories, only to be absorbed and re-told, creating a ‘feedback loop’ of misinformation.\n\nMany a war story, widely repeated and acquiring the repetition and status of ‘historical fact’, is found to stem from a single unsupported anecdote.\n\nWe have tried to include as much information as we can so that when you view a record, you will see not only the record information but also information on the regiment, campaign, battle they fought in, items of interest that are in the online collection etc, all painting a picture of what it was really like for the individual that just a name by itself can’t achieve."
