        "text": "Rachel Chazin Halperin, J.D., L.M.S.W., has been working as an advocate for underserved and vulnerable populations for the last 20 years. Appointed as CEO in 2021, she oversees every aspect of Legal Services of the Hudson Valley.\n\nRachel joined LSHV in 2014 as the Deputy Director and was promoted to Chief Program Officer in 2016. In that position, she oversaw all aspects of the program delivery, including the nine local offices. In her role as CEO her priorities remain steadfast in the belief that everyone should have the right to legal counsel regardless of their socio-economic status and that LSHV is an organization with an anti-racist and social justice mission.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Rachel worked for four years as a staff attorney and then supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia where she represented low-income residents in housing, family, domestic violence, and public benefits cases. In 2004, Rachel became the Legal Director of My Sisters’ Place, the largest domestic violence service provider in Westchester, NY.
