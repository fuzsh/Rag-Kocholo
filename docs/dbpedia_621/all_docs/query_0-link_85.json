        "text": "424. The Rommel Papers\n\nedited by B H Liddell-Hart\n\nThis is a smorgasbord of legendary Nazi general Erwin Rommel's own thoughts and those of some who knew him. I say \"Nazi\" rather than \"German\" because Rommel was once the commander of Hitler's bodyguard. The book charts Rommel's growing disillusion with his leader and his eventual forced suicide on Hitler's orders. By far the best bits of the book are Rommel's recollections of the French campaign of 1940 and the war in the Western Desert 1941-1942. These give an excellent insight into how one of the top German practitioners of armoured warfare operated and why he did what he did the way he did it. Rommel intended to write a book about his experiences in the Second World War and these chapters are very polished drafts. The rest of the book is a mish-mash of letters home, memorandums and the recollections of one of his chief sidekicks, G Fitz Bayerlein and Rommel’s son Manfred. The latter two are not entirely satisfying but their inclusion gives the book some narrative continuity. The book was edited, and footnoted, by the once highly regarded British military writer Basil Liddell-Hart. He also interviewed a number of surviving German generals after the war and was keen to make a case for them being great admirers of his work prior to World War Two. Either they indeed were or the generals knew when some flattery and soft-soap might pay off and they told the British writer what he wanted to hear. Perhaps in this book Liddell-Hart was too keen to accept Rommel's own excuses and version of events but this book is still worth reading.\n\n423. The Patrol\n\nby Ryan Flavelle\n\nThis Canadian book about the war in Afghanistan was a pleasant surprise and it's a pity I took so long to get around to reading it. I'd put it as one of the two best books I've read about Canada in Afghanistan, the other being The Taliban Don't Wave (Review 141). It's notable that both were written by frontline soldiers. Too many of the others are love letters to the Canadian Army written by journalists; I guess they know what sells. The Patrol, perhaps not surprisingly, is centred on a week-long patrol through Taliban territory in Kandahar province in 2008. Flavelle was the company commander's radio operator. He was also a reservist and in civilian life a university student. Flavelle readily admits to not being the greatest soldier and in fact describes himself as geek. But he was there and tells his tale well. The combination of fear, danger, boredom and physical exhaustion make for a realistic picture of life in an ordinary infantry section. He is also reflective and honest. It all makes for a good read - and with luck will provoke some thought and reflection on the part of the reader.\n\n422. Churchill and the Admirals\n\nby Stephen Roskill\n\nThe Royal Navy's official historian for the Second World War, Captain Stephen Roskill, takes a look at the often thorny relationship between Britain's prime minister during the conflict and the senior officers of the Senior Service. Those who thought that as former First Lord at the Admiralty in both World Wars Churchill had some kind of affinity with the Royal Navy will have their eyes opened by this well-informed book. Roskill knew many of the British admirals featured in the book and their staffs, he even served under a few of them, and he also had an access to official documents unavailable for one reason or another to other historians. Churchill was not always a good picker of men and had many impractical and unrealistic ideas.: Not always an easy man to work with. The first few chapters are concerned with Churchill's first stint at the Admiralty during the First World War, including the Gallipoli fiasco. During the Second World War, Roskill singles out the Far East, including Singapore, and the invasion of the Dodecanese islands off Turkey as two of Churchill's major errors. But there were many, according to Roskill, and Churchill could prove vindictive, particularly to those admirals he felt lacked offensive spirit. His meddling often proved a menace but those who had the right approach and a strong argument could often deflect Churchill. This a fascinating look not only at Churchill but the internal politics of the Royal Navy.\n\n421. Gurkha\n\nby Colour Sergeant Kailish Limbu\n\nIt might be best to start off by saying what this book is not. It is not a history of the Gurkha regiments of the British Army. Nor is it the story of how a Nepalese boy from a remote hill village rose to the rank of Colour Sergeant. The book focuses on 30 days in 2006 spent manning an isolated and almost constantly besieged police compound in the heart of Taliban country. More than that it is about a corporal's war in Afghanistan and as such it makes for interesting and worthwhile reading. The book gives an excellent insight into how the Gurkhas see themselves and view combat. The author uses to device of a keen would-be protege to allow Limbu to recount his childhood and the rigorous selection process involved in joining the Brigade of Gurkhas. I say \"author\" because text is actually copyrighted by an A R Norman rather than Limbu. Perhaps because the subject is Nepalese, the reader is spared the synthetic squaddie-speak of all too many recent ghost-written rank-and-file accounts of Britain's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I would say this is a worthy addition to the canon of modern British military memoirs.\n\n420. Mud, Blood and Poppycock\n\nby Gordon Corrigan\n\nA former senior Royal Gurkha Rifles officer attempts to puncture many of the myths surrounding the First World War , which in the general modern British consciousness was both futile and a case of \"lions led by donkeys\". Corrigan will get little argument from me when it comes to Britain having very little choice when it came to entering the war against Germany. Nor would I disagree with his general contention that the British commanders did the best they could in very difficult circumstances - though perhaps he is too kind to the first commander of the British Expeditionary Force, Sir John French. And he could easily have found several senior officers who served under Aylmer Hunter Weston, who was almost example of the type of general who populates British of popular imagination, who would have had some legitimate criticisms of him. Corrigan explains that the realities of the military partnership with France meant offensives across ground that favoured the German defenders went on far longer than made sense. But Corrigan may have over-egged the pudding sometimes in his enthusiasm. The chapter that causes the most concern is the one that looks at the over 300 British military executions. While he correctly points out that almost a third of those shot were repeat offenders, his contention that no mistakes at all were made his harder to accept. What human enterprise is 100% error free? And although JFC Fuller, whose opinion Corrigan quotes, did spend some time in the trenches he was a staff officer and not the experienced frontline commander implied. This should be a fascinating read for anyone looking for an antidote to the pervading myth-laden version of the conflict peddled in Britain today.\n\n419. Napoleon and Wellington\n\nby Andrew Roberts\n\nThis book could well be titled \"A Tale of Two Egos\". Highly readable British historian Andrew Roberts takes a look at the changing attitudes of Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington to each other over the years. It is an interesting approach and Roberts pulls it off. The book is not a biography of either man but a fascinating glimpse at the characters of the pair who came within a few miles of each other at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 but never met. In the early years both appear to have taken a respectful interest in the other's career, despite their public pronouncements, but over the years following Waterloo this changed. The touch-paper for Napoleon's change of heart seems to be his erroneous belief that Wellington was behind his exile to St Helena. For Wellington the tipping point appears to have been Napoleon's decision to leave money to an a man who tried to shoot the British general dead. Wellington emerges far from the modest man he is often portrayed as, but he kept his later poor opinion of the former French ruler out of the public domain to ensure his own victory at Waterloo would seem all the more remarkable. Napoleon came to believe his defeat was the fault of everyone but himself. He often comes over as more of a mafia-style gangster than a social and military visionary. This proved to be a good and worthwhile read.\n\n418. Rob Roy\n\nby WH Murray\n\nThis is a highly readable account of one of the most famous Highlanders in history. How true it is is another question. WH Murray was better known for his excellent guide book to the West Highlands and writing about hillwalking than as a historian. He appears to have avoided falling for many of the legends but he takes a far more charitable view of the old rogue than academic historian David Stevenson (Review 370). For example, Murray believes young Rob was at the Battle of Killiekrankie while Stevenson thinks not. The first half of this book is short on actual fact about Rob but gives an excellent picture of life in the Highlands of the late 17th Century and the lives led by the clan leaders. I think Murray may have been over-generous in his assessment of Rob's character and prowess and under-estimates his duplicity but his claims are well worth considering. It is also clear that the script-writer for the Liam Neeson 1995 film leant heavily on this book.\n\n417. Air Force Blue - The RAF in World War Two\n\nby Patrick Bishop\n\nTop British military writer Patrick Bishop makes no claim that this is a history of the Royal Air Force 1939-1945. Instead he looks at the RAF through the lens of those who served in it in a bid to capture the temper of the times. But the overall picture is not ignored because it is needed to put the events described in context. Bishop is not uncritical of the policies of the air force brass; both before and during the conflict. But he seems to believe that the RAF was the best of the three armed services and cites the fact that the Americans respected it far more than the Army or the Royal Navy. The first few chapters look at the Royal Flying Corps and the inter-war years. Most branches of the RAF get a chapter to themselves, Fighter Command, Bomber Command, Coastal Command and the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. There are also chapters on experiences in the Middle and Far Easts. Bishop's selection of experiences is sure-footed and interesting. Bishop had already written several books focusing on the RAF in World War Two, including The Fighter Boys and the Bomber Boys, but he seems to have found a number of fresh and unjustly neglected voices to help make his points.\n\n416. The Age of Fighting Sail\n\nby C S Forester\n\nPerhaps author CS Forester, creator of fictional Napoleonic seaman Horatio Hornblower, felt more comfortable with the British-American war of 1812-14 than he did with the German Second World War pocket battleship Bismark (see Review 336) when it came to forays into non-fiction. This is a far better book. Despite the title, the book is not a wide-ranging look at sea warfare in the Nelson era. Instead, Forester focuses in on what the Canadians call \"The War of 1812\". But most Canadian books focus on the land campaign and the British prefer not to discuss the war at sea against the Americans. Forester makes a strong case for the Royal Navy being outclassed both in the quality of its vessels, officers and crews. The Royal Navy, he argues, was simply over-stretched and did not have enough skilled crewmen to man the guns or work the sails. The results were predictable. Though the Americans did not win every battle, they won enough of them to worry the British, who had been labouring under the impression that they had a God-given right to naval dominance. Forester has written a very readable account of real-life battles which could just have easily been fought by his fictional Hornblower. He does a good job of giving the lay reader an idea of just how tricky it was working with wind and tide to actually bring the ships into action.\n\n415. Who's Who in Military History\n\nby John Keegan and Andrew Wheatcroft\n\nThis book is part of the prestigious Routledge Who's Who series: but personally I wouldn't trust it as a source for an 'O' Grade History exam. Who knows why respected British military historian John Keegan agreed to let his name be used. Andrew Wheatcroft is a well known academic and historian. The copyright notice also includes his wife Janet, a gardening writer. The book runs from 1543 through to the First Gulf War in 1991. There were a lot of entries for people I didn't know a lot about. But sadly, I wouldn't entirely trust any of the entries. For example, contrary to what this book claims, the Black Watch was not formed after the 1745 Battle of Culloden; the British commander at Majuba in 1881 was not Paul Methuen but George Colley; and Capt. Louis Nolan of Charge of the Light Brigade fame was not an aide de camp to Lord Lucan. How many more stupid mistakes are there in this book? I don't know and that's why I wouldn't trust it.\n\n414. barrage: the guns in action\n\nby Ian V Hogg\n\nIt would appear that the good folks at the Purnell's Illustrated History of the Second World War series agreed with me that Ian Hogg's contribution The Guns 1939-45 focused too much on the technical aspects of the weapons (Review 397) and not enough on how they were used. In this companion book in the series, known as Ballantines Illustrated History of World War II in the USA, has a look at gunnery techniques during the conflict. And Hogg, a former Master Gunner with the Royal Artillery, knows his stuff. He served in Europe and the Far East during the war and also in the Korean War. He laces the book with anecdote and hands-on insights. The book kicks off with developments in gunnery during the final years of the First World War and the lessons learned and misunderstood. Then he focuses on the Western Desert, Italy and the Rhineland campaign of 1945. There is a chapter on Soviet gunnery but Hogg readily admits that when he wrote the book in 1970 there was much that was not known about the subject. This book is probably best read along with The Guns 1939-45.\n\n413. Turncoat\n\nby Stephen Brumwell\n\nBritish military historian Stephen Brumwell casts a dispassionate eye on one of the most vilified men in American history - Benedict Arnold. Arnold's treachery during the American War of Independence, perhaps more accurately termed 'The First American Civil War', is widely believed in the United States as being motivated by pure greed. But as a British historian writing of time when most white people in North American regraded themselves as British, Brumwell is able to take a more nuanced approach and provide a more sympathetic reason for Arnold's change of side. Brumwell starts the book by putting Arnold's narrowly foiled attempt to turn the key Rebel fortifications at West Point over the British into context and explains how this could have ended what was in reality a very un-civil war in North America. The Eighteenth Century wars in North America are Brumwell's area of expertise and he is an accomplished researcher. He admirably resists the temptation to slow down the story by including non-essential details which would demonstrate the amount of painstaking research which went into the book. Brumwell's Arnold is not a particularly nice man but by his own standards he was an honourable man. Some of the best bits of the book come when Brumwell delves into the murky world of Eighteenth Century espionage. This book was obviously written for the American market but I fear not enough Americans will read it and too few Britons will be interested in this twisted tale of treachery.\n\n412. The Royal Air Force - An Illustrated History\n\nby Michael Armstrong\n\nI have never seen this book sold in Canada for anywhere near the cover price. It is always in the bargain bins. That could be because it is a bit pedestrian. It perhaps falls between too many stools. It is not that lavishly illustrated. Sometimes it seems more concerned with internal service \"housekeeping\" than anything else, with exhaustive lists of which squadron flew which aircraft under what squadron number and when. The book is dominated by the Second World War. Perhaps this is fair comment because the RAF was never bigger in terms of personnel and aircraft. And it is not uncritical of the RAF leadership or various British governments. Author Michael Armstrong is in fact Air Chief Marshal Michael Armstrong, a former apprentice who became a pilot and later one of the RAF's top brass. So, his observations should be taken seriously. However, he may just be too much of an insider and product of the RAF. Sometimes the book reads more like a PhD thesis. Was it a bargain? Yes, for the price I paid for it. But I didn't take the bait even when it was in the bargain section but got it at a library sale. As I say Armstrong may have tried to satisfy too many conflicting readerships. It had too few insights for my taste. Oh, the book was first published in 1993 to mark the 75th anniversary of the RAF.\n\n411. My Mystery Ships\n\nby Gordon Campbell\n\nI knew torpedoing a ship from a submarine was not as straightforward a process as most of the war films make out. Until I read this book I had not grasped how tricky it was for a Royal Navy manned converted merchant ship to blast a submarine with its hidden guns. This book by one of the most successful of the Q-ship captains of the First World War was a real eye-opener. Gordon Campbell refers to these ships, made out to look like tramp cargo boats but packing a powerful short-range broadside, as Mystery Ships. I had not realised that the standard MO for these ships was to get themselves torpedoed and apparently abandoned by the crew in the hope of luring the German submarine to come within range of the concealed guns. In one action Campbell's ship was set on fire by an enemy submarine and the hidden stores of shells were expected to explode at any moment. Campbell decided that despite the danger, the gun crew should remain hidden until the German came closer. What he did not realise was that communications with the gun crew had been severed but the gunners themselves had made the decision to stay at their posts until they could get a clear shot at the sub. No wonder Campbell is unstinting in his praise for his crew and points out several occasions when a single mistake or act of cowardice by one crewman could wreck the whole mission. At first I found Campbell's prose style flat but either he got better at writing as he progressed or I got more used to his turn of phrase. This book, published in 1928, was a real find.\n\n410. The Canadian Army\n\nby Col. C P Stacey\n\nThis official summary of the Canadian Army's activities during the Second World War, or the Second Great War as it is sometimes referred to in the book, was published in 1948. Surprisingly, much of what is in it remains pretty much unchallenged to this day. I write \"surprisingly\" because since 1948 there has been an avalanche of books about the Second World War and also about the Canadian military. C P Stacey was the army's official historian and much of what appears is based on official documents, captured documents, information supplied by participants and personal acquaintance with events. It is a condensed version of a three volume history of the Canadian Army's role in the war in Italy, D-Day onwards, and other theatres. The bungled raid on Dieppe is heavily featured, as is the capture of two battalions in Hong Kong in December 1941. The war in Italy 1942-45 gets equal billing with events in Northwest Europe 1944-45, which makes sense as the fighting arms of the Canadian Army was just about equally represented in both theatres. This is a surprisingly fair summary of the fighting considering the war had only ended a few years before the book's publication.\n\n409. True Stories of the SAS\n\nby Robin Hunter\n\nMost of what what former-commando-turned-writer Robin Neillands, Hunter's real name, puts out is good. This one has more than a hint of the kind of a pot-boiler that an author needs to produce almost annually to make a living from writing. But Neillands's contribution to the SAS genre is as good, if not better, than most. It's not quite a history of the Special Air Service but rather a series of snapshots, often drawn from the headline exploits of this much storied unit. Most of the tales I was familiar with but Neillands came up with just enough new ones, or new angles on old ones, to keep me reading. This is perhaps not Neillands's best book but it is still a good read from a master of military story telling. As with many writers on the SAS he is too soft when it comes to self-confessed murderers such as Roy Farran and dangerous sociopaths like Paddy Mayne. Though, in fairness, Neillands does hint at the dark dark dangerous side of Paddy Mayne.\n\n408. The Zulu War: A Pictorial History\n\nby Michael Barthorp\n\nWhen this book was written to mark the centenary of the 1879 Zulu War its author Michael Barthorp was still at the top of his game as one of the best writers of British popular military history. Barthorp admitted that there was little that was new or original in this book and it was intended as an accessible summary of a campaign that had captured the public imagination. In that he succeeds. The illustrations, photographs and engravings from popular newspapers or magazines of the time, are well chosen. Many bring home just how sparse the countryside of Zululand was. The book does full justice to the massacre of Imperial troops at Isandlwana and the subsequent defence of the nearby mission station at Rorkes Drift. The other, lesser known, battles are also well covered and there is little or nothing to fault in Barthorp's analysis of events. This book easily achieves what it set out to do.\n\n407. The Red Devils\n\nby G G Norton\n\nThis is a neat little introduction to the history of British airborne forces from their formation in 1940 through to the late 1960s. The author G G Norton was a member of the parachute regiment and curator of the regiment’s museum. He keeps the chapters short and about half the book is about the post-1945 doings of the regiment. But all the main points are there. The book also takes a look at the early days of the Special Air Service, which for a time during the Second World War was part of the Airborne forces and was long a target for post-war re-absorption. The activities of the Chindits in Burma also come under the microscope as does the RAF contribution to getting the men from air to battle and also the men who kept the troops supplied from the sky. This book cost me about 30 pence and I don’t regret the purchase, by a long chalk.\n\n406. Chechyna Diary\n\nby Thomas Goltz\n\nAmerican freelance film-maker Tom Goltz strikes it “lucky” when the subject village of his 1995 documentary about the conflict in Chechnya becomes the scene of a notorious massacre days after he leaves. But the co-incidence is too much for many of the villagers and his Chechen protector/sponsor has to flee for his life as Goltz is denounced as a Russian spy. Goltz gives an insider’s view of the television news business in a conflict zone and the picture is far from pretty. There was little interest in his snapshot of life in Samashki until Russian troops lay brutal siege to it and kill many of the inhabitants. I found myself asking myself, as a former reporter, if I would have taken the risks Goltz did or handled things differently. Goltz willing admits he was a media-mercenary who needed “bang-bang” both for the health of his bank account and for his own sense of self-worth. Towards the end of the book it becomes clear that he is filled with doubts about the way he earned his living and how his work changed the lives of many of the people who helped him. Reading this book should give wannabe war correspondents at least a few seconds pause for thought.\n\n405. The Battle of Alamein\n\nby John Bierman and Colin Smith\n\nIn this book two veteran journalists, John Bierman and Colin Smith, take a stab at detailing what proved to be Britain’s biggest solo victory over the Germans during the Second World War. And a fair fist of it they manage to make of it. The book actually covers the entire war in the Western Desert, starting with the Italian invasion of Egypt in 1940 and going through to the Axis surrender at Tunis in 1943. The pair do fair job of assessing the strengths and abilities of the various commanders. But it is not enough to simply ascribe the all too often disappointing British performance to too many chinless-wonder officers, particularly when it came to the tank regiments. Bierman and Smith lace the book with numerous first-hand accounts which help paint a picture of what it was like to fight in the desert; either from their own interviews with veterans or from books. The one real howler in the book is the claim that the Siege of Tobruk was the longest in the history of the British Army. The Siege of Mangalore in India, 1783-84, was longer. I would have thought such experienced journalists would have been a little more cautious when it comes to proclaiming on such matters. Anyway, if you are faced with a choice between this book and Johathan Dimbleby’s Destiny in the Desert (Review 401), go for Smith and Bierman, by a long chalk.\n\n404. Legionary - The Roman Soldier's Unofficial Manual\n\nby Philip Matyszak\n\nThis was a bit of light relief - from the guy who brought us Ancient Rome on 5 Denari a Day and Ancient Athens on 5 Drachmas a Day. This time Phlip Matyszak has put together a guide to everything a recruit to the Roman Army in 100 AD would need to know. The conceit works well and Matyszak keeps the tone light and the words clipping along at a fast pace. He knows his Roman history and that makes some of his predictions as to future events relating to the legions and their enemies more than just guess work. Matyszak also enlisted the British re-enactors of the Ermine Street Guard for some of their insights into the equipment, tactics and every day life of a Roman legionary. The book is well illustrated and most of the wise-cracks in it come off. Matyszak peppers the book with quotes from leading Roman soldiers and historians. Though I doubt the wise words in Latin at the beginning of every chapter are genuine quotations. If this book is to be believed, squaddie humour hasn't changed since Hadrian's Wall was still manned.\n\n403. Agent Zigzag\n\nby Ben Macintyre\n\nI had already read one book about British crook turned Second World War double-agent Eddie Chapman (see Review 46) but I have been impressed by Ben Macintyre’s ability to surprise and breathe new life into stories (See Reviews 318 and 169 below) and so decided to give this one a go. And once again, Macintyre did not disappoint. Oddly, Macintyre’s reliance on official records, rather than Chapman’s own suspect claims, show the conman and thief to be a smarter and braver man than I’d given him credit for. Macintyre knows how to tell a story and he has a good feel for the real world of espionage; his book on arch-traitor Kim Philby won the 2016 SMD Book of the Year and his take on the Man Who Never Was was also excellent. Only his book on the SAS, Rogue Heroes (Review 358), has disappointed. Chapman, kicked out of the Coldstream Guards for going AWOL, was a career criminal who was in a Channel Island jail when the Germans invaded in 1940. He managed to convince them that he would make an excellent spy/saboteur if released and returned to Britain. But the first thing he did when he was parachuted into England was to turn himself over to the authorities. The British then faked a bomb attack on an aircraft factory and arranged for Chapman to escape to supposedly neutral Portugal. This story has a lot of twists and turns and a superb cast of characters. It is hard not to conclude that Chapman was shabbily treated by the British once he’d outlived his usefulness but he was a born survivor and seems to have done OK for himself after the war.\n\n402. 18 Hours: The True Story of an SAS War Hero\n\nby Sandra Lee\n\nAustralian special forces signaller Martin “Jock” Wallace won one of his country’s highest bravery awards for his part in a desperate battle against Al Quaeda and the Taliban in March 2002. He and many of the other participants in the 18 hour fight on the mountain slopes of Shahi Kot valley shared their stories with Australian journalist Sandra Lee. She has done an excellent job of portraying Wallace as the epitome of the classic Australian “Digger” of military legend. He comes across as modest, a bit of a larrikin, and a tough, skilled, professional. I have no reason to doubt that the portrayal is accurate. Lee also does a good job of bringing the bleak wintry battlefield to life as Wallace and a fellow member of the Australian SAS fight alongside a company of the US 10th Mountain Division. Seeking to destroy a mountain haven used by Al Qaeda, in an operation that was reckoned to have a chance of capturing Osama bin Laden himself, the men had flown into a hornets’ nest and their only achievement was getting back out again with no fatal casualties. Lee doesn’t point fingers but some the things the US troops do surprise Wallace, such as throwing their ammunition stuffed backpacks away as soon as they come under fire. I know that Canadian troops who served alongside the 10th Mountain in Shahi Kot a few weeks later were not keen to repeat the experience. The book is a lively but easy read. There were none of the usual howlers journalists writing about the fighting in Afghanistan or Iraq are usually guilty of. This should be a contender for Book of the Year. But it’s not. There’s something lacking, a vital spark, perhaps a heart.\n\n401. Destiny in the Desert\n\nby Jonathan Dimbleby\n\nIt's hard to take a book by someone who thinks that the British Army's longest land campaign during the Second World War was in North Africa very seriously. If this member of the Dimbleby media mafia doesn't know that the real answer is Burma, then his grasp of World War Two is tenuous to say the least. Nor were, as far as I know, the 3rd Hussars ever an infantry regiment. And the Arctic convoys were not routed through the Baltic. At least Dimbleby knew his dad, Richard, worked for the BBC during the Second World War. The book is as much about Churchill's fight with the Americans to get them into the war and then, after Hitler declared war on the USA, not to blow it through it a premature invasion of mainland Europe as it is about the fighting in the Western Desert. But Dimbleby fails to convince me that El Alamein was the turning point of the Second World War. I kept waiting for him to justify this claim but I waited in vain. Important, yes, Churchill needed a win after Dunkirk, Singapore, Greece, Crete, Hong Kong, and the series of defeats inflicted by Erwin Rommel in North Africa, but El Alamein was not a war winner. Dimbleby, to his credit, is critical of the officer class and the mess they made of the war in the Western Desert, at least when they faced by German troops. But he is too quick to sneer at Bernard Montgomery and to give weight to the British commander's critics. I wasn't sure that he knows that an officer he hails as an unsung hero of the campaign, Eric \"Chink\" Dorman-Smith decided that he was just the man to breathe new life into the IRA in the 1950s. Dimbleby, in his determination to denigrate Montgomery, is too kind to previous commanders in the Middle East, Archibald Wavell and Claude Auchinlek. Both did well but could have a done a lot better. At the end of the day, there is little new on the military front in this book and Dimbleby fails to prove his case when it comes to the politics.\n\n400. Douglas Haig: From the Somme to Victory\n\nby Gary Sheffield\n\nDo not be fooled by the subtitle of this book by one of Britain's top historians of the First World War; this book is a look at the full career of one of the country's most controversial military commanders rather than a discussion of events between July 1916 and November 1918. The publishers wanted the word \"Somme\"in the title as the book was re-released on the centenary of the most bloody day in British military history. Dr. Sheffield attempts to show why even Haig's ill-disposed political masters in London had to accept he was the best of a bad lot when it came to British Generals and there was no-one who could replace him as British commander on the Western Front. Sheffield also works hard to dispel many of the legends and lies told about the Scottish general and which have led modern generations to label him an unimaginative blundering butcher. At the end of the day many of the attacks Haig ordered were against his better judgement but necessary to sustain the alliance with France, and later with America. His subordinates did not always obey orders and Haig was often too slow to impose his will upon them. Sheffield is at his most convincing when he argues that Haig did a good job of building an army capable of winning the First World War and was actually a strong supporter of technological development. Many of the quotes which show Haig as a cavalry fossil turn out to be either only partial versions of what he said or are taken completely out of context. In my case, Sheffield is preaching to the choir when he pronounces Haig was not the most brilliant of general in the history of the British Army but he was one of the most significant and successful.\n\n399. We Were Soldiers Once.... And Young\n\nby Lt Gen Harold G Moore and Joseph L Galloway\n\nThis book inspired a not-half-bad film starring Mel Gibson. Films are always, or nearly always, more superficial than books. This book is both monumental and a monument in itself. Hundreds of former members of the 1st US Air Cavalry Division were interviewed about the desperate fighting in Vietnam's Ia Drang Valley in November 1965. Most do not pull any punches and the book must rate as one of the most honest and visceral accounts of combat to have appeared on either side of the Atlantic in recent years. The film ends with Mel Gibson and his men from the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry being airlifted by helicopter from the battlefield. The book adds the story of what happened when their replacements from the regiment's 2nd Battalion were attacked as they marched shortly afterwards to another helicopter landing zone nearby and came close to being wiped out. The book stops short of pointing the finger of blame for the almost disaster but it is not too hard to read between the lines. This book is a smooth read but also achieves its aim of standing as a monument to the American men who fought in the Ia Drang Valley. It also makes an attempt at recognising the courage and skill of the mainly North Vietnamese troops the Air Cavalry fought against. There was some input into the book from senior Vietnamese officers but it lacks the perspective of the peasant soldier wielding an AK-47 in the face of American machine guns, mortars, artillery, rockets and napalm. This is perhaps too much to ask and would have led to book that would have been so massive that no-one could reasonably be expected to get through it.\n\n398. Aces Falling - War Above the Trenches, 1918\n\nby Peter Hart\n\nThis is yet another fine book from Imperial War Museum sound archivist Peter Hart. As with many of his best books, this one leans heavily on transcripts of the interviews with veterans. This time he looks at aerial warfare on the Western Front during the final year of the First World War. Hart deftly knits the veterans' memories in with his own analysis of events, letters, diaries and even books by some of the air crew. As with his previous book on the war in the skies in April 1917, Hart points out that not everyone could be an ace fighter pilot. Although some aces do feature, Manfred von Richtofen, James McCudden and Edward Mannock for example, many of those appearing in the book were involved in strafing ground troops, spotting for artillery batteries, downing enemy observation balloons or bombing bridges and air fields. Hart has picked the first-hand experience extracts well and they make for a compelling picture of what it was like to fight in the sky in what would now be regarded as incredibly flimsy flying machines. The air crew in this book come in many shapes and sizes, from the stone-cold but eagle-eyed pilots of the German scouts to very naive teenagers struggling to stay alive in the swirling dogfights above the fields of France and Belgium. Some of the crew share their survival tips. Several are endearingly candid about their fear. This is a good read.\n\n397. The Guns 1939-45\n\nby Ian V Hogg\n\nThis is another entry in the Purnell's Illustrated History of the Second World War series and as per usual is well illustrated with drawings and photographs. The book was copyrighted in 1970 and once again as usual with the series, known as Ballantines Illustrated History of World War II in the USA, is written by a subject expert from that era. In this case Purnell snagged one of the best known and most prolific British writers on matters of gunnery, Ian Hogg. Hogg was good writer and as one of the British Army's most senior artillerymen knew his stuff. But personally I found the book a little too technical for my taste. This was despite Hogg doing his best to dumb things down. He adds in some interesting anecdotes and insights of his own and as I said, he certainly knows his subject matter. But this one I can guarantee is not in the running for the 2017 Book of the Year. It's interesting in its own way but not gripping.\n\n396. Looking Into Hell\n\nby Mel Rolfe\n\nThis book is subtitled \"True Stories from the Bomber Crews\". Former National Service erk turned journalist Mel Rolfe obviously spent a lot of time chatting up British former bomber crew members to put together this collection of true stories. Most, but not all, are from former members of Bomber Command. As a former member of the Royal Air Force, Rolfe has a good feel for the lingo and atmosphere. The stories, some funny, others frightening and tragic, cover a wide canvas of air crew experience. Most of the chapters are short and this is a book better dipped into than one for settling down with for an hour or so. The stories clip along at a fair rate and the pace can eventually become a little tiring. This is definitely a valuable contribution to the genre of bomber crew reminiscence.\n\n395. The Irish Civil War 1922-23\n\nby Peter Cottrel\n\nThis is one of books from the Osprey Essential Histories series. If you didn't know that the conflict between the Treaty and Anti-Treaty forces after Ireland was granted independence from the United Kingdom was bloodier than the fight against the British to gain it, then this will be an eye-opener. I was interested in the conflict because I was intrigued as to how the new Irish government managed to defeat many of the same men who fought the British to a standstill between 1919 and 1921. The answer, according to my reading of this book, was that the civil war split the IRA into two camps and most of the brains went with the pro-Treaty, pro-Government, side. And the pro-Treaty side was far more ruthless and prepared to ignore the law than the British ever dared to be. And in a counter-insurgency war, the Pro-Treaty men had better intelligence sources than the British ever enjoyed. Cottrel, a British Army officer when he wrote this book, is pretty even-handed when it came a conflict which until recently was still a bleeding wound in the Irish body politic. The Government, pro-treaty, side also had a vote from the majority of the Irish population favouring the treaty. The book is bare-bones when it comes to the narration, has some good maps and excellent illustrations. It takes a brief look at events leading up to 1922, the combatants, the early fighting, the descent into guerrilla war, the Anti-Treaty IRA men's dumping of their arms and events right up to the Good Friday Agreement. This book does exactly what it promises; it is an excellent primer/summary.\n\n394. In the Service of the Sultan\n\nby Ian Gardiner\n\nI think even if this book doesn’t win the 2018 Book of the Year award, it will certainly take the bargain of the year as it only cost me £2 for a pristine hardback copy. But, it may well take the Book of the Year too. The Sultan being served is Oman’s Qaboos bin Said al Said, a former officer in the Cameronians/Scottish Rifles. And Gardiner was a young officer in the Royal Marines when he was seconded to the Omani army between 1973 and 1975 as it battled Communist-controlled rebels in the province of Dhofar. Gardiner, the product of one of Edinburgh’s private schools, gets away with the workable conceit of laying the book out a little like a play with chapters along the lines of setting the scene, the actors, First Act, Act Two, etc. The first chapter reads a little like something form the Arabian Nights but does a nice job of introducing the reader to one of the more fascinating parts of the Middle East. Gardiner was obviously smitten with the place. But he also puts the bush war into context. If the Communists in Yemen, who were acting as a proxy for the Soviet Union had succeeded in over-throwing the Sultan, then control of the narrow straits of Hormuz and the oil tankers that use it would have been lost. Many British army and air force officers were seconded to the Sultan’s forces and there were also a large number of former officers on contract to him. Gardiner obviously spoke to a number of them and incorporates their experiences into the book along with his own. He is a good writer and his modesty isn’t over-done. Much of his war was spent defending hilltop bases from the Adoo or trying to ambush them as they made their way into Oman from neighbouring Communist Yemen. Gardiner would go on to command a company of Royal Marines in the Falklands War and incorporates some of his experiences there into this book as well. His comments on soldiering in general and counter-insurgency are well worth reading and considering. His experiences commanding and working alongside Muslim troops also make for some interesting anecdotes. Gardiner comes across as a born raconteur who is able to translate his patter into prose with ease.\n\n393. Armor and Blood\n\nby Denis E Showalter\n\nAs the spelling of the title indicates, this is an American book. But as American \"histories\" go, it isn't too bad. This might be because no Americans are involved in the fighting. This book is about the 1943 Soviet-German clash at Kursk - often labelled the Biggest Tank Battle in History. I moved this book up on the \"to-read\" pile because I wanted to do a comparison with Lloyd Clark's Kursk (See Review 386 below). Overall, I prefer Showalter's book. It is shorter and perhaps that makes the analysis seem sharper and more pithy. Showalter also makes less use of eye-witness testimony and this keeps the narrative clipping along at a fair speed. The photographs in the book are all German and this led me to fear that text would be too heavily titled towards the German viewpoint. It does indeed seem to look through the German lens more than it does the Soviet but this may be the due to the availability of sources. Showalter is careful to warn that many of the memoirs of the German commanders are self-serving in a \"Hitler's interference lost us the war\" sort of the way. The German generals blamed the loss of the First World War on a stab in the back from civilian politicians and the loss of the Second on Hitler. Neither is true. But he also warns that official Soviet records and commanders' memoirs are also heavily slanted. Showalter's narrative is, in the main, easy to follow and fair to both sides. His attempts at folksiness and use of American sporting metaphors in the writing can be a little grating to a reader not brought up in the United States but apart from that it is, for an American history, quite a reasonable book. But James Graham was the Marquis of Montrose, not the Earl. One thing I did learn from the book was that the Soviets used British Churchill tanks at Kursk.\n\n392. Spearhead to Victory\n\nby Daniel G Dancocks\n\nThe subtitle of this book \"Canada and the Great War\" is misleading. It is actually about the last 100 days of the First World War on the Western Front when the Canadian Corps often acted as the spearhead of Field Marshal Douglas Haig's successful cracking of the German defensive lines. The 1918 Battle of Amiens on 8th August is sometimes described as the The Day We Won the War. Certainly, the British Expeditionary Force began grinding steadily eastwards after that day. Daniel Dancocks makes a good argument that this was largely due to the Canadians not only outfighting the Germans but also drawing many of their best troops away from less efficient British Corps and Divisions and making their advance easier. The lack of progress made on the flanks of the Canadian Corps by British Divisions, including on more than one occasion the 51st Highland Division, is a constant theme in the book. But Dancocks is careful to look at the reasons why the Canadians were more successful. It was as much about organisation, staff work, balance of forces and the cohesion enjoyed by the Canadians as it was about courage and tactical innovation. The Canadians had the advantage in serving together throughout the war, rather than being moved from Corps to Corps and switched from Army to Army in the same way as the British divisions were. Dancocks also points out that many of Britain's most successful officers in the Second World War, with the exception of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, cut their teeth with the Canadian Corps in World War One. He also pays tribute to the Australian Corps which could also claim the title of \"The Shock Troops of the British Empire\" but he points out that it was pulled out of the fighting before the Armistice of November 11th 1918. The book leans heavily on official documents, unit histories and personal letters or reminiscences (when it was published in 1987 there were still a few veterans around). Dancocks's books are usually very good and this one is no exception. The deflation of the United States myth that the American Expeditionary Force \"Won the War\", which even includes a statistical table, comes over as a little petty. It is not news the Americans exaggerate their own contribution to victory and either ignore or belittle that of their allies. The AEF did not lack courage but its high casualty rates were due to inexperience and poor staff work rather than a necessary and unavoidable sacrifice required for victory in battle.\n\n391. In Foreign Fields\n\nby Dan Collins\n\nThis book sat for too long on the \"to-read\" pile. It is based on interviews with 25 British winners of bravery medals awarded for work done in either Iraq or Afghanistan. I think I was put off my the disappointingly sloppy \"Spoken from the Front\"; a similar collection which bears the imprint of the Andy McNab brand. But former sports journalist seems to have had a knack of putting his subjects at ease and getting them to open up. Most come over as decent modest people. Many of them, I think, were genuinely embarrassed that they got a medal while the courage of those around them went officially unrecognised. The stories and experiences vary as widely as the sort of the people who serve in the British military. Some touch on the transition back to peace-time soldiering, others on how it feels to kill people. There are also tales of what is like to see a friend, or respected colleague, die in action only a few feet away. A couple lament the lack of understanding and interest the British public appeared to have when it came to events in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some admitted to having trouble adjusting back to normality and domestic life. It's pretty obvious that Collins's list of questions included \"How and When did you find out you were getting a medal\" and \"Tell me about meeting the Queen\". This book proved to be a sensitive but reasonably honest account of British men, and one woman, at war. I may well put it on the shortlist for Book of the Year. If I do, it will be the first book to make the 2018 list.\n\n390. Agincourt: A New History\n\nby Anne Curry\n\nThis book by University of Southampton history professor Anne Curry is obviously a labour of love. It is the results of years of poring through 15th Century accounts of the historic clash between the English army of Henry V and a French force. Curry also leans heavily on the financial records of the treasuries of the two countries. The book's coverage of the actual fighting on 25 October 1415 is short - because 15th Century accounts of the battle are vague. As a professional historian, Curry is reluctant to venture too far from the written records. Much of the book is along the lines of \"So-and-so says this but Such-and-such says that\". I wish Curry had given her opinion on who to believe a little more often than she did. She after all knows the sources better than the average reader and can do a better job of evaluating their worth. One thing she does do is look at how much what would nowadays be known as spin-doctoring goes on in nearly all the accounts, depending on which faction (even within the French and English camps) the source favours. This was an interesting read but not always a smooth one.\n\n389. Maverick One\n\nby David Blakeley\n\nThis military memoir turned out to be better than I expected - but then I wasn't expecting much. The writing and structure soon struck me as a little too smooth for a beginner and so I began to suspect a ghost writer might be involved. Sure enough, the copyright is shared with Damien Lewis, who seems to specialise in working to help soldiers tell their stories. Lewis has a patchy record (See Review 347 below) when it comes to this kind of book. But in case of Capt. Blakeley, the result is readable and reasonably interesting. Blakeley was from a working class area but became a leading junior show-jumper. He then managed to get himself into the Ministry of Defence boarding school at Welbeck for his final year before going to Sandhurst for officer training. It had been understood that he would become an officer in the artillery or engineers but instead he managed to swing it to join the Parachute Regiment. Much of the book is taken up by the time he spent on the tough selection course to join the Pathfinder platoon and in fact this book is the follow-up to a best-seller detailing his sole combat mission in Iraq. He also gives accounts of his time as an officer with the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in Kosovo and Sierra Leone. The Kosovo material was interesting to me because I was there around the same time, though not in Pristina. I would also have liked to have read more about his first platoon command. His men had only recently returned from Northern Ireland and there would seem to have been some morale problems. Oh, the Pathfinder selection course provides some interesting tips for hard-core hillwalkers. As I say, this was better than expected. And I never expected it to live up to the promises contained in the blurb on the back of my paperback copy. I think this book might best be taken with a pinch of salt handy.\n\n388. Order of Battle: The Red Army in WWII\n\nby David Porter\n\nThis book is not quite as dry as the title suggests. Yes, it does include charts showing the various components of Soviet Red Army formations and their commanders. But it also includes some discussion of equipment, its distribution within various formations and an easily followed summary of battles and campaigns. The maps are good and there are short biographies of many of the senior Soviet commanders. The formation organisational charts are not always complete but give a fair idea of the composition of the \"Fronts\" and \"Armies\". Oddly, the book ends abruptly with the capture of Berlin in 1945 and has nothing to say about the Red Army's Far East campaign against the Japanese Imperial Army. I would have thought for the sake of completeness, the book does after all cover the July 1939 clash with the Japanese at Khalkin Gol, a couple of pages about Manchuria and Korea in 1945 would have been included.\n\n387. Battle Lines\n\nedited by J L Granastein and Norman Hillmer\n\nThis is a collection of snippets from books, letters, diaries, and other writings on the theme of Canada's military history. It is the nature of such collections that they are often a curate's egg - and this one is no different. The book is sub-titled \"Eyewitness Accounts from Canada's Military History\" but this is a tad misleading. Although, I suppose it could be argued that letters from home do count. There is even a suicide note from a soldier who returned home after the Second World War to find his wife had cheated on him with numerous men and rubbed it his face when they were reunited. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have killed myself over her but maybe the balance of his mind was disturbed. The time period covered is from the capture of Quebec in 1759 through to Afghanistan in late 2003. The book is interesting enough but there were few extracts that were truly memorable or striking.\n\n386. Kursk\n\nby Lloyd Clark\n\nSandhurst lecturer and television pundit Lloyd Clark has the largest tank battle the world has ever known in his sights for this one. The result is a workman-like account of the desperate battle between the Germans and the Soviets in 1943 which began the long retreat to Berlin which only ended in May 1945. Perhaps Kursk was just too big a battle to be covered in one book short enough to read comfortably. Clark intersperses the accounts of the massive tank clashes with vivid first-hand accounts from participants on both sides but somehow, I felt, the book fails to gel. About a third of the book discusses the run-up to the battle; going back as far as the rises to power of both Hitler and Stalin. Clark has been criticised for this but it puts the battle in context and the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of both sides is well worth the read. The Duke of Wellington once noted that it was as difficult to give an adequate and accurate account of a battle as of a court ball. And the bigger the battle, I would guess the harder it is to describe it. Kursk was one of the key battles of the Second World War and it is shame that it is not as well known in The West as it should be. Though interesting, I doubt if this book will be the final word on it, nor should it be.\n\n385. Waterloo\n\nby Bernard Cornwell\n\nThe author of the fictional Sharpe series of books turns his writing chops to a non-fiction account of the Battle of Waterloo. The book was timed to come out just before the bicentenary of the clash in Belgium between the legendary Napoleon and the equally legendary Duke of Wellington. Cornwell admits that his aim was to further capitalise on the research he had done for his book Sharpe's Waterloo. What he produced is a highly readable account of the battle. He is not afraid to mix past and presence tense in a single sentence, for most writers a big no-no, but he knows what he's doing. He also repeats facts but rather than being irritating this saves the reader going back pages to remind themselves of what is going on. The account of the battle is reasonably solid but not error free. He is careful to refer to Wellington's army as \"British-Dutch\" and gives full credit to the Prussians for their battle-winning intervention. The book focuses heavily on the accounts written by participants and this helps to bring the story alive. One quibble is that Cornwell seems to have great difficulty telling the 3rd Foot Guards, the Scots Guards, from the 1st Foot, the Royal Scots. There was no regiment called The Royal Scots Guards, Mr Cornwell. Actually, another quibble. The 73rd Foot ceased to be a Highland regiment in 1809, so it's not likely that it's members can be described as \"Highlanders\". The numerous maps are generally good and helpful. Despite the silly errors in this book it is a good introduction to the battle. Just don't rely on it if you're writing a high school essay on the battle.\n\n384. Hitler's Spy Chief\n\nby Richard Bassett\n\nThis proved to be an odd and disappointing book. I'm not clear what journalist turned author Richard Bassett was trying to say about Nazi spy chief Admiral Wilhelm Canaris and his role in the Allied victory in 1945. Perhaps that Britain squandered several opportunities not only to prevent the Second World War but to end it in 1943? I might just be being obtuse. But Bassett's writing style did not help. At one point he announces that British traitor Kim Philby was involved in an effort to destroy the Dutch Resistance. But Bassett does not say on whose orders Philby is acting: his employer, MI6/Secret Intelligence Service, or his true masters in Soviet intelligence? Either could be true. The claim certainly puts a new spin on the Dutch debacle. I wonder what the same source has to say about allegations that MI6 played a key role in destroying the Prosper Resistance ring in France before the D Day Landings. The world of intelligence is notoriously byzantine, duplicitous, and tricky. The truth may no longer be out there and might now never surface. The true story of collaboration with the Nazis by certain Britons will almost certainly never be told. Bassett is forced to rely on too much speculation and guess work; and dubious self-serving post-war testimonies. I can easily believe that MI6 and Canaris's Abwher had channels of communication both before and during the war. They may even have worked on occasion together against Soviet intelligence, certainly before Hitler's 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. But I don't buy into Bassett's claims that Canaris was spy genius and the Abwher was a super efficient intelligence network; the fruits of its labours withheld from Hitler. Maybe that is all true, but Bassett fails to demonstrate it in this book. I found the most interesting, and plausible, parts of the book were about Spain, it's civil war, and its role in the Second World War.\n\n383. The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy\n\nedited by J R Hill\n\nThis proved to be a thoughtful and thought-provoking look at the role and realities of British seapower from a team of top academics. In the early chapters there is a tendency to ignore the naval heritage of countries of the British Isles that are not English. No mention of the Lords of the Isles and their fleets of galleys; none at all. No mention of the Great Michael or Scotland's attempts to keep invading English ships out of its waters. Each chapter is by a different academic, including some Americans, and the quality of the writing is variable; but never less than good and easily digestible. They are all self-contained and tackle a wide variety of subjects; global strategy, technology, political control and administration, social history and even the odd battle. Accounts of actual fighting are kept short but concise. This is no catalogue of battles interspersed with tales of seagoing daring-do. The book, not surprisingly in view of its title, is well, perhaps even lavishly, illustrated. My favourite illustration is a reproduction of an 1805 recruiting poster for one of Lord Cochrane's ships which reads like an invitation to join a pirate cruise. The book ends in the early 1990s when the Royal Navy was struggling to make the most of its experiences in the Falklands War a decade earlier.\n\n382. Green Armour\n\nby Osmar White\n\nThis is an odd little book about the Second World war as fought in the southwest Pacific. It's really three little memoirs written an Australian journalist. I was tricked by the original 1945 introduction being datelined New York and by the use of American spelling into thinking the author was American. His apparent lack of nationalist sentiment in discussing the performance of Australian troops in New Guinea also suggested the sort of impartiality that might be expected from an outsider. But White, by birth a New Zealander, was just trying to be honest. It was his honest opinion that the Japanese were prevented from reaching Port Moresby not so much by the Australian Army but by the jungle. In this book the jungles of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands are the real enemy to be defeated. By far the best part of the book recounts White's trek through the jungle to visit a team of Australian commandos operating on the north coast of New Guinea. Modern readers may find White's attitude to the locals as racist, or at least highly patronising, and he is no fan of the Japanese fighting man either. White argues the Japanese were better prepared and trained for jungle warfare than their Australian and American opponents. The book is more memoir than campaign history. But White is good at both conveying his own experiences and those of the soldiers, sailors, and aircrew he interviewed to give a compelling few of the war from the slit trench, foxhole and oozing jungle slime.\n\n381. Catastrophe\n\nby Max Hastings\n\nProlific military writer and journalist Max Hastings takes a sombre and sober look at the opening months of the First World War in this heavy tome. He, or his researchers, cast the net wide to find letters, memoirs, articles and diaries of those caught up in one of the great tragedies of European history. Soldiers, politicians, housewives, school teachers and children are all quoted in a tale which spans Europe. Hastings pays more attention than many British writers to the war in the Balkans and the Eastern Front. He appears to have gone out of his way to be honest about the disappointing performance of the tiny British Expeditionary Force and the part it played in foiling the German invasion of Belgium and north-eastern France. Hastings places the blame for the war firmly in court of war mongers in the Vienna and Berlin. I am not sure a completely buy into his argument that the Germans attack on France was doomed to fail. The arguments he makes could almost equally be employed to show Hitler had no chance of winning the Battle of France in 1940. But I do agree that from the British and French point of view that the war had to be fought. The Germans and the Austro-Hungarians did terrible, disgusting, inhumane, things in the territories they occupied. He also has a go at modern British attitudes to the war and the over-emphasis on the writings of a handful of English poets when it comes to present day perceptions of the conflict. His point that the British are proud of their part in the Second World War because ordinary people gained something from their suffering, the welfare state, while the aftermath of the First was marked by callous betrayal of their interests is well made. Britain was no paradise for the working man before the war; it was a worse place for them afterwards. Surprisingly for such an experienced journalists, Hastings writing style was just a little stodgy.\n\n380. Soldier I SAS\n\nby Michael Paul Kennedy\n\nThis was one of the first Special Air Service memoirs by a non-officer, and therefore was a bit of a pioneer in the genre. Fortunately, ghost-writer Michael Paul Kennedy, taking time away from his duties as a music critic, avoids much of the war porn and squaddie-speak which all too often mars British rank-and-file memoirs. Apart from a couple of over-purpley patches of prose, Kennedy tells his man's tale well and in a highly readable way. There are a couple of unexpected twists as we follow the SAS career of Soldier I, actually Peter \"Snapper\" Winner, from Oman and the dramatic Battle at Mirbat in the early 1970s through the Iranian Embassy Siege and latterly in the Falklands. Kennedy adds to the tension by returning the story to a psychiatric unit and a couple of times I got a bit lost as to which hospital Winner was in and why. I got the impression that life might have been easier for everyone if a dopey helicopter pilot hadn't insisted Winner examine the bodies of six of the men killed at Mirbat before airlifting back to base. This is an easy, quick, but rewarding read.\n\n379. Soldier Sahibs\n\nby Charles Allen\n\nThis book is subtitled \"The Men Who Made the North-West Frontier\" and follows the fortunes of a group of an extraordinary men who often single-handedly extended British power in India. Author Charles Allen is perhaps best known for his Plain Tales from the Raj. Born in India, he knows the country and its peoples well. Sadly, because they did not leave written memoirs behind, Allen was unable highlight the Indians who played a key role in the Imperial Enterprise; though it's obvious he would have if he could have done so. The book pulls no punches when it comes to the brutality used by this British Band of Brothers but he also points out that many Indians found their rule preferable to that of their own callous and greedy countrymen. Allen takes up his tale at the time of the disastrous British invasion of Afghanistan in 1839, which resulted in the destruction of an entire army. He makes it very clear why the force sent by the British to avenge the loss was known as The Army of Retribution. Allen attempts to build his story around the legendary John Nicholson but despite his efforts, the Ulster man remains an enigma. The story follows British fortunes through the unnecessarily bloody Sikh Wars and the annexation of what is now Pakistan's Frontier Province through to the recapture of rebel capital Delhi during the Indian Mutiny in 1857. The story is bloody and cruel, inspiring and fascinating all at the same time. But a couple of quibbles: the 75th Foot was not a Highland regiment at the time of the Indian Mutiny and may not have even been particularly Scottish in character at that time; Lord Frederick Roberts did not die a natural peaceful death, but from something nasty he picked up while visiting British troops in the opening months of the First World War. If Allen got these things wrong, what else in the book is dubious?\n\n378. Churchill's Folly: Leros and the Aegean\n\nby Anthony Rogers\n\nThis could and should have been a better book. It takes a look at one of the least remembered British campaigns of the Second World War; the Dodecanese Islands in 1943. The British, pretty much on Winston Churchill's orders, seized these Italian-occupied but Greek-inhabited islands off the Turkish coast with what was basically a token force. The campaign, as far as the Americans were concerned, was an off-shoot of an off-shoot, namely the Italian campaign, and the scheme was starved of resources. The Germans struck back with a force which included elite Brandenberger commandos and other crack troops. The Germans also enjoyed air supremacy. It's an interesting story, but sadly, Anthony Rogers's version is ham-fisted. War is a confused business and battles are often won by the side which makes the fewest serious mistakes; but Rogers goes beyond capturing the confusion of battle by confusing the reader with his surprisingly poor writing. His narrative jumps from unit to unit with little indication of whether he is referring to British, German or even Italian troops. Much of his source material is German. Perhaps this is not surprising as the British did not do particularly well, particularly when it came to command and control, and would not want to draw attention to their failings. I could not help feeling that Rogers was too keen to demonstrate the depth of his research by including much material that would have been better cut out to avoid bewildering and perplexing his readers. If you are interested in this sadly neglected episode, find another book.\n\n377. The First of the Few\n\nby Denis Winter\n\nThis was the one that almost got away. About a decade ago I picked up a copy of this book about fighter pilots in the First World War - and promptly lost on the street within 15 minutes. That always annoyed me and finding another copy became just short of an obsession. So when I did come across another copy I was pretty sure that it would be a bit of a disappointment. Wrong - again. Denis Winter does an excellent job of conveying what life, and death, was like for the fighter pilots of World War One. The book leans heavily towards the British/Canadian experience but also features German, French and American pilots. Much of the material is harvested from the published memoirs of the airmen. Winter also takes material from letters, official reports, squadron diaries and scientific papers. The book's chapters follow the pilots through from training to lwhat life was like with a frontline squadron through to peace in 1918. Life could be brutally short and death all too often fiery. But as Winter points out, the enemy was not always the biggest threat to survival. This book proved to be well worth the approximately ten year wait and certainly did not disappoint. Perhaps not Book of the Year material but well worth reading.\n\n376. With Rommel in the Desert\n\nby Heinz Werner Schmidt\n\nThose hoping for an insider's view of Field Marshal Edwin Rommel's headquarters during the Desert War are going to be disappointed. Yes, as the cover claims Heinz Werner Schmidt was an aide to Rommel, but only for a brief period. Most of this book is about the campaign in the Western Desert as seen through German eyes by an officer who was eventually to rise to battalion command. This alone makes it worth reading. And Schmidt tells his tale well. It's no great surprise that it was reprinted ten times between 1951 and 1960. Of course, that was long before it was known that the British were able to read many of the top level top secret German radio signals sent using the supposedly uncrackable Enigma system. Perhaps Schmidt credits the British command with just a little too much foresight and battlefield acumen. It's not so hard to anticipate the other side's moves when you can read their radio traffic. Schmidt is very even-handed when it comes to assessing the various forces involved in the North African fighting. I couldn't help feeling the fighting would have been far more brutal if the German SS had been involved. Schmidt does not buy into the hero worship of Rommel which many Britons indulged in and he is not blind to the German leader's shortcomings. This was an interesting and easy read.\n\n375. Sandhurst - A Documentary\n\nby Michael Yardley\n\nThis is not what I thought it was going to be. I had expected more of a hymn of praise to the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, as it was back in 1986. Author Michael Yardley attended Sandhurst, twice. Perhaps the most worrying part of the book was when Yardley let the would-be officers speak for themselves. They came over, in the main, as nasty little Thatcherites, some of whom were convinced that a Labour government would abolish the Army. Those who were not Thatcherites felt pressured to keep their thoughts to themselves and conform. Some working class kids even bought themselves Barbour Jackets and other Yuppie paraphernalia in a bid to fit in. Most admitted the lessons went unabsorbed in one ear and out the other. The curriculum was over-crowded, disorganised and, according to Yardley, too much time was spent on ceremonial drill. Most of what the would-be officers needed to know was expected to be learned after they joined their units. Weeding out non-conformists, often the more imaginative and smart folk on the course, seems to have been the basic aim of Sandhurst. That and getting rid of those who could not bring themselves to pretend they went to a private school. The present leadership of the British Army is of this vintage. No wonder things are such a mess. The book is broken down into three parts; a history of officer \"education\" within the British Army from Napoleonic times; a photo-essay showing the students at work and play and finally interviews with staff and students. The latter, as I have already said, makes for very scary reading.\n\n374. The Highland Furies: The Black Watch 1739-1899\n\nby Victoria Schofield\n\nI can't help feeling this was a missed opportunity. Journalist Victoria Schofield was commissioned to write a history of Scotland's most famous regiment by its trustees to mark its amalgamation into the Royal Regiment of Scotland. This was done on the basis of the good job the trustees felt she had done with her biography of one of the regiment's most famous sons, General Archibald Wavell. The job offered excellent access to the regimental archives, with its treasure trove of letters and diaries, in Perth and its team of archivists led by Tommy Smyth. But despite being able to pepper the text with first-hand eyewitness accounts from the officers and men, the result is disappointing. Did no-one who knew a bit of British or military history go through it before publication. They might have queried Schofield's assertion that the 1857 Indian Mutiny was associated with the introduction of the Lee Enfield rifle, though the rifle's invention was still 40 years away. Someone might also have queried her claim that in 1866 the British were about to sign a 99-year lease on the island of Hong Kong; the British had been in possession of the island since 1841 and it had been turned over in perpetuity to Britain in 1843. The lease, signed in 1898, was for the New Territories on the Chinese mainland. Perhaps someone might have cautioned Schofield not to take anything veteran bull-shitter Donald Macleod said in his 1791 ghosted biography too seriously. Waterloo was not the last time the British fought the French - ask the families of those killed in the 1941 fighting in Lebanon or on Madagascar. I found this book a hard slog. It wasn't properly proof-read; one paragraph simply vanishes half-way through, at least I'm guessing it was half-way. I found Schofield's writing style turgid. One factor in its favour is that it follows the fortunes of the 73rd Foot, which became the 2nd Battalion in 1881, in more details than most regimental histories do. But even then, I would like to have read more about the brutal war it fought in Ceylon in the late 1810s and what reputed sadist Lt. Maclaine really did there. The Black Watch may be the most written-about regiments in the British Army. Schofield added little to the story and the few gems that do appear in the book are not worth the slog involved in going through it.\n\n373. Sea Harrier Over the Falklands\n\nby Commander \"Sharkey\" Ward\n\nThis book about 801 Naval Air Squadron's part in the 1982 Falklands War bills itself as \"controversial\". Ward can indeed be unsparing in his criticism; particularly of his fellow fleet air arm colleagues in 800 Squadron, whom he felt failed to make best use of that marvel of military aviation design, the Sea Harrier. He's also pretty unimpressed by the Royal Air Force. Some of the senior naval commanders involved in the campaign, both at sea and back in England, also feel the lash of Wards's prose. But he tells his tale well and sensibly. Ward's 801 Squadron flew from the Invincible while most of the senior naval task force commanders and 800 Squadron were based on the Hermes. According to Ward, stupid decisions were made and both lives and ships were lost unnecessarily. He is obviously a man of character, but I'd be interested in reading some other points of view. Some would say he comes over as arrogant. But others say self-confidence is key when it comes to combat flying. And the few comments I have been able to find from men who served in 801 Squadron are pretty positive. I found this a very good read as an account of jet jockeys at work; their real work. But I took it all with a pinch of salt, sea salt.\n\n372. Monty's Men\n\nby John Buckley\n\nI was so impressed by Professor John Buckley's insightful look at the truth about the performance of British tanks and their crews during the 1944 Normandy Campaign (see Review 369 below) that I made a special effort to get my hands on a copy of his account of the British Army's campaign in Northwest Europe. Once again professional historian Buckley takes many recent authors, British and American, to task over what he, pretty convincingly, argues is their unfair treatment of British Army's performance between June 1944 and May 1945. He accuses them of swallowing the self-serving testimony of German soldiers after the war who claimed the British performed badly and would have been driven back into the sea if it had not been for their massive, overwhelming, superiority in fire-power. In fact, Buckley shows, superior fire-power alone was never going to be win the war. Most of the British troops were new to battle and contrary to what many popular war writers claim, were part of an organisation that learned quickly and learned well. In any case, Britain's Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery deliberately played to the strengths of his army, including artillery and engineering know-how and the sheer numbers of tanks available, in a politically and militarily necessary bid to avoid casualties. After some sticky fighting early on in Normandy the British found their groove and the one time they subsequently departed from it, Arnhem, the wheels came off badly. Buckley's argument that Arnhem/Market Garden should never have been attempted is concise and compelling. He states the only surprising thing about it is that it came anywhere near succeeding. About half of the book is a recap of his tanks in Normandy book with a little more focus on the activities of non-armoured units. The British Army's performance in Northwest Europe was not flawless but it, Buckley argues well, was nowhere near as dire and disappointing as the likes of Max Hastings would have readers believe. Buckley builds his case on a strong foundation of memoirs, interviews, official reports, and the work of previous writers to persuade readers that the 21st Army Group actually did very well. Though, no-one ever plays a perfect game. I think he meant the 5th Cameron Highlanders rather than the 5th Cameronians in an account of the 51st Highland Division in action. By the way, he makes a good effort to rehabilitate the 51st's reputation in the face of criticisms of its performance during the Normandy Campaign.\n\n371. Tobruk\n\nby Michael Carver\n\nDespite the title, Tobruk only really features in the second-to-last chapter if this book when its defences collapse and it is captured by the Germans and Italians under Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in June 1942. The bulk of the book is about the two campaigns which preceded the fall of the North African port. The author, Michael Carver, has to be taken seriously. He rose to be Chief of the Imperial Staff in the early 1970s and he was there in the thick of the action in North Africa as major acting as 30 Corps' commander Lt-Gen. Willoughby Norrie's right-hand man. Carver proves to be no great fan of Rommel's, regrading him as an often reckless gambler and chancer. Though the British Empire forces often enjoyed both numerical and equipment superiority, even the Italians with their completely inadequate tanks could beat them. Carver puts this down to British command muddling and inefficiency throughout the seven months before the fall of Tobruk. The Germans were quicker to take advantage of their enemy's mistakes than the British and made better use of their equipment. Sometimes Carver's account seems confused and the fact that opposing battle-groups were scattered across the battlefield with no clear frontline does not help. He draws heavily, but well, on first-hand accounts and unit histories to bring the desperate fighting to life. This is a good book but not a great book.\n\n370. The Hunt for Rob Roy\n\nby David Stevenson\n\nI had long thought that Scottish outlaw Rob Roy was more hype than anything else and he was a minor player in history. This book by St Andrew's University history professor David Stevenson put me right. Though the real Rob Roy bore little relation to the legend, he was for a short time a major player in Scots history. Like any good historical biographer Stevenson not only brings his subject to life but also his times. Rob Roy's career spanned the absorption of Scotland into the English state and three armed attempts to restore the Stuarts to the throne. Interesting times. But sordid times too. The legend of Rob Roy Macgregor, alias Campbell, alias Drummond, ignores the fact that the bankrupt cattle-dealer and swindler biggest contribution to history was as a Government spy. But ironically the hunt for him was most rigorously pursued because of what powerful factions in the government believed he was not telling them. Stevenson relies heavily on court papers, both criminal and civil, and official correspondence to separate The Legend of the Scottish Robin Hood from the Real Rob Roy. Sadly, the documents do not convey the charm he must have had to survive to eventually die in his own bed despite his criminality and double-dealing. Rob Roy was persecuted by several of the richest and most powerful men in Scotland but he was also protected by other members of the nobility. Once he outlived his usefulness, he was allowed to live out his life unmolested. Stevenson provides a fascinating look at a time of turbulent change in Scotland by taking an honest look at the truth behind The Legend.\n\n369. British Armour in the Normandy Campaign 1944\n\nby John Buckley\n\nMany, if not most, modern writers who tackle the Normandy Campaign of 1944 lambaste the British command and government on the subject of the 21st Army Group's armoured forces. Professor John Buckley questions some of the basic thinking behind these attacks. While agreeing that when faced with German Tiger or Panther tanks, Britain's Shermans, Cromwells and Churchills were outclassed in terms of fire-power and armour, Buckley points out that the majority of German tanks in Normandy were neither Tigers or Panthers. And when the Germans went on the offensive against the British, their armoured forces fared little better. The configurations of the British armoured divisions were ill-suited to the close quarter attacks against a determined and well armed foe. The lessons of the Western Desert, which resulted in most British tanks being armed with US medium velocity guns capable of firing high explosive did apply in Normandy. Buckley argues that the British tank troops learned quickly on the job and ended the campaign with workable solutions to many the problems they faced. He also works hard to dispel claims that British tanks crews proved unacceptably \"windy\" in the face of their German opposition. Anyone with an interest in the Normandy Campaign should at least consider what Buckley has to say.\n\n368. The Century of Warfare\n\nby Charles Messenger\n\nI'm not convinced Charles Messenger, once one of the most prolific British writers on matters military, wrote this book issued to accompany the television series of the same name. In the first three pages there are two howling errors. Kaiser Wilhelm was not a great nephew of Queen Victoria, he was her grandson, and the Second Boer War did not involve Dutch-speaking South African settlers attempting to establish their own republics but rather a British attempt to annex the existing Transvaal and the Orange Free State. The book then settles down into a workman-like but even-handed summary of warfare and conflict between 1900 and 1994. The book is heavily illustrated but sadly too many of the pictures are fuzzy screen-grabs, presumably taken from footage used in the TV series. The book towards the end has another obvious howler which once again damages its credibility; not all the hostages at Entebbe in Uganda were rescued in 1976: one elderly woman passenger from the El Al flight who was in hospital when Israeli commandos staged their rescue was later murdered. I am not sure if the fact that the book was copyrighted not by Messenger but by the makers of the television series goes anyway to confirm my suspicion that the former was not the author, or at least not the sole author.\n\n367. Afrika Korps\n\nby Major KJ Macksey M.C.\n\nThere are those who say this was one of the best of books in the old circa-1970 Purnell's Illustrated History of the Second World War. It certainly is an excellent summary of the war in the Western Desert and Tunisia between 1941 and 1943. Author Kenneth Macksey was an armoured corps officer during the Second World War and knows of what he writes when he praises the Deutchshe Afrika Korps as one of the finest fighting forces of the conflict. German commander Erwin Rommel is the main character in this tale and Macksey is not blind to his limitations. Rommel's British opponents dubbed him the Desert Fox and built up his reputation to disguise their own inadequacies. There were several occasions when if the British commanders had reached even the giddy heights of mediocre generalship, they could have caught Rommel out when he over-played his hand. And there were other times when the Afrika Korps's sheer professionalism and fighting spirit got Rommel out of a hole he had dug for himself and for them. As usual with the this series of books, there are maps and photographs aplenty.\n\n366. The Irish War of Independence\n\nby Michael Hopkinson\n\nI had high hopes of this look at what some still call \"The Tan War\" by Stirling University historian Michael Hopkinson. But though well informed and interesting, it fell short of what I'd hoped for. Part of the problem was Hopkinson's decision to focus each chapter on a different aspect of the armed struggle to free Ireland from incompetent British misrule after the First World War. While I can understand his reasoning for not recounting this horrifying tale of cruelty and revolution chronologically, the result is a series of confusing leaps in time and place. I found myself by mid-read having to double back to near the beginning to check which major players just mentioned were dead, in jail, or in America. The context of many events discussed is lost in these jarring leaps in time and space. I had hoped the book would do more to discuss the revolutionary aspects of Sinn Feinn and the IRA and explore how much that influenced the bitter civil war which followed the establishment of the Irish Free State. That said, Hopkinson does a fair bit of myth-busting. As with French claims after the Second World War that everyone was in The Resistance, few Irishmen it would appear were not out with the bhoys of flying columns in 1920-21. Most of the deaths, on both sides, were due to squalid sectarianism and were the work of a tiny minority of activists. If wars are won by the slightly less incompetent side, the Irish nationalists and republicans took the prize. This is an interesting read but did not live up to its early promise. It ends abruptly with the Truce which accompanied the final deal. Not really fair on those who are unable to secure a copy of Hopkinson's book on the Irish Civil War, which one must presume takes up the story with the treaty talks.\n\n365. Withdrawal from Empire\n\nby General Sir William Jackson\n\nThis 1986 book purports to be a military view of how the British Army handled the years 1945 to 1982, when it was involved almost constantly in some campaign associated with the dissolution of The Empire. In fact, there is as much discussion of politics as of military matters and perhaps even more of the former. But perhaps that is as it should be, because the withdrawal from empire was more of a political matter than a military one. General Jackson, a Royal Engineer, had an interesting qualification when it came to writing this book; he was official military historian to the Cabinet Office. So, he had an inside view. Perhaps he had too much of an insider view. Incidents such as the Scots Guards' 1948 Batang Kali Massacre in Malaya are simply ignored. This is even though it seems highly possible that the massacre of 24 ethnic Chinese rubber plantation workers by a Scots Guards patrol in 1948 was a matter of deliberate policy which was sanctioned at a high level. Apart from this and similar omissions regarding the dirty side of some very dirty wars, the book is usually a fair enough summary of events as seen from Whitehall. The United States does not come out of Jackson's account well and neither do the rulers of India. The book ends with a warning that the British Army was too focused in the 1980s on Germany and NATO and needed to prepare more for what the Americans call Expeditionary Warfare. Two of the things he said should be priorities were sufficient number of infantry battalions and helicopters. Twenty years later in Afghanistan and Iraq both were still sadly lacking.\n\n364. Bravely into Battle\n\nby Strome Galloway\n\nThis is the story of the World War Two experiences of one of the Canadian Army's legends, Strome Galloway, in his own words. With his distinctive moustache and consciously British mannerisms, Galloway cut a striking figure on the battlefields of North Africa and Italy. But he was no fool and was also brave. The \"Bravely\" in the title supposedly refers not to him but to the rank and file who followed him into action, or were sent to death or serious injury by him. The original title was \"The General Who Never Was\". That perhaps speaks to his disillusion with the Canadian military establishment. Towards the end of the conflict the tiny pre-war regular officer corps looked after its own, with a collective eye on peacetime careerism, by putting inexperienced members in command positions over the heads of battle-hardened veterans in a primitive system of ticket punching. The same policies came close to destroying the American military in Vietnam 20 years later. Galloway had been a reservist before the war and worked as a newspaper sub-editor and reporter. I found his writing strong and his eye for a story, comic or tragic, good. He was among a handful of Canadian officers and senior NCOs sent to serve with the British Army in North Africa to gain combat experience; his own service being as a company commander with the London Irish. He then served with the Royal Canadian Regiment in Sicily and Italy. This was a good and a quick read with some interesting insights into wartime soldiering.\n\n363. Bloody April\n\nby Peter Hart\n\nWhat makes this different from most books I've read about the war in the air 1914-18 is that this one also looks at what's happening on the frontlines down below on the ground as well. Peter Hart of the Imperial War Museum explains why it was so important that British pilots and aerial observers went up into the skies over Arras in the spring of 1917 in aircraft that were easily outclassed by their German foes. The answer, if you haven't already guessed, was to act as spotters for Britain's war-winning artillery. And it is these men, rather than the more high-profile fighter pilots, that Hart declares to be the true heroes. For numbers and courage were the only two things the Royal Flying Corps had going for it during what became known as Bloody April. Hart, not surprisingly as he is (or was) the IWM's oral historian, leans heavily on first-hand accounts from the airmen on both sides. There is little romanticizing of the participants as \"Knights of the Air\". This is a balanced and honest account told mainly in the words of those who took part in the grim battle between the pioneers of aerial warfare. One very minor complaint I have is that there is not much in the book from Canadians. By May 1918 more than a third of the RFC/RAF pilots were Canadian and I believe the Canucks would have represented a very large proportion of aircrew a year earlier. Perhaps Hart focused a little too much on British sources for his information.\n\n362. Zulu Rising\n\nby Ian Knight\n\nThis is another one for the 2017 Book of the Year shortlist. One of Britain's acknowledged experts on the 1879 Zulu War, Ian Knight, revisits the disaster at Isandlwana and the epic defence of Rorke's Drift, immediately afterwards, for the umpteenth time in his writing career. But rather than a stale retread, Knight has knitted together a gripping narrative that neatly captures the nightmare. He draws on not only British and white settler accounts but also on Black African sources, both Zulu and those who allied themselves with the British. More than half the book is gone before the fighting begins but the background and sense of time and place woven into Knight's narrative means this is not a drag. Knight's exhaustive knowledge of the terrain comes through and his writing skills make the landscape as much a character in this tale as the men involved. Squalid and violent deaths feature far more than any glory but Knight also captures the bravery of men on both sides. But he is also not slow to highlight some less than creditable behaviour. This is not just a book about the Zulu War but also about all wars. Anyone who has seen the film versions of the destruction of the British force at Isandlwana and the subsequent defence of Rorke's Drift, Zulu Dawn and Zulu, will learn some truths and have some myths busted for them.\n\n361. Tank Force\n\nby Kenneth Macksey\n\nThis book is part of the old circa-1970 Purnell's Illustrated History of the Second World War which had the aim of providing a series of \"short, crisply but authentically-written, narratives, richly illustrated throughout the text with photographs, maps and diagrams\" all written by subject experts. Macksey was in his time one of Britain's top writers on the subject of armoured warfare and its practitioners. In this one Macksey takes a look at British, French and United States armoured warfare during the Second World War. The first couple of chapters look at the evolution and development, or lack of it, of armoured warfare in the three countries between 1918 and 1939. Then Macksey spends a couple of chapters looking at why the more numerous and often superior tanks of the French and British armies failed to stop the German panzers in 1940. The action then switches to North Africa where Macksey concludes the Germans were still superior in their use of armoured forces and that the British commanders are out of their depth against the Germans for much of the time. Macksey then canters through the 1944-45 campaign in Northwest Europe to finish, just as the war ends, with the excellent British Centurion tanks still sitting under their tarps somewhere in Europe. Macksey knows of what he writes: he joined the Royal Tank Regiment in 1941 and picked up a Military Cross before war's end. I was pleased to see Macksey was not overly impressed with General George Patton, rating Major General Maurice Rose a better commander of US armoured forces and the US 1st Army's commander Courtney Hodge's Patton's equal. Macksey also notes the British Guards and 11th Armoured Divisions, and not American units, were responsible for the fastest and most sustained pursuit of the Germans after the Normandy Breakout.\n\n360. Scapegoats\n\nby Michael Scott\n\nI liked the idea of this look at 13 cases of military injustice written by a retired commander of the Army in Scotland. So, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't as good as it could have been. I wondered if retired Major General Scott himself has an axe to grind and was trying to make some kind of a point when he wrote the book - perhaps to do with his own command of the 2nd Scots Guards during the Falklands War. Some of the supposed victims of injustice didn't seem particularly hard done by. The military is just as, if not more, prone to petty jealousy and workplace intrigue as most jobs on civvie street. But it should be noted that two of Scott's subjects were executed, so the consequences of injustice can be far more serious than simply not getting a well-deserved promotion. Some of Scott's attempts to give background to the cases were plodding and not always easy to follow. I'm not sure if Scott preferred a well turned phrase to accurate analysis when he said all Americans were united against the British during the American War of Independence. He fails to mention that Major General William Erskine was certifiably insane and knowing that might have helped understand the circumstances surrounding the 1811 scapegoating and suicide of Lt.-Col. Charles Bevan. The disturbances at the notorious Etaples reinforcement depot in 1917 might have been more understandable if Scott had explained that Military Policeman Harry Reeve did more than fire two or three shots over the heads of a crowd of soldiers. He put a bullet in the head of Cpl. William Wood of the 4th Gordon Highlanders and many soldiers believed he did it deliberately. And I'm not sure of how hard Scott tried to track down relatives of Lance Corporal Jesse Short, who was executed for mutiny days after events at Etaples. The family may have been able to comment on some of Scott's speculations regarding Short.\n\n359. Business in Great Waters\n\nby John Terraine\n\nBetter known as a historian of the First World War, John Terraine takes a sober and sombre view of U-Boat warfare in both World Wars. He starts his sorry tale in 1916 when Imperial Germany first went for broke in imposing an economic blockade of the United Kingdom through the application of unrestricted submarine warfare. A wiser man than I said wars are often won by the side which makes the fewest mistakes and the U-boat campaigns are an excellent illustration of this. Terraine weaves together the various and varied strands in what appears to be a very well researched piece of work. One of the most striking features is how close the Royal Air Force came to losing the Second World War by failing to realise the value of air cover for the Atlantic convoys, and perhaps even the importance of the convoys, and instead insisting that Germany could only be defeated through strategic bombing. The Royal Navy failed to recognise the lessons of the First World War and had to relearn most of them, at an appalling cost in human lives, over several years. Luckily, the dysfunctional Nazi regime self-sabotaged its own best chance of bringing Britain to its knees. knees. Terraine gives just about enough attention to the experiences of the sailors, aircrew and submariners to keep the reader engaged but casts his net wide to include technology, signals intelligence, command and control, overall strategy, inter-allied relations and sensitivities, and even personality issues. This is an excellent account of one of the most complex and crucial campaigns in modern warfare.\n\n358.

But this history of the Special Air Service during the Second World War is not his best work. I had the chance to pick up a copy last Christmas at a bargain price but something made me hang back. I then saw the lacklustre TV series based on the book in which Macintyre seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time wearing a natty leather jacket and driving around in a jeep. But it didn't seem fair to hold a disappointing TV outing against a book. So, when I spotted Rogue Heroes at the local library I thought I'd give it a chance. The book is based on the SAS's own records. Sadly, it would appear that there isn't much in those records that hasn't already been uncovered by the legions of writers and former members of the regiment who have already delved into the SAS's record during the Second World War. Basically, if you've never read a book on the subject, then this will be of interest. If you want to have read every book that has been written about the SAS, then this isn't a waste of time. But there is little new or insightf"
