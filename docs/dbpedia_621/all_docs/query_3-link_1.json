INTRODUCTION The USS Monitor is unquestionably one on the best known warships in American history. Virtually every school child has heard of the \"Monitor-Merrimack\" battle in Hampton Roads. Her peculiar \"cheesebox-on-a-raft\" appearance, with the turret as the prominent feature, is familiar to students of the Civil War and naval history in general. Even -her commanding officer during the famous engagement, John L. Worden, is usually recognized by name. But how many are aware that this ironclad vessel-of-war had six commanding officers during her brief existence? Worden was the first, followed by Samuel Dana Greene, Thomas 0. Selfridge, Jr., Thomas H. Stevens 11, William N. Jeffers, and John P. Bankhead. All were professional naval officers, members of an elite group that Peter Karsten in his book, The Naval Aristocracy: The Golden Age of Annapolis and the Emergence of Modern American Navalism, called \"Mahan's Messmates,\" in reference to the fact that they, like the famous naval officer and writer Alfred Thayer Mahan, came of age professionally at a time when the naval officer corps was developing its espirit de corps. The Naval Academy, established in 1845, was in its infancy but the \"messmates\" recognized its enormous value to the profession. The Civil War was The War to many of them, and in fact the majority would never engage in combat again after 1865. They matured during a period of transition in naval warfare, from sail to steam, wood to iron and steel, muzzle-loading smoothbores to breech-loading rifled guns. The story of each of the six men described in this report stands alone; yet it will also be noted that their paths crossed frequently. One additional point is worthy of emphasis: these officers were together involved in most of the major actions of the Civil War and a large number of minor ones; they saw service in all of the geographical areas and different squadrons; and they participated in nearly every type of activity in which the navy was involved during that five-year period. In short, their combined story constitutes a \"case history\" of the Union Navy. The six men, although different in age and personality, had one thing in common: they were the only ones to command the Monitor. 77 Figure 1. John Lorimer Worden (Photograph courtesy of the U.S. Naval Historical Center) 2 JOHN LORIMER WORDEN John Lorimer Worden was born in Sing Sing (now Ossining), Westchester County, New York, on March 12, 1818, the son of Ananias and Harriet Graham Worden. Ananias Worden was a farmer of modest means. On June 10, 1934, at the age of sixteen, Worden was appointed an acting midshipman in the United States Navy and ten days later was assigned to the eighteen-gun sloop-of-war Erie. The Erie was under orders to join the Brazil Squadron, and for three years Worden served on this warship in the South Atlantic. On this station young Worden first learned his trade as his vessel provided protection to Americans and their property during a period of revolution and instability in South America. Worden was detached from the Erie when she arrived in Boston early in September 1837. After a lengthy period of leave, he returned to Boston and was assigned to the recently launched sloop-of-war Cyane. He remained on the Cyane for eighteen months before receiving orders to the naval school at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Twenty-one-year-old Worden, a veteran of more than four years of active naval service, arrived in Philadelphia two days before Christmas, 1839. Until after the War of 1812, midshipmen received no formal education beyond that provided by chaplains and schoolmasters on board naval vessels. In 1816 Congress authorized schools at Boston, Norfolk, and Philadelphia which midshipmen could attend voluntarily between voyages. Worden spent seven months at the Philadelphia school, successfully completing the coursework and written examination. On July 15, 1840, he was promoted to passed mishipman. After leave he was sent to sea on the store ship Relief, which was attached to the Pacific Squadron. For nearly three years the Relief provided logistical support for units of the Pacific Squadron along the west coasts of North and South America. In 1843 Worden was detached from the store ship. On September 16, 1844, while home on leave, he married Olivia Taffey of Quaker Hill, New York. They would have four children during their long marriage. On April 7, 1844, Worden was ordered to the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., the first of three tours that he served at the observatory. He was one of a number of young officers assigned to this facility, most of them engaged in examining ship's log books and tabulating the results in geographical scales for every month of the year. Although tedious duty, it did allow Worden to be with his wife and during this period the first of their children was born. He purchased a house on K Street, which would be considered home for the remainder of his life. The year 1846 was a milestone year in Worden's career. He was warrented a master in August and promoted to lieutenant in November. He was then ordered to join the store ship Southampton as executive officer. Worden's promotion and assignment coincided with the first year of the Mexican War. The Southampton, under the command of Lieutenant Robert D. Thorbum, was ordered to carry provisions to the units of the Pacific Squadron operating along the coast of California. Arriving on the west coast in the summer, the Southampton was used to carry supplies and reinforcements to army and naval units scattered along the coast. When the squadron initiated a blockade along Mexico's coast, the store ship carried provisions and supplies to the blockading vessels. Worden apparently served briefly on other vessels in the Pacific Squadron before being ordered home. He arrived in New York in the summer of 1849 and, after leave, was assigned to a second tour of duty at the Naval Observatory. Throughout the 1850s he followed the usual ship-to-shore routine, serving on vessels in the Mediterranean and Home squadrons. He 3 served on the frigate Cumberland from April 1852 to February 1855; on the sloop-of-war Levant for four months; at the Naval Observatory, October 1855 to March 1856; at the Brooklyn Navy Yard until July 1856; and finally as first lieutenant on the frigate Savannah until November 1860. In 1861 Worden was a forty-three-year-old lieutenant, a veteran of twenty-six years of service. His record was satisfactory but certainly not distinguished. Although on active service during the Mexican War, there is no evidence that he saw combat. As has happened many times in history Worden, at that time a middle-aged officer whose career was thus far average, would be catapulted to fame by the chance of war. On the eve of the Civil War Worden, aware that time was passing him by, confided \"that the greatest hope of [his] existence\" was to become a naval hero. On April 6, 1861, Worden reported to Washington under orders \"for special duty connected with the discipline and efficiency of the naval service.\" Worden later wrote, \"I asked to be relieved from those orders and to be assigned to duty afloat, which was granted.\" Nonetheless, he did not immediately get the sea duty that was promised: \"That night near midnight I was sent for by the Secretary of the Navy who informed me that he wanted me. to go at once to Pensacola with dispatches for Captain Henry A. Adams. . senior officer commanding the United States Squadron standing off Fort Pickens. Fort Pickens and Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor were two of the last vestiges of Union authority in the southern states that had seceeded earlier. President Abraham Lincoln was determined to hold on to all Federal property in the southern states that still remained in Union hands, including the two forts. Immediately after Lincoln was inaugurated, reinforcements and supplies were forwarded to the forts. On the afternoon of April 6, a dispatch arrived from Captain Adams stating that, because of an agreement between the United States government and Confederate authorities, he had declined to obey orders from Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to land troops and reinforce Fort Pickens. Welles recorded in his diary that [Prompt action] was all important .... But, in the general demoralization and suspicion which pervaded Washington, who was to be trusted with this important mission? . . . Paymaster Etting was in Washington, and I sent for him . . . About five o'clock he reported to me that Lieutenant John Worden had just arrived [in the city], that he would vouch for him as untainted by treason. Welles sent for Worden. He was instructed to carry a message to Captain Adams ordering him to land the troops immediately. Worden was also told to memorize the contents of the message and chew it up and swallow it in the event of capture while en route. He was to leave early in the morning, but in the meantime he was not to mention this assignment to anyone, including his wife. Early on the morning of April 7, Worden left by train for Richmond and from there for Pensacola. He was stopped several times and in Atlanta had a narrow escape when, as ordered, he destroyed the dispatch just before he was searched. He was not arrested, however, and reached Pensacola on April 10. Before he could obtain transportation out to Adam's flagship under flag of truce, he was taken to the headquarters of General Braxton Bragg, commanding Confederate forces at Pensacola. Worden was given a pass after informing Bragg that he had verbal instructions for Captain Adams. Bragg would later insist that Worden used the words \"message of a pacific nature,\" although Worden's account does not mention this. Worden was also informed that he would be permitted to return to Washington by rail, providing neither Worden nor Adams violated the agreement. On the morning of April 12, Worden reached the flagship and delivered his message to Adams. 4 Worden returned to Pensacola that afternoon and boarded the first north-bound train. While he was riding northward, Bragg received intelligence that Fort Pickens was to be reinforced. Convinced that Worden's message had led to this action, Bragg ordered his arrest. Worden was apprehended and taken off the train at Montgomery, Alabama, where he was incarcerated in the city jail. He thus became the Confederacy's first prisoner of war. For seven months--from April 13 to November 13--Worden remained in prison in Montgomery. During this period Mrs. Worden, supported by various naval officers, interceded with Secretary Welles to obtain his release. Unfortunately for Worden, his situation was caught up in the decision by the Lincoln administration to avoid any action that might imply recognition of the Confederacy. Even after the Battle of First Manassas and other engagements in which thousands became prisoners of war, no effort was made to negotiate an exchange of prisoners. Worden knew little of the efforts on his behalf. Although he was apparently well treated by Confederate authorities, he received few communications from the North. In October, Flag Officer Lewis M. Goldsborough, in command of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, proposed to Confederate authorities in Norfolk the exchange of a Confederate naval officer captured at Hatteras for Worden. As a result of these negotiations, Worden left Montgomery on November 13 for Richmond. From there he was taken to Norfolk and, on November 20, the exchange took place under a flag of truce. Although his health had suffered during the strain of imprisonment, Worden was anxious for active service. On December 3, after a short period of rest and relaxation, he reported to the New York Navy Yard for duty. On January 11, 1862, Commodore Joseph Smith, a member of the \"Ironclad Board\" established to supervise the Union Navy's armored vessel program and an old family friend, offered Worden the command of the ironclad being built by John Ericsson. \"This vessel is an experiment,\" he said. \"I believe you are the right sort of officer to put in command of her.\" That afternoon Worden hurried to Greenpoint, Long Island, where the vessel was under construction. Convinced that the unusual warship might \"prove a success,\" Worden informed Commodore Smith by return post that he would be willing to \"devote whatever capacity and energy I have to that object.\" His transfer was processed rapidly, and on January 16 he reported for duty to command the new vessel. Why was Worden, a lieutenant who had never held a command, selected as captain of a warship that was experimental but certainly attractive to more senior officers? It was more than likely a combination of factors. Worden had impressed Navy Department officials, particularly Welles; nearly all officers senior and a number junior to him had already been assigned commands and positions; he was known to Commodore Smith who, as head of the Ironclad Board, was in a position to make the assignment; and finally, he was in the right place at the right time. At that time Worden was described by one of his officers as tall and quite effeminate looking [man], notwithstanding a long beard hanging down his breast--he is white and delicate probably from long confinement and never was a Lady the possessor of a smaller or more delicate hand .... He is a perfect gentleman in manner. It seems likely that Worden's appearance was not normal at this time. He was still recovering from his earlier ordeal and according to Lieutenant Samuel D. Greene, who was appointed the ironclad's executive officer, was \"a sick man,\" who accepted the command \"against the protests of his physicians and the entreatment of his family.\" Nonetheless, he plunged into getting the new vessel launched and operational. 5 There is nothing unusual in a commanding officer being assigned to a warship still under construction. It provides the captain with time to familiarize himself with his vessel from stem to stem and make any recommendations concerning alterations or modifications that he feels necessary. Although Worden consulted with Ericsson, there are no records concerning any changes that he recommended. Worden also had the responsibility of mounting the ship's ordnance and assembling a crew. On January 20, four days after Worden assumed command, John Ericsson recommended that the warship be named the Monitor. Ten days later, with both Worden and Ericsson on board, the vessel was launched. In the following days, workmen hurried to complete the vessel. On the day after the launching, Worden got the warship's boilers under steam for the first time. With volunteer seamen reporting from the receiving ships, he and his executive officer, Lieutenant Greene, began putting together a watch, quarter and station bill, and assigning the men to their stations. By the middle of February the turret, with its two XI-inch Dahlgren guns, was operational. On February 19 the Monitor had her first underweigh trial run. Six days later the vessel was commissioned and the crew officially took over the warship. Althouah the Monitor was supposed to leave for Hampton Roads on February 27, she was delayed because of mechanical problems. On March 3, under Worden's command, the armored vessel had another trial run to check out her steering qualities and to fire the guns for the first time. Three days later on a clear and cold day, the Monitor was towed out of New York City harbor and out into the Atlantic. The weather deteriorated during the night and, according to the ship's paymaster, Worden was one of many of the crew who became seasick. As the full force of the storm hit, waves began to dash across the ironclad's exposed deck. Water began to seep below in increasing amounts, causing damage to the vessel's blowers and engines and threatening to sink her. Although exhausted from his illness, Worden struggled to keep the vessel afloat. The seas began to moderate early the morning of March 8, and Worden was able to get some rest, leaving the vessel in the capable hands of his executive officer. At noon they passed Cape Charles, at the southernmost tip of the Maryland Peninsula, and entered Chesapeake Bay. During the afternoon as she slowly approached Hampton Roads, still under tow, firing could be heard in the distance. Later when the pilot was taken on board, the crew learned that a small Confederate force, including the ironclad Virginia, had attacked Union vessels in Hampton Roads and had done considerable damage. Worden ordered his ship cleared for action and the turret \"keyed\" up off the bronze ring, ready to turn. Shortly after dark the Monitor slipped her tow, entered the Roads, and by 9:00 P.M. had dropped anchor near the Roanoke, which carried the senior officer afloat. Worden went on board the Roanoke and conferred with the senior officer. There he learned that the Monitor was ordered to the Potomac to defend the river approach to Washington, D.C. The decision was made to ignore the order, and Worden was ordered to defend the Minnesota, which had run aground during the day's action with the Confederate vessels. Before returning to the Monitor, Worden wrote a hurried note to his wife, informing her of his arrival in Hampton Roads and adding, \"the Merrimac has caused sad work amongst our vessels, but... can't hurt us.\" The Monitor anchored during the night near the Minnesota while the crew got what sleep they could. With daybreak, Worden ordered steam raised and after breakfast was piped down and hastily consumed, the anchor was raised and the Monitor steamed slowly along under the towering side of the Minnesota. Paymaster Keeler later wrote, \"Captain Worden inquired of the Minnesota what he intended to do. 'If I can't lighten my ship off I shall destroy her,' Captain Van Brunt replied-4 will stand by you to the last if I can help you,' said our Captain.\" As the early morning mist had lifted, the Monitor's crew observed the Confederate ironclad approaching. \"A puff of smoke arose from her side and a shell howled over our heads and crashed into the side of the Minnesota,\" Keeler wrote. \"Captain Worden, who 6 was on deck, came up and said more sternly than I ever heard him speak before, Gentlemen, that is the Merrimac, you had better go below.\" Worden, along with the pilot and quartermaster, crowded into the small pilot house while the executive officer commanded the turret. Worden was supposed to pass his orders to Lieutenant Greene through the speaking tube, but the tube did not work. The paymaster was then used as a messenger between the two officers. Worden ordered the quartermaster to steer directly for the enemy ironclad and once they cleared the Minnesota, he sent word to Greene, \"Commence firing.\" The battle commenced at approximately 8:00 A.M. and ended nearly five hours later. During this long period, the two ironclads pounded each other mercilessly. Throughout most of the encounter, the range was brutally short--less than a hundred yards. Worden hoped to loosen the Virginia's armor by firing at point-blank range, while the Confederate ironclad's captain planned to ram or board his opponent. The Virginia was able to ram once, but the Monitor turned in time and received only a glancing blow that did no damage except to the Virginia, which sprung a leak. The Monitor was hit by the Confederate armorclad's heavy guns (twenty-three hits were counted) but with little effect. On one occasion Worden went out on deck to check for damage, and while in this exposed position the Monitor was hit. Shortly after this the Virginia was able to avoid the Monitor briefly and score several hits on the Minnesota, but before serious damage could be done the Confederate ship ran aground. As the Monitor moved in close to the stranded Confederate warship, a Confederate shell exploded directly outside the pilot house, partially raising its heavy iron cover and driving powder fragments into Worden's eyes and face. Paymaster Keeler wrote, I was standing near, waiting for an order, heard the report which was unusually heavy, a flash of light & a cloud of smoke filled the house. I noticed the Capt. stagger & put his hands to his eyes--I ran up to him & asked if he was hurt. 'My eyes,' says he, 'I am blind.' With the assistance of the Surgeon I got him down & called Lieutenant Greene from the turret. A number of us collected around him, the blood was running from his face, which was blackened with the powder smoke. He said, 'Gentlemen, I leave it to you, do what you think best ... Save the Minnesota if you can.' Worden was taken to his cabin and placed on the sofa under the care of the surgeon. There he remained until evacuated after the battle was over. The wounding of Worden may have saved the Virginia. The Confederate vessel had run aground and was immobilized when the Monitor's commanding officer was wounded. While he was being attended to, however, the Union warship stood clear of the Virginia and during this period the Confederate vessel worked her way clear. Lieutenant Greene decided not to continue the fight but simply to guard the Minnesota. Because of some damage, the falling tide, and the belief that the Monitor had apparently withdrawn from the engagement, the Virginia's commanding officer made no attempt to renew the fight but withdrew towards Norfolk. Accompanied by a close friend, Lieutenant Henry A. Wise, Worden was taken ashore and put on the Bay Line steamer for Washington, D.C. In 1888 Worden recalled the help that Wise rendered him in a letter to Wise's daughter: To his friendly care and attention in bringing me from Hampton Roads after my injuries in the Monitor and putting me in his own bed at his home 7 in Washington, and the devoted care and attention given to me there, for several weeks by himself and his wife, I am largely indebted for my recovery from the injuries I received, and their resulting complications. Worden had been seriously wounded and spent more than eleven weeks recovering. According to a statement accompanying a petition for a pension for Mrs. Worden after her husband died, ... the injury was produced in a great measure from unburned powder, minute portions of iron from the broken bar of the pilot house being driven into the texture about his eyes. The powder and iron were driven in great quantities into the texture about the lids and the integumen over the temples. Turnefaction was very great, as likewise the pain, so that no thorough attempt was made to remove some portions of the powder and iron that were embedded in the tissues. Worden's face was permanently blackened and the sight in his left eye was destroyed. Worden never completely recovered his health . \"My head was all knocked to pieces at Hampton Roads,\" Worden later said. \"For three months, I lay unconscious and when I woke to life again, I was a mental wreck. Since then I have never known the time when I wasn't suffering both physical and mental pain.\" He said this in 1895, two years before his death. During the latter part of May 1862, he was able to return to his summer home in New York. There he consulted an occulist and his eyesight greatly improved. While recovering Worden was lauded for the battle. Messages of praise, congratulations, and sympathy showered upon him during his months of convalescence. In Washington President Lincoln visited him and thanked him for his efforts to save the country. The state of New York presented him with a sword and testimonial. Twice, on July 11, 1862, and February 3, 1863, he received the thanks of Congress for \"skill and gallantry.\" In July he was promoted to commander. Not all joined in the adulation. Some naval officers questioned the praise lavished on him, stressing that although Worden had commanded his ship ably until incapacitated by his wound, that was no more than what any commanding officer of a warship should have done. Flag Officer Samuel DuPont wrote his wife on May 13, 1862, \"1 saw in the last paper that Lieutenant Worden had gone to the Senate Chamber with a handkerchief round his head and was Lionized--this pained me much and shows he is a weak man, I don't care how brave.\" Flag Officer Charles H. Davis wrote that Commander John Rodgers called my attention to the difference between the praises and honors awarded to Worden and the neglect shown to [Lieutenant George] Morris [commanded the Cumberland], although the latter's courage and patriotism were put to the severest test. He fought his guns while his ship was sinking, and cheered as she was going down. Such are the charm of novelty and success.' 8 John Ericsson, in a speech before the New York Chamber of Commerce, lauded Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers, who was on board the Monitor as a volunteer and assisted Lieutenant Greene in the turret. Ericsson said that the success of the Monitor was due frentirely. . to the presence of .. Stimers.\" Although Worden protested in a letter to Ericsson when he heard of this remark, Ericsson reiterated this on several occasions. On May 8, one day less than two months since he was wounded, Worden received orders to the ironclad New Ironsides under construction in Philadelphia. He apparently never joined the vessel and was detached shortly before she was commissioned. He was then ordered to New York to assist in the construction of ironclads at the Navy Yard. There is little question that he was detached from the New Ironsides and ordered to shore duty in New York because he had not recovered sufficiently for an active sea command. Apparently he had recovered by the end of the year, at least to the satisfaction of the Navy Department, because on October 8 he was ordered to take command of the Montauk, a new and improved single-turreted monitor built by Ericsson at the Continental Iron Works in Greenpoint. The following day the new warship was launched. It was commissioned on December 14. On Christmas Eve, the Montauk departed New York for duty with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and arrived at Port Royal, South Carolina, in the middle of January 1863. Worden would see considerable action during the six months that he commanded the Montauk. Shortly after she arrived at Port Royal, Flag Officer DuPont, in command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, ordered Worden to Ossabow Sounds, Georgia. DuPont wanted to test the new monitor type against land fortifications and instructed the Montauk's commander to attack Fort McAllister, about ten miles up the Great Ogeechee River. Another objective was the destruction of the Confederate raider Nashville, which was lying under the guns of the fort waiting for an opportunity to slip through the Union blockade. On January 27, Worden attacked the fort. His volunteer signal officer wrote, It was a dull morning and too early for anybody to feel hungary [sic]. Besides most of the Montauk's crew had never been under fire .... We started up the river at five minutes of seven .... It was ebb tide and we steamed up grandly. All at once we passed a clump of trees, and the fort was in plain view.... No sign of life appeared in the fort as we approached--not even a flag .... At 7:30 we were within fifteen hundred yards of the fort, and let go anchor. Five minutes later, at the word of command, the turret beneath us began slowly to revolve. A few moments and the big eleven-inch gun was at range, elevated for fifteen hundred yards. 'Stop!' and the turret came to a standstill. 'Fire!' and for an instant one's heart stood still, waiting. Then the floor of the pilot-house lifted and heaved and shook with the mighty roar of the gun a few inches beneath, and a moment later a great shell exploded just short of the enemy's work. But ... we discovered that the fortress was not abandoned. At 7:40 precisely there came a flash from up there and a well-aimed ten-inch shot struck us on the gunwale, raising a ruffled edge on one of the plates, but doing no damage .... We now loaded and fired as fast as possible .... Above and about us shells exploded, rattling against our armour, making 9 an infornal raket [sic], but doing little or no harm. The smoke got very thick about the pilot-house, blowing in at the peep holes, and annoying Worden so that presently he went below to inspect the working of the turret and to note the effect of the heavy guns upon the vessel . . . . We now realized that we had underestimated our enemy. Our ammunition was running low, and while we had pounded the works severly [sic] and made a good deal of sand fly, we had apparently done little harm . . at noon when our last shells were nearly gone we weighed anchor and dropped down the stream... An hour later we were at our anchorage, counting our scars. Five days later the fort was attacked again. During the second attack Worden anchored his vessel 150 yards from the obstructions that guarded the fort and once again opened a deliberate fire, but with the same results. As B. S. Osbon, the signal officer, wrote, \"Our battle of February Ist was a repetition of our former action, much intensified.\" During this engagement forty-six shells struck the monitor without doing any damage. DuPont later wrote, I sent him [Worden] with his ironclad to see what he could do--mainly to test in earnest the power and capabilities of his vessel .... He made the attack, fired away all his ammunition and made but little impression. . . Still we gained a great deal of information as to the management of those vessels. Two days after the attack Worden was promoted to captain. During the evening of February 27, the Nashville was observed to be underway above the fort. Within a short period, however, it was observed that she had run aground. At daylight the following morning, the Montauk moved up to approximately 800 yards from the fort and opened fire on the still-grounded Confederate vessel. The Nashville was visible behind the fort where the river made a sharp bend. Osbon, who was in the pilot house with Worden during the engagement with the Nashville, wrote, At seven minutes past seven o'clock we fired our first shot ... at the Nashville ... the smoke from our gun rises slowly, and we cannot see the effect of the shell. . Yrom the fort they are firing [at us]. But we pay no attention to the fort, not returning any of its fire. Again we send a shell where the smoke hides her from us. The fifth shot, that entered near the foremast, has done its work, and we can see a column of whitish-gray smoke issuing from her fore- hatch, and in five minutes more tongues of flame leap out with the smoke, high into the air .... We fire our last shot at three minutes after eight o'clock, having fired fourteen times. When the smoke lifted the Nashville was discovered to be in flames and approximately an hour later her magazine exploded. 10 The monitor, undamaged from the fort's fire, began to withdraw down river, but a torpedo exploded under the hull and she started taking on water. \"Captain Worden turned to the pilot and said to him, 'Murphy, can't you run me ashore here in some good placeT \" The Montauk was run ashore, a piece of boiler iron fastened over the hole, and she resumed steaming down the river. DuPont wrote that \"Worden was so worried at the idea of his vessel being injured that ... he could not enjoy his success,\" and added, \"Everyone says what a lucky man Worden is--that is true in one sense, but it is not everyone who would have gone right up under the fort again.\" This from a naval officer who was somewhat critical of Worden's actions after the Monitor-Virginia affair. D. Ammens, in The Atlantic Coast, wrote that in later years Worden was prouder of the destruction of the Nashville than of the battle with the Virginia. Within two weeks of destroying the Nashville, the Montauk was moored in the North Edisto River near Charleston along with six other armorclads including the New Ironsides and the Keokuk. The Navy Department had instructed DuPont to attack the forts guarding the entrance to Charleston harbor, and the flag officer decided to make the attack with all of his ironclads. At noon on April 7, the nine armored vessels stood up the channel in single line ahead with the Weehawken leading, followed by the Passaic and the Montauk. The Montauk came into action at 3:05 P.M., firing her XI-inch and XV-inch Dahlgrens at Fort Sumter. At 4:30 DuPont ordered the vessels to disengage and withdraw; the attack had failed. During the engagement the Montauk had fired only twenty-seven times and in turn had been hit fourteen times but with no material damage. The nine ironclads together delivered only 139 rounds during the approximately one-hour-and-forty-minute-battle. Worden's futile attacks on Fort McAllister had demonstrated to DuPont that monitors were not suitable as offensive vessels to attack strong land fortifications. The April 7 bombardment was made despite the flag officer's reservations, and he strongly disapproved of it to the Department. He wrote Secretary Welles, I remind the Department that ability to endure is not sufficient element where-with to gain victories, that endurance must be accompanied with a corresponding power to inflict injury upon the enemy ... that the weakness of the monitor class of vessels . . .is fatal to their attempts against fortifications. Worden agreed and later strongly denounced monitors in assaults against forts before a court of inquiry. The April 7 battle was Worden's last, not only for the war but for the remainder of his career. DuPont wrote his wife, Poor Worden will return home; his nervous system is shatered [sic] ... He has struck me with intense admiration since he has been here, and when I told him he should go in time and pleasure and that no medical survey was necessary, and that I felt proud at having had him under my command, he wept like a child. Worden returned to New York where he was once again given responsibilities concerning the construction of ironclads in the city. As before, he was apparently placed on a kind of limited-duty status in order to regain his health. He was still in this position when the Civil War ended, and in fact retained it until February 1866. In August he was assigned to command the steamer Pensacola in the North Pacific Squadron but was relieved in May 1867. For the next two years he was at home \"awaiting orders,'.' except for a brief period of \"special duty.\" For six months of this period he visited Europe. On May 27, 1868, he was promoted to commodore. On December 1, 1869, he was ordered to the Naval Academy as superintendent. Worden's tenure at the Academy was not particularly impressive, at least in part because he made no secret of his belief that midshipmen would benefit more from being on board warships than at Annapolis. Lieutenant George Dewey, later admiral, was aide to Worden. In his autobiography Dewey described one incident that illustrated Worden's \"Old Navy\" perspective: He had a midshipman up for some infraction of discipline, and he broke out: 'Where you ought to be; young man, is not ashore in a landsman's school, but on board a ship, where you would learn the business of being a seaman in the same hard school that I learned it.' At this, well knowing the admiral's views on the score, which were often repeated, the midshipman grinned slightly, perhaps unconsciously. 'Don't you grin at me or I will throw you out of the window V Worden blazed. The midshipman's face went very stiff and sober at such a 'dressing down' from the autocrat of Annapolis and one of the great heroes of the war. For some reason I myself could not resist a smile at the situation, and the admiral caught me at it, too. For a minute I did not know but he might try to throw me out of the window. However, he controlled his temper and said nothing. There is also a story in Dorothy Michelson Livingston's biography of her father, Albert Michelson, in which Worden chides the future Nobel Laureate: \"If in the future you'd give less attention to those scientific things and more to your naval gunnnery, there might come a time when you would know enough to be of some service to your country.\" One history of the Naval Academy said, \"Worden was not an innovator .... No doubt he would have been entirely at a loss if anybody had suggested that he should embark upon any radical reforms.\" He made no noticeable changes in the Academy's curriculum or organization and very little so far as the grounds and facilities were concerned. His administration was most noted because of difficulties over hazing plebes by upperclassmen and the admission of the Academy's first minority midshipman. Several Japanese were enrolled and in 1872 the first Black midshipman was appointed by a Reconstruction congressman from South Carolina. Although most of the officers and faculty apparently were not quite ready for emancipation, they did everything they could to prevent problems. Two more Blacks were appointed during Worden's time at the Academy but none graduated. In early 1874 Captain C. R. P. Rodgers, Worden's successor at the Academy, wrote the Secretary of the Navy: The admirable condition and very high state of efficiency in which the Naval Academy was left, by my predecessor, Rear Admiral J. L. Worden, left me little to do, but to continue the routine of his administration and follow in his steps. I feel under 12 great obligation to him for the care he has taken to make my succession easy and agreeable. In September 1872, Worden was relieved as superintendent, and on November 20, promoted to rear admiral. Three months later Worden was ordered to assume command of the European Squadron. The European Squadron was activated towards the end of the Civil War in order to seek out and destroy Confederate cruisers in European waters. The squadron's peacetime mission evolved around supporting American diplomatic, commercial, and military interests abroad. Support was at times simply showing the flag; at other times, it involved a demonstration, intervention, \"police action,\" or what became known as \"gunboat\" or \"battleship\" diplomacy. I The parsimonious nature of Congress in the post-war years so far as the military was concerned affected Worden's squadron. His force was gradually reduced until, by the fall of 1876, it consisted of one third-rate wooden sloop-of-war, the Marion. A distressed Worden wrote the Navy Department that \"for two weeks the Marion was in the yard, and there were no American warships to protect American interests.\" This situation changed, however, because of trouble in the Ottoman Empire. In the spring of 1876 an insurrection broke out in some of the Ottoman possessions in the Balkans. In the months that followed the disorders spread into other parts of the Empire, including Constantinople. The American minister to Turkey appealed to the State Department for naval protection. Worden took advantage of the crisis to urge reinforcing his squadron. The appeal did little good, however. He was able to send only two vessels, the Franklin and the Marion, to the eastern Mediterranean. Worden took the Marion to Constantinople to help guard American interests there. In October the crisis deepened with the imminent possibility of war between Russia and Turkey. Once again Worden pleaded for more ships. The Department promised him two additional vessels, the Vandalia and Trenton. The Vandalia arrived at the end of November, but the Trenton did not arrive until the following March. Before they arrived, however, Worden's predicament became ludicrous. At one point, while the Marion was undergoing repairs in a French shipyard, he had hoisted his flag on a hotel in Nice. It became something of a joke to the French, who referred to it as 'Tamiral Suisse.\" On April 24, 1877, Russia declared war on Turkey. Under orders from Washington, Worden concentrated the entire European Squadron in Turkish waters. The Vandalia was sent to Constantinople, the Marion and Trenton to Smyrna, and a recently arrived fourth vessel, the Alliance, was stationed off the Syrian coast. Throughout the summer and early fall months, the squadron remained in Turkish waters. The vessels were still there in October when Rear Admiral William E. LeRoy relieved Worden. The European Squadron was Worden's last active comand. In the last years of his career, he served as president of both the Naval Retiring Board and Examining Board. In December 1886, he voluntarily retired after fifty-two years in the navy. According to a letter that he wrote to a newspaper reporter in March of that year, his health was not good. In fact, during the last years of service he was hospitalized on six different occasions for various illnesses. Although he would live nearly nine years after retiring, the few surviving pieces of correspondence suggest that he remained in poor health. We know very little about these years. He lived in Washington, D.C., but spent his summers at Quaker Hill, New York. One of Worden's neighbors and friends at Quaker Hill was General Lew Wallace, the author of Ben Hur. Wallace and Worden frequently took walks together. In Washington, Worden served as president and governor of the Washington Metropolitan Club, and according to one account was one of the \"best known and most popular residents of the nation's capital.\" Rear Admiral Worden died suddenly of pneumonia on Monday, October 18, 1897, at his K Street home in Washington. He was eighty years old at the time of his death. A 13 state funeral was held for him at Saint John's Episcopal Church on October 20 with President McKinley, members of the cabinet, and a large number of naval officers present. He was buried in Pawling, New York. Worden was not a brilliant officer, but a brave and competent one. He was greatly respected by his fellow officers. In 1891 Captain C. R. P. Rodgers wrote another officer concerning a campaign to erect a statue to Admiral David D. Porter at the Naval Academy: \"I should like to see such a statue to Porter, placed at Annapolis, and later one to Worden.\" 14 v U N t& 4@g 6- fl, \"-1. \"i-RA A M, n. 4 U V, j aj PP . . . . . . . . . . &W \"M jli ;6A U le @j p C\"':\"\"' _'p 'q, Iq I @ -o' PM Ago' J i\" 0 5 ro '4 MOW Ra!@ 'A 4@1 Z M R .1 ilk Figure 2. Samuel Dana Greene (Photograph courtesy of U.S. Naval Historical Center). 16 SAMUEL DANA GREENE Samuel Dana Greene was bom on February 1, 1840, in Cumberland, Maryland, of New England parentage. His father was George Sears Greene of Rhode Island, a regular army officer who was promoted to brigadier general two months after the Monitor-Virginia battle. On September 21, 1855, Samuel entered the navy as an \"acting midshipman\" on probation at the Naval Academy at Annapolis. One of his classmates was Alfred T. Mahan, who occasionally remarked on midshipman Greene in letters to friends. In one letter Mahan mentioned that Greene had been caught by the officer of the day after a prank, and in another he was critical of Greene's actions while both were on their way to New York for the holidays. Referring to this incident Mahan wrote, \"It takes at least twenty gentlemen to remove the bad impression made by one rowdy.\" With the exception of this lone criticism, Mahan's impressions suggest that Greene was a typical midshipman, studious when necessary, but quite willing to challenge the Academy's sense of propriety at times. He apparently never got into serious trouble and graduated in 1859, seventh in a class of twenty. Promoted to midshipman, he was ordered to the Hartford upon graduation. Greene was apparently a plank owner on the Hartford, which was commissioned in May 1859 at the Boston Navy Yard where Greene reported on board. The Harf@rd was a steam sloop- of-war carrying twenty-four guns. She was ordered to join the East India Squadron as the flagship of Commodore Cornelius K. Stribling. In November 1859, she embarked the American minister to China, John Elliott Ward, at Hong Kong and carried him to Canton, Manila, Swatow, Shanghai, and other Far Eastern ports to settle American claims and to arrange for favorable consideration of the nation's interests. Her presence as a symbol of American sea power materially contributed to the success of Ward's diplomatic mission. We know nothing of Midshipman Greene's life during these months in the Far East, but he must have had a successful cruise as he was promoted to lieutenant before returning home. With the outbreak of the Civil War the Hartford, along with most of the other warships on distant station, was ordered home. She arrived in Philadelphia on December 2, 1861, nearly nine months after the firing on Fort Sumter. There Lieutenant Greene was detached and after a brief leave, volunteered for service on the Monitor. The shortage of junior officers in the navy is the probable explantation for the fact that Greene, at twenty years old, was appointed executive officer of the vessel. The paymaster described the newly appointed executive officer as \"a young man ... in regular service, black hair and eyes that looked through a person and will carry out ... orders.\" In contrast to Captain Worden, Greene was clean-shaven and his youthfulness did not retard the crew's respect for him. A crew member of the Florida, where Greene would later be executive officer, mentioned in his diary that Greene seemed \"to be a very good sort.\" Apparently, Worden and his new executive officer worked well together, as Worden always spoke very highly of him. Greene assisted Worden in preparing the Monitor for sea. It was Greene, as executive officer, who had the responsibility for assigning crew members to their watches and quarters. He was also gunnery officer and began training the crew at the two Dahlgrens in the turret. Under tow of the tug Seth Low, the Monitor departed New York on March 6, 1862. Within twenty-four hours the vessels ran into heavy weather as they plotted their way southward towards Hampton Roads. Worden, obviously still weak from his months of being a prisoner of war, became seasick. As the storm increased, the Monitor began to 17 take on water. The water coming down the blower vents resulted in the breaking of a fan, which put the blowers out of service. Carbon dioxide spread from the engine room up to the berth deck, forcing the crew to abandon those spaces. Greene hurried below to make sure no one was left. \"I was nearly suffocated with the gas myself, but got on deck. . Just in time. . . .\" Greene later wrote. Efforts to pump out the water failed and for a while it looked as if the Monitor might sink. Fortunately, the tug was able to pull the foundering ironclad in closer to land where the water was considerably calmer. The gas was then cleared out. The engineer repaired the blower and restarted the engines and pump. Worden was still ill, so Greene volunteered to take the watch. Near midnight the weather had calmed to the point that Greene also retired. Within a brief period, however, the waves picked up, again flooding the vessel. About 3:00 A.M. the weather moderated once again, but with Worden still incapacitated, a nervous Greene remained on watch. The period from then until dawn was, Greene said ...... the longest hour and a half I ever spent. \" During the following day, March 8, the vessel was cleaned, repairs made, and normal routine re-established. At noon the vessels entered the Chesapeake Bay and by early afternoon they had passed Cape Henry and were approaching Hampton Roads. We know little of Greene's activities from the time firing was heard in the distance to the following morning when the battle with the Virginia commenced. We can assume that he had his responsibilities as executive officer in preparing the vessel for combat. Greene does mention that he and Worden remained on deck throughout the night. \"At 11 P.M.,\" Greene wrote, \"I went on board [the stranded Minnesota] ... and asked the Captain what his prospects were of getting off. He said he should try to get afloat at 2 A.M. when it was high water .... I told him we should do all in our power to protect him from the attack of the Merrimac.\" The following morning the Confederate vessels, including the Virginia, made their appearance, steaming towards the stranded Minnesota. Worden took his station in the pilot house and Greene took command of the turret. When firing was heard in the distance, Greene sent paymaster Keeler to the pilot house for permission to open fire. (The speaking tube that connected the turret with the pilot house was not working). Worden replied, \"Tell Mr. Green [sic] not to fire till I give the word ...... Shortly afterwards, Greene was ordered to \"commense [sic] firing.\" It was approximately 8:45 A.M. when Greene fired the first shot at the approaching Confederate armorclad. Throughout the morning hours, the two ironclads slugged it out at ranges from more than a hundred yards to at times almost touching. Greene wrote his parents, I had not slept a wink for 51 hours. But after the first gun was fired [11 . . .forgot all fatigue, hard work and everything else .... We loaded and fired as fast as We could. I pointed and fired the gun myself. Every shot I would ask the Captain the effect, and the majority of them were encouraging. Both vessels bounced shot and shell off each other's sides with little effect. The fact that the Virginia would escape with little apparent damage led later to criticism of Greene's gunnery. In his report, Worden praised Greene's, gunnery and years after the war, in a letter to a reporter, wrote that \"claims of Lieutenant Greene's poor gunnery is all bosh.\" His gunnery was accurate; his guns simply could not penetrate the Virginia's armor. When Worden was wounded by a shell striking the pilot house, Greene was ordered to take charge of the vessel and to \"use [his] own discretion.\" The Monitor had withdrawn from the action after Worden was wounded, and during the approximately half- hour period before Greene assumed command, the two protagonists drifted apart. Shortly after Greene took over, the Virginia was observed apparently retiring in the direction of Norfolk. The Virginia's commanding officer later wrote that when the Monitor retired into 18 shoal water (when Worden was wounded), he assumed that the Monitor had broken off the engagement. By this time the Monitor was approximately a mile from the Confederate ironclad and Greene turned his vessel towards the Minnesota. \"We had strict orders, Greene later wrote, \"to act on the defensive, and protect the Minnesota.\" Greenedidnot pursue the Virginia for this reason and also because of Worden's wound and the need to get him more medical assistance. Finally, he considered theVirginia's movement towards Norfolk an indication that the Confederate ironclad was beaten. After anchoring near the Minnesota, Worden was evacuated and the ship secured from combat conditions. Later in the evening Gustavus Fox, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, came on board and said, \"Well, gentlemen ... you don't look as though you were just through one of the greatest naval conflicts on record.\" \"No sir,\" replied Lieutenant Greene. \"We haven't done much fighting, merely drilling the men at the guns a little.\" Despite the executive officer's flippant remark, there is little doubt that Greene, as well as his inexperienced crew, had been under enormous tension throughout the day. Greene told his parents that I had been up so long, had had so little rest, and been under such a state of excitement, that my nervous system was completely run down. Every bone in my body ached, my limbs and joints were so sore that I could not stand. My nerves and muscles twitched as though electric shocks were continually passing through them ... I laid down and tried to sleep, but I might as well have tried to fly. The next morning we got under weigh at 8 o'clock and stood through our fleet. Cheer after cheer went up from frigates and small craft for the glorious little Monitor .... I was Captain then of the vessel that had saved Newport News, Hampden [sic] Roads, Fortess Monroe . . . and perhaps four Northern ports. Greene's exaggerated sense of accomplishment and self-adulation is understandable. 14@ was a very young officer who, through fortutious circumstances, had found himself in command of a warship that, even to those present at the time, realized its historic importance. Also, Federal leaders from President Lincoln down had been convinced that the Virginia was a threat to Washington, New York City, and other cities along the eastern seaboard. Greene's exhilaration as captain was all too brief On the afternoon of March 10, Greene received a note from Assistant Secretary of the Navy Fox informing him that Lieutenant Thomas 0. Selfridge, Jr., had been appointed temporary commander. \"Of course I was a little taken about,\" a disappointed Greene wrote, for he apparently hoped that he would receive command. He told his parents, \"Between you and me I would have kept the command with all its responsibilities and either the Merrimac or the Monitor should have gone down in our new engagement. But you know all young people are vain, conceited and without judgement.\" Greene returned to the unrecognized and unrewarded (as far as the public was concerned) responsibility of executive officer and remained in this position until the Monitor went down off Cape Hatteras. He would serve under four commanding officers during this ten-month period. The Monitor would remain in Hampton Roads until the Virginia was destroyed by her own crew. Early in June the Monitor sorteed up the James River and, along with other Union warships, engaged Confederate batteries at Drewry's Bluff. Afterwards she would operate in the James and Appomattox rivers, occasionally exchanging fire with 19 Confederates, interspersed.with trips back to Hampton Roads. In September she was ordered to the Washington Navy Yard for alterations and overhaul before returning to Hampton Roads two months later. Throughout this period, Greene's name was never mentioned in the occasional reports or pieces of correspondence from the Monitor's commanding officer. We know nothing about him during these months except for one incident mentioned in a letter from the ship's payrnaster to his wife. In the latter part of June, the Monitor accompanied a small Union flotilla up the Appomattox River to destroy a railroad bridge. Because of the shallowness of the river near the bridge, the attack was to be made by a number of small boats. Greene was in charge of one of these small boats. The attack, however, failed and the vessels returned back downstream with the bridge still intact. In December the Monitor was ordered to join a blockading squadron further south, and on December 29 departed Hampton Roads under tow of the steamer Rhode Island. During this last voyage of the Monitor, Greene again acted creditably and courageously, particularly during the ship's final hours. When the ship was finally abandoned, Greene took charge of evacuating the crew into the small boats sent by the Rhode Island. As the Monitor pitched and rolled in the mountainous waves, Greene struggled to get the men into the boats. The ship's surgeon, Greenville Weeks, wrote, Greene nobly held his post, seized the rope from the whaleboat, wound it about an iron stanchion, and then around his wrists, for days afterwards swollen and useless from the strain. His body servant stood near him, 'Can you swin, William?' he asked. 'No,'replied the man. 'Then keep by me, and I'll save you.' The captain and Greene were the last in the boat, which then returned to the Rhode Island. The Monitor's commanding officer, John P. Bankhead, in his official report of the vessel's loss, wrote, I would beg leave to call the attention of the Admiral and of the Department of the particularly good conduct of Lieutenant Greene and Acting Master [Louis] N. Stodder, who remained with me until the last, and by their example did much toward inspiring confidence and obedience on the part of the others. In February 1863, Commander Bankhead was ordered as captain of the USS Florida, a side-wheel steamer purchased by the government and converted into a naval vessel for blockade duty. At Bankhead's request, Greene was assigned as executive officer. On March 9 the Florida, with the new monitor Nantucket in tow, left the New York City Navy Yard to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She joined the squadron early in April, and for the next twenty-one months patrolled the North Carolina coast, capturing a steamer and a number of blockade runners. We know very little about Greene during this period. The letters of Paymaster Keeler, also aboard the Florida, to his wife occasionally mention Greene such as when he drilled the gun crews or took possession of one of the prizes. Early in August 1863, Commander Bankhead became ill and had to be sent north for treatment. Once again Greene was a temporary commanding officer until another one was assigned. During the night of August 15, the Florida, under Greene's command, gave chase to a blockade runner near Wilmington but without success. Two days later he had another opportunity. 20 On Monday, the 17th, at about 7 p.m., discovered a strange sail standing directly up for the squadron. From our masthead made her out to be a small side- wheel, beam-engine steamer, painted white; ordered the Victoria to go out and see what she was. As soon as the Victoria started for her the strange sail altered her course more to the westward .... As this vessel was about underway and standing down for the stranger, discovered another vessel bearing E. and apparently a very short distance from us. This second vessel appeared to have a light illuminating her bow, but as soon as I started for him he extinguished his light, and it being very dark, nothing more was seen of him . . . . I now stood down in the direction of the dim light showing from the strange sail, bearing about W.S.W. The Victoria made the Coston [sic] signal 0, and I answered with the same, when the stranger immediately put out his light and nothing more was seen of him .... Nothing was in sight up the river in the morning, and I do not think either vessel went in. This was Greene's last opportunity. A week after the futile chase, a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander James Parker, reported on board and Greene resumed his executive officer status. Because of ill health Parker left within a few weeks, and Lieutenant Commander Walter W. Queen took command. Within a few days, Greene himself left the Florida. His reason for being detached was to get married. However, one wonders if the posting of two commanding officers over him was not a factor. He left the ship on September 20, and on October 9 he was married to Mary Willis Dearth of Bristol, Rhode Island. They would have three children before she died unexpectedly in 1874. In November Paymaster Keeler, still on the Florida , mentioned to his wife that he had received a letter from Greene informing him that He has been ordered on 'shore duty' at the New York Navy Yard, as a sort of Assistant Inspector of purchased vessels and is associated with Capts. Worden and Bankhead .... Mr. Greene wrote in fine spirits and said he had sent the messa box of his wedding cake but it has failed to reach us. Greene's shore duty was short-lived. On December 16, Keeler wrote that Greene had been ordered to the Iroquois and added, \"I hoped that his marriage would induce him to quit drinking but I fear it has not.\" There is no evidence other than Keeler's remark to suggest that Greene drank excessively. Heavy drinking was not that uncommon among naval officers during the Civil War. Keeler may well have been simply voicing his disapproval of drinking, entirely. In fact, he mentions that another one of the Monitor's commanding officers was a heavy drinker. The commanding officer of the Iroquois was Commander Christopher Raymond Perry \"Alphabet\" Rodgers, one of the most liked officers in the naval service. Greene presumably got along well enough with Rodgers for he remained executive officer of the Iroquois until the war was over. The Iroquois was a steam sloop-of-war which carried a battery of six guns. Under Rodgers' command, the warship served briefly in the North 21 Atlantic Blockading Squadron before being ordered to European waters. During the fall of 1864 and the winter of 1865, she remained stationed off Bordeaux, France, where several armored vessels were supposedly being built for the Confederacy. She then joined in the world-wide search for the Confederate raider Shenandoah . This search took the Iroquois around South America and across the Pacific, arriving in Singapore in May 1865. With the war over, she sailed in July for the United States, arriving in New York on October 1, 1865. Greene was immediately detached from the Iroquois and ordered to report to the Naval Academy as an instructor. He was also informed that, as of August 11, he had been promoted to lieutenant commander. For more than half of the period between 1866 and 1884, he was attached to the Naval Academy, serving at different times as instructor in mathematics; head of the Department of Astronomy, Navigation, and Surveying; assistant in charge of buildings and grounds; and aide to the superintendent. In 1868 Greene was ordered to the North Pacific Squadron with headquarters in San Francisco. For a brief period, he commanded the ill-fated, paddle-wheel gunboat Seginaw, which struck a reef and wrecked a few months after he left the ship. In 1872 he was promoted to commander. Between 1875 and 1877 he commanded the steam sloop-of- war Juniata and the training ship Monongahela. When Greene assumed command of the Juniata, the vessel was a unit of the European Squadron. Once again Greene and Worden crossed paths, as Worden was flag officer of the squadron at that time. In November 1875, Worden was ordered to send the Juniata to Port Royal, South Carolina, where a large force of warships was being concentrated because of trouble with Spain over Cuba. When the crisis ended and the vessel returned to European waters early in the new year, Greene was detached to take command of the Monongahela. For nearly a year and a half, Greene commanded the Monongahela, which served as a training ship on the Atlantic coast. The vessel was used primarily to carry midshipmen on their annual cruises. His final sea duty came in 1882, when he was appointed to command the Despatch, a converted steamer purchased and fitted out for dispatch duty because of her speed. By the time Greene took her over, however, she had been converted into a training ship to instruct cadet engineers for the Naval Academy. She was also occasionally used for ceremonial functions by the President, the Secretary of the Navy, other members of the cabinet, congressmen, etc. In 1884, Greene was detached from the Despatch and ordered to the Portmouth Navy Yard as executive officer. On December 11, 1884, while at the Navy Yard, Greene committed suicide. The Concord Evening Monitor of Concord, New Hampshire, wrote in its December 12, 1884, issue, Commander S. Dana Greene, U.S. Navy, equipment officer in the Portsmouth navy yard, and one of the most popular officers in the service, committed suicide Thursday afternoon. His lifeless body was discovered in the Franklin shiphouse at this yard, with a bullet wound in the head, and a 38 caliber revolver in his right hand. He had been observed to act strangely for some time, and had been watched for fear that he might take his own life. As executive officer of the Monitor in the fight with the Merrimack, he took an important part in that encounter. Anxiety over the preparation of a literary work on that subject is thought to have resulted in temporary insanity. 22 A biographical sketch of Greene in the Dictionary of American Biography states that \"the cause assigned for this act was anxiety over an article on the engagement between the Monitor and Merrimac that he was preparing for publication.\" Presumably this is the article that was published posthumously in The Century Magazine and later in Battles and Leaders of the Civil War. In March 1895, Captain (later Rear Admiral) Alfred T. Mahan, one of Greene's classmates, wrote, \"My wife wrote me that a post mortern in Dana Greene's case showed an abcess [sic] at the base of the brain which could account for any degree of insanity.\" Years later Mahan wrote again about Greene's unfortunate death. \"There was, I think, some specific physical course that induced the brain trouble, which was aggrevated [sic] by a controversy he got into over the Monitor and Merimac fight. \" No specific information has been located to suggest what the \"controversy\" was. There is some evidence, however, to indicate that it concerned Greene's conduct while in command of the Monitor's guns and after Worden's wound, while he commanded the Monitor himself. In March 1886, Worden wrote a newspaper reporter that he would not engage in \"newspaper controversy over the fight\" but added that Greene's conduct had been satisfactory. On more than one occasion Worden defended his former executive officer. During the war, he became aware of criticism of Greene's conduct during the engagement and wrote to the Secretary of the Navy that \"Lieutenant Greene ... handled the guns with great courage, coolness, and skill; and throughout the engagement ... he exhibited an earnest devotion to duty unsurpassed in my experience.\" In retrospect, it seems probable that Greene allowed this criticism to weigh heavily over the years. He clearly expected to receive command of a vessel during the war, and it is possible that he blamed his failure to receive the coveted command on this criticism. The emotional strain occasioned by preparing the article apparently was a factor in his death, although the evidence suggests that he was in poor health at the time. Greene's death personified his life. He was perhaps the most unfortunate of the Monitor's commanding officers. Greene married twice. His first wife died in 1874 after eleven years of marriage. His son, Samuel Dana Greene 11, entered the Naval Academy and graduated in 1883 at the head of the class. A most promising career was cut short in 1900 when he and his wife drowned while ice skating. They apparently fell unseen and unheard through the cracked ice. What evidence we have suggests that Greene was a competent naval officer. He was respected by his peers and no criticism of his conduct by them has been found. 23 1 5, A A `4 -K A Z, A -w - jz@@ 6 \",-,;@_11@'j . . . ... . 4 41 ffig 'r\" SY g, -go p, z- 4@- \"j, @,,6, pi @C.IQV 31y i- , - ,@_ , , , \", @j ,4, Q g -y\", - g- @ V, \"' @ - , A, A.

During the evening of March 10, 1862, a young lieutenant, Thomas Oliver Selfridge, Jr., was ushered into the Monitor's wardroom where he found the ship's officers \"sitting together with Lieutenant Greene.\" Selfridge informed Greene that he had been \"ordered to command the Monitor.\" Thus began Selfridge's brief tour (four days) in command of the most famous vessel in the United States Navy at that time. Thomas 0. Selfridge, Jr., was the son of a distinguished officer in the navy, Captain Thomas Oliver Selfridge, Sr. Selfridge, Sr., entered the navy in 1818 and commanded a number of ships and naval stations before retiring in 1866. He died in 1903 at the age of ninety-eight, one of the oldest officers ever carried on the Navy List. The British Admiralty ordered their ships and stations to fly their flags at half mast in memory of Selfridge, Sr., the oldest admiral in the world when he died. Selfridge, Jr., was born on February 6, 1836, in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Selfridge would later write in his Memoirs that virtually from the cradle it was assumed that he would follow his father in a naval career. I-Es formal training commenced when he entered the Naval Academy at Annapolis in 185 1. Selfridge was the first officer to receive a diploma under the permanent Naval Academy system when he graduated in 1854 at the head of his class of six. Because of the need for more junior officers, his class graduated a year early. Soon after graduation, Midshipman Selfridge reported on board the Independence in New York City, preparing for a cruise as flagship to the Pacific Squadron. During the following two years, the Independence sailed around the Hom to California, and from there to the Hawaiian Islands, Samoa, Chile, and Panama. Josiah Tattnall, who would later command the Confederate ironclad Virginia, was captain of the Independence. Selfridge referred to Tattnall as a gunnery \"sharp\" and gave him credit for developing his expertise in gunnery. Selfridge, throughout his career, would place a considerable emphasis on gunnery practice. The young midshipman apparently impressed his commanding officer, for he was assigned as a regular watch and division officer, the only midshipman other than \"passed midshipmen\" so assigned. In the fall of 1856, he was ordered to Washington, D.C., where he successfully passed his examination for promotion to passed midshipman. Two years later, he would be advanced to the rank of master. In January 1857, Selfridge was ordered to the Coast Survey schooner Nautilus. There were not enough billets available for the entire officer corp in the late 1850s. Therefore a large number of officers were assigned to coast survey work, engaged in charting the rivers and harbors throughout the United States. The Nautilus, with Selfridge as acting master, surveyed the Rappahannock River in Virginia and the Hudson in New York before he received orders as master to the sloop Vicennes in the African Squadron. Survey work was considered tedious and boring by most naval officers, but it did provide them with much-needed experience in handling small vessels. The African Squadron had been established in the 1840s to aide in the suppression of the foreign slave trade. Because of the prevalence of yellow fever and malaria and the lack of attractive liberty ports, the African Squadron was universally disliked throughout the service. It was considered the least desirable of all the foreign stations. For two and a half years, Selfridge served on the Vincennes. He described that cruise as 25 very unpleasant, on account not only of the climate and the isolation, but also the unsociability, not to say tyranny, of our captain. All of the ship's officers were constantly harassed by him and often placed under suspension. My principal duty was that of navigator, though it frequently was necessary to take a watch when the other officers were sick. Selfridge concluded his account by saying that it \"was the most unpleasant one of my experience.\" In the summer of 1860 Selfridge was promoted to lieutenant and shortly afterwards was ordered to the frigate Cumberland, flagship of the Home Squadron. The Home Squadron included all commissioned vessels stationed on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Selfridge was on the Cumberland when the Civil War began. In April, the frigate was at the Gosport Navy Yard at Norfolk for repairs. When the yard was abandoned, Selfridge was detailed with a small number of men from the Cumberland to destroy equipment and facilities, to keep them out of Confederate hands. As the yard was set on fire the Cumberland, in tow of a small steamer, was taken down the mouth of the Elizabeth River and out into Hampton Roads. The Cumberland was employed in blockading the entrance to the James and Elizabeth rivers throughout the late spring and early summer of 1861. After a brief refit at the Boston Navy Yard, she was ordered to join the naval force off Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina. In August the Cumberland, along with other Union naval vessels, bombarded the two forts guarding the inlet. When the forts surrendered, the frigate returned to Hampton Roads and anchored in the mouth of the James River. There she was joined by the Congress to blockade the river. Six months later the two vessels were still on station near the river's mouth when the Confederate ironclad Virginia made her appearance. At 12.45 P.M. on March 8, 1862, lookouts on both the Cumberland and Congress observed three Confederate vessels steaming out of the Elizabeth River. As they got nearer, it was discovered that one of the vessels was the Virginia, converted by the southerners from the wooden sloop-of-war Merrimack. Both ships promptly beat to quarters and cleared for action. The Union vessels had ample time to prepare for battle, because the slow-moving ironclad took slightly more than an hour to steam within firing range. The Virginia's commanding officer intended to ram the Cumberland first--she had a much heavier battery than the Congress--then turn on the Congress. The Cumberland was anchored 800 yards from the shore, lying athwart the river with her bow outward, an unfortunate position because she could not be swung to meet her opponent. The Cumberland opened fire as soon as her guns could be brought to bear; the Virginia replied and, as the ironclad closed, the two vessels continued to exchange fire. The Cumberland definitely received the worst of it. Shots bounced off the ironclad's armor while shells from the Virginia penetrated the Union vessel's fragile hull and exploded among her crew. After raking the helpless wooden vessel for a few minutes, the Virginia rammed the Cumberland's starboard side, crushing her hull directly below the berth deck. Upon impact the ironclad fired one of her bow rifles into the stricken ship, killing ten men. The Cumberland began immediately to settle by the bow with a list to port. She nearly dragged the Virginia down, too, for the ram had stuck in the victim's hull. However, the ram broke and the ironclad was able to back clear. During the engagement Selfridge was in charge of the frigate's forward battery of six guns. He wrote in his Memoirs that even after the Virginia had rammed the Union warship and she was obviously sinking, the Cumberland's acting commanding officer, Lieutenant George N. Morris, refused to surrender. For nearly half an hour, until it was impossible to elevate the guns, he continued to fight. \"There were very few men left in the first division which I commanded for so long,\" wrote Selfridge. 26 Not a gun's crew could be mustered from the six crews of brave fellows who had gone into action so confident in their ship only three quarters of an hour before .... The appearance of the gun deck forward at this time can never be forgotten. It was covered with the dead and wounded and slippery with blood. Some guns were left run in their last shot; rammers and sponges, broken and powder-blackened, lay in every direction; the large galley was demolished and its scattered contents added to the general blood- spattered confusion. . . Meanwhile the water had been rapidly gaining in spite of the efforts of the after division which had been sent to the pumps .... The writer started aft, and on the way the ship gave a lurch forward, and water commenced pouring in through the bridle ports .... The order was passed for 'every man to look out for himself'; an order never given until the last extremity .... I was one of the last to leave the main deck, the water then being up to the main hatch .... The peril was imminent, and, throwing off coat and sword, I squeezed through a gun port. In doing so, however, the heel of my boot became jammed against the port sill by the gun, which, from a position partially inboard had slid outboard by the listing of the ship. For a few precious moments it seemed as though I must be carried down with the rapidly sinking ship; but with much difficulty, from a bent position I finally succeeded in wrenching off the boot-heel and thus freeing my foot. Then jumping into the icy water, encumbered by boots and clothing, I swam to the launch astern and was picked up exhausted. After Selfridge and the other survivors had reached the beach, according to one account, he saw the Cumberlands flag still flying at the masthead and with a small group of volunteers returned to the sinking ship and retrieved the flag. Another account by one of the Cumberland's officers mentioned that, while the survivors were standing on the beach, the Merrimack again opened fire on the Congress. The shells were flying over our heads in a very uncomfortable manner, when we met Lieutenant Selfridge near some large trees. A shell came whizzing along, passing over our heads and the pilot and I involuntarily ducked our heads and each of us got behind a good-sized tree, seeing which Lieutenant Selfridge, who was very much affected, said, 'Don't dodge, I wish one would kill me; I'd rather be killed than be whipped. . . .' Selfridge did not mention either in his Memoirs. He did write, 27 Furious over the loss of the ship in which I had taken such intense pride, shivering with cold from soaking wet and scanty clothing, the reaction from the long endured, frightful, experience of battle impelled me to tears, and I sobbed like a child. That evening Selfridge remained on the beach and the following day he, along with thousands of others lining both sides of Hampton Roads, witnessed the Monitor-Virginia engagement. After the battle was over, the Cumberland and Congress survivors were taken out to the Roanoke, the flagship of Captain John Marston, the senior officer present. Leave was granted to the survivors, including Selfridge. Before he was able to depart, however, a message came from Mr. Fox, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, who had come down from Washington on receipt of news of the Merrimac episode, that he wished to see me. Captain Marston had recommended me for the command of the Monitor in place of Lieutenant Worden, who had been wounded in the fight, and the Secretary offered me the honor. . . .1 thanked him for his confidence and replied that, 'if the Merrimac comes out, the Monitor will be on hand.' Selfridge, after reporting on board that evening accompanied by Engineer Alban L. Stimers, spent more than four hours thoroughly examining the Monitor from stem to stem. Selfridge would only command the Monitor for four days and says very little about this period in his Memoirs He did write that Early next morning [the day after assuming command] we proceeded to a position off the mouth of the Elizabeth River, and remained without being rewarded by a sight of the Merrimack. He did mention in a letter written in 1891 that he was responsible for the sloping pilot house that replaced the box-like one in which Worden had been wounded during the battle with the Virginia. Paymaster Keeler wrote on March 13, 1862, \"We are making some slight repairs ourselves, particularly in the pilot house, which proved, as I thought, to be the weakest and I might say the only vulnerable spot about us.\" On March 13 Lieutenant William N. Jeffers was ordered to relieve Selfridge in command of the Monitor. Selfridge wrote that Mr. Fox again sent for me and stated that, previous to his having ordered me to command the Monitor, he had sent a dispatch boat to Commodore [Louis] Goldsborough, the Commander-in-Chief of the fleet, who was then off the coast of North Carolina, directing that Lieutenant Jeffers be sent at once to command the Monitor. Mr. Jeffers had just arrived and the Secretary was obviously embarTassed at the situation. This was relieved by my pointing out that Lieutenant Jeffers was many years the senior, and that under the circumstances I could have no objection to his superceding me. 28 Selfridge then went on a month's leave and upon returning to Hampton Roads was given command of the Illinois, a large coastal steamer chartered by the government. Again the command only lasted a few days, as the vessel's charter was revoked. He then became flag lieutenant on the staff of Flag Officer Louis N. Goldsborough, in command of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In this position, Selfridge@ carried out a number of tasks including taking orders to various ship commanders and, after the occupation of Norfolk, the destruction of abandoned Confederate batteries in the vicinity of the port. In July Goldsborough resigned as flag officer and Selfridge journeyed to Washington, D.C., to obtain orders, hopefully to command a ship. Once again it was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Fox, who responded to the young officer's plea. Fox offered him command of the most unorthodox vessel in the navy at that time, the Alligator. The Alligator, which \"resembled a whale in external form,\" was a submarine. The vessel was built in Philadelphia during the fall and winter of 1861-62. She was 45 feet in length and 4 feet 6 inches in the beam, built along the lines of a steamship boiler with a riveted hull. Her propulsion consisted of eight oars on each side. On June 13, 1862, the navy accepted the submarine from her builder. Shortly afterwards, she was towed to Hampton Roads, but no suitable \"target\" could be found. Goldsborough considered the Alligator useless and obtained permission to send her to the Washington Navy Yard for further testing. The submarine was still at the yard when Selfridge received orders to command her. Selfridge commanded the Alligator less than two weeks. He carried out a series of tests and on August 8 reported to the Department that \"the enterprise is a failure.\" He had difficulty in controlling the vessel while submerged and stressed that she was extremely slow on the surface, unable to stem the tide. Selfridge and his entire crew, all volunteers, requested transfer and on August 9, he was ordered to take his men to Cairo, Illinois. (The Alligator was later lost off Hatteras while being towed to Charleston.) At Cairo, Selfridge received the good news that he had been promoted to lieutenant commander and also that he was ordered to command the Cairo. Selfridge took command of the Cairo at Memphis, Tennessee. She was 175 feet long, 511/2 feet in the beam with a 6-foot draft. Her battery of thirteen guns was enclosed in an iron armored casemate. The Cairo was one of seven gunboats of the type called the City Class because they were named after western river ports. During the first three months of Selfridge's command, the Cairo patrolled the Mississippi River, occasionally exchanging rifle and cannon fire with Confederate guerillas. On November 21, Rear Admiral David Porter, in command of the Mississippi Squadron, detailed the Cairo to an expedition being formed to attack Vicksburg, Mississippi. As a preliminary to this expedition, the Cairo was ordered to ascend the Yazoo River, which flowed into the Mississippi ten miles above Vicksburg, and clear the stream of mines. On December 12, 1862, Selfridge in the Cairo led a small flotilla of gunboats up the winding Yazoo. At approximately mid-moming the Cairo struck two mines. Her bow was lifted out of the water by the explosion. As the vessel began to settle, Selfridge shoved her into the bank. In twelve minutes the Cairo was completely submerged except for her stacks. Although no lives were lost and only a few men were slightly wounded, the loss of the Cairo earned Selfridge considerable criticism. A fellow officer wrote, \"On December 12 Lieutenant Commander Selfridge. . found two torpedoes and removed them by placing his vessel over them.\" Admiral Porter informed the Navy Department of the vessel's loss and remarked that the Cairo \"incautiously proceded too far ahead... when the torpedo exploded under her.\" He accused Selfridge of disobeying orders and added, \"My own opinion is that due caution was not observed.\" The admiral, however, apparently impressed with Selfridge's aggressiveness, later withdrew his censure: \"I can see in it nothing more than one of the accidents of war arising from a zealous disposition on the part 29 of the commanding officer to perform his duty.\" When Selfridge reported to Porter on his flagship, he asked the admiral if a court of inquiry was to be held. Porter replied, \"Court! I have no time to order courts. I can't blame an officer who puts his ship close to the enemy. Is there any other vessel you would like to have?\" Selfridge was then ordered to assume command of the Conestoga, whose commanding officer had recently been detached because of ill health. Porter informed the Navy Department, \"I have put ... [Selfridge] in command of the Conestoga ... trusting that he may be more fortunate hereafter, this being the second time during the war that his vessel has gone down under him.\" Selfridge commanded the side wheeler for five months. During most of this period she patroled the Mississippi River in the vicinity of the Arkansas and White rivers. Porter had divided up the Mississippi River and its tributaries into areas of responsibility and assigned units of his squadron to designated areas. The vessels were to patrol their assigned areas and protect shipping. According to Selfridge, his most notable achievement while in command of the Conestoga was to change the course of the Mississippi River. At the mouth of the Arkansas River was a long, narrow point projecting into the Mississippi, making an eighteen-mile turn necessary to get around it. This had become a favorite spot for guerillas to attack transports. One morning Selfridge noticed that much of the neck was flooded because of unusually high water and came to the conclusion that, by digging a small ditch linking the flooded water, the channel might be diverted. He put his crew to work with shovels and a small ditch was dug. It worked. By the following morning, the Mississippi was rapidly cutting through the neck and within a few weeks it was wide and deep enough for vessels to follow that channel. On the whole, however, Selfridge found his duty \"monotinous, and. . rather irksome, particularly since I felt that the unfortunate loss of the Cairo had kept me from participating in [the expedition against Vicksburg].\" In May 1863, the Conestoga needed to go north for repairs. Selfridge and his crew were transferred to the side-wheel gunboat Manitou. Less that two weeks after taking over the Manitou, he heard that General William T. Sherman had requested a battery of naval guns. The guns were to be landed and installed in positions to be used against the Confederates defending Vicksburg. Selfridge, anxious for more active service, immediately volunteered to command the guns. Porter approved and the Manitou's two 8-inch guns were landed early in June. From then until the end of the siege and surrender of Vicksburg, the battery fired constantly on Confederate positions. . More than a thousand rounds were fired and at least two Confederate cannon were put out of action. On the first of July, four days before the town's surrender, Selfridge was ordered to return to the Conestoga, which had rejoined the naval force near Vicksburg. Shortly after resuming command of the Conestoga, Porter ordered Selfridge to lead a raid up the Red River. In addition to the Conestoga his force consisted of the gunboats Manitou, Rattler, Forest Rose, Petrel, and Curlew. For the first time, Selfridge was appointed to command an expedition. The object was to capture cotton and supplies as well as to disperse any Confederate f 'orces along the river. The expedition was most successful. Entering the Red River, the gunboats turned into the Black River and afterwards into the Tensas River. Selfridge's small flotilla also reached Lake Tensas and the Little Red River, another tributary of the Red. Four steamers were destroyed, together with a large quantity of ammunition and provisions. After this expedition, the Conestoga returned to patrolling the Mississippi River. On March 8, 1864, she collided with the USS General Price and sank in about four minutes. \" Thus for the third time in the war, I had had my ship suddenly sunk under me,\" Selfridge wrote in his Memoirs . He added, \"It is a strange coincident [sic] that the name of these ships all begin with the letter'C'.\" Admiral Porter, in some disgust, said, \"Well, Selfridge, you do not seem to have much luck with the top of the alphabet.\" Selfridge was then placed in command of the ironclad Osage, far from the \"top of the alphabet.\" 30 He assumed command of the Osage two days after losing the Conestoga. The Osage was a river monitor, but unlike other monitors, she and her two sister ships were propelled by stem wheels. Unfortunately their wheels, protected by armored casings, made it impossible for the turrets to turn a full 360 degrees. The Osage was an unusual- looking vessel with virtually nothing showing above the waterline but the turret, the iron- plated house for the stem paddle wheel, and the tall thin stacks. Shortly after Selfridge took her over, the Osage joined other warships in Admiral Porter's squadron on the Red River expedition. On January 4, 1864, Major General Henry W. Hallack wrote Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, \"General Sherman and Steel agree with me in opinion that the Red River is the shortest and best ... base of operations against Texas.\" Banks was ordered to \"operate in that direction,\" as soon as there was \"sufficient water.\" Late in March, Bank's army of approximately 36,000 men started towards Shreveport, their line of march paralleling the Red River and Porter's squadron of thirteen gunboats. Passage up the narrow and crooked river was difficult and dangerous; the water was low and at places obstructed. Near Alexandria, approximately halfway to Shreveport, there were rapids, choked with rocks which seriously impeded navigation. Taking advantage of a rise in the river, Porter's vessels, including the Osage, passed through the rapids but could go little farther. On April 8-9, 1864, Banks' army was defeated and turned back in two battles. His troops began to retire back downstream and Porter had no choice but to do the same with his vessels. The admiral left Selfridge in charge of a rear guard division of four light ironclads several miles above Alexandria, while the rest of the squadron passed through the rapids above Alexandria. Because the river was so low a dam had be be built to enable the gunboats to pass throught the rapids. Selfridge's vessels were to prevent any Confederate effort to attack the squadron while this was going on. All but one of Porter's large gunboats made it through the rapids safely, followed shortly afterwards by the four light ironclads. With the end of the unfortunate Red River expedition, the Osage returned to patrolling the Mississippi. However, in May Selfridge was given command of a new vessel, the recently completed ram Vindicator. He also remained in command of a division of gunboats which had the responsibility for patrolling a small segment of the river. By the summer of 1864, nearly all Confederate resistance, including guerilla attacks, had ceased. Selfridge, bored with the lack of activity, requested a transfer. Admiral Porter had recently been ordered to command the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and intervened to get Selfridge sent to this squadron. In October Selfridge was ordered to command the gunboat Huron, a small vessel of 700 tons with a battery of one I 1-inch gun and a 30-pounder Parrott. Shortly after he assumed the command, the Huron was ordered to join the blockade off the Cape Fear River in North Carolina. The Cape Fear connected the port of Wilmington with the Atlantic Ocean, By 1864 Wilmington had become the most important center of blockade running in the southern states. Two forts, Caswell and Fisher, guarded the river mouth. Fort Fisher was considered by many to be the most powerful fort in the Confederacy. The navy had more than once urged that the forts be seized by amphibious assault, but until the fall of 1864 the army was unable or unwilling to provide troops. In the fall, however, priority was given to attacking Fort Fisher. The army made troops available and Admiral Porter assembled a powerful fleet to provide support. On Christmas Eve, 1864, Porter's fleet bombarded the fort, firing more than 20,000 shells. The Huron participated in the attack. The bombardment, however, proved fruitless. The army commander, Major General Benjamin Butler, refused to land his troops. Porter, chagrined at this failure, immediately made plans to launch a second attack. On January 12, 1865, his fleet once again opened fire on the fort. - During the following days more than 8,000 troops under Major General Alfred H. Terry landed under the fire of Porter's guns. On Sunday, January 15, 2,000 sailors and marines landed and attacked the seaward face of the fort while Terry's men assaulted from the land. Selfridge, in the thick 31 of things as usual, commandedone of the units of bluejackets and marines in the landing party. He later wrote, At a preconcerted signal the sailors sprang forward to the assault closely following the water's edge .... We were opened upon in front by ... artillery ... and by the fire of a thousand rifles. Though many dropped rapidly under this fire, the column never faltered [until] ... the head halted to allow the rear to come up. The halt was fatal. As the writer aproached with [his] division he shouted to his men to come on. . but looking back he discovered that his whole command, with few exceptions, had stopped ... the situation was a very grave one. The rush of sailors was over; they were packed like sheep in a pen, while the enemy was crowding the ramparts not forty yards away .... Flesh and blood could not long endure being killed in this slaughter, and the rear of the sailors broke, followed by the whole body. Although Porter blamed the marines for this repulse, claiming that they should have provided covering fire, Selfridge disagreed. \"The mistake was,\" he wrote, \"in expecting a body of sailors, collected hastily from different ships ... armed with swords and pistols, to stand against veteran soldiers armed with rifles and bayonets.\" Despite the failure of the sailors, Fort Fisher fell to Terry's troops. A few days later Caswell also fell, opening the river to Porter's ships. Selfridge, who had returned to the Huron after the survivors of the landing party had been re-embarked, was ordered to anchor his ship in the mouth of the Cape Fear River. The Huron was fortunate enough to capture two blockade runners that had entered the river, not suspecting that the forts had fallen. After Wilmington was occupied by Federal troops, the Huron was ordered to the James River to cooperate with Union forces moving on Richmond. The gunboat participated in no action, however, and she was still in the river when Richmond surrendered early in April 1865. The news of Jefferson Davis' flight led Porter to order Selfridge with the Huron to Key West, Florida, to intercept the Confederate president if he tried to flee the country in that direction. After this, the Huron returned to New York City and was placed out of commission. Selfridge had spent virtually the entire Civil War period on active service, most of it in combat zones. He had participated in numerous engagements, had had three ships sunk under him, and had been mentioned frequently in reports to the Department. As a naval officer who served with him wrote, Selfridge \"has lived a good while for a young man.\" He was twenty-nine years old when the war ended. Upon being detached from the Huron, Selfridge was ordered to report as executive officer to the Hanford, at that time preparing to leave for the Asiatic station. He requested shore duty in order to get married and was assigned to the Naval Academy as an instructor in the Department of Seamanship. In the fall of 1865 he married Ellen F. Shepley. They would have four sons. She died in 1905 and two years later he married Gertrude Wildes. While at the academy Selfridge was placed in command of the old Macedonian, which had been relegated to a training ship for midshipmen during the summer months. Practice cruises were made along the Atlantic coast and to Europe. A junior officer on the Macedonian wrote that Selfridge \"was an excellent officer, and while under his command the old Macedonian was a model in making passage from port to port.\" 32 . After three years of what Selfridge described as \"very pleasant duty\" at the Naval Academy, he was ordered to command the steam gunboat Nipsic. Selfridge's tour on the Nipsic lasted nearly two years, most of which was spent in the West Indies"
