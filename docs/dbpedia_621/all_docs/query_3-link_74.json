        "text": "This is the Rose Window (Center) and the Sower Windows (each side) that were installed in 1943 and ’44 respectively.\n\nThe Theme of the center window, the Rose Window, is carried out in the tradition of the 12th century French Glass. It depicts the first meeting of our Savior and St. Bartholomew. The border is alternately pierced with decorative symbols of the Dove and the Sword, the latter symbolizing the flaying of the martyred St. Bartholomew. This window, which was dedicated on the Easter Sunday of 1943, was given by Mrs. Mary Selfridge, as a memorial to her husband, Harold Selfridge, and his father , Admiral T.O. Selfridge.\n\nThe two windows on either side of the Rose Window were called by the artist the “Sower Windows” because of the medallions pictured which are scenes from the parable of the Sower. These windows were given by Mrs. Veronica Acheson Mackey, in memory of her husband, Cyrus Fay Mackey, and were dedicated on Easter Sunday April 9, 1944.\n\nThe three windows were created by George Snow Hill. This included the designing, cutting of the glass, and painting of the details, which were fired on the glass in a kiln. Then came the assembly and supervising the installation. His technique was based on the account given by the Monk Theophilus on the making of stained glass in the middle ages.\n\nMr. Hill was a resident of St. Petersburg and a communicant at St. Peter’s. He was well known for his talent and his works, which adorned numerous public buildings. Mr. Hill passed from this life in 1969. However, Mr. Hill’s works of the “Rose’ and “Sower” windows were carefully removed and reinstalled in the Church building at the time of its relocation to the 34th Street property. Mr. Charles Mackey then provided a gift of Lexan coverings from the outside to protect the windows. He gave these in memory of his mother, Mrs. Veronica Acheson Mackey. The success of the previously mentioned every member canvas resulted in the calling and acceptance of the Rev. Arnold Charnock.\n\nBy January 1st of 1946, the Diocesan Journal recorded 148 communicants at St. Bartholomew’s. Fr Charnock arrived for services at St. Bartholomew’s on Ash Wednesday 1946 and started with enthusiasm. Fr. Charnock was born in England. He first came to south Florida as a member of the Church Army. In New England teams had gone from place to place on bicycles. Florida’s distances were so great that they came by train and then traveled around the parishes and missions on bicycles. Twenty-mile rides by bicycle were not unusual for the clergy. It was said that Fr. Charnock continued his zeal and success even 20 years later.\n\nThe Church Army could best be described as the Episcopal version of the Salvation Army. It is reported that there were uniforms and ranks associated with Church Army personnel. It appears that the organization no longer exists except in a few Dioceses in other states. Fr. Charnock was engaged by Bishop Wing to go to the Marco Island area, a fishing village, in the ten thousand-islands. There he worked for two years at a miniscule salary of $50.00 per month with no car allowance. Then he went to the University of the South at Sewanee, and the DuBose Training School at Mont Eagle, both of which are in Tennessee. In 1943 he was ordained Deacon and in the same year he was sent to assist the Rector in Clearwater. While there he had various missions to which he ministered. He was put in charge, when he was ordained a Priest in the same year. From that point on, essentially his entire ministry was spent in Pinellas County. He worked in Safety Harbor, Clearwater, Dunedin and Tarpon Springs and for a time in New Port Richey. By 1947, the number had increased to 170. With this strength the congregation applied for parish status in the convention (presumably Diocesan) and were so admitted in 1947. St. Bartholomew’s had remained a mission from its inception in 1887 until this time when it became a Parish. During this same year the Church incorporated as a non-profit organization. The action is recorded in the Pinellas Circuit Court Clerk’s Office in Book 17, Page 331. 1948 was recorded that another increase in parishioners had taken place and the number was now, 207. With these numbers growing it was determined that a larger parish house was needed as well as other ancillary buildings. By the end of that year the parish had completed what they later called the “Original Parish House”. This was constructed of concrete block, single story containing an assembly room, kitchen and washrooms at a total cost of $47,000.00.\n\n1949 - 1951\n\nThe next year was 1949 and the usable space was used up and the congregation felt that it was too small for their growing needs. The communicant strength was now at 247 as of January 1st. The north side of the building was taken out and the north aisle was built. (This aisle is now the South aisle on the 38th Avenue South site.) St. Bartholomew’s continued to grow and by January 1st. 1950 the membership had risen to 285. The year of 1950 was a quiet year and the membership continued to swell to 390 by January 1st. 1951.\n\nSt. Bartholomew’s as it looked in 2005 at 38th Avenue and 34th Street South.\n\n2005\n\nAfter extensive action on the part of the Vestry and the Search Committee a selection was finally made to call the Rev. William V. Burkett to St. Bartholomew’s. Fr. Burkett accepted the call on January 2, 2005. The service of installation was conducted on March 22, 2005 at the Church by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Southwest Florida, the Rt. Rev. John Lipscomb.\n\nSt. Bartholomew’s had accumulated an endowment over many years of approximately $800,000. The endowments were the kind gifts of those parishioners who wished to provide funds for the Church during their lifetime or after their passing and in such a way as to provide for the Church in perpetuity. The endowments were provided generally in two forms. The first was “restricted”, in that the funds were to be invested and the proceeds used for the care and maintenance of the Church without encroaching on the principle. The second portion of the endowment included those funds, which were generally given to St. Bartholomew’s for investment in which the principle and proceeds could be used for either specified or unspecified purposes in maintaining the Church. During 2006 the endowment funds were transferred from a bank trust account to the Episcopal Church Foundation. This foundation manages the funds and provides a more favorable return on the kind donations of parishioners. Doing so provided improved stewardship of funds.\n\n2007\n\nSt. Bartholomew’s Church became involved in the strategic relocation of refugees, mostly from east Africa, which were victims of torture and attempts at genocide. Fr. Kivuva, from Kenya, Africa, became a part time assistant to Fr. Burkett. This partnership provided the bridge to the language barrier of the refugees. It also provided the opportunity for Fr. Kivuva to continue his African Mission Ministry as the refugees were assimilated into the United States culture, learned a new language and became self sufficient. The partnership also provided the opportunity for St. Bartholomew’s congregation to interact in a meaningful outreach ministry.\n\nThe financial stability of the Gulfwinds Montessori Academy became a liability to St. Bartholomew’s and the additional parishioners that were hoped for had not materialized. The Vestry, after considerable discussion and inquiry, made the business decision that the school must not be a financial burden to the Church. As of October of 2007 a committee was appointed to begin the process of closing the Academy. Over a period of time, it was observed that St Bartholomew’s was headed for financial problems. The land acquired from bank of America was sold to WaWa corporation as they developed the land adjacent to the Church. The property; was sold for $300,000 and this was added to the endowment fund. Steps were taken to lease out the Bidwell building to the precious Angels School, previously occupied by the Gulfwinds Montessori Academy. As time progressed additional revenue was needed and the school needed additional space. The result was to lease the office building to Precious Angels and move the administrative offices into the Sanctuary building. The necessary remodeling was accomplished, the Sacristy was relocated to the Mackey wing and the Administrator and Rectors offices were occupied. The thrift store, previously operated from The Bidwell building, was moved to the Parish Hall where it soon encroached sufficiently to occupy the entire parish hall effectively eliminating further social use of the hall. An emergency food pantry was opened, which was funded by the thrift store. Fr Burkett had a license from the state of Florida as a mental Health counselor. He did some counseling at the church and donated a portion of the proceeds to the Church.\n\n2020 - 2021: The Pandemic\n\nThe Covid Pandemic occurred during the period of 2020 and on into 2022. Parishioners began staying home in favor of virtual worship for their safety, and as the Pandemic had more vaccinations and began to diminish parishioners were reluctant to return and in this time Fr Burkett only remained serving at St Bartholomew’s until December of 2021.\n\n2022\n\nThe Vestry called the reverend Ethan Cole to be St Bartholomew’s rector beginning on 21 November 2022.\n\nThe Church Cemetary\n\nNo history of St. Bartholomew’s would be complete without some reference to the old cemetery now known as St. Bartholomew’s Cemetery. This Cemetery is located at 22nd Avenue South and 19th Street. Originally it was known as Oakdale Cemetery.\n\nWhen Dr. John Abercrombie presented the land on which St. Bartholomew’s was built, in 1887, he specified that a portion of it be reserved for a cemetery. It was thus that the earliest recognized cemetery in St. Petersburg to come into being. The first internment was for a Margaret Susan Beck, 27 years of age, buried on 19 May 1892. For some time the grave plots were sold for very little money in the belief that the owners would maintain the burial sites of their loved ones. Unfortunately, it became a common event that when a grave needed opening for burial that large amounts of vegetation would have to be removed in order to facilitate the burial. In 1944, St. Peter’s Church undertook to manage the cemetery on a paying basis. When the transfer was made the Vestry of St. Peter’s petitioned the Diocese for control of the cemetery and it was granted. St. Peter’s held control of the Oakdale Cemetery until 1953 when they voluntarily returned it to St. Bartholomew’s because of alleged problems accruing over 50 years and nebulous income. An additional factor that complicated the issue of the cemetery was that depression years and low incomes did not provide the opportunity for the purchase of burial sites and many unauthorized burials took place presumably under the cover of darkness. St. Bartholomew’s now petitioned the Diocese not only for its control but also for full title of all its church properties, which before this had been in the hands of the Diocese. The Diocese agreed and St. Bartholomew’s then appointed a Cemetery Committee who proceeded to put the Cemetery on a business basis using the same principles in effect in secular cemeteries in the city. The cemetery is still being used and lots are still being sold. As previously stated, the cemetery was once again transferred. St. Bartholomew’s petitioned the Diocese of Southwest Florida to take control of the Cemetery and with the approval of the bishop transferred management and a $40,000.00 perpetual maintenance fund to the Diocese. In any historical account of a cemetery there is a certain fascination with the stories of those buried there.\n\nThe first is the Rev. Dr. William J. Godden. This gentleman is first mentioned in these pages as the man who, at the first meeting, moved that St. Bartholomew’s take the first steps towards organizing and who served, as it’s first secretary. This occurred around April 20, 1887. He was born in England and studied law. He came to America in 1886 and settled in Pinellas, a settlement of English orange growers. Here he found an old friend Mr. H.W. Gilbart, who took him into his house and the two soon became partners. In 1893 he took charge of a drug store in Port Tampa City. This was the property of R.F. Altree M.D., a true friend who helped him greatly and instructed him in medicine. Bishop Gray proposed that Dr. Godden go and help at the Everglade Cross Mission where the Rev. G. O. Gibbs was the clergyman. He wished him to be the medical missionary to the Seminoles. The mission got its name from a cross close to it made by a bar being nailed to a palmetto palm tree. At first Dr. Godden declined, but afterwards accepted the assignment. In 1906 he came to the mission, which was in the heart of the Everglades, 75 miles south of Ft. Myers, its nearest railroad and source of supplies. A small hospital was built there. Soon after the hospital was built the Rev. Father Gibbs left and Dr. Godden remained to provide medical support to the Seminoles. An interesting sidebar is that a local trader was planning to sell his establishment to a known whiskey dealer; the Bishop in order to prevent this from happening bought the store so Dr. Godden also became a storekeeper. By 1912 he had also found time to study for orders and was ordained Deacon. He claimed three converts.\n\nMr. Gilbart in St. Petersburg went to see Dr. Godden nearly every year for a prolonged visit. Dr. Godden would send an Indian with a telegram to Fort Myers with a coin to tell him when to come so that the road would be out of the high water. The telegraph operator would then send the wire and Mr. Gilbart would travel to the mission for a visit. One year when the message did not come it was later found that Dr. Godden had died somewhere in the Everglades and the Indians had brought his body on an oxcart to Immokalee. Bishop Mann went down and held the funeral service there. Mr. Gilbart took an undertaker down with a coffin and brought back the body of Dr. Godden to be buried in Oakdale Cemetery. A bronze plaque is mounted on the back of the sanctuary commemorating the three major contributors to the founding of St. Bartholomew’s including Dr. Godden.\n\nAnother story is that of Dr. John Abercrombie, who gave the land for the church and cemetery. He died January 22nd 1912, at the age of 71. His love for the church was inherited. His grandfather was the greatly beloved Rector of a church in Philadelphia for many years. His father had been the surgeon of Bowie’s famous expedition to Texas. He had also been the assistant surgeon for the famous Selby Grays of the Confederate Army. After the surrender of General R. E. Lee at the Appomattox Courthouse, he walked all the way home from where he was assigned (the records do not identify where) with a bullet in his lung that the surgeons had been unable to remove. He settled in Mississippi and at one time owned one of the largest plantations in that state. In 1878 and 1879 he was in Memphis for the great yellow fever epidemic there. After this he came to St. Petersburg for his health. For years he practiced doing considerable good, especially for the poor. It is said he never declined to go on a call until his health became too impaired. Though his skill was great in his profession he is said to have been equally skilled as a naturalist and had a reputation for loving children.\n\nAnother notable burial is that of Captain J. F. Chase. Born April 23, 1843, He died November 28th 1914. He served in the Union Army and lost a leg in the service of his country. Captain Chase was in the 1st Maine Light Artillery unit at the Battle of Chancellorsville Va. during the Civil War. For his heroic efforts he was awarded the Medal of Honor. The Citation in awarding the Medal of Honor read; “Nearly all the officers and men of the battery having been killed or wounded, this soldier with a comrade continued to fire his gun after the guns had ceased. The piece was then dragged off by the two, the horses having been shot, and its capture by the enemy prevented.” For 38 years he was a prominent person in St. Petersburg in many things and looking towards the advancement of the City. As a member of the First Avenue Methodist Church, his pastor, The Rev. S. A. Keen, and his friend Fr. Madeira conducted his final rites.\n\nFr. Charles M. Gray, whose ministry is spoken of in connection with St. Peter’s, is also buried in this cemetery.\n\nMiss Constance Norwood, died at the age of 22 is buried there also. The last three years of her life had been spent in a wheel chair. She had been a brilliant student at St. Petersburg High School and was reportedly very popular at the school and through out the city. She became engaged and was to be married on January 8. After the Christmas excitement she went shopping for her trousseau and caught a cold from which she could not recover. She died January 10, 1920.\n\nThere are many others whose tales are of interest, too many to detail here.\n\nWe hope you have enjoyed this documentation of the history of St. Bartholomew’s Church. It is our sincere wish that future generations will add to this document and record the continuation of this Church. It is also our sincere wish that as you have read these pages that God’s love became obvious to you in the deeds and actions of those depicted in this record or our history."
