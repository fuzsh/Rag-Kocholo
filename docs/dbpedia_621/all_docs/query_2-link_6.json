There are two names above all that I must most particularly record—(i.) that of Colonel Coventry Williams, lately commanding the Greys, who has helped in so many details, though I can only particularly refer readers to pages 291, 292 and 293. Colonel Williams is the half-brother of Captain Williams, a portrait of whom, as he stands by his charger, I have been able to include in this volume, and who, as named by Kinglake (quoted on page 78), brought the Greys out of action at Balaclava. There, too, Kinglake refers to the anonymous officer whose Crimean recollections are given on pages 80 to 84. That officer has since died, and so, too, has Russell, the famous Times correspondent, with whom he was exchanging affectionate greetings. (ii.) In the next place I must record my gratitude to Major Lindsay, who has shown the keen instinct native to the noble house of Crawford. His grandfather opened his famous record with this quotation from \"Schir David Lyndesay of the Mont allias lyoun herauld king of Armes\":—\n\nThe fact is that to hold the King's commission in the Royal Scots Greys inspires a host of chivalrous thoughts and memories. Picture the simple pride shown in the laconic words quoted on page 293, \"Greys, from your right number off ten!\" and see pages 52 to 74. Here are letters from Francis Charlton Kinchant, who received his commission on 18th January, 1815, and was killed at Waterloo. After[Pg x] writing to a friend accounts describing how zealously he was learning to practise the art of war, he goes on: \"The regiment is without doubt the best and the most crack cavalry corps in the service. I don't think there is a private in it under 5 feet 11 inches.\" The next personal allusion, describing the uniform of the corps, is to his own father: \"Our dress altogether is extremely rich and consequently costs lots of money. The Court dress coat alone is 40 guineas. It is covered with lace from head to foot. The jackets are handsome, but they cost £15. 15. each. Every other part of the equipment is equally as expensive. In fact we make a most dashing appearance. I should like much to meet the old Buck at Bath or Clifton. I do not think he would know his hopeful son.\"\n\nIt is interesting to identify the noble Colonel James Gardiner, killed at Preston Pans, as an officer in the Greys. Of course the regiment has always held a peculiarly interesting position. For instance, it does not join the ordinary rota for foreign service. It shares with a very few the privilege of having a special honorary Colonel-in-chief.\n\nBefore writing of Sir Thomas Dalyell, the first colonel of the regiment, I wish to thank most cordially Mrs. Cornwall Dalyell of The Binns, who most kindly allowed photographs to be taken of the manuscripts of (and relics pertaining to) Sir Thomas Dalyell himself.\n\nThomas Dalyell or Dalzell, of Binns, was born about 1599, and seems to have taken part in the Rochelle expedition in 1628, as captain in the Earl of Morton's regiment. In 1640 he was serving under Major Robert Monro at Aberdeen. He accompanied Monro in his expedition to Ireland, 8th April, 1642, having obtained a commission as colonel to command 2,500 men. On 6th May, 1651, he was appointed by the King as General-Major of Foot, and fought at Worcester on 3rd September. He was taken prisoner and committed to the Tower, but escaped to the Continent. In March, 1654, he appeared off the northern coasts of Scotland, and helped in the rebellion in the Highlands in that year. Although a reward and free pardon were offered to anyone who would give him up, dead or alive, he again escaped to the Continent, and received from Charles a special[Pg xi] letter of thanks, dated Cologne, 30th December, 1654. On 19th July, 1666, he was appointed Commander-in-chief in Scotland. Captain Crichton wrote of him: \"He was bred up very hardy from his youth; he never wore a peruke, nor did he shave his beard since the murder of King Charles the First. He died on Sunday evening, 23rd August, 1685.\"\n\nE.

I have, therefore, used contemporary language without any modern editing. The book will contain particulars relating to every officer who has ever held a commission in the Regiment.\n\nBefore describing the origin of this famous Regiment, it will be well to refer briefly to the title Dragoon. It will be noticed that in the early official warrants, Horse, Foot, and Dragoons, are always three distinct forces. The Dragoon was nearly allied to the Mounted Infantryman, who, in modern times, has evoked such great public interest. A captain was usually described as appointed to command, not a troop, but a company.\n\nOn the breaking out of the war with Holland in 1672 a regiment of Dragoons was raised; the pay was at a lower rate than the Horse, and the men were armed as Infantry, except that a limited number carried halberds instead of pikes, and the others muskets and bayonets, and a few in each troop had pistols.\n\nThe warrant, dated 2nd April, 1672, requires that the new force—\n\nBy warrants dated 21st May, 1678, two independent troops of Dragoons were raised, their respective Captains being John Strachan and John Inglis.\n\nThis was the beginning of the Royal Scots Greys.\n\nOn 23rd September, 1678, Viscount Kingstoun was commissioned to be Captain of \"a new company of Dragoons appointed by us to be forthwith levyed.\"\n\nFour days later, Francis Stuart, of Coldingham, was appointed Lieutenant of this new company.\n\nOn July 24th, 1679, Francis Stuart became Captain of this new company in succession to Viscount Kingstoun who resigned.\n\nBy Royal Warrant on the 25th of November, 1681, three troops were ordered to be added to the three already raised, and the whole six formed into a regiment. See page 13.\n\nThe following extract relates to the state of Scotland and proposed increase of forces there. (State Papers—Scotland—Warrant Books, vol. iv., folio 370):—\n\n\"CHARLES R.\n\n\"Right trusty and welbeloued Cousins and Councellors.—Wee greet you well. After full and satisfactory information from the Lords commissionated by you here, of what has been done by you in our Service, Wee doe againe approve of your proceeding, and thank you for your care, assuring you of our favour, assistance, and protection, upon all occasions; and for the more effectual prosecution thereof, wee find it necessary to signify to you, and by you to our people there, that wee are firmly resolved to owne and assert our authority, so as may equally encourage you and discourage all such as by seditious Practices endeavour in aspersing you to lessen our Prerogative: And finding by good information that the Phanaticks there, expecting encouragement from such as oppose you, and taking advantage of the present juncture of affaires here, have of late with great insolence flocked together frequently and openly in ffield conventicles those Rendevouses of Rebellion, and haue dared to oppose our fforces, though wee neither heed nor doe fear such insolent attempts, yet from a just care of our own authority, and a kindnesse to our good subjects there, we haue thought fit to order that some more fforces may be trained; and for that effect wee haue commanded the Lords of our Treasury to take an effectuall course for providing what money wee shall find necessary for raising and maintaining those Troopes at our charge, And wee expect from you an exact and speedy Account of what number and quality of Troopes may be necessary there upon this occasion; to the end wee may direct commissions, and give such other orders as wee shall find requisite.

Then followed still two more, one appointing John Livingston Ensign in Strachan's and the other, Henry Dundas, Ensign under Inglis.\n\nThe following order relates in part to the three Independent Troopes of Dragoones. (War Office Miscellany Orders, vol. v., folio 179):—\n\n[Pg 4]\n\n\"Whereas his Majesty hath thought fitt to order the immediate Raiseing of three Regiments of Horse consisting of eight Troopes each Regiment, and sixty men in each Troope besides Officers: as also three Regiments of Foot consisting of four Companyes each Regiment, and one hundred men in each Company, besides officers; and one Regiment of Dragoons consisting of eight Troopes, and eighty men in each troope, besides officers, and three other Independent Troopes of Dragoons, of the like number; and three Troopes of Horse Granadiers, consisting of eighty men in one of the Troopes, and sixty men in each of the other two Troopes, besides officers.\n\n\"You are to pass and allow the said Regiments, Troopes and Companies, according to the directions following.\n\n\"The first muster of any of the troopes of Horse is to be from the officers first produceing twenty or more good men well mounted to be mustered, and the following musters shall be upon produceing five men with their Horses till the whole Troope be compleated.

The peculiar interest of the words that follow is that they were written wholly as the experiences of one of the first officers of the Greys.\n\nWhereupon Mr. Francis Stuart, grandson to the Earl of Bothwell, a private gentleman in the Horse-Guards, like myself, and my intimate acquaintance, was sent for, in haste, by the General; because the Council of Scotland was then writing to the King that his Majesty would be pleased to grant commissions to those persons whose names were to be sent up to London that very night. Mr. Stuart gave me notice of this: whereupon, although I was not sent for, I resolved to go up with him to Edenborough, and solicit for myself.\n\nThe General: \"Wha' the Deel sent for you up?\" I answered that I hoped his Excellency would now make good his promise of preferring me ... the General stood my firm friend, and although the sons and brothers of Lords and Baronets and other persons of quality solicited to be made Lieutenants and Cornets, in these new raised Troops, yet the General in regard to my services, prevailed with the Council that I might be appointed Lieutenant to Mr. Stuart, who was then made Captain of Dragoons.\n\nSoon after this, the Archbishop of St. Andrews was murdered by the Laird of Hackston and Balfour, assisted by four poor weavers.\n\n[Pg 7]\n\nThe Council finding the Rebels daily increasing in their numbers ... his Majesty sent down the Duke of Monmouth ... to be Commander-in-chief.... General Dalziel refused to serve under him, and remained at his lodgings in Edenborough, till his Grace was superseded, which happened about a fortnight after.... The General Officers ... desired his Grace to let them know which way he designed to take to come at the Enemy, the Duke answered, it must be by Bothwell Bridge. Now the bridge lay a short mile to the right of the King's Army, was narrow, and guarded with 3,000 of the Rebels, and strongly barricaded with great stones; but although the Officers were desirous to have passed the river, by easy fords, directly between them and the Rebels and to march to their main body on the moor, before those 3,000, who guarded the bridge, could come to assist them; yet the Duke was obstinate, and would pass no other way than that of the bridge. Pursuant to this preposterous and absurd resolution, he commanded Captain Stuart (whose Lieutenant I was) with his troop of Dragoons, and 80 Musqueteers, together with four small Field-pieces, under cover of the Dragoons, to beat off the party at the bridge. The Duke himself, with David Lesly and Melvill, accompanyed us, and ordered the Field-pieces to be left at the Village of Bothwell, within a musquet-shot of the bridge. When the Duke and his men came near the bridge, the Rebels beat a parly, and sent over a Laird, accompanied with a Kirk Preacher.... While this Parly lasted, the Field-pieces were brought down and planted over against the bridge, without being perceived by the Rebels. The messengers ... they would not lay down their arms unless their conditions were granted them; whereupon the Dragoons and Musqueteers fired all at once upon those who guarded the bridge, and the Field-pieces played so warmly, that some hundreds of the Rebels were slain; the rest flying to the main body on the moor. The Duke, as soon as he had commanded to fire, retired into a hollow from the enemies' shot; ... and continued there till the action was over. Then Captain Stuart ordered the Musqueteers to make way for the Horse, to pass the bridge, by casting into the river the stones which had been placed there to obstruct the passage over it; but the army could not pass in less than five hours; and then marched up in order of battle towards the enemy, who waited for them on the moor, confiding in the superiority of their numbers. Clavers commanded the Horse on the right, and Captain Stuart the Dragoons on the left. The Field-pieces were carried in the centre of the Footguards, while the rest of the Officers commanded at the head of their men; and the Duke, after the enemy was beaten from the bridge, rode[Pg 8] at the head of the Army. Upon the first fire, the Rebel Horse turned about.... Sir John Bell, Provost of Glasgow as soon as he saw the Rebels fly, rode into the town; from whence, in a few hours, he sent all the bread he could find, together with an hogshead of drink to each troop and company in the Army, out of the cellars of such townsmen as were found to be abettors or protectors of the Rebels.\n\nThe Pursuers were no sooner returned, and the whole action over, than General Dalziel arrived at the camp from Edenborough, with a commission renewed to be Commander-in-Chief, which he received that very morning by an Express....\n\n[Pg 9]\n\nOn Saturday morning when the army was to march to Glasgow, I desired the General's leave to go with twelve Dragoons in search of some of the Rebels, who might probably pass the Clyde, about Dunlatton, to shelter themselves in the Highlands. With these Dragoons, clad in grey coats and bonnets, I made haste down the side of the river; and about midnight, after travelling twenty-four miles, I came to a church, and while the soldiers stayed to refresh their horses in the churchyard, I spyed a country fellow going by, and asked him in his own dialect, \"Whither gang ye this time of night?\" He answered, \"Wha are ye that speers?\" I replied, \"We are your ane Foke.\" Upon this the fellow came up and told me; there were 18 friends with horses at an old Castle waiting for a boat to pass over into the Isle of Arran. I mounted the man behind one of my Dragoons, and went towards the place; but the Rebels not finding a boat were gone off, and the guide dismissed. There was a great dew on the grass, which directed me and my party to follow the track of their horses for three or four miles, till the dew was gone off; I then enquired of a cowherd on a hill whether he saw any of our poor Foke travelling that way; he answered that they had separated on that hill and gone three several ways, six in a party, adding, that in one party there was a bra muckle kerl, with a white hat on him, and a great bob of ribbons on the cock o't. Whereupon I sent 4 of my Dragoons after one party, 4 more after another, and myself with the remaining 4 went in pursuit of him with the white hat.... The good man of the house returning from putting the horses to grass in the garden was going to shut the door, whereupon myself and one of the Dragoons commanded him, with our pistols at his breast, to lead us to the room where the man lay who wore a white hat. We entered the room, and before he awaked I took away his arms, and commanded him to dress immediately; then finding his companion asleep in the barn, I forced him likewise to arise, and mounting them both on their own horses, came at 9 o'clock in the morning with my two prisoners to the other Dragoons at the place where we appointed to meet. From thence we rode strait to Glasgow, and arrived thither about 8 in the evening, after a journey of 50 miles since we left the Army at Bothwell the day before. The man with a white hat had turned out to be Master John King.... About a month after I happened to dream that I found one Wilson, a Captain among the Rebels at Bothwell Bridge, in a bank of Wood upon the river Clyde. This accident made so strong an impression upon my mind that as soon as I awaked I took six-and-thirty Dragoons, and got to the place by break of day. Then I caused some of them to alight and go into the wood and set him up, as hounds do a hare, while the rest were ordered to stand sentry to prevent his escape. It seems I dreamt fortunately, for Wilson was actually in the wood with 5 more of his company, as we afterwards learned, who all seeing me and my party advancing, hid themselves in a little island on the river among the broom that grew upon it. Wilson had not the good fortune to escape.... I seized and brought him to my quarters, and from thence immediately conveyed him to Edenborough, where he was hanged; but might have preserved his life if he would have condescended only to say, God save the King. This he utterly refused to do, and thereby lost not only his life, but likewise an estate worth twenty-nine thousand marks Scots. For this service, the Duke of Queensberry, then High Commissioner of Scotland, recommended me to the King, who rewarded me with the gift of Wilson's estate; but although the grant passed the Seals, and the Sheriff put me in possession, yet I could neither sell it nor let it, nobody daring, for fear of the Rebels who had escaped at Bothwell Bridge, either to purchase or farm it, by which means I never got a penny by the grant; and at the Revolution the land was taken from me, and restored to Wilson's heirs....\n\n\"The winter following, General Dalziel, with a battalion of the Earl of Linlithgow's Guards, the Earl of Airly's troop of Horse, and[Pg 10] Captain Stuart's troop of Dragoons, quartered at Kilmarnock in the west, 50 miles from Edenborough. Here the general one day, happening to look on while I was exercising the troop of Dragoons, asked me, when I had done, whether I knew any of my men who was skilful in praying well in the style and tone of the Covenanters; I immediately thought upon one James Gibb, who had been born in Ireland, and whom I made a Dragoon. This man I brought to the General, assuring his Excellency that if I had raked Hell, I could not find his match for his skill in mimicking the Covenanters. Whereupon the General gave him £5 to buy him a gray coat and a bonnet, and commanded him to find out the Rebels, but to be sure to take care of himself among them. The Dragoon went 8 miles off that very night, and got admittance into the house of a notorious Rebel, pretending he came from Ireland out of zeal for the cause, to assist at the fight of Bothwell Bridge, and could not find an opportunity since of returning to Ireland with safety, he said he durst not be seen in the day-time, and therefore after bewitching the family with his gifts of praying, he was conveyed in the dusk of the next evening, with a guide, to the house of the next adjoining Rebel; and thus in the same manner, from one to another, till in a month's time he got through the principal of them in the west, telling the General at his return, that wherever he came he made the old wives in their devout fits tear off their biggonets and mutches; he likewise gave the General a list of their names and places of their abodes; and into the bargain, brought back a good purse of money in his pocket. The General desired to know how he had prayed amongst them; he answered that it was his custom in his prayers to send the King, the Ministers of State, the Officers of the Army, with all their soldiers, and the Episcopall Clergy, all broadsides to Hell, but particularly the General himself: \"What,\" said the General, \"did you send me to Hell, Sir?\" \"Yea,\" replied the Dragoon, \"you at the head of them, as their leader....\n\n\"During the winter and the following spring I secured many of those whose names and abodes the canting Dragoon had given a list of.... In July following, the General, by order of Council, commanded me to go with a detachment of 30 Horse and 50 Dragoons in pursuit of about 150 rebels who had escaped at Bothwell[Pg 11] Bridge, and ever since kept together in a body up and down in Galloway. I followed them for 5 or 6 days from one place to another; after which, on 22nd of July, they stayed for me at Airs Moss.... The Moss is 4 miles long from east to west and 2 broad. The Rebels drew up at the east end, and consisted of 30 Horse and 120 Foot. I faced them upon a rising ground with my 30 Horse and 50 Dragoons. The reason why the Rebels chose this place to fight on rather than a plain field was for fear their Horse might desert the Foot, as they did on Hamilton Moor, near Bothwell Bridge: and likewise, that in case they lost the day they might save themselves by retreating into the Moss. I placed myself on the left, as judging that the best officer the Rebels had would command on the right. The action began about 5 in the afternoon, but lasted not long; for I ordered my men first to receive the enemy's fire, then to ride down the hill upon them and use their broad-swords. They did so, and before the enemy had time to draw theirs, cut many of them down in an instant. Whereupon they wheeled about, and Captain Fowler, who commanded the Rebels on the right, being then in the rear, advancing up to me, I gave him such a blow over the head with my broad-sword as would have cleaved his scul had it not been defended by a steel cap. Fowler turning about, aimed a blow at me, but I warded it off, and with a back stroke cut the upper part of his head clean off from the nose upwards. By this time the Rebells, leaving their horses, fled to the Moss; but the Royalists pursuing them killed about 60 and took 14 prisoners. Here Cameron, the famous Covenanter, lost his life, and Haxton was taken prisoner, infamous for embruing his hands in the blood of the Archbishop of St. Andrews ... for which paricide both his hands were afterwards cut off, and he was hanged at Edenborough. But this victory cost me very dear, for being then in the rear I rode into the Moss after the Rebels where I overtook a dozen of them hacking and hewing one of my men whose horse was bogged; his name was Elliot, a stout soldier and one of Claver's troop. He had received several wounds, and was at the point of being killed when I came to his relief. I shot one of the rogues dead with my carbine, which obliged the rest to let the poor man and his horse creep out of the hole, but at the same time drew all their fury upon myself; for Elliot made a shift[Pg 12] to crawl out of the Moss leading his horse in his hands, but was wholly disabled from assisting his deliverer, and was not regarded by his enemies who probably thought he was mortally wounded, or, indeed, rather that they had no time to mind him; for I laid about me so fast that they judged it best to keep off and not to venture within my reach, till it unfortunately happened that my horse slipped into the same hole out of which Elliot and his horse had just got. When they had me at this advantage they began to show their courage and manfully dealt their blows with their broad-swords, from some of which the carbine that hung down my back defended me a little. As I was paddling in the hole, the horse not able to get out, one of the rebels ran me through the small of the back with his broad-sword, and at the same instant two more wounded me under the ribs with their small ones. Then I threw myself over the head of my horse, taking the far pistol out of the holster in my left hand, and holding my broad-sword in my right; and as one of the villains was coming hastily up to me his foot slipped, and before he could recover himself I struck my sword into his skull; but the fellow, being big and heavy, snapped it asunder as he fell within a span of the hilt. The Rebels had me now at a great advantage. One of them made a stroak at me which I guarded off with the hilt of the sword that was left in my hand, but the force with which he struck the blow—and I kept it off—brought us both to the ground. However I got up before him, clapped my pistol to his side and shot him dead. As soon as this was done another came behind me, and with some weapon or other struck me such a blow on the head as laid me flat on my back, in which posture I remained a good while insensible, the rogues taking it for granted that I was dead, scoured off.\n\n\"A little recovering my senses, I strove to lift up my head, which one of the rogues happening to see at some distance, immediately returned, and said in my hearing: 'God, the dog is no deed yet.' Then coming up to me, took his sword, and putting its hilt to his breast and guiding it with both his hands, made a thrust at my belly; but my senses were now so far recovered that I parried the thrust with the piece of the sword which remained still in my hand. The fellow, when he missed his aim, almost fell on his face, for the sword ran up to the hilt in the moss; and as he was recovering himself I gave him[Pg 13] a dab in the mouth with my broken sword which very much hurt him, but he aiming a second thrust, which I had likewise the good fortune to put by, and having as before given him another dab in the mouth, he immediately went off for fear of the pursuers, whereof many were now returning. In this distress I made a shift, with much difficulty and pain, to get upon my feet, but my right leg being disabled by the wound I received from the broad-sword, I was forced to limp by the help of the carbine, which I made use of as a staff. I had lost my horse, for one of the rogues, when I had quitted him in the hole, led him away through the Moss. I recovered him about a year after from the man to whom the rebel had sold him.\"\n\nThis next letter, from the King, taken from the Record Office, refers to the three Independent Troops of Dragoons, and orders three more Troops to be levied, and the whole six to be then regimented, thus establishing the Royal Scots Greys:—\n\n[Folio 515.]\n\n\"CHARLES R.\n\n\"Establishment for the Pay of his Majesty's present standing Forces in his ancient kingdome of Scotland, according to twenty eight dayes in each month, and for twelve months in the year.\"\n\nThen are described the following; but I only give in full the Regiment with whose history we are dealing:—\n\n\"His Majesty Troope of Guard.\n\n\"His Majesty's Regiment of ffoote Guard commanded by the Earle of Linlithgow.\n\n\"The Regiment of ffoote commanded by the Earle of Marr.\n\n\"The Troope of Horse commanded by the Earle of Airlie, and 2 more troopes, one commanded by the Master of Rosse, and the other by John Graham of Claverhouse.\"\n\n\"The Pay of one Regiment of Dragoones consisting of Colonell, Lieutenant Colonell, and Major, and six Companies, and for each Company consisting of 50 souldiers, is as followeth, vizt.:\n\nAfter this come particulars of the gunners garrisoning Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle, etc!\n\nAnd lastly, the Militia, at an annual cost of £400 and occupying only half a page in the book!\n\nThe foregoing establishment is dated 25 November, 1681, and the following memorandum appears in the margin:—\n\nThis next extract is Charles the Second's commission to Lord Charles Murray as first Lieutenant-Colonel:—\n\nThis next is the King's commission to Thomas Dalyell as Colonel of the Regiment; it recites particulars of the founding of the Regiment:—\n\n[Pg 17]\n\nJohn Creichton, of the Massacre of Glencoe, writes:—\n\n\"McDonnal, Laird of Cappagh, in the Highlands, ... was unjustly possessed, as most men believed, for many years, of an estate, which in right belonged to the Laird of Mackintosh.... Soon after, the Government ordered me to detach 60 Dragoons, with a Lieutenant, Cornet, and Standard, and to march with Captain Streighton, and 200 of the Foot Guards against the McDonnels.... Whereupon we, who were sent against him, continued to destroy all the houses and corn, from the time of Lammas to the 10th of September; and then we advanced towards the Borders, to join the Scotch army, at that time marching towards England, against the Prince of Orange, then intending an invasion.\"\n\n[Creichton now goes on with his account of the coming of William the Third, which is, of course, a mistake in order.]\n\nThe following entries are from two large folio manuscript Establishment Books in my possession. Each volume is bound in boards covered with fine white vellum, with gold tooling in Mearne's style.\n\nThe first opens with the Accession of James the Second; but the first entry that concerns us is on page 63:—\n\n\"Our Will and Pleasure is that this Establishment for our Scots Forces hereafter mentioned, do commence from the First day of November, in the 4th year of our Reigne, and continue during their stay in England.\"\n\n*****\n\n[Pg 19]\n\nThe next entry is under the 1st of May, 1689, in William the Third's Establishment for England. On page 78 is recorded Sir Thomas Levingston's Regiment of Dragoons.\n\nThe numbers and pay appear as before, except for these additions:—\n\nAlso for each Troop are added:—\n\nTwo Hoboys each 12d., and 2s. for horses, £73; and 60 privates in each troop.\n\nThe second volume begins with April, 1692, and on page 11 the Dragoons are recorded with the same numbers and pay, as before.\n\nThe Establishment for Land Forces and Garrisons, 1694, opens on page 75 with an interesting list of Regiments and their commanding Officers:—Under Dragoons one entry is \"Lord Tiviot's.\"\n\n[Pg 20]\n\nAfter the 1694 Establishment comes that for the 26th March, 1699. On page 133, Dragoons are recorded. There is no mention of a gunsmith. There is one \"Hoboy\" 2s. per diem.\n\nThen on page 161 we reach the Establishment of Guards and Garrisons, 25th April, 1700.\n\nThe Dragoon Regiments, as detailed on page 168, had only 40 private soldiers to each troop.\n\nThe 1st of June (1702) Establishment gives the Dragoons 54 private soldiers to a company.\n\nThe following relates to the title of the Regiment:—\n\nOn 31st May, 1694, the Regiment landed at Williamstadt, in North Brabant, and on June 16th was reviewed by King William before occupying cantonments near Arschot. No general engagement took place this year: but the Regiment was twice engaged in skirmishes with the French cavalry, and in October marched into cantonments in the villages near Ghent. Coming out of winter quarters in April, 1695, the Regiment proceeded to Dixmude, in West Flanders, and thence to join the Army encamped at Arseele, and on 31st May were reviewed by King William with the rest of the Army. During the progress of the siege of Namur the Regiment formed part of the Army under the Prince of Vaudemont which manœuvred so as to protect the troops employed before the town. The Regiment was encamped a short time between Genappe and Waterloo; it afterwards occupied, together with the Regiment of Foot of Holstein-Ploen, an important post at Masy, and after the surrender of the citadel of Namur marched into winter quarters in West Flanders.\n\n[Pg 21]\n\nIn May, 1696, they encamped near Bruges and for some months were stationed behind the canal between Ghent and Bruges, their duty being to observe the motions of the French Army commanded by Marshal Villeroy, which was encamped on the opposite side of the canal. In October they marched into winter quarters in the villages behind Bruges. In the spring of 1697 negotiations were opened for a general peace. They were encamped for a short time between Brussels and Aeth, afterwards between Vilvorde and Burntbridge, on the Brussels canal; and when the peace of Ryswick was concluded they marched to Bruges. Before the end of December the Regiment embarked for England and landing at Harwich early in January, 1698, marched at once to Scotland. The establishment which, during the war, had been 8 troops and 590 officers and men was ordered to be reduced to 6 troops and 294 officers and men.\n\nIn 1701 the accession of the Duke of Anjou to the throne of Spain caused war to be declared again on May 15th. The two troops were again added, and early in 1702 the Regiment embarked for Holland.\n\nThe Regiment formed part of the guard for the English artillery train at Breda, with which it joined the allied army under John Churchill, Earl of Marlborough.\n\nIn the autumn of 1702 the Greys were engaged in covering the sieges of Venloo, Ruremonde and Stevenswaert. The following is taken from those most interesting records, Marlborough's own correspondence and despatches:—\n\nThe Regiment was also present at the taking of Liege, on October 23rd. Before going into winter quarters one squadron acted as a body-guard to Marlborough in visiting Venloo and Ruremonde. The Regiment wintered in Dutch Brabant. Before the end of April, 1703, the Regiment took the field again and encamped near Hamont, in the province of Limburg, from whence they marched to Lardner Heath, afterwards to Château D'Horn, near Ruremonde, and on May 7th they reached near to Tongres. In the meanwhile a party of English cavalry, escorting a quantity of specie for the Army, was attacked and defeated by a detachment of French troops, who captured the treasure. The Greys were instantly ordered out, and dashing across the country intercepted and defeated the French troops and returned with the specie in triumph back to camp.\n\nNext the Regiment was sent towards Bonn, then being besieged. After the taking of Bonn it joined the main army near Maestricht on May 21st.\n\nThe Regiment was engaged in the siege of Limburg, which fell on September 28th.\n\nWhen the famous campaign of 1704 opened Lord John Hay, son of the Marquis of Tweeddale, became, by purchase, Colonel in succession to Viscount Teviot.\n\nDuring the operations under Marlborough on the Dutch frontiers a body of French troops passed the Black Forest and, joining the Bavarians, gained several advantages over the Austrians, endangering the Imperial throne.\n\nIn April, 1704, the Greys, joined by a remount from Scotland, marched to Bedburgh on the Lower Rhine, where they were reviewed by Marlborough, and on May 19th began its march on that important expedition. To keep the enemy in suspense, the troops proceeded towards the Moselle, but on the 25th May changed their[Pg 23] route, and marched to Coblentz. Having crossed the Rhine and the Moselle, Marlborough pushed forward in advance with the cavalry for the Danube, ordering the infantry to follow. Continuing their march through the States of Germany, the regiments crossed the Necker in the early part of June, while the rapidity of their movements and the secrecy of their design filled all Europe with wonder and anxiety, and the enemy appeared confused and lost in doubt and conjecture.\n\nThe British Regiments joined the forces of the Emperor, commanded by the Margrave of Baden, when the new line of battle was formed and the brigade, consisting of the Royal Scots and Royal Irish Dragoons, was posted on the left of the first line. Marlborough wishing to possess Donawerth as a place of arms, decided to attack a division commanded by the Count D'Arco, posted on the lofty heights of Schellenberg, on the north of the Danube commanding the passage of that river at Donawerth, and the Greys formed part of the force chosen for this service. After marching, on July 2nd, through a country intersected with rivulets and other obstacles the troops came near to Schellenberg. At 6 in the evening the attack was ordered, and the British infantry going forward with firm and resolute step assaulted the entrenchments, while the Greys and other cavalry moved forward in support. In a few moments a storm of bullets assailed the ranks of the Bavarians, and the thunder of the British fire echoed in the valley below. The post was valiantly defended, and a fierce fight had gone on for some time when the Greys were ordered to dismount, form as infantry, and assault the trenches. The regiment instantly obeyed, and led by its gallant Colonel, Lord John Hay, advanced boldly to the attack and mixed fiercely in the conflict. At this instant the enemy gave way on all sides, and the cavalry rushing forward sabred many as they fled towards the Danube; whilst the Count D'Arco, and other officers escaped by crossing the river.\n\nThe post won and the enemy's baggage, artillery, and many standards captured, the Royal Scots Dragoons remounted. The Regiment lost in the action Captain Douglas and 7 men killed, two officers, and 17 men wounded. Donawerth was occupied on the following day.\n\nThe next great event to refer to is the Battle of Blenheim, in the[Pg 24] valley of the Danube, fought on August 13th. The following words are Sir Edward Creasy's:—\"Like Hannibal, Marlborough relied principally on his cavalry for achieving his decisive successes, and it was by his cavalry that Blenheim, the greatest of his victories, was won. The battle had lasted till five in the afternoon. Marlborough had now 8,000 horsemen drawn up in two lines, and in the most perfect order for a general attack on the enemy's line along the space between Blenheim and Oberglau. The infantry was drawn up in battalions in their rear, so as to support them if repulsed and to keep in check the large masses of the French that still occupied the village of Blenheim.\n\n\"Tallard now interlaced his squadrons of cavalry with battalions of infantry, and Marlborough, by a corresponding movement, brought several regiments of infantry and some pieces of artillery to his front line at intervals between the bodies of horse. A little after 5 Marlborough commenced the decisive movement, and the allied cavalry, strengthened and supported by foot and guns, advanced slowly from the lower ground near the Nebel up the slope to where the French cavalry, 10,000 strong, awaited them. On riding over the summit of the acclivity the allies were received with so hot a fire from the French artillery and small arms that at first the cavalry recoiled, but without abandoning the high ground. The guns and the infantry, which they had brought with them, maintained the contest with spirit and effect. The French fire seemed to slacken; Marlborough instantly ordered a charge along the line. The allied cavalry galloped forward at the enemy's squadrons, and the hearts of the French horsemen failed them. Discharging their carbines at an idle distance they wheeled round and spurred from the field, leaving the nine infantry battalions of their comrades to be ridden down by the torrent of the allied cavalry.\"\n\nThe Greys lost several men and horses wounded but none killed.\n\nExtracts from a journal of the 1704 campaign kept by Mr. Hare, chaplain to the Duke, and afterwards Bishop of Chichester:—\n\n[Pg 28]\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nThe campaign of 1704 closed with the Siege of Landau, the Greys forming part of the army covering the siege. In September, when the King of the Romans visited the British camp, the Duke of Marlborough placed himself at the head of the \"Royal Scots Dragoons\" to receive his Majesty.\n\nThe interesting incident is thus entered by Hare in his Journal:\n\n\"On 2nd of October the King of the Romans came from before Landau, to take a view of the Army commanded by his Grace at Weissembourg. His Grace sent Colonel Cadogan to conduct His Majesty to the left of the Army which was drawn out in two lines for this purpose. His Grace there received and saluted His Majesty at the head of Lord John Hayes' regiment of Dragoons, and afterwards accompanied His Majesty along the lines, which appeared extremely fine and gave great satisfaction to his Majesty.\"\n\nIn November they marched back to Holland for the winter, and in Guelderland were joined by another remount from Scotland.\n\nThey were withdrawn from their cantonments early in May of 1705, and after traversing Limburg, encamped near the banks of the river Maese, where the Duke of Marlborough assembled the army for the purpose of proceeding up the Moselle. After a halt of two days, the cavalry crossed the Maese, and marched to Coblenz, and thence to Juliers. After leaving this, they crossed a barren country to Triersweiler, where the troops encamped on May 26th. Thence the Moselle and the Saar were crossed, and plans made for offensive warfare. This was all frustrated by Austrian delays and German commanders' jealousies. The Duke of Marlborough resolved therefore to return.\n\nAt midnight on June 17th the troops decamped in the midst of a heavy rain, and the Royal Scots Dragoons, with several other regiments, formed up to cover the retreat through a long and narrow defile. No enemy, however, appeared to interrupt the army, and retracing their former steps by forced marches, the Greys reached the vicinity of Maestricht on June 30th; when the French forces in the Netherlands instantly ceased acting on the offensive, and took refuge behind their lines.\n\n[Pg 29]\n\nAfter several changes of position, the Greys and other corps were ordered to be ready to march immediately after dark on the evening of July 17th; and the regiment was formed on this occasion as usual in brigade with the Royal Irish Dragoons under the command of Brigadier-General Lord John Hay. The French lines to be taken were very formidable, for besides the height of the rampart, and the largeness of the ditch, they were further defended by the difficulties of the ground over which they were to be approached; and by the river Geet, which could not be crossed without laying bridges over it, and which was near enough to the lines to be defended by the fire from the parapet. Our troops continued their march throughout the night, which was extremely dark, and at four in the morning surprised the French guards and took the position. Scarcely had the Greys and Irish Dragoons, with a few squadrons of horse, passed the lines, when the Marquis d'Allegre appeared with twenty battalions of infantry and fifty squadrons of cavalry. The Duke of Marlborough led his horse and dragoons forward, and by an impetuous charge, broke the enemy's ranks. A short but fiery conflict followed with varied success, and the Greys displayed their usual spirit. Finally the enemy's squadrons were dispersed, their standards and kettledrums were captured, and many officers and men were taken prisoners. The enemy's infantry also suffered severely; a few battalions however retired in a square in admirable order.\n\nThe campaign closed, and the Scots Greys marched to Dutch Brabant, where they spent the winter.\n\nFrom the archives of the Regiment:—\n\nThen come three pages of the adventures of the Greys in the campaign in which the said Andrew took his part. He was afterwards the famous Sir Andrew who fought in the Rebellion of 1745, and specially noted for his defence of Blair Castle at that time.\n\n\"Lord Mahon's History of England, Vol. I., chapter 5, page 155, edition Murray, 1853.\n\n\"1715.\n\n\"Meanwhile the Duke of Argyle had arrived in Scotland about the middle of September, and hastened to the camp at Stirling. He had brought with him not a single battalion of troops, not one piece of artillery. He had found under his command no more than 1,000 foot, and a body of Dragoons, partly from that excellent regiment the Scots Greys, but altogether of only 500 men.\"\n\nSir Walter Scott, in his note on Sinclair's MS., page 304, wrote:—\n\n\"The Dragoons called the Scots Greys, for many years maintained a character greatly superior to that of an ordinary regiment. They never gave a bounty exceeding a crown, and were recruited from a class of persons greatly superior to those who usually enter the army, such as the sons of decent farmers and tradesmen, who felt a vocation for the army. No ignominious punishment was ever inflicted, and a criminal who had merited such was previously transferred to another regiment.\"\n\n[Pg 31]\n\nEarly in May, 1706, they left their winter quarters, and after crossing the plains of Limburg and the rich valleys of Liege, they on May 20th joined the army encamped at Bilsen, and afterwards marched to Borchloen. On May 23rd a detachment of the Greys, and several squadrons of horse, were ordered to march towards Mont St. André, and were soon after followed by the army in eight columns. There was a thick fog, but the cavalry pushed on until they gained the heights near Mierdorp, when through the misty dawn they espied a few of the enemy's cavalry crossing the plains of St. André, and soon the fog lifting, the French army was discovered in position at Ramillies. Advancing into the plains of Tandrinœuil, the Allies prepared for action, the Queen's Horse, the Greys, and the Royal Irish Dragoons, with Churchill's and Mordaunt's regiments of infantry, being posted on the heights of Foulz on the right of the line. About 1·30 in the afternoon the Allies began heavy artillery fire, which was quickly answered by the enemy, and the action became general. For some time the troops on the heights on the right were only spectators, but Marlborough, seeing that an attack made by the Dutch and Danish cavalry on the French Household regiments, Gens D'Armes, Gardes du Corps, and others, was not succeeding, ordered his right wing to advance. Churchill's and Mordaunt's regiments descended first, and meeting three battalions of French infantry, drove them into a morass, where most of them were killed or captured. At the same time the Queen's Horse, the Greys, and the Irish Dragoons galloped through the morass, crossed the high ground beyond it, and attacking the enemy's left, routed the French cavalry, and cut several battalions of infantry to pieces. The Greys charged into the village of Autreglize, overthrew and sabred the infantry in the streets. Coming out of the village, they encountered the famous French regiment du Roi, which at once surrendered and delivered up its colours and arms to the victorious Dragoons.\n\nThe contemporary account in the \"London Gazette\" was as follows:\n\n\"The horse of their left wing seemed to make a stand to gain time for their foot to retire, but were charged so quickly and with so much bravery by the English, that they entirely abandoned the foot, and our Dragoons pushing into the village of Autreglize, made a terrible slaughter. The French King's Own regiment of foot called the regiment du Roi, begged for quarter, and delivered up their arms and colours to Lord John Hay's Dragoons (the Greys).\"\n\nIn connection with the battle of Ramillies, some account must be given of a woman, Christian Davies, or Mother Ross, who served as a trooper in the Greys until, fighting at Ramillies, her skull was fractured, and her sex afterwards discovered.\n\nIn 1740 appeared a book of nearly 200 pages, purporting to record her life and adventures; also in 1893 she was included in a[Pg 32] volume called \"Women Adventurers,\" published by T. Fisher Unwin. The account of her given in the D. N. B. seems excellent. Presumably she was brave, but she seems to have been a very coarse woman. Born in Dublin in 1667, she married Richard Welsh. He, without her knowledge, was in some way forced to enlist in a foot regiment, and wrote letters to his wife which never reached her. At last she heard of his being in the army, and so disguised herself as a soldier to go in search of him.\n\nShe enlisted in Captain Tichborne's company of foot as Christopher Welch. In a skirmish before the battle of Landen she was wounded, and in the next year—1694—taken prisoner by the French, but exchanged.\n\nAt her own wish she was now allowed to join the Greys, and continued so until after the peace of Ryswick. On the renewal of war in 1701 she went back to Holland and re-enlisted in the Greys. She fought at Niuwegen, Venloo, Bonn, and in most of the engagements of the campaign, till at the battle of Donauwerth she received a ball in the hip, which caused a temporary retirement into hospital. The ball was never extracted, but Christian was again under arms in time to share in the spoil after Blenheim. While forming one of a guard to some prisoners taken in that battle, she again saw her husband after a separation of thirteen years. She lost no time in revealing her identity to him; but so enamoured was she of camp life that she extracted a promise from Welsh that he would pass himself off as her brother. After Ramillies she, of course, had to cease to be a trooper, but she still continued to live in camp, and accompanied her husband as his acknowledged wife. In 1709 Richard Welsh was killed at Malplaquet. Christian herself found his body, and her lamentations were so extravagant as to excite the open commiseration of a Captain Ross, whence it is said she gained the sobriquet of Mother Ross, by which she was known for the rest of her days. Although grieving so that for a whole week she refused to touch food, she married Hugh Jones, a grenadier, within three months. In 1710 Jones was killed at the siege of Saint-Venant. In 1712 she returned to England, was presented to Queen Anne, and awarded a life pension of a shilling a day. She afterwards went to Dublin and married a soldier named Davies. She died on July 7th,[Pg 33] 1739, and, at her own request, her body was interred among the pensioners in Chelsea burying ground, and three grand volleys were fired over her grave.\n\nAfter this great victory at Ramillies, on Whit Sunday, May 23rd, 1705, the Greys were occupied in covering the successful sieges of several fortified towns in Flanders, and in the autumn the British troops went into quarters in Flanders, excepting the Royal Scots Greys and Irish Dragoons, who proceeded to Holland.\n\nEarly in the spring of 1707 the Greys went to Spanish Brabant, and encamped near the banks of the little river Sienne. In this year the Acts of Parliament were passed for the Union of the crowns of England and Scotland, and from that time the Greys were designated \"The Royal Regiment of North British Dragoons.\"\n\nThe army was assembled at Brussels, and afterwards encamped near Weldert. The year passed off very quietly; but Richard Cannon found some record of a sharp fight between twenty-five troopers of the Greys sent out to cut forage and thirty French musketeers, the result alleged being fourteen Frenchmen killed and the rest taken.\n\nOn July 11th, 1708, the Greys were engaged in the important battle of Oudenarde, and this battle, with the story of the events preceding it, is full of interest, but would be out of place in this record of one particular regiment.\n\nAfter this the Regiment formed part of the covering army, and was employed in escorting provisions and ammunition to the troops laying siege to Lisle, the capital of French Flanders. After Lisle had fallen to the Allies, the Greys were sent into winter quarters in Flanders. The winter proved extremely severe, and a considerable number of men and horses are said to have been frozen to death.\n\nIn 1709 the Greys formed part of the troops covering the siege and fall of Tournay; but the event of the year was the battle of Malplaquet, fought on September 11th, 1709. The Greys were brigaded with the Royal Irish Dragoons, under Brigadier-General Sybourg. They were posted near the centre of the Allied Army to sustain the attacks of the infantry and protect the artillery, and for some time were only spectators of the fierce storm of battle which[Pg 34] raged on all sides; at length, however, they were ordered to file through a wood in their front, and charge. Scarcely had the brigade emerged from among the trees before it encountered a line of French cavalry; these squadrons were, however, soon dispersed, but they were instantly succeeded by a new line of champions, consisting of a number of squadrons of the French household cavalry, clad in armour, and advancing in firm array. Richard Cannon has described how the Greys and Irish Dragoons met these foaming squadrons with signal bravery, but were driven from their ground by superior numbers. The two regiments soon rallied, and being joined by several corps of horse, returned to the charge; yet such was the resolution displayed by the French troopers that it was not until the third charge that they were driven from the field. The two victorious regiments were specially thanked by the Duke of Marlborough. The Greys lost about thirty killed and wounded.\n\nThe regiment was afterwards employed in covering the siege of Mons, the capital of Hainault, and after the surrender of Mons marched into winter quarters at the little town of Tiel.\n\nMalplaquet was a desperately hard-fought battle. Not for the first or last time in our history, an important battle was nearly lost through the imbecile action of the authorities at home in failing to support an able general abroad.\n\nIn Coxe's \"Marlborough,\" large paper edition, Vol. III., page 90, we find the following:—\n\n\"In considering the consequences of this eventful day, we cannot but applaud the foresight of Marlborough, who before the opening of the campaign had so earnestly pressed for a powerful augmentation of troops. He was conscious that the French were prepared to make their final effort in the Netherlands, and that he should have to contend with a far greater force than he had yet encountered. The battle proved that his calculations were well founded, and that an additional number of 10,000 men on that eventful day would have more contributed to the advancement of peace, than all the efforts of the ablest negotiators in Europe. The Allies, indeed, remained masters of the field; but the laurels of their two great commanders were deeply tinged with blood, and the result of the campaign was far from being commensurate with the sacrifice of so many valuable lives.\"\n\nOf the springing valour displayed by the enemy on the day of[Pg 35] Malplaquet there can be no question, and a distinguished French officer wrote to a correspondent at the time:—\n\n\"The Eugenes and Marlboroughs ought to be well satisfied with us during that day; since till then they had not met with resistance worthy of them. They may say, with justice, that nothing can stand before them; and, indeed, what shall be able to stem the rapid course of these two heroes, if an army of 100,000 of the best troops, posted between two woods trebly entrenched, and performing their duty as well as any brave men could do, were not able to stop them for one day? Will you not then own with me, that they surpass all the heroes of former ages?\"\n\nEarly in 1710 the regiment was joined by a remount of 100 men and horses from Scotland, and marching from its cantonments, encamped on high ground near Tournay. In the afternoon of April 20th it was again on the march, and formed part of the First Division of the Allied Army which forced the enemy's fortified lines at Pont-à-Vendin on the 21st, and encamped at night on the plain of Lens; and afterwards helping in covering the siege of Douay, a strong town on the river Scarpe, and finally was stationed at Pont-à-Nache. While here, the Duke of Marlborough, by special commission from Queen Anne, invested its Colonel—the Earl of Stair—with the Order of the Thistle.\n\nOn May 10th the enemy made a sudden sally from Fort Scarpe to take the bread waggons going to the Allies; but reaching Pont-à-Nache, their career was suddenly stopped by a squadron of the Greys, and two squadrons of the Royal Irish Dragoons, who came sweeping up the plain at full gallop, and routing the enemy in an instant, chased them with heavy loss under the cannon of the fort. Lieutenant-Colonel Caldwell, of the Royal Irish Dragoons, who commanded the three squadrons, was wounded in the pursuit.\n\nAfter the fall of Douay, the Greys crossed the country of Artois to the banks of the river Bietres; and encamped before Bethune, which was at once besieged. They were subsequently occupied in escorting military stores up the country, and after the taking of Bethune, they were occupied with the sieges of Aire and Saint-Venant. The surrender of Aire ended the campaign.\n\nEarly in May, 1711, the army assembled in French Flanders, and[Pg 36] encamped, first at Warde, and next on the plain of Lens. After manœuvring skilfully, Marlborough succeeded in forcing the enemy's lines by the causeway at Arleux, crossed the Scheldt, and besieged Bouchain. In all this the Greys took part. After the fall of Bouchain, the army retired into winter quarters.\n\nIn 1712 the French sued for peace, and the Greys marched from the frontiers of Picardy into Flanders, staying there until the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. They then returned to England at the close of eleven years of hard war service.\n\nA satisfactory change now took place in the official status of the Greys. In 1694, when many English, Irish, and Scots regiments were serving in the Netherlands, King William commanded a board of general officers to assemble and decide upon the rank of the several corps. This board gave precedence to the English regiments, and the Scots and Irish were only allowed to take rank in the English army from the date of their first arrival in England, or from the date when they were first placed on the English establishment. There being three regiments of English Dragoons raised previous to 1688, when the Royal Scots Dragoons were first placed upon the English establishment, this regiment consequently obtained rank as Fourth Dragoons only.\n\nBut in 1713, when Queen Anne had ordered another board of general officers to assemble to decide upon the rank of several newly-raised regiments, proof was adduced that the Royal Scots Dragoon crossed the Border and entered England in June, 1685, when there was only one regiment of Dragoons on the English establishment.\n\nThis was taken into consideration, and after some delay the Scots Greys obtained the rank of Second Dragoons.\n\nRegiments were not, however, distinguished by numerical titles before the reign of George the Second.\n\nIn 1713 the regiment was increased to nine troops.\n\nThe Greys were next occupied in quelling the Rebellion of the Old Pretender, and here they won special distinction.\n\nIn 1719 the Jacobites, aided by Spain, made another attempt on Scotland, but were routed on June 10th at Strachell. Three troops of the Greys under Major Robinson were engaged.\n\n[Pg 37]\n\nIn April, 1721, reduced on account of peace to 207 men, the regiment left Scotland, and was placed in cantonments in the northern counties of England. In 1723 it returned to Scotland, and in 1725 marched into quarters in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.\n\nEarly in 1727 the Regiment was again increased to nine troops, and it was ordered to be ready for foreign service, but no embarkation took place. The nine troops were marched into quarters near Hounslow, and on October 28th were reviewed on the heath by King George the Second. They afterwards marched into quarters in Yorkshire, where the three augmentation troops were reduced, and the numbers of the establishment of the Regiment fixed at 309 officers and men.\n\nIn 1730 the Regiment was again in Scotland.\n\nIn 1737 it came back to England, and was chiefly busy on the Kentish coast suppressing smugglers.\n\nIn April, 1738, the regiment marched into Dorset and Wilts, to suppress popular riots.\n\nIn September, 1739, the Regiment was increased to 435 officers and men. Richard Cannon pictures the regiment spending the following summer encamped among the ancient oaks in Windsor Forest. In October it marched into Yorkshire, but soon came south again and was quartered in Berkshire.\n\nCharles the Sixth, Emperor of Germany, died in 1740, and England was a party to the Pragmatic Sanction by which the crown was guaranteed to his daughter Maria Theresa as Queen of Hungary and Bohemia.\n\nOn the other hand, the Elector of Bavaria, as descendant of Ferdinand the First, claimed these countries, and was supported by the French King, Louis the Fourteenth.\n\nOn June 19th, 1742, the Greys were reviewed by King George the Second on Kew Green, and three days later marched for Dover. A publication called \"The Champion\" records:—\n\n\"On Tuesday, General Campbell's fine regiment of Scots Greys arrived in the Borough of Southwark on their march to Dover, where they are to embark for Flanders. They are fine hardy fellows, and want no seasoning, and made an appearance agreeable to all but the innkeepers.\"\n\n[Pg 38]\n\nFor the two great campaigns that now followed I copy from the archives preserved by the Regiment a\n\nAt the risk of seeming lengthy, I must here add, without pretending to edit it, a paragraph from Cannon's very scarce record:—\n\n\"A tremendous cannonade was followed by volleys of musketry and charges of cavalry. The Greys supported the infantry for some time; but at length they were led forward by their Colonel, the chivalrous and daring Lieutenant-General James Campbell, against a line of French Cuirassiers. Their grey horses and grenadier caps rendered them conspicuous—their noble bearing excited admiration. Before them appeared the enemy's squadrons, formidable in numbers, and bright in polished armour; but undismayed by the opposing ranks of war, the Greys raised a loud huzza, and rushed at speed upon their steel-clad opponents, who were overthrown and pursued to the rear of their own lines....\n\n\"The Greys pursued their adversaries to the banks of the river, and captured a White Standard, with which they returned in triumph to their own lines, where they received the expression of the approbation of their Sovereign, who had witnessed their gallantry.... The standard was of white damask, finely embroidered with gold and silver; a thunderbolt in the middle, upon a blue and white ground; motto, Sensere Gigantes.\"\n\nThe following interesting 1747 record I copy from the Manuscript Papers now preserved by the Greys:—\n\n[The latter part of the foregoing extract is curiously worded; but I have made no alterations.—E. A.]\n\n[Pg 41]\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nThe Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed on October 7th, 1748, and the Greys returned to England, and were stationed at Leicester, Coventry, and Warwick. By the usual mean and miserable policy, or want of any policy, the Regiment was at once reduced to 285 officers and men! (In time of peace, always take care not to be prepared for war.) In December, 1749, the Regiment went into quarters in Kent, and was employed on revenue duty on the coast. In 1750 they were in Sussex and Devon, and in 1751 in Dorsetshire. The Regiment marched into Lancashire in the spring of 1753; with detached troops in Somersetshire, where it was stationed during the following year; and in the spring of 1755 proceeded to Northampton and other towns in that part of the kingdom. Complications now coming to a point about British and French possessions in North America, the Regiment's establishment was made up to 357 of all ranks, and very soon a light troop was added, in the same way as light companies had been added to regiments of infantry.\n\nIn the summer of 1755 the Greys occupied quarters in Herefordshire and in the winter months were dispersed in cantonments in Kent. In the next spring they marched into Surrey, and afterwards into Dorsetshire, and in June encamped with several other corps near Blandford.\n\nIn April, 1757, they went into cantonments in Essex, staying there four months, and then going into Suffolk. In October four troops proceeded to Newmarket.\n\nAn expedition was now made ready for a descent on the coast of France, and the \"light troop,\" commanded by Captain Francis Lindsay, was ordered on this service.\n\nThe following is from the \"Weekly Journal,\" 23 May, 1758:—\n\nOn June 5th, 1758, the Brigade landed on the coast of France about nine miles from St. Malo, and on the 7th set fire to the shipping in St. Malo.\n\nThe troops having succeeded in this, now came home again.\n\nIn August the Greys light troop formed part of another expedition which captured Cherbourg. After returning to England the light troop was quartered in towns on the coast of Sussex.\n\nThe Greys were among the troops sent to Germany under the command of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in the year 1758, at which time the Duke of Argyle commanded the Regiment. These troops landed at Embden on the 20th of July and were headed by the Duke of Marlborough and the Lord George Sackville.\n\nStill did their gallantry and good conduct preserve to them the high opinion which the Regiment had so justly merited in every conflict to which its squadrons were exposed.\n\nThe following notes are from a volume (belonging to the Regiment) lettered outside\n\n\"Regimental Orders, 1759.\"\n\nInside:—\n\nIn 1763 a treaty of peace was signed, and as early as February, 1763, the Greys quitted Germany, and marching through Holland, embarked at Williamstadt in North Brabant, landed at Gravesend, and proceeded to Hereford. Soon the light troop, which had remained in England, was disbanded, but 8 men per troop were now equipped as Light Dragoons. The establishment was reduced to 213 men![Pg 47] In November the Regiment marched to Scotland, and were stationed at Dalkeith and Musselburgh; but soon returned South, and in 1764 were stationed at Manchester and Warrington. In April, 1765, they marched to Worcester and Pershore. In 1766 they went to Sussex.\n\nAt this date \"Drummers,\" who had been on the establishment from the foundation of the Corps, were ordered to be replaced by \"Trumpeters.\"\n\nIn May, 1767, the Regiment marched to Canterbury, and in the winter of 1768 it was in winter cantonments in Lincoln and Boston.\n\nIn 1769 they went to Scotland, returning the next year to Warwick, Lichfield and Stratford-upon-Avon.\n\nThe greater part of 1771 was spent in cantonments in Dorsetshire and Somersetshire. In 1772 the Regiment was stationed at Canterbury, with detachments on coast duty in Kent. In May, 1773, it marched into quarters at Greenwich and the neighbouring villages; and on May 22nd King George the Third reviewed the Greys,—expressing his high admiration of the Regiment's appearance and discipline.\n\nThe newspapers of the time describe the day as particularly fine, and allude to the great crowds assembled to witness \"the martial appearance and correct manœuvring of this gallant old corps.\"\n\nThe Regiment now went to Ipswich and Bury St. Edmund's, and in the autumn extended its quarters to Norwich. In 1774 it marched to York, and again sent detachments on coast duty. In the spring of 1775 it marched again North, and remained in Scotland until April, 1776. After this it spent 11 months in Lancashire. Next the Regiment went to Worcester for a summer station, passing the autumn in Gloucester, Tewkesbury, Pershore, and Ludlow.\n\nIn 1778, when the War of Independence broke out, no heavy cavalry corps were sent to North America; but the establishment of the Greys was increased by some 250 men and horses, and 48 of these were equipped as Light Dragoons. The \"light\" part of the Regiment now consisted of 6 sergeants, 6 corporals, and 84 private men; and in April, 1779, these light horsemen were incorporated, with detachments from the 7th, 15th and 16th Dragoons, into a Regiment which was[Pg 48] numbered 21st Dragoons. During the summer of 1779 the Greys were encamped on Salisbury Plain, and other Dragoon Regiments with them. In November the Regiment went into quarters at Marlborough, Chippenham, Colne, and Malmesbury.\n\nIn the autumn of 1780 they marched into Worcestershire.\n\nIn January, 1781, two troops requisitioned by magistrates on account of disturbances, marched to Ludlow. In June the Regiment marched into Dorsetshire.\n\nIn 1782 the Regiment was at Durham, and in 1783 went north to Scotland. In this year, peace having been made with the United States of America, the Regiment's establishment was reduced to 232 all told.\n\nIn 1784 they marched south, and were stationed 11 months in Manchester.\n\nIn April, 1785, they went to Worcester.\n\nIn the summer of 1786 they occupied extensive cantonments in Dorsetshire, and early in 1787 four troops were called in to aid the civil power in Wiltshire. In June the Regiment marched into quarters in Hampshire.\n\nIn April, 1788, they were in quarters near Hounslow, and thence went to Ipswich, removing in the summer of 1789 to Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. Early in 1790 the Regiment marched into Yorkshire; from there 3 troops were soon sent to Newcastle-on-Tyne, and in September the other 3 troops marched to Durham. In the spring of 1791 they marched to Scotland, returning in the spring of 1792, and quartering in Lancashire. In December, 1792, an increase of 60 men was ordered.\n\nThe French Revolution having broken out, the Regiment was, in 1793, made up to 9 troops of 54 non-commissioned officers and men each; and soon 4 troops were ordered to be held perfectly ready for foreign service.\n\nOn January 20th, 1793, Louis the Sixteenth was murdered. The French envoy was at once ordered to leave England, and on February the 3rd the Convention declared war against England. The French attacked Holland, and a united British and Hanoverian force, commanded by the Duke of York, went to the help of the Dutch.\n\nOn July the 9th, 1793, 4 troops of the Greys embarked at[Pg 49] Blackwall for Flanders. The rest were left at Worcester, Tewkesbury and neighbouring towns. The 4 troops landed at Ostend on July 16th, and marching towards France joined the army laying siege to Valenciennes. After Valenciennes had been taken, they were at first occupied in covering the siege of Dunkirk; but this was soon abandoned, and they were next occupied near Lisle, and made a successful charge against some French cavalry on the heights of Cateau Cambresis. In November the 4 troops marched to Ghent.\n\nThe 5 troops remaining in England were increased to 80 men each.\n\nIn February, 1794, the 4 troops quitted Ghent for Beveren.\n\nOn April the 17th, after joining the army on the plains of Cateau, they supported the infantry attack on the villages of Vaux and Prêmont.\n\nAt day-break on May the 10th, the army was in position on the heights in front of Tournay, the Greys being formed in column of troops behind the left wing. The Bays, Greys, and Inniskilling Dragoons forming one brigade, advanced in open column of half-squadrons, with the Duke of York at their head; on approaching the enemy they formed line under a heavy cannonade and charged.\n\nThe following is in the Honourable J. W. Fortescue's account, Vol. IV., p. 249, of his splendid new History of the British Army:—\n\n\"At last, however, a little to the south of Willems, the battalion-guns of the British infantry came up and opened fire, when the French, after receiving a few shots, began to waver. The squadrons again charged, and an officer of the Greys, galloping straight at the largest of the squares, knocked down three men as he rode into it, wheeled his horse round and overthrew six more, and thus made a gap for the entry of his men. The sight of one square broken and dispersed demoralised the remainder of the French. Two more squares were ridden down, and for the third time the British sabres had free play among the French infantry.... Not for eighteen years was the British Cavalry destined again to ride over French battalions as they rode on this day; and then Stapleton Cotton was fated once more to be present, leading not a squadron of Carabiniers, but a whole division of horse to the charge at Salamanca. But the 10th of May 1794 is chiefly memorable as marking the date on which the new French infantry showed itself not unworthy of the old.\"\n\nIn November, 1795, the 4 troops of Greys embarked at Bremen for England and landed at South Shields on Christmas Eve. From[Pg 50] here they went to Northallerton, and in February, 1796, joined the rest of the Regiment at Canterbury.\n\nIn July of this year the Regiment was encamped near Weymouth; in September it went into quarters at Dorchester, Bridport, Weymouth, and Wareham.\n\nLate in 1797 the Regiment marched to Nottingham, Loughborough, Leicester, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch; in July, 1798, it was encamped in Windsor Forest, and in September went from there to Birmingham, Coventry, and Lichfield.\n\nIn the summer of 1799 the Regiment went to Dorchester, Bridport, and Weymouth. A ninth troop was now added, and in April, 1800, a tenth was added. A force called the Fencible Cavalry was disbanded, and from it 81 men, with 220 horses, were drafted to the Greys.\n\nIn October, 1800, the Regiment marched to Salisbury, Southampton, Blandford, Rumsey, and Portsmouth.\n\nIn 1801 the Greys marched to Dorchester.\n\nNow came the inevitable policy of parsimony, and no war being on hand, the Greys establishment was reduced to 8 troops of 29 officers, 8 quarter-masters, 28 sergeants, 8 trumpeters, and 480 rank and file, including 10 dismounted men in each troop.\n\nIn July, 1802, the Regiment marched to Croydon, Rumsey, and Eastbourne.\n\nThe folly of reduction was now shown. War opened with France again in 1803, and the Regiment's strength was brought up to 10 troops. Its efficiency was also promoted by adding 3 captains, and thus releasing the field officers from the charge of troops. The establishment now became 51 officers, 10 quarter-masters, 54 sergeants, 10 trumpeters, and 1,000 rank and file.\n\nIn June, 1803, the Regiment marched to Canterbury, staying there nearly two years, the period when Napoleon Bonaparte, First Consul of France, was hourly expected to attempt an attack on our coast.\n\nIn May of 1805 the Greys marched to Ipswich and Colchester.\n\nOn Thursday, January 9th, 1806, Lord Nelson was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral, and two squadrons of the Greys took part in the procession on this occasion.\n\nSoon afterwards the Regiment marched into Yorkshire and[Pg 51] Northumberland; and the talk of invasion having passed off, the Regiment was once more reduced, and the establishment became 40 officers, 10 quarter-masters, and 854 non-commissioned officers and men.\n\nIn January, 1807, the Regiment marched to Scotland. In June, 1808, the Regiment sailed to Ireland. In June, 1809, an alteration was made by substituting a regimental quarter-master and 10 troop sergeant-majors, in the place of the 10 troop quarter-masters.\n\nIn 1810 the Regiment sailed from Dublin for England, and now occupied quarters in Yorkshire and Lancashire. In the spring of 1813 the quarters of the Regiment were extended to Leicestershire and Derbyshire. Two troops were left at Birmingham, and in December 8 troops marched to Canterbury, remaining there and at Dover, Deal, and Hythe.\n\nThe following account relates to the review in Hyde Park before the Prince Regent, the King of Prussia, and the Czar of Russia, on June 21st, 1814, and is from The Times of Wednesday, the 23rd:—\n\n\"It is little less than impossible to keep pace in the public journals with all the movements of the illustrious personages now in the British metropolis, or to describe the affectionate zeal with which they are received.... Our army has now, with great reason, become as much our boast as our navy, and therefore the display of its merits—of the persons, the horses, the accoutrements, of its component parts—ought to excite as great an interest as the exhibition of our ships of war and their equipages. Their Majesties, we have reason to believe, were as highly gratified by the review as British hearts could wish. A detachment of the Greys attended the great potentates, accompanied by the Hetman Platoff and a small detachment of Cossacks.\n\n\"They were received with the loudest shouts by the populace. The Prince Regent, who was accompanied on one side by the King of Prussia, and on the other by the Emperor of Russia, was greeted with high applause. He was followed by Blucher and a most magnificent staff, superbly attired.\"\n\nIn July, 1814, the Regiment was reduced to 8 troops, amounting to 584 officers and men, including 16 dismounted men for each troop. In a few months the Regiment went into winter quarters at Bristol and Trowbridge.\n\nEarly in 1815 Napoleon was once more in France, and the Greys establishment was again made up to 10 troops, comprising in all 946 officers and men. Six troops were to be held in readiness to go abroad, and the other four were marched to Ipswich.\n\n[Pg 52]\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nBefore giving the several interesting contemporary records of 1815 in possession of the Regiment, allusion must be made to the two touching original records now belonging to the Regiment, relating to Colonel Hamilton, the commanding officer killed at Waterloo. One is a letter of May 15th, 1793, acquainting a Mr. Anderson that \"the King had been pleased to appoint Jamie a cornet in the Royal North British Dragoons.\"\n\nThe other letter is dated July 10th, 1815, and is from James Swan, 53, York Place, Edinburgh, to Mr. McLachlane, Writer, Glasgow. The letter records Colonel Hamilton's (son Jamie's) death.\n\nA folio volume, lettered outside:—\n\n\"Royal Scots Greys, Waterloo, 18th June, 1815, letters, etc., connected with Lieutenant-Colonel Inglis Hamilton, who was killed in action, in command of the regiment at Waterloo.\"\n\nInside is:—\n\nThe above letter bears the following most pathetic endorsement:—\n\nThe following letter, addressed:—\n\nThe letter is signed James Swan. In the margin Major J. W. Hozier has noted:—\n\n\"Trotter, son of Mr. Trotter of Worton Hall, Edinburgh.\"\n\nInserted in this volume are the leaves from \"Good Words\" of September 1st, 1866, containing \"Two Glasgow Stories,\" \"By the Editor.\"\n\nFrom a small unbound volume belonging to the Regiment:—\n\nCopies of letters written just previous to the battle of Waterloo, by F. C. Kinchant, Cornet, 2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys); also one describing his death by treachery during the battle, and the summary revenge taken therefor by the sergeant of his troop.\n\nThe originals are addressed to John Rose Hall, Esq., Cockshut Lydiate, Ludlow, Shropshire, England. They are now in the possession of Mrs. McLaughlin, step-daughter of the above-mentioned John Rose Hall.\n\n(Thus ends the first letter, and let us rejoice that it was not burnt.)\n\n[Pg 61]\n\nFrom a small volume lettered outside:—\n\n\"Extracts from a journal kept during the Waterloo campaign, by Lieutenant Archibald James Hamilton, of the 2nd or Royal North British Dragoons, presented to the Officers of the Royal Scots Greys by Major John G. C. Hamilton, M.P., of Dalzell, Lanarkshire, on the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, 1881.\"\n\n\"This is a portion of the Journal of my father, Archibald James Hamilton, who was a Lieutenant in the Scots Greys during the Waterloo campaign.\"\n\nCopy of a letter from A. J. Hamilton, Esq., of Dalziell House, Lanarkshire, N.B., a Subaltern in the Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, giving an account of the battle. John W.

In July, it went to London to attend the coronation of King George IV. In August, the establishment was further reduced to 6 troops.\n\nIn the summer of 1822 the Regiment marched to Scotland.\n\nOn August 15th, George IV. landed at Leith, where he was received by the Regiment, and the Regiment had the honour of attending upon him during his stay in Scotland. In July, 1823, the Regiment left Scotland, and was at first stationed at Newcastle-on-Tyne and Carlisle. In the summer of 1824, it was at Manchester and Nottingham; in May, 1825, at Coventry, Birmingham, and Northampton. In June, it was quartered near London—at Hammersmith and Turnham Green. On June 28th, the Greys, together with other cavalry and a brigade of Horse Artillery, were reviewed on Hounslow Heath by the Duke of York. The Greys now marched to Norwich and Ipswich. Early in 1826 they went to Ireland. In May, 1830, they embarked at Cork for Bristol, and marched into quarters at Dorchester, Weymouth, and Trowbridge; from whence they proceeded, in November, to Windsor.\n\nOn November 9th, Queen Adelaide inspected two squadrons in the riding-house at Pimlico. Before the end of November, the Regiment marched to Maidstone.\n\nIn 1831, they were at Brighton, Chichester, and Warley. In 1832, in Birmingham. In 1833, in York. In 1834, they marched to Edinburgh. In 1835, they were quartered at Leeds. In May,[Pg 76] 1836, they embarked at Liverpool for Ireland. The rest of the movements of the Regiment are, roughly: Brighton, 1841, Exeter, 1842 and 1843; Ipswich, 1844; Edinburgh, 1845; Dundalk, 1846; Clonmel, 1847; Athlone, 1848 and 1849; Longford, 1850; Canterbury, 1851; Dorchester, 1852; Birmingham, 1853; Nottingham, 1854.\n\nNow next, in regard to the Crimea, it would be absurd to try to adjust or supplement the following records. They are of unique interest. The Greys reached the Crimea on September 24th, 1854.\n\nA folio volume, the property of the Regiment, lettered—\n\n\"Historic Register, 2nd Dragoons,\" and inside, \"from August 10th, 1854\":—\n\n\"The average strength of the regiment during the period they have been in Turkey and the Crimea has been 223. They arrived in Turkey on August 10th, 1855, disembarking at Kulalie on the Adriatic side of the Bosphorus. Kulalie is about seven miles north of Scutari. There I joined the regiment from Varna on August 31st, having been transferred from the medical charge of the 93rd Highlanders to that of the Scots Greys on September 22nd.\n\n\"The corps embarked on board the Himalaya for the Crimea, and disembarked at the Katchu on September 24th, joining the allied army at the time it was executing its flank march on Balaclava. That night they bivouacked on the Belbee, and the following day came into collision with the enemy at the affair of Mackenzie's Farm, when they succeeded in capturing a quantity of baggage, ammunition, stores, &c.; also in capturing and destroying a portion of the rear guard of Prince Menchikoff's army, and without suffering the loss of a man on their part. The following day they were present at the capture of Balaclava, and bivouacked on the plains in front of that village. On October 25th they took a prominent part in the action in front of Balaclava, when the Russian army attempted to force that position, and they defeated and utterly routed a large body of the enemy's cavalry which had attacked and surrounded them in the proportion of three to one. After this 'feat of arms' they were led into the cross fires of the enemy's batteries, being ordered up to the support of the Light Cavalry Brigade their memorable but disastrous charge. On this occasion they sustained some severe injury, the wounds inflicted being nearly all of a serious nature caused by round shot, shell, grape and rifle balls.\n\n\"The loss of the regiment in this action amounted to 2 men killed and 54 wounded, several of whom subsequently died of their wounds, and 4 officers wounded. The three first men who fell were mortally wounded by rifle balls in covering the retreat of the Turks from the redoubts....\n\n[Pg 77]\n\nI now put on record the following exceedingly pertinent passages from Kinglake's \"Invasion of the Crimea,\" Vol. V., p. 98, &c., 6th edition, 1877:—\n\nThe Illustrated London News of November 25th, 1854, has two large illustrations, one a full page, called \"The Action at Balaclava: Charge of the Scots Greys, October 25th,\" and the other a double page illustration, \"The Battle of Balaclava: Attack of the Scots Greys.\" The reference is to the following:—\n\n\"The Attack of the Scots Greys.\n\n\"A soldier who was in the midst of the terrible conflict at Balaclava, and who escaped unhurt, gives the following account of what he felt and saw in that deadly struggle:—\n\n\"'We charged. Oh, God! I cannot describe it; they were so superior in numbers; they \"out-flanked\" us, and we were in the middle of them. I never certainly felt less fear in my life than I did at that time; and I hope God will forgive me, for I felt more like a devil than a man. We fought our way out of them as only Englishmen can fight; and the 4th, 5th, and 6th were there up with us. I escaped without a scratch, thank God, though I was covered with blood; my horse was not even wounded. But oh! the work of slaughter that then began—'twas truly awful; but I suppose it was necessary. We cut them down like sheep, and they did not seem to have power to resist. The plain is covered and covered with dead Russians, and, of course, we left some of our poor comrades on the field. We only lost two and about seven wounded. Well, when we had finished this lot we thought of going home to breakfast; but no, they (the enemy) had some guns over the hills that Lord Raglan sent word were to be charged, and captured at any cost. So off we went again. They received us very quietly into their ground—Lord Lucan leading the Heavies, and Lord Cardigan the Light Brigade. The Light charged first this time, took the guns, cut down the gunners, and then, when they thought all was right, they were met by thousands of Cossacks, who had been in ambush. The Royals, the Greys, the 4th, 5th, and 6th, now charged again. The butchering was repeated; when suddenl"
