On September 20th 1954, at the battle of Alma, he snatched the fallen Colours from the hands of Lieut. Anstruther, whose blood dyed them as he fell. Although severely wounded himself, being shot in the breast, he persisted in carrying the Queen?s Colours throughout the day. On September 8th following, he behaved with marked gallantry at the Redan, where he was shot through both thighs.\n\nGeneral O?Connor was born on February 21st 1831. After serving through the Crimean War, he fought in the Indian Mutiny 1857-58, and the Ashantee Expedition 1873. He retired from the service in 1887.\n\nEDWARD W. D. BELL\n\n(Captain, afterwards Major General, C.B.)\n\n23rd The Royal Welsh Fusiliers\n\nKnight Of The Legion Of Honour\n\nCaptain Bell won the Victoria Cross on the heights of Alma on September 20th 1854. Though more than decimated, the gallant Welsh charged up the hill in face of the Russian batteries and dense columns of infantry. The enemy was speedily in retreat. Captain Bell, seeing the enemy?s gunners in front of him preparing to ride off with one of their guns, which was actually limbered up, rushed forward, seized the leading horse, and, single handed captured the fieldpiece.\n\nAll his senior officers being killed or wounded, he found himself in command of the regiment, which he successfully brought out of action.\n\nThe gun was afterwards placed at Woolwich, the horses serving for some time in what was known as the ?Black Battery.?\n\nMajor-General Bell became Lieutenant in April 1842; Captain in December 1848; Brevet-Major 1854; Lieut. -Colonel in Jan 1858, Colonel in August 1862, and Major General on March 6th 1868. Was appointed to the command of the Belfast District February 28th 1875.\n\nJOHN PARK\n\n(Sergeant)\n\n77th Regiment\n\nAwarded the Victoria Cross for many acts of bravery and devotion in the Crimean War. He was noticed for his conduct at the battles of Alma and Inkerman; highly distinguished himself on April 19th 1855, at the taking of the Russian rifle pits, earning special praise from Colonel Egerton at the time; was severely wounded, and remarked for his determined resolution at the two attacks on the Redan.\n\nCOLLINGWOOD DICKSON\n\n(Brevet Lieut. -Colonel, now General, G.C.B.)\n\nRoyal Artillery\n\nDuring the first bombardment of Sebastopol on October 17th 1854, Sir Collingwood Dickson, seeing that his men were running short of ammunition, went repeatedly with great courage under a hurricane of shot and shell, and carried barrels of powder to them from the magazine. In addition to this he stood for hours exposed to all the dangers around him, directing the unloading and storing of ammunition. This was the first cross-awarded for the siege of Sebastopol.\n\nGeneral Sir Collingwood Dickson son of the late Major-General Sir A. Dickson, G.C.B., was born on November 20th 1817. Educated at R.M.A., Woolwich. Entered R.A., 1835, and was promoted Captain 1846; Brevet Lieut. ?Colonel 1854; Colonel, June 1855; General, October 1877; Inspector-General of Artillery 1870-75; colonel Commandant R.A., 1875. Retired in 1885.\n\nWILLIAM PEEL\n\n(Captain, Afterwards K.C.B.)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nCaptain Peel was awarded the Victoria Cross for three specific acts of bravery. On October 18th 1854, at the greatest possible risk, he picked up a live shell (the fuse of which was still burning) from several powder cases outside the Magazine, and threw it over the parapet. The shell burst as it left his hands, but his brave and prompt action saved the Magazine and the lives of all near him.\n\nAt Inkerman, at the Sandbag Battery, the Grenadiers were hard pressed while defending the Colours. This officer was conspicuous for his assistance on this occasion, and specially noticed by H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge, the Lieut. -General commanding the Division.\n\nAt the Redan, on June 18th 1855, he volunteered for the ladder party, carrying the first one himself, till he was struck down.\n\nHe took part in the relief of Lucknow in November 1857, and at the siege and capture in March 1858, dying of smallpox at Cawnpore, on his way to Calcutta on April 27th 1858.\n\nThird son of the Right Hon. Sir Robert Peel Bart, the distinguished Statesman, Sir William was born on November 2nd 1824, and passed away as above stated in his thirty third year.\n\nTHOMAS GRADY\n\n(Private, afterwards Sergeant)\n\n4th King?s (Royal Lancaster) Regiment\n\nThis brave Irishman, on October 18th 1854, volunteered to repair the embrasures of the battery on the Left Attack, assisted by another whose name has not been handed down. This act was accomplished successfully in clear daylight, under a heavy fire from a whole line of batteries. Again, on November 22nd, during the repulse of an attack on the most advanced trenches, although severely wounded he refused to quit his post among his comrades, but kept encouraging them to ?hold on,? and was the means of saving the position and preventing the guns from being spiked.\n\nSergeant Grady died some years ago in Victoria, New South Wales.\n\nWILLIAM McWHEENEY\n\n(Sergeant)\n\n44th (Essex) Regiment\n\nDecorated for his conduct on October 20th 1854, when he saved the life private John Keane who had been dangerously wounded when the Sharpshooters were forced to retreat from the ?Quarries.? He took Keane on his back and carried him for a long distance under heavy rifle fire until he could place him in safety. On December 5th 1854. Corporal Courtney, a sharpshooter, was severely in the head. McWheeney went out into the open and, under a terrific storm of lead, brought him some distance back. He then, with his bayonet, dug up the ground to form a slight cover for him, as they were by no means out of range and the fire was still very severe, and remained with him until darkness had set in, when he was able to retire with him into safety. On June 18th 1855, he volunteered for the advance guard of General Eyre?s Brigade in the Cemetery. The Gazette states that he was ?always vigilant and active,? and that he was ? never absent from duty during the war.?\n\nJOHN GRIEVE\n\n(Sergeant Major)\n\n2nd Dragoons\n\nAt Balaklava October 25th 1854, in the heavy Cavalry charge one of Grieve?s officers being surrounded by Russian horsemen, he rode to his rescuer, cut off the head of one of them, disabled two others, and put them to flight, thereby saving the life of his officer.\n\nHENRY RAMAGE\n\n(Private, afterwards Sergeant)\n\n2nd Dragoons\n\nAt the battle of Balaklava, Private McPherson of the 2nd Dragoons was severely wounded and surrounded by seven Russians. Private Ramage rode to his help, cut his way through the enemy and saved his comrade?s life. On the same day, when the Heavy Brigade was covering the retreat of the Light Cavalry, Private Gardiner?s leg was shattered by a round shot and he lay on the ground exposed to a very heavy cross fire. Ramage dashed to his rescue and carried him to the rear, the place where he had fallen being almost immediately covered by Russian Cavalry. He also, when the Heavy Brigade was rallying and the enemy retiring dismounted and brought in a prisoner from the Russian ranks.\n\nRamage died at Newbridge, Ireland, not long after receiving his decoration, which was sold in London on June 16th 1903 for ?61.\n\nJAMES MOUAT\n\n(Surgeon, afterwards Surgeon-General, K.C.B.)\n\n6th (The Inniskilling) Dragoons\n\nAfter the retreat of the Light Cavalry at the battle of Balaklava, on October 26th 1854, Lieut. -Colonel Morris C.B., 17th Lancers, was dangerously wounded and lying in a very exposed place. Surgeon Mouat went to his assistance and, in full view of the enemy, under a most severe fire, dressed his injuries, and by stopping a serious haemorrhage was able to save his life.\n\nSurgeon-General Sir James Mouat, son of the late J. Mouat, M.D., was born in 1815, and died in London on January 4th 1899. Educated at University College and hospital, London in 1837 admitted a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, being elected to the Fellowship in 1852. Entered the Army in 1838, serving during the Crimean War, at Balaklava, Inkerman and Tchermaya. Afterwards was principal Medial Officer in New Zealand 1863-5, receiving the thanks of that Government for his special and valuable services during the war. Appointed Honorary Surgeon to Queen Victoria 1888, and created a Military K.C.B. in 1894. Knight of the Legion of Honour.\n\nJOHN BERRYMAN\n\n(Troop-Sergeant-Major, afterwards Major)\n\n17th (The Duke of Cambridge?s Own) Lancers\n\nSergeant-Major Berryman was once of the many heroes who fought right through the Crimean War. He was ?mentioned? for Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and Mackenzie?s Farm, and at the last place captured three Russian soldiers close up to their own guns. At Balaklava his horse was shot under him in the charge, yet he remained with a wounded and dying officer (Captain Webb), whom he carried out of immediate range of the cannon. For his bravery at Inkerman, on February 24th 1857, he was specially mentioned in the London Gazette. Born on July 28th 1825, he died on June 27th 1896.\n\nALEXANDER ROBERT DUNN\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Lieut. -Colonel)\n\n11th Hussars\n\nOn October 25th 1854 during the charge of the Light Cavalry at Balaklava, Lieutenant Dunn saved the life of Private Bentley by riding at, and cutting down, some Russians who were attacking him from the rear. Later on he saw Private Levett hard pressed by a Russian Hussar, and rode to his assistance, cutting down his assailant.\n\nIn 1858 Lieut.?Colonel Dunn raised and commanded the 100th Royal Canadian Regiment, now 1st Batt. Leinster. He served in the Abyssinian War of 1868 as Lieut. ?Colonel of the 33rd Regiment, and lost his life during one of the hard fought actions of that year.\n\nJOHN FARRELL\n\n(Quartermaster-Sergeant)\n\n17th Lancers\n\nOn October 25th 1854 after the charges at the battle of Balaklava, when Farrell?s horse was shot from under him, Captain Webb was severely wounded. Farrell and Berryman (V.C.) carried the officer as far as the pain of his wounds would allow, and, when a stretcher was obtained, he assisted Berryman and a Private of the 13th Dragoons (Malcone V.C.) to carry him from the field. Farrell died at Secunderabad, India on August 4th 1865.\n\nJOSEPH MALONE\n\n(Sergeant, afterwards Riding Master)\n\n13th Hussars\n\nOn October 25th 1854, while returning on foot from the charge at Balaklava, in which his horse had been shot, Malone stayed, under a severe fire, to take charge of Captain Webb, 17th Lancers (who had been mortally wounded), until others arrived to assist in removing him.\n\nSAMUEL PARKES\n\n(Private)\n\n4th (Light) Dragoons\n\nDuring the charge of the Light Cavalry at Balaklava, October 25th 1854, Parkes horse had been shot and he was dismounted, while that of Trumpet-Major Crawford had also fallen and its rider had lost his sword. Parkes dashed up to him, placed himself between him and two Cossacks and drove them off. When attempting to follow the retreat of the Light Cavalry, six Russians attacked them, but he kept them at bay, retiring slowly, until, after defending his friend for some time, his sword was shattered by a shot.\n\nCHARLES WOODEN\n\n(Sergeant-Major, afterwards Quarter-Master 104th Bengal Fusiliers)\n\n17th Lancers\n\nOn October 26th 1854, after the battle of Balaklava, Sergeant-Major Wooden went to the assistance of Lieut. ?Colonel Morris, C.B., and rescued him when lying exposed to a very heavy fire thereby saving his life.\n\nGERALD L;ITTLEHALES GOODLAKE\n\n(Captain, afterwards Lieut. ?General)\n\n1st Batt. Coldstream Guards\n\nKnight Of The Legion Of Honour\n\nOn the occasion of ?the powerful sortie? made chiefly against the second Division on October 26th 1854, Major Goodlake was in command of the Sharpshooters of his battalion in the ?Windmill Ravine? well in advance of the picket-house erected there. This he held against a large force, his men placing hors-de-combat no fewer than thirty-eight of the enemy and taking three prisoners. The Major during this combat was the only officer present, and most of his men were very young soldiers, the successors of their more matured comrades who fell at Alma and during the siege. In November following in the same place, when commanding almost the same men, he surprised a picket, the following extract from Kinglake?s Crimea gives an illustration of the invaluable work done by Captain Goodlake ad his Sharpshooters during the war-\n\nMAJOR GOODLAKE V.C.\n\nFrom Kinglake?s ?Crimea?\n\nTo assure himself against any ambush, Captain Goodlake (taking with him Sergeant Ashton) had gone up to examine the caves, leaving the rest of his sixty men halted across the bed of the chasm and partly, too, on each bank. Whilst thus left for a moment without their commander, the sight of the Russian Column thronging up round the corner below suddenly confronted Goodlake?s men. The hostile force seemed like a mob, numbering about six or eight hundred men, and was pressing forward along the bed of the ravine and also along each of its banks. Goodlake?s people retreated firing.\n\nGoodlake himself, with Sergeant Ashton at his side, was still by the caves. Hemmed in by assailants and debarred by the craggy and difficult ground from any possibility of effectual retreat, he thought that he and the sergeant must submit to be made prisoners. Sergeant Ashton, however, suggested that if the captain and he were made prisoners they would be assuredly put to death, in vengeance for one of their recent exploits (referring to the fact that this little force under Goodlake had lately attacked a Russian picket, taking an officer and some of the men prisoners), and all notion of surrender being thereupon discarded, the alternatives of course was resistance. The Russians, whilst closing in upon their two adversaries, fired at them numbers of shots, which all, however, proved harmless. On the other hand Goodlake and the sergeant fired, each of them once, into the nearest clump of Russians, and then with the butt-ends of their rifles, knocked away the foremost of their assailants, and ran down to the foot of the bank. There, however, they were in the midst of a mob of Russians advancing up the ravine. To their great surprise, no one seized them; and it was evident that, owing to the grey cloaks and plain caps they both wore, the enemy mistaking them for his own fellow countrymen. Shielded by the illusion, and favoured, too, by the ruggedness of the ground and obstructive thickets of brushwood, which enabled them to be constantly changing their neighbours without exciting attention, they moved on unmolested in the midst of their foes; and, though strange, it is not the less true that this singular arch was continued along as distance of more than a half a mile. At length, with its two interlopers, the Russian throng came to a halt, and not without a reason, for it was confronted by the sixty men of the Guards, who, after the lengthened retreat they had made when their Chief was cut off from them, were now plainly making a stand and had posted themselves some thirty yards off, behind a little trench, which there seemed the bed of the gorge. Goodlake, with his trusty sergeant, soon crossed the intervening space, which divided the Russians from the English and found himself once more amongst his own people.\n\nLieut. ?General Goodlake, son of T. Goodlake, Esq., of Wadley, Berks was born on May 14th 1832. Entered the Royal Welsh Fusiliers 1848 exchanging into the Coldstream Guards in 1850; became Major in the Army, June 6th 1856; A.D.C. to Queen Victoria 1869; Major-General to the Land forces 1879; Lieut-General 1881; and died in 1890.\n\nJOHN AUGUSTUS CONOLLY\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Lieut. ?Colonel)\n\n49th (The Princess Charlotte of Wales) Regiment\n\n(Royal Berkshire)\n\nOn the attack by the Russians outside Sebastopol during the ?great sortie,? on October 26th 1854 (the day Balaklava), Lieutenant Conolly was in command of his company on outlying picket. The Russians hurled themselves on the Second Division. They were met, in the first instance, by the 49th, resolutely led by Conolly in frequent short, sharp charges, he himself engaging several of them in hand-to-hand fight, one after another, till at length, from loss of blood, he fell insensible, and had to be borne off the field. His gallant behaviour, no less than that of his men, elicited a General Order, in which all were deservedly praised. Soon afterwards he was promoted Captain into the Coldstream Guards as part reward for his bravery and devotion.\n\nDied at the Curragh of Kildare, Ireland in 1888.\n\nWILLIAM NATHAN WRIGHTE HEWETT\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Vice-Admiral, K.C.B., K.C.S.I.)\n\nNaval Brigade\n\nKnight of The Legion of Honour\n\nAt the great sortie from Sebastopol, on October 26th 1854, Lieutenant William Hewett was in charge of a battery. The Russians were swarming towards his post when the word was passed-by whom it was never ascertained-?Spike the guns and retire.? Hewett replied that ?such an order did not come from Captain Lushington, and he would not do it till it did.? He then pulled down the parapet and assisted by a few soldier, swung the gun round towards the advancing thousands, into which he poured so steady a fire that the advance was checked, and the battery saved. For his pluck at Inkerman on November 5th, he was specially ?named? in despatches.\n\nSir William Hewett died at Portsmouth on May 13th 1888, aged 54.\n\nSon of William Hewett Esq, he was born at Brighton in 1834. Entered the Royal navy at the age of thirteen; became Captain in 1862; Rear Admiral 1878. Served in China in Burmah; also in Ashantee, including the capture of Coomassie; Egypt, 1882; and the Eastern Soudan 1884.\n\nJAMES OWENS\n\n(Corporal)\n\n49th Regiment\n\nDecorated for his bravery on October 30th 1854, in personal encounter with the Russians and for nobly assisting Major Conolly of the Coldstream Guards. He died on August 30th 1901, and his Victoria Cross was sold in London on October 15th 1902.\n\nWILLIAM STANLACK\n\n(Private)\n\n1st Battalion Coldstream Guards\n\nDecorated for his courage in volunteering, when engaged as a Sharpshooter in October 1854, to crawl up to within six yards of a Russian sentry, in order to enable his officer (Major Goodlake, V.C.) to effect a surprise. The danger he ran was fully explained to Private Stanlock, but it did not deter him from under taking the perilous adventure.\n\nTHOMAS BEACH\n\n(Private)\n\n55th Regiment\n\nOn November 5th 1854, at the battle of Inkerman, Lieut. ?Colonel Carpenter of the 41st Regiment was lying wounded and several of the enemy were robbing him. Beach was on picket at the time. Seeing what the Russians were about, he attacked and killed two of them, protecting the officer from further molestation until the arrival of some men of the 41st Regiment.\n\nJOHN BYRNE\n\n(Private)\n\n68th Regiment\n\nAt the battle of Inkerman, November 5th 1854, the 68th were ordered to retire but Byrne returned towards the enemy and brought back a wounded soldier who would otherwise have fallen into their hands. On May 11th, following he engaged in a hand-to-hand fight with a Russian on the parapet of the work he was defending. He killed his opponent and took away his arms.\n\nHENRY HUGH CLIFFORD\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Major General, K.C.M.G.)\n\nRifle Brigade\n\nOn November 5th 1854 at the battle of Inkerman, Lieutenant Clifford was conspicuous by his bravery in leading a charge against the Russian lines. He cut off the head of one man and the arm of another, and by his determined assault, and the splendid following of his men, drove the Russians back. During the contest he saved the life of a soldier who had been wounded.\n\nSon of the 7th Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, he was born in Shropshire, on September 12th 1828, and died at Ugbrooke park, Chudleigh, in Devonshire on April 12th 1883\n\nEDWARD ST. JOHN DANIEL\n\n(Midshipman)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nRecommended by Sir Stephan Lushington for conspicuous bravery on November 5th 1854, when a call for volunteers was made to bring up powder from a wagon which had been left in a most exposed position owing to the horses being all killed. Captain Peel (V.C.), who was in command of the battery at the time, specially reported the bravery of this young naval officer. He also accompanied Captain Pel as A.D.C. at the battle of Inkerman, and, at the attack on the Redan on June 18th 1855, when his officer was wounded, displayed the greatest devotion to him, placing a tourniquet on his arm under a terrific fire.\n\nDaniel left the Navy in 1861, and his Bronze Cross found its way into the United Service Institute, Whitehall, where it now remains.\n\nJAMES GORMAN\n\nLengthy research had been required to correct incorrect stories written about this man by historians over the past one hundred and twenty five years, these writers had used a mixture of information on the lives of three men named James Gorman who had served in the Royal Navy between the 2nd March 1848 and 21st August 1860. And an impostor James Devereux of Southwark who claimed that he had joined the Navy as James H Gorman and had been awarded a Victoria Cross for his action?s at Sebastopol.\n\nAged thirteen years, James Gorman was part of the first intake of two hundred boys to be accepted into the Royal Navy as a apprentice on 2nd March 1848,\n\nJames was promoted to Ordinary Seaman 2nd Class 13 May 1852 and, two months later, to Able Seaman. It was with this rank that he served as a member of the Naval Brigade in the Crimea.\n\nThe Brigade, consisting of 1.020 officers and men from Her Majesty?s Ships Albion, Britannia, Bellerophon, Diamond, London, Queen, Rodney, Trafalgar and Vengeance, were placed under the Command of Captain Stephen Lushington of the Albion had been formed at the request of Lord Raglan who had asked the Navy for assistance. At first the sailors only worked around the camps in a non combatant role then as more of the Soldiers were either killed or wounded they were replaced by the Sailors.\n\nThe Crimean War was the first engagement where newspaper correspondents were allowed to accompany the troops and report first hand from the battlefield to London Newspapers. Reports by William Howard Russell of The Times were favoured by readers who believed them to be the most graphic. In describing the Battle of Inkermann, Russell quoted Lushingtons own words, ?The battle commenced at half past seven on a cold misty morning and was a determined attempt by the Russians to force the British from the heights above the town of Sebastopol, a long day of heavy fighting followed and the Russians were eventually driven back?.\n\nThis brief and understated quote does little to describe one of the bloodiest and confusing battles ever fought by the British. Whose soldiers, outnumbered four to one, engaged in desperate hand to hand fighting till they finally repulsed the Russians.\n\nIt was when a lightly defended British position appeared to be overwhelmed by the Russians, that James Gorman and his comrades performed their own desperate act of bravery.\n\nRussell reported the determination of the five sailors from the Albion who, as the Russians advanced up the Careenage Ravine inflicting heavy casualties on the British, were ordered to withdraw and leave the wounded. They replied that ?They wouldn?t trust any Ivan getting within bayonet range of the wounded?.\n\nThe five sailors then mounted the defence works Banquette. With the help of the wounded soldiers lying in the trench below them, who were reloading rifles and passing them up, they were able to keep up a continual and rapid rate of firing. This drove the enemy back three times when they were within 40 yards of the wounded soldiers. The Russians finally fell back and gave them no more trouble.\n\nVictory did not come cheaply. Two of these brave sailors, Thomas Geoghegan who had just returned from being treated for wounds he had received at Sebastopol and John Woods were killed during this action while James Gorman, Thomas Reaves and Mark Scholefield survived.\n\nDuring the following week James Gorman again distinguished himself bringing Captain Lushington to safety after Lushington had been surrounded and unhorsed by the enemy troops. Gorman was badly wounded during this act of bravery. He was returned to the Albion on 12 December 1854 where his left leg was amputated. Gorman then remained onboard the Albion while Reeves and Scholefield stayed ashore until September 1855.\n\nOn the 7 June 1856, James Gorman, Thomas Reaves and Mark Scholefield were recommended by Sir Stephen Lushington to Queen Victoria as being worthy recipients of the Victoria Cross. On the 24 February 1857 their names appeared amongst the 82 whom the Queen had conferred this very special honour.\n\nThe Queen presented Thomas Reeves with his decoration at the inaugural presentation in Hyde Park, London, 26 June 1857. On the same day two Victoria Crosses were dispatched through the War Office to be presented to Gorman and Scholefield who were both serving in the Second Opium War against China. 61 of the first 85 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Officers.\n\nJames Gorman had already received his Crimea Medal with Clasps for Inkermann & Sebastopol and the Turkish Crimea Medal, which had been presented to him by the Sultan of Turkey. He was paid off at Sheerness, 21 August 1860, his 26th Birthday.\n\nHe migrated to Australia where the Premier of New South Wales Henry Parkes employed him as drill master and gunnery instructor on the Nautical School Ship Vernon, on 17 April 1867. Where in addition to teaching the boys all facets of cutlass and rifle drill, he instructed the boys in gunnery practice.\n\nThe boys, the majority of whom were children of widows or woman, who had been deserted by their husbands, came from all parts of the state and were required to attend school for four hours each day in addition to learning a trade either seamanship, carpentry, tailoring or shoemaking.\n\nIn 1869 while still acting as gunnery instructor, James was appointed as Master at Arms in Charge of the lower deck. On Monday 1 April 1878, James Gorman VC was promoted to the position of Second Mate with a salary of 130 Pounds ($A260) per year.\n\nHe retained this position as third officer of the NSS Vernon until 7 June 1881. When disappointed that the Vernon was no longer teaching nautical skills to the 188 boys onboard, he transferred to the Ordinance Department, being appointed as the foreman of the magazines on Spectacle Island for a yearly salary of 175 Pound ($A350). Spectacle Island was the first official Naval Stores Complex in Australia and its powder magazine that was built in 1865 is still in use today\n\nDuring his time on NSS Vernon 1130 boys were received on the Ship. To be trained and educated for a minimum of two years. Aged twelve years or over, the boys were then apprenticed to the Colony?s settlers as farmhands or servants or to factories and businesses as labourers.\n\nOn 15 October 1882, aged 47 years James Gorman VC suffered a severe stroke. Three days later he died.\n\nHis funeral was held on 20 October 1882 with a grave side service taking place in the Church of England section of the Balmain Cemetery in Norton Street, Balmain. Among the large crowd of mourners were the Officers and a strong detachment of the boys from the NSS Vernon. A firing party comprising of the boys gave the usual naval salute.\n\n(Text for James Gorman VC kindly provided by Harry Willey, author of \"150 Years of the Victoria Cross, 1857-2007 Crimea to Afghanistan\". ISBN 978-0-9758264-2-3)\n\nANDREW HENRY\n\n(Sergeant Major, afterwards Captain, Land Transport Corps)\n\nRoyal Artillery\n\nA the battle of Inkerman on November 5th 1854, sergeant-Major Henry displayed great bravery in defending the guns of his battery against overwhelming numbers of the enemy, during which he was terribly wounded. His undaunted courage is thus referred to in Kinglake?s Crimea-\n\n?When the foremost of the enemy?s troops had so closely surrounded Henry?s guns as to be already but a few paces off, they charged in with loud shouts, undertaking to bayonet the gunners; but by Henry himself, and one at least of his people, they were encountered with desperate valour. Henry called upon the men to defend the gun. He and a valiant gunner named James Taylor drew their swords and stood firm. The throng of the Russians came closing in, very many of them for some reason bareheaded, and numbers of them, in the words of a victim, ?howling like mad dogs.? Henry with his left wrested a bayonet from one of the Russians and found means to throw the man down, fighting hard all the time with his sword arm against some of his other assailants. Soon both Henry and Taylor were closed in upon from all sides and bayoneted again and again, Taylor then receiving his death wounds. Henry received in his chest the up-thrust of a bayonet, delivered with such power as to lift him almost from the ground, and at the same time he was stabbed in the back and stabbed in the arms. Then, from loss of blood, he became unconscious, but the raging soldiery, inflamed by religion, did not cease from stabbing his heretic body. He received twelve wounds, yet survived.?\n\nAndrew Henry ?rose from the ranks? to Lieutenant in the Artillery, May 15th 1855. Becoming Captain six months later. Possessed four clasps for the Crimea in addition to the Sultan?s medal.\n\nJOHN McDERMOND\n\n(Private)\n\n47th Regiment\n\nAt Inkerman, November 5th 1854, this soldier saved the life of colonel Hely, who was lying wounded and surrounded by a number of Russians. McDermond rushed to his rescue and killed the soldier who had disabled him.\n\nAMBROSE MADDEN\n\n(Sergeant Major)\n\n41st Regiment\n\nDuring the battle of Inkerman, Madden led a party of his battalion and captured a Russian officer and fourteen soldiers, three of whom he personally accounted for.\n\nFREDERICK MILLER\n\n(Major, afterwards Lieut. ?Colonel)\n\nRoyal Artillery\n\nKnight of The Legion of Honour\n\nAt Inkerman, November 5th 1854, the Russians had surrounded a battery, driving part of one of our infantry Regiments through it. Major Miller, however, afterwards personally attacked three Russians, and led his men in charging the occupants of the battery, successfully preventing them from doing any damage to the guns.\n\nEntered the Royal Artillery in December 1848, and became Captain in April 1855.\n\nANTHONY PALMER\n\n(Private, afterwards Captain 3rd Essex R.V.)\n\n3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards\n\nDecorated for his bravery at Inkerman on November 5th 1854, when he followed Sir Charles Russell, V.C., into the Sandbag Battery. Was also present when the charge was made in defence of the Colours. It is stated that Private Palmer saved the life of Sir Charles Russell by killing the Russian who was about to bayonet him.\n\nHis Victoria Cross is now in the United Service Institute, London.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE HENRY HUGH MANVERS PERCY\n\n(Colonel, afterwards Lord Percy)\n\nGrenadier Guards\n\nOn November 5th 1854 at the battle of Inkerman, Colonel Percy charged alone far ahead of his men into the Sandbag Battery, which was at the time strongly held by the enemy, who kept up a heavy fire of musketry. On the same day hr found himself, with many soldiers of various regiments who had charged too far, almost surrounded by the Russian.\n\nWithout ammunition and exposed to severe fire from the enemy, their position was most precarious, but Colonel Percy, by his knowledge of the ground and skilful leading, brought the men to where fresh ammunition could be obtained, and they were able to continue the fight.\n\nH.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge signified his approbation of his gallant conduct on the spot.\n\nJOHN PRETTYJOHN\n\n(Corporal, afterwards Colour-Sergeant)\n\nRoyal Marine Light Infantry\n\nAt the battle of Inkerman, Corporal Prettyjohn greatly distinguished himself by his cool courage, in going on ahead of the men and opening fire upon the enemy, killing four of them and so checking their advance.\n\nHe died on January 20th 1887.\n\nTHOMAS REEVES\n\n(Seaman)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nAssociated on November 5th 1854. At Inkerman in a heroic act described in the record of Gorman.\n\nHUGH ROWLANDS\n\n(Brevet Major, Now General, K.C.B, C.B.)\n\n41st Regiment\n\nDecorated for gallant conduct on November 5th 1854, in saving the life of Colonel Hely of the 47th Regiment, who was wounded and surrounded by Russian soldiers. Also at Inkerman, at the commencement of the great battle, his bravery was most conspicuous. By his exertions and courageous leading, the advanced picket held the ground they had occupied, against the attack of the enemy.\n\nBorn in 1829, Sir Hugh Rowlands entered the army in 1849. For his services in the Crimean War, besides the decoration of the Victoria Cross, he received his Brevet-Majority, 5th Class Medjidie, and Turkish Medal, and was created Knight of the Legion of Honour. Served in the Kaffir and Zulu Wars, 1877-9, being mentioned in despatches; from 1884-9 was in command of a 1st class district in India, and from 1893-6 commanded the Scottish District.\n\nSIR CHARLES RUSSEL, BART\n\n(Brevet-Major, afterwards Lieut. ?Colonel)\n\nGrenadier Guards\n\nOn November 5th 1854, at the battle of Inkerman, Sir Charles Russell offered to dislodge a party of Russians from the Sandbag Battery if any one would follow him. His call was quickly answered, Sergeant Norman V.C., Privates Anthony Palmer, V.C., and Bailey being the first. Bailey was killed, but under the courageous leadership of Sir Charles Russell the attack proved a complete success, the enemy being driven from their position.\n\nMARK SCHOLEFIELD\n\n(Seaman)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nAt the battle of Inkerman, November 5th 1854, Scholefield was associated with Gorman (V.C.) and Reeves (V.C.) in a heroic act described in the record of Gorman.\n\nMARK WALKER\n\n(Lieutenant and Adjutant, afterwards General, K.C.B.)\n\n30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment\n\nLieutenant Walker was awarded the Victoria Cross for a particularly courageous action at the battle of Inkerman on November 5th 1854. When the pickets gave the alarm, the 30th Regiment advanced in two battalions, the right under Colonel Mauleverer, and the left under Colonel Petullo. Lieutenant Walker was with the former battalion, which moved towards a low wall and lay down. Suddenly from out the thick fog, which had been hanging over the ground since daylight, two heavy columns of Russian Infantry appeared close upon them, and the 30th were ordered to open fire. In those days it was the custom to pile arms at night before the men?s tents, and the stoppers of the Rifles had been lost, causing the arms to become wet and useless. With the Russians coming closer and closer, the position became most critical, and under such disadvantages, there was a possibility of the men becoming nervous and out-of-hand. It was at this moment that Lieutenant Walker grasped the situation. He sprang up on the low wall, and calling on his men to follow him with the bayonet, led them straight at the Russian ranks. The suddenness of the appearance and attack of our men, and the fact that they could not see how small our party really was, caused a panic among the enemy, who, in spite of the exhortations of their officers, turned and bolted, followed some distance by the intrepid little party. The success of this affair was almost entirely due to the cool and courageous conduct of Lieutenant Walker, who, by his splendid example under sudden adverse circumstances, gave encouragement to his men, and turned what might have proved a serious reverse into a brilliant episode of the battle. Soon afterwards, Lieutenant Walker volunteered and led a party, which destroyed a Russian rifle pit, and for his conduct on this occasion was promoted, into the Buffs.\n\nGeneral Sir Mark Walker, son of Captain Alexander Walker, of Gore Port, county Westmeath, a distinguished peninsular officer, was born on November 24th 1827. Educated at Portarlington, he entered the army in 1846 and served as Adjutant of the 30th Regiment all through the Crimean War. At the battle of Alma his horse was shot under him and he was wounded. While serving in the trenches he was again wounded, this time so seriously as to necessitate amputation of the right arm. Frequently mentioned in despatches. Served through the China War of 1860 as Brigade Major. Commanded a Brigade at Kamptu 1875-9; at Aldershot 1883-4; and Gibraltar 1884-8. Colonel of the Sherwood Foresters from 1900, he died at Arlington Rectory, Barnstaple, on July 18th 1902, and is buried at Folkestone where he had lived for many years.\n\nGEORGE WALTERS\n\n(Sergeant)\n\n49th Regiment\n\nOn November 5th 1854, at the battle of Inkerman, Brigadier-General Adams, C.B., was surrounded by Russians and in a perilous position. Walters went to the officer?s rescue and saved his life by bayoneting one of his assailants.\n\nF. WHEATLEY\n\nOn November 10th 1854, before Sebastopol, this soldier performed the plucky act of throwing over the parapet a live shell which had fallen into the trenches.\n\nCLAUDE THOMAS BOURCHIER\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Colonel)\n\n1st Battalion (The Prince Consort?s Own) Rifle Brigade\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nLieutenant Bourchier was among those who captured and held the Russian rifle pits on November 20th 1854.\n\nThese places were appropriately called by the besiegers ?ovens,? or ?wasps? nests,? and from the Russian riflemen killed many of our men every night. To put an end to this, Major Bourchier determined that they should be captured and destroyed. In doing this he so highly distinguished himself that his name and his acts of bravery were promulgated in French General Orders. On the fall of Lieutenant Tryon he succeeded to the command of the two hundred men of his regiment engaged in effecting this important capture.\n\nWILLIAM JAMES MONTGOMERY CUNINGHAME\n\n(Captain, afterwards Colonel Sir William, Bart)\n\n1st Battalion (Prince Consort?s Own) Rifle Brigade\n\nOn November 20th 1854, during the capture of the Russian rifle pits, Captain Cunninhame displayed great bravery. The fight was a most severe one, and his conduct was particularly distinguished. The affair attracted the attention of the French General, who recorded it in General Orders. Sir William Cunninghame, Bart., born in 1834, was present at the actions of Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman and Sebastopol.\n\nWILBRAHAM OATES LENNOX\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Lieut. ?General, K.C.B.)\n\nRoyal Engineers\n\nOn November 20th 1854, during the siege of Sebastopol, it became necessary to establish a lodgement in some dangerous rifle pits, overhanging the Woronzoff Road. Lieutenant Lennox was conspicuous, among many others, by his ?cool and gallant conduct? in repelling the numerous and persistent assaults of the enemy. This brilliant operation drew forth the compliment of a special order from Marechal Canrobert, of the French Army, at whose request the Rifle Brigade was selected to make the capture.\n\nSir Wilbraham Lennox, son of the late Colonel Lord J. G. Lennox, was born in 1830, and served through the Indian Mutiny; with the German Army in the Franco-Prussian War, 1870; and with the Turkish Army during the Russo-Turkish War 1877. Brigadier-General in Egypt 1884-7, and in command of the Forces at Ceylon 1887-8, Director-General of Military Education 1893-4.\n\nWILLIAM NORMAN\n\n(Private)\n\n7th Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)\n\nOn the night of December 19th 1854, when placed on a single sentry duty a considerable distance in advance of the others in the White Horse Ravine (a task requiring much courage and vigilance, as the enemy?s picket was only 300 yards distant), three Russians crept up under cover of brushwood to reconnoitre our position. Without any noise, lest he should give the alarm, Private Norman went stealthily towards them, and single-handed, captured two of them.\n\nWILLIAM JAMES LENDRIM\n\n(Corporal, afterwards Quartermaster-Sergeant)\n\nRoyal Engineers\n\nThe Victoria Cross was awarded to this non-commissioned officer for intrepid conduct on April 11th 1855, before Sebastopol, in getting on to a parapet under a hail of lead and extinguishing a fire, which had broken out among the sandbags.\n\nHe was practically prominent in setting a fine example of courage to a party of one hundred and fifty French Chasseurs, whom he was superintending, on February 14th 1855, during the building of No. 9 Battery, Left Attack and replacing all the capsized gabions under heavy fire. (Awarded French War Medal.) On April 20th he was one of the four volunteers to destroy the farthest Russian rifle pit.\n\nHe died in October 1892 at Camberley, where he had long held the post of Quartermaster-Sergeant to the Staff College.\n\nGEORGE GARDINER\n\n(Colour-Sergeant)\n\n57th West Middlesex (Duke of Cambridge?s Own) Regiment\n\nOn March 22nd 1855, Sergeant Gardiner was orderly-sergeant to the field officers on trench duty. The Russian attack was sudden, and there was a momentary retirement out of the trenches. Gardiern hastened to the threatened point, rallied the men, led them against the enemy and regained the position at the point of the bayonet. On June 18th, his courage and devotion to duty was marvellous. He remained in front of the enemy, encouraging others to do the same, taking shelter in the holes made by the exploded shells, and making a parapet of the dead bodies of his comrades! From this gruesome entrenchment they kept yup a steady fire until their ammunition was exhausted.\n\nThis was done, according to the official account, under a fire by which nearly half the officers and one-third of the rank and file of the party of the Regiment were placed hors-de-combat.\n\nALEXANDER WRIGHT\n\n(Private)\n\n77th Regiment\n\nDecorated for special bravery during the whole Crimean War. Greatly distinguished himself on the night of March 22nd 1855, in repelling a sortie and at the taking of the rifle pits on the night of April 19th 1855, being specially noticed on that occasion for the fine example he gave the men while holding the position under a terrible fire. Displayed great bravery also on August 30th 1855, when he was wounded.\n\nWILLIAM COFFEY\n\n(Private)\n\n34th Regiment\n\nDecorated for his bravery on March 29th 1855, when he threw a lighted shell, which had fallen into the trench over the parapet.\n\nJOHN SULLIVAN\n\n(Boatswain?s Mate)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nSir S. Lushington recommended Sullivan for the Victoria Cross for an act of great bravery on April 10th 1855. A concealed Russian Battery was doing great execution on one of our advanced works, and, in order to enable our No. 5 Battery to open fire on it, Sullivan deliberately placed a flag on a mound in a most exposed position under a terrific fire. Commander Kennedy reported that Sullivan?s gallantry was always conspicuous.\n\nSAMUEL EVANS\n\n(Private)\n\n19th (1st Yorkshire) (Alexandra, Princess of Wale?s Own) Regiment\n\nSamuel Evans volunteered, on April 13th 1855, to enter an embrasure in order to repair the damage done by a concentrated fire on one of our batteries before Sebastopol. Our gunners were nearly all killed, and while others wee being brought up to take their place, Evans and Callaghan entered the battery, and, leaping into the embrasure under a heavy fire, undauntedly preserved until the breach was mended. Callaghan fell during the war. Evans was one of the sixty-two who received the Cross-from Her Majesty the Queen on June 26th 1857. Originally a 26th Cameronian, which he joined in 1839, serving it in China in 1842, gaining his first Medal, followed by the Crimean with three clasps, the French and Turkish. He died at Edinburgh in his eighteenth year in October 1901.\n\nMATTHEW CHARLES DIXON\n\n(Captain, now Major General, retired)\n\nRoyal Artillery\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nColonel Dixon was in command of a battery before Sebastopol, on April 17th 1855. On the afternoon of that date, during a terrible cannonade, a shell fom the enemy blew up his magazines, destroyed the parapet, killed and wounded ten men, dismounted or otherwise disabled five guns, and covered a sixth with earth. One solitary gun remained. With this he encouraged and helped his few remaining men to open fire on the enemy, keeping it in action, working as a gunner himself, until the sun went down, and being all the time (some seven hours) exposed to the concentrated fire of the enemy?s line of batteries.\n\nMajor-General Dixon, son of General Matthew Dixon, R.E., was born at Avranches in Brittany in 1821. Educated R.M.A., Woolwich. Joined the R.A. on March 19th 1839; became Captain 1848; Major 1855; colonel 1860, and Major General 1869.\n\nHENRY McDONALD\n\n(Colour-Sergeant, afterwards Captain)\n\nRoyal Engineers\n\nDecorated for conspicuous bravery on April 19th 1855, when engaged in effecting a lodgement in the enemy?s rifle pits, in front of the left advance of the right attack on Sebastopol. Later on in the day, the Engineer officers being wounded and the command developing on him, he persisted on the Sap, in spite of the repeated attacks of the enemy.\n\nHe died in Glasgow on February 15th 1893, aged 70\n\nJOSEPH BRADSHAW\n\n(Private)\n\n2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort?s Own)\n\nAmong some almost impregnable rocks overhanging the Woronzoff Road the Russians had constructed rifle pits, and from these a harassing fire was kept up day and night upon our men. As this was becoming unbearable and greatly interfered with some works we were engaged upon, Bradshaw, on April 22nd 1855 (accompanied by Robert Humpston) attacked and captured one of the pits in broad daylight, holding it until support arrived, when the rest of these ?wasp?s nests?-as they were called-were destroyed.\n\nFor his gallant exploit he received a gratuity of ?5 and was promoted on the spot.\n\nROBERT HUMPSTON\n\n(Private)\n\n2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade\n\nA new battery was being erected by our men on the extreme right front of the 2nd Parallel Left Attack and every night the work was greatly impeded by the fire from some Russians in a rifle pit, situated among the rocks overhanging the Woronzoff Road, between the 3rd Parrallel Right Attack and ?the Quarries.? On April 22nd 1855, in broad daylight Robert Humpston and Joseph Bradshaw stormed and took it, and on further support being obtained, they eventually destroyed it. Both men received a gratuity of ?5 and were promoted, in addition to being awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\nR. McGREGOR\n\n(Private)\n\n2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade\n\nDecorated for his conspicuous bravery when employed as a Sharpshooter in July 1855. Two Russians occupying a rifle pit went were most annoying by their continuous fire, and McGregor crossed the open space under a hail of bullets, took shelter under a rock and dislodged them, occupying the position himself.\n\nTHOMAS DE COURCY HAMILTON\n\n(Captain, Afterwards Major-General) 68th Durham Light Infantry\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nOn the night of May 11th 1855, the Russian made a most determined sortie from Sebastopol, but Captain Hamilton led a few men from a battery of which he held possession and boldly charged the enemy. His gallantry and daring conduct on this occasion was most conspicuous, and by his courageous initiative the works were saved from falling into the enemy?s hands.\n\nMajor-General Hamilton, son of the late James John Hamilton, Esq., Ballymacoll, Co. Meath, was born at Stranraer, Wigtonshire, and July 20th 1825. Educated privately. Joined the 90th Light Infantry, 1842, serving through the Kaffir War of 1846. Present with the 68th Light infantry at Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman and the siege and fall of Sebastopol, obtaining medal and four clasps and the Turkish medal. Retired 1874.\n\nCECIL WILLIAM BUCKLEY\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Captain) Royal Navy\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nOn May 29th 1855, while serving as junior Lieutenant of the Miranda, Captain Buckley, accompanied by Lieutenant Burgoyne and Gunner John Robarts, landed and set fire to immense quantities of stores belonging to the Russians at Genitchi, in the Sea of Azoff. Captain Lysons, in his despatch, remarked that these stores were in a particularly favourable position for supplying the Russian Army, and that their destruction was of the utmost importance. This act was carried out in the presence of a very large force of the enemy and at imminent risk.\n\nOn June 3rd, following, Captain Buckley, this time in company with Henry Cooper (V.C.), boatswain, performed a similar act of bravery at Taganrog, the dangers of this second desperate undertaking being equally as great as the first.\n\nHis name appears first in the Gazette as being awarded the Victoria Cross, although Mr. Lucas performed the earliest act for which the decoration has been gained. The institution of the Victoria Cross was made retrospective to the commencement of the Crimean War.\n\nCaptain Buckley died at Funchal, Madeira, on December 7th 1872.\n\nHUGH TALBOT BURGOYNE\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Captain)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nHugh Talbot Burgoyne was Senior Lieutenant of the Swallow, in the Sea ofAzoff, in May 1855, and on the 29th of that month, with Lieutenant C. W. Buckley (V.C.) and Mr J. Robarts (V.C.), gunner, landed at Genitchi and destroyed, in spite of an over whelming force, vast quantities of Government stores and forage for use of the Russian Army in the Crimea. At Taganrog, on June 3rd, he performed a similar act of daring, in face of a still stronger force.\n\nCaptain Burgoyne, fifteen years afterwards, when in command of H.M.S. Captain, went down with that vessel off Cape Finisterre during the night of September 6th 1870. Of the officers and crew, 490 men, only eighteen were saved. The names of the men drowned are to be found recorded on a brass tablet in St. Pal?s Cathedral.\n\nJOHN ROBARTS\n\n(Chief Gunner) Royal Navy\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nMr J. Robarts on May 29 and June 3rd 1855 was one of the few who landed from the boats of the Miranda to destroy stores, forage and ammunition at Genitchi and Taganrog.\n\nMr Robarts died October 17th 1888.\n\nHENRY COOPER\n\n(Boatswain) Royal Navy\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nHenry Cooper accompanied his commander, Lieutenant Buckley, R.N., in his gallant and desperate exploit at Taganrog, on the night of June 3rd 1855, when he landed in the face of a great force of Russians and fired the stores.\n\nCooper survived his chief by twenty-one years, having died at Tor Point, Devon, on July 15th 1893.\n\nGEORGE SYMONS\n\n(Lieutenant, 5th Battalion Military Train)\n\n(Late Sergeant Royal Artillery)\n\nDecorated for the heroic act on June 6th 1855, of unmasking the embrasures of a five-gun battery. The Russians commenced a terrific fire on his opening the first embrasure, and increased, and increased its ferocity in proportion as each additional one was opened. He performed the uncovering of the last one by boldly mounting the parapet and throwing down the sandbags, but was badly wounded by a shell, which burst while he was performing his task. The Cross-awarded him for this brave act has found its way to the United Service Institute, London.\n\nMATTHEW HUGHES\n\n(Private)\n\n7th Regiment\n\nColonel Campbell, 90th Light Infantry, specially noticed the gallant conduct of Hughes on June 7th 1855 as the storming of ?the Quarries.? He twice went for ammunition across the open ground, also going to the front and bringing in Private John Hampton, who was lying wounded. On June 18th 1855, he volunteered to bring in Lieutenant Hobson of his regiment, who had been shot, and in performing this humane act was him severely wounded.\n\nTHOMAS ARTHUR\n\n(Gunner and Driver)\n\nRoyal Artillery\n\nOn June 7th 1855, when in charge of the Magazine in one of the batteries, Arthur carried, of his own accord, barrels of powder and ammunition for the 7th Fusiliers several times across the open. On June 18th 1855 he volunteered for and formed one of the party who spiked the guns at the assault on the Redan. Arthur fought in the China War of 1860 and died at Savernake in March 1902, his Cross being sold in London on July 17th of that year for ?47.\n\nHENRY MITCHEL JONES\n\n(Captain)\n\n7th The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)\n\nOn June 7th 1855, during the attack on the ?Quarries? before Sebastopol, Captain Jones behaved with great coolness and daring in the face of overwhelming numbers. Repeatedly he led the men around hi to repel the continual assaults of the enemy during the night. Although suffering from severe wounds received earlier in the day, in order to encourage his men he remained unflinchingly all night long at his dangerous post, until after daylight next morning.\n\nRetiring in 1857, Captain Jones ha occupied diplomatic positions in Tabreez, Christiania, Philippopolis, Bangkok, Lima, and Quito.\n\nJOHN LYONS\n\n(Private)\n\n19th Regiment\n\nDecorated for bravely taking up, on June 10th 1855, a live shell which had fallen among the guard in the trenches and throwing it over the parapet.\n\nTHOMAS WILKINSON\n\n(Bombardier) Royal Marine Artillery\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nThomas Wilkinson was specially recommended for his brave conduct on June 5th 1855. He was in the advanced batteries, and when the breast-work was much injured by the Russian Artillery, most courageously repaired it under a very galling fire.\n\nHe died at York on September 22nd 1877.\n\nJOSEPH PROSSER\n\n(Private)\n\nDecorated for two acts of bravery. On June 16th 1855, when on duty before Sebastopol, he pursued and caught, less than two heavy cross fires, a soldier deserting to the enemy. On August 11th 1855, when in the most advanced trench before Sebastopol, he left it and went to the assistance of a soldier of the 95th Regiment who had fallen badly wounded, and succeeded in carrying him into safety, all the time under a heavy fire.\n\nJOHN ALEXANDER\n\n(Private)\n\n90th Regiment\n\nOn June 18th 1855, after the attack on the Redan, Alexander went out of the trenches and brought in several wounded under a heavy fire.\n\nHe also on September 6th 1855, went out and assisted to bring in Captain Buckley, of the Scots Fusilier Guards, who was lying dangerously wounded in an exposed position. He never lived to receive the Cross-he so nobly earned, as he was killed in India on September 24th 1857, during the Mutiny.\n\nHENRY CURTIS\n\n(Boatswain?s Mate)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nThe act of bravery and of humanity, which gained for this ?blue-jacket?, the Victoria Cross, on June 18th 1855, is given in the Record of Admiral Henry Raby V.C. On that day, with J. Taylor, V.C. he assisted in rescuing a young soldier of the 57th in front of the Redan. The three sallied out of the shelter of the trench and brought in the wounded man, who had been shot through both legs.\n\nThe distance they had to travel forward and back were about a hundred yards each way.\n\nCurtis died at Buckland, Portsmouth on November 23rd 1896.\n\nHOWARD CRAUFURD ELPHINSTONE\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Major General, K.C.B.)\n\nRoyal Engineers\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nDuring the night of June 18th 1855, after an unsuccessful attack on the Redan, this brave officer collected together a party of volunteers of all corps and proceeded to bring back from under the enemy?s guns on the ramparts the scaling-ladders left behind during the assault, thereby saving them from falling into the hands of the Russians. No sooner had he finished his task than he again set forth, leading the same gallant men, to search for the wounded who were lying close up to the Redan, and whose cries for water could be heard in the distance from time to time. In this he was most successful, carrying in no less than twenty men himself. It is said to relate that Sir Howard Elphinstone was, on March 8th 1890, washed overboard and drowned when on a voyage to Madeira on R.M.S. Tongariro.\n\nSon of Captain Alexander Elphinstone, R.N., he was born at Riga, Northern Russia, on December 12th 1829. Educated abroad and at Woolwich, passing into the Royal Engineers in December 1847; became Captain 1856; Colonel 1864; Major General 1887; A.D.C. to H.M. Queen Victoria 1877-87. Commanded the Devonport district from 1889 until his death.\n\nTHOMAS ESMONDE\n\n(Captain, afterwards Lieut. ?Colonel)\n\n18th (The Royal Irish) Regiment\n\nOn June 18th 1855, during the attack on the Redan, captain Esmonde several times displayed great gallantly in rescuing the wounded, all the time under a very heavy fire from the enemy.\n\nOn June 20th, while in command of a covering-party, a fireball fell close to them, and, knowing that a heavy fire would greet any one exposing himself, he called to his men to stand and take shelter, and dashing out commenced to extinguish it. As he had anticipated, a terrific hail of shot and shell directed upon him, but in spite of all he succeeded in his courageous act and escaped unscathed.\n\nGERALD GRAHAM\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Lieut. ?General, G.C.B., G.C.M.G.)\n\nRoyal Engineers\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nSir Gerald?s first recorded conspicuous act of bravery happened on June18th 1855. The Redan-in compliment to our brave allies, and in order to obliterate the memories of another June 18th, just forty years before-was to be attacked, with what result is well known. Lieutenant Graham-he was then only twenty-four- led a ladder party right up to the cannon?s mouth. Our columns were repulsed, and obliged tom retire, and it was then that Lieutenant Graham sallied forth, and with great dash rescued from death and misery many wounded officers and men. Sir Gerald Graham?s later campaigns have been those of China 1860; (Medjidie) Egypt 1882; Eastern Soudan 1884; and Suakin 1885. Retired 1890.\n\nSon of R.H. Graham, M.D., of Eden Brows, in Cumberland, he was born on June 27th 1831,and died in his seventy-ninth year at Bideford, Devon, on December 17th 1899.\n\nWILLIAM HOPE\n\n(Lieutenant) 7th The Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regeiment)\n\nLater Lieut. ?Col. City of London A.V.\n\nOn June 18th 1855, our troops were forced to retire after the attack on the Redan. Lieutenant Hope, being informed by Sergeant Major William Bacon that an officer, Lieutenant Hobson, had been severely wounded and was lying outside the trenches, started off to search for him, and found him in the old agricultural ditch running towards the left flank of the Redan. He then went for assistance, and four men returned with him, but he saw the officer could not be removed without a stretcher, so went back across the open ground to Egerton?s Pit. Having been able to secure what he needed, he again faced the rain of bullets, carrying the stretcher, and was finally able to convey Lieutenant Hobson to shelter. During the entire accomplishment of his humane action, the fire from the Russian batteries was heavy and continuous.\n\nColonel Hope, born April 12th 1834, is the son of the late Rt. Hon. John Hope. Educated at Hatefield and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Besides the heroic act related above he is stated to have saved the lives of thousands of men on November 15th 1855, by his personal exertions and heroic bravery in extinguishing the fire in the roof of a magazine containing 160 tons of powder. He is the inventor of the Shrapnel shell for rifled guns and many other improvements in was material.\n\nPETER LEITCH\n\n(Colour Sergeant)\n\nRoyal Engineers\n\nOn June 18th 1855, during the assault on the Redan, Leitch behaved with great bravery. On approaching it with the leading ladders, he fearlessly tore down the gabions from the parapet, filled them with earth and placed them to form a caponniere across the ditch. In 1854, at Bomarsund, he had been noticed for his conspicuous gallantly, and was awarded the Legion of Honour.\n\nJOHN PERIE\n\n(Sapper)\n\nRoyal Engineers\n\nDecorated for bravery in leading the sailors with the ladders at the storming of the Redan on June 8th 1855, the Gazette stating that his services on that occasion were ?invaluable.? He afterwards rescued a soldier who had been shot and was lying in the open, although having he been wounded by a bullet in the side just previously.\n\nHENRY JAMES RABY\n\n(Commander, Now Rear-Admiral, C.B.)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nThe Victoria Cross was deservedly awarded to this distinguished officer for his humane and brave conduct on June 18th 1855, after the attack on the Redan. A young soldier if the 57th Regiment was lying shot through the legs and exposed to the fire of the Russian batteries. On being informed of this, Commander Raby crossed over the open ground, about one hundred yards, and under a terrific fire carried the wounded man to shelter. They had the assistance of Lieutenant Edward Hughes D?Aeth, of H.M.S. Sidon, but this officer never reaped the reward he undoubtedly merited, as he died of cholera on August 7th following, Taylor, although awarded the V.C., never lived to wear it, for the reason stated in the record under his name, and Curtis died in 1896, so Commander Raby is the only living representative of the heroic act described.\n\nRear-Admiral Raby, son of Mr Arthur Turnour Raby, of Llanelly, Carmarthen, was born September 26th 1827. After being educated at Sherborne School, he entered the Navy in 1842 as 1st Class Volunteer H.M.S. Monarch. Served for eleven months with the Naval Brigade in the Crimea, being promoted Commander for his services. In command H.M.S. Medusa and Alecto, West coast of Africa and during the attack and destruction of Porto Novo; promoted to Captain for meritorious services in those parts, where he was engaged in combating the slave trade, in the suppression of which his name has been prominently associated. Served in command of H.M.S. Adventure in China 1868-71, retiring 1877, since when he was devoted his time to charitable objects connected with the men of that branch of the Service of which he has been so distinguished a member.\n\nJOHN J. SIMS\n\n(Private, afterwards Sergeant)\n\n34th Regiment\n\nDecorated for his bravery on June 18th 1855, when after the regiment had retired from the attack on the Redan, he went out into the open ground, under heavy fire, and brought in several wounded who had fallen outside the trenches.\n\nPHILIP SMITH\n\n(Corporal, afterwards Lance-Sergeant)\n\n17th Regiment\n\nDecorated for his bravery in continually going out under heavy fire, after the column had retired from the assault on the Great Redan, and bringing in wounded soldiers.\n\nJOHN TAYLOR\n\n(Captain of the Forecastle)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nOn June 18th 1855 after the great attack on the Redan, a young soldier of the 57th regiment had been shot through the legs and was lying in a terribly exposed position calling out for help. On their attention being called to the danger he was in, Commander Raby (V.C.), John Taylor, and Henry Curtis (V.C.) climbed over the breastwork of the advanced sap, crossed the one hundred yards of open ground, under terrific fire, and brought him into shelter. Taylor was justly awarded the Victoria Cross, but he never lived to wear the well-earned decoration, for he died on February 24th 1857, the very day on which his name appeared in the Gazette.\n\nCHARLES McCOORIE\n\n(Private)\n\n57th Regiment\n\nDecorated for bravery on June 23rd 1855, when he threw a live shell, which had fallen the trenches, over the parapet.\n\nJOSEPPH TREWAVAS\n\n(Seaman) Royal Navy\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nOn July 3rd 1855, in the straits of Genitchi, the shore being completely lined with the enemy?s troops and the adjacent houses filled with riflemen, Seaman Trewavas (one of the crew of H.M.S. Beagle) went forward under a heavy fire from only eighty yards distance and with great heroism cut the hawsers of the floating bridge. He was hit in the body at the moment of success, but the desired effect was accomplished and a means of conveying stores to the enemy completely destroyed. Lieut. Hewett, then only twenty-one (afterwards Admiral, V.C.), had given orders that the pontoon must be destroyed at all costs. The first attempt was at night, but was unsuccessful. On the return of the party to the ship, Hewett swore it should be done, if not by night, then by day. Under cover of a little paddle steamer with one gun, Trewavas started again n a four-oared boat. The ?paddle steamer? fired one round and then the gun collapsed, remaining useless for the rest of the time. Rowing up to the ?Pontoonm,? Trewavas leapt on to it and the hawswer, the Russians then realising what the little party of British sailors were doing, upon which they opened a terrific fire on them. ?By coolness and pulling for dear life,? says Mr. Trewavas, ?and by the Russians shocking aim we got back to the ship, the boat completely riddled up to the thwarts in water.?\n\nBorn December 14th 1835, Joseph Trewavas joined the Navy, H.M.S. Agamemnon, in 1853. Was at the bombardment of Sebastopol, October 17th 1854, landing on the 23rd with the Naval Brigade. Took part from 1855, in all operations in the Sea of Azoff and was paid off May 22nd 1857. Has been awarded the medal for conspicuous gallantry. Was decorated with French Legion of Honour after Crimean War. Has now for many years followed the calling of a fisherman at Penzance, and at present, in spite of the wounds received from the Russians, is hale and hearty, but advance in years prevents him going to sea as often as before.\n\nGEORGE DARE DOWELL\n\n(Lieutenant, now Lieut. ?Colonel)\n\nRoyal Marine Artillery\n\nAn explosion took place on a rocket boat belonging to the Arrogant at the naval attack on the forts near Viborg on July 13th 1855. Lieutenant Dowell was at the time on board the Ruby. Springing into one of her boats, with three volunteers, he pulled to the assistance of the damaged boat?s crew, the Russians directing a heavy fire of grape and musketry upon them. In spite of this, Lieutenant Dowell rescued three men and took them on to the Ruby, and pulling back to the cutter, kept her afloat until she could be towed into safety.\n\nLieutenant Dowell was born on February 15th 1831, at Chichester, and joined the Royal Marine Artillery on June 25th 1848; was promoted First Lieutenant October 6th 1851; Captain September 22nd 1859; Brevet-Major September 17th 1861; Brevet-Lieut. -Colonel April 23rd 1872. Took part in the action with the Russian batteries at Hangorhead, May 22nd 1854. During the Baltic Expedition 1855, was present at the actions of June 18th, 23rd and 30th, on which latter date thirty vessels were destroyed; at Lovisa July 5th, when the Government houses were burnt; and at the shelling of a Cossack encampment and destruction of their barracks on July 10th and 12th respectively.\n\nGEORGE INGOUEVILLE\n\n(Captain of the Mast)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nOn July 13th 1855, the boats of H.M.S. Arrogant were engaged with the enemy?s gunboats and batteries off Viborg when the second cutter, being disabled by the blowing up of her magazine, commenced to drift under a battery. Despite a wound in the arm, and the terrific fire the boat was under, Ingoueville, without waiting for orders, leapt overboard, caught the cutter?s painter, and saved her. He died on January 13th 1869.\n\nJOHN SHEPPARD\n\n(Boatswain)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nOn July 15th 1855, while serving as Boatswain on the St. Jean d? Acre, Mr Sheppard went in a punt with an exploding apparatus into the harbour of Sebastopol in order to try and blow up a Russian line-of-battle ship. This service, described by Lord Lyons as ?a bold one and gallantly executed,? was twice attempted. On the first occasion he contrived to slip past the Russian steamboats at the entrance to Careening Bay, but was prevented from going further by a long string of boats, which were carrying troops from the south to the north side of Sebastopol.\n\nThe second attempt was made on the following day, from the side of Careening Bay, occupied by the French.\n\nHe died on December 17th 1884.\n\nJOHN ROSS\n\n(Corporal, afterwards Sergeant)\n\nRoyal Engineers\n\nOn July 21st 1855. Corporal Ross displayed great bravery on connecting the 4th Parallel Attack with an old Russian rifle pit in front.\n\nOn August 23rd, when in charge of the advance from the 5th Parallel Right Attack on the Redan, he placed and filled twenty-five gabions under a most severe fire from the Russians.\n\nOn the night of September 8th he crept alone right up to the Redan and found the enemy had evacuated it, upon which he reported to his officer and out troops took possession of it.\n\nFREDERICK COCKAYNE ELTON\n\n(Captain, afterwards Lieut. ?Colonel)\n\n55th (Westmoreland), 2nd Batt.\n\nThe Border Regiment\n\nOn August 4th 1855, Major Elton was with a working party in the trenches, close up to the ?Quarries.? The fire directed at them was terrible, making the work extremely dangerous, but taking a pick and shovel he boldly went into the open and began to work, stimulating by his fine example the men under his command.\n\nSon of the Rev. W. Tierney Elton, he became Ensign on January 19th 1849; Captain, November 1854; Brevet-Major 1855; followed by promotion to Brevet-Lieut. ?Colonel, and Lieut. ?Colonel commanding the 21st Royal Scots in 1866.\n\nJOHN COLEMAN\n\n(Sergeant)\n\n97th Regiment\n\nOn August 30th 1855 the enemy made an attack on a new sap, driving the working party in. Coleman remained in the open, fully exposed to the enemy?s rifle fire, until all around him had been either killed or wounded, finally carrying one of his officers, who had been injured, to the rear.\n\nALFRED ABLETT\n\n(Private)\n\n2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards\n\nOn September 2nd 1855, a shell from the Russian batteries fell among a number of cases containing powder and ammunition. Ablett instantly seized it and flung it over the trench, whereupon it exploded. By his quick and courageous action, he saved the lives of all around him. Besides the Victoria Cross he was awarded the medal of Distinguished Conduct in the Field. He afterwards held the appointment of Inspector of Police, Millwall Docks, London, and died in February, 1897. His Victoria Cross was sold in London on March 20th 1903, for ?62\n\nJAMES CRAIG\n\n(Ensign and Adjutant)\n\n3rd Battalion Military Train\n\nFormerly Sergeant, Scots Fusiliers Guards\n\nOn the night of September 6th 1855, when in the right advanced sap, in front of the Redan, Craig volunteered and collected other volunteers to go out under a heavy fire of grape and small arms to look for Captain Buckley, Scots Fusilier Guards, supposed at the time to be only wounded. With the assistance of a drummer, he brought in the body of that officer-whom he found dead and while occupied in this action was himself badly wounded.\n\nGEORGE STRONG\n\n(Private)\n\n1st Battalion Coldstream Guards\n\nWhen on duty in the trenches, in September 1855, Private Strong picked up, and threw aside, a live shell, which had fallen among the men.\n\nDANIEL CAMBRIDGE\n\n(Sergeant)\n\nRoyal Artillery\n\nAt the result on the Redan, September 8th 1855, Cambridge volunteered for the spiking-party, and though severely wounded continued inn the dangerous task. Later in the day he went out in front of the advanced trench and brought in a wounded man under very heavy fire, during which service he was himself badly injured for the second time.\n\nJOHN CONNORS\n\n(Private)\n\n3rd Regiment\n\nOn September 8th 1855, during the assault on the Redan, Connors displayed great courage in personal conflict with the Russians. He also rescued an officer of the 30th Regiment who was surrounded by the enemy, one of whom he shot, and bayoneted another, and inside the Redan was noticed in personal combat for some time with the enemy. Selected by his comrades to receive the French War Medal.\n\nGRONOW DAVIS\n\n(Captain, afterwards Major General)\n\nRoyal Artillery\n\nOn September 8th 1855, at the attack on the Redan, Captain Davis was in command of the Spiking party, carrying out his dangerous duty with conspicuous coolness and bravery. Shortly afterwards he saw that Lieutenant Sanders 30th Regiment, was lying wounded, his leg being broken. Without hesitation he sprang over the parapet, twice crossing the open space swept by a murderous fire, and, procuring help, at length succeeded in carrying him to shelter. After this brave and humane action, he returned to the Redan and removed action, he returned to the Redan and removed several injured and dying men to places of comparative safety.\n\nCaptain Davis, son of Dr. Davis, at one time house physician at St. Peter?s Hospital, was born at Bristol May 16th 1828. Educated by Mr. Exley, of Cotham, and at Bishop?s College (a school with preceded Clifton college), he passed direct into the Royal Academy, Woolwich, joining the royal Artillery, June 1847; became Lieutenant1848; Captain 1855; Major 1857; Lieut. ?Colonel 1868; Colonel 1876, Major General 1881. Served through the Crimean War from July 6th 1855, including the siege and fall of Sebastopol and battle of Tchernaya, obtaining medal and clasp, 5th class Medjidie, Turkish Medal, and Brevet of Major. For five years was Inspector of the Auxiliary Forces of the Western District, and represented the Council of the Primrose League for many years at Clifton, where he died on October 18th 1891.\n\nTJOMAS EGERRTON HALE, M.D.\n\n(Assistant Surgeon, now Surgeon-Major, Retired)\n\n7th the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)\n\nOn September 8th 1855, Captain H. M. Jones (V.C.) 7th Regiment, had been severely wounded, and the men in the immediate vicinity had all retired expecting Surgeon Hale and Lieutenant W. Hope (V.C.) Hale, however, remained with the wounded officer and afterwards was conspicuous for his attempts to rally the men, assisted also Lieutenant Hope. On the same day when the soldiers had retreated into the trenches, surgeon Hale carried several wounded men from the open to the shelter of a sap, being under a very heavy fire during the entire time. Sergeant Charles Fisher of the same regiment nobly assisted him in his humane action. Born in 1832, Surgeon-Major Hale is the son of Mr. George P. Hale of Faddiley, near Nanwitch. He entered the army in 1854, and after the Crimean War served through the Indian Mutiny, 1857-9\n\nCHARLES HENRY LUMLEY\n\n(Brevet-Major)\n\n97th Regiment\n\nOn September 8th 1855, at the assault on the Redan, Major Lumley greatly distinguished himself, being one of the first to gain the inside of the work. He at once attacked three Russian gunners who were reloading a field-piece, shot two of them with his revolver, and was himself stunned by a large stone, but recovering quickly he drew his sword and cheered on his men, and while doing so was hit by a bullet in the mouth and most severely wounded.\n\nFREDERICK FRANCIS MAUDE\n\n(Major, afterwards General, G.C.B.)\n\n3rd Buffs (East Kent Regiment)\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nWhen in command of the covering party of the 2nd division, Major Maulde, with only nine or ten of his men, all the rest is having fallen and he himself being severely wounded, dashed for a traverse, which he held, and only retired when all hope of support was at an end.\n\nFrederick Francis Maude, born December 20th 1821, died at Torquay on June 20th 1897; was the son of the Rev. Honourable J. C. Maude. In 1861 was A.A.G. at Gibraltar; commanded a division in India 1875-80, and the 2nd of the Khyber Force during the Afghan War, 1878-9. Retired 1885.\n\nANDREW MOYNIHAN\n\n(Sergeant 90th Regiment, afterwards Ensign 8th Regiment)\n\nAt the attack on the Redan, September 8tth 1855, Moynihan, then a sergeant in the 90th Light Infantry, displayed great bravery. He himself attacked five Russians and killed everyone. Afterwards under a heavy fire he rescued a wounded officer who had fallen near the Redan.\n\nHe died at Malta in 1866.\n\nROBERT SHIELDS\n\n(Corporal)\n\n23rd Regiment\n\nOn September 8th 1855 after the attack on the Redan, Shields volunteered to go out the front from the 5th Parallel, to bring in Lieutenant Dyneley, who had fallen wounded-mortally as it afterwards proved.\n\nWILLIAM HENRY THOMAS SYLVESTER\n\n(Assistant Surgeon, Now M.D,. L.R.C.S. Edin, L.S.A., retired)\n\n23rd Regiment\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nOn September 8th 1855, under a terrific fire, Surgeon Sylvester went out near the Redan, to where Lieutenant Dyneley was lying mortally wounded, and attended to him in that exposed and dangerous position. He was also specially mentioned in General Sir James Simpson?s despatch of September 18th 1855, for going to the front and attending to many wounded under very severe fire.\n\nHe served in the Indian Mutiny and took part in the Relief of Lucknow 1857-8.\n\nJOSEPH KELLAWAY\n\n(Boatswain)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nIn September 1855 in the sea of Azoff, near Mariopol, a small party from H.M.S. Wrangler landed in the middle of the night to destroy some boats, fishing stations, and haystacks, on the opposite side of a lake. The Russians were on the alert, and rushed upon them from their ambush, endeavouring to cut off their retreat. One of our men fell into the enemy?s hands, and the others had made good their escape, when one of them (Mr. Odevaine) accidentally fell.\n\nKellaway, thinking he was wounded, at once returned to his rescue, and while lifting him, both were surrounded by the enemy. In spite of a gallant but hopeless resistance, they were captured.\n\nCommander Burgoyne V.C. stated that he was himself an observer of the zeal, gallantry, and self-devotion displayed by Kellaway on this occasion.\n\nMr. Kellaway died at Chatham on October 10th 1880.\n\nGEORGE FIOTT DAY\n\n(Captain, afterwards C.B)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nDuring the Crimean War, in the sea of Azoff, Captain Day conceived the idea of landing at night, getting within the Russian lines at Genitchi and finding out the practicability of cutting out the enemy?s gunboats lying within the Straits, close to the town. Setting off quite alone, he landed and crossed four or five miles of swamps, often waist deep, penetrating eventually to within 200 yards of the enemy?s vessels. From the absolute stillness on board the boats he came to the conclusion that they were not strongly manned, and that therefore an expedition for the purpose of cutting them out was feasible. Retracing his steps, after seven hours hard work, he reached his ship. Next day, however, from unusual signs of activity in the enemy?s direction, it seemed that the surmises were incorrect, so he returned once more to again watch their movements.\n\nPassing through the same dangerous swamps, he reached his former place of observation and found, to his great disappointment, that the boats were all manned and ready for action, so he turned back, wandering through the swamps again for nine hours, and the idea had to be abandoned. The plucky nature of this act is the more apparent when it is mentioned that, while making a similar reconnaissance previously, Captain l?Allemand, of the French steamer Monette, had lost his life. The decoration worn by Captain Day in the portrait above is: - St. Jean d?Acre-Syria 1840; China 1841; Burmah 1852; South Africa 1853; Baltic 1854; Crimean and Turkish 1855; Victoria Cross; Legion of Honour; Order of the Bath (C.B.) and Medjidie. Promoted Commander, 1855; Captain 1861; he died at Weston-super-Mare, December 18th 1876.\n\nCHRISTOPHER CHARLES TEESDALE\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Major General, K.C.M.G.)\n\nRoyal Artillery\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nOn September 29th 1855, when acting as A.D.C. to Sir William Fenwick Williams, Bart., K.C.B., at Kars, Lieutenant Teesdale volunteered to take command of the force placed to defend the most advanced part of the works the key of the position-against the attack of the Russian army.\n\nThe enemy had forced their way into the redoubt, whereupon he flung himself into their midst, and so encouraged the garrison by his splendid example, that, after a hard struggle, the Russians were driven out and the position saved from capture. During the crisis of the action, when the fury of the Russian fire was such that the Turkish artillerymen were driven from the guns, he rallied them, and, by his gallant conduct and leading, induced them to return to their post. He led the final charge, which completed the victory for the day, and afterwards, at a terrible risk to himself, flung himself among several infuriated Turkish soldiers and prevented them from killing wounded Russians lying outside the works. This marvellous act of humanity and courage was witnessed, and gratefully acknowledged, by the Russian Commander, General Mouravieff.\n\nSon of Lieut. ?General H. G. Teesdale, he was born on June 1st 1883, entered the Royal Artillery 1851, and served as A.D.C. to Sir Fenwick Williams, at Kars and Erzeroun, in 1854. Was also Colonel in the Turkish army and received the second class Medjidie. Had been, since 1890, Master of the Ceremonies to the Queen. He entered the army in 1851, becoming Captain 188; Brevet-Major 1858; Major 1862; Lieut. ?Colonel 1868; colonel 1877; and attained the rank of Major General on April 22nd 1887. He died at Bognor on November 1st 1893.\n\nJOHN EDMUND COMMERELL\n\n(Commander, afterwards Admiral of the Fleet G.C.B.)\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nKnight of the Legion of Honour\n\nOn the night of October 11th 1855, Commander Commerell, accompanied by Quartermaster William Rickard and Seaman George Milestone, landed and destroyed 400 tons of corn and forage belonging to the Russians. He was at the time Commander of the Weser, in the sea of Azoff. The three men, waiting until darkness could cover their movements, rowed ashore and hauled their small boat across the Spit of Arabat, then traversed the Sivash to the Crimean shore of the Putrid Sea. In order to reach the magazine of corn, which lay distant about two and a half miles, they had to ford the Kara-su and Salghir Rivers, and, creeping to the stacks, they contrived to ignite them. The flames from the burning forage roused the Cossacks, of whom there was a guard of thirty in the vicinity, and these the three intrepid sailors to the shore. However, in spite of the heavy rifle-fire directed at them, they managed to escape and rejoin their ship.\n\nAdmiral Sir Edmund Commerell, son of the late J. W. Commerell, of Horseham, was borne January 13th 1829, and died at Rutland Gate, Hyde Park on May 21st 1901.\n\nHe served in South America 1846, the Baltic in 1854, and after the Crimean War, in China 1859-60, and Ashanti 1873, in which campaign he was dangerously wounded. A.D.C. to the Queen 1872-6; Naval Lord of the Admiralty; Commander-in-Chief on American and West Indian stations 1882; Portsmouth 1888; Admiral of the Fleet 1892; M.P. for Southampton, 1885-8.\n\nWILLIAM RICKARD\n\n(Quartermaster, Royal Navy, now Chief Officer of Coast Guard, Knight of the Legion of Honour)\n\nOn October 11th 1855, Quartermaster Rickard accompanied Lieutenant Commerell, V.C., commander of the Weser, to the Crimean shore of the Sivash, and his officer, in the following despatch, brought his gallant conduct on that occasion to the notice of the authorities.\n\n?I must bring to your notice the excellent conduct of the small party who accompanied me, more especially that of William Rickard, Quartermaster, who, though much fatigued himself, remained to assist the other seaman (George Milestone), who from exhaustion had fallen in the mud and was unable to extricate himself, notwithstanding the enemy were keeping up a heavy fire on us at the distance of thirty or forty yards as we crossed the mud.?\n\nTHE PERSIAN WAR\n\n1856-1857\n\nJOHN AUGUSTUS WOOD\n\n(Captains, afterwards Colonel)\n\n20th Bombay Native Infantry\n\nAt Bushire, Persia on December 9th 1856, Captain Wood led the Grenadier Company, which formed the head of the assaulting column. He sprang on the parapet of the fort, being the first to reach it, and was instantly attacked by a number of the enemy. They fired a volley when only a yard distant from him, and, although hit by seven bullets, he flung himself upon the enemy, killed their leader with his sword, and with his own company, who were following close behind him, routed the enemy, and took their position. His decision, energy, and determined valour, undoubtedly (to use the words of the Gazette) contributed in a high degree to the success of the attack. His wounds compelled him to leave the force for a time, but, with the pluck and spirit of a good soldier, he rejoined his regiment, and returned to his duty at Bushire before the wounds were properly healed.\n\nCaptain Wood joined the army in 1839 and saw service in the Afghan War of 1842.\n\nARTHUR THOMAS MOORE\n\n(Lieutenant and Adjutant, now Major-General C.B.)\n\n3rd Bombay Light Cavalry\n\nOn February 8th 1857, at the battle of Khoosh-ab, Persia, Lieutenant Moore charged an infantry square at the head of his regiment, jumping his horse over the bayonets of the enemy, a feat perhaps never accomplished before. His Charger fell dead, pinning him to the ground. Extricating him with great difficulty, he attempted to cut his way through the press, but, his sword being broken by the fall, he could barely defend himself and would certainly have been killed but for the prompt assistance of Lieutenant Malcolmson, whose record will be found below.\n\nGeneral Moore was born on September 20th 1830, entered the Army in 1850, serving in the Persian War 1857, and the Indian Mutiny 1857, being mentioned in despatches in the latter campaign. Was afterwards through the operations in Central India under Sir Hugh Rose.\n\nJOHN GRANT MALCOLMSON\n\n(Lieutenant, afterwards Captain)\n\n3rd Bombay Light Cavalry\n\nAt the battle of Khoosh-ab, on February 8th 1857, Lieutenant Malcolmson, seeing that Lieutenant and Adjutant Moore, V.C. (to whose heroic act we have referred above) was surrounded by a crowd of the enemy and practically unarmed, his sword being broken, cut his way through the mass of fighting Persians, and, giving his stirrup to his brother officer, succeeded in conveying him to a place of safety. But not his gallant conduct, Lieutenant Moore must have been killed. The Gazette states that the thoughtfulness for others, cool determination, devoted courage and ready activity shown in a moment of extreme danger by Lieutenant Malcolmson, appear to have been most admirable, rendering him worthy of the higher honour.\n\nCaptain Malcolmson, M.V.O., son of the late James Malcolmson, of Muchrach, Inverness-shire, was born in 1835. Present at the capture of Reshire and surrender of Bushire in the Persian War; through the Indian Mutiny 1857, and took part in the Central India operations, from the siege of Ratghur to the fall of Calpee. Was, from 1870 one of Her Majesty Queen Victoria?s Gentlemen-at-Arms. He died on August 14th 1902.\n\nTHE INDIAN MUTINY\n\n1857-1859\n\n(Including Okamundel and Kattywar-October 1859)\n\nGEORGE FORREST\n\n(Lieutenant)\n\nWILLIAM RAYNOR\n\n(Lieutenant)\n\nJOHN BUCKLEY\n\n(Conductor)\n\nBengal Ordnance\n\nThe troubles times of the Indian Mutiny brought to light many examples of bravery, devotion and self-sacrifice, but it was left to a little band of nine resolute men to perform the act which, of all the heroic ones of those days, will be the last to be obliterated by the hand of time. On May 11th 1857, the great Delhi Magazine, full of enormous stores of warlike material, was in charge of Lieutenant George Willoughby, Bengal Artillery, and with him were Lieutenants Forrest and Raynor, and six European soldiers. In the early hours of that day Willoughby was in the magazine when Forrest arrived with the Magistrate, Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, and informed him that the mutineers had crossed the river and entered the palace gates. Knowing well the value of the magazine to the enemy should they contrive to storm and take it, and how much to our cause could he but hold it, Willoughby resolved to defend it to the last, always with the hope that our troops at Meerut would soon arrive to his relief. There were many natives of the establishment of the magazine, but the officer saw they were not to be trusted, and he formed the heroic resolution with his eight British comrades to defend the magazine as long as possible against the enormous odds and then at last, when overpowered, to blow the building into the air with all its inflammable contents and themselves to die at their posts.\n\nTe gates were closed and barricaded, and guns were brought out, loaded with grape shot and placed so as to command the entrances. Should the enemy force their way in through these channels, their ranks would be torn to pieces by the point blank fire of the six pounders, and then if the little band should be overpowered, at a signal-pre-concerted by Willoughby- the entire place was to be blown up and any within its walls would perish. To this end a train of powder was laid from the outside to the magazine, Scully, with heroic resolution, undertaking the firing of the train, this duty making death a certainty for him should the signal be given.\n\nShortly afterwards a summons was brought from the King of Delhi, ordering the surrender of the magazine. Contemptuous silence was the only reply given, upon which the enemy, bringing ladders, commented to scale of the walls, the natives in the establishment promptly joining their friends the attackers. Thus the resolute nine, left alone, faced Death with fearless hearts, and soon the guns sent volleys of grape into the midst of the storming parties. Gun after gun fired its rounds, served coolly and steadily, the heroic gunners under a hail of bullets from those of the enemy who had now scaled the walls. After a while the supply of ammunition brought up from the magazine began to give out, and it was impossible for more to be fetched, no one being able to leave the guns for that purpose. Two of the gallant nine were wounded and the rebels were forcing their way in now every side, so, true to his intention, and to his country?s cause, Willoughby raised his hat-the signal arranged-John Scully applied the port-fire to the train and with an appalling explosion, the magazine was blown into the air, more than one thousand mutineers being killed. Of the nine heroic men, only four escaped; Willoughby and Forrest joined a party of Europeans at the Main Guard in Delhi as to be almost unrecognisable; the former being shortly afterwards in an encounter with the mutineers. Raynor and Buckley, taking different directions, eventually reached Meerut in safety. The splendour of this achievement, the nobility of heart of those who deliberately offered their lives in the furtherance of their country?s cause, makes the Victoria Cross almost an insufficient reward. But, added to that decoration, and to perpetuate the memory of the heroic lives given for such a cause, a memorial tablet was placed over the gate of the old magazine with the following inscription-\n\nOn May 11th 1857\n\nNine Resolute Englishmen,\n\nLt. Geo. Dorbree Willoughby, Bengal Artillery,\n\nIn Command\n\nLieutenant William Raynor. Lieutenant Geo. Forrest,\n\nConductor G. William Shaw, Conductor John Buckley,\n\nConductor John Scully, Sub-Conductor William Crow,\n\nSergeant Bryan Edwards, Sergeant Peter Stewart\n\nDefended the magazine of Delhi for more than four hours against large numbers of the rebels and mutineers, until the walls being scaled, and all hope of succour gone, these brave men fired the magazine. Five of the gallant band perished in the explosion, which at the same time destroyed many of the enemy.\n\nThis Tablet\n\nMarking the former entrance gate to the magazine, is placed here by the Government of India.\n\nPETER GILL\n\n(Sergeant Major)\n\nLoodiana Regiment\n\nOn June 4th 1857, Sergeant-Major Peter Gill was at Benares, and the mutineers were firing the bungalows and killing the European inhabitants round that station. In company with Sergeant-Major Rosamond (V.C.) he made his way to the residence of Captain Brown and his family, who were in great peril and cut off from their friends, and by his noble exertions succeeded in bringing them all safely within the lines. He also saved the life of a sergeant of the 25th Bengal Native Infantry, who, having been bayoneted, was about to receive the coup de grace, when Gill hewed off the head of his assailant. On the same evening, with only a sergeant?s sword, he faced a guard of twenty-seven mutineers, and twice saved the life of Major Barrett, 27th Regiment, when that officer was attacked and in great danger of being overpowered.\n\nJOHN KIRK\n\n(Private)\n\n10th Regiment\n\nOn June 4th 1857, this soldier was associated with Sergeant-Major Rosamond (V.C.) and Gill (V.C.). When, on the outbreak at Benares the mutineers fired the bungalow and massacred so many Europeans, he and his comrades were able to rescue Captain Brown and his family, bringing them into the lines in safety. His Victoria Cross is in the United Service Institute, London.\n\nM. ROSAMOND\n\n(Sergeant Major)\n\n37th Bengal Native Infantry\n\nOn June 4th 1857, at Benares, Rosamond volunteered with Lieut. ?Colonel Spottiswoode, his commanding officer, to set fire to the Sepoy lines so as to drive out the enemy. He also accompanied Sergeant-Major Gill (V.C.) and Private Kirk (V.C.) when they rescued Captain Brown and his family from their bungalow, which the Sepoys had set on fire. His conduct was specially noted as ?meritorious? and he was promoted. His Cross-was sold in London on November 25th 1903 for ?54.\n\nCORNELIUS COGHLAN\n\n(Colour-Sergeant, afterwards Sergeant Major)\n\n75th (Stirlingshire) Regiment (Now 1st Battalion The Gordon Highlanders)\n\nDuring the siege of Delhi, Sergeant Coghlan became conspicuous by his numerous acts of bravery. On June 8th 1857 at Budle-Ke-Serai, under a heavy fire, he entered a building held by the rebels in great force, and rescued from it Private Corbett, of his regiment, who was severely wounded. On July 18th 1857 he cheered and encouraged a party, which showed signs of hesitation in charging into a lane, which was filled with armed mutineers, not one of whom escaped. He then returned to procure dgoolies for the wounded, being the whole time exposed to a heavy crossfire. In this he also succeeded, receiving on the spot public praise from his officers for his chivalrous conduct.\n\nHe was, until a few years ago, Sergeant Major of a Militia Battalion in Co. Mayo, Ireland.\n\nALFRED STOWELL JONES\n\n(Lieutenant, now Lieut-Colonel)\n\n9th (Queen?s Royal) Lancers\n\nOn June 8th 1857, at Budle-K-Serai, Delhi, the squadron commanded by Lieutenant Jones charged the rebels and, although they offered a stout resistance, rode straight through them, killing the drivers, and capturing one of their guns. With the assistance of Colonel Yule, he turned it upon a village, strongly held by the mutineers, and drove them out. Sir Hope Grant stated in his despatch that nothing could have been better done or more gallantly executed. At Agra, on October 10th following, Lieutenant Jones received no fewer than twenty-two wounds, part of his head being cut away, and one eye destroyed, in spite of which he recovered.\n\nBorn at Liverpool, January 24th 1832, Lieut. ?Colonel Jones is the son of the late Archdeacon Jones. Educated at Liverpool College and Staff College, Sandhurst, he entered the 9th Lancers in 1852. Throughout the siege of Delhi served as D.A.Q.M.G. to the cavalry, being there three times mentioned in despatches, and promoted Captain and Brevet-Major.\n\nGraduated at the Staff College 1861, served on the Staff at the Cape, 1861-7, retiring 1872.\n\nH. HARTIGAN\n\n(Sergeant)\n\n9th Lancers\n\nAt the battle of Budle-Ke-Serai, near Delhi, on June 8th 1857, Hartigan performed an act of special daring and devotion. During a particularly severe charge, Sergeant Helstone was wounded and fell from his horse, being quickly surrounded by the fanatical enemy. At the risk of his own life Hartigan cut his way through the press and carried his wounded comrade to the rear.\n\nOn October 10th following at Agra, under circumstances of great bravery, he saved the life of Sergeant Crews, who was attacked by four rebels (who had crept into the camp), and though quite unarmed, Hartigan dashed for the nearest, wrenched a tulwar from his hand, hitting him a blow in the mouth with his fist, then turned and attacked the other three, one of whom he killed, and wounded the two remaining. He was, however, by that time so terribly wounded himself, that he was unable to continue the combat, and was obliged to retire on assistance arriving.\n\nTHOMAS CADELL\n\n(Lieutenant, now Colonel, I.S.C.)\n\n2nd Bengal Fusiliers (Late 104th Foot) The Royal Munster Fusiliers\n\nThe flagstaff on the historic ?Ridge? at Delhi was often a point of attack by the enemy when they attempted a sortie, as well as by their friends outside in their many efforts to raise the siege. On June 12th 1857, a vigorous attack was made, and the pickets of the 75th and of the Bengal European Fusiliers were forced to retire before overwhelming numbers. Lieutenant Cadell, seeing a bugler fall severely wounded, went to his assistance and, carrying him from among the enemy under a heavy fire, saved him from certain death. Again, on the same evening, when his regiment was ordered to retire on Metcalfe?s house, learning that a wounded man of the 75th was left behind, he immediately went back towards the advancing mutineers, taking with him three men, and brought him in. This act of devotion he and his men accomplished under a terrible fire of cannon and musketry.\n\nColonel Cadell, V.C., son of the late H. F. Cadell, of Cockenzie, Haddingtonshire, and a younger brother of the late General Sir Robert Cadell, K.C.B., was born on September 5th 1835. Educated at Edinburgh Academy; Grange, Sunderland; and abroad. He held various political appointments in India. From 1879 to 1892 was Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nTHOMAS HANCOCK\n\n(Private)\n\n9th Lancers\n\nthis gallant soldier was specially mentioned by Sir Hope Grant, in command of the Field Force, for his courageous conduct on June 19th 1857. When that brave leader?s horse was shot under him at Delhi, Hancock remained by him and giving him his own mount, enabled him to be taken out of the hot corner the cavalry were in at the time. With him were Private Purcell (V.C.) and a Sowar, Roopur Khan. The former was awarded the chief of decoration, but the Sowar?s name unfortunately does not figure in the list of recipients.\n\nJOHN PURCELL\n\n(Private)\n\n9th Lancers\n\nAt Delhi, June 19th 1857, Purcell, with another brave lancer, Thomas Hancock (V.C.) and Sowar Roopur Khan, saved the life of Sir Hope Grant, by staying with him, offering him one of their horses, and getting him out of the melee when surrounded by rebel cavalry. Purcel?s horse was killed in the contest.\n\nSAMUEL TURNER\n\n(Private)\n\n1st Battalion 60th Rifles\n\nOn June 19th 1857 when before Delhi, Lieutenant Humphrey?s, of the Indian Service, was mortally wounded, and had he been allowed to remain where he fell, he would have mutilated beyond recognition, a fate unfortunately too often met by many another soldier during that terrible time. Turner carried him to the rear on his shoulders under a brisk fire from the enemy posted around, and, at one time, even at close quarters. During his humane act he was severely wounded by a sabre cut.\n\nSTEPHEN GARVIN\n\n(Colour-Sergeant)\n\n1st Battalion. 60th Rifles\n\nBesides being brought in prominent notice for his gallant conduct during the entire operations before Delhi, Garvin was specially noticed for his bravery on June 23rd 1857, when he; led a little party of men under a terrific fire to assault the ?Sammy House,? a well-defended post which gave particular trouble to our advancing troops. After a sharp contest this hostile post was captured, chiefly by his "
