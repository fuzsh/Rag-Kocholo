The original Maniac Cop sets up the story for this killer sequel. In that film officer Matt Cordell was set up and executed by a bunch of corrupt New York cops. He escapes death to take his vengeance on the boys in blue. In this second part of the story he does all that and more. Maniac Cop 2 triples the body count of its predecessor, has daring police chases, nudity, Bruce Campbell, more nudity, and more minutes of full body burns than any other film."
