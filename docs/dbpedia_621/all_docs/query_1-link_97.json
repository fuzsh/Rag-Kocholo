        "text": "The invasion of Iraq led to the deaths of 179 British personnel between March 2003 and February 2009.\n\nTony Blair told the Chilcot Inquiry into the conflict he had \"deep and profound regret\" about the loss of life suffered by British troops and Iraqi civilians.\n\nCaptain Philip Guy\n\nRoyal Marines\n\nDied: 21 March 2003\n\nA 29-year-old husband and father, Philip came from Skipton, North Yorkshire. He was killed just hours after the attack on Iraq began, in a helicopter crash that also claimed the lives of seven other men from 3 Commando Brigade (all remembered below). Captain Guy died two weeks before his wife Helen was due to give birth to their second child. She described him as \"the most brave, courageous man you could ever imagine\" and a \"perfect, loving, special husband\". He had joined the Royal Marines after graduating from Salford university in 1995, and had served in Bosnia and Afghanistan. He had been in the Gulf for six weeks. A keen sportsman, he represented his Corps in long-distance running. His fellow officers had nominated him for a Marine medal for courage and selflessness.\n\nMajor Jason Ward\n\nRoyal Marines\n\nDied: 21 March 2003\n\nDescribed as \"an exceptional leader\" by his colleagues, Jason, aged 34, had been a UN peacekeeper in Cambodia and had served in Bosnia and Northern Ireland.\n\nHis childhood ambition was to be a Royal Marine, and he served in the corps for 15 years. He was renowned for always being among the first to volunteer for any task, and for boldly leading his men into battle from the front.\n\nVery close to his family – his mother Jaqueline, his father George, a retired businessman, and his younger brother Elliot – he wrote to his parents a week before he died: \"I am genuinely very well. I really want you both to know that. I am not putting up a brave face. All is good out here... Obviously I have no idea how long we are going to stay, but I guess I'll be back mid-May, hopefully the 5th, because I will stand to win nearly 50 bottles of champagne. The quartermaster and I are running a book on it.\"\n\nColour Sergeant John Cecil\n\nRoyal Marines\n\nDied: 21 March 2003\n\nAged 35, and from Newcastle upon Tyne, John was \"proud to be a Royal Marine, proud to be British and proud to represent his country\", according to his family. \"John leaves behind a great many friends and relatives,\" said a statement issued at the time, \"and our thoughts and prayers go out to Wendy Cecil, his children Nicholas and Jodie, his beloved daughter Paige, and his brother David.\"\n\nLance Bombardier Llywelyn Evans\n\n29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery\n\nDied: 21 March 2003\n\nNicknamed \"Welly\", Llywelyn was 24 and came from Llandudno. He had been in the army since 1996 and had served in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. He was engaged to Miss Rebecca Williams. His father, Gordon Evans, said: \"On behalf of my whole family, I wish to say that we are all devastated by the loss of our son. Whilst we are deeply saddened, we are, and always will be, proud of him.\"\n\nMarine Sholto Hedenskog\n\nRoyal Marines\n\nDied: 21 March 2003\n\nA university graduate from Cape Town, South Africa, Sholto had abandoned further study to realise a lifelong ambition to serve with the Marines, whom he joined in 2000 and with whom he served in Afghanistan in the search for al-Qa'ida fighters in the caves of Tora Bora. Nicknamed \"Sonic\" by his colleagues – because his name sounded vaguely like \"hedgehog\" – he had last been home in December 2002, on leave after his tour of duty in Afghanistan. His cousin, Sean, said: \"He was totally dedicated. After becoming a marine, he became so strong and confident. He loved it. He knew the dangers involved.\"\n\nHe was due to be best man at the July 2003 wedding of Craig Garnett, his best friend in 3 Commando Brigade. They had joined up together and were due to leave the marines the following year. He is survived by his mother and two sisters, Megan and Eva, who live in Cape Town. He was 26.\n\nSergeant Les Hehir\n\n29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery\n\nDied: 21 March 2003\n\nLes, from Poole, Dorset, was 34. He and his wife Sharon had two sons: Oliver (then five) and William (then three). Mrs Hehir said Les's death was \"the worst blow imaginable\". She added: \"In addition to being an outstanding and highly regarded soldier, Les was an extremely loving and devoted husband, father and son. The loss we feel is really too much to bear. We lived for each other and our two wonderful boys.\"\n\nOperator Mechanic Ian Seymour RN\n\n148 Commando Battery, Royal Artillery\n\nDied: 21 March 2003\n\nAlso from Poole, Operator Mechanic (Communications) Second Class Ian Seymour RN was 28 years old. Married to Lianne, 27, and with a young son, Beck (then aged three), he was the first British victim of the war to be buried. The funeral, on April 9, followed a service at St Michael's Church, Hamworthy, Poole, and was conducted with full military honours.\n\nAmong the flowers and tributes left at the Plymouth headquarters of 3 Commando Brigade was one from his wife and son. The note, pinned to a photo of them, read: \"For my Daddy. I love you loads. So does Mummy. We will miss you always. God bless you. Lots of love from your Baby Bear and Tinkerbell.\"\n\nWarrant Officer Mark Stratford\n\nRoyal Marines\n\nDied: 21 March 2003\n\nAged 39, and from Plymouth, Warrant Officer Second Class Mark Stratford completes the list of victims of that first helicopter crash. His family said: \"The Royal Marines were Mark's life and he was dedicated to the regiment. He served in many areas of the world and we know that he thoroughly enjoyed his 20 years with the corps. He had a wonderful life.\"\n\nLieutenant Marc Lawrence\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nDied: 22 March 2003\n\nAged 26, Marc was one of six British victims of a second tragic crash, between two Royal Navy Sea King helicopters over the northern Arabian Gulf. The others are remembered below.\n\nMarc grew up in Westgate-on-Sea, Kent, the son of George and Ann. From an early age he loved the sea and was a keen sailor, diver and windsurfer. After officer training at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, he trained as a Sea King Observer at Culdrose, gained his wings in 2002, and joined 849 Squadron. That same year, he also became engaged: to Elaine Cleaver, also from Kent. They had planned to marry in 2004 and make their home in Cornwall.\n\nAn accomplished musician, Marc played in the ship's band on board HMS Ark Royal. His sister Jayne described her brother as a \"happy man with a ready smile\". \"He stole our hearts,\" said his fiancee Elaine.\n\nLieutenant Philip West\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nDied: 22 March 2003\n\nAged 32, Philip was 6ft 4in tall and was known throughout 849 Squadron as \"Stretch\". He was brought up in Carlisle but moved with his family to Hoylake on the Wirral when he was 10. In later life he lived in Budock Water, Cornwall, with his fiancee, Nicky.\n\nAccording to his parents, Philip always wanted to fly. After Salford university he did officer training at Dartmouth, and he gained his wings in 1994. His parents said that his decision to join the service made them immensely proud. During the Balkan conflict he served in HMS Invincible in the Adriatic and was awarded the campaign medal.\n\nHe and Nicky – a nurse whom he had met when he was serving at Culdrose Air Station – were converting a barn together, and were looking forward to their wedding. They were due to be married in August 2003.\n\nLieutenant Andrew Wilson\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nDied: 22 March 2003\n\nAged 36, Andrew was married and came from Exeter. His wife Sarah said that she was devastated and saddened by her tragic loss, but intensely proud of her husband's commitment to the Royal Navy. She described Andrew as an extremely kind and outgoing person who would be greatly missed by his family, his squadron colleagues and by the wider naval aviation community.\n\nFellow aircrew on 849 Squadron – in which Andrew had served for the past three years – said that he had been a powerful personality within the squadron and an outstanding pilot.\n\nLieutenant Philip Green\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nDied: 22 March 2003\n\nBorn in North Walsham, Norfolk, Philip learnt to fly with Oxford University Air Squadron while studying geology at Oxford Brookes University. He joined the Navy in April 1996, and by early 2000 he had completed Anti- Submarine Warfare training on Sea King helicopters. He joined 849 Squadron in May 2002. His flying skills had won him \"green rated\" status – the highest possible.\n\nAged 30 at the time of his death, he was from Frieston, Lincolnshire. His family – his parents, Richard and Karen, and his sisters, Juliet and Catherine – say they miss Philip terribly, and remember his gentle, easy manner and dry sense of humour. Philip also loved spending time in Scotland with his girlfriend Louise Cameron and her family in Ayrshire.\n\nPhilip loved the outdoors, keeping fit and walking on Caythorpe heath with his greatest and most devoted admirer, the family's springer spaniel, Sam. Every year, in memory of Philip, a shield is presented by North West English Springer Spaniel Rescue to a rescued dog that has shown extreme bravery in the face of life's adversities.\n\nLieutenant Antony King\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nDied: 22 March 2003\n\nBrought up in North Somerset, Antony joined the Royal Navy in 1987 at the age of 19. At the time of his death – aged 35 – he had recently been selected for promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Described as a \"committed family man\" who valued his family and close friends above all else, he lived in Helston, Cornwall, with his wife Sarah and children David (then five) and Molly (then four).\n\nHis family described him as a \"larger than life\" character with a \"tremendous presence\". He had a passion for rugby and had played for Stithians RFC. He was awarded a posthumous mention in dispatches in recognition of the vital work he had done in bringing into service a new battlefield communications system.\n\nLieutenant James Williams\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nDied: 22 March 2003\n\nAged 28 at the time of his death, James was the son of Vernon and Liz Williams. He grew up in Winchester with his older sister Caroline and was fascinated by aircraft from boyhood. While a student at Liverpool University he met his fiancee Sarah, with whom he later moved to Falmouth. He joined the Royal Navy in January 1999 and 849 Squadron's A Flight in 2003. The Iraq campaign was his first operational tour of duty.\n\nA popular character in the squadron, he joined the Navy in fulfilment of an ambition to fly, and to serve his country. His parents recalled how proud he was to wear his uniform, and said that he died doing the job he loved most.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Kevin Main & Flight Lieutenant David Williams\n\nIX (B) Squadron (RAF)\n\nDied: 23 March 2003\n\nOn Sunday 23 March 2003 at 2.48am local time, an RAF GR4 Tornado was returning from a mission over Iraq when it was hit near the Kuwaiti border by a Patriot missile at 18,000ft after its \"friend or foe\" identification system had failed, unknown to the two crewmen. The US battery's electronics thus mis-identified the aircraft as an incoming Iraqi missile. Kevin – the pilot – and David – the navigator – were both killed instantly when the Patriot struck. The families of both men requested that no further details should be released.\n\nSapper Luke Allsopp\n\n33 Engineer Regiment (Explosive Ordnance Disposal)\n\nDied: 23 March 2003\n\nLuke, a 24-year-old from north London, was one of two soldiers killed in an attack on British military vehicles in southern Iraq. \"Luke Allsopp was a very capable individual who was well-liked within the squadron, and a valued team member,\" said Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Troulan, his commanding officer. \"He had served in bomb disposal in Cyprus and Kenya. He leaves behind a loving family and girlfriend, Katy.\"\n\nStaff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth\n\n33 Engineer Regiment (Explosive Ordnance Disposal)\n\nDied: 23 March 2003\n\nSimon, who died in the same incident as Sapper Allsopp, was from Essex. He was 36. His commanding officer described him as \"an extremely experienced soldier who was in line for promotion and whose dedication to duty and professionalism won him the respect of everyone he served with.\"\n\n\"This was his third tour of duty with the regiment,\" continued Lieutenant Colonel Troulan; \"he had already served as a bomb disposal officer in the Balkans and Afghanistan. He leaves behind his wife Allison and two young sons aged eight and three.\"\n\nSergeant Steven Roberts\n\n2nd Royal Tank Regiment\n\nDied: 24 March 2003\n\nAged 33, Steven – known as \"TC\" in his regiment – was killed in action near Az Zubayr, south west of Basra. Brought up in Cornwall, he later lived in Bradford. He joined the Army in 1986 and quickly gained promotion, serving in Northern Ireland, Cyprus and Canada. His commanding officer described him as \"an all-round professional soldier\" and a \"first-class tank commander, a strong and effective leader with great depth of character who excelled under pressure\". Keen on sport, he had also represented both the 2nd and 3rd Tank Regiments in rugby and squash.\n\nHis wife Samantha said in a statement: \"Steve's whole future lay with the Army; it was his life and he was very proud of his job. He was adamant that he was doing the right thing and said that he was doing it for the people back home and the Iraqi people. He was a unique man, who was very outgoing and sociable. We loved each other deeply – he is totally irreplaceable.\"\n\nHis mother, Mrs Marion Chapman, said: \"Steve loved Cornwall – and he always took a Cornish flag with him everywhere. He was the best son anyone could have. He made us laugh, he was the most perfect son ever.\"\n\nLance Corporal Barry Stephen\n\n1st Batallion, The Black Watch\n\nDied: 24 March 2003\n\nA 31-year-old from Perth, Barry \"Baz\" Stephen was awarded a posthumous mention in dispatches for the gallantry he displayed during the action in which he fell, near Al Zubayr. He joined the battalion in 1997, and served in Northern Ireland, Germany, and in the UK with the regimental recruiting team. He was then called back to his regiment in Fallingbostel, Germany, to rejoin the mortar platoon.\n\nIn a statement issued on behalf of his family, his close friend Sergeant Mark Hudson said: \"I know I speak for Barry's family and all of his many friends when I say that we are absolutely devastated to learn of his death. He was a wonderful husband and son as well as a great friend. I know he was very proud to be a soldier and to wear the red hackle. He loved the army, and both his family and I take some comfort from knowing that he died a hero, doing the job he loved. We will miss him dreadfully.\"\n\nCorporal Stephen Allbutt\n\nQueen's Royal Lancers\n\nDied: 25 March, 2003\n\nOn one day, two soldiers from the Queen's Royal Lancers were killed by \"friendly fire\" when their Challenger 2 main battle tank was accidentally hit by another Challenger 2 during a battle with Iraqi forces on the outskirts of Basra. One was David Clark, the other was Stephen Allbutt.\n\nStephen joined the 16th/5th the Queen's Royal Lancers in 1989 and saw action on Operation Desert Storm in 1991. He also served in Bosnia. His commanding officer described him as an 'immensely dedicated and competent NCO' who was a strong candidate for promotion. Aged 35, he camed from Stoke-on-Trent and was married with two sons: Joshua, now 16, and Connor, 11. He and his wife Debi would have celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary in September 2003.\n\n\"The Army was Steve's life,\" says Debi today. \"He had wanted to join since he was a little boy. Although he was quiet, he had a brilliant sense of humour and was a loyal and devoted friend. He was also very romantic. Just before he left for the Gulf he planted some daffodil bulbs in our garden as a surprise, so they'd come up while he was away. They came up just before he died. I hadn't noticed them, and it was in one of the last phone calls I got from him that he said: 'Have you noticed anything in the garden?' And I looked out, and said: 'Oh yes! Thank you!' He was just a quiet family man really. He loved his boys, and his life, he said, was his three loves: Stoke City FC, and the Army, and me and the kids. He used to laugh and say that Stoke came first, but obviously I didn't believe him. We loved each other deeply and words cannot express how much I'll miss him. He was my true love.\"\n\nTrooper David Clarke\n\nQueen's Royal Lancers​\n\nDied: 25 March 2003\n\nNineteen years old, David, from Littleworth, Staffordshire, was a keen sportsman who played for Stafford Rugby Club when he was on leave. He had joined the Army aged 16, straight from school, and had volunteered for service in Iraq.\n\n\"He had wanted to join up ever since he was a little boy – he had no interest whatsoever in doing anything else,' recalls his mother, Beverley. His commanding officer described him as a 'diligent and popular soldier, [with] a promising career ahead of him\". On his next leave, he was due to get engaged to his childhood sweetheart, Rachel.\n\nHis mother says he was as much a friend as a son to her: he loved going clubbing, and used to take her with him. \"The last time he came home on leave I was at work at our local Co-op,\" she recalls, \"and he came running into the store, picked me up and gave me a great big kiss in front of everybody. He wasn't frightened about letting anybody see how he felt. He was my best friend: I didn't just lose my eldest son, I lost my best friend. He lived life to the full. And I'm so proud of him.\"\n\nLance Corporal of Horse Matty Hull\n\nHousehold Cavalry\n\nDied: 28 March 2003\n\nMatty, 25, from Salisbury, served with the Blues & Royals, Household Cavalry Regiment. He was killed in a suspected \"friendly fire\" incident in southern Iraq. His wife, Susan Hull, said in a statement: \"He is, without doubt, the most exceptional man I have ever met; a loving and supportive husband and son, a dedicated soldier and a great friend to so many. He had rightly earned the utmost respect from everyone he worked with, and this makes it that much harder to accept this accidental death. It is not easy to come to terms with the fact that someone who was so full of life has had his so cruelly cut short, just three days before his 26th birthday, but come to terms with it we must. It is what he would want. Matty always strived for a challenge, and Iraq has proved his ultimate test. His aim in life was to be the best he could be, and there was certainly no better husband, son or brother on this earth.\"\n\nMajor Stephen Ballard\n\nRoyal Marines\n\nDied: 30 March 2003\n\nStephen, 33, from Swindon, was in 3 Commando Brigade. He died of natural causes while in Iraq. His family said in a statement: \"Stephen joined the Royal Marines in 1994 and was promoted to the rank of major in 2001. He was passionate about his life in the Royal Marines and proud to be a marine. One of four sons, he loved his family. Stephen and Lucy had been married for 18 months and were thrilled at the prospect of the arrival of their first child. Stephen's family, colleagues and wide circle of friends are devastated by his death.\"\n\nMarine Christopher Maddison\n\nRoyal Marines\n\nDied: 30 March 2003\n\nChristopher, of 9 Assault Squadron, was killed in action near Basra. Aged 24, he came from Scarborough. In a statement, his parents said: \"Christopher Maddison was loved and respected by everybody who knew him. He was a man of character, honour and principles who always fought for those less able. As he lived, he died, with strength and courage. He died in a war that will be won in his name alongside all the other brave souls who selflessly gave themselves for the freedom of all our nations. God bless him and all his brothers and sisters.\"\n\nLance Corporal Shaun Brierley\n\n212 Signal Squadron\n\nDied: 30 March 2003\n\nShaun, from West Yorkshire, was killed in a road accident in Kuwait.

Aged 28, he had been based in Germany for four years and was the father of a three-year-old son with his German girlfriend Birgitte.\n\nHis father Peter fondly remembers a \"big, noisy lad\", who looked tough and aggressive – but wasn't. \"He was really in your face, but he wouldn't have harmed anybody. He was the gentle-giant type,\" says Peter. At his grammar school he would protect younger children from bullies, and as a teenager he often intervened to try to stop fights.\n\nHe never hid his opinions; but although \"he looked and sounded aggressive, but he wasn't at all, and he had that knack of talking to people. He was an intelligent lad\".\n\nStaff Sergeant Chris Muir\n\nRoyal Logistic Corps\n\nDied: 31 March 2003\n\nA staff sergeant with the Army School of Ammunition, Chris, from Romsey, Hampshire, was killed in southern Iraq during a bomb disposal operation. Aged 32, he was qualified in bomb disposal at the highest level and had travelled widely with the Royal Logistics Corps. Shortly before his death, he had been selected for promotion to warrant officer. \"It is a particularly sad fact that we will not see him wearing the new rank he so richly deserved,\" said his commanding officer, recalling his wit, and his love of sport and motorcycling. \"He was a very strong character, an outstanding technician, and a highly effective leader. Most of all, however, Chris was a gentleman through and through.\"\n\nHis wife Gillian said in a statement: \"Chris was the sort of person that could light up a room just by being in it. I know that [he] was very proud to wear the badge of an ammunition technician, and I take small comfort from the knowledge that he died doing the job he loved. He has left me and our families with the most fantastic of memories, the greatest one being our son, Ben, who can grow up knowing that his father was a good, honest, hardworking soldier, who died trying to do the right thing.\"\n\nLance Corporal Karl Shearer\n\nHousehold Cavalry\n\nDied: 1 April 2003\n\nKarl, from Irvine in Ayrshire, was killed when a Scimitar armoured vehicle overturned. He was 24. His wife Suzie described him as \"a very loving, supportive husband and father. He was a wonderful son and brother.

He was also a valued member of the pipe band.\n\nHis family said in a statement: \"Ian was a wonderful son, full of life and vitality, fun and wit. His family and girlfriend are devastated to learn of his death. He had so many friends and so much to live for. He loved the Army and lived for the excitement and challenges that being a soldier brought. He was proud to be an Irishman and proud to serve in the Irish Guards. His family takes some comfort from knowing that he died doing the job he loved.\"\n\nPiper Christopher Muzvuru\n\n1st Batallion, Irish Guards\n\nDied: 6 April 2003\n\nChristopher, 21, was from Zimbabwe and was his regiment's first black piper. He died in the same incident as Lance Corporal Malone. He had enlisted in February 2001, and after training joined his battalion in October that year.

He was a credit to his corps and will be sadly missed.\"\n\nHis mother Mary said he was a \"wonderful son\", with a lively sense of humour. \"Words cannot express the depth of our grief, but mixed with our profound sadness there is pride in the knowledge that he died a soldier while serving his country. He will be remembered by all that knew him forever.\"\n\nPrivate Andrew Kelly\n\nParachute Regiment\n\nDied: 6 May 2003\n\nAndrew, from Tavistock, was in Iraq with the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment. He died in an accident. His mother, Helen Yallop, said in a statement: \"Andrew's loss is deeply felt by all the family. We are devastated. He was a wonderful, fearless and confident son, always well-mannered, and who, even as a young boy, desired only to be a Para. He turned 18 on 9 March 2003, and within days was on his way to the Gulf.\n\n\"Even at school in Tavistock, he was single-minded about an Army career, knowing it would fulfil his ambitions for travel and sport. He loved swimming, roller-blading and skiing, and had enjoyed many family trips abroad. In his last call to me just days ago, he said, 'Don't worry about me mum; Paras always go to heaven.' Andrew remains alive in our thoughts and memories; it will always be so.\"\n\nDescribing him as polite and \"quiet but confident and likeable\", his commanding officer said he was a \"full of energy and life with a long career in The Parachute Regiment ahead of him...

While in Afghanistan he devised a new ad-hoc loading scheme which directly led to the success of a major operation during the conflict there.\n\nRemembered for his intelligent approach to his work and his ebullient enthusiasm, he was also a fierce opponent on the golf course – and something of an entertainer, who would play music to parachutists as they jumped.\n\nAged 34, he had been married to his wife Sheila since 1992. He was delighted that his daughter Poppy had shown an interest in his passion – golf – and had already started taking lessons.\n\nSergeant Robert O'Connor\n\nEngineering Wing, RAF Lyneham\n\nDied 30 January 2005\n\nAged 38 and single, Robert had joined the RAF as an apprentice in 1985.

Words will never be able to express the loss that we feel today. He was always adventurous, fun loving and had a wicked sense of humour. Steve will forever be in the hearts of those that knew him best.\" Aged 25 and single, he came from Fareham.\n\nPrivate Mark Dobson\n\nTyne-Tees Regiment\n\nDied: 28 March 2005\n\nMark had joined the Territorial Army in July 1996, and was posted to Iraq on 10 November 2004, attached to the Force Protection Unit providing security for personnel working out of the Multi National Division (South East) Headquarters at Basra Air Station.

He is survived by his father Stephen, mother Janet, brother David, and sister Faye. His father said: \"Alan loved being in the Army – it was all he had ever wanted to do. He was immensely proud to be a soldier and we were immensely proud that he was a soldier. It is some comfort to us, as we grieve for Alan, that he died doing what he loved so much.\"\n\nHis commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Toby Bridge, said that he: \"lived life to the full. He had a passion for racing, football and fishing. Above all we will remember his tremendous sense of humour and fun, and his willingness to try something new.\"\n\nSignaller Paul Didsbury\n\n21st Signal Regiment (Air Support)\n\nDied: 29 June 2005\n\nPaul – known as \"Dids\" – was two weeks short of his 19th birthday when he died from a suspected \"negligent discharge incident\" at Basra Air Station. He was serving as part of the Joint Helicopter Force Iraq, having joined the Army in August 2002. His commanding officer said of him: \"He was an outgoing and irrepressibly cheerful soldier who was very well known and hugely popular... Always keen to try new things, he siezed every opportunity to broaden his horizons and relished the challenges that operations in Iraq offered. Fit, bright and a capable operator, what set Signaller Didsbury apart was his enthusiasm and zest for life.\"\n\nSecond Lieutenant Richard Shearer\n\n1st Battalion, Staffordshire Regiment\n\nDied: 16 July 2005\n\nRichard, from Nuneaton, was 26. He was one of three soldiers from C Company, The 1st Battalion Staffordshire Regiment, who were killed by a roadside bomb in Al Amarah. He had already served in the French Foreign Legion, and had only been commissioned into the regiment the previous year. He was described as a \"bold platoon commander and certainly no stranger to either danger or excitement\". His commanding officer said of him: \"He had quickly established himself as a true soldier and a leader of men. His passion for soldiering was infectious and he was highly respected by everyone. A true accolade: his men loved him and regarded him as much more than their platoon commander...\"\n\nPrivate Phillip Hewett\n\n1st Battalion, Stafforshire Regiment\n\nDied: 16 July 2005\n\nAlthough he was only 21, Phillip was Second Lieutenant Shearer's driver – a position of great responsibility in combat situations. He had been with the platoon since arriving in the 1st Battalion three years ago. From Tamworth, he was described as a \"cheerful and intelligent young man with a natural air of confidence\" who had a sound future in the Army. He had been selected to attend a promotional course this winter and was also short-listed to become a physical training instructor.\n\nPrivate Leon Spicer1\n\nst Battalion, Stafforshire regiment\n\nDied: 16 July 2005\n\nThe third victim of the incident that killed Richard Shearer and Phillip Hewett, Leon – also from Tamworth – was 26 when he died. His commanding officer said: \"After sustaining a serious injury to his leg last year, he had worked against the odds to become fully fit again.

Always larger than life, Leon got along extremely well with all those he worked with.\"\n\nFusilier Donal Meade\n\n2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers\n\nDied: 5 September 2005\n\nKilled in the same incident as Fusilier Stephen Manning (see below), Donal was 20. He was born on the island of Montserrat but came to Britain when he was 10 following the volcanic eruption of 1995. He lived in Plumstead, London, and enlisted in the Army when he was 17. He joined the fusiliers in 2002 and – like Stephen Manning – volunteered to serve in Iraq. His family said: \"[We] are tremendously proud of Donal and couldn't ask for a better son. Donal will be deeply missed, but we take comfort in that he died doing a job he loved.\"\n\nThe commanding officer of 2nd Regiment Royal Fusiliers, Lt Col John Whitwam MBE, said: \"The whole of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers mourns the tragic loss of these two fine young men... They understood the dangers but were proud to be soldiers and recognised that they were doing a difficult, occasionally thankless but always worthwhile job.\"\n\nFusilier Stephen Manning\n\n2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers\n\nDied: 5 September 2005\n\nKilled by a roadside bomb while on patrol near Az Zubayr, Stephen was 22 and came from Erith, Kent. His commanding officer said: \"In the two years with the Fusiliers in both Belfast and Iraq, Fusilier Manning had made many friends... he will be sorely missed by them all... Above all, his many friends in the Company and across the Regiment remember his generosity of spirit, and his cheerfulness.\"\n\nMajor Matthew Bacon\n\nIntellgence Corps\n\nDied: 11 September 2005\n\n\"Our son was a hero,\" said a statement from Matthew's parents, \"invincible we thought, having served in conflict zones including Northern Ireland, the Gulf, Former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan as well as enjoying high-risk sports like sky-diving. We have always understood the risks attached to Matthew's career but never imagined that anything could or would happen to our son. We are immensely proud of Matthew, of the leader he became, the lives of people he touched directly and indirectly and the good work he did throughout his career.\"\n\nThirty-four years old, single, and from the London area, Matthew had joined the Army in 1988 and served with the Intelligence Corps. At the time of his death, he was serving as a staff officer with the Headquarters of Multi-National Division (South East). He was killed by a roadside bomb in Basra.\n\nHis commanding officer described his death as \"a desperate loss to his family, and his girlfriend, and a tragic blow to his friends and colleagues.\"\n\nLieutenant Colonel Andrew Barrow continued: \"[He] did not waste a moment of his life. He loved soldiering, had a passion for physical exercise, and in his spare time was studying for a law degree.\"\n\nCaptain Ken Masters\n\nRoyal Military Police\n\nDied: 15 October 2005\n\nAs commanding officer of 61 Section, Special Investigation Branch, Ken had been responsible for the investigation of all \"in-theatre\" serious incidents and investigations conducted by the General Police Duties section of the Theatre Investigation Group. Aged 40, he was married with two children and had served with the Royal Military Police since 1981.

He was killed by a roadside bomb while reconnoitring a route for the late- night patrol he was leading. Friends in East Brierley remembered him as \"the life and soul\" and \"a hell of a good mate\"; his wife of two years, Gemma, was too upset to talk about his death. The commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards battle group, Lieutenant Colonel Nick Henderson, described Chris as \"a capable and reliable individual... He set a fine example to those of all ranks who served with him; it is significant that at the time of his death he was, as ever, leading his men from the front. A bright future in the Army beckoned and he would undoubtedly have gone far in the profession that he had chosen and that he loved. He was the epitome of a professional soldier.\n\n\"Chris was more than just this. He was a fun-loving and warm-hearted character who always displayed an irrepressible cheerfulness; however bad things were Chris could always raise a smile... [and] lighten any situation. To him things were always good, or, as he would put it, 'canny'.\n\n\"We are also keenly aware that Chris was not just a comrade and friend to those of us who were fortunate enough to serve alongside him; he was also a loving husband and son. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, parents, family and friends at this tragic time.\"\n\nThe above accounts are from 'Remembrance: The Fallen of Iraq' by Malcolm Macalister Hall, published in 2005.
