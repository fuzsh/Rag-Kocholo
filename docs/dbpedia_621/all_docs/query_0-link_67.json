        "text": "The Churchill Day Book\n\nThe Day Book is an old project, first proposed by Dalton Newfield, the accomplished editor of Finest Hour from 1970 to 1975. After his death in 1982, the work was periodically revived but proved formidable. In the digital age, The Churchill Project now revives the effort. We invite any reader intrigued by logging all of Churchill’s days to supply more years. Please contact [email protected].\n\nDalton Newfield’s objective was a single reference pinpointing Churchill’s location and activity for every day of his life. He was undaunted by the fact that it would cover 33,000 days. Given the scope, detail is avoided. That is provided by the Official Biography and legions of other biographies and specialized studies. Knowing where Churchill was, with the briefest description of his activities, is invaluable to researchers, students, scholars, or just the curious.\n\n“Action This Day”: 1943\n\nThe year 1943 was the final turning point of the Second World War. It was the year of the Axis surrenders at Stalingrad and Tunisia, the Allied invasion of Italy. Mussolini fell, strategic bombing intensified. Germany lost the Battle of Kursk and the Battle of the Atlantic. Overall, 1943 proved what had been apparent since the Soviets and Americans entered the war: Bitter fighting lay ahead, but Germany was sure to lose.\n\nWinston Churchill’s 1943 schedule was one of relentless activity. He worked abed in mornings and continued through the day. A late afternoon nap allowed extended his day into the early morning hours. Assisted by his personal staff, he worked with his closest political and military officials. He read cables, correspondence, communiqués, newspapers, government reports, intelligence data, and other documents at a voracious rate. His foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, compared the reading regime to reading a novel a day.\n\nEach day Churchill chaired meetings of numerous committees, the most important being the War Cabinet. These meetings often descended into arguments and contentious exchanges. The Prime Minister did not hesitate to “pester, nag, and bite.” Grave subjects from military strategy to postwar Europe were decided. Churchill issued “Action This Day” memos by the dozens to officials; wrote his own speeches; and drafted and approved cables to other world leaders, most importantly Stalin and Roosevelt. In 1943 he sent about 300 cables to Roosevelt and at least twenty-five to Stalin.\n\nForeign affairs\n\nChurchill met with monarchs, presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers, visiting envoys and delegations. He brought into discussions generals, admirals, air marshals, ambassadors, high commissioners, and Members of Parliament. When both were in the country, they held a weekly luncheon at Buckingham Palace. As prime minister in a parliamentary system, WSC appeared in the House of Commons to speak and answer questions from the members. He inspected military units, and addressed civilians from Cyprus to Quebec.\n\nIn 1943 Churchill travelled thousands of miles by plane, train, car and ship. He spent 147 days outside of Britain, visiting twelve countries. He participated in the conferences at Casablanca, Washington, Quebec, Cairo, and Teheran. During the year he delivered set-piece speeches to the House of Commons, addressed a joint session of the United States Congress, and made worldwide radio broadcasts. He chaired ninety meetings of the War Cabinet.\n\nHealth concerns\n\nChurchill’s grueling 1943 schedule was broken two major periods of pneumonia. He was bedridden in February-March and late in the year. Lord Moran, his personal physician, worried that the PM was going to die. But the last days of 1943 saw him recuperating from his latest illness in Marrakesh, Morocco.\n\nAs diversions, Churchill regularly watched movies, occasionally went to the theatre and played bezique. He sought refuge at Chequers on weekends, and occasionally escaped to Chartwell. He did less reading for relaxation during the war. There was no oil painting, save for one opportunity early in 1943 at Marrakesh. He was supported through the strain of war by his wife, daughters, and brother; less so by his son Randolph.\n\nJanuary\n\n1: London; departs for Chequers, the country home of prime ministers.\n\n2: Chequers.\n\n3: Chequers; guests included General Frederick Browning of Airborne Forces.\n\n4: Chequers; returns to London; chairs War Cabinet.\n\n5-8: London; chairs several War Cabinets.\n\n10: Meets with Georges Catroux, General Delegate of Free France in the Levant.\n\n11: London; War Cabinet.\n\n12: London; audience with King George VI; War Cabinet; flies for Casablanca.\n\n13: Casablanca.\n\n14: Discusses 1943 plans with President Franklin D.
