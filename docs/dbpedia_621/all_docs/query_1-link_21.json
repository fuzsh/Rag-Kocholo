        "text": "Promoted to Lieutenant on the 28th of January 1940.\n\nGranted 10 days leave to England.\n\nRichard married Barbara Joan Stuart-Roberts at St. Thomas-on-the-Bourne, Farnham, Surrey, on the 8th of April 1940. Richard's best-man was Lieutenant Kempthorne also on 10 days leave. They both served together in the 2nd Royal Scots Fusiliers.\n\nRichard served as Motor Transport Officer, 6 Platoon, H.Q. Company.\n\nOn the 10th of May the German invaded France and the Low Countries. The 2nd Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers were ordered to Belgium although the route was heavy with refugees streaming the opposite way and soon was attacked by German Stuka dive bombers which caused little casualties but many road blockages further slowing the advance. It took the Motor Transport Company 6 days to reach their destination in Belgium where they met up with the rest of the Battalion. The 2nd Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers were suddenly ordered on the 18th of May to Arras, France due to the German breakthrough at Sedan.\n\nArriving at Arras on the 21st after struggling again through the refugees although this time moving in the same direction. Taking up positions below Vimy Ridge of World War One fame, Contact was made with the Germans and a combined Tank and Infantry attack took place which gained a good amount of ground. This was of no great use as the French on the right gave way. The enemy made a massive counter attack in which they used 400 tanks. All the British had to oppose them with, was a force of 33 old tanks with badly worn tracks. The situation was quite hopeless and General Franklin who commanded the 5th Division ordered the withdrawal. One of the problems was how could they extract the transport as a lot of the roads were impassable with shell craters and bombed vehicles.\n\nLieutenant Kempthorne recorded in his diary;\n\n\" Dick (Richard) and I set off on our Motor Cycles to try and find an escape route.\n\nAs far as we knew the Germans had not yet entered Arras itself as the main bridge over the River Somme to the city had been blown. It was night time and riding without lights, we entered the city and headed for the river to see if we could find a crossing point. Riding towards the bridge which had been blown, we turned the corner into the main street and saw a good deal of commotion going on, with much revving of heavy engines. We parked our bikes in an alleyway and removing our steel helmets, mingled with the crowds who were approaching a line of vehicles. To our horror we suddenly found ourselves alongside a tank with the distinctive German Iron cross markings and the crew wearing German uniforms. Pulling the collars of our jackets well up on our necks and thankful that we had left our tin hats by our bikes; we back through the crowd of spectators and returned to our machines. Driving madly back to Vimy Ridge. It was obvious that the enemy had managed to throw a bridge across the river and exit in that area was impossible. Arriving back with the transport section, we found out that the main road Northward had been cleared, there were many hazards, but it was at least passable. Assembling the convoy, we headed North towards Lens. The refugees were a constant nuisance, blocking our way, I well remember firing my revolver over their heads, in an effort to show them that we were not fooling, and that they had to leave us a clear route. This worked wonders! This was on the 23rd of May. The Battalion had managed to carry out a withdrawal, and were in an action at Douai, after which they were provided with troop transports to ferry them to Seclin, where we met up with them.\"\n\nBy now it was appeared the whole of the B.E.F. was surrounded and General Lord Gort, who was commanding the B.E.F. ordered the 5th Division to cover the withdrawal of the rest of the British Army, as a total evacuation through the Port of Dunkirk seemed a possibility. The 2nd Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers took up position along the Ypres-Comines Canal, and dug in on the 25th of May. Heavy fighting took place and the Battalion was forced back to the other side of the canal. By the 27th of May it seemed getting back to England seemed very remote.\n\nLieutenant Kempthorne recorded in his diary;\n\n\" Making a short Recce: Dick (Richard) and I rode down the road and were amazed to see the drivers of one unit, armed with sledge hammers, bashing the hell out of all their vehicles, slashing tyres and generally wrecking each vehicle in turn. We made enquiries and were told that they had been ordered to destroy all their vehicles and after that every man was to get to the coast, the best way he could and head for Britain.\n\nNo way, were they to attempt to drive the trucks or whatever, as this would cause congestion on the roads and get in the way of the troops still fighting. We returned to our HQ at the Farmhouse, to find out that we had not received any orders about destroying our transport. As we were discussing the matter, a dispatch rider from Battalion arrived and handed us an urgent signal, telling us that they were running out of ammunition and that a further supply was urgently required. Two large three ton trucks were already loaded with ammunition, calling the drivers, we ordered them to follow our motor cycles. We had no maps of the area and had been given no map reference and could only rely on the information that we had extracted from the battalion dispatch rider, regarding the position of the BHQ. We had a vague and headed for the village of Voormozelle. Leaving the village, we found ourselves on a ridge in open country. Getting the truck drivers to put their vehicles under cover, we moved along the ridge, stopping from time to time to establish our position. We felt quite certain that we were going the right direction, as we recognised hill 60 in the distance. Just below us we could see the odd stretch of a canal. We had not reached the highest point of the ridge, so we thought that by getting there, we might get a better view through field glasses. We stopped our bikes and Dick dismounted, while I remained in the saddle with my feet on the ground. Suddenly there was an enormous flash and I found myself on the ground with the heavy bike on top of me. I must have been unconscious for a moment, for when I came to; Dick had pulled the bike off me and was pulling my first aid dressing out of its pocket in my battledress. I felt a hot stream of blood, flowing out of my head and just above my right eye, and I could see nothing with either eye. Dick must have laid me out on the ground and placed the field dressing over the injured area. It turned out that the Germans, must have spotted us on the ridge and let fly with a mortar shell, a large fragment of which had hit me just above the right eye. The curious thing was that Dick had been standing closer to the explosion than I was and although knocked to the ground, was not in any way hit. We were both wearing steel helmets, but when riding a motorcycle, one tends to tip the thing backwards, to avoid getting wind under the rim, so my forehead was not protected! While Dick was attending to my wound I heard a car pull up and I heard Dick say “It’s the Brigade Commander, Monty Stopford.” Helping Dick to get me into his car, I remember him saying “ He looks bad, I will take him to the dressing station, Which is just down the road.” I then heard the brigadier, giving Dick the exact whereabouts of Battalion HQ and he shot off to pick up the two trucks and from what I gathered he, though very shaken was able to deliver the goods. The Brigadier dropped me off at the dressing station, which was housed in what had been a monastery, and had been taken over by the Royal Army Medical Corps. The Brigadier must have had a busy day, as another friend of mine, who was wounded on the same day was also taken to the same dressing station by this kind gentleman!\n\nLieutenant John Philip Kempthorne lost an eye and was evacuated via Dunkirk and survived the war.\n\nAt about midnight on the 28th of May 1940 orders were received that the line had to be held at all costs to allow the safe withdrawal of the bulk of the B.E.F., at this period the C.O. (Colonel Tod) was collecting the remains of the battalion round a farm to make a final stand. His answer to the Commander-in-Chief’s message was “Tell the Brigadier I am not going a foot back”.\n\nBrigade H.Q. destroyed all it's paperwork and dispatched the last of it's wounded to the rear, the battalion existed of the remains of C, D and HQ Coys spread out between the farm and the woods that held the remains of the old \"white house\" manor, which was destroyed during WW1. At 4.00.am the Germans began to attack and fierce fighting continued throughout the morning and early afternoon when the situation became helpless and running low on ammunition and with many wounded the remaining men surrendered.\n\nRichard with the Motor Transport Company managed to escape, while others were collected under the command of the C.O. of the 6th Battalion Seaforth Highlanders. These men withdraw to Dunkirk over the next couple of days and were evacuated and reached England on the 1st of June 1940. Back in England the remains of the 2nd Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers collected at Blackdown Camp, Deepcut, Surrey. Brigadier Stopford wrote:\n\n\"the numbers gradually mounted to 250 in the camp at Blackdown near Aldershot where the survivors were assembled—more, he says, than he had dared to hope for.\"\n\nThese Royal Scots Fusiliers had made their escapes as individuals and small groups, crossing through German lines and either escaping through Dunkirk with other units or through Le Havre.\n\nAppointed as Acting Captain Royal Scots Fusiliers, on the 10th of June 1940.\n\nAppointed Temporary Captain Royal Scots Fusiliers. on the 10th of September 1940.\n\nPromoted to Captain, unknown date.\n\nAppointed as Adjutant 2nd Royal Scots Fusiliers on the 25th of January 1941.\n\nPromoted to Major, unknown date.\n\nAfter 2 years of Home Defence service the 2nd Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers were ordered once more overseas. Joining the 17th Brigade in the 5th Division the Battalion was part of Force 121. Sailing on the 17th of March 1942, Force 121 took part in the first British amphibious assault since the disastrous landings in the Dardanelles (Gallipoli, Turkey) twenty-seven years before, against the Vichy French controlled island of Madagascar. Operation Ironclad started on the 5th of May 1942, with landings at Courrier Bay and Ambararata Bay, just west of the major port of Diego Suarez (later known as Antsiranana), at the northern tip of Madagascar.\n\nThe French defence was highly effective in the beginning and the main Allied force was brought to a halt by the morning of the 6th of May. The deadlock was broken when the destroyer H.M.S. Anthony dashed straight past the harbour defences of Diego Suarez and landed 50 Royal Marines amidst the Vichy rear area. The Marines created \"disturbance in the town out of all proportion to their numbers\" and the Vichy defence was soon broken. Diego Suarez was surrendered on the 7th of May, although substantial Vichy forces withdrew to the south. Hostilities continued at a low level for several months on Madagascar but after the 19th May two brigades of the 5th Infantry Division were transferred to India.\n\nOn the 20th of August 1942, the 2nd Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers were posted to Iraq arriving there on the 28th of August.\n\nPosted to Persia on the 28th of September 1942.\n\nPosted to Syria on the 1st of February 1943, arriving there on the 13th.\n\nPosted to Egypt on the 11th of June 1943, arriving there on the 28th of June 1943.\n\nPosted to Sicily, sailing on the 29th of June 1943.\n\nTook part in Operation Husky landings on Sicily on the 10th of July 1943. Landings were made in the early hours of the 10th of July on 26 main beaches spread along 105 miles of the southern and eastern coasts of the island. By the evening of the 10th of July, the seven Allied assault divisions three American, three British and one Canadian, were well established ashore, the port of Syracuse had been captured and fears of an Axis air onslaught had proved unfounded. The Allied army pushed inland and by the 17th/18th of July fighting for Catania met fierce resistance.\n\nThe 5th Division was now nearing the loops of the Simeto river, and on the afternoon of the 18th July the 13th Brigade began to advance to the river line while the rest of the Division was moving up. The Inniskillings found an intact bridge at Paso del Sico, known to the Division as “Lemon Bridge “, and the whole Battalion crossed by night after subduing a small enemy post. It was fiercely counter-attacked by German paratroops, who had withdrawn from the bridge temporarily to allow for an artillery concentration and had then been sent back. The 2nd Wiltshires secured a smaller bridgehead further downstream, from which they made contact with Canadian tanks attached to the Division. At about this time the Germans broke through between the two Battalions, led by Tiger tanks, but were turned back by the 2nd Cameronians in reserve.\n\nThe British guns, back in “Messerschmitt Valley “, were out of range and were brought forward into an exposed position to support a night attack by the 15th Brigade intended to enlarge the 13th’s bridgehead over Lemon Bridge. During the night the three Yorkshire Battalions of the 15th Brigade were badly shattered, one of the casualties being Captain Hedley Verity, the famous cricketer, who died in captivity. At daylight on the 19th of July the whole brigade was caught in the middle of the Catanian Plain and was heavily shelled by German artillery firing from Mount Etna. The survivors managed to withdraw to a more favourable position. In the meantime the 13th Brigade had moved to its right to establish firm contact with the both Division. This was the situation when the Scots Fusiliers arrived on the River Simeto from Lentini. The 13th Brigade was withdrawn and rested before being sent westward to come under command of the 51st (Highland) Division. The 17th Brigade, plus one Battalion of the 15th Brigade, entered the divisional line on the night of 21st/22nd of July, the Scots Fusiliers relieving the 2nd Cameronians of the 13th Brigade. “C “and” D” Companies went forward, with “ A” and “ B” Companies in reserve. On the left were the 1st King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry of the 15th Brigade, and on the right the 2nd Northamptonshires.\n\nIt was now evident that the direct road to Catania over the Simeto was barred, at a point only six miles distant from the town. Any attempt to reach Catania by crossing the intervening rivers on the plain, which were completely overlooked by artillery observation posts on Etna and stoutly defended, was clearly impracticable. Instead, General Montgomery decided to skirt round the Plain of Catania, wheeling XXX Corps on the pivot of XIII Corps, which was ordered to remain active on the line of the Simeto to conceal the real intention. So far XXX Corps, which had landed on 10th/11th of July with other forces on the Pachino Peninsula to secure the left flank of XIII Corps and to maintain contact with the American Seventh Army, had not been much engaged.\n\nCatania was so tantalisingly close as to give the feeling that even if it could not be rushed it might be entered by stealth. The condition of the roads for wheeled and tracked traffic had deteriorated, and prospects of a successful attack across country by tanks were not improved by a network of irrigation and drainage ditches which made a geometrical pattern on the plain. In particular, one long ditch, the Fossa Botticelli, which lay about two miles beyond the Simeto river, was too deep for armour to cross or, once in, to get out of. Night patrolling by the Scots Fusiliers, and resultant encounters with an enemy bent on holding his ground by means of scattered posts and counter-patrol, became a regular routine. The British artillery, reinforced daily from the ports and beaches, was deployed in a wide arc round the perimeter of the Catania Plain, on the heights to the south-west and even in pits on the lower levels. The guns were continuously in action, day and night. The two-mile front line was held by the 17th Brigade, with under command a company of the Cheshire Regiment, which supplied the machine gun support for ten days without relief while infantry reliefs were drawn from the 15th Brigade. A gap of six miles between the two Corps, XXX and XIII, was filled by the 5th Reconnaissance Regiment, which was disposed roughly along the line of the Gornalunga river, one of the several tributaries of the Simeto.\n\nThere could be no activity by day in the infantry positions sited near Lemon Bridge, where the Scots Fusiliers and the other Battalions lay, and no movement was possible on the highway to Catania.\n\nKilled In Action on the 23rd of July 1943, aged 26.\n\nOn the Brigade’s first day in the line, Major R. H. B. Shakespear, the Brigade Major, a former adjutant of the Battalion and a survivor of the Ypres-Comines Canal, had driven up the road in his jeep in the afternoon and had been instantly spotted and killed by accurate shellfire. Transport ventured near Lemon Bridge only at night, and all rations and stores had to be manhandled up to the forward companies.\n\nBuried at Catania War Cemetery, Catania, Sicily.\n\nGrave Reference: IV. G. 41.\n\nRemembered on the Camberley War Memorial.\n\nSon of Harry Talbot Shakespear and Winifred Constance Shakespear of Kincurdie, Heathway, Camberley, Surrey; husband of Barbara Joan Shakespear (nee Stuart-Roberts), of Rookwood, Shortheath Road, Farnham, Surrey.\n\nAlexander Marshall, Shearer 1916 - 1944;\n\nBorn on the 19th of October 1916 at Pitglassie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\n\nAlexander left school at age 14 and was an apprentice Cook.\n\nEmigrated to Canada, about 1931.\n\nLiving at Corn Hill, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada.

Published in the London Gazette on the 25th of July 1939. Supplement 34648, Page 5108.\n\nPosted to the B.E.F in France, May 1940.\n\nMike served with the 2nd Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps, in charge of the Bren-gun carriers of A Company, Scout Platoon.\n\nCalais was in chaos, with the town already reeling from enemy air attacks, with the Germans planning on occupying the town, along with Boulogne and Dunkirk. 2nd King's Royal Rifle Corps arrived in Calais on the afternoon of 23rd May. At 6 a.m. on the 24th May 2nd Lieutenant E. Grismond (‘Gris’) B. Davies-Scourfield recorded;\n\n“Mike Sinclair’s scout platoon from ‘A’ Company was sent up to cover the area between ‘B’ and ‘D’ companies. I saw Mike as he came up to check our positions: always methodical, he was carrying a huge mapboard, scrupulously marked up in chinagraph with the latest battle situation.”.\n\nDuring the afternoon of 24th May, Airey Neave, who had been wounded, met Sinclair and recalled:\n\n“A scout car of the 60th came towards us in the command of a young officer who was to become famous in the history of the regiment. This was Michael Sinclair of ‘A’ Company, shot dead in 1944 while trying to escape from Colditz prison camp… Sinclair, although busy with his battle plans, smilingly drew my attention to a van flying the Red Cross. This was an improvised ambulance smelling strongly of stale vegetables. I was bundled into it and driven at high speed as far as the centre bridge over the canal… He was about to move to the support of Lord Cromwell, where he held on to a very exposed position until dusk. That evening, Sinclair did much to prevent the Germans from breaking through on the south-west. His success was also due to Sergeant Bennett, who led a section of carriers… When I think of these fine men, I am able to measure how small was my own contribution to the defence of Calais.\" (Airey Neave, “The Flames of Calais”).\n\nAs the day progressed it became clear that the defensive line employed by Brigadier Nicholson, who was using the series of 19th century ramparts and moats that ran for some 8 miles, could not be held for another day and a withdrawal to the line of canals surrounding the Old Town was ordered. Three bridges led across these canals and were to be the scene of some of the bitterest fighting.\n\nCalais was eventually surrendered by Brigadier Nicholson on the morning of the 26th May 1940. Mike Sinclair was one of those taken as a prisoner of war by the Germans.\n\nGerman Prisoner of War No. 850.\n\nMike was sent to Oflag VII-C at Laufen Castle, near to Salzburg, Bavaria, Germany. While here Mike made his first attempt at escape shortly after Christmas 1940. German guards got to hear of the tunnel the prisoners were digging and both Gris Davies-Scourfield and Mike Sinclair were sentenced to 42 days solitary confinement.\n\nMike was transferred to Stalag XXI-D P.O.W. camp at Poznań, in the north of Poland, early 1941.\n\nBy this time the Germans were treating prisoners quite badly, in reprisal for alleged poor conditions for Germans held in Canada.\n\nOn the 28th of May 1941, Mike Sinclair escaped from Fort VIII, Stalag XXI-D, along with Gris Davies-Scourfield and Ronnie Littledale concealed in a modified handcart. They received assistance from Polish citizens and travelled through Łódź, Kaluskia, Lubochnia-Gorki to Tomazow Maz with the intention of reaching Russia. Learning of the German invasion of the U.S.S.R. they changed their plans and walked to Warsaw, where they lived in hiding from the 25th of June to the 26th of August. Davies-Scourfield remained in Warsaw while Sinclair and Littledale travelled by train to Kraków and onward to Zakopane, alighting at the station before the main city. They walked across the Slovakian border and were driven to Rožňava, where they caught the night train to Budapest. There they stayed for a month before travelling again by train to Yugoslavia through Szeged to Pančevo, then across the River Danube by ferry to Belgrade.\n\nOn the 11th of November they took a train to Jagodina and five days later, took the Sofia train to Bela Palanka. From here they crossed the Yugoslav–Bulgarian frontier by horse-drawn cart. While walking to meet another cart they were stopped by a Bulgarian customs official who, on seeing their Yugoslav papers, took them into custody. They were handed over to the Bulgarian police in Pirot and moved from there to Sofia. Following interrogation, on the 27th of November, they were handed over to the German police. Moved from Sofia to Belgrade they were then moved to Vienna and held in the military prison from the 2nd of December to the 17th of January 1942. They were then taken by train, escorted by one Feldwebel and a soldier in the direction of Dresden, Germany. Seizing an opportunity between Prague and Roudnice, both managed to escape from the moving train through a lavatory window. Unfortunately, Sinclair was spotted and having hurt his leg jumping from the train, was soon recaptured. Littledale avoided capture and eventually headed for Switzerland but was caught in Husinec on the 29th of May, while trying to avoid the police activity in and around Prague after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich two days earlier. Both men were interviewed by the Gestapo before being sent to Colditz Castle.\n\nOflag IV-C, referred to as Colditz Castle because of its location, was one of the most noted German Army prisoner-of-war camps for captured enemy officers during World War II. Mike Sinclair made his first escape attempt from Colditz after he was sent to a hospital in Leipzig to receive treatment for sinusitis. On the 2nd of June 1942, he escaped through a hospital window and made it as far as Cologne, however good fortune was not with him and he was taken into custody once more. The R.A.F. had recently made its first one-thousand bomber raid on the city, causing massive devastation and loss of life, and so it was that he arrived to find the local population intensely alert and roused by reports that a bomber had been shot down and that the crew had parachuted into some nearby woodland. Mike was first taken to a nearby Stalag before he was to return to Oflag IV-C, however his bid for freedom was not finished and, on the 8th of June, he made another attempt and was taken to Leipzig for court martial, managing to escape again whilst in the lavatory at the Leipzig barracks. He was recaptured a few days later in Cologne. In October, Littledale and three others escaped successfully, making it to Switzerland.\n\nMike's next attempt to get out of Colditz was not made until the 26th of November 1942, when he and a Dutchman, Charles Klein, successfully got out of the castle by simply walking through the German kitchens shortly after the guards had taken their lunch break. Quite how they achieved this remains a mystery, passwords were changed on a daily basis, yet all the security checks which lay between the kitchens and the outside world failed to stop them. Two days later, the pair were caught in Immendingen, Germany. Once more Sinclair managed to escape again before he was returned to Colditz, however he was recaptured on the 30th November.\n\nMike was an individual in every sense of the word, he kept his own counsel and seldom welcomed company. He was driven by a desire to personally cause as much damage to Germany as possible, this was his duty and one to which his own safety was entirely secondary. So single-minded was he that he had few friends and was certainly not an easy man to talk to, although everyone greatly respected his ability. A fellow prisoner, Mike Edwards, said,\n\n\"For Mike Sinclair, there was God - then the Sixtieth (KRRC), and that was it. His only aim in life was to get back to his Regiment.\"\n\nPat Ferguson remarked,\n\n\"The only times I ever spoke to him in the Colditz yard he just wanted to get out and kill as many Germans as possible. He seemed to be on a personal crusade between himself and the whole of Hitler's occupied Europe.\" His brush with the Gestapo in Poland contributed much to his determination.\n\nGris Davies-Scourfield, himself an outstanding escaper, was impressed by Sinclair’s determination;\n\n“I would wake up in the middle of the night, as we were usually in the same room. Mike would be standing at the window just watching the sentries patrolling below, counting the number of seconds it took them to turn around and walk back on their beats. He was constantly looking for any information that might be useful to him”.\n\nAlthough prone to making an improvised escape whenever he spotted the opportunity, Sinclair was also a ruthless planner who considered even the finest of details. No other escape that Sinclair attempted demonstrated his thoroughness more than his plan to impersonate Stabsfeldwebel (Sergeant Major) Rothenberger who, with his enormous moustache, was probably the most distinctive guard in the camp. Known to the prisoners as 'Franz Josef' for his strong resemblance to Franz Josef, the former Austrian Emperor.\n\nMike noted that each night, Rothenberger carried out an inspection of the sentries on the road that ran alongside the camp and down to the exercise park. Mike's plan was to disguise himself as Rothenberger and, accompanied by two German-speaking prisoners dressed as guards, inspect the sentry positions himself and dismiss each of them in turn, replacing them with his own guards. With this accomplished and that side of the castle left completely unguarded, twenty men were to abseil out of a window and disappear into the night. It would be a race against time as the dismissed sentries would return to the guardroom and here the alarm would be raised because there before them would be the real Rothenberger. It was hoped that a further ten men could escape during this time, and Mike hoped to capitalise upon the inevitable confusion, first by maintaining his disguise and pretending to give chase to the escaping prisoners, and if any guards caught up with him he planned to order them back to the castle to fetch reinforcements. Every moment of delay would allow the escapers to increase the distance between themselves and the castle. It was amongst the more audacious schemes that Colditz inspired, but the entire plan, however, hinged upon whether Sinclair could \"become\" Rothenberger.\n\nThere were a number of factors in Mike's favour. Firstly he spoke excellent German and, like Rothenberger, he had red hair. It had been noted that the German guards held Rothenberger, a veteran of the First World War and holder of the Iron Cross, in very high esteem and were inclined to obey him without question. Mike decided to rely upon this and, with great care taken over his costume and appearance, it was hoped that the poor light and make-up would obscure the fact that the twenty-five year old Mike was thirty years younger than Rothenberger.\n\nMike devoted every moment of the day to trailing Rothenberger, studying his movements and his manner so that he might copy them precisely. He also developed a thick Saxon accent to his German. The men who were to play his sentries, meanwhile, studied and practiced the standard guard drill so that at a glance there would be nothing suspicious about them.\n\nNo fewer than fifty men involved in constructing the necessary materials. The material for the uniform and great coats that mike and his men were to wear were made from bed sheets and dyed to the precise shade of field grey that the German military used. Wooden rifles were carved for the sentries to carry, the dimensions of which were accurately obtained from the rifles that the guards carried, and measurements quickly taken whilst the guards were distracted. A study was made of the hat that Rothenberger wore and a felt and string replica was created by the theatre's prop department. For the finishing touches to Sinclair's disguise, an imitation Iron Cross was cast from zinc, which a prisoner had climbed onto the roof to collect. The most striking feature that Rothenberger had to offer, his handle-bar moustache, was made from shaving brushes and carefully crafted to the right size and shape. Meanwhile the prisoners who were to abseil out of a window chose to base themselves in the old Polish quarters, and here they worked the bars on the window and made them so that they could be removed in an instant while, to the casual eye, appeared to be undisturbed.\n\nThe escape took placed on the 2nd of September 1943. After the 9pm Appell, the prisoners returned to their quarters, except for Mike Sinclair and his two sentries, Lance Pope and John Hyde-Thomas, who disappeared into the room above the sick bay to put on their costumes. The prisoners who were to escape were locked inside their quarters but, naturally, let themselves out using a skeleton key and proceeded towards the old Polish quarters. Stooges kept a close eye on the movements of the guards and reported that they were in place as usual and that Rothenberger had retired to the guard house. Mike and his accomplices were lowered down through the floor and into the sick bay below. The window here had been similarly modified so that it could be removed, which the three men quickly did and climbed out onto the terrace. Tension built for the observing British prisoners as Mike relieved first one sentry and then another, their places taken by the British men.\n\nThe same story was successfully repeated to the third sentry, and all that now stood between the men and freedom were the two guards at the gate, one of which walked above on the catwalk. This proved to be the most stern test of Sinclair's disguise as the lighting in this area was more prominent. Climbing up and on to the catwalk, Sinclair dismissed the sentry with his usual ease and then approached the final guard on the gate.\n\nThe two men saluted each other and Mike asked the man to hand over the keys to the gate. Presumably spotting an irregularity in this request, the guard made no move to do so. Mike repeated his demand and was consistently told, \"Nein, Herr Stabsfeldwebel. Nein\". Rothenberger had trained his men to suspect absolutely everything, however Mike did not falter but instead raised his tone and gradually the exchange became more heated. The guard asked to see Mike's pass, whereupon his voice grew even louder and more intimidating as he proceeded to scream at the guard in fluent German. Precious time was being wasted and Mike realised that the guard was not going to give in, and so he presented his pass. By a cruel twist of fate, the colour of the passes appeared to have been altered that very night and the pass that Mike offered was the old one. Up until now the guard had merely had his suspicions about Sinclair, but with an incorrect pass he had definite cause to resist and struck the alarm bell. Mike was furious and ranted further at the poor sentry and was still in full flow when other guards reached the gate. A German officer name Pilz was amongst the first on the scene and he in turn proceeded to shout at Mike.\n\nMike later recalled;\n\n\"His whole attitude was one to provoke and increase the tension and excitement instead of taking charge. Pilz drew his pistol and brandished it in a reckless and gleeful manner and obviously enjoying the possibility of using it. He screamed at me, \"Hands up.\" I put my hands up. He screamed at me again, \"Hands up,\" and I shouted back at him, \"My hands are up, they are high enough.\" He then repeatedly shouted a word which sounded like \"absehnalen\" to which I replied, \"I do not understand.\" Owing to the state of confusion I do not remember exactly when I was shot, but I do remember being extremely surprised that the shot should be fired, there being no reason for it. The shot was fired into my chest from a yard in front of me, and slightly to the left.\"\n\nAs the confusion began to subside, the prisoners were summoned to the courtyard for an Appell and the wounded Mike Sinclair was left on the ground, unattended, for nearly 10 minutes. This caused much anger and resentment within the prisoner contingent, with many believing Mike had been killed. The bullet that hit Mike had pierced his left lung and missed his heart by three inches. He was taken to hospital and recovered. Back at Colditz, however, feeling was still running high. The prevailing attitude amongst the prisoners at Colditz had always been one of utter contempt for their captors, and in view of the likelihood of trouble, fifty guards were ready at Appell the next morning with fixed bayonets. The British were not particularly intimidated by this and hurled abuse. For his trouble, one man was sent to solitary confinement. The Senior British Officer demanded that Pilz be court-martialled for having needlessly shot and unarmed prisoner. Officially, this was refused, however a month later, Pilz was sent to the Russian front and was never heard of again.\n\nDick Howe, the incumbent British Escape Officer later lamented his decision to not give Sinclair any specific order to quit if the plan went awry;\n\n\"To be quite candid I've taken the can back for it. I left the final decision to Mike himself instead of giving him a specific instruction to quit at the slightest sign of obstruction. What some chaps argued afterwards was that, knowing Mike, I should also have known that he just wasn't the type who would quit and I should, therefore, have given him an order\".\n\nMike returned to Colditz and immediately began looking for weaknesses to exploit for his next escape. Through his usual painstaking study of the German sentries and the timing of their regular movements, he had found a weakness on the terrace below the British quarters on the western side of the castle. The positions that the guards kept here during the day were altered slightly during the night so that their vision would not be obscured by the activation of search lights. It took sixty seconds for this movement to be completed, during which time guards were either being changed or not paying adequate attention. Mike believed that in these sixty seconds before the lights came on, he could jump from a second storey window and climb down from the terrace on a 90 foot rope, whereupon he would cut a hole in the wire and proceed down the 100 foot slope from the castle and into the town. It was believed that two people could escape by this method. The first man out was to be Mike, the second was Jack Best, a \"ghost\" prisoner who hid beneath the floorboards, emerging only when there was an escape in order to take the place of the missing man at Appell, so that the escaper should have as long as possible to make his escape before the alarm was raised.\n\nAfter several false starts the attempt was made on 19th January, both men were dressed entirely in black, complete with balaclavas. Gris Davies-Scourfield recalled the escape vividly:\n\n“At last, on the night of Wednesday 19th January, all went well… I cannot describe the tension in the room the actual night of the launch. I remember standing in the darkness by the doorway, seeing my friend Mike Sinclair lying face downwards on the table. He gripped the rope under his elbow, and round his waist he had the second part of the rope for the descent from the upper terrace. He was dressed head to foot in black, wearing a Balaclava and socks over his shoes. He had a large pair of wire-cutters strapped to the inside of one leg, then all the paraphernalia he needed for crossing Germany – a compass, maps, money, some train timetables, and everything else. One could almost feel the intensity of his fierce and single-minded concentration, remembering all the things he would have to do the moment he was projected through the window… Anchored to a bed-post was the first rope, made of sheets tied carefully together, ready to be lowered down two stories to the terrace some thirty feet below.” “Get ready, OK, launch,” from Tom to Dick. The rope of sheets was rolled out of the window and lowered, and away they went, one after the other. For several moments all was silent. Then we heard someone come out of the guard room and shout something followed by more silence, and eventually the floodlights were switched on. Meanwhile Mike and Jack had reached ground level by the second descent from the terrace, crossed the orchard, cut the wire and were away.”\n\nIt had taken them less than a minute to break out of Colditz.\n\n“We heard nothing of them for several days, and our hopes were just beginning to rise when, on 24th January the Germans came for uniforms in which to bring them back. They had got as far as Rheine aiming for Holland, like I had, when they were arrested and, as in my case, their papers declared to be false.”\n\nThey successfully reached the Dutch border but encountered difficulties in the town of Rheine, where they had to wander the streets at night while waiting for their train. As a consequence of this a member of the Gestapo became suspicious and arrested the two men. Best blamed himself for this because his clothes were black and these were considered to be an un-German cover, also he had been living under the floor boards for so long that his skin was extremely pale. Fortunately they were able to convince the Gestapo that they were escaping Prisoner of War officers and not, as was a very possible reaction to their civilian outfits, spies.\n\nIn April 1944 Mike learnt the news that one of his brothers had been Killed In Action at Anzio, Italy in February. Gris Davies-Scourfield recalled the effect this had on him:\n\n“Mike had been very strange, ever since he had learnt of his brother’s death at Anzio in February… This affected him profoundly and, from this moment, he became extremely moody and difficult… He wore an almost perpetual frown, looked well beyond his years, and I particularly recall the stems of his pipes were always quickly bitten through… Our comradeship became strained, and I failed him, really, just when he most needed my help. Any attempts I made in that direction were rebuffed…”\n\nBy September 1944 prisoners of war were being warned not to try to escape; in the aftermath of the ‘Great Escape’ – when fifty escapers were executed out of hand – it was simply too dangerous, and the war was won. All the prisoners had to do was await liberation. The Germans agreed; escapes cost them too much in energy and resources.\n\n“It began to look as if the war might suddenly end. Mike Sinclair dreaded that this would happen while he was still a prisoner of war; a failure after all the efforts he had made. He became even more morose and introspective than before. Even I, his old friend and comrade, just could not get through to him at all, and, to be frank, after a number of rebuffs I ceased to try very hard.”\n\nOn the 4th September, Sinclair joined the exercise party and walked down to the park with civilian clothes underneath his uniform, clearly he was about to make an attempt to escape. These clothes, however, were spotted and he was sentenced to fourteen days in solitary confinement. When compared with the elaborate nature of his previous escapes, an attempt to simply climb the wire in the park in broad daylight might seem somewhat crude, however escapes had been made from the park on many occasions and it was still considered a vulnerable area.\n\nOn the 23rd of September they put up warning posters: Escape from prison camps is no longer a sport.\n\nWith an end to the war was in sight and with the threat to kill escapers, many experienced escapers had decided it would be sensible to give in.\n\nDavies-Scourfield said of Mike,\n\n\"I might have guessed that this threat to shoot escapers would merely act as an additional spur to his endeavour, an extra challenge which he would almost certainly accept, indeed one he would be unable to resist.\"\n\nKilled escaping as a Prisoner of War on the 25th September 1944, aged 26.\n\nOn the 25th September, a week after his release, Mike was again with other officers walking down to the park. He wore a large French khaki cloak about his shoulders. His friend, Gris Davies-Scourfield, saw that Sinclair was about to walk off on his own and so he offered to keep him company. Sinclair rather rudely refused, saying \"No, I'd rather be alone.\" Davies-Scourfield persisted but got an equally flat reply, after which he gave in and walked off, not in the best of moods. He had no idea, but Mike was about to try another escape attempt. The only person who had an inkling that he was about to try something was Kenneth Lockwood, the treasurer, whom Mike had approached for some of the escape money, which he was given without any questions asked. He had not informed the Escape Committee, probably because the new conditions under which Prisoners of War lived may have led them to refuse consent for the attempt on the grounds that it was too dangerous.\n\nOnce in the park, the guards took up their positions and the prisoners, as usual, began a game of football. Mike Sinclair walked away by himself and was noticed to be close to the fence, pacing back and forth. After a few moments he took several steps back, removed his cloak and revealed civilian clothing underneath. He had a pair of large black gloves on, and with these he ran to the wire and quickly climbed over it. He was spotted by the guards and from all sides shot were being fired at him. Lance Pope, who had been one of Sinclair's sentries on the Rothenberger escape, cried out \"Nicht schiessen! Nicht schiessen!\", but the shots continued. Sinclair was over the wire and, keeping low, sprinted into the cover of some trees. In all, twenty shots were fired at him. One of these bullets hit his elbow and ricocheted into his body, through his lung and into his heart. Mike Sinclair died instantly. Unlike the incident when Mike was shot and wounded whilst posing as Stabsfeldwebel Rothenberger, no blame was put upon the German guards for his death. Regardless of the threats by the authorities to shoot escaping Prisoners of War, prison guards had always been fully entitled to open fire on men who were in the process of escape.\n\nWhat was going through Mike's mind before he climbed the wire is open to speculation. Some regarded his final bid for freedom as little short of suicide. His friend, Gris Davies-Scourfield, wrote,\n\n\"To him escape was a military operation and every factor had to be examined and thought through. He knew it would take a good shot to bring him down, and it was bad luck that it ricocheted into his body. He was just a person, braver than the rest of us, who was prepared to take a greater risk. He was too brave; if one can be too brave.\"\n\nTwo days later, Davies-Scourfield was going through Mike's possessions to pack and return them to his parents. He found a note that read, \"I take full responsibility. Safe home to all you good chaps.\"\n\nMike was buried with full military honours in the cemetery at Colditz. The Catholic prisoners held a mass for him. His coffin was draped with the Union flag made by the German guards and he received a seven gun salute. Later that day, 27th September, there was a memorial service in the Castle chapel.\n\nThe British regarded Mike Sinclair as their best escaper, but he also won respect from the German guards who, in reference to his cunning and hair colour, christened him The Red Fox. Captain Reinhold Eggers, one of the most successful security officers in Colditz, later wrote,\n\n\"If there is indeed a Valhalla for the heroes of whatever nation, if the men who go there are men of courage and daring, if their determination springs from one true motive alone and that motive is love of their country - then in our own German tradition, Valhalla is the resting place of Lieutenant Mike Sinclair.\"\n\nMike was the only prisoner to be killed during an escape attempt at Colditz.\n\nMike Sinclair’s parents placed the following obituary notice in The Times on November 3rd 1944:\n\n\"Passed into the Greater Life on September 25th 1944, whilst a prisoner of war in Germany, Lieutenant Albert Michael Sinclair, The King’s Royal Rifle Corps, very dearly loved younger son of Colonel and Mrs. T.C.

Registered at Hartley Wintney, Hampshire.\n\nLiving at Spoilbank, Mytchett Road, Mytchett, Surrey, 1929.\n\nEnlisted on the 11th of May 1939.\n\nThe Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)\n\nService No: 6088619.\n\nRank: Private.\n\nVolunteered for the Commandos, unknown date.\n\nWilliam served with 6 Troop, No.2 Commando.\n\nNo.2 Commando was reraised in February 1941 at Paignton, Devon by Lieutenant-Colonel Augustus Charles Newman. It was formed from men who had volunteered for the Independent Companies and the 1st Special Service Battalion 'B' Company. Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments and retained their own cap badges, with the exception of No 2 Commando who adopted the fighting knife as their cap badge, and remained on their regimental roll for pay purposes.\n\nKilled In Action on the 28th of March 1942, aged 21.\n\nOperation Chariot known as The Raid on St. Nazaire remains one of the outstanding acts of heroism in World War Two. More VC’s were won during the raid than at any other operation in World War Two that took same amount of time. St. Nazaire, on the west coast of France.\n\nThe operation was undertaken by the Royal Navy and British Commandos under the auspices of Combined Operations Headquarters on the 28th of March 1942. St Nazaire was targeted because the loss of its dry dock would force any large German warship in need of repairs, such as the Bismarck's sister ship Tirpitz, to return to home waters via either the English Channel or the Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom gap, both of which were heavily defended by British units including the Royal Navy's Home Fleet, rather than having a haven available on the Atlantic coast in Nazi-occupied France. The obsolete destroyer H.M.S. Campbeltown, had been packed with delayed-action explosives, well hidden within a steel and concrete case, and was to be rammed into the Normandie dock gates, while the Commandos attacked and destroyed machinery and other structures on land.\n\nOn the 26th of March 1942 three destroyers and 16 small boats carrying 622 men, left Falmouth, Cornwall, at 2.pm. and found the weather in their favour, as the crossing was smooth. The mini-force reached the mouth of the River Loire with few problems. However, the five-mile journey to the target was fraught with danger. To avoid sailing too close to the northern shore, the Campbeltown tried to sail more centrally and had to literally sail over sandbanks – scrapping the ship’s bottom as she went. Disguised as a German ‘Mőwe’ class destroyer, the Campbeltown managed to fool the outlying artillery gun placements. The huge advantage the Campbeltown had was that no one would have thought that such a raid was taking place. An added bonus was that British Intelligence had a copy of the signals used by the German Navy in ship-to-shore or ship-to-ship communication.\n\nIt was the diversionary air raid that made the Germans realise that something was happening and at midnight on the 28th of March Kapitän (Captain) zur See Mecke issued a warning that there might be a parachute landing in progress. At 1.am he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships' crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters. During all this a lookout reported seeing some activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour. Campbeltown had got to within about eight minutes passage from the dock gates when at 1:22 am the entire convoy was illuminated by the combined searchlights of both banks of the estuary. A naval signal light demanded their identification. The MGB-314 replied in a coded response obtained from a German trawler boarded during the Vågsøy raid. A few bursts were fired from a shore battery and both Campbeltown and MGB-314 replied: \"Ship being fired upon by friendly forces\". The deception gave them a little more time before every German gun in the bay opened fire. At 1:28 am, with the convoy 1 mile from the dock gates, orders were given to lower the German flag and raise the White Ensign. The intensity of the German fire seemed to increase. The guard ship opened fire and was quickly silenced when the ships in the convoy responded, shooting into her as they passed.\n\nAt 1.34 am on March 28th, Campbeltown rammed into the gates of the dry dock. The impact, at 20 knots, crumpled about 12 meters of the ship’s hull. The Commandos carried by Campbeltown disembarked and set about their work. However, the Commandos carried by the wooden motor launches had suffered very badly as they sailed with Campbeltown. Very little accurate fire was needed to damage these boats and very few Commandos from these boats actually managed to land. In total about 100 Commandos did get to their target. Divided into demolition teams and protection teams they faced a potential German force of 5,000 that was based in and around St. Nazaire.\n\nAfter carrying out their work, the surviving Commandos decided that their only way out – as few motor launches had made it to the pick-up point – was to get out of St. Nazaire and get to Spain – 350 miles away. However, the town was inundated with German troops and by 10.00 am most of the Commandos had either been killed or wounded and captured.\n\nMost of the Motor Launches were destroyed including ML192 which William Spaul was aboard, with only 3 making it back to England. During their fight with the Germans, the Commandos had fully expected to hear the Campbeltown explode, it was set for 4.30am. Clearly the Germans thought that the ship was safe as German soldiers were on board having their photos taken as a keepsake. The captured Commandos must have thought that their raid had been in vain as the ship had still not exploded after their surrender. The Campbeltown finally exploded at 10.35 am while a party of 40 senior German officers and civilians who were on a tour of Campbeltown were killed. In total, the explosion killed about 360 men. The wreck of Campbeltown could still be seen inside the dry dock months later when R.A.F. photo reconnaissance planes were sent to photograph the port. The explosion put the dry dock out of commission until 1947.\n\nThe St Nazaire raid had been a success, (the battleship Tirpitz never entered the Atlantic. She remained in Norwegian fjords to threaten Allied shipping until she was destroyed by the R.A.F. on the 12th of November 1944) but at a cost—of the 622 men of the Royal Navy and Commandos who took part in the raid, only 228 men returned to England. Five commandos escaped via neutral Spain and Gibraltar with the help of French citizens, and took a ship to England from Gibraltar. 169 men were killed (105 Royal Navy and 64 Commandos) and another 215 became prisoners of war (106 Royal Navy and 109 Commandos). They were first taken to La Baule and then sent to Stalag 133 at Rennes. The fallen British raiders were buried at the La Baule-Escoublac cemetery with military honours.\n\nBuried at Escoublac-la-Baule War Cemetery, Loire-Atlantique, France\n\nGrave Reference: 2. B. 16.\n\nThroughout the German occupation of France, Louise Jaouen, a resident of La Baule, dedicated all her time and energy to maintaining the graves at Escoublac-la-Baule War Cemetery. With money collected secretly from the generous local people she provided a cross for every grave and a small monument, had hedges planted, and employed a permanent gardener to tend the cemetery. Her devotion to this work was later honoured by the award of the King's Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom.\n\nRemembered on the Falmouth Operation Chariot Memorial, Falmouth, Cornwall, with the following inscription;\n\nOPERATION CHARIOT\n\nFROM THIS HARBOUR 622 SAILORS\n\nAND COMMANDOS SET SAIL FOR\n\nTHE SUCCESSFUL RAID ON ST.

When the Germans attacked on the 10th of May 1940 the 2nd battalion had moved into Belgium to the River Dyle. On the Dyle, the 2nd battalion held the Germans for two days until ordered to withdraw on the 16th of May, with Lieutenant Annand winning the Army's first V.C. of the War. By the 20th of May the 2nd Battalion was spread along the roads south of Arras when they were ambushed by German armour, and without heavy weapons their defences became a series of isolated and confused company actions. Throughout the next few days the British continued the withdrawal towards Dunkirk and by the 25th of May the 2nd Battalion Durham Light Infantry was digging in at St. Venant.\n\nKilled In Action on the 27th of May 1940, aged 27.\n\nOn the 27th of May the 2nd Division held off attacks by four Panzer Divisions (3rd, 4th, 7th and S.S.

They arrived too late to prevent the fall of the city and took up defensive positions at important bridges and junctions to help with the retreat in Belgium. The 7th Division were the first British troops to entrench in front of Ypres, suffering extremely heavy losses in the First Battle of Ypres.\n\nThe 7th Division fought in most of the major battles on the Western Front through to 1917 before being sent to the Italian Front for the remainder of the war. At the battle of Loos in late 1915, the division’s General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major-General Thompson Capper, was killed in action at the height of the fighting. Unlike the first six regular divisions of the British Expeditionary Force (B.E.F.), a third of whose strength was made up of regular reservists, the 7th Division was originally composed entirely of serving regular soldiers, which gave rise to the division's nickname, ‘The Immortal Seventh’.\n\nAwarded the 1914 Star, British War Medal 1914-1918 and Victory Medal.\n\nPosted to England on leave, unknown date.

On the 20th of May 1941 German paratroopers landed on Crete. After one day of fighting, the Germans had suffered heavy casualties and the Allied troops were confident that they would defeat the invasion. The next day, through communication failures, Allied tactical hesitation and German offensive operations, Maleme airfield in western Crete fell, enabling the Germans to land reinforcements and overwhelm the defensive positions on the north of the island.

As part of the Indian 17th Division (The Black Cats Division) were hastily sent into Burma during January and February 1942. Essentially, the division consisted of the 16th, 46th, and 48th Indian Infantry Brigades, plus troops, such as engineers and artillery, but the division was not a crack unit. As one writer has noted, “It had been in existence only a few months, training for the Middle East,” and was “pronounced unfit to face a first class opponent by India’s Director of Military Training.”\n\nTwo divisions of the Japanese 15th Army had crossed from Thailand into Burma in mid-January 1942, bent on capturing Rangoon before the British could land reinforcements and block the seizing of the Burma Road. Burma was critical to the entire Allied defense of the Far East. By taking Rangoon and then the Burma Road, the Japanese would cut the vital land link to China, where half of the Imperial Army was already tied down fighting Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist forces. Burma was also the gateway to India, and Rangoon was the key to everything. In addition to being Burma’s administrative capital, it was a crucial communications and industrial center and had the only port capable of handling troop ships. The loss of Rangoon would mean the loss of Burma.\n\nAs the Japanese 33rd and 55th Divisions pushed through Tenasserim, the 17th Indian Division would seek to delay the enemy advance at every key river barrier in an effort to buy time for reinforcements to land at Rangoon. The Japanese succeeded in taking their early objectives and by the 15th of February had reached the Bilin River, 35 miles below the Sittang River. The 17th Division was ordered to retreat from the Bilin River line and on the night of the 19th/20th of February they begun to pull out just as Lt. Gen. Seizo Sakurai, commanding the Japanese 33rd Division, sent his 215th Infantry Regiment, on a left flank attack in an attempt to seize the railway bridge across the Sittang intact. There were two clear routes to the Sittang. One followed a railroad track, and the other, further inland, followed the trace of a road. The latter was not paved, but Major-General Sir John G. Smyth decided to send virtually the entire division along the trace to the Sittang Bridge—and the 17th Indian Division was totally dependent on its road-bound motor transport. The Japanese, on the other hand, had few vehicles and could move rapidly overland through the jungle.\n\nWith the withdrawal from the Bilin already under way, Smyth outlined his plan for crossing the Sittang at a conference on the morning of February 21. A small bridgehead on the east side of the river was being held by the much-depleted 3rd Battalion, Burma Rifles. Smyth proposed to strengthen the bridgehead by sending the 4th Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment there in trucks ahead of the rest of the division, to be followed by Advanced Division Headquarters, engineers, and a few other units. Then the 48th Brigade would move to within 7-10 miles of the bridge, while the 16th Brigade stayed put at the Boyagi rubber estate four miles west of Kyaikto (a town about halfway between the Bilin and Sittang Rivers), and the 46th Brigade would form the division’s rearguard. Smyth envisioned no units crossing the Sittang on February 21, and the entire division crossing the bridge on the next day.\n\nThe 17th Indian Division’s withdrawal to the Sittang during February 21-22 was an agonizing experience. One historian commented, “The heat was intense under a cloudless sky and the dust thrown up by their boots and the wheels of the transport grinding along at two miles an hour completely obscured the track ahead and clogged the ears and throats of the soldiers. The men marched like automatons, seldom speaking as their throats were so parched…. Enemy aircraft flew low above the track, bombing and machine-gunning with deadly precision.”\n\nOn the afternoon of the 21st February, as the division plodded along the road from Kyaikto toward Mokpalin, a town just two miles southeast of the bridge, a disastrous friendly-fire incident occurred. Royal Air Force and American Volunteer Group planes appeared over the column and attacked it. A reconnaissance aircraft had mistakenly reported that a large number of vehicles spotted on a road heading toward the Sittang were Japanese, and both bombers and fighters were scrambled from fields at Magwe and Rangoon for an immediate strike.\n\nThe pilots did not realize that they were attacking targets west of their prescribed bomb line and that the Japanese were almost entirely lacking in motorized transport. The bombing and strafing went on for several hours, and by the end of it the 17th Division had suffered considerable casualties in personnel, plus the loss of numerous vehicles, pack animals, and vital radio communications equipment. The troops on the ground, thinking that the planes had somehow been captured and were being flown by Japanese pilots, had fired back and shot down two aircraft.\n\nThe Japanese, for their part, were also exhausted after weeks of campaigning, but they pressed on toward the Sittang, moving through the jungle both north and south of the retreating 17th Indian Division. A 15th Army operations order dated February 17 specified that the 33rd and 55th Divisions were to advance to the river and then wait for instructions.\n\nLieutenant General Shojiro Iida, commanding the 15th Army, stated, “I was then extremely worried … because of the increasing shortage of supplies. In order to pass through the rugged jungle of the Thai-Burma border, the quantity of equipment and supplies was reduced to a minimum…. Under these circumstances, it was quite impossible to attempt to march further forward beyond the Sittang.”\n\nThis was, of course, unknown to Smyth. And it did not prevent the Japanese from moving with comparative lightning speed in trying to reach the east end of the bridge before what was left of the 17th Division’s vehicles and most of its fighting men could. Units of the Japanese 33rd Division would succeed in covering the distance from the Bilin to a hill overlooking the bridge in just 56 hours.\n\nA flotilla of some 300 small boats had been assembled on the west bank of the Sittang to assist in moving the 17th Indian Division across the river. Three ferries also were moored on the east bank. Worried that the boats might fall into enemy hands, Smyth ordered his chief of engineers to destroy them, and the ferries were destroyed by Japanese Army Air Force bombing. The only way left for the whole 17th Division to cross the river was by the 550-yard-long bridge.\n\nAfter the very trying day of the 21st, leading vehicles of the division began to cross the bridge at about 02:00 hours on the 22nd of February. All went well for two hours, and then an accident occurred. An Indian driver of a three-ton truck mistakenly put his foot down on the accelerator instead of the brake, narrowly avoided plowing into an ambulance in front of him, and ran partially off the bridge’s planking. It took over two hours to clear the accident, during which time traffic on the bridge was at a standstill. Given the course of events, the time lost would prove critical. By dawn on the 22nd, the 17th Division was strung out over 14 miles between the Boyagi rubber estate near Kyaikto and the west bank of the Sittang.\n\nThe Japanese 1st Battalion, 215th Regiment emerged from the jungle at 8.00 am and attacked Sittang village. Meeting unexpected resistance there, the commander of the lead company decided to occupy Hill 135, also called Buddha Hill, which dominated both the village and the approaches to the bridge. Another terrain feature, Pagoda Hill, stood between the Japanese and the bridge, and an unsuccessful attempt was made to move past it and seize the bridge. The 4/12 Frontier Force Regiment and a company of the 2nd Battalion, Duke of Wellington’s Regiment counterattacked, driving the enemy off Pagoda Hill and rushing up Buddha Hill before being driven back by Japanese fire. The Japanese reinforced their positions on Buddha Hill and could not be dislodged, but their first attempt to gain the bridge had failed.\n\nThe fighting continued throughout the day on the 22nd of February and orders were received to prepare the bridge for demolition. Owing to a lack of explosives and wire only spans 4, 5 and 6 out of 11 could be prepared and this could not guarantee the bridge would be destroyed if the unit defending and preparing the bridge came under fire. Authorization was requested to blow the bridge before daylight and Major-General Smyth was woken and he considered the issue for five minutes before issuing orders to destroy the bridge. Smyth later claimed he was well aware that a substantial part of his division was still on the far side of the river. Eight infantry battalions plus most of the motor transport and divisional artillery were east of the bridge.\n\nThe bridgehead force was ordered to withdraw to the west bank, and at about 0400 hours on the 23rd of February 1942, according to his own recollection, Lieutenant Bashir Ahmed Khan of the Malerkotlas pressed down on a plunger and fired the charges. Spans 5 and 6 dropped into the river, and two-thirds of the 17th Indian Division was cut off.\n\nOn hearing the demolition, all firing on the battlefield momentarily ceased. Both sides knew what destruction of the bridge meant. The Japanese had no immediate plans to attack toward the bridge and did not do so on the 23rd of February. If any of the 17th Division’s Indian, Burmese, Gurkha, and British troops east of the river were to cross it, they would now have to swim or float on hastily constructed rafts. That meant abandoning almost all equipment, including small arms.\n\nMany Gurkhas, in particular, could not swim and drowned in the river, but some did manage to cross the destroyed bridge with the assistance of ropes. Brigadier Jonah Jones had at first hoped to delay an organized crossing until the evening, but the pressure of events forced him to schedule an afternoon evacuation. He was especially concerned that the wounded be accommodated on rafts, if possible. The Sittang is a tidal river, but February is the dry season and the river tide is low in the afternoon. However, a strong current in the vicinity of the bridge made swimming difficult as thousands of men took to the water throughout the day. Even strong swimmers averaged about two hours in the water to complete the crossing. Those who could not or would not attempt it were captured or fought to the death.\n\nWhen it was over, the 17th Indian Division was thoroughly wrecked. About 5,000 troops were dead, missing, or captured. Of the original division, there remained only 80 British officers, 69 Indian and Gurkha officers, and 3,335 other ranks. They possessed just 1,420 rifles, 56 light machine guns, and 62 Thompson submachine guns.\n\nThe Japanese, who were exhausted, waited a week for logistical reasons, then sent a regiment 18 miles north of the bridge to ford the river at Kunzeik, while three regiments crossed at the actual bridge site, where engineers had built a wooden footbridge across the dropped spans. They then drove on Rangoon, entering the city on the 8th of March 1942. So, for a variety of reasons, Smyth’s decision to blow the Sittang River Bridge proved both premature and ultimately unnecessary.\n\nKilled In Action on the 6th of March 1942, aged 41.\n\nThe surviving members of the 17th division then went to Pegu to refit and reorganise. When the Japanese encircled the division, it had to break out to the north which it successfully achieved and then moved into central Burma.\n\nWith the 17th Infantry Division decimated and scattered, the forces available for the whole of Burma were the 1st Burma Division and the 7th Armoured Brigade, equipped with American-made Stuart or \"Honey\" light tanks. The British commanders had already decided not to contest Rangoon, but their new strategy relied on convincing the Japanese that Rangoon would be heavily defended.\n\nBritish/Indian forces fighting at Pegu were the 7th Queen's Own Hussars, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), 2nd Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment, and surviving elements of the 17th Infantry; the 1st Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment, 4th Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles, 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles, and the 4th Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment.\n\nBuried at Rangoon War Cemetery, Rangoon (now Yangon), Burma (now Myanmar).\n\nGrave Reference: Collective grave 4.
