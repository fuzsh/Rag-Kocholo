        "text": "What is one thing that all great sports teams, companies, NGOs, communities, special forces units, and world religions have in common? \"A shared system of attitudes, beliefs, and practices about what is most deeply meaningful.\" In other words, they share a culture that elevates its members beyond themselves. For Pixar Animation Studios, it‚Äôs ‚Äútelling generation-defining stories that surprise and delight together.‚Äù Their brain trust is a no-holds-barred, best idea wins, a truth-telling gauntlet that every story must pass through. It‚Äôs a sacred ritual that every director and every story must pass through before release. For the Naval Special Warfare Command - Navy SEAL & SWCC Teams, it‚Äôs something like: \"facing suffering and death alongside trusted brothers in service of American values.\" ‚ÄúGetting Wet‚Äù is a ritualized initiation into this brotherhood. The trident is the symbol of their belonging and responsibility to this legacy. The bottom line: Meaning is what your culture is built on. The more meaningful your mission, values, brand, and rituals are the more buy-in you get from team, customers and stakeholders. https://lnkd.in/gXNkXFjx\n\nToday, as we remember the Battle of Iwo Jima, my mind goes back to a challenging day on an LST, leading a team during a fire on the USS Iwo Jima LPH-2. It was tough, but nothing compared to what the heroes of Iwo Jima faced. That day taught us the real meaning of readiness, teamwork, and looking out for each other. Dealing with that fire, we were all about unity and safety. It really hit home how crucial it is to be prepared and to lead with purpose. Although our situation was different, it deepened my respect for the traditions of the Navy and the unbreakable bond among us. Today isn‚Äôt just about remembering a historic battle; it‚Äôs about recognizing the spirit of dedication that connects all marines and sailors, past and present. Inspired by their bravery, we aim to live up to those ideals in everything we do, bringing those lessons of leadership and teamwork into our daily lives. Let‚Äôs honor their legacy by keeping those values alive, creating a culture where teamwork and dedication are at the heart of everything we do. #Leadership #Growth #Teamwork #Honor #Dedication #Leadership #ProfessionalGrowth #Teamwork #MilitaryHeritage #Dedication\n\nFrom My Service in Korea, I learned‚Ä¶ Robert E. Jenkins March 1953 - December 1956 My name is Robert E. Jenkins. I served in the U.S. Navy in the Korean War from March 1953 till December 1956. I was in the waters around Korea on two different ships (USS Fechteler DDR870 and USS Isherwood DD520). I was a radarman 3rd class. It was the job of the radar crew to keep track of all the boats and planes in the area and to protect the aircraft carriers. I learned a lot of responsibility and how to meet challenges. I never set foot on the ground until this Revisit Korea program. So what an honor and opportunity for me to visit South Korea, especially since I have a grandson that lives in Seoul and teaches English. I learned how much the Korean people honor our service to their country. There were young people and their parents that wanted to shake my hand. I was very impressed with how clean, beautiful and modern the country of South Korea is today. This trip was a dream of a lifetime and something I will always cherish. I was treated with such honor. Read more - https://wp.me/pbefWB-69D --- What did you learn from serving in Korea? Let us know ‚Äì Sharing your experiences from serving in Korea can be a powerful way to connect with others who have had similar experiences. By sharing your story, you may be able to help others who are currently serving in Korea or who are preparing to do so. You can share insights about the culture, the people, and the challenges you faced while serving. Your story can also help to shed light on the sacrifices that service members and their families make in order to protect our freedoms. So, if you have a story to share, we encourage you to take the time to put it down in writing and send it to KDVA.MyServiceInKorea@gmail.com along with any photos that help to tell your story. Your contribution may be just what someone needs to hear in order to feel connected and supported.\n\nToday, we conducted our PFA‚Äôs at advanced school and I have to say my marathon training has to be working. Overall I believe it‚Äôs about being consistent with everything and most importantly staying on top of it. As Marines we should always strive to be the best we can be every single day we put the uniform on and even when we‚Äôre not in uniform. The Marine Corps has been making changes, but we can‚Äôt lose focus on ourselves and especially the Marines that we lead. Don‚Äôt hide from Professional Military Education or course‚Äôs because it‚Äôs going to make you or your people more valuable to the team and organization. The smallest things can have a huge impact, so ensure as leaders or influencers we‚Äôre making time to make us better or a team member. #people #team #inspire\n\nUnited States Marine Corps Get ready for the ultimate test of skill and endurance!
