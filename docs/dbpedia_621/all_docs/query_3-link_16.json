Therefore, we, the Honor Representatives of the Cadet Wing, believe that it is essential for you to gain a basic understanding of the Code before you make the decision to enter the Air Force Academy. The statement of the Honor Code is very simple. It says--\"We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.\" This is the minimum standard of integrity which the Wing has set for itself. We believe that it serves as a foundation upon which each man can build a personal concept of professional ethics and a life-long sense of honesty and integrity. You should remember that if you become a cadet, you will be entering four years of training to prepare you for a career as a professional officer in the United States Air Force. Naturally, a high sense of honor is important in all professions, but it is absolutely necessary in the character of the military man. As former Secretary of War Newton Baker said \". .. The inexact or untruthful soldier trifles with the lives of his fellow men and the honor of his government ...\" The high standards of integrity which our country expects from its officers must be developed during your cadet years. We do not attach any special or unusual meanings to any of the words of our Honor Code. It is based on principles which every American has learned from childhood. We could not possibly list here all the ways the Honor Code applies to our daily lives. You will have to become a cadet before you can appreciate the feeling of mutual trust and respect that comes from living with the Code. However, to insure that you have a basic understanding of the Code, we will briefly define its terms. Lying is making an untrue statement with the intent to deceive or mislead. Stealing is intentionally depriving someone else of his property. If something does not belong to you, you cannot take it without permission from the owner. Cheating is taking unfair advantage of others. Certainly the people of the United States cannot be expected to put their trust in an officer who has cheated his way through his training. Finally, each cadet is morally obligated to uphold the standards set by the Honor Code. To fail in this, to allow other cadets to lower the integrity of the Wing, is to tolerate. The Code belongs to each cadet, and each cadet must be its guardian. Of course we do not require anyone to \"spy\" on another cadet; however, we do insist that a cadet who becomes aware of a possible honor violation by a fellow cadet take appropriate action. Normally a personal confrontation will either clear up the matter or cause it to be properly reported by the offender. We would not delude you by saying that it is an easy thing to confront another cadet and tell him you suspect him of committing an honor violation. However, we have a loyalty to the Cadet Wing that must come before our loyalty to an individual who would tear down the high standards of the Wing. Remember our profession requires moral courage just as much as it requires physical courage. Once a possible honor violation is reported, it is thoroughly investigated by the Cadet Honor Committee, the elected representatives of the Wing. If a possible honor violation has occurred, the case is heard by an Honor Board consisting of eight impartial Honor Representatives. Only a unanimous vote of guilty by the Board will result in the accused's being asked to resign. In all of the proceedings, every possible step is taken to protect the rights of the accused. The Cadet Honor Committee is not a police force; it is only a representative body elected by the Wing to administer the Code. We rely on each cadet's moral courage to support the Code and report violations of it. If honor violations were prosecuted by the Academy administration, the Code would eventually be looked upon as just another set of rules and regulations. Enforcement by cadets assures that our Code remains a cadet institution. Quite naturally you may be apprehensive about living by our Code. Let us assure you that almost everyone has the same feeling when he first enters the Academy. However, you will be given a complete series of lessons on the Honor Code before you are accepted as a member of the Wing and expected to accept our minimum standards. During this period you will come to appreciate the \"spirit of the Code\" and see that living under the Code is a privilege. Remember, too, that acts beyond those specified in the simple words of the Code's statement are not regarded as Honor Code violations. For example, no one is put on his honor to obey purely administrative regulations and rules. You will not find it difficult to live by our standards, especially when all those around you are doing it. In these brief words we have attempted to give you a feeling of our Honor Code. In closing, let us emphasize the simplicity of the Code. All that is expected of you is that you be truthful, compete fairly with others, respect others' property, and be so proud of the Cadet Wing that you will allow no one to detract from his standards. If you have any further questions regarding the meaning, administration, or function of the Cadet Honor Code, do not hesitate to contact us.

Approved For Release 2004/11/03 : CIA-RDP80601554R003600260006-3 A Message from the Cadet Honor Committee Of all the traditions which are proudly guarded by the Cadet Wing, the most prized one is the Cadet Honor Code. You cannot agree to become a member of the Cadet Wing without first accepting the responsibility of vigorously supporting the Honor Code. For those who are sincere in considering the Academy, we ask you to pause and reflect on what will be required of you under the Code. The Honor Code is taught and administered by the Cadet Honor Committee and supported by each member of the Cadet Wing. The Code is our way of life on and off the Academy site. Because of the profession we have chosen to follow, we cannot tolerate people among us who are unwilling to abide by the simple, straight-forward precepts of the Honor Code. It is not difficult to live up to the standards of the Honor Code. The Code is not based on a series of tricky definitions, but rather on a spirit of mutual respect and trust. There is a feeling of pride which comes from living in an environment based on such principles. This pamphlet offers a more complete explanation of the Cadet Honor Code. You should read it carefully. We salute you for your interest in the service of your country and wish you the best of luck.

A major portion of the Academy curriculum is devoted to academic subjects which cover the basic and engineering sciences, the social sciences, and humanities. In preparation for the academic program, the Academy strongly recommends that a student complete the following courses in high school.

The Academy does not endorse any specific educational institutions. College credits may be transferred to the Academy if the courses correspond to those in the cadet cOrriculum and acceptable grade level has been achieved. Cadets who have successfully completed college level high school courses, or those who have acquired extensive knowledge of a subject without taking a course, may take validation examinations after admission in an effort to obtain credit for comparable Academy courses.
