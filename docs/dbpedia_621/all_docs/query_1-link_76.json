The regiment comprises of upwards of 400 men, and 21 officers, including Colonel ATCHISON, Major HALL and Captain and Adjutant CAMPBELL. They left the barracks in Islington at 5pm amid the cheers of a large number of persons assembled to witness their departure. The congratulations of the populace were acknowledged by the men, the band striking up, \"Cheer, boys, cheer\" alternated on the route by, \"Annie Laurie\", \"Auld Lang Syne\" etc. The men proceeded in marching order to Edge Hill station being honoured on the line of march by congratulations similar to those which had greeted them on leaving the barracks. The scene of the barracks in consequence on the men taking leave of their friends and relatives, and children was a most affecting one. The men consoled them as well as they were able, bade them cheer up, and departed apparently in good spirits. At 20 mins to 7 the train started, amid the cheers of the spectators, which was responded to by the soldiers, the band playing, \"The girl I left behind.\"\n\n-------\n\nSOUTHPORT VISITER 1858\n\nFEB, 10th, In action at Cawnpore in the brilliant charge under Brigadier WILSON, Major STIRLING, Capt's MCCREE and MURPHY, John only brother of Mr Insp PICKERING, late this town.

Captain James RUTHERFORD of the old 94th Regiment or Scotch Brigade, which was disbanded at the conclusion of the war on a reduction of the forces, died at Liverpool on the 25th ultimo, in his 86th year. Captain RUTHERFORD was the last survivor of the officers who fought under the colours of that distinguished Scottish regiment in the Peninsula. He joined at the beginning of the war, and after being soon afterwards appointed to the command of the light company, was almost constantly engaged in out-post work, involving many severe encounters with the enemy. Besides these he took part with his regiment in the following important operations :- Siege of Cadiz, battle of Busaco, actions of Pombal and Redinha, lines of Lisbon, Massenais retreat, action at Sabugal, battle of Fuentes d'Onor, first siege of Badajoz, battles of Vittoria, the Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse. For these services he received the war medal with seven clasps. After retiring from the army, he held for many years appointments in the barrack department, and served successively in the West Indies, at Aberdeen, and in the North of England, embracing Newcastle-on-Tyne and Carlisle. He has now passed away at a ripe old age, leaving behind him the memories of those who knew him best the reputation of a brave soldier and warm-hearted friend\n\n----------------\n\nLIVERPOOL JOURNAL,\n\n27th, Jan 1877\n\nMilitary Funeral\n\nThe remains of Bugler Charles PIERCE, of the 17th Lancashire Artillery Volunteers was interred, with full military honours at St James Cemetery, Upper Duke St, on Sunday morning.\n\nThe members of the 12th and 17th, L.A.V, mustered at their headquarters about 8am, under the command of Capt John MC CABE, and marched to the deceased late residence in Harrington St, Toxteth Park.\n\nThe Officers present were, Lieut's ATKINSON and CLARK, Sgt Major BARRIS of the 12th L.A.V, and Sgt MC ILROY of the 17th L.A.V.\n\nThere were, parade 17 Sgt's, 226 rank and file, 30 bandsmen and 12 of a firing party.\n\nThe body was conveyed on a gun-carriage, drawn by 4 beautiful horses and the coffin covered with the Union Jack of the regiment to which the deceased belonged.\n\nOrder of cortege were, the firing party, band, gun-carriage and mourning coaches containing deceased relatives.\n\nThe band played the, \"Dead march\" in \"Saul\"\n\nThe burial service was read by Rev William BANNISTER, in the chapel in the cemetery, and the coffin bourne to the grave by 4 buglers, 3 vollies were fired over the grave.\n\nThe deceased was only 21yrs of age and was much loved by his comrades in arms, who, gave proof of their affection by the large numbers attending his funeral.\n\n-----------\n\nLiverpool Journal 8th Jan 1881\n\nTuesday's London Gazette contained the following\n\nDated War Office, Jan 4th\n\nPositions commence 5th Inst\n\n2nd L.A.V, the following Lieut's to become Captains\n\nWilliam Michael CLARKE\n\nGeorge TAYLOR\n\n2nd Lieut's to become Lieut's\n\nThomas ROYDEN\n\nEdward BOWRING\n\nEdward SMITH\n\nJohn STOREY\n\nWatkin Frank HURNDALL / HORNDALL?\n\n3rd L.

CUNINGHAM ROBERTSON, C.B\n\nAlexander Cuningham ROBERTSON was born in Edinburgh, Feb 8th, 1816, and was educated at the High School and University of that city. Having chosen a military career, he took service, while waiting to be gazetted to an English regiment, with \"the Spanish Legion\" under Sir De Lacy EVANS. He was present at several actions with the Carlists, was severely wounded, and received three Spanish decorations. In 1841 he joined the British Army, and went with the 34th Regiment to Canada, where during the prolonged winters he distinguished himself by his habits of application which bore fruit afterwards in several Staff appointments. He subsequently served in India, and took a prominent part in the Siege of Delhi during the great Mutiny, but, being prostrated with fever, he was not present at the final assault. After his return to England he obtained command of the 2nd Battalion of the King's now called \"Liverpool\" Regiment in honour of General ROBERTSON, whose later years were spent in Liverpool, where he displayed great energy in his management both of Militia and Volunteer forces. Liverpool and Edinburgh greatly lament his loss. He was not only a most energetic soldier, but also a man of much literary ability, he translated Tasso's great poem, complied the records of his favourite regiment, the King's and wrote many letters and papers in the public journals. He died on Tuesday December 2nd.\n\n-----------\n\nLiverpool Mercury, Dec 23rd 1891\n\nSamuel GIBSON, the last survivor of the rank and file present at Waterloo has died at the Metropolitan Asylum, Caterham, aged 101.\n\n-----------\n\nLiverpool Echo, August 13th 1892\n\n\"INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH\"\n\nAnother of the fast-disappearing hero's who survived the ever memorable, \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" - has answered the \"last muster\", and departed from all mundane strife.\n\nThe veteran was John DOYLE, who passed away peacefully at the Royal Infirmary, Pembroke Place, on Monday evening. The old soldier was suffering from an affection of the heart, and he entered hospital about six weeks ago, where he was carefully attended by Dr DAVIES, House Physician.\n\nThe old man who was 63, entered the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars in 1850 and passed all through the ordeals in the Crimean Campaign and afterwards the Indian Mutiny.\n\nThe slender recognition of a grateful country was scarcely sufficient to keep the old Irishman from actual want, and he was almost destitute at the time of entering the infirmary.\n\nThe only known relative of the deceased is a niece who has been communicated with by Dr DAVIES.\n\n15yrs ago DOYLE published a descriptive account of the famous charge, which is full of personal anecdotes and incidents, and is altogether no mean literary effort. It is probable that the old soldier's remains will be attended at the graveside by a military escort.\n\nA VICTORIA CROSS HERO DIES IN THE WORKHOUSE\n\nA soldier named Thomas FLYNN who distinguished himself in several battles, died in Athlone Workhouse, yesterday. His valour won him the Victoria Cross, pinned to his breast by the Queen. His case was mentioned in Parliament last session, and it was then explained, that it was FLYNN'S own fault that he had to find refuge in the workhouse.\n\n---------\n\nLiverpool Mercury, Nov 23rd 1894\n\nFuneral of Balaclava survivor\n\nThe remains were interred on Wednesday at Penketh, nr Warrington of Sergeant James DONAGHUE, a survivor of the Balaclava Charge.

He had the Crimean medal with bars for Balaclava, Inkerman and Sebastopol, the Turkish and French war medals for distinguished service in the light cavalry charge, also the Indian Mutiny medal and medal for long service and good conduct. DONAGHUE had a small pension, but was in such reduced circumstances that a few years ago he was an inmate of the Warrington Workhouse. He has left a widow who is practically destitute.\n\n----------\n\nLiverpool Mercury, 14th Jan 1899\n\nMilitary snippets\n\nOn Monday afternoon at Osborne the Queen presented silver medals for distinguished service and gallantry to men who served in the recent battles at Atbara and Omdurman.\n\nThe recipients were :-\n\nQuartermaster Sgt CHAMBERLAINE\n\nSgt Cook BROOKE, 1st Grenadier guards\n\nSgt W.

They are all young fellows and their faces bear bronzed traces of a prolonged sojourn in the East. Travelling by easy stages through the Mediterranean, the voyage largely helped to rebuild their heath. Hardly one of them was without a pipe in their mouth, and all appeared to enjoy their return to England.\n\nNews has been received from Uganda that Capt KIRKPATRICK an 7 men, where, on the 26th of Nov last, treacherously murdered at Nakwoi, 2 days march West of Birkoro.\n\nAt Fareham on Saturday, Henry SPURNER, a private in the Royal Marine Light Infantry, was committed for trial at Winchester assizes charged with the wilful murder of James WHATMORE his comrade at Browdown camp on Christmas morning.\n\n-----------------\n\nLiverpool Mercury Jan 5th 1907\n\nDeaths The interment took place at Toxteth Park, Cemetery, Smithdown Rd, of Sgt Insp J.
