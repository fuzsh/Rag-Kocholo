The following appreciation by \" A Friend \" appeared in the Daily Telegraph of 12 Sept. 1914 : \"It was a fine ending to a fine life, Victor Brooke was known, if only as Military Secretary in India, to thousands; but it was by tens of thousands that he was liked and loved. He was almost the first man wounded in the South African War. The welter picked up the diary of a wounded Boer, in which was set down the enemy's regret that so good a friend and fighter had been as they thought killed. Upon my conscience, I believe that the Boers who wounded him In 1899 will take an intentional awl bitter revenge for his death in 1914, when they came to grips with the Germans in South West Africa. As to the manner of his death anti burial, there is something to be recorded. He died on the night of 29 Aug. and he was buried early next morning at Chateau d'Annel, near Compiègne. The house had been turned into a hospital by Mrs. Depew. to whom most men who speak English will be glad to pay in full a willing debt of gratitude whenever and wherever the claim is presented. They left at eleven on the same day. I now quote the words of others : estate carpenter made his coffin, and one of the old men on the estate dug his grave. After the burial the old man said to Mrs. Depew, \"Regardez. Madame.\" He pointed out a gravestone to the north of the grave, which had the inscription underneath the date, 1870, \"Chevalier do la Legion d'Honneur.\"' It, belonged to one of the family which owned Chateau d'Annel in those days, all of whom were buried there. Beside them the old grave-digger thought it right to lay Victor Brooke—Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur indeed.\"\n\nExtract from Bond of Sacrifice Volume 1 Page 103:\n\nLIEUTENANT GEORGE BROOKE, RESERVE OF OFFICERS, IRISH GUARDS, was serving with the 1st Battalion of that regiment when he met his death.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Sir. George Brooke, Bart., and his first wife Anna, daughter of Geoffrey Shakerley, and niece of Sir Charles Shakerley, Bart.; he was also related to Viscount Monck, and Sir Basil Brooke, Bart. He was born on the 10th June, 1877, at Summerton, Co. Dublin, educated at Eton, and last resided at Ballyford, Coolgreaney, Co. Wexford. During the South African War he served with the Hampshire Regiment, and obtained the South African medal with three clasps. He was one of the first group of officers appointed to the Irish Guards when that regiment was raised in 1900.\n\nHe was wounded near the trenches at the Battle of the Aisne on the 7th October, 1914, when with the Irish Guards, and died of his wounds on the 9th October, 1914.\n\nAt one time he kept hounds in Wexford, and was much interested in the breaking-in of dogs for shooting. He was a member of the Kildare St. Club, Dublin, and the Guards' Club, London. He married, in 1907, Nina, daughter of the Right Hon. Lord Arthur Hill, P.C., and left a daughter, Nancy Myra, the only child who survived him.\n\nExtract from Distinguished Services Order 1885-1915 Vol. II, page 132:\n\nBROOKE, VICTOR REGINALD, Lieut., was born at 53, Eaton Square, London, S.W., 22 Jan. 1873, son of Sir Victor Alexander Brooke, Bart., and Alice Sophia, daughter of Sir Alan Bellingham, Bart. He joined the 9th Lancers 12 Dec. 1894;. became Lieutenant 29 April, 1896, and went to South Africa at the beginning of the Boer War (1899-1902 ). He took part in the Advance on Kimberley, including the actions at Belmont, Enslin, Modder River andMagersfontein; in the Relief of Kimberley; the operations in the Orange Free State, Feb. to May, 1900, including operations at Paardeberg; actions at Poplar Grove and Karee Siding. He was one of the first of our men to be wounded, and in a diary picked up off a wounded Boer was set down the enemy's regret that so good a friend and fighter had been, as they thought, killed. He returned to England to recover from his wounds, and had to have a finger removed. He passed the Staff College in the autumn; became Captain 6 May, 1901; returned to South Africa in Oct. 1901, as A.D.C. to Lieut.-General Sir Ian Hamilton, Chief of the Staff (9 Nov. 1901, to Mission at the end of 1904, when the Amur of Afghanistan bestowed an Afghan decoration on him. Capt. Brooke was given the Brevet of Major 7 June, 1905; accompanied the Amir of Afghanistan on his visit to India, Jan. and Feb. 1907, and was presented with the Afghan Order of \"Harmat.\" He was promoted to Major, 9th Lancers, 6 Feb. 1907, and became Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel 1 June, 1907, and was Military Secretary to Lord Minto from 1 June, 1907, until Lord Minto left India at the end of 1910, when he rejoined his regiment. In Aug. 1914, he proceeded to France, forming part of General Headquarters Staff, as Liaison Officer, with General Sardet's Cavalry Corps, during the retreat from Belgium. The following is an extract from an appreciation of Major Brooke in the \"Daily Telegraph,\" written by \"A Friend \" : \"As to the manner of his death and burial, there is something to be recorded. He died on the night of 29 Aug., and was buried early next morning at Chateau d'Annel, near Compiegne. The house had been turned into a hospital by Mrs. Depew, who left at eleven on the same day, owing to the approach of the German forces.

It belonged to one of the family which owned the Château d'Annel in those days, all of whom were buried there. Beside them the old gravedigger thought it right to lay Victor Brooke—Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur indeed.\" Lord Kitchener said of him : \"Victor Brooke is one of the best Staff Officers I have ever had, and quite one of the best all-round men to be found.\" When Lord Hardinge came home, he said to a friend : \"Victor Brooke was loved by tens of thousands in India.\" Lady Minto wrote : \"He was an ideal Military Secretary. An indefatigable worker himself, he had that rare gift of getting the best out of others. His example was such a stimulus to everyone to try and live up to his own high standard. Victor was beloved by the Viceroy and every member of his household, and no one was ever in his presence without feeling the better for the magnetic influence of his manly, straightforward character.\"\n\nBROWN\n\nRober Charles\n\nPrivate 4187, 9th Lancers (Queen's Royal).

Grenfell, Noel Edwards and many men fell that day. The Adjutant of the 9th Lancers, when writing to a friend some time after the 24th, referred to the incidents and said : \" It certainly was a bad day, but the regt. came out with much praise from everybody. This is some consolation to us for the loss of a great many friends, and in spite of losses the reputation of the regt. increases.

He was mentioned in Despatches (London Gazette, 19 Oct. 1914) by F.M. Sir John (now Lord) French, for gallant and distinguished conduct in the field. Capt. Wood, 9th Lancers, wrote : \" As you may know, 1 have been acting as 2nd in Command to him out here, and there is no officer in the regiment we could have spared less. I was not with him when he was hit, having been sent down to get stores from the base, but am told be was killed instantly, being hit in the head by shrapnel. It is a loss that is absolutely irreparable to us, as a regiment and more so as a squadron. After our charge in Belgium, where he undoubtedly was responsible for getting, at any rate, our squadron away, if not the whole regiment, he was so highly recommended that he would have had a V.C. or D.S.O. I cannot say more than that all his squadron sympathize most deeply with you, feeling, as we do, that, apart from a personal friend of the best, we have lost a leader in whom we had the greatest confidence and belief,\" and Capt. Francis Grenfell, 9th Lancers : \" Douglas' death will be a very great loss to my regiment. I am bound to say I admired him more than any other. He was so quiet and so cool, and yet had some magnetic influence which filled others with confidence and admiration. I was very fond of him. The last ride I had with the regiment was with him. We rode together and consulted each other for some time after we had got our-selves out of that confusion on the 24th. All my life I shall picture his calm figure. He was very kind to me and persuaded me to go to the Ambulance. I always thought he resembled Stonewall Jackson : he said very little, but in any emergency he was the one man to do a great deal. Of his military qualities we may safely say, ' We have never seen their limits.' \" Col. Campbell, 9th Lancers, also wrote : \" I have just had a letter from Beale-Browne, who says : Poor Lucas was killed outside the village of Bourg on the Aisne. The village had been taken by the 4th Dragoon Guards, and I was ordered to occupy a steep hill commanding the village.. . . The whole Brigade assembled on the top and de Lisle opened fire with his battery. The result was an avalanche of shells, one of which killed poor Lucas. He was buried in the churchyard at Moulins by Parry Evans, the chaplain who was with us at Potchefstroom.' The regiment is having a terribly hard time, and they are now doing the work of infantry and holding trenches alongside the Guards. No one can compute what Douglas' loss will mean to the regiment—he was my most trusted leader and a model to us all.\" General de Lisle, Commanding 2nd Cavalry Brigade, wrote \" I cannot ably express how greatly I feel the loss of your son, who was killed on 13 Sept. while leading his squadron of the 9th Lancers. I heard from Col. Campbell to-night from England, who writes : ' He was by far my best squadron leader—in fact, it would be very hard to find a better one for service.' Very high praise, but not higher than your son deserved.\" Unm.\n\nExtract from Supplement to the London Gazette, 9 December, 1914:\n\nCaptain Douglas Keith Lucas Lucas- Tooth, 9th (Queen's Royal) Lancers.
