        "text": "One of the pleasures of being on holiday is the opportunity to visit new places and to find unexpected things. While staying in Yorkshire recently, I found one of those things in the Church of St Andrew in Kettlewell, Upper Wharfedale. The church dates mostly from the 1880s, but with a west tower of 1820 [1].\n\nThe church contains no less than four stained glass windows that are also, at least in part, memorials to individuals that died in war. Two windows in the nave commemorate three members of the Holdsworth family that served or died during the Second World War, specifically: Major John Holdsworth of the King’s Royal Rifle Corps; Sub-Lieutenant Michael Holdsworth of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve; and Flight-Lieutenant William Holdsworth of the Royal Air Force. A stained-glass window on the south wall of the chancel is a memorial for Jane Elizabeth Cockerill and her son, Sergeant John Cockerill of the Royal Canadian Dragoons, who died in France on the 20th February 1916, aged 31 (he is buried in Bailleul Communal Cemetery Extension, grave ref. II. C. 158).\n\nThat leaves us with the fourth memorial, perhaps Kettlewell church’s pièce-de-résistance: the east window, a memorial for Lieutenant Charles Godfrey Haggas Cutliffe Hyne of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards, who died on the 21 November 1916, aged eighteen.\n\nThe window depicts a night-time scene. It has three main lights, the centre one depicting a ministering angel in dazzling white with an unkempt pile of soldier’s belongings at its feet. The left-hand light features two soldiers on alert, probably on sentry duty, while the right-hand light depicts an exhausted officer — identifiable as such by his Sam Browne belt — sitting pensively in front of a fire while smoking a cigarette — which perhaps seems an odd choice for the east window of a church! In the background of both side panels are additional soldiers, many seemingly in a state of exhaustion or slumber, their rifles stacked into miniature wigwams.\n\nThere is no dedication recorded on the window itself, but a nearby brass plaque has the following inscription:\n\nTHE EAST WINDOW\n\nWAS ERECTED TO THE MEMORY OF\n\nCHARLES GODFREY HAGGAS CUTCLIFFE HYNE\n\nA LIEUTENANT IN\n\nTHE IRISH GUARDS\n\nWHO AT THE AGE OF 18 ON NOVEMBER 21ST 1916\n\nGAVE HIS LIFE FOR\n\nTHIS ENGLAND\n\nLieutenant Cutliffe Hyne is actually buried in Kettlewell churchyard, but I sadly failed to notice his grave marker on my quick visit (it is a rough stone memorial with bronze plaques, rather than a standard CWGC grave marker). He died on the 21st November 1916 from wounds suffered on the 15th September. That was the date of the opening of the third phase of the 1916 Somme campaign, an action now generally known as the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. The battle is mostly famous now for the first use of tanks in combat.\n\nThis post will first summarise what is known about Lieutenant Cutcliffe Hyne’s life and military service. It will then provide an account of the 2nd Irish Guards at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, based on the battalion War Diary and Rudyard Kipling’s regimental history. A final section will introduce Lieutenant Cutcliffe Hyne’s father, who was a well-known writer and novelist. There are also two appendices that explore in more detail the attack of the Guards Division at Ginchy on the 15th September 1916 and the role of tanks on that day.\n\nCharles Godfrey Haggas Cutliffe Hyne:\n\nCharles Godfrey H C Hyne was born on the 1st December 1897 at Bradford (Yorkshire), the son of Charles John Cutcliffe Wright Hyne, a writer and novelist, and Mary Elizabeth Hyne (née Haggas). At the time of the 1901 Census, the family were living at 1, Oak Villas, Bradford. The household had six members, including three servants:\n\nCharles J. Hyne; aged 34; novelist and author; born Bibury, Gloucestershire\n\nMary E. Hyne; aged 32; born Oakworth, Yorkshire\n\nCharles G. Hyne; aged 3 born Bradford, Yorkshire\n\nCatherine M. Ebbott; aged 30, cook (domestic); born Preston, Yorkshire\n\nElizabeth Make, aged 22, parlourmaid (domestic); born Gibraltar\n\nMary A. Siddal, aged 29, nurse (domestic); born Althorpe, Lincolnshire\n\nBy the time of the 1911 Census, the family were living at 23 Park Drive, Heaton, Bradford. While he was only thirteen-years-old and still at school, Charles Godfrey was the designated head of household, presumably because his parents were elsewhere (most likely travelling overseas, as there seems to be no record of them elsewhere in the census). The household consisted of Charles Godfrey, his younger sister Mildred Nancy, and four servants:\n\nCharles Godfrey Haggas Cutcliffe Hyne; aged 13; school; born Bradford, Yorkshire\n\nMildred Nancy Cutcliffe Hyne (sister); aged 8; born Bradford, Yorkshire\n\nMargaret Laura Allin; aged 22; nurse governess; born St George, Camberwell, London\n\nLucy Cork; aged 43; cook; born Boston, Lincolnshire\n\nJennie Todd; aged 25; housemaid; born Jarrow, Newcastle-on-Tyne\n\nThomas Peacock; aged 26; butler; born St. John’s, Middlesborough\n\nGodfrey attended Bradford Grammar School from 1908 to 1911, when he moved on to Rugby School, where he served in the school OTC [2]. He was commissioned into the Irish Guards in 1916, apparently directly from school. According to the War Diary of the 2nd Irish Guards (WO 95/1220/1), 2nd Lieutenant C. Hyne joined the battalion on the 13th or 14th July 1916, when they were briefly based at Elverdinghe Chateau in the Ypres sector, shortly before a move to Camp P, north of Poperinghe [3]. He and a Second Lieutenant Denson were initially posted to No. 2 Company.\n\nAt the time of the 15th September attack, 2nd Lieutenant Cutcliffe Hyne was attached to the Brigade Trench Mortar Battery. The War Diary of the 2nd Irish Guards simply notes that Cutcliffe Hyne was wounded, but additional information is available from the biography on the Bradford Grammar School website, which seems to have been taken from the Rugby School magazine [4]:\n\nOn 15th September he was supporting the battalion’s advance to the north-east of Ginchy. Seventeen out of twenty-five of his Trench Mortar crews were killed or wounded. He was fetching ammunition himself, as nobody else had managed to get through, when he was shot in the thigh by a sniper. He saved his guns, although the other mortars in the Battery were lost.\n\nMedical records available from Findmypast enable us to trace at least some of 2nd Lieutenant Cutcliffe Hyne’s movements from then on. On the 18th September, he was admitted to No. 2 General Hospital (Le Havre) with a gsw (gunshot wound) in the left thigh, from where he was transferred to HMHS Asturias, presumably for repatriation to the UK (MH 106/1004) [5]. On the following day, he was admitted to Queen Alexandra’s Military Hospital, Millbank with a gsw and fractured femur (MH 106/1775) [6]. A note in the record mentions 26 Park Lane, to where he would be transferred at some point before his death on the 21st November 1916.\n\nNo. 26 Park Lane, a grand mansion that was also known as Aldford House, had been built in the 1890s for Alfred Beit, a South African diamond magnate [7]. After Beit died in 1906, the house was eventually sold in 1912 to Frederick Edward (Freddie) Guest, MP. It was his wife Amy, who was the daughter of the American industrialist Henry Phipps, that offered the British Red Cross Society the use of Aldford House as a hospital for officers during the war (the house itself was demolished in around 1929).\n\nThe Daily Mail of the 22nd November printed a short obituary, the headline referring to the most famous character created by the Lieutenant’s father [8]\n\n“CAPTAIN KETTLE’S” SON KILLED.\n\nLieut. G. C. H. Cutcliffe Hyne [sic], Irish Guards, died of wounds on Tuesday at the house of the Hon. Mrs Guest, 26, Park-lane, London. Lieut. Cutcliffe Hyne was the son of Mr C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne, of Bradford, the well-known author and creator of “Captain Kettle,” and at the outbreak of war was at school at Rugby. He at once applied for a commission, and after training in the school O.T.C. was posted to the Irish Guards. He went out to the front in April, and had taken part in some important engagements. At the great attack on September 15th he was in charge of the trench mortar battery. He saved all his guns, but 17 men were lost out of 25. He was himself severely wounded, and was removed to London. Lieut. Cutcliffe Hyne was in his 19th year.\n\nThe following day, a slightly shorter obituary appeared in the “Fallen Officers” column of The Times [9]\n\nLIEUTENANT C. G. H. CUTCLIFFE HYNE, Irish Guards, who died of wounds on November 21, was the only son of Mr. C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne, the novelist, and was in his 19th year. He was at Rugby when war broke out, and joined the O.T.C. there. He obtained a commission in the Irish Guards, went to the front in April, and was wounded on September 15.\n\nLieutenant Cutcliffe Hyne was buried in the churchyard at Kettlewell. A transcription of a report of the funeral published in the Craven Herald and Wensleydale Standard of the 1st December 1916 has been made available on the Craven’s Part in the Great War website [10]:\n\nKETTLEWELL OFFICER’S DEATH – IMPRESSIVE FUNERAL\n\nThe interment of the late Lieutenant G. C. H. Cutcliffe Hyne, of the Irish Guards, only son of Mr. G. J. Cutcliffe Hyne, the well-known Yorkshire novelist, took place with military honours at Kettlewell on Saturday. Lieut. Cutcliffe Hyne, who was in his nineteenth year, figured in a notable deed of gallantry which resulted in the saving of all his guns, but 17 men out of 25 in his gun company were knocked out. He was wounded about the middle of September, and was brought to the home of the Hon. Mrs. F. Guest, which was used as a military hospital, in Park Lane, London, where he remained for about nine weeks. About three weeks ago it was found necessary to amputate the right leg in the hope of saving his life, but the poison had obtained such a hold of the system that it proved too much for his strength, and on Tuesday evening, November 21st, at 6-30, he passed away.\n\nIt is thirteen years since Mr. Cutcliffe Hyne obtained his Kettlewell property, and since that time his son had loved his home and surroundings there, so it was decided that he should find his resting place in the valley. On Friday his body was brought to Kettlewell from London and was taken into the church and rested there until the following day, after a short service which was attended by a few of the parishioners. The service at the church on Saturday at 1-15 p.m. was very largely attended. A great number of very beautiful floral tokens had been sent by a large circle of friends and had been arranged around the coffin. The Vicar, the Rev. J.W. Cockerill, took the service and the Rev. C. H. Lowe, Rector of Rylstone, the Rev. J. Leighton, Rector of Linton, were present. The War Office sent down a party of eight non-commissioned officers and two drummers under the command of Lieutenant J. M. King, together with Lieutenant Bagenal and Second Lieut. Shears, brother officers. During the service the bearers stood to attention on either side of the coffin, and after the service bore it shoulder high to the grave. On the coffin were the sword and cap of the late officer. At the close of the service the ‘Last Post’ was sounded.\n\nThe service was a very impressive one and was attended by nearly ever parishioner and many representatives of the whole of Upper Wharfedale. There was a most sincere and deep sorrow for the loss of one who had endeared himself to nearly all who had come in contact with him, and universal sympathy for his family.\n\nThe grave marker at Kettlewell is a rough piece of limestone, with bronze plaques commemorating Lieutenant Cutcliffe Hyne, as well as his parents and sister. The Lieutenant’s plaque reads [11]:\n\nIN PROUD AND LOVING MEMORY OF\n\nCHARLES GODFREY HAGGAS CUTCLIFFE HYNE\n\nONLY SON OF CHARLES JOHN CUTCLIFFE WRIGHT AND MARY ELIZABETH HYNE\n\nOF HEATON LODGE – BRADFORD AND KETTLEWELL.\n\nLIEUTENANT IRISH GUARDS – BORN – 1ST DECR. 1897\n\nWOUNDED IN BATTLE OF THE SOMME – 15TH SEPT. 1916\n\nDIED IN LONDON 21ST NOVR. 1916 – BURIED HERE\n\nDULCE ET DECORUM EST PRO PATRIA MORI.\n\nLieutenant Cutcliffe Hyne is also commemorated on the village war memorial at Kettlewell, on the war memorial at St. John’s, Bierley, Bradford (a lych gate), the City of Bradford Great War 1914-1918 Roll of Honour, and on memorials at Bradford Grammar School and Rugby School.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards on the 15th September 1916:\n\nFrom the formation of the Guards Division in August 1915, the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards formed part of 2nd Guards Brigade, the other infantry units in the brigade being the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, and the the 1st Battalions of the Coldstream Guards and Scots Guards. The division had fought at the Battle of Loos in late 1915 before moving to the Ypres Salient They would move to the Somme in July 1916, initially based in trenches north of the Ancre around Beaumont-Hamel.\n\nFor the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, the Guards Division were part of XIV Corps, together with the 6th Division and the 56th (London) Division; the 20th (Light) Division were in reserve. This was the most southerly sector of the assault, and was where the much hoped-for breakthrough was anticipated. Cavalry, therefore, had been brought up in order to exploit any breakthrough.\n\nAt the beginning of September 1916 the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards were based at Morlancourt, a few miles south of Albert. Early in the month, they spent several days taking part in Brigade field days, in which they (and the other Guards Division battalions) practiced attacking in waves in preparation for the upcoming offensive.\n\nOn the 9th September, the 2nd Irish Guards started their slow move back towards the front, this time at Ginchy, as was detailed in the battalion War Diary (WO 95/1220/1) [12]:\n\nMORLANCOURT to HAPPY VALLEY. Sep. 9th [1916]. Bn moved to HAPPY VALLEY marching off about 1.45 pm. About 20 “TANKS” were placed near the camp.\n\nHAPPY VALLEY. [Sep.] 10th. Sunday. Quiet day. Church Parade.\n\n[Sep.] 11th. Quiet day. Companies under Company commanders. Commanding Officer (Lt. Col. REID) to Hospital with trench fever and high temperature. MAJOR ROCKE took over command. CAPT ALEXANDER rejoined Battalion.\n\nHAPPY VALLEY to GINCHY TRENCHES. [Sep.] 12th. Bn marched off at 2 pm, arriving CARNOY 4 pm, where men had dinner. Left again 8 pm, and relieved 4th G.G’s [Grenadier Guards] in salient EAST of GINCHY. A digging platoon consisting of about 12 O/R from each Company under 2/Lt CLOSE was attached to No. 2 Company. The trenches were poor, narrow and shallow. During relief 2/Lt ZIGOMALA was wounded, and there were about 10 other casualties O/R. Following officers were kept in reserve with 1st Line Transport. CAPT GREER, Lt DOLLAR, Lt BREW. CAPT WITTS was taken ill at CARNOY and exchanged with Lt BREW. Lt NUTTING to hospital and thence to ENGLAND with dysentry.\n\nGINCHY TRENCHES. Sep 13th. During day each Company had about 10 casualties from shrapnel, snipers, etc. About 5.30 pm 2/Lt VAUGHAN was killed and several men in No. 1 Company made casualties by a shell at T.14.a.5.3.\n\nSecond Lieutenant Kenelm Cuthbert Vaughan is buried in Bernafay Wood British Cemetery, Montauban.\n\nOn the 13th September, No. 2 Company would take part in a preliminary operation designed to simplify the upcoming offensive. As the War Diary relates, this operation was not a success:\n\n[GINCHY TRENCHES. Sep 13th]. 4.50 pm. At 4.50 pm OC No. 2 Company (Lt MONTGOMERY) received orders to make an attack on a portion of German Trench. For that purpose it was necessary for them to file into a portion of No. 4 Company’s trench and in filing across GINCHY-MORVAL road came under fire from a machine gun at T.14.d.5.4. which was enfilading the road. 2/Lt TOMKINS was killed while the Company was filing across the road at T.14.d.0.4. and sevreal men wounded at same place.\n\n5-6 pm. Owing to narrowness of trenches, snipers, etc. it was impossible to get into position until 5.50, at which time, the activity of German machine guns was quite unimpaired by our very feeble bombardment of the German trench NORTH of T.14.d.8.4. Our wire was uncut and it was necessary for our attacking force to go NORTH of the end of it at T.14.d.2.6. and then bear right handed towards its objective. At SIX pm the attack was launched Nos. 5 & 6 Platoons in the first wave and Nos. 7 & 8 in the second. The Company came under very heavy fire from machine guns and rifles. Lt MONTGOMERY was killed quite near our parapet and more than ¾ of the Company became casualties before getting ½ way across. The remainder then lay down under orders from […] 2/Lt HELY-HUTCHISON, the foremost party having reached a point about 30 yards from the German wire which was undamaged. At this time it was noticed that the attack of the 71st Infantry Brigade [part of 6th Division] had broken down. A report by MAJOR ROCKE commanding officer was made out and duly forwarded. The survivors of No. 2 Company – about 30 in number – withdrew after dark and were put in No. 3 Company’s trench. The digging platoons, who did not take part in the attack, remained in No. 2 Company’s trench.\n\nSecond Lieutenant Albin George Tomkins is buried in Guillemont Road Cemetery; Lieutenant Hugh Montgomery (of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards) in Guards’ Cemetery, Lesboeufs.\n\nAfter a quiet day on the 14th September, the Guards Division would attack at 6.20 am on the 15th [13]:\n\nSep. 14th. Quiet day. In the evening No. 2 Company returned to 1st Line Transport.\n\nSep. 15th. During the night of 14th/15th 1st and 2nd Brigades of Guards Division massed for attack, 3rd Brigade being in Reserve. 1st Brigade were on our left, 2nd Brigade massing on a front from about T.14.d.1.7. to T.14.a.8.3. The 3rd G.G. were right front Bn, 1st C.G. [Coldstream Guards] left front Bn, 1st S.G. [Scots Guards] right near Bn, 2nd I.G. [Irish Guards] left near Bn. Each Bn went over in 4 waves, each wave consisting of 2 half companies, except 2nd I.G. who had only 3 Companies (No. 2 having been sent to transport lines). No. 3 Company being split up between Nos. 1 & 4 Coys. Nos. 1 & 4 Companies thus enlarged each went over in 2 waves of ½ Companies, No. 4 on the right, No. 1 on the left. Acting on MAJOR ROCKE’S & CAPT ALEXANDER’S orders, the 2nd Brigade was moved [?] NORTH EAST of GINCHY & behind the front line […] held by Nos. 1 & 4 Coys during 12th/14th Sept. The wave [?] dug in during the night in shallow trenches about 10 paces apart. The massing of the Brigade was organised by 2/Lt GREER. The original plan had been that the TANKS should cross our front at 5.40 AM. The three allotted to our Division apparentyl did so on the left of the 1st Bde. At 6.15 AM the heavies’ bombardment started on German front lone. At 6.20 our creeping barrage started about 100 yards in front of our line and the first wave rose to atttack. The successive waves followed at a rather closer interval than the 80 yards orginally planned. From this point onwards map references are to Sheet 57.C.SW Edition 3.A. The Brigade hardly lost a single man during the night preceeding the attack, though a few gas shells and crumps were put into GINCHY behind [?] during the night. Before we had advanced 50 yards however the machine gun bullets began to work and casualties were heavy. The German barrage was behind us all the time, thus proving wisdom of MAJOR ROCKE’S massing [?]. About 200 yards away we reached first GERMAN trench (which consisted chiefly of shell holes joined together). Here the Germans fought very fiercely and for a moment the line advanced, the left having pushed on a little too far [?], and so suffered casualties from our own barrage, while on the right machine gun fire from trench at T.14.b.8.0. […] which had held up No. 2 Coy on 13th was causing us heavy casualties. Moreover the attack of the SIXTH Division on our right appeared to have been completely held up by the German strong point in the Quadrilateral at T.14.d.8.4. However under fine leadership of CAPT ALEXANDER and 2/Lt GREER the men swept forward again and killed enemy Germans in the trench. The fact that this trench lay obliquely across our front swung the 2nd Brigiade rather round to the left & one party under MAJOR ROCKE with Lt BAMBRIDGE & 2/Lt MYLNE found themselves amongst the 1st Bde. Reference will be made to this party later. In the first German trench 2/Lt GREER shot and put out of action an enemy M.G. The objective allotted to the Brigade consisted of the Germans FLERS line from a point just NORTH of the GINCHY-LES BOEUFS road at T.8.D.4.5. to the trench junction at T.9.d.6.8. After crossing the first German line about 120 men of every unit in Bde entered the trench with CAPT ALEXANDER, CAPT HOPLEY (G.G.), LT BOYD-ROCHFORT (S.G.), Lt M. TENNANT (S.G. attached M.G. Coy), 2/Lt GREER & 2/Lt LYSAGHT and started to consolidate it at about T.8.d.4.5. A few minutes later Col de CRESPIGNY (2nd G.G.) came up with about 50 Grenadiers & reinforced us. He took over the trench on the left of the road and commenced to bomb up it, while the remainder of us took to the right of the road and commenced to bomb up the trench towards […] LES BOEUFS, gaining 200 to 300 yards of trench. Col GODMAN (S.G.) then arrived & took over command of 2nd Bde. With him were Lt E. MACKENZIE (Adjutant 1st S.G.) & CAPT HON K. DIGBY (adjutant 1st C.G.). In the trench there were already the following officers of 2nd I.G.: CAPT FITZGERALD, Lt KEENAN, and 2/Lt CLOSE, of whom the last named rounded up about 50 prisoners. As we were working up the trench, more of our Bde dribbled in and Bns. were sorted out by Col GODMAN and given certain lengths of trench to hold. G.G. 60 on right, S.G. 60 next, I.G. 40 next, C.G. 10 on left in trench with 1st Bde. Later on CAPT SIR IAN COLQUHOUN (S.G.) patrolled down to the right up to about T.9.d.g.8. and reported Germans in trench NORTH of that point. During the afternoon mixed bombing parties worked SOUTH down the Germans trenches running from T.8.d.4.5. and T.8.d.7.6. and reached approximately the points T.8.d.6.0. & T.8.d.8.0. At about 5 pm the Germans made a weak counter attack from LES BOEUFS, which was easily driven off. Lt. M. TENNANT doing good work with his machine gun which was well placed in the night.\n\nCAPT PARSONS was killed just in front of 1st German line, as also were Lts PURCELL & WALTERS (attached to M.G. Coy). Lt BREW & 2/Lt M.R. FITZGERALD were wounded early in the advance. Later in the day MAJOR ROCKE and 2/Lt MYLNE were wounded in the advance up the […] German trench on the 1st Bde front: while 2/Lt CUTCLIFFE HYNE (attached T.M. Battery) was also wounded. Our casualties during the day alone in other ranks were about 300.\n\nAbout 8 pm the D.L.I. [2nd Battalion, Durham Light Infantry] came through our trench and made an attack on the German trench running South from T.15.b.9.10. which was only partially successful. The night was quiet, some wire was put up, and units from the 20th Div came up and dug in astride the [our?] parapet, preparatory to an attack on the German line from T.9.d.6.8. to T.3.d.4.1. which was carried out next morning.\n\n[GERMAN “FLERS” LINE]. Sep. 16th. Fairly heavy shelling all day on the [our?] trench, particularly heavy on the left. We were relieved that night about 11 pm & left the trenches 88 strong, went back via WEST of GINCHY & GUILLEMONT through TRONES WOOD &c to the CITADEL F.21.b. arriving 106 strong at about 2 AM. Lt BAMBRIDGE turning up later with another 60 men.\n\nThe battalion of Durham Light Infantry that moved through the Guards to attack the German trench late on the 15th September was the 2nd Battalion, which was part of 18th Infantry Brigade in the 6th Division. This is confirmed by the entry in the War Diary of the 2nd Durhams (WO 95/1617/1) [14]:\n\n15th [September]. At midnight the Battn moved to Assembly Area SOUTH of BOIS DE TRONES, in accordance with orders for 4th Army attack. At midday the Battn moved to GUILLEMONT-WEDGEWOOD TRENCH, then to trench held by GUARDS in order to attack communication trench leading to QUADRILATERAL. Attack was launched at 7.30 pm and about 500 yards of trench was captured. CAPT B. C. BATY, and 2/Lt R. J. MEIKLE killed, 2/Lt L. A. HARTSHORN, 2/Lt A.R. WATSON, 2/Lt J. DUDLEY, 2/Lt J. CRAWFORD and CAPT E. Hughes wounded.\n\nBoth of the officers killed in action were attached to the 2nd DLI from other battalions of the regiment: Captain Bertie Cecil Baty of the 23rd DLI has no known grave and is commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial; Second Lieutenant Robert Jardine Meikle of the 4th DLI is buried in Guards’ Cemetery, Lesboeufs.\n\nRudyard Kipling’s account of the attack of the 2nd Irish Guards near Ginchy on the 15th September 1916, as published in his The Irish Guards in the Great War, largely follows the account recorded in the battalion War Diary, but does provide some additional context about the attack as well as some reflections on what happened [15]:\n\nGinchy\n\nBut the idea of the battle of the 15th September was, as usual, immensely definite. Rawlinson’s Fourth Army was to attack between Combles and Martinpuich and seize Morval, Lesbeeufs, Gueudecourt, and Flers; the French attacking at the same time on the right, and the Reserve Army on the left. Immediately after our objective had been won the cavalry would advance and, apparently, seize the high ground all round the Department, culminating at Bapaume. The work of the Guards Division, whose views of cavalry at that particular moment are not worth reproducing, was to support the cavalry “on the above lines.” The 2nd Guards Brigade would take the right of the attack on Lesboeufs; the 1st the left, with the 3rd Brigade in Reserve, and the 71st Infantry Brigade [6th Division] on the right of the 2nd Guards Brigade. The 3rd Grenadiers and 1st Coldstream were respectively right and left leading battalions, with the 1st Scots Guards and the 2nd Irish Guards as right and left supporting battalions; each advancing in four waves of single rank; two machine-guns accompanying each leading battalion and four each the supporting ones. Three other machine-guns were to bring up the rear flanked, on either side, by two Stokes mortar-guns. The Brigade’s allotted front was five hundred yards to the north-east of Ginchy, and since the normal enemy barrage between Guillemont and Ginchy was a thing to be avoided if possible, they were assembled east of the latter village and not behind it. Their objectives were duly laid down for them in green, brown, blue, and red lines on the maps, or as one young gentleman observed, “just like a game of snooker except that every one played with the nearest ball as soon as the game began.” But every one understood perfectly the outlines of the game. Their predecessors had been playing it by hundreds of thousands since the 1st of July. They knew they would all go on till they were dropped, or blown off the face of the earth.\n\nThey dug themselves in on the night of the 14th in shallow trenches about ten paces apart, a trench to each wave which was made up of two half companies. The 2nd Irish Guards having expended one (No. 2) company on the 13th September, their No. 3 Company was distributed between Nos. 1 and 4 who accordingly went over in two enlarged waves.\n\nThe Brigade lost hardly a man from enemy bombardment during the long hours that passed while waiting for the dawn. At six o’clock on the 15th our heavies opened; and, as far as the 2nd Brigade was concerned, brought down the German barrage exactly where it was expected, between Guillemont and Ginchy, which, by German logic, should have been crowded with our waiting troops. Thanks, however, to the advice of Major Rocke and Captain Alexander as to the massing-point, that blast fell behind our men, who thus lived to progress into the well-laid and unbroken machine-gun fire that met them the instant they advanced. Their first objective (green line) was six hundred yards away through the mists of the morning and the dust and flying clods of the shells. A couple of hundred yards out, the 3rd Grenadiers and 1st Coldstream came upon a string of shell-holes which might or might not have started life as a trench, filled with fighting Germans, insufficiently dealt with by our guns. This checked the waves for a little and brought the Irish storming into the heels of the leading line, and as the trench lay obliquely across the advance, swung the whole of the 2nd Brigade towards the left, and into the 1st Brigade, who had already met a reasonable share of trouble of their own. Indeed, during this first advance, one party of the 2nd Irish Guards, under Major Rocke and Lieutenant G. Bambridge and 2nd Lieutenant Mylne found themselves mixed up among the men of the 1st Battalion. Moreover, the attack of the Sixth Division which was taking place on the right of the 2nd Guards Brigade had been held up, and it seemed as though the whole of the machine-gun fire from the low fortified quadrilateral dominating that end of the line was sweeping like hail into the right of the 2nd Guards Brigade. This still further, though they were not aware of it at the time, turned them towards the left.\n\nThe Battalion, without landmarks to guide, did what they could. Under Captain Alexander and 2nd Lieutenant Greer, the Germans in the first unexpected trench were all accounted for. Greer also shot down and put out of action an enemy machine-gun, and the thinned line went on. There had been instructions, in Brigade Orders, as to the co-operation of nine tanks that were to assist the Guards Division that day and would, probably, “start from each successive line well in advance of the attacking troops.” Infantry were warned, however, that their work “would be carried out whether the tanks are held up or not.” It was. The tanks were not much more in evidence on that sector than the cavalry which, cantering gaily across the shell-holes, should have captured Bapaume; and long before the Brigade were anywhere near their first objective, companies and battalions were mixed up, in what with other troops would have been hopeless confusion; but the Guards are accustomed to carry on without worrying whether with their own units or not. In due time, and no man can say what actually happened outside his own range of action, for no man saw anything coherently, their general advance reached the German trench which was their first objective. Its wire had not been cut properly by our guns, and little gasping, sweating parties dodged in and out and round the wings of it, bombing enemies where they sighted them. There were many Germans, too, in the shell-holes that they overpassed who fired into their backs, and all the while from their right flank, now wholly in the air, came the lashing machine-gun fire of the quadrilateral which was so effectively holding the Sixth Division. So the wrecked trench of the first objective was, as one man said, “none too bad a refuge even if we had to bomb ourselves into it.”\n\nThey tumbled in, as they arrived, about a hundred and twenty of all units of the Brigade with Captain Alexander of the Battalion, Captain F. J. Hopley, 3rd Grenadiers, Lieutenant Boyd-Rochfort, Scots Guards, Lieutenant M. Tennant, Scots Guards, attached to the machine-guns, and 2nd Lieutenants Greer and Lysaght, of the Battalion. A few minutes later Colonel Claude de Crespigny of the 2nd Grenadiers of the 1st Brigade arrived with about fifty men. They had fairly lost the rest of their Brigade in the dust and smoke, and had fetched up, fragmentarily, among the 2nd Brigade, at what was fast becoming a general rendezvous. Finding that the first objective still needed a great deal more combing out, the mixed parties of officers and men divided and began to bomb left and right along the trench. Then Colonel Godman of the Scots Guards appeared (it was all one whirling vision of breathless men and quickly passing faces), and took over general command of the Brigade. With him were Lieutenant Mackenzie and Captain the Hon. K. Digby, the adjutants of the 1st Scots Guards and 1st Coldstream; while Captain FitzGerald, Lieutenant Keenan, and 2nd Lieutenant Close of the Battalion were bombing and taking prisoners up an offshoot of the trench in the direction of Lesbceufs. The Germans who had fought so well among the shell-holes did not seem to be represented here for they surrendered with ease. Their own people machine-gunned them so purposefully as they scuttled towards our lines that sometimes they bolted back to the comparative decency of the trench whence they had been digged.\n\nMeantime the situation did not clear itself. The uncut wire of the first objective and the general drift of the whole attack to the left had made a gap between the two front battalions of the 2nd Brigade’s attack, that is to say, the 3rd Grenadiers and the 1st Coldstream. A party of a hundred of the former battalion were pushed up into it, and seem to have disappeared into the general maelstrom. At the same time, the 3rd Grenadiers were trying to get touch with the Sixth Division, on their sorely hammered right. Major Rocke, Lieutenant Bambridge, and 2nd Lieutenant Mylne and their party of the 2nd Irish Guards, were far out towards the left where the 2nd Brigade’s advance had outrun that of the 1st, so much that the 1st Coldstream’s left flank was in the air and there was a gap between the two brigades. Here Major Rocke’s party found Colonel Guy Baring (he was killed a little later) commanding the 1st Coldstream, and at his suggestion formed a defensive flank on the left of the Coldstream until the 1st Brigade drew level. This precaution was rewarded by a satisfactory bag estimated at over two hundred Huns who, being incommoded by the 2nd Brigade’s action, were trying to slip through the gap between the two brigades and escape round the rear of the 2nd Brigade, and who were mostly killed by small-arm fire.\n\nMore men kept dribbling in to the first objective trench from time to time (“Like lost hounds, only they’d been fighting every yard of their way home”), and the remnants of the battalions of the Brigade were sorted out and apportioned lengths of trench to hold. Thus: “Grenadier Guards, 60 on the right; Scots Guards, 60 next; Irish Guards, 40 next; Coldstream Guards, 10, on the left in touch with the 1st Brigade,” or, at least, as far as any touch could be made. The fighting, of course, continued all round them, and various parties devoted themselves to this as need arose.\n\nEverything was in the air now, left and right flanks together, but the Guards Division, as an extremely mixed whole, had pushed forward and taken the ground it had been ordered to take, while the enemy, attacking here, bombing there, and bolting across the shell-holes elsewhere, seemed to be desirous to pull out of action and break away towards Bapaume. Our guns, of which the righting infantry were unconscious at the time, had helped them towards this decision. There was some question and discussion in the trench as to whether they should now push on to their second objective or whether our artillery would, as originally laid down, bombard that before a fresh move. But signs of German withdrawal across the bare down and the sight of some of their field-guns trotting back suggested a sporting chance of pushing on towards Lesboeufs, which Captain Ian Colquhoun of the Scots Guards and Captain Lyttelton of the 3rd Grenadiers thought worth taking. Their view was shared by Major Rocke, Captain Alexander, and Lieutenant Mylne of the Battalion, so between them they amassed some hundred men and went out nearly half a mile into an unoccupied trench in a hollow, with standing crops in front. Here they halted and sent back demands for reinforcements. As they were utterly detached from an already detached force, they might as well have indented for elephants. The day went on, and the enemy, realising that our push had come to an end, began to steal forward in small bodies which first outflanked and then practically surrounded the detachment. At last a whole company, hidden in the tall crops, made a rush which should have killed or captured every one in the position. Somehow or other — and again no coherent account was ever rendered, but it was probably due to our controlled rapid fire — they failed. Our men fought their way out and back to the main body with surprisingly few casualties; and the enemy excitedly following them, came under a limited but well-directed machine-gun fire from the main trench. The Diary enters it as “a weak attack from Lesboeufs easily driven off, Lieutenant M. Tennant doing good work with his machine-gun which was well placed on the right.” But nothing is more difficult than to dissect and sift out the times and the values of linked or overlapping episodes throughout one desperate day, where half a dozen separated detachments are each profoundly certain that they, and they alone, bear the weight or turn the tide of the local war. The minuteness of the field of action adds to the confusion, when one remembers that the distance from Ginchy to Lesbceufs was about the extreme range of a service rifle and that the whole of that day’s work had won them about eight hundred yards. For that advance they had paid three hundred casualties among the men, and the following officers: Captain Parsons, Lieutenants Purcell and Walters, both the latter attached to the machine-gun company, killed; Major Rocke, Lieutenant Brew (seriously), and 2nd Lieutenants M. R. FitzGerald, Mylne, and Cutcliffe Hyne wounded. In addition 2nd Lieutenants Vaughan and Tomkins, and Lieutenant Montgomery had been killed in the preliminary work on the 13th September. A total of six officers dead and five wounded.\n\nA partially successful attempt on a German trench ahead of them by a battalion of the Durham Light Infantry a little after dark brought the very long day to an end. The night was quiet, while some units of the Twentieth Division came up and dug themselves in outside their parapet in readiness for the fresh attack which was to begin the next morning. Men could not help admiring, even at the time, the immense and ordered inhumanity of the system that, taking no count of aught except the end, pushed forward through the dead and the debris of war the fresh organisations which were to be spent next day as their predecessors had been. (“Atop of it all, when a man was done with he felt that he was in the road of the others. The same with the battalions. When they was used they was heaved out of the road like a broke lorry, and only too glad of it. But, as I was saying, when we was expended, we all felt ashamed of blocking the traffic with our wounds and our carcases. The only fun for us afterwards was telling them that came up what was awaiting them. But they knew — they knew it already!”)\n\nThe wounded Lieutenant Euan Louis Mylne, MC seems to have died on the day of the attack; he is buried in Guards’ Cemetery, Lesboeufs. Captain Desmond Clere Parsons and Lieutenant Graham Yuille Laundy Walters (the second attached to the 2nd Guards Company, Machine Gun Corps) are buried in the same cemetery — Lieut. Walters with a special memorial marked, “Believed to be buried in this Cemetery.” Lieutenant Charles Francis Purcell has no known grave and is commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing. Based on the information provided by the CWGC database, at least eighty-one members of the 2nd Irish Guards died on the 15th September 1916. Sixty of them (including Lieut. Purcell) are commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial; the remainder are buried or commemorated in: Guards’ Cemetery, Lesboeufs (14, including the three officers already mentioned), Delville Wood Cemetery, Longueval (2); La Neuville British Cemetery, Corbie (2); Serre Road Cemetery No. 2 (2); and London Cemetery and Extension, Longueval (1). More members of the battalion would die over subsequent days and weeks.\n\nIt seems that, like Lieutenant Cutliffe Hyne, Lieutenant Cyril Huleatt Brew also died from the wounds that he suffered on the 15th September. Lieutenant Brew died on the 12th October 1916 and is buried at St. Sever Cemetery in Rouen. He was the son of Richard Hugh and Dora Vere Brew of Chew Magna (Somerset), and is also commemorated on the war memorial there.\n\nSeveral of the other individuals mentioned in the War Diary account of the 15th September attack would not survive the war. Lieutenant Francis St Leger Greer, MC, died on the 1st Feb 1917, and is buried at Heilly Station Cemetery, Méricourt-l’Abbé. Lieutenant Maurice Robert Fitzgerald died in German hands on the 19 April 1918, and is buried in Leuze Communal Cemetery in Belgium.\n\nAfter being wounded on the 15th September 1916, Major Cyril Edmund Alan Spencer Rocke was treated at No, 34 Casualty Clearing Station and was later evacuated back to the UK, being admitted to Queen Alexandra’s Military Hospital at Millbank on the 20th September. Later in the war, he was promoted Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nCaptain (Harold) Alexander would be awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions on the 15th September. The citation, as published in the London Gazette, does not mention the specific action for which the award was made, but it obviously does relate to the 15th September attack [16]:\n\nWar Office,\n\n20th October, 1916.\n\nHis Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the appointments of the undermentioned Officers to be Companions of the Distinguished Service Order, in recognition of their gallantry and devotion to duty in the Field:–\n\nCapt. the Hon. Harold Rupert Leofric George Alexander, M.C., Ir. Gds.\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry in action. He was the life and soul of the attack, and throughout the day led forward not only his own men but men of all regiments. He held the trenches gained in spite of heavy machine-gun fire.\n\n[…]\n\nAs an acting Lieutenant-Colonel, Alexander would go on to command the 2nd Irish Guards at Third Ypres and Cambrai in 1917, and then at Hazebrouck in April 1918. At the end of the war, Major Alexander was second-in-command of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards. During the Second World War, he would rise to command the 15th Army Group in Italy, ending that war as Field Marshal and Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces Headquarters in the Mediterranean. As the 1st Viscount Alexander of Tunis, he then served as Governor General of Canada, afterwards being elevated to become the 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis.\n\nC. J. Cutcliffe Hyne, the creator of “Captain Kettle”:\n\nCharles John Cutcliffe Wright Hyne, Lieutenant Charles Godfrey Cutcliffe Hyne’s father, had been born at Bibury in Gloucestershire in 1866, the son of the Rev. Charles Wright Noble Hyne and Frances Hyne (née Wootton). The family moved to the West Riding of Yorkshire shortly after Charles John’s birth, when his father was appointed Vicar of St John’s Church, Bierley, near Bradford.\n\nCharles John Cutcliffe Wright Hyne became a popular novelist and writer, publishing as Cutcliffe Hyne or C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne, or under the pen name Weatherby Chesney. He was the author of a large number of novels and short-story collections, including what is probably now his most famous book: The Lost Continent: The Story of Atlantis (1900). He was also the writer of the once-popular, and long-running, “Captain Kettle” series of adventure stories, which were published in journals like Pearson’s magazine, as well as in books. Sometimes there were spin-offs, e.g. a play based on the adventures of “Captain Kettle” was produced at the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1902 and 1903, the reviewer in the Clarion sourly concluding that the title character, “as presented with grotesque posturings by Mr. Murray Carson,” needed “very little exaggeration to make it suited to pantomime” [17]. More recently, the “Captain Kettle” stories have been identified as a potential influence on Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness and other of his Marlow novels [18].\n\nCharles John Cutcliffe Wright Hyne married Mary Elizabeth Haggas at Keighley (registration district) in 1897. Mary had been born at Bradford in 1868, the daughter of Edwin and Elizabeth Haggas. The 1871 Census recorded both families living at Bowling, near Bradford (in that particular year Mary’s father’s occupation was described as a worsted spinning overseer). After their marriage, Charles and Mary would have two children: Charles Godfrey who — as we have already noted — was born in 1898, and Mildred Nancy Cutcliffe Hyne, who was born in 1902 (she would live until December 1999).\n\nMrs. Cutcliffe Hyne, née Mary Elizabeth Haggas, died in January 1938 and was buried at Kettlewell next to her son. An obituary was published in the Halifax Evening Courier of the 19th January [19]:\n\nDEATH OF MRS. CUTCLIFFE HYNE.\n\nBradford Author Bereaved.\n\nThe death occurred yesterday at the age of 69 of Mrs Cutcliffe Hyne, wife of Mr. C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne, the well-known novelist, of Heaton Lodge, Bradford, and of Kettlewell.\n\nMrs. Hyne was closely concerned for many years with her husband’s literary activities. It was the creation of Captain Kettle, his most famous character, that provided them with the furnishings for their home after they were married. The public clamoured for these exciting sea yarns, and, as her husband’s work grew, Mrs. Hyne did the bulk of the typewriting of serials, short stories, and novels from her husband’s manuscripts.\n\nAt one time she acted as his adviser, secretary, proof reader, and hostess, and once told an interviewer: “Toward the end of the month when we were hard pressed for time and the next instalment had to be in the hands of the printers, Mr. Hyne would sit at one end of the table scribbling away, and hand the matter to me, sheet by sheet. We used to work for six hours or so at a time, and during that period I typed ‘The Lost Continent,’ ‘Captain Kettle,’ ‘McTodd,’ ‘Thompson’s Progress,’ and ‘McTurk.'”\n\nMrs. Hyne travelled extensively with her husband in Switzerland, France, Spain, Italy, and North Africa, but she was not a good sailor and usually stayed behind when he took lengthy sea voyages.\n\nBorn at Oakworth, near Keighley, Mrs. Hyne was, before her marriage, Miss Mary Elizabeth (“Elsie”) Haggas, second daughter of the late Mr. John Haggas, of Ingrow. She married Mr. Hyne in 1897 before he had made his name as a novelist. There were two children, a son and a daughter, the son Godfrey being killed on the Somme in 1916 at the age of 18.\n\nCharles John Cutcliffe Wright Hyne died in March 1944, aged 78. After his death, a short obituary was published by the Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer. This provides some hints about Cutcliffe Hyne’s character, which was perhaps typical of some of his social class [20]:\n\nObituary\n\nMr. C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne\n\nMr. C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne, the novelist, creator of “Captain Kettle,” and a world traveller, inventor and big game hunter, died yesterday at his home in Kettlewell, where he had been living in retirement for some years. He was 78.\n\nAlthough generally regarded as a native of Bradford, Mr. Cutcliffe Hyne was born at Bibury, in Gloucestershire, and went to Bradford as a baby, when his father, the Rev. C. W. N. Hyne, was appointed Vicar of Bierley. He was educated at Bradford Grammar School and Clare College, Cambridge, where he took his M.A. degree and rowed in the winning University Trial Eight in 1887.\n\nBradford was rather the headquarters than the home of Mr. Cutcliffe Hyne after he left Cambridge, for he was a confirmed rover. Travelling on an average at one time of about 10,000 miles a year, he picked up material for his stories all over the world, visiting Lapland, Mexico, West Africa, Brazil and the Far East. He was said to have eaten everything from grilled mule to reindeer and drunk most things from jungle water to queer native brews.\n\n“Captain Kettle” Stories\n\nHe once stated that “Captain Kettle” was invented because the author was going to be married and wanted money to buy the furniture.\n\n“I write my stories anywhere,” he said on one occasion. “I’ve written them in the Atlas Mountains and leaning against a lamp post in Bradford.”\n\nHis first book, “The Adventures of Captain Kettle,” was published about half a century ago, and it became so popular that he had to keep inventing new stories about his character year after year.\n\nIn Yorkshire, his favourite pursuit was exploring caves. He also invented many gadgets, and formulated a scheme for reclaiming the land in Morcambe Bay.\n\nOn his 71st birthday, he told an interviewer: “There are more fools about than ever; young people are too soft; unless the softening of British backbone is checked, it will lead to the downfall of the British Empire; people don’t drink enough beer.”\n\nHe added: “I cannot drink as much as I used to do. I am out of training. I cannot get enough exercise at my time of life to work it off. No; I am not getting feeble. I walk and work 14 hours a day yet. In fact, walking in the country is my sole exercise, and I am too young yet to take up golf.”\n\nWhile living at Kettlewell, he took a keen interest in matters affecting Upper Wharfedale, and was a Trust Lord of the Manor of Kettlewell.\n\nHe leaves one unmarried daughter. His wife died several years ago at the age of 70. His only son ws killed while serving with the Royal Flying Corps in the last war.\n\nI have found no evidence that Lieutenant Cutcliffe Hyne ever served with the RFC, so this is probably a simple error.\n\nAnother, slightly more personal, obituary mentioned the east window in Kettlewell church that had been installed in memory of Cutcliffe Hyne’s son [21]:\n\nCutcliffe Hyne\n\nBy SUSAN BUTLER\n\nKettlewell will have lost a personality in the passing of Cutcliffe Hyne. He loved the little grey village in the fold of the fells, where he died, and one presumes that he will now rest under that limestone rock in the churchyard beneath which are the remains of his son who was killed during the 1914-18 war.\n\nThe beautiful East window in Kettlewell Church was given by the father in memory of his son.\n\nI well remember my first meeting with the author. I was ill and very tired, and seeing an open gate with a seat just inside I decided to rest there a few minutes, but only to hear almost at once a very gruff voice asking me if I knew that I was trespassing.\n\nI was easily frightened in those days, and when I mentioned the incident in the village everyone knew who had spoken to me. But it was only his manner. A more sensible person than I would have stopped and chatted to him.\n\nI met him many times afterwards and he was always agreeable and pleasant. I recollect that two men were discussing as to how Cutcliffe Hyne had came to name his famous Captain Kettle. “I don’t know,” replied one, “but he certainly did Kettle-well.”\n\nA profile of Charles John Cutcliffe Hyne was published in The Sketch of the 9th September 1903 [22]. This contained a one-page “photographic interview” portraying his life at Kettlewell, of which two photographs featured his young son, “Master Godfrey.” The photographs portray a largely-outdoor lifestyle and the wanton killing of wildlife, a theme which is corroborated elsewhere in the text:\n\nWithin five minutes’ walk of his door he [Cutcliffe Hyne] can enjoy trout-fishing in his own stream, for he is a skilful caster of the fly, while in a quarter of an hour he can be on his moors, grouse-shooting. Big-game shooting, however, is something he prefers, and his idea of the greatest pleasure on earth is buffalo-hunting in grass twelve feet high.\n\n[…]\n\nThe sportsman waits with his rifle and gets his first view of the buffalo when it is only twenty yards or so away, and he must shoot to kill or take his chance of a rapid exit to eternity.\n\nThe piece described “Captain Kettle” as, together with Sherlock Holmes, as “one of the two characters in modern fiction which have obtained an enduring hold of the public mind.” That no longer seems to be the case. Perhaps “Captain Kettle” (and C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne) was just too much a man of his own time?\n\nWhile the family do not ever seem to have been poor, the money made through Cutcliffe Hynes’s writing must have helped to contribute financially to the stained-glass window erected to the memory of Lieutenant Cutcliffe Hyne in Kettlewell church.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England — Yorkshire: The West Riding, rev.

The battle is today mostly remembered for the first use of a new British weapon, the tank – of which much was hoped. The offensive would involve both British Armies on the Somme, as well as the French. General Sir Hubert Gough’s Reserve Army was intended to have a largely supporting role at the start of the battle, while the main thrust of the offensive was supposed to come from General Sir Henry Rawlinson’s Fourth Army south of the Albert-Bapaume road. Fourth Army had three Army Corps, each with three Divisions in the front line. III Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir William Pulteney), comprising the 15th (Scottish), 50th (Northumbrian) and 47th (2nd London) Divisions, held the northern part of the sector around the Bazentins, facing what was left of the fortified village of Martinpuich and the parts of High Wood that remained in German hands (the wood had been bitterly fought over since the latter part of July). On their right were XV Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Horne), with the New Zealand Division, the 41st and 14th (Light) Divisions, east of Longueval and Delville Wood, facing the villages of Flers and Gueudecourt. The right flank was held by XIV Corps (Major-General the Earl of Cavan), with the Guards Division, the 6th and 56th (1st London) Divisions based in the area around Ginchy and Guillemont, facing the villages of Lesbœufs and Morval. Any breakthrough was expected to come in the XIV Corps sector, and two cavalry divisions were brought up ready to exploit it should the opportunity occur.\n\nOperation Orders for the 15th September attack were issued in Guards Division Order No. 76, a copy of which was attached to the War Diary of the Guards Division Headquarters (WO 95/1192/4), and also reprinted in Appendix IV of Cuthbert Headlam’s divisional history [1]\n\nA slightly more succinct version of the plan of attack was also outlined in a document (2nd.Gds.Bde.No.199/G) that was attached to the War Diary of the 2nd Guards Brigade (WO 95/1217/3). This specified the Guards Division’s four objectives and the broad structure of the attack [2]:\n\n1. The Fourth Army will attack the enemy’s defences between COMBLES RAVINE and MARTINPUICH on Z day with the object of seizing MORVAL – LES BOEUFS – GUEUDECOURT – FLERS.\n\nThe French will attack simultaneously on the right, and the Reserve Army on the left.\n\nThe attack is to be pushed with the utmost vigour all along the line until the most distant objectives are reached. The failure of a unit on the flank is not to prevent other units from pushing on to their final objective.\n\nAs soon as the final objectives have been captured by the Infantry, the Cavalry will advance and will sieze [sic] the high ground ROCQUIGNY – VILLERS AU FLOS – RIENCOURT LES BAPAUME – BAPAUME.\n\nThe Guards Division is to be prepared to support the Cavalry on the above line at the earliest moment.\n\n2. The objectives allotted to Guards Brigades are marked on the attached map [which is missing] as follows :-\n\nFirst Objective – Green (X Line).\n\nSecond Objective – Brown (Xa line).\n\nThird Objective – Blue (Y Line).\n\nFourth Objective – Red (Z Line).\n\n2nd. Guards Brigade will be on the right. 1st. Guards Brigade will be on the left. 3rd Guards Brigade will be in reserve. 71st. Infantry Brigade [6th Division] will be on the right of 2nd. Guards Brigade.\n\n3. The Brigade will attack with two Battalions in front, and two Battalions in support.\n\n3rd. Grenadier Guards will be right front Battalion.\n\n1st. Coldstream Guards will be left front Battalion.\n\n1st. Scots Guards will we right support Battalion.\n\n2nd. Irish Guards will be left support Battalion.\n\n4. Battalions will be formed up on a Company front in column of half Companies. Troops will be in single rank. Each Battalion will therefore advance in four waves.\n\n[…]\n\n6. Four Stokes Guns will be detailed to advance on the flanks of the ninth wave.\n\n1/S.G. and 2/I.G. will find carrying parties of 1 Officer and 50 men each to advance with these guns.\n\nHeadlam’s history of the Guards Division provides more information on the exact locations of the four objectives [3]:\n\nFour objectives were assigned to the Guards Division. The first of these – the “green line” – lay about 1,000 yards to the north and north-east of Ginchy, and ran in a south-easterly direction from a point just south-east of the Ginchy-Gueudecourt road to a point beyond the German defensive work known as the “Triangle.” The second objective – the “brown line” – the capture of which was to be effected by the left attacking brigade while the brigade on the right held firm, ran almost due north from the “green line” for about 500 yards and then swung westward towards the Ginchy-Gueudecourt roads. The “blue line” – the third objective – which was from 800 to 1,000 east of the “brown line,” ran from a point on the Flers-Lesboeufs road about 800 yards north-west of Lesboeufs in a southerly direction in front of that village. The fourth objective – the “red line” – lay just east of Lesboeufs.\n\nThe Guards Division were on the left flank of the XIV Corps, with the 14th (Light) Division (XV Corps) on their left, and the 6th Division on their right. The general direction of the Division’s attack ran on a relatively narrow-front from Ginchy towards Lesboeufs, with the boundary with the 6th Division a few hundred yards south of and parallel to the road connecting the two villages.\n\nZ hour was at 6.20 am on the 15th September. Headlam comments that the line from which the Guards were intended to make their attack was one “of considerable tactical difficulty” [4]:\n\nThe semi-circular and cramped position in which the two attacking brigades were placed rendered their advance singularly dependent upon the ability of the 6th and 14th Divisions to clear their flanks. It was obvious before the battle began that if the troops of these divisions were unable to make their way forward, the Guards would be exposed to short range fire from the “Quadrilateral” on the right and from the German trenches lying between Ginchy and Delville Wood on the left.\n\nAt 6.20 am on the 15th, the lead battalions of the Guards Division commenced their attack. The ground was featureless and the Germans defended with tenacity. An even bigger problem – at least for the 2nd Guards Brigade – was that on the Guards’ right, the 6th Division failed to capture the Quadrilateral.\n\nThere had been several preliminary operations that were intended to “pinch-out” the salient that included the Quadrilateral, but these had failed. T. O. Marden’s Short History of the 6th Division noted that on the 15th September, even the exact location of the Quadrilateral was unknown [5]:\n\nOn 12th September attacks by the 56th Division on the south and the Guards on the north reduced the neck of the horseshoe, or pocket, to about 500 yards, but could not close it. The situation within the horseshoe was undefined, and the exact positions of the Quadrilateral and other trenches were not known, owing to the bad flying weather. Even our own positions were in doubt, as almost every vestige of roads, railways and even villages had disappeared under the continuous bombardments.\n\nThe 6th Division attack on the Quadrilateral was, therefore, particularly dependent on the success of the new wonder weapon. Unfortunately, as noted by Marden, they were a disappointment in this sector [6]:\n\nIt was the first occasion on which tanks were employed, and as far as the Division was concerned was a failure, for of the three allotted to the 6th Division two broke down before starting, and the third, moving off in accordance with orders long before the infantry, had its periscope shot off, its peep-holes blinded, was riddled by armour-piercing bullets, and had to come back without achieving anything.\n\n[…]\n\nTo facilitate the movement of the tanks a gap of about 200 yards had been left in the creeping barrage. This gap unfortunately coincided with the strongest point of the Quadrilateral. The barrage, moreover, had passed over the German trenches by the time the infantry advanced; the latter had, consequently, to attack up the glacis-like slopes without any artillery support except the bombardment. This, owing to the enemy’s trenches not having been accurately located, was ineffective.\n\nWhile that 2nd Guards Brigade report argued that “the failure of a unit on the flank is not to prevent other units from pushing on to their final objective,” the 6th Division’s failure to subdue the Quadrilateral early on the 15th September meant that the Guards Division to their left would be subject to enfilade fire. The 3rd Grenadier Guards, therefore, had to form a defensive flank on their right, while the rest of the battalion moved to capture the first objective [7].\n\nOn the left flank of the Guards attack, the 1st Coldstream Guards lost direction during their attack, and were followed by the lead battalions on their right. According to Headlam, this established a gap in the line of attack just north of the Ginchy-Lesboeufs road [8]. On their left, the 1st Guards Brigade also managed to capture the first objective, even if it required the hunting horn of the 2nd Coldstream Guards’s commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel J. Campbell, to help rally their troops (Lieut.-Col Campbell would be awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on the 15th September). The 2nd Grenadier Guards, following up the 2nd Coldstream Guards, unexpectedly found a trench still defended by Germans, but they were able to take it and complete the Guards Division’s capture of the first objective, the “green line.”\n\nThe advance was then resumed, by then mostly using mixed forces from several different battalions. The 1st Guards Brigade pressed on to the “brown line” and then sent out patrols beyond that towards the “blue line.”\n\nOn the 2nd Guards Brigade front, the lead battalions unexpectedly encountered strongly-held intermediate lines in front of its first objective, which it later partly blamed for the brigade’s loss of momentum in the attack [9]. Despite that, the brigade did manage to capture and consolidate their first objective (green line) by around 11am.\n\nLater on, a mixed party that included Captain Sir Iain Colquhoun of the 1st Scots Guards and Captain Oliver Lyttleton (the future Lord Chandos), adjutant of the 3rd Grenadiers, pushed out around 800 yards towards Lesboeufs. Colquhoun later recorded this action in his diary [10]:\n\nBetween us we got up a composite company of every regiment and advancing out of the trench took up a position on the high ground overlooking Lesboeufs. I went down along the trench to try and get reinforcements and take Lesboeufs.\n\nReinforcements were, however, not forthcoming. At around 5 pm, the Germans began to push back in an attempt to rush the trench. Headlam records that, “after a strenuous struggle, this gallant little band of Guardsmen succeeded in effecting its withdrawal to the main position, having suffered singularly few casualties, considering the violent nature of the attack to which it had been subjected” [11].\n\nFrom that point on, until their relief by the 61st Infantry Brigade (6th Division) on the 16th September, the remaining Guards did what they could to consolidate and hold the line that they had captured on the 15th with heavy casualties.\n\nThe end result of the 15th September attack was that the Guards Division had managed to capture most of its first and second objectives, but found it difficult to advance much beyond them. While an advance party of the 2nd Guards Brigade managed to hold out for a long time, they remained some distance short of the third objective. Lesboeufs would remain out of reach until its capture by the Guards on the 25th September.\n\nThe diary of Captain Colquhoun of the 1st Scots Guards, extracts from which have been published in Malcom Brown’s Imperial War Museum book of the Somme, contains a perceptive account of the 15th September attack in the 2nd Guards Brigade area [12]:\n\nSept. 14th. At 10.30 the Colonel gave out orders for attack. We attack at dawn tomorrow, and lie out all previous night. Very busy day explaining everything to Coys issuing rations and the hundred and one things we carry. It is still showery and wet. Rather a horrible day as everyone is on edge, and the waiting gets on one’s nerves. The Cavalry are all behind waiting and this is the biggest show there has been on the Western Front, but it appears to me there is very little stuffing behind it. However, I hope for the best.\n\nParaded at 11 p.m. and marched up behind [3rd] Coldstream and [3rd] Grenadiers to our position just N.E. of Ginchy. The whole road is crowded with transport and troops of all sorts. A few tear shells troubled us near Guillemont. Through Guillemont and Ginchy the whole countryside is devastated in a way it is almost impossible to believe. Dead lie everywhere in Ginchy, and the smell is horrible. Halted at [2nd] Irish Guards H.Q. where Roche [i.e. Major Rocke] told us what to do. The Company was then led up at about half a mile per hour to a position N.E. of Ginchy. It is a flat piece of ground behind our present Front Line and one maze of shell holes. We are supposed to attack in 16 waves of which my Coy is the 5th.\n\nSept. 15th. Started digging 2.30 a.m., finished 3.15 a.m. Went round all my Company to see they were all in their right places, etc. Anyone can see that there must be a hopeless confusion when we start. Lay down in a shell hole at 4 a.m. About 4.30 a.m. the Tanks began to arrive behind us. The Germans heard them and sent up many rockets and shelled slightly. At 5.40 a.m. the Tanks started and went through our front line. At 6.30 a.m. the entire British Line advanced, the 1st Guards Brigade on our left, the 6th Division on our right. As we anticipated the entire wave formation had disappeared before we had crossed our own front lines, and we advanced in a great mass, Grenadiers, Coldstream, Irish and Scots Guards all inextricably mixed up. Within 30 yds I found myself in front of the Grenadiers [the lead battalion] with a few of my men. Our barrage was about 50 yds in front of us, and the whole landscape was obscured by smoke, and it was impossible to see anything or keep direction. About 100 yds on we found a few Germans lying in shell holes. I shot one and clubbed one. We then came under heavy machine-gun fire, and the Lines disappeared into shell holes.\n\nThe Lines again [moved – word unclear] on, passed over a German Line which no-one knew existed, and came under heavy fire from German 1st Line. Many men began to fall, and the Coldstream lost almost their whole Batt. By walking into our own barrage. The lines began to move in parts, some swinging to the right, and others to the left, and eventually everyone got into shell holes. In 10 minutes, we were off again, and the officers took charge of any men they could see, and began to try and get some order and direction.”\n\nPerhaps the final word should be left to Prior and Wilson [13]:\n\nThe Guards had gained 2,000 yards on a 1,500-yard front, quite a feat in the circumstances. But this did not alter the fact that Haig’s conception even now lay in ruins. The distant villages which were meant to be in British hands before the cavalry went forward were still 2,000 yards away. Along the whole of the XIV Corps’ front, only the Guards had captured even their first objective.\n\nCasualties:\n\nPerhaps the most well-known Guards Division casualty of the 15th September attack would be Lieutenant Raymond Asquith of the 3rd Grenadier Guards, who (like the 2nd Irish Guards) were also part of the 2nd Guards Brigade. Lieutenant Asquith was the eldest son the Prime Minister, Henry Herbert Asquith, and was second-in-command of No. 4 Company of his battalion during the battle. He was killed very shortly after his company went into the attack, as noted by the battalion War Diary of the 3rd Grenadier Guards (WO 95/1219/1) [14]:\n\nAt 6.19 ½ am the whole Brigade rose to its feet and advanced. Our left front company was met by machine gun fire as soon as they got up and lost Capt MACKENZIE and Lt ASQUITH at once. 2/Lt H. WILLIAMS was wounded a few yards further on. The last remaining officer of that company also fell within 200 yards of our own trenches.\n\nThe episode is also recounted in Sir Frederick Ponsonby’s Grenadier Guards in the Great War [15]:\n\nAlmost at the outset Captain A. K. Mackenzie was hit and fell, as he led his company to the attack. Though mortally wounded , he got up again and struggled on, still waving his men forward. Once more he fell, and this time was unable to rise, but even then he managed to raise himself on one knee and cheer the company on. Afterwards he was carried down on a stretcher, but never recovered and died in the ambulance on the way. About the same time Lieutenant Raymond Asquith was shot through the chest and killed as he led the first half of No. 4 Company. He had endeared himself to both officers and men in an extraordinary degree since he joined the regiment at the beginning of the war, and his preference of service with his Battalion to the good staff appointment which he had just given up had won the admiration of all ranks.\n\nAs well as the son of the serving Prime Minister, a few hundred-yards to the north was a man that would succeed to that role forty-years afterwards. Lieutenant Maurice Harold Macmillan was serving with No. 3 Company of the 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards (1st Guards Brigade) and was wounded twice on the 15th September [16]:\n\nWhen the Battalion reached Ginchy a heavy German barrage came down on the men, who were almost blinded by the shells. Fortunately, the bulk of the barrage was chiefly on the south side of the village, but huge shells, bursting at the appalling rate of one a second, were shooting up showers of mud in every direction, and the noise was deafening. All this in addition to a fierce rifle fire, which came from the right rear. Though the softness of the ground prevented many shells from exploding, there were naturally a considerable number of casualties. Captain M. K. A. Lloyd was killed as he came along with his half company through the barrage, and Lieutenant Macmillan was slightly wounded in the knee, but was able to go on. Lieutenant Hasler, who was severely wounded in the stomach, never recovered from his wound, and about the same time Second Lieutenant J. Arbuthnott was also fatally wounded.\n\nLater on, the 2nd Grenadier Guards pushed on and found themselves isolated from, and in advance of, the two battalions of Coldstream Guards who were leading the advance, encountering a trench full of Germans in what should have been the brigade’s first objective [17].\n\nThe companies on the right pushed on into the Green line, the first objective, and there gained touch with the 3rd Battalion Grenadiers in Ponsonby’s Brigade [2nd Guards Brigade], which was attempting to stop the Germans turning its right flank. Here Lieutenant Jesper was wounded, and Lieutenant Macmillan, who had gone on in spite of the wound in his knee, was struck a second time in the left thigh. The attack of the Division on the right had failed, with the result that the right flank of the Guards Division was dangerously in the air. On the left there was a considerable gap, which caused great trouble, as it happened to be opposite one of the enemy’s strong points. Lieutenant A. T. A. Ritchie was wounded as he was trying to deal with this difficult situation, and Sergeant Lyon, who took charge of his platoon, was soon afterwards shot through the head.\n\nLieutenant Macmillan would remain for over twelve hours in a shell hole, as recounted by his official biographer [18]:\n\nHe lay in the shell-hole all morning, while the tide of battle flowed back and forth around him – lying ‘doggo’ and pretending to be dead when any Germans came near, lest they be tempted to ‘despatch’ him. Though realising that he had been seriously wounded, he was surprised to discover that – unlike the far less dangerous wound through his hand at Loos – ‘which was excruciatingly painful, this body blow knocked me out but did not hurt’. Remembering that he had in his pocket a copy of Aeschylus’s Prometheus (in Greek), which Nellie had sent him, he fell to reading it intermittently; ‘It was a play I knew well, and seemed not inappropriate to my position.’\n\nWhile that was not the end of Macmillan’s immediate troubles, although his wounds were serious enough to ensure that his war was over.\n\nNorth of Ginchy in the 41st Division area was yet another future Prime Minister: Second Lieutenant Anthony Eden of the 21st (Yeoman) Battalion, King’s Royal Rifle Corps.\n\nSecond Lieutenant Geoffrey Philip Agnew Fildes, one of the officers of the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards (1st Guards Brigade) that had been deliberately left behind the front at the transport lines for the 15th September attack, published an account of his experiences of war. In this, he portrayed a vivid account of the return of the remnants of his battalion on the day after the attack [19]:\n\nAs everything was in readiness for their immediate occupation of this “Citadel” Camp, we strolled out along the track by which the battalion was expected to arrive. The early morning was somewhat squally; scudding clouds swept low overhead, veiling from time to time the struggling sunshine; and the air was fresh with the lingering chill of night. As we walked slowly up a slope in the neighbourhood of our lines, our ears were strained for the first sound of “The Drums,” for they had long since proceeded to Carnoy in order to play the survivors in.\n\nOver the skyline presently glided a cyclist, who, on catching sight of us, pedalled swiftly forward. From him we learned a few minutes later that our battalion was now only a mile distant, preceded by its sister battalion in the brigade. After a brief consultation, we agreed to remain where we were, so as to be near the hues, for several tracks converged here from the direction of their march.\n\nNot many minutes had elapsed before the breeze wafted to our ears the intermittent throb of drums; the sound seemed under the circumstances intensely dramatic. Rising and falling on the wind, its mutterings at first grew no louder, and thus, rolling toward us from the invisible country beyond, it seemed almost ghostly. Soon its notes had reached the camp behind us, and men commenced to stream forth along the track in their desire to learn the fate of many a comrade. The breeze murmured to the lilt of fifes; the phantom battalion was nearing the brow. A great expectation seized us all.\n\nBefore long, we could recognise the air they were playing, for now it sounded continuously above the noise of the wind in our ears. Standing thus, scanning the hilltop with eager eyes, we waited in suspense. Now we could hear the melodious tune of a familiar march — they must be very close at hand. Insensibly one’s pulses stirred in response to the rattle of the drums. Over the skyline something flashed and whirled. Our gaze watched in eager fascination. Again the same object appeared, and we knew it for the sergeant-drummer’s stick. At last, his head and shoulders rose above the ridge, and behind him surged the emerging forms of the drummers.\n\n” Rataplan — plan — plan — rataplan! ” Backed by a swaying row of burnished cases and flourished sticks, he swaggered into full view, and as he strode forward, the full array of “The Drums” followed in his wake. Advancing as with the movement of a machine, they marched toward us in the full pride of their great hour. Next, over the crest loomed the figure of our Colonel marching at the head of the devoted band. Rank after rank these poured over the skyline. Eagerly we counted their strength, wondering every instant how many remained to follow. All too soon a gap appeared, but we, still striving to disbelieve our fears, watched spellbound for the next body of men. But none came : the impossible was true. Before us marched all that remained of the old battalion. . . .\n\nTurning before their approach, we, with many a backward glance, retraced our steps toward the camp. Barely a word was spoken. Here amid our lines we took up our stand and awaited the arrival of the column. Along the side of the road stood many men, gazing in mute contemplation at the band of survivors. Now the drummers were almost upon us. Their music ended with a flourish, silence fell upon all. The moment was almost unbearable. Then, crashing forth with full volume of drum and fife, there rolled the opening notes of the Regimental March!\n\nDinning our ears with their stirring clamour, “The Drums” wheeled to a flank, whence, facing the road- way, they continued to pour forth their music. All eyes were turned to the lithe figure of our Commanding Officer, who now led in the glorious remnants. Haggard and drawn, but erect and admirable as ever, he strode past us acknowledging our salutes. Next, tramping forward in a supreme effort, followed the pathetic muster. They presented an amazing spectacle. At that sight, the dullest present must have felt that he was beholding History. A first impression was that of mud, mud everywhere, from the crown of their heads to their shapeless feet. Beneath many a helmet rim, blood-shot eyes stared brilliantly from swollen and dusty lids; moustaches seemed like clots of mud; complexions were grey, furrowed with dried streaks of sweat. Though much of their equipment was missing, here and there we caught sight of German souvenirs, a bayonet or a round service cap. In many cases their clothing was torn and stained with blood. Gazing wonderingly upon their ranks, we noted their sagging knees and their desperate efforts to pull themselves together: here a drooping figure propelled itself forward with the aid of a stick, there, another stumbled on with fixed and haggard expression. The music alone buoyed up these overwrought souls. And as one watched, one’s heart went out to them, for their efforts were positively painful to witness. But now, at the word of command, every man sloped his rifle, every man picked up the step. So, lurching forward at it last gasp, smeared, tattered, but still tenacious, this vision of undaunted men staggered past.\n\nDeliberate or not, there may be echoes of that scene (or its aftermath) in the east window at Kettlewell.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Guards Division Order No: 76, in: WO 95/1192/4, War Diary of Guards Division, Headquarters Branches and Services: General Staff, The National Archives, Kew; Cuthbert Headlam, History of the Guards Division in the Great War, 1915-1918 (London: John Murray, 1924), Vol. 2, pp. 279-283.\n\n[2] 2nd.Gds.Bde.No.199/G, in: WO 95/1217/3, War Diary of 2nd Guards Brigade Headquarters, The National Archives, Kew.\n\n[3] Cuthbert Headlam, History of the Guards Division in the Great War, 1915-1918 (London: John Murray, 1924), Vol. 1, p. 146.\n\n[4] Ibid., p 151\n\n[5] T.

Nine (later ten) tanks were supposed to co-operate with the Guards Division during their attack, with a few detailed also to operate in the 6th Division area (which had been assigned another three tanks). However, the tanks mostly arrived late (or not at all) and had no real impact in the Guards’ sector [1]:\n\nIt was an infantry battle throughout, for the tanks in this their first cooperation in the field with the troops of the Guards Division proved of little or no assistance to the infantry. They were late in crossing the parapet and so were unable to move forward in advance of the leading battalions. The tank to which had been entrusted the important task of dislodging the Germans from their positions at the south-eastern corner of Delville Wood does not appear to have come into action. The remaining tanks wandered about in various directions and are reported to have done a certain amount of useful fighting on their own account either in the area of the Guards Division or in that of the 6th Division, but they certainly failed on this occasion to carry out their main task and were of no help to the infantry in the subduing of machine-gun fire.\n\nThe plan for the use of tanks, however, did have one particularly negative impact on the Guards’ attack. Here, as elsewhere on the 15th September, gaps or “lanes” had been left in the barrage for them, and this meant that artillery was ineffective in suppressing the German defences in those areas. As Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson explain [2]:\n\nSo in the Guards’ area of attack, what the tank lanes managed to accomplish was the creation of clear fields of fire for German machine gunners. Early on, this wreaked havoc on the Guards. Units soon became intermingled. Gaps appeared in some sections of the line and crowding in others; direction was lost; German trenches unknown to the British and therefore unbombarded added to the difficulty; flanking fire – especially from the right where the 6 Division had failed – caused further heavy casualties.\n\nThe ten tanks used in the Guards Division area were all from “C” Company of the Heavy Section Machine Gun Corps, and the nine assigned to support the Guards’ attack were organized into three groups of three tanks. Detailed “Instructions for tanks” were attached to divisional orders, which specified where the tanks were intended to operate [3]:\n\nOn arrival at these positions [their forward positions], tanks will be formed into three columns, numbered from right to left, each consisting of three tanks.\n\nTanks will be lettered –\n\nA, B, C in No. 1 column\n\nD, E, F in No. 2 [column]\n\nG, H, K in No. 3 [column]\n\nAnd “L” Tank.\n\n[…]\n\n2. Column No. 1 will advance to the attack of the Green Line at ZERO – 40.\n\nColumn No. 2 will advance to the attack of the Green Line at ZERO – 40.\n\nColumn No. 3 will advance to the attack of the Green Line at ZERO – 50.\n\nNos. 1, 2 & 3 columns will advance to the attack of the Blue Line (column No. 1 passing into the 6th Division area about T.9.central) at ZERO +1 hour and 10 minutes.\n\nNos. 2 and 3 columns will advance to the attack of the Red Line at ZERO + 3 hours and 30 minutes.\n\n3. A special task is allotted to “L” tank, viz. that of protecting the left flank of 1st Guards Brigade from hostile fire from direction of T.13.A.central. In this task, the two tanks of XV Corps on our left will assist.\n\n“L” tank will at ZERO -50 attack German trenches from T.13.B.2.5 to T.13.A.5.8, cruising in that neighbourhood and overcoming any opposition met with until the infantry of the 14th Division, who are advancing North-eastwards at ZERO from the line T.13.central – T.13.A.0.0, have cleared up the situation. “L” tank will as soon as, but not before, the enemy’s resistance in T.13.A has been completely overcome withdraw to a position in reserve about S.24.central. On arrival at this point, O.C. “L” tank will report the position to 1st Guards Brigade Headquarters at S.24.B.6.1½ and there await fresh orders from Guards Division.\n\nGiven that this was the first time tanks had ever been used in action, the instructions seem too prescriptive, with no backup plan if things did not go to plan (as they so often would).\n\nThe War Diary of the Guards Division (WO 95/1192/4) records a single message received from tank “G” at 8.15 am:\n\nTANK MESSAGE. 8.15. a.m. Message received from G Tank that he had passed 1st objective and was advancing with the infantry.\n\nIt was one of the few tanks that managed to get into action at all. Stephen Pope’s book on The first tank crews provides an overview of how all of the tanks in the Guards Division area fared on the 15th September [4]:\n\nThe tanks’ initial assembly area on 14 September was at Trônes Wood and they had to make their way, without lights, to their rendezvous at Ginchy to arrive at 2:20am, four hours before zero at 6:20am. Owing to mechanical breakdown, almost half the tanks did not support the attack. Every one of the central tanks, known as “D”, “E” and “F”, failed to get into action. Hiscocks’ [Captain Herbert Hiscocks] own tank “D” ditched before it could cross the start line, [Lieutenant] Tom Murphy’s steering gear was damaged on the move up to the rendezvous and [Lieutenant] Alec Arnaud’s tank “E” became ditched on route to the start point. Frustrated and embarrassed by failure of his section, Herbert Hiscocks went to [sic] forward on foot to ensure that the tanks attacking on the Guards’ left flank set off in the right direction; “A”, commanded by [Lieutenant] Jethro Tull, damaged its steering wheels as it crossed into no man’s land and had to return to the Start Point. [Lieutenant] Jack Clarke in “B” [C.17 “Campania”] and [Lieutenant] Victor Smith in “C”[C.18 “Casa”] deployed in the correct direction, across no man’s land towards the Guards’ objective but then went north in same direction as the Guards, who had diverted from their correct axis of attack, eventually reaching their second objective. Of the third group of tanks, “K” under the command of [Lieutenant] Charles Ambrose had steering and engine problems which prevented him from reaching the start point but “G” commanded by [Lieutenant] Len Bates and “H” commanded by [Lieutenant] Herbert Elliot, not only crossed no man’s land and through the German front line trenches, but also moved onto their second objective near Pound Trench.\n\nThe tenth tank was a reserve, C.24 “Clan Cameron,2 commanded by Lieutenant Harold Cole, which was supposed to join tanks “G,” “H,” and “K” after taking part in a preliminary operation clearing German trenches east of Delville Wood, but it does not seem to have taken a significant part in either operation [5].\n\nThe War Diary of the Guards Division Headquarters includes its own considered assessment of the role of the tanks on the 15th September 1916 [6]:\n\nApp 1110 War Diary\n\nG.D.No. 2282/G.\n\nHeadquarters,\n\nXIV Corps\n\nIn reply to your G.961.\n\n1. Nine tanks were originally allotted to Guards Division for the operations on the 15th; this was subsequently increased to ten.\n\nOwing to various reasons, only seven of the above tanks were in a postion to go over the parapet on the morning of the 15th September.\n\nThe tanks were operating in three columns; the left column had orders to leave our front line at Zero – 50 minutes, and the other two columns at Zero – 40 minutes.\n\nOne tank, “L”, had a special duty to perform and was ordered to leave the front line at Zero – 50 minutes and proceed to the area immediately S.E. of DELVILLE WOOD in order to clear up the situation there before the infantry attack advanced.\n\nThe remaining tanks had as their successive objectives the strong points marked down for attack on the XIV Corps tank map, issued with XIV Corps Operation Order No. 51.\n\n2. A good deal of difficulty was experienced in getting the tanks from their position of assembly S.W. of TRONES WOOD to the forward positions during the night of the 14/15th Septr.\n\nTapes had been laid on the ground from a point south west of GUILLEMONT to the forward positions on the outskirts of GINCHY. The ground over which the tanks had to travel between TRONES WOOD and GINCHY was as bad as possible and without the assistance of the tapes, which had been laid by day, it is improbable that the tanks would have been able to get to their forward positions.\n\nAt 3 a.m. on the morning of the 15th, a message was received from Capt. HISCOCKS, Commanding the tanks allotted to this Division, that seven tanks were in position and ready.\n\n3. From the time that the seven tanks started, it is very difficult to follow their movements.\n\nIt is fairly certain that all tanks were late in crossing the parapet, and it is practically certain they they were never in advance of the leading infantry at any stage of the attack. They were therefore quite useless as regards knocking out Machine Guns and strong points before the infantry advance, which was their “role” in the attack.\n\n“L” tank entrusted with special work at the south east corner of DELVILLE WOOD did not fire at all although the tank may have gone to approximately the correct position.\n\nOne tank got as far as T.15.a, and another as far as T.8.d.9.0, the latter firing at this point about 60 rounds of 6-pdr. ammunition.\n\nIt is not worth tracing the routes taken by the other tanks, which went inconsiderable distances, and returned owing to mechanical trouble or to shortage of petrol.\n\n4. To summarise the services rendered by the tanks, it must be admitted that they were of no assistance in the attack, chiefly owing to the fact that they started too late to enable to fulfil their proper task and also owing to the fact that the moment they started they lost all sense of direction and wandered about aimlessly.\n\nTo have started them before Zero – 50 was not possible owing to darkness.\n\n5. The chief points requiring attention, if use is to be made of tanks in future attacks, are as follows :-\n\n(A) They are easily perforated by armour-piercing bullets of which at least 6 entered one car.\n\n(B) They do not carry sufficient petrol. They consumed a full tank, 48 gallons, in doing approximately five miles.\n\n(C) It is very necessary to have advancing dumps of petrol to which tanks can return in case of necessity.\n\n(D) The section officer should not himself be in a tank – he loses all control over other tanks as soon as he shuts himself into his tank, whereas his services would be very valuable in directing the attack and observing the routes taken by the tanks even if he himself was unable to go further than the front line trenches.\n\n(E) From the point of view of the infantry, it is thought that while there are great possibilities in the useful employment of these machine, their proper place in an attack, at present, is somewhere in reserve as far forward as is consistent with their remaining unobserved, and that one or more tanks should be sent for when infantry are definitely held up at some point.\n\nIt is considered that any attempt to advance before Zero would inevitably produce a heavy enemy barrage in the future, through which the infantry would have to advance.\n\nIt does not seem that the reliability of tanks is yet such, that essentials of a plan of attack should be based on them.\n\n(Sd) G. Fielding,\n\nMajor General,\n\nCommanding Guards Division.\n\n19th September 1916.\n\nThis report is written after consultation with Major Walker [Allen Holford-Walker], Commanding the Heavy Machine Gun Section which provided the tanks for the attack of the Guards Division on the 15th September 1916.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Cuthbert Headlam, History of the Guards Division in the Great War, 1915-1918 (London: John Murray, 1924), Vol. 1, p. 161.\n\n[2] Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson, The Somme (New Haven, CT and London: Yale University Press, 2005), pp. 232-233.\n\n[3] WO 95/1192/4, War Diary of Guards Division, Headquarters Branches and Services: General Staff, The National Archives, Kew.\n\n[4] Stephen Pope, The first tank crews: the lives of the tankmen who fought at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, 15 September 1916 (Solihull: Helion & Co, 2016), p. 70.\n\n[5] Ibid., pp. 75, 32-33.\n\n[6] WO 95/1192/4, War Diary of Guards Division, Headquarters Branches and Services: General Staff, The National Archives, Kew.\n\nPrivate 76427 Arthur James Gates of “B” Battalion, Tank Corps was killed in action on the 31st July 1917, aged around 28. It was the opening day of the British offensive that became officially known as the Third Battle of Ypres, but which is perhaps better known today as the Battle of Passchendaele.\n\nPrivate Gates came from the New Forest, having been born at Sway (Hampshire) in 1888. It is possible that he is a distant relation of mine, as my mother’s ancestors include several generations of Gates born in the same village. Census returns and other records confirm that there were a very large number of persons named Gates living in-and-around Sway during the nineteenth century, where the families seem to have been particularly concentrated in the area called Durnstown, which back then seems to have been known as Durrant’s Town. While I have not (as yet) been able to find a common ancestor, it is likely that, at the very least, Arthur James Gates would have known my great-grandfather, Henry Edward Gates, who was born at Sway in 1879. Henry Edward would later become a crane driver and during the First World War served as a Lance Corporal (Service No: WR/506318) with the Inland Waterways and Docks Section of the Royal Engineers.\n\nThis post will outline what I have been able to discover about Arthur James Gates and his military service. It also includes some very long sections introducing the opening offensive of the Third Battle of Ypres and the role of “B” Battalion of the Tank Corps during it.\n\nArthur James Gates and his family:\n\nArthur James Gates (Jim) was born at Sway in the third quarter of 1888 [1]. He was the son of James Gates and Eliza Jane Gates (née Young), who had married at Lymington (registration district) in the first quarter of 1887. The young Arthur James was baptised at St. Luke’s Church, Sway on the 7th October 1888. St. Luke’s was just under 50 years old at the time, having been dedicated on the 12th March 1839 as a chapel-of-ease within the parish of Boldre (Sway was established shortly afterwards as a separate ecclesiastical parish).\n\nAt the time of the 1891 Census, the family of James and Eliza Jane Gates were living at Brighton Road, Sway. There is a bit of confusion over who was the head of household. Listed first was George Cull, a seventy-four-year-old widower, but his status as head was later corrected to “lodger.” The four remaining inhabitants were the family of James and Eliza Jane Gates:\n\nGeorge Cull: (head) lodger, aged 74; living on own means; born Sway\n\nJames Gates: husband, aged 27; railway labourer, plate (employed); born Hants, Sway\n\nEliza Jane Gates: wife, aged 24; born Middlesex, Edgware\n\nArthur James Gates; son, aged 2; born Sway\n\nAda Eugenie; daughter, aged 6 months; born Sway\n\nThe 1901 Census is much clearer. The Gates family were still living at Brighton Road and James Gates was unambiguously described as the head of family:\n\nJames Gates, head, married, aged 37; railway platelayer, born Hants, Sway\n\nEliza J. Gates, wife, married, aged 36; born Middlesex, Hounslow\n\nArthur J. Gates, son, aged 12; born Hants, Sway\n\nAda L., daughter, aged 10; born Hants, Sway\n\nCharles Gates: son, aged 8; born Hants, Sway\n\nBertram Gates: son, aged 7; born Hants, Sway\n\nEmily K. Gates: daughter, aged 4; born Hants, Sway\n\nSydney A. Gates: son, aged 6 months; born Hants, Sway\n\nThere had been a few changes by the time of the 1911 Census, although the family were still living at Brighton Road. The most significant change was that James Gates had died in 1905, having been killed in a railway accident:\n\nEliza Jane Gates: head, widow, aged 45; no occupation; born London\n\n"
