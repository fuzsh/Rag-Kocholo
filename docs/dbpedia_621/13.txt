Frederick Douglass (author)

John Lobb (editor)

John Bright (introduction)

Douglass’s third and last autobiography of his life as a slave, runaway, and then campaigner for the abolition of slavery. This edition is interesting because of the introduction by one of Britain’s leading classical liberal reformers, John Bright.
