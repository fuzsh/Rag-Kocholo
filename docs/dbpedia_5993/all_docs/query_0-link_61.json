        "text": "ACRL's Awards program will be on hold for the 2021-2022 award season, during which time nominations will not be accepted or juried and no recipients will be chosen for any ACRL awards. For more information, please contact Brian Lim.\n\nThese awards are given annually in recognition of excellence in the publication of catalogues and brochures that accompany exhibitions of library and archival materials, as well as for electronic exhibitions of such materials. They are administered by the Exhibition Awards Committee of the ALA/ACRL Rare Books and Manuscripts Section (RBMS), whose operating expenses are covered by a generous endowment from Katharine Kyes Leab and Daniel J. Leab, editors of American Book Prices Current.\n\nAward\n\nA printed citation to be presented to the recipient institution organizing the exhibition.\n\nEligibility\n\nCatalogues must be issued between September 1, 2019 and August 31, 2020. Electronic library and archival exhibitions are limited to those with stable URL addresses that were initially released between September 1, 2019 and August 31, 2020. Electronic exhibitions submitted for consideration should be available online through September 2021, to allow adequate time for public views.\n\nThe entries will be divided into seven categories: expensive, moderate, inexpensive, brochure, electronic exhibition, innovation, and student. The seven categories shall be determined by production costs as outlined in the entry form. The budget categories will be defined by the committee according to the range of costs of catalogues submitted. Catalogues may be of varying formats, styles, and scope, e.g., an inclusive list of items in an exhibition, a selective list, or a narrative with some specific citations. Publicity materials, collections of essays, and other publications lacking specific references to displayed objects as such are not eligible.\n\nCriteria\n\nCatalogues will be judged on originality, accuracy of detail, informational content, visual impact, contribution to scholarship, and usefulness to the intended audience. Full evaluation criteria is available on the RBMS website.\n\nSubmissions\n\nSubmissions are not currently being accepted.\n\nPrinted catalogues and brochures: Four (4) copies of the catalogue or brochure must be submitted with accompanying entry forms. Electronic exhibitions: Only the entry form is required, though the committee encourages submission of CDs or DVDs for the Leab Award archives. All submissions should be addressed to the Emma M. Sarconi, Chair of the Exhibition Awards Committee, esarconi@princeton.edu.\n\nAll catalogue submissions become the property of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Section (RBMS), and are archived at the Bancroft Library, University of California; the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin; and the Grolier Club, New York, N.Y.\n\nFurther information about the awards, guidelines and rules for submission, and online entry forms are available at http://rbms.info/committees/exhibition_awards/.\n\nQuestions concerning the awards and the submission process should be directed to Emma M. Sarconi, Chair of the Exhibition Awards Committee, esarconi@princeton.edu.\n\nView the full award committee roster here.\n\n2021 Recipients - Award Announcement\n\nCatalogs Category Recipient\n\nThe Getty Research Institute for Käthe Kollwitz: Prints, Process, Politics\n\nBrochures Category Recipient\n\nThe Rosenbach Museum for Chart Your Own Voyage\n\nDigital Category Recipient\n\nUniversity of Delaware Library Special Collections for Votes for Delaware Women\n\nInnovation Category Recipient\n\nFree Library of Philadelphia for Our 5 Senses Activity Booklet and Seek & Find\n\nStudent Category Recipient\n\nHaverford College for Crossing Borders: From Slavery to Abolition, 1670-1865\n\nStudent Category Honorable Mention\n\nHaverford College for Who Created the New and Copied the Old: Printed Books of the Fifteenth Century\n\nPrevious Recipients\n\n2020 - Award Announcement\n\nCategory 1 (Expensive) Recipient\n\nThe Huntington Library for Nineteen Nineteen\n\nCategory 1 Honorable Mention\n\nThe Grolier Club for A Matter of Size: Miniature Bindings & Texts from the Collection of Patricia J.
