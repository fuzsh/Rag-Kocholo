Kennedy. In 1971, President Nixon combined the Peace Corps, VISTA, and several senior volunteer programs under the umbrella agency, ACTION. President Carter made the Peace Corps an “autonomous” agency within ACTION in 1979. Congress showed strong support for re-establishing the Peace Corps as an independent agency. The nomination of Thomas Pauken as Director of ACTION provided the impetus to complete this move. Mr. Pauken had previously served in military intelligence during the Vietnam War. Many argued, including Ms. Ruppe, that any taint of intelligence association with the Peace Corps placed the volunteers at risk within their service countries. Over the objections of the Reagan administration, Congress voted to separate the Peace Corps from ACTION effective on 12/29/1981. All remaining material regarding the Peace Corps can be found in FG380, the subject category for the newly re-established independent Peace Corps.\n\nOpen FG066-02\n\nVISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) (1 folder; Box 5)\n\nThis secondary subject category contains material relating to VISTA cutbacks in programs; the strategy for the phase-out of VISTA; requests to restore programs cut back; and information about the group, “Friends of VISTA” working to keep the VISTA program.\n\nNOTE: VISTA was combined with the Americorps program in 1993.\n\nOpen FG066-03\n\nVoluntary Action, Office of (Empty)\n\nThe White House Office of Records Management did not transfer any material within this secondary subject category to the Library.\n\nN/A FG066-04\n\nNational Voluntary Service Advisory Council (3 folders; Box 6)\n\nThis secondary subject category contains material relating to the appointment and members of the National Voluntary Service Advisory Council; a letter of appreciation for selection from Mrs. Strom Thurmond; and a charter of the Council.\n\nOpen FG067\n\nAdministrative Conference of the United States (1.9 l.ft.; Box 6-10)\n\nThis secondary subject category contains material relating to reports to Congress by the Conference; papers and agendas for annual plenary meetings; administrative issues for the Conference including initiating email, adding staff; appointment and resignation of members of the Conference; expanding membership to include the International Trade Commission and the Merit Systems Protection Board; Presidential review of agency rulemaking; presentation of the report on user fee projects; and the 20th anniversary of the Conference.\n\nOpen FG068\n\nAdvertising Council (3 folders, Box 10)\n\nThis secondary subject category contains material relating to the Advertising Council Productivity Campaign and interaction with the possible White House program on productivity; the 40th anniversary of the Council; Presidential support letter for the annual Washington meeting of the Council; and invitations and regrets for the 1987 annual Washington meeting of the Council.\n\nOpen FG069\n\nAdvisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings & Monuments (Empty)\n\nThis secondary subject category contained 2 case files regarding appointments to the future Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board.
