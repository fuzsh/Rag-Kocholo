Kennedy. In 1971, President Nixon combined the Peace Corps, VISTA, and several senior volunteer programs under the umbrella agency, ACTION. President Carter made the Peace Corps an “autonomous” agency within ACTION in 1979. Congress showed strong support for re-establishing the Peace Corps as an independent agency. The nomination of Thomas Pauken as Director of ACTION provided the impetus to complete this move. Mr. Pauken had previously served in military intelligence during the Vietnam War. Many argued, including Ms. Ruppe, that any taint of intelligence association with the Peace Corps placed the volunteers at risk within their service countries. Over the objections of the Reagan administration, Congress voted to separate the Peace Corps from ACTION effective on 12/29/1981.
