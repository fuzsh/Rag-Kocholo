        "text": "This week, the Curious ‘Cat asks Villanova students, “Who would be an ideal study partner?”\n\nKaitlyn Barney—“The ideal study partner would be The Flash, Barry Allen, because he’s smart, and he’s a scientist like me. He’d be great to study with.”\n\nSantosh Kotha—“My ideal study partner is Arany Levitin [PhD] from the computer science department. He’s a professor there. … The way he thinks really amazes me. … He analyzes things very well.”\n\nEllen Moxley—“I would choose Benjamin Franklin because he is my idol. I just love all of his thirteen virtues. … He seems to be very diligent and purposeful and successful, and I aspire to be like him.”\n\nSr. Oanh Vo, ACJ—“my sister, Michelle: We don’t interrupt each other. … We take breaks together, and we respect each other’s time.”\n\nKumaresh Balaji—“My ideal study partner would be someone who is highly intelligent and very on top of things in class.\n\nSo, for example, for the past two years I’ve been a bio major, so most of my classes were with this one student whose name is Thomas, and he’s a pre-dental student. Now he’s in Penn dental. He’s very intelligent, very bright, and so I always looked to him as motivation.\n\nIt was never any kind of hierarchy—he’s better than me—or anything like that. Whenever we were studying he was very quiet, I was very quiet. We would do things together … If I needed any kind of assistance, I would ask him, and if he needed any kind of assistance, we would work through it together. … That mutual collective spirit during studying is very helpful.\n\nI don’t like big groups, a lot of chatter, I like quiet solitary studying with one guy who really knows his stuff … Working through problems whether it’s bio or physics … really teaches me to learn. If he asked for any kind of guidance I would explain my perspective, and that reinforces it in my mind … That’s my ideal partner: someone I can learn from and … draw inspiration from.”\n\nJennifer Maxwell—“Well, right now I’m studying counseling. … I like musicians. I would like John Lennon and people like that. I feel like they always have good insight into the world.”"
