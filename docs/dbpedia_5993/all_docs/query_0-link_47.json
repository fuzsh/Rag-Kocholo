        "text": "Majors:\n\nNicole Mah | 马青雯\n\nNicole is a graduating senior from Hong Kong and Singapore majoring in China and Asia Pacific Studies and minoring in Business. Growing up in a Singaporean household and attending a German high school in Hong Kong laid the foundation for a lifelong pursuit of cross-cultural comprehension and geopolitical understanding. This led her to major in CAPS, a strategic decision to integrate contemporary China studies into the broader framework of liberal arts education in the US. Her study abroad experience at Peking University her senior fall was a pivotal chapter of learning and growth - her classes, taught in English and Mandarin, as well as her policy research internship at one of Beijing's top VC firms, were gateways to understanding China's intricate socioeconomic dynamics.\n\nOn campus, Nicole has been actively involved with the Cornell Hedge Fund, where she served as the inaugural Diversity & Inclusion Chair, as well as a financial analyst every semester. She has also served as Marketing Chair, Vice President and Senior Advisor in the Hong Kong Student Association, This semester, Nicole was also a Teaching Assistant for HADM 2221/3210 Principles of Hospitality Real Estate. Outside of the classroom, Nicole loves to explore Ithaca with her friends and cook Southeast Asian food that reminds her of home. She is also an avid traveller and has been to over 32 countries, including Oman, Iceland, and South Africa.\n\nAfter graduation, Nicole will be working at Bank of America in New York City in the Sales & Trading Division as an Emerging Markets Exotics Analyst. In the long term, she hopes to leverage her academic rigor and global perspective to be a leader in an Asia-focused multinational firm, merging technical rigor with cultural understanding.\n\nIanna Ramdhany Correa | 阮爱林\n\nThroughout my time at Cornell, I have been an avid participant in language studies and cultural immersion, most recently traveling to Beijing for a semester through CAPS. Outside of CAPS, I am also a government double major which has allowed me to develop my interests in international politics. On campus, I have been an active member of Phi Alpha Delta pre-law fraternity where I served as both the recruitment chair and the DEI chair. I have also been a member of the undergraduate law review, consultant and analyst for the Cornell Global Business club, and engaged in various other pre-professional organizations. After graduating, I will be a litigation paralegal at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler in New York City.\n\nEric Zhang | 张志达\n\nAt Cornell, I’ve not only been able to enjoy academics but also engaged in activities that enriched my college experience and personal growth. As a project lead for the Cornell Data Science project team, I collaborated with peers to tackle real-world data challenges, creating many interesting projects. Beyond these technical endeavors, I embraced humanities, which deepened my social and cultural insights. My engagement with CAPS was particularly transformative, nurturing a deeper connection with my Chinese heritage and igniting a passion for my culture. I am especially grateful to Professor Xu Xin for his constant support and encouragement, and to my parents, who have been instrumental in helping me maintain a strong connection with my Chinese roots. These experiences have not only broadened my worldview but also fostered a more comprehensive personal growth.\n\nOn campus, I am also an officer in the Association of Computer Science Undergraduates, as well as a member of the Chinese Student Association and Cornell EARS.\n\nPost graduation, I am thrilled to start my professional journey in the tech industry, where I aim to secure a position that challenges and utilizes my software skills. I’m eager to build innovative solutions, collaborate with diverse teams, and make a meaningful impact. Looking ahead, I’m considering returning to graduate school in China—an opportunity to deepen my understanding of global trends and bridge cultures.\n\nAs I prepare to embark on this next chapter, I am grateful for the memories I've made and the lessons I've learned at Cornell, and I am eager to apply these experiences in my future endeavors.\n\nMinors:\n\nRichard Li | 李睿弛\n\nRichard Li, originally from Troy, Michigan, has a keen interest in emerging technologies, international security, and foreign affairs. He served as a research assistant to Professor Sarah Kreps and is an undergraduate research fellow at the Cornell Tech Policy Institute, where he examines the effects of emerging technologies such as drones and artificial intelligence on warfare and statecraft. Richard’s writing has been published by the Brookings Institution and The National Interest, with other projects appearing in The Washington Post and Foreign Affairs. His honors thesis, titled \"Charging Ahead: Chinese Industrial Policy Analysis in the Electric Vehicle and Battery Sectors,\" examines the performance of EV and battery firms and the industrial policy measures implemented by the Chinese government.\n\nIn addition to balancing academics and research, Richard has undertaken several leadership roles. He served as the captain of the policy debate team and Vice President of Finance at Kappa Alpha Pi, a pre-law fraternity. Additionally, he worked as a foreign policy analyst at the Cornell Roosevelt Institute.\n\nIn 2022, Richard was a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) Summer Honors Academy. During the summer of 2023, he worked as a research intern at the Hudson Institute and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), specializing in defense and technology. He also gained experience as an editorial intern for The National Interest. After graduation, Richard will join J.A. Green & Company in Washington, D.C., as a research associate, focusing on strengthening U.S. national security in the technology sector.\n\nAlyssa Ma | 马玥苒\n\nAlyssa is a graduating senior majoring in Applied Economics and Management with minors in China and Asia Pacific Studies and Information Science. Although she entered Cornell as a Dyson student, she was always motivated to pursue the CAPS minor to merge her interests in business and international relations. She has been able to supplement her business acumen with a global perspective and experience, gaining valuable insights in international markets and cross-cultural communication.\n\nOn campus, Alyssa has been involved in Cornell Digital and Tech Innovation as a business lead and product marketing manager. She joined Design Consulting at Cornell in its founding semester, becoming a project manager and new member educator. Alyssa has worked on campus as a tour guide and senior information specialist for all four years.\n\nShe is also a member of Dyson Ambassadors and Cornell’s Chinese Student Association. Some of her favorite Cornell memories include watching the slope sunset, cooking dinners with friends, and exploring campus, whether that is Cornell or Peking University’s campus.\n\nAfter graduation, Alyssa will travel with her family and move cross-country to Seattle to pursue a career in e-commerce within the tech industry. She hopes to continue merging her passions for brand marketing and international business, building communities around the world. She looks forward to postgraduate life, where she will be meeting old and new friends around the globe.\n\nShe would like to thank Professor Xu Xin, Bryant Munson, and the CAPS program for providing her with the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study China relations as a business major and travel to China on exchange. She also thanks her family and friends for their support throughout the years, especially when she was living across the world\n\nMarie Williams | 江 君\n\nMy name is Marie Williams, and I am a senior from the Bay Area, California, majoring in Information Science with minors in Business and China and Asia Pacific Studies. As suggested by my major, my biggest academic interest lies at the intersection of technology and its human impact, but the ten years I spent growing up in Shanghai, China also inspired me to pursue my minor in CAPS.\n\nOn campus, I am a member of the Milstein Program for Technology and Humanity (an interdisciplinary program for select students in the College of Arts & Sciences), the Women’s Varsity Swim Team, finance club Diversity on The Street, and the Phi Beta Kappa Honors Society.\n\nPost graduation this May, I will be returning to Cornell for one more semester to finish my Master’s degree in Information Science. Upon completion of that degree, I hope to attend law school and eventually work in technology law.\n\nMajors:\n\nAlex Breitenbach |卞立德\n\nThroughout my time at Cornell, I have pursued two degrees in both CAPS and Government. I have been a proud brother of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity since freshman year and have been a contributor to the Cornell Greek Life community serving as a member of the IFC Judicial Board. Furthermore, I have also been a Proud member of the Lynah faithful since I was a young Boy. I was honored when I was selected to carry on the tradition of ringing the cowbell at every big red hockey game and it has been a true privilege to pass the Lynah Faithful cheers and chants down to the next generation. I have also been heavily involved with my club the Big Red Sports Network, where I was the founder and proud co-host of the Big Red Hockey Cast for the Last two seasons. It has been a privilege to interview many prominent Big Red players, coaches, and alumni each week. After graduation, I am currently exploring career paths in the National Security sector and am also looking into careers in management consulting. I hope that I will be able to use my language skills to help not only make the world a more peaceful place, but also bring others together as well.\n\nIsaac Herzog | 曾智宁\n\nIsaac fell in love with Cornell because of the CAPS program. Though Ithaca’s beauty and Cornell’s academic prowess indeed attracted him to this school, it was really Professor Carlson, Professor Xu, and CAPS that brought him here. He’s been a CAPS major since day one of freshman year and has taken seemingly every class it has to offer since. Since the pandemic, Isaac has also been organizing events for all the students to get together, mostly over hotpot, to build up a sense of community.\n\nOutside of classes, Isaac is a bass in the Cornell Glee Club, an avid reader, and a frequenter of the slope when the weather is nice. If he’s not singing, he’s with friends at IBC, learning a new language, or discussing premier league soccer with Professor Carlson.\n\nAfter Cornell, Isaac is continuing his studies at Oxford, where he’ll get an MSc in Contemporary Chinese Studies. His proposed Master’s thesis will be about China’s investment in Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea, a subject he is immensely excited to get started.\n\nIn his final minutes as a CAPS student, Isaac would like to thank Professor Carlson and Xu, not only for their academic teaching and guidance (though what they have taught him cannot be understated), but also their deep kindness, fierce passion for education, and for being truly amazing people.\n\nJoshua Lehrman | 雷家华\n\nUnique. That is the word I would use to describe my experience at Cornell. I have been fortunate to be involved in many great organizations across Ithaca. Aside from CAPS, I worked at Student Agencies, joined a social fraternity, volunteered at Salvation Army, and played club lacrosse. I felt unique and proud of my CAPS major in each organization. Few people had ever met other CAPS majors before me, and I always felt privileged to be the first one they could meet. I spent almost two years at Student Agencies as the head of a moving company that generated $350k in annual revenue. This was the most formative experience I had during college. Not only did I gain an understanding of what it takes to run a business, but I also had the opportunity to work with a diverse group of people. The student employees I collaborated with came from different socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. In addition, the social fraternity and club lacrosse were fun ways for me to meet other students across campus and involve myself in activities I love. I also enjoyed volunteering at Salvation Army, where I had the chance to give back to the Ithaca community one meal at a time. Finally, CAPS, of course, has been the staple of my Cornell career. I am so grateful that I could take full advantage of the Mandarin course offerings at Cornell. I also greatly appreciate all the CAPS professors and loved each CAPS I took. Next year, I will work at a hedge fund in New York City and continue practicing my Mandarin in Flushing Chinatown. Thank you, CAPS!\n\nAngela Pan | 潘若怡\n\nMy name is Angela Pan (潘若怡) and I double majored in CAPS and Government. I am particularly interested the role of China in global politics and comparative environmental policy in the US and China. On campus, I was part of the Cornell Speech and Debate Union. I am a member of the advocacy and publicity team of the International Student Union. I also volunteered at college mentors for kids and participated as an undergrad scholar at the Institute of Politics and Global Affairs. I spend my sophomore year at Tsinghua study away program in Beijing where I also worked as a research fellow at China House. As a research fellow, I conducted research on Chinese foreign investment and poverty alleviation policies. In my junior year, I was a research assistant working with Dr. Lu at the Atkinson center for sustainability on Green BRI and Chinese foreign aid research. I also participated in the Cornell in Washington Program where I interned at the Wilson Center’s China Environment Forum and worked on climate and plastic policies. Moreover, I am a three-plus-three law student so I spent my senior year as a first-year law student at Cornell Law School. At Cornell Law, I am the incoming vice president for women of color coalition and the incoming co-president of the public interest law union. My post-graduate plan is to pursue a joint JD/LLM degree at Cornell Law and to explore comparative legal systems in Asia Pacific and environmental law.\n\nMax Smith | 潘旭\n\nDuring my time at Cornell, I am so thankful to have met so many wonderful people on this campus, lived and studied in Washington D.C., and gained work and life experience to prepare me for my next steps in life. When I am not doing work, I love going hiking all the different trails in the area and trying all the different restaurants in Ithaca. I enjoy playing intramural soccer and am a student sports official for Cornell Recreational Services. I also enjoy working as a chef at the Statler Hotel. I am a member of the Cornell Poker Association and Mixed at Cornell. After I graduate and travel throughout China this summer I will be moving to New York City to work in Financial Services for a short period of time before returning to graduate school to pursue a Master's degree in East Asian regional studies and hopefully becoming a Foreign Service Officer.\n\nQianyu Wu | 吴茜羽\n\nI am majoring in Government, CAPS, and economics at Cornell. During my summer at Cornell I participated in Cornell Cooperative Extension research internship where my partner and I would analyze economic and health conditions of different districts in New York state and zone in on regions that need help to improve living conditions there. I learned a lot from Cornell, not just the academics and theories, but also how the knowledge and discussions we had in class applies to us in real life. After graduation I'll start at Bank of America as an operations analyst, and I'm looking forward to it.\n\nMinors:\n\nJohn Ashbrook | 安坚\n\nWhile at Cornell, John has worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the CAPS department, and written for several student publications. Outside of class he is an active member of Cornell's boxing, muay thai, and barbell clubs, helps manage the school's mascot Touchdown the Bear, and works as a cook for the popular collegetown pop-up restaurant \"Bool Street Noods.\" After graduation, John will be moving to the National Capital Region where he will be working as an analyst for the Department of Defense.\n\nKenny Ip | 叶觉聪\n\nKenny is a graduating senior from the School of Industrial and Labor Relations with a Minor in China and Asian Pacific Studies. He has an interest in law and public service.

His time at Cornell had been equally defined by time spent off-campus participating in Princeton in Beijing and the Southeast Asian Summer Studies Institute. Both language programs in Mandarin and Burmese respectively have firmly impressed upon him that he will remain a lifelong student.\n\nAfter graduation, Drake will be interning with the Stimson Center’s Defense and Strategy Planning Propaganda. Long term, he hopes to research Chinese foreign policy in Myanmar.\n\nChuxuan “Victoria” Liu | 刘楚萱\n\nVictoria triple-majored in China and Asia-Pacific Studies, Government, and Philosophy, with a minor in Law and Society.

At Cornell his studies have taken him everywhere from revolutionary Maoist China, to neo-Confucian Chosŏn Korea, to the mystical Song Empire, and beyond.\n\nOne of Isaac’s passions is “collecting” languages. He began with Spanish in middle school, branched out to French and Mandarin in high school, and has been working hard over the past two years to add Korean to his arsenal. Sometime in the future, he hopes to complete the East Asian trifecta by learning Japanese and connect with his heritage by learning Scottish Gaelic.\n\nOutside the classroom, Isaac has loved training with Cornell Army ROTC, and he’ll miss all the early morning workouts at Barton Hall and freezing weekends at Mt. Pleasant. He has also been an active member of Cru Cornell, has served as the captain of Cornell Men’s Rugby, and has worked as a north campus Resident Advisor in HILC. One of his favorite memories of his time at Cornell is his annual Mandarin 相声 (crosstalk standup comedy) performance with his freshman year roommate Greg Brumberg (白大龙) at the CSSA’s Lunar New Year’s Eve Gala.\n\nUpon graduating, Isaac will commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Army Infantry and will then spend a few months living at home with his family and traveling to visit friends (and hopefully back to China and Korea once borders become more open) before reporting for US Army Infantry Basic Officer Leader Course in November 2021. After completing his training, he hopes to use his Korean and Mandarin skills as a rifle platoon leader in South Korea.\n\nIsabella Paternostro | 苏雪灵\n\nOutside of academics, Isabella enjoyed working for Cornell Fitness Centers as a Zumba® Instructor during her junior and senior year and for the CAPS office during her first two years, and was involved with the Cornell International Affairs Society.

Phillip spent two summers in China during his time at Cornell. In the summer of 2018, he attended the Experiencing China Program at Tsinghua University, and during the summer of 2019, he engaged in intensive Mandarin study at the Princeton in Beijing Program hosted by Beijing Normal University. During his time at Cornell, Phillip was the VP of Operations of the Cornell Investment Banking Club and was further involved with the Cornell Real Estate Club.

On campus at Cornell, he was a member of the Absolute Zero Breakdancing Crew. As Cornell's only student group dedicated purely to breakdancing, AZero routinely practiced together to help each other and grow their skills and appreciation of Hip Hop culture. Ryan's favorite semester at Cornell, ironically, did not take place at Cornell. The CAPS Beijing semester was an amazing experience that he would recommend to anyone with a passion for Chinese language and culture. Not only was Ryan given plenty of opportunities to develop his language skills, but he was also able to build some great friendships during his time in Northeast China. Ryan will forever look back on this experience as one of the most memorable and enjoyable experiences in his life. During his undergraduate studies, Ryan took on internships at MAXIMUS Federal, the American Chamber of Commerce in China, and the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nAfter graduating in May, Ryan returned home to the DC area to begin his journey into the working world with a consulting position at Booz Allen Hamilton, where he plans to focus on business development and process improvement.

From Ithaca to Beijing to Guangzhou, Austin pushed herself outside of her comfort zone by diving deep into unfamiliar territories. On campus, She was the co-president of the College of Arts & Sciences' Ambassadors and Advising Program, co-founder of the Tsinghua-Cornell Women's Leadership Association, executive vice chair of the Senior Class Campaign, business operations and programming analyst at Anabel's Grocery, member of Kappa Kappa Gamma's standards board, and the alumni chair and campus representative at Forte Campus at Cornell.\n\nAustin’s China journey began in 2014, when she was confused why she was assigned Zhengzhou, China, for her first medical mission with Operation Smile at only 15 years old. Austin underestimated China’s dire healthcare needs. However, after connecting with and composing compelling stories of 364 orofacial cleft patients without access to safe and timely healthcare, she witnessed firsthand China’s positioning, both as the world’s rising superpower and the largest developing country. Austin’s \"China story\" came full circle during her CAPS semester abroad as she was able to join Operation Smile's team in Liuan in April 2019, to work alongside medical professionals, write patient stories after conducting interviews in Chinese, and assist in pre and post-operative care.\n\nSix years ago, Austin began her quest for knowledge to negotiate the complexities of U.S.-China relations, and she is eager to continue on this transformative and exciting journey. Austin will launch her career in Chicago working for SC Johnson on their Amazon/E-commerce team.\n\nEmily Ortwein| (欧爱莲)\n\nWhile at Cornell, Emily was a member of the university’s Naval ROTC unit, and held multiple leadership positions during her time here, eventually taking charge of on-campus recruiting efforts for the unit during my senior year.

Emily spent her junior spring semester abroad in Beijing with other CAPS classmates, and during that time translated now-published academic research from Mandarin to English. She also led the Patient Imaging Team on an Operation Smile mission to Lu’An while in China.\n\nEmily’s best memories from her time in the CAPS program definitely took place abroad, from trying out new foods (like chicken feet) at local Chinese restaurants to interacting and sharing ideas with Chinese students her age at prestigious schools such as Beijing University and Wuhan University. Being a CAPS major provided her with great experiences and useful knowledge that she will take with her into future professional environments. In October of 2020, Emily will be heading down to Pensacola, Florida, to start her training as a Navy Pilot.\n\nKatherine Selley\n\nKate chose Cornell for three reasons: the China & Asia-Pacific Studies Program in Arts & Sciences, the climate change minor in CALS, and the opportunity to join an up-and-coming sailing team. Her freshman and sophomore year she was on the Varsity Sailing Team, which taught her teamwork and patience. Junior year Kate interned in the fall at the Atlantic Council, a prominent think tank in Washington D.C., then in the spring at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. These experiences abroad taught her resilience, professionalism and independence. Kate spent her senior year learning leadership by working as the student program assistant for her major.\n\nCornell has taught Kate that she can't do everything, but she can choose to do anything. It's never too late to make a career change or learn something new. Kate will start her career at USTDA as a Research Analyst working to solve IndoPac and climate issues.\n\nWendy Chen | | 陈宇莉\n\nWendy is involved with the Asian American community on campus as an intern at the Asian American Studies Resource Center in Rockefeller Hall.

He would like to thank his fellow CAPS students, who were never hesitant to lend him a helping hand as well as his CAPS instructors, who opened him to a vast world of new ideas and possibilities. He would like to thank his family above all else, without whom none of the wonderful moments he’s shared at Cornell University would be possible.\n\nShane Eccleston |肖盛恩\n\nWhen not studying Chinese or writing papers Shane has spent much of his time exploring upstate New York and beyond! From case competitions in Albany, semesterly Orchid sales in Rochester, and Amish Craft shows in Penn Yan, his most beloved memories are those where he got away from Cornell, and explored the hidden gems upstate New York had to offer. When not out exploring and actually on campus, Shane spent much of his time hanging out with friends and acting as an active member of the community at Von Cramm Cooperative where he served as President for one semester. After graduation, Shane will be moving to Hoboken, NJ to work as a Category Specialist at Jet.com with a fellow CAPS graduate.\n\nShauna Hwang | 黃湘嫒\n\nShauna is from Austin, TX and received her three Bachelors of Arts degrees in China and Asia-Pacific Studies, Government, and Asian Studies from the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell University.

Shauna would like to thank her family and friends for the consistent support and encouragement they provided throughout her time at Cornell and remains steadfastly committed to making them proud.\n\nJohn Payne | 潘强\n\nJohn wrote for some magazines--The Thread and the Business Asia Journal--and decided not to write for some others. John and his freshman roommate, Yuji, developed a weird, new language and indulged in the fattening art form known as pizza delivery. He joined a fraternity, Phi Delta Theta, where others call me “J.P.” and he called his room “the hole.” My brothers are kind, whip-smart, and have always supported me, as they support each other. On a whim, John joined the Language House and downed many gallons of coffee to sustain his Chinese over four weekly dinners. He made many fast friends without whom he would never have come to see this place as his home. He will be returning to Beijing to join a consulting company, spend his weekends in the library (proof you can never take the Cornell out of the student) and prepare for a career--someday, if that day ever comes--doing what he loves most: learning from others, and sharing what he knows. He will always hold his memories of Cornell close; he wishes the whole world was like this impossible place, his home.\n\nChasen Richards | 潘强\n\nChasen Richards transferred to Cornell in Spring of 2016 from the United States Military Academy at West Point. Outside of academics, he is a Director at Cornell Consulting, President of the Business Asia Journal, a member of the Cornell Political Union and an Active Citizen in William Keeton House. The experiences and opportunities afforded to him in these organizations and through the CAPS major have helped to shape his career goals, and after graduation he will be starting out as a Business Analyst at McKinsey & Company's New York Office. Cornell has deeply shaped Chasen's worldview and goals, and much of these experiences were gained through the CAPS program.\n\nAndrew Wilson | 魏文卓\n\nAndrew had a difficult time choosing highlights from his time at Cornell because it almost seems like one long highlight of his life, but if he had to choose he would definitely include his four months in China. He says China rather than Beijing because he truly got to travel all over the country. From Guiyang to Tianjin, from Xian to Taishan, he feel so lucky to have had the chance to get to see so much of the country that we otherwise only learn about from second-hand sources. He remembers some days, the important ones usually, better than others. He knows he will remember every day he spent in China for his whole life and is grateful for the fellow students that he shared the experience with.\n\nAnother highlight for Andrew was learning Chinese. And he can use this as a highlight because as we all know it goes beyond the classroom. Learning a language is unique, and unlike most other things taught in school in that it's more of a skill than a type of knowledge. We have to keep practicing, His own attempt to master one of the most challenging languages even lead him to an intensive 8 week course at Beijing Normal University last summer, where he worked harder than he ever had before. Still, he believes learning any language, Chinese in particular, is one of the most valuable things we can get out of an education. As far as the future goes, his only plans as of right now are going back home.\n\nNiall Chithelen | 齐力垚\n\nDouble major with History.

Clara also participated in the International Teaching Assistant Program where she taught English to international teaching assistants. Becoming a CAPS student was one of the best decisions Clara made at Cornell, she thoroughly enjoyed her year abroad in Washington, D.C., and Beijing. Clara owes much to the connections that she made through the CAPS program, whether that would be her fellow students or her professors, and she is grateful that they have been able to be a part of her self-discovery journey in college.\n\nKathy Wang | 王凯西\n\nKathy is pursuing her Masters of Professional Studies in Information Science at Cornell.

Robin is incredibly grateful for CIAS, through which she met many of her closest friends and helped organize conferences for thousands of other students, including Cornell’s first overseas Model UN conference in Chengdu, China. She is also very happy to feel at home in the CAPS community and is pleased to have seen it grow and develop. She hopes to stay connected and see it further strengthen. Robin’s favorite classes outside of CAPS were French Stylistics, Behavioral Public Policy, Social Psychology, and all 8 PE classes. Overall, Robin is thankful for all the opportunities she’s had to expand her knowledge and step outside of her comfort zone. She hopes to have left a positive impact on the people she’s met.\n\nMaximiliano Alaghband | 艾立德\n\nMax is currently living in Taiwan and has spent the past year traveling across Asia, specifically seeing Zen monasteries in Japan.

She had a vague idea of what lay ahead, from conversations with her mother growing up: things like “adventure,” “self-discovery,” and a community of scholars as dedicated as she was to learning and growing as a person. But she had no idea she would end up studying Mandarin Chinese, traveling to China—twice—and exploring life in Washington, D.C. Sarah didn’t realize she would make true, lasting friends and have a place away from home where she truly belonged. From playing on the Cornell Women’s Rugby team and singing with Jazz Voices and Exploosh—the university’s only improvisation acapella group—to participate in the Princeton in Beijing intensive language-study program and later interning at the Beijing Review in China, she filled her four years with experiences that she’ll treasure for a lifetime.\n\nAfter graduation, she plans to return home and work as a paralegal at an Atlanta law firm and to later apply to law school. She is unsure of what, exactly, the future holds, but she has faith and confidence that experiences even more beautiful and exciting than those behind her lie ahead.\n\nHee Kyung (Anna) Kook | 鞠希京\n\nDouble major with Government.
