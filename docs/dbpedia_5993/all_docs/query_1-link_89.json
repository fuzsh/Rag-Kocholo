        "text": "In 2006, the BYU Board of Trustees renamed the Institute for the Study and Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts (ISPART) the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship. A variety of academic initiatives have been brought under its umbrella. Executive directors have included Andrew C. Skinner (2006-2008) and M. Gerald Bradford (2008- ).\n\nVariant names\n\nMaxwell Institute\n\nDescription\n\nEstablished: 2006\n\nLocation: Provo, Utah (2006- )\n\nFunctions\n\nThe Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship was established to promote scholarship supporting the restored gospel of Jesus Christ through research, publication of critically edited, primary resources (ancient religious texts) for scholars and lay persons around the world, building bridges of understanding and goodwill to Muslim scholars by providing superior editions of primary texts, and providing an anchor of faith in a sea of Mormon studies. In 2013 the institute formalized its mission statement to focus on deepening understanding and nurturing discipleship among Latter-day Saints, as well as promoting mutual respect and goodwill among people of all faiths through the scholarly study of religious texts and traditions.\n\nAssets and Administrative Structure\n\nThe Maxwell Institute is an organized research unit on the Provo, Utah, campus. Its scholars (research fellows) focus their study on a select number of sacred and religious texts and the traditions within which they are situated. Under the direction of an executive director, who acts in the same capacity as a dean of an academic department, the scholars oversee the Center for the Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts (CPART), the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), the Middle Eastern Texts Initiative (METI), the Research Technology Group (RTG), and the Laura F. Willes Center for Book of Mormon Studies. Each division functions under the direction of a director with the whole Institute functioning under the direction of an executive director.\n\nThe Institute publishes three scholarly journals and a number of books each year that deal with subjects directly related to its workâ€”titles on the Book of Mormon (including the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies), on the Bible and the ancient world (including Studies in the Bible and Antiquity), and on important medieval Middle Eastern texts. Its contributions to Mormon studies are principally contained in the pages of the Mormon Studies Review. Some of its book titles serve to commend and defend the faith more directly by exploring the relationship between discipleship and scholarship.\n\nAssociated Units\n\nSuperior unit: Brigham Young University (2006-)\n\nEarlier unit: Institute for the Study and Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts (2006)\n\nSubordinate unit: Center for the Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts (2006-)\n\nSubordinate unit: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (2006-2010)\n\nSubordinate unit: Middle Eastern Texts Initiative (2006-)\n\nSubordinate unit: Neal A.
