MICHAEL BELLANTONI\n\nI write to inform you that we already issued those documents to accompany your $5,000 payment each day. But the only problem we are having right here is your personal signatures which the Federal Administer of Fund Benin Republic requested that you must sign those documents before we can transfer funds to you. However, I told the officer in charge that it will not be necessary for you to come down here due to your occupation or some other thing that may not allow you to come down here to sign those documents yourself. The Minster Administrator of Fund said that you should get an attorney to sign on your behalf if you are unable to come down here in person.\n\nI think this way is the best and the only way forward for you to receive the funds. I have negotiated with an attorney who would sign on your behalf. His name is Sam Floyd. According to him you are to pay for the accredited attorney. He is charging $120.00 to be paid before he gets those documents signed in your favor. I told him to consider signing those documents on your behalf today with a promise that you would pay him back from the $5,000\n\nPayment you suppose to receive tomorrow morning if he gets those documents signed today.\n\nAnd his respond is that you have to pay the accredited attorney fee of $120.00 before signing those documents. Well, I asked him for the very last time if he could allow you pay half of his fee today with a promise that you would pay him the Remain balance tomorrow from your $5,000 payment at the western union office once you pick up the $5,000 payment. Well, he said that you should pay the half of the fee $60.00 through western union\n\nToday He want me to ask you if you would be so kind to pay him back The remain $60.00 balance at the western union office once you picked up the $5,000 pay out each day. I am hereby this writing to ask you to let me know if you would pay his balance immediately you pick up the $5,000 payment.\n\nHe wants you to pay half of $60.00 today if you are so kind to pay the balance at the western union office once you picked up the $5,000 payment tomorrow. But if you are not kind enough to pay his balance after picking the first transfer just do not bother yourself not to reply because I wonât see another attorney here to do this. Here is information for you to pay $60.00 half of his fee through western union today.\n\nSend the half of the fee $60.00 today via Money Gram or Western Union;\n\n1. Receiver Name: ======= ANTHONY CHIOKWE\n\n2. City=============Cotonou\n\n3. Country: ==========Benin Republic.\n\n3. Question=============who is Able\n\n4. Answer: =============God\n\n5.

I trained and work as an external auditor for Bank of Scotland. I Work as part of a bigger team that covers the entire Scotland and England region. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours.\n\nOn routine audit check last month, I discovered some investment accounts that have been dormant for the last fourteen (14) years, all the accounts belonging to a single holder with monies totalling a little above (41,100,000.00) Forty-one Million One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. Banking regulation in Singapore demands that the fiscal authorities are notified when accounts are dormant for this period, so that the funds can be called in by the regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposal.\n\nMy investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1997â the exact time the account was last operated, I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died intestate and no nextâofâkin has been found or has come forward all these years. I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage and working with you, we can secure the funds instead of allowing it pass as an unclaimed fund into the coffers of the UK Government. This is especially possible as you bear the same LAST NAME to the said investor, and can stand as his extended relative.. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation.\n\nI have seized all relevant documents (Legal and Banking) including access to the very account of the deceased. This will facilitate my putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. You shall be rewarded for your part in this transaction with 40% of the total funds for your efforts, less any expenses. I shall however leave out the final details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate. Be assured that I am on top of the situation. There will be no risk involved whatsoever if you agree to come on board. Needless to say, UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction. I guarantee that the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect us from any breach of law.\n\nTo affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please contact me through email stating the followings:-\n\n(1) Full Name;\n\n(2) Telephone, Fax and Mobile Numbers;\n\n(3) Postal Address:\n\n(4) Occupation;\n\nYour prompt response will be highly appreciated.\n\nKind Regards\n\nMr Frank Lennox\n\nEmail:frank_lennox65 yahoo.com.sg\n\nTel:+447045723529\n\nSubject: !CLAIM NOTIFICATION!!!\n\nCLAIM NOTIFICATION.\n\nWe the management of FedEx Courier Service heree in South Africa hereby uses This medium to notify you that your parcel is still in our possession, this parcel contained an International Cashier Bank Draft/Cheque worth the sum of $500,000.00USD (Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) and it is ready for delivery to your door step.

No compensation can make up for the risk we have taken with our lives in this hell hole, my brother in-law was killed by a road side bomb just few months ago, and I cannot count how many times GOD has saved my life down here.\n\nNow i found a very reliable way of sending a trunk metallic box containing the amount of United States Dollars worth Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars(US$ 12.5 Million) as you must agree with me it has been hell on earth trying to keep this money safe from people's eyes for all these while and with this opportunity all I need is just someone capable I can trust 100% I can send the box to.\n\nSo if you can assure me of your honesty I will go ahead and send the box to you for safe keeping till I am back home and I will gladly give you 40% of the money.\n\nIf this okay with you please get back to me with the following so i can get the box across to you.\n\n1. Your full name\n\n2. Contact address\n\n3. Telephone number\n\n4. Occupation.\n\nWaiting to hear from you.\n\nYours in Service.\n\nSgt. G.

If so, thanks be to God almighty. My name is Miss Sabinah Jonah, of mende tribe in BUAKE, Cote d'Ivoire. I am 22years old. my father until his death was the king of our tribe and also one of the richest highly reputable business man (a cocoa merchant and supplier of agro allied material ) who operated in Abidjan, capital of Cote d'Ivoire during his days. It is sad to say that my father was poisoned to death by his business associates, which my uncle being his younger brother who immediately announced himself, not up to a week my father died as the king of mende tribe in BUAKE, who is also suspected to be involved or master planned my Fathers death on one of their outings on a business trip to France.\n\nThey plotted and poisoned him with the accusation that he is a great sponsor and in support to restore the democratically elected president of LAURENT GBAGBO,who was the former president of Cote d'Ivoire. Before the death of my father on February 2007 in a private hospital here in Abidjan he secretly called me on his bed side and told me that he has the sum of Five million, Five hundred thousand United State Dollars. (USD$5.500,000) deposited in a bank here in Abidjan. He used my name being the only child as the next of kin(beneficiary)to the fund.\n\nNow, I have in my possession the deposit certificate and all the vital documents which the Bank gave to my late father when he deposited the money.I believe that the the people that murdered my father are seriously after me, after my father's younger brother have succeeded in claiming my late father's landed properties. I have been on a hide out all this while, because he is still seriously looking for me. He believed according to our culture that I am a woman so I have know right over my father's properties because I will be married out from the family by another man. I really do not know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of this, running from one place to another, Now i am staying in a remote(local) village with an Apostolic church pastor and his family.The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.\n\nI am in a sincere desire of your assistance in this regards.I will like you to help me transfer this money to your country as soon as possible so that i can come over to your country and continue my Education there while you look for a very good Lucretia business you can invest on for me since i am still too young to handle a business that will need such huge amount of money.\n\nNow permit me to ask these few questions:-\n\n1. Can you honestly and willingly help me as your sister/daughter?\n\n2. Can I completely trust you?\n\n3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you after the money is in your country?\n\n4. To make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my education and to secure a resident permit in your country for me.\n\nPlease, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.\n\nMy sincere regard\n\nMiss Sabinah Jonah\n\nMessage du 25/03/13 23:07\n\nDe : \"John Doe\"\n\nA : \"Miss Sabina Joneh\"\n\nCopie Ã :\n\nObjet : Re: hi\n\nWhy don't you contact our Government officials?

I want you to know that i took this solid decision because of my condition here. Since the death of my father, i have been living a sorrowful life here. My uncle just after two weeks my father died succeeded in claiming my father's landed property and he is seriously after me because he is aware that i am the next of kin to my father's wealth since i am the only child. when my father was alive, i was in one of the best school here in my country. I have been on the run since my father's death and now i am living with one of the Apostolic church pastor and his family in a local village very far from my state. i do not go to the city and i live all my life in fear, no school no friends. I want to be free and lastly i want to continue with my education.\n\nI have a strong feeling that you will see me through and help me with all your heart. So i want to count and rely on you and i want you to come out fully and help me. I am always in contact with the bank where my late father lodged the fund and i have every of the documents given to my father by the bank on the day he deposited the fund. My plan is that as soon as the fund is transferred into your account, you arrange for my papers immediately to come over there. Then look for at least one of the best school in your country for me because i will want to continue with my education while you\n\nlook for a very good lucrative business and invest the money there for me.\n\nNow if you are ready, i want you to give me your full assurance by sending to me your Identity passport or photograph, your office and home address and phone number. As soon as i get this information, i will go to the bank in the city and introduce you formally as my trustee and guardian and also i need to know you. I have all the documents given to my father by the bank on the day he deposited the money with them.\n\nYour's sincerely\n\nMiss Sabina Jonah\n\nSubject: ,,,,,,,,Your Life Is In Danger Asassin Urgent Response,,,,,,,,\n\nYou have been betrayed!!!

Presently, I'm in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment.\n\nI am Mrs. SABINE LORENZ SMITH, i am deaf and suffering from a long time cancer of the lungs which also affected my brain, from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating and it is quite obvious that, according to my doctors they have advised me that i may not live for the next two months, this is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage. I was brought up from a motherless babyâs home, and i was married to my late husband for twenty years without a child. My husband died in a fatal auto crash. Before his death we were true Christians and Since his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited belongings and deposited all the sum of $11 million dollars with a Security Company and also deposited the sum of 3.2million USD with ICB BANK MALAYSIA.\n\nMoreover this money is still with them and the management just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the money for keeping it so long or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I cannot come over because of my illness or they get it confiscated\n\nPresently, I'm with my laptop in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer of the lungs. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the development of evangelism and charity in Africa, America, Europe and Asian Countries. I took this decision, before i rest in peace because my time will soon be up. I also donât want to die and leave my funds like this lady who left 13Million Usd for a cat here is her link\n\nAs soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security Company. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the new beneficiary of my fund. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Lastly, I want you to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health.

I am an investment advisory specialist with a known bank. I also worked as a discretionary investment specialist with Ernest and Young in the United States before joining the bank where i am at present. It is my duty to provide the mega clients with customized investment opportunities through equity, fixed income, derivatives and innovative structured instruments that seek to meet specific investment opportunities.\n\nJust a week ago, i was informed that we had lost a very important client with little details on what may have caused his sudden demise. Subsequently, this client is a mega client who only recently allocated $76m in a multi-asset class portfolio investment package. His records are yet to be entered in the system, because he delayed in completing the contractual agreement. Even as am emailing you now, the money is being processed for alternative investment which is the routine procedure when a client did not mention a beneficiary.\n\nWe can arrange to transfer the funds to a safe account, since it is not on records as yet. I will be most willing to part with only 75% of the money while you get the rest %25. Please give it a thought to be sure that you won't be bothered providing the safe account. I am a frequent flyer, so i will prepare to meet you under secure arrangements to discuss my own transfer once the money has been secured in your account, however your consent to assist with the safe account will prove worthwhile as time continues to tick by the seconds. In other words, I have limited time to finalize this objective.\n\nNevertheless, it is my modest believe that the key to a successful investment relationship is a complete understanding. All i need from you is your full names, address, contact telephone/fax, present occupation and designated banking details ( for the transfer to take full course).\n\nI decided to leave the subject of this email as \"EQUITY\", to disguise the contents because of the value of the transaction and the abject need for utmost confidentiality.\n\nYou may email me and i will leave my telephone number in response.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSimon Morgan\n\nSubject: PLEASE CAN I TRUST YOU(SEE ATTACHED LETTER FOR DETAILS}\n\nHello Dear,\n\nWith profound respect and humble submission, I beg to state the following few lines for your kind consideration, I hope you will spare some of your valuable minutes to read the following appeal with sympathetic mind. I must confess that it is with great hopes, joy and enthusiasm that I write to you this mail, which I know and believe by faith that it must surely find you in good condition of health. My name is Miss Angela Lisa Kinto, I am 23 years old.\n\nI'm from Liberia in West Africa and presently, I am residing in the refugee camp here in South Africa as a result of the civil war in my country. I was a first year student of law at the university before the incident that led me into this situation of been in refugee camp in South Africa. I'm a very simple, honest, respectful, Caring, sincere and romantic girl.\n\nMy late father Dr. Kinto Murvee was the Managing Director of Rainbow Gold and Diamond Mine Company, also a successful exporter of Cocoa during his life time. I am the only daughter of my parent. It is sad that the rebels attacked my house one early morning killing my mother and my father. Equally my mother was a senior lecturer at the university before her untimely death. I don't have any relative now whom I can go to, all my relatives ran away in the middle of the war.\n\nI am the only survivor in my family because I am the only child of my parent.\n\nAfter the recent crisis that resulted to the death of my parent, I was taken to South Africa for safety by Red Cross under Catholic Caritas as an asylum, which is how I came to the Camp. As a refugee here I don't have any right or privilege to anything be it money or whatever because it is against the law of this country.\n\nPlease listen to this carefully, I have my late father's Fund Deposit sleep and Deposit Agreement and death certificate here with me, because when he was alive he deposited some amount of money in a security company in South Africa which he used my name as the next of kin, the amount in question is Seven Million, Nine Hundred Thousand United State Dollars (USD$7,900,000.00).\n\nAlready I have informed this security company about my intention to claim my late father's deposit. The security company told me to look for a foreign partner who will assist me in transferring the funds due to my refugee status here, as a refugee I am not allowed to the right of claim to the money but through an appointed representative as the united refugee law governing refugee all over the world states.\n\nNow I want an honest and GOD fearing partner overseas who will assist me in transferring this money. I kept this secret to people in the camp here; you are the only person that I am telling this. So I will like you to help me to transfer this money to your account and from it you can send some money for me to get my travelling documents and air ticket to come and reside permanently in your country till such a time that it will be convenient for me to return back home if I so desire. This is because I have suffered a lot of setbacks as a result of incessant political crisis in Liberia.\n\nThe death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I also want to invest this fund under your care in any business of your choice since I'm still too young to manage it. I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.\n\nNow permit me to ask these few questions:\n\n1. Can you honestly help me from your heart?\n\n2. Can I completely trust you? 3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you after the fund has being transferred to your account and I come over to meet you? Please, consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.\n\nImmediately I confirm your willingness, I will send to you my Picture and also inform you more details involved in this matter. In summary, I will like you to keep it to yourself and don't tell it to anyone for I am afraid of losing my life and the money.\n\nReply to my private email address: angelakin222 gmail.com\n\nKind Regards,\n\nMiss Angela.kinto\n\nSubject: Reminder Your Abandoned Consignment Response Needed\n\nHello,\n\nI am Mr. Marvin Carradine a former US Army Contractor presently working as the Assistant Director Inspection Unit of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) USA. During our recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment left by a diplomat from Baghdad who was supposed to deliver these packages to you but failed to provide necessary clearances needed by the US Customs and when scanned recently, it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in two Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 25kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as âMONEY?rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is about $3,800 USD.\n\nOn my assumption, each of the boxes will contain more than $2 Million to $2.5 Million each and the consignment is still left at our Storage House here at the Los Angeles Int Airport till date which was delivered through a registered shipping Company known Courier Dispatch Service Limited a division of Tran guard LTD. Approximately, the details of the consignment includes your name, your email address and the official document from the United Nations office in Geneva and are all tagged on the Metal Trunk boxes.\n\nHowever, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city and other details. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my \"SECURED\" email address for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk boxes, I can get everything concluded within 3-6 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.\n\nLastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned shipment is because I want us to transact this business and share the money together in the trunk boxes since the consignment has not yet been returned to the United states Treasury Department after being abandoned by the shipper so immediately the confirmation is made, I will pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee and arrange for the boxes to be moved out of this Airport to your address. Once we are through with this process, I will deploy the services of a secured shipping Company geared towards providing the security it needs to your doorstep. Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble. But I will share it 70%/30% with you. But you have to assure me of my 30% share.\n\nBelow are my direct telephone numbers as I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive.\n\nMr. Marvin Carradine\n\nAssistance Inspection Director\n\nLos Angles International Airport\n\nLos Angeles, CA90045, United States (LAX)\n\nSubject: CASH PAYMENT NOTIFICATION.\n\nYou have been approved the sum of $1,500,000.00USD by UN/WESTERN UNION and we have been instructed to start sending you $7,600.00 USD daily.\n\nYou will need to Contact Mrs.Franca Lee @ +601-126-433-169 for more information on this program with your Names,Address and Phone Number to (unwumtcenter mail.mn) for payment inquiry.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJim Burch\n\nSubject: GREETINGS\n\nGREETINGS;\n\nI am sorry to encroach into your privacy in this manner, I found your name listed in the Trade Center Chambers of Commerce directory here in Iraq, I find it pleasurable to offer you my partnership in business.

My name is David Lang, I am a board member of the NNPC.\n\nI am sending you a formal proposal which I would like you to go through and consider.\n\nMy proposal may come as a surprise to you, especially as we have never met before. In our global community which is now connected by the internet and advanced communication technologies, we are all strangers first before we become acquaintances, friends and life partners.\n\nI seek your assistance and co-operation to facilitate the remittance of twenty (20) million dollars into your designated bank account or any account that you can arrange for this purpose. The money in question was secured by me with the help of a few others from an inflated contract awarded to a Chinese construction firm, and completed recently.\n\nYou may be tempted to judge us on this but you should know that this happens in every country from South America, the U.S, Europe, Middle East and Asia. You probably don't get to hear about it in your own country.\n\nThe original awarded contract sum to this Chinese firm was one hundred and fifty million dollars. However, in collusion with the executives of this firm at the time, the contract was inflated to cost one hundred and seventy million dollars. The extra twenty million was our own kick back for awarding the contract to them. The contract was approved by our ministry of finance and one hundred and seventy million was deposited with a local bank which acted as the paying bank for the contract. The Chinese firm was fully paid leaving the balance of twenty million behind for us to share.\n\nRight now the money at the bank is pending payment and I require a substitute account for the funds to be paid into. This is the reason for sending you this email. I am asking for your assistance if you have the facility to enable us remit the money into your account. If you are interested, you can get in touch with me via email. Just click 'reply' introduce yourself and also provide a telephone number that I can reach you on.\n\nAfter the exchange of contact information, we shall open all channels of communication and negotiate what your percentage will be for enabling this. This must be done before we can proceed.\n\nFinally when the money is remitted into your account, I will obtain a visa and travel to meet you to conclude our arrangement.\n\nYou should see this as an opportunity. It is a lot of money and this is very real and I am very real and credible. The only way you will know for sure is if you accept my proposal and commit yourself wholeheartedly to this.\n\nIf you are not interested, then I apologize for the intrusion and for wasting your valuable time. You can delete this email.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nRegards,\n\nDavid Lang\n\nEmail: dlang dr.com\n\nSubject: Top\n\nALERT of 1 million British currency from Msn Â® Uk. provide\n\nName-\n\nAddress-\n\nSex-\n\nAge,-\n\nMobile Number --\n\nOccupation:\n\nSubject: Contact Western Union\n\nAttention,\n\nWe have concluded to effect your payment of $1.5Million, through western union, but the maximum amount you will be receiving each day starting from today is $5000.00 daily until the funds is completely transferred.Reconfirm to us your full details to avoid a mistake.\n\nCall us so that we can tell you what next to do. +22998344980\n\nThank you.\n\nRelpy email (w_unionbj barid.com)\n\nMr. George Yaha\n\nSubject: This is your time....\n\nhi\n\nUnless you have been living under a rock Iâm sure by now, youâve already downloaded for free the most popular investment software on the planetâ¦..

CALL OR EMAIL ME\n\nHi,\n\nI am Mr. Scott C. Tooley the Assistant Director Inspection of the TSA, the Transportation and Safety Administration in Des Moines International Airport, Iowa, USA. During my recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment by a Diplomat and, when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in two Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 25kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents were not properly declared by the consignee as âMONEYâ rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is about $3,800 USD.\n\nOn my assumption, each of the boxes will contain more than $1 Million to $1.5 Million each and the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the Des Moines International Airport till date. The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official document from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Metal Trunk boxes.\n\nHowever, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of the Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance processes so, as a result I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address which is (too.scott200@usa.com) for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk boxes, I can get everything concluded within 3-6 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.\n\nLastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want to assist you receive your consignment in return for a good compensation, since the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat. Immediately the confirmation is made, I will make every necessary arrangement that is required and arrange for the boxes to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble. But you have to assure me of a 30% share.\n\nBelow is my direct telephone number but if you are unable to reach me know that I am on inspection just email me and make sure you include your mobile number so that I can give you a call. I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive.\n\nMr. Scott C.
