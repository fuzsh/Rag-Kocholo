Born May 1931, Denny, Scotland. Educated in Scotland; served two tours with RAF before joining RCAF in Toronto, 1956; posted to No.433 Squadron, December 1957. Uniform held by Canadian War Museum. During an Air Defence Exercise on May 24, 1960, Flying Officer Alexander was the navigator in a CF-100 aircraft which was participating in an aircraft interception at 43,000 feet. Shortly thereafter, the pilot of the aircraft suffered extreme anoxia. He was receiving no oxygen whatsoever as the result of a fault in his oxygen system. Flying Officer Alexander instructed the pilot to descend. The pilot responded and commenced an immediate descent but could not actuate his emergency oxygen supply. Flying Officer Alexander elected to remain with the aircraft and continue to talk the pilot into bringing the aircraft under control from an extremely erratic descent. Flying Officer Alexander noted at one point that their speed was 650 knots and they then entered the cloud deck at 7,000 feet still in a dive. The pilot gradually responded to instructions and pulled the aircraft out of the dive but the aircraft ended up in an inverted position. Flying Officer Alexander then successfully managed to instruct the pilot to roll the aircraft into a strait and level flight at approximately 10,000 feet. A ground control landing approach was then commenced. The pilot did not respond to instructions given by the GCA Controller and it was necessary for Flying Officer Alexander to guide the pilot all the way down. The pilot was still under the effects of anoxia upon landing to the extent that he did not round out but flew onto the runway. It was also necessary for Flying Officer Alexander to instruct him on braking action and direction. After a successful landing, the pilot remembered practically nothing of what had taken place. Flying Officer Alexander, when faced with the decision of ejecting or remaining with the aircraft, chose to remain in an effort to save his pilot and aircraft. Through coolness and devotion to duty he managed to avert what would have been a fatal accident.\n\n* * * * *\n\nALLEN, Flying Officer Gerald Wilfred (19905) – King’s Commendation for Valuable Services in the Air – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 28 August 1948 and AFRO 524/48. As of award he was serving at Station Lachine. Certificate forwarded 3 May 1951. As co-pilot of the Magnetic Survey Canso in 1947, Flying Officer Allen proved himself to be an extremely alert and adaptable pilot. At all times he applied his skill in handling the aircraft under the most difficult and unique conditions with great intelligence. On several occasions during hazardous landing in rough seas and amongst ice flows he assisted the captain in averting catastrophe. In spite of many hardships which the crew endured this officer maintained a happy and infectious disposition, making light of adversity, and promoting a high morale. If is considered that Flying Officer Allen contributed in a large share to the expedition’s success and that his all round performance is deserving of great praise.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBARNES, Flight Lieutenant William Roy, CD (216445) – Queen’s Commendation for Brave Conduct – awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 28 May 1966. On the night of 28 July 1965, Flight Lieutenant Barnes was Captain of a CF-104 dual aircraft which experienced a serious in-flight engine malfunction near the city of Munich. At a height of 500 feet, the engine nozzle area went to the full open position because of material failure which resulted in a drastic reduction of engine power. Flight Lieutenant Barnes immediately instituted the authorized emergency procedure to release the nozzle, but to no avail. He was now in the unenviable position of having to decide whether to remain with the aircraft which lacked sufficient power to maintain height, or to abandon the aircraft which almost certainly would have crashed into the city of Munich. Electing to remain with the aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Barnes ordered the second pilot to radio the international distress call. A radar control agency replied giving directions to a suitable aerodrome but to comply would have placed the aircraft over the centre of Munich. Electing to ignore these instructions, Flight Lieutenant Barnes continues his heading away from the centre of Munich when he received directions from another radar agency for an alternative aerodrome. Accepting these instructions he commenced an approach to Furstenfeldbruck aerodrome. This aerodrome, close to Munich, had no approach lighting and the runway lights were dimmed because of emergency power operation. Notwithstanding these difficulties he was able to complete the approach and safely land the aircraft. This act of cool courage in a critical situation averted what cold have been an catastrophe involving considerable loss of life.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBATCOCK, Flying Officer Clive Charles (135671) – Air Force Cross – No.422 Squadron, No.4 (F) Wing – awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 29 October 1960 and AFRO 222/60. On March 2, 1960, while taking part in a practice air fighting mission in a Sabre aircraft, Flying Officer Batcock’s aircraft suffered an engine failure. At that time, he was positioned about 50 miles from base at 42,000 feet with sky completely undercast beneath him. The cloud extended from an uneven base from 1,000 to 5.000 feet and was unbroken to 30,000 feet. Beneath the cloud, visibility was limited by rain and fog. Under these conditions, Flying Officer Batcock, with serious risk to his life, completed a superb forced landing at his home base. Throughout the descent, he remained calm and collected and followed all recognized procedures to cope with the emergency situation with precision and accuracy. Flying Officer Batcock could have, without condemnation, abandoned the aircraft. However, a free-falling aircraft would have been a definite menace to his home base and other populated areas in the vicinity. Flying Officer Batcock’s skill, courage and sense of responsibility saved a costly aircraft and the lives of others who might have been endangered by a falling aircraft. His devotion to duty, skill and courage have served as an inspiration and splendid example to fellow aircrew. He is highly recommended as being most worthy of the Air Force Cross.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBIRCHALL, G/C Leonard Joseph, OBE, DFC (C775) – Officer, Legion of Merit (United States) – awarded as per AFRO 443/50 dated 8 September 1950. Born 6 July 1915 in St.Catharines, Ontario; home in St.Johns, Ontario. Served in Lincoln Regiment (1932-1933); enrolled in Royal Military College, 1933; to Royal Canadian Corps of Signals in 1934 and RCAF (P/P/O, 5 July 1937). Received wings, 20 May 1938 and posted to No.5 (BR) Squadron, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Signal specialist with Eastern Air Command Headquarters, 1940; Chief Navigation Officer at No.2 Training Command, Winnipeg, 1941. Posted to No.413 Squadron, Shetland Islands, 1941; shot down and taken prisoner, 5 April 1942; became Senior Allied Officer, POW work camp, Yokohama. Repatriated to Canada in October 1945.

DFC and OBE presented 29 April 1949. Awarded Queen’s Coronation Medal, 23 October 1953 while Group Captain at Air Material Command Headquarters. Appointed Honourary Colonel, No.413 Squadron, June 1989. See also RMC Club Newsletter (November 1982), Air Force (issues for March, June and September 1983); “Trenton to Dartmouth; An Anecdotal Account of Flying in the RCAF, 1937-1940” in Journal of the Canadian Aviation Historical Society, Volume XXIII No.2 (June 1985). Group Captain Leonard J. Birchall, Royal Canadian Air Force, distinguished himself by exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services from 4 April 1942 to 20 June 1950. As Senior Officer in the Japanese Prisoner of War Camp at Yokohama, Group Captain (then Wing Commander) Birchall worked tirelessly and fearlessly to improve the physical and mental welfare of British, American and Canadian prisoners under his command. His exploits became legendary throughout Japan and brought renewed faith and strength to many hundreds of ill and disheartened prisoners. Subsequent to his liberation he contributed information and material of inestimable value in connection with war crimes investigations. More recently, as Deputy to the Air Member, Canadian Joint Staff, Washington, D.C., Group Captain Birchall has constantly demonstrated a superior understanding of the relationship between the United States Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force and his sound judgement, tact and unfailing spirit of cooperation have materially assisted the Permanent Joint Board on Defence, Canada-United States in the accomplishment of its mission.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBLANK, Corporal Phillip Edmund, CD (203738) – British Empire Medal – No.103 Rescue Unit, Greenwood – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 5 September 1964 and AFRO 37/64 (same date).\n\nOn the morning of 20 February 1964, Corporal Blank was the jumpmaster of a three-man para-rescue team aboard an Albatross aircraft engaged in a search for a missing seal hunter, Albert Muise, in the Gulf of St.Lawrence. When the hunter was sighted, it was determined that his only hope of rescue was in landing of the aircraft and evacuation by a small rubber boat which was aboard. The aircraft was landed in perilous conditions, amidst flow ice, and Corporal Blank, after the boat was launched by his para-rescue team, immediately stepped into it and set off to rescue Mr.Muise who was stranded on a small ice pan some fifty feet behind the aircraft. The weather was deteriorating, temperature was at the freezing point, and the sea was running in three to four foot waves with a heavy chop. Corporal Blank, well aware that his flimsy craft might be torn by the jagged ice, might easily capsize, or that the life-line attached to the aircraft might tear free and leave him adrift, pressed on with the rescue. The boat’s outboard motor was quickly swamped and Corporal Blank had to drift, paddle and fend off floe ice to reach Mr.Muise’s position. When the boat came close enough, Mr.Muise jumped towards it and was pulled aboard by Corporal Blank. With a difficult and dangerous return to the aircraft, the rescue was completed. Demonstrating devotion to duty of a high order, Corporal Blank, without regard for his own safety, performed an act of bravery under extremely hazardous circumstances which was instrumental in saving a man’s life.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBLISS, Flight Lieutenant William Hamilton Forster (17822) – Air Medal (United States) – 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing (USAF) – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 26 June 1954 and AFRO 362/54 dated 2 July 1954. Born in Toronto, 8 June 1923; enlisted in RCAF, 31 July 1941; served overseas with No.412 Squadron; discharged 7 September 1945. Reenlisted 9 November 1948 and flew with No.410 Squadron aerobatic team. Retired 2 February 1971. See PL-90394 for photograph. See H.A. Halliday, “In Korean Skies”, Roundel, December 1963 and January 1964.\n\nFlight Lieutenant William H. Bliss distinguished himself by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight as a pilot, 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force, from 4 May 1953 to 16 June 1953. Flying an F-86 type aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Bliss accomplished many missions in support of United Nations operations in Korea. Although often faced with determined enemy opposition, the courage, aggressiveness and degree of skill with which Flight Lieutenant Bliss conducted his assignment contributed greatly to the ultimate success of the assigned missions. Through his personal courage, outstanding airmanship and exemplary devotion to duty, Flight Lieutenant Bliss reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces and the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBOWMAN, Sergeant Frederick Morison (22554) – Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Services in the Air – No.426 Squadron – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 7 June 1952 and AFRO 406/52 dated 13 June 1952. Born in Ancaster, Ontario; raised and educated in Dundas, Ontario. Serving at No.4 OTU at date of gazetting; certificate forwarded via Air Transport Command, 26 June 1952. Died in Ottawa, 19 December 1999.\n\nSergeant Bowman has served on the Korean Airlift since its inception as a Flight Engineer on North Star aircraft, having been attached to the Military Air Transport Service, USAF, as a member of 426 Transport Squadron on 26th July 1950. He has flown a total of 1,000 hours over the Pacific.\n\nThroughout his tour, Sergeant Bowman has displayed outstanding professional ability which he used with imagination and initiative to ensure expeditious handling of all flights.\n\nOn many occasions hazardous weather conditions were encountered and it was necessary to perform instrument let downs or land with the aid of GCA at the destinations. Sergeant Bowman’s experience, efficiency and co-operation with the captain of his aircraft during these conditions were in large part responsible for the success of the flights.\n\nThis non-commissioned officer’s untiring efforts have been a magnificent contribution to the success of the Royal Canadian Air Force’s participation in the United Nations’ effort in Korea.\n\nNOTE: His obituary in the Ottawa Citizen described him as a member of the Pre-War Club and the “doyen of Canadian Military Flight Engineers”. It also carried a quotation attributed to Leonardi da Vinci. The attribution may be incorrect, but the text and sentiment bear recording:\n\nWhen once you have tasted flight\n\nYou will forever walk the earth\n\nwith your eyes turned skyward,\n\nFor there you have been and\n\nthere you always long to return.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBURN, Flight Lieutenant Robert Edward (17486) – Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Services in the Air – No.426 Squadron – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 1 January 1953 and AFRO 10/53 dated 9 January 1953. From Hespeler, Ontario; born 1922.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Burn has served with No.426 Transport Squadron on the Korean Airlift since November 1951, as navigator of North Star aircraft. He has throughout all his flights to the Far East in support of United Nations operations in Korea, consistently exhibited navigational skill of a high order. His drive and ability coupled with his mature and enthusiastic interest in the Far Eastern route has been a source of inspiration to other members of the squadron and invaluable in the training of new navigation officers on the North Pacific crossings. Flight Lieutenant Burn has contributed in no small measure to the successful achievements of 426 Transport Squadron.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBURROWS, Flying Officer Sydney Edward (34099) – Air Force Cross – No.434 Squadron, No.4 (F) Wing – awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 30 July 1955 and AFRO 367/55 dated 30 July 1955. Born in Burnaby, British Columbia. Enlisted 1951 in Vancouver. Trained at Centralia (wings, 1952), Air Gunnery School (Macdonald, Manitoba) OTU (Chatham). Posted to Germany, March 1953. After accident described below he was graded as monocular and grounded; transferred to Flying Control duties. However, he lobbied and finally regained flying category on T-33 and Dakota Navigational Training aircraft. Commander, No.440 (Rescue) Squadron, 1968. In 1971 he went to No.424 Squadron Detachment, UN forces, Srinagar, Kashmir, flying a Twin Otter, Trenton to Kashmir. Later Base Operations Officer, Comox. Retired, September 1982. Later an executive with the Royal Canadian Legion.\n\nOn Monday, 13 September 1954, Flying Officer Burrows was flying a routine training mission as a member of a four plane formation of F-86 Sabre jets. While approximately 20 miles from No.4 (Fighter) Wing, Baden Soelingen, Germany, a bird struck the perspex canopy of Burrows’ aircraft, shattering the canopy. Pieces of the shattered canopy were imbedded in Flying Officer Burrows’ face and left eye. Partially blinded and covered with blood, this pilot retained control of his aircraft and quickly gave the international distress call of “Mayday”. He then had to tear off his helmet to clear his face and eyes, thus leaving him with no radio communications. The section leader, on determining the emergency, assigned a wing man to lead Flying Officer Burrows to 4 (Fighter) Wing. Although Burrows was losing blood, suffering great pain and shock, and almost completely blinded by perspex and blood, he safely executed a wheels down landing on the aerodrome. He then taxied his aircraft clear of the runway to enable the remainder of the formation to land. He was lifted from his aircraft and taken to the Wing Hospital for emergency treatment. This young officer, instead of parachuting to safety and losing his aircraft, demonstrated extreme courage and devotion to duty in flying his aircraft back to base to carry out a safe landing while suffering extensive pain and being almost totally blind.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCAMERON, Flight Sergeant Keith MacKenzie (17424) – Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Services in the Air – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 9 April 1960 and AFRO 194/60 dated 29 April 1960. Born in Vancouver; enlisted 1948 as aircraft controller. Served in Canada and with No.2 (F) Wing; since 1957 had been at Portage la Prairie on GCA control duties.\n\nFlight Sergeant Cameron was a passenger in a T-33 jet aircraft carrying out a cross-country flight at 37,000 feet on 11 October 1959. The eyesight of the pilot became very seriously impaired and Flight Sergeant Cameron, a ground controlled approach controller with limited civilian flying experience, took over the control of the aircraft for approximately fifteen minutes during which time he “homed” on a radio beacon, descended through cloud, performed aircraft circles, worked the radio and expressed a willingness to land the aircraft. By this time the pilot had regained his eyesight sufficiently to land but Flight Sergeant Cameron provided considerable aid during the approach and landing operation. His resourcefulness and skill saved a valuable aircraft and possibly prevented loss of life.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCAMPBELL, Flight Lieutenant Daniel Michael (30048) – Air Force Cross – No.121 Composite Unit, Comox, B.C. Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 30 July 1966 and AFRO dated 29 July 1966 for rescue of survivors of air crash, 18 July 1965. This award is thoroughly documented in Secretary of State papers (RG.6 D.1 Volume 359, file 114-2-A1-3 “Awards – Specific – Air Force Cross (Granted)” – Based on affidavit sworn 21 December 1965 by F/L R.A. Cumming, Medical Officer, Station Comox, who had accompanied Campbell, taking off from Comox at about 7.00 p.m. He was the man on the cable when it was found to be too short; Campbell had him on the ground by 9.30 p.m. Wreck site relocated by waving a small hand-held flashlight. Sergeant A.F. Savage was lowered to assist, and Campbell then departed for refuelling, returning at 1.00 a.m. Three lifts made; it was so dangerous that Sergeant Savage was left for a daylight retrieval.\n\nAnother affidavit filed by Sergeant Savage on 22 December 1965 states that helicopter crew consisted of F/L Campbell, F/L Neil, Corporal Herr (Flight Technician), F/L Cummings (MO) and Sergeant Stevens, as well as LAC Fletcher (duty photographer). Flew to Tofino, met an ASR Albatross and picked up one of the “walk out” survivors to guide them. A para-rescue team had been dropped earlier, apparently at wrong site. The Albatross, reconnoitring 2-3 miles north, directed them to and object hanging in the trees; by aircraft searchlights they spotted wreckage in trees and a man waving a white shirt. After lowering the MO, chopper flew to jump site and picked up Corporal Scobey who as winch operator got Savage down on ground. Savage reported the helicopter had been sent away for an hour while MO treated injured and Savage prepared stretcher and landing site – unable to cut the huge trees but trimmed some wood and branches that might hinder or catch stretchers.\n\nRecommendation (citation below) sent by letter of Air Commodore G.F. Jacobsen to Mr.J.Miquelon (Chairman, Decorations Committee, Secretary of State), 14 March 1966. On 24 May 1966 he writes that the Decorations Committee had met on 11 May 1966 and concurred in awards for Campbell and Harvey.\n\nCampbell, as a Major in the Canadian Armed Forces, was later made a Member of the Order of Military Merit (Canada Gazette dated 22 December 1973 – the only AFC recipient so honoured).\n\nOn 18 July 1965, Flight Lieutenant Campbell was the captain of Labrador Helicopter 10402, despatched to search for and pick up survivors of an aircraft which had crashed near Bramfield on Vancouver Island. Two survivors of the crash had “walked out” but because of conflicting descriptions, the exact location f the crash scene could not be determined by the searching aircraft. It was learned, however, that the aircraft had crashed into tall timber on a steep mountainside and that two other survivors who were injured, possibly seriously, were left at the crash scene. Just at sundown, the tail section of the aircraft was spotted lodged in the top of tall timber. Despite the increasing darkness, Flight Lieutenant Campbell manoeuvred his aircraft into position for lowering a rescue team. When the first man was lowered it was found that at the full extent of the hoist cable he was some 20 feet from the ground, due to the height of the timber, the gradient of the mountain slope and the limited length of the hoist cable. It was then necessary for Flight Lieutenant Campbell, if he were to effect a rescue, to nestle the helicopter fuselage in the tree tops. With extraordinary skill, he nestled the helicopter fuselage into the tree tops, successfully lowering the rescue team and their equipment. To ensure a safe fuel supply and the success of the rescue operation, Flight Lieutenant Campbell then returned to base and although now midnight returned to the crash scene determined to complete the rescue. Again he nestled the helicopter fuselage in the tree tops and safely hoisted the survivors and rescue team to safety. Had Flight Lieutenant Campbell not completed the rescue that night, rain and fog later closed the area to search aircraft until 21 July, 1965, it is doubtful if one of the injured survivors could have survived another night of exposure as, besides suffering burns to the upper part of his body a lacerated knee and a possible back injury, he was also in a state of shock. During the entire rescue mission Flight Lieutenant Campbell faced grave personal danger when nestling the fuselage in the trees, as any sudden change of wind could easily have caused the helicopter to crash causing undetermined injury or death to himself and others. This officer’s calm professional approach, exceptionally fine airmanship, courage and devotion to duty in an extremely critical situation were major factors in saving human lives.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCAREW, Flight Lieutenant Robert Dean (33697) – Air Medal (United States) – 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing (USAF) – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 26 June 1954 and AFRO 362/54 dated 2 July 1954. Medal presented by U.S. Consul in Quebec City, 5 August 1954. Born 21 August 1924; enlisted in RCAF, 31 August 1942; awarded wings, October 1943. Trained on Hurricanes in Canada and flew an overseas tour with Nos.66 and 412 Squadrons; served in Air Forces of Occupation for seven months. Demobilized 19 February 19946; rejoined RCAF 5 November 1950 and trained on Vampires; then became No.1 OTU instructor. As of 22 January 1953 he was reported to have 1,165 hours on single engine aircraft including 129 on Vampires, 201 on T-33s and 25 on Sabres. Taken on strength of Special Force (Korea), 14 February 1953; taken on strength of 335th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, 18 February 1953; struck off strength 335th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, 5 July 1953; struck off strength Special Force (Korea), 5 July 1953. In Korea he flew 72 combat hours plus 18 hours 15 minutes non-combat on F-86 and five hours 55 minutes non-combat on T-33; once forced to bale out over sea after gliding 130 miles, 43,00 feet to 7,000 feet. Retired 20 November 1970. See PL-98811 for photograph. See H.A. Halliday, “In Korean Skies”, Roundel, December 1963 and January 1964.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Robert D. Carew distinguished himself by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight as pilot of an F-86 type aircraft, 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force, from 5 April 1953 to 8 May 1953. During that period, Flight Lieutenant Carew demonstrated outstanding professional ability during sustained combat air operations over North Korea. Despite adverse weather conditions, hazardous terrain and numerically superior enemy fighter aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Carew accomplished numerous missions which contributed substantially to the success of United Nations operations. Through his keen flying ability, courage and exemplary devotion to duty. Flight Lieutenant Carew reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCARSWELL, Flight Lieutenant Andrew Gordon (17834) – Air Force Cross – No.123 Search and Rescue Unit – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 15 March 1958 and AFRO 84/58 (same date). See Roundel, Vol.X (1958), Number 3, page 21.\n\nOn 28 June 1956, Flight Lieutenant Carswell took off in a Canso aircraft in an attempt to rescue two fishermen from a sinking vessel near Galiano Island in the Straits of Georgia. Despite strong winds and extremely rough waters, Flight Lieutenant Carswell made a successful landing. Flight Lieutenant Carswell then manoeuvred the aircraft into a position where the two fishermen could be rescued. The takeoff in the rough seas was a particularly hazardous one demanding of the highest skill as the aircraft had been severely damaged by the heavy seas during the landing and was shipping water faster than could be handled by the pumps. He then flew with the survivors to Sea Island without further incident.\n\nOn another occasion on 6 September 1956, Flight Lieutenant Carswell under difficult conditions successfully landed a Canso aircraft at sea some 600 miles off the West Coast of Vancouver Island in an attempt to remove a critically ill member of the weather ship St.Catharines. With considerable difficulty the seaman was transferred to the aircraft and with jet assisted takeoff the aircraft became airborne and returned to Victoria where the seaman was transferred to hospital. It was the belief of authoritative medical personnel that had not the patient been evacuated by air, he would not have survived the long sea voyage to Victoria. Flight Lieutenant Carswell’s courage, devotion to duty, and skill have served as an inspiration and fine example to fellow aircrew. He is highly recommended as being most worthy of the Air Force Cross.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCASS, Flight Lieutenant Raymond William (14930) – Air Force Cross – No.103 Rescue Unit, Greenwood – awarded as per Canada Gazette and AFRO 37/64, both dated 5 September 1964. This award is thoroughly documented in Secretary of State papers (RG.6 D.1 Volume 359, file 114-2-A1-3 “Awards – Specific – Air Force Cross (Granted)” On 3 June 1964 recommendation sent by Rear Admiral M.G. Stirling (Chairman, Personnel Members Committee) to Mr.J.Miquelon (Chairman, Decorations Committee, Secretary of State); he in turn writes (18 June 1964) that the Decorations Committee, meeting on 17 June, had approved honours for Cass and Blank (also for Brigadier J.A. Dextraze, Lieutenant-Colonel P.A.Mayer, and Sergeant J.A.L. Lessard). Recommendation had been submitted 9 March 1964 by S/L R.H. Ranzen (CO) and concurred in by G/C R.A. Gordon (Station Commander) who wrote, “A peerless demonstration of professional flying skill of the highest order”. Based on affidavit sworn 11 March 1964 by F/L Joseph Julien Donat Mathon, radio officer on Albatross 9308 (co-pilot was F/L Chute). Cass and Chute simultaneously spotted Mr.Muise of Port Hood, Nova Scotia. RCC advised but they told aircraft to return to base (deteriorating weather); icebreaker would arrive in six hours. But Cass, circling, concluded the ice floe was breaking up and to drop emergency kit would serve no useful purpose. He then made twelve low passes and polled the crew before landing. After rescue, Muise said that “the ice was breaking up fast and even the seals were leaving; if I had been there for one hour more I would have been a goner.”\n\nAffidavit also sworn by F/L Dwight Whitford Rhodes, navigator. Aircraft left Greenwood at 0930 hours and spotted Muise at 100 hours. Praised the polling idea – “His deliberate manner and this obvious consideration for the safety of those with him did much to instil a sense of confidence in his crew which unanimously agreed with his decision.” At Moncton he noted that Muise was wearing RCAF flight boots given him by LAC C.L.Lavender (those of Muise damaged beyond repair); Another crewman, LAC Macdougall, gave Muise $ 5.00 because the man was broke when rescued.\n\nAdded information: rescue was at 46-01 north, 61-41 west at 11.00 a.m.local time. Charlottetown reported ceiling was 1,000 to 1,500 feet, visibility four miles in light snow showers, winds easterly at 16 mph. Sydney gave ceiling as 200-400 feet, visibility one miles in light snow (ice pellets).\n\nOn the morning of 20 February 1964, Flight Lieutenant Cass was the captain of an Albatross aircraft assigned on a search and rescue mission to locate a missing seal hunter, Albert Muise, in the Gulf of St.Lawrence. After a search in constantly deteriorating weather conditions, the hunter was found stranded on a small ice pan which was breaking up in the floe ice on the edge of an open lead of water. Determining that no other means of rescue could arrive in time to save Mr.Muise’s life, and that dropping of survival equipment was inadvisable, Flight Lieutenant Cass decided to land his aircraft in the narrow open water lead and effect the rescue by using a small rubber boat aboard the aircraft. Appreciating the dangers in landing in floe ice conditions, Flight Lieutenant Cass coolly and deliberately made at least twelve inspection runs to select the safest landing path. He informed his crew fully respecting his decision to land, sought their advice and, in his composed manner and genuine concern with the safety of all aboard, demonstrated leadership of a high order which engendered the unstinting, unanimous support of his whole crew. He landed the aircraft and subsequently manoeuvred it during the actual rescue with great skill and precision. After the rescue of Mr.Muise was accomplished, in shifting winds and waves as high as four feet with a heavy chop, Flight Lieutenant Cass took the aircraft off expertly and returned to base. This officer’s calm, professional approach, exceptionally fine airmanship and devotion to duty in an extremely critical situation were major factors in saving a man’s life.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCOLE, Leading Aircraftman Robert George (236706) – British Empire Medal – No.2 (Fighter) Wing – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 27 July 1963 and AFRO 31/63 dated 2 August 1963. Home in Vancouver. Awarded Queen’s Commendation for Brave Conduct were Corporal Charles H.R. Nelson (Lethbridge) and Leading Aircraftman Ralph Wayne McLaughlin (Moncton).\n\nOn the night of 27 April, 1962, a fire occurred in a third floor apartment of the RCAF married quarters located at St. Avold, eleven miles from 2 Fighter Wing, Grostenquin, France, in which a boy of twelve and three infants, aged two years and below, were sleeping. The youngest infant perished in the fire. Leading aircraftman Cole, who lived in a neighbouring building, saw the fire and proceeded to the apartment with an extinguisher to render assistance. On his arrival, the fire, which was seated in the master bedroom, was well rooted, and the apartment was in complete darkness, smoke-filled and very hot. Although there were other persons at the scene, Leading Aircraftman Cole was the first person to enter the apartment, which he did without hesitation and with complete disregard for his own personal safety. In spite of his being untrained and unequipped for such activity, he searched in locating three children whom he passed for evacuation to two other airmen who had followed him into the apartment. Following this, he tried to extinguish the fire in the master bedroom where, unknown to him, the youngest child was present, but found this was not possible with the limited means at his disposal. Leading aircraftman Cole then assisted another airman to evacuate eight persons who considered themselves trapped on the fourth floor. Throughout this emergency, leading aircraftman Cole conducted himself courageously, showing outstanding initiative, judgement and coolness. There is no doubt that his prompt action saved three children from death by asphyxiation.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCOSTELLO, Air Commodore Martin, CBE (112) – United States Legion of Merit (Degree of Officer) – awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 12 March 1949 and AFRO 102/49 dated 11 March 1949; for services in organizing and directing air searches during Operation “Attache”. Stationed at Winnipeg; no citation found in biographical file. Born in Alexandria, Ontario, 1904; taken on RCAF as Gentleman Cadet, RMC, 1925; awarded wings, 31 August 1927. RCAF Pilot Officer, 4 September 1928, on graduation from RMC. Served at Vancouver, Winnipeg, Trenton before the war; duties included aerial photography, forestry patrols, and RCAF patrols out of Vancouver, 1932; attended RAF Staff College, 1938. Early in war he served in Eastern Air Command; overseas in 1943, he worked largely in Coastal Command and commanded a station. Returned to Canada, 18 April 1945 to become Assistant Chief of Air Staff. Remained in postwar RCAF; awarded Queen’s Coronation Medal (23 October 1953, while at Canadian Joint Staff London). For more on “Attache” see entries in this file under LEIGH, LEMIEUX and VIRR.\n\nFor exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the government of the United States as Commanding Officer of 11 Group, Royal Canadian Air Force, during the search for and rescue of personnel lost in the wilds of Saskatchewan in a United States Navy Beechcraft on September 12, 1948. A skilful airman and excellent leader, Air Commodore Costello effectively supervised the search involving 35 Canadian and United States aircraft for a period of twelve days in the wilds of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, thereby contributing greatly to the successful termination of the greatest and one of the most difficult searches ever conducted in Canada and to the saving of the lives of fur United States and one British personnel. His initiative, exceptional ability and sound judgement reflect the highest credit on Air Commodore Costello and the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCOUTURIER, Sergeant Joseph (26732) – Soldier’s Medal (United States) – No.103 Rescue Unit – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 20 February 1954 and AFRO 102/54 dated 26 February 1954. Born 12 August 1920 in Edmundston, New Brunswick.

Trade reclassified as SEW and SE Tech, 13 December 1947, SS Tech, 1 October 1966. Died 17 June 1996 in Auburn, Kings County, Nova Scotia. A copy of the USAF letter on Trent’s file is also on his; in addition, there is a letter dated 2 March 1954 from Air Marshal C.R. Slemon, congratulating him on the award and saying:\n\nThe heroic manner in which you unhesitatingly accepted the personal risk and parachuted to the scene of the crash, despite adverse weather conditions and approaching darkness, and with the full knowledge that the jump from such a low altitude would preclude the use of your secondary parachute should your primary parachute fail to function, was in keeping with the best tradition of the Royal Canadian Air Force and is indeed worthy of praise.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCUTHBERTSON, Flight Lieutenant Donald Reginald (19678) – Air Force Cross – Station Goose Bay – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 11 April 1953 and AFRO 217/53 dated 17 April 1953. Born 25 September 1918 at Bright, Ontario. Enlisted in Toronto, 20 May 1941. Trained at No.5 ITS, No.3 EFTS and No.14 SFTS. Attended CFS, Trenton, 30 March to 19 May 1942; instructed at No.8 SFTS, Moncton, 20 May 1942 to 24 January 1943. To UK, 9 March 1943. Further trained at Nos. 9 and 5 (P) AFU; served in No.416 Squadron, 8 August 1943 to 12 December 1944; credited with one FW.190 damaged near Caen (28 June 1944), one FW.190 destroyed, Lissieux (17 August 1944), one FW.190 destroyed, Emmerich (27 September 1944); instructed at No.19 OTU, 12 December 1944 to 24 April 1945. Returned to Canada, 14 May 1945. For second incident LAC John W. Malo awarded Queen’s Commendation for Brave Conduct. Invested with AFC at Buckingham Palace, May 1954. FURTHER NOTE: as co-pilot to G/C L.J.Birchall he departed Goose Bay, 23 August 1950 to evacuate a woman suffering from acute appendicitis from Hopedale Moravian Mission; LAC C.D. McLaughlin was crewman. He was pilot on a second flight to same place, 5 September 1950, evacuating a boy with a fractured arm plus a second patient from Port Harrison. Yet another flight in a Norseman with McLaughlin on 28 September 1950, to evacuate a sick Eskimo from Nutuk, 300 miles north of Goose Bay. On return flight it was hard due to low clouds over hill; unable to maintain sight of ground, he flew two hours above overcast; approaching Goose Bay Radio Range, he was able to proceed to Northwest River Grenfell Missions.\n\nIn the early morning of 28 September, 1951, a request was received at Goose Bay from Hopedale on the Labrador coast for the evacuation of a seriously injured civilian. Despite forecasted extreme adverse weather conditions, Flight Lieutenant Cuthbertson and a crewman took off in a Norseman aircraft equipped with floats to evacuate the patient. Weather conditions as forecasted were encountered and on arrival at Hopedale, strong east winds buffeting the coast were causing swells and waves up to five feet high. Notwithstanding these hazardous conditions, a successful landing was completed and the seriously injured civilian emplaned. Immediately prior to commencing the return flight, word was received that the young son of a missionary at Makkovik, some sixty miles southeast of Hopedale, was in critical condition as a result of having been mauled by husky dogs and air transportation to the nearest hospital urgently requested. Without thought of personal danger, the crew took off for Makkovik, with the full realization that landing conditions would again be extremely hazardous. A landing at Makkovik was completed without mishap, but, just as the critically injured youngster was placed on board the aircraft, a heavy bank of fog rolled into Makkovik, necessitating a takeoff being carried out with a ceiling of only one hundred feet. The return flight to Goose Bay was carried out in below freezing temperature and although twice encountering engine trouble due to carburettor icing, Flight Lieutenant Cuthbertson by superb airmanship kept the aircraft airborne on course. Arriving at Goose Bay amidst heavy thunder showers, an indefinite ceiling of three hundred feet and visibility varying from one quarter to one half mile, Flight Lieutenant Cuthbertson, despite heavy static, executed a masterful let-down into Goose Bay harbour using a let-down procedure worked out by himself for such an emergency. Four days later, a request was received at Goose Bay from Saglek Bay, some three hundred and seventy-five miles up the bleak Labrador coast, for the evacuation of a civilian who was in critical condition due to frost bitten and gangrenous feet. Despite the fact a strong northeast wind was blowing, causing a five hundred foot ceiling at Saglek Bay and clouds close to ground level for most of the route, Flight Lieutenant Cuthbertson and a crewman took off in a float-equipped Norseman aircraft to effect the evacuation. Although on arrival, heavy swells were rolling into Saglek Bay and waves from four to six feet high were breaking over the mooring buoy, a successful let-down was completed and with a great deal of difficulty the aircraft was secured. As the patient was being loaded on the aircraft, it was discovered that the right float had sprung and was leaking badly. An immediate take-off was made under the same hazardous conditions. After seven hours and thirty minutes of rough instrument flying and a landing and take-off in practically impossible conditions, the weary crew and patient arrived safely at Goose Bay. Throughout many hours of search and rescue flying, involving flights into remote sections of Canada’s Arctic and North Atlantic regions, Flight Lieutenant Cuthbertson has displayed superb airmanship, disregard for personal safety and outstanding devotion to duty.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDALTON, Flight Lieutenant John Terrance (27144) – Queen’s Commendation for Brave Conduct – Station Summerside – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 27 December 1952 and AFRO 1/53 dated 2 January 1953. Born in Newcastle, New Brunswick, 8 February 1922; enlisted in Saint John, New Brunswick, 11 December 1943; released 20 September 1945; re-engaged in Halifax, 28 November 1946. Gained Flight Engineer Badge, 4 October 1944 (served overseas as No.76 Base and No.1659 Conversion Unit); gained Radio Officer’s Badge, 8 May 1948. Incident occurred at Station Summerside, 25 April 1952. Lancaster attempting to land crashed, killing four and injuring nine others.\n\nThis officer displayed courage of a high order on the occasion of a Lancaster aircraft accident at RCAF Station Summerside, Prince Edward Island, on 25 April 1952. Arriving at the scene of the crash within moments after its actual occurrence, he was informed that although several of the occupants had already been removed from the wreckage, some members of the crew were trapped in the blazing forward compartment of the aircraft. Immediately donning an asbestos rescue suit which he obtained from the nearby crash tender, he entered the fuselage through the rear of the aircraft, where the tail assembly had been severed on impact. Despite the intense heat, exploding oxygen bottles and distorted wreckage, he managed to make his way forward as far as the bomb bat rise. However, due to the smoke and hot air entering the asbestos suit, he experienced difficulty in breathing and was forced to abandon his attempts to reach the trapped crewmen, Although unsuccessful in his efforts to rescue the ill-fated crew members, Flight Lieutenant Dalton’s gallant and heroic actions under the circumstances are worthy of high praise.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDAVIDSON, Wing Commander Robert Tremayne Pilsbury, DFC (20465) – Air Medal (United States) – 335th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (USAF) – Awarded as per AFRO 742/53 dated 11 December 1953 and Canada Gazette dated 14 November 1953. Born in Vancouver, 10 February 1917. Enlisted in RAF, 1937. Served with No.30 Squadron (Blenheims), 1940-1942; No.261 Squadron (Hurricanes), 1942; No.175 Squadron (Typhoons), 1943; commanded successive Typhoon wings including No.143 Wing. Shot down in May 1944, evaded and joined Maquis. Transferred to RCAF, 12 December 1944. Of his Korea tour he remarked, “Got in a few good scraps with the MIGs. I made a couple of them smoke.” Died 1975. See H.A. Halliday, “In Korean Skies”, Roundel, December 1963 and January 1964.\n\nWing Commander Robert T.P. Davidson distinguished himself by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial combat as a pilot of an F-86 type aircraft, 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force, flying missions against enemies of the United Nations from 29 September to 25 October 1952. While flying combat air patrols and various other type missions deep into enemy territory, many times against a superior number of enemy aircraft, his dedication to duty and demonstrated skill were a magnificent contribution to the successful completion of the assigned mission. As a result of his fortitude and courage on these occasions he has brought credit to himself, members of the United Nations Forces, the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the Far East Air Forces.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDICKSON, Squadron Leader James Donald, DFC, DFM (19812) – Air Force Cross – No.426 Squadron – Awarded as per AFRO 406/52 dated 13 June 1952, London Gazette dated 5 June 1952 and Canada Gazette dated 7 June 1952. Born in Rothesay, New Brunswick, October 29th, 1920; enlisted in Moncton, October 23rd, 1940. Trained at No.2 ITS (graduated February 4th, 1941), No.14 EFTS (graduated April 19th, 1941) and No.33 SFTS (graduated July 2nd, 1941). Awarded DFM, June 16th, 1942 for services with No.57 Squadron; awarded DFC, September 1st, 1943 for services with No.419 Squadron. With No.164 (Transport) Squadron, January to November 1945; flew in Exercise “Muskox” with No.1 ASU. Served in No.426 Squadron, March 1947 to May 1951; joined No.412 Squadron, September 1952. Secretary of State papers (RG.6 D.1 Volume 359, file 114-2-A1-3 “Awards – Specific – Air Force Cross (Granted)” has citation. Presented by Governor General at Government House, 12 June 1953. Died 26 July 1953; buried North Luffenham.\n\nSquadron Leader Dickson has served with No.426 Transport Squadron on the Korean Airlift as captain of a North Star aircraft since its inception. He has flown a total of 600 hours over the 11,000 nautical mile route, often through hazardous icing and fog conditions, without mishap. This is a direct reflection on his exceptional ability, resourcefulness and leadership. This officer was recently appointed second-in-command of the squadron, and is now directly responsible for all RCAF operations over the Pacific. His sterling qualities and abilities as a pilot were demonstrated forcibly on a flight from McChord Air Force Base, Washington, to Elmsdorf Air Force Base, Alaska on the 23rd November 1950. As on all trips the aircraft was loaded with troops and vital supplies for the United Nations’ effort in Korea. After completing two hours of the eight hour flight the aircraft encountered most severe icing conditions and head winds. In spite of the weather, Squadron Leader Dickson completed his flight, landing at his destination in a 74-knot gale. All other aircraft flying the route that encountered the same conditions, with the exception of another RCAF aircraft, aborted and returned to their points of departure. Had it not been for the superior skill and determination shown by this officer, a vital load would have been delayed. Squadron Leader Dickson’s qualities of leadership are an inspiring example to the officers and airmen under his command, and his untiring efforts have been an outstanding contribution to the success of the Royal Canadian Air Force’s participation in this operation.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDRACKLEY, Flight Sergeant Alfred Arthur (21603) – Air Force Medal -No.426 Squadron – Awarded as per London Gazette dated 5 June 1952, Canada Gazette dated 7 June 1952 and AFRO 406/52 dated 13 June 1952. Born 5 November 1916 to farm family, Birsay, Saskatchewan; educated to Grade X at Hanford District School; from January to June 1940 took aeronautical courses at Saskatoon Technical School. Enlisted in RCAF, 26 June 1940. Attended Manning Depot in Toronto and Technical Training School, St.Thomas, Ontario (graduated March 1941). Served at Station Dartmouth (Nos.5 and 11 Squadrons) servicing Hudson, Stranraer and Canso aircraft; participated in three-month photo mapping operation in Labrador using Stranraers. To Station Yarmouth, Acting Corporal rank, 1942. Remustered to Flight Engineer, and took Air Gunnery training at Mont Joli (November 1942-January 1943). Attended Aero Engine School, Montreal and a maritime OTU at Patricia Bay (February-March 1943). Returned to east coast and No.116 (BR) Squadron. Commissioned May 1944; to No.162 (BR) Squadron, Iceland, July 1944. Throughout the war he flew on 116 sorties (1,311 operational hours); awarded Operational Wing, 18 January 1945, Bar to Operational Wing, 14 August 1945. Remained in postwar RCAF, reverting to Sergeant. Served briefly in No.103 Search and Rescue Unit. With No.426 Squadron, June 1948 to July 1952. AFM presented 27 February 1953 by AOC Air Defence Command, Air Vice-Marshal A.L. James. After No.426 Squadron he went to No.427 Squadron (St.Hubert and No.3 Wing in Europe). Joined No.11 Technical Service Unit, Montreal; promoted to Warrant Officer (2nd Class), 1957. In 1964 posted to No.115 ATU, El Arish, for one year. Final tour was with Air Material Command Headquarters, Ottawa. Retired 6 May 1967 and moved to Victoria.\n\nFlight Sergeant Drackley has served on the Korean Airlift since its inception as a Flight Engineer on North Star aircraft, having been attached to the Military Air Transport Service, USAF, on 26th July 1950. He has flown a total of over 400 hours on the Pacific.\n\nOn many occasions hazardous weather conditions have been encountered and it was necessary to do instrument let downs or land with the aid of GCA at the destination. Flight Sergeant Drackley’s experience, efficiency and co-operation with the captain of his aircraft during these emergencies were in a large part responsible for the success of the operation.\n\nIn the performance of his duties Flight Sergeant Drackley has set an example for all airmen by his devotion and loyalty to duty. This non-commissioned officer through his trade proficiency and advice has been instrumental in maintaining a tight route schedule which resulted in a high aircraft utilization and thus increased the squadron’s ability to carry vital personnel and material over the 11,000 mile Pacific route.\n\nThis non-commissioned officer’s untiring efforts have been a direct contribution to the success of the RCAF phase of this operation.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nDRAKE, Flight Lieutenant John Francis (20343) – Air Force Cross – No.413 (Photo Survey) Squadron – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 31 July 1948 and AFRO 463/48 dated 30 July 1948. Born in Bender, Saskatchewan, 18 January 1921. Worked for Victoria Times before enlisting in Vancouver, 30 July 1941. Cited with Flying Officer J.E.Goldsmith, DFC.\n\nDuring a period of over two months in the late summer and early autumn of 1947 a detachment of RCAF personnel was detailed to make magnetic observations at numerous points in the area of the North Magnetic Pole. This exploratory mission, operating under the code name “POLCO” was conducted from a Canso aircraft of No.413 Photographic Squadron under the command of Flight Lieutenant Drake, the pilot, with a crew consisting of a navigator, co-pilot, wireless operator, flight engineer, electrician, instrument mechanic, and airframe mechanic, accompanied by six Dominion Government civilian observers who acted in the capacity of geophysicists, geologists and geographer and botanist. The organization and direction of this magnetic survey operation required great ingenuity and daring, for it was the first time in Canadian aviation history that a flying boat had been flown and based for an extended period amongst the treacherous and barren islands surrounding the North Magnetic Pole. Flight Lieutenant Drake was responsible for taking off and landing his aircraft at numerous hazardous points in the Polar area for the purpose of making scientific observations. In spite of fog, icing conditions, uncharted terrain and unknown currents he pressed the operation with such skill, resourcefulness and courage that it was possible to reposition the Magnetic Pole with greater accuracy than hitherto known. On several occasions he displayed a complete disregard for personal safety in order to save his aircraft from destruction by gale and ice. Without the magnificent leadership and judgement displayed by Flight Lieutenant Drake the operation might easily have ended disastrously. The navigator, Flying Officer Goldsmith, was responsible for successfully guiding the aircraft through dangerous and uncharted areas in the Arctic Islands. In order to reach observation points surrounding the Magnetic Pole it was frequently necessary to fly above the overcast for many hours. With the minimum of normal meteorological and navigational aids, and in unreliable compass reading areas, this officer invariably directed the aircraft to its destination, often necessitating a let-down through clouds in the vicinity of high hills or dangerous waters. He did not have the assistance of accurate maps and his own sketches of important areas have been accepted for incorporation into official Dominion Government charts. The outstanding manner in which he adapted himself to the difficult methods of navigation required over the pole is worthy of the highest praise. The successful completion of this pioneering operation was directly attributable to the resolution, direction, integrity and initiative of these two officers, and their skilfullness and courage has set a fulgent example which will be an inspiration to their comrades in the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\n* * * * *\n\nEDWARDS, Flight Lieutenant Robert Martin (30018) – Air Force Cross – No.426 Squadron – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 3 January 1953 and AFRO 10/53 dated 9 January 1953. Born in Winnipeg; (another press release says Lucky Lake, Saskatchewan, 1922); in Air Cadets before enlistment and also flew with Winnipeg Flying Club. Enlisted 1947, began flying training in January 1948 and graduated at the top of his class. Attended an Air Armament course, Trenton, before posting to No.426 Squadron. Press Release 7779 (December 1950) stated he had done training flights to Europe, Arctic re-supply, work on “Sweetbriar” and relief flights during “Redramp”.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Edwards, a post war pilot graduate of the Royal Canadian Air Force, has served with 426 Transport Squadron on the Korean Airlift since its inception. In his capacity as captain and pilot of North Star aircraft he has in support of the United Nations operations in Korea participated in twenty-six round trips to the Far East over the eleven thousand nautical mile route. Throughout these flight, which have on many occasions necessitated flying through some of the most adverse weather conditions in the world, he has carried out his allotted tasks in an exemplary manner. The high sense of duty which he has exhibited and his exceptional ability and resourcefulness as a pilot have contributed immeasurably to the successful achievements of 426 Transport Squadron.\n\n* * * * *\n\nENDERSBE, Squadron Leader Charles Edward (23526) – Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Services in the Air – No.426 Squadron – Award effective 5 June 1952 as per Canada Gazette dated 7 June 1952 and AFRO 406/52 dated 13 June 1952. Wartime experience in the Aleutians. On strength of No.1 Air Radar Observer School, Clinton when award announced.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Endersbe served on the Korean Airlift at its inception as radio leader of 426 Transport Squadron which was attached to the Military Air Transport Service, USAF, on 26th July 1950. He had had previous World War II experience throughout the Aleutians which proved invaluable in setting up the airlift to Japan As a radio officer he logged approximately 700 flying hours over the great circle route through the Aleutian chain to Japan on trips carrying troops and vital supplies for the United Nations effort in Korea.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Endersbe displayed outstanding professional ability which he used with imagination and initiative to ensure expeditious handling of all flights in the face of extremely difficult weather conditions. His qualities of leadership were an inspiring example to the officers and airmen under his command and his untiring efforts were an outstanding contribution to the success of the Royal Canadian Air Force participation in this operation.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nENGELBERT, Flight Sergeant (now WO2 Arthur Leroy, CD (2414) – British Empire Medal – No.426 Squadron – Awarded as per AFRO 406/52 dated 13 June 1952 and London Gazette dated 5 June 1952 with Queen’s Birthday List); born in Edmonton; raised in Manitou, Manitoba; serving at No.4 OTU at the time of gazetting.\n\nFlight Sergeant Engelbert served on the Korean Airlift since its inception as a non-commissioned officer in charge of a crew on major maintenance, having been attached to Military Air Transport Service, USAF, on 26 July 1950. During his tour he also served as a detachment commander in Hawaii, being responsible for the turn around of 426 Squadron’s aircraft and thus was instrumental in maintaining the squadron’s airlift capacity of vital supplies for Korea.\n\nHis qualities of leadership, resourcefulness and exceptional ability were demonstrated forcibly in November 1950 at Shemya in the Aleutian Chain. This non-commissioned officer was responsible for retrieving a North Star aircraft which had rolled into a ravine due to brake failure. The aircraft stopped with its nose against the far embankment and with its tail on the tarmac from where it had rolled. The successful execution of this salvage operation enabled the aircraft to continue to its destination in Japan with a load of troops and vital supplies. Had it not been for the outstanding skill and determination shown by Flight Sergeant Engelbert a valuable aircraft might have been lost and an essential load delayed.\n\nFlight Sergeant Engelbert’s untiring efforts have been a direct contribution to the success of the RCAF phase of this operation.\n\n* * * * *\n\nEVANS, Flight Lieutenant Frederick William, DFC (10062) – Air Medal (United States) – 334th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (USAF) – Awarded as per AFRO 742/53 dated 11 December 1953 and Canada Gazette dated 14 November 1953. Born in Saint John, New Brunswick, 1919; home in St.Thomas (clerk and salesman). Enlisted in Saint John, 17 February 1939. Trained at No.1 ITS (graduated 2 April 1943), No.7 EFTS (graduated 28 May 1943) and No.14 SFTS (graduated 1 October 1943). Commissioned July 1943. Overseas he destroyed one FW.190 and shared in the destruction of another. Postwar Vampire aerobatic pilot. See photo PL-90156. Taken on strength, Special Force, 14 December 1952; taken on strength of 334th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, 24 December 1952; struck off strength, 334th FIS, 9 April 1953; struck off strength Special Force, 11 April 1953. Flew 75 hours five minutes in combat; claimed one locomotive and four rail cars destroyed. For further details see Second World War RCAF awards data base. See H.A. Halliday, “In Korean Skies”, Roundel, December 1963 and January 1964.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Evans distinguished himself by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight as a pilot of an F-86 type aircraft, 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force, from 8 January 1953 to 13 February 1953. During that period, Lieutenant [sic] Evans successfully completed numerous combat missions in support of United Nations operations in Korea. Although often faced with determined enemy opposition, the courage, aggressiveness and degree of skill with which Flight Lieutenant Evans conducted his assignment contributed greatly to the ultimate success of the assigned missions. Through his courage, professional ability and exemplary devotion to duty, Flight Lieutenant Evans reflected great credit upon himself, the Far East Air Forces, and the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\n* * * * *\n\nEVANS, Flight Lieutenant Terence Jesse (20215) – King’s Commendation for Valuable Services in the Air – Central Experimental and Proving Establishment – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 7 July 1951 and AFRO 395/51 dated 6 July 1951. Born in Sale, Cheshire, England; home in Toronto; light-heavyweight wrestler at 1936 Olympics and at Empire Games of 1938 (Australia). Enlisted there 4 September 1940. Commended in 1945 for instructional work with No.1 Central Flying School. Remained in postwar RCAF; much service with Central Experimental and Proving Establishment from 1950 onwards Awarded Queens Coronation Medal, 4 November 1953, while serving as a Wing Commander Air Attache to Moscow. See Press Release 7904 dated 6 July 1951 which described the incident more fully. He had never flown a Sabre before, although he had been briefed by Canadair ground personnel and the company test pilot. Unknown to Evans, an adjustment had been made to the flap selection lever which caused both ailerons to jam after take off. Unable to fully control lateral movement, he had the choice of baling out or attempting a delicate and dangerous landing; he accomplished the latter.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Evans was carrying out an acceptance test on the first Canadair-produced F-86 aircraft when the flap selection lever jammed both ailerons. Flight Lieutenant Evans was faced with the choice of abandoning the aircraft or attempting a landing with a high performance aircraft which he had never flown before with no aileron control. He climbed the aircraft to a safe altitude and checked handling and stalling characteristics and speeds with wheels and flaps down. He then descended and successfully completed a landing with no further damage to the aircraft. His saving of the aircraft resulted in the disclosure of a technical maladjustment in the flap operation which later might have cost more aircraft and lives.\n\nNOTE: According to Directorate of History file 75/601, folio 13, Evans’ superior, W/C J.M. Frizzle, recommended an AFC and A/C A.D. Ross concurred. Two committees at National Defence Headquarters reviewed this and downgraded it to a King’s Commendation for Valuable Services in the Air. The reasoning behind the conclusion, expressed in memos dated March 19 and April 11, 1951, is far more interesting than the decision itself.\n\n(a) Every time a test pilot has occasion to test fly an aircraft, be it a prototype, having been completely overhauled, or modified by new design, there is an undoubted element of risk in his ordinary duties. This case, then, in effect, if approved, could create a precedent for this type of flying, and it might be extremely difficult to deny future recommended cases. Such a precedent could result in lowering the present high standard of the Air Force Cross.\n\n(b) Although not a necessary requirement, this case does not involve the saving of life or lives. This has been a strong factor in recommending previous cases for approval.\n\nWhether or not one agrees with these reasons, the first argument is the most compelling – as a test pilot it was Evans’ job to take calculated risks. The second point is a little more difficult to comprehend; one would assume that by sticking with the F-86 rather than abandoning it in the neighbourhood of Cartierville, he had ensured that no casualties would be sustained on the ground. The fault may have been with Frizzle, who did not mention this point. It is worth comparing his case with that of AFCs awarded to other fighter pilots in the 1950s and 1960s, notably F/L K.A. Harvey (see below).\n\nFURTHER NOTE: RCAF Press Release 7724 dated 11 September 1952 deals with visit of the Rockcliffe “Ice Wagon” (North Star aircraft modified to investigate aircraft icing) to the United Kingdom. Evans had flown it overseas on 9 August 1952; the visit was being extended another month to allow British personnel to become more familiar with RCAF and NRC work in this field.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFINKLESTEIN, Flight Lieutenant Abraham (6552) – Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Services in the Air – No.426 Squadron – Award effective 5 June 1952 as per Canada Gazette dated 7 June 1952 and AFRO 406/52 dated 13 June 1952.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Finklestein has served on the Korean Airlift since its inception as a navigator of North Star aircraft, being a member of No.426 Transport Squadron, which was attached to the Military Air Transport Service, USAF, on the 26th July 1950. He has navigated for more than 1,000 flying hours over the 11,000 nautical mile route, often through hazardous icing and fog conditions without mishap. This is a direct reflection on his exceptional professional ability and resourcefulness.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Finklestein invariable displayed initiative and determination far beyond the call of duty in ensuring the successful delivery of troops and vital supplies for the United Nations’ effort in Korea. This officer’s efforts have been a direct contribution to the success of the Royal Canadian Air Force’s phase of this operation.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFINNIGAN, Sergeant Leandre Joseph (17676) – Queen’s Commendation for Brave Conduct – Station Uplands – awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 29 June 1968.\n\nAt 0300 hours on 6 December 1967, a fire alarm was received from the Motor Transport Garage at the Base Fire Hall, Canadian Forces Base (then RCAF Station) Uplands, Ottawa, Ontario. On arrival at the scene, Duty Fire Crew Chief Sergeant L.J. Finnigan observed that an explosion had occurred and that a fire was burning below floor level in the equipment room. With creditable despatch he assumed control and proceeded to direct his crew in fighting the fire and other personnel in removing to safety the vehicles parked in the garage. During this operation, while attempts were being made to extinguish the stubborn fore, a second explosion occurred. The flying debris and flash from the explosion slightly injured four of his crew, demolished the remaining walls of the equipment room and also threw him some undetermined distance. The blows from flying building blocks received by Sergeant Finnigan at this time were severe enough to fracture his safety helmet with a force would undoubtedly have been lethal to an unprotected head. In spite of being shaken up, and while aware of the peculiar and unpredictable nature of a fire which resulted in multiple explosions, he remained at the scene, supervised the removal of injured personnel to hospital, and continued to control the operation. During this entire incident, but most apparently during the latter phases, Sergeant Finnigan displayed attention to duty and high regard for the safety of his personnel while knowingly risking further injury to himself with possible grave consequence.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFITZGERALD, Corporal Bernard James, CD (39301) – Queen’s Commendation for Brave Conduct – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 16 September 1967. Sergeant J.R.P. Lemieux given same award.\n\nOn 11th January 1967, Sergeant Lemieux and Corporal Fitzgerald were para-rescue members of a helicopter crew which had been despatched to rescue an unknown person who had been seen floating more than one mile from shore on what was described as a raft. As the helicopter came to a hover, the survivor was seen to lose his grip on the raft and slip under the water. Corporal Fitzgerald immediately jumped some fifteen feet into the water and swam towards the man. A struggle ensued and the survivor managed to secure such a strong grip on the Corporal that he could not put a life preserver on him nor break away. Sergeant Lemieux witnessed this from the hovering helicopter and immediately jumped into the water to render assistance. The two para-rescue members were finally able to attach a hoist-belt to the survivor. This proved a difficult feat for the airmen as the sea at the time was being whipped into fifteen foot waves by winds in excess of 35 knots. Once on board the aircraft, the airmen administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with external heart and limb massage, continuing this administration until the patient was under medical care in hospital.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFLEMING, F/O Sanford Bruce (120772) – Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) – 336th Squadron, 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing (USAF) – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 24 January 1953 and AFRO 55/53 dated 6 February 1953. Born in Hull, Quebec, 7 May 1924; enlisted in Montreal, 1 June 1942; trained at No.3 ITS (graduated 31 December 1942), No.13 EFTS and No.2 SFTS (graduated 6 August 1943) and No.31 General Reconnaissance School. Oversea from November 1943 to January 1946 with Nos.58, 422 and 435 Squadrons. Released 8 March 1946; re-engaged in Auxiliary, October 1948, and transferred to Regular Force on 12 November 1951. Served in Korea, 10 March to 12 June 1952. Flew 82 missions, 113 combat hours, 15 non-combat hours. Claimed one MG-15 probably destroyed, two MG-15s damaged, one locomotive damaged, two trucks damaged. Following Korea he served at No.1 OTU (14 June 1952 to 6 January 1954, and with No.410 Squadron (7 January 1954 to 20 September 1955), after which he was released from RCAF. See H.A. Halliday, “In Korean Skies”, Roundel, December 1963 and January 1964.\n\nOn 13 May 1952, Flying Officer Fleming distinguished himself by extraordinary achievement and heroism while participating in aerial combat against enemies of the United Nations in Korea. As element leader in the lead flight of eight F-86s escorting an RF-80 photo reconnaissance in the Sui Ho Reservoir area, he sighted sixteen MIGs preparing for an attack. Calling a break he led his element into the first flight of four MIGs and his attack scattered the enemy flight. Returning to cover, he sighted two MIGs diving on the RF-80 and two escorting F-86s. Pressing in on one of the MIGs, he fired scoring hits on its fuselage and wing area and then continued his brilliant attack on the second MIG as it countered. With the safe withdrawal of the RF-80, Flying Officer Fleming followed, being low on fuel and ammunition at the time. His courageous devotion to duty, resulting in the probable destruction of one MIG and the safe withdrawal of the RF-80, reflects great credit upon himself, his comrades-in-arms of the United Nations and the United States Air Force.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFOX, Squadron Leader William White (19703) – Air Medal (United States) – 16th Fighter Interceptor Wing (USAF) – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 26 June 1954 and AFRO 362/54 dated 2 July 1954. Joined RCAF, June 1941; wings April 1942; flew on tour with No.115 (Bomber Reconnaissance) Squadron (Bolingbrokes and Venturas). Posted to England in 1944 for transport flying. Continued on transport duties when he returned to Canada; attached to No.420 (Auxiliary) Squadron in 1949 as instructor; to RCAF Station Chatham, 1952. Attached to Special Force (Korea), 14 May to 6 November 1953, serving with 16th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, 22 May to 31 October 1953. Flew 98 hours 20 minutes (combat) and 59 minutes 55 minutes (non-combat) in Korea. Photo PL-110016 shows him. Medal presented at American Embassy, London, 1 March 1955. See H.A. Halliday, “In Korean Skies”, Roundel, December 1963 and January 1964.\n\nSquadron Leader William W. Fox distinguished himself by meritorious achievement during the period 2 June 1953 to 27 July 1953 while participating in twenty combat missions against the enemy over North Korea as pilot of an F-86 type aircraft, 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force. During frequent encounters with high performance enemy jet aircraft, his courage, aggressiveness and proficiency contributed greatly to the ultimate success of the assigned mission. Through his valour, outstanding airmanship and devotion to duty on these occasions Squadron Leader Fox has reflected great credit upon himself and the United Nations Forces.\n\n* * * * *\n\nGAGNON, Flying Officer Joseph Thomas Serge Lorrain (82040) – Queen’s Commendation for Valuable Services in the Air – United Nations Emergency Force – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 16 September 1967.

Simpson (Queen’s Commendation for Brave Conduct) for citation.\n\n* * * * *\n\nGELINAS, Leading Aircraftman Roland Bernard (29503) – British Empire Medal – No.410 Squadron – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 29 November 1952 and AFRO 811/52. Born 22 June 1927 in St.Barnabe Nord, Quebec; home in Ste.Foy, Quebec (factory worker); enlisted in Quebec City, 19 October 1949. Trained at No.2 TTS, Camp Borden, 20 January to 10 August 1950; at Station St.Hubert, 11 August 1950 to 31 March 1951; with No.410 Squadron, 1 April 1951 to 17 February 1952. NOTE: the airman in question was AC1 William Albert Richards. Gelinas was recommended by G/C E.B. Hale on 18 January 1952 for a George Medal. LAC D.S. Beach was the airman in the cockpit; he received a CAS’s Letter of Commendation; “His quick thinking and presence of mind undoubtedly saved the lives of two airmen.” The GM recommendation was downgraded to BEM by the Senior Sub-Committee of the Awards Co-Ordination Committee meeting in April 1952. See RCAF file 45-26-1 “Honours and Awards – Recommendations – 29503 LAC R.B. Gelinas, 14320 LAC D.S. Beach” in RG.24, Volume 5378.\n\nOn the morning of 30 November 1951, at Renfrew Airport, near Glasgow, Scotland, an F-86 Sabre jet aircraft was being run up to full power during a routine engine test prior to a test flight. When the engine was producing approximately ninety percent power, the airman who was in the cockpit of the aircraft, doing the engine run up, felt a pronounced jolt and immediately switched off the engine. It is normal, however, for jet engines when operating from such a power setting to take some fifteen seconds to return to idling speed. Leading Aircraftman Gelinas who was working nearby on the same aircraft, instantly ascertained that an airman had been drawn into the air intake duct of the aircraft. Displaying the utmost courage and with complete disregard for his own safety, he dove into the mouth of the air intake duct and seized the legs of the unfortunate airman, who had by this time been drawn in against the engine screen, some eight feet from the nose of the aircraft. Despite the fact he too was partially drawn into the air intake duct, Leading Aircraftman Gelinas continued to retain his hold on the airman’s legs until the engine stopped. By his prompt and courageous action, Leading Aircraftman Gelinas succeeded in saving his fellow airman from serious injury or death and is deserving of high praise.\n\n* * * * *\n\nGIBBS, Flight Lieutenant Paul Lewis, DFC (19788) – Air Force Cross – No.123 Search and Rescue Unit – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 15 September 1951 and AFRO 566/51. Born at Onion Lake, Saskatchewan, 28 August 1917; home in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan (hunter). Enlisted 17 May 1940; trained at No.1 ITS (graduated 21 June 1940), No.4 EFTS (graduated 31 August 1940) and No.2 SFTS (graduated 25 October 1941). Commissioned December 1941. Served two tours in UK, Northwest Europe, Africa and Italy; awarded DFC, 29 December 1944. Demobilized in October 1945, spent one year in civilian life and rejoined RCAF, 1 October 1946. This award (and an AFC for Glaister, BEM for Wright) began as a recommendation (undated) from G/C J.A. Easton, Group Commander, No.12 Group; on 16 February 1951 A/V/M C.R. Dunlap concurred on the original recommendations (although oddly enough his letter to Chief of the Air Staff, forwarding the recommendations, is dated 13 February 1951). These were reviewed by the Senior Sub Committee of the Awards Co-Ordination Committee which concluded that they came within existing policy with respect to the granting of awards in peacetime – “bravery was displayed and a saving of lives effected” (S/L K.E. Ball signing for W/C W/J. Brodribb, Chairman, Senior Sub Committee of Awards Co-Ordination, in memo to Secretary, Personnel Members Committee, 21 April 1951). The Personnel Members Committee met on 21 April 1951 and concurred. The recommendations then went to the Defence Council (7 May 1951) which approved (31 May 1951)) and then from Major-General W.H.S. Macklin (Chairman, Personnel Members Committee) to Mr. C. Stein, Under Secretary of State and Chairman of Awards Co-ordinating Committee, 27 June 1951. Stein wrote back to Macklin on 12 July 1951, stating in part, “On the basis of the practice and precedence of the Awards Co-Ordination Committee, I feel no exception would be taken to the proposed awards in these three cases.” The Minister of National Defence (Claxton), “having been designated by the Prime Minister for this purpose”, then wrote directly to the Governor General, 20 July 1951. It is not clear when this was forwarded to London, but on 21 August 1951 Major-General H.F.G. Letson (Secretary to the Governor General) wrote to Claxton – “Word has been received from the Private Secretary to The King to the effect that His Majesty has been pleased to approve the Prime Minister’s recommendation that the Air Force Cross be awarded to Flight Lieutenant P.L. Gibbs and Flying Officer R.T.S. Glaister, and the British Empire Medal to Sergeant D. Wright. It remained only for gazetting to be arranged in the Canada Gazette of 15 September 1951; on 12 September 1951 Air Marshal W.A. Curtis (Chief of the Air Staff) wrote letters of congratulation to all three. The above all found in RCAF file 45-26-1 “Honours and Awards – Service Recommendations – Captain” (the operation was called “Captain”), found in RG.24 Vol.5378.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Gibbs acted as captain of a Dakota aircraft assisting in the search operations for a missing Canadian Pacific Airlines passenger aircraft in the British Columbia section of the Canadian Rockies. On the morning of the 23rd December, 1950, after receiving reports that a wrecked aircraft had been sighted on Okanagan Mountain, he undertook to proceed to the designated location despite extremely adverse flying weather and dangerous icing conditions. Arriving over the crash scene he quickly appreciated that it would be only a matter of minutes before the whole area was completely obscured by cloud. Although the cloud base was then indeterminate at 5,500 feet and the high ground (7,200 feet) was obscured, he chose the only possible flight path which offered the Para Rescue Team a clear and accurate drop, even though this entailed a definite element of risk. The crash was at the 4,000 foot level and this officer, ensuring that the Para Rescue Team should have every possible advantage, made the necessary test runs at 5,000 feet, picking up considerable ice while doing so. As a result of Flight Lieutenant Gibbs’ skilful and resolute flying the Para Jumpers and medical supplies reached the survivors minutes after leaving the aircraft. He then landed at Penticton where he was appointed local search co-ordinator. Working in close co-operation with Canadian Pacific Airlines officials, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and local civilians, he planned the successful evacuation of the survivors, showing a high degree of organizational ability and leadership. The courageous, exacting and skilful flying displayed by this officer contributed materially to the success of the rescue operation and set an example that was an inspiration to those under him.\n\n* * * * *\n\nGLAISTER, Flying Officer Robert Thomas (27926) – Air Force Cross – No.123 Search and Rescue Unit, Sea Island – Awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 15 September 1951 and AFRO 566/51. Born at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, 17 March 1922. Educated there. Enlisted in Regina, 26 June 1942; commissioned 1943. Completed one tour overseas with No.191 Squadron. Released 29 October 1945; re-enlisted 9 April 1948. Had served in Edmonton, Saskatoon, Summerside, Vancouver, Trenton and Centralia as of award. Incident occurred 22-23 December 1950. See Gibbs, AFC, for comments about procedure.\n\nThis officer was captain of a Dakota aircraft detailed to search for a Canadian Pacific Airlines passenger aircraft reported missing over the Canadian Rockies in the province of British Columbia. Although encountering extremely adverse climatic conditions and violent air turbulence in wintry December weather, after many hours of arduous flying he located what appeared to be signal fires on the eastern slopes of Okanagan Mountain. In order to ascertain definitely that the signals were being made by crash survivors, Flying Officer Glaister reduced height to a point where, by switching on his landing lights, he was able to distinguish people waving firebrands and improvised signals. This was accomplished despite the fact that the crash was at the 4,000-foot level while the high ground in the immediate mountainous terrain was covered in cloud and extended to 7,200 feet. This precise pin-pointing of the crashed aircraft, skilfully executed in hazardous flying conditions, enabled a ground search party to proceed directly to the disaster and immediately evacuate eight of the sixteen surviving passengers within a few hours. This officer’s exceptionally skilful and courageous devotion to duty was in keeping with the finest traditions of the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\n* * * * *\n\nGLOVER, Flight Lieutenant Ernest Arthur (17484) – Distinguished Flying Cross – 334th Squadron, 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing (USAF) – awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 17 January 1953 and AFRO dated 23 January 1953.

Air Cadet Officer, commanding No.117 Air Cadet Squadron, ir being noted on 17 August 1948 that he had “developed the squadron from its a state of inactivity to its present strength of approximately 180 enthusiastic members”. Joined postwar RCAF in Toronto, 2 November 1948 on Short Service Commission which was converted to Permanent Commission, 15 September 1952. Posted from Toronto to St. Hubert, 1 December 1948 (No.1 OTU there at that date). To No.426 Squadron, Dorval, 11 February 1949. To Station St, Hubert, 5 June 1949.

Joined 334th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Kimpo Airfield (Seoul), 20 June 1952; flew first sortie on 4 July but saw no enemy aircraft until 26 August 1952, after which he encountered them almost every day. Damaged two MIG-15s on 30 August 1952. On 8 September, flying as No.4 in a flight, he encountered two MIGs. The Sabres closed but MIG evasive action frustrated some; they made a hard right turn which the No.1 and 2 Sabre pilots could not follow; Glover, in an advantageous position, fired and observed hits. The MIGs dived from 40,000 to 15,000 feet; during a violent pull-up, the No.2 MIG lost control and plunged into ground; Glover pursued the other to the Yalu River. On 9 September, escorting Thunderjets attacking North Korean Military Academy at Sakehu, some 175 MIGs tried to intervene. Six MIGs shot down; Glover claimed one which had been closing on an F-84 when he fired. On 16 September, leading three Sabres, he attacked twenty MIGs, one of which he set on fire.

Because of his above average qualities as a combat pilot he was rapidly promoted to flight leader, and whilst so employed, completed his duties with distinction, valour and merit. During his tour of duty he destroyed three MIG-15 aircraft and seriously damaged two others. This excellent record not only brings credit to Flight Lieutenant Glover, but has greatly enhanced the reputation of the Royal Canadian Air Force in this theatre.This began as a recommendation on 12 October 1952 by W/C R.T.P Davidson (4th Fighter Interceptor Wing, APO 970, San Francisco to Air Member, Canadian Joint Staff, Washington: 1. During the past five months, Flight Lieutenant Glover has been attached to the 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing, USAF, in the Korean Theatre. While so attached Flight Lieutenant Glover has displayed the most commendable aggressive spirit coupled with excellent fighting ability. Because of his above average qualities as a combat pilot he was rapidly promoted to Flight Leader, and whilst so employed completed his duties with distinction, valour and merit. During his tour of duty this officer destroyed three MIG-15 aircraft and seriously damaged two others. This excellent record not only brings credit to Flight Lieutenant Glover, but has greatly enhanced the reputation of the Royal Canadian Air Force in this theatre.2. It is recommended therefore that, that Flight Lieutenant E.A. Glover be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nThis was communicated to AFHQ, Ottawa, on 14 November 1952. On 22 November 1952 the following memo was sent by Air Commodore L.E. Wray (acting Air Member for Personnel) to the Chief of the Air Staff:\n\n1. W/C R.T.P. Davidson, who is presently serving with the 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing in Korea, has submitted a recommendation for the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to F/L Glover for his outstanding flying while in Korea. The Air Advisor to the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo has advised that the USAF Commander concurs in this recommendation. A copy of the citation is at flagged folio.2. The quota of operational awards for the Royal Canadian Air Force, as approved by his Late Majesty The King, is one award for each 300 aircraft operational hours. Unfortunately there is no record at AFHQ of the actual number of operational hours flown by RCAF Fighter Pilots in Korea but arrangements have now been made to have this information supplied. In the meantime, since eight officers have already completed tours in Korea and five additional pilots are attached to the USAF fighter forces in that theatre at the present time, there is no doubt that over 300 operational hours have been flown by RCAF pilots in Korea, and we are entitled to at least one operational award.\n\n3. It is considered that F/L Glover is deserving of the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service in Korea and, if you consider, action will be taken to obtain the approval of Her Majesty The Queen for this award.\n\nThis was communicated to the Minister of National Defence on 6 December 1952 (Air Vice-Marshal F.R. Miller, Acting Chief of the Air Staff to the Minister). In turn it was sent to the Governor General on 8 December 1952 (Ralph Campney, whose letter included the following statement:\n\nThe proposed award is for operational service and accordingly, the prior concurrence of the Awards Co-ordination Committee is not required.The Governor General duly submitted the recommendation to the Queen. On 31 December 1952 a reply was sent by The Queen’s Private Secretary to Government House stating that she had approved the award. On 3 January 1953 this was communicated from Government House to the Minister of National Defence and gazetting action commenced, ensuring simultaneous publication in the London Gazette and the Canada Gazette. A letter dated 15 January 1953 (Air Marshal W.A. Curtis, Chief of the Air Staff to Glover) informed Glover of the forthcoming award and congratulated him.\n\nGLOVER, Flight Lieutenant Ernest Arthur (17484) – Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) – 334th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing (USAF) – awarded as per Canada Gazette dated 14 March 1953.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Ernest A. Glover distinguished himself on 8 September 1952 by extraordinary achievement as the pilot of an F-86 aircraft, 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force in Korea. Flight Lieutenant Glover was flying number four position when a two ship element of MIGs was intercepted. The F-86 flight closed, but in the evasive action the MIGs made a hard right turn which the number one and two men were unable to follow. Flight Lieutenant Glover, being in a more advantageous position, fired, observing immediate hits. The MIGs dived from 40,000 to 15,000 feet and during one violent pull up, the number two MIG went out of control and plunged into the ground. The lead MIG with Flight Lieutenant Glover still firing reached the sanctuary of the Yalu River. By this demonstration of tactical skill Flight Lieutenant Glover destroyed one MIG and inflicted damage on another, reflecting the highest credit upon himself, the Royal Canadian Air Force and the United States Air Force.GLOVER, Flight Lieutenant Ernest Arthur (17484) – Air Medal (United States) – 334th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. Date uncertain; under RCAF policies as laid down in 1952, Glover was not permitted to receive this award, as he had also been awarded an American DFC. Flight Lieutenant Ernest A. Glover distinguished himself by meritorious achievement while participating in aerial combat as a pilot of an F-86 aircraft, 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force, from 4 July 1952 to 29 August 1952. As well as being frequently outnumbered by enemy jet fighters, adverse weather conditions were often a factor which added greatly to the difficulties encountered in successfully carrying out the assigned mission. As a result of his valour, proficiency and devotion to duty on these occasions, he has reflected great credit upon himself, his comrades in arms of the United Nations and the Royal Canadian Air Force.Note: On 25 August 1963, F/O H.A. Halliday inquired about certain points respecting RCAF pilots (RCAF file 045-8). On 18 September 1963 Mr. Albert F. Simpson, Aerospace Studies Institute (Air University, United States Air Force, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama) wrote to F/O Halliday (RCAF Headquarters, Office of Air Historian) on these points. The portion pertinent to Glover read as follows: On 8 September 1952, while flying with the 334th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, F/L E.A. Glover was credited with a MIG damaged and Captain M.P. Mitchell flying wing confirmed the claim. On 9 September, F/L Glover claimed a MIG destroyed which was confirmed by Captain Mitchell. On 16 September, F/L Glover destroyed another MIG. On 20 October 1952, FEAF General Order No.536 confirmed the aircraft claimed destroyed on 9 September, and on 25 October 1952, FEAF General Order No.544 credited F/L Glover with destruction of the MIG that was originally reported as damaged on 8 September 1952. Available records do not mention that this first victory was later confirmed by a U.S. Navy pilot, but the first victory was obviously the one which was in question for a few days.Further to these citations and statements, the following excerpts from General Orders, Headquarters, Far East Air Forces (USAF) are pertinent: Flight Lieutenant Ernest A. Glover, 17484, Royal Canadian Air Force, 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, is officially credited with the destruction of one MIG-15 type aircraft in aerial combat at 1215I on 8 September 1952 near Uiju, Korea.

Mitigating circumstances – high winds which swung Magister. “Sergeant Glover is apparently of above average ability for the course and it is proposed to continue his training.”\n\nAccident, 24 March 1942, No.1 Squadron, Hurricane II BD946, 0005 hours. Night flying exercise. “When coming in to land on March 24th at 0005 hours I told the controller that I did not need the Searchlight as it was very moonlight. As I came in to land I levelled off too high ans stalled the starboard wing due to loss of airspeed. As the wing dropped I tried engine to pick it up but it hit the ground, throwing the nose into the earth and the undercarriage gave way at the same time.” Deemed to be error of judgement due to inexerience.\n\nAccident, 19 July 1942, 0245 hours, No.1 Squadron, Hurricane BN966. Night flying exercise. |On completion of normal night circuits I turned into wind and prepared to land. The aircraft touched down a good distance up the runway and overshot the end. As I approached the end of the runway I braked hard but was unable to stop the aircraft which ran into a hedge just past the end of the runway, tipped up on its nose damaging the undercarriage, wing, airscrew and engine bearings.” Assessed as “error in judgement.” At the time he had 150 hours on type.\n\nAccident, 21 September 1941, 1040 hours, No.1 Squadron, Typhoon IB, R7863. Minimal damage. “I took off to carry out air firing practice. Engine appeared quite normal. On opening the throttle for attack on drogue at 3,200 r.p.m. the engine cut out. I broke off attack, turned on to reserve tanks, put engine in full fine, gaining height with surplus speed. I found the engine ran okay below zero boost but cut out when it was exceeded so I set the throttle to minus two pounds and landed back at base.” Found to have a cracked cylinder. “Sleeve trouble is a known fault on these eng"
