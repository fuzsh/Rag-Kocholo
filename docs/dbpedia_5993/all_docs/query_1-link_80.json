        "text": "(A chapter heading from Janet Browne’s second volume of her biography: Charles Darwin: The Power of Place).\n\nHere’s what Ernst Mayr, widely considered as perhaps the greatest evolutionist of the 20th cent, (had to say about the biography):\n\nThere is no better chronicle of Darwin as human being, friend, and indefatigable scientist; or anywhere a richer description of his milieu, his family life, his social circle, and his scientific contributions. Browne’s extraordinary knowledge of the literature of the period makes her account particularly insightful…{A} Masterpiece…Browne knows how to spellbind the reader.”\n\nAnd here’s what John Tyler Bonner, of Princeton University, says; I realized that I never fully understood Fitzroy, or Lyell, or Dr Darwin, or Emma, especially Darwin himself. Janet Browne not only makes these historical figures real, three-dimensional people, but she shows so elegantly how they affected and interacted with one another. This is not just another biography of Darwin, but a unique and important contribution: it will outlast all others. The scholarship is … impeccable.”\n\nJanet Brownes intuitive understanding of 19th century Victorian culture and science is without precedent. There are at least fourteen thousand known letters, to and from Darwin (all of which she seems to have read). What I find truly amazing about Janet Browne, is her ability to block seemingly random strands and weave them into a compelling, narrative mosaic of the birth of The Origin of Species. The effect is uncanny, it’s as though we are eavesdropping on Darwin’s actual thoughts as he’s in the process of revolutionizing our understanding of our place in the universe. It all adds up to a scientific biography of the highest caliber that reads like a first rate detective story.\n\nHer writing is so seamless, and natural, you don’t realize at first that she is, on top of everything else, a prose artist.\n\nThe Darwin that emerges is a flesh and blood character. A child of his times, who- through incredible single-mindedness and a magical intuitive grasp of the inner workings of nature, becomes a transcendental, world-historical figure\n\nAs someone who has considered himself a Darwinian, ever since he read On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects, and On the Good Effects of Intercrossing; and who over the years has read scores of books by and about Darwin- this book could not have resonated more with me. On whatever level on which you engage it, the book is superb.\n\nBrowne breaths Darwinianism as easily as she breathes oxygen. Her magestic, two-volume biography: Voyaging, and, The Power of Place- the prize: a staggering 1000 plus pages.\n\nTaking the distinctions and consequences together in Victorian context, Darwin’s writing was ultimately both unique and part of a longer corpus of preexisting evolutionary thought. There could be no mistaking the weight of thought that lay behind every word, the judicious strategy, the powerful, transformative metaphors, his notion of a “great tree of life,” the interlocking double-punch of detail, and breadth of vision. Although he subsequently complained that he had been rushed into the Origin of Species, that it was nothing but an abstract, that his evidence was truncated and his footnotes and sources were omitted, it was undeniably his masterpiece.\n\n(As Darwin himself noted: “when the views entertained in this volume On the Origin of Species, or when analogous views are generally admitted, we can dimly foresee there will be a considerable revolution in natural history,” he declared fervently in the opening pages. “I look with confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality.”\n\n(Darwin: ) “When we no longer look back at an organic being, as a savage looks at a ship, as if something wholly beyond its comprehension, which is had the history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention, as the summing up of the labor ,the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become. “\n\nAll his hopes came to a crescendo. Simultaneously domestic and universal in tone, Darwin had achieved something extraordinary. One particular country lane, that he visited on walks around Downe, filled his mind; (Darwin: ) “It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us…there’s grandeur in this view of life..with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one form; and that while this has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple a beginning, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.”\n\nHe hardly anticipated, as Janet Browne notes; how austere, tragic, how supremely beautiful his work would appear to others.\n\nShe shows us as no other writer does, what it was like to be Darwin: as an invalid; as a methodical, country squire; as a solitary genius: giving justice to the many sides of his character that would emerge during the last 25 years of his life.\n\nIn Janet Browne, Darwin finds his perfect biographer; her multifaceted treatment of Darwin is reminiscent of Joseph Frank’s magisterial five-volume biography of Fyodor Dostoevski. Every volume is filled with a kind of rich detail, which William James famously characterised as thick description.\n\nI especially like how close she seems to her subject; how she seems to disappear as a self-conscious reporter; and, like a kindred soul, magically fuses with her protagonist. She makes us see how extraordinary an observer Darwin was, how a naturalist; how to the manner born he was; how in the strangest ways, nature seemed to be calling to him, whispering to him.\n\nShe shows us how, without a single equation, a single definitive experimental test; Darwin could tease out hidden affinities; could uncover the crucial fact, the fact that is so representational, and paradigmatic that it truly — for those who have eyed to see — contains multitudes.\n\nShe shows us in exquisite detail how Darwin could be so farsighted: his incredible ability to detect structural affinities between seemingly disparate disciplines- that even giants of Victorian science like Charles Lyell, Julian Huxley, Joseph Hooker, and Asa Gray could not and would not accept. She shows us how Darwin, despite being the quintessential Victorian gentleman scholar, could write (in The Descent of Man) that “Once upon a time, men and women had hair all over their bodies, and both had beards and pointed ears.”\n\nHow Darwin (with absolutely no formal training in mathematics or physics) — (but with a profound sense of deep, evolutionary time — insist that Lord Kelvin’s (a dominant Victorian physicist) claim that the earth could not be older than a few hundred thousand years, had to be drastically wrong.\n\nOf all Darwin’s amazing accomplishments, to my mind, the greatest is the very last: at the end of On the Origin Of Species, there is as mentioned the famous paragraph beginning with “there is grandeur in this view of life…” Consider for a moment what Darwin is saying: he is predicting in 1861 that the origin of all known life — animal, plant, human, invertebrate, vertebrate, insect — derives from one or several life forms. Given that genetics and the laws of Mendelian Heredity had yet to be discovered, can there be a greater more mind blowing and definitive prediction of DNA than that?\n\nNot surprisingly, On the Origin of Species is generally considered the most influential, history-making science-book ever written. And his theory of natural selection, combined with Descent…, with modifications, is routinely ranked with :\n\nNewton’s Universal Law of Gravitation; showing that all motion from apples to planets obey the same law.\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell’s establishing the fundamental law of Electromagnetism; combining electricity, magnetism, and light into a glorious unity.\n\nAlbert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity; predicting, 100 years ago, the existence of curved spacetime, black holes, and multiple messenger astronomy.\n\nIn sum: you could read a thousand books and not come across one as good as Janet Browne’s. So, be good to yourself, and please read the book.\n\n- Gerald Alper is the author of Portrait of the Artist as a Young Patient (Psychodynamic Studies of the Creative Personality).
