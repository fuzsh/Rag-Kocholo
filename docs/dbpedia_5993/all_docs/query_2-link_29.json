        "text": "ATTENTION! SPOILERS AHEAD!!\n\nThis article contains information from later episodes of The Magnus Archives and may contain major spoilers for the setting and plot. Continue at your own risk.\n\n\"Imagine you are an ant, and you have never before seen a human. Then one day, into your colony, a huge fingernail is thrust, scraping and digging. You flee to another entrance, only to be confronted by a staring eye gazing at you. You climb to the top, trying to find escape, and above, you can see the vast, dark shadow of a boot falling upon you. Would that ant be able to construct these things into the form of a single human being? Or would it believe itself to be under attack by three different, equally terrible, but very distinct assailants?\"\n\n- Jurgen Leitner, MAG 80\n\n“These things... these forces, they are our fear. Deep fears. Primordial. Always looking for ways to grow and spread.”\n\n- Gerard Keay, MAG 111\n\nThe Entities, also called the Fears, the Powers, the Dread Powers, and The Things That Were Fear are the principle antagonists of The Magnus Archives, and the phenomena that more mundane and earthly antagonists serve.\n\nThey are various aspects of an amorphous force of fear that exists next to reality. They are variously also referred to as \"Gods\", \"powers\", or simply as \"the Fears\". Their influence upon reality manifests as supernatural happenings — all supernatural phenomena in the world are simply extensions of them. These phenomena can take various forms such as people, animals, monsters, books, objects, or places, all with the goal of evoking fear, terror, and paranoia from all who encounter them.\n\nThese entities do not simply feed off of fear but are fears made manifest. It is not only human fear that counts but that of animals as well, particularly for The Flesh and The Hunt. The more fearful the world is of a certain thing, the more powerful the related entity becomes, becoming empowered by the increased fear of its realm of influence.\n\nOrigins and Nature\n\nOriginally there was only one entity, implied to be (or least survive as) The Hunt. This entity existed before humans, and fed on animal fears.[1]\n\nAs humans evolved and began to develop language and complex thoughts, they began to tear it apart into smaller and more specific fears, causing the current multiple entities to exist. As these new entities grew and fought among each other, they felt the urge to enter our world and \"become one with the minds below\". They received the opportunity to do this with the first avatars, who opened the first connection between their realm and ours. And from that they gained the ability to influence our world.\n\nMost entities are near mindless; unable to conceptualize time or themselves and motivated purely by their desire to feed on fear and enter our world. The two exceptions are The Web and The End. They are at least sentient enough to make complex long term plans to escape this universe and to destroy reality, respectively.\n\nEntities\n\n“Like colours, but if colours hated me.”\n\n- Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of The Magnus Institute, London, MAG 111\n\nSmirke's List\n\nRobert Smirke categorised all the disparate entities into 14 main categories. Each Entity is comprised of a variety of smaller terrors, some direct, some abstract, and some tend to bleed over between one Entity and the next. Whilst fears do change and are subject to place, time, and culture, they are thought to have remained fairly stable since the industrial revolution, though an entity's power fluctuates with the world's fear of their domain. Each entity has a variety of names, though Smirke's names are generally the most commonly used.\n\nThese classifications are much like colours, infinite fears that can be grouped into a few categories — each entity can be separated to some degree, but the fears bleed and feed into one another around the edges, and within each entity are different shades of the same hue. This also works to explain why some entities oppose one another, their colours \"clash\" like red and green or blue and orange.\n\nThe Buried\n\nMain article: The Buried\n\nAlso called The Centre, Choke, Too Close I Cannot Breathe, Forever Deep Below Creation.\n\nThe fear of small spaces, suffocating, drowning, being buried alive. Fear of everything crashing down around/on oneself. Fear of being trapped without enough space.\n\nManifests as caves, dirt, financial issues, heavy rain, underground transport, tight spaces such as coffins.\n\nArtifacts associated with The Buried: The Coffin, The Box,[2] DIG,[3] Seven Lamps of Architecture.\n\nKnown avatars and servants of The Buried: \"The Governor”, Enrique MacMillian, Hezekiah Wakely.\n\nThe Buried's ritual is called the Sunken Sky.[4]\n\nThis entity was two in Sims' first draft of the Fears: Breathless and Close.\n\nThe Corruption\n\nMain article: The Corruption\n\nAlso called Filth, The Crawling Rot, Flesh Hive.\n\nThe fear of corruption, disease, filth. Fear of the feelings of disgust, revulsion and the things or beings that might evoke such feelings.\n\nManifests as mould, bugs, rot, decay, infection, the feeling of one's skin crawling.

Also has close ties to dreams and can manifest through them.\n\nArtefacts associated with The End: Book of the Dead, Catalogue of the Trapped Dead, Death's Game Pieces.[14]\n\nKnown avatars and servants of The End: Justin Gough, Nathaniel Thorp, Oliver Banks, Tova McHugh.\n\nThe End has no known attempts at a ritual. According to Peter Lukas this is because it sees no need to, as Death claims all in the end.[15][16]\n\nThe Eye\n\nMain article: The Eye\n\nAlso called Beholding, The Ceaseless Watcher, It Knows You, The Great Eye that watches all who linger in terror and gorges itself on the sufferings of those under its unrelenting stuporous gaze.\n\nThe fear of being watched, exposed, followed, having secrets exposed.

Daisy suggests that the Hunt is too caught up in the chase to ever reach the end of its ritual if it has an end at all.[21]\n\nIn Jonathan Sims' first list of what would become the Entities, this one was called Fang.\n\nThe Lonely\n\nMain article: The Lonely\n\nAlso called Forsaken, The One Alone.\n\nThe fear of isolation, of being completely cut off and alone or disconnected from the rest of society.\n\nManifests as fog, large rooms, silence, suburbs, empty rooms, crowds of faceless people.\n\nArtefacts associated with The Lonely: A Disappearance (suspected), The Boatswain's Call,[22] Lonely Painting.[23]\n\nKnown avatars and servants of The Lonely: The Lukas Family (Peter Lukas, Mordechai Lukas, Conrad Lukas,) Martin Blackwood.\n\nPeter Lukas attempted a ritual for The Lonely dubbed \"The Silence.\"[24]\n\nThe Slaughter\n\nMain article: The Slaughter\n\nThe fear of pure, unpredictable, unmotivated violence. The fear of pain coming at sudden, random moments.\n\nManifests as people driven \"mad with Slaughter,\" soldiers, music that either induces Slaughter or warns that Slaughter is coming. Often manifests in imagery of war or murder, and can appear wild like a frenzied killer or calm and regimented like soldiers firing on the battlefield.\n\nArtefacts associated with The Slaughter: Blood Money,[23] Slaughter Gun,[25] Slaughter Knife,[26] a rusted train car which perpetually smells of blood and which houses the spirit of a WWII medic driven mad by Slaughter,[27] \"slaughter book\".[28]\n\nKnown avatars and servants of The Slaughter: Alfred Grifter, Amritsar Ghosts, Melanie King, The Deserter, \"The Piper\".\n\nThe Slaughter's only known attempt at a ritual was called \"The Risen War.\"[29]\n\nThis fear was named Butchery before the Entities were fully formed.\n\nThe Spiral\n\nMain article: The Spiral\n\nAlso called Es Mentiras (It Is Lies), The Twisting Deceit, It Is Not What It Is.\n\nThe fear of madness, that the world you know is wrong, that your mind is lying to you.

More broadly: the human fear of insignificance and meaninglessness, of losing oneself in too much space.\n\nManifests as void, wide-open spaces, vertigo, falling, the transformation of something that should have a limit into something infinite.\n\nArtefacts associated with The Vast: Ex Altiora.\n\nKnown avatars and servants of The Vast: Michael \"Mike\" Crew, The Fairchilds (Simon Fairchild, Harriet Fairchild).\n\nThe Vast's only known ritual was called \"The Awful Deep.\"[37]\n\nThis fear was known as Vertigo in Sims' earliest drafts.\n\nThe Web\n\nMain article: The Web\n\nAlso called The Spider, The Great Spider, Mother of Puppets, The Mother, The Spinner of Schemes, The Hidden Machination.\n\nThe fear of being controlled or trapped, especially being unaware of one's own entrapment. The fear of being forced to do things against one's own will, of being manipulated. Also the fear of spiders.\n\nManifests as spiders, spider webs, web-like patterns, puppets.\n\nArtefacts associated with The Web: The Web Table, A Guest for Mr. Spider, 蜘蛛が食べている (kumo ga tabete iru).[38]\n\nKnown avatars and servants of The Web: Annabelle Cane, Emma Harvey, Neil Lagorio, Raymond Fielding.\n\nAccording to Peter Lukas, The Web has never attempted a ritual, presumably because it likes or accepts the world as it is.[15] It is also possible that The Web never attempted a ritual because it was more focused on using The Mass Ritual to escape to other universes than having a ritual of its own.\n\nThe Web first appeared as Weaver, before the Entities gained definite articles.\n\nDekker's Addendum\n\nThe Extinction\n\nMain article: The Extinction\n\nAlso called The Terrible Change, The Future Without Us, The World Is Always Ending.\n\nA new entity hypothesized by Adelard Dekker to be currently emerging. As of MAG 175, it is confirmed to exist, although whether it is on the same level as the other Entities or the existential threat Dekker feared remains unclear.\n\nThe fear of catastrophic change, destruction of nature, destruction of human skin and tissue, the destruction of humanity itself and its replacement by something different; all of this especially via mankind's own causing.\n\nManifests through human technology such as computers, code, and radio, and seems to present horrifying visions of what humans could become, or what could become of humans.\n\nMost avatars agree that they would like to prevent The Extinction from emerging if possible.[37]\n\nManifestations\n\nAnimals\n\nAspects of The Entities can appear as animals, such as the Monster Pig[39] or Agape the dog[40]. It is unclear if Monster Pig is a manifestation or an instance of an animal becoming an avatar.\n\nArtefacts\n\nThe Entities can manifest as a variety of objects possessing anomalous properties (such as a table, a coffin, etc). They frequently manifest as books, which are said to represent the Entities in a \"purer\" form[41].\n\nLocations\n\nPeople can slip into a form of extra-dimensional space when influenced by a Fear. These spaces do not function under regular logic and the passage of time can also be distorted. These spaces can be delineated by a threshold or simply manifest spontaneously around a person. Escape can be achieved by physically exiting the manifestation, or by a change in the person’s mental or emotional state. Examples include:\n\nThe abattoir in MAG 30\n\nThe old part of town in MAG 48\n\nThe coffin in MAG 132\n\nThe cul-de-sac in MAG 150\n\nThe amusement park in MAG 156\n\nPeople\n\nSome humans can become attached to an Entity and become empowered by it, gaining supernatural abilities related to their patron but losing some or all of their humanity in the process. They are referred to as avatars. Avatars usually have mentalities reflective of their patron.\n\nAvatars retain their agency but become physically dependent on their patron, suffering withdrawal effects, including death, if they go too long without feeding the entity that empowers them.\n\nA death is required for someone to become a fully realized avatar but it can be literal or metaphysical in nature. Fledgling avatars can still have powers, but fully realized avatars are significantly more powerful. Eventually, most avatars will become unable to die or be harmed by conventional means, requiring something specific to their nature, or a Hunter, to kill them.\n\nOther\n\nSome beings, such as the NotThem, vampires, etc, possess human qualities but it is unclear if they were ever human. Sometimes they consist in part of a human, such as The Distortion after it was combined with Michael Shelley. Sometimes they appear completely inhuman, like The Still And Lightless Beast and The Lichtenberg Figure.\n\nRituals\n\nMost entities have their own ‘ritual’, a symbolic act that, if completed, will allow the entity to merge with reality, changing the fabric of the world as it exerts its will and nature upon that reality. These rituals have the potential to bring other closely-tied entities along with it. It requires centuries for each Entity to build up the power needed for its ritual, and if it is stopped, it cannot try again until it rebuilds that power base. No ritual had ever succeeded as of MAG 159.\n\nIn MAG 160, Jonah Magnus reveals why: The entities are too closely connected to be summoned individually; they cannot be fully separated from each other due to overlap and opposing binaries. For example, the line between the Spiral and the Stranger can be blurred, and a world with only the Buried cannot exist because the Buried needs the contrast of open spaces to exist. A ritual attempting to summon a single entity will inevitably collapse under its weight. The only way to successfully complete a ritual is to summon every entity at once.\n\nJonah Magnus devises such a ritual using Jonathan Sims as a lynchpin. After being marked by every entity in his role as Archivist, he is made to recite an incantation to \"open the door\" and summon every entity at once. The reason an Archivist is needed for the ritual is that the Archivist functions as a living archive, not only recording events but embodying them. The power of events that involve the Archivist being marked by each of the Entities is enough to summon them, while also not splitting them up."
