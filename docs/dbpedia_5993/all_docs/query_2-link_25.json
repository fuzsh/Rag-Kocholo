The first college football game, at the FBS level, is August 24th when Florida State takes on Georgia Tech in Atlanta.\n\nKentucky will open its 2024 season the following Saturday against Southern Mississippi in Lexington. It will be their first season in the new SEC with Texas and Oklahoma joining the conference this season.\n\nCBS Sports recently revealed its preseason rankings of all 134 FBS teams, with Kentucky checking in at No. 32.\n\nAccording to CBS, Kentucky is the 10th highest-ranked team in the SEC, which illustrates how good and deep the SEC will be this season.\n\nGeorgia checks in at No. 1, followed by No. 4 Texas, No. 5 Alabama, No. 6 Ole Miss, No. 11 Missouri, No. 12 LSU, No. 15 Tennessee, No. 18 Oklahoma and No. 20 Texas A&M.\n\nKentucky faces Georgia, Ole Miss, Tennessee, and Texas this season.\n\nThe Louisville Cardinals, who Kentucky hosts in the regular-season finale, check in at No. 26.\n\nSouthern Miss, who Kentucky opens the season with, checks in at No. 116.\n\nOhio, who comes to Kentucky in Week 4, is ranked No. 90.\n\nThe Wildcats are projected to finish 11th in the SEC this season, ahead of Florida, South Carolina, Arkansas, Mississippi State, and Vanderbilt.\n\nWhere do you think the Cats should be ranked?
