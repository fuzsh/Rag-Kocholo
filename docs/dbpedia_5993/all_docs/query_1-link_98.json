        "meta_description": "Gerald Peters Gallery, New York, is pleased to announce our forthcoming exhibition Logan Maxwell Hagege: Flowers Will Grow. Comprised of 12 paintings by this star of the Western American Art world, it will be Hagege’s second solo exhibition in New York City. This is an extraordinary opportunity for east-coast audiences to see the paintings of an artist who has a loyal and enthusiastic following and consistently sold-out shows; remains a critical favorite across the world of Western American art; and has received numerous awards since his debut exhibition in 2002.Represented in museum collections across the country—including the Autry Museum of the American West, the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, the Eiteljorg Museum, and the Briscoe Western Art Museum—Hagege brings the subject matter of the West and the Southwest into the twenty-first century with a lyrical contemporary style, a masterful technique, and a brilliant palette that captures the beauty of the Southwest. Focusing on contemporary Native American subjects, the southwestern landscape, and classical western icons, Hagege’s paintings are based on a deep understanding of modern design principles. Melded with his appreciation for (and acute knowledge of) the traditions of American realism, Hagege’s paintings capture the magic and mystery of his subject matter while pushing the traditions of American realism into a contemporary visual space. Much of the focus of these new works is on the beauty of our natural world, incorporating landscape, nature and the people.",
