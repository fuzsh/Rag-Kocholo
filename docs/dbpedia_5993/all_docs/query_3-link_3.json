        "text": "The Gazette has been recording military and civilian achievements and honours for over 350 years. From those awarded in the monarch’s Birthday and New Year Honours lists to soldiers gazetted during World War 1 and World War 2, The Gazette’s extensive archives contain vast amounts of historical information which can be searched for free.\n\nWhat military and civilian honours are announced in The Gazette?\n\nNew Year and Birthday honours\n\nThe King's New Year and Birthday Honours are published in The Gazette twice a year, at New Year and on the King's official birthday. These supplements are published on behalf of the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood.\n\nThe Birthday and New Year Honours lists detail military, civilian and diplomatic awards (other than for gallantry), including:\n\nCompanion of Honour – an honour given to individuals who have made a significant contribution to the arts, science, medicine or the government over a long period of time. It is limited to just 65 people at any one time.\n\nKnight or Dame – the two senior ranks of the Order of the British Empire are Knight or Dame Grand Cross, and Knight or Dame Commander. The honours are awarded to members who have made major contributions to any activity, usually at national level.\n\nC.B.E. (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) –the highest-ranking Order of the British Empire honour (excluding a knighthood/damehood), awarded to individuals who have a prominent role at national level, or a leading role at regional level, for distinguished and innovative contribution in any area.\n\nO.B.E.(Officer of the Order of the British Empire) –awarded to individuals who have made major contributions at a local level, or whose work has gained a national profile.\n\nM.B.E.(Member of the Order of the British Empire) –awarded for an outstanding achievement or service to the community which has had a long-term, significant impact.\n\nBritish Empire Medal (B.E.M.) – awarded for a 'hands-on' service to the local community. This could be a long-term charitable or voluntary activity, or innovative work of a relatively short duration (3 to 4 years) that has made a significant difference.\n\nRoyal Victorian Order (R.V.O.) – an award given by the monarch usually to people who have helped personally, such as members of the Royal household staff or British ambassadors.\n\nNew Year and Birthday Honours\n\nCommonwealth honours\n\nCitizens of all 15 commonwealth realms may also receive honours through the UK honours system. Countries who can publish Birthday and New Year Honours lists include:\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\n\nAustralia\n\nBahamas\n\nBelize\n\nCanada\n\nCook Islands\n\nGrenada\n\nJamaica\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nSt Christopher and Nevis\n\nSaint Lucia\n\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nSolomon Islands\n\nTuvalu\n\nCommonwealth New Year and Birthday Honours\n\nOther honours and awards\n\nAlongside the Birthday and New Year Honours, a range of other honours lists are published in supplements to The Gazette, including:\n\nThe Queen's Award for Voluntary Service (annually) – recognises exceptional work done by volunteer groups in their communities.\n\nThe Queen's Awards for Enterprise (annually) – recognises UK businesses with outstanding achievements in the fields of innovation, international trade, sustainable development and promoting opportunity (through social mobility).\n\nDissolution Honours – a list of people nominated to receive honours after the Dissolution of Parliament prior to a general election.\n\nPrime Minister's Resignation Honours – honours granted at the behest of an outgoing UK Prime Minister following his/her resignation.\n\nOther honours detailed in supplements, and published on behalf of the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, include:\n\nmilitary and civilian gallantry\n\noperational honours for the armed forces\n\nImperial Service Medal\n\nPolar Medal\n\nSearch awards and honours\n\nMilitary achievements\n\nThe Gazette is the official bearer of War Office and Ministry of Defence (MOD) events. For hundreds of years The Gazette has been publishing honours and awards for gallantry and meritorious service in the armed forces, from the Crimean War to World War 1 and World War 2, making it a key resource for researchers and historians.\n\nToday, military personnel are gazetted in weekly Ministry of Defence supplements, which are published in The London Gazette every Tuesday. These supplements include commissions, appointments and medals for the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force.\n\nBrowse publications\n\nMentioned in despatches\n\nA soldier who has been mentioned in despatches (MiD) is someone who has appeared in an official report written by a superior officer, which had then been sent on to the War Office. The report would have described the gallant or meritorious action that the subject had taken in the face of the enemy.\n\nDespatches in the British armed forces were published in The Gazette. A mention would usually cite the person’s name, rank, number and regiment/unit. However, text explaining the reason why an individual was chosen is uncommon.\n\nYou can view all World War 1 despatches and World War 2 despatches on The Gazette website.\n\nSearch for soldiers\n\nCelebrate your honour with a commemorative edition\n\nIf you or a loved one have been honoured by the Queen or mentioned in despatches, The Gazette is available to buy as a personalised commemorative edition. Each pack contains a complete edition of The Gazette from the day the honour was published."
