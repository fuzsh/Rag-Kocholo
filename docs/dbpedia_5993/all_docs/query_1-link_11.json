        "text": "1. 9/24/2010 To whom it may concern: This letter comes as a recommendation for Tony Jones. Tony and I were employed by Alcoa Composites in Monrovia California during the period of 1988-1996. During this period, Tony was the Business Unit Controller and Director of Administration. I was the Manager of Business Development and had been with the company 25 years when Tony arrived. I had experienced a number of Controllers before Tony arrived. He was definitely a breath of fresh air for the company. You could immediately tell that Tony was going to be a real benefit to the company, which needed help, by the way he approached problems with solutions. With his personality and positive thinking, He was readily accepted by the management team as a leader. As the Marketing Manager, I realized that our company cost structure was higher than what our competitors were experiencing and we were losing business. Alcoa Composites was known in the industry as a high quality high cost company. Tony accepted the challenge to reduce overall product cost and reviewed our cost structure. He presented to the management team a new concept “lean methods” for reducing product manufacturing hours and ways that overhead could be reduced. With Tony’s leadership, we implemented lean processes on specific programs there-by reducing direct labor hours and were able to cut overhead cost by consolidating various operation and departments. We realized these saving on future proposals which made us competitive. This was a Marketing Managers dream. This type of leadership continued through Tony’s eight year tenure at Alcoa Composites. When Tony started with the company, computers were a relatively new unknown tool. Tony took it upon himself to become computer savvy and introduced the computer to ALC. He used this “new” technology to revolutionize the accounts payable and receivable department. Once that was underway, he developed systems for the inventory control and purchasing personnel. He was keeping ALC up with technology. Remember this was before IT was invented. Tony and Debbie, Tony’s wife, are proud parents of a daughter and two sons. They have raised them as outstanding students in the community. They are all in universities and all three will be a benefit to society when they graduate.
