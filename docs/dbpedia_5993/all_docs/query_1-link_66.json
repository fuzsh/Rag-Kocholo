        "text": "Mark Maggiori: Lightning Strike\n\nCourtesy of Southwest Art July 16, 2018\n\nby Norman Klopas\n\nTwo bone-tired young cowboys descend a cactus-studded slope toward an iconic western landscape of red-rock pinnacles and winding canyons. They are not so much riding their horses as being patiently borne by them. Massive storm clouds billow behind them, threatening a downpour that may arrive before the men reach their destination.\n\nThis majestic 5-foot-wide painting by Mark Maggiori, titled WEST SIDE OF THE RIO GRANDE, so impressed the judges at this year’s Masters of the American West show at the Autry Museum that it received the Don B. Huntley Spirit of the West Award as the most outstanding work in cowboy subject matter. Despite the acclaim Maggiori has been earning recently, that recognition was surprising for multiple reasons: Not only was it the artist’s Autry debut, but he is also a relative newcomer to American western subjects. The 41-year-old is a Frenchman who, until a moment of revelation and a leap of faith less than five years ago, had never considered painting cowboys.\n\n“I took a chance back then,” says Maggiori. “This was something I had to do.”\n\nMaggiori’s background may not have clearly predicted his future calling or phenomenal success. But it’s possible nonetheless to trace subtle indicators of the painter he is today.\n\n“I guess I was pretty good at drawing at a young age,” he reflects. “When my mother picked me up my first day of kindergarten, the teacher had put my drawing on the classroom wall. I don’t remember what it was, but the teacher told my mom I was very good.” That classroom was in his hometown of Fontainebleau, southeast of Paris, where Maggiori grew up as the middle of three\n\nchildren of Robert, a philosophy professor and author, and Helen, who taught French, Latin, and Greek. Early in his school years, he enjoyed drawing at home, filling sketchbooks with pictures of robots and spaceships. His parents, however, “wanted me to have a real job,” urging him toward more academic pursuits.\n\n“But I wasn’t really good at school,” Maggiori continues, laughingly explaining that his “monomaniacal” nature led to obsessions first with playing soccer, starting at the age of 7, and then, by his mid-teens, with skateboarding. That pursuit, in turn, fostered a fascination with America, particularly the skateboarding culture of Los Angeles.\n\nDuring the summer of his 15th year, Maggiori gained his first up-close-and-personal experience of America when his uncle Claude, a successful magazine and newspaper art director, took him and Mark’s 15-year-old cousin Leon on a summer road trip from New York to San Francisco, with stops along the way at western landmarks. “That month changed my life,” he says, “implanting America in my brain.”\n\nWhen the time came for college, however, young Mark still wasn’t sure of his goals. He enrolled in some history classes at the Sorbonne but dropped them within a month. By then, he had picked up the guitar, “and I just wanted to make music with my friends and hang out with girls,” he says. Finally, in 1997, his uncle convinced him to try classes at the Academie Julian, a venerable private art school in Paris. “That was life-changing for me,” Maggiori recalls. “All of a sudden, my world opened to so many options and possibilities.”\n\nNow a committed student, he stayed in art school for the full four-year course. Along the way he gained experience in animation, interning at the Paris studios of Disney, where he was involved in the 1999 film Tarzan. “I had dreadlocks at the time, and so did Tarzan, so the main animator used me as a model to see how the dreadlocks moved,” he says.\n\nUpon graduation, Disney offered him a job at its California headquarters. By then, however, another passion had, quite literally, taken center stage. In 1997, Maggiori and his friends had formed a band called Pleymo, writing and performing “numetal,” combining heavy metal with other genres including hip-hop and grunge. After releasing their first album in 1999, they signed with Sony Music in 2000. By the time their second of four albums came out in 2002, they had begun playing at festivals across Europe and Japan, with Maggiori as lead vocalist. At the same time, he had also begun a compatible career directing music videos. So, he says, “the idea of being stuck in an animation studio somewhere in Burbank wasn’t appealing to me anymore.”\n\nEventually, the Pleymo years ended, with the band going on hiatus in 2007. (This summer, however, they’ve reunited for a 20th-anniversary tour in Europe.) Maggiori continued to direct music videos, while exploring opportunities to helm documentaries and feature films. In 2011, he moved to Los Angeles, where he met and fell in love with multimedia artist and creative director Petecia Le Fawnhawk, whom he married in 2012. And he developed a particular interest in rural America. “Every time I had a little money,” he says, “I’d go somewhere like Texas or Louisiana and take photos of Americana,” he says. “And that’s how I discovered rodeos.”\n\nThat interest led him, in late 2013, to take photos at the International Finals Rodeo in Oklahoma City. His father-in-law suggested he check out the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum while he was there. So Maggiori did, and his first encounter with its collection of historic and contemporary western art, much of it produced by participants in its annual Prix de West Invitational, was revelatory. “It was like I was struck by lightning—the storytelling, the American myth, the lighting, the clothing, everything about the cowboys in those paintings!” he remembers. He left with one laser-focused goal: “This is something I want to do.”\n\nBack home, he began researching the market, which included reading Southwest Art. “I realized there was a whole western art scene. I wanted to be part of it.” So, he says, “I took a big step into unknown territory.” He and Petecia moved to her mother’s house in Kingman, AZ, and, with the same kind of monomaniacal dedication he’d always shown, Maggiori began painting in a backyard shack.\n\nSeeking to jumpstart his new career, he posted his early efforts on Instagram, and his following boomed (today it exceeds 65,000). That quickly led to a connection with successful western artist Logan Maxwell Hagege, who invited Maggiori to meet at the respected Maxwell Alexander Gallery in Los Angeles, directed and owned by his brother, Beau Alexander. “I put simple wood frames on four of my paintings, loaded them in my car, and drove from Kingman to LA,” Maggiori remembers.\n\n“Logan and Beau welcomed me, we talked, and Beau put my paintings on the wall for 10 minutes.” And then, to Maggiori’s astonishment, Alexander bought all four works. “Soon after that,” he adds, “I heard that Bruno Mars had bought one of those paintings.” Another top western gallery, Gerald Peters Gallery in Santa Fe, signed him on a few months later. By October 2015, a painting by Maggiori landed on the cover of Southwest Art.\n\nHis successes continued mounting quickly: the Patron’s Choice Award in his first big event, the 2016 Night of Artists show at the Briscoe Western Art Museum in San Antonio; the Sam Houston Award for Painting at the same show the following year; and now, this year, his major recognition at the Autry.\n\nThese days Maggiori immerses himself in a field and subject matter that feel as if they’ve chosen him. While painting, he incessantly listens to audiobooks about the West. “I’m actually catching up big-time with American history, and the more I listen, the more I get ideas,” he says. Meanwhile, he continues to travel the West, gathering landscape photos and often meeting up with other artists for organized photo sessions with Indians wearing authentic garb.\n\nBack in his studio, he says, “I go through my photos and start sketching.” His experience as a director and animator has made him especially adept with Photoshop, which he uses to refine his designs before heading to the canvas. Using a pencil or charcoal, he’ll quickly transcribe the composition. “And then I start painting, with most works taking two to three weeks to completion, including drying time,” he adds. Maggiori pays particular attention to rendering his clouds, which have won him special praise for their luminous realism. “Like a chef usually doesn’t invite you into the kitchen, I don’t want to tell how I do it,” he laughs, revealing only that he uses “a little bristle brush” and spends “hours blending all the colors to make a cloud look smooth and fresh.”\n\nThat attention to detail reached new heights in another work Maggiori exhibited at this year’s Autry show, THE CROSSING. Depicting a wagon train fording a river in a mountain valley fringed by snowcapped peaks, the stirring scene tried the artist’s own seemingly boundless patience and focus. “After I finished the mountains, I had to put the whole bottom part aside for maybe two months,” he says. “Then, one morning, I told myself to just do it, step by step, like climbing a gigantic staircase. It took me maybe three weeks of long, hard, sweaty days and lots of coffee. But it was one of those epic paintings I want to do once in a while.”\n\nHis ultimate goal is to please and reward his ever-growing audience. “It’s encouraging for me to see the thousands of followers I have on Instagram now, who write to me every day. That’s amazing, and it makes me feel so good,” he reflects. He feels he best serves both himself and his fans by “never being boring, and never being bored. I always want to stay excited and to be able to put my excitement for the West into my paintings.”\n\nFor more work by Mark Maggiori, click here.\n\nSky Sonnets\n\nMaxwell Alexander Gallery is hosting a group exhibition titled Cumulus starting March 9 and continuing through the month. The show highlights cloud- centric works featuring brand new paintings by Tony Abeyta, Eric Bowman, Scott Burdick, Glenn Dean, Phil Epp, Danny Galieote, Logan Maxwell Hagege, Bryan Haynes, Brett Allen Johnson, Michael Klein, Ed Mell, Eric Merrell, John Moyers, Terri Kelly Moyers, Dennis Ziemienski and others.\n\nBowman’s submission, Levels and Degrees, was inspired by the artist’s recent work done on a trip to southern Utah. “The monumental land formations there are really amazing in both size and shape, and support the focal subject and vertical design of the large clouds in this composition,” says Bowman. “They give it more of an overall large-scale, heroic feel. I also wanted to show the juxtaposition of land masses that are eons old, surrounded by vaporous entities that were just born that very morning.” Using textured layers of paint to forge out a depth and sense of scale, Bowman distills the sensation of wonder and awe when surrounded by such grand natural scenes. “I like to idealize the flow of the line, and clouds that allow just that. They come in all shapes and sizes, so I was able to not only create the scale and shape I wanted, but also build texture upon texture by allowing drying time in between painting sessions.”\n\nInspiration for Ziemienski’s piece Regarding the Trail came while exploring the majestic red rocks of northern Arizona and New Mexico. “What I found to be most exciting was the mysterious light and shadow of the rocks inspiring a balance with the dramatic upheaval of the clouds—a world where you can lose yourself,” the artist says. Evoking an almost surreal sense of place, the painting’s small subjects stroll beneath a massive cloud, which looms over the canyons with an opposing, yet awe-inspiring, presence\n\nTranquil and serene, Epp’s Hilltop Trio captures a restful moment between a small team of wild horses as they gaze at a distant horizon. “I have the privilege of living near large ranches that house large groups of horses,” says Epp. “Horses on a hilltop with a big sky backdrop is something that I personally observe on a weekly basis. I’m always inspired by the view and the painting subject.” Epp’s passion for sprawling sky scenes is particularly apparent in this recent work, with bright, vivid blues and buoyant whites dominating the landscape. “This painting is more about western scale, open space and distance than it is about horses,” he explains.\n\nBurdick’s Grandma’s Clouds tells the story of a girl and her family from Shawnee, Oklahoma. Last year, the artist visited his painting’s subject, Serena, at her grandmother’s house to do a series of drawings of her and her relatives. Serena, who is half Choctaw and half Ponca, offered the opportunity to capture this scene. “In between drawing sessions, we would go outside on the ranch and take photographs, which are what I did this painting from when I got home to my North Carolina studio after the show.” From his references, Burdick set out to build a sense of communion between land and sky. “For this painting, I wanted to create a dynamic composition where Serena was an integrated part of the landscape and the clouds. My hope was that the varied angles in the grasses, plus the thick application of paint, would create a sense of movement in the scene. I wanted the abstract chaos of the grass to act as counterpoint to the refined painting of Serena’s face and the soft serenity of the sky. The fact that she was looking into the distance beyond the frame of the canvas hopefully creates a bit of mystery for the viewer to wonder about.”\n\nThe Cumulus group exhibition will open March 9 at Maxwell Alexander Gallery in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFor more work from Cumulus, click here.\n\nAs artists, Jeremy Mann and Joseph Todorovitch figurative artist Todorovitch has been challenging are constantly finding new ways to challenge their himself by working more intuitively. “I’m trying to artistic processes; to push their paint application and mark making to new limits, allowing for exploration in each composition. This goes beyond the subjects they paint and speaks directly to their techniques.\n\nMann, who paints both figures and cityscapes, says, “If I don’t push myself further in my paintings, I’ll sink in the mud, both a physical challenge and also a mental hurdle. The best medicine to encourage this growth is travel and experience, with a healthy dose of long, thoughtful showers and bravery. To have the guts to try new techniques, approaches, watch new strange films, research photographers, draw from life, try different old cameras and lighting situations, new palettes of colors…a plethora of ways to add more garbage to the compost pile and grow something different.”\n\nEchoing the idea of growth in his paintings, explore more with the paint application and at the same time balance a very strong sense of control, which is counterintuitive,” he says. “I really do crave control, but at the same time, I want it interesting and to be more willing to explore paint application and step outside my comfort zone—sometimes step outside a lot depending on what the painting allows.”\n\nMarch 12 to April 2, the artists will exhibit in a two- man show at Maxwell Alexander Gallery in Culver City, California. On display will be brand-new works that highlight their signature subjects as well as show artistic evolutions.\n\nIncluded among the pieces by Mann is the cityscape NYC #20, which features a harmonious color palette— something that appears in many of his paintings. Mann explains, “Color palette should always be harmonized, it references the light and color when the city is bathed\n\nin the atmosphere of twilight, artificial light or daylight. I believe that a control of an artist’s color palette is one of the most difficult things to handle, but also one of the most exciting when you’re on point. Having conditioned my approach, my monitors, my film references and my palette to reflect this desire, I leave finesse for my brain to conduct with when painting in the studio.”\n\nOne of Todorovitch’s paintings in the show is Comet, depicting a woman in a red dress standing in a clothing store. “I was working with the model, and based on what she had brought to work with in terms of wardrobe, I thought it’d be really fun to counter that with something that was more textural—a background that has a lot of activity, and was very active against the simple red dress,”\n\nsays Todorovitch. He adds that when working with models, “I like to just get the model in the environment and start moving around—play with color, shapes, value and simple picture-making ideas until it starts to feel right. I’m trying to work intuitively more and more, and not overthink the process…” and viewers will see juxtapositions such as a “highly rendered face next to something abstract.”\n\nTodorovitch also has noticed a common thread of perception in his new works. “Obviously I’m concerned about the visual experience we construct from nature about our reality with all the wonderful and clever ways we use paint to represent that. But also, perhaps more subconsciously, the perception of the subject and viewer experience,” Todorovitch says. “How the subject perceives being viewed and how we view the subject has naturally become a part of the process working with friends, family and strangers. I wouldn’t object to the use of particular staging and objects adding a deeper layer of psychology to the paintings so long as it isn’t focused… This also presents opportunities to demonstrate intricate painting skill. All very important to me.”"
