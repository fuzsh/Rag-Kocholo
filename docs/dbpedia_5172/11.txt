This would suggest that she is outgoing and action-oriented, with a preference for practical solutions rather than theorizing. Her focus on issues such as crime and immigration could reflect her concern for social order and practical problem-solving. Her tendency to speak bluntly and directly may also indicate a preference for bold, decisive action over subtlety or diplomacy. However, it is important to note that without assessing Frevert's personality directly using a verified test, we cannot know her true MBTI profile. Additionally, it is also possible that her public behavior is influenced by external factors such as political pressures, and may not reflect her true personality in every aspect. In conclusion, while there are indications that Frevert's personality may align with the ESTP type, it is impossible to say with certainty based solely on her public persona. Any analysis of MBTI types must be understood as a rough guideline rather than a definitive diagnosis.
