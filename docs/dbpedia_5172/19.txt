Concerning P. S. N. (represented by counsel, the Documentation and Advisory Centre on Racial Discrimination) vs Denmark for violation of articles 2, 4 and 6 of CERD.

Ms. Louise Frevert, a Member of Parliament for the Danish People’s Party, published statements against immigration and Muslims on her website. She also published similar statements in a book and upheld them in an interview with the Danish newspaper “Politiken”.

The DACoRD, on the petitioner’s behalf, filed three complaints against Ms. Frevert. The first was regarding the website, the second regarding the book and the third regarding the interview. DACoRD claimed that these statements were directed against a specific group of people (Muslims), that they were taunting and degrading, and that they had a propagandistic character.
