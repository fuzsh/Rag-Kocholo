        "text": "Sheena Hamilton and Steven Harmon were recently appointed to The Missouri Bar’s roster of delegates for the American Bar Association House of Delegates.\n\nThe House of Delegates serves as the policy-making body of the American Bar Association and is composed of legal professionals from local and state bars from around the country.\n\nAt its December 2021 meeting, The Board of Governors appointed Sheena Hamilton as an at-large delegate for the ABA House of Delegates. She replaced P. John Brady, whose term expired in August 2021.\n\nHamilton is the city counselor of St. Louis and serves on the ABA’s Standing Committee on Membership and its Executive Committee for the Lawyers Conference of the Judicial Division. She recently served as a young lawyer member-at-large on the ABA Board of Governors and in the ABA Young Lawyers Division. Hamilton has also held several leadership positions with The Missouri Bar, the Mound City Bar Association, and the Women Lawyers Association of Greater St. Louis.\n\nHamilton graduated from Saint Louis University School of Law and joined The Missouri Bar in 2010.\n\n“Having recently served on the ABA Board of Governors, I have familiarity with our recent leadership and the most pressing issues the association faces,” Hamilton said in her application letter. “My time on the board and the YLD Executive Committee has afforded me this familiarity. My time on (the Standing Committee on Membership) will provide a deeper understanding of what I view as our most important challenge, membership, for the ABA.”\n\nThe Board of Governors also appointed Steven Harmon as the diversity delegate for the ABA House of Delegates. He replaced Jose Caldera, whose term expired in August 2021.\n\nHarmon is the vice president of human resources, equity & inclusion, and compliance at Affinia Healthcare in St. Louis. He serves as the immediate past president of the Mound City Bar Association and as a member of the Supreme Court of Missouri Disciplinary Committee for Division 2 of Region XI. He graduated from Saint Louis University School of Law and joined The Missouri Bar in 2005.\n\nHarmon said he is honored the Board of Governors appointed him to the ABA House of Delegates.\n\n“I know the value and strength that diversity in leadership can bring to an association of persons from different backgrounds, ethnicity, orientations, and beliefs,” he said. “I look forward to serving The Missouri Bar and the ABA.”\n\nHamilton’s and Harmon’s terms will end in August 2023."
