It is best for detecting MSK, thyroid, breast, GYN, and urology. üîπPoint Shear Wave Elastography shows the objectively quantified stiffness of tissue using the radiation force from a focused ultrasound beam. Users can identify significant liver fibrosis non-invasively. acoustic radiofrequency force impulse üîπShear Wave Elastography provides a quantitative assessment for chronic liver disease and suspicious nodules of the thyroid and breast. The reliable and reproducible result of SWE helps to increase diagnostic confidence. #ALPINION #ultrasound #elastography #liver #breast #musculoskeletal\n\nThe challenge of diagnosing cleft palate (CP) prenatally is well-recognized. The objective of the current study was to explore if the width of the prenatal alveolar cleft might be linked to the likelihood of a secondary palate cleft in cases of unilateral cleft lip (CL). To achieve this, the authors analyzed two-dimensional ultrasound (US) images of fetuses with unilateral CL from January 2012 to February 2016.\n\nBreast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide, with the standard surgical treatment being lumpectomy, in which the tumour is removed from the breast while sparing as much healthy tissue as possible. However, limitations in surgical navigation often means additional surgeries are required.üíâ A team of scientists at Queen‚Äôs University have developed a state-of-the-art surgical navigation system using ultrasound, electromagnetic tracking, and proprietary software to improve spatial awareness in lumpectomy surgery. As a result, fewer additional surgeries will be required, reducing healthcare costs and trauma to the patient, whilst also improving cosmetic outcomes.ü§ó #medicaljobs #HealthcareJobs #MedicalCareer #vacancies #medicalfield #medicalstaff #recruitment #healthcare #MedicalRecruitment #technologies #medicaltechnology #breastcancer #lumpectomy\n\nThe first successful human organ transplant was a kidney transplant performed on December 23, 1954, by Dr. Joseph Murray and his team at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. The groundbreaking surgery was conducted between identical twins, Ronald and Richard Herrick, to eliminate the issue of organ rejection. Ronald donated one of his kidneys to his brother Richard, who was suffering from chronic kidney failure. The success of this operation marked a major milestone in medical history, paving the way for modern organ transplantation. Dr. Murray's innovative work in transplantation earned him the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1990. This successful transplant not only saved Richard Herrick's life but also opened the door to the development of immunosuppressive drugs, allowing transplants between non-identical individuals.

In 2013, papers were published questioning whether #neuroendovascular surgery was DEAD! In 2004, #neurocritical care was struggling to survive as a discipline. Today, both have become integral and fundamental components of what a comprehensive stroke center is and healthcare. The field survived and thrived because pioneers pushed forward. This article‚Äîwith my brother @stephanmayer‚Äîdescribes the battle and rationale for why neuroendovascular surgery and NCC are now the heartbeat of every CSC, capturing the evolution of these fields and highlighting how they have become essential to comprehensive stroke centers today. Our latest in the #FOAMed SVIN - Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology American Heart Association Stroke:Vascular and Interventional Neurology- Unpacking the 2023 American Heart Association Guidelines: The Ascendancy of Neuroendovascular and Neurocritical Care in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Management https://lnkd.in/ee4j8WS8 #OpenAccess #subarachnoidhemorrhage #noSAHleftbehind\n\nUnpacking the 2023 American Heart Association Guidelines: The Ascendancy of Neuroendovascular and Neurocritical Care in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Management Fawaz Al-Mufti, MD ; Stephan Mayer, MD Excellent review!! -The updated guidelines for managing aSAH emphasize the importance of personalized treatment strategies that consider the unique characteristics of each aneurysm. -treating the ruptured aneurysm as early as possible after presentation, preferably within 24 hours, is strongly recommended. -there is substantial evidence to suggest that electrographic seizure activity can significantly impact the patient‚Äôs level of consciousness and exacerbate secondary brain injury.\n\nFeatured Post: Global Surgical Expedition With five billion people in need of basic surgical care, how do we make the biggest impact? Global Surgical Expedition believes strongly in the need to perform research so that we can deliver efforts that are sustainable and carry the most impact and value. Our recent research project sought to understand the economic impact of urologic disease in Belize. We found that, on average, patients reported a loss of 12% of their income due to related disability or physician appointments. Can you imagine losing 12% of your annual income because you cannot access simple surgery to cure your illness? Providing surgical care can not only change someone's health but also the financial health of a patient and their family. We were able to identify the surgeries that provided the biggest improvement to a patient's income so that we could focus our efforts on these surgeries.
