        "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nBroadening participation in computer science for women and underrepresented minority students remains an area of concern for many colleges and universities. Yet, little is known about the role of department chairs in initiating and leading efforts to recruit and retain women and students of color. Interviews with 15 department chairs participating in a nationwide effort to diversify computer science provide greater understanding about the change process and reveal insights about the barriers to and challenges in broadening participation. The findings illuminate the ways that department chairs grapple with both internal and external factors that impact their ability to diversify their departments."
