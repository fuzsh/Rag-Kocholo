        "text": "Dylan Charles Stone of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, passed away peacefully at MUSC Health University Medical Center on Friday, October 14, 2022, at the age of 28.\n\nBorn August 4, 1994, in Reston, Virginia, (or as Dylan would have written, “A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…) Dylan was the son of Kimberly and Ed Calderon, and Luke Michel.\n\nThroughout his life, Dylan easily won the hearts of nearly everyone he met. He had a warm demeanor and a friendly vibe that made others happy to help him out anytime he asked.\n\nHis family and his friends had his unwavering devotion. He was entertaining and funny and one of the most approachable people you could ever meet.\n\nHe especially loved spending time with his loved ones. His quick wit, happy-go-lucky attitude, and infectious grin made everyone he connected with feel better and his family absolutely adored him for it.\n\nHe was a huge sports fan and a die-hard supporter of the Washington Capitals, and the Florida State Seminoles, and he never wavered in his allegiance to his hometown NFL team, the Washington whatever they’re called these days.\n\nHe developed a lifelong passion for and expertise in constructing and collecting intricate lego sets, especially anything Star Wars related. He was a creative chef who approached food with the same whimsey and fun as he did most things in life.\n\nHe was a major movie buff who never missed the opportunity to catch the latest horror flick or hilarious comedy film and could often be heard laughing out loud to himself while binge-watching shows like Sponge Bob, The Family Guy, or Bob’s Burgers on Comedy Central.\n\nOne of his favorite past-times was listening to music. Dylan’s interests ranged from Mac Miller to Chicago to Cage the Elephant and over time he developed an impressive knowledge base of songs and artists from almost every genre.\n\nBorn with a fighter’s spirit and the soul of a champion, Dylan always found a way to make the most out of difficult situations. Despite all the health issues he faced throughout his precious 28 years, he always looked on the bright side of life and he never let go of his “get knocked down 7 times, get back up 8” mentality.\n\nThis was most recently evident last month when he proudly celebrated over 500 days of sobriety.\n\nDylan’s most courageous and selfless gesture was his priceless gift of organ donation. He donated 6 of his major organs, saving the lives of 4 individuals that will have a long-lasting\n\nimpact on those families for generations to come. He is leaving behind a beautiful legacy.\n\nDylan is preceded in death by his grandfather Charles M. Stone, Jr., and his grandmothers Maria Calderon and Christy Frevert.\n\nHe is survived by his parents Kimberly and Ed Calderon, two sisters Lilly and Maya Calderon, grandmother Louise Stone, and grandfather Eduardo Calderon of Mt. Pleasant, S.C., his father Luke Michel (Kate), his two sisters Paolina and Lucia Michel, his two brothers James and Miles Michel of Carlsbad, California, his grandfather Dominic Michel of Manhattan, New York, in addition to many aunts, uncles, cousins, and extended family members.\n\nA celebration of Dylan’s life and extraordinary legacy will be held in the upcoming months and details will be shared once arrangements have been made.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial donations be made to Sharing Hope SC at https://sharinghopesc.org/.\n\nTo help honor Dylan and preserve his legacy, we respectfully ask that anyone whose life has been touched by his passing consider registering to become an organ donor, so they can offer others hope and the opportunity for a brighter future.\n\nExpressions of sympathy may be viewed or submitted online at mcalister-smith.com.\n\n“Success”\n\nTo laugh often and much, to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends, to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.\n\nThis is to have succeeded!"
