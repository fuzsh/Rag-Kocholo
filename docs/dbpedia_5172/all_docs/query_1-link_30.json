The majority national languages of the region, and their many dialects, belong to the Scandinavian dialect continuum, and are mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.[4] The term Scandinavia in local usage covers the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. However, in English usage, the term also sometimes refers to the Scandinavian Peninsula, or to the broader region including Finland and Iceland, which is always known locally as the Nordic countries.[1][5]\n\nWhile part of the Nordic countries, the remote Norwegian islands of Svalbard and Jan Mayen are not in Scandinavia, nor is Greenland, a constituent country within the Kingdom of Denmark.

According to some historians, it was adopted and introduced in the eighteenth century, at a time when the ideas about a common heritage started to appear and develop into early literary and linguistic Scandinavism.[7] Before this time, the term \"Scandinavia\" was familiar mainly to classical scholars through Pliny the Elder's writings and was used vaguely for Scania and the southern region of the peninsula.[7]\n\nAs a political term, Scandinavia was first used by students agitating for pan-Scandinavianism in the 1830s.[7] The popular usage of the term in Sweden, Denmark and Norway as a unifying concept became established in the nineteenth century through poems such as Hans Christian Andersen's \"I am a Scandinavian\" of 1839. After a visit to Sweden, Andersen became a supporter of early political Scandinavism. In a letter describing the poem to a friend, he wrote: \"All at once I understood how related the Swedes, the Danes and the Norwegians are, and with this feeling I wrote the poem immediately after my return: 'We are one people, we are called Scandinavians!'\".[13]\n\nThe clearest example of the use of Scandinavia is Finland, based largely on the fact that most of modern-day Finland was part of the Swedish kingdom for hundreds of years, thus to much of the world associating Finland with all of Scandinavia.

After a visit to Sweden, Andersen became a supporter of early political Scandinavism. In a letter describing the poem to a friend, he wrote: \"All at once I understood how related the Swedes, the Danes and the Norwegians are, and with this feeling I wrote the poem immediately after my return: 'We are one people, we are called Scandinavians!'\".[13]\n\nThe clearest example of the use of Scandinavia is Finland, based largely on the fact that most of modern-day Finland was part of the Swedish kingdom for hundreds of years, thus to much of the world associating Finland with all of Scandinavia. However, the creation of a Finnish identity is unique in the region in that it was formed in relation to two different imperial models, the Swedish[14] and the Russian,[15][16] as described by the University of Jyväskylä based editorial board of the Finnish journal Yearbook of Political Thought and Conceptual History.[17][18]\n\nArea 928,057 km2\n\n(358,325 sq mi)\n\nPopulation ~21 million (2017)[citation needed]\n\nPopulation density 22.7/km2 (58.7/sq mi)\n\nDemonym Scandinavian\n\nCountries Denmark\n\nNorway\n\nSweden\n\nSometimes also:[1]\n\nFinland\n\nIceland\n\nFaroe Islands\n\nÅland Islands\n\nLanguages\n\nDanish\n\nNorwegian\n\nSwedish\n\nFinnish\n\nIcelandic\n\nFaroese[2][3]\n\nRegional languages:\n\nGerman\n\nKven\n\nMeänkieli\n\nRomani\n\nSami\n\nYiddish[2][3]\n\nNordic countries\n\nNorden (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish)\n\nPohjoismaat (Finnish)\n\nNorðurlöndin (Icelandic)\n\nNorðurlond (Faroese)\n\nNunat Avannarliit (Greenlandic)\n\nDavveriikkat (Northern Sami)\n\nLocation of the Nordic countries\n\nLocation of the Nordic countries\n\nCapitals\n\n8 cities[hide]\n\nDenmark Copenhagen\n\nFaroe Islands Tórshavn\n\nGreenland Nuuk\n\nFinland Helsinki\n\nÅland Islands Mariehamn\n\nIceland Reykjavík\n\nNorway Oslo\n\nSweden Stockholm\n\nLanguages\n\n18 languages[hide]\n\nDenmarkDanish\n\nFaroe IslandsFaroese\n\nFinlandFinnish\n\nGreenlandGreenlandic\n\nIcelandIcelandic\n\nMeänkieli\n\nNorwayNorwegian\n\nSápmi (area)Southern Sami, Ume Sami, Pite Sami, Lule Sami, Northern Sami, Skolt Sami, Akkala Sami\n\nSwedenSwedish\n\nGotlandGutnish\n\nKven\n\nComposition\n\n8 states and\n\nterritories[hide]\n\n5 sovereign countries\n\nDenmark\n\nFinland\n\nIceland\n\nNorway\n\nSweden\n\n3 dependent countries\n\nÅland Islands\n\nFaroe Islands\n\nGreenland\n\nArea\n\n• Total\n\n3,425,804 km2 (1,322,710 sq mi) (7th)\n\nPopulation\n\n• 2017 estimate\n\n27,056,092 (49th)\n\n• 2000 census\n\n25,478.559\n\n• Density\n\n7.62/km2 (19.7/sq mi) (225th)\n\nGDP (PPP) 2017 estimate\n\n• Total\n\n$1.117 trillion (17th)\n\n• Per capita\n\n$52,688 (6th)\n\nGDP (nominal) 2016 estimate\n\n• Total\n\n$1.454 trillion (11th)\n\n• Per capita\n\n$54,052 (7th)\n\nCurrency\n\n5 currencies[show]\n\nThe Nordic countries or the Nordics[1] are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (literally \"the North\").[2] The term includes Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including Greenland and Faroe Islands—which are both part of the Kingdom of Denmark—and the Åland Islands.[3] Scandinavians comprise over three quarters of the region's population and is thus the largest group by far, followed by Finns, who comprise the majority in Finland; other groups are indigenous minorities such as the Greenlandic Inuit and the Sami people, and recent immigrants and their descendants. The native languages are Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and Faroese, all North Germanic languages rooted in Old Norse. Native non-Germanic languages are Finnish, Greenlandic and several Sami languages. The main religion is Lutheran Christianity. The Nordic countries have much in common in their way of life, history, religion, their use of Scandinavian languages and social structure. The Nordic countries have a long history of political unions and other close relations, but do not form a separate entity today. The Scandinavist movement sought to unite Denmark, Norway and Sweden into one country in the 19th century and this movement later evolved[citation needed] into the modern organised Nordic cooperation which includes the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers. Especially in English, Scandinavia is sometimes used as a synonym for the Nordic countries, but that term more properly refers to the three monarchies of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Geologically, the Scandinavian Peninsula comprises the mainland of Norway and Sweden as well as the northernmost part of Finland.[4]\n\ncaroline wozniacki! cumbussable\n\nGood post!"
