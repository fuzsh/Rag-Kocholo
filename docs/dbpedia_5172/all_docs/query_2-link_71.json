        "text": "41st Annual Manhattan Invitational Boys Eastern States Championship Race Preview\n\nSaturday, October 12, 2013 --- Van Cortlandt Park --- 2:15 PM\n\nOverview\n\nThe 6th running of the Boys Eastern States race at the Manhattan Invitational is about to go into stampede mode. Thirty-three teams in the race are coming to the Manhattan, and they'll be running in the Manhattan, but the question is, can they conquer the Manhattan? Only the turtle-and-the hare statue knows for sure, and it ain't telling until around 2:30 on Saturday.\n\nTrying to ride herd on the stampeders amongst carnage and mayhem at Van Cortlandt Park and get their fourth Eastern States title are the two-time reigning champ Colts from Christian Brothers Academy of Lincroft, NJ, the top-ranked team in the nation. Lining up for a chance to become the new world-beating conquerors will be most prominently the Warriors of West Chester Henderson (PA), the Hornets of Fayetteville-Manlius (NY), a second band of Warriors from Liverpool (NY), and the Ironmen from Don Bosco Prep (NJ). Adding more destructive force are two teams with the credentials to very possibly bust into the US top-25 rankings, the Sea Kings who've sailed in from Palos Verdes (CA) and another Hornet hive from Tatnall (DE). NY, NJ, and RI especially are all doing Manhattan up big, with most of the top teams in those states coming in to settle up accounts in one of the day's races.\n\nLast year Edward Cheserek of St. Benedict's (NJ) again plunged below the 12 minute barrier, though he fell a little short of his course record while holding off NY's top runner, Nick Ryan of Fayetteville-Manlius. With Cheserek and Ryan graduated, the battle for the individual title at Eastern States will pull in a pack of guys that include Mickey Burke of Rush-Henrietta (NY), Kyle Levermore of Don Bosco Prep, Mike McClemens, Blaise Ferro, and Tom Rooney of CBA-Lincroft, Bryce Millar and Andrew Berge of Fayetteville-Manlius, Tom O'Neil of Middletwon North, Liam Mullett of Pingry (NJ), Tony Russell of West Chester Henderson, and Tyler Ranke of Hilton, to name just a few of the high-achievers. The winner will also want to cop the top time at the meet, and there's some runners like Brian Cook of Pearl River (NY) in the A race who will looking to be the fastest guy on the day.\n\nThe lineup of teams and runners at VCP on Saturday includes the following scorecard of impressiveness:\n\n5 US top-25 ranked teams, including the nation's #1 team.\n\n5 teams that are top ranked in their state (DE, NJ, NY, PA, VT) and four that are ranked second (CA, NJ, NY, RI). One of the other national ranking services has 8 of its top 25 teams at Eastern States.\n\n22 runners who have reached true greatness with a score of 180 for their TR speed rating score, plus still another who is ranked in the US top 25 runners.\n\n15 of the top finishers from last year's top 50 guys.\n\nA contest to replace Edward Cheserek as Eastern States champion that has Mickey Burke in the lead but also a lot of guys who are not used to eating any dust.\n\nWeather conditions should be ideal, and the crowds at Vanny will be doing their best to be noisy and demanding. Can't be beat.\n\nFast History of Fast\n\nThe Manhattan College Invitational meet started in 1973 after decades of predecessor races under the same name that drew teams to the renowned Van Cortlandt Park course. A few famous runners such as Alberto Salazar and Luis Ostolozaga took a crack at running the fastest time at the meet in the 1970s. In 1985, Monroe Woodbury’s John Trautmann topped Salazar’s 1975 record of 12:22.5 by almost 4 seconds when he ran a 12:18.7. This mark would stand for an eternity until 2006 when NJ’s premier runner Craig Forys ran down one of NY’s top guys, Steve Murdock, in the final stretch of the D race to shatter the record by 8 seconds with a 12:10.7. Forys’s mark lasted for another eternity of about 15 minutes until it was demolished by 0.1 seconds by NY-runner Tom Gruenewald of Fayetteville-Manlius in the E race. In 2008 the E race winner Solomon Haile of MD lowered the record by another 4 seconds to 12:06.61. In 2009 Joe Rosa of NJ’s West Windsor – Plainsboro North lowered the record another 3 seconds to 12:03.77 in the F race.\n\nA championship Eastern States race for the boys was first introduced in 2008 and was won by Don Bosco Prep of NJ, with sophomore Joe Rosa of WW-PN winning the race in 12:19.99. The next year, Christian Brothers Academy of Linwood NJ won the race and Joe Vitez of Haddonfield NJ took the individual title. Joe Rosa's twin brother Jim won the Eastern States race in 2010 and Shaker became the first NY team to take the title. In 2012 the title returned to CBA, and St. Benedict's of NJ's Edward Cheserek captured the race by 26 seconds with a record-obliterating mark of 11:55.39. Last year saw a repeat for both the team and individual winners as CBA took its third championship and Cheserek ran 11:58.7. And on it goes.\n\nPreview of Eastern States Teams\n\nChristian Brothers Academy -Lincroft is once again bringing a deep and powerful team to Eastern States, and the question that will be answered on Saturday is whether any of the other teams can find a way to unseat the two-time reigning champs. The Colts top foursome of Mike McClemens, Blaise Ferro, Tom Rooney, and Fran Bogan include four of the top 13 rated guys entering the race and will be a tough pack to overcome. McClemens got up for a 20th last year and Bogan was 33rd, so the Colts have some good experience with VCP's 2.5 mile course.\n\nTwo teams that have been having strong seasons and are well-versed at challenging CBA in the Easter States are national powers Fayetteville-Manlius and West Chester Henderson. Coming off a hard-fought win in the big McQuaid-AAA race two weeks ago, FM will try to counter CBA's top level strength with a trio of Bryce Millar, Andrew Berge, and Peter Ryan, brother of last year's runner-up, Nick Ryan. Millar was 7th in the ES last year, three places behind West Chester Henderson's top guy Tony Russell, whose Warriors' team is the top squad in Pennsylvania. WCH took its customary first in the Carlisle Challenge, and it comes to Manhattan with a history of laying down big results there like the 2nd place result from last year.\n\nOther teams from the traditional denizens of the VCP back woods who look to be making a run for the top include last year's 3rd place team Don Bosco (NJ), whose frontrunner Kyle Levermore finished 11th at ES in 2012, and Tatnall, who were 5th last year and are coming off a solid 3rd place performance in the Great American Race of Champions. Two new faces likely to be near the top include NY's #2 team and last year's Manhattan E-race winner Liverpool, led by Ben Petrella, and California's #2 team Palos Verdes, led by Casey Celestin and Miles Irish, Jr. And no Eastern States would be complete without some action from the local teams, and Catholic school powers St. Anthony's, led by Louis Santelli, and Chaminade, led by Thomas Slattery and Sean Kelly, will be bringing their best from Long Island.\n\nSome Seriously Speedy Guys\n\nMickey Burke Rush-Henrietta 197 Tom O'Neill Middletown North 190 Bryce Millar Fayetteville-Manlius 190 Mike McClemens CBA-Lincroft 189 Liam Mullett Pingry 188 Blaise Ferro CBA-Lincroft 188 Andrew Berge Fayetteville-Manlius 188 Tom Rooney CBA-Lincroft 187 Tony Russell West Chester Henderson 187 Tyler Ranke Hilton 187 Stephen Booker Bethlehem 185 Thomas Slattery Chaminade 185 Fran Bogan CBA-Lincroft 184 Kyle Gronostaj Columbia 183 Stephen Garrett Tatnall 183 Josiah Hanko (Scratch) Trinity Christian 183 Casey Celestin Palos Verdes 183 Ben Petrella Liverpool 183 Peter Ryan Fayetteville-Manlius 182 Jack Hagood Tatnall 182 Louis Santelli St. Anthony's 180 Samuel Chauvin Corning 180 Kyle Levermore (Scratch) Don Bosco ~177\n\nTeam Snapshot Overview\n\nThe snapshot view gives the basic info about the 33-team field listed by general estimated TR (Tully Runners) speed rating averages. For the NY teams the TR score is fairly precise based on the 2013 action. For outside-of-NY teams the TR is the score for the team's last big meet and is thus less comprehensive than the NY teams' season-compiled scores and could miss runners who were not at the selected meet.\n\nThe rankings cited are mainly from Milesplit national or state listings but also include rankings from coaches' polls in states like PA, MA, NJ, NY, and VA that do actually post weekly updates for teams that are linked to on the Milesplit sites. Rankings are from the last ones available at post time. I tried to provide at least the brute 5K time rankings for teams that are not officially ranked and these listings are noted with an (M). Some teams appear not to have run or completed any races yet. There are likely at least a few top teams that have not pulled out a hard core effort yet, but that will likely change at Eastern States.\n\nThe snapshot listing is not intended to be a prediction of the finish in the race. Some teams are extremely unbalanced with one or two runners at the top and a big gap to following runners, and these teams generally do not finish as high as their estimated TR would indicate. The scores for some out-of-state teams may not include key runners who were not present at the big meet from which the team's score was calculated. Finally, TRs are general estimates of team strength, so use them here as just broad indicators of the range in which a team is expected to run. Based on a big database of past results, the TRs serve as remarkably accurate predictors for races that have enough associated team data, and they are many orders of magnitude better than the divining rods that are often used to estimate team strengths.\n\nTeam 2012 Place National and Regional Rank 2013 Action TR Top 5 TR Avg.

Finished 2nd in the Woodbridge Cross Country Classic Sweepstakes race behind top team Arcadia and 3 points ahead of a powerhouse Great Oak team.\n\nComments: The last CA team to earn a top 5 finish in the race was Great Oak back in 2010, but the Palos Verdes team led by top 20 Sweepstakes finishers Casey Celestin and Miles Irish have a solid chance to repeat that feat.\n\nPennsbury (PA)\n\nOverview: The Falcons guys are rated in right around the middle of the PA teams, and that is where they seem to be stacked up against the teams in the Eastern States.\n\nRoster: Sam Webb (174), Alek Sauer (163), Liam O'Connell (162), Thomas Wick (143), Dan Tokar (141)\n\nTeam Data: 156.6 TR. Placed 5th in the PIAA meet's AAA race back on Sept. 21, which was won by PA #2 team North Allegheny.\n\nComments: The Pennsbury boys tend to be a bit overshadowed by their fleet sisters, but they're not letting the girls have all the ES fun this year, and Sam Webb could capture a top 50 place.\n\nChristian Brothers Academy (NJ)\n\nOverview: The Colts are looking for their 4th Eastern States title, and as the nation's top-ranked team and the reigning champs here, they will be strongly favored..\n\nRoster: Mike McClemens (189), Blaise Ferro (188), Tom Rooney (187), Fran Bogan (184), Josh Kruppa (176), Tom Dengler (176)\n\nTeam Data: TR 184.8. Won the Bowdoin-1 race against a top field on the same course that the NXN regional qualifier will be held.\n\nComments: No team here can muster a top 4 like CBA's, and the Colts should just be packing too much heat among the lead group in the final straightaway this year to let any other team break their winning streak at ES.\n\nSt. Anthony's (NY)\n\nOverview: The Friars are ranked #6 in New York and last year finished 6th in the race.\n\nRoster: Louis Santelli (180), Joseph Tucker (178), Patrick Tucker (177), Thomas Louro (161), Christopher Langer (159), Kevin Solar (158), Freddie Buckholz (158)\n\nTeam Data: 171.0. Finished 1st in the St. Anthony's-Large race and previously was 4th in the McQuaid-AAA race.\n\nComments: The Friars have been dogged by injuries this year, but if they can get a full squad together, this pack-running team can be very dangerous..\n\nDon Bosco Prep (NJ)\n\nOverview: The Ironmen are ranked #2 in NJ behind CBA-Lincroft and are at #23 in the US rankings.\n\nRoster: Kyle Levermore (177), Patrick Sullivan (172), Connor Nicholson (167), Zack Weland (166), Kevin Ramos (159), Bobby Gonzalez (155)\n\nTeam Data: 168.2. 7th in Carlisle-Challenge (without Levermore), 1st at Xavier\n\nComments: Don Bosco won the first Eastern States race in 2008, and this year top runner Kyle Levermore has yet to cut loose with a race like the one he had last year in the ES when he finished 11th.\n\nMidlothian (VA)\n\nOverview: The Panthers are ranked #7 in Virginia and finished 8th at Eastern States last year.\n\nRoster: Evan Benjamin (176), Tommy Mulroy (176), Collin Hahn (172), Zach Wilson (155), Morgan Potter (136)\n\nTeam Data: 163.0. Placed 20th in the Great American-Race of Champions after finishing 4th in the Adidas Challenge.\n\nComments: Midlothian has a solid group up top but will likely need to get a stronger push from the 4-5-6 guys if the Panthers want to repeat their top 10 finish from last year.\n\nFayetteville-Manlius (NY)\n\nOverview: The Hornets are ranked #1 in NY but only #17 in the national rankings cited here, though other ranking services that comprehend the use of speed ratings cite them as a top 5 team. Last year they opened the season at Manhattan and finished 4th in Eastern States.\n\nRoster: Bryce Millar (190), Andrew Berge (188), Peter Ryan (182), Adam Hunt (179), Riley Hughes (171), Kyle Barber (169)\n\nTeam Data: 182.0 TR. Placed 1st in the McQuaid-AAA race.\n\nComments: FM successfully fought off an attack from archrival Liverpool at the big McQuaid meet two weeks ago and appears to be well positioned for a strong challenge to CBA-Lincroft. Frontrunner Bryce Millar finished 7th in the ES last year, the second highest place by a returning runner behind West Chest Henderson's Tony Russell.\n\nChaminade (NY)\n\nOverview: The Flyers are ranked 7th in NY and were the champions in the Manhattan G race last year.\n\nRoster: Thomas Slattery (185), Sean Kelly (184), Gunnar Nolan (166), Thomas Hayes (159), Sean Luzzi (156)\n\nTeam Data: 170.0. Placed 3rd in the Bowdoin-1 and 2nd in the Briarwood Championship races\n\nComments: Chaminade has a powerful top duo of 2012 G-race champ Thomas Slattery and Sean Kelly, and now they are looking for some more movement behind them so that the Flyers can move ahead of archrival St. Anthony's.\n\nWest Chester Henderson (PA)\n\nOverview: The Warriors are the top team in PA and the 9th ranked team in the US.\n\nRoster: Tony Russell (187), Reiny Barchat (176), Eric Stratman (174), Seamus Colliss (173), Alex Knapp (170), Ricky Waltz (169), Kevin Moy (168)\n\nTeam Data: 176.4. Won the Carlisle Challenge race.\n\nComments: Frontrunner Tony Russell did not compete at Carlisle, and it's hard to say whether the Warriors have had any of their A races yet. But Eastern States usually brings out the best in the PA powerhouse, and WCH should finish among the top four teams.\n\nLoyola Blakefield (MD)\n\nOverview: The Dons are among the top 15 teams in MD.\n\nRoster: Tyler Spears (176), Frankie Legambi (165), Mike Wegner (159), Sean Duffy (128), Logan Gibbs (128)\n\nTeam Data: 150.2. Placed 7th in the Maryland Spiked Shoe.\n\nComments: Tyler Spears should be shooting for a top 50 place in the ES, but the Dons will need some more depth to get much above a 25th place..\n\nTatnall (DE)\n\nOverview: The Hornets are the #1 team in Delaware and finished 5th in the ES in 2012..\n\nRoster: Stephen Garrett (183), Jack Hagood (182), Ben Boswell (167), Michael Flanagan (164), Henry Paul (160), Patrick Lynch (165)\n\nTeam Data: 171.2, Placed 3rd in the Great American Race of Champions and 2nd in the Carlisle Challenge.\n\nComments: Always a tough competitor in the Eastern States, Tatnall has a great duo of Stephen Garrett and Jack Hagood who both finished in the top 22 last year and should keep the Hornets among the top 5 to 7 teams..\n\nHilton (NY)\n\nOverview: The Cadets are unranked and are centered around frontrunner Tyler Ranke.\n\nRoster: Tyler Ranke (186), Robe Wright (158), Donovan Glavin (145), Josh Buri (142), Justin Scheg (140)\n\nTeam Data: 154.2. 6th in GCC Cougar,\n\nComments: Hilton as a team will battle to repeat its top 20 finish from 2012, but the story here is Tyler Ranke, who placed 30th in the ES last year and should move way up on Saturday.\n\nBrighton (NY)\n\nOverview: The Barons are ranked #10 in the NY-B class and finished 19th in the ES last year.\n\nRoster: Will Ronchetti (178), Drew Schmitt (168), Jonah Simpson (161), Mason Vodacek (159), Zachary Simpson (159), Paul Dellinger (156)\n\nTeam Data: 165.0. Finished 6th in the McQuaid-AA..\n\nComments: Brighton will be fighting for a top 10 place in the ES, and after finishing 37th in the race last year, frontrunner Will Ronchetti will be running as the 13th fastest finisher from last year's returners.\n\nLiverpool (NY)\n\nOverview: The Warriors are ranked #2 in NY and #18 in the US. They were the E race champs last year.\n\nRoster: Ben Petrella (183), Connor Buck (171), Dan Muldoon (179), Alex Christensen (175), Nick Leclair (170), Dylan McCarthy (166)\n\nTeam Data: 178.2. Placed 2nd in the McQuaid-AAA and 1st in the Queensbury-Championship races.\n\nComments: Liverpool has a strong pack of guys who all ran high in the Manhattan E race last year and are posing a big threat to archrival Fayetteville-Manlius for the lead in NY's section 3. The Warriors' Ben Petrella could take a top 10 place and his team could break into the top 3 in the Eastern States.\n\nPingry (NJ)\n\nOverview: The Big Blue are rated among the top half of the teams in NJ.and are centered on frontrunner Liam Mullett\n\nRoster: Liam Mullett (188), Stewart Wood (166), James Chartouni (138), Thomas Tarantino (138), Russell Beckerman (134)\n\nTeam Data: 152.0. Placed 3rd in the New Jersey Shore Coaches-3 race.\n\nComments: Pingry appears set for a top 25 finish in the ES, but Liam Mullett is rated among the top 10 runners in the race.\n\nBethlehem (NY)\n\nOverview: The Wildcats are rated among the top 40 teams in NY.\n\nRoster: Stephen Rooker (185), Alex Carlson (166), Tom Quackenbush (164), Keith Machabee (153), Simon Powhida (145), Andrew Rutnik (145)\n\nTeam Data: 162.6 TR.

Placed 12th in the Great American Race of Champions race on Saturday.\n\nComments: The Rams have a history of doing well at Manhattan and appear to have an outside shot at another top 10 finish this year in the ES. Jake Grundy finished 32nd in the race last year.\n\nRush-Henrietta (NY)\n\nOverview: The Royal Comets are in a rebuilding year, but frontrunner Mickey Burke is the favorite for the individual title.\n\nRoster: Mickey Burke (197), Mehamed Abdurahim (141), Kevin Palmeri (133), David McCarroll (128), Paul Henry (127)\n\nTeam Data: 146.2. Finished 17th in the McQuaid-AAA\n\nComments: The team that's always in a rush has little depth behind top guy Mickey Burke this year, but after posting the top time at McQuaid, he is expected to be the one to replace Edward Cheserek on the winner's podium this year..\n\nWesthill-Bishop Ludden (NY)\n\nOverview: The Warriors are ranked #20 among NY's B Class teams and were 24th in the ES last year.\n\nRoster: Liam Rodgers (160), Dan Demauro (154), Joshua Burns (153), Kyle Fitch (151), Garnet Remillard (149)\n\nTeam Data: 153.4 TR.

Finished 18th in the McQuaid-AAA race.\n\nComments: While certainly not a power team in the ES, the Maroons do know the course a little and Jordan Middleton took 78th in the race last year.\n\nRidgefield (CT)\n\nOverview: The Tigers do not appear to have raced in an invitational meet yet this year but have everybody back from a squad that was one of the tops in CT last year. They were 6th in the Manhattan-B race last year.\n\nRoster: Trevor Hopper (179), Andrew Oakes (156), Clint Corso (153), Graeme Hewett (152), Kristian Sogaard (149), Gabe Altopp (148).

Placed 5th in the McQuaid-AA race.\n\nComments: Corning has been having a strong season during its quest for a NY B Class title this year, and Samuel Chauvin and Tom Moshier will be looking to move up among the top 25 to 30 runners after finishing 68th and 64th here last year.\n\nEastport-South Manor (NY)\n\nOverview: The Sharks are unranked and finished 10th in the Manhattan B race last year.\n\nRoster: Tom Meehan (172), Brendan Turbush (140), Dom Deangelis (114), Tyler Murano (108), Scott Frevert (94)\n\nTeam Data: 125.6 TR.

Finished 2nd in the Peddie and 21st in the NJCTC-merge meets.\n\nComments: Though Edward Cheserek is gone, the Gray Bees are back for more ES, and this year's team is really a team instead of mainly just a top runner.\n\nMillburn (NJ)\n\nOverview: The Millers are ranked #7 in NJ and finished 4th in the Manhattan B race last year..\n\nRoster: Matt Grossman (165), Steven Cohen (163), Robert Stone (163), Chris Stone (156), Owen McCarthy (145)\n\nTeam Data: 158.4 TR. Placed 9th inthe New Jersey Shore Coaches-Championship race.\n\nComments: Millburn is another one of those solidly constructed teams that projects in the top 20 but could get up among the top 15 teams with a big effort.
