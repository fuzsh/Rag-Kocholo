He was raised on various farms around northwest Iowa and attended school in Mallard, Clay Central, and Spencer, graduating in 1978. He was bow-legged, pigeon toed, and smoked, but was still one of the fastest guys on the track team.\n\nOn August 20, 1983, Mike married Traci VerMeer at Bethany Lutheran Church in Spencer, Iowa. Together they raised two wonderful daughters. He worked at Morton Buildings for many years before working a job he truly loved, driving school bus with Spencer Community Schools. Mike was a member of Knight of Columbus and a faithful member of Sacred Heart Catholic Church. He loved cheering on the Iowa Hawkeyes, Kansas City Chiefs, Minnesota Twins, Notre Dame Fighting Irish and Spencer Tigers. We know the Chiefs won this yearâ€™s Super Bowl for him! He also loved cold beer, fishing, golfing, and listening to music, especially classic rock and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. He was an avid reader and liked Louis Lamour books and Sports Illustrated. He was known for his smile, contagious laugh, witty comeback, and the love he had for his wife and family.\n\nMike passed away peacefully at his home after a courageous battle with cancer. He was proceeded in death by his grandparents, Francis & Alice Hynes, Ambrose & Julia Kirschbaum; in-laws, Sydney & Gerald VerMeer; his uncle, Billy Lowe; Cousin, Kent Goodchild and brother-in-law, Greg Quillin.\n\nLeft to continue to share his stories are his wife, Traci of Spencer; 2 daughters: Jenny (Brad) Reis of Spencer, IA, and Jaime (Bryan) Lair, of Spencer, IA; 4 grandchildren: Jalyn and Brandt Reis and Ethan and Ella Lair; his parents: Jim and Pat Hynes of Spencer; two sisters: Kelly (Steve) Meier of Waterloo, IA and Susie (Greg Marquette) Hynes of LeSueur, MN; sisters-in-law, Teresa (Joe) Deeter of Dumas, TX; Toni Quillin of Spencer, IA; Kelli (Chester) Yoes of Hartley, IA; many nieces and nephews, aunts and uncles, cousins and many friends.\n\nThe family would like to give a special thank you to the staff of Spencer Schools, especially the transportation team for helping him enjoy each day at work. Also the Abben Cancer Center nurses and staff, Dr. Preston, Dr. Meyer, Kindred Hospice, especially Stacie and Emily who were very good to him and our family, and to his cousin, Tammy Gillis and sister-in-law, Toni for being amazing caregivers!\n\nSERVICES\n\nPrivate family services will be held on Tuesday, May 12 at 10:30 a.m. at the Warner Chapel in Spencer.
