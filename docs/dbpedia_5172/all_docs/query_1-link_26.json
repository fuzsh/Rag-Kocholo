It's 1930 and two record producers are competing to sign a big contract with the leading singer of the day. One kidnaps the other, thinking it's in the bag - unaware that his competitor has a twin who will step in to save the day.",

        "text": "There's really nothing like the \"Tegn\" films. Not even the Bavarian comedies. For one thing, they're hardcore. But mostly they're alike. A whole lotta slapstick and some stunning and very talented actresses not afraid to show their bodies and look like they're enjoying sex. Cia Lowgren is gorgeous here, even tho Ole puts the song over better and the strip poker scene is ridiculous. Eva Weinreich, too, in a quite different way. Anne Bei Warburg does yet another alluring scene with her husband. And Louise Frevert is given ample room to display her ample charms and irrepressible overbite. She is also an incredible dancer. I believe Barbi Benton can be spotted (easily, since the camera zooms in on her) shaving her legs alongside Kate Mundt in the women's locker room.. There's plenty of nonsense, too, for example when Hans Jorgensen (I think) interrupts repeatedly with his inventions - long-playing vinyl records, stereo and television, etc - and is summarily ejected from the office, And a lot of fake mustaches and a beautifully restored Packard convertible. They don't make 'em like this anymore."
