        "text": "Mass of Christian Burial for Eva Maule, age 98, of Bloomfield, Nebraska will be 10:00 a.m. May 18, 2019, at St. Andrew’s Catholic Church in Bloomfield. Reverend Tim Podraza will be Celebrant, with private family burial in Bloomfield City Cemetery.\n\nVisitation will be one hour prior to the service at the church.\n\nBrockhaus Funeral Home in Bloomfield is in charge of arrangements.\n\nEva was born February 13, 1921, on her family farm near Verdigre, Nebraska. She died May 5, 2019, at Good Samaritan Nursing Home in Bloomfield, where she was a resident for two months. The distance is scarcely 35 miles, but in her 98 years Eva's life embraced and nourished five children, Donna (Bill Marvel), Dean Maule (Linda Bliemeister), Joan (Dan Anderson), Diana (Kelvin Peters), and Jeanne (Doug Kauth); thirteen grandchildren; 24 great-grandchildren; one great-great-grandchild; and countless friends who knew and loved her, near and far.\n\nShe was born Eva Viola Sukup, brought into the world by her grandmother Skokan, who was the official midwife, a profession followed later by Eva's mother. The youngest in a family of six children - four boys two girls - Eva decided after a year in high school in Verdigre to become a teacher, but after two years of training in Creighton, changed her mind and returned to Verdigre to finish high school. At a dance at ZCBJ Dance Hall in Verdigre, she met Donald Maule, a young man from Bloomfield with Clark Gable good looks. Eva was a redhead who, like Don, enjoyed dancing, and a spark was struck.\n\nDon was drafted into the U.S Army and shipped off to boot camp. Returning home on leave, the couple was married at St. Wenceslaus Catholic Church March 18,1943. Don was next assigned to medic surgical tech training in Leadville, CO. Eva followed and worked as a waitress in a local cafe. Don was next sent to Los Angeles for shipping out to the Aleutian Islands, Eva stayed in Los Angeles with her sister and worked in a bowling alley until Don was sent to Germany. Eva was then called home to help with her father, who was dying from cancer. There the couple's first child, Donna, was born.\n\nAfter the war, Eva and Don rented land by Verdigre and farmed together with Eva's brothers. Eva saved all the money Don sent home in Army pay and bought a tractor and plow. Their first house was a one room log cabin, that was then added onto later. NO electricity, no running water, or bathroom facilities. A very meager first home. There Dean was born. Within a few years the couple bought a farm near Center, where two more children were born, Joan and Diana, Joan in her uncle's new car going 90 mph, delivered by Eva's mother, the midwife's last baby she birthed. Don was out stacking hay too far away to fetch.\n\nThe couple moved once more, to Don's parents' home place near Bloomfield, where Jeanne, their youngest child, was born. To those who remember them, they were more than a married couple, they were partners. It was not unusual to see her in jeans and a farmer's cap pitching hay in the feed bunks, while Don was doing other chores. In fact, she could do almost everything that Don could do, and more, in cow calving or preparations for one of her daughter's wedding suppers. Yet there was always time for children and grandchildren.\n\nAfter Don was diagnosed with cancer, they moved to the town of Bloomfield, in the fall, and bought the house of Eva's dreams, a brick house with a level lawn. Don died next January, but Eva continued to flourish with city living, a Yard of the Month sign posted for months at a time. She had a true love for flowers. She was a faithful member of St. Andrews, enjoyed helping with fall fund-raiser and Altar Society duties. Eva enjoyed the VFW auxiliary, played cards with three different groups, and crocheting. She was an avid reader of Western novels, especially Louis L'Amour and Zane Grey. She remained active and alert almost to the end, hoping to outlive her oldest living relative, which she did by one month. She died at Good Samaritan Nursing Home in Bloomfield on Sunday May 5.\n\n​\n\nEva was preceded in death by her parents; sister and brothers; husband, Don; daughter, Donna; and granddaughter, Carrie.\n\n​Funeral services for Lawrence H. Lauck, age 95, of Wausa, Nebraska will be 10:30 a.m. Friday, May 10, 2019, at Golgotha Lutheran Church in rural Wausa.

(Rockman) Lauck. He became a child of God through baptism on May 27, 1924, at Trinity Lutheran Church in Steen, Minnesota by Pastor Theodore Goehle. On July 9, 1939, Lawrence renewed his baptismal vows through confirmation at St. Johns Lutheran Church in Luverne, Minnesota by Reverend Hauser. His confirmation verse was Revelation 3:20. He attended school through the tenth grade in Luverne, Minnesota.\n\nOn November 17, 1944, Lawrence enlisted in the Navy. He was assigned to the USS Lawrence. Later, he was assigned to the USS Sevier. He was discharged from the Navy on July 14, 1946.\n\nOn August 28, 1949, Lawrence was united in marriage to Audrey Corrine Frevert at Golgotha Lutheran Church near Wausa, Nebraska. They lived and farmed near Bigelow, Minnesota before settling on a farm southwest of Wausa where they raised six children.\n\nLawrence was a devoted Christian and gave service to his church as elder, trustee, and usher. His children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren were the pride and joy of his life. He was also a devoted farmer and took pride in his work. He and Audrey shared a hobby of loom rug making and Lawrence enjoyed restoring many pedal tractors which looked brand new when he was done with them.\n\nSurvivors include his six children, Brenda Lind and her husband, Rich of Osmond, Barbara Kliment and her husband, Gary of Lincoln, Loren and Kathryn of Bloomfield, Carla Shearon of Bloomfield, Kevin and Tammy Lauck of Bloomfield, and Kristine Robinson and her husband, Jerry of Wayne; 16 grandchildren; 25 great-grandchildren; sisters-in-law, LaVonne Peters of Wood River and Lois Frevert of Bloomfield; and a host of nieces and nephews.\n\n​\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; wife, Audrey; brothers and sisters-in-law, Herman and Arlynn Lauck and Virgil and Arlene Lauck; sister and brother-in-law, Elaine and John Janssen; brothers-in-law, Clifton Frevert and Luther Peters; grandson, Jeffrey Kliment; and granddaughter, Susan Lind.\n\nFuneral services for Lawrence Gieselman, age 90, of Bloomfield, Nebraska was held 10:30 a.m. Monday, April 29, 2019, at Christ Memorial United Methodist Church in Bloomfield.

He was baptized and confirmed at the First Trinity Lutheran Church in Bloomfield.\n\nLawrence grew up on the family farm southwest of Bloomfield. In 1935, his father became seriously ill and Lawrence took on a heavy load of the farm responsibilities at an early age. Although he enjoyed school, his parents decided he was needed on the farm full time and would not be able to attend high school. Lawrence’s 13th birthday was his final day of formal education. He also finished the spring plowing the same day.\n\nIn 1950, he was asked to play Santa Claus at a country school Christmas program. Through this event, he was introduced to Virginia Kane and they began a courtship. However, this budding relationship was interrupted when Lawrence was drafted into the Army in March 1951.\n\nAfter basic training in Missouri and diesel mechanic’s school in Washington D.C., he shipped off to Korea in late 1951. He spent 1952 in Korea serving with the Core of Engineers in the “Punch Bowl” area building roads and servicing equipment in support of the combat units. He rose to the rank of staff sergeant. Later in life Lawrence would comment about his time in the military, “I didn’t want to go, but I’m proud I did.”\n\nHe returned to Bloomfield in January 1953 and immediately rekindled his relationship with his sweetheart, Virginia Kane. In May they eloped to Kansas City and were married on May 29, 1953, a marriage that would last 62 years. Lawrence returned to farming and in 1954 the young couple moved to the farm where he had grown up. The farming operation included swine, chickens, shorthorn cattle, and a variety of crops. Lawrence and Virginia raised four children, Warren, Grant, Marlene, and Rod. They faithfully attended the First United Methodist Church in Bloomfield.\n\nIn 1967, he became a substitute rural mail carrier which helped supplement the farm income. In 1981, he become a full-time mail carrier and phased out of farming over the next several years. He retired from the Postal Service in 1992.\n\nLawrence and Virginia enjoyed many years of active retirement. They enjoyed camping, playing cards, and making friends wherever they went. Their travels took them to all 50 states. Lawrence had many hobbies including reading, woodworking, stained glass, and antique cars and tractors.\n\nLawrence served his community as a member of the American Legion, Co-op Board, Farm Bureau Board, 4-H Leader, and Band Parent. As a member of the First United Methodist Church Board, he was instrumental in establishing the scholarship fund.\n\nHe will be sorely missed by his family. We loved him for his kind heart and patience. We were awed by his brilliance and creativity. He was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.\n\nLawrence passed away on April 24, 2019, at the age of 91.\n\nHe was preceded in death by wife, Virginia; parents, Henry and Clara Gieselman; sister, Shirley Kumm; sister, Rachel and her husbands, Aaron Mumm and Vernon Carlow; and son-in-law, David Meyer.\n\nLawrence is survived by son, Warren and wife Tammy; son, Grant and wife JoAnn; daughter, Marlene Welch and husband Peter; son, Rod and wife Debbie; his younger siblings, Richard Gieselman and wife Norma, and Fern Svehla and husband Bob; brother-in-law, Lawrence Kumm; nine grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.\n\nThe family recommends that memorials be given to the Bloomfield Veteran’s Memorial, C/O Joe Skrivan, 504 East Bazile Street, Bloomfield, NE 68718.\n\n​\n\nFuneral services for Darrel Walton, age 69, of Wayne, Nebraska will be 10:30 a.m. Thursday, May 2, 2019, at United Methodist Church in Verdigre, Nebraska.

His military service included a combat tour in Vietnam (C CO, 1/52ND, 198TH LIB, Americal Division). He was a member of the VFW Post 5291 of Wayne and the American Legion Post 259 of Verdigre. Darrel married Elizabeth “Betty” Ann Kucera on May 4, 1974. They were blessed with five children and 13 grandchildren; all of whom meant the world to him.

He will be greatly missed.\n\nMass Of Christian Burial for Carl Jenness, age 61, of Lincoln, formerly of Wayne is at St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Wayne Tuesday at 10:30 a.m.\n\nThe Visitation was also at St. Mary’s Catholic Church Wayne Monday from 4:00 p.m - 6:30 p.m.\n\nArrangements were done by Hasemann Funeral Home of Wayne. He was burried at Interment Greenwood Cemetery Wayne. He passed away Thursday, April 11th, at a Lincoln Hospital. Memorials may be directed to the Jenness family for later designation.\n\nCarl Jenness was born in Wayne, Nebraska on April 28, 1957 and passed away in Lincoln, Nebraska on April 11, 2019 at the age of 61.\n\nCarl spent his early childhood in Ida Grove, Iowa, and returned to Wayne at age 6. He was active in Boy Scouts as an Eagle Scout, in neighborhood games and shenanigans, and in manning the fryers at the Fat Kat (his family’s restaurant). He graduated from Wayne High in 1975 and from Mount Marty College in 1980 with a degree in Business.\n\nAfter graduation, Carl became an insurance adjuster in Yankton, South Dakota, and later operated his own independent adjuster business, BWA Claims, in Bloomfield, serving north central Nebraska and working several US natural disasters until 2001. In 1986, Carl married Georgia Gayle Schmeckpeper and was overjoyed to adopt her children, Brandon, Wade, and Ann. Carl and Georgia divorced in 1996.\n\nAs an active dad and business owner, Carl served his community of Bloomfield as a Boy Scout leader, president of the Board of Directors of St. Andrew’s Catholic Church, and organizer of a popular fundraising project for the Knights of Columbus.\n\nBeginning with two Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) or mini-strokes in 2001 and 2002, Carl’s underlying condition, a viral cardiomyopathy, was discovered. Carl’s very active life filled with bowling, softball, Husker football, life at Lewis & Clark Lake, fishing in Canada, traveling with family and friends, camping, and so many other adventures began to slowly diminish as his heart failure progressed, and his ability to climb ladders and assess roof damage disappeared.\n\nIn July 2010, the annual Chicken Show festival in Wayne caused Carl to cross paths with high school friend, Brenda Gaunt, and their love grew until this day.\n\nAfter surviving a cardiac arrest at a golf outing with Brenda in 2012, Carl received his third and more powerful pacemaker with an internal defibrillator. Stable only for a few more years, Carl underwent surgery in 2016 to implant a mechanical pump -- a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) -- to help his heart and keep him alive while awaiting a donor heart transplant.\n\nSadly, suddenly, and unexpectedly last Thursday, Carl suffered a massive brain bleed and stroke, causing damage beyond repair.\n\nIn death, Carl’s last generous act was to donate his corneas, tissue, and long bones to benefit others.\n\nCarl leaves behind his love, Brenda Gaunt of Lincoln; his parents, Miron and Louise (Fank) Jenness of Wayne; his children, Brandon (Lidia) Jenness of San Diego, California, Wade (Lyndsy) Jenness of Bloomfield, and Ann Jenness of Arlington; grandchildren, Lillian, Josiah, Brayden, Lauren, Sienna, and Jaysen; brother, Vince (Cindy) Jenness of Waterloo, Iowa; sister, Ann (Bryan) Ruwe of Wayne; and Brenda’s family, Natalie & Greg of Denver, Colorado; and Drew & Jessi, with Magnolia, Heidi, Eloise, and Serra of Lawrence, Kansas.\n\n​\n\nCarl was preceded in death by his grandparents, Arthur and Esther Jenness, and Carl and Clarabelle Fank."
