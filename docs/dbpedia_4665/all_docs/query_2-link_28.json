There are many good reasons for \"going global,\" but a majority of companies â both large and small â fail in their initial efforts.\n\nBefore you make the final decision to \"go global,\" much research and planning is required to address and answer the following questions.\n\nYour product\n\nDo you have to make changes to your product(s) or the packaging to ensure compatibility with your new foreign customer base? Will you have to accommodate a different measurement system (for example, metric) or operate on a different power source or voltage?\n\nAre there different ecological or safety restrictions in any or all of your global markets that will affect either the manufacture or use of your products?\n\nWill you have to modify your packaging to be more durable or climate resistant?\n\nWill you need to translate or expand your installation and repair instructions to accommodate additional foreign languages?\n\nYour manufacturing processes\n\nAre you planning on using a different set of production equipment?\n\nWill the equipment warranties and other maintenance requirements be supportable at your new locations?\n\nDo you need to modify your internal manufacturing processes and procedures to accommodate your new workforce?\n\nDo you have the right production metrics in place for a facility in a foreign location?\n\nAre your new foreign facilities secure and sustainable, and do they comply with national, regional and local regulations?\n\nYour distribution processes\n\nHave you established new supply and distribution chains for both the raw materials you need to support your production, as well as for the delivery of your finished products?\n\nAre there customs and other cross-border regulations that will affect your supply and distribution chains?\n\nDo you have to modify your raw material inventories to account for new procurement challenges?\n\nWill you have to adjust your product inventory levels and processes to accommodate foreign order and ship times?\n\nDo you know if your domestic transportation and movement processes and levels of in-transit security can be sustained in your foreign operations?\n\nHave you examined the various foreign transportation routes and modes to promote efficiency and prevent loss?\n\nDo you need to consider outsourcing some or all of your distribution?\n\nYour marketing strategy\n\nDo you know what adjustments need to be made to your marketing policies and practices to accommodate the culture and traditions of your foreign markets?\n\nDo you have to change the way you market your product, in order to avoid misinterpretation?\n\nAre you going to be using traditional brick-and-mortar outlets or focusing on sales via the Internet?\n\nWill you have to modify your return policies to accommodate your new foreign customer base?\n\nYour workforce\n\nAre you going to relocate your domestic workforce to manage your foreign facilities? Have you evaluated the tangible and intangible monetary and social costs associated with their housing, safety, health, and transportation?\n\nAre you going to employ expatriates, foreign nationals, local nationals, or a combination of employee types?\n\nDo you understand the national, regional, and local laws concerning all your workforce, to include work visas, work hours, overtime, leave, and required benefits?\n\nDo you know what the restrictions are (if any) for employing female workers or minors?\n\nDo you have to modify your employee training programs to accommodate local languages, cultures and traditions?\n\nYour \"bottom line\"\n\nWill you need additional or different types of insurance to protect your foreign facilities, your foreign distribution chain, and your employees?\n\nAre there any additional liabilities that would have to be addressed or resolved under foreign, rather than domestic, legal channels?\n\nHave you reviewed your strategy for protecting your intellectual property in your foreign location?\n\nWill your domestic data management software and equipment operating and security policies have to be hardened to ensure prevention of or recovery from compromise, loss, or theft at your foreign sites?\n\nCan you get your foreign employees bonded, if necessary?\n\nDo you know what legal recourse you have should your foreign operations be affected by political disruption or sabotage?\n\nHave you investigated the instances of counterfeiting in your new market, and have a plan to protect your product and your brand?\n\nWill your domestic operations be able to assume the foreign operations' product and service output should there be a stoppage or loss of foreign production capability?\n\nIf your foreign expansion fails, how will it affect the company?"
