        "meta_description": "West High School opened on September 8, 1908 at 120 South Central Avenue. By 1916 there were 19 teachers and 457 pupils. The principal was Mr. Otto H. Magly and vice-principal was Miss Augusta Connolley. Construction began on a new West High School building on June 6, 1927 at 179 South Powell Avenue.  It was designed by prominent Ohio-born architect Howard Dwight Smith who is well known for designing the Ohio Stadium in 1918. The new West High School opened in 1929 while the old school building reopened as Starling Junior High School at the same time. The second West High is still in operation as of 2018, but Starling Junior High closed in 2012.",
