        "text": "This sublime, organic mountain extra virgin olive oil is a blend of heirloom varieties known to exist only on the Belvís de las Navas estate, overlooking Gibraltar and the coasts of Africa. The 18-hectare estate sits among tall cliffs, steep slopes and narrow terraces of difficult access that have sheltered olive varieties, allowing them to survive unnoticed for decades in a unique microclimate in what is known as the tail of the Subbaetic system. This one-of-a kind blend includes wild olive strains (Acebuchina) contributing great aromatic complexity to this freshly squeezed olive juice. Aromas of freshly cut grass, ripe tomatoes, artichoke, a hint of almond are found with a spicy note in the end. The olives are collected early in the season and are crushed everyday of harvest at low temperature to preserve the organoleptic and physiochemical properties intact.\n\nOlive Varietals:\n\nHojiblanca, Verdial Vélez Málaga, Zorzaleña, Manzanilla Aloreña, and wild olive strains known as Acebuchina\n\n; Oleic Acidity:\n\n0.19%\n\nBelvís de Las Navas EVOO Sell Sheet\n\nFlavor Profile\n\nA complex oil bursting with aromas of freshly cut green grass, artichoke, tomatoes, a hint of almond and a spicy note on the tongue.
