Introduction\n\nOlives (Olea) are part of the Oleaceae family. The commercially important species is Olea europaea L. and the most widely grown cultivar is ‘Manzanillo’. Other important cultivars for table olives include ‘Sevillano’, ‘Mission’, ‘Ascolano’, and ‘Barouni’ (Molinar, 2013). Some olive cultivars are preferred for olive oil, table olives, or both. The olive fruit can be harvested at any stage from green olives, olives turning color, and black olives. There are many ways to convert olive fruit into table olives, but the “natural” method is popular in Italy; for this method, olives are washed with water or a weak brine solution and then are preserved in a brine solution, in which they undergo lactic fermentation. This natural method preserves the table olive’s antioxidants and nutritional value (OP Latium, 2018). Curing olives leaches out the oleuropein, a bitter tasting compound that makes freshly harvested olives inedible. Olive oil production has a few more steps because the oil must be extracted from the olives. The first step is to clean the olive fruit. Next, the olives are ground into a paste in order to tear the flesh cells to help release the oil. Then the paste is mixed for 20 to 45 minutes to allow the oil droplets to combine into larger droplets. Finally, a centrifuge is used to separate the oil from the vegetable water and solids (The Olive Oil Source, 2020).\n\nOlives were produced on 37,500 acres in the United States in 2019. The production was valued at over $130 million (USDA NASS, 2020). California is the only state that grows olives, and while it is an important crop, it is dwarfed by Spain’s olive industry. In 2002, Spain grew olives on over 5.6 million acres (Molinar, 2013). California produces 400,000 gallons of olive oil each year. Experts predict that olive oil production in California will continue to increase substantially. The increase will be in part due to larger, highly dense plantings of new olive cultivars that can withstand machines that can efficiently harvest olives (Molinar, 2013).\n\n2. olea (olive) collection\n\nThe U.S. National Plant Germplasm System olive collection has 164 accessions of Olea europea that are maintained as trees in the field.\n\nFigure 1.
