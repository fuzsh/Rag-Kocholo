        "text": "I recently discovered this dish in an old cookbook I have, and I consulted with some family members and they make it too. Wanted to share the recipe! I realized I like homemade dough in this better than phyllo.\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the Filling:\n\n- 1 pound ground beef\n\n- 1 pound ground pork\n\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n\n- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped\n\n- 1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped\n\n- 1/4 cup fresh mint, chopped\n\n- 1/2 cup Arborio rice\n\n- 1 cup tomato sauce\n\n- 1/2 cup red wine (optional)\n\n- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n- 1/2 cup grated kefalotyri or Parmesan cheese\n\nFor the Dough:\n\n- 4 cups all-purpose flour\n\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n\n- 1 cup warm water\n\n- 1/2 cup olive oil\n\n- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n\nFor Assembling:\n\n- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)\n\n- Sesame seeds (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\nPrepare the Dough:\n\n1. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.\n\n2. Make a well in the center and add the warm water, olive oil, and red wine vinegar.\n\n3. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.\n\n4. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest while you prepare the filling.\n\nMake the Filling:\n\n1. In a large skillet over medium heat, sauté the chopped onion until translucent.\n\n2. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.\n\n3. Add the ground beef and pork, cooking until browned and cooked through. Drain any excess fat.\n\n4. Stir in the chopped parsley, dill, and mint, and cook for another 2 minutes.\n\n5. Add the rice, tomato sauce, and red wine (if using). Stir well to combine.\n\n6. Season with cinnamon, salt, and pepper.\n\n7. Let the mixture simmer for about 10-15 minutes until the rice is partially cooked. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.\n\n8. Stir in the grated cheese.\n\nAssemble the Pie:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).\n\n2. Divide the dough into two equal parts.\n\n3. Roll out one half on a floured surface to fit your baking dish (about 9x13 inches).\n\n4. Place the rolled dough into the baking dish, pressing it to cover the bottom and sides.\n\n5. Spread the meat filling evenly over the dough.\n\n6. Roll out the second half of the dough to cover the filling.\n\n7. Place the top layer of dough over the filling, sealing the edges by pressing them together. Trim any excess dough.\n\n8. Brush the top with beaten egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired.\n\n9. Cut a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape.\n\nBake:\n\n1. Bake in the preheated oven for about 50-60 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and crispy.\n\n2. Let the pie cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nI'm looking for some advice on how to buy good Greek yogurt. I know there are a lot of options out there, but I want to make sure I'm choosing the best one.\n\nWhat should I look for in terms of texture, flavor, and ingredients?\n\nAre there any specific brands that you recommend? I've heard that authentic Greek yogurt is thicker and creamier, but I'm not sure how to tell if what I'm buying is the real deal.\n\nShould I be looking for any particular labels or certifications? Also, if you have any tips on the best ways to enjoy Greek yogurt, I'd love to hear them!\n\nI tend to cook with Greek yogurt and I love to eat it for breakfast with honey and walnuts."
