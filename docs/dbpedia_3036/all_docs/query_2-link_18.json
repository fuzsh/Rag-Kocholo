        "text": "What We Like\n\nSmooth flavor with herbal notes\n\nVersatile\n\nMultiple sizes are avaialble\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nNot a strong smell\n\nThis EVOO from California Olive Ranch checks all of our boxes for what a versatile pantry staple should be: mild in flavor for ease of use, cost-effective, sturdy, and high-quality. It’s no wonder that after testing at home and in our lab we crowned it the best of the best.\n\nPicking it up we noticed the dark green glass bottle is thick and protective, so it shouldn’t shatter on you if dropped. It is easy to pour and the oil is a luminous golden, slightly greenish-yellow, just as you’d expect olive oil to be. This oil doesn’t have a strong smell, but we forgot all about that as soon as it hit our tongues.\n\nWe tasted it with some fresh bread in addition to slurping it in our hand—and with both, we were met with a light, slightly grassy neutral flavor. There was a tiny bit of bitterness in the back of the throat as an aftertaste, but nothing too strong.\n\nThe oil’s name, the \"Everyday\" blend, is right on par with what you can use it for. If you only have room in your pantry for one, this should be it. Pair with herbs for a great dipping oil, drizzle on salads, or use in a delicious olive oil cake. There are a few sizes available, too, so you can get one that fits your needs.\n\nAll of California Olive Ranch’s oils are certified extra virgin by a third-party lab that tests the chemical and sensory properties of the oil. The extra virgin olive oil is also certified kosher, verified non-GMO, and carries a seal from the Olive Oil Commission of California (OOCC).\n\nSize: 16.9, 25.4, and 33.8 ounces | Grade: Extra virgin | Processing: Cold-pressed | Origin: California, Argentina, Chile, and Portugal\n\nWhat We Like\n\nStrong taste\n\nSlightly thick consistency\n\nEasy to pour\n\nBeautiful bottle\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nExpensive\n\nA good dipping olive oil needs to have enough flavor to shine on its own or complement anything else that goes with it (like balsamic vinegar, spices, cheese, etc.). We taste-tested both of Heraclea’s extra virgin olive oil options, the Early Harvest and the Mature Harvest. The latter impressed us a lot…so much so that we refilled the testing bowl to keep dipping fresh bread into.\n\nIt has a strong flavor but is nothing overwhelming. It is slightly thick but easy to pour thanks to the bottle’s wide mouth and it coated our bread well during testing. It did not soak it to the core and make things mushy, and also coated our mouth well enough to leave a lasting flavor. In the end, we think this olive oil tastes like it belongs in a high-end restaurant served with warm bread and aged balsamic vinegar.\n\nOne bottle will cost you more than others on the market, but it is easily resealable and looks nice, making it a great addition to the countertop or gift.\n\nSize: 16.9 ounces | Grade: Extra virgin | Processing: Cold-pressed | Origin: Turkey\n\nWhat We Like\n\nSqueezable bottle\n\nMild flavor\n\nLarge size\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nDrips even when not squeezed\n\nWhile our favorite olive oil dispensers are not squeezable bottles, the trend has quickly taken off, and much of the thanks should be given to the brand Graza. We knew we needed to try this one out during our taste test, and admit we were surprised at how easy it is to use. There’s something about tipping the bottle over a hot pan, giving it a pinch, and watching the oil sizzle really makes you feel like a proper chef. (At least it did for us!)\n\nThe oil itself is not the most potent, grassy, and peppery EVOO out there, but that’s not too big of a deal when it is made to be cooked with. If you want an option with a bit more flavor, go for the brand’s Drizzle variety, which is made from Spanish olives harvested a month before those that go into Sizzle. Luckily, there is an option to buy both.\n\nOur only gripe with this large bottle is that during our initial test, we noticed it does drip when turned upside down, even if you’re not squeezing. Keep the cap twisted firmly counterclockwise to keep this from happening until you are 100 percent ready to use.\n\nWe've continued to use this option in our kitchen for a few months, and are still enjoying it. The oil itself has stayed fresh as far as we know, but we're mostly impressed with the bottle. At first, we didn't love how it dripped when turned upside down, but we have to admit we have dropped the entire thing from the cabinet onto the counter and the floor quite a few times. (Who else is a clumsy cook?) Despite this, no oil has spilled and the plastic bottle is still in tact.\n\nSize: 25.3 ounces | Grade: Extra virgin | Processing: Cold-pressed | Origin: Spain\n\nWhat We Like\n\nMild citrus flavor\n\nPerfect for dipping or drizzling\n\nEasy to pour\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nSmall bottle\n\nDespite being by far the smallest bottle of olive oil we tested, the Costabile Orange Infused Olive Oil surprised us more than any other. Other olive oils on the market are flavored with things like truffle, garlic, herbs, or spices, and while is it known that olive oil and citrus go well together, we were not expecting the flavor this bottle encapsulates.\n\nThe orange doesn’t hit your tongue until later, with the extra virgin olive oil taking center stage first, giving off a soft, smooth punch. The orange is almost unexpected but would work well on salads, vegetables, pasta, meat, fish, and in baked goods…or alone alongside fresh bread.\n\nOur one complaint about this flavored olive oil is the size of the bottle. Everything else about it is wonderful—it has a drop-free cap so there is no mess when pouring, and comes in a UV-safe dark glass bottle. It is tall but skinny, and only comes with 8.45 ounces of oil. It is an expensive option for the price, especially if you are like us and end up using a lot each time you pull it out because it is that delicious. However, it is a really great option to give as a gift.\n\nThis is another olive oil we have tested long-term, and it is just as good over six months later as it was then. The smell and flavor is still strong,\n\nSize: 8.45 ounces | Grade: Extra virgin | Processing: Cold-pressed | Origin: Italy\n\nWhat We Like\n\nStrong but not overwhelming taste\n\nEasy to pour\n\nGrassy, smooth smell\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\ntin can dent easily\n\nWe first taste tested this olive oil plain and with a piece of fresh bread, but immediately knew there were some flavor undertones—like nuts and citrus—that are often found in desserts. So we got to baking! (And ignored the dent on the side of the large tin we got, which did not affect the quality of the oil as far as we know.)\n\nWe made an olive oil cake that calls for a little over 1 cup of olive oil, plus more for covering the springform pan and brushing onto the baked cake. Partanna’s EVOO not only made it moist, but helped bring out a fresh, floral taste and smell. The orange, lemon, and sugar in the ingredients also brought down the EVOO's grassiness but didn’t overshadow it.\n\nIf you’re not convinced, let us say that we have years of research and many tins behind this pick. \"Partanna has been my olive oil of choice for almost all cooking and baking for around a decade,\" says Senior Food Editor Megan Scott, who admits she buys enough to always have a backup in the pantry. \"It's a highly versatile olive oil because it has a nice, rich flavor without being overwhelmingly peppery or grassy, so it's right at home in baked goods as well as savory cooking.\"\n\nSize: 34 ounces | Grade: Extra virgin | Processing: Cold-pressed | Origin: Italy\n\nWhat We Like\n\nSmooth\n\nMade with organic Spanish olives\n\nWide pouring spout\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nNot as easy to find\n\nLa Tourangelle has quite an array of oils, but this one surprised us more than its counterpart, the Bright and Peppery Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Despite its name—Smooth and Fruity—we found this one to be the more flavorful of the two.\n\nDuring our taste test, this one was soft at the beginning then gave way to a mellow taste that still hit the back of the throat. The brand’s other option other did not. The oil was easy to pour from the large circular aluminum can. It may be hard to grip for those with limited mobility or strength in the arms or hands—but the spout has a lip, making the actual pour smooth with no mess.\n\nOne Internet search will tell you this newer EVOO is not as widely available as the other version. It’s still worth it, though, especially if you’re looking for a high-quality organic option. La Tourangelle sources its certified organic olives from Andalucia, Spain—the ones that go into the Smooth and Fruity oil are harvested earlier in the season and cold-pressed soon after harvesting.\n\nSize: 25.4 ounces | Grade: Extra virgin | Processing: Cold-pressed | Origin: Spain\n\nWhat We Like\n\nLight and grassy taste\n\nEasy to reseal\n\nGood option for gifting\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nExpensive\n\nIt only took one taste for us to become convinced that Brightland’s Alive extra virgin olive oil belongs on top of a bed of leafy greens. We were very impressed with the light, subtle taste that still was peppery but smooth. The consistency is also thinner than some other EVOOs on the market, making it ideal for covering lettuce.\n\nBut, honestly, the greens are not required. The taste is so smooth and grassy that it adds the flavor of spinach, romaine, arugula, watercress, and other greens on its own—so that means it is great on salads that don’t have any of those involved, like a fruit salad, a fennel and avocado salad, or a black bean and rice salad.\n\nThis popular one is a bit pricier than others, but should last if you are only using a few tablespoons as a salad dressing. (We still are using it after pouring the oil over quite a few simple arugula salads with lemon juice, salt, and pepper over the span of around six months.) The cork-style cap makes it easy to reseal, too. It also makes a great gift—it comes in a pack of two with the brand’s other EVOO option \"Awake\" on Amazon.\n\nSize: 12.7 ounces | Grade: Extra virgin | Processing: Cold-pressed | Origin: California\n\nWhat We Like\n\nFlavorful\n\nMade from the signature EVOO\n\nCan be purchased individually\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nExpensive\n\nBottles scratch somewhat easily\n\nOlive oil is the perfect food item to give as a gift…it is versatile enough to use in lots of ways around the kitchen. After tasting the three flavors in this set, we instantly knew it was one that would be great for gifting to someone as a housewarming, holiday, birthday, or other kind of gift.\n\nThe Garlic is fragrant and lightly garlicky without any chunks or powders. The Spicy Red Pepper is just as its name describes—the kick it has isn’t super intense and fits in with most pallets and the darker reddish amber is unique amongst the three. The Greek Herb & Lemon might be our favorite of the bunch because of how refreshing it tastes. All three are infused with the flavors but are made from the brand’s signature cold-pressed Extra Virgin Olive Oil. We love that while these come in a set of three for a relatively high price, the Garlic is sold individually on Amazon.\n\nPart of a good gift goes beyond what the product is—it’s also about what it looks like. These three bottles are slim and smooth, covered in matte white, and come in a blue box. The company packages them so they don’t bump into each other during shipping, which is much appreciated because the bottles can be scratched. Ours have a few blemishes but luckily they aren’t too noticeable.\n\nAs of early 2024, the Tasting Trio now comes with the Spicy Red Pepper, Garlic, and the Original Extra Virgin Olive Oil, as the Greek Herb & Lemon flavor is sold out.\n\nSize: 12.7 ounces | Grade: Extra virgin | Processing: Cold-pressed | Origin: Greece\n\nWhat We Like\n\nGrassy and strong flavor\n\nVersatile\n\nGreat for stocking the pantry\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nDoesn't have a strong smell\n\nSometimes when you go for the \"budget\" option you are left with food less flavorful and underwhelming. Our testing process was not blind, but if it were we probably would not have guessed the price of this one. There is not an overwhelming olive oil smell that enters the air when you open or pour this EVOO, so it came as a big surprise when we tasted this one on a piece of bread and via the traditional olive oil tasting method in the palm of our hand. Sure, smell is a big factor in flavor, but it doesn’t affect it in this case.\n\nFilippo Berio’s Extra Virgin Olive Oil is grassy, bold, and makes you cough. (It is a cold-pressed blend of olives from five countries and 100 percent olive oil while some other budget options are not.) It would be a great, cheaper addition to any pantry—and comes in a plethora of sizes from 8.4 to over 100 ounces—at a reasonable price. The brand recommends using it for cooking under 400 degrees Fahrenheit, or for marinating, drizzling, or sautéing. We think it makes a good dipping oil, too, especially mellowed out with some cheese or balsamic vinegar.\n\nSize: 8.4, 16.9, 25.3, 50.7, and 101.4 ounces | Grade: Extra virgin | Processing: Cold-pressed | Origin: Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Tunisia\n\nWhat We Like\n\nOlivey and grassy taste\n\nLarge, beautiful bottle\n\nPours slowly\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nPours slowly\n\nOlive oil and wine have long been used in many of the same meals and dishes, so we aren’t embarrassed to admit that pulling this option out of the box made us think we got wine instead of a large bottle of olive oil. Upon tasting it, we weren’t too disappointed.\n\nThis is a typical EVOO; it is smooth, slightly grassy, and not too peppery, but still hits the back of the throat. At 25.3 ounces, which is about 0.75 liters or a little over 1.5 pounds, this option should last you a few loaves of bread. We love, though, that because of its design, it is a great EVOO to keep out on the counter or table. (Especially if you can’t fit it in your pantry.) Its dark glass will also keep out any light to aid in keeping it from spoiling.\n\nDespite its size, the oil comes out very, very slowly, which is a blessing and a curse. It makes it take longer to get the appropriate amount out, but this helps reduce the amount of oxygen going into the bottle so the olive oil stays fresher longer. With the bottle’s size, this is extremely important.\n\nSize: 25.3 ounces | Grade: Extra virgin | Processing: Cold-pressed | Origin: Spain\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nWe love California Olive Ranch Everyday Extra Virgin Olive Oil for its versatility, taste, and price and think it would make an excellent everyday olive oil. During testing, though, we were super impressed with how Partanna Extra Virgin Olive Oil tasted when we used it in baking.\n\nHow to Taste Olive Oil\n\nAlthough dipping your favorite bread into it is a delicious option, there is a traditional way of tasting olive oil that allows you to get all the flavors and notes that make an EVOO one-of-a-kind.\n\n\"If you want to taste the way that professionals do, pour a small amount of the extra virgin olive oil into a little glass,\" says Dino Borri, the Global VP at Eataly. \"First, warm the glass up in your hands and get a sense of the aroma. Then, take a drink of it and push it from the front to the back of your tongue, ensuring that you cover your entire palette.\"\n\nArmando Manni, the founder of Manni Olive Oil notes that taking a sip of extra virgin olive oil this way should make you cough at least twice, and your mouth should be dry but your lips wet. You should start salivating and the bitterness of the oil should go away pretty quickly, turning into sweetness.\n\nWhile this method is great for getting to know an olive oil, it is also helpful in determining if the oil is still good to use and not rancid.\n\nHow We Tested\n\nThis list of our favorite olive oils is a few years in the making. When sourcing olive oils to taste, we consulted our previous list, as well as some of the most popular brands out there. We also scoured the internet to see what other olive oil lovers are using as their olive oil of choice. Once we had a nice list, we got our hands on 25 different brands and varieties in a range of flavors and sizes. We gathered these from companies and purchased others ourselves, testing them all in succession over the course of two days.\n\nWe used two methods to taste test—placed about a tablespoon in our hand and allowed it to warm up, then sipped it in the traditional olive oil tasting way, letting the oil coat our mouth and throat. We also dipped fresh bread into small bowls of just the olive oil, no seasonings additions included. Of course, we also gave each a good sniff, noting any whiffs of grass, olives, fruit, and more. We then categorized the oils in our favorites for things like cooking, baking, finishing, etc., and then used some for those tasks. For example, we made an olive oil cake, sautéed vegetables, and drizzled olive oil over salads to finalize our list.\n\nAfter this initial round of testing, we continued to use several options on salads, in baked goods, while cooking, and for more simple dipping in order to gather more in-depth, real-world insights into how the oils perform and taste every day.\n\nWhat to Look for When Buying Olive Oil\n\nGrade\n\nOlive oil that is safe to consume comes in three grades—extra virgin, virgin, and refined. The differences in these create the flavor, density, color, aroma, and taste of the oil. We like extra virgin because of the quality and flavor, and it's usually considered the highest grade. It has an acidity above refined olive oil at 0.3 percent but no higher than 0.8 percent, whereas virgin has 2 percent or less. The fourth grade of olive oil is that which is not meant for eating. This oil has a high acidity or a very low acidity and is used in a variety of ways including lamp fuel, as a beauty product, and more.\n\nProcessing\n\nWhen it comes to extra virgin olive oil, look for one that mentions “cold pressed” on the label. \"Cold Pressing is crucial in making a high-quality EVOO,\" says Pia Baroncini, the co-founder of Baroncini Import & Co. because it is only mechanical, not chemical. Chemical and heated processing creates the other types of olive oil, adjusting the taste, smell, and color, which may or may not be useful to you.\n\nHarvest Date\n\nA bottle of olive oil will have a \"best by\" date on it, but the real key is a \"harvest date\" that tells you exactly when the olives that made the oil were plucked from their trees. Experts like Manni say that as soon as olive oil is pressed, the oxidation process begins—so it’s important to know how old the oil is.\n\n\"Unlike wine, EVOO is best consumed close to its harvest date,\" echoes Baroncini, adding that the closer to the harvest date and further from the best-by date you are, the better.\n\nBottle Color\n\nThe color, taste, and smell of olive oil are not only affected by oxygen, but other things as well. \"Extra virgin olive oil is sensitive to light, so it should never be kept in the sun and the best packaging for it is a can or a dark-colored glass bottle,\" says Borri.\n\nBe sure to close the bottle after each use to prevent oxidization, which can impact the taste.\n\nUse\n\n\"When looking to purchase olive oil, the first question is always – what are you buying it for? Are you cooking with it, or will it be more for dressing?\" says Borri. He recommends every household have a neutral, basic extra virgin olive oil in the pantry for everyday cooking, baking, sautéing, and more.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow is olive oil made?\n\nThe first step in making olive oil is harvesting olives from trees, which are then brought to a mill where leaves and stems are removed from the fruit. They are then washed and crushed into a paste. The paste is then stirred for up to 40 minutes and then sent through a centrifuge which separates the oil from olive pieces. By this combination of crushing and mechanical extraction, we get the extra virgin olive oil that we know and love. Other varieties are bleached or refined after.\n\nHow long does olive oil last?\n\nTypically, olive oil has a shelf life of anywhere from 4 to 24 months, depending on the type of oil. For example, extra virgin oils tend to go bad much more quickly than virgin or refined options. In addition, an oil in a clear bottle or exposed to bright light will become spoiled and go rancid sooner.\n\nExperts agree that extra virgin olive oil should be opened and then immediately used. \"You would never open a bottle of wine and leave it open for 2 months or two weeks,\" says Manni. You enjoy it right away—so have the same attitude with EVOO.\n\nCan you fry with olive oil?\n\nContrary to popular belief, you can fry with olive oil as long as you make sure the temperature is in the correct range. Olive oil’s smoking point (the point at which it burns and smokes) is between 350 and 410 degrees Fahrenheit. When frying food, the oil’s temperature should remain between 350 and 370 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIf you don’t trust us, trust history. \"Grandmas all over the Mediterranean have been frying with EVOO for the last few millenniums,\" says Baroncini.\n\nHowever, you should still be careful. \"In Italy, we fry everything in extra virgin olive oil,\" explains Borri. \"That said, it is sometimes better to use another type of oil when frying, since extra virgin olive oil has a higher smoke point than other oils and is oftentimes more expensive.\"\n\nCan you substitute olive oil for vegetable oil?\n\nWhile olive oil can be used as a substitute for vegetable oil in most cases, it may be best to avoid doing so. EVOO has a much stronger and more noticeable taste than vegetable oil and has the ability to overtake the flavors in baked goods, like cakes or brownies.\n\nWhy Trust The Spruce Eats?\n\nAmanda McDonald is an editor at The Spruce Eats and has over seven years of experience researching, writing, and editing about all things food—from what new products are at the grocery store to chef-approved hacks that keep tricky leftovers fresh for days.
