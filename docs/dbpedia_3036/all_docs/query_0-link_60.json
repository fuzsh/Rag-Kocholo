        "text": "Join us for Olive Oil 101: Behind The Mill!\n\nJoin us on Sunday, October 13, from 2pm- 3:30pm for an immersive olive oil experience. Taste extra virgin olive oil, learn about its health benefits, explore production with a mill tour, & enjoy a seminar-style session on all things olive oil. Plus, savor our fresh 2024 Olio Nuovo.\n\nLocated at the gateway of Sonoma Valley in Californiaâ€™s wine country, The Olive Press makes the most highly awarded and acclaimed extra virgin olive oils made in the United States. We embody a commitment to environmental consciousness and responsible practices. From field to table, the entire process of olive oil production is meticulously designed to minimize its ecological footprint. Cultivating olives using organic and sustainable farming methods ensures soil health and biodiversity preservation. We use waste reduction techniques during the pressing process and add the remains back to our soil as compost. Additionally, by promoting local agriculture and supporting small-scale farmers, The Olive Press contributes to the economic sustainability of the community and minimizes freight by either growing or sourcing California olives."
