        "text": "People living in ancient Israel used olive oil about 8,000 years ago, according to a chemical analysis of pottery shards and vessels found in the northern part of the country. The discovery marks the earliest finding of olive oil in Israel, and possibly the entire Mediterranean, the researchers said. [Read full story on the olive oil discovery]\n\nPieced together\n\nResearchers found the broken pottery vessels in Northern Israel. The excavation, which lasted from 2011 to 2013, was part of an archaeological salvage excavation required by the government before the Netivei Israel Company could widen a highway in the area.

Two of the vessels are from 5800 B.C., and contain remnants of ancient olive oil. (Photo credit: Courtesy Israel Antiquities Authority.)\n\nCracked treasure\n\nOne of the reconstructed vessels with olive oil residue inside, which suggests that people during the Early Chalcolithic period were using olive oil as early as the 6th century B.C.

(Photo credit: Courtesy Israel Antiquities Authority.)\n\nChemical analyses\n\nTo make sure the ancient vessels once held olive oil, the researchers compared the chemical residues left on the ancient clay to those from a modern-day clay sample with 1-year-old olive oil inside. The analyses of the two were remarkably similar, they found. (Photo credit: Courtesy Israel Antiquities Authority.)\n\nHistorical find\n\nResearchers suspect people began domesticating olive trees about 8,000 to 6,000 years ago, but this is the earliest evidence of olive oil in the country of Israel.
