This olive jar is also unique because of the painted red “R”, likely the maker’s initial.\n\nSummary\n\nSpanish Olive Jar\n\nFrom Ciudad Trujillo, Dominica Republic\n\nDates to AD 1500–1570\n\nCollection\n\nHistorical Archaeology\n\nStory\n\nhttps://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/134/2023/04/historical-archaeology-spanish-olive-jars.mp3\n\nOlive jars were the ubiquitous storage and shipping containers for the Spanish-American colonies and evolved in shape and manufacturing technique over four centuries. They were used to ship olive oil, wine, honey, soap and other items. This particular one is an early style olive jar identified by its unique rim shape, handles and two-part manufacturing technique. It was found in the Dominican Republic and dates to the 16th century. It’s rare to find fully intact olive jars, and what makes this one even more unique is the “R” painted in red, which is likely the initial of the vessel’s maker.\n\nGifford Waters\n\nCollection Manager, Historical Archaeology*\n\nFlorida Museum of Natural History\n\nExhibit\n\nOn display Sept. 23, 2017-Jan. 7, 2018, Rare, Beautiful & Fascinating: 100 Years @FloridaMuseum celebrated the Museum’s rich history.
