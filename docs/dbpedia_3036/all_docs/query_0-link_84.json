        "text": "Harvest and processing\n\nThe timing of fruit harvesting varies depending on geographic location; in general, harvest occurs between September and February in the Northern Hemisphere and between March and September in the Southern Hemisphere. Olives are ready for harvest once they reach maturity. The timing of maturity is influenced by factors such as temperature, sunlight exposure, and soil moisture. Weather that is cool and damp, for example, can delay maturity and sometimes result in fruit being harvested before it has fully ripened in order to avoid risk of frost damage. By contrast, weather that is hot and dry can speed ripening, leading to a relatively brief harvest period. Fruit may be picked by hand or by mechanical harvesting. Once harvested, the fruit is washed clean with water.\n\nTo produce high-quality oil, olives must be ground the same day that they are harvested; in this way, the fruit is prevented from deteriorating prior to processing. Oil is obtained from freshly harvested olives by crushing them with a hammer mill, followed by grinding them to produce a paste. The paste is then stirred and softened through a process known as paste beating, or malaxation. Next, solids are separated from liquids via centrifugation, with the liquid portion subsequently subjected to vertical centrifugation to further separate water and fine particulate matter from the oil. After a rest period of 24 to 48 hours, the oil is filtered to remove any remaining particulate matter and is then placed in storage containers.\n\nGrades\n\nOlive oil is broadly classified into several different grades, the most widely known of which are extra-virgin and virgin. Grading is based on standards set forth by the International Olive Council and provides insight into the quality, production method, and best uses of a given olive oil product. Extra-virgin and virgin olive oils are defined by extraction only via mechanical methods; in other words, extraction without the use of heat or solvents. Extra-virgin oil is further distinguished by being free of defects (e.g., no particulate matter), by being fruity, and by having a free fatty acid content (expressed as oleic acid content) that is less than or equal to 0.8 gram per 100 grams. Virgin olive oil, by comparison, has a free fatty acid content between 0.8 and 2. Examples of other grades of olive oil include refined olive oil, which has a free fatty acid content of 0.3 or less and is flavorless and odorless, and Lampante virgin olive oil, which is virgin olive oil determined to have poor flavor and odor and be generally unfit for human consumption without additional processing.\n\nHealth benefits\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Olive oil is rich in antioxidants, including polyphenols, and in healthy monounsaturated fatty acids. Studies of olive oil have shown that its consumption, particularly in the form of extra-virgin olive oil, is associated with lowered risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus and with reductions in brain inflammation and amyloid-beta plaque formation, which are characteristic of Alzheimer disease. Studies in animals have shown that a diet rich in olive oil can in fact help protect against memory loss and learning impairment associated with dementia."
