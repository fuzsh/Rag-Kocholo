        "text": "I love cooking with butter and oil and the habanero oil has a fantastic flavor, but it is not for the fainted hearth, I mixed it with virgin oil to grill vegetables and sea salt, fabulous for Cactus leaves and if you like spicy you can add a bit for almost anything you cook to give it that extra kick! My breakfast scramble eggs go to the next level when I cooked them in butter and habanero oil with chopped green onions. Shrimp, shredded chicken for quick tacos with Pico de Gallo. This oil has the ability to infuse a spicy delicious flavor to my meals. I have shared it with my friends in England, and it has become a very popular oil for all of us.\n\nMy sister bought Lisbon Lemon for me years ago as a gift and I have been using it ever since. It's great on everything--even tuna fish sandwiches. I use it on sauteed veggies and as a finishing oil on anything going onto the table. The flavor is delightful and I always make sure we have enough on hand because running out is not an option in this household. We love it!\n\nI made a home made focaccia and Spaghetti all Nerano along with salad, we used it on everything, it was the perfect dipping balsamic with oil and focaccia, it made a beautiful salad dressing, and some accidently made its way accross my plate to the pasta and it went perfectly with the zucchini based sauce in my pasta. A beautiful balsamic!\n\nI look forward to the Olio Nuovo from Stonehouse every year. The variety pack in various sizes is the way to go. I love it unfiltered as it is clearly as fresh as it gets. Give it a try. Not everyone may be your favorite but always top quality at Stonehouse and fun to expand your olive oil palette.\n\nThis 10 liter container is easy to use and I (hope) will last me a while!!\n\nIt is convenient as long as you have the space to store a box approximately 1 foot x 1 foot x 1 foot.\n\nSo glad that I got it, I have already used it!\n\nThis is the most delicious seasoning you will try. I bought it for the first time while in California visiting and ordered some more all the way in North Carolina!"
