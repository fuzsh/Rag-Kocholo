        "text": "Ambition and a natural talent in the corporate world led Susan Hasslinger to her success at Leaning Ladder Premium Olive Oils and Vinegars.\n\nHer grandmother, Bessie Lee, ran her own restaurant, which influenced Susan’s instinctive capacity for running a business. Susan pursued the aspiration to launch her own business, allowing her to create healthy meals, serve wine, and embrace her community.\n\nBessie sold milkshakes in her roadside restaurant. Her vintage milkshake machine has since found its new home in the downtown Woodstock Leaning Ladder location. Although it is rarely used at Leaning Ladder, its legacy, like Bessie’s, lives on.\n\nIn 2013 the Leaning Ladder tasting boutique first opened its doors in downtown Woodstock, and then in 2020, introduced a cooking studio offering even more products and services. It features wines, extra virgin olive oils, infused and fused olive oils, gourmet foods, and balsamic vinegars. Fused olive oils are a fusion of flavors created when olive oil is crushed along with the whole fruit of lemons, oranges, herbs, or peppers. Infused olive oil has its flavor infused after the oil is extracted from the olives. Also in 2020 Leaning Ladder opened a booth inside the Cotton Mill Exchange at The Mill on Etowah.\n\nAn abundance of classes—hands-on and demonstrations—at Leaning Ladder allow patrons to explore new dishes. In a hands-on class, groups cook together with assistance and guidance from a professional chef instructor with step-by-step instructions on a menu of choice. Knife skills are taught as well. In demonstration classes, a chef instructor stands at the front of the class and demonstrates how to cook the dishes. With little to no hands-on experience, the classes are still interactive, and questions are recommended. Once each course is prepared, students can eat it and receive the recipes before they leave.\n\nSusan explains, “Since we opened our doors it’s always been about giving superior customer service and connecting our customers to high-quality gourmet olive oil and balsamic vinegar products from around the globe. Many people feel we are the perfect place to find a scrumptious gift. Others stock their pantries with our products to help make ordinary meals memorable. We are a little best-kept secret in Cherokee County.”\n\nLEANING LADDER RUSTIC GREEK PANZANELLA SALAD\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n4 tbsp. Leaning Ladder Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\n2 tbsp. Leaning Ladder Garlic Olive Oil\n\n2 tbsp. Leaning Ladder Champagne Wine Vinegar\n\n¼ cup sliced shallot or red onion\n\n2 tbsp. finely chopped fresh herbs, flat-leaf parsley and/or basil\n\n1 clove garlic, minced\n\n2 cups Tribeca Ovens French Baguette, cut into ½-inch cubes\n\n3 to 4 oz. feta cheese, cubed\n\n2 medium tomatoes, cut into small wedges\n\n1 small cucumber, cut into chunks\n\n½ large red or yellow bell pepper, seeded and cut into chunks\n\n½ cup black or kalamata olives, pitted\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nBEGIN THE FUN\n\nTo make the dressing, combine Leaning Ladder Champagne Wine Vinegar, shallot (or onion), salt and pepper, clove of garlic, Leaning Ladder Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and fresh herbs in a small bowl. Whisk thoroughly until combined. Set aside.\n\nThen, heat Leaning Ladder Garlic Olive Oil in a frying pan. Add the Tribeca Ovens French Baguette cubes and cook until golden on all sides. Combine the cooked bread cubes and all the remaining salad ingredients in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently but thoroughly. Serve at room temperature.\n\nPRINT RECIPE: Leaning Ladder Rustic Greek Panzanella Salad\n\nLEANING LADDER NEAPOLITAN HERB CHICKEN\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n¼ cup Leaning Ladder Neapolitan Herb Balsamic Vinegar\n\n1 tbsp. Dijon mustard\n\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n\n4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs\n\n3 to 4 tbsp. Leaning Ladder Garlic Olive Oil\n\n1 tsp. Charmaine’s Bread Dip or ½ teaspoon dried oregano and ½ teaspoon dried basil\n\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\nThis recipe works well on the grill, too! Make sure the grill is hot and chicken is cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees.\n\nBEGIN THE FUN\n\nIn a bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, oregano, and basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. In a gallon-size ZipLoc bag combine balsamic vinegar mixture and chicken. Marinate for an hour, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the chicken from the marinade before baking.\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly oil an ovenproof baking pan/dish and add the marinated chicken pieces; discard the extra marinade. Place baking pan into oven and roast chicken until completely cooked through, about 20 to 30 minutes. Serve hot over rice or vegetables garnished with additional drizzle of balsamic vinegar, parsley, or green onion, if desired.\n\nPRINT RECIPE: Leaning Ladder Neapolitan Herb Chicken\n\nLEANING LADDER LEMONGRASS-MINT MOJITO\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n4-6 fresh mint leaves plus a sprig for garnish\n\n1 ½ tbsp. simple syrup*\n\n1 tbsp. lime juice\n\n2 oz. light rum club soda\n\n1 tbsp. Leaning Ladder Lemongrass-Mint White Balsamic Vinegar\n\nMake simple syrup using eight ounces of water plus one cup of granulated sugar. Bring the water to a simmer in a saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add the sugar and stir until it completely dissolves. Remove the pan from the heat. Set aside to cool to room temperature.\n\nBEGIN THE FUN\n\nPlace mint, simple syrup, lime juice, and Lemongrass-Mint White Balsamic Vinegar in a highball glass.
