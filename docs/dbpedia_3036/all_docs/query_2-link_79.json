Here's some easy tips on how to use premium olive oil and why a single-source EVOO like Bona Furtuna is the best choice to enhance your meals with flavor.\n\n5 Reasons You Need More Olive Oil\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is a central part of the Mediterranean diet and one of the healthiest oils in the world. Read our post to find out more about the benefits of olive oil and why you should add more olive oil to your diet.\n\nMy husband loved it!\n\nI got this for my foodie husband for Father's day and he loved it! He prefers his olive oil \"grassy\" and this one is reminiscent of tomato vines with subtle grassy undertones. He also appreciates good farming practices and this company fits that bill too. I would recommend this one A+\n\n500 ml\n\n06/29/2023\n\nBona Furtuna\n\nThank you for the kind words. We take our commitment of bringing true Sicilian fare incredibly seriously and we love to hear when customers enjoy the product along with our green practices. Mangiamo!\n\nMy favorite olive oil!\n\nI have purchased this olive oil many times and will continue to do so. After trying other brands, this one is definitely my favorite. I love a full-bodied olive oil, a brand I can trust to deliver quality, and one that lives up to its positive reviews. I have no hesitation in recommending it. Itâ€™s really delicious!\n\n500 ml\n\n06/08/2023\n\nBona Furtuna\n\nClaudia, we couldn't agree more. The Forte is an absolute staple for the office. Personally, the Forte is my favorite drizzled on seafood."
