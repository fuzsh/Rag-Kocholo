        "text": "About Olive DeLuce\n\nOlive Suzanna DeLuce, the first art faculty member at the then-10-year-old Fifth District Normal School in Maryville, Missouri, was born the second daughter to Percival and Emma A. (Budlong) DeLuce in Oswego, New York, on July 27, 1888. Her family was rich in artistic merit, dating back to her great-great-grandfather Thomas Thompson (1776-1852) who studied with Sir Joshua Reynolds in London. She was, perhaps, destined to follow a professional career in the visual arts exemplified also by both her mother and father, each a trained and talented artist.\n\nIf there were any notable deviations from her ancestors’ career paths in art, it would be her own devotion to art education. At the age of 24 in 1912, and two years before her father’s death, Olive received, “A Special Diploma in Education,” for teaching fine arts from Columbia University, Teachers College in New York City. Only eight months later she was licensed by the City of New York as a substitute teacher of drawing in high schools and one month later also licensed as a substitute elementary teacher. In 1914, she taught at The Barnard School for Girls and on June 3 of that same year she received a Bachelors Diploma in Education and a Bachelor of Science degree from Columbia University, where Arthur Wesley Dow, a pioneer in art education, was her advisor and a major influence on her life.\n\nThat following September, Olive began her teaching career at Ohio University in Athens, and the next year she moved further west to Maryville, Missouri, to found the fine arts program at the Fifth District Normal School. Olive lived in a house on Fourth Street now located directly across from the University’s Bearcat Stadium. While teaching in Maryville, she continued her studies at Columbia University and, on June 4, 1924, earned a Master of Arts degree from the institution.\n\nOlive’s contributions to the Normal School were numerous, including establishing art works as senior class gifts, thereby beginning the University Art Collection. She also founded the Art Club, one of the first campus student organizations. Throughout her tenure, she became well connected with artists and arts organizations in the Midwest region of the county.\n\nIn 1928, she headed the Art Education Commission of the American Federation of the Arts and presided at the group’s sessions at the Federation’s national convention in Denver, Colorado. She was a member of the College Art Association (now the preeminent national arts organization in the USA), the Midwest Art Association, and the Midwest College Art Association. In 1941, she began her term as president of the Department of Art Education of the National Art Education Association. As vice president she planned the program for the Department’s national convention in Boston, at which the internationally renowned architect Walter Gropius gave the primary address. She was also active in the Kansas City Society of Artists, the Missouri State Teachers Association, the American Association of University Women (serving several terms as a state and regional chair), and several other instrumental state organizations.\n\nShe nurtured her own continuing education by studying in 1933, 1934 and again in 1936 in Paris, France, at the Sorbonne (University of Paris); the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, where she studied with Georges Goetz and André L’Hote, a Cubist artist; and at the Ecole du Louvre. In the United States, she traveled to Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado and other locations in the Southwest to paint.\n\nAmong others, her exhibition venues included The Art Institute of Chicago; Kansas City Midwest Artists, Kansas City Art Institute; St. Louis Art League, Society of Independent Artists, New York; and Columbia University.\n\nMiss DeLuce retired from teaching as division head of fine arts at Northwest Missouri State College in 1958. In 1965, the newly constructed Olive DeLuce Fine Arts Building was dedicated in her name.\n\nOlive DeLuce died in Liberty, Missouri, on Feb. 22, 1970, and she is buried at Miriam Cemetery in Maryville. The Percival DeLuce Memorial Collection was established in her will and the Northwest Missouri State College’s Board of Regents, in accepting the collection, agreed to the provisions set forth by the donor."
