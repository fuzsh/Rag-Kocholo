        "text": "It’s a cool December day in 2017, not long after Olga Orlova’s Santa Rosa home burned down in the Tubbs Fire. The young Capay Valley olive oil producer is preparing for a long day of milling when her phone rings. A voice on the other end says, “This is the governor of California, Jerry Brown.”\n\n“I thought it’s a joke,” says Orlova.\n\nAfter a polite “Hello, Governor of California Jerry Brown, how can I help you?” she learns that Brown’s 140 olive trees—recently transplanted to Mountain House, his ranch in Colusa County—have ripe olives. Olga Orlova, as he’s been told, is the person who can help him.\n\nTo fully appreciate the irony of a powerful national leader calling a young, recent immigrant for advice, let’s jump back a decade as Orlova is enjoying her first career developing recipes for a milk company in her native Russia. She longs to travel, and by 2010, she’s in San Francisco exploring logistics for becoming a mushroom farmer or perhaps a brewer.\n\nOn an evening in 2013, she’s in Santa Rosa, barbecuing for friends, and waxing eloquent on how a good grilled steak needs only salt, pepper, and olive oil, when someone mentions that olive oil is becoming a big thing in California.\n\n“Like, big thing in California, what do you mean?”\n\n“They make olive oil here, and right now the market has started growing in the U.S.”\n\n“But isn’t it a Mediterranean product?”\n\n“Yeah, everywhere wine grows, olives can grow.”\n\nWhile the group tucks into their unctuous olive oil–slathered steaks, Orlova further queries her California ag–savvy friends enough to determine that coaxing the delicious oil from this Biblical tree fruit might be her true calling. Within two weeks she’s leapt over a chasm of innocence and charmed her way into the orchards and mills of esteemed local olive oil producers, plus labs and offices of sundry top-level researchers, testers, and administrators, and is well along in her launch of Olica, a boutique olive oil company.\n\nFast forward four years, and this budding entrepreneur has racked up awards for her olive oils and simultaneously established a strong reputation for helping other small growers mill their fruit into high-quality oil (or acquire equipment and know-how to mill their own). That’s when the governor calls.\n\n“Honestly, we don’t know what we’re doing here,” she recalls Brown saying.\n\n“I go to his place. We need to harvest now,” says Orlova, who knows that oil of superior quality, such as the governor expects, can only be achieved when the olives are at a perfect, subtly pre-ripe moment and are milled immediately upon harvest before any deterioration sets in.\n\n“What time do we start?”\n\nBrown is just heading out to give then-President Trump an aerial tour of the fire devastation, but four cheerful, young, casually clad people hanging around Mountain House—who turn out to be the governor’s security contingent—help Orlova harvest the olives. Back at Olica central, she mills the olives and bottles up the oil, affixing the governor’s Mountain House label.\n\nWhile Orlova helps Brown learn about taking the product from tree to table, the two strike up a friendship. And when Orlova learns that he has it in mind to sell the bottles at Whole Foods, she has to break the sad news that being the governor of California paves no golden-green path toward getting this very limited supply of Mountain House olive oil out to the people of the Golden State via that particular venue.\n\nGiven the enduring resilience of the very long-lived, drought-tolerant olive tree and its enduring cultural role as a nurturer of humankind, it makes sense that an environmentalist governor might like to steward an orchard and pursue olive oil production in retirement. In fact, each person interviewed here was similarly attracted to the tree’s ecological story as well as to the abiding history of olive oil as a community enterprise.\n\nAnd, of course, there’s always the matter of olive oil’s great taste.\n\nThe Drama and the Mystery\n\nIn 2011, Kathryn Tomajan, cofounder and producer of the Oakland-based Fat Gold olive oil company, was a 20-something graduate student studying food culture and communications at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Pollenzo, Italy, when she got tricked by a master Tuscan olive oil producer into tasting a rancid olive oil. She thought, “It’s good—it tastes like olive oil,” a misconception all too common among consumers inured to the off flavors of inexpensive, outdated, and possibly ersatz supermarket olive oils. Tomajan quickly learned the difference.\n\n“I was really taken aback by the quality and adulteration scandals that are occurring globally in the olive oil trade,” she says. “That really was my hook into olive oil—the drama and mystery around it.”\n\nInfluenced in her thesis research by Tom Mueller’s then newly published exposé, Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil, Tomajan also delved into emerging reports from the UC Davis Olive Center by researcher Selina Wang, who as a young and recent immigrant from Taiwan had driven all over California collecting supermarket samples of oils marked extra virgin for the Center’s lab to analyze. The findings? “Reports said that many of our extra-virgin olive oils did not meet the extra virgin grade standards,” says Wang. From her current seat as the Center’s research director, Wang has now turned her attention to analyzing similar standards that can assist across California’s food landscape in a time of change.\n\nTomajan’s quest to understand how the fraud problem could be addressed took her to Australia, a major world olive oil producer, which, as she describes, was then “several years ahead of California in establishing mandatory, industry-wide quality standards.” She went back again to apprentice with a small Australian milling operation staffed entirely by women. “I don’t think it’s normal anywhere in the world to have women actually running the mills and doing the difficult work of managing production,” she says.\n\nTo school her palate, Tomajan participated in the (now defunct) UC Davis Sensory Panel and then moved on to join the California Olive Oil Council (COOC) Taste Panel, where she continues to participate in its evaluations for producers seeking extra virgin certification for its oils via rigorous lab and sensory testing. Three videos starring the convivial Tomajan on the COOC website are examples of her fast-developing role as a spokesperson for California olive oil.\n\nIn a discussion regarding Tomajan’s role in encouraging her peers, Orlova mentioned the series of personal/professional growth events Tomajan ran with three collaborators from 2011 to 2018 in locations around the country. Called Eat Retreat, the project encouraged participants working in many facets of food and agriculture to experience themselves as part of a community dedicated to strengthening the food system as a whole.\n\nOlive oil presents many challenges for a small producer, among them how to afford land for an orchard, how to harvest and mill quickly and cleanly enough to win extra virgin certification, where to mill if you can’t afford to buy your own equipment, how to market, and also how to convince consumers reaching for that cheap commodity supermarket oil that a small local producer’s product is worth the higher $20–$40 price tag. Sharing knowledge and resources is crucial to the endeavor.\n\nSynergies in Adopted Orchards\n\nIn 2017, Tomajan was making olive oil alongside one of her Eat Retreat collaborators at Enzo Olive Oil Co. in Madera when the inspiration to start her own olive oil company came along. A landowner in the Alameda County community of Sunol had a mature olive grove going untended and offered to let Tomajan take over harvesting the fruit in trade for maintaining the orchard. While Fat Gold now sources olives from growers in diverse locations (much the way urban winemakers buy their grapes), during that first year in Sunol, Tomajan started learning firsthand about orchard management, harvesting, milling, packaging, and marketing, all of which require a small producer to develop many relationships with others in this labor-intensive business for it to be affordable. (Note: Now in year four, Fat Gold is finally paying small salaries to Tomajan and partner Robin Sloan.)\n\nThe notion of adopting a field or an orchard was lionized by veteran organic farmer, writer, and olive oil producer Mike Madison in “The Beginning Farmer’s Plight,” his Fall 2015 article for Edible East Bay. The story outlines how and why a landowning farmer heading toward retirement could (and should) bring young aspiring partners into the enterprise for the sake of imparting knowledge and keeping fertile land in its valuable agricultural usage. Young farmers Susan Ellsworth and Colin Dixon were his test case, and the couple now steward some of Madison’s mature, organically farmed olive trees to make their Flatlands olive oil. They share Madison’s 100% organic facility, including the mill and a certified organic kitchen, where Madison’s wife Dianne makes olive oil cosmetics.\n\nSowing Wild Poppies\n\nIn a lovely hollow of the Santa Cruz Mountains, sisters-in-law Jamie de Sieyes and Kim Null landed a grove adoption opportunity similar to Tomajan’s along with a mentorship like Ellsworth’s.\n\nIn 2016, de Sieyes was tiptoeing from early motherhood back into her marketing career just as her sister-in-law, Null, also a young mother, was developing a passion for agriculture that would later blossom into EatLocal.Farm, a virtual sales model she spearheaded for the local grower community. The sisters-in-law had always wanted to grow a business together when an opportunity appeared as if to fulfill their wishes.\n\n“Just around the corner, a neighbor of ours has a beautiful olive orchard,” says de Sieyes, speaking of Chris Banthien, producer of the award-winning Olio del Le Colline di Santa Cruz, who planted her grove in 1996. “Having Chris be our mentor, that was the biggest piece of Wild Poppies coming into existence. It enabled us to work together and work near our homes, to work in our community, and to have an existing agricultural piece that was well nurtured and well cared for.”\n\nBanthien trained the duo in orchard management and showed them how to harvest using large electric shaking rakes. They learned about milling and bottling by working alongside their miller, Greg Traynor of 43 Ranch in San Ardo, California. But of equal importance has been the way Wild Poppies was nurtured by the local farmers’ market in Aptos.\n\n“[They] welcomed us as we transitioned from Chris’s brand to ours, and that was a key part of our business thriving that first few months,” says de Sieyes. The sisters-in-law have cultivated deep relationships with their customers, which include local tastemakers like Michelin-star chef David Kinch, who uses Wild Poppies Extra Virgin Olive Oil exclusively at his newest venture, Mentone in Aptos.\n\nIn this season when olive harvests have been light throughout most of California, the small supply of Wild Poppies’ 2020-harvest oil has been claimed almost entirely by Null’s EatLocal.Farm customers. “They kept us going this year after the restaurants closed down. My husband built a little mini barn next to the big barn where we can let customers come and pick up their olive oil and pick up their produce.”\n\nFlavor is the Hook\n\nIf a bottle or can of extra virgin olive oil from one of these small specialty producers might seem too dear for daily use, a cook interested in flavor (as well as health values) might consider what they could be missing.\n\n“Most mid- to large-scale producers are trying to make a consistent, relatively neutral-tasting, all-purpose olive oil to appeal to the masses,” says Tomajan. Conversely, her work at Fat Gold, like that of all the producers in this story, is about “honoring the diverse olive varieties planted here in California and milling them in a way that brings out the best of each cultivar.” She’s talking about bringing out maximum flavor, which is more expensive to produce.\n\nWhat is a cultivar? De Sieyes says the four young Wild Poppies children can pronounce the names of all the cultivars in their orchard…Ascolano, taggiasca, frantoio, Canino, leccino, maurino. The names reveal the cultivars’ Mediterranean origins, and each has been developed over many centuries to highlight distinct flavors. Part of the differing profiles comes from the mix and levels of polyphenols, the organic compounds found abundantly in plants, which, according to a 2018 National Institutes of Health abstract, “have become an emerging field of interest in nutrition in recent decades. A growing body of research indicates that polyphenol consumption may play a vital role in health through the regulation of metabolism, weight, chronic disease, and cell proliferation.”\n\nOn the table, an olive oil with high polyphenols is likely to provide a distinctly exciting pungency, which tickles the throat and can even make you cough. Try drinking some “neat,” as credentialed sensory testers do, or just drizzle enough onto a dish to see how a well-made oil adds layers of gorgeous flavor.\n\nOlga Orlova describes her Olica Picual as having a “tomato herbaceousness.” Her Chiquitita offers a “stone fruit nose like apricot and cherry and herbs.” The Coratina, with its high 460 polyphenol level, displays that robust pungency along with a vivid grassy flavor that stays in the imagination for hours or even years after the meal.\n\nWhen you purchase extra virgin olive oil:\n\nAlways check the harvest date, since olive oil is a fresh product that does not keep well for more than a few months, depending on how it’s stored.\n\nKeep it capped so it doesn’t oxidize.\n\nStore it away from heat.\n\nProtect it from light. Purchase only oil that’s packaged in an opaque container.\n\nAnd a most important last piece of advice:\n\nExplore the treasures from your local extra virgin olive oil producers to discover all there is to enjoy and support. ♦\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nThe Making of a California Olive Oil Culture (Edible East Bay, Winter 2012)"
