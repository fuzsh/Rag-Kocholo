        "text": "In the \"gramolatura\" the paste is then \"malaxed\" - slowly churned - for around 20 to 40 minutes in order to facilitate the small droplets of oil released by the milling process to aggregate and be more easily separated.\n\nDuring the grinding and malaxation stages the action of fruit enzymes gives each olive oil its particular aroma.\n\nAfter malaxation the paste is pumped to a phase separator - a decanter centrifuge.\n\nThe centrifuge rotates at approximately 3000 rpm, separating the three phases of solids, vegetation water, and olive oil via their different densities.\n\nThere is also a coil within the centrifuge that rotates at a few rpm slower and pushes the solid materials out of the system.\n\nThis photograph shows the olive oil and water leaving the centrifuge by two different channels.\n\nAt the end of the extraction process, the first cold press olive oil - \"olio extravergine\" - leaves the machine and is collected in a large steel container, from which containers for each participating olive grower are filled.\n\nNOTE: The terms \"first cold press olive oil\" and the Italian version, \"olio extravergine prima spremitura\", are both misnomers as there is no second press of virgin olive oil. The names tend to be used on olive oil bottle labels to infer a premium quality.\n\nThis brown mountain grows at a pace during the weeks that the olives are pressed.\n\nIt is the \"pomace\" paste - the \"sansa di olive\" - that remains after the virgin olive oil is extracted from the olives.\n\nThe pomace still contains a small quantity - about 2% to 6% - of oil that may only be extracted with chemical solvents. The oil produced in this way is called \"pomace oil\" and is sometimes used for cooking in the catering trade."
