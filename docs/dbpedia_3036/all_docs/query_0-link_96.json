        "text": "In our ambitious quest to find the best olive oils, we tested more than 100 bottles over a two-week period. The good news? We found plenty of olive oils we loved at every price level. The bad news? We also found bottles we really really didn’t like too.\n\nThe particularly upsetting part is that even the bottles we did like upon first taste were no longer as vibrant when we tasted them again, one week later. That’s why we suggest buying a reasonably priced (whatever that means to you) extra-virgin olive oil from the most recent harvest, storing it smartly, and using it with abandon every morning, noon, and night. Get through it while it’s still fresh!\n\nIn fact, several of our Test Kitchen editors admit to only keeping one bottle of olive oil in their kitchens for cooking, baking, dressing salads, and adding a finishing drizzle to dishes that need it. If you, too, are that type of cook, you’ll be set with the highest scoring olive oil in our roundup: Monini GranFruttato Extra-Virgin Olive Oil.\n\nBut, like I said, we picked a few other top contenders. For our methodology and the full list of oils we tasted, scroll to the bottom. But first: our picks for the best olive oils of 2021.\n\nBest olive oil overall: Monini GranFrutatto\n\nThis top-scoring Italian blend is balanced with a lingering peppery bite. Senior editor Maggie Hoffman found it grassy with sage-like undertones. It also tastes, unmistakably, of olives (which, funny enough, you can’t say for every brand).\n\nOne thing that may contribute to this bottle retaining its freshness and vibrancy is that the manufacturer has installed a “pop-up pourer” underneath the cap, which limits the amount of oxygen that can get in. (Remember: Oxygen, heat, and light can all turn a good oil bad.) Use this bottle in any and all olive oil applications.\n\nMonini Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBest budget-friendly olive oil: Colavita Italian Blend\n\nWe found this Italian olive oil floral with a nice aroma and a touch of peppery flavor. While some bottles in this category were insipid or watery, this hits the middle of the mark in terms of pungency (that is to say, it’s neither a mild flavor nor an extremely robust flavor—it fell into a happy place in between). Tasters also noted flavors of bitter almond, green pepper, marjoram, and citrus.\n\nColavita Premium Italian Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nWe also liked Merula Extra-Virgin Olive Oil. For a milder option around $20, go for this Spanish blend. Commerce editor Emily Johnson found it to have a soft herbal flavor reminiscent of sage or oregano. The delicate flavor would play well in both sweet and savory bakes or in cooking something like scrambled eggs, where a hint of olive oil is nice, but a bold oil may be overpowering.\n\nMerula Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nCalifornia Olive Ranch Everyday also stood out among the pack. Although California Olive Ranch has faced a bit of backlash following its transition from 100-percent California-grown olive oil to its Destinations Series, which sources from varied olive oil ports to cope with variations in the harvest due to climate change, we found that we still liked this Test Kitchen standby. It’s mild, nutty, and rich. And even if isn’t the most exciting and vibrant oil on the roster, we’d still use it for cooking every day.\n\nCalifornia Olive Ranch Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBest midrange olive oil: Monini D.O.P. Umbria\n\nThis oil has a distinct savoriness—almost like rosemary—that would make it play well with something sweet. Emily called out an underlying “creaminess” that made her want to pair it with an orange-loaded salad. Of course, we’d also be happy to drizzle it over a meat and cheese platter, garnish a bowl of winter-squash soup, or bake it into a quick and delicious apple cake.\n\nMonini D.O.P. Umbria Olive Oil\n\nBest high-end olive oil (bold and fruity): Calivirgin Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nIf you’re looking for a fresh olive oil that’s bold and bracing, balanced by a fruity flavor, here’s your bottle. The unfortunately named Calivirgin had an intense, spicy finish, offering a sweet fruitiness alongside vibrant grassy, almondy flavors.\n\nCalivirgin Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nWe also liked Olive Oil Jones: Siena Tuscany. For a milder, buttery option, pick up a bottle of Olive Oil Jones’s Tuscan blend. While it still boasts a peppery back note, up front it’s all lush almonds and apricots with an herbal whisper.\n\nOlive Oil Jones Siena Tuscan Early Harvest Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBest olive oil splurge (grassy and tannic): Brightland Alive\n\nInstead of spring grass, this Instagram star has an essence of grass clippings and wet leaves. It tastes stemmy and woody, its warmth and spice paired with unabashed bitterness and a tannic quality. This isn’t the oil for everyone, but several of our tasters adored it.\n\nWhat we were looking for in the olive oils\n\nWe set out to find the best extra-virgin olive you could buy in a large cross section of America’s grocery stores, plus a few that could easily be purchased online.\n\nSince olive oil is best used quickly, most of our editors (myself included) tend to just keep one bottle around. So instead of focusing on two bottles being the “best for cooking” or the “best for finishing,” we focused on finding the most crowd-pleasing bottles in an assortment of price ranges. Because, honestly, we can tell you what we think is best, but you’re gonna do what you want with it as soon as you get it home.\n\nCalling one bottle “the best” is also a tricky business. As with any crop that fluctuates from year to year, the taste of olive oil changes from year to year. And, just as different varieties of grapes produce differently flavored wines, different varieties of olives produce differently flavored oils, and everyone’s preferences are different.\n\nAfter scouring Internet best-of lists and digging through the highest-rated oils on popular buying sites, we gathered blends and single-varietal oils from around the world.\n\nYou’ll notice that we selected only extra-virgin olive oils, as opposed to straight olive oil or light olive oil. The reason for this is simple: Bottles labeled extra-virgin olive oil (a.k.a. EVOO) are the purest form of olive oil. It’s made entirely of natural cold-pressed olives. A light or regular olive oil, on the other hand, will include processed oils as well. Those additional processed oils yield an olive oil that lacks the tell-tale flavor and aroma of an EVOO.\n\nHow we tested the olive oils\n\nA group of Epicurious editors and staff sampled the olive oils over a two-week period in a blind olive oil tasting. All oils were opened just before they were poured into unmarked containers. Oils were tasted first in groups according to price range. We sipped the oils plain, then dipped baby romaine lettuce leaves and bread cubes in the oils to see how they fared as a drizzling oil, and tasted them with thin slices of green apple and grapes to test the oils’ partnership with acidity.\n\nWe then tasted our top 20 olive oils (the top three to five in each price range) in a second blind tasting, where the oils were again unmarked and arranged in random order. For all tastings, editors were asked to sample the oils in a random order to avoid issues of palate fatigue.\n\nOther olive oils we tasted\n\nIn our tireless quest to find the best extra-virgin olive oils, we scoured the internet for best-of lists and dug through the highest-rated oils on popular buying sites. We gathered blends and single-varietal oils from around the world and sourced oils only from the previous year’s harvest. Whenever shopping for high-quality olive oils, choose oils from the current or previous year. The harvest date can be found on the label of most bottles if you look closely. Here is a comprehensive list of all bottles we sampled along the way.\n\nBudget olive oils:\n\nOrigin 846 Unfiltered Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Robust Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nCarapelli Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nTerra Delyssa Organic Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\n365 Everyday Value Mediterranean Blend Olive Oil\n\n365 Everyday Value Italian Blend\n\nAmazon Fresh Organic Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBertolli Rich-Taste Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBertolli Organic Bold-Taste Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBertolli Bold-Taste Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nNapa Valley Naturals Northern California/Mediterranean Sweet and Fruity Blend\n\nBertolli Organic Rich-Taste Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBotticelli Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nAmazon Fresh Mediterranean Blend Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Smooth Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\n365 Everyday Value California Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nNapa Valley Naturals Everyday Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian 100% Spanish Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nMediterranean Organic Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Robust Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBertolli Organic Smooth-Taste Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBertolli Northern/Southern Argentina/Italy/Portugal/Spain Smooth Blend\n\nMid-tier olive oils:\n\nMonini Nocellara Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nColavita Premium Selection Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nCalifornia Olive Ranch Destination Series Rich and Robust Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nKouzini Greek Premium Raw Unfiltered Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nOilladi Greek Manaki Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nDeCecco Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nO-Live & Co Everyday Mild & Fruity Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nCorto Truly Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nMonini Frantoio Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBurroughs Family Farms California Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nCalifornia Olive Ranch Reserve Collection Arbosana Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nColavita Mediterranean Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nCalifornia Olive Ranch Reserve Collection Arbequina Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nMonini Family Blend Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Organic Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nKouzini Greek Premium Organic Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nWild Groves Extra-Virgin Olive Oil: Kitchen Blend\n\nOzelia Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nKouzini Greek Premium Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nColavita Organic Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nFilippo Berio Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nCalifornia Olive Ranch Destination Series Mild & Buttery Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nNapa Valley Naturals Organic Extra-Virgin Olive Oil\n\nO-Live & Co.
