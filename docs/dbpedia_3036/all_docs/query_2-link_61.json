        "text": "The Tablas Creek Vineyard Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a blend of mostly Manzanilla and a few Mission olives, grown on our certified organic estate vineyard. We have roughly 100 trees that line our roads. We harvest these trees by hand in late November each year, our last harvest of the vintage. Depending on the year, we get between 25 and 100 gallons of oil.\n\nThe fruit was harvested into half-ton picking bins and processed at a local certified organic facility. The oil settled in our cellar for two months, and then was bottled: estate grown, certified organic Tablas Creek olive oil."
