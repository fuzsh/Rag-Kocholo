Without all of you, there would be no Olive Us!\n\nCheck here for updates and hours or shop.oliveusoils.com to order online for in-store pick up or shipping across Canada! ðŸ¤—\n\nLove from the Olive Us Fam\n\nWhen you open the door to world-class, ultra fresh olive oils, balsamic vinegar and sea salts for the first time, itâ€™s like walking into that Wonka dudeâ€™s chocolate factory, or seeing your first 3D movie on the big screen. Thatâ€™s sure how it was for us. After that first time, we were hooked. In fact, the more we tasted and learned, the more convinced we became, that this was something we absolutely must share. We loved it so much, that we chucked our old careers in order to open a store in our home town of Vernon, B.C.\n\nWhat we discovered was that these amazing products were not only incredibly tasty and versatile, but they also had phenomenally healthy properties. You donâ€™t have to tell yourself that these products are good for you, the yum factor alone is convincing enough. Sure, itâ€™s great to know that the high concentration of polyphenols in extra-virgin olive oil mean a powerful antioxidant with significant health benefits, but whoâ€™s thinking of that when it tastes so great on a salad or as an all natural butter-flavored infusion drizzled over your popcorn? With dozens of different types of products to pair with pretty much any food ingredient out there, the creative possibilities in your kitchen are virtually endless. We have heaps of suggestions and recipes to get you started, so thereâ€™s no shortage of ideas to help.\n\nThe Ultra Premium (UP) standard for extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) is reserved for the finest extra virgin olive oils in the world. As such, the UP grade exceeds all existing European, Italian, Spanish, Greek, North American, Californian, or any other standard for the grade known as extra virgin olive oil. In order to qualify for the UP grade, the extra virgin olive oil must meet or exceed a comprehensive set of Production, Storage, Transportation, Testing, Chemistry, and Organoleptic requirements. To learn more about Ultra Premium EVOO, click here.\n\nNow weâ€™ve added so much more! Can you say out-of-this world artisan pasta? Heck yes you can and we think Pappardelleâ€™s makes the best, so thatâ€™s what we have for you. Pack a picnic or create a fabulous charcuterie board (including the board!)! Weâ€™re also offering some of the most incredible boutique offerings from local and regional artists and food wizards you can imagine. These include amazing chocolates, jams, jellies, relishes and other preserves. Youâ€™re going to fall in love with the gorgeous pottery and hand-painted glassware to store and serve these products too. We also create beautiful custom gifts, baskets and special event favours. These are not the kind of things youâ€™ll get from big-box retailers either. Now you can personalize a truly unique, tasty, and healthy culinary experience. Best of all, you can have fun doing it! In fact, we think thatâ€™s such a core concept, that we print it right on our bottles â€“ Go Ahead, Play with Your Food!\n\nHow about a jump start? With so many wonderful flavors and products to combine in practically endless combinations, itâ€™s sometimes a little challenging to know where exactly to start. Even if youâ€™re a seasoned veteran, itâ€™s nice to have tested ideas from others at your disposal. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve put together this Cheat-Sheet Handy Reference Guide and Pairing Suggestions doc for you. CLICK HERE to DOWNLOAD . Then simply click the Back Button on your browser once youâ€™ve downloaded or printed the PDF doc."
