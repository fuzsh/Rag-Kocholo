        "text": "Our First Olive Oil Trees\n\nWe are proud to announce the first planting of our Olive Trees surrounding the Castle in Napa Valley. Watch above as President Georg Salzner & vineyard manager David Bejar plant our first olive trees at The Castle! This continues our recent string of sustainability efforts at the Castle.\n\nWe planted 12 different varieties of Olive Trees surrounding Castello di Amorosa, these olive trees are known to make a superior olive for oil production. Many of these trees originate in Italy. We look forward to the first fully mature harvest in which we can produce our first olive oil.\n\nWe are planting a total of 12 different olive tree varietals that surround the Castle. You can learn more about each specific type of Olive tree below.\n\nFrantoio\n\nIf asked to pick our favorite olive in the bunch, that answer might just be the Frantoio olive. Frantoio Olive Oil is one of the most highly acclaimed oil varieties in the world, especially in the Tuscan regions of Italy. The olive boasts a stunningly dark, oval-shaped olive. Preferred picking time is early, while olives are still green and purple.\n\nThe flavor has been described as very fruity, notably aromatic and of high quality, with a stronger aftertaste than Leccino. The aftertaste has been described of almond and herbs.\n\nThis fast-growing Olive tree is known for its high yielding nature. They can reach a full grown height of 26 feet. It is known to produce plenty of plump medium-sized Olives, which are known to produce quality oil. They can also make a delicious treat when cured. These Olives are about 80% pulp, and they have a pleasant fragrance.\n\nOlive Origin: Tuscany, Italy\n\nOlive Color: Green-Purple, Purple-Black\n\nOlive Pairing: Grilled Meat, Bruschetta, Legume & Vegetable Soups, Dressing Fresh Salads.\n\nOlive Flavors: Fruity flavor with bitter and spicy notes. Aromas of fresh herb, tomato, lettuce, artichoke, apple, grain, rosemary, celery and almond.\n\nUnique Traits of the Frantoio Olive\n\nMost commonly the main component for a Tuscan style oil.\n\nConsistently produces a high-yield, very fruity oil.\n\nThe medium size fruit ripens on the late side.\n\nA self-compatible tree, but will benefit greatly from other pollinators.\n\nOne of the most popular olives in the world.\n\nGrows More like Tree Than Bush\n\nLeccino\n\nOriginated in Tuscany, grows very well in California and the northwest. Its olive oil flavor is delicate so it’s most commonly blended with Pendolino. But it’s also interplanted and blended with Frantoio, Coratina and Moraiolo to produce more flavor.\n\nAs mentioned above, Frantoio and Leccino cultivars are the principal raw material for Italian olive oils from Tuscany. Leccino has a very sweet and aromatic flavor.\n\nA Small fruit with very small pit, it has a surprising amount of flesh. The fruit is purple-black, although it is advised to pick it when purple green at its optimal time. Oil volume is lower than other cultivars and delicate in flavor. The oil is mildly fruity and frequently blended with other cultivars’ oil. The delicate flavor can dissipate after time, as the oil has been known to have a short shelf life.\n\nOlive Origin: Tuscany, Italy\n\nOlive Color: Grey-Green\n\nOlive Pairing: Cooked Fish, White Meats, Vegetables & Fresh Cheeses\n\nOlive Flavors: The oil is very sweet and aromatic\n\nUnique Traits of The Leccino Olive\n\nMost commonly the main component for a Tuscan style oil.\n\nSmall Fruit\n\nShort Shelf Life\n\nDelicate Flavor\n\nCommonly Used in Blends\n\nPendolino\n\nPendolino Olive Tree is an old Italian variety valued for its high fruit production as well as its crucial role as one of the best pollenizers for other olive varieties, often referred to as the universal pollenizers.\n\nThese slow growing trees can grow to about 20 feet tall in time. Pendolino is named for its pendulous branching characteristic, making it ideal for manual cultivation.\n\nIts fruit size is generally larger than Frantoio but smaller than Leccino. It has a slightly lower oil content with relatively early ripening fruit. The flavors have been described as fruity and sweet upon entrance, while turning bitter and ending with a characteristic spicy. Notes of bitter almond and more lightly fresh grass and artichoke have been described.\n\nOlive Origin: Italy\n\nOlive Color: Grey-Green\n\nOlive Pairing: Grilled Salmon, Risotto with Shrimp, Pasta, Bread, Vinaigrettes\n\nOlive Flavors: Fruity and Sweet upon entrance, Bitter and Ending with a Spicy Kick. Notes of Bitter Almond, Grass & Aartichoke.\n\nUnique Traits of The Pendolino Olive\n\nThe Universal Pollenizers\n\nEarly Ripening\n\nOld Italian Varietal\n\nHigh Production\n\nBalanced Flavors\n\nMaurino\n\nThe Maurino olive tree is Tuscan in origin. It’s a good pollinator but self-sterile so it needs another tree (often Frantoio, Leccino or Pendolino). Its fruit is small, but like the Pendolino cultivar, its fruit is abundant. Additionally, both cultivars actually look very similar in appearance and exhibit the graceful, pendulous branch form.\n\nPrized for its sweet and delicate oil, as well as being tolerant of very low temperatures, it’s ideal for cooler climates and dense plantings. Small fruit with very small pit., It has a surprising amount of flesh. The oil is very sweet and aromatic. The shelf life is short.\n\nOlive Origin: Tuscany, Italy\n\nOlive Color: Grey-Green\n\nOlive Pairing: Green Salads, Raw Vegetables,\n\nOlive Flavors: The Oil Sweet and Aromatic\n\nUnique Traits of The Maurino Olive\n\nTuscan Origin\n\nGood Pollinator\n\nNeeds to Be Paired with other trees to survive. (often Frantoio, Leccino or Pendolino)\n\nSmall Fruit\n\nSweet & Delicate Oil\n\nShort Shelf Life\n\nMission\n\nThe Mission Olive Tree originated in California way back in 1769, where they were planted by Franciscan priests as they established Missions among El Camino Real. Popularity grew due to its growth in California over the years when interest in olives and olive oil increased. The Mission Olive Tree can grow up to 30 feet, with its olives maturing October through November.\n\nThe only American olive cultivar listed by the International Olive Council in its World Catalogue of Olive Varieties. After the Manzanilla and Sevillana olive varieties, it remains one of the more common cultivars in the state.\n\nThese medium olives can grow up to an inch-and-a-half and turn deep eggplant purple when mature. While the dark fruit is popular, the Mission is also harvested for it green fruit which is known for its wonderful, mild grassy flavor both in cured table olives and pressed to oil. Mission olives have a unique fruity flavor and scent. The fruit and oil pairs well with fish, chicken, or as a dip for freshly baked bread.\n\nOlive Origin: California 1769\n\nOlive Color: Deep Eggplant Purple – Blackish\n\nOlive Pairing: Best Used with Bread, Fish or Chicken\n\nOlive Flavors: Mild Grassy & Fruity Flavor\n\nUnique Traits of The Mission Olive Oil\n\nEndangered Varietal\n\nWonderful Fruit to Brine or Press for Oil\n\nOne of the Hardiest Olive Varieties\n\nAttractive Specimen\n\nDrought Tolerant\n\nWidely Adaptable\n\nFragrant Spring Flowers\n\nMid Season Fruiting Time\n\nVersatile Used for Olive Oil & Table Olives\n\nManzanilla\n\nThe Manzanilla is an ancient olive tree that have been grown since ancient times, they are known to thrive in the heat. Believed to be a native of the Mediterranean, the drought tolerant Manzanillo Olive can live for hundreds of years, enduring droughts, heat and poor soil conditions. Manzanilla olives are well known for its rich black olives that can be pickled or pressed for oil. They are known to have crisp texture and a slightly smoky, almond like flavor.\n\nThis Manzanillo has a slow growth rate and young trees may take time to develop substance. The tight growth pattern creates a fuller crown, making the Manzanillo Olive a popular shade tree in Southern California. It can grow up to 30 feet, so it is an ideal choice for almost any style architecture.\n\nEasy to care for and very resilient, the evergreen Manzanillo Olive prefers deep rich soil, but it can tolerate stony, shallow soils as well.\n\nOlive Origin: Mediterranean\n\nOlive Color: Black – Green\n\nOlive Pairing: Pair them with: Swiss, Manchego, or Gouda cheese; dry Spanish Cava or Fino. Olives themselves are often Suffed with a Creamy Blue Cheese, Pimentos, or Garlic.\n\nOlive Flavors: Crisp Texture and a Slightly Smoky, Almond like Flavor.\n\nUnique Traits of The Manzanilla Olive\n\nCold Hardy and Resistant to High Summer Heat\n\nDrought Resistant\n\nVersatile\n\nUsed for Table Fruit\n\nExcellent Quality Fruit\n\nVersatile Landscape Tree\n\nItrana\n\nNative to the Italian region of Lazio (Lazio). The Itrana olive tree produces high quality black table olives and high quality extra virgin olive oil.\n\nThe oil is known for its intense and fruity flavor, with bitter and spicy feel.

This olive oil has a very fruity, tangy and bitter taste, so much so that traditionally this particular kind of olive oil has been used to cut other olive oils with a less marked flavor.\n\nDepending on the climate, olive picking may go from early October to late January. The integrity of the fruit will determine a low acidity level, fruity notes and a high content of antioxidants in the final product.\n\nThe Coratina extra-virgin olive oil is characterized by the fruity notes of green olives, followed by sensations of freshly-cut grass and bitter almonds. By genetic makeup, Coratina is one of the olive cultivars that synthesize the highest content of phenolic compounds. Freshly-pressed, the Coratina olive oil may taste bitter and unbalanced, with a bit of a slightly sharp sensation. The high phenolic content, along with the triglyceride composition, contributes to the exceptional oxidation stability of the Coratina extra-virgin olive oil.\n\nOlive Origin: Corato, Italy\n\nOlive Color: Dark Red – Light Green\n\nOlive Pairing: Used to Cut other Olive Oils with a Less Marked Flavor.\n\nOlive Flavors: Fruity, Tangy and Bitter Taste\n\nUnique Traits of the Coratina Olive\n\nHigh Phenolic Acid Content, produces Incredibly Stable Oil that Oxidizes Slowly.\n\nHigh Acidity Results in Sharp Oil that is Rich in Flavor and Displays a Sweet Aroma.\n\nCan Produce in a Variety of Climates and Soil Conditions from Sandy Coastal Locations to Hot Deserts with Rocky Soils.\n\nMinimal Watering Once Established.\n\nSmaller Fruits\n\nColumella\n\nOriginating in France, Columella is known for its resistance to cold. When harvested green, Columella yields an aromatic, sweet and fruity oil with a good balance of bitter and pungent notes. Grassy and herbaceous flavors are enhanced by tropical and floral flavors.\n\nFruit ripening is medium early. Columella is unusual among the French cultivars normally grown in California in its suitability for early harvest.

These trees mature under the watchful eyes of both our Winemaker and Vineyard Manager.\n\nThis Morning Dew Ranch Olio Nuovo (which means, new oil) differs from your typical Olive Oil. Taken straight from the press, this freshly pressed oil has all the natural flavors left inside the oil. Cold Pressed under 50 degrees, harvested locally from the Castello’s own estate vineyard. Here at the Castle, we are one of the first in the Napa Valley to sell Olio Nuovo."
