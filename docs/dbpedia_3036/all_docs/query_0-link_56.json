        "text": "We’re sure you’ve heard about the Mediterranean diet, it’s the healthiest way of eating, and although gaining popularity worldwide, the Greeks have eaten that way since forever. Fresh veggies, lots of fish, ands whole grain bread make the base of the Greek diet, but at the heart of it all, you’ll find olives and olive oil.\n\nThe warm Mediterranean climate is perfect for growing olive trees; they grow everywhere around the Mediterranean basin and are particularly good in Greece. The country is the fourth olive producer after Spain, Italy, and Turkey, but its quality is unmatched.\n\nFollow us for more such news\n\nGreece has dozens of local olive varieties, but these are the most popular:\n\n1. Kalamata olives, the large purple-hued and meaty.\n\n2. Throumpa Chiou, shriveled and intense.\n\n3. Prasines Elies Chalkidikis, also called ‘donkey lives,’ fresh and lively.\n\n4. Konservolia Stylidas, mild and pleasantly sweet.\n\nDon’t let the complicated names overwhelm you; all Greek olives are easier to enjoy than they are to pronounce.\n\nWhen it comes to Olive oil, it’s only natural that Greek olive oil is amongst the most coveted on earth.\n\nThe international olive oil market is fierce, and Greek producers struggle to take their well-deserved piece of the pie, but connoisseurs know that they can’t go wrong with Greek oil. The quality is incredibly consistent, and the fruit-forward aromas and mild bitterness are a real joy.\n\nLook for the words ‘Extra virgin olive oil’ for the finest produce and favor family-owned small operations over big brands for the most authentic experience.\n\nMake Greek olives and olive oil part of your life and see for yourself what the craze is all about."
