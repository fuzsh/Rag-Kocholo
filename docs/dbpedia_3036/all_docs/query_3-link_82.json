See the inventory of van Gogh’s works then in van Gogh-Bonger’s collection, Andries Bonger, “Catalogue des œuvres de Vincent van Gogh,” 1891, Brieven en Documenten, b 3055 V/1962 (document),Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, no. 147, as Oliviers /30/effet du matin. For the Cassirer exhibition, see Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, “List of 30 titles and prices of paintings by Vincent van Gogh, made for Cassirer, April 1905,” Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, Brieven en Documenten, 1905 b 2185 V/1982 (document, inkt, potlood, papier), no. 14-147, as Olijfbomen. Cassirer records the purchase of the canvas from Johanna on May 25, 1905 [see note 4], but Johanna records the sale of the canvas to Cassirer in her account book for the month of June 1905; see Theo van Gogh and Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, “Account book of Theo van Gogh and Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, May 21 1889-January 25, 1925,” Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, Brieven en Documenten, b 2205 V/1982 (boek, inkt op papier), p. 14 line no. 10, stock no. 4, as Olijven, and p. 89 line no. 21, as “ontvangen van Paul Cassirer te Berlijn voor 8 gr.

O. Miethke from 1904-1912.\n\n[6] According to the verso of Kohner’s stock card (in a private collection, Hungary), the painting was “Vétetett a bécsi Galerie Miethke-cégtől.” We take this to mean that Kohner bought the painting from Galerie Miethke in Vienna. See correspondence from Péter Molnos, art historian, Budapest, to Meghan Gray, NAMA, October 4, 2017, NAMA curatorial file. See also inventory case K. 27, inventory loose card reproduced in Judit Geskó, ed., Van Gogh in Budapest, exh. cat. (Budapest: Museum of Fine Arts, 2006), 149. Kohner was a regular patron of Galerie Miethke and sold his Old Master collection in March 1908 in order to collect modern artists.\n\nKohner’s birthdate is unclear: The year 1866 is given in Péter Molnos, Lost Heritage: Hungarian Art Collectors in the Twentieth Century (Budapest: Kieselbach Gallery and Auction House, 2018), 92; the year 1865 is given in Ilona Sármány-Parsons, “Notes on Patronage of Modernism in the Fine Arts in Vienna and Budapest at the Turn of the Century,” CEU History Department Yearbook (1993): 151.\n\nIn his 1928 catalogue raisonné, J. B. de la Faille erroneously lists Galerie d’Art Barbazanges, Paris, as a constituent, an error that has persisted in other catalogues. See L’Œuvre de Vincent Van Gogh: Catalogue Raisonné (Paris: Éditions G. Van Oest, 1928), no. 715, pp. 1:203. The Galerie operated from ca. 1910/1911 until ca. 1929, during the time that Adolf Kohner is documented to have owned the painting.\n\n[7] According to Péter Molnos, the painting was exported from Budapest on October 8, 1930, and was likely sent to Paul Rosenberg in Paris. See Péter Molnos, Aranykorok Romjain: Tanulmányok A Modern Magyar Festészet és Műgyűjtés Történetéből a Kieselbach Galéria Alapításának Huszadik Évfordulójá (Budapest: Kieselbach Galéria Kereskedelmi Kft., 2015), 107. See also no. 362, Central Archives, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, list of items exported from Budapest, no. 1930/ 3-23., 8 October 1930. Thanks to Péter Molnos for providing a scan of this document, which says, “Bejelentése alapján / K. föigazgató ni. 362. Dr. Kohner Adolf br. (Damjanich-n. / 20.) Izignálatlan Van Gogh-féle Olajerdő / c. festményre (Franciaországba ?) x/8”. See The Paul Rosenberg Archives, a Gift of Elaine and Alexandre Rosenberg, III.D, Rosenberg Galleries: Miniature Photo and Card Index, ca. 1910-1987, and IV.A.I.a, Liste de Photographies, Paris, [1917-1939] [1940-present], The Museum of Modern Art, New York. According to Ilda François, secretary to Elaine Rosenberg, Paul Rosenberg must have purchased the painting between June 1929 and November 1930; the exact purchase date is unknown. See also email from Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel et Cie., Paris, to Nicole Myers, NAMA, January 11, 2016, NAMA curatorial file. Durand-Ruel says that Rosenberg purchased the painting for 104,000 Pengos, which was the official Hungarian currency; therefore it is possible that Rosenberg purchased the painting directly from Kohner.\n\n[8] See email from Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel et Cie., Paris, to Nicole Myers, NAMA, January 11, 2016, NAMA curatorial file. Durand-Ruel erroneously records the purchase of the painting by the Kansas City Art Institute. Actually, the painting was sent on approval to NAMA from March 18, 1931 until its purchase in January 1932, where it was placed on view at the Kansas City Art Institute since the museum was not yet built. At this time, a petition spearheaded by local dealer Effie Seachrest (1869-1952) was signed by about 135 people encouraging the museum to purchase the work. See “Petition to purchase Van Gogh Olive Orchards,” ca. April 21, 1931, NAMA Archives, William Rockhill Nelson Trust Office Records (RG 80/05), Series II: Objects Offered, 1926-33, box 7, folder 12, Durand-Ruel, 1931-32; and letter from J. C.
