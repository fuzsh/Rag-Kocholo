        "text": "Ingredients Click Here\n\nPurity:Seagate 100% Extra Virgin Olive Oil is derived from Seagate's own hand-picked olives. This product's quality and integrity are assured because Seagate is in control of the entire process, from harvesting the olives, producing the oil and bottling the finished product. There are no other oils blended into this Seagate product. It is 100% pure.\n\nExtra Virgin Process:Seagate 100% Extra Virgin Olive Oil has not been subjected to any heat or chemicals. This oil comes from the very first cold pressing of the oil. This is followed by gravity-fed filtration to remove the larger vegetable particles from the olive's skin and pulp that may have passed through the press. There is no other step in the processing other than filling the bottles.\n\nBenefits: Seagate 100% Extra Virgin Olive Oil contains very high levels of Oleic Acid (11 grams per 14 gram serving), a monounsaturated fatty acid that can reduce the risk of heart disease. This benefit is so strong that the FDA, which normally prohibits any disease claim for any food or health food product, allows this statement on olive oil labels - \"Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating 2 tablespoons (23 grams) of olive oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease due to the monounsaturated fat in olive oil.\"\n\nTaste: A high quality extra virgin olive oil will have a light green color and a very pleasant taste, with a slight olive after-taste, without any acidy residual flavor remaining in your mouth. Really good extra virgin olive oil should taste so good, that you will want to use it to dip your bread rather than applying butter. After you have tasted Seagate's product, the chances are that you will not want to go back to using the olive oil you had been previously using, and you will begin to prefer using Seagate's 100% Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of butter."
