Located in the warm southern region of Spain, our olives are derived from one single estate. Our Picudo olives are hand-picked from the grove, are crushed within hours at our mill, and produce a robust Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Due to the bold nature of Picudo, you will want to pair this variety with bold flavors like meat and seafood. The name Picudo means “prominent peak” referring to the pointed end of the olive fruit from this tree.

Our collection was carefully curated with intention by O.N.A.O.O. certified experts. Each bottle consists of a mono-cultivar, meaning derived from one single olive variety, thus encapsulating intensities and flavors that are rare in the United States. We proudly print our harvest year on the front of our labels so that you can enjoy every last drop with the utmost confidence in quality.

Immerse yourself into the olive groves, learn how to taste E.V.O.O. like a certified expert, and discover recipes in our catalog here.
