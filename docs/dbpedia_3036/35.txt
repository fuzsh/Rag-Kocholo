This olive oil is obtained by simultaneously crushing olives, (mainly of the salonenque variety) and freshly picked basil leaves and a touch of mint. CastelineS Olive Oil with Basil & Mint is produced at CastelaS mill at harvest time in November by crushing olives with the leaves of the fresh-picked herbs. The resulting oil exudes the seductive flavors of late summer. The nose reveals a strong aroma of basil. When in the mouth, the basil start is followed by the delicate freshness of mint.
