        "text": "Georgetown, GINA, February 1, 2006 - A report of all State funds spent during the flood relief phase, which were scrutinised by the state auditors, will be made public.\n\nAt a media conference yesterday at the Office of the President, Head of State President Bharrat Jagdeo in response to the People's National Congress Reform's (PNCR) accusations that the funds used to finance relief during the 2005 flood were not accounted for, maintained that all accounting procedures were adhered to during the process.\n\n\"The auditors were there... I am a bit concerned that it is delayed. Every cent of spending would be tabled in the National Assembly, audited by the auditors,\" the President said.\n\nAs was explained earlier by Permanent Secretary, Office of the President Jennifer Webster, staff of the Central Accounting Unit of the Office of the President was responsible for maintaining cheque books and writing cheques. The Unit was also responsible for payments once authorisation and approval was given for expenditure to be incurred. The signatories to those accounts were members of the Central Accounting Unit and all supporting bills and documentation will be provided for a final public audit.\n\nA temporary financial statement was prepared, while the comprehensive document is being prepared.\n\n\"I am telling you that it is a model for many countries in disaster. We have names of people who received the assistance that is the $10,000 and other types of assistance given out last year. We have the names of every company that we procured goods and services from during the flood. These have been listed and sent to the Commissioner General of the Guyana Revenue Authority so that they would know that these people supplied government with stocks,\" the President said.\n\nFrom the inception, auditors were stationed at the support centre at State House, overseeing the flood relief process and were present when relief items were procured both in and out of Georgetown.\n\nHead of the Civil Defence Commission, Col. (rtd) Chabilall Ramsarup had also assured that the flood relief efforts administered through the CDC are well accounted for, adding that an auditor was present at the CDC to oversee its activities. These accounts would also be made public.\n\n\"From this exercise, it is also going to he tabled in Parliament so that the Opposition would have a full view of this matter,\" President Jagdeo said."
