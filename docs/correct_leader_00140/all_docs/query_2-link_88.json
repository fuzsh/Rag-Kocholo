Human, animal and plant life in small island states like Trinidad and Tobago are affected by rising sea levels and deforestation.\n\nGuyana's President, Bharrat Jagdeo, is the Chairman of the Caribbean Community, CARICOM. Zeinab Badawi asks if his fifteen member states are too disunited to speak with one voice at the UN climate talks in Copenhagen."
