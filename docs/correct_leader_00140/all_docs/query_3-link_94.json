Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the two countries and peoples have worked together to overcome difficulties, and China-Guyana friendship has become stronger. China is ready to work with Guyana to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, promote sustained and sound development of bilateral relations, and jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind. Song highlighted the achievements and experience of the CPC over the past 100 years, saying that since its founding, the CPC has taken it as its original mission to promote happiness of the people and rejuvenate the nation, and actively contributed to the cause of human progress. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, China has undergone historic economic and social changes and made historic achievements. China has won an all-round victory in the battle against poverty. All rural population defined as poor by current standards were lifted out of poverty, and the people’s sense of fulfillment and happiness has greatly increased. The CPC is ready to strengthen strategic communication with the People’s Progressive Party, deepen experience exchanges on state governance and administration, push for new achievements in bilateral cooperation and bring more benefits to the two countries and two peoples.\n\nJagdeo extended warm congratulations on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC, spoke highly of the great achievements the Chinese people have made under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and thanked China for its valuable support for Guyana’s fight against the epidemic as well as economic and social development. Jagdeo said that the People’s Progressive Party attaches great importance to developing friendly relations with the CPC and is willing to work with the CPC to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, promote bilateral cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, investment and energy under the guidance of inter-party relations and strive for greater development of bilateral relations. The People’s Progressive Party and the Guyanese government firmly adhere to the one-China principle and support China in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We look forward to maintaining close communication with China and continuously enhancing friendship between the two peoples.\n\nKwame McCoy, Assistant to the General Secretary of the People’s Progress Party of Guyana and Minister within the Office of the Prime Minister, Shen Beili, Vice-minister of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee, Chen Xilai, Chargé D'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Guyana and other officials were present at the video conference.\n\nEnditem"
