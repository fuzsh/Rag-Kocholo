        "text": "I was deeply shocked and saddened at the extent of the destruction caused by the catastrophic earthquake which devastated our sister nation of Haiti yesterday. The haunting images of bodies, injured persons and ruined buildings struck a chord of compassion throughout our nation for the people of Haiti.\n\nHaiti as the poorest country in the western hemisphere is now severely challenged to cope with this tragedy. Haiti needs all countries, including the small developing countries to come to its aid urgently.\n\nThe Government of Guyana has pledged US$1 million to bring some relief to the people of Haiti.\n\nI will be convening a meeting at 2.00 p.m. today with representatives of Political Parties and Non-Governmental Organisations to coordinate a national response to aid in the recovery effort."
