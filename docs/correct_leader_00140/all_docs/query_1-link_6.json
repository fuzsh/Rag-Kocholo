But smaller countries fear that things are not going in a direction that will help them. Guyana was in IMF programmes for 20 years so its president, Bharrat Jagdeo, knows a lot about their shortcomings. The Banker's editor, Brian Caplen, asked him how things could be improved and also got his assessment of the Guyanese economy.\n\nQ: Is there a need for a new Bretton Woods type of reform?"
