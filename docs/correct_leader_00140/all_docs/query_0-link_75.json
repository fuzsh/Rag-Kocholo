Guyana is a small developing country in South America, with a low population density. It is one of the most vulnerable countries to global climate change, as its entire coastal area is low- lying and approximately 3 meters below sea level.\n\nGuyana is a sovereign state on the northern mainland of South America. It is, however, included in the Caribbean Region due to its rich cultural, historical, and political ties with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Guyana is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Brazil to the south and southwest, Suriname to the east and Venezuela to the west. With 215,000 square kilometres, Guyana is the fourth-smallest country on mainland South America after Uruguay, Suriname, and French Guiana. It has population of more than 773,303 (2016). Some 90% of its population lives on the narrow Atlantic coastal plain. The coastal plain is the site of agricultural areas that generate approximately 23% of the nation's GDP."
