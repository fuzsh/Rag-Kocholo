        "text": "Vice President Dr Bharrat Jagdeo has called on citizens to reject what he called the false narrative being peddled by the opposition and other anti-government voices that the government is deliberately withholding pay increases for public servants.\n\nSpeaking at a recent community meeting, on the West Bank Demerara, the Vice President reminded that it is the same APNU+AFC Coalition government that took away the one-month tax-free bonus from the joint services, which the PPP/C administration has since re-implemented.\n\nAccording to Jagdeo, it was the PPP/C Government that redeemed the public service from a pauperized state, “…but they can only say that for people who do not know the history of this country or who are not aware of and we need to stand up to this sort of thing.”\n\nThe vice president added that the PPP/C administration will not allow this sort of thinking by the opposition to dictate its policies, “we have a straight and clear ideology, and we have a goal which we outlined in our manifesto.”\n\nHe noted that the PPP/C has committed to providing citizens with world-class education and healthcare, providing job opportunities, and ensuring their safety, and the administration has since embarked on that journey over the two years since returning to office.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe vice president said the development taking place offshore will secure close to 3,000 jobs for residents on the West Coast Demerara, referencing the largest privately-owned wharf, as well as the government’s investment in the construction of the New Demerara River Crossing and the opening up of lands for the construction of some 14, 000 house lots in the region, among several other major projects.\n\nHe said the government is currently making efforts to reclaim approximately 5,000 acres of land that the APNU+AFC gave away for coconut production and to date cultivation has not begun.\n\nThe vice president added that the government has been making significant investments in the country despite the pandemic. He said this is happening even a large number of persons were laid off around the world, in Guyana, public servants continued to receive their salaries.\n\nCMC/"
