Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo has exhausted the mandatory two terms as President from2001 to 2011. Before that he served as Acting President of Guyana from 1999 to 2001. For some unknown reason he believes that he has the right to be able to access the seat of the Presidency once again. He was obviously behind a move in which a petition was filed in the Supreme Court of Guyana for any President of Guyana to be allowed a third term. This was approved by the late acting Chief Justice, Mr. Ian Chang but this was overturned by the Caribbean Court of Justice on appeal. With his present appointment by the newly elected President, Dr. Irfaan Ali, Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo has an open way to the position of President, albeit in an acting capacity. To prevent a similar situation in the future, amendments to the Constitution are necessary.

This type of behavior is not acceptable in any society that is described as "Democratic" because it smacks of arrogance and dictatorship. It is also immoral and unethical.
