Guyanese President Bharrat Jagdeo has been named by leaders of the Amazonian, Congo and Borneo-Mekong forests as the world's first Goodwill Ambassador for tropical rain forests.

A release from the government said the position is not full-time and will take effect when President Jagdeo demits office.

Jadgeo was put forward as Goodwill Ambassador at the Heads of State and Government conference on the three Tropical Forest Basins of the World, which ended Friday in the Republic of Congo.

Guyanaâ€™s Low Carbon Development Strategy also received high praise at the forum and for its efforts in the international arena to combat climate change.
