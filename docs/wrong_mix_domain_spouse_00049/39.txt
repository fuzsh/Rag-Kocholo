I’m not sure about the end of the story.

It was a twist I did not expect, that is for sure. Yet, the way Bryn goes crazy and tries to kill Joshua did not ring true. We know that Bryn had a history of depression and she had been on medication. However, in her parts she sounded sensible and not perturbed at all. We learn that is was her who killed the baby girl, thinking that the child was already dead. She threw her into the river, and then she heard her cries. Allison later took the blame because she thought Bryn could never survive.

The moment of confrontation between Charm, Claire, Allison, and Charm’s mother was a bit too contrived for my taste. It was too much of a coincidence that the woman found the photographs of the baby and Charm, and came to confront her in front of Joshua’s adoptive and birth mothers. Claire took things much better than I would have expected. I don’t know why she didn’t know about Allison and her crime, and if I had been her and after what happened with the thieves, I would have demanded to know the truth about Allison. After all, she was trusting this ex-convict with her business and leaving her around her son.

Thankfully, Joshua survived and didn’t kill. Despite what she did, I was sad when Bryn finally succeeded in killing herself. I think this girl was too troubled, and even though her grandmother took good care of her, I think she was neglected. If her parents had paid more attention to her, she might not have had those problems. Bryn was a lovely girl, who cared for animals, but for some reason she was suffering from some mental pathology.

In the end, Allison gained her innocence, and Claire decided to leave to start afresh with her family.

I loved the book. It was intriguing and surprising. I just didn’t fall in love with the end.
