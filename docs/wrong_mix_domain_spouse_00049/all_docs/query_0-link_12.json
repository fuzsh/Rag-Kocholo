        "text": "Wilma 'Marie' Delaney, 77, Kooskia\n\nWilma \"Marie\" Delaney, 77, of Kooskia, Idaho, passed away in her home on July 12, 2024.\n\nTrenary Funeral Home will be overseeing arrangements.\n\nEdward Leon Glaze, 84, formerly of Orofino\n\nOn a hot, July day, Ed Glaze went on his last camping trip to the final campground.\n\nEdward Leon Glaze was 84 years old and loved every minute of his life. He enjoyed camping, fishing and hunting. Ed had a mechanical mind and was a Mr. Fixit! He preferred an \"I can fix it\" attitude and was a perfectionist in his work. Ed loved his animals and was good to many dogs, horses, mules, and other pets. He leaves behind his final canine companion, Choctaw, who misses him greatly.\n\nEd and his Eureka Ridge neighbor, Faye, provided help and repairs to all their neighbors, were very helpful in the community, and spent winters plowing and grading roads and maintaining the grader.\n\nEd was born and grew up in California, and he had another life and experiences before moving to Idaho, working for the US Department of the Forest Service for many years, along with running a lodge and fishing guide business.\n\nOnce in Idaho, Ed worked for the State of Idaho at Dworshak State Park, retiring in 2004 to spend his retirement on Eureka Ridge, and later, Juliaetta with his wife, Marilyn. Ed loved to cut wood and still has quite a pile ready for \"camping,\"\n\nEd has a large family, with children, grand and great-grandchildren, as well as step-children and step-grandchildren in California. Ed is also survived by his sister and her family in California.\n\nEd never met a stranger; he loved to talk and tell stories of his adventures. His first words to anyone who came to visit were \"wanna beer?\" And he enjoyed his beer after a day of work especially if he could share one with friends. Ed was rarely idle, working in his shop, garage, or out in the woods, scouting, picking berries, or riding his side-by.\n\nThe last few years, Ed has struggled with his health, fighting a heart condition and deteriorating lungs. He loved to be in the garden and worried about his tomatoes up till the very last.\n\nEd and his wife, Marilyn (Preussler-Smathers) were married in 2004. Ed was divorced and Marilyn a widow. Marilyn says they were funny old people, but they had good times in their 20 years together with their friends on Eureka Ridge.\n\nEd was a kind, thoughtful and friendly, loving man and he has a good life, well-lived. He will be greatly missed by Marilyn, their combined families, and friends. Per Ed's wished, no funeral services or memorials will be held. He will be shared on the wind in his favorite places, his ranch in California, his hunting camp, and Alaska. That being said, if you have read this far and knew Ed Glaze, you would know, raise a cold beer or an iced Gin & Tonic, share a memory of a great guy, and smile!\n\nPhoto: Edward Leon Glaze\n\nTresa (Sutton) English, 71\n\nTresa (Sutton) English, 71, passed away July 5, 2024, in Spokane, WA.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending.\n\nGladys Jewell Brooks, 100, Orofino\n\nGladys Jewell Brooks passed away on July 3, 2024.

Pam joined two older sisters, Cindy and Jackie.\n\nThe family of five moved about a bit following Ivon's work, finally landing in Orofino, where they made their home.\n\nPam was a 1974 graduate from Orofino High School and was looking forward to her 50th reunion this summer. Stories of her antics, personality and humor are still reveled and shared with warmth and smiles by those that knew her from high school.\n\nIn 1977 Pam met the love of her life, Kenneth Bullock Jr (Bo) in Pierce. The two were a love made forever. Pam and Bo were married in 1983 and welcomed a daughter, Amanda that same year. A second daughter, Ashly joined the clan in 1985. The family made their home in Pierce, surrounded by Bo's family, and close to Pam's parents who remained in Orofino.\n\nThroughout the girls' school years, Pam could be found in the classrooms helping out, getting sunburned on outside field trips, and being the loudest mom for all of the kids in the stands; if you knew her, you knew any of the kids around were hers and she let everyone know when she was proud.\n\nDuring the kid's high school years, Pam and Bo welcomed Travis Wisman into the family as an unofficial son, and loved him just the same.\n\nPam and Bo spent 30 years together, making friends and memories where ever they went. They loved hunting, fishing, getting firewood, playing aggravation and loving, their kids, nieces and nephews.\n\nPam lost Bo in 2007, just a week after their anniversary. She spent the next 17 years missing him and waiting for their reunion. During those years she was blessed with her grandbabies, Christopher Berry, McKenzie Sly, Mya, Giada and Grayson Talbott, she also got to meet two great-grandbabies, Julian and Oliver Sly. She absolutely loved the opportunity to teach each of the grandkids aggravation and teach them \"the name of the game\" by her ruthless method of playing and taking everyone off the board, and don't touch her dice!\n\nPam took great pride in her career as a Clearwater County Deputy, and later in life, a 911 Dispatcher. She loved being part of the law enforcement community.\n\nShe was a competitive bowler in high school and in the years following with her dad. She loved to play softball and watch baseball.

Purnell Jr., 69, of Elk River, died Monday, June 24, 2024, at St. Joseph Regional Medical Center in Lewiston.\n\nShort's Funeral Chapel of Moscow is in charge of arrangements.\n\nTom Stroschein, 86, Elk River\n\nOn Thursday, June 27, 2024, the Idaho Sheepherder departed to be with the Great Shepherd of green pastures and still waters. What a capacious legacy with volumes of stories he has left for us to treasure.\n\nFrom true pioneer stock- Pauline Fyke, born in Wetonka, South Dakota, and Roy Stroschein, born in Bosler, Wyoming, came their first born, Tommy Sherrill Stroschein on July 26, 1937 in American Falls, Idaho. His mama told him it was the popcorn she ate the night before at the movies in Idaho Falls that prompted him to make his grand entrance into the world.\n\nWe laughed when we found the $37.50 hand-written hospital receipt tucked away in his baby book that paid for his delivery and a mandatory two-week stay in the hospital.\n\nTom was incredibly proud of his German Hohenzollern heritage, and even more proud of the things his father accomplished in his lifetime with only an eighth-grade education. Tom credits his mother who taught in the Sterling and Aberdeen Schools over 30 years for being the silent force behind his father's accomplishments: serving as a member of the Idaho Transportation Board, Aberdeen School Board, and the Idaho State Legislature.\n\nTommy grew up working side by side with his dad on the farm at Sterling, ten miles north of Aberdeen. He attended grade school at the Grandview School and high school in Aberdeen. If you have ever driven across the American Falls Dam and wondered how the black AHS sign on an orange background ended up on the 106-foot reinforced concrete grain elevator left standing in the reservoir after the reclamation project covered the old townsite, it was the Senior Class President, Tommy Stroschein, and the boys of the Aberdeen High School Class of 1955.\n\nThey borrowed Tom's dad's boat (actually, it is rumored Tom's dad was driving the boat), several gallons of black and orange paint, and a tall ladder.\n\nAfter high school, Tom's dad told him he could go to any college he wanted, but his tuition money would be at the University of Idaho. From that day on, Tom wore the silver and gold colors with pride. He said, \"Even my t-shirts were gold; but that's because of the Moscow water.\"\n\nIn the fall of his sophomore year at Idaho, Tom survived the fire at Gault Hall started by a UI law student, tragically killing three of his fellow classmates. The next fall he became a charter member of University of Idaho Farm House Fraternity, commissioned in October 1957 and was the recipient of the coveted FH Doane Award. He was Outstanding U of I Senior, a member of Silver Lance, Blue Key, Alpha Zeta and national president (Royal King) of Intercollegiate Knights. Tom graduated with a B.S. Degree in Animal Husbandry from the University of Idaho in 1959.\n\nAfter college, Tom met Karen Smith, a sorority sister of Tom's younger sister, Sharon. Tom and Karen were married December 28, 1963. They made their life on the family farm where Tom worked since college; and where he recently acquired a band of sheep. He and his dad also expanded their irrigated farmland from three-hundred to a thousand acres, officially becoming Stroschein Ranches, Inc., raising hay, grain, sugar beets, peas, and potatoes.\n\nIn their 21-year marriage, Tom and Karen acquired an additional four thousand head of ewes, bringing the total to five thousand. They were blessed with two children; Sherrill and Steve, (also known as \"Gus\").\n\nIt was the financial devastation of the 80s that not only pushed family farms and ranches over the edge, but relationships as well. The sheep were liquidated along with the marriage in 1983-84, though Tom and Karen cooperated in parenting and were friends until her death in 2005. It was important to Tom that he later have Karen's blessing on his marriage to Ruby Campbell Miles in 1990 when Tom also took on the responsibility of raising three step-children; Matt, Katie, and Sarah.\n\nTom was appointed by Cecil Andrus to the Idaho Sheep Commission during Governor Andrus's first term, in 1972, and to the Idaho Wheat Commission during Andrus's second term in 1990. Tom was appointed to the Idaho State Farm Service Agency Board in 1993. He also served on various boards and committees of National Farmers Union, Eastern Idaho Grazing Association, and Society for Range Management. Tom worked with the US Forest Service to initiate the first rest-rotation grazing program in the Caribou National Forest.\n\nIn 1984, Tom was a candidate for Idaho State Representative, where he lost to Mike Simpson, claiming he helped launch the 40-year political career of the now District Two Idaho Congressman. He previously worked to get Richard Stallings elected to the position Congressman Simpson now holds, and went on to serve as Stallings's Agricultural Advisor for several years, working on the 1985 Farm Bill in Washington D.C.\n\nAfter leasing the Aberdeen Farm to Val Wahlen in 1997, Tom and Ruby moved to Moscow, Idaho for Ruby to finish her degree in Ag Econ. It was in this anomaly of political diversity Tom was successfully elected as Latah County Commissioner for four terms, retiring in 2015. During his tenure as commissioner, Tom was appointed by Governor Otter as an Idaho Health and Welfare Board Member in 2009, retiring in 2020.\n\nThe awards and recognitions Tom has received through the years are extensive. Tom's finest accomplishment was starting the Idaho Recovery Centers. Because Tom spear-headed the project, the initial funding from the Idaho Millennial Fund included the start-up of the Latah Recovery Center, and three others. The program has now expanded to nine alcohol and drug recovery centers in Idaho and several satellite centers.\n\nTom was an active member of the Aberdeen St. Paul's Lutheran Church and Moscow Emmanual Lutheran Church where he served on the church council and University of Idaho Campus Christian Center board. He was also a member of the Moscow Rotary Club.\n\nAfter Tom retired from the county commissioner job, he and Ruby sold their home in Moscow and moved to the home they built in Elk River several years earlier. Tom has most recently served as chairman on the Elk River Recreation District. Tom is survived by his only sibling, Sharon Stroschein Block of Colorado, formerly Twin Falls; his wife, Ruby; and children, Sherrill (Peter Tsoulos) of London, UK, Steven (Kika) of Woodbridge, VA, Matt Miles (Jenn Shipp) of Havre, MT, Katie Miles (Matt Baldwin) of Seattle, WA, and Sarah Miles (Kyle Stamper), of Kendrick, ID; grandchildren, Hannah Miles, Kylie Stamper, Katlyn Curnutt, Tommy Stamper, Matt and Alex Stroschein, and Noah Tsoulos, and four great-grandchildren.\n\nA special thanks to Julia Parker, Gentiva Hospice, and the care takers of Cascadia of Lewiston.

As the baby of the family, she enjoyed a special bond with her mother. She often referred to her childhood as magical because of her mother's love.\n\nShe always enjoyed her mom's chicken and noodles, salad with peas, and extraordinary chocolate cake.\n\nDiane remembered going to church every Sunday and watching her mother put a dollar in the collection plate so she would have a good week.\n\nAfter church, the family would always gather for dinner, which left an impression on Diane her entire life. She loved gathering family and friends together for holidays or just because. She became well known throughout several counties in Idaho for her delicious chicken and noodles, decadent chocolate cake, and perfect pie, obviously carrying on her mother's mantra that food is love.\n\nDiane grew up and attended school in Genesee, Idaho.\n\nDiane's house was the place for all the school kids to hang out. According to Diane, her mother's patience knew no bounds.\n\nDiane often shared fond memories of when she was a very young girl, sitting at the bottom of the staircase listening to her brother Dick and his friends tell stories and laugh. Diane hosted dozens of slumber parties throughout her school years. As high schoolers, Diane, her best friend Mardell (Grieser-Broemeling), and a host of other slumber party buddies would sneak out in their babydoll pajamas to see what harmless mischief they could find in Genesee. Sometimes, they'd go to the school to swing; sometimes, they'd find other school-aged kids sleeping outside during the warmer months and go visit them. Sometimes, the girls would climb out the big second-story window and sleep on the roof above the kitchen. That's when Diane learned from her friend Sandy Berger to not wear slick pajamas on a pitched roof.\n\nWhile in high school, Diane met the love of her life, Roger P. Kinyon, who was a year younger.\n\nOne particular summer, he'd been working construction in Montana with his dad, and when he returned to school in Genesee in the fall, he noticed a pretty, fair-haired, blue-eyed Junior at the first dance of the year. He didn't take her to the dance, but they went out after and from that point forward, Roger and Diane were together.\n\nDiane graduated in 1960 and went on to work as a paraprofessional in Moscow.\n\nShe and Roger married on June 13, 1964, in Genesee, where they made their home until 1990.\n\nRoger and Diane enjoyed raising their three \"favorite\" children (there was always a heated debate over who was the favorite), Wendy, Roger Todd, and Chad, in the little white house on Pine Street.\n\nWith a lot of elbow grease and love, several remodels to the home allowed for more space. Much like in her childhood, Diane made a fun place for her kids and their friends to hang out. Diane ran a daycare out of their home until her youngest, Chad, started school. She then started as a plant bookkeeper for the McGregor Company in 1976.\n\nThe Kinyon family, along with five other families, pooled their resources to install a swimming pool in a vacant lot next to the Kinyon home. Warm weather months lounging at the oasis created countless memories for many generations.\n\nOther Kinyon family adventures included boating, fishing, and camping excursions during the summer months.\n\nIn 1990, Roger and Diane moved when their jobs with McGregor Company took them to Pullman, Wash. Diane retired in 2008 after 32 years of service for McGregor Company (1976-2008). During her tenure there, she worked at the Genesee and Pullman plants and the Colfax main office.\n\nDiane and Roger built the home of their dreams on Dworshak Reservoir above Orofino, Idaho, in 2008, and after retirement, left Pullman to be full-time mountain people at Freeman Creek. Their favorite pastimes included boating with family and friends, watching (and feeding) the deer, an occasional round of golf, and visiting the neighbors in the side-by-side. Diane loved having morning coffee on the deck, weather permitting, and always enjoyed gathering her large family together for work and play days.\n\nNCAA basketball season took top priority with her beloved men's Gonzaga Bulldogs, and she spent many a moment petting, loving, and visiting with her precious adopted cats, Holly and Emily. They loved her cooking as much as the humans.\n\nDiane's ability to craft a pie capable of curling your toes it was so delicious made her a friend to many because everyone knows pie fixes everything.\n\nShe emulated her mom by sharing magical experiences with her 6 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. Drawing pictures out of letters of the alphabet, undertaking a crafty project in her sewing room, spending time out in nature, and playing lively games like Tile Rummy and Sequence were just a few of the memory-making adventures Gigi Di shared with her grands.\n\nRoger and Diane also spent many hours over the years in Genesee, Pullman, and Freeman Creek with dear friends. There was always time for a wild game of pinochle with lifelong pals Fred and Marla Morscheck and Gordon and Brenda Cockrum.\n\nAfter moving to the lake, Roger and Diane's circle of close friends increased exponentially, enjoying food, laughter, boating, fishing, and travel with Doyle and Linda Jones and Will and CeCe Sellman.\n\nBeyond her family and friends, Diane spent countless hours with her second love, quilting. The Freeman Creek home included an oversized sewing room, and she spent as much time as possible pouring love and fabric into beautiful masterpieces for family and friends. She was honored to be Genesee's Community Days featured quilter in 2013, which was when the family realized her massive amounts of quilts both at her home and in so many other homes could fill several vehicles.\n\nDiane also spent many hours laughing, learning, and sewing with her Material Girls family in Orofino. She cherished her \"girl\" time at the shop with Sharon, Denitta, Denise, Margo, and the \"fabric gang.\"\n\nDiane is survived by her husband, Roger P. Kinyon, Lenore, ID; daughter, Wendy K. Vineyard (Bill), Hayden, ID; son, Roger T. Kinyon (Noell), Genesee, ID; son, Chad W. Kinyon (Temple), Las Vegas, NV; sisters, Janice Y. Boehme, Page, AZ and Carol L. Walker, Albany, OR; grandchildren, Karrie (Wes) Schilling, Kalee Kinyon, Lindsey (Jack) Kemp, Tyrell Kinyon, Kelsey (John) Chhuor, Cody (Shanae) Kinyon; and great-grandchildren, Madison, Jack Jack, James, Grayson, Piper, Jakobi, Winston, Olivia, Carson, Savannah, and Sadie.\n\nThe family would like to thank the incredibly talented and compassionate staff at Orofino Hospital, Kootenai Medical, Hospice of North Idaho (Schneidmiller House), and Yates Funeral Homes and Cremation. She was also very impressed by the caring (and handsome!) Life Flight Network paramedics. Your attention to detail and giving Diane the comfort and dignity, she deserved during her last days did not go unnoticed by her family and friends. Their appreciation goes beyond words.\n\nThe family would also like to thank Diane's friends and extended family for the outpouring of support, prayers, notes, calls, food, flowers, and love during this difficult time.\n\nA Celebration of Life for Diane will take place the morning of Aug. 3, 2024, at the Southwick Bible Church, 40192 Southwick Road. If you'd like to make a donation in Diane's name to remember her, please consider the Lewis Clark Animal Shelter (where Emily and Holly lived before finding their fur-ever home with Mama Di and Papa Rog).\n\nPhoto: Margaret Diane Kinyon\n\nGary Allen Medley, 76, formerly of Orofino\n\nGary Allen Medley, aged 76, passed away on Wednesday, June 5, 2024, at his home in Lewiston, Idaho.\n\nBorn on December 18, 1947, in Ontario, Oregon, Gary was the youngest of three brothers, preceded by Don and Dick, born to Ike and Dollie Medley. Raised in the scenic landscapes of Pollock, Idaho, Gary's youthful adventures often led him into the mountains around Riggins alongside his loyal companion, Shorty.\n\nA natural athlete, Gary excelled in sports throughout his school years at Salmon River High School. As the quarterback of the football team, point guard of the basketball team, and a skilled pole vaulter on the track team, his competitive spirit and determination were unmatched.\n\nFollowing high school, Gary pursued further education at Treasure Valley Community College, where he not only showcased his athletic prowess in football but also studied criminal justice. His career path later led him to the Idaho State Penitentiary and Idaho State Police before embarking on his lifelong journey in logging as a contractor with Potlatch Corporation. From the Benton Creek Log Dump to the Merry's Bay and Ahsahka Log Yards, Gary's dedication to his craft was unwavering.\n\nIn 1975, Gary married Sandy Bonnalie. Together, they raised a loving family of three children, Nikki, Hope, and Corey, in Orofino where their home became a hub of warmth and hospitality, hosting countless gatherings for friends and family. Nikki, Hope, and Corey were sources of immense joy and pride in Gary's life.\n\nGary's passion for the outdoors extended to racing motorcycles, bird hunting with his beloved English setters, and honing his skills in trapshooting, a pursuit that saw him earn numerous championships, including the coveted State Doubles Championship.\n\nIn the mid-90s, Gary's entrepreneurial spirit led him into road building and land development, alongside his son, Corey. Together they transformed their land holdings into successful neighborhoods, forming an unbreakable bond as partners in both business and life.\n\nA man of many interests, Gary shared a special bond with his brother Dick, transitioning from trapshooting to golfing as their shared passion. In the competitive spirit, they enjoyed golfing with many friends along the way. He also shared a connection with his daughter, Hope, on the golf course, participating in tournaments in Orofino and Lewiston.\n\nIn 1994, Gary found love with Jeanne Kalinoski, whom he married on Dec. 24, 1999, in a ceremony at the Lewiston Country Club. Embracing Jeanne's sons, Daniel and Travis, as his own, they embarked on countless adventures, traveling the world, enjoying golf, and cherishing life's simple pleasures. They were able to live life to its fullest over the years. Jeanne's unwavering care and love brought comfort to Gary in his later years, and this December would have marked the 25th year of their marriage.\n\nGary is preceded in death by his parents, Isom (Ike) and Dollie Medley, and his brothers Don and Dick.\n\nHe is survived by his devoted wife, Jeanne Medley; his children Corey (Leslie) Medley, Hope Coleman, and Nikki (Jason) Anderson, along with Daniel (Lauren) Port and Travis (Karly) Port, and his ten grandchildren.\n\nA celebration of Gary's life will be held on Sunday, July 21st at 3 p.m. at the Orofino Golf and Country Club.

Steve was a great teller of tales and embellisher of stories. Many of his favorite memories were of his younger days in Coulee, causing mischief with his cousins or of the family gatherings which were held in Coulee and continued annually over the following decades. He graduated from high school in Ashland, Ore., in 1966 before taking various college courses and eventually enlisting in the U.S. Army from 1970 to 1972.

He grew up with his sister June in Pomona, Calif. He was married to Lynn Whitney in 1981. He and Lynn had many adventures together: running a floatplane company in Alaska, motorcycling in Mexico and throughout the West, scuba diving, flying in their private plane to many fun destinations, and traveling to visit their adult kids throughout the country and beyond.\n\nGail is survived by his wife, Lynn Whitney Mathers; five children: Lisa Stugelmayer (Jim), Greg Mathers (Mary Grace), Laina Brown (Jeff), Laurelyn Bergin (Wes) and stepdaughter, Alistaire Clary (Tyler); 12 grandchildren: Brock Stugelmayer, Hannah Stugelmayer, Aubrey Gerber, Morgan Mathers, Rachael Mathers, Jenna Brown, Logan Brown, Caden Brown, Brennan Bergin, Ashton Bergin, Carson Clary and Kellen Clary. His sister, June Vitelle, passed in April of this year. She was survived by her husband Vern Vitelle.\n\nGail loved spending time with his kids and provided many memorable activities while raising them. They still tell stories of the epic horse trail ride and camping trip they took together when young. He also loved the hunting trips with his long-time friends Mandy Miles and Darrel VonBargen.\n\nGail had four very special friends from high school in Pomona: Bob Owsley, Gordon Anderson, Lowell McGrane and Eric Hasenbeck. They had such a great bond that they stayed in touch and had get-togethers right to the end.\n\nGail graduated with a bachelor's degree in accounting from San Diego State University. He then went to work for Price Waterhouse as an accountant and auditor. From there he went to Potlatch Corporation to eventually become their Fiber and Lands Manager, based in Lewiston, and traveled much of the world. He developed and owned the truck dealership, North American Diesel in the 1980s. In the early 1990s he was hired by Columbia Resource Company in Vancouver, Wash., to help the waste management company develop a landfill and recycling facility.\n\nHe was an accomplished businessman, but when he got the opportunity, he completely changed his focus of work and became a bush pilot for Orofino Aviation and McCall Air. He later became the Vice President and COO of Taquan Air, a floatplane company in Ketchikan, Alaska. His last position before retirement was with M.A. DeAtley Corporation as their Corporate Pilot and Safety Coordinator.\n\nHe was especially proud that he had worked hard to obtain many professional pilot licenses: Airline Transport Pilot, Multi Engine Land Commercial Pilot, Single Engine Land and Sea Pilot, and Instrument Rating.\n\nGail also was committed to his community as evidenced by the leadership positions he held as a commissioner for the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport, Vice-Chair of the Clark County Solid Waste Advisory Commission, President and Director of North Idaho Children's Home Board, Director of Tri-State Memorial Hospital Board, member of the Lewis-Clark State College Industrial Vocational Advisory Committee, Director and Executive Board Member Lewis-Clark Boy Scout Council, Director of the Lewiston Boys and Girls Club Board and Director of United Way of Lewiston-Clarkston.\n\nGail will never be forgotten and will always be loved.\n\nA memorial service for family will be held on Saturday, July 13.

Bailey and Anne Marie Steinbach-Bailey, he joined his two older brothers. Dad entered into rest Dec. 15, 2023 in the late evening hours of the day.\n\nVern, as most knew him, spent his childhood in Sanders, ID, where he attended school. He later moved to St. Maries, ID, with his parents and siblings. As a young man he was a taxi driver and drove truck for the St. Maries Lumber Co.\n\nDad joined the Army on April 7, 1953 where he served his country. Dad was grateful to have experienced military life and spoke of his adventures in later years. It was evident from his stories that he was proud to serve. Dad received the National Defense Service Medal and after two years of active service was transferred to the Army Reserves for eight years. Dad was honorably discharged on June 16th, 1961.\n\nDad fell in love with Ethel Carolyn Devoe and they married May 19, 1956.

Dad was always known for his hard work and dedication to providing for his family. Dad owned and operated his own log truck for 19 years and during the summer months would load one of us kids up for some one on one time. When he wasn't hauling logs, he was working down \"south\" hauling grain where we'd get to ride along there too. Dad worked for several local logging companies but settling in with K.J. Weller Logging proved to be his favorite. Never really ready to retire, it finally caught up to him. He called it a day in early 2002 and retired to his property where he continued caring for his own place.\n\nDad loved his horses and owned several throughout his life. He enjoyed fishing, bird hunting, camping and boating, even though he was afraid of water. He was known to enjoy a little gambling too. In his retirement he learned everything he could about birds and became well versed in identifying local species. He faithfully fed hundreds of his feathered friends while he marveled at the handy work of God. Commenting always how their coloring couldn't be happenstance, they were painted by a loving Creator.\n\nHe is survived by his son, Scott Bailey of Colburn, ID; daughters, Dawn Powers of The Dallas, OR, and Dana Hoskins (Steve) of Troy, ID. He is survived by sisters, Donna Brown, Dorla Spicer; and brother, Steve Bailey, all of St. Maries. He is survived by grandchildren, Jami Powers, Andrew Therianos, Amanda Moore, Carly Hoskins-Geidl and Brooke Hoskins-Schlake, DMV. He is also survived by several great grandchildren.\n\nDad was preceded in death by his parents and brothers, Philip, Ross, Bruce and Jerry. He was also preceded in death by his daughter, Carolyn; and grandson, Andy Moore.\n\nDad and Mom ended up divorcing after 24 years of marriage but his heart was always with her. He never remarried and remained single the rest of his life.\n\nA private family gathering is planned for this summer. In lieu of flowers Dad would ask that you hang a bird feeder in his honor.\n\nPhotos: LaVern Dee Bailey\n\nRamona Voegele, Grangeville\n\nRamona Voegele, of Grangeville, ID passed away at Grangeville Health and Rehabilitation of Cascadia on May 24, 2024.\n\nTrenary Funeral Home will be handling arrangements.\n\nGregory Smith, 70, Syringa\n\nGregory \"Greg\" M.

She was born May 11, 1938.\n\nAnn was the third child and only daughter of Stanton and Leona (Wagner) Becker of Genesee. Her earliest memories included summers spent with her dad, changing irrigation pipes at the \"River Ranch\" on the Snake River and trailing cows on horseback through Lewiston to summer pasture in the Three Bear area near Deary.\n\nShe attended the St Mary's Catholic School in Genesee before transferring to the High School as a freshman. There she met Jon Nilsson, and they began a life-long romance that carried them through seven decades and life on two continents. She graduated valedictorian in 1956 and Magna Cum Laude from the University of Idaho in 1960. She received her Masters from the UI in 1962.

In 1962, they welcomed daughter, Caroline, followed by sons, Kirk (1964) and Jon Stanton (1965).\n\nIn 1970 they were selected as a family to serve in the \"Peace Corps Volunteer\" program.

His family would like to thank the Parkside staff for their excellent care and compassion.\n\nHarry was born to Albert Meade and Buena Vista VanDevender on Nov. 20, 1924, near Weippe.\n\nFor Harry, every day was an opportunity to begin a new adventure, take a chance and experience life to the fullest.\n\nIn his younger years, he daydreamed about flying airplanes through the canyons near his home on the breaks of Lolo Creek near Fraser, Idaho.\n\nAfter leaving home on traveling adventures, he obtained a job working in the Kaiser shipyards in Vancouver, Wash. There, he received his draft notice in early 1943.\n\nLater, in Basic Training, he saw an offer on the bulletin board to enter Pilot training. Harry was accepted for the program and began to fulfill his boyhood dreams. He started Officer Candidate School in Albion, Mich., where he met the love of this life, Freda Anna Radtke. It seems that there was a shortage of transportation in Albion and at one of their social functions, Freda was twirling a set of car keys that caught Harry's eye. They continued their relationship throughout his flight training and were married Sept. 2, 1944, in Independence, Kan.\n\nIn early 1945, Harry was in B-24 Bomber flight training and was sent to Germany shortly after WWII. There, he was placed in charge of communications for three airbases near Munich, Germany.\n\nIn 1947, the newly created US Air Force was established, and he took the opportunity as a Captain to transfer from the Army Air Corps.\n\nHe later participated in the \"Berlin Airlift\", flying food and supplies to isolated Berlin.\n\nWhen the Korean War broke out, he was sent to south Korea where he served until his honorable discharge in 1953. Upon returning to the United States, he and Freda purchased a summer resort in Buhl, Idaho, which they ran for four years together.\n\nHarry was an entrepreneur and later took on several businesses, including stud logging, manufacturing cedar shakes, running a gas station and investing in common stock and mutual funds.\n\nHe is survived by his only son, Jim (Janet) VanDevender of Malaga, Wash.; four grandchildren, Tama (Bob) Naden of Orofino, April (Jeff) Patton, of Warren, Ore., Bryce (Rachel) VanDevender of Norman, Okla. and Robin (Erik) Olsen of Warren, Ore. Harry also has eight great grandchildren: Robert Naden III, Juliaetta, Samuel Naden, Lewiston, Wyatt Patton, Scappoose, Ore., Brooke VanDevender, New Castle, Okla., Ethan VanDevender, Norman, Okla., Marcus VanDevender, Norman, Chase Olsen, Centrailia, Wash. and Trever Olsen, Scappoose.\n\nHarry was a man of many talents and interests. He enjoyed playing several instruments, playing the fiddle with an old-time fiddler's band, dancing, traveling, flying his plane and also lending a hand when someone needed their car fixed. He will always be remembered for his strength, courage, self-determination, and zest for life. He was truly a member of the Greatest Generation! We will always miss our Grandpa Harry, God Bless you!\n\nTo sign the online guestbook or to send condolence to the family visit www.tualatinvalleyfa.com.\n\nPhoto: Harry Jenson VanDevender\n\nSandra 'Sonnie' Brewer Campbell, 81, formerly of Peck\n\nSandra 'Sonnie' Brewer Campbell, our beloved aunt, sister-in-law and friend passed away in July of 2023 at Guardian Angel Homes in Liberty Lake, Wash. She was born May 14, 1942.\n\nSonnie was the second daughter, and baby of the family, born to Helen and Straw Brewer.\n\nShe is survived by her family; niece and nephew, Tammy Grytness Welch (Mark) and Jeff Grytness; brother-in-law, Dick Grytness; cousins, Sabra Colpitts (Cletus) and Steve Dietz (Lorie); and great aunt, Norma Wells.\n\nShe was a beloved \"aunt\" to Katie Welch, Peter Welch, Caleb Colpitts, Kazden Colpitts and Seth Colpitts.\n\nShe was predeceased by her parents; sister, Zona Grytness; and great aunt and uncles, Gail Dietz, Dayton Wells and Tom Wells.\n\nSonnie grew up in Peck, where her parents owned the Peck Store. She went to school in Peck and later attended Orofino High School, graduating in 1960.\n\nAfter high school, Sonnie attended cosmetology school in Lewiston, and later worked in the restaurant industry in Lewiston and Spokane, Wash.\n\nHer love of people and infectious personality made her a beloved member of the restaurant industry and broader community. Her customers were known to follow her to new restaurants and shift their dining plans to align with her schedule.\n\nShe was known for her kindness, thoughtfulness and caring personality. She made every stranger a friend. She took great joy in meeting her friends in Spokane for a weekly breakfast group, these friends were a light and support to her throughout her life and during her final years with Alzheimers.\n\nSonnie loved life and had many passions and enthusiasms. Travel was a favorite activity, especially if it involved family. She traveled with family all over the world including Scandinavia, Asia, Panama, Washington D.C., Alaska and many trips to see family in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nShe loved the beach, tolerated camping with her family, looked for any reason to throw a party, and enjoyed a good box of chocolate. Her birthday was always celebrated with spaghetti, meatballs and watermelon.\n\nHer enduring legacy will always be the way she loved and was loved by her family. She was one of the most dependable people I know, her love language was \"being there\". Whether it was a graduation, wedding, a ballet recital for a five year, or watching hours of Little League Baseball games. She took tremendous joy in her role as \"aunt\". Our family could not have had a better supporter, protector, cheerleader or listener.\n\nHer family would like to thank the caregivers at Guardian Angel Liberty Lake and her friends who continued to visit and reach out to Sonnie during her illness.\n\nA celebration of life will be held June 22 in Orofino, Idaho at Riverside Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers please send donations to the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nPhoto: Sandra 'Sonnie' Brewer Campbell\n\nMaebellann Steadman, 86, Weippe\n\nWith heavy hearts, we announce the passing of Maebellann Steadman, a longtime resident of Weippe, Idaho. Born in Montana on June 16, 1937 she peacefully departed in her sleep on April 24, 2024. She was the beloved wife of Ronald Steadman, with whom she shared a loving union in 1958. Together, they navigated life's joys and challenges, much like the meandering drives the two often took together throughout the beautiful Idaho landscape, creating cherished memories that will endure for generations.\n\nMaebellann's life was intertwined with the tenderness and laughter of her family. As a sibling among 10 brothers and sisters, she held a special place in each of their hearts. Her home was always filled with the warmth of family and friends gathering, card playing, vanilla ice cream, taffy making, and laughter in her kitchen where friendship flowed abundantly.\n\nShe leaves behind a legacy of love and devotion in her two children, Donald and Roxann; her five grandchildren; many great and great-great grandchildren who were the light of her life. Each moment spent with them was a precious gift. Her fingers never turned purple no matter how many huckleberries she picked, somehow always picking more than anybody else, which she used to make her famous huckleberry cheesecake cherished by all.\n\nMaebellann was one of Jehovah's Witnesses for many years and lived her life guided by Bible faith. She found strength and comfort in her beliefs.\n\nIn honoring her wishes, there will be no funeral or memorial services held. Instead, those who knew and loved Maebellann are encouraged to take solace in the memories they shared and the love that will forever remain in their hearts. We are eternally grateful for the outpouring of kindness and support from friends and family during this time of mourning.\n\nPhoto Maebellann Steadman\n\nBrian Pomerinke, 54, formerly of Orofino\n\nBrian Pomerinke passed away from natural causes Saturday, April 20, 2024, at his apartment in Lewiston. He was 54 years old. Brian was born Feb. 18, 1970, in Clarkston, Wash.\n\nIn 1973, he moved with his parents to McCall where he lived until 1976. They then moved to Pocatello living there until 1982 when they moved back to McCall. In 1984, the family moved to Orofino where Brian graduated from Orofino High School in 1988. He then attended the University of Idaho.\n\nBrian worked for the Jaype Mill and, upon its closing, attended Lewis-Clark State College where he earned an associate degree in mechanical engineering and automated manufacturing. Using these skills, he worked for Thunderjet Boat Manufacturing for the last 29 years of his life.\n\nBrian was an avid sportsman.

A gathering with refreshments will follow.\n\nPhoto: Brian Pomerinke\n\nAshley Lahaie, 32, Lewiston\n\nAshley Lahaie, 32, of Lewiston, Idaho passed away on U.S. Highway 12 on April 25, 2024.\n\nTrenary Funeral Home is overseeing the arrangements.\n\nDouglas Wonders, 76, Kamiah\n\nDouglas Wonders, 76, of Kamiah, Idaho passed away at St. Mary's Medical Clinic on April 22, 2024.\n\nTrenary Funeral Home is overseeing the arrangements.\n\nEthel Hunter-Kaufmann, 98, Orofino\n\nEthel Josephine Hunter-Kaufmann departed peacefully from this life to the next on April 25, 2024. She would have been 99 this June.\n\nBorn June 23, 1925 to William and Mary Ann (Pranger) Waibel, Ethel was raised with her seven siblings (Clara, Ray, Bud, Larry, Joe, Frannie, and Bertie) on the family dairy in Midway, Oregon. As a girl she attended school at Midway Elementary and graduated from Hillsboro High School, in Hillsboro, Oregon. Ethel helped work the family farm while growing up, and worked picking strawberries for one of the neighboring farms in the summer.\n\nDuring WWII, while three of the four brothers served overseas, Ethel and her sisters worked hard to keep the family dairy running. When she could find time, Ethel would attend local USO dances, and played catcher on the local girls' softball team.\n\nFollowing the war, Ethel met Rhoda Hunter, and the two were married on Sept. 27, 1950. They made their home in Orofino, Idaho, and built their house on top of a hill looking over the Clearwater River. They welcomed their son Dan in 1956, and Keith followed in 1958.\n\nEthel worked as a homemaker until 1962, when she began working as a dispatcher for Clearwater County Sheriff's Office, following Rhoda's first heart attack. In 1972, she left the Sheriff's office and transferred to Magistrate Court as the chief deputy clerk. In 1979, she was elected to the office of Clearwater County Assessor, serving in that position for a term and two years, then contracting with the county as a district court support officer, retiring in 2005. However, her strong work ethic didn't make her transition to retirement easy…Ethel could often be found working and volunteering for St. Theresa's Catholic Church, or at home working in her garden, growing veggies and tending the best berry patches ever!\n\nShe was also an amazing cook, and always had homemade bread, cinnamon rolls, ice cream and cookies available for anyone that would stop in for a visit. Home cooked meals brought family members around the dining room table, not just at holidays, but any time they came for a visit.\n\nEthel was a very active member of St. Theresa's Catholic Church, in Orofino, for more than 60 years. Her dedication to the church was immense; you could always find her at Mass each week, cooking meals or hosting coffee hour in the Little Flower Room, working yard sales, and running the doughboy booth at Orofino Lumberjack Days each fall. Her faith in God and the waiting rewards of heaven was unfailing, and she never missed a day praying the rosary, always remembering to include her family and friends in her prayers.\n\nEthel valued family over everything. She had a remarkable relationship with her siblings throughout her lifetime, especially with her sisters, Frannie and Bertie, and her brother Joe, and always enjoyed returning to Hillsboro for visits with them and the rest of the family.\n\nAfter 32 years of marriage, Rhoda passed away in May of 1983 from a heart attack. Ethel rekindled a friendship with Al Kaufmann, who had been a friend of the family back in Hillsboro. The two were married in September of 1984, and returned to Idaho to live on the hill in Orofino. They were married for 27 years, until Al's passing in 2011. Ethel continued to live at the family home at the top of \"Hunter Hill\" until 2019, when she needed more assistance getting around.\n\nEthel was preceded in death by her parents, all seven of her siblings, her husband Rhoda, and her second husband Al. She is survived by her sons, Dan (Kristi) Hunter of Orofino, Keith (Diane) Hunter of Mead, Wash.; granddaughter, Danyel (Jay) Ward; and great-grandson, Finn of Pinehurst; granddaughter, Kelly (Caylun) Peterson and great-granddaughter, Chloe of Spokane; along with numerous nieces, nephews, and dear friends. She will be missed greatly by her family and friends.\n\nServices will be held on Saturday, May 11, at St. Theresa's Church in Orofino. Rosary will begin at 10:30, with mass at 11 a.m. and a light lunch to follow. Per her wishes, Ethel has been cremated, and interment will take place at a later date at St. Matthew's Church in Hillsboro.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (www.ccfa.org) in her name.\n\nPhoto: Ethel Josephine Hunter-Kaufmann\n\nDavid Charles Wright, 85, former OES principal\n\nDavid Charles Wright was reunited with Dorothy Mae Wright on the morning of April 12, 2024. He was born March 4, 1939 to C. E. Jack and Nellie May (Flynn) Wright in Dayton, Wash. He grew up on the Battle Ridge family ranch and graduated from Stites High School (later to be merged into Clearwater Valley High School) in 1956.\n\nAfter high school, Dave attended the College of Idaho in Caldwell for a year to pursue a degree in education and play football. A summer logging accident forced him to change course and he attended the Lewis Clark Normal School in Lewiston. As luck would have it, he met Dorothy and they were married on Aug. 30, 1958 until her death in 2012.\n\nHe completed his undergraduate degree at the College of Idaho and went on to obtain his Master's Degree from the University of Idaho. Dave's journey in education took him to Kamiah, Lake Quinault, Wash., Benton City, Wash., Moxee, Wash., and ended in Orofino, as the principal of Orofino Elementary School for nearly 22 years.\n\nDave enjoyed coaching and the camaraderie among the coaches and players where he made many lifelong friends. He coached football, basketball, and track and field at some of the various stops prior to becoming a principal. Even when principal at Orofino Elementary, he conducted basketball programs for elementary students and stepped in to coach freshman basketball when needed.\n\nUpon his \"retirement\" to the family ranch on Battle Ridge near Kooskia where he raised cattle and trees, he couldn't stay away from coaching. He coached the Clearwater Valley girls softball team, a position he would admit he knew little about, but nonetheless put in the time and energy and led the girls to a successful season. He also obliged a request to help with the football program at Clearwater Valley High School in 1997 which unexpectedly led to the head coaching position, a mere 30 years between head football coaching jobs (1967-1997). Again, he put in the time and energy and got the most out of the kids. One could describe him as appreciating effort over ability.\n\nSubsequently, Dave went on to help coach at Kamiah and Orofino for many years, the latter to follow his grandson. In 2016, he received the Duane D. Wolfe Memorial award from the Idaho High School Activities Association (IHSAA) for lifetime service and commitment. He essentially had a second career after \"retirement\" and treated it like a full-time job. Dave finally retired at age 77.\n\nDave was a caring dad and grandpa. As a dad, rarely missed a game, and there were many over the years. As a grandpa, he loved hearing of the grandkids' activities and accomplishments and attended as many as he could. Like Dorothy, Dave enjoyed the wildlife on Battle Ridge. One of his daily rituals was a afternoon drive looking for deer and elk.\n\nDave is survived by two sons, Jeff of Orofino, Rob (Laurie) of Coeur d'Alene; four grandchildren, Jordyn Creighton (Brent) of Nampa, D.J. (Alicia) of Reno, Nev., Jaime Kiff (Adam) of Oklahoma City, Okla., and Stephanie Wright of Wichita, Kan., and two great grandchildren, Deklyn Creighton and Ellery Kiff.\n\nServices will be conducted at 11 a.m. on May 4 at Clearwater Valley High School in Kooskia. The family requests, in lieu of flowers, memorials could be donations to the Syringa Hospice Program or financial assistance with the Clearwater Valley High School weight program.\n\nPhoto: David Charles Wright\n\nMary Pankey, 84, Kooskia\n\nMary passed away Friday, April 19th at Orofino Hospital, under the excellent and compassionate care of Dr. Brown and the hospital staff. Mary was born in her childhood home at Kooskia, Idaho, on March 24th, 1940. The home was in her family for nearly nine decades.\n\nMary attended the Kooskia schools, graduating as Salutatorian at Clearwater Valley High School (CVHS) in 1958.\n\nAfter a couple of years attending the University of Idaho at Moscow, Idaho, she returned to Kooskia and married Steve Pankey, a local merchant, on May 5th, 1962. They missed their upcoming (63 year) anniversary by two weeks.\n\nMary was known for her quiet reserve and strength of character. She loved her home and garden and kept them full of beautiful plants and flowers.\n\nMrs. Harris, a local school teacher, had trained Mary in bookkeeping during high school; and after getting married she pursued that calling throughout her life-doing the books/accounting for the various family enterprises. She also loved to read and as such, read a mountain of books in her lifetime. Mary got interested in genealogy and spent over 20 years researching her family lineage. She wrote an excellent history of her family that dated all the way back to the 1500s.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Elmer and Marcella Parsell; her brother, Richard \"Dick\" Parsell; her brother, Neal \"Pete\" Parsell; her brother-in-law, Gene (Margaret) Pankey; and her daughter, Mary Michelle Pankey.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Steve Pankey; daughter, Julieann Pankey Mamula, son-in-law Tyler Mamula; grandsons, Gabriel Kirish and Jaxon Mamula; brother-in-law, Jim (Cheryln) Pankey; sister-in-law, Lynda (Leon) Swinehart; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nMary was a very private person and requested to have no memorial and no service.\n\nTrenary Funeral Home is caring for arrangements.\n\nJames Theodore Woolbright, 34, Woodland\n\nJames Theodore Woolbright was born the second of two children, and the only son of James Marvin and Janis Carol (Hilliker) Woolbright in McMinnville, Yamhill County, Oregon on May 18, 1989. His family, having recently moved from Enterprise, Oregon lived in McMinnville for the next 10 years, during which he was home schooled along with his older sister Julie Ann (Betsy).\n\nJimmy, as he was known during his childhood and youth, often went on \"field trips\" with his family, traveling to museums, national and state parks, sites of historical and geologic interest, places of interesting flora and fauna.\n\nThe excellent education provided primarily by his dedicated mother's skilled and diligent efforts set for him a pattern of self-directed learning that continued for the rest of his life and served him well.\n\nAt an early age James was led by his mother into a personal and saving relationship with the Lord Jesus, thus beginning his life-long pilgrimage in pursuit of deeper knowledge of, increased closeness to, and more perfect imitation of his Creator and Redeemer.\n\nFrom the time he was about 5 until about age 15, he participated with his sister in the AWANA program, and like his sister, was an efficient and voracious \"memorizing machine\", storing vast portions of scripture, and winning many awards, certificates, and trophies.\n\nAt the age of 10 James's family moved to live with his paternal grandmother on a small acreage near Kennewick, Wash.\n\nAfter spending about a year there, they moved to Woodland, where he lived on his family's small farm until his death.\n\nComputers, Legos, photography, cars, select genres of music (best typified by that of John Michael Talbot), literature and poetry, history, writing, gardening and horticulture all captured his interest for periods of time, but Bible - all things Bible - biblical archaeology, ancient Near East geopolitical history, customs of ancient peoples of the Near East, biblical hermeneutics, biblical languages, analysis and comparison of pseudepigraphal and apocryphal texts - all these and subjects allied to them dominated his interest, time, and energy for the last 20 years of his life and he became, in the eyes of an astute, unbiased observer of excellent biblical scholars (his father!), a biblical scholar of highest research excellence, unmatched scholastic integrity, and unparalleled perceptivity, discernment and analysis of patterns in text. In his research he was exhaustively thorough, scrupulously honest, rigorously self-critical, diligence in literary and source comparisons. In writing he was relentlessly perfectionistic in matters of grammar, logical flow of thought, and smoothness of style. His keen eye, his careful attention to detail, his unflagging pursuit of perfection put him in some demand as a personal editor.\n\nHis demeanor was quiet, unassuming, even meek, but his communication was direct, clear, unambiguous, and elucidating. He did not offer commentary on anything speculatively, preferring not to speak at all if not with certainty and authority. In questions of Bible-related concerns he never failed to provide answers that were quietly delivered but altogether satisfying.\n\nAlthough James was a serious person who eschewed trivial concerns and flippancy, and avoided those persons who were habitually trivial or flippant, and although he often appeared to be wearing a scowl, the switch on his humor apparatus was never turned to the \"off\" position; his humor was keen, active, dry, always engaged.\n\nAlthough James was a quiet person who preferred to remain in secondary background roles, and to be unnoticed, all who had opportunity to know him recognized in him a treasure of the very most noble of character qualities: in dealing with others - gentleness, quietness, loyalty, tenderheartedness, compassion, mercy, and a forgiving, unbiased spirit that sought to make peace, serving others before himself; with regard to himself and his duties and tasks - diligent, thorough, reliable, responsible, untiringly conscientious in work for himself or for others, relentless in pursuit of duty; and with regard to his Creator - unceasing in pursuit of the high calling of Christ, to be conformed to His image, to be a man after His heart.\n\nJames passed away sometime the morning of Monday, March 18 of natural causes. Although autopsy results remain pending, it is thought that his death was, as was his mother's, related to Marfan syndrome and rupture of an aneurysm of a major blood vessel.\n\n\"Only one life, so soon will be passed -- only what's done for Christ will last.\"\n\nJames was only recently preceded in death by his mother, Janis, with whom he was very close, and to whose care he dedicated himself when she was not well and his father was away working.\n\nHe is survived by his father, James M. Woolbright; his sister, Julie Ann (Betsy) Woolbright; nieces Andrea and Miles, all of Woodland; his grandmother, Jane Woolbright; sister, Polly Silvas (Reuben); cousins, Karina and Kendra; sister Connie (Allen), of Kennewick, Wash., and his cats.\n\nFuneral will be at 11 a.m. Saturday, April 20, 2024 at Kamiah Bible Church, 521 10th St., Kamiah, Idaho. A catered lunch will follow. Those who wish to do so may bring a dessert.\n\nBurial will be the following day, Sunday, April 21, after regular morning worship service at Woodland Friends Church. Graveside service and burial will be in the Woodland Cemetery, which adjoins the church. All who wish to attend Sunday school and / or morning worship service at Woodland Friends Church are welcomed to do so. At six o'clock Sunday evening there will be, in the basement of Woodland Friends Church, a fellowship night in his honor. All are invited to attend and enjoy provided food, and are encouraged to bring their own covered dish food or dessert if desired.\n\nThe Woolbright family thanks Blackmer Funeral Home of Grangeville for their expert and compassionate assistance.\n\nPhoto: James Theodore Woolbright\n\nCoral Jane Sawyer Lee, 73, Orofino\n\nCoral Jane Sawyer Lee went home to be with Jesus on Tuesday, April 9, 2024 from a brain aneurysm.\n\nCoral was born on April 28, 1950 in Loup City, Nebraska to Keith and Vivian Sawyer. At 4 years old, Coral and her family moved to Upper Fords Creek where she lived most of her life. One of her many prides was having three generations living on this property and all using the same bus stop throughout the years.\n\nCoral met the love of her life in the office at Orofino High School in 1967. They married two years later and started building their family in 1971 when they had their first son, Bruce and Mark the following January in 1972.\n\nTo know Coral was to absolutely love her. Her heart of gold shown in many facets. From fostering several children to being the Clearwater County Grandma or Auntie Coral, she loved kids! Coral volunteered many summers as nurse for 4-H Camp and the Sixth Grade Forestry Tour. She truly loved educating youth on managing their own health care and safety measures.\n\nFour years ago, Coral, along with her sister Christine, restarted the Orofino Adventist Christian School. She was a very active member of the Orofino Seventh-day Adventist Church and lived out her faith daily. She loved Jesus with all her heart."
