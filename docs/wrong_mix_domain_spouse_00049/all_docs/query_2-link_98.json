Gallery-worthy art by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Jenny Holzer, Richard Prince, Sarah Sze, Julian Schnabel and others will also be exhibited, many now in Tiffany’s permanent collection.\n\nBY STEPHEN WALLIS\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY BY NAGI SAKAI\n\nApril 2023\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/tiffany-new-york-city-store-reopen-basquiat-prince-schnabel-holzer-d5ef7eb2\n\nWhen Tiffany & Co. reopens its New York City flagship on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street this spring, following three years of work, visitors will hardly recognize the street-level sales floor famously featured in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Or any other floor, for that matter. Where dark-green marble and teak columns once surrounded a bank of art deco elevators, a showstopping painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat now hangs. It’s the same one, Equals Pi, that featured prominently in Tiffany’s 2021 ad campaign starring married musicians Jay-Z and Beyoncé, who crooned “MoonRiver,” the theme song of the 1961 movie. The canvas was chosen especially for the robin’s-egg-blue background that nearly matches Tiffany’s own trademarked blue. It’s an intentionally placed lure—inviting in those tourists who come to re-create Audrey Hepburn’s dreamy window-shopping scene.\n\nIn the new-look Tiffany, splashy art abounds: A concave, faceted stainless-steel Anish Kapoor wall sculpture in the third-floor wedding and engagement area seems tailor-made for celebratory ring-shopping selfies. Step off the elevators on the sixth floor, which is devoted to home and accessories, and there is one of Julian Schnabel’s signature broken-crockery paintings, from his Victory series; it depicts flowering rosebushes inspired by those that grow on his property in Montauk, New York. Schnabel has also created a limited-edition series of plates, which make their debut as part of an installation he conceived using a seven-foot-long tiled table surrounded by hand- painted bronze chairs with velvet cushions, all made by him, displayed next to one of his famed Blind Girl paintings, which is on loan to Tiffany.\n\nThe project is a rare commercial collaboration for Schnabel, who says his connection with the company, as with so many people, goes back to Audrey Hepburn and Breakfast at Tiffany’s. But the biggest factor in his decision to participate was the man who reached out, Peter Marino, the New York–based architect and art collector.\n\nFor decades, Marino has been a go-to architect for LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, masterminding sumptuous, often art-filled boutiques for LVMH’s brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Bulgari, Hublot and Fendi, including several near Tiffany on 57th Street. (And in Paris, the new Dior flagship, which includes a gallery and a restaurant.) Soon after finalizing its $15.8 billion acquisition of Tiffany in January 2021, LVMH brought in Marino to take over renovations of the Fifth Avenue flagship, which had been planned under Tiffany’s previous management team and were already underway. He set out to reimagine virtually every aspect of the flagship’s interior.\n\nLVMH’s goal for the 186-year-old American jewelry and luxury goods company is to marry Tiffany’s legacy of venerable design with cool, contemporary style. Nowhere are those efforts more important than inside the iconic Fifth Avenue store, now dubbed the Landmark (despite it not holding landmark status). Not only the crown jewel of Tiffany’s 337 boutiques worldwide, it is also central to the firm’s history and identity.“\n\nWe see the building as a cultural hub,” says the company’s president and CEO, Anthony Ledru. “Without it, Tiffany is not the same brand.” While declining to cite specific numbers, Ledru says the renovation represents “by a lot” the largest investment LVMH has made on a single store, overall and specifically for art.\n\nThat investment speaks to LVMH’s business ambitions for the brand, which has been something of a star performer since joining the group’s portfolio. “We doubled the business on high jewelry the first year, and we doubled again the second year, which is quite exceptional,” says Ledru. The next step, he says, is updating existing Tiffany stores or creating new ones. “This year, there’s really a big acceleration at the global level—in Tokyo, in Seoul, in Paris, in Milan, in London,” he says. “The Landmark is the first big one.”\n\nThe granite, marble and limestone art deco facade of Cross & Cross’s seven-story 1940 building has been preserved, and its familiar bronze Atlas clock—refurbished and reinstalled—still flexes its muscles above the Fifth Avenue marquee. On top, a new, eye-catching three-story glass extension, designed by architect Shohei Shigematsu of the firm OMA, glows like a beacon.\n\nInside, “it’s a total new building,” says Marino, who recounts getting a call about the project from Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the morning after the deal closed. The aim, Marino says, was to create a fresh look and identity for Tiffany, which, as he puts it, “had drifted towards a very middle ground of taste, totally nondescript.”\n\nA major component of the strategy is art, both specially commissioned works and existing ones acquired for the project. Many areas of the building now display works by blue-chip names like Richard Prince, Jenny Holzer, Damien Hirst, James Turrell, Rashid Johnson and Sarah Sze, in addition to Schnabel, Kapoor, Basquiat and others. While art is a standard component in the LVMH-Marino luxury retail playbook, here it was taken to another level.\n\n“What you’ll see in the store is quite unique in terms of the number of artworks and the pedigree of the artists,” says Alexandre Arnault, executive vice president for product and communication at Tiffany and Bernard Arnault’s second-oldest son. Arnault fils consulted closely with Marino and his father—one of the world’s leading art collectors—on acquisitions and commissions.\n\nEven before the renovations, few stores could match the Tiffany flagship’s draw as a nexus of culture and commerce, occupying a prominent position on one of the world’s most famous shopping corridors. Still, visitors today expect visually stimulating and shareable displays or in-store amenities that go beyond shopping.\n\nThe sixth-floor cafe, originally introduced in 2017, has been redesigned, featuring jewelry-themed ceramic wall sculptures by Molly Hatch, and will be called the Blue Box Café by Daniel Boulud. Galleries on the eighth and ninth floors will host long-term rotating exhibitions. “We really wanted to give the feeling of this being more than just a store and a full experience,” says Alexandre Arnault.\n\nMany of the artworks in the store have a connection with Tiffany, whether visually, in their use of Tiffany-like blues, or with their content. And several of the works that will be on display, including pieces by Jenny Holzer, Richard Prince, Sarah Sze and Schnabel, are part of Tiffany’s permanent collection. Basquiat’s Equals Pi is on loan from the LVMH collection, and there will be a group of works on loan from Marino.\n\nOn the ground floor, a commission by Not Vital that is encircled by the central jewelry counter features 15 abstract portraits—geometric totems, essentially—of famous women who have worn Tiffany, from Shirley Temple to Babe Paley to Jackie Kennedy. Modeled in silver, the figures reflect the spectacular skylight overhead devised by Paris architect Hugh Dutton with “new technology, glass beams,” Marino says, “and it literally resembles a cut diamond, with thousands of facets.”\n\nOn the third floor, Marino enlisted artist Rashid Johnson to create a commission for the Rose Salon, so called for its blush-pink fabric walls. The more than 12-foot-tall piece is part of his Falling Man series, featuring upside-down figures, typically composed of mirrored or ceramic tiles, their blocky bodies evoking the pixelated characters of early video games. For this iteration, Johnson painted the figure using wax over tiles custom-colored in Tiffany Blue.\n\n“These works are meant to be kind of existential investigations, meaning the idea of man falling through space, finding himself,” explains Johnson. Working with Tiffany Blue fit into his ongoing experimentations with expanding his color palette. “Using that color within this context really speaks to the place,” he says.\n\nAsked if any artists took issue with the idea of incorporating Tiffany Blue into their commissions, Marino retorts, “You mean, did Michelangelo mind painting Jesus Christ when he was commissioned for the Sistine Chapel? I don’t think so.”\n\nSchnabel, who calls Tiffany Blue “endearing,” used it as the base color for his stoneware plates, which have 22-karat-gold edges and feature the names of artists, filmmakers, writers and musicians, selected and handwritten by Schnabel. “I thought, OK, who would I like to have dinner with? Who do I care about?” he explains. “These are all names that touch a chord somehow in me.”\n\nIt’s a highly personal cast of creatives, some dead, some living, from 17th-century painter Artemisia Gentileschi to 20th-century poet W.H. Auden to contemporary artists Luigi Ontani and Laurie Anderson, both friends of Schnabel’s. Others include musician Benjamin Clementine and movie director heroes such as Luis Buñuel and Héctor Babenco.\n\nA total of 12 names are spread across two sets of six sets of plates, each consisting of a dinner plate, a bread plate and a dessert plate (only five editions of the two sets will be available, priced at $7,000). Schnabel likes to imagine dinner-party guests trading plates to mix and match. “Why not have Lou Reed, W.H. Auden and Luigi Ontani together? It’s a way of rewriting history.”\n\nTiffany has a history of working with artists, dating to 1902, when Louis Comfort Tiffany, son of founder Charles Lewis Tiffany, was tabbed to be the company’s first art director. Decades later, in the 1950s, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns teamed up on window displays for the firm and Andy Warhol created a line of Tiffany greeting cards. (Some collaborations can be risky and have mixed results for long-established brands like Tiffany, as with its recent team-up with Nike on Tiffany Blue “swoosh” sneakers, which were widely criticized by coolhunters online, even as they quickly sold out.)\n\nThe new leadership clearly sees value in partnerships with artists and plans to introduce more in the coming year. “It’s an opportunity for us to speak about our products in a different way,” says Alexandre Arnault, “and a way for us also to gather creative minds that can bring a completely outside view.”\n\nArnault was integral to the company’s collaborations with artist Daniel Arsham, whose limited-edition travel cases for LVMH-owned luggage brand Rimowa were conceived when Arnault was CEO there, and since has produced editioned objects and jewelry designs for Tiffany. Arsham’s 12-foot-tall sculpture Bronze Eroded Venus of Arles is positioned on the store’s third floor, encircled by the graceful staircase Marino designed with Elsa Peretti–inspired curves and transparent balustrades ornamented with rock crystal, as it spirals up to the eighth floor.\n\n“I really turned the gas up on every single floor,” says Marino. “Each is its own planet with its own palette and its own product.”\n\nThe architect replaced dull wall-to-wall carpeting with floors of pale oak parquet and custom-woven area rugs. Dark paneling was swapped out for walls of white marble and shimmering mirror, fabric and expanses of artisanal lacquer. Sculptural display cases were tailored for each area, including dedicated spaces for the brand’s special collections by Tiffany’s legendary designers Jean Schlumberger, Peretti and Paloma Picasso. The furniture includes custom Marino designs, custom artisan designs and significant vintage pieces, reminders by association of Tiffany’s heritage as an exemplar of American design.\n\nOn the third floor, Marino created wavy, pearlescent walls and covered the ceiling in platinum leaf, a refined nod to the silver foil that famously lined the Factory studio of Andy Warhol, his first client. Bordering the floor’s main display areas are private selling rooms, each featuring the work of a different artist. Vik Muniz lined one space in a wallpaper of trompe l’oeil pink peonies he created with collaged bits of painted paper and then photo- graphed. Damien Hirst clad another room with a wallpaper based on his exuberant pointillist-style Cherry Blossom paintings, an installation Marino says is “going to be a heart-stopper.”\n\nMany of the artists who created works for the Fifth Avenue building have long relationships with Marino, few longer than Nancy Lorenz, who has been doing collaborations with him for nearly three decades. Lorenz conceived expansive installations for multiple spaces, including two series of handmade wall panels, her largest-ever commission.\n\nFor the sixth floor—where home is a renewed focus for Tiffany with the appointment of its own artistic director, Lauren Santo Domingo—Lorenz composed elegant panels of blue-gray lacquer inlaid with mother-of-pearl. On the seventh floor, which will feature what Tiffany claims will be the most impressive collection of its high jewelry anywhere in the world, she created atmospheric wraparound panels in lacquer, mother-of-pearl and water-gilt white-gold leaf—contemporary riffs on traditional Japanese cloud screens.\n\nMarino has even conceived of a sort of shrine to Breakfast at Tiffany’s: the so-called Audrey Room on the fifth floor. Declining to reveal details, the architect describes it as a space where “anybody can take a selfie and be part of ‘Moon River.’ ”\n\nA Portrait of the Artist as an Optimist\n\nHank Willis Thomas’s art confronts today’s divisive issues—violence, racism, polarization—in hopes of inspiring mutual understanding and positive action.\n\nBy Stephen Wallis\n\nPhotography by Andre D. Wagner\n\nFall Men’s Style/September 7, 2022\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/hank-willis-thomas-artist-new-show-confront-divisive-issues-11662495935\n\nThroughout the summer, drivers on Long Island’s Route 27 between Southampton and Water Mill have been passing the words “Remember Me” emblazoned in large neon script across the side of the Parrish Art Museum. A yearlong installation by the artist Hank Willis Thomas, those two words radiate with a sense of profound, if uncertain, meaning. Are they a plea? A provocation? An exhortation?\n\nMaybe the answer is all of those things and more, suggests the Brooklyn-based Thomas, 46, who spends a lot of time thinking about the potency and relative truth of words, symbols, gestures and images. The source material for the Parrish piece was an old postcard with a picture of a young rifle-carrying Black man in a hat worn by the 19th-century U.S. cavalry regiments known as the Buffalo Soldiers. “Remember me” was scrawled on the back. The fact that the phrase was handwritten “personifies it, activates it,” says Thomas. “We all want to be acknowledged and remembered.”Remembering, in many ways, is the core of Thomas’s art. Trained as a photographer, he has spent much of his career mining advertising, sports and pop culture images as well as documentary photos of protest, especially from the Civil Rights era. By incorporating these images into his work, Thomas reframes often overlooked historical narratives and highlights their intersections with contemporary issues of race, freedom and justice.\n\n“In these extremely fractured times, Hank Willis Thomas is an invaluable convener of people and ideas, with a genuine desire to connect and foster dialogue, always with an eye to a path forward,” says Parrish curator Corinne Erni, who oversaw Thomas’s facade commission. She also worked with him to organize “Another Justice: US Is Them,” on view at the museum through early November. The exhibition features works by Thomas and 11 of his collaborators in the For Freedoms initiative, which he co-founded in 2016. A forum for artists to participate in public discourse, For Freedoms continues to expand its outreach and mission, which has extra resonance in this midterm season.\n\nIn addition to the Parrish exhibition, Thomas’s New York gallerist, Jack Shainman, has turned over both of his Chelsea spaces to a just-opened show of recent work, and the artist is finishing multiple public art projects, including a memorial on Boston Common to Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King.\n\n“What I love about his work is, on the one hand, it punches you in the gut, and on the other hand, it’s very forward-thinking,” says Shainman, who has worked with Thomas for nearly 20 years. “Hank is an optimist, I do believe.”\n\nThat optimism is reflected in the artist’s sculpture for the King memorial, The Embrace, a 20-foot-high circular bronze that depicts the Kings’ arms intertwined, based on a detail from a photograph of the couple embracing after he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. The monument is slated to be officially unveiled in January 2023, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nCreated with MASS Design Group, Thomas’s frequent collaborators, the memorial is literal and specific in its references—honoring the Kings’ commitment to their social justice work and to each other—but at the same time, the gesture is abstract and universal. “Not everyone can hug, but I’m pretty sure everyone has been hugged,” says Thomas. The design encourages visitors to walk into the center of the memorial, where an oculus opens to the sky above, “and they will be in the heart of the embrace,” the artist says. He likes to imagine the work as “the largest monument to love in the United States of America.”\n\nComposed of some 600 pieces that were first 3-D printed before being cast in bronze, The Embrace is being fabricated at the Walla Walla Foundry in Washington state, where it will be welded into five segments and shipped across the country. The granite plaza beneath it will take the form of a labyrinth, or peace walk, designed with elements of African-American quilt patterns as well as plaques inscribed with the names of 65 local Civil Rights activists, all of whom participated in the Kings’ 20,000-strong march from Roxbury to Boston Common in 1965.\n\n“Our proposal was to say, hey, what if we make this plaza its own memorial...to the ’65 march and elevate some of the unsung heroes of that period, the foot sol- diers, the people locally who fought for economic and social justice,” says MASS Design founder and executive director Michael Murphy. “This could be a catalyst for something bigger and not just something frozen in time, not just one story, but the beginning of hundreds of stories that we have yet to fully find out.” Murphy, who also worked with Thomas on the Gun Violence Memorial Project currently at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., adds that “one of Hank’s strengths is not just understanding how to tell stories but also demanding that we ask of those stories some- thing greater than ourselves.”\n\nA five-foot-high version of The Embrace is included in the Shainman show, which is on view through the end of October, alongside several other sculptures and some of Thomas’s largest so-called retroreflectives to date. Printed on retroreflective vinyl, these works feature photographs—mostly historical—overlaid with washes of color, graphic patterns or painterly marks that partially obscure the primary image. Thomas plays with the fact that retroreflective surfaces appear most clearly in bright light. (Think car headlights on a stop sign.) What observers can see shifts as they move around the work, with the latent image only fully revealed by using a phone’s camera flash or flashlight held near one’s chin.\n\n“Part of what I’m fascinated by with this work is that the viewer is constantly aware of their positioning and their orientation towards what they’re looking at,” says Thomas. “There’s a lot of passive viewing in photography, but in this case, the viewer becomes a photographer in a sense, using flash photography to actually make the picture.”\n\nSome of the new retroreflectives combine Civil Rights protest images with references to celebrated artists of the era. In one, portraits of Freedom Riders emerge from the squares of an Ellsworth Kelly–style color grid. Another features a photo of Malcolm X beneath a re-creation of Roy Lichtenstein’s Mirror #2 (Six Panels), a work that was itself playing with visual representation and illusion. “I’m thinking a lot about these masters of art who figured out visual language graphically but have often left content wanting to be implemented,” says Thomas. “I’ve tried in my own way to take content that I was interested in and mixing that into these.”\n\nThomas also explores more recent politically charged imagery, superimposing a TV color bar pattern on a photo of the January 6 riots at the Capitol. He notes that without context, isolated images from that day can be hard to distinguish from other historical protests. “I’ve been fascinated with this concept of what gets peo- ple out of their houses to come together for something that they believe,” he says, “carrying symbols and signs to let the world know that they want to be seen.”\n\nMost of Thomas’s new sculptures in bronze and stainless steel continue his exploration of gesture, depicting arms and hands variously clasping, grasping, reaching or, in one case, giving a peace sign. That work, titled Duality, is something of a corollary to his well- known sculpture Unity, a 22-foot bronze arm with the index finger pointing skyward that was permanently installed at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge in 2019.\n\nThe show at Shainman also includes a small-scale version of a commission Thomas created in collaboration with artist Coby Kennedy for Chicago O’Hare International Airport. The 49.5-foot-long work, Reach, features a pair of arms extending toward each other, their hands about to touch. It will be installed in the airport’s parking and car rental center. “The desire to connect with another is definitely a running theme,” Thomas says.\n\nPerhaps no body of work is more personal to the artist than his series “Falling Stars,” which was inspired by the death of his cousin Songha Willis, a close friend and mentor who was killed in a shooting in 2000. Oversize flags embroidered with thousands of stars— one for every person murdered by guns in the U.S. in a particular year—are hung from a wall, cascading onto the floor below. The three in the current show represent 2018 (14,916 deaths), 2019 (15,433) and 2021 (20,923).\n\n“We have computer chips that can connect us with everyone across the world, but we can’t stop killing each other. That’s probably a crisis of imagination, and that’s where I think art plays a role,” says Thomas. “Say what you want about the power or impact of art at a gallery, but it is part of my attempt to bear witness, to call into loving action, and also to look sternly at who we are and ask the question of what do we truly represent?”\n\nAsk Thomas for his take on the grim mood in the U.S., with polls indicating that a majority of Americans, regardless of political affiliation, believe things are heading in the wrong direction, and he doesn’t hesitate. “The polls don’t ask the important follow-up question, which is, What are you going to do about it?” he says. “Are you going to keep demonizing people who you disagree with? Are you going to just huddle and try to protect your little version of your safe community, or are you going to actually try to become an active participant in enhancing the things that you care about?”\n\nIs the Future of American High-Rise Residences Rooted in Old-World Elegance?\n\nWriter and New Yorker Stephen Wallis explores an early 20th century swing toward traditionalism, prewar detailing, and all-out romance in tomorrow’s landmarks.\n\nAug 18, 2022\n\nhttps://www.veranda.com/luxury-lifestyle/artwork/a40726048/american-high-rise-residences/\n\nThroughout the past decade and a half, New York City’s skyline-altering luxury building boom has produced no shortage of eye-catching, unmistakably contemporary landmarks. Some are twisting or gridded or stacked like Jenga blocks, others are sleek and supertall, and nearly all are clad in shimmering expanses of glass (see Hudson Yards). But there is another side to this story.\n\nAmid the futuristic never-seen-that-before, stretching-into-the-clouds pyrotechnics, some of the city’s most prestigious new apartment high-rises are being designed by architects who unabashedly look to the past. While far from dyed-in-the-wool classicists, these architects are embracing and reinterpreting traditional design language, materials, and craftsmanship in pursuit of a stronger expression of character and a distinctive sense of home in urban buildings. Though it would be an overstatement to declare a full-blown movement, there’s no doubt these types of projects have momentum in New York and are beginning to gain traction, selectively, in other American cities. “Some people explicitly want to be in the newfangled thing, but a lot of others just feel more comfortable in a more traditional setting. People value character and a sense of place,” says Peter Pennoyer, one of the leading architects who has designed historically inspired, high-end residential buildings. That list also includes Steven Harris, William Sofield, Lucien Lagrange, and, most prominently, Robert A.M. Stern.\n\nIndeed no one has been more influential or bankable in the luxury condo sphere than Stern, the former dean of Yale’s architecture school whose mantra, as he likes to say, is “Looking to the past to move forward.” Buildings by his firm, Robert A.M. Stern Architects (commonly shortened to RAMSA), have set the standard—and in real estate terms, become the model of success—for a new kind of urban classicism that draws heavily on the architectural history of his native New York, especially the apartment houses designed by J.E.R. Carpenter, Rosario Candela, and Emery Roth during the interwar period.\n\nFor a certain class of buyer, those venerable buildings, with their elegant limestone or limestone-and-brick façades informed by Italianate, Georgian, or Art Deco influences, have long been Manhattan’s ultimate prestige addresses. But while today’s buyers appreciate the generous ceiling heights and gracefully proportioned living spaces of the historic buildings’ original floor plans, they have no need for multiple servants’ rooms and expect larger baths and open, accessible kitchens where they can gather with family and casually entertain. Renovating these old apartments, even ones that have been updated over the years, can be a headache.\n\nWhat Stern and others working in a similar vein bring is a level of aesthetic sophistication and luxury on par with the best classic apartment houses, only everything is new. Not to mention, there’s no co-op board to deal with. Stern has even adapted his approach to towers 60, 70, 80 stories high, affording supertall-caliber views.\n\nThe grandest of RAMSA’s New York projects, 220 Central Park South, completed a few years ago, is one of several ultraluxury residences that anchors so-called Billionaires’ Row. Composed of an 18-story, park-facing “villa” and an adjoining 950-foot-tall tower behind, 220 features façades of silvery Alabama limestone, punctuated by a rhythmic variety of windows, Juliet balconies, and setback terraces. The architecture’s understated classicism feels comfortingly familiar, almost from an earlier era, yet also fresh, modern even. And it has resonated with buyers.\n\nInitial sales in the building approached $3 billion, including what has been reported as the most expensive home ever sold in the U.S., a 24,000-square-foot, four-floor spread acquired by hedge fund manager Ken Griffin for nearly $240 million. The address has been a magnet for high-profile figures from the worlds of entertainment and finance, as have many of Stern’s buildings since his watershed 15 Central Park West opened in 2008, establishing stylistic and material signatures RAMSA has continued to refine and expand upon.\n\n“We cut a new direction, established a return to a new set of precedents, the 1910s to 1930s residential buildings, mostly on Manhattan Island, which were among the glories of that period of architecture in the United States,” says Stern. “The intelligence of the New York apartment house as it evolved was thrown out the window to a shocking extent after the Second World War. Now we’re bringing it back, and there is a real audience for that kind of approach.”\n\nIn the postwar decades even modern high-rises billed as luxury—whether white-brick, concrete, or glass-and-steel—too often fell into cookie-cutter monotony and plainness. Apartments tended to be standard built, one stacked on top of another with little variation, linked by long internal corridors that took up space and undermined any sense of homey intimacy. Pennoyer, whose firm has designed a couple of Upper East Side buildings and is working on a third, sees a shift. “There’s a rising expectation of what an apartment should be,” he says. “I don’t think people will any longer accept the low ceiling heights, cramped dimensions, and lack of detail that we saw in the ’70s, ’80s, and even the ’90s.”\n\nPennoyer is speaking, of course, about the upper echelons of the real estate market and the kind of buyers he was catering to with his 151 East 78th Street, a 17-story limestone-and-brick building rich with neoclassical details, and the just-completed Benson, an 18-story high-rise at 1045 Madison Avenue with its Art Deco–inflected façade of limestone and elegant ironwork that evokes prewar Paris and New York in equal measure. When it comes to the interiors of Pennoyer’s buildings—as with most of Stern’s—the residences are a thoughtfully calibrated balance of classic and contemporary. “You’re trying to bring various influences together and not just say, I’m going to try to replicate a prewar apartment,” Pennoyer explains. “You’re making something that’s absolutely contemporary but has those proportions and space and openness that we all prefer now.”\n\nSome developers, no doubt aiming to give their building another selling point, opt to bring in a marquee designer to put his or her creative stamp on the interior spaces. Kelly Behun worked on the interiors of Stern’s 1228 Madison Avenue, for example, and Lauren Rottet is doing 200 East 83rd Street. At The Benson, Achille Salvagni was enlisted to amp up the lobby’s modern glamour, explains Elizabeth Graziolo, who left her position as a partner in Pennoyer’s firm in 2020 to launch her own practice, Yellow House Architects, though she continued to see The Benson through to completion.\n\nThe Haitian-born architect is in the early stages of designing her firm’s first Upper East Side residential building, while adding to her portfolio of historic renovations, including apartments in a pair of early-20th-century Financial District landmarks: The Woolworth Tower and One Wall Street. “In these iconic buildings, people feel like they are living a lifestyle of glamorous New York at its height,” says Graziolo, noting that conjuring a sense of romance and nostalgia is precisely what many new buildings aim to do.\n\nExperience with renovations at distinguished old New York addresses is one of the reasons Harris says architects like him have been tapped by developers to design apartment buildings in a similar spirit. “Also we work for a lot of the types of clients who are their potential buyers, so we have a sense of how they actually live and use spaces,” says Harris. Presently he is finishing a 20-story high-rise at 109 East 79th Street that’s clad in fluted limestone, pale Roman brick, and panels of exquisitely patterned Pietra di Torre stone that surround the double-height entrance featuring an abstract glass mural by Mig Perkins. The design was influenced, in part, by Harris’s love for the Villa Necchi Campiglio and the “kind of stripped classicism of 1930s Milan architecture,” he says, “what you’d call somewhere between neoclassical and Art Deco.”\n\nHarris emphasizes that, as with the great prewar apartment houses, the design was dictated by the floor plans. “There are quite a few different apartment configurations that interlock almost like a Chinese puzzle,” he says. That complexity is reflected in the building’s varied fenestration and massing, which achieves a kind of balanced asymmetry, a characteristic common to the work of Stern, Pennoyer, and others that adds character to the silhouette and an appealing sense of idiosyncrasy. It can be seen in Sofield’s latest New York residential development project as well, the 30-story Beckford Tower and 19-story Beckford House, a pair of complementary buildings that stand a block apart on Second Avenue, at 80th and 81st streets.\n\n“One of the things I love about old apartment buildings is how people over the years have screwed them up,” says Sofield, a self-described modernist by temperament and historicist by training. “Some rich person said, ‘Damn it, I want a bigger window,’ and they put in a bigger window—creating all these what for an architect would be considered mistakes. In both buildings, I kind of built in intentional idiosyncrasies, which I think makes them feel more authentic.”\n\nThe façades of both the house and the tower mix gray brick and limestone with buff brownstone, all hand laid in subtly asymmetrical patterns with varying color and texture, while window styles and dimensions shift with an unpredictable elegance. For Sofield, who is well-known for designing boutiques for luxury brands like Tom Ford, Gucci, and Bottega Veneta, distinctiveness and craftsmanship and channeling “emotional experiences” are paramount. He believes any revival of classically informed architecture is foremost a response to “the erosion of the character of neighborhoods,” resulting, in part, from “developers who saw an opportunity to throw something up quickly and with very little thought to craft.”\n\nUltimately the discussion around architects looking to the past has everything to do with a renewed emphasis on quality, refinement, and thoughtfulness, as well as creating a connection to history and place. “Architecture is really emotional—we want people to react emotionally to what we do,” says Lagrange, who is based in Chicago. He recounts the story of a woman who approached him at a party to tell him she makes a point each morning of walking by his building 65 East Goethe, featuring a mansard roof and other Parisian-inspired neoclassical details. “It’s amazing,” he says. “Just walking by the building makes her feel good because of the detail, the ironwork, the doors, the finishes.”\n\nLagrange’s current projects include an 18-story high-rise in Dallas called One Turtle Creek and a 34-story limestone-and-granite tower in Chicago’s Gold Coast neighborhood that will recall, he says, the preeminent Art Deco–era apartment buildings on Astor Street. Having worked on plenty of glass buildings over the years, Lagrange notes that buildings with masonry walls and punched windows can provide a greater sense of domesticity. “When you go home, you want to be sheltered, in a cocoon almost,” he says. “In a glass tower, it can be a little scary or uncomfortable at the edge and you lose privacy. To me I want a wall, to contain the room and to have artwork and lighting.”\n\nIt’s a sentiment echoed by other architects, including Harris, who says he has seen among his clients “a desire that an apartment be, if not refuge, at least an escape in some way.” Peter Lyden, president of the Institute of Classical Architecture & Art, sees a COVID-19 connection. “I think the pandemic has pushed some people into wanting to live like where their grandparents did. I know that sounds kind of funny, but they want familiar surroundings, private and really cozy rooms. It’s going back to this beautiful, gracious kind of living.”\n\nCould the pendulum of taste in the urban real estate market be swinging toward more traditionally inspired architecture, at least at the top end? It’s interesting to note the classical design elements in a number of high-profile new apartment buildings that no one is going to mistake as anything but contemporary. Take SHoP Architects’ 1,428-foot, dramatically tapering 111 West 57th Street—heralded as the world’s skinniest skyscraper—which rises out of historic Steinway Hall with two of its four sides clad in alternating bands of undulating cream-colored terra-cotta tiles and graceful bronze scrollwork, nodding to an earlier era of New York architecture.\n\nSome 20 blocks away, in the NoMad neighborhood, CetraRuddy’s 45-story Rose Hill tower has a glass façade ornamented with chevron-patterned metal ribbons and a shaped crown that echoes Art Deco landmarks like Rockefeller Center. In the Financial District David Adjaye’s 66-story 130 William adopts as its primary motif one of classical architecture’s most fundamental forms, featuring arched windows in gridded rows across its walls of dark textured concrete. And in Boston, Höweler + Yoon designed the 20-story 212 Stuart Street with a façade of glass and fluted precast panels of varying sizes arranged in a rhythmic pattern of variation and repetition.\n\nNone of this is rote classicism, of course, though there are connecting threads in the references and design language. It’s really about the aspiration to create something of quality that is distinctive—not entirely new but worthy of standing alongside the historic precedents that serve as inspiration.\n\nOpening the Doors of Design\n\nA tiny proportion of designers are Black, but a host of new initiatives, as well as evolving tastes, are working to right the imbalance.\n\nBy Stephen Wallis\n\nSept. 29, 2020\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/opening-the-doors-of-design.html\n\nTwo decades ago, when the designer Stephen Burks was beginning what would become a renowned international career, there were virtually no African-American role models for him to look to.\n\nAfter breaking out with a furniture collection for Cappellini in 2000, he has gone on to design for Roche Bobois, Dedon, Missoni and Moroso, among numerous other top companies.\n\nRecently, when it was noted that he was the first Black designer to work with most of the design houses that hired him, he interrupted. Framing it that way, he said, actually “softens the blow a bit.” For many of these companies, he pointed out, “I was the only Black designer.”\n\nWhile he is no longer alone in the business, there remains a dearth of Black designers — a fact that has taken on new urgency in the wake of the death of George Floyd and the protests that have followed.\n\nExpressions of solidarity with Black Lives Matter across the design industries have poured out on social media. Black-owned design companies and studios are being singled out for support, and larger design firms are pledging to improve diversity and equity.\n\n“I do think the moment is significant because it has woken up a group of people that have been sleeping for a long time,” said Malene Barnett, a Brooklyn-based artist and textile designer who founded the Black Artists + Designers Guild in 2018. “Ultimately to change, the system has to be demolished and started from scratch. It’s time for everyone to figure out how to create a new foundation so we can build a society that supports people and is truly inclusive.”\n\nFor many Black designers, it is a complicated moment. While eager to seize the momentum, some see little reason to trust that talk of greater inclusiveness will translate into results, or that even well-intentioned incremental steps toward diversity will produce substantive change.\n\nIt doesn’t take a great deal of research to recognize that Black designers are poorly represented in the world of high-end furnishings, a business with estimated global sales of roughly $25 billion last year. Just visit marquee industry trade shows, or flip through leading design magazines (some of which this white reporter has worked for both as a writer and an editor). You can also go online and look at the rosters of designers promoted on the sites of major international furnishings brands.\n\nThat is exactly what Jomo Tariku, a Virginia–based Ethiopian-reared designer, did to compile a report that found that less than one percent of all furnishings produced by top international brands are by Black designers. (He first presented his findings at a seminar on Black design hosted by Princeton University last winter. They were later reported by the interiors publication Business of Home and the design website Dezeen.)\n\nIn addition to running his studio, Jomo Furniture, Mr. Tariku works as a graphic designer and data scientist for the World Bank. He initially undertook his research to put some numbers — which he concedes are scientifically imprecise — to his own experience of feeling like the only Black person at many industry events.\n\n“I’d go to trade shows, but people don’t take you seriously as a Black designer because they don’t know — they’ve never met one,” said Mr. Tariku, whose work marries traditional African forms with digital modeling and a crisp, minimalist aesthetic. “When I’d ask for the name or the contact info of a company’s creative director, what I’d get is a blank stare or, ‘He’s not available.’ I don’t know if white designers face the same thing.”\n\nAs Mr. Tariku found, if you scan the designer pages of top furnishings companies you might see two or three Black faces out of dozens — or none at all. Herman Miller, a leading American brand based in Michigan, for example, shows just a single Black designer: Bibi Seck, a New York–based Senegalese designer who heads the firm Birsel + Seck with his wife, the Turkish-born designer Ayse Birsel.\n\nMary Stevens, the senior vice president of global product development and advanced innovation at Herman Miller, said the company is aiming to do better. Prompted by recent events, it is founding a Diversity in Design program, for which it hopes to build a consortium of businesses — including competitors — to tackle the issue.\n\n“We’re looking at increased retention initiatives, equitable career development, all the things that you would expect,” Ms. Stevens said. “But this is also focused on the funnel into the design field, and that means involvement in education systems, in the communities in which we serve. There’s no question that the Black Lives Matter movement has moved us to be much more proactive than we had been in the past.”\n\nJerry Helling, the president and creative director of Bernhardt Design, in North Carolina, who has championed many emerging designers, also believes the problem is in the pipeline. “The lack of awareness among young people about being able to pursue a career in design is a challenge that must be addressed,” he said. “I believe supporting design education — and especially, mentoring — is crucial for companies who are committed to supporting diversity and enhancing the design industry.”\n\nSome top design institutions are ramping up efforts to redress the imbalance.\n\nIn June, the executive board of the Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands issued a statement acknowledging the school’s “lack of diversity that does not accurately reflect the society it exists within, let alone the planet more broadly,” pledging to “do more, and do it now.”\n\nNot long after, Rosanne Somerson, the president of Rhode Island School of Design, released a letter to the RISD community, taking responsibility for allowing a culture of systemic racism to persist and outlining steps to advance social equity and inclusion. Among the changes are revisions to the Eurocentric curriculum; a cluster-hire of 10 new faculty members committed to “issues of decoloniality, race, racism, and ethnicity”; and admitting more students of color. According to the school’s enrollment figures, the percentage of Black or African-American students rose slightly from 1.9 percent in 2012 to to 3.8 percent last year.\n\n“RISD is not a terribly diverse place, and people are realizing their complicity in these inequities,” said Christopher Specce, head of the school’s furniture department. “Student activism has been really a primary force in confronting inequities and racism. Everyone is approaching this with a sense of urgency.”\n\nOf course, the underlying systemic issues that perpetuate the design world’s diversity problems start well before college. As for the question, Why aren’t there more Black designers? Mr. Burks, for one, has little patience. “I mean, come on. Design is a luxury to begin with for most people. A majority of African-Americans in this country are living at the poverty line,” he said. “It’s about education. It’s about opportunity. It’s about choices. You’re looking at a population in this country who 60 years ago were fighting for basic civil rights. We have to fix this country first.”\n\nFor his part, Mr. Burks collaborates with artisans in developing communities around the globe, in some cases partnering with nonprofits like Aid to Artisans and the Clinton Global Initiative. He recently conducted workshops in craftmaking at Berea College in Kentucky, which is tuition-free and was founded in 1855 as the first interracial college in the South. Mr. Burks noted that the vision behind his work, which emphasizes craft and often incorporates recycled or repurposed materials, has never been solely about being a Black designer. His goal is to cast off Eurocentric biases and embrace the idea that “anyone and everyone is capable of design,” he said. “I don’t want to just make the design world open to people that look like me but to everyone.”\n\nHe is also launching a program called Designing Diversity, whereby companies he works with would donate the proceeds from sales of his designs to a nonprofit of his choice, benefiting racial equity. “I haven’t had any takers yet,” he said. “Companies don’t necessarily want to give up their profits to try to fix the problem.”\n\nThat skepticism is shared by Ini Archibong, an American designer of Nigerian descent who lives in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. “I’m not going to pretend I’m necessarily hopeful that the structures in place will all of a sudden change their objectives to be about righteousness over the dollar,” said Mr. Archibong, who is known for exquisitely crafted furnishings that combine luxurious materials with a surreal, even mystical sensibility. “This moment does make me hopeful about the level of consciousness and awareness of humanity.”\n\nOver the past decade, Mr. Archibong has worked with Knoll, Bernhardt Design, Lapicida, Sé, Hermès and the New York gallery Friedman Benda. Like other successful Black designers, he has often been the only person of color in the room. “You end up thinking about yourself not only as who you actually are but also as how a white person is perceiving you,” he said.\n\nOnce, when he was a student at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena, Mr. Archibong presented a table inspired by the lowrider cars he grew up around. “The instructors were like, ‘I don’t get it. And I think that it’s over the top and garish,’” he recalled. “But I show that table to anybody who’s Black and they get it.”\n\nThese days, Mr. Archibong is busy with his most ambitious project to date, the Pavilion of the Diaspora, to be unveiled at next summer’s London Design Biennale. The design concept is based on the conch shell, referencing an organic horn for symbolically summoning Africans who have left the continent and — more generally — people who have been displaced from homelands everywhere. The pavilion will be a space for contemplation, with visual, auditory and haptic components, and it will also host community events and performances. The aim is to give voice to the diaspora, in all its rich diversity, on an international stage.\n\nAlso contributing to the biennale is Chrissa Amuah, a British-Ghanaian textiles designer who is partnering with Alice Asafu-Adjaye, an architect based in Accra, Ghana, on an installation that will address Ghana’s long colonial relationship with Britain and Denmark. Ms. Amuah, whose London studio is called AMWA Designs, incorporates traditional Ghanaian symbols known as adinkra into her textiles, including a collection she created for Bernhardt Design that will debut next year.\n\nMs. Amuah is equally well known as the founder of Africa By Design, a three-year-old online platform and series of roving exhibitions that showcases the work of sub-Saharan designers, both on the continent and living abroad. With a roster of nearly 40 designers from several countries, Africa By Design was born out of a recognition that there are “so many African designers whose work is incredible but they just don’t have a platform to show and promote it,” said Ms. Amuah. “They know their craft, but they wouldn’t know how to necessarily communicate with a Western market.\n\nFor Ms. Amuah, shining a spotlight on design talent across Africa can also help debunk stereotypes. “When we took Africa by Design to Dubai,” she recalled, “I remember one Emirati man walked in and said, ‘Oh, this is a great exhibition. But you know what’s missing? A lion skin.’ His instinctive perception of Africa and design was, you know, an animal skin.”\n\nPatrizia Moroso, the creative director of the Italian furnishings house Moroso, noted that global interest in African art has taken off and believes design will follow. “When creativity starts blowing, art is the flag that you see before other things,” said Ms. Moroso, who is married to a Senegalese artist, Abdou Salam Gaye. “Design was not so important in another Africa focused on other issues. But now it is starting to be important, because there is a new consciousness around creative potential and quality of life in Africa.”\n\nMs. Moroso, who said that she has always sought out designers with different backgrounds and nationalities, lamented that “it’s not easy to find a lot of designers coming from Africa.” But she conceded that, as an industry, “we probably have to do more, to develop better ways of scouting new talent.”\n\nA decade ago, Moroso launched its M’Afrique collection of exuberant outdoor furniture. The concept was to have company designers — most of them white — travel to Senegal to collaborate with local craftsmen on pieces that would “underline the beauty and soul and energy of Africa,” as Ms. Moroso put it. “We saw the possibility to create a meeting point for our designers and these fantastic craftsmen who were able to do things that we are no longer able to do in Europe, like making these beautiful woven objects.”\n\nA few of the subsequent M’Afrique designers have been Black, including Mr. Seck and Mr. Burks, who oversaw the collection’s first exhibition in Milan. And this spring Moroso is unveiling new additions by the Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye.\n\nAll of the designers interviewed agreed that while solutions are challenging, a reckoning over the design industry’s diversity problem was overdue. “I’m glad people are talking about it,” Mr. Tariku said. When he posted his research on diversity online, some commenters argued that design should be only about design and not skin color, to which Mr. Tariku said, “Look, I wish it was.”\n\nThis article is part of our latest Design special report, which is about taking creative leaps in challenging times.\n\nPride & Purpose\n\nAn extraordinary new safari goes deep into Namibia to track the rare Namib Desert lion—and to work with local communities to help save it.\n\nBy Stephen Wallis\n\nSummer 2020\n\nDr. Philip Stander—Flip, as his friends call him—emerged from his truck barefoot and dusty. His khaki baseball cap, T-shirt, and shorts were stained, and he looked like he hadn’t bathed in some time. And, well, he probably hadn’t.\n\nThe expert on Namibia’s rare desert-adapted lions had been out searching for a particular lioness—officially Xpl-45, nicknamed Lovechild—for nearly two weeks. “I’ve been doing 12- to 18-hour days, covering more than 850 miles,” he said by way of introduction, extending a hand and forearm scribbled with numbers. “I’m not even sure what they mean anymore,” he offered with a shrug.\n\nStander has spent more than three decades tracking, studying, and working to protect the world’s only population of desert-dwelling lions—currently around 130—which make their home in the northern Namib Desert. His groundbreaking research, the subject of two documentary films titled Vanishing Kings and a book of the same name, has brought international attention to these lions, which in the early ’90s were presumed to be extinct, having been killed by trophy hunters or farmers protecting their livestock. But after evidence of lion activity was discovered in the area, Stander launched the Desert Lion Conservation Project, in 1998. Since then he has been tracking prides across the Namib, including along the desolate Skeleton Coast. After disappearing from its beaches 30 years ago, the lions have returned and adapted by feeding on cormorants and seals.\n\nThe oldest desert on earth, the Namib is an unforgiving yet spectacularly beautiful land of rock and sand, punctuated by tabletop mountains and vast undulating dunes. It’s little wonder the region has become popular with safari-goers looking for off-the-beaten-path experiences. While the Namib doesn’t support the abundant wildlife found in many other parts of southern Africa, it is home to an array of desert-adapted game, including cheetahs, elephants, giraffes, and the largest population of free-ranging—and critically endangered—black rhinos anywhere. Lions survive here by hunting antelope such as oryx and springbok, as well as ostriches, zebras, giraffes, and, along the coast, Cape fur seals. With little water available, the lions rarely drink, relying on the blood of their prey for hydration. They also kill domestic livestock, leading to conflicts with humans—the greatest threat to their existence.\n\nWhat’s perhaps most exceptional about the Namib lions is their massive territories, which can span 10,000 square miles, compared with less than 100 square miles for savannah lions. They can easily cover 30 miles in a single night, often over extremely rough terrain. That creates serious challenges for Stander, who patrols the landscape in his customized Toyota Land Cruiser, a roving research center that wouldn’t be out of place in a Mad Max movie. The equipment inside includes tranquilizers and medicines, a large speaker used for attracting or warding off lions, and computers for processing data from the GPS tracking collars fitted to more than a quarter of the region’s lions. Newer satellite-connected collars make it easier to remotely monitor the animals’ movements, but many, including Lovechild, still wear older collars, which require a close range of a few miles to be tracked.\n\n“It’s crazy how much effort goes into finding them,” conceded Stander, who is often on the move, virtually nonstop, for weeks at a time. When he is, his laundry isn’t the only thing that’s neglected. He sleeps sporadically, and he was vague about how often he eats. “I rely a lot on the kindness of others,” he said, adding, “Everything is driven by how the lions behave. It’s why I work the way I do.”\n\nI had come to the Namib to shadow Stander in his research on a trip organized by Wilderness Safaris as part of the outfitter’s Travel with Purpose program of small-group itineraries, which emphasize conservation and community engagement. Our base was Wilderness Safaris’ Damaraland Camp, a collection of ten bungalows on a rocky slope overlooking the Huab River Valley, with rooms that were luxurious by desert standards (lack of five-star shower pressure notwithstanding), excellent food, and attentive service. But the greatest privilege was the chance to see Stander at work. For more than two decades, Wilderness has provided him with financial support and lodging, but this was the first time it had collaborated with him on a trip—“an experiment,” as Stander called it—that gave guests the chance to witness his efforts firsthand.\n\nThe opportunities Wilderness’s Travel with Purpose program offer don’t just satisfy a growing demand for deeper and more exclusive safari experiences—they support a greater mission to build community-based conservation. “Tourism gives value to wildlife,” Stander told our group of four over dinner the first evening. “It provides income and job opportunities and a whole range of other benefits to the communities. Without tourism, we would not be able to justify protecting lions in this area.”\n\nStill, the dynamic between humans and lions remains complex—even more so amid Namibia’s worst drought in a century, already well into its second year when I visited. Cattle had been dying in large numbers, while the surviving animals were weakened and vulnerable, and with diminishing prey in the wild, lions were increasingly turning to alternative food sources, livestock chief among them.\n\nPreventing human-lion conflict has become a priority for Stander, who has worked closely with the Namibian government and local conservancies to create mitigation strategies now being implemented. These include cladding livestock enclosures known as kraals with tarps or dark netting (when lions can’t see inside, they’re unlikely to attack) and installing warning-system towers in conflict hot spots. These structures—13-foot-high antennas with solar panels, batteries, speakers, and LED floodlights—detect when collared lions are nearby, triggering bright lights and alarms designed to deter the predators and alert residents.\n\nOne morning we joined Stander on a trip to the tiny village of Driefontein, where the first of these towers was erected. “In the past year, we’ve lost half of our 50 cows,” a woman who came to greet us told me, though it was unclear how many had died at the hands of lions. Another local recounted how lions had breached a kraal, killing the dogs guarding it and the goats inside. The story was the same in nearby De Riet, where a young man told me that “some weeks, we are losing five or more goats”—not only to lions but also to jackals and hyenas.\n\nSometimes the only answer is to relocate problem lions. Weeks before our visit, Stander had tranquilized three males who had made multiple attacks in Driefontein and moved them to a conservation area farther inland to avoid conflicts. That contrasts with the sad fate of five male lions, nicknamed the Five Musketeers, who were a focus of Stander’s research for years and were the stars of the Vanishing Kings movies he made with wildlife filmmakers Lianne and Will Steenkamp. Between July 2016 and April 2017, all five were either poisoned or shot, highlighting for the world the dangers faced by the Namib lions. Indeed, Stander’s work is relentless—and it doesn’t always end favorably. “But we have to do this,” he offered resolutely. “These lions belong to the world.”\n\nWhile we had come to see the lions Stander so fiercely defends, we soon began to realize this would be no simple safari. Given the animals’ constant roving, anticipating and pinpointing their location can be difficult, and even with the benefit of tracking systems, there was no guarantee we’d find them. As we discovered, when you come to the Namib to see lions, you have to be flexible, patient, persistent.\n\nOn our first couple of days at Damaraland, Stander’s satellite reports indicated the nearest lions were hundreds of miles away, so we set out for the dry riverbeds of the Huab in search of other game. In these channels, for most of the year water can be found only beneath the surface, but it’s enough to support a variety of flora, notably the ana trees whose leaves and seedpods are a primary source of nourishment for elephants, giraffes, and kudu. You can’t have a more exhilarating up-close elephant encounter than the one we experienced there, when two of the giant animals approached our vehicle, not 15 minutes apart, each stopping a heart-racing few inches from our open Land Cruiser. The next day, we came upon another rarity: a pair of black rhinos, a mother and her five-year-old calf, feeding on clusters of Damara milkbush—one of the few splashes of green in this arid moonscape, its breadstick-like branches toxic to just about every other species.\n\nBy the fourth day, all of us were itching to find lions. Stander proposed a journey: We’d travel the six hours to the Doros Crater, where he hoped to find the Huab pride, a family of nine, only two of which had been collared. Stander was eager to fit collars to at least two of the group’s subadult males. “They will soon start wandering around on their own and may even disperse by mid-2020,” he explained. “This inevitably brings them into conflict with villages and livestock, and we need to monitor their movements.”\n\nThe collaring process typically begins with Stander enticing the lions into a clearing—usually by setting out prey, often a springbok or other game that he shoots nearby—in order to tranquilize the animal with a dart. Otherwise, he has to improvise to try to get a clear shot. Since the darting must be done in the evening, when the lions are active, it means working in darkness. Even though Stander, who has tranquilized hundreds of animals, has the process down cold, a lot still has to go right.\n\nAfter an early breakfast, we headed out, trailing Stander, who left well before sunrise to get a head start on locating the pride. For hours we bounced over rugged tracks, traveling through a landscape awe-inspiring in its diversity, from vast fields of coppery stones and the all-black Burnt Mountain to expanses of loose white quartz that resemble, improbably, a dusting of snow on the desert floor. We stopped to look at rock carvings etched millennia ago and bundles of Welwitschia, a low-lying plant whose leaves can live for as long as 1,500 years.\n\nIt was midafternoon by the time we caught up with Stander, who had news. He had found the lions, but he hadn’t spotted any game that could be killed to lure them into the open. Nonetheless, with the sun beginning to dip, Stander led us into the Goantagab riverbed, a twisting gorge with sheer rock walls, until we came to a clearing where we found the Huab pride lounging beneath a mopani tree. Keenly aware of our presence, but decidedly unconcerned with it, they yawned and flicked their tails. It wasn’t the dramatic collaring mission we had anticipated, but it was a magnificent moment—and one that put the importance of Stander’s work into perspective.\n\n“You’re lucky if you see two, three, maybe four lions together,” Stander told us once the sun had gone down, noting that he’d be returning for another attempt at collaring in the coming days. He will eventually relinquish much of this day-to-day fifeldwork—it’s too much for a single person, even Stander—and hand over the work of the Desert Lion Conservation Project to the locals he has been training. It won’t be easy for him to let go, something made all the more evident as we said our goodbyes. While we were off to a late dinner at Damaraland Camp, Stander was preparing to catch a few hours of sleep before heading back out into the desert again. A human-lion conflict had flared up—and he still needed to find the elusive Lovechild.\n\nWilderness Safaris’ Travel with Purpose trips (wilderness-safaris.com) to Namibia can be booked through Next Adventure (from $6,000 per person; nextadventure.com).\n\nThe Other Giacometti\n\nAs a sibling, an assistant, a model, and a confidant, Diego Giacometti is inextricably bound to his older brother, sculptor Alberto Giacometti. Now that Diego’s furnishings have achieved acclaim in their own right—and commanded eye-opening prices at auction—it’s time to examine how each helped shape the other.\n\nBY STEPHEN WALLIS\n\nEsquire Big Black Book Fall/Winter 2018\n\nAlberto Giacometti’s expressive, hauntingly gaunt figures are among the most iconic works of the past century. They’re also the most expensive sculptures on the planet; his Pointing Man sold for a record $141 million, in 2015, to the hedge-fund billionaire Steven Cohen. But in recent years, Alberto’s younger brother Diego has proved no slouch himself when it comes to fetching the kinds of prices that turn heads at blue-chip auction houses.\n\nTogether, the Swiss-born Giacomettis are the most celebrated brothers in all of 20th-century art. And yet Diego spent most of his adult life in Alberto’s shadow, serving his brother’s idiosyncratic genius as a loyal assistant in a cramped, disheveled, barely heated Paris atelier. It wasn’t until after Alberto’s death, in January 1966, that Diego, then 63, fully dedicated himself to his own work. A craftsman at heart, he found his métier in furnishings and decorative objects, developing an original artistic language that echoed ancient Etruscan and Greek styles while incorporating sculptural elements drawn from nature. In what became his signature style, he embellished the arms of chairs, the legs and stretcher bars of tables, the frameworks of ceiling lanterns, and the finials of bookshelves with a captivating array of tree and leaf forms, as well as creatures including birds, stags, horses, dogs, cats, and frogs. The slender forms and hand-modeled surfaces of his exquisitely crafted pieces—usually in bronze—evinced unmistakable similarities to his brother’s brooding, attenuated sculptures, but the spirit was always lighter, even whimsical.\n\nOver the last 20 years of Diego’s life, his admirers included a coterie of Parisian tastemakers and cultural luminaries. Influential decorator Henri Samuel ordered pieces for clients such as Jean Seberg and Romain Gary. Film producer Raoul Lévy (And God Created Woman), art dealers and collectors Marguerite and Aimé Maeght, and couturier Hubert de Givenchy became devoted patrons. “If you were a wealthy person in Paris in the ’70s and ’80s, you needed to have a Diego Giacometti table in your house,” says Cécile Verdier, the former Paris-based cohead of design at Sotheby’s. “You had to—there was no question.”\n\nThat legacy continues to resonate with contemporary interior-design eminences like Jacques Grange and Juan Pablo Molyneux, who have used Diego’s pieces in their projects, while fashion designer Marc Jacobs installed a pair of Diego stools in his Manhattan townhouse. “His work can live with any category of other furniture—in a very classic or modern interior,” says Pauline De Smedt, head of design at Christie’s in Paris. “Plus, its poetry moves people. I don’t know how to say it in English—it’s like it is coming from your dreams.”\n\n“He created something that nobody else had done, his own vocabulary, his own universe,” says Verdier, whose department last year sold a monumental Diego bookcase with bronze birds and trees, made for book publisher Marc Barbezat, for a record $6.3 million. “These sculptural elements add poetry and lightness, which for me is a key to his art.”\n\nThe bookcase sale is one in a string of escalating records at successful Diego Giacometti auctions, most notably the sensational $34.5 million sale of 30 works by Diego (and one by Alberto) from Givenchy’s Loire Valley château, staged by Chris- tie’s, in March 2017. Most pieces had been commissioned by Givenchy over a 20-year period, and thanks to avid interest from buyers across the globe, all 21 lots sold above expectations. Best in show was an octagonal table that went for $4.4 million, five times the high estimate. It featured an oak top and a sensuously hand-molded bronze base with slender, stylized figures—typifying the masculine elegance that is Diego’s hallmark.\n\nOf course, even needle-moving prices like those at the Givenchy sale are well below the sums commanded by Alberto’s sculptures, which hold the top three spots for the most expensive sculptures ever sold at auction—all above $100 million. A more instructive comparison is to look at prices for Alberto’s decorative works. The current record, achieved earlier this year at Sotheby’s, is $9.9 million, for a 1952 bronze chandelier that Alberto designed with small sculptural elements, including one of his famous walking men. “In the same category, the market basically recognizes them in the same region of importance,” says De Smedt.\n\nThe lives and careers of the brothers were deeply intertwined from the time of their births, just a year apart in 1901 and 1902. They were raised in a small village in the Swiss Alps, where their father, Giovanni, a well-known painter, kept his studio door open to his children, according to Catherine Grenier, director of the Giacometti Foundation and author of a recently published biography of Alberto. “It was mostly Alberto who was making drawings, paintings, sculptures in the studio with his father,” she says, explaining that in those days Diego and his younger brother, Bruno, who later became an architect, “were not so interested.”\n\nAlberto moved to Paris in 1922 at the encouragement of his parents to pursue a career as an artist. Driven and immensely talented, he quickly found himself at the center of the city’s art world. His first biographer, James Lord, claimed that no one doubted the significance of Alberto’s talent. Except, at times, Alberto. Confident and charismatic, he was also prone to bouts of melancholy and self-doubt.\n\nWhile Alberto was an intellectual, Diego was an earthier type who took delight in the rhythms of the natural world. After a scattered start to his career, he moved in with his brother for a time in Paris, helping out in the studio. He took on that role formally in 1929 when Alberto asked him to be his assistant.\n\nThe brothers’ relationship was one of mutual support and dependence that lasted nearly four decades, with the pair spending countless hours working side by side in Alberto’s impossibly cluttered 250-square-foot studio at 46 rue Hippolyte-Maindron, in Montparnasse. Among the most mythic artist studios of that era, the space has been meticulously re-created at the recently opened Giacometti Institute in Paris—complete with wall scribbles; paint-splattered tables littered with plaster models, brushes, and sculpting tools; and even Alberto’s makeshift bed in the corner. Simone de Beauvoir, a close friend of Alberto’s who also modeled for him, described the studio as “submerged in plaster.”\n\nDiego, whose role expanded over the years, assisted Alberto with bases, supports, and molds for his sculptures; oversaw patinas for his bronzes; and coordinated with foundries, framers, and galleries. Most famously, he frequently sat as a model for his brother’s paintings and sculptures, such as the 1954 Grande Tête de Diego—an ax-like bronze portrait, accentuating Diego’s expansive forehead and sturdy jawline—which brought in $50 million at Sotheby’s five years ago.\n\nBoth men were passionately committed to the work and put in long hours, often eating little. But man, did they smoke a lot. Alberto reached 80 cigarettes a day, according to a letter written by his wife, Annette. (Diego never married but had a companion named Nelly, whom he lived with for 15 years.) Dealers and friends— including legendary names like Breton, Balthus, Picasso, Sartre, and Beckett—would drop by for visits. This was Paris’s heyday as the world’s art capital, with Montparnasse as the city’s avant-garde heart. Treated for stomach cancer in 1963, Alberto suffered from poor health in the final years of his life. He also grappled with increasing anxiety, perhaps fueled by the pressure of his success, and he had trouble finishing works. Along with Annette, Diego kept him on track and saved him from destroying works he deemed failures. According to Grenier, “Diego would tell him, ‘The work is perfect. Now you must stop.’ ” In the early ’60s, having begun to take on some of his own commissions, Diego moved into a studio around the corner from Alberto’s. Among his most important early clients were the Maeghts, the art dealers and collectors who enlisted Diego to create stair railings, lamps, tables, chandeliers, and more for multiple residences as well as for the Maeght Foundation in the south of France. Alberto’s death hit Diego hard, but it was also a creative awakening. He soon built up a steady stream of commissions that grew into a backlog. He often worked alone—though he did share his studio with a beloved cat—and some clients waited years for pieces from the charming perfectionist, whose precise casts and patinas were nothing short of an obsession. “He was a pretty romantic person,” says Verdier. “It’s not like he was a company, making 25 tables a day. He worked when he had inspiration.”\n\nEach piece Diego made was basically a one-off. While he would recycle elements of existing tables and chairs, he was constantly reworking his models to add a new gure. “Each time, it was a unique piece, and that’s what everybody wants now,” says Bruno Jaubert, a specialist at the French auction house Artcu- rial. “Plus, now we see the creations of Diego in another way—not only as furniture but as sculpture. And it has changed the market for his work.”\n\nDiego’s highest-profile commission was also the one that’s easiest to see in person today: a 50-piece group of seating, tables, and lighting for Paris’s Musée Picasso, which opened in the Hôtel Salé in 1985, just a few months after Diego’s death from a heart attack while he was recovering from cataract surgery. The museum commission helped boost his reputation (and prices), but almost immediately questions arose about fakes and unauthorized casts. Though he often signed his work “Diego,” or stamped it with his initials—to him, Giacometti would always be his brother’s name—he kept very few records and did not number his pieces. Investigations by French and U.S. authorities in the late ’80s and early ’90s revealed the existence of numerous fakes, including quite a few sold by major auction houses. “There is no record whatsoever of what he made, and there still isn’t any recognized authority, any committee, for Diego’s work, so it’s a totally blurred area,” says De Smedt. “The provenance is absolutely key.”\n\nDespite the concerns over fakes, demand for Diego’s pieces is soaring—and increasingly global, thanks to growing interest from Asian buyers, according to Verdier, who notes that there was a surge of interest in Diego’s work following a major exhibition dedicated to Alberto in Shanghai in 2016. Indeed, many inexperienced buyers, unfamiliar with Diego, make the mistake of conflating the two brothers. “It was quite interesting to see, at the viewing for the Givenchy sale, a lot of people were quite unclear about the link between Diego and Alberto,” says De Smedt. “Were they father and son? Who made what?”\n\nThe latest opportunity to compare their work side by side comes in November, when De Smedt and the team at Christie’s will stage a special sale in New York of pieces by Alberto and Diego. Keeping in mind their considerable difference, De Smedt notes the undeniable links between the two. “It’s obvious in the touch, in the way that everything is so thin and elegant and the way that the material is worked,” she says. “You can almost feel their fingers going through the piece.”\n\nA Classic Returns\n\nWilderness Safaris comes back to one of Zimbabwe’s most stunning sties with the reopening of Chikwenya.\n\nBy Stephen Wallis\n\nJuly/August 2019\n\nhttps://www.departures.com/travel/wilderness-safaris-zimbabwe-chikwenya\n\nOur arrival at Chikwenya couldn’t have been more perfectly choreographed. The camp, located in a secluded area of Zimbabwe’s Mana Pools National Park, nestles into a densely forested embankment overlooking the majestic Zambezi River. As our Land Rover pulled up to the clearing at the center of camp, the sinking sun was casting a spectacular salmon glow across the vast floodplain, while the mountains of the Rift Valley escarpment formed shadowy silhouettes in the distance. A herd of water buffalo grazed along the riverbank below, and the absolute serenity was broken only by the intermittent bassoon-like groans of hippos submerged near the shore. It was a moment, as one of our guides, Luke Terblanche, later said to me, “when there are just no words to express the peace, the beauty, the magnificence.” This place, he added, “exposes you to the soul of Africa.”\n\nI was among the fortunate first visitors to the new Chikwenya, which briefly reopened after a two-year total rebuild last fall before closing during the November-to-March rainy season, when the soft ground makes the area difficult to navigate. The camp is a collaboration between local Zimbabwean owners and Wilderness Safaris, which operates more than 40 camps across southern and eastern Africa. It’s part of a significant investment Wilderness is making in Zimbabwe as the country begins to emerge from years of corruption, violence, and economic devastation under Robert Mugabe, the liberation hero turned dictator whose close-to-four-decade rule came to an end in 2017. His ZANUPF party remains in power under president Emmerson Mnangagwa and the economic situation is still tenuous—as evidenced by ongoing fuel and food shortages, currency instability, and sky-high unemployment—but there is real hope, something long missing, that Zimbabwe can finally turn a corner.\n\nAnd that is good news for the tourism industry, which suffered badly in the final years of Mugabe’s regime. “Those were really dark, tough times,” said Wilderness Safaris CEO Keith Vincent, a native Zimbabwean. He explained that the company was forced to scale back its operations in the country as bookings, particularly from Americans, dried up. In 2006, Wilderness pulled out of Chikwenya, where it had operated a camp since 1998. The 6,200-acre private concession was taken over by Capmount Lodges, an operator that focused mostly on river and fishing expeditions for a predominantly regional clientele. “As a company, we had a choice,” said Vincent. “We could pack up our bags and leave Zimbabwe completely or we could try to keep a few people employed, look after these areas with spectacular wildlife, and hope to live long enough to see us come out of that era.”\n\nA few years ago, as signs of positive change were afoot, including the opening of a new airport in Victoria Falls, on the northwestern border, Capmount and its investors began a dramatic overhaul of Chikwenya. In addition to converting to solar power and installing a water purification system, they updated the design and built an airstrip less than ten minutes away. They also asked Wilderness Safaris to come back to run the camp.\n\nFor Wilderness that meant returning a jewel to its stable of Zimbabwean properties—three in Mana Pools and three in Hwange National Park—all new or recently refurbished. “Reopening Chikwenya secures the long-term future of one of Zimbabwe’s premier wildlife areas,” said Vincent.\n\nEarly one morning, as our gregarious and endlessly knowledgeable driver Foster Siyawareva—one of Zimbabwe’s first certified black African guides—was telling us about the sausage tree and its distinctive elongated fruit, I was the only one to notice a couple of female lions relaxing in a clearing perhaps a hundred yards away. (It was a proud moment, spotting those lionesses before our eagle-eyed guides.) Soon, several lumbering elephants emerged from the trees, accompanied by a few skittish baboons. Next, a group of impalas cautiously approached, while the lionesses—one pregnant and both apparently satiated—barely took notice.\n\nAs we made our way through the forest, past centuries-old termite mounds rising several feet, there was wildlife at every turn. In addition to elephants and impalas, we encountered groups of water buffalo and eland—the shy, ox-like antelope with faint white stripes and thick, twisting horns—as well as gracefully antlered waterbuck, whose shaggy manes provide buoyancy when swimming. We spotted plenty of smaller creatures too, such as vervet monkeys, mongooses, and an array of birds, including iridescent-blue long-tailed starlings and brilliantly colored little bee-eaters. Down along the river we saw one of the crocodiles that make the Zambezi treacherous, and we watched a massive hippo graze briefly before disappearing into the water until dusk.\n\nWhat we didn’t come across at Chikwenya was other people. Unlike in some places, we never found ourselves sharing our once-in-a-lifetime animal encounters with a dozen jeeps. It was just me, another couple (an American actress and her filmmaker husband) and our guides. And boats are rarely seen on this stretch of the Zambezi. The most visible sign we saw of other people was the distant smoke of fires across the river in Zambia. When I asked my guide, Tendai Mdluli—who has worked at multiple camps and is now part of Wilderness’s corporate team—what makes Chikwenya special, he didn’t hesitate. “The location,” he said. “And the remoteness—we’re way out in the middle of nowhere.”\n\nChikwenya is a great place for touring on foot, as I did with Mdluli. On the ground, your relationship to the surroundings shifts—perspective, scale, awareness, vulnerability (even with a rifle-toting guide). It was humbling and thrilling to watch a couple of elephants, less than a hundred feet away, bathing themselves with mud, first splashing their chests and under their ears, then slinging the muck over their backs. This area is known for some of the best up-close wild elephant sightings in the world.\n\nThe only one of the Big Five safari animals absent from Chikwenya is the rhino, which roamed the Zambezi Valley until the 1980s, when poaching nearly wiped them out. With fellow operator andBeyond, Wilderness is participating in an ongoing project to replenish both white and black rhinos in Botswana. I asked Arnold Tshipa, environmental officer, about the possibility of bringing rhinos back to Mana Pools and Hwange. “Not anytime soon,” he replied, without hesitation. “You have to guard them 24-7, and it’s very expensive.”\n\nThat harsh reality is a reminder of how fragile the search for human-wildlife balance is. And it’s a big reason why Chikwenya’s owners wanted a camp that sits lighter on this land that animals pass through daily as they move between forest and river. (On the night of my arrival, the armed guard who accompanied me to my tent casually mentioned that a lion pride was “hanging out” under my terrace.)\n\nThe seven cabin-like tents (two are multi-tent family units) stand on low wooden decks and are accessed by elevated timber walkways. The interiors, by South African designer Tanja Beyers, are outfitted in luxe-safari style with large, cozy beds, soaking tubs, and desks crafted from reclaimed wood slabs. Lighting is embellished with beadwork and ceramic disks, which were made by regional artisans, as are the hand-batiked robes.\n\nIn keeping with the Disconnect to Reconnect motto espoused by Wilderness, there’s no Wi-Fi, so you can blessedly forget about email, the markets, and the latest headlines. But there are plenty of spots for reading and relaxing. All of the tents have outdoor seating areas—a couple have their own plunge pools—from which you can take in the wildlife along the riverbank. One afternoon, as I enjoyed an outdoor shower beneath a towering muhute tree, the only sounds came from birds in the canopy overhead, while baboons frolicked and groomed each other in the shade of a feverberry tree and the sun glinted off the river beyond.\n\nThe lure of the water is irresistible, and a boat excursion, especially in the late afternoon, is an essential part of the Chikwenya experience. You can go angling for tiger fish (the closest I came to a catch, alas, was when a yellow-billed kite swooped down and tried to steal my bait), or you can just sit back, drink in hand, gliding past groups of submerged hippos and solitary elephants feeding on the reed grasses of small, marshy islands. Out on the river, time slows and primordial rhythms seem to take over. As the sunlight began to fade and the colors deepened, I felt the ineffable sense of inner peace and connection that Terblanche had described wash over me.\n\nBack at camp, evenings began with cocktails and canapés in the palapa-style lounge or around the fire pit. Dinner was served at a communal table in a large open-air pavilion or at tables out on the lawn, and the quality and diversity of the food—especially for a far-flung campsite—was impressive. While we dined on plates of perfectly grilled rib eye and roasted potatoes beneath the stars, just a stone’s throw down the slope a two-ton hippo was having its own moonlit feast of riverbank grasses.\n\nOver meals, the members of Chikwenya’s small team shared safari stories, talked of their families, and offered thoughts on Zimbabwe’s future. For them, the stakes are, of course, personal. “I hope by the time people leave this place they have a better understanding of Zimbabwe,” said Mduli, “and a positive view of our country.”\n\nAt one point during my visit, the discussion turned to the topic of evolution. I found myself caught off guard when a couple of the guides told me they rejected the theories of Darwin. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been surprised. Whatever your spiritual beliefs, it’s not hard to embrace the idea that this magnificent natural setting was molded by a divine hand.

In addition to the female sibling and nighttime references, the name was inspired, Ms. Carroll said, by the moon’s intimate relationship with the Earth, how it affects tides and cycles of nature and, subtly, our bodies. The poetry of that interconnectedness struck a chord.\n\nThere is, after all, an unmistakable gravitational pull between members of this close-knit family, who seem to do just about everything together. Many of them even share a multigenerational home on a converted farm in Egremont, Mass., occupying 15 pastoral acres in the foothills of the Berkshire Mountains. Ms. Carroll, 42, and her husband, Ian Rasch, 44, a developer and builder, live with their 6-year-old daughter in the property’s farmhouse, built from 1850 to 1875 near the top of what is known as Baldwin Hill. The adjacent 1820s barn has been converted into two residences, the top one occupied by Ms. DeLuca, 63, and the one below by Mr. Rasch’s mother, Julia Rasch, 73, who is a midwife.\n\nAs for Ms. Sheffer, 40, she and her family live 25 minutes away in New Marlborough, Mass., but she is frequently found at the Baldwin Hill residence, which also serves as the Sister Moons headquarters. And when her two children, ages 7 and 3, aren’t in school, she often brings them along. Like most things in this family, child care is shared.\n\n“It sounds a little out there, but everything happens very organically,” Ms. Sheffer said during a reporter’s visit to Baldwin Hill in late July, just days after 30 relatives had come for a family reunion. Mr. Rasch’s young-adult niece and nephew, who were spending most of the summer there, entertained the youngsters as the rest of us chatted on the main house’s front porch, with a field of head-high corn across the road and views of the Taconic Mountains opposite.\n\nThe Rasch and Carroll families have ties to the region. Growing up in the area, Mr. Rasch and Ms. Carroll even attended the same high school for a couple of years. They went away for college and to start their careers, which took both to New York City, where they reconnected, married and then moved back to the Berkshires. Ms. Sheffer studied and worked in fashion before she settled in the area with her husband, Matt Sheffer, 36, the managing director of Hudson Carbon, an organization that researches how regenerative farming practices can be used to sequester carbon.\n\nIn their first several years together, Ms. Carroll and Mr. Rasch built one house and renovated another. He’s in the building business, and she, trained as a graphic designer, loves interiors and hunting for furnishings at flea markets and estate sales. (She often refinishes pieces herself.) They had long admired this well-known property — which operated as the Baldwin Hill Farm Bed & Breakfast for 22 years — just half a mile down the road from Ms. DeLuca’s home. “We actually knocked on the door once and asked the gentleman who owned it, when and if he ever wanted to sell it, if he’d consider talking to us,” Mr. Rasch said.\n\nAs it happened, when that day came, Ms. Carroll and Mr. Rasch were ready for their next project. They learned that a potential sale was in the works and they needed to act quickly. Though they’d had discussions with both of their mothers about finding a place where they could all live together, the idea hadn’t really advanced beyond some casual looking, until this opportunity arose.\n\n“I got a phone call or an email from Ian saying, ‘We saw this amazing property, and we’re going to buy it. Are you in?’” recounted Ms. Rasch, who lived in Philadelphia but was doing volunteer health care work in India at the time. “I had like five seconds to decide, literally. And so I said, ‘Yeah, why not?’”\n\nMs. DeLuca, who had already decided to sell her own longtime home, didn’t hesitate. “It wasn’t like we had the time to sit down and say, ‘OK, are we all in it?’ It happened overnight,” she said. “Papers got signed and all of a sudden, we were in it.”\n\nThey closed in January 2018, paying the $850,000 asking price and essentially agreeing to take the property as is, meaning packed with old furniture, kitchenware and other objects, not to mention farm equipment accumulated over many decades — all of which took months to clear out. Also, after consulting with specialists, they determined that several badly deteriorated farm buildings, some of them extensions off the barn, were beyond saving.\n\nFor this family, choosing cohabitation wasn’t exactly a leap into the unfamiliar. Ms. DeLuca said that when her daughters and their younger brother (who lives in Brooklyn) were growing up, the doors of their home were always open, and “dinners every night were at least 10 people at the table.” Anyone needing a place to stay was welcome, including one of Ms. Carroll’s best friends, who lived with them for much of high school.\n\nMs. Rasch, meanwhile, raised Ian and his two sisters in nearby Copake, N.Y., at the original Camphill Village, an intentional community where residents with developmental disabilities live and work alongside families of volunteers. “It was a 600-acre farm, and I grew up with 17 people in my house — mentally disabled children and adults,” Mr. Rasch said. “My upbringing was extreme. I mean, it was 17 people sharing three bathrooms.”\n\nHe said the design challenge for this project was striking a balance between creating a sense of family community, while respecting each other’s boundaries. So after toying with a few different scenarios, including building stand-alone homes for the mothers, they opted for perhaps the most streamlined — which is not to say easiest — solution.\n\nMs. Carroll and Mr. Rasch returned the main house to its 19th-century scale by demolishing a large addition that extended off the back, leaving three bedrooms for their family and a guest room and a renovated multipurpose attic space that has a bed. The moms, it was agreed, would live in separate residences in the barn, which had to be extensively rebuilt and a foundation added, requiring the structure to be elevated on hydraulic lifts.\n\n“It’s an iconic part of Baldwin Hill,” Mr. Rasch said of the barn, whose post-and-beam frame features 200-year-old chestnut timbers running the entire length. “Knocking it down, which we could have done — there’s no historical restriction — would not have been the right thing to do.”\n\nThroughout the project, they collaborated with the firms INC Architecture & Design, which executed the schematic elevations and floor plans, and MVA, which handled the building documents. Mr. Rasch’s company, Alander Construction, carried out the renovation work, and Ms. Carroll spearheaded the interiors. They started with the main house, where they replaced the asphalt-shingle roof with a standing-seam metal one, refreshed the aluminum clapboard siding and updated the windows, without altering the house’s profile. “The entire outside is exactly as it was — we just restored it,” said Mr. Rasch.\n\nIn rebuilding the front porch, they chose to leave off the railing, but their most visible change was to remove the overgrown plantings that had choked off the porch’s views, light and breezes, installing a simple gravel border in their place. Opening that up gave the entire front of the house a breath of fresh air, of which there is a lot in these parts. That’s notwithstanding the days when the adjacent fields are sprayed with fertilizer — a reminder that this is farmland, most of it protected under the Massachusetts Agricultural Preservation Restriction Program, meaning it cannot be developed.\n\nIndoors, Ms. Carroll and Mr. Rasch gutted most of the house, reconfiguring the former B&B’s awkward warren of bedrooms and closetlike baths, while updating the kitchen and entertaining spaces for modern family living. They kept and refinished the plank floors as well as the double front doors (with lovely stained-glass details), but the living room’s chunky stone fireplace with a hunting-lodge vibe was swapped out for a more contemporary one in blackened steel, topped by a minimalist white mantel.\n\nThe furnishings are a mostly modern mix with idiosyncratic finds from Ms. Carroll’s treasure hunts. “It’s one of my favorite things to do — it’s a sport of sorts,” she said, noting the living room’s pair of 1970s vintage rattan chairs she picked up at an estate sale and an old lyre case she converted into a side table. Artworks include paintings by Kiki Dufault and ceramic vessels by Liz Hamann, both of whom are friends.\n\nSister Moons’s block-printed sheets and channel-stitched coverlets in monochrome citrus hues — all made in a fair trade–certified facility in India — dress the beds in the main house and in the mothers’ residences in the barn. The barn’s lower level serves as a Sister Moons office and storage area, and as a sometime indoor rink for this family of avid roller skaters.\n\nIn spring, the barn building was finally finished, the traditional red exterior repainted a dusty blue that echoes the sky and haze on the surrounding mountains. Ms. DeLuca requested the top floor, coveting the 360-degree views.\n\nThat was just fine with Ms. Rasch, who preferred not to deal with stairs and was happy to be able to step right outside into the small orchard of apple and quince trees.\n\nMs. DeLuca’s must-haves included a sleep loft beneath the barn’s peaked roof, and a marble-lined bath with a double sink. “I actually found one from the Gilded Age at an estate sale,” she said. “Seventy-five dollars.”\n\nMs. Rasch, for her part, insisted on just one thing. “Ian asked if I wanted a bathtub or a shower,” she recounted, “and he said, ‘You can’t have both.’ I told him I needed both, and it was not negotiable.”\n\nFrom the barn or the house, it is a short walk to the swimming pool across a grassy field dotted with handsome old trees, including a large linden, a Katsura, a mulberry, even a rowanberry. Wenonah Webster, a landscape designer, made a few updates, but the gardens are a work in progress, and the family decided to embrace the wildness of a few of the overgrown areas.\n\nFarther out into the meadow that stretches behind the house, there’s an open spot where the family sometimes comes to build fires and enjoy the light as the sun sets behind Catamount Mountain. Ms. Carroll said she spent quite a few evenings there during the pandemic with friends, around the fire, drinks in hand.\n\n“We all feel really lucky,” she said of how things have worked out. Of course, that doesn’t mean she and Mr. Rasch are finished dreaming up new projects.\n\nPausing in a clearing, she remarked, “This is where one day maybe we’ll build a small modern glass house for us and rent out the rest.”\n\nAs a parent and a fan, football can be hard to view. The injuries. The anthem protest divide. The hypocrisy. But, deep down, I still love so much about the sport.\n\nBy Stephen Wallis\n\nDec 06 2017\n\nhttps://www.fatherly.com/love-money/why-i-still-watch-the-nfl/\n\nA couple of years ago, I watched the Steelers pull out an improbable last-minute playoff win against the Cincinnati Bengals in a nasty, rain-soaked night game marred by ugly penalties and vicious hits that knocked out multiple players with concussions. The Steelers, my Steelers, won, but it felt like both teams — and the NFL — lost. It was the type of game I hoped I’d never see again.\n\nThen I did. When the Steelers and Bengals met in Cincinnati this past Monday night, the rainy conditions called to mind that infamous playoff contest, even if the stakes were lower, thanks to the Bengals’ mediocre record. That wasn’t the only echo. This time the penalties were even more numerous and the hits more vicious, resulting in two players leaving the field strapped to carts. One of those, Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier, remains in a local hospital three days later, as doctors monitor a spinal injury that has impacted his movements from the waist down. As my own six-year-old boy slept peacefully in his room down the hall, I couldn’t help but think: That’s somebody’s son out there, lying motionless on the field. The Steelers got the win, again on a last-minute field goal, but the victory hardly felt worthy of celebration.\n\nThere’s no question the NFL — and football in general — has a problem. It’s not just the head-trauma horrors of concussions and CTE that we can no longer ignore. Or the devastating injuries to backs, knees, and shoulders that have derailed the seasons of too many of the league’s biggest stars this fall. Or the recent tragicomic legal sideshows, from Deflategate to the on-again-off-again suspension of Ezekiel Elliott for alleged domestic violence — one of a disturbing number of such incidents players have been involved in (see: Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson, Josh Brown). Or the ugly fight over embattled NFL commissioner Roger Goodell’s contract extension. Or the bewilderingly inconsistent — okay, at times downright poor — quality of play on the field. Or, not least, the most divisive issue facing the league: the national anthem protests. It’s all of those things and more, and it has produced a growing contingent of supporters who are increasingly conflicted over how to feel about this troubled sport as fans — and as parents.\n\nYet I still watch.\n\nThough I haven’t been to a game in a stadium in years, I track scores on Sundays and do my best to catch bits on TV. I’ve played fantasy football and occasionally in the past gambled very modestly on games — two of the things that turn casual fans into deeply engaged ones. When I married my wife, who tolerates — only just barely — my relationship with football, I knew the sport would not be a part of our family culture in the way it was for me growing up. But it still meant something to me.\n\nMy bond with football formed early. Growing up in Pittsburgh in the 1970s and ’80s, the Steelers and football were — and still are — religion. It was the era of the Steel Curtain, the Terrible Towel, four Super Bowls in a decade. Some of my biggest boyhood heroes were Joe Green, "
