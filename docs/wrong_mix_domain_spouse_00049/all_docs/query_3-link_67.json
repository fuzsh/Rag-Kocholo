        "text": "2024 Edition\n\nDr. Thomas L. Constable\n\nIntroduction\n\nTitle\n\nThe Hebrews derived the title of this book from the first word in it, wayyiqra', translated \"Now the LORD called\" (1:1). \"Now\" is a conjunction that shows that what follows in Leviticus is a continuation of the narrative of Exodus. There is no break in the flow of thought. This is the third book of the Torah (Law).\n\nThe English title comes from the Vulgate (Latin version), which called this book Liber Leviticus. The Vulgate title came from the Septuagint (Greek version), which had as the title Leuitikon, meaning \"relating to the Levites.\" This title is appropriate, since the book contains requirements of the Mosaic Covenant that relate to the Levites, though the Levites are mentioned by name in only two verses (25:32, 33). More specifically, the priests, who were a group within the tribe of Levi, are those in view throughout the book.\n\n\"It would be wrong, however, to describe Leviticus simply as a manual for priests. It is equally, if not more, concerned with the part the laity should play in worship. Many of the regulations explain what the layman should sacrifice. They tell him when to go to the sanctuary, what to bring, and what he may expect the priest to do when he arrives. Most of the laws apply to all Israel: only a few sections specifically concern the priests alone, e.g., chs. 21â22. The lay orientation of the legislation is particularly noticeable in ch. 23, where the whole emphasis lies on the days that must be observed as days of sabbath rest.\"\n\nDate and Writer\n\nAlmost all Jewish and Christian scholars regarded Moses as the writer of all five books of the Law, until about 150 years ago. God evidently revealed the material Moses recorded in Leviticus after He renewed the covenant with Israel (1:1; cf. Exod. 34:1-28). Leviticus is unique, in that it is largely a record of God's instructions to Moses. Twenty of the 27 chapters begin, \"The LORD spoke to Moses,\" or a variation of that statement. This phrase also occurs in 14 other places in the book. Yet the book nowhere claims that Moses wrote it.\n\n\"There is no book in the whole compass of that inspired Volume which the Holy Spirit has given us, that contains more of the very words of God than Leviticus. It is God that is the direct speaker in almost every page; His gracious words are recorded in the form wherein they were uttered.\"\n\n\"Critical biblical scholarship of the late nineteenth century challenged the traditional dating and authorship of Leviticus. According to that scholarship, which is still influential today, Leviticus was written much later, during the postexilic period. This would be a date after 530 B.C. During the past century, however, our understanding of the history, languages, cultures, and religions of the ancient Middle East including Israel has advanced greatly. Many of the premises on which the late dating of Leviticus was based have been shown to be unreliable.\"\n\n\"â¦ the fact that the Ras Shamra Tablets, dating back to about 1400 B.C., record several laws similar to those of Leviticus shows that the liberal has no right to deny the possibility of such a code of sacrificial laws as early as the time of Moses.\"\n\n\"A good case can be made that Leviticus was Moses' first 'publication.' The other books of the Pentateuch seem to presuppose arrival at the plains of Moab, but Leviticus offers hints that its contents were all revealed at Sinai (Lev. 27:34) and before 'the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt' (Num. 1:1, NIV). The date of 1446 B.C. for the Exodus suggests that Leviticus was written abound 1444 B.C.\"\n\nScope\n\nAs noted, Leviticus contains revelation that was particularly appropriate for the priests. While ritual and legal matters predominate, Moses wove them into the historical narrative so, as one reads Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers in order, there is chronological movement forward. As we shall see, the legislation appears in the narrative at logical and significant places.\n\n\"The content of Leviticus supplements and completes that of Exodus in the religious and social spheresâand particularly the religious and ritual aspects of the covenant as made, broken and renewed actually at Sinai; this would be reflected by the terminal blessings and curses of Leviticus 26.\"\n\n\"Leviticus enlarges upon matters involving the ordering of worship at the divine sanctuary that are mentioned only briefly in Exodus. Whereas the latter described the specifications and construction of the tabernacle, Leviticus narrates the way in which the priests are to care for the sanctuary and throne room of the Great King. The work is a fundamentally important legal treatise because it contains the regulations by which the religious and civil life of the Hebrew nation was to be governed once the land of Canaan was occupied.\"\n\nHistorically, the book fits within the one month between God's occupation of the tabernacle (Exod. 40:17, 34-38), and the taking of the census at Sinai (Num. 1:1-3). However, because it contains so much legal material, we should read it along with the rest of the Mosaic Law that God began to reveal in Exodus.\n\n\"It carries on to its completion the giving of the law at Sinai, which commenced at Ex. 25, and by which the covenant constitution was firmly established.\"\n\nPurpose\n\nMany students of this book have expressed their understanding of the purpose of Leviticus in various ways:\n\n\"Though the covenant arrangement up to this point clearly specified the need for Israel, the vassal, to appear before her Lord on stated occasions and singled out first Moses and then the priesthood as mediators in this encounter, there yet remained the need to describe the nature of the tribute to be presented, the precise meaning and function of the priesthood, the definition of holiness and unholiness, and a more strict clarification of the places and times of pilgrimage to the dwelling place of the great King. This is the purpose of the book of Leviticus.\"\n\n\"The central theme of the book is holiness. The book intends to show how Israel was to fulfill its covenant responsibility to be 'a kingdom of priests and a holy nation' (Ex 19:6; Lev 26:5 [sic 2]).\"\n\n\"The essence of holiness â¦ lies in relinquishing one's desires about the things of this world. In other words, holiness is essentially a matter of the human heart.\"\n\n\"The purpose of the book is to provide guidelines to priests and laypeople concerning appropriate behavior in the presence of a holy God, thus the emphasis is on communicating information, not on subtle or artificial literary plays.\"\n\n\"It was intended for the entire Israelite community, with at least two purposes: (1) that people would know and value their privileges and responsibilities before God; and (2) that priests could not gain oppressive power over the people with any monopoly on the knowledge of how to approach God.\"\n\n\"Leviticus was written to show Israel how to live as a holy nation in fellowship with God, and thus to prepare the nation for the high service of mediating the redemption of God to all the nations.\"\n\n\"How to maintain the vital covenantal relationship between the Israelites and their God is the concern of the book of Leviticus.\"\n\nGenre\n\nLeviticus is essentially a narrative document (a story), that relates the events that transpired in the life of the Israelites while the nation camped at the base of Mt. Sinai. However, most of the material in the book is legal in genre (type or kind of composition). The legal sections prepare the reader to understand the narrative sections, not only in Leviticus, but also in Numbers and the rest of the Bible.\n\n\"The story exists for the sake of the laws which it frames.\"\n\nThere are two clear narrative sections (chs. 8â10; 24:10-23). However, the hinge chapter in the book, chapter 16, reads as narrativeâeven though it is actually legislative (legal) material. As a whole, this book, like the rest of the Torah, is theological instructional history. The following diagram shows the alternating pattern of legal and narrative material in the book:\n\nAÂ Â Â Â Â Â Legal chs. 1â7\n\nBÂ Â Â Â Â Â Narrative chs. 8â10\n\nAÂ Â Â Â Â Â Legal chs. 11â15\n\nCÂ Â Â Â Â Â Legal written as narrative ch. 16\n\nAÂ Â Â Â Â Â Legal 17:1â24:9\n\nBÂ Â Â Â Â Â Narrative 24:10-23\n\nAÂ Â Â Â Â Â Legal chs. 25â27\n\nImportance\n\n\"â¦ it is no exaggeration to claim that the Book of Leviticus has had more impact on Judaism than any other book of the Old Testament. Traditionally it was the first book taught to Jewish children, and over half the commentary of the Talmud is concerned with understanding its contents.\"\n\nLeviticus tends to be the last book many Christians study. It has been called the \"Bermuda Triangle of the Bible,\" because many Christians get lost in the book. It is often the place where Christians, who have determined to read through their Bible in a year, get bogged down and give up. Yet Leviticus is part of Scripture, all of which is \"inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man or woman of God may be fully capable, equipped for every good work\" (2 Tim. 3:16-17). The New Testament writers referred to Leviticus over 40 times.\n\n\"It takes knowledge, discernment, patience, eagerness, and devotion to Christ and God's Word to appreciate and love Leviticus.\"\n\n\"New Testament theology makes full use of the idea of holiness. All Christians are holy, 'saints' in most English translations. That is, they have been called by God to be his people just as ancient Israel had been (Col. 1:2; 1 Pet. 1:2; 2:9-10; cf. Exod. 19:5-6). But this state of holiness must find expression in holy living (Col. 1:22; 1 Pet. 1:15). Sanctification is expressed through obedience to the standard of teaching (Rom. 6:17-19), just as in Leviticus through obedience to the law. Peter urges his readers to make the motto of Leviticus their own: 'Be holy, for I am holy' (1 Pet. 1:16). The imitation of God is a theme that unites the ethics of Old and New Testaments (cf. Matt. 5:48; 1 Cor. 11:1).\"\n\n\"Without a basic knowledge of Leviticus, [the Book of] Hebrews will remain a closed book to the Christian.\"\n\n\"â¦ the principles underlying the OT are valid and authoritative for the Christian, but the particular applications found in the OT may not be. The moral principles are the same today, but insofar as our situation often differs from the OT setting, the application of the principles in our society may well be different now.\"\n\n\"â¦ the Levitical rituals are still of immense relevance. It was in terms of these sacrifices that Jesus himself and the early church understood his atoning death. Leviticus provided the theological models for their understanding. If we wish to walk in our Lord's steps and think his thoughts after him, we must attempt to understand the sacrificial system of Leviticus. It was established by the same God who sent his Son to die for us; and in rediscovering the principles of OT worship written there, we may learn something of the way we should approach a holy God.\"\n\n\"Modern Christians can learn much from Leviticus. The holiness of God, the necessity of holy living, the great cost of atonement and forgiveness, the privilege and responsibility of presenting only our best to God, the generosity of God that enables His people to be generousâthese are only some of the lessons. Leviticus reveals the holiness of God and His love for His people in ways found nowhere else in the Bible.\"\n\n\"Theology is what Leviticus is all about. It pervades every chapter and almost every verse. It is not expressed in pronouncements but embedded in rituals.\"\n\nStructure\n\n\"At first sight the book of Leviticus might appear to be a haphazard, even repetitious arrangement of enactments involving the future life in Canaan of the Israelite people. Closer examination will reveal, however, that quite apart from the division of the work into two basic themes, many of the chapters have their own literary structure. Examples of this can be seen in material patterned after the fashion of a Mesopotamian tablet, with its title, textual content and colophon, as in Leviticus 1:3â7:38. [A colophon is an inscription, usually at the end of an ancient book, giving facts about its production.] Other chapters exhibit a distinct form of construction, which would doubtless prove extremely valuable for purposes of memorizing the contents. Examples of this are to be found in the triadic pattern of the leprosy regulations introduced by the phrase 'The Lord said to Moses' (Lv. 13:1; 14:1, 33), or the concentric arrangement of propositions (palistrophe) in Leviticus 24:16-22. A particularly attractive literary form is the introverted (chiastic) passage occurring in Leviticus 15:2-30, suggesting considerable artistic ability on the part of the writer.\"\n\nOutline\n\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â The public worship of the Israelites chs. 1â16\n\nA.Â Â Â Â Â The laws of sacrifice chs. 1â7\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â The burnt offering ch. 1\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The grain offering ch. 2\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â The peace offerings ch. 3\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â The sin offerings 4:1â5:13\n\n5.Â Â Â Â Â The guilt offerings 5:14â6:7\n\n6.Â Â Â Â Â Instructions for the priests concerning the offerings 6:8â7:38\n\nB.Â Â Â Â Â The institution of the Aaronic priesthood chs. 8â10\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â The consecration of the priests and the sanctuary ch. 8\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The entrance of Aaron and his sons into their office ch. 9\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â The sanctification of the priesthood ch. 10\n\nC.Â Â Â Â Â Laws relating to ritual cleanliness chs. 11â15\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Uncleanness due to contact with certain animals ch. 11\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Uncleanness due to childbirth ch. 12\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Uncleanness due to skin and covering abnormalities chs. 13â14\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Uncleanness due to bodily discharges associated with reproduction ch. 15\n\nD.Â Â Â Â Â The Day of Atonement ch. 16\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Introductory information 16:1-10\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Instructions concerning the ritual 16:11-28\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Instructions concerning the duty of the people 16:29-34\n\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â The private worship of the Israelites chs. 17â27\n\nA.Â Â Â Â Â Holiness of conduct on the Israelites' part chs. 17â20\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Holiness of food ch. 17\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Holiness of the marriage relationship ch. 18\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Holiness of behavior toward God and man ch. 19\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Punishments for serious crimes ch. 20\n\nB.Â Â Â Â Â Holiness of the priests, gifts, and sacrifices chs. 21â22\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â The first list of regulations for priests 21:1-15\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The second list of regulations for priests 21:16-24\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â The third list of regulations for priests ch. 22\n\nC.Â Â Â Â Â Sanctification of the Sabbath and the set seasons of Yahweh ch. 23\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â The Sabbath 23:1-3\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The Feast of Passover and Unleavened Bread 23:4-14\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â The Feast of Pentecost 23:15-22\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â The Blowing of Trumpets 23:23-25\n\n5.Â Â Â Â Â The Day of Atonement 23:26-32\n\n6.Â Â Â Â Â The Feast of Tabernacles 23:33-44\n\nD.Â Â Â Â Â The preparation of the holy lamps and showbread 24:1-9\n\nE.Â Â Â Â Â The punishment of a blasphemer 24:10-23\n\nF.Â Â Â Â Â Â Sanctification of the possession of land by the sabbatical and jubilee years ch. 25\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â The sabbatical year 25:1-7\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The Year of Jubilee 25:8-55\n\nG.Â Â Â Â Â Promises and warnings ch. 26\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Introduction to the final conditions of the covenant 26:1-2\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The blessings for fidelity to the law 26:3-13\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â The warnings for contempt of the law 26:14-33\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â The objective of God's judgments in relation to the land and nation of Israel 26:34-46\n\nH.Â Â Â Â Â Directions concerning vows ch. 27\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Vows concerning persons 27:1-8\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Vows concerning animals 27:9-13\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Vows concerning other property 27:14-29\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â The redemption of tithes 27:30-34\n\nMessage\n\nThe major theme of Leviticus is worship. Moses introduced this theme in the later chapters of Exodus, but he developed it more fully in Leviticus. The book reveals how sinful, albeit redeemed Israelites, could enjoy a continuing relationship with the holy God who dwelt among them. It also reveals how they could maintain that relationship and express it through worship.\n\nOne major revelation in Leviticus is the nature of sin. God took for granted, in Leviticus, the fact that man is a sinner. He had already established this in Genesis and Exodus. He clarified the nature of man's sinfulness in Leviticus. According to Leviticus, sin has a threefold character:\n\nFirst, sin is unlikeness to God. In the Creation we see man made in the image of God, but in the Fall we begin to see man's unlikeness to God. The whole system of worship in Leviticus teaches man's unlikeness to God. God is different from man ethically and morally. The word holy (Heb. kodesh) occurs over 150 times in Leviticus, more than in any other book of the Bible. The word holiness occurs over 80 times. The Hebrew word kodesh occurs even in the sections of the book dealing with personal hygiene. \"Holy\" is a general term for moral excellence.\n\nHoly means pure, unblemished, clean, blameless. The opposite of holy is unclean. It is in contrast with God's holiness that we can understand man's sinfulness. Leviticus reveals the standards by which sinful redeemed Israelites could have fellowship with a holy God. These standards and regulations point out the vast difference between the character of man and the character of God. As Christians, God sees us as He sees His Son (i.e., \"in Christ\"). Yet in our natural state, we are very unlike God.\n\nSecond, sin is essentially the wrong that man does to God. To have a relationship with God, the wrong that the redeemed sinner had done to God had to be atoned for. The Israelite committed this wrong daily. It was the natural fruit of his sinful human nature. Consequently, he had to make payment for his sin to God periodically (daily, monthly, seasonally, and yearly). God specified how the sinners were to pay for the wrong done Him, namely, by the offerings and sacrifices specified in the Law.\n\nIn Leviticus we also learn that the wrong done to another human being is also a wrong done to God. People belong to God, God gives them their lives in trust, and they bear God's image. When a person violates the basic rights of another human being, he has wronged not only that person but God as well (cf. Gen. 39:9; Ps. 51:4). We, too, as Christians, sin daily, but \"Jesus paid it all.\" We could never compensate God adequately for the wrong we do to Him by sinning, but Jesus did.\n\nThird, sin results in distance from God. Because man is unlike God in his character, he is separate from God in his experience. The Israelites could not approach Godâexcept as God made a way and brought them near to Himself. The Levitical system of worship illustrated the distance between man and Godâdue to sinâand the need for some provision to bring man back to God. The veil, the curtains, and the priests separated the ordinary Israelite from God. He doubtless sensed his personal separation from God as he participated in the ritual worship. After the Fall, Adam and Eve felt this same separation, and hid from God. Jesus tore the veil of separation in two, and opened access to God for us.\n\nA second major revelation in Leviticus is the nature of atonement. Atonement is the solution to the worldwide problem that sin creates. \"Atonement\" means reparation for a wrong or injury, having one's account with God covered, and sin-debt forgivenâalbeit pending a final removal of sin through Christ's sacrifice. God removed (covered) the sins of the Israelites until a final, acceptable sacrifice would pay for them completely. Old Testament saints obtained salvation \"on credit.\" God accepted a substitute sacrifice (the credit payment) until final payment would be made (by Christ)âlike a merchant accepts a credit card until final payment is made.\n\n\"The sin was covered [by God], but not 'taken away,' pending the foreseen death of Christ.\"\n\nThrough atonement, men who were sinners could enter into fellowship with God. Three things had to be present to make atonement for sin. These applied to both initial atonement and continuing atonement.\n\nFirst, there had to be substitution. Every animal sacrifice in Israel involved the substitution of one life for another. A living being had to stand in the sinner's place and take the punishment for his sin. The substitute had to be sinless. Every sacrifice of an animal involved the death of an innocent substitute, since animals do not sin. They are not morally responsible.\n\nSecond, there had to be imputation. God transferred the guilt of the sinner onto his animal substitute, when the sinner personally identified with his substitute by laying his hands on it. This ritual symbolized the transference of guilt for the Israelites.\n\nThird, there had to be death. Finally, the substitute, to which God had imputed the sinner's guilt, had to die. Atonement could not take place without death. The shedding of blood both illustrated and symbolized death, and was the biblical basis for the removal (forgiveness) of sins. Blood is the essence of life (17:11). Bloodshed was a visual demonstration of life poured out. Sin always results in death (cf. Rom. 6:23).\n\nClearly, love lay behind this plan, even though Moses did not explain in Leviticus why God provided atonement. This explanation comes first in Deuteronomy. God opened the way for sinners to have fellowship with Himself by providing for the covering of sins. Alternatively, God could have preserved His holiness, and satisfied the demands of His justice, by annihilating every sinner. Instead, God chose another way, because He loves people.\n\nA third major revelation in Leviticus is the nature of redemption. Redemption essentially means purchase. To redeem means to purchase for oneself. When God redeemed Israel in Egypt, He bought the nation of Israel for Himself. God thereby provided freedom for the Israelites, so that they could be His special possession (Exod. 19:5-6). Leviticus teaches three things about redemption:\n\nFirst, redemption rests on righteousness. Leviticus reveals that God did what was rightâHe provided both forgiveness and righteousnessâin order to restore man to Himself. He did not simply dismiss sin as unimportant. He provided a wayâsubstitutionary atonementâwhereby the guilt of sin could be paid for righteously. Redemption rests on a righteous payment to God, not pity.\n\nSecond, redemption is possible only by blood. The sacrificial shedding of blood is the giving up of life. The rites of animal sacrifice portrayed this graphically. People do not obtain redemption when they pour out their lives in service, but by a life poured out in death (cf. Heb. 9:22). Mankind's redemption ultimately cost God the life of His own Son.\n\nThird, redemption should produce holiness. Redemption should lead to a manner of life that is separate from sin. Redemption does not excuse us from the responsibility of being holy. It gives us the opportunity to be holy. Holiness of life results from a relationship to God and fellowship (communion) with Him, which redemption makes possible.\n\nRedemption deals with the sinner's relationship to God, whereas atonement deals with his relationship to sin. People experience redemption, which yields freedom and ability to love, know, serve, and worship God. But God is the One who has atoned for their sins. Atonement involves the punishment, destruction, and removal of all their wrongness.\n\nI would summarize the message of Leviticus as follows, on the basis of this threefold emphasis on sin, atonement, and redemption: God has made provision for the removal of human sin so that people can have fellowship with Him.\n\n\"â¦ Leviticus is concerned with fellowship; and it is the supreme Old Testament illustration of that great New Testament truth expressed in I John 1. 7â'If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from all sin.'\"\n\nThe sacrificial system in Israel bridged the gap between God and man adequately, but it was only a temporary solution to the problem of human estrangement from God. Jesus Christ provided a superior sacrifice for sin that satisfied God completely (Heb. 10:8-10; 1 John 2:2). Animals could never completely atone for human sin. God required the death of a human being who was a sinless sacrifice to do that. The writer of the Book of Hebrews compared these sacrifices at length in Hebrews 9 and 10.\n\nBy way of review, Genesis reveals that God made people in His own image to have fellowship with Himself. Man enjoyed that fellowship as long as he trusted and obeyed God. However, when people ceased to trust and obey Him, sin broke that fellowship. God then proceeded to demonstrate to fallen humanity that He is trustworthy, faithful. Those individuals who trusted and obeyed Him were able to enjoy fellowship with God again.\n\nExodus emphasizes that God is also sovereign. He is the ultimate ruler of the universe who can and did redeem the nation of Israel. He did this so that He could demonstrate, to all people of all time, how glorious it can be to live under the government of God.\n\nLeviticus deals with how redeemed sinners can have fellowship with a holy God. Leviticus clarifies both the sinfulness of man and the holiness of God. The proper response of the redeemed sinner to a holy God is worship. Leviticus explains how Israel was to worship God. The Israelites worshipped God under the Old Covenant. The forms of Christians worship are different, because we live under the New Covenant.\n\n\"In the Book of Exodus we see the offer of pardon; Leviticus offers purity. In Exodus we have God's approach to man; in Leviticus it is man's approach to God. In Exodus, Christ is the Savior; in Leviticus, He is the Sanctifier. In Exodus man's guilt is prominent; in Leviticus man's defilement is prominent. In Exodus, God speaks out of the mount; in Leviticus, He speaks out of the tabernacle. In Exodus man is made nigh to God; in Leviticus man is kept nigh to God.\"\n\nGenesis teaches the importance of faith. Exodus teaches that faith manifests itself in worship and obedience. Leviticus teaches us more about worship.\n\nExposition\n\nI.Â Â Â Â Â The public worship of the Israelites chs. 1â16\n\nLeviticus deals with the progressive sanctification of the Israelites, not their justification. The laws in Leviticus were God's revealed will for how His already redeemed people should live, not for their salvation. Likewise, they help New Testament believers understand what is necessary for sanctification, not justification.\n\nLeviticus continues revelation concerning the second of three elements necessary for any nation to exist. These three elements are: a people (Gen. 12:10âExod. 19), their law (Exod. 20âNum. 10:10), and their land (Num. 10:11âJosh. 24). Leviticus deals mainly with the Israelites' law. The first major section of this book deals with how the Israelites were to conduct their public life as an expression of worship to God. It explains that the ground or basis of fellowship is sacrifice.\n\n\"The fact that the covenant between Yahweh and Israel was modeled after those of the ancient Near East in both form and function allows one to understand the myriad of cultic detail in the Pentateuch with unusual clarity. The sacrifices and offerings were designed to demonstrate the subservience of Israel, to atone for her offenses against her Sovereign, Yahweh, and to reflect the harmoniousness and peaceableness of the relationship thus established or reestablished.\"\n\n\"Put differently, the main concern of Leviticus 1â16 is the continuance of the presence of God in the midst of the sinful nation, while Leviticus 17â27 records the effect of the presence of God upon the congregation. Consequently the abiding presence of God in the midst of the nation spans the entire contents of the Book of Leviticus.\"\n\nThus the emphasis in Leviticus is from doctrine (chs. 1â16) to practice (chs. 17â27), as in Romans 1â11 and 12â16, and in Ephesians 1â3 and 4â6. Similarly, the arrangement of the content of Leviticus reflects that of the Ten Commandments, where the first four commandments deal with the believer's relationship to God, and the last six his or her relationship to other people.\n\nUsually when God gave instructions to Moses, He told him to deliver them to all the people (1:1-2; 4:1-2; 7:22-23, 28-29; 11:1-2; 12:1-2; 15:1-2; 17:1-2; 18:1-2; 19:1-2; 20:1-2; 22:17-18; 23:1-2, 9-10, 23-24, 33-34; 24:1-2; 25:1-2; 27:1-2). In the religions of Israel's neighbor nations, the priests had exclusive knowledge of cultic practices. This made it easy for them to abuse these practices and to take advantage of the people. But in Israel the people knew what the priests were supposed to be doing and how they were to do it. This provided a check on priestly power that was unique in Israel.\n\n\"In the present context the term 'cultus' should be taken to mean the expression of religious experience in concrete external actions performed within the congregation or community, preferably by officially appointed exponents and in set forms.\"\n\n\"â¦ the cult can be defined as the visible form of the religious life.\"\n\nA.Â Â Â Â The laws of sacrifice chs. 1â7\n\nFew historical events are recorded in Leviticus compared to Genesis and Exodus, but the ones that have been are very significant. As mentioned previously, Leviticus is mainly a narrative document containing many ceremonial (religious) and civil (governmental) laws. The legal parts prepare us to understand the narrative parts. For example, the five offerings in chapters 1â7 help us understand why Israel behaved as she did, in bringing offerings from then on. The Hebrew word qorban, translated \"offering,\" comes from the verb that means \"to bring near.\" It literally means \"that which one brings near to God.\"\n\nGod designed these offerings to teach the Israelites, as well as to enable them to worship Him. Thus they had both a revelatory and a regulatory purpose. They taught the people what was necessary to maintain and restore the believers' communion with God in view of their sin and defilement.\n\n\"The sacrifices were in no sense prayers, but rather the preparation for prayer.\"\n\n\"The servant â¦ had to approach his Sovereign at His dwelling place by presenting an appropriate token of his obedient submission.\"\n\n\"Sacrifice is at the heart of all true worship. It serves as the consecrating ritual for participation in the holy rites, it forms the appropriate tribute due to the LORD, and it represents the proper spiritual attitude of the worshiper.\"\n\n\"Where there is conscious opposition between man's will and God's, no offering can avail. For this reason, in contrast to the view of the ancient Near Eastern world, there was to the Israelite mind absolutely no atoning power present in the act of sacrifice itself. The offering was not a magical rite that controlled the will of the deity. The value of the offering depended on the degree to which the spiritual disposition of the person presenting it conformed with what was thereby symbolized (1 Sam. 15:22).\"\n\n\"The examination of individual sacrifices that follows leads to a covenantal interpretation of sacrifice in Israel. Covenant refers to the relationship that exists between God and his people Israel. This covenant relationship is related to sacrifice in three ways. First, sacrifice is a gift on the part of the worshiper to his covenant Lord. Second, a number of sacrifices include a notion of communion or fellowship between covenant partners. Last, and perhaps most important, sacrifice plays a major role in healing rifts in the covenant relationship. This function is frequently described by the technical theological term expiation.\"\n\n\"The sacrifices of the Old Testament were symbolical and typical. An outward observance without any real inward meaning is only a ceremony. But a rite which has a present spiritual meaning is a symbol; and if, besides, it also points to a future reality, conveying at the same time, by anticipation, the blessing that is yet to appear, it is a type. Thus the Old Testament sacrifices were not only symbols, nor yet merely predictions by fact (as prophecy is a prediction by word), but they already conveyed to the believing Israelite the blessing that was to flow from the future reality to which they pointed.\"\n\n\"The rites here detailed were typical; and every type was designed and intended by God to bear resemblance to some spiritual truth.\"\n\n\"Suppose that one to whom you were a stranger was wrapt in a thick veil, so that you could not discern his features; still, if the lineaments were pointed out to you through the folds, you could form some idea of the beauty and form of the veiled one. But suppose that one whom you know and loveâwhose features you have often studied face to faceâwere to be veiled up in this way, how easily you would discern the features and form of this beloved one! Just so the Jews looked upon a veiled Saviour, whom they had never seen unveiled. We, under the New Testament, look upon an unveiled Saviour; and, going back to the Old, we can see far better than the Jews could, the features and form of Jesus the Beloved, under that veil.\"\n\n\"â¦ as one has said, these Levitical sacrifices are perhaps 'the most complete description' of our Saviour's atoning work anywhere given to us.\"\n\nThe regulations that follow do not contain all the detail that we would need to duplicate these sacrifices. Only such information that helps the reader understand and appreciate future references to the offerings appears. In this respect, the present section of text is similar to the instructions concerning the tabernacle. Neither section gives us all the information we could want, but both tell us all that we need to know.\n\n\"They [chapters 1â7] may be compared to the genealogies in Genesis and those at the beginning of 1 Chronicles, whose purpose is to introduce the main characters of the subsequent narratives.\"\n\nAll of these sacrifices were voluntary in the sense that there was no enforcement system in Israel that compelled the people to bring them. However, the first three \"soothing aroma\" offerings (burnt, grain, and peace) were voluntary in the sense that the offerer was not under obligation (by the Law) to bring them, but the last two \"non-soothing aroma\" offerings (sin and guilt) were compulsory in the sense that the offerer was under obligation (by the Law) to bring them.\n\nThe Israelites did not die if they did not bring any of these sacrifices, but God commanded them nonetheless. By bringing them, the Israelite showed his sensitivity to God, and his desire to live in unbroken fellowship with God. Hardhearted Israelites probably brought very few voluntary sacrifices, just as hardhearted Christians fail to bring the sacrifices of praise, good works, sharing what they have, submission to authority, and confession to God (Heb. 13:15-17; 1 John 1:9).\n\nTwo of the sacrifices dealt with commitment to God (the burnt and the grain), one dealt with communion with God (the peace), and two dealt with cleansing from God (the sin and the guilt).\n\nEach of these five Israelite offerings involved three objects:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â The offerer (the person bringing the offering)\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The offering (the animal or other object being offered)\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â The mediator (the priest).\n\n\"In the Old Testament the Hebrew word [translated \"priest\"] helps us to understand the nature of the priestly office. It is that of mediating. The New Testament word reveals the character of those who are to fill the office. They are holy.\"\n\nThere were important differences between the offerings:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Each offering was different from the other offerings.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â For each offering there were different options: of what the offerer could present, and how he could offer them.\n\nThe most basic difference between these offerings, was that some were primarily for worship (soothing or \"sweet savor\"), and the rest were primarily for expiation (non-soothing). The first three major offerings were of the first type, and the last two were of the second type.\n\n\"The sweet-savour offerings typify Christ in His own meritorious perfections. The non-sweet savour offerings typify Christ as bearing the demerit of the sinner. The sweet-savour offerings speak rather of what the offering of Christ means to God. The non-sweet savour offerings speak rather of what the offering of Christ means to usâand it is in connection with these that we here find the nine occurrences of the words, 'It shall be forgiven' (iv. 20, 26, 31, 35; v. 10, 13, 16, 18; vi. 7).\"\n\nThe first three worship offerings were a \"sweet aroma\" to God, because they were made in communion with, and to celebrate communion with, the LORD. Each of these offerings reveals what is essential for, or what results from, a relationship between a redeemed sinner and a holy God.\n\nThe last two expiation offerings were for sin's committed, and were therefore not a sweet savor to God. These offerings restored a broken relationship between the redeemed Israelite sinner and his holy God. They were for reestablishing communion with God.\n\n\"This is not the order in which the sacrifices were usually offered, but is rather a logical or didactic order, grouping the sacrifices by conceptual associations. â¦\"\n\nIn the revelation of the first three offerings, God described the most valuable (costly) sacrifice first, and then the less valuable. The rules about these sacrifices may have been arranged in logical order in order to make them easier to memorize.\n\n\"The readiest, but perhaps the most superficial, arrangement of the sacrifices is into bloody and unbloody.\"\n\nGod specified that three kinds of four-footed beasts (oxen, sheep, and goats), and two kinds of birds (turtle-doves and pigeons) should be offered as animal sacrifices.\n\n\"Canaanite sacrificial ritual was much more diversified than Israelite. Many more animals were employed as offerings.\"\n\nAnother important distinction is that some of the sacrifices that God prescribed were private (i.e., for an individual), and some were public (i.e., for the whole congregation). Furthermore, some sacrifices were voluntary and others were prescribed. That is, they were prescribed under certain circumstances, but it was still up to the Israelite to bring it of his own free will, if it was a private sacrifice. And some were most (or more) holy, while others were less holy. A chart of the basic differences between the first three sacrifices follows:\n\nThese laws concerning offerings appear here in the text because they explain the sacrifices and ceremonies that took place at the ordination of Aaron and his sons, which Moses recorded in chapters 8 and 9. Thus, this legal material prepares the reader to understand that narrative material later.\n\n1.Â Â Â Â The burnt offering ch. 1\n\nThis section of Leviticus, and the whole book, opens with the statement \"the LORD called to Moses\" (v. 1). This is the third time that we read of the LORD calling to Moses in this wayâin addition to the burning bush incident (Exod. 3:4), and on Mt. Sinai (Exod. 19:3). Having taken possession of the tabernacle, God now gave orders to His servant Moses from that audience chamber. Previously, God had spoken to the Israelites publicly from Mt. Sinai, and to Moses privately on that mountain. But now that the tabernacle was complete, God spoke to Moses in an audible voice from above the mercy seat. All of the revelations that follow these announcements are very significant.\n\n\"It is my view the 'He is' [the meaning of LORD, Yahweh] â¦ characterizes God as He who is unchanging and can therefore be depended on by His covenant people.\"\n\nAll of the Israelites were to understand the laws affecting sacrifices (v. 2). This was different from Israel's neighbor nations, in which much of the priestly activity was deliberately kept secret and thought of as magical.\n\n\"Anyone of you\" (v. 2) probably includes non-Israelites who lived among the Israelites, as well as the Israelites themselves, including women (cf. Num. 15:14, 16, 29). They all had access to the whole tabernacle courtyard, from its entrance to the entrance to the tent.\n\nThe \"burnt offering\" (v.4) in Greek, holokautoma, (from which we get the English word \"holocaust\") expressed the offerer's complete consecration to Yahweh (cf. Matt. 22:37; Rom. 12:1-2), as well as God's complete acceptance of the worshiper. The hand-laying requirement (v. 4) may have symbolized the offerer's ownership of the animal more than his transference of sin to it, his identification with it, or his declaration of his purpose or innocence.\n\nHowever, this offering also made atonement for the offerer (cf. John 1:29), covering his or her sins. As such, it forms the foundation of the entire sacrificial system of Israel. Some rabbis believed the burnt offering atoned for all sins not covered under the sin offering. Peace with God (having God's enmity removed and being reconciled to God) was the goal of all the sacrifices.\n\nThe reasons for listing this offering first include: that it was the most common and therefore in one sense the most important one, and because it belonged completely to God. (The New English Bible translated this offering as a \"whole-offering.\") The priests offered a burnt offering every morning and every evening, and more frequently on holy days, as a public offering.\n\n\"The first case is dealt with in the most detail. The two subsequent ones are explained more briefly. But in all three the law makes clear exactly what the worshipper does and what the priest does. The worshipper brings the animal, kills it, skins it or guts it, and chops it up. The priest sprinkles the blood on the altar and places the dismembered carcass on the fire [cf. 2 Chron. 30:17].\"\n\n\"The sense of God's presence, which permeates the entire book, is indicated forty-two times by the expression 'before the LORD [v. 3, et al.].'\"\n\n\"Before the LORD\" means within the sacred tabernacle precincts.\n\nWith this offering the worshiper was seeking to please the LORD, and to find acceptance into His presence as a redeemed person. In the case of the morning and evening sacrifices, this offering represented the same sentiment on behalf of the redeemed nation. Leviticus thus begins with the good news of the way for redeemed Israelites, who were still sinners, to find acceptance and experience fellowship with their holy God.\n\n\"As we will observe, sacrifice often, but not always, focuses on the blood of the victim. Some critical scholars speak of this as a magical understanding of sacrifice, and some evangelical readers of the Old Testament seem to have this idea also when they insist on the translation 'blood' rather than its symbolical referent, death. It is the death of the sacrificial victim that renders the rite effective, and the manipulation of the blood highlights the death that stands in the place of the sinner who offers it.\"\n\nWhereas both the offererâand in the case of birds the priestâcould slaughter the animal sacrifice (vv. 5, 14-15), only the priest could sprinkle its blood. The method of slaughtering was by slitting the throat.\n\n\"The animal should be killed by the offerer [v. 5], not by the priest, for it was not his duty in case of voluntary sacrifices; in later times, however, the office was generally performed by Levites.\"\n\n\"If a symbolic meaning of this locality [the north side of the altar, v. 11] is intended, it possibly relates to the north side being on one's left when facing east. [Ancient Near Easterners were East oriented.] If so, slaughtering the smaller ruminants may symbolize their powerlessness because one's left, in the OT, sometimes represents defeat (cf. Jer. 1:14; 4:6; Ezek. 1:4' 9:2; â¦).\"\n\nAnother explanation is that the north side was specified for practical reasons: the ash heap was on the east side, the laver on the west, and the ramp on the south. Still another view follows:\n\n\"Facing the ark of the covenant, the offerer and the priests would recognize the north side of the altar to be to the right of the symbolic presence of God. Traditionally, the right side is the place of honorâa view that continued into NT times (e.g., Mt 25:34; 26:64).\"\n\nNote several distinctives of this offering:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â It was a \"soothing aroma\" (or \"sweet savor\" AV, or \"sweet aroma\" NKJV, or \"soothing odour\" NEB, or \"pleasing odor\" NRSV, or \"pleasing aroma\" ESV, HCSB, NIV 1984 edition, TNIV, or \"a smell that pleases me\" CEV), vv. 9, 13, 17). God was \"happy\" (satisfied, propitiated) to receive this sacrifice, because it was an offering of worship as well as a payment for sin. It gave Him pleasure. The priests presented all three soothing aroma offerings on the bronze altar in the tabernacle courtyard. God saw the offerer as both a worshiper and a guilty sinner. The offering was to be without any blemish, which was also expected in the sin and guilt offerings. This indicated that the offerer was presenting the best to God, who is worthy of nothing less (vv. 3, 10).\n\n\"â¦ whatever speaks of Christ Himself must speak of perfection.\"\n\n\"Among the Egyptians, a minute inspection was made by the priest; and the bullock having been declared perfect, a certificate to that effect being fastened to its horns with wax, was sealed with his ring, and no other might be substituted. A similar process of examining the condition of the beasts brought as offerings, seems to have been adopted by the priests in Israel (John 6:27).\"\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â It was for acceptance (i.e., so that God would accept the offerer, vv. 3-4). This offering satisfied God's desire for the love of His redeemed creatures as well as His offended justice. It satisfied God by its wholenessâquantitatively and qualitatively. The Israelite worshiper offered a whole (healthy) and spotless (blemish- or defect-free) animal in place of himself. And, as a public offering, the priest offered it in place of the nation.\n\n\"The requirement that the animal be male [v. 3] was on the one hand related to the fact that these were of greater value than females, as was of course also the case in breeding. On the other hand, it was also based on the thought that, being physically stronger, they had more power.\"\n\n\"The Hebrew verb samak means more than a mere 'laying [his hand] on,' [v. 4] for it expresses a certain exertion of pressure as in leaning on or bracing oneself on, and thus as it were, entrusting oneself to. This samak therefore involved close contact, and through it the person presenting the offering gave expression to the fact that he could not do without the animal.\"\n\n\"The Hebrew verb kipper, which I have translated as 'make atonement [v. 4]' in accordance with the example of the Greek translation, actually means something different from what is expressed by the word atonement. If I understand it correctly, kipper contains the ideas of cleansing by means of sweeping away.\"\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â The offerer gave up a life on the altar (\"he shall slaughter the bull,\" v. 5). God has always claimed life as His own. In slaying this animal, the offerer was symbolically saying that he was giving the life that God had given him back to God, its rightful Owner. Giving one's life to God is not an act of great sacrifice. It is simply giving back to God what already belongs to Him. It is only one's \"reasonable service\" (Rom. 12:1, AV, NKJV, NET2).\n\nCutting the sacrificial animal in pieces (vv. 6, 8) made it appear as though it was part of a family meal. The animal was thus like a meal presented to God. Covenants were sealed with meals in the ancient Near East, so this procedure symbolized the participants in God's covenant with Israel sharing fellowship with each other. The pagans of that day offered food to their gods to energize them, but this was not the intent of the Israelites when they presented food to Yahweh.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â The animal perished completely, consumed by the fire on the altar (v. 9), except for the skin (\"hide\"), which went to the priest (7:8). This symbolized the comprehensive nature of the offerer's consecration to Godâhis or her total subjection to the LORD. One writer describe this as âthe extinction of the offererâs worldly values.â Perhaps God excluded the skin to focus attention on the internal elements. God deserves the surrender of the entire person, not just a part.\n\n\"In the overfed West we can easily fail to realize what was involved in offering an unblemished animal in sacrifice. Meat was a rare luxury in OT times for all but the very rich (cf. Nathan's parable, 2 Sam. 12:1-6). Yet even we might blanch if we saw a whole lamb or bull go up in smoke as a burnt offering. How much greater pangs must a poor Israelite have felt.\"\n\nThere were also some variations within this offering:\n\n1. The animals acceptable for this offering varied. Bulls (\"bullocks,\" AV), sheep, goats, turtledoves, and young doves (\"pigeons,\" NRSV, NET2, ESV, HCSB, AV, NKJV, NIV, NEB, CEV) were acceptable. Some commentators suggest that each type of animal bore a distinct characteristic shared by man, that made it an appropriate substitute (e.g., strong, foolish, flighty, etc.). The dove was the sacred animal of the fertility goddess, Ishtar-Astarte, so offering it would have been regarded as an abomination by Israel's pagan neighbors.\n\nGenerally, the higher the individual Israelite's responsibility before God (e.g., priests, rulers, common people, etc.), the larger and more expensive was the animal that he had to offer. People with greater responsibility would also have had more money, and therefore more ability to bring the more expensive sacrifices.\n\n\"It is observable that those creatures were chosen for sacrifice which were most mild and gentle, harmless and inoffensive, to typify the innocence and meekness that were in Christ, and to teach the innocence and meekness that should be in Christians.\"\n\n2. The butchering of the animals also varied. The offerers cut the bulls, lambs, and goats into four parts, but they did not do so with the birds. This difference at least reflects the practical need to divide the larger animals into more manageable pieces. Moreover, they washed the entrails and legs of the animals in water (vv. 9, 13). This washing probably symbolized the need for internal purity. They did not wash the birds, however. Perhaps they were regarded as already clean.\n\nThe offerer laid (Heb. samek) his hand on the animals, but not on the birds (cf. Isa. 59:16; Ezek. 24:2; 30:6; Amos 5:19). Laying on of hands often accompanied prayer (cf. 16:21; Deut. 21:6-9), suggesting that prayer accompanied sacrifice. The offerer personally slew the animals, but the priest slew the birds (vv. 5, 15). As noted above, in later periods of history, the priests slew all the animals.\n\n\"The bird â¦ offerings were, by and large, concessions to the poor (cf., e.g., Lev 5:7-10; 12:8; 14:21-32) and, therefore, not considered to be one of the primary categories of animal offerings.\"\n\n\"The fowls were always offered in pairs, and the reason why Moses ordered two turtledoves or two young pigeons, was not merely to suit the convenience of the offerer, but according as the latter was in season; for pigeons are sometimes quite hard and unfit for eating, at which time turtledoves are very good in Egypt and Palestine. The turtledoves are not restricted to any age because they are always good when they appear in those countries, being birds of passage; but the age of the pigeons is particularly marked that they might not be offered to God at times when they are rejected by men [Harmer].\"\n\nPerhaps the draining of the birds' blood on the side of the altar symbolized the covering of the whole altar with blood.\n\nIn summary, the burnt offering was an act of worship in which the Israelite offered to God a whole animal. The fire on the altar completely consumed the offered animal as a substitute for the offerer, and as a symbol of his total personal self-sacrifice and dedication to God. Burnt offerings were voluntary on the Israelite's part, as is self-sacrifice for the Christian (Rom. 6:12-13; 12:1-2; cf. Matt. 22:37; 1 Cor. 6:19).\n\n\"The burnt offering was the commonest of all the OT sacrifices. Its main function was to atone for man's sin by propitiating God's wrath. In the immolation [burning] of the animal, most commonly a lamb, God's judgment against human sin was symbolized and the animal suffered in man's place. The worshiper acknowledged his guilt and responsibility for his sins by pressing his hand on the animal's head and confessing his sin. The lamb was accepted as the ransom price for the guilty man [cf. Mark 10:45; Eph. 2:5; Heb. 7:27; 1 Pet. 1:18-19]. The daily use of the sacrifice in the worship of the temple and tabernacle was a constant reminder of man's sinfulness and God's holiness. So were its occasional usages after sickness, childbirth, and vows. In bringing a sacrifice a man acknowledged his sinfulness and guilt. He also publicly confessed his faith in the Lord, his thankfulness for past blessing, and his resolve to live according to God's holy will all the days of his life.\"\n\n\"It [the burnt offering] could serve as a votive [connected with a vow] or freewill offering (e.g., Lev 22:18-20), an accompaniment of prayer and supplication (e.g., 1 Sam 7:9-10), part of the regular daily, weekly, monthly, and festival cultic pattern (e.g., Num 28-29), or to make atonement either alone (e.g., Lev 1:4; 16:24) or in combination with the grain offering (e.g., Lev. 14:20) or sin offering (e.g., Lev 5:7; 9:7).\"\n\n\"The clearly stated purpose of the whole burnt offering was for atonement (lekapper in 1:4). But the way that this offering made atonement or expiation was in a slightly different way than the purification [sin] and reparation [guilt] offerings. It was a more general offering than either of them; it did not emphasize the removal of sin or guilt or change the worshiper's nature; but it made fellowship between sinful people and God possible â¦\"\n\nAs the Lamb of God, Christ offered His life as both an act of worship to God and a payment for sin (Luke 23:46; Eph. 5:2). His life, too, was spotless (John 8:46; 1 Pet. 2:22; Phil. 2:6, 8).\n\n\"The Burnt-offering typifies Christ's 'offering Himself without spot to God.' It foreshadows Christ on the Cross, not so much bearing sin as accomplishing the will of God. We are shown the perfection of Christ's offering of Himself, as God sees it.\"\n\nWe who are Christians, too, need to remember our need for daily forgiveness, to confess our sins, and to purpose to walk in God's ways (cf. 1 John 1:7-9).\n\n\"The LORD accepts with pleasure whoever comes into his presence by substitutionary atonement through the shedding of blood.\"\n\n2.Â Â Â Â The grain offering ch. 2\n\nThe grain (\"meat\" AV) offering was also an offering of worship that brought God pleasure. It evidently symbolized the sacrifice and commitment of one's person and works, himself and his possessions, to God, as well as the worshiper's willingness to keep the law (cf. Rom. 12:1-2; Phil. 4:18; Heb. 13:15-16). Anyone could present this offering: a man or a woman.\n\n\"The burnt and grain offerings together represent two basic elements of the offerer's concerns before God: to restore and maintain one's relationship with God and to express thanks and praise for God-given blessings â¦\"\n\n\"â¦ the burnt offering â¦ speaks of complete self-surrender, and the grain offering â¦ an acknowledgement of absolute dependence â¦\"\n\nA grain offering always followed the official daily burnt offerings (cf. Exod. 29:39-40; Num. 28:3-6), and it often accompanied a peace offering (cf. Num. 15:3-5; 2 Kings 16:13). It was only offered by itself on two occasions: as a priest's offering (Lev. 7:12), and in the ritual used to determine a wife's faithfulness or unfaithfulness to her husband (Num. 5:15). The grain offering was a type of tribute from a faithful worshiper to his divine overlord. The Hebrew word minha', here translated \"grain offering,\" also means \"tribute\" (cf. Gen. 32:13; 1 Kings 10:25; 2 Kings 8:8).\n\n\"God having granted forgiveness of sins through the burnt offering, the worshiper responded by giving to God some of the produce of his hands in cereal offering.\"\n\n\"The 'grain offering' â¦ generally accompanied a burnt or peace offering to supplement the meat with bread (the libation provided the drink; cf. Num 15:1-10), thus completing the food 'gift' to the LORD. It made atonement â¦ along with the burnt offering (e.g., Lev 14:20) or alone as a sin offering for the poor (Lev 5:11-13).\"\n\n\"Rabbinic tradition clearly regards the cereal offering as the poor man's burnt offering.\"\n\n\"â¦ the purpose of the minha' was to confirm and renew the covenantal relationship. I would like to propose 'the loyalty offering' as a translation for minha', since its purpose was to express one's allegiance to the Lord.\"\n\nThis offering was distinctive from the others in the following respects:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â It was a soothing aroma (vv. 2, 9). To God the grain offering was pleasing because it was an act of worship based on atonement for sin.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The offering itself was the product of human labor. A possible contrast between the burnt and grain offerings, is that one represented what man owes God, and the other what he owes his fellow man. However, it seems more likely that the contrast intended was primarily between the person of the offerer and his works. The animals offered in the burnt offering were God's creations, but the grain offered in the grain offering was the product of man's labor, since the grain was reaped and offered as a prepared dish.\n\nGod charged mankind with the responsibility of cultivating the earth (Gen. 1:29; cf. 9:4-6). Man cultivates the ground to provide for the needs of mankindâhis own needs and the needs of other people. The grain or flour, from which the \"staff of life\" comes, symbolized what God enabled man to produce. By offering this sacrifice, the offerer was saying that he viewed all the work that he did as an offering to the LORD.\n\nThe grain offering appears to have been acceptable only when offered along with the burnt offering, except on the two occasions mentioned above. This requirement taught that one's works were acceptable to God only when they accompanied the offerer's consecration of himself to God (cf. Gen. 4:3).\n\nThe materials used in this offering undoubtedly had significance to the Israelites. \"Fine flour\" (v. 1) baked into (unleavened) bread represented then, as now, the staff of life. The fine flour in view was wheat, not barley, which was half as expensive. The fact that the offerer had ground the flour fine probably emphasized the human toil represented by the offering.\n\nThe (olive) oil (v. 1) was a symbol of God's enabling Spirit, since it bound and transformed the flour into \"unleavened cakes.\" This consistency made it possible to offer the sacrifice as a finished dish rather than as a collection of ingredients.\n\n\"Oil was to them then in their food what butter is now to us.\"\n\nFrankincense (v. 1) was a very fragrant spice, but its aroma did not become evident until someone subjected it to fire. The oil and incense made the offering richer and more desirable, and therefore more pleasing to God.\n\nGod also specified salt for this offering (v. 13). Salt symbolized a covenant, in that nothing in antiquity could destroy salt, including fire and time (cf. Num. 18:19). Salt was also a symbol of friendship. Adding salt to an offering reminded the worshiper that he was in an eternal covenant relationship with his God.\n\n\"However, the very command to add salt betrays that one's allegiance to God is easily abandoned.\"\n\nGod specifically excluded honey and leaven from the recipe for the grain offering (v. 11). Some writers have suggested that these two ingredients represented, respectively, natural (earthly) sweetness and sin to the Israelites. Others believe that \"as blood is the life force of animals, leaven represented the life force of the vegetable kingdom.\" Most have felt that honey (fruit honey rather than bee honey ) and leaven were unacceptable because they cause fermentation, and fermentation suggested corruption.\n\n\"Some think the chief reason why these two things, leaven and honey, were forbidden, was because the Gentiles used them very much in their sacrifices, and God's people must not learn or use the way of the heathen. Some make this application of this double prohibition: leaven signifies grief and sadness of spirit (Ps. lxxiii. 21), My heart was leavened; honey signifies sensual pleasure and mirth.\"\n\nThis view of the reason for the prohibition is probably incorrect, because the Gentiles also used flour, incense, oil, and salt in their sacrifices.\n\nA drink offering accompanied every grain offering. The wine used was poured out at the base of the altar (Num. 15:1-10).\n\n3. Another distinction was that the priest did not offer the entire grain offering on the altar. He placed only a handful of the uncooked grain or cooked bread (\"its memorial portion,\" v. 9) on the bronze altar and burned it. The priest ate the rest (v. 10). The offerer cooked the dough at home, first, and then offered it as unleavened bread (like a pita or tortilla) to the LORD âby presenting it in this form to the priestârather than as batter (vv. 4, 5, 7). Not every grain offering was presented as \"unleavened cakes\" (or \"wafers\" NRSV, HCSB, NKJV, NIV, CEV, or \"loaves\" NET2, ESV, TNIV), however.\n\n\"Another distinction between the raw and cooked cereal offerings is that the former is distributed to the entire priestly corps, while the latter is assigned to the officiating priest (7:9-10).\"\n\nHumankind, symbolized by the priest, derived most of the benefit of this offering. This was appropriate, since the offering represented man's work for his fellow man. The offerer received none of this sacrifice for himself. This too was obviously appropriate.\n\n\"The idea of a memorial portion given to God goes beyond a simple reminding. The verb often carries the nuance of beginning to act on the basis of what is remembered. The 'memorial portion' thus reminded or prompted worshipers to live according to the covenant obligations, that is, to live as if all they had truly come from the LORD; and it prompted or motivated the LORD to honor and bless those who offered this dedication.\"\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Finally, the sacrifice was to the LORD (v. 1). Though it fed the priests, the offerer did not offer it for the priests but for God (cf. Eph. 6:7; Col. 3:23-24).\n\nGod permitted various kinds of grain offerings: baked (v. 4), grilled (v. 5), fried, (v. 7), and roasted (v. 14). These constituted the variations in preparing this offering. A griddle (v. 5) had no lid, whereas a pan (v. 7) did. If this offering was public, it usually took the form of first fruits (v. 12), but if it was private, an Israelite could bring it to the tabernacle whenever he desired to do so. The grain in view in verse 14 was early barley, in contrast to the wheat mentioned in the preceding verses of this chapter. The English translators have rendered the Hebrew word for this early barley as \"grits\" (NASB 1971 ed.), \"green ears of corn\" (AV), \"green heads of grain\" (NKJV), \"crushed kernels\" (HCSB), \"crushed new grain\" (ESV, cf. NEB), \"crushed bits of fresh grain\" (NET2), and \"fresh ears\" (NRSV). In short, they were crushed heads of green barley.\n\nChrist fulfilled the requirements of this sacrifice, too (John 8:29). The fine flour suggests the perfection of His personality made perfect through suffering. The oil suggests the Holy Spirit's presence in His life, the frankincense the fragrance of His life brought out by the fires of testing, and the salt the incorruptibility of His character. Honey, representing natural sweetness that sours, and leaven, which often represents sin and evil in Scripture, picture what was absent from His nature.\n\n\"The Meal-offering (not 'meat,' as in A.V.) exhibits typically the perfect manhood of Christ. The emphasis here is on the life which was offered. It sets forth the perfection of character which gave the offering its unspeakable value.\"\n\n\"The LORD expects his people to offer themselves and the best they have as a token of their dedication and gratitude [cf. Col. 3:23; Phil. 4:18].\"\n\n3.Â Â Â Â The peace offering ch. 3\n\nThe peace (\"fellowship\" NIV, TNIV, HCSB, or \"well-being\" NRSV, or \"shared\" NEB) offering is the third voluntary sacrifice of worship. It represented the personal fellowship between God and each Israelite person, and between believing Israelites, that resulted from the relationship that God had established with the redeemed individual (cf. Rom. 5:1). Peace and, consequently, fellowship resulted from redemption, and this offering of worship highlighted and celebrated those blessings from God. It did not obtain them.\n\n\"The burnt offering symbolized the giving of everything back to God, who had given it in the first place, and the reconciliation between God and the sinner. The fellowship offering symbolized participation with God in the sacrifice as God returned part of the offering to the offerer.\"\n\nA feeling of well-being prompted the giving of this offering. This was an optional sacrifice; an Israelite could bring it if and when he desired. Thus it was not one of the offerings that the priests presented daily in the tabernacle, though God did order its presentation at the Feast of Pentecost (also called Harvest and Weeks; 23:19). Because it was voluntary, its offering became a festive occasion.\n\n\"The word peace has a different shade of meaning in the Hebrew from what it has in our language. With us it suggests most naturally and legitimately the idea of reconciliation, the bringing into concord contending parties,âan idea which is more properly to be associated with the effects of the stated burnt-offering, or the occasional sin and trespass-offering. In the Hebrew the import of prosperity, of welfare, is prominant [sic] to the enjoyment of the petition of which this offering was especially appointed. The idea of grateful acknowledgment therefore is the leading idea which it is calculated to suggest.\"\n\nThere were three different kinds of peace offerings: One was a thanksgiving offering, in which an Israelite expressed thanks for a particular blessing (7:12-15). Another was a votive offering, that the Israelites could offer after an acute experience of distressâor joyâthat had elicited a vow from them (cf. Jon. 2:9). The third was a freewill offering, that the Israelite could offer as an expression of gratitude to God, without reference to any particular blessing (7:16-18).\n\nThere were two major distinctives of this offering:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â It was a soothing aroma (v. 16).\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â All the participants fed together on this sacrifice: the offerer, the priest, and God (symbolically). Eating together had great significance in the ancient Near East. People who ate a ritual meal together often committed themselves to one another in a strong bond of loyalty (cf. 1 Sam. 9:22-24; John 13â16). Eating together also symbolized fellowship, as it still does today. In this sacrifice, the offerer got to eat part of the same offering he had made to God. In the burnt offering, God got the whole sacrifice, except for the skin if the offering was a bull (7:8). In the grain offering, God and the priest shared the sacrifice. However, in the peace offering, all three participants shared the roasted animal. Even the priest's children ate part of this offering, but they had to be ceremonially clean to do so (7:20; cf. 1 Cor. 11:28). It was common, among Israel's neighbor nations, for the god, the priests, and the worshippers to share certain offerings.\n\n\"A libation [drink] offering (nesek) accompanied burnt and fellowship offerings. The priest's portion of the fellowship offering was symbolically 'waved' before the Lord as his portion and called the 'wave offering' (tenupa). Certain portions of it (namely, one of the cakes and the right thigh) were given as a 'contribution' from the offerer to the priests, the so-called 'heave offering' (teruma).\"\n\nThe wave offerings were not waved from side to side but toward the altar and back. The Israelites were not to eat the fat of this sacrifice, but to offer it to the LORD on the altar (vv. 9-10). The fat (or suet) refers \"to the layers of fat beneath the surface of the animal's skin and around its organs, which can be peeled off, in contrast to the fat that is inextricably entwined in the musculature â¦\" This restriction may have symbolized that God was worthy of the best, since the ancients regarded the fat of an animal as its best part (e.g., \"the fat of the land\" means the best part of the land).\n\n\"â¦ the fat was the tastiest item to the Near Eastern palate, but also â¦ it was of decisive importance for the life of the animal. It protected the vital parts of the body, and insofar as it functioned as an energy reserve, it also maintained the animal's life.\"\n\nAnother explanation, is that since the Old Testament used the kidneys and entrails to represent the seat of human emotions (cf. Job 19:27; Ps. 16:7; Jer. 4:14; 12:2), these parts represented the worshiper's best and deepest emotions. This view finds support in the fact that Israelites offered the peace offering in intrinsically emotional situations, when they thanked God or requested from Him. The pagan peoples that surrounded Israel used the livers of animals to predict the future. Perhaps God prescribed burning the lobe of the liver to discourage the Israelites from doing this (vv. 10, 15).\n\nStill another view follows:\n\n\"â¦ fat symbolizes something the Lord detests. Therefore the offerer must completely destroy it by fire and, of course, its destruction is inevitably pleasing to the Lord. The burning of fat symbolizes the destruction of detestable things within a human's inner being.\"\n\n\"The tail of the Palestinian broad-tailed sheep is almost entirely fat and can weigh more than 16 pounds. This explains its special mention in the regulations for offering the fat of the sheep [v. 9].\"\n\n\"The slain-offering [peace offering], which culminated in the sacrificial meal, served as a seal of the covenant fellowship, and represented the living fellowship of man with God.\"\n\nThese varieties are significant:\n\n1. There were several types of animals that God permitted. The options were similar to the burnt offering's, but were fewer. Bulls, lambs, and goats were acceptable. Female animals were also acceptable for peace offerings, so there were more possibilities of these sacrificial animals than with the burnt offering. Female animals may have been permitted because this offering was to provide meat for the offerers, and limiting it to males would greatly reduce the number of animals available.\n\n\"â¦ it may be that two types of human beings (sheep and goats) are seen before God the judge (bull): helpless and dependent sheep, and relatively strong and stubborn goats.\"\n\nBirds were not acceptable as peace offerings, perhaps because their smaller size was not conducive to dividing them among God, the priest, and the offerer. Or they may have been excluded because they did not have enough fat to burn on the altar.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The Israelites could present this offering for any of three possible reasons: as a thanksgiving offering, as a freewill offering, or to fulfill a vow (i.e., a votive offering; cf. 7:12-16).\n\nWhenever the Israelites offered thousands of sacrifices at one time, they were usually peace offerings. They ate only a part of what they offered on these occasions.\n\nChrist is the peace of believers, because of His sacrifice on the cross (Eph. 2:14). All of the animals used in this offering have been thought by some to represent different aspects of the person of Christ: Bulls represent Christ as our burden-bearer. The lamb stands for Him as our perfect sacrifice, and the goat suggests Him as the One who takes away sin. The inward parts of these animals that were offered suggest that God sees the inner parts of Christ as acceptable to Him.\n\nChrist's death made peace and fellowship possible with God (Rom. 5:1; Col. 1:20-22). Christ's death also made peace and fellowship possible with our fellow men (Eph. 2:14).\n\n\"The Peace-offering speaks of restored communion, resulting from the perfect satisfaction rendered in Christ. God is propitiated. Man is reconciled. There is peace.\"\n\n\"Those who surrender their hearts to God and come before him on the basis of the shed blood of the sacrifice may celebrate being at peace with God (in a communal meal) [cf. 1 Thess. 5:16-18].\"\n\nThere are several similarities between this offering and the Lord's Supper: Both celebrations commemorate a covenant, both involve rededication to God, and both feature blood.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â The sin offering 4:1â5:13\n\nThe importance of this offering can be seen in the amount of space in the text that is devoted to explaining it: 35 verses. The burnt offering just occupies 17 verses, the grain offering 16 verses, the peace offering 17 verses, and the guilt offering 19 verses.\n\nThe sin offering was a very important offering, since it was to be offered before any of the others. It also played a key role on the Day of Atonement. Ancient Near Easterners offered certain offerings before God incorporated these into the Mosaic Law. Moses previously mentioned burnt offerings in Genesis 12:7; 13:4, 18; 22; 26:25; 33:20; and 35:1-7, and peace offerings in Genesis 31:54 and 46:1. However, the sin and guilt offerings were apparently new when God gave these instructions at Mt. Sinai.\n\nThey \"â¦ were altogether unknown before the economy of the Sinaitic law.\"\n\n\"â¦ the first three offerings are stylistically associated, and the remaining ones are derivatives of these.\"\n\nThe structure of the chapters dealing with the sin and guilt offerings differs from that describing the burnt, grain, and peace offerings. Also, the opening words of this chapter introduce a new section.\n\nThese differences help us appreciate the fact that these two offerings were in a class by themselves, while at the same time sharing some of the similarities of the first three. The sacrificial victim was the organizing principle in chapters 1â3, with revelation about the more valuable animals leading off each chapter. But in 4:1â6:7, the most important factor is the type of sin that called for sacrifice, and the status of the sinner is a secondary factor. In contrast to the preceding offerings, which were voluntary, these were mandatory.\n\nThe first three offerings, the soothing aroma offerings, speak typically of the person of Christ, and the last two offerings, the non-soothing aroma offerings, speak of His work.\n\n\"Where the burnt offering leaves off, the sin offering begins. The burnt offering tells who Christ is; the sin offering tells what Christ did. In the burnt offering Christ meets the demands of God's high and holy standard; in the sin offering Christ meets the deep and desperate needs of man. In the burnt offering we see the preciousness of Christ; in the sin offering we see the hatefulness of sin. The burnt offering was a voluntary offering; the sin offering was commanded. The burnt offering ascended; the sin offering was poured out. The one went up and the other went down.\"\n\n\"Whereas the main issue in the burnt, grain, and fellowship offerings was the proper procedure to be followed, the main issue in the discussion in the sin and guilt offerings is the occasion that would require these sacrifices.\"\n\nThere were two types of occasions that called for the sin offering: unwitting or inadvertent sins, caused by negligence or ignorance (ch. 4), and sins of omission (5:1-13). According to Kiuchi, this whole section deals with self-hiding (cf. Gen. 3:8). We could subdivide this section on the sin offering as follows:\n\nInadvertent sin ch. 4\n\nIntroduction 4:1-2\n\nBlood sprinkled in the holy place 4:3-21\n\nFor the high priest 4:3-12\n\nFor the congregation 4:13-21\n\nBlood smeared on the bronze altar 4:22-35\n\nFor the tribal leader 4:22-26\n\nFor the ordinary Israelite offering a goat 4:27-31\n\nFor the ordinary Israelite offering a lamb 4:32-35\n\nSins of omission 5:1-13\n\nA lamb or goat offering 5:1-6\n\nA bird offering 5:7-10\n\nA flour offering 5:11-13\n\nThe sin offering (Heb. hatta't) dealt with unintentional sins, as opposed to high-handed sins (cf. Num. 15:22-31). The title of this offering as the \"sin offering\" is a bit misleading, since the burnt, peace, and guilt offerings also atoned for sin. However, the primary focus of this offering was on sin.\n\n\"Propitiation of divine anger â¦ is an important element in the burnt offering. Restitution â¦ is the key idea in the reparation [guilt] offering. Purification is the main element in the purification [sin] sacrifice. Sin not only angers God and deprives him of his due, it also makes his sanctuary unclean. A holy God cannot dwell amid uncleanness. The purification offering purifies the place of worship, so that God may be present among his people.\"\n\n\"The advantage of freeing the hatta't from the theologically foreign notion of sin and restoring to it its pristine meaning of purification is that now it is possible to see this sacrifice in its true ancient Near Eastern setting. Israel was part of a cultic continuum which abounded in purifications both of persons and of buildings, especially sanctuaries.\"\n\n\"The root ht' for 'sin' occurs 595 times in the Old Testament, and Leviticus, with 116 attestations, has far more occurrences than any other Old Testament book. This section (fifty-three attestations) is the heaviest concentration of the discussion of 'sin' in the Bible.\"\n\nLike the burnt and grain offerings, this one was to be offered frequently, but the Israelites offered it less frequently as time went on (cf. Num. 28â29). The most important feature of this offering was the sprinkling of the blood of the sacrifice (cf. 1 John 2:1-2).\n\n\"Sevenfold sprinkling [v. 6] symbolizes its completeness.\"\n\n\"The law reminds people of sinânot just the major sins, but sins that are often overlooked, like not keeping one's word, failing to do what is right, or living in a defiled world and never considering what that does to the spiritual life.\"\n\nThree notable distinctives stand out in these instructions:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â This offering was not a \"soothing aroma.\" It was for expiation, namely, to make amends. The offerer ritually transferred the guilt of his sin to the sacrificial animal (cf. Isa. 53:5; 1 Pet. 2:24). The animal had to be without defect (cf. 1 Pet. 2:22). The offerer executed God's judgment for sin on the sacrificial substitute by slaying it. In every sin offering, an innocent substitute took the sinner's place (cf. 2 Cor. 5:21).\n\nA problem arises in verse 31, where Moses referred to this non-soothing offering as a soothing aroma. One commentator suggested that a copyist accidentally transferred the statement from the discussions of the peace offering in chapter 3. Another believed it was the burning of the fatty tissue, not the whole sin offering, that was the soothing aroma. This second explanation seems more probable.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Smearing blood on the horns of the altar of incense in the holy place symbolized purifying the whole sanctuary (vv. 5-7). The horns represented the powerful divine force behind the altar. The priest burned the skin, and other parts that he did not eat or burn on the altar, outside the camp (v. 11). This may have been to emphasize the exceeding sinfulness of sin. He burned the fat on the altar over a wood fire, which produced the cleanest flame. God evidently regarded the fat as the best part of the animal. The priest ate most of the meat of the roasted animal (6:26; cf. Heb. 13:11-13; Matt. 27:46).\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â This offering dealt with most unintentionally committed sins (vv. 2, 13, 22, 27; 5:2-4; cf. 5:14-16). These oversights demonstrated a sinful nature. Even when people do not intend to sin, they sometimes do so, because it is our nature to sin. Any and every sin committed unwittingly pointed to the need for this offering.\n\nGod permitted several varieties of this offering:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â The LORD permitted the offering of less expensive animals by poorer people, or even flour by the very poor (5:11). However, everyone had to offer this sacrifice, since everyone committed unintentional sins. A flour offering did not express the cost of expiation as well as a blood sacrifice did, but God graciously permitted it for the very poor.\n\n\"It is not the greatness of the gift [or sacrifice] but the heart of the giver, which God regards.\"\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â People with higher social and economic status had to bring more expensive sacrifices, illustrating the principle that privilege increases responsibility. Their sins had a more disruptive effect on God's relationship with His people. Evidently any sin that the high priest committed, in private or in his public capacity, brought guilt on the whole nation (cf. 10:6; 22:16).\n\n\"On the one hand this arrangement says that the more influential the person, the costlier the offering that had to be broughtâthe sins of the prominent were more defiling. But on the other hand it is also saying that the way was open to all. The poor were not excluded because their sins were not so defiling or because they had no animals. God made provision for everyone to find cleansing for reentry into the sanctuary.\"\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â God allowed procedural differences as well (e.g., where the priest sprinkled the blood, how he burned the fat, etc.), depending on the offerer's position in the nation.\n\nThe sin offering only covered sins committed unintentionally. This category included sins done by mistake, in error, through oversight or ignorance, through lack of consideration, negligence, or by carelessness. That is, this sacrifice covered sins that sprang from the weakness of the flesh (cf. Num. 15:27-29; Gal. 6:3).\n\nIt did not cover sins committed with a \"high hand,\" namely, in haughty, defiant rebellion against God. Such a sinner was \"cut off from among his people\" (Num. 15:30-31). Many reliable commentators interpret this phrase to mean the offender suffered death. Others hold that it may or may not have involved death, depending on the situation. Not all deliberate sins were high handed, howeverâonly those committed in defiant rebellion against God.\n\n\"A third class of offences were those of a somewhat deeper dye [than unintentional sins, but not high handed]âcertain open and wilful [sic] injuries and violatioas [sic] of law, such as thefts, violence, false-swearing, deceit and fraud.\"\n\n\"The sin offerings did not relate to sin or sinfulness in general, but to particular manifestations of sin, to certain distinct actions performed by individuals, or by the whole congregation.\"\n\nThe meaning of \"congregation\" (v. 13) is somewhat obscure. Sometimes the whole nation seems to be in view (e.g., Exod. 12:3, 6; 17:1; Num. 20:1-2). If this is the meaning in verses 13-21, as seems to be the case, the \"congregation\" is synonymous with the \"assembly.\" However, in other passages, \"congregation\" seems to describe a representative group within the nation (e.g., Exod. 16:1-2, 9; Num. 8:20; 15:33-36; 27:2; 35:12, 24-25; 1 Sam. 14:32). The context usually helps determine the meaning.\n\nNote the repeated promises that this offering would \"make atonement\" for these sins (4:26, 31, 35; 5:10). Scholars have understood the meaning of \"atonement,\" from the Hebrew root kpr, in three different ways: Most of them have believed that it is related to the Arabic cognate meaning \"to cover.\" A second possibility is that the verb means \"to wipe or purge.\" A third view is that the verb means \"to ransom.\"\n\nProbably the second and third views are best, since they go back to the Hebrew root, rather than to the Arabic cognate. Both of these interpretations are valid, depending on the context. However, the idea of \"covering\" is also frequently present. Atonement makes amends for offenses against God.\n\n\"â¦ one hears it being taught that sins in the Old Testament were never fully forgiven or atoned, but merely covered over as a temporary measure. But Scripture says that atonement was made and they were forgiven (Lev. 4:26, 31, 35; Ps. 130:4; 32:1-2 â¦).\"\n\nMost commentators understand this sacrifice as the principal expiatory (atoning) offering in ancient Israel. Wenham argued that textual evidence points to the burnt offering as the principal atoning sacrifice in Israel.\n\n\"To sprinkle the blood seven times before the veil secured God's relationship with the offender. To put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of incense, the place of prayer, was to restore the privilege of worship to the offender. Our acceptance by God and our worship of Him are dependent upon the blood of Jesus Christ. â¦ The remainder of the blood was poured out at the bottom of the brazen altar. This satisfied the conscience of the sinner and removed the guilt complex.\"\n\nThe idea that sin pollutes and defiles seems very strange in the modern world. Nevertheless, Leviticus reveals that sins pollute the place where they take place (cf. 18:24-30; Deut. 21:1-9), as well as people. God wanted people to realize that sin is powerful in its defiling and deadly effects, that it almost has a life of its own.\n\nMilgrom provided a helpful diagram that illustrates the three types of polluting agents that this chapter presents and their consequences: Involuntary sin committed by an individual polluted the outer altar, involuntary sin committed by the community polluted the inner altar, and brazen and unrepented offenses polluted the ark of the covenant.\n\nThe relationship of 5:1-13 to chapter 4 is a problem. I have suggested one solution above: These sin offerings deal with sins of omission, and certain deliberate sins, rather than inadvertent sin. Noordtzij believed these verses describe sins arising from negligence or thoughtlessness, and those in chapter 4 involve unintentional transgressions. McGee believed that 5:1-13 deals with the guilt offering. Milgrom suggested another explanation:\n\n\"Modern critics tend to regard 5:1-13 as the 'poor man's' offering, the option given to the offender of 4:27-35 who cannot afford the prescribed flock animal. This interpretation, however, is beset with stylistic and contextual difficulties: â¦ My own hypothesis is herewith submitted: The graduated hatta't [sin offering] is a distinct sacrificial category. It is enjoined for failure or inability to cleanse impurity upon its occurrence. This 'the sin of which he is guilty' (5:6, 10, 13) is not the contraction of impurity but its prolongation.\"\n\n\"â¦ someone has contracted impurity knowingly, even deliberately, but has forgotten to purify himself within the prescribed time limits. If he subsequently remembers and feels guilt, he must confess his wrong and expiate it by a purification offering (v. 5), thereby purging the sanctuary of the pollution caused by his prolonged impurity. Yet because he has not violated a prohibitive commandment, the sine qua non of the hatta't, the latter is scaled according to his economic circumstances.\"\n\nMatthew Henry was one commentator who understood this section of instructions (5:1-13) as dealing with the cost of forgiveness:\n\n\"â¦ the expense of the sin-offering was brought lower than that of any other offering, to teach us that no man's poverty shall ever be a bar in the way of his pardon. No man shall say that he had not wherewithal to bear the charges of a journey to heaven.\"\n\nThe relationship of 5:1-13 to chapter 4 continues to be the subject of some debate. Wenham summarized this section well:\n\n\"The purification [sin] offering dealt with the pollution caused by sin. If sin polluted the land, it defiled particularly the house where God dwelt. The seriousness of pollution depended on the seriousness of the sin, which in turn related to the status of the sinner. If a private citizen sinned, his action polluted the sanctuary only to a limited extent. Therefore the blood of the purification offering was only smeared on the horns of the altar of burnt sacrifice. If, however, the whole nation sinned or the holiest member of the nation, the high priest, sinned, this was more serious. The blood had to be taken inside the tabernacle and sprinkled on the veil and the altar of incense. Finally over the period of a year the sins of the nation could accumulate to such an extent that they polluted even the holy of holies, where God dwelt. If he was to continue to dwell among his people, this too had to be cleansed in the annual day of atonement ceremony (see Lev. 16).\"\n\nUnder the New Covenant, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses the believer from all sin (cf. Heb. 9â10; 1 Pet. 1:2; 1 John 1:7; Rev. 7:14). Thus this offering is now obsolete for the Christian. However, sin in the believer's life can grieve the indwelling Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:30). Furthermore, the New Testament reminds us that judgment is still proportionate to responsibility (cf. Luke 12:48; James 3:1). For Christians, confession is a prerequisite to cleansing for fellowship (1 John 1:9), even though Christ's death has brought purification from sin's defilement and condemnation. Confession of particular sins also had to accompany the sin offerings in Israel (5:5).\n\n\"God will restore the sinner who appeals to him for forgiveness on the basis of the purifying blood of the sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Anyone who becomes aware of obligations left undone or impure contacts left unpurified must make confession and find forgiveness through God's provision of atonement.\"\n\nChrist died as the final sin offering. He was without flaw, sinless (1 Pet. 2:22; 2 Cor. 5:21). He was sinful mankind's Substitute (Isa. 53:6; 1 Pet. 2:24). He died outside the camp (Heb. 13:11-13). And His Father forsook Him for our sake (Matt. 27:47).\n\n\"â¦ the Sin-offering typifies Christ as Sinbearerâ'made sin for us' (2 Cor. v. 21) â¦\"\n\n5.Â Â Â Â The guilt offering 5:14â6:7\n\nThe structure of 4:1â6:7 indicates that this offering has a close relationship to the sin offering.\n\n\"â¦ the difference between the two offerings lies in the degree of self-hiding.\"\n\nThe guilt (or \"trespass\" AV, NKJV, or \"restitution\" HCSB) offering removed the guilt of certain sins that involved trespassing against God. Trespassing means going beyond the limits of what is right. The Hebrew word 'asham, translated \"guilt,\" also means \"reparation\" (making amends). It may be helpful to think of this offering as a reparation or a compensation to repay God, since other sacrifices also deal with guilt.\n\n\"Guilt in the biblical sense is not just a feeling but a condition. There may be known transgressions that bring feelings of guilt, but there is also the condition of guilt before God, caused by sins known or unknown. Sometimes a hardened sinner has few feelings of guilt when he is the most guilty.\"\n\nThis section is divisible into two parts: the guilt offering for unintended sin (5:14-19), and the guilt offering for deliberate sin (6:1-7). There is a further distinction within 5:14-19, between trespasses that someone committed with sure knowledge of his guilt (5:14-16), and those that someone committed with only suspected knowledge of his guilt (5:17-19).\n\n\"From all these cases it is perfectly evident, that the idea of satisfaction for a right, which had been violated but was about to be restored or recovered, lay at the foundation of the trespass offering, and the ritual also points to this.\"\n\nThe identity of the \"holy things\" (v. 15) is problematic. The phrase evidently refers to anything dedicated to God by the Israelites, including the tabernacle, its furnishings, the offerings, houses, lands, and tithes of the people (cf. ch. 27). Violating these holy things would have involved eating holy food (cf. 22:14), taking (stealing or even moving) dedicated things from their rightful places, and perhaps failing to fulfill a dedicatory vow, or failing to pay a tithe.\n\nThe situation described in verses 17-19 evidently involved an instance of suspected trespass against sacred property. Someone suspected that he had sinned but did not know exactly how. So this sacrifice pacified some oversensitive Israelite consciences. Stealing sacred property was one of the most dreaded sins in antiquity.\n\nThe third type of offense (6:1-7) involved not only stealing property, but lying about it when confronted. The real offense was not just the taking of the property, but trespassing against God's holy name by swearing falsely about one's innocence.\n\n\"While the first two cases [5:14-16 and 17-19] are inadvertent, the third [6:1-7] is no doubt deliberate.\"\n\n\"It seems likely that atonement for deliberate sins was possible where there was evidence of true repentance, demonstrated by remorse (feeling guilty), full restitution (v. 23 [4] [sic 6:4]), and confession of sin (cf. Num. 5:6-8).\"\n\nThe major distinctives of this offering were these:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â It was not a \"soothing aroma\" offering.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The Israelites were to offer it when they had wronged someoneâeither God alone (5:15, 17) or both God and man (6:2). Every trespass against one's neighbor involved a trespass against God, but not every trespass against God involved a trespass against one's neighbor (cf. Ps. 51:1-4). Even though the offender may not have been aware of his trespass, he was still guilty. When he became aware of his sin, or even just suspected his guilt, he needed to bring this offering. This repentance reduced the guilt of the crime to that of an involuntary act.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â The offending Israelite had to pay \"restitution\" to the injured party in some cases (5:16; 6:5). The guilty party had to restore whatever the victim of his sin had lost.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â In addition to restitution, the offender had to add 20 percent (\"add to it a fifth part\"; 5:16; cf. 6:5). This policy also applied generally in the ancient Near East, outside Israel, in some cases (cf. Gen. 47:26). God considered the \"fifth part\" to be a debt the offender owed because of his offense, not a gift to the victim. The victim ended up better off, in one sense, than he was before the offense. Reparation is evidence of true repentance (cf. Matt. 3:8; 5:23-24; Luke 19:8-9).\n\nThere is much less description of the ritual involved in presenting this offering compared to the others (cf. 7:1-7).\n\nThe only significant variations in this offering were that, for an animal sacrifice, only a ram or a male lamb was acceptable (cf. 5:14-19; 14:12-20; 19:21-22; Num. 6:12). Evidently if a person could not bring a ram or a lamb, he could substitute the value of the animal in silver. There were more options in most of the other sacrifices.\n\n\"The reparation offering thus demonstrates that there is another aspect of sin that is not covered by the other sacrifices. It is that of satisfaction or compensation. If the burnt offering brings reconciliation between God and man, the purification or sin offering brings purification, while the reparation offering brings satisfaction through paying for the sin.\n\n\"The sacrificial system therefore presents different models or analogies to describe the effects of sin and the way of remedying them. The burnt offering uses a personal picture: of man the guilty sinner who deserves to die for his sin and of the animal dying in his place. God accepts the animal as a ransom for man. The sin offering uses a medical model: sin makes the world so dirty that God can no longer dwell there. The blood of the animal disinfects the sanctuary in order that God may continue to be present with his people. The reparation offering presents a commercial picture of sin. Sin is a debt which man incurs against God. The debt is paid through the offered animal.\"\n\nThese various models help clarify why sin is so bad. We who are Christians do not need to try to compensate God for our offenses against Him, since He has accepted the sacrifice of Jesus Christ as full payment for our debt (cf. 2 Cor. 5:19; Eph. 2:1, 4-5; Col. 2:13). Nevertheless, we have a responsibility to recompense other people against whom we trespass (cf. Matt. 5:23-24; 6:12).\n\n\"Anyone who violates the covenant by defrauding the LORD or another person must confess the sin and make full restitution in order to find full forgiveness and restoration.\"\n\nChrist fulfilled this sacrifice too (2 Cor. 5:19; Col. 2:13).\n\n\"â¦ the Trespass-offering speaks of sins (plural), and typifies Christ as Expiator, making restitution for the injury caused by our wrong-doing.\n\n\"And now observe the order of these offerings. In our study of the Tabernacle we saw that the furniture of the Tabernacle is given in the reverse order of human approach. God begins with the Ark in the Holy of Holies, moving outward from Himself toward man. The same order is followed in these Levitical offerings. God begins with the Burnt-offering and ends with the Trespass-offering. He leaves off where we begin. If we take these offerings in their reverse order, therefore, they exactly correspond with the order of our spiritual apprehension of Christ.\n\n\"When we first come, as awakened and believing sinners, to the Cross, the first thing we see in it (answering to our first-felt need) is forgiveness for our many trespasses. But scarcely have we begun to rejoice in the forgiveness of our sins before we realize that there is a further and deeper need, namely, sin in our nature. This further need is met by a deeper insight into the meaning of the Cross. Christ not only 'died for our sins'; He bore our sin, as typified in the Sin-offering. It is then, when we realize that both sins and sin have been dealt with in the Cross, that we enter into wonderful peace with God, as set forth in the Peace-offering. Then, still further, we find rest and joy and complete acceptance with God in the glorious perfections of Christ as typified in the Meal-offering; while more and more we come into fellowship with God through the fullness of that one perfect Offering to God on our behalf which is set forth in the Burnt-offering. Is there not wonderful Divine design in all this?\"\n\n6.Â Â Â Â Instructions for the priests concerning the offerings 6:8â7:38\n\nThis section reviews the offerings from the priests' point of view, though 7:11-36 addresses the ordinary Israelite.\n\n\"This section [6:8â7:10], together with 7:11-38, deals with various regulations relating to the later stages of the rituals given in Lev. 1â6:7, with a view to safeguarding holy things â¦\"\n\n\"The five basic sacrifices are â¦ introduced twice, each sacrifice being treated both in the main section addressed to the people [1:1â6:7] and in the supplementary section addressed to the priests [6:8â7:38].\"\n\nThe main theme of this section is who may eat what parts of the offerings and where they may be eaten. The particular \"law\" involved (cf. 6:9, 14, 25; 7:1, 11, 37) has to do with the rites that God prescribed for handling these sacrifices. Generally only the priests could eat the sacrifices, but the offerers could eat part of the peace offering. In this section, frequency of offering determines the order of the material. The regular daily burnt and grain offerings come first, then the less frequent sin (purification) offering, then the occasional guilt (restitution) offering, and finally the optional peace (fellowship) offering.\n\n\"To lead the congregation in corporate worship is both a great privilege and an enormous responsibility. In the following passages something of the responsibility concerning the ritual is laid out for the priests.\"\n\n\"To bring a person closer to God is the"
