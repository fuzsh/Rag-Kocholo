        "text": "*** It has been brought to my attention by someone that while my site lists the video formats, it does not list whether or not if the videos come with the smalls. I apologize if this confused and/or disappointed anyone. I have seen many trading sites over the years and not every site lists smalls or formats for that matter. So I assumed listing the small files were optional. So just to be clear moving forward, all of the videos on here do not have smalls. I have not received them all the time, and when I do I usually don't keep them because I have no personal use for them and don't want to take up extra space on my computer with them. I understand that this may upset some people, but it is a personal choice. And many people have told me that if they want a video bad enough, having the smalls does not matter a great deal. So unless it is listed, just know that you will not be getting smalls, just the video files. If you want smalls of certain videos, you are free to contact me and I may be able to refer you to a site that does have them.\n\n​London\n\nColm Wilkinson, Sarah Brightman, Clive Carter\n\n1985; Sydmonton Workshop\n\nHorrifying quality - black and white with lots of green lines running through it; lots of generation loss. Sound is decent, though. Act 1 only, lots of old lyrics, and very interesting to see the show in its first incarnation. MP4.\n\nMichael Crawford, Rebecca Caine, Steve Barton\n\n1987; London\n\nHighlights. Extremely difficult to make out anything other than the figures of people; black-and-white image and very heavy generation loss. VOB.\n\nDave Willetts, Jan Hartley-Morris, Michael Cormick\n\n1988; London\n\nClearer than the Rebecca Caine video above, but there's a lot of generation loss and tons of washout and color bleeding. Dave Willetts and Jan Hartley-Morris are both very lovely, old school actors. MP4.\n\nDave Willetts, Jan Hartley-Morris, Michael Cormick\n\n1988; London\n\nFrom the same show as above, but it is a little clearer. The trader told me this copy was gotten directly from the master tape, so it has basically the original quality of the video versus the full one above that has had some generation loss over the years from being traded so much. Only 35 minutes though.\n\nEthan Freeman, Jill Washington, Simon Bowman\n\n1995; London\n\nProshot by RUG. Fuzzy picture, some color loss in darker parts, and hard to see face expressions except in the occasional closeups. Quite a bit of spotlight washout, but big picture and has survived fairly well for something so old. Very nutball Phantom in Ethan Freeman, nice classical Christine in Jill Washington, and solid Raoul in Simon Bowman. VOB.\n\nScott Davies, Meredith Braun, Matthew Cammelle\n\n​March 9, 2000; London\n\nFilmed very close to the stage, so there are some heads, but nothing terrible. MP4.\n\nScott Davies, Charlotte Page, Matthew Cammelle\n\nSummer 2000; London\n\nBright colors and detail. MP4.\n\nJohn Owen-Jones, Celia Graham, Robert Finlayson\n\nSeptember 21, 2002; London\n\nShot from the stalls, so many good closeups but has a few heads to film around. Okay quality, more color bleeding and fuzzier detail than some older London videos. John Owen-Jones and Celia Graham have great chemistry; Celia notices the camera at one point in 'Think of Me'. VOB\n\nJohn Owen-Jones, Rachel Barrell, Oliver Thornton, Anthony Cable (u/s), Sam Hiller, Sally Harrison, Emma Edwards (u/s), Rohan Tickell, Claire Tilling\n\nOctober 15, 2004; London\n\nFilmed at the beginning of Rachel's run. Some people say she isn't as good as she was later on, but I think she sounds and acts the role wonderfully, she just developed and added things a bit more as time went on.\n\nJohn Owen-Jones, Rachel Barrell, Oliver Thornton\n\nFebruary 26, 2005; London\n\nJohn Owen-Jones's last show of his first run. Filmed from the stalls, so great closeups but lots of heads. Rather funny flub where the overture track stops for a few seconds before starting over; too bad there's a blackout there. John Owen-Jones and Rachel Barrell are on fire here, great chemistry. Missing the beginning of 'Masquerade', so footage of Celia Graham as Christine was spliced in. MP4.\n\nEarl Carpenter, Katie Knight-Adams, David Shannon, James Barron, Richard Sidaway (u/s), Wendy Ferguson, Annette Yeo, Rohan Tickell, Heidi Ann O'Brien\n\n2006; London\n\nSA78's master. Previously only a few clips had existed for trade, so it is wonderful to have the full video!\n\nEarl Carpenter (Phantom), Celia Graham (alt Christine), David Shannon (Raoul), David Lawrence (u/s Firmin), Sam Hiller (André), Wendy Ferguson (Carlotta), Emily Harvey (u/s Giry), Rohan Tickell (Piangi), Heidi Ann O'Brien (Meg), Philip Griffiths (Auctioneer/Reyer), Richard Sidaway (Lefèvre), Gavin Mitford (Slave Master), Joanna Loxton (u/s Princess), Cecilia Smiga (Wild Woman), Colin Zammit (u/s Buquet), Siani Owen (u/s Mme Firmin), Ellen Jackson (Wardrobe Mistress), Deborah Crowe (Confidante), Andrew Thwaite (Jeweller/Porter), Mark Cunningham (Hairdresser/Passarino), David Fortune (u/s Don Attilio), Simon Rackley (Porter/Policeman), Howard Ellis (Lionman/Fire Chief), David Erik (Porter/Marksman), Anna-Lee Robertson (Page)\n\nJanuary 2005; London\n\nPreviously there were only 2 clips of this video, but the master has recently released the full one! SA78's master. There is lots of detail due to close zooming, a bright lens and encoding to MP4. Black bar in lower part of the picture, and an evil head of doom on centre/stage right. Some shakiness results at times. Mix of mediums and close ups. Really sweet moment at the end of MotN where Earl sits next to the boat. ​\n\nEarl Carpenter, Rachel Barrell, David Shannon, David Lawrence (u/s), Sam Hiller, Wendy Ferguson, Emily Harvey (u/s), Rohan Tickell, Heidi Ann O'Brien\n\nJanuary 2006; London\n\n​VOB\n\nEarl Carpenter, Rachel Barrell, David Shannon\n\nFebruary 4, 2006; London\n\nHighlights. Great quality video of the performance with many excellent closeups. Includes a flub where the Phantom does not get his dressing robe in time for 'Stranger Than You Dreamt It'. Some head obstruction on the left side of the stage, and the kiss at the end of the 'Final Lair' is missed. VOB.\n\nMatthew Cammelle (s/b), Rachel Barrell, David Shannon, James Barron, Sam Hiller, Wendy Ferguson, Annette Yeo, Rohan Tickell, Heidi Ann O'Brien\n\nFebruary 25, 2006; London\n\nLittle bonus in 'Masquerade: the Man/Woman costume is replaced with the slavegirl costume from Hannibal. WMV files, really clear picture.\n\nMatthew Cammelle (s/b), Rachel Barrell, David Shannon, James Barron, Sam Hiller, Wendy Ferguson, Annette Yeo, Howard Ellis (u/s), Naomi Cobby (u/s)\n\nJune 17, 2006; London\n\nEvening performance.\n\nRamin Karimloo, Leila Benn Harris, Alex Rathgeber, Wendy Ferguson, David Lawrence, Craig Nicholls (u/s), Lindsey Wise\n\nSeptember 6, 2008; London\n\nLast night for Leila Benn Harris, Alex Rathgeber, Wendy Ferguson, David Lawrence, and Lindsey Wise. Act 2 only. Also includes a very blurry, out of focus clip of 'Point of No Return' performed by Nic Greenshields and Robyn North. VOB.\n\nRamin Karimloo, Gina Beck, Simon Bailey\n\nSeptember 9, 2008; London\n\nGina and Simon’s first performance, as well as others. VOB.\n\nDavid Shannon, Gina Beck, Simon Bailey, Rebecca Lock, Gareth Snook, Barry James, Nicky Adams, Emma Harris\n\nAugust 18, 2010; London\n\nFull video, gorgeous video. On most trading sites it is listed as not for trade, but the person who I got it from said to list it as extremely limited trade. So you can email me about it, but it will only be traded for under specific circumstances. 3:1 ratio. VOB.\n\n​David Shannon, Gina Beck, Will Barratt (u/s), Rebecca Lock, Gareth Snook, Barry James, Nicky Adams, Emma Harris\n\nAugust 24, 2010; London\n\nAct 1 starts at Hannibal, Act 2 at 'Wishing'. Another gorgeous video, and another that's not for trade.\n\nJohn Owen Jones, Katie Hall, Killian Donnelly, Wendy Ferguson\n\nSeptember 2011; London\n\nThree MP4 clips, featuring about half of the Overture, Title Song, and All I Ask of You.\n\nRamin Karimloo, Sierra Boggess, Hadley Fraser, Wendy Ferguson, Barry James, Gareth Snook, Wynne Evans, Liz Robertson, Daisy Maywood\n\n2011; Royal Albert Hall\n\nMP4, but very good quality. This is the DVD version.\n\nRamin Karimloo, Sierra Boggess, Hadley Fraser, Wendy Ferguson, Barry James, Gareth Snook, Wynne Evans, Liz Robertson, Daisy Maywood\n\n2011; Royal Albert Hall\n\nMP4, but very good quality. This is the livestream version, which has different angles than the DVD one. The sound isn't as good on this one though when you listen with headphones. But very cool to see the difference between this one and the one above.\n\n​\n\nMarcus Lovett, Anna O'Byrne, Simon Thomas\n\nSeptember 2012; London\n\nTrio-oriented highlights. MP4.\n\nMarcus Lovett, Sofia Escobar, Simon Thomas\n\nAugust 2013; London\n\nPretty good quality, pretty much the same angles as the video above. No closeups though. AVI files.\n\nGeronimo Rauch, Sofia Escobar, Sean Palmer\n\nSeptember 4, 2013; London\n\nFour MP4 files. Full show, but most of Act 1 is audio only save for 'Think of Me' and the scenes in the dressing room. Video is flipped briefly in Act 2 but rights itself quickly. Two versions of Act 1 available: the first is flipped on its side but is larger quality, the second is upright but lower quality. Generally wideshot.\n\nGeronimo Rauch, Harriet Jones, Liam Tamne\n\nJanuary 3, 2015; London\n\nMP4 files, most of Act 1. Very wide shot, lots of washout.​\n\nGeronimo Rauch, Harriet Jones, Richard Munday (u/s)\n\nApril 2015; London\n\nTrio-centered highlights, MP4 files. Lovely cast!\n\nGeronimo Rauch, Lisa-Anne Wood (u/s), Liam Tamne, Andy Hockley, Martin Ball, Lara Martins, Jacinta Mulcahy, John Ellis, Layla Harrison (u/s)\n\nMay 22, 2015; London\n\nNFT. Highlights from Act 2. Lots of blackouts and obstruction. Rare video. MOV files.\n\nstillsortofquiettrading's master.\n\nGeronimo Rauch, Lisa-Anne Wood (u/s), Liam Tamne, Andy Hockley, Martin Ball, Lara Martins, Jacinta Mulcahy, John Ellis, Alicia Beck\n\nJune 5, 2015; London\n\nNFT. Act 1 only, blindshot. MOV,\n\nstillsortofquiettrading's master. Rare video.\n\nJohn Owen Jones, Lisa Ann Wood (u/s), Nadim Naaman\n\nJanuary 28, 2016; London\n\ngreat musical trader's master.\n\nAct I is complete, Act II only includes Masquerade plus curtain calls. Picture is dark/slightly grainy and sound is not great. Rare video. All are AVI files, except for the last one, which is MP4 for some reason. Someone sent me their conversation with the master which said that they were allowing the video to be traded out now.\n\nBen Lewis, Amy Manford, Jeremy Taylor\n\n​August 2018; London\n\n5 clips: AoM to STYDI, Il Muto, Masquerade, Wishing & Wandering Child, PONR to Final Lair. You can see pretty much everything, but it can be a bit shaky. Shot from further back so there aren't any closeups and it is a little blurry. But not bad. ​\n\nDavid Thaxton (The Phantom), Amy Manford (alt. Christine Daae), Jeremy Taylor (Raoul)\n\nDecember 2018; London\n\nThere are some blackouts and a bar in the way at times, but also some lovely closeups. Amy sounds beautiful, I think this is the best I’ve heard her sing the role yet. She definitely improves each show. Hopefully she’ll be principal in her own right someday. MP4 (original format).\n\nDavid Thaxton (The Phantom), Amy Manford (alternate Christine Daae), Danny Whitehead (understudy Raoul de Chagny), Kimberly Blake (Carlotta Giudicelli), Ross Dawes (Monsieur Firmin), Alan Vicary (Monsieur Andre), Jacinta Mulcahy (Madame Giry), Paul Ettore Tabone (Ubaldo Piangi), Georgia Ware (Meg Giry)\n\nApril 2019; London\n\nHitmewithyourbethshot's master. Shot around heads and lighting equipment, but clearer and more action is shown than the one from December. MP4 files (original format). Newly up for trade!​\n\nTim Howar, Amy Manford, Jeremy Taylor\n\nAugust 23 or 30 (?), 2019; London\n\n6 clips, including The Mirror/Title Song, Rooftop, Twisted Every Way, WYWSHA, PONR, and about 3/4 of the Final Lair. They are shot from the right and there is some blocking, but it is much better quality than the clips of Ben and Amy. Very clear. Her Wishing is great. If the date is right, then this was about a week before Tim, Amy, and Jeremy's final show. I just got the Rooftop clip sent to me so if I traded with you for these you can message me for that clip too! Limited trades. MP4.\n\n​David Thaxton (Phantom), Kelly Mathieson (Christine), Jeremy Taylor (Raoul), Kimberly Blake (Carlotta), Ross Dawes (Monsieur Firmin), Kris Manuel (Monsieur Andre), Jacinta Mulcahy (Madame Giry), Matt Bateman (u/s Ubaldo Piangi), Georgia Ware/Lily Howes (Meg Giry), Matthew Barrow, James Bisp, James Butcher, Bridget Costello, Hadrian Delacey, Paul Erbs, Hannah Grace, Philip Griffiths, Katy Hanna, Hettie Hobbs, Andrei Teodor Iliescu, Ellen Jackson, Adam Robert Lewis, Tim Morgan, Rebecca Ridout, Rachel Spurrell, John Stacey, Victoria Ward, Danny Whitehead, Sophie Cottrill, Morven Douglas, Emily Hodge, Grace Horne, Anna Shircliff, Claire Tilling\n\nMarch 2019; London\n\nGeorgia seems to have left the show after Act 1. Maybe due to illness or injury. Nice it get something of Matt too! Also, the other two videos of David with Amy were great, but rather obstructed. This one has no obstruction, nice color and details, and the show is followed really well. Similar to the Rachel Barrell, Gina Beck, etc. videos of the day. The best or at least one of the best to come out of the London production. NYCG8R’s master. VOB.​\n\n​​Josh Piterman, Kelly Mathieson, Alistair So (u/s), Britt Lenting, Paul Ettore Tabone, Georgia Ware\n\nNovember 2019; London\n\nAn amazing cast. So great to see a video of an u/s! Shot around heads and lighting equipment so a decent amount of the show is not there, bethtrades's master. ​\n\nKillian Donnelly, Lucy St Louis, Rhys Whitfield, Saori Oda, Matt Harrop, Adam Linstead, Francesca Ellis, Greg Castiglioni, Ellie Young\n\nAugust 2021; London\n\nTwo MTS files of act 2 only. Includes act 1 audio.

Earl Carpenter's final performance, omits 'Notes I' and 'Prima Donna'. Very obstructed at times but with some great shots at others.​\n\nJames Gant (u/s), Paige Blankson, Matt Blaker, Kelly Glyptis, Matt Harrop, Adam Linstead, Francesca Ellis, Greg Castiglioni, Ellie Young\n\nJuly 2023; London\n\nLasagnatrades's master, NFT until December 29, 2023.

NFT until December 31, 2024 and limited trade after that. Act I is pretty wideshot with a lot of spotlight washout and obstruction along the bottom; Act II is better with more zooms.\n\nJon Robyns, Lily Kerhoas, Michael Colbourne (u/s)\n\nJanuary 2024; London\n\nWhatYouWill's master, NFT until January 31, 2025.\n\n​Jon Robyns, Lily Kerhoas, Michael Colbourne, Kelly Glyptis, Matt Harrop, Adam Linstead, Francesca Ellis, David Kristopher-Brown, Maiya Kikasa\n\nJanuary 2024; London\n\nWhatYouWill's master, NFT until January 31, 2025.

NFT until February 28, 2025. WhatYouWill's master.\n\nBroadway\n\nMichael Crawford, Sarah Brightman, Steve Barton, Hal Prince, Charles Hart\n\n1987; Broadway\n\nRehearsal footage, around 40 minutes long. Professionally filmed and sometimes static-y and fuzzy, but rare glimpse of the original cast and director working on the production. MP4.\n\nMichael Crawford, Sarah Brightman, Steve Barton\n\n1988; Broadway\n\nAbout 6 minutes of press reels of the original Broadway cast. Includes the title song, 'Music of the Night', 'All I Ask of You', 'Masquerade', and 'Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again'. A lot of generation loss. Also includes press reels from other shows. VOB.\n\nMichael Crawford, Sarah Brightman, Steve Barton\n\nApril 1988; Broadway\n\nStarts partway through 'Overture'. Color bleeding, washout, generation loss, and several unimportant scenes ('Prologue', 'Magical Lasso', etc.) are cut out, but nevertheless a video of the original cast on Broadway (and they are splendid). MP4.\n\nMichael Crawford, Dale Kristien, Steve Barton, Nick Wyman, Cris Groenendaal, Judy Kaye, David Romano, Leila Martin\n\nOctober 8, 1988; Broadway\n\nMichael Crawford's penultimate show. VOB.\n\nCris Groenendaal, Rebecca Luker, Steve Barton\n\n1989; Broadway\n\nAlmost black-and-white video with constant flickering lines. Dark and tons of generation loss and washout. But hey, it’s the only video of Rebecca Luker that I know of and she’s pretty great. VOB.\n\nDavis Gaines, Tracy Shayne, Ciaran Sheehan\n\n1995; Broadway\n\nComes with D’Ambrosio, Shayne, Sheehan video. MP4.\n\nThomas James O'Leary, Tracy Shayne, Gary Mauer\n\nJanuary 26, 1998; Broadway\n\n37 minutes of scattered highlights of the tenth anniversary performance on Broadway. MP4.\n\nThomas James O' Leary, Sandra Joseph, Gary Mauer, Jeff Keller, George Lee Andrews, Patricia Hurd, Lelia Martin, Ted Keegan\n\nJuly 1998; Broadway\n\nPretty clear filming and details, especially for something so old. VOB.​\n\nHoward McGillin, Adrienne McEwan (alt), Gary Mauer, George Lee Andrews, Jeff Keller (?), Leilia Martin (Giry?)\n\nSeptember 20, 1999; Broadway\n\nHighlights, runs 77 minutes. Nice close-ups. Color is a little low. It seems that the taper sort of knows the show, but the camera wanders a lot and doesn't always get the right shots. On the rarer side. Regarded by many as one of Howard's best shows\n\nHoward McGillin, Adrienne McEwan, Jim Weitzer (u/s)\n\nSeptember 1, 2001; Broadway\n\nPretty good detail and color.\n\nHoward McGillin, Elizabeth Southard, Michael Shawn Lewis, Jeff Keller, George Lee Andrews, Rebecca Eichenberger, Marilyn Caskey, David Gaschen (u/s), Joelle Gates*\n\nMarch 27, 2002; Broadway\n\nPretty shaky filming and some washout, but otherwise a decent video.\n\nHoward McGillin, Elizabeth Southard, Michael Shawn Lewis, Wren Marie Harrington, Jeff Keller, George Lee Andrews, Marilyn Caskey, David Gaschen (u/s), Joelle Gates*\n\nJuly 31, 2002; Broadway\n\nHoward McGillin, Adrienne McEwan, Jim Weitzer (u/s), Patty Goble (u/s), Jeff Keller, George Lee Andrews, Sally Williams, Larry Wayne Morbitt, Joelle Gates\n\nApril 5, 2003; Broadway\n\nFairly good quality, probably the best video of Adrienne McEwan. Another large head obstructs most of the bottom left screen. I really like Adrienne. MP4.\n\nHugh Panaro, Lisa Vroman, John Cudia\n\nMay 20, 2003; Broadway\n\nDecent picture and quality, some washout in wider shots. This cast is really amazing all around. VOB.\n\nHugh Panaro, Sandra Joseph, John Cudia, Jeff Keller, George Lee Andrews, Patricia Phillips, Marilyn Caskey, Larry Wayne Morbitt, Joelle Gates\n\nAugust 9, 2003; Broadway\n\nHugh Panaro, Julie Hanson, Jim Weitzer\n\nOctober 7, 2003; Broadway\n\nFull show. Much sharper filming and detail than previous Broadway videos. VOB,\n\nHoward McGillin, Julie Hanson, John Cudia, Jeff Keller, George Lee Andrews, Kris Koop (u/s), Larry Wayne Morbitt, Marilyn Caskey, Heather McFadden\n\nJune 28, 2004; Broadway\n\nHoward McGillin was covering for Hugh Panaro, who was on vacation. While the quality is alright, the filming leaves much to be desired - tons of heads in the way, really shaky filming, and many moments of camera straying or wideshots only.\n\nHugh Panaro, Julie Hanson, John Cudia\n\nMarch 2, 2005, Broadway\n\nLovely quality video, nice color and details, but filmer didn't know show very well, resulting in more wideshots than might be usual. Hugh, Julie, and John make a stunning trio, though Hugh was apparently having an off-night. VOB.\n\nJames Romick (u/s), Marie Danvers, John Cudia\n\nApril 2, 2005; Broadway\n\nMarie Danvers filled in for Christine while Julie Hanson was on vacation. Starts during Carlotta's rant, includes James Romick's BCEFA speech at the end. MP4.\n\nHugh Panaro, Sandra Joseph, Tim Martin Gleason, Jeff Keller, George Lee Andrews, Anne Runolfsson, Marilyn Caskey, David Gaschen (u/s), Kara Klein\n\nJune 6, 2005; Broadway\n\nAct Two starts in the middle of Masquerade. Sandra stands caressing the Phantom's face for several moments after the kiss. Some audience members start laughing during the Masquerade reprise.\n\nHugh Panaro, Julie Hanson, Tim Martin Gleason\n\nJune 22, 2005; Broadway\n\nHugh Panaro, Rebecca Pitcher (alt), Tim Martin Gleason, Jeff Keller, George Lee Andrews, Anne Runolfsson, Marilyn Caskey, Larry Wayne Morbitt, Kara Klein\n\nJuly 16, 2005; Broadway\n\nHighlights of the matinee. Rebecca's second performance on Broadway. After being so Raoul-biased on the tour, she attacks Hugh during the kiss so fiercely that he nearly falls over backward. A flub during the Final Lair where Rebecca does not throw the veil properly and it lands somewhere near the portcullis so Hugh has to make do without it at the end. Really steady filming. WMV files.\n\nTim Martin-Gleason (u/s), Susan Owen (u/s), Stephen R Buntrock (u/s)\n\nAugust 10, 2005; Broadway\n\nNice video, much the same as many of the other 2005 videos released around this time. MP4.\n\nStephen R. Buntrock (u/s), Rebecca Pitcher, Fred Rose (u/s)\n\nAugust 13, 2005; Broadway\n\nSome blackouts, but great quality video. MP4\n\nHugh Panaro, Sandra Joseph, Tim Martin Gleason, James Romick (u/s), George Lee Andrews, Anne Runolfsson, Marilyn Caskey, Larry Wayne Morbitt, Kara Klein\n\nOctober 1, 2005; Broadway\n\nHugh Panaro's last performance at the time, includes curtain call and speeches at the end. Beautiful, clear picture with great detail and quality, and the entire cast was on fire. MP4.\n\nHoward McGillin, Sandra Joseph, Tim Martin Gleason\n\nJanuary 9, 2006; Broadway\n\nRecord-breaking performance. Video quality is very nice, save for a head blocking a lot of the right side of the screen. Unfortunately only features Act 1 and the curtain call and speeches at the end. MP4\n\nHoward McGillin, Rebecca Pitcher, Michael Shawn Lewis, Julie Schmidt (u/s), David Cryer, George Lee Andrews, Marilyn Caskey, Roland Rusinek, Heather McFadden\n\nAugust 18, 2006; Broadway\n\nGary Mauer, Jennifer Hope Wills, Jason Mills (u/s), George Lee Andrews, David Cryer, Patricia Phillips (u/s), Roland Rusinek, Sally Williams (u/s), Heather McFadden, James Romick (u/s)\n\nMay 9, 2007; Broadway\n\nBeautiful video shot in widescreen, no obstructions at all and follows the show very well. Includes a hilarious flub where Joseph Buquet fails to come out during 'Magical Lasso' and Heather McFadden, Sally Williams, and the rest of the ballet girls improvise.

Filmed from the balcony with some head obstructions and cover-ups. The camera tends to wander and has trouble focusing at times. Greg's voice is rich and he has a great evil laugh. His hat pops off just after he helps Mary out of the boat during the title song, but they both handle it smoothly and he tosses it away after Mary faints at the end of MOTN. His \"floating, falling\" is very sensual, I wish Mary would have given something back! Mary always is great in PONR, especially when she arches her back on the bench when the Phantom sits down behind her. Greg plays on that and it makes for a lot of tension. I only wish the filmer had stayed on it the entire time! And I believe you can hear Jeremy call out \"Christine, no!\" when she kisses the Phantom. He most likely did because I've heard him do it in other videos, and he did it when I saw him live a few times. A great addition. Includes curtain calls and Greg's BC/EFA speech.\n\nHugh Panaro, Sara Jean Ford, Jeremy Hays\n\nMarch 31, 2014; Broadway\n\nThis was during Sara’s brief return as alternate.

Dale Kristien's 'Think of Me' cadenza goes on forever. VOB.\n\n​Brad Little, Amy Jo Arrington or Megan Starr Levitt\n\n1998; Texas, US Tour\n\nA rare find! It's only about 12 minutes of the show; I wish it was longer or even the full show not only because of the cast but because some of the closeups are pretty good. Because of the quality and that Amy and Megan did look a little similar, I can't tell which one of them it is. So if you know let me know! Extremely limited trades, 3:1 ratio. MP4.\n\nDavis Gaines, Marie Danvers, Lawrence Anderson\n\nSeptember 1998; Los Angeles\n\nPretty good quality considering it's age; has yellow-ish tinge but is quite clear in details and facial expressions. Flub during the mirror scene, where the light doesn't go on to illuminate the Phantom. VOB.\n\n​​​Davis Gaines, Marie Danvers, Lawrence Anderson, Leila Martin\n\n​October 4, 1998; US Tour\n\nOk, so I have a few notes on this one. First, this cast is listed as being on Broadway and the second US Tour both in 1998 if we are going by records that are online. But the master told me that Madame Giry was definitely Leila Martin, and I don't believe that she was ever anywhere but New York. But then I am also a bit in question because according to an online record, this cast wasn't on Broadway past September of 1998 and there is in fact another video of Davis and Marie from September 1998 from the tour. So I do not know where this is exactly from. But it is such good quality and a solid cast, so I doubt the location matters too much. Highlights, taken by the same person as the one above and below. Pretty great quality. About a hour long. Limited trades. Also, finding out who the Raoul is from the master, so pending!\n\n​​Franc D'Ambrosio, Lisa Vroman, Christopher Carl\n\nOctober 14, 1998; US Tour\n\nHighlights, amazing quality for the time. Definitely the best quality one Franc and probably Lisa too. A hour long.\n\n​​Franc D'Ambrosio, Lisa Vroman, Christopher Carl\n\nOctober 15, 1998: US Tour\n\nShot by the same person who did the highlights video of these two. A longer video with the same great quality; about an hour and a half. Has all of Act 2 and misses a little of Hannibal, Magical Lasso, some of Notes, and Prima Donna. MP4 files.\n\nIan Jon Bourg/Brad Little, Rebecca Pitcher, Richard Todd Adams, David Cryer.\n\n1999; Salt Lake City & Philadelphia\n\nIan Jon Bourg Highlights video; runs about 80 minutes. Compiling performances of Ian as both the Phantom and M. Andre (Brad plays the Phantom when Ian is Andre). Only video of Ian from an American production. To narrow the time frame down a bit, the video was taken sometime between November/December in Salt Lake and December/January in Philly.​\n\nBrad Little, Rebecca Pitcher, Richard Todd Adams\n\nNovember 11, 1999; US Tour\n\nHighlights, taken by the same person as the Franc and Lisa one. Pretty great quality. A hour long. Limited trades.\n\nTed Keegan, Rebecca Pitcher, John Cudia\n\nNovember 30, 2000; US Tour\n\nHighlights. Includes: part of the auction to the end of the Hannibal rehearsal, part of Angel of Music to the end of MOTN, a bit of the Il Muto ballet, part of the Rooftop, most of AIAOY to the end of the Reprise, most of Masquerade, Why So Silent, part of Notes II, most of Wishing, Wandering Child, part of Don Juan Triumphant, and then PONR to the end of the Final Lair. The taper tends to wander and the picture is fuzzy. A shame that this isn't a full show or even a better quality highlights video because Ted is fantastic as always and Rebecca was so much nicer earlier in her run.

Short cut just before Little Lotte, then includes the entire sequence from The Mirror to the end of the first Lair. Only the Phantom's parts of Il Muto were taped. Includes the entire Rooftop. Act two starts at the last verse of \"Masquerade\" for \"Why so Silent.\" Cuts made in Notes II – begins at \"Raoul I'm frightened.\" Cut out the Rehearsal, and the Before the Premiere scenes, and video picks back up at Point Of No Return.

On the shaky side. Unfortunately some synching problems cause half-second late audio lags during the second act. 2nd show and Southard's first performance of the Boston tour stop. Quirks: the curtain never goes up after Think of Me for Christine to take her bows, and the curtain during curtain call takes quite awhile to go up as well (you can hear the creaking as the technicians raise it manually).

Picks up again in the middle of the Rooftop and runs till the end of the act. Second Act shot from balcony (after the taper was caught) runs from Point of No Return through Mauer's hilarious BC/EFA speech. Starts out shaky in the beginning and some blockage from a large moving head, but otherwise definitely some good shooting. Mid to close-close-ups all the way through.

But there’s also a huge head blocking the center at times, which can be annoying. Includes the flub where Christine cannot quite get the hood off the Phantom’s head during Point of No Return. Starts at Think of Me in Act I and halfway through Masquerade in Act II. Also includes Point of No Return and Final Lair with Marie Danvers as Christine from January 18.

The second one is Act 1 from a different performance filmed from the circle, good quality for its age. Kanji Ishimaru is Raoul. The chandelier fall was borrowed from the highlights, Both videos have some shakiness and are a bit flattened. Also includes 4 minutes of the show which is unknown at the end. The last video file is damaged by digital glitches starting from second video's AIAoY where glitches are not a serious problem, from \"I must go\" till the end the video becomes hardly watchable. The first year for Yuichiro Yamaguchi as the Phantom after playing Raoul for 2 years. Later in the interview he said that he felt he was too young to play the Phantom so he didn't express all his feelings. This is also the debut for Kanji Ishimaru who was a student at that moment.

VOB.\n\nIan Jon Bourg, Alison Kelly, Kyle Gonyea\n\nApril 25, 2000; Hamburg, Germany\n\nShot from the left side of the stage; tons of good closeups, great color and detail, but a little dark. Excellent cast.\n\nIan Jon Bourg, Alison Kelly, Kyle Gonyea\n\nNovember 11, 2000; Hamburg, Germany\n\nOne hour of Phantom-oriented highlights. Pretty dull quality.\n\nIan Jon Bourg (The Phantom of the Opera), Valentina Kozhanova (u/s Christine Daaé), Rob Pitcher (u/s Raoul), Evelyn Werner (Carlotta Giudicelli), Anders Sohlman (Monsieur Firmin), David Hunerjaeger (Monsieur André), Kate Lawrence (Meg Giry)\n\n2001; Hamburg\n\nSomething of Rob some 14 years before he was a Phantom and Raoul u/s in Hamburg again!\n\nIan Jon Bourg, Olivia Safe (u/s), Kyle Gonyea\n\n2001; Hamburg, Germany\n\nNicely shot video. Filmer knows the show well, and the color and detail is pretty sharp for it's age. VOB.\n\nJuan Navarro/Saulo Vasconcelos, Claudia Cota/Irasema Terrazas, Jose Joel\n\nJanuary 14, 2001; Mexico City, Mexico\n\nFinal performance(s) in Mexico; one cast for Act 1, another cast for Act 2. Big chunks missing in Act 2. VOB.\n\nMichael Nicholson (alt), Olivia Safe (u/s), Christopher Morandi (alt), Reinhard Schulze (u/s?), Anders Sohlmann, Evelyn Werner (u/s), Linda Bruske, Charlie Serrano, Kate Lawrence\n\nJune 30, 2001; Hamburg\n\nFinal matinee performance in Hamburg and the final performance open to the public. Shot from the balcony. The rail gets in the way at times, but only during wide shots. Funny closing ad libs: the center skull from Robert le Diable is wearing sunglasses, the marksman is in the pit applauding Christine after ToM, crazy cadenzas during Il Muto. Also, a flub-up in the show, the backdrop never falls in “Hannibal”.\n\nIan Jon Bourg, Colby Thomas, Kyle Gonyea, David Hunerjaeger, Anders Sohlmann, Vera Borisova, Linda Bruske, Marcello Roncietto, Kate Lawrence\n\nJune 30, 2001; Hamburg\n\nFinal performance in Hamburg\n\nJuan Carlos Barona, Julia Moller, Zenón Recalde (u/s)\n\n2002; Madrid, Spain\n\nThree-camera proshot. Sharp details and colors, but looks pixelated, like it was compressed when burned to DVD. Audio gets out of synch in the final scenes, unfortunately. MP4.\n\nLuis Armando, Felicidad Farag, Armando Pita\n\n2002; Madrid, Spain\n\nProshot from a single camera. Lots of color bleeding and fuzziness, tending towards reds and yellows. But I do love this cast, especially Felicidad. VOB.\n\nIan Jon Bourg, Janine Kitzen, Michael Shawn Lewis\n\nNovember 16, 2002; Stuttgart, Germany\n\nMonitor video of one of the first shows in Stuttgart, with audio fed in from the soundboard. Decent color and exposure; better than the other two monitor videos that came out of Stuttgart. Filming continues through intermission, so video features 30 minutes of curtains. LIMITED TRADE.​\n\nJuan Carlos Barona, Julia Moller, Zenon Recalde (u/s)\n\n​2003; Madrid, Spain\n\nSingle-camera proshot of the alternate Spain cast. Excellent quality, though a lot of mechanical noise from the camera as it moves.​ VOB.\n\nRoy Weissensteiner (u/s), Marion Wilmer (u/s), Carsten Lepper\n\n2003; Stuttgart, Germany\n\nFull stage shot and soundboard audio. I just watched part of the video and it turns out that I don't have MOTN to the beginning of Prima Donna. I guess the person I traded with didn't realize it/didn't have it and I didn't watch that part to know. So I don't have it. VOB.\n\nSandor Sasvari, Andrea Maho, Gabor Bot\n\n2003; Budapest, Hungary\n\n​Small video of the non-replica Hungarian production. Mostly mid to full stage shots, not many zooms, and lots of washout, but gives a good look at all the changes. VOB.\n\nAttila Csengeri, Renata Krassy, Gabor Bot\n\n2003; Budapest, Hungary\n\nVOB.\n\nZoltan Miller, Linda Kiraly, Zsolt Homonnay\n\nMay 21, 2003; Budapest, Hungary\n\nSomewhat fuzzy picture, but biggest video and steadiest filming of the three 2003 videos of the Hungarian production. Sound only comes from the right side. Zoltan Miller cracks in the title song. VOB.\n\nSteve Lucas (u/s), Maike Switzer, Carsten Lepper, Stefan Mueller-Ruppert, Marko Woytowicz, Barbara Grey Nystrom, Anette Kuhn, Marcello Ronchietto, Lara Glew\n\nNovember 28, 2003; Stuttgart\n\nIncludes flub in which Red Death could not make it up to the staircase during 'Masquerade', so he walks through the crowd to get there. VOB\n\nAttila Csengeri, Barbara Fonyo, Zsolt Homonnay, Peter Pankotay, Bela Szerednyey, Robert Weil, Patricia Kuthy, Ilona Bencze\n\n2004; Budapest, Hungary\n\nHighlights, about 45 minutes. The only video of Barbara in the role. She has quickly become one of my favorites. VOB.\n\nAttila Csengeri, Eszter Biro, Zsolt Homonnay\n\n2004; Budapest, Hungary\n\nHighlights, 20 minutes, comes also with some Sasvari/Krassy/Miller. VOB.\n\nRoy Weissensteiner (u/s), Maike Switzer, Carsten Axel Lepper\n\nMarch 2004; Stuttgart, Germany\n\nMonitor video, full stage shot, quite a bit of color bleeding and exposure.

VOB.\n\nThomas Schulze, Maike Switzer, Carsten Axel Lepper, Ernst van Looy, Jonathan Agar, Barbara Gray Nystrom, Gabriele Ramm, Marchello Ronchietto, Katie Wood\n\nMay 23, 2004; Stuttgart, Germany\n\nLast show for the Stuttgart production; features some funny ad-libs from the cast including the famous 3rd kiss after Christine returns the Phantom’s ring. Big picture, a little fuzzy. Blocking from heads and the bar in front; camera can be very shaky. Many wideshots and gigantic closeups as well. MP4.\n\nZoltán Miller, Andrea Maho, Gábor Bot\n\nJuly 28, 2005; Budapest, Hungary\n\nHighlights, about an hour long, quite a bit of obstruction due to filming from the left balcony and the camera often goes out of focus, giving us a blurry picture, but there are also a lot of beautiful close-ups to make up for it. VOB.\n\nThomas Borchert, Sandra Danyella, Nikolaj Alexander Brucker, Laurie Ann McGowan, Gabriele Ramm\n\nNovember 27/December 28, 2005; Essen, Germany\n\nHave seen this video under two different dates. I do very much love Sandra's TOM cadenza.\n\nSaulo Vasconcelos, Kiara Sasso, Nando Prado\n\n2006 (?); Sao Paulo, Brazil\n\nMonitor video, date is unknown so I took a guess. MP4.\n\nSaulo Vasconcelos, Kiara Sasso, Nando Prado\n\n2006(?); Sao Paulo, Brazil\n\nAudience recording, looks like from two cameras.

VOB.\n\nMasayuki Sano, Tamami Sai, Yuosuke Kitazawa\n\nJuly 1, 2007; Osaka, Japan\n\nNice, recent video of the Japanese cast. Taper sometimes drifts away from the action to focus on the stage. MP4.\n\nTomasz Steciuk, Kaja Mianowana, Lukasz Talik\n\n2008 (?); Warsaw, Poland\n\nLow quality video of non-replica Polish production; no closeups and shot from the same angle the entire time. Small, fuzzy picture and pretty poor sound quality. Starts during Christine's 'Think of Me', general trio-oriented highlights. Still, it is one of the only videos from the Polish production. AVI.\n\nSimon Pryce (s/b), Ana Marina, Alexander Lewis\n\nApril 22, 2008; Brisbane, Australia\n\nNicely shot with good colors and quality.\n\nAlexander Lewis (u/s), Ana Marina, David Somerville (u/s), Andrea Creighton, Jackie Rees, Nadia Komazec\n\nSeptmeber 11, 2008; Australia\n\nMostly obstructed footage; some is audio only. Fragmented Christine-oriented highlights: 'Overture', Hannibal, last bit of 'Think of Me', parts of 'Angel of Music', 'The Mirror', title song, 'Stranger Than You Dreamt It', and the rooftop scene, most of 'Twisted Every Way' and last half of 'Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again', and almost all of 'Point of No Return' and 'Final Lair'. MP4\n\nAnthony Warlow, Ana Marina, Alexander Lewis\n\n2009 (?); Australia\n\nSeven AVI clips. No idea as to the exact location or date. Phantom-oriented highlights. Really great quality except for the 'FInal Lair', which is much smaller and more pixelated. I adore this cast.

MP4.\n\nPeter Jorde, Teresia Bokor, Tomas Ambt Kofod\n\n2009; Copenhagen\n\n6 MP4 clips and 1 audio clip. The audio clip is of The Mirror. The videos are of the title song, Music of the Night, Wishing, Point of No Return, and Down Once More. The video is shot from further away, but sometimes the camera zooms in. But there are no good close ups or sharp details.\n\nAnthony Warlow, Ana Marina, Alexander Lewis, John O'May, Derek Taylor, Andrea Creighton, Jackie Rees, David Rogers Smith, Nadia Komazec\n\nMay 22, 2009; Adelaide, Australia\n\nAct 1 only. Consists mostly of shaky wideshots. Tons of blackouts and camera tends to stray a lot. But it does show the screens that were on the sides so that's interesting. MP4.\n\nMathias Edenborn, Valerie Link, Nicky Wuchinger\n\nDecember 11, 2013; Hamburg, Germany\n\nI adore Valerie and Nicky. Very nice quality. VOB.\n\nBrad Little, Claire Lyon, Anthony Downing\n\nJanuary 1, 2014; Shanghai, China\n\nPretty decent video.

This does mean that certain parts have a lot of washout while others are very grainy. Nevertheless, a pretty nice video.

Starts right before chorus in Hannibal, otherwise complete.\n\nMarian Vojtko, Michaela Gemrotova/Monika Sommerova, Tomas Vanek\n\nApril 2015; Prague, Czech Republic\n\nBlindshot highlights. Michaela Gemrotova plays Christine in all but the last two clips, where Monika Sommerova is Christine and is shot at a closer and different angle. Lots of blackouts and heads covering the screen.

First for Maria Ivleva as Christine. Highlights. Maria whispers something to Dmitry during the ring return. Though it's shot close to the stage there are some heads in the way; Act 2 has a few less heads and a little better of an angle.

From the New Year’s day performance.\n\nBrent Barrett, Elizabeth Welch, Max Niemeyer\n\nMarch 24, 2016; Oberhausen, Germany\n\nGenerally trio-centered highlights.

This originally said Ivan, but it's Dmitri.\n\nPeter Joback, Emmi Christensson, Anton Zetterholm\n\nFebruary 2017; Stockholm, Sweden\n\nVideo of the full show from the first row. Usually people have the MP4 version ripped from YouTube, but this one seems like it is better quality. This might be the original file. Because it is so close and to the right, things happening at the very back or very left of the stage is missed, but some nice closeups when things are at the right. Also, very beautiful closeups of the curtains in the Overture. TS file.\n\nFred Johanson, Sofie Asplund, John Martin Bengtsson\n\nSeptember 23, 2017; Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nNon-replica production based on the Finnish production, Act 1 only. MP4.\n\nRadim Schwab, Monika Sommerova, Tomáš Vaněk\n\n2016/18/19; Prague\n\nFive MP4 clips, Think of Me, the end of the Title Song and MOTN, the Rooftop, and Wishing. These come from at least three different shows, the Rooftop scene is not as good quality as the others (not bad by any means though) and is shot from the left. That clip comes from Monika and Tomáš' last show in May 2019. Think of Me comes from September 16, 2016 and Wishing comes from October 21, 2018. The Title Song/MOTN one doesn't have a date.\n\nThiago Arancam, Giulia Nadruz/Lina Mendes (?)\n\n2018; Brazil\n\n13 minutes of highlights from Act 2.

Shot on a phone, so no great closeups and it’s kind of blurry. But when the actors come into the view of the camera you can make out the action. Nice look at two understudies— Fred I think is still termed as an u/s, but I’m calling him the alt. cause he goes on pretty much every week.

No obstructions (except for the first 2 minutes of Act 1). Filmed with a mix of wide, mediums and close-ups, across both Act One and Act two. Minimal wandering, other than a change in set, no major dropouts. The video has some lag and drops in framerate throughout, though, so it almost looks like the audio is playing normal but the video is in a sort of slow motion. Due to a trading issue with someone, the master has decided to make this video NFT. So at least for now there isn't any recording, or at least a full good one of the tour unfortunately.
