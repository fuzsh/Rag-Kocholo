        "text": "Canadian actor and theatre producer (born 1946)\n\nFor other people named Ross Petty, see Ross Petty (disambiguation).\n\nRoss Petty (born August 29, 1946) is a Canadian actor and theatre producer. He is best known for his eponymous production company, which staged what were promoted as \"family musical\" theatre productions in the British pantomime tradition in Toronto every holiday season from 1996 until 2022.[1]\n\nEarly career\n\n[edit]\n\nPetty was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[1]\n\nIn Europe, he sang at Le Lido in Paris and appeared with Betty Grable in the London West End musical Belle Starr. In the United States, he made his Broadway debut in Arthur Kopit's Wings, created the role of Eddie Dorrance on All My Children, and co-starred with Ginger Rogers and Sid Caesar in a national tour of Cole Porter’s Anything Goes.\n\nHe appeared in the U.S. and Canada in the title role of Stephen Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd, directed by Hal Prince. His film and television credits include Extreme Measures with Gene Hackman and Hugh Grant, Perry Mason, Spenser: For Hire, Monk, Loving Friends and Perfect Couples, Forever Knight, E.N.G., Night Heat, Seeing Things, Hot Shots, All My Children, A Judgement in Stone, Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, Counterstrike, The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne, Traders, F/X2 and Martha Inc: The Martha Stewart Story.\n\nHe has also done voices in several cartoon shows including X-Men, The Busy World of Richard Scarry, Bob and Margaret, Mythic Warriors: Guardians of the Legend, Bad Dog, Redwall, Mischief City, Ned's Newt, Jacob Two-Two, Monster Force, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Freaky Stories, Free Willy, Rupert, The Adventures of Tintin, Little Bear, RoboRoach, Birdz, Pippi Longstocking and Rescue Heroes.\n\nRoss Petty Productions Christmas pantomimes\n\n[edit]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early-1980s, pantomimes were staged at the Royal Alexandra Theatre by British producer Paul Elliott, who imported traditional English pantomimes using a primarily British cast complemented by some Canadian actors, which included Petty and his wife, Karen Kain.[2] Petty also began co-producing the pantos with Elliott in 1986, and continued until Elliott decided to no longer present the shows in Toronto in 1996.[3]\n\nIn 1996, Petty, through his Ross Petty Productions company, began producing what he termed \"Fractured Fairy Tale Musicals\". These musicals were performed at the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatre in Toronto, during the Christmas season (typically between late-November and early-January.)[4] Petty's productions were based in the old English pantomime tradition, incorporating its broad comedy, winking asides that break the fourth wall, audience participation, and a man wearing a dress.[citation needed] However, Petty dropped the use of the principal boy while retaining the pantomime dame.[citation needed] To modernize his shows, Petty incorporated references to current, local, and/or pop cultural references and often used current popular music.[5] Petty also adapted it to a Canadian audience, writing original scripts, using an all-Canadian cast.[6]\n\nPetty ensured his productions were family-friendly and appropriate for children, even while occasionally incorporating some \"adult jokes\". Referencing this, Petty commented, \"The kids in the audience aren't going to understand those references...they are jokes for the adults.\"[7] Additionally, Petty instructed his writers to take a feminist approach to the scripts so that characters such as Cinderella and Snow White \"aren’t just pining after the prince\" but are more assertive and independent.[8]\n\nIn 2006, Petty revived the 2004 production of Aladdin and embarked on a cross-Canada tour in November and December.[9] The tour starred the same cast, which included former professional wrestler Bret 'The Hitman' Hart, and had tour stops in Vancouver, Edmonton, Regina, Saskatoon, Calgary, Toronto, and Ottawa.[10]\n\nBetween 1996 and 2015, Petty appeared in his shows portraying the villain, who was usually dressed in drag (the pantomime dame).[11] In 2015, Petty retired from performing following the production of Peter Pan, but continued as a producer.[8]\n\nThe 2017 production of A Christmas Carol was filmed, and later broadcast on Family Channel and CBC as well as made available for purchase on DVD.[12]\n\nIn 2020, Petty's planned production of Aladdin was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[13] Instead, There’s No Place Like Home For The Holidays was performed as an online revue. This allowed audiences to watch the show from home while still incorporating music, dance, comedy, and audience interaction.[14][15] Petty's 2021 production, Alice in Winterland, was similarly presented online that allowed audiences to watch from home.[16]\n\nPetty announced that the 2022 show, Peter's Final Flight: The Pan-Tastical Family Musical, would be the company's final production, with Petty reprising his role as a villain for the final production.[17]\n\nRevival\n\n[edit]\n\nIn March 2024, it was announced that the Canadian Stage Company will be reviving Petty's annual family panto productions.[18] The first production will be The Wizard of Oz, which will play at the Winter Garden Theatre between December 2024 and January 2025.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nMany of Petty's productions were well-received by Toronto theatre critics, and many of his shows performed to sell-out audiences.[19][20]\n\nPetty's productions have received praise for introducing theatre to children at a young age, with many noting that there was a lack of family-friendly theatre in the Toronto area.[21][22] Toronto theatre critic J. Kelly Nestruck wrote that Petty's annual holiday pantos were one of the few options for family-friendly live entertainment in Toronto, with shows that contained comedy for both children and adults.[23] Joshua Chong of the Toronto Star similarly referred to Petty's shows as being one of the few shows in Toronto where \"...the whole family can have fun.\"[24]\n\nPetty has also been praised for his inclusion of drag performers in many of his shows. Petty's villainous characters were usually dressed in drag and Dan Chameroy's recurring \"Plumbum\" character was a comedic feminine-presenting character.[25][26] Petty and his writers took care to ensure that \"Plumbum\" was presented with a sense of honesty and vulnerability.[27]\n\nHowever, Petty's productions have been criticized for their commercialism through product placement, as his shows project ads on a screen from their corporate sponsors during breaks in the show. Petty defended this decision, indicating that his shows would not be financially viable without commercial sponsorship.[28] Since Petty's productions were for-profit, they were not eligible for government funding and had to rely on corporate sponsors to help subsidize the shows.[29]\n\nPetty's productions have also been criticized for their lack of racial diversity in casting.[30][31] In 2014, Toronto theatre critic J. Kelly Nestruck felt the all-white casts were not reflective of Toronto's growing diversity and multiculturalism.[32] In 2019, Toronto actor Kevin Vidal also criticized Petty for the lack of racial diversity in his shows.[33] In 2020, Petty issued an apology. He acknowledged the importance of ensuring more racially diverse casts and the importance of doing so for children in their audiences, and also pledged to create more inclusive casting processes.[34]\n\nProduction history\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Show title Cast Ref. 1996 Robin Hood Ross Petty, Karen Kain, Frank Augustyn [35] 1997 Jack and the Beanstalk Ross Petty, Camilla Scott, Heath Lamberts, Jeff Hyslop [36] 1998 Aladdin Ross Petty, Camilla Scott, Barry MacGregor, Ernie Coombs [37] 1999 Cinderella Laura Bertram, Laird Mackintosh, Michael Lamport, William Vickers, Juan Chioran [38] 2000 Peter Pan Ross Petty, Sheila McCarthy, Ernie Coombs, Robert McCarrol, Jayne Lewis [39] 2001 Snow White Ross Petty, Graham Abbey, Melissa Thomson, Eddie Glen, Allan Redford, Fred Penner, Peter Deiwick [40] 2002 Robin Hood Ross Petty, Graham Abbey, Amy Walsh, Nora McLellan, Rex Harrington, Paul Alexander Nolan, Sara Topham, Simon Bradbury [41] 2003 Cinderella Ross Petty, Jennifer Gould, Adam Brazier, Don Harron, Erin Davis, Mary Ellen Mahoney, Paul Alexander Nolan, Cliff Saunders, Jonathan Wilson [42] 2004 Aladdin Ross Petty, Bret 'The Hitman' Hart, Jamie McKnight, Jennifer Dale, Derek McGrath [43] 2005 Snow White Ross Petty, Elena Juatco, Ryan Malcolm, Gary Beals, Billy Klippert, Sean Cullen, Alan Frew [44] 2006 Aladdin Ross Petty, Bret 'The Hitman' Hart, Jamie McKnight, Jennifer Dale, Derek McGrath [45] 2007 Peter Pan Ross Petty, Kurt Browning, Jennifer Waiser, Eddie Glen, Meghan Hoople, Brandon Banks [46] 2008 Cinderella Ross Petty, Jake Epstein, Paula Brancati, Patty Sullivan, Adam Brazier, Dan Chameroy, Eddie Glen [47] 2009 Robin Hood Ross Petty, Eva Avila, Yvan Pedneault, Dan Chameroy, Jessica Holmes, Jeff Irving [48] 2010 Beauty and the Beast Ross Petty, Jake Epstein, Melissa O'Neil, Scott Thompson, Eddie Glen, Jake Simons, Lisa Lennox, Meghan Hoople [49] 2011 Wizard of Oz Ross Petty, Elicia MacKenzie, Yvan Pedneault, Dan Chameroy, Jessica Holmes, Eddie Glen, Kyle Blair, Steve Ross [50] 2012 Snow White Ross Petty, Graham Abbey, Melissa O'Neil, Bryn McAuley, David Cotton, Eddie Glen, Billy Lake, Reid Janisse [51] 2013 The Little Mermaid Ross Petty, Chilina Kennedy, Dan Chameroy, Jordan Clark, Eddie Glen, Marc Devigne, Reid Janisse [52] 2014 Cinderella Ross Petty, Danielle Wade, Dan Chameroy, Eddie Glen, Bryn McAuley, Cleopatra Williams, Jeff Lillico, Reid Janisse [53] 2015 Peter Pan Ross Petty, Anthony MacPherson, Steffi DiDomenicantonio, Eddie Glen, Jessica Holmes, Dan Chameroy [54] 2016 Sleeping Beauty AJ Bridel, Hilary Farr, James Daly, Paul Constable, Eddie Glen, Taveeta Szymanowicz, Alexandra Beaton, Lisa Horner, Laurie Murdoch [55] 2017 A Christmas Carol AJ Bridel, Cyrus Lane, Dan Chameroy, Eddie Glen, Kyle Golemba [56] 2018 Wizard of Oz Camille Eanga-Selenge, Eddie Glen, Sara-Jeanne Hosie, Michael De Rose, Eric Craig, Matt Nethersole, Daniel Williston [57] 2019 Lil' Red Robin Hood AJ Bridel, Eddie Glen, Robert Markus, Sara-Jeanne Hosie, Lawrence Libor, Daniel Williston [58] 2020 There’s No Place Like Home For The Holidays Camille Eanga-Selenge, Dan Chameroy, Eddie Glen, AJ Bridel, Sara-Jeanne Hosie, Alex Wierzbicki, Roberta Battaglia [59] 2021 Alice in Winterland Kimberly-Ann Truong, Dan Chameroy, Eddie Glen, Sara-Jeanne Hosie, Thom Allison [60] 2022 Peter's Final Flight: The Pan-Tastical Family Musical Ross Petty, Dan Chameroy, Eddie Glen, Sara-Jeanne Hosie, Alex Wierzbicki, Stephanie Sy [61]\n\n^a The 2020 production was a revue performed online due to the COVID-19 pandemic[62]\n\n^b The 2021 production was performed virtually due to pandemic restrictions.[63]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe has been married to former National Ballet of Canada dancer and artistic director, Karen Kain[1] since 1983.[64] The couple reside in Toronto.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
