        "text": "von Witzleben: What does the surname von Witzleben mean?\n\nThe surname von Witzleben is a German locational surname, derived from the place of Witzleben in Brandenburg-Prussia (now part of the state of Saxony-Anhalt). Witzleben was originally an estate belonging to a former noble family, the Lords of Witzleben. They are likely to have been descended from a noble line, the Counts of Mark, the landgraves of Meissen or the counts of Plötzkau.\n\nThe use of the term “von” (meaning “from” in German) usually implies a noble origin, as it indicates that the family is associated with a certain place. Some experts believe that the use of “von” may have begun to differentiate between nobles and non-nobles in the 14th century. The addition of the surname von Witzleben indicates that the original bearer of the name was likely either a former noble of Witzleben or a person who was connected to the area in some way.\n\nIn modern society, the surname von Witzleben is still common in many parts of Germany. It is also present in other countries with a large German population, such as Canada, the US and Australia. Many of the bearers of the surname today may not be related to the original noble family, but the “von” is often retained as a sort of symbol of past status and as a reminder to oneself of one’s own past.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nvon Witzleben: Where does the name von Witzleben come from?\n\nThe von Witzleben last name is a fairly rare surname today.
