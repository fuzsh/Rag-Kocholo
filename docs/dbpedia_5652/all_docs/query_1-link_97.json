        "text": "Might German Baron Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg become the King of the North? Could He Become \"the Beast\"?\n\nby COGwriter\n\nIn late 2009, it occurred to me that the then current German Defence Minister Baron Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg possibly could become the final \"Beast,\" the King of the North. In this article, I will give some reasons why he may be, as well as some reasons why he may not be.\n\nNote: This article is highly speculative at this time and I am not saying as of 2020 (or in earlier editions of this article) that Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg will become the King of the North, only providing some reasons and ideas why he might.\n\nThe Guardian gave some background about him:\n\nKarl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg does not have a snappy name. Perhaps that is why he is known in Bavaria as \"the Rocking Baron\". Unusually for a man whose family tree stretches back to the 12th century, the 37-year-old aristocrat has charisma and a glittering political future. In February he became Germany's youngest economics minister, and in Sunday's elections he won the highest percentage of constituency votes of any candidate. He became the envy of fellow politicians by attracting thousands of people to his rallies, a phenomenon not witnessed since Helmut Kohl. The Windsors should take note. As the leading contenders drained the colour from their campaigns by trying to say as little as possible, the young baron triumphed by being himself â a mixture of fiscal conservatism and an even-handed personality unafraid to challenge orthodoxy. He opposed the proposed buyout of Opel by a consortium led by the Canadian spare parts maker Magna and the Russian bank Sberbank, but he got plaudits for standing up to Angela Merkel. Guts are in the family genes. His great-grand-uncle, the Catholic monarchist Karl Ludwig von Guttenberg, was tortured by the Gestapo and shot after the failed assassination attempt on Hitler. He revealed no names of the fellow plotters. Mr Guttenberg does not need a job. He gets more than he needs from his family estate in Bavaria. If duty impels him, German politics will be all the richer. (Editorial. In praise of â¦ German aristocracy. The Guardian. Wednesday 30 September 2009. http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/30/in-praise-of-german-aristocracy viewed 30 April 2010)\n\nMany Have Thought and Do Think He has Major Leadership Potential\n\nIn late 2009, a Canadian writer reported:\n\nFor the first time Europe speaks with one voice, the low-key Flemish of President Herman Van Rompuy. ... Given the realities of geoeconomics it is not inconceivable that a far more dynamic leader such as German Economics Minister Karl Theodor von und zu Guttenberg might one day be in charge.\n\nIs the past key to the future? If one goes back five centuries China and India ruled the global economy. Turkey dominated the world of Islam. Europe suddenly came together under the leadership of the young dynamic Habsburg Charles V, who ruled from Belgium. Charles sought to halt the expansion of Islam, defend European civilization, unite the continent and forge a Latin American empire. Europe enjoyed a global reach under his reign, not only by military might but by âsoft powerâ and diplomacy.\n\nIf America declines, will Europe fill the vacuum, partly in response to the Chinese challenge? To some this seems unlikely but think back to the world of only a scant 10 years ago when the Anglo-American model of stakeholder capitalism stood triumphantly (and perhaps a tad arrogantly) and practically alone on the top of the heap, and how much has changed since then. (Moore K, Lewis D. The decline of America. Ottawa Citizen, Canada â Dec 24, 2009. Original URL: http://www.ottawacitizen.com/technology/decline+America/2377175/story.html; updated URL: https://ottawacitizen.com/news/the-decline-of-america)\n\nThe idea that a Habsburg may once again lead Europe was a teaching of the old Worldwide Church of God.\n\nIn 2010, a writer for Die Tageszeitung concluded:\n\nEurope needs a directly elected leader with charisma ('Europe Needs a Directly Elected Leader with Charisma'. Spiegel, 8 September, 2010. http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,716361,00.html)\n\nThe Bible warns of a strong leader who will rise up in the area north of Jerusalem (like Europe; see also (see also Jerusalem: Past, Present, and Future) that will apparently be charismatic (cf. Daniel 7:20,11:21-24,31; Revelation 13:3-5) and lead a confederation that does not stick well together (Daniel 2:42-43), like many of the nations of the European Union.\n\nHere is some information about about him and his family:\n\nBaron zu Guttenbergâs grandfather (his motherâs father) was the late German winemaker & Croatian politician the Count of Vukovar. From the Count, Baron zu Guttenberg is descended from the noble house of Elt z.. .At the ripe age of 70, the Count of Vukovar took up arms in defence of the town of Vukovar during the Yugoslav Wars of 1991...\n\nThe Baronâs wife, meanwhile, is Stephanie, Countess of Bismarck-SchÃ¶nhausen, great-great-granddaughter of the âIron Chancellorâ, Otto von Bismarck. A portent of this economics ministerâs future? (Cusack A. The Freiherr of Finance. October 5th, 2009, http://www.andrewcusack.com/2009/10/05/guttenberg-germany/ viewed 04/25/10).\n\nKarl-Theodor's mother, Christiane GrÃ¤fin und Edle Herrin von und zu Eltz genannt Faust von Stromberg (now Christiane Henkell-von Ribbentrop), is a member of the Eltz family, which has strong ties with Croatia. She is the daughter of Jakob von und zu Eltz, a former President of the Association of Winemakers in Rheingau who became active in Croatian politics after Croatian independence, and is related to the princely family of Liechtenstein and is also a descendant of the Habsburg-Lothringen imperial family, including Maria Theresa of Austria. (KARL THEODOR ZU GUTTENBERG. http://dictionnaire.sensagent.leparisien.fr/KARL%20THEODOR%20ZU%20GUTTENBERG/en-en/ accessed 05/14/18)\n\nSo, even in 2009, some started to wonder if the Baron (who was economics minister in mid-2009, and until March 2011 defense minister) might wind up in a much more influential role.\n\nIn 2011, the then 97 year-old former WWII codebreaker for the UK, Harry Beckhough put together a video where he stated he wanted:\n\n...to introduce to you the man that may well become the new FÃ¼hrer of Germany...Baron Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg...here is my man to watch as future FÃ¼hrer...more educated, more aristocratic...than Hitler (Europes New Fuhrer - by Harry Beckhough WW II Codebreaker, uploaded February 9, 2011. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LplCcxyPo4 viewed 20120501)\n\nNotice what his wife mentioned the following in an interview (machined translated from German to English):\n\nWhen we got married, I knew that he wanted to get involved politically.(Und plÃ¶tzlich ist dein Mann Minister. Bild, 15 02 2009. http://www.bild.de/BILD/politik/2009/02/15/bundeswirtschaftsminister-guttenberg-ehefrau/stephanie-im-interview.html)\n\nSo, the Baron has long had political ambitions.\n\nHe has been considered to be focused perhaps more than he should be on his public image according to certain German-language news sources (Ramelsberger A. Guttenberg's Ground Zero show. 13 September 2011 http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/ex-minister-in-new-york-guttenbergs-ground-zero-show-1.1142531; Comeback at Ground Zero. 12 September 2011 http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/die-guttenbergs-in-der-bild-zeitung-comeback-am-ground-zero-1726942.html). The final Beast likely will be as well (cf. Daniel 8:25).\n\nNotice also the following:\n\nNovember 29, 2013\n\nBERLIN - No German politician of the post-war era has had such a meteoric rise, and precipitous fall from grace, as Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the Bavarian baron who fled Berlin for New York in 2011, his career in tatters over accusations of plagiarism.At his peak in 2009, when he served as economy and then defense minister, Guttenberg was seen as a potential successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel...\n\nGermany had never seen a politician like him. A descendant of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor in the late 18th century, Guttenberg attended AC/DC concerts at night, had a glamorous wife, and could point to a family of Nazi resisters -- his grandfather is said to have narrowly escaped execution after saying that he'd rather kill SS officers than Jews...\n\nSince leaving Germany two years ago, Guttenberg has lived with his wife Stephanie -- a great-great grand daughter of the first German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck -- and two daughters in the wealthy New York suburb of Greenwich, Connecticut.He is a non-resident \"distinguished statesman\" at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington and serves as ambassador for a European Commission initiative to promote internet freedom.But until recently, he had kept a relatively low profile in Germany, returning home \"rather frequently but very silently\", he told Reuters in a recent telephone interview.That changed earlier this month when Merkel received him in the Chancellery for a one hour \"secret\" meeting that was leaked to the media. What the two discussed remains a mystery, but the encounter was seen by some as a test of the public mood for a Guttenberg comeback....\n\nCan he rehabilitate himself?One problem is that Guttenberg has never really accepted the plagiarism charge, even after the University of Bayreuth, which awarded him a Ph.D. in 2006, ruled he had \"extensively violated academic standards and intentionally cheated.\"In Germany, politicians are expected to be above reproach and Guttenberg would have a tough time winning back the support of a German media that feels burned and betrayed by the man they made a star.But time has a way of healing old wounds, and Guttenberg is only 41 years old...\n\nHe can't return now -- the memory of the mother of all plagiarisms is still too sharp in people's minds,\" said Juergen Falter, a political scientist at Mainz University.\"But could it happen in a few years from now? Sure, it's possible. Guttenberg is still very popular, even among some Social Democrats. You have to go back to a young Helmut Schmidt to find a German politician with his charisma.\" Â http://mobilebeta.reuters.com/fallen-baron-fuels-debate-in-germany-from-ny-exile\n\nHe rose quickly once and may very well do so again.\n\nNow while it is not absolutely sure at this date who will be the final Beast leader (AKA King of the North), Baron zu Guttenberg is a candidate of interest. He even has referred to himself as a type of a beast:\n\n\"There's no doubt whatsoever that I'm a political animal, a 'zoon politicon',\" he told Die Zeit newspaper in what appeared to be a carefully orchestrated comeback after eight months away from the spotlight. Â http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/11/24/idINIndia-60716820111124\n\n\"For Aristotle's zoon politikon there are no persons beyond the walls of the city; outside the city there exist only beasts or gods.\"\n\npage 169, Urbanization and values, CRVP, 1991, By George F. McLean, John Kromkowski\n\nIf Karl zu Guttenberg becomes the King of the North (Daniel 11:36-40), he would also be the final Beast of Revelation. Interestingly, a comedic spoof of Karl zu Guttenberg was premiered on March 4, 2013 (see Baron Guttenberg does not show up for premier spoofing him). A line that was supposed to be in it was as follows:\n\n“I carry myself with the thought, a zoon politikon to be,” says the film-Guttenberg, who is here from Franz Ferdinand and Thunder Mountain and in Berlin shaking the fence of the Chancellery.\n\n„Ich trage mich mit dem Gedanken, ein Zoon Politikon zu werden“, verkÃ¼ndet der Film-Guttenberg, der hier Franz Ferdinand von und zu Donnersberg heiÃt und in Berlin am Zaun des Kanzleramts rÃ¼ttelt.\n\nhttp://www.focus.de/kultur/diverses/komoedie-ueber-kapitel-der-deutschen-politik-guttenberg-film-auf-den-spuren-von-schtonk_aid_824451.html\n\nThus, various ones in Germany, at least, realize that the Baron called himself a type of political Beast. Many will be surprised if he does turn out to be the Beast warned against in biblical prophecy.\n\nHerr Guttenberg still draws crowds:\n\n1 September 2017\n\nMore than 1,000 people queued to crowd into a hall in the small Bavarian town of Kulmbach this week for a German parliamentary election rally. Hundreds more sat in the foyers or stood outside to watch the event on television screens. A stranger might have thought that chancellor Angela Merkel was heading the bill. Instead the speaker was a local politician who is not even standing in this month’s parliamentary poll: Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. Widely seen as one of the few German politicians with genuine crowd-pulling power, Mr zu Guttenberg was once a rising star of German politics. ...\n\nHis allies in the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, which campaigns jointly with Ms Merkel’s Christian Democrats, appealed for his return.\n\nNow, six years on, the 45-year-old prince from across the water is back â at least for the September 24 election. In Kulmbach, he spoke effortlessly without notes for 75 minutes: self-deprecatingly, he joked that he could not have read out a written speech because someone might have thought it was plagiarised. He was “brilliant”, said a spectator. “Captivating,” said another. “A real noble,” said a third, suggesting that the advantages of birth still count, at least among people whose ancestors were zu Guttenberg underlings. One man held a banner saying: “The saviour of us all.” ...\n\nBild, the top-selling newspaper, pictured Mr zu Guttenberg and his wife Stephanie â a descendant of 19th-century statesman Otto von Bismarck â on its front page with the headline: “The return of the Guttenbergs.” Werner Weidenfeld, head of the Centre for Applied Policy Research in Munich, who has known Mr zu Guttenberg for a decade, says: “He is a charismatic politician in a political landscape not overloaded with charisma.” https://www.ft.com/content/14073d00-8f11-11e7-a352-e46f43c5825d accessed 09/06/18\n\nNotice that Herr Guttenberg was called “The saviour of us all.” Well, Jesus is the Saviour (1 Timothy 4:10; Acts 4:10-12; 2 Peter 3:17-18). But the Bible warns about a Beast that will appear to many, particularly in Europe, as the one who will deliver them from problems (e.g. Daniel 11:23-24) and that will be worshipped (Revelation 13:1-8).\n\nThere are certain \"Catholic\" prophecies about a leader often called the \"Great Monarch,\" who is supposed to save Catholicism and become the Emperor of an end-time \"Holy Roman Empire\" (see also The Great Monarch: Biblical and Greco-Roman Catholic Prophecies). Notice the following \"Catholic\" writings:\n\nFather Laurence Ricci, S.J. (died 1775): At a time when the whole world seems doomed, God will intervene. With His aide a valiant duke will arise from the ancient German house which was humiliated by the French monarch. This great ruler will restore stolen Church property. Protestantism will cease ... This duke will be the most powerful monarch on earth. At a gathering of men noted for piety and wisdom he will, with the aid of the Pope, introduce new rules, and ban the spirit of confusion. Everywhere there will be one fold and one shepherd.\" (Conner p.37)\n\nWerdin d' Otrante (13th century): \"The Great Monarch and the Great Pope will precede Antichrist...All the sects will vanish. The capital of the world will fall...The Great Monarch will come and restore peace and the Pope will share in the victory.\" (Connor, Edward. Prophecy for Today. Imprimatur + A.J. Willinger, Bishop of Monterey-Fresno; Reprint: Tan Books and Publishers, Rockford (IL), 1984, p. 33).\n\nSeveral private prophecies of canonized Saints specifically state that there will be a latter restoration of the Holy Roman Empire and that there will be at least one last Holy Roman Emperor. The authenticity of the authorship of such prophecies of canonized Saints (e.g., St. Hildegard, St. Vincent Ferrer, St. Francis of Paula, and St. John Vianney) at least over the last eight hundred years is scholastically unquestionable. (Birch, DA. Trial, Tribulation & Triumph: Before During and After Antichrist. Queenship Publishing Company, Goleta (CA), 1996, p. 281).\n\nSome of the prophecies involving the \"Great Monarch\" seem to be discussing the same individual that the Bible calls the final \"King of the North\" (Daniel 11) and the final \"Beast\" (Revelation 13). Because of this, many \"Catholic\" (including Eastern Orthodox) prophecies will be included in this article.\n\n(For more on the Great Monarch, check out the article: The Great Monarch: Biblical and Greco-Roman Catholic Prophecies.)\n\nSome still are wondering about him politically:\n\nDoes Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg want to gain a foothold in Germany again?\n\nIn the lobby affair surrounding Philipp Amthor, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg is a dazzling marginal figure. There are rumors surrounding his return to the political stage.\n\nJune 27, 2020\n\nThe affair with the ominous start-up Augustus Intelligence, to which both Amthor and Guttenberg had business ties, not only marks the (preliminary) end of a steep career for a young conservative from Mecklenburg. The best side effect of the debate is probably that it should finally give momentum to efforts to increase lobbying transparency in the Bundestag.\n\nIn addition, however, the events cast new light on the baron, who is still haunted by German and Bavarian politics. Sometimes he does that as a promise, sometimes as a threat, it depends on the perspective.\n\nIn any case, it is still the case even after years in exile in America. In his prime, Guttenberg once had an aura somewhere between conservative Barack Obama and Tom Cruise. Political operations do not forget something like this so quickly; simply because it’s so rare.\n\nHis wife and he were considered a political dream couple, on the best way to the Chancellery. Until, yes, until a doctoral thesis came in between, Guttenberg has put together a few jokes over the years. This demonstrative self-irony bathed in refinement is generally very well received.\n\nBut what is Guttenberg doing today? Where and how exactly is he working outside of Augustus Intelligence? And could he possibly actually return to the big political federal stage again? â¦\n\nThe following can only be considered fairly certain: Guttenberg assumes that some have a deep longing for a return to politics, driven by the idea of ââfull rehabilitation, reparation. â¦\n\n“Honestly, Guttenberg no longer plays a political role,” says a CDU MP. “Karl-Theodor is a great communicator, but he definitely lacks substance,” says a CSU student. â¦\n\nThe fact that Stephanie zu Guttenberg recently told the “Gala” about a family return to Germany is causing talk in the capital. Some spread the rumor that “KT” is looking for an electoral district for the return to the Bundestag, others consider that to be empty talk, even nonsense. 06/27/20 https://www.web24.news/u/2020/06/does-karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg-want-to-gain-a-foothold-in-germany-again.html\n\nKT may not have much of a political role in 2020, but he still has one. One that may greatly increase in the future.\n\nKarl Guttenberg Has Remained in the Public Eye Giving Political Commentary\n\nDespite not holding public office, Herr Guttenberg has remained in the public eye. He writes and sometimes is interviewed by the news media.\n\nHe seems to promote an agenda that he wants to lead Europe. In certain respects, he reminds me of the late Winston Churchill.\n\nHe warned about Russia and Europe (see Karl zu Guttenberg on Germany’s change of relationship with Russia; Ukraine a wake-up call).\n\nHe has also been warning about what is happening with the USA and its relationship with Europe. Here are links to reports of a May 2014 and a July 2014 interview of him on CNN: Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg on CNN tells of selective anti-Americanism growing in Germany and Karl Guttenberg on USA espionage and damage to US-German relations; He calls Obama the ‘most detached President’ in decades.\n\nKarl-Theodor zu Guttenberg had an article in the WallÂ Street Journal and that made the news in Germany on September 4, 2014 (the German article was machine-translated):\n\nKarl-Theodor zu Guttenberg has accused the Europeans in drastic words failure and blindness in the face of crises in the Ukraine and the Middle East. The conservative American newspaper “Wall Street Journal” published on Thursday a long contribution of the former German defense minister , in which he goes hard with the American government and especially with the EU to court. “While the government of the United States is obviously overwhelmed by the variety and severity of crises, with which it is confronted, it makes the European politicians not even something that they do not know what to do,” writes Guttenberg. In allusion to Christopher Clark’s book “The Sleepwalkers” about the outbreak of the First World War, the CSU-man referred to the European leaders of today as “Sleepwalkers”, the “do not realize the consequences of their inaction.”\n\nThe EU Summit, where Heads of State and Government decided last weekend to rule within a week on new sanctions against Russia, Guttenberg calls a “beauty contest”. European politicians would find still reasons why the EU is not functioning. “But Eurocrats Excuses keep the soil does not depend on further turn,” Guttenberg holds.\n\n“Delusional Rapture”\n\nEuropean citizens and their politicians he accused of “delusional rapture” before, because they do not take threats beyond their limit seriously. Even after the launch of the Malaysian passenger plane over eastern Ukraine “there was no EU-wide shock and dismay,” says the former minister. He is convinced that Russia would not be content with the Eastern Ukraine, “if it is not stopped.” As Russia would stop, Guttenberg says.\n\nIn the Middle East he sees a failure of Europeans who do not understand to use their influence on Israel and the Palestinians. For Gaza war Europe had produced only “useless press releases and a two-sided design on the reconstruction of Gaza”. The German, who now leads a consulting firm in America, does not mention the offer of Berlin and other European powers to contribute by sending observers to resolve the Middle East conflict. A corresponding European foray in the UN Security Council seems, however, currently stuck in New York.\n\nThe original German text:\n\nKarl-Theodor zu Guttenberg hat den EuropÃ¤ern in drastischen Worten Versagen und Blindheit angesichts der Krisen in der Ukraine und im Nahen Osten vorgeworfen. Die konservative amerikanische Zeitung „Wall Street Journal“ verÃ¶ffentlichte am Donnerstag einen langen Beitrag des frÃ¼heren deutschen Verteidigungsministers, in dem er hart mit der amerikanischen Regierung und vor allem mit der EU ins Gericht geht. „WÃ¤hrend die Regierung der Vereinigten Staaten offenkundig von der Vielfalt und Schwere der Krisen Ã¼berwÃ¤ltigt ist, mit denen sie konfrontiert ist, macht es den europÃ¤ischen Politikern nicht einmal etwas aus, dass sie nicht wissen, was sie tun sollen“, schreibt Guttenberg. In Anspielung auf Christopher Clarks Buch „Die Schlafwandler“ Ã¼ber den Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs bezeichnet der CSU-Mann die fÃ¼hrenden europÃ¤ischen Politiker von heute als „Schlafwandler“, die „die Folgen ihrer Tatenlosigkeit nicht erkennen“.\n\nDen EU-Gipfel, auf dem die Staats- und Regierungschefs am vorigen Wochenende beschlossen, innerhalb einer Woche Ã¼ber neue Sanktionen gegen Russland zu befinden, nennt Guttenberg einen „SchÃ¶nheitswettbewerb“. EuropÃ¤ische Politiker fÃ¤nden immer noch BegrÃ¼ndungen dafÃ¼r, warum die EU nicht handlungsfÃ¤hig sei. „Aber Eurokraten-Entschuldigungen halten die Erde nicht davon ab, sich weiterzudrehen“, hÃ¤lt Guttenberg fest.\n\n„Wahnhafte EntrÃ¼ckung“\n\nDen europÃ¤ischen BÃ¼rgern und ihren Politikern wirft er „wahnhafte EntrÃ¼ckung“ vor, weil sie Bedrohungen jenseits ihrer Grenze nicht ernst nÃ¤hmen. Selbst nach dem Abschuss des malaysischen Passagierflugzeugs Ã¼ber der Ostukraine „gab es nicht EU-weiten Schock und BestÃ¼rzung“, behauptet der frÃ¼here Minister. Er gibt sich Ã¼berzeugt, dass Russland sich nicht mit der Ostukraine begnÃ¼gen werde, „sofern es nicht gestoppt wird“. Wie Russland zu stoppen wÃ¤re, sagt Guttenberg nicht.\n\nAuch im Nahen Osten sieht er ein Versagen der EuropÃ¤er, die ihren Einfluss auf Israel und die PalÃ¤stinenser nicht zu nutzen verstÃ¼nden. Zum Gaza-Krieg habe Europa nur „nutzlose PresseerklÃ¤rungen und einen zweiseitigen Entwurf Ã¼ber den Wiederaufbau von Gaza“ hervorgebracht. Der Deutsche, der inzwischen in Amerika ein Beratungsunternehmen fÃ¼hrt, erwÃ¤hnt nicht das Angebot Berlins und anderer europÃ¤ischer MÃ¤chte, durch eine Entsendung von Beobachtern zur LÃ¶sung des Nahost-Konflikts beizutragen. Ein entsprechender europÃ¤ischer VorstoÃ im UN-Sicherheitsrat scheint in New York allerdings derzeit festzustecken. Â http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/frueherer-verteidigungsminister-guttenberg-rechnet-mit-deutschland-ab-13135817.html\n\nHere is how that Wall Street Journal article byÂ Baron Guttenberg begins:\n\nSeptember 3, 2014\n\nThe European Union named new leadership on Saturday. Yet the latest EU summit in Brussels was just another beauty contest with layers of geopolitical cosmetics, lacking any promise of a new beginning. After months of institutional paralysis, European leaders still find ways to rationalize why the EU is not ready to act. In the past year, national and European-level elections and then the summer break have left the EU in an extended freeze.\n\nBut Eurocratic excuses don’t stop the Earth from spinning. http://online.wsj.com/articles/karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg-the-return-of-europes-sleepwalkers-1409786698\n\nTo me, he is acting a bit like Winston Churchill.Â He is telling the Europeans that they need to take the lead,Â but they are afraid to do so.Â Winston Churchill made all types of warnings before World War II, and ended up leading the UK to fight in that war.Â Herr Guttenberg is seemingly making comments that could put him in a position that people in Europe will turn to him to lead the fight that could be called World War III (see also World War III: Steps in Progress).\n\nOn Ripple and Blockchain\n\nIn 2014, Herr Guttenberg was appointed to the advisory board of an electronic payment firm called Ripple. Here is a link to some comments from Ripple: https://ripple.com/insights/karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg-joins-ripple-labs-advisory-board/\n\nHere are some comments from someone who read the above a few years after I did:\n\nI found an interesting article about the Baron becoming an advisor to a new Bitcoin competitor. They ask him many questions and you get some candid insights as to how he thinks the Ripple proticol can 'redefine theÂ environment of (international) financial transactions'. He believes a 'widespread adoption of Ripple will also provide a welcome boost to global development' and could see a reduction of the price of things around the world by 3pc and will have great benefits for international trade! Sounds like the merchents of the Earth would love that and mourn it's loss (Rev 18:11).Â\n\nThe difference between Ripple and Bitcoin is that Ripple will be working within the international banking and governmental systems unlike Bitcoin. I think that this Ripple protocol could be the way it will go and Bitcoin will be left behind.. Guttenberg also believes that within 2-3 years we could begin to see changes and that over the next 5-10 years it is hard to see what the world would look like and as Guttenberg states 'this is what makes the technology so exciting'.\n\nOne last thing he responded with to a qustion caught my attention. The questioner wanted to know what he beklieved he could offer to Ripple Labs as an advisor? He focused on his political experience but then went on to mention that within a fragile ecosystem that Ripple Labs will need to make 'informed and prudent decisions'. So the Baron believes that his widom and prudence are his greatest attributes he can offer them. I know of a certain king of the North in Isaiah 10:13 who also thinks he is wise and prudent:\n\nÂ “By the strength of my hand I have done it,\n\nAnd by my wisdom, for I am prudent;\n\nAnd, yes, Herr Guttenberg does seem to believe he has much to offer the world.\n\nBack in 2014, I posted the following:\n\nA reader sent me the following which he said was basically machine-translated:\n\nRipple Labs: Guttenberg is now in Cyber-Currency\n\nThe traditional payment system is “antiquated, expensive and inefficient”, says ex-Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. So he turns now to the digital financial world and starts as a consultant for Start-up Ripple Labs.\n\n12.07.2014\n\nSan Francisco â The former Economic- and Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg joint the American Start-up Ripple Labs as consultant. He wants to help the company, which is specialized in money transfers, “to circumvent the regulatory pitfalls”, Guttenberg told the “Wirtschaftswoche” according to an earlier information on Saturday. According to the report Ripple Labs is working to make transfers as easy as sending an emailâ¦\n\nGuttenberg said: “The traditional payment system is antiquated, expensive and inefficient.” The market for Cyber-Currency is still in its infancy “but the invention of this technology cannot be reversed”, Guttenberg said. The former politician emerges now on the company website as one of eight advisers.\n\nThe former ‘man of Â hope’ of the CSU was Minister of Economic Affairs and took over the defense portfolio in autumn 2009. Beginning of 2011 Guttenberg, stepped down after the University of Bayreuth had denied him the title ‘doctor’, because of plagiarism. He then moved with his family to the United States.Â http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg-arbeitet-jetzt-fuer-start-up-ripple-labs-a-980675.html\n\nHere is something that Ripple Labs said about him:\n\nRipple Labs is thrilled to announce that Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg is joining theÂ advisory board. Mr. zu GuttenbergÂ is the Chairman and a Founder of Spitzberg Partners LLC, a New York-based boutique corporate advisory and investment firm that provides strategic counsel and investment insights on European and international political, economic, diplomatic, technology, and security issues.\n\nHeÂ served as Minister of Economics and Technology and then as Minister of Defense in the cabinet of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. As the youngest Defense Minister in German history, he led the most significant structural reform of the German armed forces since the Bundeswehr’s founding. During his time in office, Minister zu Guttenberg was Germany’s most popular politician.\n\nMr.Â zu Guttenberg was a Member of Parliament (Bundestag) during 2002-2011 and served as spokesman on the Foreign Affairs Committee. HeÂ was also a Member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and Secretary General of Germany’s co-governing CSU party.\n\nHerr Guttenberg is one I have in mind as a possible future King of the North or supporter of that king.Â Knowledge of buying and selling with technology in the 21st century would be quite helpful for the final Beast power.Â Back on December 13, 2011 (see Guttenberg Criticized, Butâ¦), I reported the following about Baron Guttenberg:\n\nNotice some prophecies related to the Beast and his empire:\n\n15 He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.Â 18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.Â (Revelation 13:15-18)\n\nThe fact that the Baron is to advise about internet security and surveillance may encourage him to press to get the above implemented.Â The fact that he was once Economics Minister for Germany also gives him additional qualifications to possibly help fulfill Revelation 13:15-18.\n\nHis new role is consistent with that.Â Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg keeps taking steps consistent with one who could be the final Beast.Â While he has not yet publicly pressed to get Revelation 13:16-18 implemented, his background and interests show he is one who will likely understand enough technology to do so. (Thiel B. Europe eliminating remaining ‘bank secrecy’ as it gets closer to Revelation 13:16-18. COGwriter, October 22, 2014)\n\nAnd has he taken steps consistent with that?\n\nNotice the following:\n\nMay 15, 2017\n\nThe former head of Germany's armed forces is now helping to bring blockchain tech to some of the world's largest financial institutions.\n\nAn early advisor to distributed financial technology firm Ripple, not to mention a bonafide German baron, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg today plays a key role in enabling the heavily funded startup to make inroads in the banking sector. But as co-founder of consultancy Spitzberg Partners, he is setting his sights beyond finance.\n\nOver the course of his time at both the Ministry of Defense andÂ Minister of Economics &Â Technology, zu Guttenberg built up an extensive network of global politicians, technologists and bankers.\n\nLong rumored to be a potential candidate to replace his former boss, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, zu Guttenberg last month revealed exclusively to CoinDesk that his firm had partnered with the State of Delaware's blockchain initiative to help bring a global tech cohort to the tiny US state.\n\nNow, he says his firm has taken on a \"significant portion\" of blockchain companies as clients and is consolidating those resources to focus on a concerted push to bring the technology to the world.\n\nAt Spitzberg’s New York City headquarters, zu Guttenberg explained how the work he's conducting in Delaware, with Ripple and with other blockchain firms, is part of a larger plan.\n\nZu Guttenberg told CoinDesk:\n\n\"I always tell the dreamers in the bitcoin community and the blockchain community, don't expect that this will happen at one point and everyone is enlightened. It will be a bumpy process.\" ...\n\nThough Ripple has set legacy financial technology firm Swift square in its sights, zu Guttenberg said that Ripple’s secret to widespread adoption has been recognizing when to play nice with other legacy platforms.\n\n\"Many of these players, although they are sitting on already rotten instruments or structures, will be in place, and in power,\" he said. \"[TheyÂ will be] dramatically empowered by political circles for quite a while and they're still extremely influential.\"\n\nGlobal vision\n\nTo help modernize those legacy systems, though, Ripple will require more than just a willingness to play nice with banks. Government support is crucial.\n\nZu Guttenberg cited smaller nations such as Estonia and Singapore, and jurisdictions including the Zug region of Switzerland and Delaware, as fundamental testing grounds for the types of legislation that might one day underpin a new financial infrastructure.\n\nWhile he said the topic of how blockchain is being adopted by governments comes up organically in his meetings with leaders around the world,Â zu Guttenberg argued that the push to bring blockchain into widespread adoption will require a more concerted effort.\n\n\"People [need to] deliver the experiences from these test runs to other governments, to old industry and back to the blockchain industry.\"\n\nHe concluded:\n\n\"That doesn't happen by itself and we're delighted to be at that intersection.\"\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/meet-the-german-baron-who-thinks-blockchain-will-beat-the-middlemen/\n\nBlockchain may well be used by governments for monitoring (see also Bitcoin and the Beast of Revelation?).\n\nOn Politics, Donald Trump, Technology, and Europe's Future\n\nIn December 2015, former German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg called Donald Trump \"that blonde lunatic named Donald\" (Guttenberg KT. Wish List or Reality? Digital Trends in 2016 | Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg | hub conference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgdZUA96UBU. Posted December 11, 2015).\n\nThe Hub Conference claimed that it \"brings pioneers and champions of the digital future\" together. My comments about it and to hear what Baron Guttenberg had to say are in the video: Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg and Europe’s Future.\n\nIn that same presentation, he decried that the \"tech world and political world could not be more detached from each other.\" He also said he wanted to stop terrorists from utilizing encryption technologies that governments could not break. He made it clear he wanted to change that.\n\nHe talked about using the \"power\" of community standards\" to police the internet. He mentioned that about, not only terrorists, but said \"other kinds of questionable content.\" The Bible warns of the following time:\n\n11 \"Behold, the days are coming,\" says the Lord God,\n\n\"That I will send a famine on the land,\n\nNot a famine of bread,\n\nNor a thirst for water,\n\nBut of hearing the words of the Lord.\n\n12 They shall wander from sea to sea,\n\nAnd from north to east;\n\nThey shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the Lord,\n\nBut shall not find it. (Amos 8:11-12)\n\nIt has long been my view that this prophecy will involve internet censorship, and Baron Guttenberg seems to approve it.\n\nIn 2017, Herr Guttenberg urged Germany to do more because of the rise of Donald Trump:\n\nFormer Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg has called on Germany to become more self-assertive with Donald Trump, a president who he believes may well bring about an era of “erratic” politics. â¦\n\nformer German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg has called on Berlin to ditch what he called its “passive, wait-and-see” attitude towards the United States and nurture “a culture of responsibility” instead.\n\nIn a guest column in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, published Friday, the former conservative politician said Mr. Trump’s rise was a time for the German government to “be prepared to do more.” 01/20/17 https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/time-for-tough-talk-with-trump-687154\n\nKarl-Theodor zu Guttenberg was interviewed on Fox Business Network’s Mornings with Maria in May 2017, about Donald Trump’s plans to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, he stated:\n\nI think this will weaken the US’s position on the international stage. I think the reaction will be harsh on the other side of the Atlantic. And I fear that might zero into further tensions into other topics. http://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/exiting-paris-agreement-will-weaken-us-kt-zu-guttenberg/vp-BBBJzIO\n\nMany in Europe agree with Herr Guttenberg’s assessment of Donald Trump.\n\nin 2019, Herr Guttenberg told CNBC some of his views of Donald Trump and Germany:\n\nTrump has repeatedly called on NATO allies like Germany to increase contributions toward defense, often criticizing them for not complying with a commitment to spend 2% of their gross domestic product (GDP). But Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the former German defense minister, doubted whether Germany would ever reach that target.\n\n“Will Donald Trump ever be happy? Probably not, even if they come to these numbers, which I think is more or less impossible, he will just find the next thing to throw at Germany, or not even at Germany, whomever pleases him at that very moment,” he told CNBC’s Geoff Cutmore in Salzburg, Austria.\n\nThe relationship between the United States and Germany has been somewhat tense since Trump took over at the White House, especially in areas such as trade and foreign relations ...\n\n“It is rather dangerous,” zu Guttenberg told CNBC about the situation. “I don’t expect anyone stepping deliberately into a war. I talk to many stakeholders in the U.S. political spectrum and everyone says even Donald Trump â who is always good for a surprise at that’s the mildest phrase I can find for his political acting â doesn’t have an interest at all to ruin his re-election chances for next year by waging a war against Iran. On the other hand, talking to stakeholders from the region over there, they are afraid, and they say we have never been as close to war as right now,” zu Guttenberg, who also served as German economy minister, said.\n\n“We are now at a threshold, if we have an accident, just an accident, it could ignite (tensions) even more right away and the one thing that worries me the most (is) we have never been as disunited in the so-called Western part of the group of six,” he added. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/ex-german-defense-chief-questions-calls-for-increased-nato-spend.html\n\nSo, Baron Guttenberg has concluded that it is impossible to please Donald Trump and that he will always be against Germany.\n\nIn November 2023, he was asked about the 'Trump effect' again:\n\nIs Donald Trump a threat to world peace if he is reelected?” German talk show host Sandra Maischberger asked former Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg on November 14. ...\n\nGuttenberg’s main concern appears to be a Trump comeback, stating:\n\nIt wouldn’t be a pleasure for us, because he is not a friend of the trans-Atlantic alliance. He is not a friend of the Germans; we saw that already. The chances are relatively high, because many Americans have their fist in their pocket, including Republicans, and say this is likely the greatest scumbag that we ever had in U.S. politics, that’s how it was told me personally. But he has done one thing: He delivered. He was one of the few that has implemented his, yes crude and crazy, promises. If someone likes it or not.\n\nThis is one of many warnings that Guttenberg has uttered about Trump since he ran for the presidency in 2016. Following Trump’s election victory, Guttenberg told Bild: “This is a result that shakes up the world.”\n\nOn multiple occasions, Guttenberg has called on Europe to become independent of the U.S. because of Trump. In 2019, he told Gerzo Media, “Let’s finally get to terms with things we should have done by ourselves already for decades. Let’s create a European structure for our armed forces and let’s create ideas for how to deal with our neighborhood without the U.S.” (Michaels J. Guttenberg: The Return of the ‘Blond Bully’ Threatens World Peace. November 21, 2023)\n\nSince Herr Guttenberg is pro-Germany, his conclusion will influence his attitude towards the USA.\n\nThe Bible shows that Europe will ultimately turn to a ‘strongman’ of its own in Revelation 17:12-13âone who is able to monitor buying and selling.\n\nThis may very well be Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg.\n\nAt the Hub conference, Herr Guttenberg also mentioned that he wants to put criminal penalties on internet and other technological companies that will not do as the government wants. He also discussed what he called the trade off between security and privacy. The Bible tells of a time when privacy will lose:\n\n13 Therefore the prudent keep silent at that time, For it is an evil time. (Amos 5:13)\n\n15 He was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 16 He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 17 and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.\n\n18 Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666. (Revelation 13:15-18)\n\nHe also mentioned that the political environment was \"too toxic\" to resolve these and other issues in 2016. He said that there was growing anti-Americanism in Germany because of the Snowden leaks that had still not been resolved. And he blamed the USA for causing a lot of this.\n\nHe seemed, overall in the Hub speech, to sound like a statesman that wants to peaceably lead Europe. The Bible tells of one who will do something like that in the future:\n\n24 He shall enter peaceably, even into the richest places of the province; and he shall do what his fathers have not done, nor his forefathers: he shall disperse among them the plunder, spoil, and riches; and he shall devise his plans against the strongholds, but only for a time. (Daniel 11:24)\n\nHe stated that he wanted a strong \"European voice to confront the USA strongly.\" He also said:\n\nEncyrption ... I see Europe in the driver's seat ... We don't have to give the other side of the Atlantic the forefront ... Artificial intelligence ... Robotics ... We should never underestimate what we have over here. (Guttenberg KT. Wish List or Reality? Digital Trends in 2016 | Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg | hub conference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgdZUA96UBU. Posted December 11, 2015).\n\nNot long afterwards, Time reported:\n\nDecember 21, 2015\n\nFor all the rhetoric from U.S. presidential candidates, Washington can no longer even pretend to play global police officer, because public support isn’t there for any action that might require long-term commitments of U.S. troops and taxpayer dollars. You may get a majority to say it’s time to send ground troops after ISIS, but Obama knows that support won’t last. The ugly response to the massacre in San Bernardino, Calif., suggests that U.S. public reaction to a major terrorist attack will not be as unified as it was after 9/11. And even if such an attack compelled the U.S. to act, it may have to act aloneâthere are now too many important international players with the political and economic self-confidence to simply ignore Washington’s lead.\n\nThat’s true even of allies. Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, former German Defense Minister, warns of an erosion in transatlantic trust, exacerbated by the U.S. presidential-election season. The campaign anthem will be “forget Europe,” he saysâand it won’t come only from Donald Trump. http://time.com/4154044/geopolitics-2016/\n\nNotice also the following:\n\nFebruary 26, 2016\n\nThere was a time when Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg was widely tipped to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor of Germany. Good-looking, aristocratic, married to a descendant of Bismarck and beloved by the popular press, zu Guttenberg had cut a dash, first as a decisive economics minister, and then as Germany’s youngest defence minister â appointed at the age of 37 in 2009. And then, in two disastrous weeks in early 2011, his gilded career fell apart, after it was revealed that he had plagiarised large parts of his doctoral thesis. Within two weeks,Â zu Guttenberg had resignedÂ from the German government. Shortly afterwards, he left for a career in business in the US.\n\nEver since zu Guttenberg stepped down, there has been speculation about his return to German politics. Now, with Chancellor Merkel in deep political trouble overÂ Germany’s refugee crisis, might this be a time for him to resurrect his political career? ...\n\nZu Guttenberg’s line, then and now, was that he had been unaware of the many instances of plagiarism in his work â that it was all simply the result of sloppy research practices, carried out at a busy time in his life. But he also thinks that, in retrospect, he had been riding for a fall â “I’d been irrationally hyped, way too highâ.â.â.âIt was far from reality, at least in my own perceptionsâ.â.â.âLooking back that was one of the mistakes I made, that I allowed it, that I didn’t actively counter it, but that’s extremely difficult when the whole thing is rolling.” He is smiling a lot, as he talks about this painful episode. “I talked with a lot of friends about it in that crazy hyped period that the moment necessarily must come that it tips in the other direction â.â.â.âI did not expect the story that came up, not at all, and this really hit me by total surprise. But again, looking back now, I’ve been in the wonderful situation to experience probably all the extremes that political life can offer.”\n\nHis words sound genuine. But they are also couched in terms of learning and redemption that might prove useful, were he ever planning a return to German politics. How often does he go back to Germany? “At the moment, I’d say probably about once a month, but mainly for a board meeting or an investment. Or I might give a speech, to test an ideaâ.â.â.âIt’s about learning, learning, learning.”\n\nGiven all these uncertainties, I ask, “Are you getting calls from Germany saying come on back, things are â.â.â.â” He interrupts me, before I complete the sentence â “Yes, more in the last couple of months.”\n\nWhat kind of people?\n\n“It differs. Sometimes it’s just people on the street who recognise me, with the beard and everything. Also the party.”\n\nSo what do you say?\n\n“I have a responsibility over here. The company.” He adds that his business, which invests in technology companies has done “extremely well. A bit surprisingly well”.\n\nThis denial of political ambition sounds almost convincing. ...\n\nAs we sip our coffees, we discuss the Trump phenomenon. For zu Guttenberg, it is further evidence that politics is “becoming dirtier and dirtier. The new media don’t help here â.â.â.âI still struggle with myself, whether I am capable of doing that.”\n\nI am slightly surprised by this apparent humility and remark that I cannot remember many politicians who have turned down the top job on the grounds that they are not up to it. The presidency of the US might be an impossible job, I point out, but somebody has to do it. Zu Guttenberg looks thoughtful and replies: “Somebody has to and of course, there is not a perfect figure for any political position. I think to know you are constantly working with and around your own deficits is already a very helpful starting point.” If that is a job application â it is one couched in strikingly modest terms. http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d938bd56-db12-11e5-98fd-06d75973fe09.html\n\nHerr Guttenberg has been using modest terms. In my view, should he arise, it will make it easier for him to not be closely compared to people like Adolf Hitler and Donald Trump.\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected, notice also the following news item in German, followed by a machine-translated version into English:\n\nyeDer Ausgang der US-Wahl sendet Schockwellen rund um den Globus. FÃ¼r BILD analysiert Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg die Folgen des Wahlsiegs von Donald Trump: FÃ¼r Europa werde es ein grauenvolles Erwachen geben. ( Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg | Â»Ein grauenvolles Erwachen fÃ¼r Europa! BLD â Nov 9, 2016)\n\nYet the outcome of the US election sends shock waves around the globe. For BILD, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg analyzes the consequences of Donald Trump’s election victory: there will be a terrible awakening for Europe.\n\nFormer German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg is correctâthere will be a TERRIBLE AWAKENING FOR EUROPE. Europe will arise to become the Beast of Revelation!\n\nInterstingly, after the Brexit vote, KT was interviewed by the FOX network. Notice some of what he said on June 24, 2016:\n\nI don't see the necessary leadership in Europe at the moment. ...\n\nWe have to come to a new structure ... https://youtu.be/fMYFV_zwNrE\n\nOn a video published by the Octavian Report on November 15, 2017 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTL_CgBwmxo around minute 25), Herr Guttenberg stated:\n\nWe are in urgent need of reforming the European Union.\n\nAccording to Bible prophecy, as I have explained for years, the European Union will reorganize:\n\n12 \"The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast. 13 These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast. (Revelation 17:12-13)\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, we will see some non-specifically prophesied rule changes and reorganizations in Europe.Â But as Ulrike Guerot indicated, that will not be enough.\n\nIt is likely that because of economic and civil unrest crises, that emergency provisions in the EU will be modified and then evoked in the future.\n\nThe Bible shows that it will be a relative few that will take advantage of the situation to get the final King of the North to gain control as the final Beast of the sea of Revelation 13.Â Notice what Daniel 11 teaches about the King of the North:\n\n21 And in his place shall arise a vile person, to whom they will not give the honor of royalty; but he shall come in peaceably, and seize the kingdom by intrigue. 22 With the force of a flood they shall be swept away from before him and be broken, and also the prince of the covenant. 23 And after the league is made with him he shall act deceitfully, for he shall come up and become strong with a small number of people. 24 He shall enter peaceably, even into the richest places of the province; and he shall do what his fathers have not done, nor his forefathers: he shall disperse among them the plunder, spoil, and riches; and he shall devise his plans against the strongholds, but only for a time. (Daniel 11:21-24)\n\nSo, this leader will promise peace and prosperity. He will make a deal with a small amount of people to gain power (cf. Revelation 17:12-13). He will promise peace and prosperity in a time of crisis. This King is also the \"Beast\" that the ten kings give their power to in Revelation 17:12-13 (see also Must the Ten Kings of Revelation 17:12 Rule over Ten Currently Existing Nations?).\n\nCould Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg be trying to set the stage for the coming reorganization for Europe? It certainly seems possible.\n\nSome Prophecies About the Religion of the Beast Leader and King of the North\n\nNotice some of what the Bible teaches about the final King of the North:\n\n36 âThen the king shall do according to his own will: he shall exalt and magnify himself above every god, shall speak blasphemies against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the wrath has been accomplished; for what has been determined shall be done. 37 He shall regard neither the God of his fathers nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall exalt himself above them all. 38 But in their place he shall honor a god of fortresses; and a god which his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and pleasant things. 39 Thus he shall act against the strongest fortresses with a foreign god, which he shall acknowledge, and advance its glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and divide the land for gain. (Daniel 11:36-39)\n\nFrom the passages in Daniel we see that this ambitious and arrogant king is not truly devoted to any existing religion, but that he somehow promotes another.Â One way this could be done would be to come up with a new order within Catholicism (which is not that hard to do as even one of my relatives was able to do so).Â A new order allows one to have certain unique characteristics while still claiming to be part of the Roman Catholic faith.Â And in the King of the Northâs view, if he promotes an order that (at first at least) seems fairly \"Catholic,\" this ruse will work for some time.\n\nInterestingly, there is a Byzantine prophecy that the Great Monarch will amass gold:\n\nEmperor Leo the Philosopher (died 912): You will amass the gold of the nations ... And you will be the leader of the surrounding powers ... and those that are near will prostrate themselves before your feet (Tzima Otto, H.Â The Great Monarch and WWIII in Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Scriptural Prophecies. Verenika Press, Rock City (SC), 2000, pp. 76-77).\n\nBaron Guttenberg was Economics Minister and likely understands the value of gold. It will be interesting to see WHEN he makes public statements about gold, as if he is the one, it is of virtual certainty that he will do so. The accumulation of gold is consistent with Daniel 11:43. The fact that he honors some type of deity with gold suggests that he is involved with a religion that values idols/icons; as the Baron's professed faith currently does.\n\nLike the King of the North, the final Beast power (who is also the final King of the North) wants himself and his system to be worshipped:\n\n1 Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name. 2 Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority. 3 And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled and followed the beast. 4 So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, \"Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?\"\n\n5 And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months. 6 Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. 7 It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. 8 All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. (Revelation 13:1-8)\n\nSince there are both Greco-Roman Catholic (see Greco-Roman Catholic Prophecies: Do They Mirror, Highlight, or Contradict Biblical Prophecies?) and biblical prophecies (Revelation 17:1-9) that suggest that the powers of Antichrist will call themselves \"Catholic,\" it would seem that someone who was outwardly 'Catholic,' but not truly committed to that faith would be a candidate to be the \"Beast.\" Consider that Baron Guttenberg's plagerism scandal was considered to be a death blow to his career. While the 'deadly wound; in Revelation 13 seems to apply to the 'Holy Roman Empire,' the Baron's fall from politics that could revive is consistent with Revelation 13:3.\n\nIt also could be consistent with the following:\n\nOracle of Baalbek:Â And the name of this King is concealed among the nations; and his name is similar to the last day, and it is written from the 18th letter. And when he will receive his empire, his name will beÂ Anastasius, (Anastasois). (Tzima Otto, p. 64).\n\nDr. Tzima OttoÂ (interpretting the above): The Greek name Anastasios translates as the one who is connected with the Resurrection. ... I believe that we have again a prophetic mention on the Great Monarch (ibid, p. 65).\n\nNot only is a type of resurrected 'Holy Roman Empire' expected, if the Baron rises up, that will be considered as a major resurrection of his career. The 18th letter of the Greek alphabet is a sigma, and the last name before the baron title for KT is Sylvester, which begins with the English equivalent to a sigma in Greek. On the other hand, Dr. Tzima Otto wrote, based on other information in the Oracle that referred to the \"last day of the week\" and \"the Resurrection\" of Jesus (which was actually on Saturday) that somehow this person has a connection to the Sabbath, which begins with the Greek letter sigma (Tzima Otto, pp. 199-200).\n\nAs far as religion goes, notice this passage in the Book of Revelation:\n\n7 But the angel said to me, âWhy did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten hornsâ¦9 âHere is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitsâ¦16 And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot, make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh and burn her with fire. 17 For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled. 18 And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.â (Revelation 17:7,19,16-18)\n\nSince the Beast turns on the woman of Rome, this is obviously someone who is not truly dedicated to the Roman Catholic faith. (Note to Roman Catholics:Â I am NOT trying to be offensive to Greco-Roman Catholics in my analysis here.Â Most Roman Catholic scholars acknowledge that the seven hills and the âgreat cityâ spoken of in the Apocalypse is Rome.Â As I make clear in my book 2012 and the Rise of the Secret Sect, I am concerned that some who do not truly believe the original Catholic faith, including an antipope, will rise up in the end.Â And this seems to be consistent with both biblical and Roman Catholic prophecies for the end times.)\n\nHere are a few more scriptures that are associated with this Beast/King of the North:\n\n23 \"And in the latter time of their kingdom, When the transgressors have reached their fullness, A king shall arise, Having fierce features, Who understands sinister schemes. 24 His power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; He shall destroy fearfully, And shall prosper and thrive; He shall destroy the mighty, and also the holy people. 25 \"Through his cunning He shall cause deceit to prosper under his rule; And he shall exalt himself in his heart. He shall destroy many in their prosperity. He shall even rise against the Prince of princes; But he shall be broken without human means. (Daniel 8:23-25)\n\n12 \"The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast. 13 These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast. 14 These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful.\" (Revelation 17:12-14)\n\nBoth Daniel and John seem to be writing about the same leader. He is cunning. He has schemes and plans, hence will likely appear on the scene as nice and popular. Yet, this leader will at some point persecute those that are truly faithful, yet will ultimately lose.\n\nAlso, if certain Greco-Roman Catholic prophecies about the âGreat Monarchâ are correct (see also The Great Monarch: Biblical and Catholic Prophecies), this leader will change the \"Catholic\" faith and offend many of its clergy:\n\nD.A. Birch (20th century): Francis also speaks in a series of letters to Simeon de Limena, Count of Montalto in great detail of a future Great Monarch who will be a Roman Emperor. Limena was a great patron of St. Francisâ order and also a great military protector of the Churchâ¦Several potentially confusing things are now told about this future Monarch. He is described as founding a new religious order. To the reader this may sound like he also become a priest. That is not the case. What happens is that he founds a religious order, part of which contains military men who take religious vows. He will be the head of the military arm of this order. In this sense it will be like the Knights Templar of the Middle Ages.\n\nSt. Francis of Paula (15th Century)â¦âHe shall be the founder of a new religious order different from all others. (Birch, DA. Trial, Tribulation & Triumph: Before During and After Antichrist. Queenship Publishing Company, Goleta (CA), 1996, pp. 276-270)\n\nFranciscan Friar (18th century). âAll the religious orders will be suppressed, except one, the rule of which will be as rigid and severe as that of the monks of the past. During these calamities the Pope will die. As a result, the most powerful anarchy will prevail within the Church.âÂ (Dupont, Yves. Catholic Prophecy: The Coming Chastisement. TAN Books, Rockford (IL), 1973, p. 79)\n\nVen. Magdalene Porzat (19th century): An enormous bird (Great Monarch) shall awake...Behold their is confusion; confusion even in the sanctuary. (Culleton, R. Gerald. The Prophets and Our Times. Nihil Obstat: L. Arvin. Imprimatur: Philip G. Scher, Bishop of Monterey-Fresno, November 15, 1941. Reprint 1974, TAN Books, Rockford (IL), pp. 202, 205)\n\nVen. Anne de la Foi: \" There will be discord in the Church\" (Dupont, p. 114).\n\nSister Marianne Gaultier (18th century): ââ¦the Prince shall reign, whom people did not esteem before, but whom they shall then seek.Â (Dupont, p. 75).\n\nD. Birch (commenting after the above in his book), âMany of the prophecies speak of the fact that the Great King at first will not be well-liked, especially by the French clergyâ (Birch, p. 276).\n\nEven if all of the above is in total error, the biblical fact is that the future King of the North and final political leader known biblically as the Beast will not truly be a devoted Greco-Roman Catholic.Â He will likely claim that religion, change it, and ultimately his closest supporters will attempt to destroy it (Revelation 17:16-18). Some of his true colors will apparently be seen as he starts to rise up as some of the Greco-Roman Catholic clergy will not care for him at first.\n\nHere are a few facts about Karl-Theodor von und zu Guttenberg that suggest, to me at least, that he is NOT truly a devoted Roman Catholic:\n\nHe is married to a Lutheran.\n\nHis wife did not convert to Roman Catholicism prior to marriage, which is what a truly devoted Roman Catholic would have likely insisted upon.\n\nAlthough he has been married since February 2000, he only has 2 children.Â It would seem that a devoted Roman Catholic would have more children than that at this stage. (Note: While in Germany, it is not normally considered socially appropriate to have large numbers of children, if one is truly more devoted to the Roman Catholic faith than certain cultural pressures, one would likely have more children.)\n\nHe seems to be a fan of âacid-rockâ which suggests to me that he has a personally more casual view of conventional religions, like Roman Catholicism, as acid-rock seems to promote a nihilistic message.\n\nHe got caught in a plagiarism scandal that essentially cost him his doctorate and got him to resign his position as Defense Minister.\n\nHe has the right to select the priest for his parish. The most devout would seemingly leave this decision in the hands a bishop of the Catholic Church. Hence, the idea that political leaders should be involved with religion is something he was raised up believing. A leader combining church and state is prophesied in Daniel 11:37-38 and Revelation 13.\n\nIf Baron Guttenberg actually ever establishes or promotes a new \"Catholic\" religious order, this is an indication that he is very likely to be the \"Great Monarch\" of Greco-Roman Catholic prophecy (the final King of the North in biblical prophecy). If he also ends up on very good terms with Cardinal Koch (Kurt Koch Made a Cardinal: Might He Become the Antichrist?), this may also be an indicator--and could be a strong indicator.\n\nLest Roman Catholics feel that the idea of many Greco-Roman Catholics falling for an end-time ecumenical religion that calls itself \"Catholic\" is not a Roman Catholic prophetic understanding, please notice the following:\n\nSt. Gregory the Great, Pope (d. 604): In those days, near the end, hardly a Bishop, but an army of priests and two-thirds of the Christians will join the Schism (Culleton, R. Gerald. The Reign of Antichrist, Reprint TAN Books, Rockford, IL, 1974, p. 122).\n\nSaint Cyril of Jerusalem (died 386): Antichrist ... shall through his great power, deceit and malice, succeed in decoying or forcing to his worship two thirds of mankind (Connor, Edward. Prophecy for Today. Imprimatur + A.J. Willinger, Bishop of Monterey-Fresno; Reprint: Tan Books and Publishers, Rockford (IL), 1984,p. 74).\n\nSt. Francis of Assisi (d. 1226): There will be an uncanonically elected pope who will cause a great Schism, there will be divers thoughts preached which will cause many, even those in the different orders to doubt, yea even agree with the heretics, which will cause my Order to divide (Culleton, R. Gerald. The Reign of Antichrist, p. 130).\n\nBlessed Joachim (died 1202): Towards the end of the world Antichrist will overthrow the Pope and usurp his See (Connor, p. 76).\n\nAnna-Katarina Emmerick (October 1, 1820): The Church is in great danger…The Protestant doctrine and that of the schismatic Greeks are to spread everywhere. I now see that in this place (Rome) the (Catholic) Church is being so cleverly undermined, that there hardly remain a hundred or so priests who have not been deceived. They all work for the destruction, even the clergy. A great destruction is now at hand...\n\n(April 22, 1823): I saw that many pastors allowed themselves to be taken up with ideas that were dangerous to the Church. They were building a great, strange, and extravagant Church. Everyone was admitted in it in order to be united and to have equal rights: Evangelicals, Catholics, sects of every description. Such was to be the new Church (Dupont, pp. 66, 71).\n\nPriest Herman Kramer (20th century): The False Prophet...will persuade all infidels, apostates and apostate nations to worship and adore him...Antichrist \"sitteth in the temple of God\" (I Thes. II. 4)...possibly one of the churches in Jerusalem or St. Peter's in Rome...The False Prophet will proclaim the resurrection of the Roman Empire...The word \"image\" is in the singular number, indicating only one statue, which he may set up in the great church, St. Peter's (Kramer H.B.

Reprint TAN Books, Rockford (IL), p. 320-323).\n\nPriest Paul Kramer (21st century): The errors of Orthodoxy and of Protestantism will be embraced by that false church, it will be an ecumenical church because the Anti-Pope will be recognized by the world — not by the faithful, but by the world — by the secular world and the secular governments. The Anti-Pope will be recognized as the legitimate Pope of the \"church,\" and the legitimate head of the Vatican State. That \"church\" will be united with all the false religions. (Kramer P. The Imminent Chastisement for Not Fulfilling Our Lady’s Request. An edited transcript of a speech given at the Ambassadors of Jesus and Mary Seminar in Glendale, California, September 24, 2004.THE FATIMA CRUSADER Issue 80, Summer 2005, pp. 32-45 http://www.fatimacrusader.com/cr80/cr80pg32.asp viewed 4/15/08)\n\nThe reality is that both biblical and Greco-Roman Catholic prophecies warn that an ecumenical religion will sweep the world and likely be considered by most to be the \"Catholic\" faith--and that the secular leaders (like a future \"emperor\") and others will support this.\n\nHow come many Greco-Roman Catholics and others are prophesied to fall for this? The Bible suggests that part of the reason is because signs and lying wonders:\n\n9 The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, 10 and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 11 And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, 12 that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12).\n\n2...The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority. (Revelation 13:2)\n\n13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14 For they are spirits of demons, performing signs...(Revelation 16:13-14).\n\nIf the Baron is the one, Satanic demons will enter him and perform signs.\n\nAnd notice that signs and wonders are prophesied to be associated with the Great Monarch:\n\nDiscourse of a Holy Man to Emperor Manuel II Palaeologous (15th century): And the members of the clergy and the monastics as well as every social stratum of humanity, against their own will, but led by a divine sign will come to Constantinople...Then, an angel...will descend from heaven...and he will crown the Emperor of Peace. The King will be present in Constantinople (Tzima Otto, pp. 99-100).\n\nAnonymou Paraphrasis (10th century): The one true King..will hear the voice and instructions by an Angel appearing to himâ¦the name of the King is hidden [concealed] among the nationsâ¦And the particular manner of the kingâs manifestation to the public [to the world] will take place as follows: A star will appear [will become visible] for three days long and during the third hour of the night, on the eve of the feast day of the Mother of the Most High (it will become visible) in the Middle of the City. And this star is not one among the planetsâ¦And a herald speaking with a very loud voice in the course of the three days will summon and unveil the hoped for oneâ¦There will become visible in the sky a ânebulous firmament of the sunââ¦under that image will be suspended a crossâ¦And the invisible herald from Heaven with his thunderous voice will say to the people: Is this man agreeable to you?Â At that moment everybody will be taken by fear and terror...they will elevate him on a high spot and will proclaim him (their) hereditary Monarch (Tzima Otto, pp. 30,32, 50-51, 52,53).\n\nThe name hidden among the nations may represent how his name should be interpreted--in other words, with different languages/alphabets being considered.\n\nIn the above, some type of cross is shown to be a sign or wonder in the sky. And while most Greco-Roman Catholics consider that a cross would be the sign of a 'Catholic,' notice the warning from a Roman Catholic priest:\n\nPriest P. Huchedé (19th century): What this sign shall be time alone will reveal. Yet there are some {Catholic} commentators of the Holt Writ, who, according to a special revelation pretend to say that it shall be formed out of the Greek letters X and P, interlaced...which resembles the number of Christ. (Cornelius a Lapide in Epis. 2 to Thes.). No one can either buy or sell without that…(Huchedé, P. Translated by JBD. History of Antichrist. Imprimatur: Edward Charles Fabre, Bishop of Montreal. English edition 1884, Reprint 1976. TAN Books, Rockford (IL), p. 24).\n\nThe interlaced Greek letters X and P make what is called a Chi-Rho cross.\n\nA \"Brother David Lopez,\" made the following claims about a message supposedly from Mary in August 1987:\n\nBefore the great tribulation, there is going to be a sign. We will see in the sky one great red cross on a day of blue sky without clouds...This cross will be seen by everyone: Christians, pagans, atheists, etc., as well as all the prepared ones (Flynn, Ted and Maureen. The Thunder of Justice. MaxKol Communications, Inc. Sterling (VA), 1993, p.349).\n\nCrosses will be part of the identifying sign of the \"Great Monarch\" according to certain (not always accurate) private prophecies:\n\nSt. Francis de Paul (d. 1507): A new order will be founded, that of the Cruciferi, because its members will carry the cross on their banners...the power of Islam {is to be} destroyed by the Great Monarch. (Culleton, The Reign of Antichrist, p. 142).\n\nSt. Francis de Paul (1470):...From your lordship {Simeon de Limena, Count of Montalto} shall be born the great leader of the holy militia...These devout men shall wear on their breasts, and much more in their hearts, the sign of the living God, namely the cross...members of this holy order... (Culleton, The Prophets and Our Times. Nihil Obstat: L. Arvin. Imprimatur: Philip G. Scher, Bishop of Monterey-Fresno, November 15, 1941. Reprint 1974, TAN Books, Rockford (IL), p. 157-161)\n\nPriest Lavinsky (died 1708): The world will be harassed by civil wars...the Cross, to the astonishment of all, will shine in double splendor through many lands because of the great ruler (Connor, pp.36-37).\n\nAnne Catherine Emmerich (October 1820): I saw the demolishers thronging into it accompanied by the beast....The first circle was composed of youths and maidens; the second, of married persons of all classes from royalty down; the third, of religious; the fourth, of warriors, led by a rider on a white horse; and the fifth, and last was made up of citizens and peasants, many of whom were marked on the forehead with a red cross. (Emmerich AC. The Life of Lord Jesus Christ and Biblical Revelations. Schmöger edition, Vol. IV. Nihil Obstat: D. Jaegher, 14 Februari 1914. Imprimatur: A.C. De Schrevel, Brugis, 14 Februari 1914. Reprint TAN Books, Rockford (IL), 2004,)\n\nThus, it appears that the use of signs such as crosses and other wonders will apparently mislead many.\n\nGuttenberg's Ancestry Fits and Does Not Fit Certain Prophecies\n\nThe Bible suggests that a \"prince\" who will become the King of the North will be from the people of the Roman Empire (Daniel 9:26-27) as it was that empire that destroyed the city of Jerusalem and its temple/sanctuary in 70 A.D. And the Baron (and multiple millions) fit this.\n\nWe in the Continuing Church of God (like the late Herbert W. Armstrong) believe that the Assyrian peoples migrated into central Europe in ancient times (see Germany's Assyrian Roots Throughout History). Many scholars believe that the descendants of the biblical Asshur (Genesis 10:22) seem to have become Assyria (RadmacherÂ Concordance in. Nelson Study Bible, p. 11). Even the Catholic saint Jerome indicated that the descendants of the biblical Asshur ended up in Europe (Jerome. Letter CXXIII to Ageruchia, Chapter 16.Â Translated by W.H. Fremantle, G. Lewis and W.G. Martley. From Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series, Vol. 6. Edited by Philip Schaff and Henry Wace. (Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1893.) Revised and edited for New Advent by Kevin Knight. <http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001123.htm>). And the Baron's ancestry clearly includes those of Central Europe.\n\nNotice the following:\n\n3 And He will stretch out His hand against the north, Destroy Assyria, And make Nineveh a desolation, As dry as the wilderness. 14 The herds shall lie down in her midst, Every beast of the nation. Both the pelican and the bittern Shall lodge on the capitals of her pillars; Their voice shall sing in the windows; Desolation shall be at the threshold; For He will lay bare the cedar work. 15 This is the rejoicing city That dwelt securely, That said in her heart,\"I am it, and there is none besides me.\" How has she become a desolation, A place for beasts to lie down! Everyone who passes by her Shall hiss and shake his fist. (Zephaniah 2:13-15)\n\nNotice particularly that God, who will punish Assyria (as also confirmed in Isaiah 10:12) is stretching His hand against a power of the north. That this northern power is Assyria. The King of the North will rule over end-time Assyria (for more on this, please see Who is the King of the North?). The King of the North, like that of the Baron, is Assyrian.\n\nThe ancestry of the expected Great Monarch in Catholic prophecy sometimes supports the Baron, but not always. Here are two that partially seem to:\n\nBrother Louis Rocco (died 1840): A Catholic descendant of a German imperial house (Hapsburg?) will rule a united Germany with peace, prosperity and great power, for God will be with this sovereign (Great Monarch?)...A Great Monarch will arise after a period of terrible wars and persecutions in Europe. He will be a Catholic, he will not be a German (by birth?). (Culleton, The Prophets and Our Times, p. 195).\n\nAnonymou Paraphrasis (10th century): And the name of his Father is divine [or august, i.e. having an \"imperial title\"]. (Tzima Otto, p. 40)\n\nNote: the parenthetical comments with question marks were inserted in the prediction by the Catholic priest Culleton. His comments (which were written about 70 years ago) would point to someone such as the Baron, who is a descendant of the Habsburg/Hapsburg line. As far as not being German, perhaps it does not mean \"by birth,\" but perhaps could be interpreted to mean that he has a mixed heritage (as do most of the Habsburg line). Dr. Tzima Otto put the \"imperial title\" comment in her quote. And since he too was a baron, the Baron's father had what could be considered as an imperial title. The Hapsburgs, for a time, ruled over the 'Holy Roman Empire.'\n\nHere are some Catholic predictions that stress the German connection:\n\nCyril the Hermit (14th century): A German ruler will persecute priests and monks and do much harm to the Church. (Culleton, The Prophets and Our Times, p. 155)\n\nBrother Louis Rocco (19th century): A Catholic descendant of a German imperial house will rule a united Germany with peace, prosperity and great power, for God will be with this sovereign (the Great Monarch?) ... A Great Monarch will arise after a period of terrible wars and persecutions in Europe. He will be a Catholic; he will not be a German (Culleton, The Prophets and Our Times, p. 195).\n\nFather Laurence Ricci, S.J. (died 1775): \"After the rule of Napoleon a time will come when the people will become poor and the world will be punished in three ways: wars, famines, and pestilences. At a time when the whole world seems doomed ... a valiant duke will arise from the ancient German house which was humiliated by the French monarch ... (Connor p.37)\n\nOne suggests that he is a descendant of a German house, but perhaps that he is not completely German. Two of the above suggest a German leader who will change the Catholic faith. One considers this to be a bad thing, while the other seems to consider this to be a good thing. It probably should be noted that according to Jesus, along with religious deception, \"wars, famines, and pestilences\" are part of the \"beginning of sorrows\" (Matthew 24:7-8) that occurs just prior persecutions (Matthew 24:9-10) as well as the Great Tribulation (Matthew 24:21).\n\nHere are some Catholic predictions that stress French connections:\n\nAbbot Joachim (died 1202): At that time a handsome monarch, a scion of King Pepin, will come as a pilgrim to witness the splendor of this glorious pontiff, whose name shall begin with R (Culleton, The Prophets and Our Times, pp. 147-148).\n\nSt. Caesar of Arles (died 543) ...there will be a great Pope...This Pope shall have with him, the Great Monarch, a most virtuous man, who shall be a scion of the holy race of French kings...(Culleton, The Prophets and Our Times, p. 126).\n\nSt. CÃ¦sarius (died 543): This prince shall extend his dominion over the entire universe. Dominabitur per universum orbem. At the same time there will be a great Pope, who will be most eminent in sanctity and most perfect in every quality. Per voluntatem Dei assumetur unus Papa, vir sanctissimus, et in omni perfectione perfectus. This Pope shall have with him the great monarch, a most virtuous man, who shall be a scion of the holy race of the French kings. Habebit suum virum sanctissimum qui erit de reliquis sanctissimi Francorum sanguinis Regum. This great monarch will assist the Pope in the reformation of the whole Earth. (Rossi, p. 101)\n\nBl. Rabanus Maurus (died 856): Our principal doctors agree in announcing to us, that towards the end of time one of the descendants of France shall reign over all the Roman Empire; that he shall be the greatest of the Empire; and that he shall be the greatest of the French monarch, and the last of his race. After happily governed his kingdom, he will go to Jerusalem, and depose on Mount of Olives his sceptre and crown. This shall be the end and conclusion of the Roman and Christian Empire (Culleton, The Prophets and Our Times, p. 136).\n\nAystinger the German (12th century?): The shall arise in the last times a Prince sprung from Emperor Charles who shall recover the land of promise and reform the Church. He shall be Emperor of Europe. (Connor, p. 31)\n\nSt. Remigius (5th Century): Take notice that the Kingdom of France is predestined by God for the defense of the Roman church which is the only true Church of Christ. This kingdom shall someday be great among the kingdoms of the earth, and shall embrace all the limits of the Roman Empire, and shall submit all other kingdoms to its own scepter (Birch, p. 246).\n\nJosefa von Bourg (d. 1807): God will choose a descendant of Constantine, Pepin, and St. Louis, who has been tried by a long period of exile to rule over Europe. He will have the sign of the cross on his breast...Under him the Catholic religion will spread as never before (Culleton, The Prophets and Our Times, pp. 181-182; Connor, p.37).\n\nBlessed Johannes Amadeus de Sylva (15th century): Germany and Spain will unite under a great prince...until all countries unite under the Great Ruler (Dupont, p. 74).\n\nNote: Although not commonly used in modern English, \"scion\" means \"descendant.\" It has been claimed that the Habsburg line descended from Charlemagne, and King Pepin was the father of Charlemagne. Many of the prophecies suggest that the Great Monarch is French in some manner (see also The Great Monarch: Biblical and Catholic Prophecies). But the Baron, while partially of Frankish descent, is considered to be German--so he fits or does not fit depending upon how many of the prophecies are analyzed.\n\nThe Bible itself warns that a \"prince\" (Daniel 9:26-27) will become the \"King of the North\" (Daniel 11:31-40).\n\nAnd perhaps, he will only remain a prince. While Herr Guttenberg is not ruling over Europe at this time, he is influential there and seems to be taking steps related to European politics. He may well rise much further in time, with just a small number of supporters intially (cf. Daniel 11:23).\n\nIn early 2010, I wrote:\n\nAs far as being exiled goes, the Baron is not always popular, and he may become unpopular for a time.\n\nThat happened.\n\nIn 2011, he actually resigned as Defense Minister because of a plagiarism issue (http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704506004576173970765020528.html). He and his family then moved to the USA, so a sense he was exiled. Therefore, the fact that he left Europe for a while (he and his family returned and re-established a residence in Germany in 2019, after nearly 8 years of 'exile': https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/hamburg/article200619444/Leute-KT-zu-Guttenberg-begeisterte-mit-Vortrag.html) is of interest.\n\nAnd while I believe that I am the first person in the world to ever write that Baron Guttenberg may end up in exile (before he exiled himself), after I wrote that the German press starting saying that he was in exile during his USA residence:\n\nNun, nach der PlagiatsaffÃ¤re um seine Dissertation und seinen Gang ins amerikanische Exil, setzt sich das RÃ¤tselraten fort. Er meldet sich aus Ãbersee zurÃ¼ck, deutet ein Comeback an...\n\n(TV-Kolumne: âMaybrit Illnerâ: Das Guttenberg-RÃ¤tsel - weiter lesen auf FOCUS Online: http://www.focus.de/kultur/kino_tv/focus-fernsehclub/tv-kolumne-maybrit-illner-das-guttenberg-raetsel_aid_687881.html)\n\nNow, after the plagiarism scandal surrounding his dissertation and his walk into exile in America, continues the guesswork. He is back from overseas, hints at a comeback...\n\n(TV-Kolumne: âMaybrit Illnerâ: Das Guttenberg-RÃ¤tsel - weiter lesen auf FOCUS Online: http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c Machine-translatexiled into English by Google, 12/02/11)\n\nEven Herr Guttenberg referred to his time in the USA as exile in December 2015 (Guttenberg KT. Wish List or Reality? Digital Trends in 2016 | Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg | hub conference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgdZUA96UBU. Posted December 11, 2015).\n\nConsider that even the problems Karl zu Guttenberg had seem consistent with Daniel 11:21. Here are three translations of that:\n\n21 And there shall stand up in his place one despised, and the kingly honour shall not be given him: and he shall come privately, and shall obtain the kingdom by fraud. (Daniel 11:21, Douay-Rheims)\n\nï»¿ï»¿21 \"'His place will be taken by a reject, a man spurned and passed over for advancement. He'll surprise everyone, seemingly coming out of nowhere, and will seize the kingdom. (Daniel 11:21 from THE MESSAGE: The Bible in Contemporary Language Â© 2002 by Eugene H. Peterson. All rights reserved.)\n\n21 And in his place shall stand up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the kingdom: but he shall come in time of security, and shall obtain the kingdom by flatteries. (Daniel 11:21, ASV)\n\n21 The successor of this king of the north will be a worthless nobody ... (Daniel 11:21a, CEV)\n\nInterestingly, the Baron was considered to have had a major chance to become Chancellor of Germany before the plagiarism scandal. In a sense, he was \"a man spurned and passed over for advancement\" as THE MESSAGE version of Daniel 11:21 indicates.\n\nNotice also the following prophecy of the Great Monarch:\n\nAnonymou Paraphrasis (10th century): Men thought of him that he is a nobody and useful for nothing. (Tzima Otto, p. 32)\n\nNotice that the above rendering as well as the CEV for Daniel 11:21 refer to this leader as a useless \"nobody.\"\n\nMany wrote Baron Guttenberg off.\n\nAlso interestingly, even though many have rejected, ridiculed, and despised him for plagiarism, after the Baron resigned, some (and this was alluded to earlier) have suggested that he should rise up again as Germany needs him:\n\n\"I hope that we keep him as a politician and see his return as soon as possible,\" Hans-Peter Uhl, the domestic affairs spokesperson of the conservative Union bloc in parliament, said in the Wednesday edition of the daily Mitteldeutsche Zeitung...\n\nPeter Altmaier, parliamentary chief of the Union bloc, also said he can imagine Guttenberg returning to politics in the foreseeable future.\n\nAccording to political scientist Gerd Langguth from the University of Bonn, Guttenberg will not likely stay out of the public eye for long. He told the Wednesday edition of the ThÃ¼ringer Allgemeine newspaper that he sees a comeback in about three years...Langguth said Guttenberg's \"honorable statements\" on Tuesday had made such a return feasible. (Talk begins about a Guttenberg comeback. The Local, 3 March 2011. http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20110302-33437.html)\n\nKarl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, Germany's Defense Minister, resigned Tuesday amid pressures related to plagiarism in his doctoral dissertation. Apparently, more than 20% of his dissertation was copied without attribution. Mr. zu Guttenberg was one politician whom many Germans still trusted. The scandal has changed that view for many.\n\nMr. zu Guttenberg is considered by many as \"Germany's most promising politician.\" Although Chancellor Merkel tried to protect him, his action of essentially \"lying\" in an academic setting is forcing people to question his integrity in other areas and responsibilities. Thousands of graduate students across Germany also wrote an open letter to Mrs. Merkel calling for zu Guttenberg to step down.\n\nAn article describing the scandal ended with the observation: \"As for Mr. zu Guttenberg himself, it would be unwise to write him off. By stepping down now, he hopes to preserve much of the goodwill he has accumulated over the past few years. His resignation may be a prelude to resurrection rather than the end of a brilliant career\" (The Economist, March 1, 2011).\n\nEven though plagiarism appears to be a \"minor\" sin in relation to other horrendous abuses by public officials, it breaks the 8th and 9th commandments and results in consequences. Mr. zu Guttenberg may reemerge in politics in the future (and this bears watching), yet his actions and their ramifications reinforce the biblical principle, \"be sure your sin will find you out\" (Numbers 32:23). (TW News & Prophecy, LCG, March 4, 2011).\n\nCould Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg make a comeback? Perhaps if he does a stint in the European Parliament first, as some suggest. It is unlikely, however, that he could ever be chancellorâGermans do not take lightly to academic fraud. Guttenberg is still popular, however. There is a Facebook fan page entitled \"Against Going After Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg\" which boasts more than 400,000 fans. (Alles (not) in Ordnung Weekly Standard, Washington DC - April 4, 2011 http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/alles-not-ordnung_556221.html)\n\nAccording to a latest poll by German public television ARD, some 72 percent of respondents thought Guttenberg should make a comeback in the future. http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-03/03/c_13758223.htm\n\nWhether his political career can rebound from the plagiarism scandal remains debatable. The embarrassing affair has destroyed his credibility, but some German political experts argue that after time spent in the political wilderness as penance, Mr Guttenberg could try and revive his political career, and certainly age is on his side. May 9, 2011. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8503065/Karl-Theodor-zu-Guttenberg-A-profile.html\n\nLet me add here that since Herr Guttenberg's plagiarism scandal, several other German political leaders have been found to have some plagiarism issues associated with their own doctoral studies (German Plagiarism and Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg). Thus, if this matter is seen as relatively common, this may well help people to overlook it.\n\nOrthodox prophecy indicates that the Great Monarch will re-enter the political realm:\n\nAnonymou Paraphrasis (10th century): And the (Guardian Angel will say to him further: come forth from your hiding place, do not hide yourself any longer, many are looking for you [or, are searching for you, are demanding to see you, asking for you]; everybody will exit and only you, alone, will enter. (Tzima Otto, p. 31)\n\nSince writing back in March 2011 that Karl Guttenberg may re-emerge in the political arena, it has begun to happen. The EU announced:\n\nDigital Agenda: Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg invited by Kroes to promote internet freedom globally\n\nBrussels, 12 December 2011 â European Commission Vice-President Neelie Kroes has invited Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, a former Federal Minister of Defence, and of Economics and Technology, in Germany, to advise on how to provide ongoing support to Internet users, bloggers and cyber-activists living under authoritarian regimes. This appointment forms a key element of a new \"No Disconnect Strategy\" to uphold the EU's commitment to ensure human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected both online and off-line, and that internet and other information and communication technology (ICT) can remain a driver of political freedom, democratic development and economic growth...\n\nThe \"No Disconnect strategy\" will assist people in four ways:\n\nDeveloping and providing technological tools to enhance privacy and security of people living in non-democratic regimes when using ICT.\n\nEducating and raising awareness of activists about the opportunities and risks of ICT. In particular assisting activists to make best use of tools such as social networks and blogs while raising awareness of surveillance risks when communicating via ICT.\n\nGathering high quality intelligence about what is happening \"on the ground\" in order to monitor the level of surveillance and censorship at a given time, in a given place.\n\nCooperation. Developing a practical way to ensure that all stakeholders can share information on their activity and promote multilateral action and building cross-regional cooperation to protect human rights. Â http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/1525&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en\n\nSo, he has, and apparently will develop more, expertise in computers and surveillance. The Baron's appointment should sound out potential alarms to all who understand Bible prophecy, as the final Beast power will develop frightening economic control (cf. Revelation 13:15-18), probably using 21st century technology. Yet, instead, the Baron is being ridiculed for this appointment as well as his plagiarism scandal (e.g. Ridicule for Guttenbergâs new EU internet role The Local - Dec 13, 2011. http://www.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20111213-39475.html). Another concern about the internet appointment is that Daniel 8:23, while consistent with one knowing aspects of Catholic private prophecy, suggests that the final King of the North leader will \"understand hidden things\" (Youngs Literal Translation)--such as perhaps, internet secrets. The Baron's position related to the internet, directly or indirectly, may help him fulfill Daniel 8:23 if he is the final King of the North.\n\nHis statements at the Hub Conference in December 2015 indicate that he is interested in more than 'protect human rights,' but to increase the government's ability to control information in the internet.\n\nNotice more reports about and from the Baron:\n\nâBaron Cut-and-Pasteâ may return to politics\n\nDec 30, 2011\n\nBavariaâs state premier Horst Seehofer said on Friday he would do his best to bring disgraced former Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg back into German politics in 2012.\n\nA new book, âVorerst Gescheitertâ (Failed at First), is Guttenbergâs attempt to repair his tattered reputation and set the stage for a comeback. Structured as an interview with Giovanni di Lorenzo, editor-in-chief of Die Zeit newspaperâ¦\n\nWhy did he want the doctorate â in addition to his aristocratic title of Freiherr (similar to Baron) and his political laurels? In a country where customers are asked to list their academic titles on applications for retail loyalty cards, a Ph.D. is the ultimate accessory to a political career.\n\nGuttenberg says âthe biggest mistake of his lifeâ was refusing to acknowledge that he didnât have time to do a good job on the thesis â a mistake he blames on âarrogance combined with a fair amount of vanity.â As a result of being overstretched, his approach became âchaotic,â he saysâ¦\n\nGuttenberg, says his âstrength is returningâ for the next chapter in his life.\n\nHe sees a âpolitical leadership crisisâ in Germany. Though he wonât be pinned down on timing, Guttenberg says he expects to return and re-enter German politics in some form.Â (Hickley C. Plagiarist Baron Seeks Political Comeback With Lame Excuses.Â December 15, 2011. Â http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-15/plagiarist-baron-seeks-political-comeback-with-lame-excuses.html)\n\nSo, vanity was the apparent reason for the Ph.D. and taking short-cuts to get it was the result of vanity and arrogance (cf. Daniel 11:36-37) according to Karl zu Guttenberg himself. And he wishes to rise up again (Daniel 11:21-22). These seem to be traits of the final King of the North.\n\nAlso notice:\n\nGuttenberg says he's ready for comeback\n\nDisgraced former Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg is taking his first steps towards a political come-back, less than a year after his plagiarised doctorate forced him to resign...support within the party for Guttenbergâs return was growing, and that Christian MeiÃner, a CSU official in Guttenbergâs home district, had asked him to attend a meeting within the next four to five weeks.\n\nGuttenberg texted back that he would attend, the magazine said. (Guttenberg says he's ready for comeback The Local.de, âJanuary 8, 2012â. http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20120108-39985.html)\n\nIn September 2011, Baron Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg said he would leave Germany for the U.S. His decision stemmed from a plagiarism scandal that resulted in his resignation as German Defense Minister, and the stripping of his doctorate by his alma mater. His plan was to spend two years in the U.S. on a type of âsabbatical,â in order to ârethink his political careerâ (Der Spiegel, September 6, 2011). Now fast-forward just four monthsâ¦ Herr Guttenberg appeared on the scene in Germany two weeks ago related to a technology project. This weekâs headlines ran, âDisgraced former Defence Minister Karl-T heodor"
