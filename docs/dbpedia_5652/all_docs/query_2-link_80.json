Like early day Caldwell, it is straightforward, inelegant, and a little rough around the edges. My intent is to quickly throw some things together that I think Caldwell folks might find interesting and maybe even a little entertaining. I may be publicly bearing too much of my uncultured nature, but I will state here and now that I detest formality.\n\nI prefer a lowbrow style of writing. I believe that if you have something to say, you can waste a lot of time fretting over how to say it with absolute exactitude - that is, to please literary stuffed shirts that are more interested in the precision of its punctuation, grammar, and so forth, than the content of the message. (Sincerest apologies to my close friend, Troy Boucher, Professor of English at Southwestern College; no stuffed shirt by any means—just a good old boy.) I like to express what’s on my mind without worrying about similes, gerunds, and infinitives -it’s much less time consuming and therefore, more efficient.\n\n♦ ♦ ♦\n\nAs a young boy, after finishing every Saturday’s mandatory chores for my mother, the first order of business was to hook up with my friends and scout around familiar haunts in search of discarded pop bottles. If we could find seven pop bottles each, we could redeem the two-cent deposit for each bottle and arrive at the magic number: fourteen cents - just what it took to see the cowboy picture show at the Ritz Theatre. If we were lucky enough to pick up an extra five bottles, that was good for a ten-cent box of popcorn for us to share.\n\nThen, for the next forty-five minutes to an hour, I was transformed into another time and another place, cheering the good guys as they invariably brought the bad guys to justice. I was captivated by that time and place.\n\nv\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nHow I wished I could live in a world where all that stuff happened; where there were cowboys and Indians, and bad guys and guns and horses and all the other trappings and paraphernalia of that rip-roaring era.\n\nLittle did I know then, or for many years after, that there had probably been more of that Old West shoot-em-up stuff right here in the area of my hometown than just about anywhere else.\n\nThen in 1980, I just happened to see an advertisement in the Wichita Eagle stating that someone had written a book about some old Caldwell “sheriff” of the “cowboy days” and he would be giving a talk and a book signing at the Methodist Church in Caldwell (or, perhaps the High School auditorium). I attended the presentation, bought the book, Henry Brown: Outlaw Marshal, and met the author, Bill O’Neal. It was an enlightening and\n\ntransforming day - that book opened my eyes and I have been hooked on Caldwell’s history ever since.\n\nOver the ensuing years, I have discovered my hometown’s true stature in the ranks of the cowtowns.\n\nIt seems to be in my nature for my interest to gravitate more to the rip-roaring, shoot-em-up side of Caldwell’s history than its (uninspiring) economic development.\n\nAnd, I revel in it!\n\nJust for the fun of it, I decided to list all of the things that I could think of that are representative of the classic old cowboy days. Here is what I could think of offhand:\n\nboardwalks and hitching posts; saloons and dance hall girls; gambling halls and spittoons; bartenders and whiskey; brothels and prostitutes; boots and bandannas; saddles and spurs; Stetsons and saddlebags; chaps and lariats; covered wagons and stagecoaches; buckboards and buggies; buffalo, deer, and antelope; card-sharks and cut-throats; cattle rustlers, cattle drives, cattle trails and cattle trains; cattlemen, cowboys, cowpunchers, and cowpokes; campfires and bedrolls, lynch mobs and nooses; dug-outs, soddys, and\n\nVI\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nendless open prairie; cavalry soldiers and cattle barons; bullwhackers and bullwhips; gamblers, gunfighters, and gunsmoke; horse thieves, bank robbers and bank robberies; house burnings and iron-bar jail cells; The Frontier, ” knifings and lynchings; chuck-wagons and dutch ovens; lawmen, posses, and renegade Indians; horseshoes and wagon wheels; gunfights, prairie dogs and prairie fires; round ups and branding irons; longhorn steers and river crossings; oxen and mules; buffalo wallows, cactus and quicksand; barbed wire and tumbleweeds; deputy US marshals and shyster bankers; sheriffs and two-gun town marshals; six-guns and Winchesters; sod-busters and ranchers, storms and stampedes; coyotes, wildcats, wolves, and rattlesnakes; steam locomotives and wooden water towers.\n\nCaldwell had them all!\n\nCaldwell was the quintessential cowtown. No town experienced more cowboys coming and going than did Caldwell. It had a longer cowtown period, (and longer tenure as a railhead: 1880 - 1885) than other more famous cowtowns. (I say “more famous” grudgingly.) Literally a “Child of the Chisholm Trail,” it is the only cowtown whose origin and existence was fostered exclusively by and for the Chisholm Trail.\n\nCaldwell was a violent cowtown. In his book, Border Queen Caldwell, my good friend, the prolific old west nonfiction writer (and Honorary Citizen of Caldwell), Bill O’Neal, frankly tells it like it was:\n\nIndeed, there was enough sustained frontier violence in Caldwell to rank it alongside bullet-riddled Dodge City or Abilene or any other Kansas cattle town, as well as with Tombstone in the early 1880s, Lincoln in the late 1870s, Tascosa during the 1880s, or El Paso during the 1890s.\n\nAlmost from its start, violence visited the growing settlement. Only three months after the opening of Stone’s store, Caldwell’s first business establishment, settlers were raided by Indians on Bluff Creek just south of town and within one year’s time, Caldwell had racked up its first four\n\nVII\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nmurders, had hosted two lynchings, and witnessed its first classic gunfight: two cowboys shot it out and killed each other.\n\nSucceeding murders along the border have followed each other so rapidly since then, that many of them have never been chronicled. Years ago, when there was no law, the murderer did not consider it necessary to flee, but simply kept a sharp outlook for the “avenger of blood.” Of late years, however, there has been some effort made to enforce the laws, and these desperadoes have been more wary in their lawlessness. Yet the immediate cause of their depredations has never been removed. The large majority of brawls that have terminated in murder, began in dance and bawdyhouses. In every instance the murderer’s brain has been fired by strong drink very frequently sold in violation of law.\n\n(Sumner County Press, December 22, 1881)\n\nIt is my hope that this book will provoke interest and inspire the reader to learn more about Caldwell’s extraordinary history. The last several pages of this book include a bibliography that lists a number of books relating Caldwell history. Highly recommended are: Border Queen Caldwell, by Bill O’Neal; Caldwell: Kansas Border Cowtown by Tom Coke; and the 1984 edition of Midnight and Noonday by George Freeman with copious notes by Prof. Richard Lane.\n\nRod Cook January, 2012\n\nVIII\n\nBefore\n\n1825\n\nJun 2\n\n1828\n\nMay 6\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nTimeline: early Caldwell\n\n♦\n\nA Brief Chronology of Significant Events\n\n♦\n\n(And Some not So Significant)\n\n1825\n\nFuture sites of Caldwell, Sumner County and South-Central Kansas are enclosed in a vast four-state area claimed by the Osage Nation as their ancestral domain.\n\nBy the Treaty of 1825, the Osage are forced to abandon most of their ancestral lands and are confined to a small reservation; the southern boundary of which lay on an east-west line collinear with the future Avenue E in north Caldwell. Their new home is known as the Osage Diminished Reservation.\n\nBy a treaty of 1828, the Cherokee Nation is forced to move from their ancestral lands east of the Mississippi River, to the west over the “Trail of Tears” to a new reservation established in the north-east corner of oklahoma Territory. in order to honor the Cherokees’ desire for free access to their western hunting grounds, the treaty specifies that:\n\n. . . the United States further\n\nguaranty to the Cherokee nation a perpetual outlet west, and a free and\n\n1\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nunmolested use of all the county . . . as far west as the sovereignty of the United States and their right of soil extend.\n\nThis area is known as The Cherokee Outlet. It is sixty miles wide north to south by about 225 miles long east to west (lying between the 96th and 100th meridians) and contains about 9,000,000 acres. Its northern boundary is designated to be collinear with the Southern Boundary of the Osage Diminished Reservation running through the future city of Caldwell.\n\n1852\n\nWilliam Sherod Robinson, later to be known as Ben Wheeler, an infamous Caldwell assistant marshal, is born near Holly Springs, Marshal County, Mississippi.\n\n1854\n\nCongress enacts the Kansas Nebraska Act establishing Kansas Territory with its southern border designated to be the 37th parallel. But Congress had previously designated the Southern Boundary of the Osage Diminished Reservation (lying 2.46 miles above the 37th Parallel) to be the northern boundary of the Cherokee Outlet. Therefore, the area within the overlapping 2.46 mile strip of land lying between the two boundaries is unknowingly assigned as part of both the Kansas Territory and of the Cherokee Nation. This disputed strip of land, measuring about 276 miles east to west, is thereafter claimed by both Kansas Territory and by the\n\n2\n\nTimeline: early Caldwell\n\n1857\n\nFall 1857\n\n1859\n\nNov 23\n\n1860\n\nApr 3\n\nApr 14\n\nCherokee Nation and is known as the Cherokee Strip.\n\n(NOTE: the Northern Boundary of the\n\nCherokee Outlet; the Southern Boundary of the Osage Diminished Reservation, and Avenue E in north Caldwell are collinear. The upper boundary of the diminished reservation lay about three miles south of the northern boundary of Sumner County. Therefore, essentially all of Sumner County north of Caldwell’s Avenue E was, in the early days, a part of the Osage Diminished Reservation. All of Sumner County south of Avenue E was originally a part of the Cherokee Outlet; then, after 1854, it became a part of the Cherokee Strip.)\n\nFuture Caldwell Marshal Henry Newton Brown is born in Cold Springs Township, Missouri.\n\nBilly the Kid is believed to have been born in New York City.\n\nFirst Pony Express rider departs from St. Joseph, Missouri enroute to Sacramento, California.

R. Mead sets up to head southwest with a wagon load of Indian trade goods. That initial segment starts in Wichita at the confluence of the Little and Big Arkansas Rivers and ends at Chisholm's trading post, southwest of present day Oklahoma City.\n\nThe Confederacy surrenders - Civil War Ends.\n\nThe Cherokees cede the Cherokee Strip to the State of Kansas. (Until this time, the Southern Boundary of the Osage Diminished Reservation running through Caldwell was considered to be the southern Kansas State Line) The 37 th Parallel now (1866) becomes officially recognized as the southern Kansas State Line (which, in turn, becomes the northern boundary of the Cherokee Outlet.)\n\n4\n\nTimeline: early Caldwell\n\n1867\n\n1868\n\nFall\n\n1869\n\nEarly 1869\n\nSpring\n\n1869\n\n1869\n\nJoseph McCoy purchases 250 acres and builds a hotel at Abilene, Kansas.

He then begins an advertising campaign to attract Texas cattlemen to herd their cattle over the trail that Jesse Chisholm had established to his railhead at Abilene.

Present Hennessey, Oklahoma is named in his honor. (A notorious character, Billy Brooks, previously a Southwestern Stage coach diver and ex-marshal of Newton and of Dodge City, helped bury two men that were killed with Hennessey in the attack.)\n\nSumner County experiences an Indian scare. The Hennessey attack was very likely a result of this uprising. One of the factors causing the uprising was thefts by several of the Southwestern rustlers that had also been rustling Indian ponies in the Outlet.\n\nAfter an arduous ten-day pursuit with a handpicked posse, Sumner County Sheriff Davis arrests the Southwestern horse-thief gang in and around Caldwell, among them:\n\n• A.C. McLean, owner of the First/Last\n\nChance Saloon.\n\n• L.B. Hasbrouck, a young attorney -\n\nCaldwell’s first.\n\n• Jud Calkins, livery stable operator.\n\n• Billy Brooks, previously a Southwestern Stage coach diver and ex-marshal of Newton and of Dodge City where he reportedly killed 15 men.

After a half hour lull, the battle flares up again for about 45 minutes. During the second skirmish, Meagher is shot and killed, legend says, by Talbot.

A joint committee, consisting of three members of the Senate and five members of the House, was appointed January 24, to investigate charges of bribery and corruption connected with the Senatorial elections of 1867 and 1871.\n\nThe committee reported unanimously, February 26, that from the testimony taken it found that at the Senatorial election of 1867 a large sum of money was used and attempted to be used in bribing and in attempting to bribe and influence the members of the Legislature to secure the election of S. C. Pomeroy, E. G. Ross and Thomas Carney.\n\nFor full report and testimony, see Report of House Committee, House Journal 1876, pp. 957 to 971 inclusive; also Report of Joint Committee, Senate Journal 1872, pp. 561 to 569. The report gives many specifications of the paying out of large sums of money; to whom, and by who paid, and alludes to the fact that the most important witnesses (giving their names) had failed to appear before the committee when summoned, or were “fugitives who has sought refuge beyond the limits of the State.” The impression left on the public mind by the report was that money had been used in a shameless and corrupt manner to influence the elections. On May 11, the United States Senate took cognizance of the case by adopting the following:\n\nResolved, That the Committee on Privileges and Elections be authorized to investigate the election of Senator S. C. Pomeroy, by the Legislature of Kansas, in\n\n49\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\n1867, and the election of Senator Alexander Caldwell in 1871; that the committee have power to send for persons and papers; that the Chairman or acting Chairman of said committee or any sub-committee thereof have power to administer oaths; and that the Committee be authorized to sit in Washington or elsewhere, during the session of Congress and in vacation.\n\n50\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nBORDER QUEEN VIOLENCE\n\nViolence festered in Caldwell - and emanated from Caldwell.

At that time, Caldwell was the archetypal cowtown. Rough and crusty, it existed for cattle and cowboys. It was the cowboy’s reward at the end of a painfully long, hard trail. For them, it was the time and place to celebrate and Caldwell had ample establishments that catered to celebrations.\n\nAlbert A. Richards, in his article History of Sumner County in the Edwards Historical Atlas of Sumner County relates:\n\nCaldwell was located on the old Chisholm Trail and has been during all its history a “Cattle town.” Consequently, it has always had in and about it a class of people who have caused many scenes of disorder and bloodshed, which, if they were chargeable to the county, would not give it a good name by any means. From its location, it has always been a favorite resort of the cow boy and the desperado when off duty and in its earlier days was a decidedly fast and dangerous locality.\n\nThe cowboys, together with a contingent of resident hell-raisers, kept the lawmen busy throughout that era. These wild, often violent times ended in the last days of 1885. The town was settling down. The cattle trade was starting to slack off and the city was trying to curtail gambling, close the saloons, and become more temperate. January of 1885 saw the last of the professional gamblers and prostitution was eradicated by that year’s end.\n\nThe records for the period from September 6, 1879 through May 16, 1887, originally consisted of 5 docket books approximately twelve by sixteen by three inches thick. Regrettably, the second book of the series was seriously water damaged and was not available when the books were transcribed on to microfilm. That book included the action packed period of February 11, 1881 through April 1, 1882. I researched the original books at the Caldwell City Building and the microfilm at the library.\n\n65\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nCaldwell was just starting to achieve legitimacy at the beginning of this rough period and was incorporated as a third-class city in July of 1879. The next month, James D. Kelly was elected Police Judge. George Flatt was appointed Caldwell’s first marshal a short time later, and on September 6, the name of offender J. H. Wendells was recorded as Flatt’s first arrest on page one in Judge Kelly’s brand new docket book. His offense was “speeding” his horse and he was fined three dollars. Later that fall, the city’s first calaboose was built.\n\nThe pages were numbered 1 through 450 and each case was entered on a successive page. Confusingly, the cases were not entered in chronological order. That is, the date the case was entered into the book was most likely not the date of the offense. For example, a case dated July 28 on page 51 might be followed on page 52 by a case dated July 2. Apparently, selected trusted offenders were allowed the convenience of postponing their appearance before the Judge until such time as they had accumulated the necessary funds to pay the fine and costs. They were therefore granted the courtesy of avoiding jail time. Another reason for the mixed dates is that the arresting marshal many times collected the fine and costs himself and turned them in to the Judge at a latter date. Such was the case of the last two arrests made by Marshal Henry Brown. He made the arrests but was killed before he had a chance to turn in the money.\n\nExcept for a short illness when James M. Thomas filled in, Kelly was Police Judge until early April 1883. Thomas Hart Benton “Bent” Ross then held the position until Kelly assumed it again in January of 1885.\n\nThe docket records were not well kept. Often, the name of the person bringing the complaint or the name of the arresting officer was omitted. Likewise, many times the offense itself was omitted as well as many dates. The judges seemed inept much, if not most of the time. Many times, even the names of the defendants were omitted. Judge Kelly entered his own name as the complainant many times.\n\n66\n\nCALDWELL POLICE DOCKETS: 1879-1885\n\nSometimes “handles” were entered in lieu of the offender’s correct name. Texas Dan Jack, Dutchy, Jersey Finest, Mr. Love, Soda Pop Jack, Mexico, High Ball Joe, Dutch Fred, Red Shirt, High Ball Fred, Link, Slim Jim, Keno, Cousin Carey and Little Johnnie were some of the names entered as defendants. Sometimes the Judge, not knowing the offender’s name, simply did the best he could: One Shorty, Negro Cole, “John Mack whose true name is unknown”, Stranger, One Taylor, Colored Sergeant, Innkeep, and many times of course, “Name Unknown.”\n\nThe normal routine was to hold the violator in jail until the fine and costs were paid. The Judge wrote “committed to city prison until fine and costs are paid” or words to that effect on most pages. But in most cases, it was impossible to ascertain whether or not the offender was actually incarcerated. This is illustrated in the following true example where Cash Hollister was arrested by George Flatt. On the 22nd day of November 1879, (the month was omitted in the record) Judge Kelly Wrote:\n\nPlead guilty to assaulting one Frank Hunt was fined One dollar and cost and stand committed until fine and cost is paid. Received One dollar on the above suit\n\nIn the above example as in most cases, the date of payment of the fine and costs is not recorded, leaving it uncertain as to whether the offender was incarcerated or not. To add to the confusion, occasionally the disposition would be shown as “sent to prison”. At times that meant that the person was sent to Wellington but most of the time it meant the Caldwell jail. Jailed prisoners were allowed to work off their fines maintaining city streets and other odd jobs around the town site.\n\nThe judges’ handwriting is extremely difficult and often impossible to read. Some of the pages were simply unintelligible masses of scribbling. At times I had the impression that the Judge must have been fairly outraged with the case at hand. Judge Kelly spelled poker polka and monte monta. His H’s and N’s were indistinguishable. Often he spelled a person’s name two different ways on the\n\n67\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nsame page. Judge Kelly possessed a beautifully flowing hand that he rarely used. Instead, his horrific handwriting rendered many pages to be of utterly zero value to the researcher.\n\nThe books leave much to be desired as precise records. The missing second book of the series removes over a year of the most tumultuous history from the overall picture. But, while the records do not represent a truly reliable source of information, they do produce a good general impression of some of the more colorful activities of the era.\n\nMany of the offenses were mundane - as normal as we would expect for a cowtown - drunk and disorderly, disturbing the peace, petty theft, etc. Some of them were very funny, some were violent, and some were just curiously interesting.\n\nFollowing is a cross section of offenses:\n\n“horse upon the sidewalk.” “did carry a knife.” “did make a great noise upon the streets.” “Did carry and draw a revolver upon Joseph Spiken.”\n\nFrank Pratt “did ride his horse upon the sidewalk. Prisoner was committed to the new city prison but escaped through the bars.”\n\nPeter Egan was “drunk and disorderly” - “The marshal finding out that the defendant has no money and that it would be an expense on the city for his board he turned the prisoner loose.”\n\nThomas J. Ingrham was arrested by James Johnson for “Carrying a revolver and threatening to use it on James Johnson.” Ingrham actually snapped it three times in Johnson’s face. Lucky for Johnson, it misfired all three times. Perhaps the charge should have been attempted murder. “did threaten to shoot J. J. Snow.” “Confined for\n\n68\n\nCALDWELL POLICE DOCKETS: 1879-1885\n\nswearing in the court.” “did draw a knife.”\n\n“Ride horse on sidewalk.” “Obscene and scandalous language.” One Shorty “Made threats with a razor.” Joe Weideman, “did resist arrest.” “received stolen property.” “Indecent exposure.” “did draw a knife and revolver upon David Swan” “did utter profane language in loud and boisterous manner.”\n\n“draw a pistol upon Frank Higgins.” “lead a horse on the sidewalk.”\n\nIncluded in the books between 1879 and 1885 (not counting the year long gap of the missing book) were 56 assaults, 240 drunk, 17 “did shoot off a sixshooter”, 146 “disturb the peace and quietude or “did curse, swear, quarrel and use violent threatening indecent language” (includes any profanity and disorderly conduct), 55 “did carry a sixshooter” or “did carry concealed weapon”, and 113 “fighting.” These were the known offenders - how many there were that didn’t get caught is anyone’s guess.\n\n69\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\n70\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nLIFE IN A CROSSFIRE\n\nReverend J.B. Rideout was a Presbyterian minister who lived in Caldwell from 1872 until 1879. Mrs. Rideout, in her book, Six Years on the Border, tells of some of the harsh conditions in which her poor, near destitute family lived and illuminates the unbridled revelry that ran rampant in the lawless infant town. A descriptive snippet follows:\n\n[Caldwell] . . . was at this time [1872] a very rough and wicked place. Two saloons were kept blazing with quarrels and blasphemy day and night, and quite frequently a poor fellow would be sent to a drunkard’s eternity without having time to say, “God be merciful to me, a sinner.” One night, very soon after dark, I sent my little boy to the post office, and in a moment after he had left the house I heard most dreadful screams and oaths, and several shots were fired. I ran to the door and said, “Oh dear! I will not let Winnie go anywhere another night after dark;” and as I looked out, I heard a ball whistle past my head. In a moment my boy came in and said, “They are having an awful fight.” The next morning a young man was lying dead in a house that had been used for a meat-market. I was told that the last words he said were “Lay me on a soft bed,” but they laid him on the hard floor, and there he died.\n\n. . . we rented an old box shanty which stood between the two saloons. During the time we lived in this house I experienced more of the horrors of strong drink than I had ever before imagined could exist anywhere on this fair earth of ours. A thin board partition, which had been perforated with balls and shot, separated our room from one of the dens of vice, which I could not conceive of being surpassed in iniquity and degradation by the “bottomless pit” itself. I need not mention the awful stench—which it was not difficult to imagine as coming from the lower regions—the bitter oaths and obscene language or the shriek and racket as a poor fellow would be\n\n71\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nfelled to the floor when struck on the head by perhaps a brother or a friend; neither need I mention the clatter of broken bottles as the glass would fall to the floor or the mournful and sudden cries and unintelligible expressions of such as suffered with delirium tremens; for all these are the offspring of Bacchus, the outgrowth of such places of death, and branches of the parent stock.\n\nOne man in this saloon was dying with delirium tremens. My husband had known him when he was a sober and respectable man, but a few months were sufficient to complete the sad story; he embraced the boisterous society of that saloon instead of giving his heart to the Saviour [sic]; and there he drank, and there he died. While my husband conversed with him before he passed away he cried out in his wandering thoughts, “Ill go to church when I get well.” A number of his old associates promised to take care of him until morning; but in the morning he was dead, and his companions in sin, who had promised to watch over him, were all asleep on the floor; he died alone. They brought in a rough box, and one took him by the feet and the other by the hair of his head, and they dropped him into that box as though he had been a dead dog.\n\nAs my health was poor, a young friend came to stay with me for a few weeks. One night after she carne a terrible uproar was heard in the saloon; in a moment a crowd gathered in front of our door, and in the midst of horrid yells and curses the cracking of pistols commenced. The young lady screamed and wanted to leave the house, for she said we should all be killed before morning. It was a scene to try the strongest nerves—the constant flash of firearms streaming by the window, accompanied with hoarse voices uttering threats and blasphemous oaths,\n\n72\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nCALDWELL'S NEWSPAPERS\n\nAdvance\n\nCommercial\n\nDaily Messenger\n\nDaily Messenger\n\n& Caldwell News\n\nDaily Standard\n\nEpworth Lever\n\nEye Opener\n\nFree Press\n\nGood Samaritan\n\nIndustrial Age\n\nJournal\n\nMessenger\n\nNews\n\nOklahoma War Chief Post\n\nStandard Weekly Advance Weekly Times\n\n1/3/1902 - 12/27/1916 5/6/1880 - 5/31/1883 2/28/1920 - 1/12/1928\n\n1/13/1928 - 9/7/1942 6/20/1884 - 7/211884 6/1/1897 - 7/1898 12/28/78 - one copy 9/19/1885 - 5/15/1886 6/1896 - 11/1896 7/29/1887 - 1/11/1889 5/17/1883 - 2/22/1894 5/23/1921 - 4/2/1923 1/5/1893 - 12/31/1925 1/12/1883 - 8/12/1886 1/2/1879 - 8/3/1882 2/7/1884 - 9/11/1884 3/1/1894 - 12/27/1901 6/5/1886 - 7/2/1887\n\n73\n\nCALDWELL STUFF\n\nAdditions to the City of Caldwell\n\nOriginal Town\n\nStone’s Addition: Plat filed April 18, 1879 Wallace, Wallace, Webb and Monroe Addition: Plat filed May 20, 1879\n\nStone’s 1st Addition\n\nNew Caldwell Addition: Platted in late 1879 Wallace’s Ad"
