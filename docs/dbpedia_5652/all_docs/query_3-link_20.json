        "text": "Altgelts allied with German leader Meusebach, pioneer Marschalls\n\nEDITORâS NOTE â This is the 151st of a series of articles marking Kerr Countyâs 2006 sesquicentennial.\n\nBy Irene Van Winkle\n\nWest Kerr Current\n\nDr. Mark Altgelt has come home to the Hill Country seeking a life away from the metroplex of Arlington/Fort Worth, where he plied a large dental practice.\n\nMeanwhile, he has begun revisiting the sagas of two of his most famous ancestors â John O. Meusebach (1812-1897) and Ernst Hermann Altgelt (1832-1878) â who were historically crucial to this area, one to the early immigration of Germans to Texas and the other to the founding of Comfort.\n\nAnother associated line is that of the Marschall family, which also left its marks in the lore of German immigrants.\n\nReams of literature and references abound on Meusebach, who engineered the transplantation of the earliest German settlers to New Braunfels and the founding of Fredericksburg. He also signed one of the few treaties with the Comanches that remained unbroken.\n\nThe Altgelt name is also cited repeatedly in historical narratives, since Ernst not only surveyed the land for many landowners in and around Comfort, but built several mills and brought in new citizens to the town.\n\nMark has a huge Altgelt family tree going back to the 1500s, with 11 generations preceding him. His earliest known ancestor was Johann (born 1567), followed by two men named Phillip, two Johanns, a Carl Phillip, and then Ernst Hermann.\n\nThe Adelsverein (Society for the Preservation of Germans) had given Prince Carl Solms Braunfels the task of helping acquire land and populate Texas with fresh German immigrants. After the princeâs efforts soon left them bankrupt, they appointed Meusebach in 1845 as commissioner of the German colony. Meusebachâs handling of the Fisher-Miller grant (3.8 million acres) from the state of Texas proved much more efficient and productive.\n\nMeusebach, born to privilege and nobility in Dillenberg, was named Baron Otfried Hans Freiherr von Meusebach, one of the four surviving children of a high-ranking judge solicitor, Baron Carl Hartwig Gregor von Meusebach, and Ernestine von Witzleben.\n\nAfter attending the Mining and Forest Academy at Clausthal, in 1832 he enrolled in the University of Bonn to study law. He learned five languages, including fluent English, and then went to the University of Halle. He took his bar exams in Neunmberg in 1836, and worked in various administrative positions.\n\nMeanwhile, the winds of change were brewing in Germany, as more stringent rules were being imposed, and some people were anxious to find fresh opportunities.\n\nUnhappy with the oppressions of the Metternich regime, Meusebach cast his lot with the Adelsverein, left his homeland and grasped at the chance for freedom in Texas. Upon his arrival in New Braunfels, he shed his title and the âvonâ from his surname.\n\nMeusebach cut an imposing figure, towering 6 feet 3 inches in height, with red hair and a âflowing fire-red full beardâ which apparently made quite an impression. He was dubbed âRed Sunâ (El Sol Colorado) by Penateka Comanche Chief Ketemoczy when they negotiated a treaty.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1847, Dr. Ferdinand Roemer visited Texas to do a geological survey for the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and kept a detailed journal of his travels. He went with Robert S. Neighbors to meet in council with 10 Comanche chiefs and Meusebach, and Roemer painted an interesting portrait:\n\nâThe three chiefs, who were at the head of all the bands of Comanches roaming the frontiers of the settlements in Texas, looked very dignified and grave. They differed much in appearance. Mope-tshoko-pe (Old Owl), the political chief, was a small old man who in his dirty cotton jacket looked undistinguished and only his diplomatic crafty face marked him. The war chief, Santa Anna, presented an altogether different appearance. He was a powerfully built man with a benevolent and lively countenance. The third, Buffalo Hump, was the genuine, unadulterated picture of a North American Indian. Unlike the majority of his tribe, he scorned all European dress. The upper part of his body was naked. A buffalo hide was wound around his hips. Yellow copper rings decorated his arms and a string of beads his neck. With his long, straight black hair hanging down, he sat there with the earnest (to the European almost apathetic) expression of countenance of the North American savage. ... He had distinguished himself for daring and bravery in many engagements with the Texans.â\n\nOne story in a biography written by his grand-daughter said that a tornado ripped through New Braunfels in 1869 and tore the Meusebach home to the ground. Only Meusebach himself was injured when his leg was pinned under a beam, and he is said to have suffered from it the rest of his life.\n\nHe lost one child who died when he fell out of a tree playing at their home.\n\nThe Marschall, Meusebach and Altgelt families had frequent dealings through the years. After Ernst Altgelt arrived in Comfort in 1854, he worked hard, not only surveying many hundreds of plots for incoming settlers, but also building grist, flour and sawmills. The nearest flour and grist mills were those of C.H. Guenther on the Live Oak River near Fredericksburg. Comfortâs first flour mill (Perseverence Mill) was built about 100 yards due west of where Main Street in Comfort ends.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the propensity for flooding on the Guadalupe River (as much then as in recent times), the mills lasted only a few years. His other efforts, however, proved successful as he made land deals with many settlers.\n\nErnst married Emma Murck, whom he met in New Braunfels in 1855, where she was living with relatives. He was so eager to woo her that he joined the Sangerfest singing group from Sisterdale (as a tenor), traveling to the concert via a team of oxen. Emma, an aspiring journalist, later wrote about her early days in âBeobachtungen und Erinnerungenâ which ran in Guido Ranslebenâs book, â100 Years of Comfortâ:\n\nâDue to the scarcity of females in the frontier areas of the Southwest, proposals of marriage came thick and fast to the young unmarried woman from the homeland from the time the shipâs anchor was lowered on arrival in port.â\n\nThen, the couple finally met, which she described:\n\nâIt so happened that one of the men who attended the Sangerfest in New Braunfels and who found lodging in her friendâs home, was Ernst Altgelt. Returning from a ride through beautiful Landaâs (sic) Park with this dashing cavalier we announced our engagement to my mother and friends and six weeks later we were married in San Antonio. After several daysâ sojourn we returned to New Braunfels from where we started on our eventful trip over rocky paths by way of Sisterdale to the new settlement of Comfort. Thus I abandoned all ambitions I may have had in the field of journalism, to embark on what was to become the greatest career of all â the mother of the children of the man who would carve a garden spot in the wilderness providing comfort for those who had the determination of self-expression and self-preservation.â\n\nErnst and Emma had nine children: Antonie, Herman H., George C., Helena, Ida, August E., Otto, Hugo and Ernst J., but the two youngest died before their father. During the Civil War, some residents of the area favored secession from the North. However, many Germans voted to remain loyal, and Ernst offered his help, wrote Ransleben:\n\nâSome of the avowed Loyalists had to remain in hiding until such time as they felt it safe to get into Mexico in order to avoid either imprisonment, the bearing of arms on the Confederate side, or possible execution. (He) let it be known to those who kept themselves secreted that the latch on his smoke-house (larder) was always open.â\n\nErnstâs health was fragile by then, and he returned to Germany to visit his father, but the âdisturbanceâ raged longer than he had estimated. Meanwhile, Emma managed to run things on her own.\n\nAfter his return, the family relocated to San Antonio in 1866, where he practiced law. Ernst died at his country retreat, âWassenberg,â near the Balcones at Boerne.\n\nErnst and Emmaâs son, August, is the tie to the Marschall line, which in turn, connects to the German aristocrat, John O. Meusebach.\n\nAugust married Helene Marschall whose parents were Otto Marschall (son of Wilhelm von Marschall von Bieberstein and Luise Weiss) and Antonie Meusebach, daughter of John O. and Agnes Coreth Meusebach. Two of Ottoâs younger siblings, Ernst and Willie, wed two of Antoniaâs sisters (Lucie and Emmy, respectively).\n\nThe Marschalls lived on Cherry Creek near the juncture of Mason, Llano and Guadalupe counties. In later years, Meusebach moved to Loyal Valley. He is buried with a number of Marschalls at a historical cemetery there.\n\nMark remembered knowing his great-aunt, Esther Altgelt Riske, Meusebachâs great-granddaughter, and whose grand-aunt was Meusebachâs daughter, Lucy.\n\nâAunt Esther married Ben Riske, and they bought 25 acres in the posh West Lake Hills section of Austin. She was from that old world and a keeper of the family flame,â Mark said. âShe even had some of my great-grandmotherâs letters telling how she caught a train from San Antonio to New Braunfels and then a stage to Llano and Fredericksburg. The trip took three days.â\n\nOne of Lucyâs daughters, Irene Marschall King, whose father was Ernst Marschall, wrote a detailed biography, published in 1967, called âJohn O. Meusebach, German Colonizer in Texas.â\n\nAugust was an attorney, Mark said. He moved to San Antonio with his family, and built the first house on a new street, which he called King William (Wilhelm), thus founding what is still known as the King William District. One of their children was Markâs grandfather, nicknamed, âRed.â\n\nMarschall Denman âRedâ married Mary Catherine Gantt, and the couple had two sons: Marschall David and Edward Gantt. Red was in the U.S. Army, and as an engineer, was one of principal officers responsible for laying the petroleum pipelines for the Alliesâ D-Day invasion during WWII. After the war, he settled in Corpus Christi, where he and his brother, Mason, founded and ran a very lucrative petroleum pipeline business.\n\nLater, Marschall David joined them at Altgelt Petroleum Marketing, Inc. Red bought a 500-acre spread at the House Mountain area in Cherry Springs, where the Marschalls had settled. Mark said he remembered many a happy visit as he and his siblings romped in the orderly and well-planned ranch.\n\nâThere was a little bit of everything there,â Mark said. âWe all had a ball there. It was a great place to be a kid.â\n\nHis grandmother, Mary Catherine, died when Markâs father was 14 years of age, and his grandfather married a woman everyone called âHoney.â\n\nâThey called their place the Red Honey Ranch,â Mark said.\n\nAfter Red died, Honey bought J.J. Knoppâs Sunday House in Fredericksburg, at the corner of Schubert and Milam streets.\n\nMark is the second child of Marschall David Altgelt and Virginia Lee Stanton. His siblings are Marschall Stanton, Catherine and Madelyn âGail.â Marschall Stanton was a professional golfer who retired in San Antonio and passed away in 2005 after a long illness.\n\nMark said his father died young at the age of 38, but left an indelible impression.\n\nâPeople all used to say that a party didnât start until he arrived,â Mark said. âHe was flamboyant and wild. My mother was a professional dancer who went to New York City at the age of 18 to seek her fortune.â\n\nAlthough Virginia hoped Marschall David would take better care of himself, Mark said, he told her he loved his life and wouldnât change it.\n\nAfter his death, Virginia Lee married a jet fighter pilot instructor, Bill Reed, who had courted her earlier.\n\nMark was born in Corpus Christi and attended school there until his fatherâs death in 1963. Later that year, after his mother married Bill Reed, the family moved to the San Fernando Valley in California.\n\nTheir daughter, Karen, once held the title of Miss Arizona.\n\nAfter attending several colleges, including the University of California at San Diego, Mark moved to Dallas. There, he attended Baylor University and graduated from the School of Dentistry in 1980.\n\nHe practiced in the Arlington/Fort Worth area, and married Janie Staples three years later. Janie had two children, Ami and Aaron, from previous marriages. Mark and Janie then had a daughter, Taylor, and a son, Miles Denman.\n\nIn 1997, Mark sold his practice after Taylor, then 12, died abruptly of brain cancer. Although the couple divorced, they both live locally now. Janie works as marketing director at Hilltop Village.\n\nTheir son, Miles, attends Texas A&M University, majoring in geology.\n\nMark still sees patients, and makes removable prosthetics (dentures) in the lab with long-time associate George Chamblee at his office on Tivy Street in Kerrville.\n\nâIâve been fortunate and Iâm just living a simple life now,â Mark said. âI enjoy living and working here ... and then going down to the coast to Aransas Pass to fish.â"
