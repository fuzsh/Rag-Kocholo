        "text": "In its judgment against him, the IMT wrote, \"Superior orders, even to a soldier, cannot be considered in mitigation where crimes as shocking and extensive have been committed consciously, ruthlessly and without military excuse or justification.\" It was also pointed out that while he claimed the Commando Order, which ordered Allied commandos to be shot without trial, was illegal,[dubious – discuss] he had reaffirmed it and extended its application. It also noted several instances where he issued illegal orders on his own authority.\n\nIn his statement before the Tribunal, Keitel said: \"As these atrocities developed, one from the other, step by step, and without any foreknowledge of the consequences, destiny took its tragic course, with its fateful consequences.\" To underscore the criminal rather than military nature of Keitel's acts, the Allies denied his request to be shot by firing squad. Instead, he was executed at Nuremberg Prison by hanging.\n\nOn the day of the execution, Keitel told prison chaplain Henry F. Gerecke \"You have helped me more than you know. May Christ, my saviour, stand by me all the way. I shall need him so much.\" He then received Communion and was executed later that day. Keitel was executed by US Army Master Sergeant John C. Woods. His last words were: \"I call on God Almighty to have mercy on the German people. More than two million German soldiers went to their death for the fatherland before me. I follow now my sons – all for Germany.\" The trap door was small, causing head injuries to Keitel and several other condemned men as they dropped. Many of the executed Nazis fell from the gallows with insufficient force to snap their necks, resulting in convulsions that in Keitel's case lasted 24 minutes. The corpses of Keitel and the other nine executed men were, like Hermann Göring's, cremated at Ostfriedhof (Munich) and the ashes were scattered in the river Isar."
