        "text": "The roots of this name can be found in Switzerland.\n\nAfter the end of the \"The Thirty Years war\" (starting from 1650) a few swiss citizens started to immigrate to Germany mainly to the lands Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hessen and Rheinland-Pfalz.\n\nThere were a lot of families and single persons among these immigrants who beared the name Schollenberger.\n\nKlaus Schollenberger,\n\nHans Schollenberger and\n\nHans Joachim Schollenberger\n\ncould discover this family tree uninterrupted back to 1480.\n\nIt would be a great pleasure for me, Klaus Schollenberger, to get in contact with families of this genealogical tree from all over the world especially from the USA.\n\nAddresses:\n\nKlaus Schollenberger\n\nD 64380 Rossdorf\n\nGermany\n\nPhone : + 49 6154 83235\n\nE-Mail : schollenberger-klaus@t-online.de\n\nHans Schollenberger\n\nUntere Zeilstrasse 10\n\nD 74343 Kleinsachsenheim\n\nGermany\n\nPhone: + 49 7147 7361\n\nHans Joachim Schollenberger\n\nErwin-von-Witzleben-Strasse 8\n\nD 21337 Lueneburg\n\nGermany\n\nPhone: + 49 4131 52637\n\nFinally found the place of birth of an emigrant who settled in America\n\nOn 21 October I received an e-mail from Helen Shollenbarger-Eller, Texas.\n\nShe wrote to me that several persons throughout the US were looking more than 20 years for the descendants of Friedrich Schollenberger.\n\nFriedrich Schollenberger arrived in Pennsylvania on 3 September 1742 at the age of 40 on the ship \"Loyal Judith\".\n\nShe assumed that he had 4 sons named Lorenz, Heinrich, Gerhard and Jacob.\n\nThrough intensive investigation in the US and Switzerland they could not find any trace.\n\nThe descendants of Friedrich had built up a big family tree. Today bearing the names:\n\nShollenbarger, Schallinberger, Shallenberger, Shellenbarger, Shulenberger and Shollenberger.\n\nMy knowledge concerning the family tree of the Schollenberger's, a bit of shrewdness and getting in contact with Hermann Schollenberger in Albig finally led to success.\n\nTwo months later on 20 December 2000 I finally could send Helen all details of the emigrant:\n\nJohann Friedrich Schollenberger born 18 March 1703 in Albig near Alzey (Rheinland-Pfalz / Germany) married 11 January 1729 Anna Katharina Hoppach born 29 March 1701 in Albig.\n\nChildren:\n\nJohann Gerhard born 21 April 1733,\n\nJohann Heinrich born 30 January 1735,\n\nJohann Lorenz born 14 August 1737,\n\nAnna Elisabeth born 14 August 1737,\n\nMaria Magdalena born 7 December 1739.\n\nAnother child with the name Jacob was born in the US.\n\nThis family emigrated from Albig to Pennsylvania/US and arrived on 3 September 1742 with the ship, \"Loyal Judith\".\n\nThe parents of Friedrich Schollenberger:\n\nDietrich Schollenberger, born 1673, died 22 February 1746 in Albig, married 17 February 1699 in Albig Christine Messenkopf, born 1677 in Bechenheim near Albig, died 27 July 1758 in Albig.\n\nThe grandparents of Friedrich Schollenberger:\n\nTilmann or Tilemann Schollenberger born ~1630\n\nPlace of birth ?\n\nDied before 1690.\n\nHis Wife Margarethe, born May 1630.\n\nName of birth ?, Place of birth ?\n\nDied 18 January 1710 in Albig.\n\nThe investigations concerning the place of birth of Tilmann Schollenberger are not yet finished.\n\nIt is very hard to find a trace of him. He might be born in Switzerland, the netherlands or Germany."
