        "text": "PRECEDENTS OF THE S.C.A. COLLEGE OF ARMS\n\nThe 1st Tenure of Da'ud Ibn Auda (2nd year)\n\nSubmission Returns by Name\n\nAbaigeal Fairchild. Device. Per chevron vert and gules, a mullet of eight points voided within a bordure Or.\n\nMost of the commenters felt that a mullet of eight points was too complex a charge to void or fimbriate. This therefore runs afoul of RfS VIII.3, which notes that \"voiding and fimbriation may only be used iwth simple geometric charges pladed in the center of the design.\" 4/92\n\nAbaris Damn Féidh Ciar. Name change from Uilliam of Reisling.\n\nWhile the byname translates literally to the meaning the client desires, it appears to bear the same relation to correct Gaelic that \"Dusky male deer\" bears to \"Sablehart\". A better form would appear to be Damh Dubh or Fiadh Dubh, depending on whether he wishes to emphasise either the masculinity or the \"deer-ness\" of the name. While he allowed minor changes to correct the grammar we felt that these changes did not fall within a \"minor\" range. 02/92\n\nAbdullah bin Omar. Device. Argent, a bear dormant azure.\n\nThe primary charge is unidentifiable in this position as an animal, much less as a bear, and is thus in violation of RfS VIII.3., Armorial Identifiability. 12/91\n\nAdallindis aus Anderbach. Name and device. Ermine, between two flaunches sable a double-headed griffin segreant gules.\n\nConflict with Grantham (Papworth, p. 981), Ermine, a griffin segreant gules. There is one CD for the (improperly drawn) flaunches. 12/91\n\nAdallindis aus Anderbach. Badge. [Fieldless] A double-headed griffin segreant gules.\n\nConflict with Grantham (Papworth, p. 981), Ermine, a griffin segreant gules. Also conflict with Grib (Woodward, p. 1011), Or, a griffin gules. In each case there is one CD for fieldless vs. fielded. 12/91\n\nAdara of Silverwood. Name.\n\nNo one was able to document Adara (Loughead is not considered a reliable source and should not be used without corroborating documentation from other sources). 8/90\n\nAdèle Aethelyan of Moondragon. Name change from Adèle of Moondragon.\n\nAethelyan is not a reasonable variant of Aethelyna. No documentation was presented for reversing the vowel and consonant in any period pattern of names. 3/92\n\nAdenwald the Hazardous. Device. Per chevron azure and plumetty azure and argent, a hawk displayed, wings inverted, Or.\n\nMultiple conflicts, including: De Limesay, Gules, an eagle displayed Or; Bartram, Azure, an eagle displayed Or; Duchy of Westphalia, Azure, an eagle displayed crowned Or; Palatinate of Saxony, Azure, an eagle displayed (sometimes crowned) Or; and Gilbert of the Glens, Azure, an eagle displayed grasping a sun in both claws Or. In each case there is only one CVD, for the field. 7/90\n\nAdiantium, Barony of. Badge for Award of Fern and Quill. Argent, in saltire a feather azure and a fern frond vert.\n\nConflict with Moses von dem Falken (SCA), Argent, a feather azure. There is one CVD for the addition of the frond. 08/91\n\nAdina del Alcázar. Name and device. Purpure, a crescent and on a chief argent a mullet between two Arabic horns vert.\n\nNo submissions forms were included in the Laurel packet for this submission. 04/91\n\nAdrian Silverthorne. Device. Quarterly, gules and argent, in bend two castles argent and in bend sinister two serpents erect to sinister, tail nowed vert, overall a cross sable.\n\nGiven that crosses overall were not infrequently used in marshalled arms in period, this has every appearence of the marshalled arms of Barnstable and O'Drone. 11/91\n\nAdriana nic Aífe de Winterhawke.\n\nNo name forms were received. Additionally, the locative is highly improbable. Dropping the particle \"de\" would probably be sufficient to answer the problem. 9/91\n\nAdrianna Gretchen von Fehmarn. Device. Pean, in bend a teasle sipped and leaved Or and a flax flower slipped and leaved argent.\n\nThe use of two different kinds of plants in different orientations and different tinctures is not period style. Prior Laurel precedent has indicated that we should not use two different kinds of charges of the same general type in a single charge group. 11/91\n\nAdrienne Francesca de Montaigne. Badge. [Fieldless] On a dragon's wing inverted sable a flame argent.\n\nThe primary charge is not identifiable, and the term inverted when applied to wings could create more than one possible emblazon, thus failing the reproducibility test of the RfS (an emblazon must be reproducibly from the blazon). 02/92\n\nAedan MacCormac. Device. Purpure, a sinister hand aversant fesswise proper maintaining a chalice Or.\n\nConflict with Herald of Pleasure, Gules, a dexter gauntlet fesswise proper holding a goblet Or. There is one CD for the field but no difference for either type (hand vs. gauntlet) or tincture (proper [metal] v. proper [metal]) of the primary charge, and the visual similarties when comparing the two emblazons were overwhelming. 05/92\n\nAelfgifu Wolfsängerin. Device. Chapé vert and azure, a chevronel enhanced throughout between a decrescent, an increscent and a wolf ululant coward argent.\n\nThough submitted as \"chapé vert and azure\", we have been consistently blazoning \"charged chapé\" as per chevron throughout. In this case, however, there are additional problems. In addition to the per chevron line starting too high on the field, the chevron (not chevronel; the SCA does not register single diminuitives of ordinaries) acts more like fimbriation than a charge. Were it either problem alone we would probably register this with an instruction to the submitter to \"draw the X properly\". In this case however, the multiplicity of problems warrants return for redrawing. 4/92\n\nAelfred vom Silberwald. Device. Per pale azure and gules, a pale Or between an oak leaf and a goblet argent.\n\nConflict with U.S. Replacement & School Command (MilOrd #1061), Per pale azure and gules, a pale Or, and with the Republic of Chad (flag), Per pale azure and gules, a pale Or. There is only a single CVD in each case, for the addition of the secondaries. 10/90\n\nAelfric Thorfastson. Device. Per chevron inverted azure and gules, a dragon sejant Or.\n\nConflict with Alethia Elphin of Dragonholde, Vert, a dragon sejant, wings elevated and addorsed maintaining in dexter forepaw a crescent Or. There is one CD for the field but nothing for the minor change to posture or the maintained charge. Furthermore, this is not a per chevron inverted field. Per chevron inverted issues from the sides of the field and not the corners of the chief. This could at best be considered a very deep chief triangular, which in this case would be color on color. 11/91\n\nAelfwine Edwineson. Device. Gules, three piles issuant from sinister Or.\n\nConflict with Robert Henderson (Lyon Ordinary Vol. I, p. 320, Gules, three piles issuing from sinister Or, a chief engrailed ermine, and with von Tettau (Rietstap), Gules, three wolves' teeth issuant from sinister argent. In each case there is only one CVD, respectively, for the addition of the chief and for the tincture of the primaries. 12/90\n\nAelfwynn de Montfort of Tweoneam. Device. Quarterly argent and azure, four cinquefoils counterchanged.\n\nConflict with Blood (Papworth, p. 867), Quarterly argent and azure, four quatrefoils counterchanged. There is not really any visual difference between quatrefoils and cinquefoils. 9/90\n\nAelis Helen. Device. Per fess Or and vert, a hedgehog sable between two slippers and a musical note counterchanged.\n\nWithdrawn at the request of the submitter. 8/90\n\nAethelred of Andredesleage. Device. Vert, three dogs dormant in pale, Or.\n\nConflict with Mandeville (Papworth, p. 172), Vert, three wolves passant in pale Or. There is one CVD for the posture of the canines. 08/91\n\nAfonlyn, College of. Device. Sable, a bend wavy between two roundels quarterly arrondi argent and sable each within a laurel wreath argent.\n\nThe roundels were blazoned on the LoI as whirlpools, but it is our understanding that whirlpools or gurges are used as a single, throughout charge on a field, and thus inappropriate for use as multiple secondaries. As reblazoned, there is a clear identifiability problem since they share a tincture with the field. Additionally, there is a conflict problem with Tulse (Papworth, p. 215), Sable, a bend wavy between two dolphins embowed naiant argent, since the roundel/wreath collocations are visually a single group of secondaries, not two groups. As such, there is only a single CVD for changing the type of secondaries. 10/90\n\nAfonlyn, College of. Device. Or, on a cross couped gules a fountain and on a chief gules two laurel wreaths Or.\n\nIn addition to this being at the complexity limits of VIII.1.a, the use of a cross couped gules should probably no longer be allowed in SCA heraldry because of the international treaties and federal law which protect that charge and restrict its use to the International Red Cross (and as a trademark to those who were using it before those treaties went into effect). 05/92\n\nAidan Aileran O'Comhraidhe. Badge change for House Silver Scythe. Per fess wavy azure and argent, a bar wavy azure, overall two straight-hafted scythes in saltire, points outward, argent.\n\nThe scythes have unacceptably poor contrast on the lower half of the field (argent on argent disappears entirely). The visual effect of the bottom half of the field (which is drawn as less than half the field) is of a field per fess wavy azure barry wavy argent and azure. Blazoned this way this is a conflict with Prayers (Papworth, p. 1088), Gules, two scythes in saltire argent, with one CD for the field. 05/92\n\nAileen ní Bhrighde. Device. Azure, a fox passant and in chief three increscents argent.\n\nConflicts with Blaidd Rhydd (Papworth, p. 98), Azure, a wolf passant argent, with Borgoine (Papworth, p. 60), Azure, a talbot passant argent, and with Lloyd Q. (Australian Personal Arms), Azure, a wolf passant argent. In each case there is only one CVD for the addition of the secondaries. Conflict also with Dickinson (Papworth, p. 111), Azure, a war wolf passant and three stars in chief argent, with one CVD for the change to type of secondaries. 06/91\n\nAilis Catriona Mac an Tóisich. Device. Lozengy argent and sable, a seawolf erect gules.\n\nVisual conflict with Ivar Krigsvin, Checky sable and argent a sea-lion erect gules. The visual similarities of these two devices overwhelm any technical differences for field and type of primary. 12/90\n\nAislynn de Darkenhall. Device. Azure, on a bend sinister between two doves close argent, three roses gules.\n\nConflict with Hugh of Ravenwood (SCA), Azure, on a bend sinister between two fleams argent, three gouttes palewise gules. There is only one CVD, for the change to the type of secondaries. The change to type only of the tertiaries is insufficient for the second. 10/90\n\nAislynn Fyrlocc. Name.\n\n\"Fire-lock\" does not appear to be an epithetical name constructed on Period patterns of naming. Most descriptive epithets are much more literal, such as Dustiberd. As noted by one commenter, \"fire-hair\" would appear to describe a cooking accident much more than a hair color. 05/92\n\nAl-Barran, Barony of. Badge for the Order of the Desert Fawn. [Fieldless] A deer statant affronty proper.\n\nSubmitted as a fawn, prior Laurel precident has noted that we do not register baby animals (LoAR August 88 p. 22). The deer is in an heraldically unusual position: that, combined with the three dimensionality of the charge as drawn, pushes it beyond the informal Rule of Two Wierdnesses. 11/91\n\nAlan Jacobsen. Device. Argent, on a cross pointed azure, a mullet of six points elongated to base argent, within a bordure azure.\n\nConflict with Sibbald (Papworth, p. 634), Argent, a square-pierced cross moline within a bordure azure. There is a CVD for the type of cross, but with all the good-will we could muster, we could not find sufficient difference between these two crosses. There is no difference for the changes to type of \"tertiary\". 8/90\n\nAlan Lothinlarsson fra Jorvik. Device. Sable, on a pale rayonny argent a double bitted axe sable entwined of two heraldic roses petalled alternately argent and gules, barbed Or, seeded and slipped vert, in base three goutes de sang.\n\nThe charges on the pale exceed the complexity limits of VIII.1.a. (Complexity Limit) and VIII.1.c.ii (Layering Limit), with three types of charge on the pale and what is effectively four layers (field, pale, axe, roses). The whole effect is noticeably non-period. 05/91\n\nAlan Lothinlarsson fra Jorvik. Name and badge for Kaudiflugastadur. Or, a horsefly rampant to sinister guardant wings elevated and addorsed sable, orbed vert, clad in motley argent and gules.\n\nThe household name does not appear to be correctly formed in Old Norse. The word \"kaudi\" is a noun, but we need its form as an adjective here, since it modifies \"fluga\" (\"fly\"). The genitive singular of \"fluga\" as needed here would be \"flugu\", making the likeliest combination \"flugustadr\". The badge was returned in December of 1989 for non-period style, lack of contrast, and motley of two colors. While the last two issues have been fixed, the former remains. The citations used by the submitter of flies in armory are all in the default position of \"volant en arriere\", and none of them are wearing garb of any kind, much less motley. It seems to be the consensus of the College that a fly rampant and clad in motley exceeds the informal \"Rule of Two Weirdnesses\" and given the College's feelings about birds in a rampant position it is unlikely that a rampant insect would be any more acceptable. 05/91\n\nAlaric von Rottweil. Device. Per saltire gules and argent, a fylfot arrondy counterchanged.\n\nFirst of all, this is not really a fylfot arrondy. It is similar to a cross gammadion, the arms enarched, of the SS Fifth armored division, but has an extra bend in each arm. As drawn it is unblazonable and therefore must be returned. (If drawn as a fylfot arrondy, it would also have to be returned, as fylfots of any kind have always been returned because of their association with the German NSDAP.) 7/91\n\nAlarich Liutpold von Steinman. Device change. Gules an eagle displayed wings inverted and on a chief embattled argent two crosses formy gules.\n\nConflict with Rev. Reid (Lyon, Vol. II, p. 123), Gules, an eagle displayed argent, beaked and membered azure, on a chief embattled of the second a cross moline between two bells sable. There is only one CVD for the changes to the tertiaries. 3/91\n\nAlastair ap Maelgwyn. Device. Per bend Or and bendy sinister argent and sable, in sinister chief a griffin segreant gules.\n\nConflict with Chisenal (Fairbairn's Crests, p. 107), A griffin segreant gules. There is a CVD for field vs. fieldlessness, but position on the field can count for no difference against a fieldless crest or badge. 10/90\n\nAldith Gyffin. Badge. Argent, a blackberry bramble blasted and eradicated purpure, within a bordure wavy sable mulletty argent.\n\nThe primary charge is unidentifiable and consequently unregisterable per RfS VII.7.a. 3/92\n\nAleksandr Yaroslavovich Vyetcikov. Device. Sable, a pall of chain Or between three bezants.\n\nTechnical conflict with Laidlaw (Papworth, p. 464), Sable, a chevron Or between three bezants. Because of the secondaries, we are currently unable to apply X.2 to the primary. If there are no serious objections to the revised wording of X.2 as proposed in the attached cover letter, please have the submitter resubmit this when that wording goes into effect. 9/90\n\nAlesia d'Trenwyth. Name.\n\nHad the submitter allowed minor changes to grammar, we could have registered this as Alesia de Trenwyth. As it is it must be returned because the French \"de\" is not contracted this way before a consonant. Trenwyth seems to be an acceptable variant of Trenewyth, based on several similar variant spellings, including Trenewth and Trenwith. 7/90\n\nAlexander de Toulon and Catrin Rhiannon d'Arc. Badge. [Fieldless] A sea-horse maintaining a rose slipped argent.\n\nConflict with Rowen of Windtree Tower, Per saltire sable and vert, a seahorse erect argent. There is only one CVD for fieldless versus fielded. There is also some question as to the propriety of registering a seahorse to someone with the name Rhiannon, given the long-standing ban on registering horses in combination with the name Rhiannon. 10/91\n\nAlexander de Toulon. Badge. Azure, a seahorse and on a chief invected argent a crescent azure, dimidiated with Per pale azure and sable, in pale a bar and a rose palewise slipped and leaved argent.\n\nThe Rules for Submissions, XI.3, state specifically that \"Armory that appears to marshall independent arms is considered presumptuous\". This submission clearly marshals independent arms. The subtext to XI.3 notes that \"Divisions commonly used for marshalling, such as quarterly or per pale, my only be used in contexts that ensure marshalling is not suggested.\" Dimidiation is one such context. Precedents for not allowing marshalling and dimidiation go back at least as far as the LoAR of October 24, 1979, Master Wilhelm von Schlüssel stated that \"This is very lovely, but it looks like dimidiation, which we do not allow.\" The fact that dimidiation is not specifically mentioned in the new RfS does not mean that it is now excluded from the ban on marshalling. That the submitters may display their registered arms dimidiated (however unidentifiable each coat then becomes) is not disputed, but they may not register them this way.\n\n(Another reason for not registering this particular badge, completely aside from the marshalling/dimidiation question, is the lack of identifiability of the charges, per VIII.3, which requires that \"elements must be used in a design so as to preserve their individual identifiability\". As many of the commenters noted, at least some of the charges on this dimidiated submission are almost totally unidentifiable.) 10/90\n\nAlexandra de la Mer Verte. Badge. Sable, on a vested arm fesswise embowed issuant from dexter holding a sword argent, a compass star sable, in chief a lit candle argent.\n\nThe badge is very complex in that it is unbalanced and appears to have no cohesiveness or unity of design. As such it must be considered a non-period design. 05/92\n\nAlexandra de la Mer Verte. Device. Or, a bend sinister vert between a mortar and pestle and an inkwell and quill sable.\n\nConflict with Pedrwn Merchion, Or, a bend sinister vert between a sword palewise and a double bitted axe palewise sable. There is one CD for the change of secondary charges only. 05/92\n\nAlexandra del Monte di Pietá. Badge. Azure, a salamander rampant reguardant sable, enflamed Or.\n\nConflict with Cenino (Papworth, p. 983), Azure, a salamander Or, in a flame proper. There is only one CVD for the tincture of the salamander. 02/91\n\nAlexandra del Monte di Pietá. Device. Erminois, a pomegranate gules, slipped and leaved vert.\n\nConflict with the Kingdom of Granada (Woodward 339), Argent, a pomegranate gules, slipped and leaved proper; with Reardon (Papworth, p. 888), Argent, a pomegranate gules; and with Bilson (Papworth, p. 888), Argent, a pomegranate proper. The only difference in each case is the field tincture. 02/91\n\nAlexandra del Monte di Pietà. Badge. Azure, a salamander salient reguardant sable, enflamed proper, within a bordure Or.\n\nAs drawn on the large emblazon, the salamander is on a flame gules, fimbriated Or. As a consequence, it is color on color. (Nor have flames fimbriated been allowed for some time.) 02/92\n\nAlexandra di Campaldino. Device. Sable, a thunderbolt argent.\n\nConflict with Blix (Woodward, p. 311), Azure, a thunderbolt argent. There is only one CD for the change to the field. 12/91\n\nAlfredo Gabriel Halcón. Device. Argent, a bend sinister azure, overall a lion rampant guardant contourny within a bordure fleury counterchanged.\n\nCounterchanging an animate charge over an ordinary greatly diminishes its identifiability. That in conjunction with the counterchanging of the complex bordure is simply too much. 01/92\n\nAlfric Northwind. Badge. Azure, fretty, overall a compass star argent.\n\nConflict with the badge of the Barony of Rivenstar (SCA), Azure, a rivenstar argent. There is a CVD for the addition of the fretty to the field, but there was a clear consensus among those attending the meeting that there was not another for the difference between a rivenstar and a standard compass star. 06/90\n\nAlianore d'Astralis. Device. Vert, on a sun Or, rayed alternately Or and gules, between in bend two daggers palewise and in bend sinister two harps, a wyvern gules, bellied vert, webbed and legged argent, and taloned gules.\n\nThis device is simply too complex. The sun rayed alternately of two tinctures, one of them low contrast with the field, the poor contrast of the wyvern's wings with the sun, the use of two different tinctures for the wyvern's torso, and the use of two different types of charges in what is visually a single group of secondaries were simply too much. 10/90\n\nAlina Meraud Bryte and Gavin de Haga. Name for House de Haga of Deodar.\n\nAlthough the addition of the exlocative (\"of Deodar\") would clear the previous problem with the household name, personal households may not incorporate the name of an SCA branch in their name. Thus, the addition of the name of the Shire of Deodar may not be allowed here. 7/91\n\nAlisander du Mont Saint Michel. Change of device. Sable, a unicorn within a bordure embattled argent.\n\nConflict with von Nussdorf (Rietstap, vol. 2, p. 331), De sable a une licorne rampante d'argent accornée d'or (Sable, a unicorn rampant argent, armed Or). There is only one CVD for the addition of the bordure. 9/90\n\nAlistair of Avalon. Device. Azure, a bear's head cabossed Or within a mascle of four swords proper.\n\nConflict with Hartree School Peebleshire (1st quarter) (Lyon Ordinary II, p. 210), Azure, a bear's head affronty Or. There is one CVD for the addition of the swords. 10/91\n\nAlysoun Jeuneterre. Badge for House Catherine's Wheel. Barry wavy argent and purpure, a Catherine wheel counterchanged.\n\nThe household name is not registered, as implied in the LoI. Unfortunately for the client, it cannot be as it conflicts with the Barony of the Wheel. The counterchanging of the badge is excessive and unacceptably reduces the identifiabily of the primary charge. 02/92\n\nAlysoun Jeuneterre. Device. Vert, a cup between three mullets argent.\n\nConflict with Kathleen Erin-go-burn-the-Bragh (SCA), Vert, a chalice argent containing flames Or. There is a CVD for the addition of the secondary mullets, but the flames are really only a held charge, and not worth a second CVD. 01/91\n\nAmalric von Regensburg. Device. Chevronelly argent and azure, a lion rampant to sinister reguardant maintaining in dexter forepaw a sword inverted Or.\n\nConflict with Geldres (Papworth, p. 72), Azure, a lion rampant to the sinister Or; Connour (Papworth, p. 96), Vert, a lion rampant sinisterwise Or; British First Port Task Force Royal Engineers (Military Ordinary 140), Azure, a lion rampant sinister, maintaining in the dexter paw an anchor and in the sinister a sword both palewise, all Or. In each case, there is only one CD for the change to the field. 01/92\n\nAmata Quentin Motzhart. Device. Lozengy sable and argent, a jester's hat gules.\n\nConflict with Bjornsborg, Barony of (SCA), [Fieldless] A cap and bells gules, doubled and belled Or. There is only one CVD, for fielded vs. fieldless. 02/91\n\nAn Dubhaigeainn, Shire of. Badge. Azure, a duck displayed guardant argent billed and membered within a bordure Or.\n\nConflict with Francesca of Bright Angel (SCA), Azure, a dove displayed head elevated argent. There is one CVD, for the addition of the bordure, but we could not in good conscience grant a CVD for type between two white birds in an identical position. 11/90\n\nAn Tir, Kingdom of. Name for Honor of the Lion.\n\nConflict with Lyon King of Arms, Blanche Lyon Pursuivant, Noir Lion Pursuivant, and Finland's Order of the Lion. Changing the designator is insufficient difference. 4/92\n\nAna Isabel Barrios de Perez. Badge. Argent, a domestic cats paw print sable.\n\nSubmitted under the name Ana Isabel Barrios y Perez, this is the registered form of the submitter's name. The badge conflicts with Igor Medved (SCA), Argent, a bear's dexter pawprint azure (with only one CVD for tincture of the primary charge), Eric Bearsbane (SCA), Argent, on a bear's pawprint sable, a flaming sword proper (only one CVD for removal of the tertiary), and Rodrigo de los Lobos (SCA), Argent, on a wolf's pawprint sable, a crescent argent (same count as Eric Bearsbane). It has been previously ruled that there can be no difference given for type of pawprint (LoAR 21 February 1988, p. 11). 06/90\n\nAna Karisa Dmitriev of Plumley. Name change from Ana Dmitriev of Plumley.\n\nKarisa is not a reasonable coined name for Russian. The two elements \"kar-\" and \"-isa\" have entirely different roots and are not separable elements. She might consider the similar (but differently pronounced) Kharissa. 11/91\n\nAnastasia Minskaya. Name and badge for Dom Koshki. Purpure, a wildcat's head cabossed wearing a horned helmet argent and in base two bezants.\n\nThe name of the household is not correctly formed, and there was some doubt as to what they actually wanted. \"House of the Kitten\" (our best guess as to their desires) would be \"Dom Kotyonok\". \"House of the Kittens\" would be \"Dom Kotyat\". The badge conflicts lInda-MUirreal von Katzenbrasse (SCA), Purpure, three cats' heads one and two, the upper cabossed and the lower couped and addorsed, all Or. There is one CVD for the change of type of 2/3 of the group, but nothing for the change to the tincture only of the charge to chief. Additionally, there were several questions by commenters as to the appropriateness (and in two cases, offensiveness) of the design, though the general feeling was that the Law of Toyota should apply here. 10/90\n\nAnastasia Nikolaievna Raskol'nikova. Device. Or, semy of increscents gules, a sun sable.\n\nConflict with Firstman of the Lakes (Fabulous Heraldry #874), Or, a sun sable. There is one CVD, for the addition of the semy. 7/90\n\nAnastazia Winogrodska. Badge. [Fieldless] A demi-swan displayed reguardant argent billed gules.\n\nAs noted by several commenters, the blazon was missing a tincture: the swan is argent, billed gules. As such it conflicts with Hoppe (Papworth, p. 307), Vert, a swan wings expansed argent, with a CVD for fieldlessness. 02/91\n\nAnatar the Unknowne. Name.\n\nAnatar was not shown to be constructed following the rules for name formation from a linguistic tradition compatible with the domain of the Society and the name elements used, as required by RfS II.3. Neither is it entirely \"made-up\": it appears to be a Greek root (the base for anatarasso, \"stir up, make trouble\") and Latin (anatanaria, a species of eagle). And if that were not enough, Annatar (\"Lord of Gifts\") is the name given himself by Sauron, noted in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion. 02/91\n\nAndré Jean Faucon. Device. Sable, a falcon close, in chief a comet fesswise, in base two barrulets engrailed and invected Or.\n\nThere are two problems with the device. First, it conflicts with Artus (Papworth, p. 304), Sable, an eagle close Or, and with Anne Gaverel d'Avesor, Sable, a peregrine falcon close, belled and jessed Or, orbed gules, maintaining in dexter foot a fountain. In each case there is only one CD for the addition of the secondaries. Second, given that all of the charges have what amounts to the same visual \"weight\", this is effectively \"slot machine heraldry\", with three different types of charge in a standard heraldic arrangement. 12/91\n\nAndrea of Snow Roses.\n\nThe byname is not a reasonable locative. As Lord Badger noted, while each of the two parts of the byname were used in period, they were not used in the same kinds of bynames. To be used in a period manner, snow would have to be a reasonable discriptive adjective to apply to roses. Barring documentation of such a use in period, this must be returned. 10/91\n\nAndrew Buchanan. Device. Bendy sinister of eight argent and gules, a sword bendwise inverted counterchanged and in sinister chief a thistle slipped and leaved purpure.\n\nThe counterchanging of the sword on the field renders its identifiability extremely problematical. The silhouette is so broken up by the counterchanging across the bendy field that it becomes extremely difficult to identify, defeating one of the basic principles of period-style heraldry, quick identification. 11/91\n\nAndrew Wyrmholde. Device. Per chevron Or and argent, in pale a dragon passant azure, breathing flame proper, and a gauntlet aversant sable, all within a bordure vert.\n\nWith three types of charge and six tinctures this exceeds the rule of thumb for complexity of XIII.1.a in the Rules for Submissions. This would be ever so much better if the gauntlet and bordure were azure. 08/91\n\nAngela di Firenze. Device. Azure, two rainbows in pale proper.\n\nConflict with Pfull (Woodward, p. 114), Azure, three rainbows in pale proper. There is one CD for the change to the number of the charges. 12/91\n\nAngela Sara Maria Diaz de Valdes. Badge. [Fieldless] A gem ring Or set with six emeralds vert, overall a galleon sable, sailed gules.\n\nWe need documentation that this type of ring (with stones all the way around the outside edge) is period, not to mention the need for documentation that the raised settings for the stones on the ring are period. 10/91\n\nAngela Sara María Díaz de Valdés. Blazon correction. Paly of eight gules and Or, three towers in fess sable.\n\nAs a number of commenters noted, we normally do not blazon the number of traits in a paly field unless there is some overriding need to. Paly fields are most commonly of six or of eight, and neither needs to be blazoned. 05/92\n\nAngharad Chy a tyr Sterrenow. Badge. [Fieldless] A rose between three mullets of four points one and two azure.\n\nThis fieldless badge consists of disparate charges without even a unifying visual theme, in violation of RfS VIII.5, Fieldless Style (\"Fieldless armory must form a self-contained design\"). 01/91\n\nAngrim the Unreasonable. Badge. Argent, goutty de sang, a skunk tergiant proper and overall three barrulets indented gules.\n\nThis design (as is almost any \"road-kill\" heraldry) is obtrusively modern, in violation of RfS VIII.4. 10/90\n\nAngrim the Unreasonable. Device. Azure, two towers in pale between two bears combattant argent each maintaining a sword Or.\n\nConflict with the Burgh of Rose Hearty (Public Heraldry, p. 6), Azure, two bears combattant argent, muzzled gules, supporting between their paws a cinquefoil argent. There is one CVD for the addition of the towers, but their small size in relation to the bears means that they cannot be counted as the primary charges under X.1. The muzzling of the bears and the maintained cinquefoil of Rose Hearty are not sufficient for the second necessary CVD. 11/90\n\nAngus of Blackmoor. Device. Argent, a stag's skull caboshed within a bordure sable.\n\nConflict with Snokishull (Papworth, p. 909), Argent, a buck's head cabossed sable, tips of all attires Or. There is a CVD for adding the bordure, but the differences between a buck's skull and a buck's head cabossed are nearly non-existent. 9/90\n\nAngus of Blackmoor. Device. Sable, two suns Or, on a chief triangular argent a stag's skull sable.\n\nThis is not a chief triangular. Nor is it a pile, per chevron inverted, or chaussé. It is somewhere between all of these and as such cannot be registered. If he wishes to resubmit with a real chief triangular (that is to say, extending down into the field only about half as far as this does), we would be happy to reconsider this. 7/91\n\nAnna Mitrofavnova. Device. Purpure, a cat sejant within a bordure argent.\n\nConflict with Freydís ór Thelamörk, Purpure, a fox sejant within a bordure argent. There is one CD for the change to the type of primary, but X.2 does not apply here. 6/92\n\nAnna of Emporshire. Name.\n\nThe locative is composed of two different languages in a single word, and no documentation was submitted showing that either English shires could be formed with the name of a foreign city or that formation of a shire name in English would drop that final vowels before \"-shire\". Would the submitter consider simply using the documented city Emporiae? 01/91\n\nAnna Zauberkünsterlin. Device. Or, a fox rampant gules wearing a fool's cap vert, in chief three golpes one and two all within a bordure dovetailed sable.\n\nWith four types of charge in five tinctures, this exceeds the complexity limits of RfS VIII.1.a. This would probably be acceptable if the client would make the color of the bordure one of the other colors already used in the device. (Either gules or purpure would probably work best.) 05/92\n\nAnna Zauberkünstlerin. Device. Or, a fox rampant gules wearing a fool's cap vert and three golpes in chevron.\n\nThe \"fox\" is unrecognizable as such. It has a very distinctive lion's tail and the hood obscures the head where a lion's mane would normally be. If it is really a fox this conflicts with James the Fox, Or, a fox rampant guardant gules, with one CD for adding the golpes (they are purpure on the large emblazon, not blue [hurts] as blazoned in the LoI). If treated as a lion this conflicts with Gryffudd (Papworth, p. 82), Or, a lion rampant gules, by the same count. 11/91\n\nAnnabella Kirkpatrick. Device. Argent, a saltire engrailed sable and on a chief gules three doves migrant argent.\n\nConflict with Johnston (Papworth, p. 1064), Argent, a saltire engrailed sable, on a chief gules three cushions Or. There is one CD for the changes to type and tincture of the tertiaries. 02/92\n\nAnnabelle Marie Fitzsimmons. Device. Sable, a natural rainbow proper between in chief two pansies Or and in base a swan naiant argent.\n\nTechnical conflict with Laurel Venustas di Firenze (SCA), Sable, a rainbow proper between in chief two crosses crosslet fitchy and in base a rose slipped and leaved Or. There is only one CVD here, for the change in type to all of the secondaries. While the precedent in the Cover Letter of 6 September 1990, p. 2, defines the bottommost of three charges around an ordinary as half a group for purposes of counting difference, a rainbow is not an ordinary. Additionally, the natural rainbow proper also has extremely poor contrast with the sable field, enough so that its identifiability is significantly reduced. The submitter is advised to use an heraldic rainbow (on a sable [color] field, banded Or, gules, vert and argent) when she resubmits. 01/91\n\nAnne de Silva. Device. Vert, two chipmunks sejant respectant proper supporting between them an acorn Or.\n\nThe chipmunks, being mostly brown, have very poor contrast with the vert field (color on color). 04/91\n\nAnne des Sept Monts. Device. Azure, a fess indented on the upper edge Or and in chief a dove volant argent.\n\nConflict with Percy (Papworth, p. 702), Azure, a fess indented Or, as cited in the LoI. While there is a CVD for the addition of the secondary in chief, changing the complex line of division on the lower edge of the ordinary is not worth a second. (See the return of John Richard de Holloway, November 1990 LoAR for more discussion of this issue.) 01/91\n\nAnne des Sept Monts. Device. Azure, a dove volant argent and a base indented Or.\n\nConflict with Kreis (Renesse, Volume I, page 408) Azure, a dove volant argent. There is only one CD for the addition of the secondary. 4/92\n\nAnne Redlocks. Device. Azure, in bend two fleurs-de-lys Or and in bend sinister two swans naiant argent.\n\nThough the field has but a single tincture, the appearance of marshaled arms is overwhelming. The eye tends to \"draw\" the quarterly division even though each of the \"quarters\" is azure. 12/90\n\nAnne Winterskye.\n\nConflict with Anna of Skye (SCA). As much as we sympathize with Lord Dragon's position, we cannot bring ourselves to go along with his arguments because of the way that the Rules for Submission are worded. The only consistent interpretation that we could make was to consider Winterskye to be the addition of an adjective to the noun Skye (or sky). 7/91\n\nAnnes Clotilde von Bamburg. Device. Per chevron gules and vert, a chevron embattled between three crosses botonny Or.\n\nConflict with Parkins (Papworth, p. 412), Azure, a chevron embattled on the top between three crosses crosslet fitchy Or. Evidence was presented that period heralds saw no difference between crosses and crosses fitched, nor did the modification of the bottommost limb of four appear to give adequate visual difference to grant a CVD. 10/90\n\nAnnyse Lionstone. Device. Gules, a Latin cross pomelly sable fimbriated and surmounted in base by a lion passant Or.\n\nConflict with Braunston (Papworth, p. 614), Gules, a cross pommetty voided Or. There is a CVD for the addition of the overall charge, but changing the tincture only of what is effectively a tertiary charge (the voided area of the cross) is insufficient for the second. 06/91\n\nAnsgar of Aachen. Device. Quarterly Or and sable, a mullet of four points counterchanged.\n\nConflict with Eleanor Leonard (SCA), [Fieldless] A mullet of four points distilling a gout. There is only one CVD, for fieldlessness. 11/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Athena Herald Extraordinary.\n\nConflict with the Order of Athena, registered to the Barony of the Angels. 7/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Rapier Herald.\n\nConflict with Silver Bear Rapier Company, registered to Jean de Clermont. Removal of the string of adjectives is insufficient per RfS V.2. 3/92\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Rapier Herald.\n\nConflict with the Carolingian Rapier Company. 05/91\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Sable Falcon Herald.\n\nConflict with the Falcon Herald. Per V.1 and V.2, addition of an adjective is insufficient. 7/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Iris Herald.\n\nConflict with the Blue Iris Pursuivant and aural conflict with the Ibis Herald (to the extent that one commenter even wrote Ibis for this submission). 7/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Badge for Award of the Sable Falcons. [Fieldless] A falcon sable jessed sable and Or maintaining a mullet of five greater and five lesser points sable.\n\nConflict with Meryck (Papworth), Per fess azure and purpure, in chief a hawk holding a fleur-de-lys sable; with Ernton (Papworth, p. 297), Argent, an eagle close sable; with Corbett (Papworth, p. 295), Argent, a raven sable; and with De Weert (Woodward, p. 262), Argent, a falcon sable hooded, lined and membered Or. In each case there is only one CVD, for fieldlessness. 9/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Sable Comet Pursuivant.\n\nConflict with the Comet Pursuivant. Per V.1 and V.2, addition of an adjective is insufficient. 7/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Sable Thistle Pursuivant.\n\nConflict with the Scottish Order of the Thistle. Per V.1 and V.2, addition of an adjective is insufficient. 7/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Argent Lion Pursuivant.\n\nConflict with Lyon King of Arms. Per V.1 and V.2, addition of an adjective is insufficient. 7/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Bofors Pursuivant.\n\nGiven the common usage in the SCA of calling the holder of an heraldic title \"Lord X\" or \"Lady X\", heraldic titles taken from real-life places falls under the Prohibition of Landed Titles of Corpora (Appendix C, Administrative Rules of the College of Arms). 11/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Sigil Pursuivant.\n\nConflict with the Order of the Sigil of Æthelmearc. 11/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Estoile Pursuivant.\n\nCurrently registered to the West Kingdom. 7/90\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for White Raven Pursuivant.\n\nConflict with House White Raven. 05/91\n\nAnsteorra, Kingdom of. Title for Oerlikon Pursuivant.\n\nGiven the common usage in the SCA of calling the holder of an heraldic title \"Lord X\" or \"Lady X\", heraldic titles taken from real-life places falls under the Prohibition of Landed Titles of Corpora (Appendix C, Administrative Rules of the College of Arms). 11/90\n\nAnthea Maecenas. Name and badge for House Warrington. [Fieldless] A cross couped gules irradiated Or.\n\nWarrington is a real place in the middle ages and should not be registered to a single individual in the SCA. The badge conflicts with the insignia of the International Red Cross, not by our rules, but by theirs. As stated in Corpora Appendix A, \"the Society recognizes the absolute precedence of law issued by civil authorities over any of its internal rules.\" International treaty severely restricts the use of a cross couped gules, and this takes precedence over any of the Rules for Submission, including those for difference, of the SCA. 02/92\n\nAntigone Racine. Device. Per pale sable and gules, a dulcimer hammer palewise Or surmounted by two needles in saltire argent.\n\nNo documentation was included for this form of dulcimer hammer, nor does it match the form of dulcimer hammer documented in previous registrations. Without such documentation we cannot register this form of dulcimer hammer. 3/92\n\nAntoine le Rêveur. Device. Per pale argent and sable, a rose gules and a rose argent, each slipped, leaved, barbed and seeded proper, stems crossed in saltire.\n\nBoth visually and technically this is in conflict with Diarmaid ap Gwilym (SCA), Per pale argent and gules, two roses slipped, the slips enarched and entwined along the line of division, counterchanged, seeded counterchanged\". There is one CVD, for the change to the field. The change to the slips from what is essentially \"in pall\" to in saltire is not sufficient to generate the second CVD, especially given the poor contrast of one of them against half the field. Visually, the resemblance is just too strong as well. 11/90\n\nAnton Embriaco del' Lupo. Name.\n\nWithdrawn at the request of Star. The submitter's name was registered (from a Meridien letter of intent) in May 1989 as Antonio Embriaco del Lupo. 9/90\n\nAnton Tremayne. Badge. Checky argent and sable, a cross bottony and a bordure gules.\n\nConflict with Chysual (Papworth p. 634), Argent, a cross crosslet fitchy within a bordure gules. There is a CVD for the field but nothing for the difference between crosses crosslet and bottony or for the fitching of the lower limb. 7/91\n\nAnton Tremayne. Badge. Checky argent and sable, a cross botonny gules.\n\nConflict with Brereghly (Papworth, p. 604), Argent, a cross botonny gules, and with Gullat (Papworth, p. 614), Or, a cross botonny gules. In each case there is only one CVD for the change to the field. 9/90\n\nAodh Adendra Marland. Name and device. Sable, seme of compass stars, a tree eradicated argent, leaved of flames proper.\n\nThe use of the Greek Adendra here is more than mildly eccentric. The use of a Greek adjective (as opposed to a Greek name element) in the middle of an Irish/English name seems unlikely. We would prefer to see some evidence of at least a pattern of similar naming practices in period. As for the device, there are a couple of problems. Even on the large emblazon, the compass stars are not so much a semy as they are in orle. Further, they vary radically in size. Additionally, the charge registered to her husband's household is not a tree of flames; it is in fact two charges, a tree blasted argent and in chief flames Or. Thus, the primary on this proposal is not grandfathered nor is it period style, and we will need evidence of its compatability with period style before we may register it. 11/91\n\nAoibheall Dylon. Badge. Sable, a dragon rampant environed of a crescent argent.\n\nSince the crescent is fairly clearly the primary here, this conflicts with Densel, Sable, a crescent enclosing an eight-pointed estoile argent. Were the dragon considered the primary, this would conflict with Alexander Greylorn, Sable, a dragon segreant, incensed of icy breath, and a chief rayonny argent. 7/90\n\nAoibheall Dylon. Device. Sable, a pall inverted and voided between in chief two dragons rampant and in base a crescent argent.\n\nConflict with Urho Waltterinen, Sable, on a pall inverted argent a chevron rompu sable. There is one CVD for the addition of the secondaries, but we could not in good faith grant another for the difference between a pall inverted \"charged with a chevron rompu\" and a pall inverted \"charged with a pall inverted\". 7/90\n\nAonghas O hAonghusa of Stratafon. Device. Per chevron argent and gules, two boar's heads couped close, each resting on a torse, sable and a lion rampant reguardant Or.\n\nThe fact that each boar's head rests on a torse makes each one a crest. \"You cannot use a crest as a charge.\" (Wilhelm von Schlüssel, LoAR 26 May 1983, p. 19. See also LoAR of 21 February 1984, p. 11) 01/91\n\nAquila Blackmore. Device. Argent vêtu ployé gules, a mullet sable within a bordure argent.\n\nAs drawn, the emblazon shows the bordure overall. If the client would redraw this so that the corners of the vêtu are not cut off by the bordure, this design would be acceptable. 02/92\n\nArafel of Caerlleon. Name.\n\nThe name was submitted as invented by C.J. Cherryh (in The Dreamstone). However, the name there was used only by an elf (the last living one in that world), and hence not suitable for humans. The purported derivation by Cherryh of Arafel from Aoibheil seems extremely unlikely. And although the two themes of the name, \"ara\" and \"fel\", appear in Searle's Onomasticon Anglo-Saxonicum (pp. 72 and 240, respectively), the fact that they appear without any examples of their use in actual names (and that they are not in his extensive list of themes on pp. xv-xix) makes them suspect, to say the least. (Searle seems to indicate that \"-fel\" may be a misreading of \"-wulf\", and \"ara\" refers the reader to \"Haraldus\", where it is more clearly not a protheme.) The Anglicized form of Caerleon has only a single \"l\" (and it does make a difference in pronunciation). 3/91\n\nArianna Kateryn Nunneschild. Device. Gules, a stag rampant between three decrescents argent.\n\nConflict with Martellini dit Della Cerva (Renesse Vol. 2, Page 480), Gules, a stag rampant argent. There is only one CD for the addition of the secondaries. 02/92\n\nArianwen ferch Lawen. Device change. Azure, a falcon striking within a bordure embattled argent.\n\nConflict with the Shire of the Osprey (SCA), Azure, an osprey stooping within a laurel wreath argent. There is one CVD for the change from laurel wreath to bordure, but a visual comparison of the birds' positions demonstrated that they are too close to allow the necessary second one. 02/91\n\nAriel O Raithbheartaigh Floinn. Device. Argent, on a mullet vert a lynx's face argent.\n\nConflict with Ciarna d'Avignon, Argent, ermined vert, on a mullet vert a fox's mask argent. There is one CD for the field, but the change of type only of the tertiary, particularly since they are both animal's heads in the same position, is not sufficient for the second. 01/92\n\nArielle of Dragonwyck. Device. Argent, a fret vert, overall a dragon dormant purpure.\n\nThere was a severe problem even on the full size emblazon with the identifiability of the overall charge. (See RfS VIII.2: \"All armory must have sufficient contrast to allow each element of the design to be clearly identifiable at a distance.\") The submitter might consider a different position for the dragon: passant or statant would make it much more readily identifiable. 10/90\n\nArienne of Greylyn. Name.\n\nSince \"arienne\" (by the submitter's own documentation) is a French word (meaning \"follower of Arius\"), we need documentation for the use of Arienne as a name. As the submitter's forms allowed no changes, we could not subsitute the similar sounding, documented form \"Ariane\". 8/90\n\nArima Jinsuke Shirotora. Device. Sable, a Bengal tiger salient argent marked sable between two gores argent.\n\nThe gores are incorrectly drawn, even for a roundel-shaped field: they would not be symmetrical along the fess line, but would touch in base. Conflict with Arbouin (Papworth, p. 93), Sable, a lion rampant argent. In keeping with the precedent set by Mistress Alisoun in the LoAR of December, 1989, there is not a CVD for the difference between a lion and a natural cat (of any size). 10/90\n\nArmuin of Dunvegan. Name.\n\nThe submitter's own documentation is very clear that \"armuin\" is a title meaning \"steward\", \"warrior\", or \"hero\". It is not a given name. Would he consider the similar sounding (but documented) name \"Ermyn\" (Reaney's Dictionary of British Surnames, under \"Armin\" - \"Ermyn Donetoun, 1327\")?. 01/91\n\nArnkatla Solveigardottir. Device. Vert, a sea-ewe naiant and a bordure wavy argent.\n\nConflict with Kaylitha Rhiannon of Southhaven, Vert, a sheep courant within a bordure wavy argent. There is one CD for the difference between a sheep and a sea-ewe, but X.2 does not apply. 02/92\n\nArnkatla Solveigardottir. Device. Vert, a sea-ewe naiant argent.\n\nConflict with Lambert (Papworth, p. 97) Vert, a lamb argent. There is a CVD for changing the lamb to a sea-lamb but the consensus among the commenters was that X.2 does not apply here. 08/91\n\nArtemidore de la Coeur Sincere. Device. Per chevron argent and sable, two fleurs-de-lys and a stag courant counterchanged within a bordure engrailed gules.\n\nConflict with Nelson, Per chevron argent and sable, three fleurs-de-lys counterchanged. There is a CVD for the addition of the bordure, but nothing (at this point in time) for changing type of one of the three primaries. 7/90\n\nArtemisia Lacebrayder. Device. Gules, a senmurv between three lace-making bobbins palewise Or.\n\nThe secondaries were unrecognizable as lace bobbins, even by some familiar with them through use. This is being returned for redrawing. (The senmurv was quite recognizable, and is not a problem.) 12/90\n\nArtemisia, Principality of. Name for Order of the Papillon of Artemisia.\n\nConflict with the Papillon Pursuivant. 11/90\n\nArtemisia, Principality of. Name for the Artemisian Tank Corps.\n\nThe name here is intrusively modern. The fact that the individual elements may be period (though with different meanings than the submitters are desirous of) is overwhelmed by the modern connotations of the phrase. 02/91\n\nArtemisia, Principality of. Name and badge for Order of the Pillar of Artemisia. [Fieldless] A sprig of sagebrush bendwise vert surmounted by a Doric column argent.\n\nThe name conflicts with the Order of the Pillar registered to the Barony of the Bridge, and with the Order of the Pillars of Ansteorra. The \"sprig of Sagebrush\" is drawn identically to a sprig of laurel. Given that, we would appreciate documentation that what was drawn on the emblazon is the correct leaf shape and placement for sagebrush. 11/90\n\nArtemisia, Principality of. Badge for Order of the Golden Feather of Artemisia. [Fieldless] A feather palewise Or.\n\nConflict with Dáshive Luciana d'Avignon (SCA), Purpure, an ostrich plume Or. There is one CVD, for fieldlessness, but the change to type of feather is not worth a second. 11/90\n\nArtemisia, Principality of. Badge for Order of the Gryphon's Talon. Sable, on a pile throughout Or, a talon issuant from chief sable.\n\nConflict with Gabriel (Papworth, p. 1023), Sable, on a pile Or, billets 4, 3, 2, and 1 of the field. There is only one CVD, for changing the type and number of tertiaries. 11/90\n\nArtemisia, Principality of. Badge for Order of the Gryphon's Heart of Artemisia. Sable, a winged heart, wings displayed and inverted, Or.\n\nConflict with Samby (Fairbairn's Crests, p. 419), A winged heart Or. There is only one CVD, for fieldlessness of the crest versus the field of this proposal. 11/90\n\nArtur Haun. Name.\n\nNo one could document Haun even as a Welsh word, much less as a name or name element. One commenter stated that \"Haun is on page 213 of Bahlow\", but without any further information, and with no way of doublechecking that source, we could not determine whether Haun was appropriate for use here. 4/92\n\nArval Benicoeur. Badge change. A fountain.\n\nConflict with Richard Tyler of Swiftwater, Per fess indented Or and azure, masoned Or, in chief a fountain. There is only one CVD, for fieldlessness. 12/90\n\nArven Atwater. Device. Per bend gules and sable, on a bend between a crescent bendwise sinister and a natural seahorse bendwise Or three trefoils palewise vert.\n\nThe device is right at the very limits of the rule of thumb for complexity with four tinctures and four types of charge. That, in combination with the nonstandard posture of any of the charges (with the sole exception of the bend), pushes it over the edge of acceptability. 12/91\n\nAryana van Wyck. Device. Or, a dove volant wings addorsed azure grasping in its beak an olive branch vert.\n\nConflict with Williams (Or, a falcon volant azure), as cited in the LoI. There may possibly be a CVD for bird type here (see my comments above on the return of Bran Gwyn ap Caw ap Maelgwn (Calontir) for a fuller explanation), but certainly not the substantial kind of change required by X.2. 01/91\n\nAsa Guthröthsdottir. Device. Argent, a bend sinister azure between a maiden statant to sinister, proper crined Or vested vert holding a sword and a loom sable.\n\nThere are two problems with this device. The first is complexity. We have four charges and six tinctures which exceeds the rule of thumb of VIII.1.a. The second problem is the identifiability of the charge in base. It is not a recognizable loom. If it is meant to be an inkle loom, we need documentation for its existence in Period in this form. 08/91\n\nAshikawa Kameko. Badge. [Fieldless] A turtle sable.\n\nConflict with Esslinger (Siebmacher plate 51), Or, a turtle sable. There is one CD for the change of fielded to fieldless. We share Lord Trefoil's doubts regarding dismissing conflicts from the Matsuya Piece Goods Store on a \"pick and choose\" basis. As we have said before regarding some of the names in Withycombe or armory in Fabulous Heraldry, we are unwilling to start making lists of exceptions to standard references. The clear conflict with Esslinger simplifies matters this time; however, unless and until Matsuya can be shown to be unreliable in a manner similar to, say, Loughead, we will continue to use it for conflict checking. 11/91\n\nAslaug of Nidaros. Badge. Gules, a drinking horn fesswise reversed distilling gouttes, in chief three ansuz runes conjoined at the base in pall inverted Or.\n\nConflict with Hornacot, (Papworth, p. 949), Gules a bugle horn stringed Or. There is only one CD for the addition of the secondary charges in chief. By prior Laurel precedent (in the decision on the current Laurel's badge), the addition of the gouttes is not significant enough to count for a CD. 01/92\n\nAtenveldt, Barony of. Badge for the Performing Arts Guild. Gules, a triple-tiered arch argent.\n\nConflict with Arches (Papworth, p. 351), Gules, three arches conjoined in fess argent, caps and bases Or. There are no CVDs between these two pieces of armory. 08/91\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Change of device for Crown Heir's Arms. Azure, a sun in his splendor Or within a laurel wreath argent and in chief a crown of three greater and two lesser points Or, overall a label argent.\n\nAs several commenters noted, Laurel precedent will not allow us to register the Kingdom arms with a label to the heirs of the Crown. See LoAR of 31 October 1984, p. 16, for a fuller discussion of this issue. There is, however, no bar to the heirs of the Crown bearing this device with the permission of the Crown. 08/91\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Name for Order of the King's Gauntlet of Atenveldt.\n\nConflict with the Award of the King's Gauntlet of Ansteorra. Perhaps a letter of permission to conflict could be obtained. 01/91\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Name for Order of the Defenders of the Dream, the Lions of Atenveldt.\n\nThe name of the Lions of Atenveldt is already registered per the Cover Letter to the June 1990 LoAR. Does the kingdom really want to add the non-period style descriptive in front of the currently registered order name? 01/91\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Name for Order of the Queen's Cypher of Atenveldt.\n\nConflict with the Order of the Queen's Cypher of both the East and West Kingdoms. Perhaps a letter of permission to conflict could be obtained from each of these kingdoms. 01/91\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Badge for the Order of the Lions of Atenveldt. [Fieldless] On a sun Or, eclipsed azure, a lion's head cabossed Or.\n\nBecause this is effectively \"[Fieldless] On a sun Or, a hurt charged with a lion's head cabossed Or\", the lion's head is effectively a quaternary charge, and therefore exceeds our layering limits. There was also some question as to whether this conflicts with Townsend (Papworth, p. 1100), Azure, a sun in glory Or. The azure \"eclipsing\" is nearly hidden behind the lion's head, which itself greatly resembles the face on a sun in its glory. 01/92\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Badge for the Order of the Lions of Atenveldt. Per pale argent and azure, a lion's head cabossed and a bordure Or.\n\nConflict with Caitlin MacDonnell, Vert, a lion's head erased affronty Or, gorged of a wreath of thistles purpure slipped and leaved vert within a bordure Or. There is one CD for the field, but nothing for cabossed versus erased affronty, and the gorging on Caitlin's device does not have the weight of a tertiary charge and so cannot add difference here. 05/92\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Name for Order of the Legion of the Sword of Honor.\n\nThe order name here does not appear to follow any Period order name that anyone could find. The use of multiple nouns modifying other nouns creates a semantic nightmare. Depending on how one interprets the structure of the various phrases in its name, this could be considered to conflict with the Order of the Sword or with the Legion of Honor. 01/92\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Badge for Order of the Light of Atenveldt. Per pale aregent and azure, a sun in its glory and a bordure Or.\n\nConflict with Fridrikr Tomasson av Knusslig Hamm, Barry wavy argent and azure a sun within a bordure Or. There is one CD only for the change to the field. 6/92\n\nAtenveldt, Kingdom of. Badge for Order of the Azure Archers of Atenveldt. Azure, a sun in his splendor Or within seven pheons in annulo, points outward, argent.\n\nConflict with Alden (Papworth, p. 1100), Azure, the sun in splendor Or, and with Townsend (Papworth, p. 1100), Azure, a sun in glory Or, and with Abraham (Papworth, p. 1100), Azure, a sun Or. In each case there is one CD for the addition of the secondaries. 01/92\n\nAtlantia, Kingdom of. Badge for Queen's Champion. [Fieldless] Two tridents in saltire Or, surmounted by an escallop erminois, between four roses gules, barbed and seeded proper.\n\nPlease do not use the term \"ermines\", as it is confusing. In this case (as with the submission of Bebinn of Bury St. Edmonds) the fur was actually erminois. (The SCA normally uses the term counter-ermine for the fur British heralds call ermines.) From a study of the way the ermine spots were drawn, it appears that the emblazon was submitted upside down on both the LoI and the submission forms. This is being returned because it is a fieldless badge having disconnected charges of two tincture classes, color and metal. This has not been allowed for some time (this precedent was, in fact, written into the old rules as AR13b). Additionally, it is very busy for a badge, with seven charges of three types and four tinctures. 7/90\n\nAtlantia, Kingdom of. Title for Conch Pursuivant.\n\nConflict with Conk Pursuivant, listed in the 1987 Armorial. 3/92\n\nAtlantia, Kingdom of. Name and badge for Office of the Chatelaine. Azure, a ring of two keys and a chief wavy argent.\n\nThe name is far too generic to register to a single group. The badge needs to be submitted on a roundel, not an escutcheon, as it is not a device. 04/91\n\nAvacal, Principality of. Device. Quarterly argent and Or, a griffin segreant maintaining a sword and arrow gules, the sword environed of a laurel wreath vert.\n\nConflict with Nearnes (Papworth, p. 980), Argent, a griffin segreant gules holding in each claw a key proper. There is one CD for the field, but nothing for the assorted maintained charges. There were several other Papworth and Woodward conflicts, mostly \"(Field), a griffin segreant gules\". Additionally, a number of commenters expressed concern that the laurel wreath did not constitute \"a significant element of the design\", as required by the Administrative Handbook, I.D.2. 4/92\n\nAvacal, Region of. Device. Quarterly argent and Or, a griffin segreant maintaining a sword and arrow gules, the sword environed of a laurel wreath vert.\n\nThe name is registered as a herald's title to the kingdom of An Tir. No paperwork was received for a designator change. While in the past arms have been registered to the regions of Ansteorra and Calontir, a number of commentors questioned whether this is a precedent we should still follow. In a discussion with the Chairman of the Board of Directors, she recommended against the registration of the names and armory of regions. Might we suggest that the region send in the paperwork for a change in status to that of principality? 7/91\n\nAverick of Glen Rowany. Device. Purpure, a chevron between two triskeles of armored legs and a lion dormant argent.\n\nConflict with Guiell/Gurell (Papworth, p. 397), Purpure, a chevron between three eagles displayed argent and with Archever (Papworth, p. 376), Purpure, a chevron enarched argent. In each case there is only a single CVD, for change or addition of the secondaries, respectively. 10/90\n\nAylwin Greymane. Device. Azure, two chevronells between in chief a compass star between two increscents and in base a compass star, all argent.\n\nConflict with Chawers (Papworth, p. 541), Azure, two chevrons argent. There is only one CVD, for the addition of the secondaries. 11/90\n\nAynia Morgainn of Morgannwg. Device. Gules, a pile sable, fimbriated, and semy of Jerusalem crosses, Or, overall a hummingbird rising, wings elevated and addorsed, argent.\n\nThe primary here is not drawn as a pile (which may be fimbriated), but as a chaussé field (which may not). A bigger problem is complexity: the semy of crosses of Jerusalem lose their identifiability on the \"pile\". The submitter might try simple \"crusilly\". Finally, the hummingbird is somewhat in trian aspect. While this alone might not have been grounds for return, she might as well correct it when she resubmits. 10/90\n\nAziza al-Ghazaala. Name.\n\nReturned for a lack of submission form. (Sorry, this was not caught when the Laurel packet was processed. Mea culpa.) 11/91\n\nÆlfgar the Irrepressible. Device. Barry and per pale gules and checky sable and argent.\n\nConflict with Payto (Papworth, p. 52), Barry of six argent and gules, per pale counterchanged. There is one CD only for the change from argent to checky sable and argent. 02/92\n\nÆlfreda æt Æthelwealda. Device. Vert, a fret and on a chief enarched Or three mascles vert.\n\nConflict with Robinson, (Papworth P 87) Vert, fretty Or, on a chief of the second three escallops ermine. There is a CD for the changes to the tertiaries, but by prior Laurel precedent nothing for the change between a fret and fretty, nor for enarching the chief. Please see the Miscellany section of the Cover Letter attached to this LoAR for Master Baldwin of Erebor's statement regarding using Papworth (or more properly, Papworth's blazons) as evidence that period heralds did, or did not, consider a fret different from fretty. 01/92\n\nÆthelmearc, Consort to the Heir of. Device. Gules, an escarbuncle argent, in chief three roses Or.\n\nThis was pended from the April Laurel meeting. As stated then by Mistress Alisoun, \"as status of the heirs is not recognized by Corpora, we do not feel it appropriate to register arms for the 'office'.\"8/90\n\nÆthelmearc, Heir to Coronet of. Device. Gules, an escarbuncle argent, in chief a label Or.\n\nThis was pended from the April Laurel meeting. As stated then by Mistress Alisoun, \"as status of the heirs is not recognized by Corpora, we do not feel it appropriate to register arms for the 'office'.\"8/90\n\nÆthelmearc, Principality of. Transfer of heraldic title of Sycamore Herald.\n\nHeraldic titles are registered to kingdoms (Administrative Rules, I.C.3). The East Kingdom may certainly designate this title to the use of the Æthelmearc Principality herald, however.\n\nEast, Kingdom of the. Name for Order of the Silver Blade.\n\nConflict with the Brotherhood of the Blade, registered to Sir Hugh the Undecided. Addition of the adjective is insufficient. 10/90\n\nBaldred Elphinstone of Torwood. Device. Argent, on a fess azure between three hunting horns sable stringed and banded gules a palm tree couped argent.\n\nConflict with Rodway (Papworth, p. 828), Argent, on a fess azure between three bugle horns sable, as many roses Or. There is one CD only for the change to the tiertiary(ies). 11/91\n\nBartek Ruhiger. Device. Azure, an oak tree eradicated and on a chief argent three estoiles azure all within a bordure argent.\n\nIn spite of the registration of a bordure and chief in the same tincture some time back noted in the LoI, a similar combination was disallowed in the LoAR for the January 1991 Laurel meeting. It was noted there that a chief should not be used with a bordure of the same tincture as it will give the visual effect of a bordure with a fat top. Nor does period armory give much precedent for such a combination, as the vast majority of exemplars there go out of their way to demarcate the two charges by tincture, line of division, or both. As has often been noted, we follow the general practices, not the exceptions. 10/91\n\nBartholomew Kidwelly. Device. Per bend sinister sable and gules, a falcon striking, wings elevated and addorsed, maintaing a sword fesswise argent, a chief embattled Or.\n\nConflict with Teamhair nic Uilliam, Per bend sinister sable and gules, a gerfalcon striking, wings elevated and addorsed, argent, maintaining in its talons a fireball all within a border engrailed Or. There is a CD for changing the type of peripheral charge, but nothing for the posture of the primary or the maintained charges. 11/91\n\nBasil Rattenbury. Device. Per chevron argent and vert, two trees eradicated proper, fructed gules and a mouse rampant to sinister argent.\n\nConflict with Philip of Ghent, Per chevron argent and vert, two fir trees eradicated and a hawk stooping counterchanged. There is only one CVD, for the change to type of the primary charges. X.2 (Sufficient Difference) cannot apply between two types of trees. 06/91\n\nBébinn an Ghleanna. Device. Argent, on a bend vert between a cross crosslet fitchy and a cat sejant erect guardant sable, three trefoils palewise argent.\n\nConflict with May (Papworth, p. 277), Argent, on a bend vert between two bucks heads cabossed sable, three roses of the first, and with Lloyd (Combined Ordinary, p. 78), Argent, on a bend vert three wolves heads erased argent. In each case there is only one CVD for the change to type of the secondaries. If the client would make the secondaries on this proposal identical (two crosses or two cats), we could apply X.4.j.2. and grant the second CVD for change to type of the tertiaries against both these arms. 9/91\n\nBedwyr ap Gwrgant Amaethon ap Rhain. Badge. [Fieldless] A scythe argent surmounted by a savage's head couped proper distilling gouttes de sang.\n\nThe effect of the combination of scythe, severed head, and blood issuing from the neck are simply too much. 11/90\n\nBei Ga An. Name.\n\nNo documentation was submitted confirming either the structure of the two character given name or that Ga could be so used. No commenters were able to find Ga as a name element. 11/91\n\nBenedetta de Spenser. Name change from Benedetta Despencer.\n\nThe registration of Robert de Spencer of Wessex noted in the LoI appears to have been in error, but was based on commentary received at the time only, as no one included photocopies of the documentation. The documentation as cited by a number of commenters (no photocopies this time either) does not support the requested spelling change. 05/92\n\nBerengaria of the Hounds. Badge. [Fieldless] On a cross flory gules a fleur-de-lys Or.\n\nConflict with Walcote (Papworth, p. 65), Argent, on a cross patonce gules five fleurs-de-lys Or. There is one CD for fieldless versus fielded, but nothing for the difference between a cross flory and a cross patonce, nor anything for the change to number only of the tertiary charge(s). 11/91\n\nBerenger Nachtwulf von Mainz der Spieler. Device. Vairy en point argent and sable, on a bend sinister wavy azure between two chess rooks, a stag's attire Or.\n\nThe complex line of division of the primary is nearly impossible to identify on the multi-tinctured field. Would the submitter consider using a straight line of division on the bend sinister? 04/91\n\nBerengière Fortescue. Device. Argent, a hawk displayed purpure and on a chief sable three roses argent.\n\nConflict with Hill (Papworth, p. 309), Argent, an eagle displayed double-headed sable, on a chief of the second, three roses as the first. There is a CVD only for the tincture of the primary. 7/91\n\nBertrand Lamont. Device. Sable, a cross dovetailed gyronny vert and argent.\n\nConflict with Stone (Papworth, p. 621) Sable, a cross raguly Or. There is a CVD for the tincture of the cross, but nothing for the difference between raguly and dovetailed. 08/91\n\nBianca Soderini di Firenze. Device. Argent, three piles in point vert and overall a phoenix facing sinister gules rising from a base of flames proper.\n\nConflict with Bryan (Papworth, p. 1027), Argent, three piles vert. Addition of the overall charge is only one CVD (per X.4.c). 04/91\n\nBjarni Kenhelm. Device. Argent, two eagles' wings conjoined and displayed gules, each terminating in a hand, maintaining in chief two axes crossed in saltire, heads to chief, sable hafted proper.\n\nConflict with Fitz-Payne (Papworth, p. 1122), Argent, two wings conjoined gules, with a CVD for the addition of the very large \"maintained\" charges. 02/91\n\nBjolfr Standali Vilmundarson. Badge. Per pale vert and purpure, three keys in pall wards outward and widershins Or.\n\nConflict with Beheim (Siebmacher, plate 66) Gules, three keys in pall wards outward handles linked by a triangle voided all Or. There is a CD for the field, but the triangle linking the three keys is the equivalent of a maintained charge and thus insufficient for a second Difference. 11/91\n\nBjorn Holvarsson. Name.\n\nNo submissions forms were included in the Laurel packet for this submission. 04/91\n\nBjörn Ráthvaldsson. Name and device. Pily bendy argent and azure, a tree couped proper and a bordure vert.\n\nThough the name was submitted on the LoI as above (well, with an edh instead of a \"th\"), the submitter's forms quite clearly have \"Bjorn Ragnvaldson\" (without the umlaut in Bjorn). Given that the submitter would not allow corrections to grammar or spelling (though he would to translation), we feel compelled to return this so that the confusion regarding the submitted name can be straightened out \"in kingdom\". The device conflicts with Barony of Forgotten Sea, Argent, ermined, a poplar tree, its roots nowed in the form of a Ukranian trident head inverted, all within a border vert. There is one CVD for the field but nothing for the type of tree, frou-frou around the roots, or the brown trunk (less than half of the charge). 10/91\n\nBlaan Wilhelm von Bamburg. Device. Argent a tree proper and on a chief sable a demi-sun Or.\n\nConflict with O'Murchoe (Papworth, p. 1114), Argent, a thorn tree fructed proper, on a chief gules a lion passant guardant Or. There is a CVD for the tincture of the chief, but nothing for the change to type only of the tertiary. 11/90\n\nBlackmoore, Shire of. Name.\n\nConflict with Blackmoore, name of the second supplement published by TSR games to the original Dungeons and Dragons. The Administrative Handbook Protected Items F notes that locations which play a significant role in the action of the modern literary work (of any genre) in which they appear will be protected. As a consequence, in spite of the five English Blackmoors, we are having to return this for conflict with the TSR entity. 9/91\n\nBlackstone Mountain, Barony of. Name.\n\nConflict with Mountain Confederation. By prior Laurel precedent, addition of the adjective Blackstone is insufficient to clear the conflict. 12/91\n\nBorimir Dimitrian. Device. Per pale gules and vert, a horse passant within a bordure argent.\n\nConflict with Moyle (Papworth, p. 115), Gules, a mule statant within a bordure argent. There is one CD for the change to the field. Conflict also with Hirano, et al. (Hawley's Mon, p. 57), (Dark), a horse statant (light). There is a CD for the addition of the bordure. 12/91\n\nBorkr Hálftroll Thorbjarnarson. Device. Sable, a bear Or and a ram argent combattant.\n\nConflict with Berton (Papworth, p. 61), Sable, a goat rampant argent. There is one CD for the addition of the bear. 02/92\n\nBran Gwyn ap Caw ap Maelgwn. Device. Azure, a raven and a trimount argent.\n\nConflict with Michelgrove (Papworth, p. 304), Azure, a goshawk argent. There is one CVD for the addition of the trimount, but we could not see a second for the difference between a raven and a goshawk in an identical posture. Regarding the statement made in the return of the Shire of An Dubhaigeainn, November 1990, it would have been clearer (and more accurate) had I said that there is no difference between two types of birds of similar shape or silhouette in identical postures. Thus this submission does not conflict with Longford (Papworth, p. 296), Azure, a sheldrake argent, with CVDs for type of primary and addition of the secondary. (Even Laurel on one of his bad days can tell the difference between a raven and a duck!). 01/91\n\nBrand the Black. Name For The Black Company.\n\nConflict with the Black Company, the name of a mercenary company in a continuing series by Glen Cook, the first book of which has that as a title. The applicable rule regarding protecting this is in the Administrative Handbook, Protected Items D, \"Names ... of Major Characters from Literary Works\". The subtext to this rule makes it clear that the Black Company falls into this category. This is an exact conflict. 4/92\n\nBrandric Rockslayer. Name.\n\nRockslayer is not a reasonable epithet, nor is \"rock\" a reasonable alternate spelling of \"rook.\" 06/91\n\nBranwen of Barnhamwood. Name and device. Argent, on a chevron between two crosses crosslet sable and an oak tree eradicated proper a raven argent.\n\nConflict with Temple (Papworth, p. 481), Argent, on a chevron sable five birds of the first beaked and legged gules; Frewod (Papworth, p. 482), Argent, on a chevron sable an escallop of the first; Alfray (Papworth, p. 483), Argent, on a chevron sable a fleur-de-lys of the first; Trewlove (Papworth, p. 485), Argent, on a chevron sable a quatrefoil of the first; and others. In each case there is a CD for the addition of the secondaries, but nothing for changing the number or type only of the tertiary. (X.4.j.ii does not apply here because of the dissimilar secondaries.) 3/92\n\nBrénainn ó Murchadha de Ros Comáin. Badge for The Brothers Martial of the Cross Damasson. [Fieldless] Four swords conjoined in cross, those in pale at the points and those in fess at the hilts, proper between four crosses saltirewise couped argent.\n\nThis fieldless badge consists of disparate charges without even a unifying visual theme, in violation of RfS VIII.5, Fieldless Style (\"Fieldless armory must form a self-contained design\"). 01/91\n\nBrendan de la Rue. Device. Argent, crusily vert, on a torteau a unicorn rampant guardant argent.\n\nThe unicorn is unidentifiable as such in a guardant posture, as its most unique identifying feature, the horn, is entirely lost against the head. We recommend using a normal rampant, and using fewer and larger crosses for the semy on the field; more like on the miniemblazon in the LoI rather than those on the large emblazon form. 01/91\n\nBrian du Bois Breton. Badge. [Fieldless] A stag's head erased contourny Or.\n\nConflict with the British 91st AGRA (MilOrd #759), Vert, a stag's head in trian aspect to sinister Or. There is one CVD for fieldlessness, but nothing for the change to erased contourny from trian aspect to sinister, which is, after all, only a slight turn of the head. 12/90\n\nBrianna Arielle Durand. Device. Per fess azure and argent, a compass star elongated to base argent and two piles inverted in point azure.\n\nVisual conflict with Regin Bran Haraldssonn (SCA), Azure, three piles inverted conjoined in point and in chief three mullets of four points one and two, argent. While there is sufficient technical difference, the visual similarities of the two devices is extremely strong, with the greatest visual difference being only the number of mullets in chief. 02/91\n\nBrianna Ashirvagh. Device. Sable, on a mullet of eight points throughout argent, eclipsed sable, a fox's mask argent.\n\nThough blazoned as \"pierced\", the primary was drawn as eclipsed, a much more significant change. As such, this is four layers, in violation of RfS VIII.1.c.2. It also conflicts with Rathnarr Blaiddgwyn (SCA), Sable, a wolf's head caboshed within a sun eclipsed argent. There is at very best one CD for change of type of primary, and it is questionable whether we should even allow that much for the difference between a mullet of eight points and a sun. 4/92\n\nBrianna ni Connachaidh. Badge. [Fieldless] On a gurges azure, a celtic cross Or.\n\nFieldless badges cannot use charges which issue or are defined by the edge of the field. The gurges is such a charge, and therefore may not be used on a fieldless badge. 4/92\n\nBríd uí Chon na Mara. Device. Azure, on a bend bretessed between two open penannular brooches bendwise sinister Or, a bendlet vert.\n\nConflict with city of Armaugh, Urban District Council (Public Heraldry), Azure, on a bend embattled between in chief a primatal cross and in base a harp Or, a bendlet gules. There is only one CVD for the change to type of secondaries. 9/91\n\nBrighed O'Dáire. Device. Vert, a Celtic triquetrum brooch and a chief triangular argent.\n\nThe Celtic triquetrum brooch has been deemed unacceptable for registration in the SCA (see the LoAR of June 1991, p. 17). 4/92\n\nBrighid O'Mainnin. Device. Or, a ferret's head couped affronty proper within an orle of blackberry vine vert, fructed purpure. (Mustela furo)\n\nThere were two problems here: one is the identifiability of the \"ferret's\" head as distinct from any other kind of beast's head in this position. The other is that ferrets appear to have no single defined \"proper\" tincture, but can vary according to the season, etc. 02/91\n\nBrikti macMór. Name change from Astrid Ragnarsdottir av Arvika.\n\nThe grammar of the name is incorrect: Brikti is the genitive form and it needs to be the nominitive here. This would appear to be Brigid, or perhaps (in Manx) Bridey or Breeshey. The surname is probably acceptable, as MacMore is noted in MacLysaght. However, it would be more likely as nic Mhór. 10/91\n\nBrion Gennadyevich Gorodin. Badge. [Fieldless] A mascle, overall an ermine spot argent.\n\nWhile the style of ermine spot is not a problem here, when two charges of the same tincture overlap to this degree, their identifiability is reduced to an unacceptable degree. 02/92\n\nBronwyn of Kidwelly. Device. Azure, a tree eradicated, its roots surrounding a heart, all within a bordure embattled argent.\n\nConflict, both technical and visual, with Christopher de Lockewood (SCA), Azure, an oak tree eradicated within a fetterlock, all within a bordure dovetailed argent. There is a CVD for removing the fetterlock (a secondary charge on Christopher's device), but nothing for the addition of the heart (which gets lost in the roots). As noted by Mistress Alisoun on a similar design, a heart encircled by tree roots is extremely poor style. (LoAR of May 1989). 01/91\n\nBronzehelm, Shire of. Device. Azure, a helm Or, a chief indented and overall a laurel wreath counterchanged.\n\nCharges should not surmount a chief. This has been a policy held since the tenure of Wilhelm von Schlüssel. 01/92\n\nBrownwen D'Arcy of Stratafon. Device. Azure, a dove volant to sinister, wings addorsed, argent and issuant from base a demi-sun Or.\n\nThough technically clear, there is visual conflict with Nyilas Kázmér (SCA), Azure, a goose volant, wings elevated and addorsed, argent, issuant from base a demi-sun Or. A dove flying to sinister simply looks too much like a goose flying to dexter without close inspection. 02/91\n\nBrynhildr Kormaksdottir. Augmentation of device. Or, a Norse serpent nowed gules, as an augmentation, gorged of a ring Or.\n\nHaving checked the files, it is very clear that Brynhildr's registered device, as listed in the Armorial and Ordinary, is correct; that is, Gules, a Norse serpent nowed Or. Thus, this augmentation has no contrast at all with the charge upon which it is placed making it effectively invisible. 7/91\n\nBrynna nic Adam. Name.\n\nThe evidence for Brynna is extremely weak. No evidence was adduced that this follows standard naming practices. If the Camden citation for Brynnae or if a Latin form Brynnus can be found, then this name should be acceptable. Until such time, however, we are forced to return it. 12/91\n\nBurke Kyriell MacDonald. Change of badge. [Fieldless] A sun or eclipsed of the field and overall a compass star elongated in pale argent.\n\nIt is not possible to eclipse something \"of the field\" on a fieldless badge. 02/91\n\nCadfael the Mordacious. Name.\n\nWe did not receive the form for this name submission in the Laurel packet. (Lords Gold Falcon and Saker, I apologize for not having contacted you about this. I missed the flag from my Administrative Assistant. Not catching it and informing you is my fault, and I am sorry.) The meaning for Mordacious in the OED is dated to 1650 which is at the outer limits of our \"grey area\". Could you interest the submitter in the documentably Period term \"Mordant\"? 08/91\n\nCadi ferch Bradwen. Device. Chevronelly of four gules and azure a pegasus rampant to sinister Or.\n\nThis field division in two colors is not allowed by the Rules for Submissions VIII.2.b.iii. Additionally, there is a conflict with the U.S. 103rd Observation Squadron (Military Ordinary #950), Azure, a pegasus rising to sinister in adumbration Or. There is only one CVD, for the change to the field. 11/90\n\nCaelinn nic Lochlainn. Name change from Caroline ó Cainnigh.\n\nConflict with the already registered Caitilin ni Lochlainn. 04/91\n\nCaer Daibhidh, College of. Name appeal of Laurel return and device. Argent, on a pale azure, a plate indented within a laurel wreath overall counterchanged.\n\nPer V.4, the name does not conflict with the College of Saint David. However, the name still has the problem of mixing two languages into a single phrase, and their documentation does not really support the combination here. Were the name involved here of Gaelic origin, then their arguments might be stronger; however, David is a borrowed name, which appeared in different forms in the two languages used in the name submitted. That \"David\" would have been preserved in a form such as this is not supported by the evidence. The device conflicts with a badge for the Kingdom of Caid, Argent, on a pale azure a crescent argent. The roundel needs to be drawn with fewer, and much bolder, \"indents\". 7/90\n\nCaerthe, Barony of. Badge for Order of Sable Lion of Caerthe. Sable, on a sun Or, a lion's jambe erased bendwise sable.\n\nConflicts with Dernley (Papworth, p. 1100), Sable, a sun in splendour Or, and with Rale (Papworth, p. 1100), Sable, the sun Or, with only one CVD for the addition of the tertiary. Conflicts with Jean-Louis de la Bête (SCA), Sable, on a sun Or a lion rampant reguardant sable, all within a ressure demi-flory Or, and with Eleric Sonn Hvittann (SCA), Sable, on a sun Or an anvil sable, within a bordure Or, with a CVD for deleting the secondary, but nothing for change of type only of tertiary. 8/90\n\nCaid, Kingdom of. Title for Merlon Herald.\n\nAural conflict with the Merlyne Pursuivant (England). 11/90\n\nCailean macCullough. Name and device. Pily bendy sinister argent and sable, a two-handed sword gules.\n\nThe name conflicts aurally with the already-registered Colleen MacCollough. The device conflicts with Dymock (Papworth), Argent, in pale a sword gules, with but a single CVD for the changes to the field. 01/91\n\nCairenn of CúáRuadh Keep. Name.\n\nCairenn as spelled here appears to be a unique name, that of the mother of Niall of the Nine Hostages. CuáRuadh Keep does not appear to follow the pattern of using an anglicized Irish name in an English style place name (such would much more likely be something akin to Conroe Keep). 08/91\n\nCaitlin de Fernon. Device. Per pale argent and azure, a tree blasted and eradicated counterchanged.\n\nConflict with Daniel of Glenmore, Per pale argent and azure, a pine tree counterchanged. While there is clearly a CD for the difference between types of trees, X.2 does not apply between trees. That X.2 should not apply between blasted and regular trees should be even more apparent given that in period many trees were drawn with empty branches each terminating in a single oversized leaf, rather than the \"cotton candy\" form of leafy foliage we see more commonly today. 11/91\n\nCaitlin of Argyle. Name for the Fellowship of the Horse.\n\nConflict with Master of the Horse, registered to the Barony of Bhakail (only the \"invisible\" designator is changed), as well as Sea Horse Pursuivant (with only the removal of the adjective). 04/91\n\nCaitlin Ravenlock. Device. Sable, a pale and a chief argent, a griffin passant overall Or.\n\n\"Surmounting a chief is not period heraldry and may not be heraldic even today. No charge should surmount a chief, wholly or partially, in SCA heraldry.\" (Wilhelm von Schlüssel, LoAR of 22 March 1983, p. 13). 01/91\n\nCaitlín Caimbeul. Name.\n\nConflict with the already registered Catherine Campbell. These two are effectively the same name; one is Anglicized. Kathleen, a more direct Anglicization, is considered a diminutive of Catherine, and we do not count difference for diminutives from their longer forms. 01/92\n\nCaitrin ni Ruaidhri. Badge. Vert, on a flame argent, a thistle purpure.\n\nConflict with Michael Bjornson, Vert, a viking longship sable upon flames of fire argent. There is only one CVD, for changing the type and tincture of the charge on the flames. 7/90\n\nCala of Savatthi. Device. Gules, in pale a butterfly and a lotus flower in profile argent.\n\nThe \"lotus flower\", documented in the LoI from Chinese pottery, is not reproducible from the blazon. Those submitting heraldry should be reminded that period art styles are not necessarily registerable period heraldic styles. If the client would consider resubmitting with a standard heraldic lotus in profile, none of the commenters mentioned any conflicts. 6/92\n\nCaoimhe Fionnarun ni Roibaird bean Mhichil mac Aoidh. Name.\n\nThe name has some minor grammatical problems and no one was able to document a pattern which would allow the construction of the name Fionnarun. Since the submitter allowed no changes whatsoever to the name, we were unable to drop the problematic element or to make the minor grammatical corrections. If the submitter would consider the suggestions made by the commenting heralds, a corrected construction would appear to be Caoimhe ní Roibaird bean Mhichíl mhic Aoidh. 4/92\n\nCaoimteach Fuolchu dhe Buitseach. Name for Household Weordful Beag.\n\nThe submitter's name does not appear to be registered, and therefore we cannot register the household name. Additionally, the household name itself does not appear to be formed in a grammatically correct manner for Anglo-Saxon nor to make grammatical sense as a name (\"House Worthy Ring\"). 3/92\n\nCara Michelle DuValier. Device. Sable, four fleurs-de-lys in cross, bases to center, and a bordure Or.\n\nConflict with Lascelles (Papworth, p. 636), Sable, a cross flory within a bordure Or. Because of the arrangement of the primaries, we cannot apply X.2 to grant sufficient difference between this arrangement of four fleurs-de-lys and the cross flory. 9/91\n\nCarmenette Rosiá Diez de Rodriguéz.\n\nThere were a number of issues regarding the name which we could not settle at the Laurel meeting. No evidence was presented to demonstrate that Carmenette is a Portugese name (the client's forms claim that the name is Portuguese, not Spanish). The LoI added two accents which the client's forms do not have and deleted one which they do. No evidence was given for the construction of the byname (indeed the only documentation presented were the client's statements regarding the name. No photocopies of any kind were included in the Laurel packet). We are returning this for rework and/or additional documentation by the client for the individual elements and the overall construction of the name. 12/91\n\nCaroline Forbes of Oxfordshire. Badge. [Fieldless] A boar's head erased purpure.\n\nConflict with the badge of Hugh de Vere, Earl of Oxford, A boar's head, found in Fox-Davies' Book of Badges, p. 132. Conflict also the Zimbabwian 5th Brigade (Special Forces), [Fieldless] A boars head erased. This last is used in all of the standard heraldic tinctures and some of the stains. 4/92\n\nCarolingia, Barony of. Designation for the Borough of Huntington Greene.\n\nWe have strong doubts about the propriety of the College registering an unofficial designation like \"borough\" to an SCA group, past registration notwithstanding. If it's a household, let's call it a household and register it to the head of the household. If it's a geographic group like a canton or shire, let's register it as a canton or shire. 01/91\n\nCarolus Mediocris. Name and device. Azure, a martlet volant bendwise argent and in chief three mullets of four points Or.\n\nThis is a joke name much on the order of Decrease Mather, Ivan the Not-So-Terrible, and Richard the Chicken-hearted, all of which have been returned for being joke names far too allusive to the historical Increase Mather, Ivan the Terrible, and Richard the Lionhearted, respectively. By the same token, this is far to allusive to Carolus Magnus (Charlemagne). The device conflicts with Lang (Papworth, p. 307), Azure, a dove rising holding in its beak an olive branch proper, in chief a mullet between two crosses formy Or. There is one CD for the change to type of the secondaries, but nothing for the slight change in position of the primary. The primary identifying feature of a martlet, its lack of feet, is here hidden by the position of the wing. 11/91\n\nCassandra la Sable. Badge. Argent, semy of snowflakes sable, a hawk striking to sinister proper.\n\nConflict with Malcolm mac Ruairidh of Blackoak, Argent, a raven striking to sinister gules. There is one CD for the semy. In this position the only difference between a hawk and a raven is the nearly invisible curve of the bill. 11/91\n\nCassandra Louise Marchand. Device. Ermine, a swan volant sable within an orle of violets slipped and leaved proper.\n\nThis was returned before in part because the orle of flowers was too similar to the restricted wreath of roses. This issue has not been addressed in the resubmission, and so this must be returned once again for this reason. It was suggested that if the submitter would clearly separate the individual flowers in orle, that this would probably remove the problem. 9/90\n\nCassandra Löwenstahl. Name and badge. [Fieldless] A mullet inverted gules, surmounted by on a mullet Or, a lion's head erased sable.\n\nLöwenstein and Löwenthal do not appear to be sufficient precedent for allowing Löwenstahl. \"Lion-rock\" and \"Lion-valley\" are clearly toponymics; \"Lion-steel\" is not. The badge has too many layers. The Rules for Submission do not allow quaternary charges, which the lion's head here is. 12/91\n\nCassandra Northcliffe. Device. Or, a bimount and on a chief vert three lamps Or.\n\nConflict with Reynolds (Papworth, p. 566), Or, on a chief vert three lions rampant of the first and with Crompton (Papworth, p. 587), Or, on a chief vert three pheons of the first, as cited in the LoI. The bimount, as a peripheral charge, is not a \"primary charge\" as defined in the Glossary of Terms, and thus X.1 and X.2 cannot be invoked. 9/90\n\nCassandra of Kendal. Badge. [Fieldless] On a trefoil slipped vert three hearts points to center argent.\n\nThe radial arrangement of the tertiary charges is not period style, and their placement makes this effectively \"a shamrock vert, voided argent\", which is not permissible because it becomes effectively \"thin-line\" heraldry. 02/92\n\nCassandra of Kendal. Device. Sable, a bow and arrow drawn and sinister facing and on a chief argent three trefoils vert.\n\nConflict with Ragnar Thorbergsson, Sable a drawn bow fesswise arrow knocked and on a chief argent, three trees eradicated proper, as cited in the LoI. There is one CD for the orientation of the primary charge but the change to type only of the tertiaries is not great enough to apply X.4.j.ii., and comparing the two emblazons graphically demonstrated the overwhelming visual similiarity between these two devices. 05/92\n\nCassandra Villiers. Device. Potenty gules and argent, a base purpure, overall a fireball and a bordure Or.\n\nJust as one should not have a charge overlying a chief or flaunches, a charge overlying a base is not registrable. If the client would consider placing the primary charge entirely on the field, there does not appear to be any other bar to registration. 05/92\n\nCastell Daibhidh, College of. Name and device. Argent, on a pale gules a roundel indented, overall a laurel wreath counterchanged.\n\nThe name mixes languages in a single phrase, and no evidence was presented that it is possible to mix English and Scottish Gaelic in this way. The easiest and smallest fix would be Caisteal Dhaibhidh. The device conflicts with the Shire of Politarchopolis, Argent, on a pale gules a griffin segreant argent, overall a laurel wreath counterchanged. There is at best one CD for the change of type of the tertiary. 12/91\n\nCastillos del Oro, Los, Stronghold of. Device. Azure, chapé ployé barry wavy argent and azure, a chevron ployé, in base a castle, overall a laurel wreath, and a chief embattled all Or. 06/90\n\nThis is far too \"busy\" for the period style we are trying to emulate. Additionally, charges should not overlie chapé lines of division; this submission has two that do, the chevron and the laurel wreath. Would they consider something simpler, along the lines of \"Barry wavy argent and azure, a pale ...\"?. 06/90\n\nCaterina Angélique Coeur Noir. Device. Quarterly Or and gules, a heart sable, between in bend sinister a lion rampant and a horse rampant Or.\n\nThree different charges in a standard heraldic arangement is disallowed by XIII.1.a. 7/91\n\nCaterina de Chantal. Device. Purpure, a centaur rampant guardant maintaining a harp and on a chief argent, two recorders in saltire sable.\n\nNo emblazon form was submitted with this submission. My staff apologizes for not catching this early enough to correct the problem before the Laurel meeting. 10/91\n\nCatherine de Mares. Device. Quarterly azure and papelonny azure and argent, three annulets linked in pall inverted Or.\n\nConflict with Fushiki, et al. (Hawley's Mon, pg 85), Dark, three rings interlaced one and two light. There is one CD here for the field (quarterly vs. plain). Lord Laurel is confused by the misunderstanding some commenters seem to have regarding the difference between fieldless and tinctureless armory. Fieldless armory gets a CD for fieldlessness; tinctureless armory (SCA, not mundane) acquires one CD for fieldlessness -- the other CD must come from a class other than tincture (RfS X.4.d). Japanese mon, while tinctureless, are not fieldless; thus, they cannot be granted the fieldlessness difference. Addition or removal of charges, field and charge divisions (since mon appear only to have used solid fields and solid charges), complex lines, all contribute difference from mon. Fieldlessness does not, unless the SCA armory being considered against it is fieldless, in which case the SCA armory, not the mon, gets a CD for fieldlessness. 01/92\n\nCatherine of Wessex. Device. Vert, a unicornate pegasus rampant and on a chief Or two mullets vert.\n\nConflict with Quinn (Papworth, p. 985), Vert, a pegasus volant and a chief Or, there is one CVD for he addition of the tertiaries. There was some discussion as to whether or not we should continue the long standing ban against unicorn horse hybrids. While the conflict sighted above makes this issue moot, Lord Laurel is interested in everyone's opinion. Should we allow unicornate pegasi in SCA heraldry? 08/91\n\nCatherine the Merry. Device. Azure, on a bend sinister wavy bretessy between a domestic cat sejant guardant and a fools cap Or, three hens palewise azure.\n\nSubmitted on the LoI as \"wavy bretessy\", a better blazon would be \"wavy counter-wavy\". However, neither really describes this non-Period treatment of a bend nor has such a treatment been previously found to be compatible with Period practice (see RfS VII.2 and VII.6). 12/91\n\nCathleen of Greystones. Device. Vert chapé embattled, a pine tree eradicated argent.\n\nConflict with Hastur (Fabulous Heraldry, pg. 42), Azure, a fir argent. There is one CD for the changes to the field. Additionally, there is some question among the commenters as to whether we should allow any complex lines besides ploye on a chapé field. 02/92\n\nCatriona á as Gaoth. Name.\n\nThe byname is both grammatically incorrect and nonsensical. \"Catriona the out of the wind\" does not make sense in any language we could think of. 6/92\n\nCatriona Mairghread nic Dhuibh of Moray. Badge. [Fieldless] A closed pair of scissors palewise argent issuant from flames in base proper.\n\nWithdrawn by the client. 12/91\n\nCatriona Mairghread nic Dhuibh of Moray Badge. [Fieldless] On a flame Or, outlined gules, a closed pair of scissors inverted argent.\n\nThe scissors here are metal on metal. As the flames are primarily Or with only outlining of the points of flame in gules, the contrast of the scissors against the flames is insufficient for identifiability. 02/92\n\nCatriona O'Ceirin. Device. Argent, a domestic cat dormant guardant sable and in chief three shamrocks vert.\n\nVisual conflict with Robin Freawine (SCA), Argent, a natural leopard dormant sable and in chief an ivy vine wavy fesswise throughout vert. The visual similarity of these two devices, with the black \"meatloaf\" cats in nearly identical positions (right down to the tail!) with \"green leaves\" in chief, was overwhelming. 12/90\n\nCedric Raedwulfing Fithelere. Badge. [Fieldless] A quaver azure.\n\nIn keeping with prior Laurel rulings on this issue, just as a badge may not consist solely of a single letter, neither may it consist solely of a single abstract symbol. 02/91\n\nCedrin Etainnighean. Badge. Gules, a sword palewise environed by a vol all within a bordure Or.\n\nConflict with Torrin the Wanderer, Per pale gules and azure, a sword palewise between two wings displayed all within a bordure Or. There is one CD for the change to the field only. 4/92\n\nCedrych Ladyman. Device. Gyronny argent and azure, a mullet within a bordure sable.\n\nConflict with Ansteorra, Or, a mullet of five greater and five lesser points within a bordure sable, as cited in the LoI. There is one CVD for the change to the field. The removal of the lesser points of the mullet, particularly given the fact of near unidentifiability of the mullet on the azure portions of the gyronny field, are not worth the necessary second CVD. 7/90\n\nCeidrych ap Gryffydd ap Cynan o'r Wyddfa. Name.\n\nThe name is a claim to descent from Gryffydd ap Cynan, king of Gwenedd of which y Wyddfa is the highest point. 10/90\n\nCeinwen of Land's End. Badge. Azure, a compass star and a bordure embattled argent.\n\nConflict with the Barony of Rivenstar (SCA), Azure, a rivenstar argent. There is one CVD for the addition of the bordure, but as was determined more than a year ago, there is no difference between a compass star and a rivenstar. 08/91\n\nCelyna Eolas Astaraiche. Name and device. Vert, three mullets in bend between an open book and a sheaf of arrows inverted, Or.\n\n\"Acquaintance trav"
