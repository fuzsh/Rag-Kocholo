As such, the Witzleben surname literally means \"wise body.\"\n\nThe Witzleben surname has a long and distinguished history which can be traced back to the Middle Ages when the family was first recorded as members of the German nobility. The family first rose to prominence in the eleventh century as part of the Hohenzollern dynasty which governed the region of Brandenburg-Prussia. During the course of their history, the Witzleben family achieved various titles of nobility such as Count, Baron and even Grand Marshall of the Holy Roman Empire under the Hohenzollerns.\n\nThe Witzleben surname is also remembered for the prominent and respected members of the family throughout history, such as Field Marshal August von Witzleben.
