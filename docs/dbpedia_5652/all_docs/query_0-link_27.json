        "text": "Mussolini (left), together with Hitler and a group of officers, inspect the consequences of the explosion at the Fuhrer's headquarters \"Wolfsschanze\" (Wolf's Lair), carried out during an attempt on the life of the leader of Nazi Germany.\n\n80 years ago, on July 20, 1944, the most famous assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler took place at the Fuhrer's Wolf's Lair headquarters in Rastenburg (East Prussia). The German military tried to kill the Fuhrer to save Germany from disaster.\n\nResistance movement\n\nThe assassination attempt on July 20, 1944 was not the first. There have already been more than 40 assassination attempts on Hitler. Often the Fuhrer survived by some miracle. Hitler's popularity among the German people was very high, but there were also plenty of enemies.\n\nThe Resistance movement arose in Germany immediately after the National Socialists came to power. The Resistance movement was not united and homogeneous; it included pacifists, liberals, conservatives, religious leaders, extreme nationalists (Black Front), communists, social democrats and the military.\n\nBut the greatest potential was possessed by the military, who were dissatisfied with the strengthening of the SS troops and believed that Germany was not ready for a big war on two fronts, that Hitler was leading the country to disaster.\n\nOn the part of the Fuhrer's left, they mainly tried to eliminate loners. In the 1930s, four serious attempts were made to eliminate the leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP).\n\nOn November 9, 1939, Hitler spoke on the occasion of the anniversary of the failed “Beer Hall Putsch” in the famous Munich beer hall in 1923. Former communist Georg Elser organized the assassination attempt. He prepared and detonated a bomb. Hitler was not injured, although the massive explosion killed several people and injured more than sixty others. Hitler, for some reason, completed his introduction ahead of time and left the building a few minutes before the bomb exploded.\n\nLudwig August Theodor Beck (1880 – July 20, 1944) – Colonel General of the German Army (1938). Chief of the General Staff of the Ground Forces in 1935–1938. Leader of the military action against Adolf Hitler on July 20, 1944. At about 23:15 on July 20, Beck asked the commander of the reserve army, General Friedrich Fromm (who participated in the suppression of the plot), to allow him to commit suicide. However, the suicide attempt was unsuccessful - Beck only wounded himself. In a semi-conscious state, he asked to be given another pistol, but the second attempt did not lead to death. Then Fromm ordered one of his subordinates to finish off the old general with a shot in the neck. Beck's body, like the four participants in the conspiracy shot on Fromm's orders, was buried in the cemetery of St. Matthias Church in Berlin. But already on July 21, Himmler ordered the bodies to be dug up, cremated and the remains scattered to the wind, which was done.\n\nMilitary opposition\n\nPart of the German military elite and diplomats believed that the Third Reich was not yet ready for war. Many of them were aristocrats and monarchists, did not approve of the ideology of National Socialism and were unhappy with the rise of the SS troops to the detriment of the Wehrmacht. A big war, in their opinion, was supposed to lead Germany to a military-political catastrophe.\n\nBack in 1938, a conspiracy arose against Hitler. The conspirators believed that the conflict over Czechoslovakia would lead to war with the great Western powers - France and England, as well as the Soviet Union. The weak German army, which has only just begun the process of transformation and rearmament, will be defeated. Germany will survive the disaster. Therefore, it was decided to remove Hitler after he gave the order to attack Czechoslovakia, form a provisional government and hold new democratic elections.\n\nAmong the conspirators was Colonel General Ludwig Beck, Chief of Staff of the Ground Forces. He believed that Hitler put Germany at unnecessary risk. In July, the 1938 general sent a memorandum to the commander-in-chief of the land forces, Colonel-General von Brauchitsch, where he invited the top military leadership of Germany to resign and prevent the outbreak of war: “The question of the existence of a nation is at stake. History will brand the leadership of the armed forces with blood guilt if they do not act in accordance with their professional and state-political qualities and conscience.”\n\nBut the rest of the German generals did not have such willpower, and many were carried away by the idea of ​​revenge, so they did not support Beck. The general resigned and gradually became the head of the military opposition.\n\nThe new chief of staff, Franz Halder, also shared Beck’s views, and the commander of the 1st Army (defended the German-French border during the Sudetenland crisis), General Erwin von Witzleben, was ready for action. The active group of conspirators included one of the senior officers of the Abwehr, Lieutenant Colonel Hans Oster, he was supported by the head of the Abwehr Wilhelm Franz Canaris, generals Erich Hoepner and Walter von Brockdorff-Alefeld, Prussian Minister of Finance Johannes Popitz, banker Hjalmar Schacht, former burgomaster of Leipzig Karl Goerdeler and diplomat Ulrich von Hassell. The commander-in-chief of the ground forces, Walter von Brauchitsch, also knew about the plot. He refused to participate in it, but also did not inform on the conspirators.\n\nHans Paul Oster (1887 - April 9, 1945) - German military leader, major general (1942). Known as the initiator of the plot to overthrow Hitler (1938) and a participant in the anti-Nazi Resistance. The day after the unsuccessful assassination attempt on Hitler on July 20, 1944, Oster was arrested. On April 8, 1945, as a result of a speedy trial, he was sentenced to death in the Flossenburg concentration camp along with Admiral Canaris and Pastor Bonhoeffer. The next day they were hanged, and before death, the convicts were stripped naked and forced to go to the gallows in this form.\n\nThe question of the existence of a nation\n\nThe conspirators tried to establish contacts with the British, planning to act when a military-political crisis broke out and when the great powers stood up against Hitler's policies. However, England and France simply surrendered Czechoslovakia at the Munich Conference. Czechoslovakia, under pressure from the great powers, gave the Sudetenland to Germany without resistance.\n\nAs a result, Germany was filled with jubilation, and the action of the military conspirators became meaningless. A significant part of the conspirators became disillusioned with the possibility of overthrowing the Hitler regime. Thus, Witzleben stated: “... for this unfortunate stupid people, he is again “our beloved Fuhrer,” the only one sent by God, and we... we are just a pathetic bunch of reactionaries and disgruntled officers and politicians who dared at the moment of the highest triumph of the greatest politician of all time throw stones in his path.\"\n\nThe next time the conspirators became more active was in 1939, when Hitler decided to attack Poland. The motive was the same. The military believed that Germany was not ready for war, and an attack from France and England from the western direction would lead to a military disaster. Halder, Schacht and other conspirators warned the British and French governments and intelligence services through several channels about the impending German attack on Poland.\n\nIn essence, the conspirators committed an act of betrayal by telling a potential enemy about Hitler’s decision and the expected timing of the attack. Moreover, they also proposed retaliatory measures that would deter German aggression. In particular, it was planned to send a squadron to the Baltic Sea to support Poland from the sea, transfer British troops to France and introduce Winston Churchill into the British cabinet of Chamberlain, who was ready to actively resist German aggression.\n\nLondon and Paris did not take advantage of this opportunity. The West at that time believed that after Poland, Hitler would strike the Soviet Union. That's why Poland was given to Hitler. The “Phantom War” began when the armies of England and France stood idle while the Wehrmacht crushed Poland. The plans of the conspirators were not realized.\n\nWilhelm Franz Canaris (1887–1945) – German military leader, admiral, head of military intelligence and counterintelligence in Nazi Germany (1935–1944). Former Abwehr employees informed Canaris of the impending assassination attempt on the Fuhrer. After the assassination attempt failed, he was arrested. For a long time, the investigation failed to prove his involvement in the conspiracy. At the beginning of February 1945, together with other people under investigation, he was transferred to the Flossenbürg concentration camp. At the beginning of April, Canaris's diaries were discovered in Zossen, from which his involvement in the conspiracy against Hitler became known. Executed by the Nazis on April 9, 1945 for treason.\n\nWestern solution\n\nWhen, after the defeat of Poland, the Fuhrer gave the order to prepare for war with France, the conspirators became more active again. The head of the Abwehr, Canaris, and the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, First Chief Quartermaster, General Karl Heinrich von Stülpnagel, attempted to persuade Halder and Brauchitsch to lead the coup d'état. But, Halder and Brauchitsch showed hesitancy.\n\nOster conveyed information to the Dutch military attache in Germany about the upcoming attack of the Third Reich on Belgium and the Netherlands. The same information was passed on to the Belgian ambassador in Rome and the Belgian king. Austen also contacted Great Britain and France through Rome. There were even secret negotiations held in Rome on a draft peace treaty between Germany and Great Britain after the removal of Hitler. This draft \"Memorandum X\" was drawn up in the Vatican and delivered to Berlin.\n\nAll these plans were not implemented due to the indecisiveness of high-ranking conspirators and the passivity of England and France, who did not take full advantage of the secret information provided.\n\nSubsequently, figures of the German Resistance betrayed Germany's secrets and invited the Western powers to enter into negotiations. Thus, the main informant of Allen Dulles, who was the special representative of American President Roosevelt and headed the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) station in Switzerland, was the vice-consul of the German Consulate General in Zurich, Hans Gisevius.\n\nAbwehr agent Gisevius was an active conspirator and the eyes and hands of Admiral Canaris in Switzerland. Among Dulles's German informants was another participant in the conspiracy, adviser to the German Foreign Ministry Adam von Trott zu Soltz. Dulles viewed negotiations with the German opposition as a means of establishing a regime beneficial to the United States in post-war Germany.\n\nThe Germans actively tried to negotiate an agreement with the Western powers. Karl Friedrich Goerdeler, one of the key civilian figures in the German opposition (he was considered as a future chancellor), focused on Great Britain and the United States. Goerdeler, like Beck, pushed for a “Western solution” - an alliance with England and America against Russia. Goerdeler especially persistently tried to conclude an alliance with London.\n\nThe head of military intelligence and counterintelligence in Nazi Germany (1935–1944), Wilhelm Canaris, negotiated with British intelligence MI1943 and the US Office of Strategic Services in 5. He presented his peace plan for a ceasefire in the West, the removal or surrender of Hitler and the continuation of the war in the East.\n\nHowever, the United States and England never entered into direct negotiations and did not give guarantees to the leaders of the German Resistance. Roosevelt demanded Germany's unconditional surrender. Churchill, who wanted to crush not only Hitler’s National Socialism, but also “Prussian militarism”, wanting to forever destroy Germany as a competitor to England on the world stage, opposed any contacts with figures of the German opposition.\n\nOnly in 1944, after the victorious spring-summer offensive of Soviet troops and the landing of Anglo-American forces in Normandy, when the German opposition was defeated, Western leaders began to look for the possibility of concluding a separate agreement with Berlin and entered into negotiations with Reichsführer SS Himmler. In the West they were afraid that the Russians would occupy most of Germany and Western Europe.\n\nKarl Friedrich Goerdeler (1884 - February 2, 1945, Berlin) - German politician, one of the leaders of the conservative wing of the anti-Hitler conspiracy. He was the main candidate for the post of chancellor in the post-Hitler government of the country. A few days before the coup attempt on July 20, 1944, the Gestapo decided to arrest Goerdeler, but he managed to go underground. Arrested on August 12. On September 7–8, 1944, Goerdeler was the main defendant in the People's Court trial of the civilian participants in the conspiracy and was sentenced to death. However, the execution of the sentence was postponed, which allowed him, at the direction of Himmler, to develop a program for the development of local government, the economy and urban services. On February 2, 1945, he was executed in Plötzensee prison.\n\nPeace with the Russians\n\nThe unexpected successes of Hitler and the Wehrmacht in Poland, Denmark, Norway, Holland and France, and then in the USSR, also became the defeat of the German Resistance. Some believed in Hitler's lucky star, others lost heart and were disappointed. Only those most irreconcilable with Hitler's policies fought.\n\nThus, among the active opponents of the war with the USSR was the former German Ambassador to the Union, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg. Even before the German attack, von Schulenburg warned Moscow in May 1941 about an imminent German attack on the USSR. He made every effort to prevent war, notifying Berlin of the powerful military-industrial potential of the USSR.\n\nAfter the defeat of German troops near Moscow in the winter of 1941–1942. and the failure of the blitzkrieg, Schulenburg sent a note to the Fuhrer with a proposal to begin separate negotiations with Moscow, but did not receive support. After this, Schulenburg became a figure in the Resistance and was considered as a possible candidate for the post of Foreign Minister after the coup.\n\nSchulenburg represented a wing in the German Resistance that was oriented not only towards the Western powers, but also towards the USSR. They opposed an alliance with England and the United States directed against the USSR. They did not consider the Stalinist regime an obstacle to the restoration of normal relations after the liquidation of Hitler, since Weimar Germany successfully cooperated with Moscow, including in the military-technical sphere. Schulenburg and his like-minded people wanted peace with the USSR and the resumption of mutually beneficial German-Russian relations.\n\nOne of the most irreconcilable conspirators was the Prussian nobleman, General Staff officer at the headquarters of Army Group Center Henning von Treskow. He established contacts with the conspirators back in 1938, and after the start of the war with the USSR, he expressed a sharp rejection of terrorism in relation to Jews, commanders and political workers of the Red Army. He believed that bloody terror would lead to the loss of Germany’s honor: “Germany will finally lose its honor, and this will make itself felt for hundreds of years. The blame for this will be placed not on Hitler alone, but on you and me, on your wife and mine, on your children and mine.” And so it happened.\n\nEven before the start of the war, Treskov argued that only the liquidation of Hitler would save Germany. Treskov believed that the conspirators should revolt in any case. Even if the attempt to assassinate Hitler and the military coup fails, they will remove the shame from Germany and show the whole world that not all Germans agree with the policies of the National Socialists. Treskov, like Schulenburg and Count Claus Schenck von Stauffenberg, was a supporter of good relations with the USSR. The group of Stauffenberg and Treskov believed that peace should be concluded not only with England and the USA, but also with the USSR.\n\nBaron Rudolf-Christoph von Gersdorff (1905–1980) – Major General, active participant in the German Resistance movement and plans to assassinate Hitler. For the impending assassination attempt on Hitler, scheduled for July 20, 1944, Gersdorff stored explosives and detonators. His accomplice Baron Wessel Freytag von Loringofen, after the failure of the “conspiracy of the generals,” committed suicide without extraditing Gersdorf, who was one of the few who managed to survive\n\nFailed attempts\n\nTreskov, while on the Eastern Front, prepared several plans to assassinate the Fuhrer. But every time something prevented the plan from being implemented.\n\nSo, on March 13, 1943, during Adolf Hitler’s visit to Army Group Center, a bomb was planted on the Fuhrer’s plane under the guise of a parcel (Operation Flash). It was supposed to explode during Hitler's return by plane from Smolensk to Berlin. But the fuse did not go off. There is a version that it did not work because the temperature in the luggage compartment of the plane was too low.\n\nA few days later, the commander of Treskov, Colonel Baron Rudolf-Christoph von Gersdorf, attempted an attempt on the Fuhrer. 21 March 1943, Hitler and other top leaders of the Third Reich were to attend the war trophy exhibition at the Ceughgauz arms museum on Unter den Linden, where the war was commemorated. Hitler should have stayed Zeihgauze hour. As the guide, the head of the intelligence of Army Group “Center” von Gersdorf was supposed to act.\n\nGersdorf was ready to sacrifice himself for the common cause. The colonel hid two small magnetic time bombs in his clothes and planned to blow himself up in close proximity to Hitler and his entourage. When the Führer appeared on the captured weapons insert, Gersdorff set the fuse for 20 minutes. But after 15 minutes, Hitler unexpectedly left the building, and the plan was not implemented. With great difficulty, the officer managed to prevent the explosion.\n\nThere were other German officers who were ready to sacrifice themselves to eliminate the Fuhrer. In November 1943, a young German officer, Axel von dem Bussche, planned to assassinate Adolf Hitler during a display of new German military uniforms. During the demonstration, he hid grenades in his clothes and planned to detonate them when the Fuhrer approached. However, Hitler, for some unknown reason, did not attend the show. It is worth noting that the Fuhrer simply had an animal intuition for troubles; he was saved many times by some miracle.\n\nAnother assassination attempt was prepared by Lieutenant Edward von Kleist. A 22-year-old Wehrmacht lieutenant, recovering after being wounded on the Western Front, received a telegram ordering him to immediately return to his unit. The commander of the reserve army, von Stauffenberg, met with the lieutenant and asked whether he would agree to destroy the Fuhrer at the cost of his own life.\n\nHitler was going to present a distinguished compound and show a new form. Kleist was supposed to bring an explosive device on himself and blow it up when Hitler was nearby. Edward's father, a native of the aristocratic Prussian clan and commander tank group during the invasion of France and the USSR, Field Marshal General supported his son: “You must agree. If you miss the moment, your life will have no meaning. And I made up my mind. I don't think the reason for this decision was my courage. The reason was conscience.\"\n\nAnd this attempt was not carried out. The entire supply of new uniforms was destroyed during the bombing, and the parade was cancelled.\n\nHenning Hermann Robert Karl von Treskow (1901 - July 21, 1944) - Major General of the German Army (1944), one of the active participants in the conspiracy against Hitler. Having learned about the failure of the assassination attempt on Hitler on July 20, 1944 and realizing the inevitability of arrest, von Treskow told his adjutant Fabian von Schlabrendorff, who also participated in the plot: “They will soon find out about me and will try to extract the names of our comrades from me. To warn them, I must sacrifice my life.\" On July 21, von Treskow went to the front line, entered no man's land, simulated combat with pistol shots, and then blew himself up with a hand grenade.\n\nOperation Valkyrie\n\nFrom the winter of 1941–1942 Deputy Commander of the Reserve Army, General Friedrich Olbricht, led the development of the Valkyrie plan. The plan had to come into force during an emergency or internal unrest. Thus, the Valkyrie plan could be implemented during mass acts of sabotage or a prisoner-of-war uprising. In such a situation, the reserve army was subject to mobilization.\n\nGeneral Olbricht changed the plan in the interests of the conspirators. After the liquidation of Adolf Hitler, the reserve army was supposed to become the main support of the rebels. With its help, they planned to occupy key facilities in the German capital and the most important communications, suppress possible resistance from the SS troops, the Gestapo, and arrest the top Nazi leadership and active supporters of the Fuhrer.\n\nOne of the conspirators, the head of the Wehrmacht communications service, Erich Felgiebel, was supposed to, with his assistants, ensure the blocking of a number of government communication lines. At the same time, he had to ensure communication between the rebels. The rebels also planned to capture the most important cities of the empire - Vienna, Munich, Cologne, and Paris.\n\nConsidering the number of SS and Air Force troops in the capital (they were loyal to Hitler and Goering), much attention was paid to the timing of the operation to capture the capital. The first hours were critical to the success of the operation. It was necessary in a short period of time to occupy the Reich Chancellery, the ministries and headquarters of the SS and Gestapo, the national broadcasting office and two radio stations in the capital, as well as the telegraph and telephone centers. Goebbels, who rarely left Berlin, was planned to be arrested.\n\nIt was also necessary to isolate Hitler's headquarters in Rastenburg so that neither Goering, nor Himmler, nor generals like Keitel or Jodl would try to seize power in the country and would not begin to gather troops to defend the Nazi regime. An important task was the arrest of General von Kortzfleisch, a Nazi to the core. He commanded a district that included Brandenburg and Berlin. They planned to arrest him and replace him with General Tüngen.\n\nThen they were going to transmit messages and already prepared appeals by radio, telephone and telegraph to the commanders of reserve army units in other German cities and to the commanders of troops at the fronts that Hitler had been killed and an anti-Nazi provisional government had been created in the capital. The rebels believed that within 24 hours they must take power into their own hands. Otherwise, the wavering generals will organize, they can be led by Goering and Himmler, a civil war will begin, chaos and anarchy will arise. This had to be avoided.\n\nThe conspirators believed that the commander of the reserve army, Colonel-General Friedrich Fromm would be forced to join the insurrection or be temporarily detained and cut off from the leadership. In this case, the leadership of the army should have been taken over by General Erich Göpner.\n\nHoepner was very offended by Hitler. The general commanded the 4th Tank Group during the invasion of the USSR, but during the Battle of Moscow he fell into disgrace and was sent into retirement. Hoepner ignored the Fuhrer's order to hold out to the last and began to withdraw troops. For this, Hitler removed the general from his post with the wording “for cowardice and disobedience to orders” and was dismissed from the Wehrmacht without the right to wear a military uniform and awards, as well as without the right to a pension.\n\nThe commander of the reserve army, Friedrich Fromm, was privy to the plans of the conspirators. He refused to participate in Operation Valkyrie. Although he did not betray the conspirators. Fromm was ready to support the coup only if the Fuhrer was liquidated. Therefore, the mission of Colonel Stauffenberg played a very important role in the operation. In addition, the conspirators drew up a whole series of orders on behalf of Fromm in order to obtain the support of the reserve army.\n\nAfter the liquidation of Hitler and the arrest of Nazi leaders, the conspirators planned to establish a provisional government. The leader of the German opposition, Colonel General Ludwig August Theodor Beck, was to become the head of Germany. The main candidate for the post of chancellor in the post-Hitler government was the leader of the civil opposition, a conservative, Karl Friedrich Goerdeler. With the help of a group of professors from the University of Freiburg - Adolf Lampe, Walter Eucken, Gerhard Ritter and others - he developed plans for the post-war structure of Germany.\n\nThe German armed forces were to be led by Erwin von Witzleben. In Germany they were going to hold democratic elections to the lower house of parliament, to resolve the issue of the form of government - whether it was a monarchy or a republic. The Provisional Government intended, as a first foreign policy step, to make peace with the Western powers, and possibly with the USSR. At the same time, Western-oriented figures planned to conclude a strategic alliance with Great Britain and the United States and continue the war with the Soviet Union as part of a coalition of great Western powers.\n\nJob-Wilhelm Georg Erdmann \"Erwin\" von Witzleben (1881 - August 8, 1944) was a German military leader (from 1940 - Field Marshal General). A prominent figure in the anti-Nazi opposition. On July 20, 1944, after von Stauffenberg's assassination attempt on Hitler, Witzleben arrived in Berlin and, in full military uniform with a field marshal's baton, appeared at the headquarters of the reserve army, where the leaders of the military action against Hitler were located. Having announced his acceptance of the duties of Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht, he appointed General Hoepner as commander of the reserve army, and General Tüngen-Rossbach as commander of the 3rd Military District (Berlin). He gave the order to the commander of the occupation forces in France, General Stülpnagel, to arrest all SS and SD employees in Paris. Having learned that Hitler was alive, and realizing that the chances of success of the speech were slim, he accused the organizers of the conspiracy of amateurism and defiantly left the building, having stayed in it for about 45 minutes. On July 21 he was arrested. On August 7, he appeared along with several other conspirators before the People's Trial Chamber. On August 8, like the other defendants, he was sentenced to death by hanging. Soon the sentence was carried out in Plötzensee prison.\n\nStauffenberg mission\n\nThe conspirators pinned their hopes for success on the figure of Colonel Klaus Schenck von Stauffenberg. Count Stauffenberg was born into one of the oldest aristocratic families in Southern Germany, which was connected to the royal house of Württemberg. The young man was raised in the classic family style - Catholic piety, monarchism and patriotism.\n\nAccording to contemporaries, Klaus had not only rare beauty and athletic build, but also an inquisitive mind and prudence. The young man was interested in various sports, especially loved horses (he began serving in the cavalry), and was also interested in art and literature, and read a lot. For some time, the count even thought about becoming a professional musician and was interested in architecture.\n\nWhile studying at the military academy in Berlin, he attracted the attention of teachers and high command with his brilliant erudition. In 1938, after graduating from the Military Academy of the General Staff, he was appointed second officer of the General Staff under the command of Lieutenant General Erich Hoepner.\n\nInitially, the count was actively involved in the process of building the Third Reich war machine and supported Hitler’s policy. Stauffenberg refused the first proposals to join the group of the German Resistance. He distinguished himself as a staff officer of the 6th Panzer Division of General Göpner, who participated in hostilities in Poland and France.\n\nHowever, the count gradually reconsidered his views. It was in Russia that Stauffenberg completely lost faith in the possibility of victory for the Third Reich. The atrocities of the German and SS troops caused protest among the aristocrat. On the Eastern Front, Stauffenberg met two leading conspirators at that time, who finally convinced him. It was General von Treskow and his adjutant, military lawyer Fabian von Schlabrendorff, who acted as a link between von Treskow’s headquarters and the leaders of the conspiracy in Berlin, Beck and Goerdeler.\n\nIn 1943 he was assigned to the 10th Panzer Division, which fought in North Africa. There he was seriously wounded, losing his left eye, his right hand and two fingers on his left hand, and was shot in the head near the left ear and in the knee. This wound nearly took his life and sight. But in the Munich hospital, Stauffenberg was raised to his feet. After persistent exercises, the count regained the mobility of his left hand and asked to be returned to service.\n\nA serious injury led to a final revolution in the count’s mind; he decided that he was obliged to take on a sacred mission. “I feel that I must now do something to save Germany,” he told his wife, Baroness Nina von Lerchenfeld, who visited him in hospital.\n\nBy the end of September, 1943, the count returned to the German capital with the rank of lieutenant colonel and was appointed to the position of chief of staff under General Olbricht in the management of the ground forces. Using the three remaining fingers of a healthy hand, he studied the British-made bombs in the Abwehr.\n\nStauffenberg organized a circle of the most active conspirators. The decisive role in the operation was to be played by: Olbricht, the head of the organizational directorate of the ground forces, General Stiff, the first quartermaster general of the ground forces, General Eduard Wagner, the head of the communications service at the Supreme High Command, General Erich Felgiebel, the head of the artillery and technical department, General Fritz Lindemann, the head of the Berlin commandant's office General Paul von Hase, head of the department of foreign armies Colonel Baron von Renne, Berlin police chief Count von Helldorf and others.\n\nThe conspiracy could also support General Fromm, but waited news about the death of Hitler. Field Marshal von Witzleben was also ready to support the coup, but had no real power. They planned to use his authority during the coup. Field Marshal von Rundstedt, who commanded all the troops in the West, was also probed, but he avoided participating in the conspiracy.\n\nRommel, who had been appointed commander of Army Group B in Northern France in early 1944, expressed his willingness to support the plot. But most of the conspirators did not trust him. They considered the Desert Fox a Nazi, an opportunist who decided to abandon the Fuhrer only after it became clear that Germany was losing the war. At the same time, Rommel was against the liquidation of Hitler, believing that then he would become a martyr. He insisted on Hitler's arrest and trial.\n\nThe group conspirators included the commander of the troops in occupied France, General Karl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel. After the liquidation of Hitler, he had to seize power in Paris, arrest the members of the SS and the Gestapo, and begin negotiations with the Western powers for peace.\n\nFrom left to right: Stauffenberg, Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, Karl-Heinrich Bodenschatz (standing with his back to the lens), Adolf Hitler, Wilhelm Keitel. July 15, 1944\n\nAttempt\n\nIn June 1944, the conspirators realized that the leaders of the German Resistance could be arrested at any moment. The circle of rebels expanded greatly, and the Gestapo could soon reach the inner circle of the conspiracy. The Gestapo was getting closer and closer, the number of arrests among people associated with the German opposition was constantly growing. Many were executed. Beck, Goerdeler, Witzleben and others were under constant surveillance. Canaris was in disgrace.\n\nThe situation was difficult at the fronts as well. At the beginning of July, Rome was lost, and a powerful offensive of the Red Army began on the Eastern Front. In the West, on June 6, Anglo-American troops opened a Second Front in France. Germany's military defeat was approaching. It was necessary to act.\n\nTreskov and his subordinate military engineer, Major Joachim Kuhn, prepared two bombs. On July 6, Colonel Stauffenberg delivered a bomb to the Berghof, but the assassination attempt was postponed. On July 11, the Chief of Staff of the Army Reserve attended a meeting at the Berghof, but did not activate the explosive device.\n\nThe leaders of the conspiracy wanted, together with Hitler, to destroy Goering, who was the official successor of the Fuhrer, and Reichsfuhrer SS Himmler, in order to eliminate all possible leaders of the Nazi resistance with one blow. But Goering and Himmler were not present at the meeting.\n\nAfter this, Stauffenberg convinced Beck and Olbricht that the priority target was Hitler, and the bomb must be detonated in any case, regardless of whether Goering and Himmler would participate in the meeting.\n\nOn July 15, another attempt was made to assassinate Hitler. The count participated in a military meeting in the “Wolf’s Lair” (“Wolfsschanze”) in the Görlitz forest near the city of Rastenburg. Olbricht two hours before the meeting gave the order for troops to move to the area of ​​the government quarter on Wilhelmstrasse.\n\nHowever, Hitler left headquarters earlier than Stauffenberg planned. The attempt failed. The colonel had to quickly inform Olbricht about the failure of the operation. The general returned the troops to their places of deployment, explaining their movement as exercises.\n\nOn July 20, Count Stauffenberg and his orderly, Senior Lieutenant Werner von Heften, arrived at Hitler's headquarters with two bombs. Colonel Stauffenberg was supposed to make a report on the formation of new units for the Eastern Front. The head of the Wehrmacht High Command, Wilhelm Keitel, said that the meeting was moved from a bunker on the surface to a wooden house due to the heat. This was bad news, since an explosion in a closed underground room would be more effective.\n\nThe colonel asked to take him to a separate room to change clothes. There Stauffenberg began to prepare the fuses. It was difficult to do with one injured hand, and the colonel was able to prepare and fold into the briefcase only one explosive device. Instead of two bombs, the count remained alone. About 15 minutes left before the explosion. Keitel and Stauffenberg entered the house where the meeting was held. Most of those present (at the meeting there was a 23 man) sat at a massive oak table. The Count sat down on Hitler’s right and placed the briefcase closer to the Führer. 5 minutes before the explosion, Stauffenberg left the house.\n\nA happy accident saved the Fuhrer this time too.\n\nOne of the meeting participants put his briefcase under the table. At 12:42 there was a strong explosion. Almost everyone present was injured, including Hitler, and 4 people died. Count Stauffenberg, deciding that Hitler was dead, left the headquarters until it was blocked.\n\nAdolf Hitler and his entourage after a bomb explosion during a meeting at the main headquarters \"Wolfschanze\". To the left behind Hitler is the head of the NSDAP party chancellery, Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, to the right of the Fuhrer with a bandage on his head is the head of the operational department of the Supreme High Command of the German Armed Forces, Colonel General Alfred Jodl. To the right of Jodl are Hitler’s adjutant from the Luftwaffe, Colonel Nikolaus von Below, and Hitler’s personal pilot, SS Brigadeführer Hans Baur. July 20, 1944\n\nEnd of the rebellion\n\nAt 13:15 he flew into the capital. Two and a half hours later the plane arrived in Berlin. There the colonel learned that due to conflicting reports from the Wolf's Lair, the conspirators did nothing. Stauffenberg informed Olbricht that Hitler had been killed. Olbricht invites Fromm to lead the rebellion. Fromm called headquarters (the conspirators were unable to block all communication lines) and learned from Keitel that the Fuhrer was alive, so he refused to lead the uprising.\n\nIt was 16:30 on the clock, and the conspirators had not yet done anything to seize control of the country. Then Stauffenberg took control into his own hands. He and Beck went to Fromm and demanded that he sign the Valkyrie plan. The general refused. He was arrested.\n\nThe reserve army was led by Hoepner. Stauffenberg began to convince unit commanders that Hitler had been killed, and Beck and Witzleben were taking military leadership into their own hands. In Vienna, Prague and Paris, the implementation of the Valkyrie plan began. General Stülpnagel was especially successful. In Paris, the entire leadership of the SS and Gestapo was arrested without firing a single shot.\n\nThis was where the rebels' successes ended.\n\nToo much time was wasted. Hitler was alive, and many knew about it; the doubters decided to stay away from the rebellion. In Berlin, key facilities were not captured, including the Reich Security Headquarters, the Reich Chancellery, the Propaganda Ministry and the radio station.\n\nAt about 6 pm, the Berlin military commandant and conspirator Hase ordered the commander of the Grossdeutschland guard battalion, Major Otto-Ernst Roemer, to cordon off the government quarter. Major Roemer contacted Propaganda Minister Goebbels and through him received information that Hitler was alive. The Fuhrer ordered the major to suppress the uprising at any cost.\n\nBy 8 pm, soldiers loyal to Hitler had taken control of the main government buildings in the capital. At 22:40, Roemer's soldiers arrested von Stauffenberg and the other rebels. The rebellion was suppressed.\n\nStülpnagel released those arrested in Paris, declaring the incident a training exercise. But it was too late. The general was summoned to the headquarters of the High Command. Along the way, he tried to commit suicide, but only wounded himself. On August 30, 1944, the general was executed.\n\nColonel General Fromm, trying to cover up the traces of his participation in the conspiracy, organized a military tribunal, which sentenced the organizers of the conspiracy, including Stauffenberg, to death. Olbricht and Beck were killed.\n\nThe next day, the Third Reich formed a special commission to investigate the conspiracy. A wave of terror swept across Germany. Many prominent military leaders and civilian participants in the conspiracy were arrested and executed. So, Witzleben and Rommel were executed (he was forced to poison himself). In total, more than 7 thousand people were arrested, about 200 people were executed.\n\nAs a result, the German Resistance was defeated.\n\nIt is possible that this was the best outcome for the USSR. After the assassination of Hitler, the conspirators could conclude a separate peace with England and the USA, and together act against the Russians.\n\nHermann Goering and Martin Bormann inspect the consequences of the explosion at the Fuhrer's Wolfschanze headquarters.
