The Family von Witzleben is a nearly 1,000-year-old lineage that found its origin in present day Thuringia. However, the family name can be found not only throughout Germany, but also abroad.

For this reason, das Gut Hude, the convent school Rossleben, and Weingartsgreuth Castle have become popular family attractions. Hude is also home to the von Witzleben family archive, burial place, and is the location of the memorial to the fallen from the First and Second World Wars.

In 1951-52 the estate in Hude moved from the Liebensteiner line of the Family von Witzleben, to the Wendelsteiner line, and is continues on this branch today.
