        "text": "It has been 20 years since Mr. Toshiki Kaifu first visited the fledgling democracy of Mongolia as Prime Minister of Japan. This visit led to Japan and Mongolia deepening ties and to building a solid partnership in a wide range of fields, including politics, economics and academia. Recognizing these important developments, Japan's new Ambassador to Mongolia (from September 1), Mr. Takenori Shimizu, recently paid a courtesy call on Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. Both men are graduates of Chuo University and at their meeting on September 30 spoke about future bilateral relations and expectations for students.\n\n\"Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu became the foundation of relations between the two countries\"\n\nShimizu:\n\nRecently, I was appointed Ambassador to Mongolia and this will be my fourth appointment in Mongolia. In fact, when you visited Mongolia in 1991, I was undertaking my second appointment in the country as an official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Even now, I vividly recall my excitement about the fact that you are my senior in university and could come to the country while I was serving there. Moreover, your visit led to rapid development in the relationship between Japan and Mongolia, so I am also truly grateful as a person who specializes in Mongolia.\n\nKaifu:\n\nAt the time of that visit, I was deeply impressed by a gift horse I received from the then President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat. That was a prized horse that had won in Naadam (the national sports festival of Mongolia). I heard that in Mongolia, a horse is a really considerable gift. However, although I was very grateful, I had no place to keep the horse if I brought it back to Japan, so I thought it would be very unfortunate for the horse. Therefore, when I returned I just brought back its reins.\n\nShimizu:\n\nThat horse was named Kaishun. Kai is from your family name and Shun is from Japanese word Shunme that means fleet horse. After that visit and before I was appointed to the Japanese embassy in Washington in 1998 I also paid you visit. On that occasion, I was introduced to your oldest son's wife, who I had also worked with when I was in Canada.\n\nKaifu:\n\nYes, that's right. I am not sure whether it was that time or when we met in Mongolia, but I remember your face very well.\n\nShimizu:\n\nThank you. It was due to the efforts of various people that the relationship between Mongolia and Japan developed in a favorable fashion, but recently, there has been increasing activity around the mineral resources of Mongolia to win these rights, such as by Russia, America and Brazil. Japan must make sure not to fall behind in this movement, so I feel that this will be my biggest job as Ambassador to Mongolia. I hope that I can continue to count on your support.\n\nKaifu:\n\nI understand. It seems that China also has an interest in these mineral resources. When I visited Mongolia, the country had a very deep relationship with Russia, but recently, it appears that China is really focusing on developing relations with Mongolia.\n\nShimizu:\n\nYes, you're right. In terms of its economy, 80% of Mongolia's trade was with Russia in the 1990s, but now 70% is with China and the amount of this financial assistance has also risen greatly. However, the people of Mongolia have been undergoing the process of democratization since 1990, which is to say that they remember well that it was Japan that gave them assistance when they most needed it. In the recent Great East Japan Earthquake, the Mongolian government held an extraordinary meeting of the Cabinet the day after the quake and pledged to send an emergency aid group and a million dollars as emergency aid. Furthermore, not only did government workers across the country agree to donate one day's wages for the disaster, a great many ordinary people also held fundraising activities. At this point, over 300 million yen has been collected.\n\nKaifu:\n\nI believe the population of Mongolia is around 2.8 million, so in terms of the number of people, that is a fairly large amount.\n\nShimizu:\n\nYes, this is the gratitude of the Mongolian people toward Japan. Of course, this came about because of your visit to the country. I deeply feel that your visit was of great historic significance to Japan and Mongolia.\n\n\"The people of Mongolia have strong compassion\"\n\nKaifu:\n\nI am really happy to hear you say that. My visit to Mongolia was the first as Prime Minister of Japan and it was also the first by a leader from the West after democratization, so it was an extremely good thing. When I visited the country again some years later, I was eating a meal at a restaurant when I could hear a horse's cry. As I was wondering what was happening, I saw that Kaishun, my horse, had been brought to me by the people taking care of him. I was once again deeply moved by the consideration for me. I thought that this could truly be called heart-to-heart communication. The people of Mongolia have strong compassion, or perhaps I should say an emotional heart. I think their mentality is similar to that of Japanese people.\n\nShimizu:\n\nMongolians and Japanese share various aspects, such as the grammar of our languages and Mongolian birthmarks, and I feel there are also racial connections. If you visit again and again, it is easy to become friends with Mongolians, then you will also get to go drinking and singing with them. It really feels like returning to one's hometown.\n\nKaifu:\n\nEven with important government officials, if we become close, they treat me like I am a relative. I also became friendly with Dashiin Byambasuren, who was Prime Minister in 1990, and afterwards we talked about various things. I think that now, alongside President George Bush, he is a man that makes communications from the heart. In particular, the impression that remains with me today is his words: \"Our country is surrounded and watched over by China and the Soviet Union, but we have pride in the flourishing pivot point.\" When I asked, \"What is the pivot point?\" he replied, \"That is Japan.\" From Japan's perseverance they, too, can hold their heads up high, he said.\n\nShimizu:\n\nYes, that truly sounds like the feelings that the people of Mongolia hold. Mongolian people seem to think that people among their race crossed over the sea to become Japanese and now persevere with the best. Therefore, Japan's economic prosperity, which is envied all over the world, as well as the fact that Japanese people maintain their own history and culture, are delighted in by the Mongolian people. I have also heard this kind of thing from many important people in the country.\n\nKaifu:\n\nMr. Shimizu, how many years have you been responsible for Mongolia in total?\n\nShimizu:\n\nI have worked in the country for about eight and a half years, but if I include the time when I was responsible for Mongolia in Tokyo, then it would be around 14 and a half years in total. I have been in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for around 35 years, so over one third of my time has been connected with Mongolia. Even in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, people who are given new appointments to return back to the same country are surprisingly few. In particular, this year, apart from me, there were almost none. In my case, this is my fourth appointment, so I have known the President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister for a long time. It really will feel like going back home. In that sense, I can start discussions with these important people immediately after my appointment. I am a Mongolian specialist who is returning back to Mongolia. I really appreciate this.\n\n\"Toward further cooperation, I have high hope for you.\"\n\nKaifu:\n\nI heard that Chuo University, both of our alma maters, especially the Faculty of Science and Engineering, has a great deal of enthusiasm about promoting exchanges with the National University of Mongolia. On the occasion on your appointment, I hope to be able to cooperate with you.\n\nShimizu:\n\nThat is really great to hear, I would really welcome your help. It is surprisingly not very well known, but Mongolians are a people that really excel at math. In recent years in Mongolia there have been an increasing number of people who are studying overseas in Japan and China. In particular, students of science and technology are leaving the country to become excellent engineers at Japanese universities. Recently, Japanese companies have also started to take notice of this and I think that is really making progress in all fields of science and technology. Moreover, with China to the south and Russia to the north, there is a large market here, so if Japanese technology and Mongolian excellence in science and technology are combined, this may produce significant results. With these expectations, I hope to give extensive support to the partnerships between the universities. If possible, I would like my alma mater and Mongolia to develop strong ties.\n\nKaifu:\n\nIn terms of personnel, of course, and recently, there has also been a great deal of attention on Mongolia as a producer of mineral resources. So I also hear reports about discoveries of the latest and newest mineral resources. Mongolia is becoming a new spot people cannot take their eyes from in various aspects.\n\nShimizu:\n\nAbsolutely. With the investment of a Canadian company, a fairly large copper mine is already in operation. Furthermore, at present, activity has started in earnest to develop the Tavan Tolgoi coal mining area, which is said to hold the world's largest reserves of the coking coal. Japan is also attempting to participate in this development, so I think this will become my biggest job after I take office.\n\nKaifu:\n\nI think Mongolia has expectations for the technological strength of Japan. I expect that there are many Japanese companies that can provide equipment for surveys and mining.\n\nShimizu:\n\nI think you are exactly right. A long time ago, in the Yuan dynasty, merchants from around the world used to gather in Karakorum. Nowadays, resource development companies, financial firms and securities companies throughout the world come to Mongolia in search of possibilities in all fields. Mongolia is moving from being a remote and distant country to one that has been opened up and where the people of the world gather. I think we can say that the current bearing of fruits has been assisted by Japanese efforts over the last 20 years.\n\nKaifu:\n\nAt the time of participation in cooperation and resource development between the universities, I hope we can take advantage of the good relations Japan and Mongolia have built up over the years. Please stay firmly committed to these efforts. I have high hopes you will play an active role.\n\nShimizu:\n\nOf course, thank you very much. After I take up office, I will immediately look to hold a frank exchange of views with important people in the Mongolian government and will make sure to see what areas Japan can participate in.\n\n\"I hope young people also actively shift their focus to countries overseas\"\n\nShimizu:\n\nMr. Kaifu, you have already been active in the political world for nearly 50 years, haven't you? For students of Chuo University, the tireless efforts you made rising to the position of Prime Minister of Japan are a great encouragement.\n\nKaifu:\n\nIf that is the case, it makes me very happy. I was asked to give a message to graduates on the occasion of their graduation ceremony, but although it was only a simple statement, I think it was a good one. \"During your student days, study!\" After you have graduated you can get to do what you want to do, and if you want to become a politician, you can come to see me. However, I cannot really say that I have much to be proud about my own student days (laughs).\n\nShimizu:\n\nSpeaking of university, I graduated from the Faculty of Law, but in fact I failed the bar examination. When I was considering what to do next, I thought that I would like to try going somewhere overseas. After taking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs profession examination, my Chinese, which I had studied from my third year, bore fruit and luckily I was accepted. After entering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I studied overseas for two years. In my first year, I went to England to learn Mongolian in English and then in my second year I got the opportunity to study Mongolian in Mongolia. That was how I started my career.\n\nKaifu:\n\nAre there many ambassadors who also graduated from Chuo University?\n\nShimizu:\n\nAt this moment in time there are three ambassadors, including me, who graduated from Chuo University, but last year there were a lot more. In fact, originally there were a great many graduates of Chuo University in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. That number has decreased a lot over the last several years, but even among my contemporaries there were four or five people. One is now a Consul General and so there is a possibility he too will become an ambassador. Therefore, Chuo University is never an institution estranged from the world of international relations. I hope that current students will also make an active effort to place their focus abroad. In recent years, students have shied away from studying overseas and I hear there is a trend to settle in Japan. I think this will mean that people won't know foreign languages and it will also have a negative impact on business, as they won't be able to work as citizens of the world.\n\nKaifu:\n\nYes, starting with students of Chuo University, I hope that young people will take the opportunity to go overseas. And I hope that there will then be a deepening of interaction with other countries.\n\nShimizu:\n\nYes, I really hope so. Thank you very much for your time today.\n\nToshiki Kaifu\n\nThe 76th and 77th Prime Minister of Japan\n\nBorn in Aichi Prefecture in 1931.
