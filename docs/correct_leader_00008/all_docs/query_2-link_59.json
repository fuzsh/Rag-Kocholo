        "text": "Riley\n\nWe get questions all the time about video, particularly from the library people, because they love to have exhibits.\n\nBecker\n\nThey love to have video.\n\nRiley\n\nThis actually started with the idea that there would be a lot of video, and I think it survived one episode with Brent Scowcroft, where he got so furious with the fussing and the lighting and everything.\n\nBecker\n\nYes. I bet most of your subjects are just so relieved. I know I was. It's just more comfortable and you don't have to worry about all sorts of things.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat you look like. Most of the people we deal with are used to being on television, but not everybody, and I still think people are more self-conscious about cameras.\n\nBecker\n\nAbsolutely. I think you're absolutely right.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right, just for the record, this is the Jean Becker interview as part of the George H. W. Bush Oral History Project. We're doing this in Jean's office on Walker's Point, at Kennebunkport, which I'm thrilled to be invited to.\n\nBecker\n\nAre you going to talk about the view?\n\nRiley\n\nThere's a wonderful view behind her head that I can watch as we converse. We talked about the ground rules before we came on, the number one being confidentiality. Just as a start, tell me about the seasonal dynamic with your schedule. We're here in Maine now, but you were in Texas up until just a little while ago. What's the pattern and what's the daily rhythm like here?\n\nBecker\n\nIt's like clockwork. The seasonal schedule is the Bushes spend five months in Maine and seven months in Houston--May through October here, and then October back to May. Three staff people come with them: President Bush's aide, Mrs. [Barbara] Bush's aide, and myself. Somebody has to do it, so I fall on my sword and come to Kennebunkport. The work and everything come with us, but as I tell the Houston staff who gets left behind, the minus is they miss us terribly; the plus is we bring the troublemaker with us. That would be George Bush. It's a little different here, because he spends a lot of time on his boat. You know, it's just a great place to have to go to work every day.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you ever go out on the boat with him?\n\nBecker\n\nOh, yes. It's my duty to go out there.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course.\n\nBecker\n\nOf course, yes.\n\nRiley\n\nAre you okay on waves?\n\nBecker\n\nI have great sea legs. I grew up on a farm in Missouri, so it's a miracle that I have great sea legs, but I do.\n\nRiley\n\nAre there differences between the day-to-day life up here, compared to life there?\n\nBecker\n\nVery much so, because the whole family comes here. This is where the family comes to spend time with their parents and grandparents. In Houston--I'll go back a couple of years. The President is almost 87, so his life has changed a lot in the last couple of years. He has a form of Parkinson's disease, and he is increasingly more frail. He probably is now a normal 87 year-old. Up until he was 83 or 84, President Bush came to the office every single day. He would get there before 8:00 and would stay until 6:00. His work ethic was unbelievable. Ten years ago, he would get there between 7:00 and 7:30, but even then.? Houston's much more of a normal--It's an office work life. Here, because our office is located at Walker's Point where their home is, he sort of drifts in and out of the office, and there are always other people here.\n\nThere's a granddaughter here now, who goes to SMU [Southern Methodist University], and five of her friends: two girlfriends and three boyfriends. That's been amusing. The Bushes have been the chaperones. It's been really fun to watch. But they're thrilled. Their grandson, Jebby [John Ellis Bush Jr.] and his wife, who's expecting their first great-grandchild, arrive tomorrow. Their daughter, Doro [Dorothy Walker Bush Koch]--One of her daughters arrives today for the weekend, and that's how it is all summer. There will not be a day between now and Labor Day that there's not one family member here. Sometimes every bed on the Point is full and it's chaos.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you have to make reservations or make arrangements, or do they just show up?\n\nBecker\n\nI tease Barbara Bush's aide that her job turns almost into being the concierge of Walker's Point in the summertime. Everybody emails their mom. Mrs. Bush sort of runs the hotel business here. Starting right after Christmas, people will start emailing Mrs. Bush, their mom, asking, \"How are these dates?\" It's seldom that she would have to say to someone, \"I'm out of beds,\" but they do have to--We've been full a couple of times. It depends on how many people you want to bring with you.\n\nRiley\n\nI see.\n\nBecker\n\nThe grandkids, in particular, like to bring friends, and even some of the kids like to have overnight guests. Then we can get sort of full.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you know how many people it sleeps here?\n\nBecker\n\nOne time I counted and I thought I counted 33, which almost seems low, because there's a couple of guest cottages and the big house. The third floor of the big house is a dorm with bunk beds where the grandkids always used to sleep, but they're all growing up now. That dorm isn't as valuable as it used to be. When the grandkids were little, that's where they all stayed. Well, now they're getting married and they don't want to go up in the dorm and sleep up there. Sometimes there's definitely overflow in the dorm. I think the Point sleeps somewhere between 33 and 40.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd there are cottages on the outside?\n\nBecker\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nIs that privileged property, too, or does everybody want to be in the main house?\n\nBecker\n\nWell, over the years, people have sort of settled into patterns of where they stay. I'll tell you a great story, when George W. [Bush] was President, I don't know the year but it was over the Fourth of July weekend. North Korea had shot off some missiles. It was the first working day after the Fourth of July. I usually watch CNN [Cable News Network] all day in my office, and there was the CNN reporter saying, \"We're expecting the President to come into the briefing room any moment to brief the nation. His aide said he'll be here any moment.\"\n\nOur intern buzzes me and says, \"The President's on the phone for you.\" I said, \"Really?\" I was very surprised, mainly because CNN is saying \"any minute now,\" and I'm thinking, Okay, I guess he's going to ask me my thoughts on North Korea. So I get on the phone--I think Jeb [John Ellis Bush], Doro, and Neil [Bush] were all here--and he was curious about where everyone was staying. He said, \"So how was the Fourth of July weekend? What's going on up there? Who all is there? Where's everyone staying?\" So I went through where everyone was staying and he said, \"Okay, I've got to go.\" And literally 30 seconds later .?.?. It was just such a funny conversation.\n\nRight now, they all stay in the same place. That's where it gets sort of funny. If you come at the same time as one of your siblings and you both like to stay in the same house or the same bedroom, it's first come, first served.\n\nRiley\n\nBut they don't have--When I go home, I know where I'm going to stay, because in my parents' home--\n\nBecker\n\nNormally it is like that, unless all of them are here. The Bushes have given to Doro what's called the Bungalow, which is actually the house that President Bush grew up in. When his mother married Prescott Bush, her parents, who owned Walker's Point, built her a cottage as a wedding gift, on Walker's Point, and it's still up there. I'll walk you around the Point when we're done and give you a tour. They actually gave that to Doro a couple of years ago. That is now Doro's.\n\nThere's a little guesthouse right off the guesthouse, called the Wave, which is where Jeb and Colu [Columba Bush] and George and Laura [Bush] both like to stay. George and Laura also like to stay in the big house, so they'll alternate. Jeb and Colu really like the Wave. Marvin [Bush] and Margaret [Bush] usually stay in the big house or the Wandby. Neil and his clan always stay in the Wandby, which is a little guest cottage right off the parking lot over here. They like that because they have the most houseguests and it's a zoo. They have the youngest kids. The U.S. government built the Wandby.\n\nRiley\n\nThat was when President Bush was President?\n\nBecker\n\nWhen he became President, they decided they wanted the military aide and the doctor to stay on the Point, so they put in this--I don't know if it's a Sears, but it's one of those prefabbed houses. When he lost the election in 1992, they were going to tear it down. They were going to come in and dismantle it, and President Bush offered to buy it. He said, \"I would like to keep it, as we always need more beds here.\"\n\nHis then chief of staff, Rose Zamaria, was dealing with GSA [U.S. General Services Administration]. She found out how much it cost to build it, to say, \"We'll buy it at cost.\" Well, they tried to charge President Bush--some GSA person--I don't know how much more money than what it was built for. Their reason was, \"Look at the location.\" Rose said, \"We know, and President Bush owns the location. You can't charge him. You can't say, 'Look at that view.' It's his view.\" He loves that story. Some poor GSA person was trying to milk the former President. Anyway, he bought it and they turned it--\n\nRiley\n\nDid President [William J.] Clinton have to intervene on this?\n\nBecker\n\nNo. I think it was--I don't know. I wasn't chief of staff then. The story has become legend and probably has been embellished. Did Rose do an oral history?\n\nRiley\n\nNo.\n\nBecker\n\nRose is the one who dealt with it. President Bush loves telling that story. I don't know who--I think some more practical-minded person said, \"Yes, we can't charge for the location; it's at his property.\" So that's the other guest cottage.\n\nRiley\n\nYou were saying that there had been a PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] crew that had come through at one point. Has anybody gone through the house with the President, to talk with him about the--\n\nBecker\n\nNo. They have always kept the house off-limits. We've done a ton of interviews up there, but Mrs. Bush has always been very protective of Walker's Point.\n\nRiley\n\nWell, of course, sure.\n\nBecker\n\nSo there's never been the house tour. And even with the interviews, she's a little reluctant, just because she's kept it very private. Over the years, we have done a lot, but.?\n\nRiley\n\nWell, I don't know whether this would work or not. I'm just throwing out the idea and I'm not fishing to be involved in this at all. I'm interested for history's sake. At some point--It wouldn't even have to be a video camera--you could take a handheld recorder like this, and just ask Mrs. Bush if she would take an hour or so--\n\nBecker\n\nAnd talk about the house?\n\nRiley\n\nAnd walk through it from room to room and say where you are, what's there, and what experiences have happened there, and you could just put the darn thing in the library for 50 years if you wanted to.\n\nBecker\n\nIt's an incredible history, a lot of history.\n\nRiley\n\nIt is.\n\nBecker\n\nWhen we have groups here--One of the beauties of Walker's Point that different groups have definitely taken advantage of, at the Bushes' invitation of course--groups like MD Anderson, Points of Light, the Mayo Clinic, all these different groups we're involved in--We do a lot of what we call \"cultivation events,\" trying to get big donors interested.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nBecker\n\nPresident Bush has a wonderful, what I call \"dog-and-pony show.\" He begins all of those with the history of Walker's Point, and he's wonderful at it. We should at the very least get him--I'm sure that we have that tape somewhere.\n\nRiley\n\nYou really ought to.\n\nBecker\n\nHe actually did an oral history for the Kennebunk Historical Society. I need to find out what happened to that tape.\n\nRiley\n\nI think that that was the one for his dad. I think maybe there was a project on Prescott.\n\nBecker\n\nOn his dad? There was? I wasn't even aware of that.\n\nRiley\n\nI partly raise the issue because my colleague, Jim Young, has done an authorized project on [Edward M.] Ted Kennedy, and Jim did this. Jim used to go back and forth to--\n\nBecker\n\nTo Hyannis Port?\n\nRiley\n\nYes.\n\nBecker\n\nWhat a great idea.\n\nRiley\n\nHe actually went with Senator Kennedy through the Kennedy Compound, to get him to talk about things there. I don't know where the recording is and what the ground rules will be, but it just--\n\nBecker\n\nIt's part of history.\n\nRiley\n\nIt really is.\n\nBecker\n\nWalker's Point--I'm sort of making this up, but my guess is this was partially inspired by the [Lyndon B.] Johnson Ranch. The Johnson Ranch is now owned and controlled by the National Historical Preservation Society.\n\nRiley\n\nIs that right?\n\nBecker\n\nI think. I might be a little off.\n\nRiley\n\nIs it in the National Park Service?\n\nBecker\n\nI'm not sure of the answer to that. Maybe. But those people came to see us years ago. I had just become chief of staff, and this was before George W. was President. We had a great meeting with them. President Bush's lawyer was here and they basically said, \"If the family is ever going to sell this, we would like first rights.\" Again, this is way before W. They compared it to the Johnson Ranch. \"We would like an opportunity to talk to the family.\"\n\nWell, they're not going to sell. I don't think that is ever going to happen. But particularly after W. became President--a lot has happened here.\n\nRiley\n\nIt's as historic a residence as there is in the country. The property came into the possession of the family--?\n\nBecker\n\nIn the early 1900s. President Bush could tell you exactly when. Nineteen-0-something. It's like '02, '03, '04. We actually had a big 100th anniversary party when it was 100 years old. His grandfather, George Herbert Walker, from St. Louis, Missouri, is the one who bought it. His grandfather was the first owner. Then his oldest son, another George Herbert Walker [Jr.] but called Herbie Walker, bought the Point from his father's estate and he was the patriarch of the family at the time.\n\nWhen he died, his widow wanted to sell. A huge storm had just come through and the place was heavily damaged, and she wanted to sell. She did not want Walker's Point, and no one of 41's generation wanted to buy it--none of his siblings, none of his cousins, none of Herbie Walker's kids--for a couple of reasons. Most of them who loved Kennebunkport had a house here. George and Barbara Bush found--Do you see that gray house?\n\nRiley\n\nYes.\n\nBecker\n\nThey owned that house for about ten years.\n\nRiley\n\nThat's not the one with the planked up windows, is it?\n\nBecker\n\nNo, that's really sad. It's the one to the left of the planked up windows. I've been dying to know what's going on there.\n\nRiley\n\nI thought it was Secret Service.\n\nBecker\n\nNo. I wonder--it's very interesting. Anyway, various other family members owned houses here and no one wanted to buy it from her, so it was sort of a family crisis, and they were going to sell it. They had a buyer. I think it was Howard Johnson's.\n\nRiley\n\nThe hotel chain?\n\nBecker\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nNot to convert this into a Howard Johnson's?\n\nBecker\n\nYes. What happened was Dorothy Walker Bush, President Bush's mother--By that time, Prescott Bush had died. She owned the Bungalow, her house, because it was a wedding gift. And she wouldn't sell it. She said to Mary--I'm pretty sure her name was Mary Walker--\"Fine, you can sell the rest of Walker's Point, but I'm not selling.\" Well, that was a deal breaker, that she wouldn't sell her cottage. No one wanted to buy this place when you had a house right in the middle of it.\n\nTo resolve the family crisis, George and Barbara Bush bought it. They really did not want to buy it. I found all the paperwork on this when I was researching his letters book, All the Best. I didn't know any of this and I asked him about it and he said, \"No, we didn't want to buy it. We were living in Houston, Texas and we had a great house here.\" But anyway, it was sort of a family crisis, so they stepped up to the plate and bought it, and as President Bush would say, the rest is history. Life is weird, because right after he bought it--He bought it in '80, after he had dropped out of the race.\n\nRiley\n\nIs that right?\n\nBecker\n\nIt was in that time frame. And then he became Vice President of the United States. Anyway, it's amazing.\n\nRiley\n\nWell, the house itself--My guess is it's like a lot of properties; it's probably in really good shape now, and you're talking about a period of time when there had been damage to the house.\n\nBecker\n\nYes. The whole bottom floor was destroyed when he was President. It was totally wiped out.\n\nRiley\n\nOh, is that right?\n\nBecker\n\nDid you read the book or see the movie, The Perfect Storm?\n\nRiley\n\nYes, of course.\n\nBecker\n\nThat storm, Halloween 1991, the entire bottom floor of the big house was destroyed.\n\nRiley\n\nAlong with George Clooney's boat, right?\n\nBecker\n\nAlong with George Clooney's boat. They had to totally rebuild the bottom. There's video somewhere of the Atlantic Ocean breaking over the top of the house. Then the living room was destroyed just a couple of years ago. The big storm and a Nor'easter came up in April and blew open two glass doors in the living room and totally flooded it, and Mrs. Bush had to replace everything.\n\nRiley\n\nWell, that explains why you go back to Houston in October.\n\nBecker\n\nExactly. It's beautiful property, but like everyone who owns property on the ocean, with it comes--Every once in a while you're going to have a lot of maintenance or you're going to have to rebuild.\n\nRiley\n\nIs it insurable?\n\nBecker\n\nIt is, but it's like everything--I found this out with Hurricane Ike. Hurricane Ike damaged, of all things, my townhouse in Houston. I couldn't believe it. It rained so much that the water seeped in through the roof. It is insurable, but hurricane insurance like that is--They don't insure anything for 100 percent.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat about when you come here? Do you stay on the compound?\n\nBecker\n\nNo. I rent a house in town.\n\nRiley\n\nIn Kennebunkport?\n\nBecker\n\nI walk to work. For ten years, I've rented the guest cottage--You can't see it--of one of the big houses along Ocean Avenue. It's wonderful.\n\nRiley\n\nYou said you walk to work.\n\nBecker\n\nWhen it's nice. I walked this morning.\n\nRiley\n\nWhen is it nice?\n\nBecker\n\nI walked yesterday for the first time all year.\n\nRiley\n\nJust for the record, Jean and I were supposed to do this last week, and the weather all up and down the Eastern Seaboard made travel from Charlottesville impossible. Today is the second or third nice day.\n\nBecker\n\nThe second nice day.\n\nRiley\n\nDuring the summers is the weather normally good?\n\nBecker\n\nIt is normally spectacular, but we have had a couple of summers that were dreadful. Two summers ago, they set a record for cold and rain, blew every record out of the book. It was just a cold, rainy summer. There was another summer where it was foggy the whole summer. I had one staff person who I thought was going to go crazy. But usually July and August can be just gorgeous here. Nothing's air-conditioned, and you really don't need it. You may have one week of 90-degree weather and you think you're going to die, but about the time you think, Maybe I should go get an AC [air conditioner], it all goes away.\n\nRiley\n\nDo they travel when they're up here?\n\nBecker\n\nNot any more. Travel was less in the summertime, but President Bush would continue to travel, when he was still traveling a lot, but much less than when we're in Houston, mainly because the family's here. He would occasionally go do something that he really wanted to do, but we turned more down in the summer than we accepted. This is his time with his kids and grandkids, to fish and sort of recharge his batteries.\n\nRiley\n\nDo they ever go into town here?\n\nBecker\n\nOh, they go into town a lot.\n\nRiley\n\nTo eat, or to the hardware store?\n\nBecker\n\nThe other day they went to the Dollar Store. I've never been to the Dollar Store. They used to go to Walmart; now it's a Dollar Store. They go out to eat and they go to church.\n\nRiley\n\nDoes it create a big fuss?\n\nBecker\n\nNo. You know, in July and August more so, when a lot of tourists are here, but right now people are sort of used to them. People love seeing them. I would like to have gone to the Dollar Store with them. For the most part people are like, \"Hello, Mr. President.\"\n\nRiley\n\nYou said they both go, when they're going to the Dollar Store?\n\nBecker\n\nYes, they both went to the Dollar Store together the other day.\n\nRiley\n\nWere they shopping for anything in particular?\n\nBecker\n\nI don't know what they were--reading glasses.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right. I'm sure we'll come back to some of this, but let's turn the clock back. Tell me a little bit about your career. You were a journalist.\n\nBecker\n\nI was a journalist, yes.\n\nRiley\n\nTell me a little bit about your journalism career and then let's talk about you getting into the Bush network.\n\nBecker\n\nI was a newspaper reporter for ten years and my last paper was USA Today. I covered the 1988 campaign the year he was elected. I was on USA Today's political team. I was the feature writer, which was really fun. The first thing I did was great: USA Today did an \"At Home\" series with all the candidates. There were 15 that year and I went to all of their homes, with the exception of [Pierre] Pete DuPont and Bob Dole. I had to interview them elsewhere; they did not invite me over. Everybody else, I went to their homes and we did this \"At Home,\" before the Iowa Caucus began. It was a great gig. I loved it.\n\nRiley\n\nI have to interrupt and tell you that it's really interesting to me that you've said this because, coming the first time to Kennebunkport myself, I was walking around yesterday thinking, If you want to understand George Bush, you've got to come places. You've got to come here.\n\nBecker: You really do.\n\nRiley\n\nI remember going years ago to do an interview with Leon Panetta, and I read on the airplane--It was a horrible flight through Chicago--that Panetta, when he was a member of Congress, went home every weekend to his district.\n\nBecker\n\nWow.\n\nRiley\n\nWhich I thought was--\n\nBecker\n\nHe's from where?\n\nRiley\n\nMonterey.\n\nBecker\n\nI was going to say, isn't he from California?\n\nRiley\n\nHe's from California. So I'm thinking, This is crazy, until--You know, I take the cab to the hotel, I wake up the next day, I get out of the hotel and see what Monterey is like, and now I know.\n\nBecker\n\nThen you understood why.\n\nRiley\n\nForgive me for interrupting, but I think that going places--You went places.\n\nBecker\n\nI went to all their places. It was so much fun. I loved it. The DuPonts and the Doles were not comfortable with that. Bob Dole lived at Watergate. Anyway, it was interesting, it was fun, and I got to know all the candidates.\n\nIn the fall, USA Today talked Barbara Bush and [Katherine D.] Kitty Dukakis into doing a weekly campaign diary for us. It ran every Monday. I helped facilitate getting it set up, because by that time I'd gotten to know both of them. Very unhappily, I was then assigned to this project. I really didn't want to do it, but I was sort of their editor. I loved it, as it turned out.\n\nRiley\n\nFor the two women?\n\nBecker\n\nThe two women. I got to know both of them really well. They would have to turn their columns in to me every Sunday night, and they usually had to be cut. They were usually too long, and I would call--On the [Michael] Dukakis campaign, I dealt with Kitty's press secretary. I dealt with Mrs. Bush directly. She was very hands-on with this. Usually once a week I would catch up with them on the campaign trail somewhere and spend a flight with them, because in the beginning the columns were really bad. They were full of policy wonk stuff: \"This is how my husband feels about health care.\" I would call their press secretaries and say, \"No, that is not what we want. We want color.\" We wanted it to be behind the scenes of the campaign trail.\n\nThey both got really good at it, but to assure that they got it I would catch up with them toward the end of the week and have them tell me about their week and say, \"That's a great story,\" or, \"We don't want to hear that.\" Anyway, I got to know both women very well, and after the election was over, Barbara Bush's chief of staff offered me a job on her press staff. I was totally taken aback. I really didn't want to do it because I was really happy where I was.\n\nRiley\n\nThat's a big step for a journalist, right?\n\nBecker\n\nIt's a big step, it was going to be a pay cut, and I loved my job. After agonizing over it, it was my dad who said, \"What the hell are you thinking? What are you doing? You've been offered a job--Are you crazy?\" So I was her deputy press secretary at the White House.\n\nI went back to Houston in '92 to help her with her book, her memoirs, and I was going to leave after that. You're going to swear I'm making this up, but it's a true story: We're done with the book in March of '94, and I was getting ready to leave and go back to D.C. I was going to go back to my journalism career. President Bush's chief of staff, Rose Zamaria, retired, and he called me in and he said, \"I have no idea who to hire. I've got to figure this out. Barbara suggested that you might be willing to stay and help out for a while.\" I said, \"Sure. I don't know how to be a chief of staff,\" and I think he literally said, \"I just need a warm body.\"\n\nI agreed to do it until Labor Day, and we never talked about it again. We've never talked about it ever again. I guess he's still looking, Russell. I guess any day he might come in and say, \"Oh, Jean.?\" We were off and running and fell into a rhythm, and we just never talked about it.\n\nRiley\n\nI don't want to let you get away with not saying anything more about your experience with the First Lady's office. I'd like to hear more about your time there, because you clearly had--\n\nBecker\n\nYes, it was great.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd you were there for all four years?\n\nBecker\n\nAll four years, I was.\n\nRiley\n\nYou said you were the deputy press secretary.\n\nBecker\n\nI was one of two deputy press secretaries. Anna Perez was the Press Secretary. It was great. I traveled--There were two deputy press secretaries: Sondra Haley and myself. The First Lady did not have an advance office. Susan Porter Rose, as chief of staff, later hired a logistics coordinator, but our staff was pretty bare-bones. Sondra and I ended up almost becoming her advance people. We both did press stuff and we were the ones who would be sent out ahead, mainly to set up the press coverage, initially to set up the press coverage of the First Lady and to deal with the local press and figure out the press component. Because there was no advance person, no advance office, we turned into the advance people. I traveled almost 80 percent of the time for those four years.\n\nWhen she was not traveling, I was one of her backup speechwriters. I was probably the number-four speechwriter. Everybody else had to have pneumonia. And then I wrote all her speeches post-Presidency, which was really fun, when I was President Bush's chief of staff. It was unbelievable. She was really fun to work with.\n\nI remember the very first day at the White House, or the second or third day, she had a coffee for her staff and she said, \"I want to do something every single day that makes a difference.\" And so we did. Sometimes it was a big event, and sometimes it would be something with her husband, traveling. Sometimes she would host a coffee for teachers, for nurses, for caregivers. So sometimes it would be a little thing and sometimes it would be a really big thing, and some things would be spontaneous. It was a lot of fun.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me ask you--My memory on this is a little fuzzy and I haven't gone back to look at it, but my recollection is that she had a very low profile during the period when President Bush was Vice President.\n\nBecker\n\nShe did.\n\nRiley\n\nA lot of Americans had no idea who she was, what she looked like.\n\nBecker\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nDuring the Republican Convention, I remember hearing people say that there's a secret weapon that the American people don't know about, which is Barbara Bush.\n\nBecker\n\nRight, because they fell in love with her.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you talk a little bit about moving from the low profile to--\n\nBecker\n\nWell, I think her low profile was by design. Most Vice Presidents' wives have pretty low profiles though. I know she definitely felt she should, because Nancy Reagan was First Lady. It's when she got started in literacy--I wasn't there then, so this isn't an eyewitness report but I'm pretty sure this is right. It's when she started her literacy project that she became very well known, certainly in literacy circles in this country. Outside of the literacy circles, you're absolutely right, she would not be well known. And she traveled with him. She went on almost all his foreign trips and he set a record for foreign travel. There was the famous line Jim Baker said, \"You die, I fly,\" because he went to so many funerals.\n\nAs a reporter covering the '88 convention--I remember this really well. She burst onto the national scene. Her speech brought the house down. And there was this wonderful cover of her on TIME magazine--I actually have it framed, hanging in my office--after the election. It's a beautiful picture of her and says, \"The Silver Fox,\" which was President Bush's nickname for her. She rose to instant stardom, because she was funny and down to earth, had a very quick wit. People just love her. She was a very popular First Lady.\n\nRiley\n\nYou said that they traveled together a lot. Tell me a little bit about the relationship between the two people and the extent to which they're reliant on one another, or maybe how they complement one another. How are they different and how are they alike?\n\nBecker\n\nOh, my gosh. I have felt for years that one of the great, untold stories about George and Barbara Bush is their love story. They are just amazing. They've been married now 66 years, the longest of any President and First Lady. I did some research on that when they celebrated their 65th. I figured they would be the longest because they got married when they were 19 and 20. Jimmy [Carter] and Rosalynn [Carter] are behind them by about five years, I think.\n\nRiley\n\nIs that right?\n\nBecker\n\nI think so. They're next. They're just great partners and they're at such a good time of their life now. I love how much they enjoy each other's company, whether it's watching TV or reading. He likes when she goes with him. They're sort of yin and yang.\n\nRiley\n\nA good sense of humor for both of them?\n\nBecker\n\nThey both have great senses of humor.\n\nRiley\n\nIs it the same kind of humor?\n\nBecker\n\nNo. Mrs. Bush is the queen of the quips, and President Bush has a very subtle, dry humor. He loves to tease her. This is such a silly thing to tell you: It was post-Presidency but it was a long time ago. We were working on her book, so it was 1993 or '94. We were in a room together at the house, going over the book, and she heard him come in and she went over to a mirror and pinched her cheeks. I just loved that, Russell. By that time, they'd been married 50 years, I think. And we were here. Everybody's very casual here. President Bush looks like a homeless person most of the time here. I don't even think she knew she did it. It was just instinct, that she just went and pinched her cheeks and sort of did that.\n\nRiley\n\nFussed with her hair?\n\nBecker\n\nOh, my God, every married couple should be like that.\n\nRiley\n\nExactly.\n\nBecker\n\nIt was really cute. Theirs is a great love story. When one of them is sick, the other one is just--and they both have had some major health issues in the last five years. There's this wonderful press conference of President Bush--The Today Show did a really nice piece after this. Mrs. Bush had open heart surgery a couple of years ago and the press was just going wild, so I talked President Bush into doing a press conference with her doctors at Methodist in Houston. I just wanted to get the press off my back. This was all about me. I said, \"Please go out there and talk to them--please, oh please, oh please--so they'll quit calling me.\" Oh, my God, he sobbed through the whole thing and I felt so bad that I had asked him to do it. Really, it was so sweet and the Today Show did a really nice thing about their love story and how sweet it is. They're pretty cute together.\n\nRiley\n\nThere's the piece of conventional wisdom that the younger President Bush, 43, is more like his mom than his dad. Do you think that's the truth?\n\nBecker\n\nI think that's true, yes. He's a little more like his mother than his dad. The same kind of sense of humor, definitely.\n\nRiley\n\nThe same kind of sense of humor. Anything else, in terms of traits or outlook on life or anything?\n\nBecker\n\nNo, he's an interesting combination of both his parents, like most kids are, but his sense of humor is definitely, dominantly, his mother.\n\nRiley\n\nSo you had the experience of working in the First Lady's office. Ninety-two must have been a disappointing year.\n\nBecker\n\nYes, it was. It was hard, really hard. I knew, in the fall of '92, that President Bush was going to lose, because it seemed that everywhere I went with the First Lady, the then-Governor Clinton had just been, or he was coming. You could just feel it coming. It was a very tough year. And going to the White House the day after the election was hard because they immediately started treating us like short-termers.\n\nRiley\n\n\"They\" being the staff or the press?\n\nBecker\n\nNo. The day after the election, every time we left the White House, the Secret Service started searching our bags, to make sure we weren't stealing things. I guess there had been a President in the past, after an election, where the staff would start carrying stuff home. It was really odd. You had to open your bag, and they would be so apologetic. The guys just felt horrible. You just immediately go into transition.\n\nThe President and First Lady came back from Houston and there was a big welcome home on the White House lawn. I just can't imagine going through that if I were he. The entire White House was very morose. Then President Bush's mother died right after the election.\n\nRiley\n\nI had forgotten that.\n\nBecker\n\nYes. She died within a month of his losing the election, which was really hard for him. I'm trying to remember if the Christmas decorations were up yet. I don't think so. I think we were still in November. We get this message one day that the President wants the entire White House staff in the East Room, because he has an announcement to make. Everybody was just, Oh, my God. The rumor was that he was going to resign early because he felt the country would be better off if he just got out. That makes no sense. It's the dumbest rumor ever, but at the time we were like, Oh, my God. So we go to the East Room. Do you know what I'm about ready to tell you?\n\nRiley\n\nNo.\n\nBecker\n\nOf course the East Wing--We were just stunned to be invited. It's like, Oh, my God, even the East Wing. We all crowded into the East Room and everyone's really nervous. There's the typical announcement, \"Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America.\" And out walks Dana Carvey. He had called Dana Carvey. Dana Carvey is just hilarious. We've become great friends with him. Dana's hilarious, talking about this. President Bush decided--He could feel that people were just beyond sad, and he took it upon himself to break the tension, and he called Dana Carvey. Dana says when the White House Operator called him and said, \"I have the President of the United States on the phone,\" he thought it was a joke; he thought it was one of his friends playing a joke on him. Anyway, the President called him himself and said, \"Dana, I need a favor.\" And so Dana Carvey came. Oh, my gosh, he came out and started doing President Bush, and then President Bush came out and joined him, and they did it together. It was unbelievable, and that did it.\n\nRiley\n\nIt got you through.\n\nBecker\n\nYes. It's like everyone just got over their bad self.\n\nRiley\n\nHad he taken--I don't even know how to phrase the question. I can't imagine he was terrifically happy with Carvey up until that point.\n\nBecker\n\nLet me just say for the record, I did not know him at the White House.\n\nRiley\n\nBeing the President.\n\nBecker\n\nI did not know the President at all. No, I was way too low level.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nBecker\n\nI encountered him a couple of times but just in passing. I did not know him. If you had asked him about \"Jean Becker in your wife's press office,\" he'd be like, \"Huh?\"\n\nRiley\n\nGotcha, okay.\n\nBecker\n\nWhat President Bush says about Dana Carvey is--I think he was a fan. He felt he never crossed the line. He thought he was funny. He thought he never, ever, crossed the line of being inappropriate. A couple of years ago Dana Carvey came to Houston to do a charitable thing and we reached out to him. We knew he was coming, and President Bush did a drop-by at the charity event. Dana knew we were coming. I went. It was before dinner. Oh, my gosh, that charity--It was for a Boys and Girls Club thing. They should have gone around the room and made everybody give another thousand dollars, because it was just unbelievable. I don't think we have it on tape. I was standing at the back of the room, and waiters were putting down their trays so they could clap. Dana comes out and starts doing his shtick and then you hear this voice of God say, \"Now wait one minute.\" Of course in Houston, in particular, everyone immediately recognized 41's voice. He has that distinctive, reedy voice.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nBecker\n\nHe walked out and the place just went wild. They were very funny together.\n\nRiley\n\nWhen did the President go on Saturday Night Live? Was that after he had left office?\n\nBecker\n\nThat was after--right. I was his chief of staff by then, which means that it had to be '94 or later. That was really fun.\n\nRiley\n\nHow did that work?\n\nBecker\n\nWell, they wanted him to come to New York to do it live, and he did not want to do that. He couldn't imagine being up at 11:30 at night, for one thing. So he taped it, and you know who came to Houston to tape it with him was Al Franken.\n\nRiley\n\nNo kidding?\n\nBecker\n\nNow Senator Franken.\n\nRiley\n\nHe was one of the writers?\n\nBecker\n\nHe was one of the writers.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay, so they wrote the script.\n\nBecker\n\nThey wrote the script. And what they did--\n\nRiley\n\nThey submit that to you for approval?\n\nBecker\n\nYes, they did. We actually shot it in the library. There's a place in the library where we have a continuous loop of--We call it our blooper tape. It's really just funny things and that's part of it. Dana's hosting Saturday Night Live. He's gone from the show by then so he's the host this particular night, and he comes out and it's sort of the same thing they've done now live a couple of times. He starts doing his George Bush shtick, and then they go to the video of President Bush saying, \"Now wait one minute, Dana.\" The crowd just died laughing.\n\nRiley\n\nI think I was watching it live.\n\nBecker\n\nIt was so funny. It was really, really funny. I wish he'd gone, because I think he would have been really good, but he just had no interest of going to be on Saturday Night Live, even for Dana. But he did do the tape for him.\n\nRiley\n\nAfter you leave office, then you become--There was one other question I wanted to ask you about that period. You knew Mrs. Bush really well.\n\nBecker\n\nReally well.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat are the difficulties of being a loving spouse and a First Lady in a brutal campaign season? I would think that serving as a First Lady in any circumstance would sometimes be difficult, because the arrows are always incoming. I can remember reading the material on President Bush, saying that it was in many ways more difficult for him when the arrows were being shot at his son than they were coming into him.\n\nBecker\n\nAbsolutely. You know, having traveled with Mrs. Bush in the whole fall of '92, what amazed me was--Of course the President's the same way, but I'll just talk about her, since I was with her--how you have to go out every single day and smile and shake hands and be up; whereas, for most people going through something like that, the inclination is to stay home and pull the covers over your head.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nBecker\n\nYou just want to lock the doors and turn off TV and eat ice cream and watch junk television.\n\nRiley\n\nOr come to Walker's Point and watch the waves roll in.\n\nBecker\n\nRight, that's everyone's--I don't know about you, but when I have a really bad day at work, I love it when I can go home and just veg out and watch a Law & Order marathon. You don't have that option when you're President and First Lady. You have to constantly keep going out there, and that's the thing that I'm still in awe of with them. You just dig deep and you get out there and you carry on.\n\nDespite the fact that I work for a very public family, I would hate to be a celebrity. That is one of the things I will take away from this job: I would hate to be famous. I'm always amazed at these people who desperately seek fame. I'm like, Really? I do think it's part of your makeup. But particularly when you're going through something like 1992, the ability to pretend with every single person they meet, that, \"I'm just thrilled to meet you. I'm just thrilled to be here.\" I do think they believe it sometimes. It energizes them.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you ever sense from Mrs. Bush any frustration with the support network with her husband?\n\nBecker\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nIn the interviews, frankly, we get a fair number of people--I want to be clear: It's not people directing criticism at others; it's people being self-critical, saying, \"We served the President terribly in 1992.\"\n\nBecker\n\nI know there's a lot of angst over that. But no, I don't ever remember her talking about it. I would say her angst was all directed at Ross Perot, much more so than Bill Clinton. The Bushes are very pragmatic when it comes to politics, and people who are so surprised by their friendship with President Clinton--Honestly, this group in Washington could take a page out of their playbook, that politics shouldn't be personal; it should be about the issues. What Bill and Hillary Clinton were doing was what they were supposed to be doing; they're running for President. Mrs. Bush's angst was directed at Ross Perot, and most Bush people would tell you that 41 very likely would have won the election in 1992 if Perot had not been running.\n\nRiley\n\nI agree with them.\n\nBecker\n\nYou never know, but assuming--Anyway, I do remember a lot of Perot angst, but angst directed at the 41 team? No, not at all.\n\nRiley\n\nHad they known the Perots?\n\nBecker\n\nOh, yes. Ross Perot offered him a job. Has anyone told you--? President Bush thinks he knows how he got off on the wrong foot with Ross Perot.\n\nRiley\n\nI'm not sure whether I heard it or not.\n\nBecker\n\nDo you know the story?\n\nRiley\n\nNo, tell the story.\n\nBecker\n\nThey knew the Perots well in Texas, and Ross Perot offered him a job, probably after CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], because when he left the CIA, they moved back to Houston for the first time in a long time, permanently, and Perot offered him a job, which he turned down. He didn't have any interest in doing that. But he felt they were still on very good terms.\n\nWhen [Ronald] Reagan was President, Ross Perot got very involved in the whole POW/MIA [prisoner of war/missing in action] issue in Vietnam. I'm just telling you this from memory, but this is 99 percent. I might get one little thing wrong. The Reagan administration felt that he was not helping. They felt they were making huge progress on the issue with Vietnam, behind the scenes, quietly, and they never thought there were POWs there. No one thought that. Ross Perot did. But there were a lot of MIA issues, and they wanted to recover bodies.\n\nRoss Perot was trying to send missions into Vietnam to recover people, and the Reagan administration wanted him to stop, because it was, they felt, insane. They were in a meeting talking about this, and the Vice President said, \"I will talk to him. I know him well. He's a friend. I'll do this.\" President Bush said that was it. He was livid. President Bush said, \"I think that was the turning point.\" He personally and viscerally hated him after that. That's his theory.\n\nRiley\n\nI've heard this, but I'm not sure through what channels they were.\n\nBecker\n\nWell, this is secondhand. This is what President Bush told me in a conversation. Again, who knows? But I don't remember him ever complaining.\n\nRiley\n\nYou used the word \"angst.\" They were angry with him for the challenge?\n\nBecker\n\nI think they knew that his presence in the race--[Albert, Jr.] Al Gore could probably say the same thing about Ralph Nader in 2000, although the percentage of vote he got was miniscule. The race was miniscule.\n\nRiley\n\nIt was enough. Exactly.\n\nBecker\n\nIt was just like, Why is he doing this? He's not going to win. Quite frankly, I never understood the Bushes' continued friendship with Larry King after that, because Ross Perot was a creation of Larry King. His entire campaign was on the Larry King Show. He was on Larry King at least two or three times a month.\n\nRiley\n\nDid he announce he was going to run?\n\nBecker\n\nYes, my gosh.\n\nRiley\n\nThen he announced he wouldn't run.\n\nBecker\n\nHonestly, I don't remember this. I was traveling so much myself. I don't even know how much campaigning he did. I think he mainly went on the Larry King Show.\n\nRiley\n\nWhich was enough.\n\nBecker\n\nWhich was enough, yes. I don't remember her ever expressing anger at the campaign. She was an absolute tireless campaigner. I spent the entire fall in Pennsylvania and Ohio. I mean, once in a while I would go somewhere else, but I almost lived in Pennsylvania and Ohio in September and October.\n\nRiley\n\nBut Mrs. Bush was elsewhere.\n\nBecker\n\nShe was all over the country.\n\nRiley\n\nSo they left you behind to do this. You were on a leave of absence--\n\nBecker\n\nI didn't travel with her. I would see her probably three or four times a week, but she would leave me and go somewhere else, and I would go probably to two--We hired two extra people that year. I probably saw her every fourth or fifth campaign stop.\n\nRiley\n\nShe was coming into the states that you were working in?\n\nBecker\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd you were on a leave of absence from the White House at that time?\n\nBecker\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nWe come to January of '93 and the new President is inaugurated. At that point do you go to work for Mrs. Bush on the book?\n\nBecker\n\nOn the book, right. I went to Houston. She asked me to come to Houston to help her on her book, and I said yes, I would be happy to do that.\n\nRiley\n\nSo you went to Houston.\n\nBecker\n\nRight. It took us about a year. She wrote the book.\n\nRiley\n\nHow was the decompression from the White House? Was it sadness or relief?\n\nBecker\n\nNo, no. Sadness? President Bush is amazing. He came to the office every day. I was slowly beginning to know him. I sat at a card table in his kitchen, so I mainly got to know him when he would come make his coffee.\n\nRiley\n\nThat's where your office was?\n\nBecker\n\nYes, I did not have an office. I was sort of a stepchild in the office, so they set up a little card table in his kitchen.\n\nRiley\n\nAt the office, or in the residence?\n\nBecker\n\nAt the office in Houston. It was tough. I'll never forget--His dog Ranger died of cancer some time that winter of '93.\n\nRiley\n\nOh, gosh.\n\nBecker\n\nAnd then--this had to be that summer--his boat crashed on the rocks up here during a big storm. It broke off his mooring. It would have been moored right here, and it broke off in a big storm.\n\nRiley\n\nIs that his boat that's out the window?\n\nBecker\n\nThat's his boat, yes. That's Fidelity V, which he took out yesterday. It was after the boat crashed on the rocks and we were up here, he said to me, \"I lost the election, my mother died, my dog died, and my boat crashed. There's not much else left that can happen to me this year.\"\n\nYou could watch them going through trying to figure out life, just trying to figure out a new rhythm. It was hard, you know, trying to figure out, What am I going to do? I think that whole first year was a journey of trying to figure out what to do. They began to build the library, and he started giving speeches, but he really didn't get involved in too much until about the time I became chief of staff.\n\nRiley\n\nWhich was again?\n\nBecker\n\nMarch of '94.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat personal reserves does the man draw on as he's trying to deal with all of these things?\n\nBecker\n\nI told him once that when he died, we should dissect him and try to figure out what makes him tick. I don't know, Russell. It's faith, definitely faith for them, and just unbelievable strength. I don't know where that comes from. I think it comes from a life's worth of experiences. I do know that President Bush has talked about it in the past, how all sorts of things get you ready for something like that: certainly World War II, certainly Robin [Pauline Robinson Bush] dying. The hugest--he basically got fired by the American people, and you have no choice but to carry on and you just do.\n\nRiley\n\nYou mentioned faith. He's not somebody who wears his faith on his sleeve.\n\nBecker\n\nWell, I love that they call Episcopalians \"the frozen chosen.\" I love that term. But absolutely, their faith is so strong. I remember, a day or two after the election, or the day they got back--they were in Houston on election night--Barbara Bush had a coffee for her staff. She said, \"Okay, this is what we need to accomplish before we leave.\" They just move on. Again, I wasn't there with him, but from what I've heard, he was the same way. \"Here's our to-do list. We're going to do an orderly and honorable transition.\" We were all under orders to do everything we could for the Clinton people, and we spent hours--even I spent hours with Hillary's incoming staff. The President said, \"Do everything. Go out of your way.\"\n\nYou know, they're just so goal-oriented. You don't wallow. I've learned so much about handling life from being around them. The 2000 election, and to some extent during 2004--I'm jumping ahead a little bit--was really hard for President Bush. He would sit in my office and agonize over what Al Gore was saying or what John Kerry was saying and what the polls were saying. He even shed a tear a couple of times. He was so stressed out and worried and anxious. But that would last about five minutes and then it's done. He's really good at compartmentalizing. He would get it out and maybe even cry, and then it's like, \"Do you want to go on the boat for lunch?\" I love that. You don't wallow. They're not wallowers. You just move on. It might be a generational thing.\n\nRiley\n\nMaybe.\n\nBecker\n\nI think the baby boomers wallow a little more. Are you a baby boomer? How old are you?\n\nRiley\n\nI'm right at the tail end.\n\nBecker\n\nI bet you're right at the line. What year were you born?\n\nRiley\n\nFifty-eight.\n\nBecker\n\nOh yes, you're a baby boomer.\n\nRiley\n\nThen my wife's at the tail end of it.\n\nBecker\n\nYes, you are. We're wallowers.\n\nRiley\n\nI wallow; it's true. Certainly I don't have the experience that he had in World War II.\n\nBecker\n\nI think all that helps. It builds character.\n\nRiley\n\nYes, I think so. You mentioned Robin. Does he talk about Robin still?\n\nBecker\n\nRobin will come up sporadically. They've had this huge involvement with cancer, post-Presidency, and certainly Robin's been a big part of that. I talked President Bush into--This crew in California has done a documentary about him that we saw for the first time last week. I'm not sure this documentary will ever see the light of day. It's wonderful; it's fabulous. They did an outstanding job.\n\nRiley\n\nIt's done by or for whom, the documentary?\n\nBecker\n\nIt's this independent filmmaker we met.\n\nRiley\n\nA filmmaker, okay, so it's not PBS.\n\nBecker\n\nNo. He's an independent filmmaker we met through a project he was doing about the Apollo space missions, and he decided he wanted his next subject to be President Bush, and I talked President Bush into cooperating. I can't believe I talked him into that. They're done and we saw it last week, and they're now going to try to sell it. I just don't know if there's a market for a documentary on a former President, though, in this country.\n\nRiley\n\nI suspect there is.\n\nBecker\n\nI hope so.\n\nRiley\n\nIt depends on which market. I mean the History channel or somebody.\n\nBecker\n\nI know, but they have bigger ideas than that. I think they're pie in the sky. Anyway, there was a lot about Robin in that documentary and, oh my God, he just cried through the whole thing.\n\nRiley\n\nTwo points on that: One is the gravesite in Texas. When you first encounter that, it is moving.\n\nBecker\n\nThey moved her, once her gravesite was complete. She was buried next to his parents in Greenwich. That's where she was buried, and then when their gravesite was completed, they had her moved to Texas.\n\nRiley\n\nWere you around for the discussions about that?\n\nBecker\n\nI was. It was sort of automatic. It wasn't a big decision. They just said, \"We need to move Robin.\"\n\nRiley\n\nBut there was a decision that they were going to be buried.\n\nBecker\n\nThat was a huge discussion. I was around for that, because they actually thought about being buried here.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course.\n\nBecker\n\nThey actually own two burial plots here, at the church cemetery here in town.\n\nRiley\n\nThere's a stone church?\n\nBecker\n\nSaint Ann's down here, which you went right by.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nBecker\n\nThere's no cemetery there. That's their summer church.\n\nRiley\n\nThen there's a congregational church in town.\n\nBecker\n\nRight, which they go to in the spring and fall. Saint Ann's is only open from June until Labor Day.\n\nRiley\n\nThe inn that I'm staying at--\n\nBecker\n\nKennebunkport Inn.\n\nRiley\n\nI guess it is right next to--\n\nBecker\n\nNo, that is not the church they go to. That is a little ways out of town. It's a little further out.\n\nRiley\n\nIn this direction?\n\nBecker\n\nNo. You would not have come in on that road. It would be like if you went to Portland.\n\nRiley\n\nIn any event, they have two plots there.\n\nBecker\n\nRight. I think they have sold them now, but they were thinking about being buried here, and what changed their minds was Richard Nixon's funeral. They went to Richard Nixon's funeral and it was after that funeral that we had a huge discussion about it.\n\nRiley\n\nNixon's funeral was in--?\n\nBecker\n\nIt was at his library, and he was buried right there, and that sort of made an impression on them. I definitely was an advocate for their being buried at the library, too, because I've been to a lot of Presidential gravesites and it leaves an impression upon you. I just felt that is where--and I also thought they should be buried in Texas. At the end of the day, they decided, \"You're absolutely right; we need to be buried in Texas.\" As much as they love it here, most of their life was in Texas, and so they decided to be buried there.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd the spot itself had been designated, once you were through negotiating that was a place where you thought that they would go?\n\nBecker\n\nThey picked that spot out, I think. I call it \"over the river and through the woods,\" because you walk, and there's a little creek.\n\nRiley\n\nYou don't know that it's there.\n\nBecker\n\nYou don't know that it's there.\n\nRiley\n\nWhen I made my first trip there--I think it was to go to a conference at the Bush School, for something completely apart from it, and I was out stretching my legs one day--\n\nBecker\n\nAnd you just came across it.\n\nRiley\n\nI came across it and it took my breath away.\n\nBecker\n\nYes. Because it's just there, waiting. When they're buried there, there will be a sign at the library, directing people there. Years ago, President Bush--It's amazing to me how much work goes into these Presidential funerals. That whole bottom drawer is my funeral file. Even the media. The media already can tell you who the pool cameras will be when he dies, because they take turns. They've already decided who is the pool for the different venues for his funeral.\n\nFox News is the pool for the gravesite. They called and they wanted to come and do a walkthrough. They just wanted to get ready ahead of time. I was telling President Bush and I said, \"This is sort of curious: Fox wants to do a walkthrough of your gravesite today.\" He said, \"What would you pay me if I went and laid on top? Wouldn't that be funny if they got out there and I'm lying there on the ground?\" I said, \"I don't think so.\" Of course for the funeral, the military team practice all the time, every time a new hierarchy comes in, so they always notify me when they're going to be doing a drill.\n\nAbout five years ago, they were going to practice at Saint Martin's in Houston. He'll lie in state at Saint Martin's during the night, and they were going to practice that, and President Bush said, \"Should we go and sit in the back of the church? Wouldn't it be sort of fun?\" I said, \"No, we're not going to go.\"\n\nRiley\n\nI guess this gallows humor must be--what?\n\nBecker\n\nHe's just so comfortable with it. He's just really comfortable with it. We talk about his funeral, not a lot, but we've worked on it a lot, and I actually hope to finish it this summer. I have lots of nuts and bolts.\n\nRiley\n\nFinish it? Careful, watch your language.\n\nBecker\n\nThe planning of it, because the big--I want to finish the nuts and bolts.\n\nRiley\n\nSo that's your big project.\n\nBecker\n\nIt is, every time I think about it. The plan's in place but here's the kind of stuff I have to do. Boy, I get why you have to do it, because once it happens, you don't have time for anything. I have to manifest Air Force One, who gets on that plane.\n\nRiley\n\nWho gets on the plane, and that changes, right?\n\nBecker\n\nIt's a big problem because his family is so big. I already know I don't have enough seats for everybody. I have to seat the National Cathedral, which is just going to be a nightmare, really a nightmare. And I've walked through it.\n\nRiley\n\nSo you know how many seats you've got.\n\nBecker\n\nI know exactly how many seats I have.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd you've got to have everybody in a specific seat, or do you just have numbers?\n\nBecker\n\nIt's up to me, but we don't have room for everybody there, either, because all of Congress gets invited, the entire Diplomatic Corps gets invited. We just have to figure this out. I need to seat it, to figure out how much space I have. It's just that this family is so big.\n\nRiley\n\nWhen did you begin planning this?\n\nBecker\n\nI began in earnest probably five years ago. You sort of piddle at it. They all come meet with the President and First Lady, and they do that when they're still--there's a person in charge of military funerals who's connected with the Pentagon. When you're President, they want you to have a plan. About once every five years they would show up. Now they want me and Jimmy Carter to be done. \"You need to finish this, Jean.\" I get the emails from a very nice man named Mike Wagner. Because once it happens--\n\nRiley\n\nYou've got no time to think.\n\nBecker\n\nYou don't have any time to think. You just have to execute. There's no time to plan; you just have to execute.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd you're dealing with grief also.\n\nBecker\n\nThat's right. I carry, on the back of my driver's license, Mike Wagner's phone number, his assistant's phone number, because Mike says you probably have one hour, from the minute he dies until the press finds out, and you've just got to make the most of that hour to try to notify the people you want notified. You don't have time, so I carry his numbers with me everywhere.\n\nRiley\n\nIs there a press person on site here all the time?\n\nBecker\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nSo you're off the radar now, off the immediate radar.\n\nBecker\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nBut once the notices are issued--I'm not going to ask you to reveal particulars of this, but would you call the family first, and then the President, or is there a phone tree?\n\nBecker\n\nI'd call Mike Wagner first.\n\nRiley\n\nYou'd call Mike Wagner first?\n\nBecker\n\nAbsolutely. Everything is based on assuming Mrs. Bush is alive and assuming that I am with her. I probably would call Mike Wagner first, believe it or not. Then, depending on what she wants me to do--Is she going to call the five kids or does she want me to call the five kids? As of right now, she will call the five kids. I would call Mike Wagner and then I'd call Jim McGrath, who is President Bush's speechwriter and our press person. Jim is really a huge part of my plan.\n\nRiley\n\nThen he does the public notice?\n\nBecker\n\nAnd then we have a phone tree. Yes, he does the public notice. And then I call one member of our staff, who then calls everybody else. It's like a phone tree.\n\nRiley\n\nIn doing this, is there a template that you--I'm guessing Mike Wagner has done this before.\n\nBecker\n\nThere's a template.\n\nRiley\n\nHave you had conversations with President Carter's staff about comparing notes?\n\nBecker\n\nNo. I have talked to President [Gerald R.] Ford's and President Reagan's Chief of Staff, after the fact, and they have been enormously helpful. Like most things, they're mainly helpful on what didn't work: \"Here's what we would do differently.\" They both kindly wrote voluminous emails, memos for me.\n\nRiley\n\nAfter it was over.\n\nBecker\n\nYes, after it was over, which has all been very helpful. And Mike is extremely helpful. He runs it, but there are certain things I have to do that he can't do, decisions to be made.\n\nRiley\n\nI see. We've sort of gotten off on this.\n\nBecker\n\nYes, we totally got off on this.\n\nRiley\n\nWell, that's fine.\n\nBecker\n\nI don't remember what we were talking about.\n\nRiley\n\nI do, fortunately. That's a skill that I've had to develop over time--figuring out when we're chasing rabbits and when to go back. We never really dealt much with your working with Mrs. Bush on her book, and that merits some--You're okay to continue?\n\nBecker\n\nSure.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right. We left you at the kitchen table.\n\nBecker\n\nI got to Houston about a month after they did. I needed time to pack up in D.C. and move to Houston and all that. When I got to Houston, she was hilarious. She was waking up every morning and just writing what she felt about. She would have a chapter, or sometimes more of an essay than a chapter--I remember one of them was about Sam Donaldson; it was that random. I can't remember what the others were about, but I know one was about Sam Donaldson.\n\nRiley\n\nShe didn't have a thing for Sam Donaldson, I'm thinking.\n\nBecker\n\nNo. So the editor in New York, Lisa Drew, was absolutely panicked, and Lisa told me the first thing I needed to do was to bring structure to this project. I had never done a book, either, but I did an outline for her and we wrote it chronologically. I said, \"You can get up and write what you feel like, absolutely. If you feel inspired to write about San Donaldson, write it down, but you need to start at the beginning.\" She was a big diary-keeper her whole life.\n\nRiley\n\nNo kidding.\n\nBecker\n\nShe kept a diary her whole life. She actually gave me the diaries, and my job was to read the diaries. She was reading them too, but she let me read them and pull out what I thought we needed for the book. That was my first job, to start reading her diaries, which was really overwhelming.\n\nRiley\n\nOverwhelming because of the volume or because of what you're finding out about the person?\n\nBecker\n\nThe volume. Both, probably. Her diaries are wonderful.\n\nRiley\n\nHow far did they go back?\n\nBecker\n\nReligiously, starting with when they lived in China.\n\nRiley\n\nSo it's at the time when they're trying to have a public life.\n\nBecker\n\nA public life. There was some earlier stuff but it was pretty sporadic and tended to be more about baseball games and PTA [Parent Teacher Association]. They reminded me of my mom's diaries: not much color or insight, just sort of, \"Went to the kids' baseball games; they lost. Came home, did a little laundry, went to bed.\" That kind of stuff. But starting with China, she wrote voluminously almost every day. I think she started in China for that reason, because it was such an unbelievable experience. So I read the diaries.\n\nRiley\n\nOne other interruption: You're a journalist, somebody who's trained to observe and account. Did you find that she had a good eye for what she was doing?\n\nBecker\n\nAn unbelievable eye. She's a great writer. They're both really good writers. Both of the Bushes are great writers. A very good eye, and she would say absolutely everything in her diary. Her diaries will be open to the public 50 years after she dies, and there's a reason for that.\n\nRiley\n\nI'm sure. I'm disappointed I won't be able to see them.\n\nBecker\n\nI know. His diaries, we have already turned over to Jon Meacham. He only kept a diary V.P. and White House, very sporadic. They're wonderful though, wonderful. We've given them to Jon Meacham, who's doing his biography. Also, we'll do a book just on the diaries that will be published after he dies.\n\nSo my job was to read them and pull out sections that I felt would be great for the book. Sometimes we would literally just republish what she wrote at the time, and others we would use for inspiration. We need to write about this incident. I would copy or mark in the diary what I wanted her to see, and she would do the writing and after she wrote a chapter, I would edit it. I was her editor, which was very interesting. I did both of her books.\n\nRiley\n\nHow so?\n\nBecker\n\nWell, it's tough to edit your boss. We would spend hours arguing, particularly on the second one. The second one was actually harder but my USA Today training came in really well. Lisa Drew, our editor in New York, gave us sort of a framework for the chapters. She didn't want any more than, I'm going to say 40 double-spaced pages, and Barbara Bush would sometimes give me 80, so it was my job to go through and tell her, \"I think we can cut this, this, and this.\" \"This was actually in chapter two. This is repetitive.\" \"This isn't interesting.\" I edited behind her and did all the footnotes. I was the footnoter and fact-checker. I learned to hate footnotes. I'm the one who would initially--I learned a lot. In the beginning, Lisa would send it back marked up: \"You need to footnote this, you need to footnote this, you need to footnote this.\" Eventually, I caught on to what had to be footnoted, explaining people, places, or events in a footnote.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nBecker\n\nI had never footnoted in my life. Newspaper reporters don't footnote, but I actually became quite good at it. I hate them. Anyway, that's what I did.\n\nRiley\n\nWell, as scholars, we live by footnotes. So you do that, and then she's happy with the end product?\n\nBecker\n\nYes, and it was a huge bestseller. We finally got it done and knew the book by heart, and then she did a sequel ten years later and I did the same thing with that book, except I was her husband's chief of staff at the time. That was really hard. I was really busy during that time period.\n\nRiley\n\nBecause the workload was so great?\n\nBecker\n\nOh, my God, yes. That was really tough.\n\nRiley\n\nYou said that you finished the book in--\n\nBecker\n\nIn a year. In '94. I don't know why I remember this, but we turned it in by March 1, 1994. It took us exactly one year. I took two weeks off and came back and started being his acting chief of staff.\n\nRiley\n\nWhen you were writing the book, did you go back and read other First Lady's memoirs or Presidential memoirs?\n\nBecker\n\nI did, yes.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you find any of them particularly helpful, where you think, Oh, this is great?\n\nBecker\n\nI don't remember, but I read Nancy Reagan's and I read Betty Ford's. I can't remember, I think that's maybe it.\n\nRiley\n\nDuring this period of time, President Bush was keeping a pretty low profile.\n\nBecker\n\nA pretty low profile. He had started giving speeches, but I would say he was still pretty low profile during that time period.\n\nRiley\n\nAlready, I'm sure, there must have been Presidential library stuff going on.\n\nBecker\n\nA lot of Presidential library going on. I was on the periphery of all that, but a lot of planning for the library, exactly.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat's big on the agenda when you finally come over and formally take the chief of staff job for a few weeks, until he can find somebody?\n\nBecker\n\nStill working on his library. His library opened in '97 and he was just then beginning to decide to get involved in certain groups. The first one I remember is the Eisenhower Fellowship Foundation in Philadelphia. Actually, when I was brainstorming, I looked up to see when he first started doing that. It was in '93, so he did that before I came onboard. That was his first outside involvement. He was doing a lot of paid speaking, or as he calls it, \"white-collar crime.\" When I became his chief of staff, there was the first midterm election. I remember he really struggled with trying to figure out how active to be in politics. He really didn't want to do anything, but candidates were begging him to come campaign for them.\n\nRiley\n\nThat's the Contract [with America] year, right? In 1994.\n\nBecker\n\nYes. That was probably one of the biggest things on our agenda, to try to figure out the rhythm of that. And both George and Jeb ran for Governor that year, which was huge. That was huge.\n\nRiley\n\nSo that's the beginning of their political careers.\n\nBecker\n\nI would say that politics was huge that year, and they campaigned a ton for George and Jeb, a ton. They devoted themselves to those two campaigns.\n\nRiley\n\nWas it hard for him to figure out how to calibrate his participation in those races?\n\nBecker\n\nHe basically did everything they asked.\n\nRiley\n\nSo it was up and down.\n\nBecker\n\nYes, it was madness.\n\nRiley\n\nWhatever they wanted to do.\n\nBecker\n\nIt was more the other candidates. What happened in the fall--He ended up doing more than he intended to, but he still had a lot of friends in office, and what he tended to do was to campaign for his friends.\n\nRiley\n\nSo the struggle is the proper role for a former President to play in politics?\n\nBecker\n\nYes. Plus, he had just lost the election. You know, there was a little bit of that, not with his sons, but at first President Bush wasn't sure how helpful he could be. Now wait a minute. I'll tell you, what he did more than anything was fundraise, as opposed to campaign rallies, which he has never done since leaving office, for other candidates. He felt the way he could help these candidates most was to help them raise money, so he did a ton of fundraising.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd is this working the telephones, or doing events?\n\nBecker\n\nDoing events but not doing telephone at all--attending fundraising events.\n\nRiley\n\nI want to get you to comment on this more generally, and I'll tell you when it came to my attention. I went to Dallas to talk with people about the 43 project that's now ongoing, and was invited by Mark Langdale to go to dinner with some fundraisers, President Bush 43, and Laura, which was a fascinating evening, a very small dinner in Dallas. One of the things that occurred to me during the course of dinner was, I'm sitting there with a man who has spent a good part of his adult life thinking about politics and being very actively engaged in Republican Party politics, and was at the pinnacle of the world as a political actor, the leader of the free world. And then the curtain drops on that and here's a man who has to reinvent himself, not just in taking a different role, but it is almost as though that which he was best at, he no longer is seen to be--It would be inappropriate for him to continue doing what--\n\nBecker\n\nAre you talking about 43?\n\nRiley\n\nI'm talking about 43. What I'm saying is, having witnessed this, it has alerted me to the existence of a universal question for former Presidents, or a universal problem, which is that they're almost by definition the best political actor in the universe, and then the next day, they're cut off from that. How do they reconcile all of this?\n\nBecker\n\nI think it's really hard. That first year out, it's like you almost have to reinvent yourself. I hate that word though, because there's something sort of phony about it. Maybe rediscover yourself. And it's obviously harder when you've lost the election, because you really lose your bearings, particularly when it comes to politics. I didn't know anything about politics. This is where I'm thinking, Oh my God, I'm not the right person to be chief of staff for you, because I had no judgment on any of this. Ron Kaufman, who was one of his top political advisors, who I'm sure you interviewed--\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nBecker\n\nRon became a huge--I brought Ron in. Ron basically was his advisor in '94, not me, because I didn't know anything, but I was there at the table learning a lot. President Bush's concern was that all of these candidates wanted him to help, and he's like, \"Really? Are you sure about that? I just lost the election. Remember? I lost.\" But by that time, now he's an absolute iconic figure in the country, in the party--almost more in the country than the party.\n\nRiley\n\nI think so.\n\nBecker\n\nBut he wasn't there yet.\n\nRiley\n\nNo, not in '94. It's too close.\n\nBecker\n\nIt was too close. His compromise was to go campaign for friends, and to raise money among the party loyalists. They would still pay a thousand dollars or twenty-five hundred dollars, whatever it was, to come get their photo taken. So we decided that's how he could help.\n\nRiley\n\nBut I was struck by the phrase you used, that he lost his bearings.\n\nBecker\n\nI think you lose your bearings.\n\nRiley\n\nIt's striking because from the outside you think, okay, this person can't go campaign because everybody around them views them as radioactive. But what you're suggesting actually is consistent with what I was picking up from this dinnertime event, although more so in this case, because of the loss. You're knocked off your feet by a loss and you don't have anything to compensate for that, to give you the confidence that your political judgment is sound in a way that you thought before.\n\nBecker\n\nThat's right, that's exactly right. And I'm sure there are other examples of where your life is one thing one day and then the next day it's totally different. I don't think there are many others, though, particularly when you bring in the Commander-in-Chief aspect of it, that one day you're Commander-in-Chief and the next day you're not. It's like, \"Okay, sir, we need that football. Wait, give it back.\" You know, you really do go from being the center of the universe to not so much.\n\nRiley\n\nAgain, to further the point that you were making, if you're Commander in Chief--my guess is that almost nobody questioned President Bush's dominating grasp of foreign policy.\n\nBecker\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nI can't imagine that there would have been anybody who would have questioned the value of Bill Clinton picking up the phone and saying, \"I've got a problem in Somalia,\" or wherever. \"I need you.\" It's the political side of it that you're talking about.\n\nBecker\n\nThe political side, right.\n\nRiley\n\nHaving lost the election, there has to be, unless you just have an inhuman gyroscope inside that rights you after a kind of electoral repudiation, you have to lose your bearings, as you say.\n\nBecker\n\nYou lose your bearings, and I watched him find them again. I don't think, at the time, I knew what I was watching, but looking back, I do. I wish I could relive--I really don't want to relive it. I remember that those of us who were in Maine that summer, after it was all over, we decided we should have had tee-shirts made, \"I survived the summer of '93.\" I think we decided that the day the boat crashed. You're watching someone--again, I hate this term--\"reinvent\" himself, but that's really what he's doing. It's like, Okay, well, what do I do now?\n\nRiley\n\nBut you said re-find yourself.\n\nBecker\n\nOr rediscover.\n\nRiley\n\nRediscover was your word.\n\nBecker\n\nThat's more accurate because it's not like they wanted to become a different person. It's just that they had to figure out, where do we go from here?\n\nRiley\n\nAlthough that limits the point that we were just talking about, the loss of bearings. So in '94 he's becoming politically active again.\n\nBecker\n\nRight. Well, his sons' running made it mandatory, and he wanted to be a part of that. The other people--I think he was surprised by how in-demand he was. He was still the leader of the party. He didn't consider himself that but, de facto, he was. It wasn't Gerald Ford, and--I don't know if Reagan had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's by then.\n\nRiley\n\nI think so, by that time.\n\nBecker\n\nThat was pretty early on. I would say that politics dominated my first year of being chief of staff, for that reason.\n\nRiley\n\nTwo questions on things that you just raised: One was about Reagan himself. Did the President ever talk about his time as Vice President with Reagan, with you?\n\nBecker\n\nYes. And actually a lot, recently, because Ronald Reagan's 100th birthday is this year, and I talked him into doing a couple of interviews. He's sort of done with interviews, but he did one with my good friend Judy Keen at USA Today, which I felt a little guilty about, but I knew Judy would be perfect, and she was great. Then he did a TV one with Greta Van Susteren.\n\nHe loved Ronald Reagan. He said he was a wonderful man, and they were very close. They had a very close relationship, and a great partnership. It was like the Ross Perot story I told you. President Bush did a lot for President Reagan that I don't think a lot of us know. Boyden Gray is very articulate on this subject. I'm sure if he dragged you into--Boyden's always obsessed with the fact that 41 is really the one who negotiated Germany's having some missile program that was key at the time. Boyden is obsessed with that.\n\nRiley\n\nGetting the Germans to accept the missiles.\n\nBecker\n\nGetting the Germans to accept it, and how difficult it was. The Vice President took that on and said, \"I will get this done.\" I think they had a wonderful relationship. He went to see him after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's but before he totally disappeared from public sight, and it was tough, it was hard. He knew him, but President Bush said he was--we just talked about this in the interview with Judy. I remember he came home from the trip, and Mrs. Bush went with him. It was in his office in California, or wherever it was, and he took President Bush to the window and said, \"Look, George, look at this gorgeous view I have of the Pacific Ocean.\" Well, it was of downtown. President Bush said they were looking east; they weren't even looking west. It was downtown. I can't remember where his office was, but there were a bunch of buildings. President Bush didn't argue with him. He didn't say, \"What? The ocean's that way.\" Anyway, they were very close.\n\nRiley\n\nThe other question that I have to ask you again, because this is something that pops up in accounts of the President and the family, is the sense that everybody's expectations were always that Jeb was going to be the one that was the rising political star of this generation.\n\nBecker\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd there was a certain amount of surprise, if you will, over the star of the other son rising. Does that comport with your recollections?\n\nBecker\n\nWhat you read and hear is a little exaggerated, definitely. A lot of that is because George W., by that time, was the managing partner of the Rangers, a job that he loved and excelled at. Everyone knew that Jeb had political ambitions.\n\nRiley\n\nHad political ambitions, okay.\n\nBecker\n\nAnd was going to run for Governor. It was his plan. George's decision came later and surprised the hell out of everyone. So it wasn't as much about who the two of them were, because you read that Jeb was the ordained one.\n\nI love the Bushes, when they talk about that, because they used to get asked this a lot in interviews. People really think they sit around the table and decide, \"Okay, you move to Florida to run for--\" There was this ridiculous piece that came out in the New Republic, or something like that, that was just ridiculous, years ago, that was full of so many myths and out-and-out lies. One of the things in that article was that the Bushes, since the beginning of time, would determine where the kids would move: \"Neil, you go to Denver, and Jeb, you go to Florida, and we will take over that state.\" The Bushes would say, \"Yes, we talked about baseball scores, and 'Get your feet off the chair,' but we never talked about any of this.\"\n\nI think that where that whole myth got started is that everyone knew Jeb was going to run for Governor, and then all of a sudden, George W. decided to run for Governor and everyone was really surprised because Jeb had been, not in training, but he had spent a couple of years laying the groundwork, while George W. ran a baseball team. And Ann Richards was very popular. Mrs. Bush constantly pokes fun at herself because she said to him, \"You're not going to win.\" We all know what happened. He won, and Jeb didn't.\n\nRiley\n\nExactly.\n\nBecker\n\nElection night was tough; it was really tough.\n\nRiley\n\nYou were there?\n\nBecker\n\nI was there. I've read and heard a lot about election night, and I think a lot of it is myth. The Bushes decided not to go either place; that was one agonizing decision. They decided to stay home.\n\nRiley\n\nHome being?\n\nBecker\n\nHouston. President Bush came to the office and Mrs. Bush was at the office, too. They both came and watched election returns there, and we were going to have a press conference that evening, which I ended up canceling. It was hard. They were overjoyed that George won. Do you have kids?\n\nRiley\n\nI do.\n\nBecker\n\nI don't have kids, but I've been around parents enough to know that if one of your kids is hurting, that's who you focus on. That's what happened that night. Mrs. Bush eventually went home, and he was in his office for hours with the door closed. I remember at one point thinking, Oh my God, I'd better go in there. He was writing Jeb a letter. He wrote Jeb a letter. He wrote George W. a letter that night too, but the note to George is short. The note to Jeb is heart-wrenching.\n\nRiley\n\nWere those published? Were those in the book?\n\nBecker\n\nNo, they're not in the book, much to my dismay. There are no copies of them.\n\nRiley\n\nBecause he wouldn't let them go?\n\nBecker\n\nHe put them in an envelope and sealed them and mailed them.\n\nRiley\n\nOh, so you never saw them?\n\nBecker\n\nI never saw them. He's told me about them, but I've never seen them. I know what he said to Jeb, though. He said, \"I've been where you are. I want you to remember that I lost in 1964. It just happened to be exactly 30 years ago, and I went on to become President of the United States. This is not the end, this is the beginning.\"\n\nBut you know, Russell, we've talked about this. Jeb of course went on to be a hugely successful, popular Governor of Florida. I think it was best if the two of their careers took a different track, because if they both had been elected, then they're on the same time frame and one is the Governor of the second largest state; the other is the Governor--I think Florida's the fourth largest state, believe it or not, population-wise. Then all of a sudden, it's 2000 and it's like, Hmm. You know what? Life is weird. Jeb might disagree with this, but I think he was meant to lose that night.\n\nRiley\n\nYou'll have a chance to ask him before too long. There weren't difficulties in the family, occasioned by these tensions?\n\nBecker\n\nNo, there weren't difficulties, and Jeb came to George W.'s inauguration. No. It's just the way it was.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nJ. Becker, 5/26/11 35\n\nRiley\n\nOne of the big pieces of things that you were involved with was the library, and maybe the thing to do is just carve out some time now and talk about the process of developing the library and your role in that, and in particular the kinds of things that President Bush was involved with, big and small. Is it true that his decision to put the library at Texas A&M was done in a passing hallway conversation with people?\n\nBecker\n\nI would not know the answer to that. That was all way before my time. Did you talk to Jim Cicconi?\n\nRiley\n\nYes.\n\nBecker\n\nAs part of the oral history? Jim would know that better than I would.\n\nRiley\n\nI can't remember whether we raised that with him or not.\n\nBecker\n\nCicconi was a big part of the library. And George W. was, actually.\n\nRiley\n\nIs that right?\n\nBecker\n\nGeorge W. was a big--Yes, he was definitely one of the--It was Cicconi and George W., and his lawyer, Terri Lacy. The decision was made before he left the White House, when I was out of sight and out of mind. I know the A&M decision was controversial in Houston, because Houston was dying to have it, and I think they were devastated. The decision was before my time.\n\nRiley\n\nBy the time you came onboard, had all of the big decisions been made about the library?\n\nBecker\n\nYes. All the big decisions had been made: where it was going to be, the design of it. What I got, the two big things for me--and this was sort of interesting because I wasn't there during his Presidency--is I started having to sign off on all of the exhibits, as far as content, the wording. We outsourced all that. That was before \"outsource\" was even a popular term.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nBecker\n\nFor example, I sent to Brent everything to do with foreign policy. I sent to probably Roger Porter everything to do with domestic policy. My biggest involvement was once the design was down and they started working on the exhibits and they would send me all these exhibits.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nBecker\n\nTo watch the videos, review the photos, identify people in the captions. I learned a lot about President Bush, the man I was working for, in doing that. And then, planning for the opening of the library in 1997 was huge. It was our first big event that our office had done since he left office. That was a big deal; 1997 was an incredible year.\n\nI'll never forget, probably the year it opened--Don Wilson was the Archivist of the United States, and he's the one who came to College Station to raise the money and build the library--the first time President Bush went through it, after some of the exhibits had been installed. I went through it with the Bushes, and Mrs. Bush did not come back to Houston with us. I don't know if she left to go somewhere. She wasn't with us. Through the whole exhibit--and this was still the time for him to make changes. Don wanted him to come and it was sort of now or never. If this doesn't work, there was still time to make changes.\n\nI will never forget this. He didn't say a word to Don, and we get in the car and he said, \"There were some things I didn't like.\" I said, \"Okay, you were supposed to tell Don.\" He said, \"Well, I didn't want to hurt his feelings.\" I'm like, \"Oh, my God,\" so I get out a notebook. I still remember what they were, the three things: The color red in the China exhibit was wrong; that was not Chinese red. There was a very specific shade of red that is associated with China and this red was too pink. Okay. Some woman had given her elephant collection to the library, and in the part of the exhibit of when he was RNC [Republican National Committee] chairman, was a glass case with all of her elephants. There must have been a hundred elephants: glass ones, porcelain ones, ceramic ones. President Bush said, \"I don't even like elephants. Why do we have those elephants there?\" I'm like, Get rid of elephant collection. And the third one was, it was too much about him. That was the one--Really? I said, \"Okay, there's a problem here. It is about you.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"I don't know. There needs to be more Jim Baker and more Brent Scowcroft, and more team, team, team.\" I'll never forget it. It was just so him.\n\nI would love to have a recording of the conversation with Don Wilson when I called him: The red? Easy. The elephants? He said, \"Oh boy, okay. She'll be crushed.\" Don didn't care, but he said, \"Oh, my gosh, this woman's going to be crushed.\" And the third one--\"Don, here's the other one: It's too much about him.\" Don said, \"What?\" But you know what? They did replace some of the photos. There wasn't a lot they could do, because it was a stupid complaint, because it's the George Bush Presidential Library. But they did do more group photos.\n\nAnyway, the run-up of the opening of the library, '96 and '97, was really intense, and getting ready for the event itself.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd the event itself was mostly yours to do?\n\nBecker\n\nYes. I actually hired--working closely with Don Wilson, but our office really ended up doing the bulk of it, just because President Bush was so hands-on with it. It was huge, because all the Presidents came, the President came; 15 Governors came. We were shocked at how many Governors came. I remember 15 because President Bush decided we should do a reception just for them. John Major came. Brian Mulroney came. [Toshiki] Kaifu, from Japan, came. Lech Walesa came. It was exciting but it was a lot. It was a big deal.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd the protocol--did you have to have somebody to help you with the protocol stuff?\n\nBecker\n\nYes. Protocol was tough. Don Wilson, for the most part, helped me, and the White House advance team was helpful, and then we brought in some of our old White House advance people to help, too. It was exciting. Something like 20,000 people came. That was the estimate. A lot of that was general public. Just wrangling the Bush family. Now I can do it in my sleep.\n\nActually, the groundbreaking of the library was my first big event. It was much smaller.\n\nRiley\n\nThat would have been in '95?\n\nBecker\n\nI think we broke ground in '95, maybe '94. It might have been the fall of '94. The biggest mistake is I did it the week after Thanksgiving. We'll never do that again. It was a huge mistake to do that. But by the time we commissioned the USS George H. W. Bush, I had figured this out. The funeral will be my last event and I'll be very happy not to do any more. Having been through George W.'s inaugurations, the opening of the library, then we reopened the library ten years later, the commissioning of the ship, \"41@80,\" which was huge, I'm done with big events.\n\nRiley\n\nYou mentioned the reopening of the library.\n\nBecker\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nI have a memory, and I can't remember whether this is from talking with Clinton people or from Bush people, that one of the precipitating events there was his going to the Clinton Library.\n\nBecker\n\nI think so. What we were told--I don't think we were sold a bill of goods, but we totally redid the library after ten years, I mean, part of it. Not totally. Parts of it were definitely intact. We were told by somebody--I can't remember now who it was. Roman [Popadiuk] could tell you that. After the Clinton Library opening, our people--I didn't actually go. I still haven't been to the Clinton Library--were overwhelmed by the technology.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nBecker\n\nAnd after we did a little bit of scratching below the surface, the technology people told us the advances in technology in this time period were absolutely huge. One of my questions was--because once again, we start raising money and President Bush hates that--\"Are we going to do this every ten years? You must be joking.\" The answer that came back was, \"No. You do have to reinvent yourself to stay fresh and to update, but technology-wise we may never see another decade like that, ever.\" You can't ever say ever.\n\nRiley\n\nThat's consistent with what I had heard, that they had gone through and the technical interactivity with exhibits was impressive.\n\nBecker\n\nWe had--no pun intended--I was going to say \"an elephant.\" I really mean dinosaur. Our library was even more outdated than ten years, because the advances in technology had totally--so we just, not really started over, but we redid it.\n\nRiley\n\nWere you actively engaged in the new kinds of exhibits?\n\nBecker\n\nVery actively engaged in that. Much more actively engaged with that.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd this is something that President Bush himself was also attentive to or no?\n\nBecker\n\nNo, he was opposed to the whole thing. At some point, President Bush--and I don't know what it is and maybe he was always like that, but President Bush really got tired of talking about himself. I got it. You have to do it when you run for office. And at some point, he did decide that he was the most boring subject of all, and I did get it. It's like, \"I don't blame you.\" He's told the same stories over and over and over again, and he's just done. So when we redid the library, he was not thrilled. For the most part it didn't involve him, because the story was there. We just needed to update how we told it. The truth is, we didn't need him, and that's what I told him: \"You have nothing to do with this. We just want you to show up for the reopening.\" It really was the technological, and then we corrected some mistakes that we felt were--You know, you always learn if you can do it over again. Anyway, it was a big undertaking.\n\nRiley\n\nWell, I have to say that I went through the library the day of and the day before. It must have been the day before.\n\nBecker\n\nWere you there when it reopened?\n\nRiley\n\nNo, I was not there for the reopening but I've seen it in its new iteration. I think it does a wonderful job of threading the needle.\n\nBecker\n\nI think it does too.\n\nRiley\n\nIt is substantive for people who want substance, but it has the flash and the accessibility for people who are in from wherever and want to bring their kids through and see the story of the President in pictures and exhibits. It's not an easy thing to do, to make it accessible and at the same time really informative for people who want more.\n\nBecker\n\nI think they did a remarkable job. I love the team. It was a California team that we hired. I say \"we\" hired. It was really Warren Finch and Patricia Burchfield. This was their baby. We became very close to them. They moved to College Station. We turned them into Texans. Anyway, it was fun.\n\nRiley\n\nHow hard was it to find the airplane? You got an airplane. It's not the same one.\n\nBecker\n\nOh, from World War II. Again, I wasn't part of this, but this is what I think I know: His best friend in World War II, in his squadron, Jack Guy, is the one who found it and donated it. That was Jack's donation to the library. He paid for it; he found it. It probably wasn't that hard, because we constantly get invitations from different aviation clubs who think they're the first ones to call and say, \"We have an old Grumman, TR-something. Would President Bush like to come take a ride?\" And he says, \"No, definitely not, definitely, definitely not.\"\n\nRiley\n\nBut he has jumped out of airplanes.\n\nBecker\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nTell us about jumping out of airplanes.\n\nBecker\n\nOh, my gosh.\n\nRiley\n\nYou must have been around when this notion first--\n\nBecker\n\nYes. The first one was in 1997. I remember that because in 1997 President Bush surprised me in the middle of the year--it wasn't even Christmas. He sent me on a cruise for a week. I think he thought I was having a nervous breakdown and decided--'97 was just way too much, because it was also the year that--I was reminded of this and the whole tumultuousness of the year came back--Hofstra University--I'm sure you know what Hofstra does.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course, yes.\n\nBecker\n\nThey started to do the first post-Presidency conference.\n\nRiley\n\nThey do in a weekend what we do over--\n\nBecker\n\nOur Hofstra was in April of 1997. Mike Meece, in 43's office, just emailed me and said, \"I'm going to kill you because you all did so much for Hofstra, and they are throwing all this in our face and think 43 is going to do all this.\" I said, \"Sorry.\" We did do a lot for Hofstra.\n\nHe jumped out of his first airplane in February of '97. Hofstra was in April, and we opened the library in November. It was a wild year. He became enamored of jumping out of a plane. I wish I could remember exactly what triggered it, but what he said was that he had wanted to do it ever since World War II because he had parachuted out of his plane and he didn't do it right.\n\nRiley\n\nIs that the only time he's ever--\n\nBecker\n\nThat was the only time he'd ever--he had not parachuted since World War II.\n\nRiley\n\nBecause he's an aviator, not a paratrooper, so he wouldn't have had training.\n\nBecker\n\nThe only time he parachuted was when he was shot down. He hit his head on the wing and his chute opened, but not properly, and he didn't remember it. He remembered it, but President Bush said you're sort of in a state of shock.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course.\n\nBecker\n\nHe didn't really remember it. Let's put it this way, it was not fun.\n\nRiley\n\nHe didn't enjoy it.\n\nBecker\n\nHe didn't enjoy it. He said he always thought about it. I knew this at one point and now I can't wrap my mind around why he wanted to do this, I mean what happened in '97. He started thinking about it, and I know he called Colin Powell and asked his opinion and Colin Powell did not want him to do it. He thought it was crazy. And he asked his five kids, all of whom thought it was crazy.\n\nRiley\n\nHe's doing this before you know about it?\n\nBecker\n\nNo, I knew about it. I knew he was thinking about it. He came home from an air show or something. It was something like that, and he said, \"I'm thinking I want to parachute jump.\" So he parachute-jumped in Yuma, Arizona, which is where the Golden Knights--he's done all his jumps with the Golden Knights. That's where they train in the wintertime. He just decided he was going to do it, that this was on his life--the term \"bucket list\" did not exist then, but that's what it was. This was on his bucket list. I'll have to tell you about his other bucket list after this.\n\nRiley\n\nGood.\n\nBecker\n\nI couldn't believe it. But anyway, he jumped.\n\nRiley\n\nDid Barbara try to talk him out of doing this?\n\nBecker\n\nYou know, I think she wasn't wild about it, but Mrs. Bush had by that time definitely been married to George Bush long enough to know that when he makes his mind up about something, he's going to do it. She was not wild about the idea and she did tell him, \"I want you to call your five children.\" None of them were wild about it. He actually wrote--it might be in All the Best.\n\nRiley\n\nYes, that piece is there.\n\nBecker\n\nIs it in All the Best, what he wrote? I think it is.\n\nRiley\n\nHe quoted Jeb as saying something about, \"Don't change your sexual orientation.\"\n\nBecker\n\nYes. I was going to say, did we put that in All the Best? I think we did. \"Fine, Dad, but don't change your sexual orientation.\" He called all the kids and then he--is it in a letter to Hugh Sidey? He wrote all those great letters to Hugh Sidey. I think that's one of the Hugh Sidey letters that we put in All the Best.\n\nAnyway, he decided he was going to do this, and by that time I had worked for him long enough to know that he comes--One of my favorite and least favorite things for him to say to me for years was, \"I have an idea.\" I would always think, Oh, my God. You know, things would have been moving along so nicely, at a nice little pace, and then he says, \"I have an idea, Jean.\" Then it's just like, Okay. It could be, \"Let's go to lunch on the boat,\" or it could be, \"I'm going to jump out of an airplane.\" He jumped first in '97, and I think he has jumped a total of seven times.\n\nRiley\n\nSo when he went out in '97, he didn't get it out of his system?\n\nBecker\n\nHe didn't get it out of his system, because he loved it. And we were shocked at the press coverage. The press coverage was huge and the picture of him jumping was on the front page of almost every newspaper in the country and all over the world. People were sending us newspapers. We were totally caught off-guard by the human interest in his doing that. We were shocked, absolutely shocked.\n\nRiley\n\nThis was '97. By '97, is it your sense that maybe the state of public opinion had changed?\n\nBecker\n\nI think it was beginning to change.\n\nRiley\n\nThat the warmth factor, the warmth had come back in the relationship.\n\nBecker\n\nYes, betwe"
