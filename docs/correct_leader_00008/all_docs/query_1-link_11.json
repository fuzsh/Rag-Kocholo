In 1945, he was accepted in the Youth Airman Academy of the Imperial Japanese Army, but the war ended before his planned enrolment in October. He was then educated at Chuo University and Waseda University.\n\nOn 17 November 1957 Kaifu married Saburō Yanagihara, a female assistant to Member of the House of Representatives.\n\nCareer[]\n\nA member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kaifu ran successfully for the 1960 Japanese general election and took office as the youngest member of the National Diet in the aftermath of Tokyo Spring. He served for sixteen terms, totaling 49 years.\n\nKaifu was education minister before rising to lead the party after the resignation of Takeshita Noboru. Facing Yoshiro Hayashi and Shintaro Ishihara, Kaifu was elected on the platform of clean leadership. He became the 76th Prime Minister of Japan in August 1989.\n\n(Under progress)\n\nDeath[]\n\nKaifu was the last surviving former Japanese prime minister who had served in the 1980s. He died from pneumonia on 9 January 2022 at a Tokyo hospital, at the age of 91. The announcement of his death to the media was delayed until 14 January."
