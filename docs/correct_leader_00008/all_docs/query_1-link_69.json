        "text": "Who says Japan is dominated by male shogunists? Not, apparently, the new Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu. Last week, in a move to improve the scandal-ridden image of his Liberal Democratic Party, Kaifu appointed two women to his 21- member Cabinet. Sumiko Takahara, 56, a writer on economic affairs, became Economic Planning Agency director, and former Labor Ministry bureaucrat Mayumi Moriyama, 61, was named to head the Environment Agency. –\n\nIn a country where only three females have ever held Cabinet posts, the appointments seemed a welcome change. But the L.D.P. still has a way to go in reforming itself. Kaifu, 58, attained his office by deal-making with ousted leaders Noboru Takeshita and Shintaro Abe; in return for their help, Kaifu awarded their factions powerful Cabinet positions. And Kaifu was already bedeviled by unfounded rumors of sexual misconduct."
