        "text": "(1931–2022). Kaifu Toshiki was prime minister of Japan in 1989–91. An advocate of electoral reform, he was made prime minister in the wake of scandals that led to the resignations of the two previous prime ministers. He had served 10 terms in the Diet, Japan’s legislature, before advancing to the executive office.\n\nKaifu was born on January 2, 1931, in Ichinomiya, Japan, the son of a photography studio owner. He graduated from Waseda University, Tokyo, in 1954. With the support of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kaifu won election to the House of Representatives in 1960, becoming the youngest member of the Diet. He was reelected nine times thereafter. He served as deputy chief secretary of Prime Minister Miki Takeo’s cabinet from 1974 to 1976. Kaifu was then minister of education under Prime Minister Fukuda Takeo in 1976 and 1977. He held the latter post again in 1985 and 1986 under Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro.\n\nIn 1989 prime ministers Takeshita Noboru and Uno Sosuke successively resigned from office because of scandals and public dissatisfaction with the governing LDP. In August of that year, Kaifu was chosen to fill out Uno’s term as president of the party. He was then elected by the House of Representatives to succeed Uno as prime minister. That fall, Kaifu was elected to a full two-year term as president of the LDP. Overcoming a lack of experience in foreign policy and economic affairs, he led the LDP to a sweep of national elections for the House of Representatives in February 1990. The party thereby sustained its majority in that legislative body. However, key party leaders grew angry at Kaifu’s efforts to reform Japanese electoral politics. He declined to seek reelection to the presidency of the LDP in October 1991 after he lost the support of these leaders. Kaifu’s term as prime minister ended the following month.\n\nKaifu continued to be involved in politics. In 1994 he left the LDP to become leader of the Shinshinto (New Frontier Party). After that party disbanded in 1997, he ultimately rejoined the LDP. Kaifu, who had served in the House of Representatives for 49 years, lost his seat in the 2009 elections. He died on January 9, 2022, in Tokyo."
