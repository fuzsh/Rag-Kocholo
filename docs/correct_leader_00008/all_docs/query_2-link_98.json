        "text": "Private university in Shinjuku, Tokyo, JapanTemplate:SHORTDESC:Private university in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan\n\n<templatestyles src=\"Module:Infobox/styles.css\"></templatestyles>\n\nWaseda University (早稲田大学), abbreviated as Waseda (早稲田) or Sōdai (早大), is a private research university in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Founded in 1882 as the Tōkyō Professional School by the former Prime Minister of Japan, Ōkuma Shigenobu, the school was formally renamed Waseda University in 1902.[4]\n\nWaseda is organized into thirty-six departments: thirteen undergraduate schools and twenty-three graduate schools. As of 2023, there are 38,776 undergraduate students and 8,490 graduate students. In addition to a central campus in Shinjuku (Waseda Campus and Nishiwaseda Campus), the university operates campuses in Chūō, Nishitōkyō, Tokorozawa, Honjō, and Kitakyūshū. Waseda also operates 21 research institutes at its main Shinjuku campus.[5]\n\nThe university is selected as one of the “Top Type” (Type A) universities under MEXT's Top Global University Project.[6] Waseda University has the highest entrance examination difficulty level among private universities in Japan.[7]\n\nIts alumni include eight prime ministers of Japan,[8] three prime ministers of Korea,[9][10][11] a number of important figures of Japanese literature, including Haruki Murakami, and many CEOs, including the Japan's richest person[12] Tadashi Yanai,[13] the CEO of UNIQLO, Nobuyuki Idei, the former CEO of Sony, Shin Kyuk-ho,[14] founder of Lotte Group,[15] Takeo Fukui, the former president and CEO of Honda, Norio Sasaki, the former CEO of Toshiba, Lee, Kun-hee[16][17] and Lee, Byung-chul,[18] the chairman and founder of Samsung Group, Mikio Sasaki, the former chairman of Mitsubishi, and Hiroshi Yamauchi and Shuntaro Furukawa, former and current presidents of Nintendo respectively, as well as influential Chinese government figures such as Zhou Enlai and Li Dazhao.[19][20] Kim Seong-su,[21][22] former Vice President of South Korea, established Korea University, one of the Korean peninsula's leading institutions. This connection led to a professional academic collaboration between Waseda and Korea University starting in 1973, culminating in a dual degree program at the bachelor's and master's levels.[23][24]\n\nIn 1982, Waseda University initiated an academic exchange agreement with Peking (Beijing) University. Since 2005, this partnership has offered double degree programs at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral (Ph.D.) levels, illustrating the university's dedication to international academic collaboration.[25][26][27]\n\nHistory[]\n\nWaseda was founded as Tōkyō Senmon Gakkō (東京専門学校) on 21 October 1882 by samurai scholar and Meiji-era politician and former prime minister Ōkuma Shigenobu. Before the name 'Waseda' was selected, it was known variously as Waseda Gakkō (早稲田学校) or Totsuka Gakkō (戸塚学校) after the location of the founder's villa in Waseda Village and the school's location in Totsuka Village respectively. It was renamed Waseda University (早稲田大学, Waseda-daigaku) on 2 September 1902, upon acquiring university status. It started as a college with three departments under the old Japanese system of higher education.\n\nIn 1882, the university had the department of political science and economics, law, and physical science. Along with these departments, an English language course was established, where the students of all the departments could learn English.[28] Three years later, the department of physical science was closed because it had too few applicants.[29]\n\nThe department of literature was established in 1890,[30] the department of education in 1903, the department of commerce in 1904,[31] and the department of science and engineering in 1908.[32]\n\nAlthough Waseda formally adopted the term university in its title in 1902[4] it was not until 1920 that, in common with other Japanese schools and colleges, it received formal government recognition as a university under the terms of the University Establishment Ordinance.[33] Thus Waseda became, with Keio University, the first private university in Japan.\n\nMuch of the campus was destroyed in the fire bombings of Tokyo during World War II, but the university was rebuilt and reopened by 1949. It has grown to become a comprehensive university with two senior high schools and school of art and architecture.[citation needed]\n\nOn 12 June 1950, sixty police raided Waseda University and seized copies of a Communist-inspired open letter to General MacArthur. The open letter to MacArthur was once read at a Communist-sponsored rally a week earlier. The letter demanded a peace treaty for Japan that would include Russia and Communist China, withdrawal of occupation forces, and the release of eight Japanese sent to prison for assaulting five U.S. soldiers at a Communist rally. A police official said most Waseda meetings would be banned in the future because \"political elements\" might try to utilize them. Yuichi Eshima, Vice-chairman of the Students Autonomy Society, said the police action \"stupefied\" students and professors, and that \"This is worse than the prewar peace preservation measures.\"[34]\n\nIn 1993, President of the United States Bill Clinton visited Waseda University and mentioned that the university is a center of academic excellence and a training ground for Japan's distinguished leaders.[35]\n\nAcademic cap[]\n\nŌkuma had long desired to create an academic cap so distinctive that someone wearing the cap would immediately be identified as a Waseda student.[36] The chief tailor of Takashimaya, Yashichiro, was called upon to design a cap in three days. Each square cap was stamped on the inside with the student's name, his department, the school seal and the legend, \"This certifies that the owner is a student of Waseda\". Thus, the cap served as a form of identification, and effectively a status symbol. The cap, with its gold-braided badge, is registered as a trademark.\n\nAnniversary[]\n\nOn 21 October 2007, Waseda University celebrated its 125th anniversary. Ōkuma often talked about the \"125 years of life\" theory: \"The lifespan of a human being can be as long as 125 years. He will be able to live out his natural lifespan as long as he takes proper care of his health\", because \"physiologists say that every animal has the ability to live five times as long as its growth period. Since a man is said to require about 25 years to become fully mature, it follows that he can live up to 125 years of age.\" This theory propounded by Ōkuma was very popular and often referred to in the media of the time.\n\nIn commemorative events relating to Waseda University and Ōkuma, the number 125 is accorded special significance, as it marks an important epoch. The tower of Ōkuma Auditorium, completed on the university's 45th anniversary, is 125 shaku, or about 38 m high. In 1963, there were also events to mark the 125th anniversary of Ōkuma Shigenobu's birth.\n\nŌkuma, who twice served as prime minister of Japan, organized his second cabinet when he was 77 and died when he was 83. He said, \"I wish I had understood this '125 years of life' theory 30 years earlier\". He did, however, lead a regular life, and lived fairly long compared to other Japanese at the time.\n\nWaseda Alumni[]\n\nMain article: List of Waseda University people\n\nThere are currently more than 600,000 alumni members.[37] According to Japanese media, there are over 3,100 famous individuals known nationwide in Japan who are alumni of Waseda University.

A seven-story high clock tower stands to the left of the auditorium. Important events and lectures hosted by Waseda University are often held in the Ōkuma Auditorium. Club-sponsored plays, lectures and events are held in the auditorium on days when it is not in use by the university. Many of Waseda University's undergraduate and graduate schools hold their entrance and graduation ceremonies at the Okuma Auditorium.\n\nThe auditorium opened on 20 October 1927, about five years behind schedule, after the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. A Memorial Hall, constructed in 1957, was used as the fencing venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics.[43]\n\nIn April 1999, the auditorium along with the old library building were officially designated the first and second historical buildings under the newly passed Tokyo Metropolitan Landscape Regulations, which aim to preserve buildings representative of Tokyo's history and culture. The auditorium was designated as one of the Important Cultural Properties of Japan by the Agency for Cultural Affairs in 2007.[44]\n\nŌkuma Garden[]\n\nŌkuma Garden is located near Ōkuma Auditorium.

The Waseda University Library, designed by Tachu Naitō, Kenji Imai and Kin'ichi Kiriyama, was completed in 1925. This five-story building, with a total area of 1,195-tsubo (3,950 m2) (坪), was used initially as the University Library. The reading room was housed in a separate two-story building, with a seating capacity of 500. One of the prominent libraries established at the end of the Taishō period, it has been a symbol of Waseda University to this day, along with the Okuma Auditorium and the Theatre Museum. The Old Library and the administration building were expanded in 1934 and 1955, respectively. After the New Central Library, the Old Library stopped serving as a main library, located where the Abe Stadium used to be, was completed in 1990. It now houses Takata Sanae Memorial Research Library, the University Archives, and Aizu Yaichi Museum. Takata Sanae Memorial Research Library opened in 1994. It is named after former university president Takata Sanae. Historical and cultural materials on Waseda University are exhibited in the University Archives, and the materials related with Ōkuma Shigenobu are exhibited in the Ōkuma Memorial Room at the Archives. Aizu Yaichi Memorial Museum opened in 1998.[46]\n\nIn the front hall, visitors are greeted by the masterpiece \"Meian\", which dates back to 1927. It is painted on the world's largest hand-made washi (Japanese paper), which is 4.45 meters in diameter and weighs about 12 kilograms. It was manufactured by Iwano Heisaburō, the founder of the Echizen paper works in Imadachi-cho, Fukui prefecture. The masterpiece was painted free of charge by Yokoyama Taikan and Shimomura Kanzan, two artists who represented the modern Japanese style of painting. President Takata Sanae asked them to paint a picture for the Library. The library possesses a unique collection which survived the Bombing of Tokyo in World War II unlike many of its counterparts. The collection is an important resource for the study of pre-war Japanese history and literature.\n\nOther museums and libraries on Waseda campuses include:\n\nWaseda University Tsubouchi Memorial Theatre Museum\n\nAizu Museum\n\nAthletics[]\n\n[]\n\nMain article: Waseda Big Bears football\n\nCheerleading[]\n\nThe Waseda University Cheerleading Club is the cheerleading club of Waseda University.\n\nBaseball[]\n\nWaseda's baseball team is known for their long history of success in Tokyo Big6 Baseball League.
