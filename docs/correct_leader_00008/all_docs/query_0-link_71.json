Politicians of both countries should proceed from this overall situation and pay attention to the fundamental wishes and interest of the two peoples, always educate the young generation with correct concept of history and promote the development of Sino-Japanese relations in a continuous way, so as to maintain friendship between the two peoples from generation to generation.\n\nHe pointed out that the Chinese government always pays special attention to Sino-Japanese relations. Maintaining a healthy, stable and friendly cooperative relationship not only benefits the two peoples, but also contributes to the stability and prosperity of Asia and the world.\n\nJiang said that he expects the New Conservative Party and all social sectors in Japan will make active efforts in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship.\n\nTakeshi Noda conveyed greetings of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to President Jiang and passed on Koizumi's letter to Jiang.\n\nHe said that this year happens to be the 30th anniversary of the normalization of Japan-China relations, all social circles in Japan are preparing for various kinds of commemorative activities. The Japanese side is planning to send a 10,000-strong delegation of friendship to visit China, so as to further promote the healthy and stable development of Japan-China friendly relations in the new century.\n\nToshiki Kaifu recalled with pleasure his many meetings with President Jiang, saying he is proud for the efforts he made when he was prime minister in promoting friendship between the two countries.
