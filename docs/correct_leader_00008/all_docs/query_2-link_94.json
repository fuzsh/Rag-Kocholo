        "text": "1816\n\nWilliam Marsh Rice is born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 14, 1816, to David and Patty Rice. In addition to working as an inspector in the Springfield Armory, David also serves in local and state political positions and helps establish a local school in which William is later enrolled. By age 15, William has gone to work in the Family Grocery Store, owned by retired whaling captain Henry L. Bunker. He stays with Bunker for about five years, then buys his own store. In less than two years, he clears $2,000 on this first business venture.\n\n1838\n\nSpurred by economic depression in Springfield and by the promise of cheap land and untapped wealth in the new Republic of Texas, Rice decides to seek his fortune in Texas. He sends all his goods by ship to Galveston and travels there himself down the Mississippi and by rail. When he arrives in October, he discovers that the ship carrying his goods has been lost at sea and that he is penniless.\n\n1891\n\nThe charter for the William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Literature, Science, Art, Philosophy, and Letters is signed on May 13 and is registered on May 19. Rice appoints six trustees—Captain James Addison Baker, Jr., Cesar M. Lombardi, Everett McAshan, Emanuel Raphael, Frederick Rice, and Alfred S. Richardson. The institute, which is not to be begun until after Rice’s death, will be tuition free.\n\n1900\n\nWilliam Marsh Rice is found dead in New York City on September 23. The next day, lawyer Albert T. Patrick presents a will purportedly signed by Rice that bequeaths the bulk of Rice’s estate to Patrick. Suspecting foul play, Captain Baker initiates an investigation that finds that Rice was chloroformed to death by Patrick and Rice’s valet, Charles Jones, in a conspiracy to claim Rice’s estate. Jones turns state’s evidence, and Patrick spends 10 years in Sing Sing prison, his sentence is commuted.\n\n1904\n\nThanks to the efforts of Captain Baker, legal challenges to Rice’s genuine will are resolved, and the Rice Institute receives a $4.6 million founding endowment. A large part of the estate consists of timberland in Louisiana. Proceeds from the sale of timber from this land fund the construction of the Administration Building (later to be renamed Lovett Hall) and other early buildings on campus.\n\n1907\n\nIn January, the trustees begin searching for the first president of the Rice Institute. They receive 39 recommendations from around the country. As the trustees consider the options and narrow the field, one individual stands out—mathematician and astronomer Edgar Odell Lovett, who has been recommended by Woodrow Wilson, president of Princeton University. On November 20, the trustees formally offer Lovett the post. During the hiring negotiations, Lovett visits Houston and recommends that the institute be build on a 300-acre site at the end of Main Street—an area he feels will never become industrialized.\n\n1908\n\nOn January 18, Lovett formally agrees to become the first president of the Rice Institute, and he arrives in Houston in March. One of his first acts is to depart, in July, on a worldwide journey to great universities and centers of learning in England, across the Continent, and all the way to Japan. His goals are to understand what makes an exceptional institution of higher education and to organize a distinguished first faculty. Equally important, with this journey, Lovett establishes two of Rice’s enduring principles: A great university must be international in scope and must have an eminent faculty firmly grounded in research as well as in superior teaching.\n\n1909\n\nLovett returns to Houston on May 7, an he and the trustees begin making decisions that will set the tone and scope of the institute. They believe that a university should be useful to society by bringing various services to the community and by offering a utilitarian education for its students that will provide them with an occupation for life. They do not envision that the institute will become a trade school, but rather that it will aspire to university standing of the highest level, seeking “to attain that high place through the research work of its early professors, setting no upper limit to its educational endeavor.”\n\n1909\n\nFinally, the institute becomes more of a reality with the purchase of the 300 acres at the end of Main Street that Lovett recommended as the site of the campus. Lovett selects Ralph Adams Cram of the Boston architecture firm Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson to design the campus plan and the earliest Rice buildings. Cram’s design for the Administration Building (later to be renamed Lovett Hall) lays the foundation for the look of the “traditional” Rice building—a Mediterranean/Byzantine blend of cloisters, whimsical details, and facades of marble, concrete, and St. Joe brick.\n\n1911\n\nThe cornerstone for Rice’s first building, the Administration Building, is laid on March 2, Texas Independence Day. The stone is of Ozark marble and contains a sealed copper box containing a copy of the King James version of the Bible, the charter of the institute, brief biographies of William Marsh Rice and the trustees, a photograph of the general campus plan, a copy of the January 12 Houston Chronicle and a copy of the January 18 Houston Daily Post.\n\n1912\n\nLovett chooses as the school colors “a blue still deeper then the Oxford blue…and the Confederate gray, enlivened by a tinge of lavender.” It has been suggested that blue and gray were chosen because William Marsh Rice amassed much of his fortune by trading with both the North and South during the Civil War.\n\n1912\n\nRice holds formal opening ceremonies on October 12. In addition to the trustees, faculty, and students, attendees include local and state officials and dignitaries from governments and universities around the world. In his address, Lovett announces that Rice will “aspire to university standing of the highest grade,” and he proposes ” to assign no upper limit to its educational endeavor.” He also states that “the residential college idea…is prominent…in the plans of the new institution.” Buildings completed for the ceremonies are the Administration Building (later to be renamed Lovett Hall), the Mechanical Laboratory, South Hall (later to be renamed Will Rice College), and the commons dining room (later to be renamed Baker Commons).\n\n1914\n\nUntil now, the faculty members have been only loosely organized due to their small numbers, but because of additions, there is a growing need for more formal faculty organization. The earliest minutes existing for the faculty sitting as a formal body are dated March 27.\n\n1916\n\nThe Honor System is adopted by a vote of the student body. Each student has to sign the pledge, “On my honor, I have neither given nor received any aid on this examination,” at the end of each test. The honor Council is formed to decide on cases of infraction of the Honor Code.\n\n1917\n\nThe owl mascot gets a formal name in an informal manner. When the owl is kidnapped by students at Texas A&M, Rice students hire a private detective to find out where he has been taken. After location the owl, the detective sends a telegram saying, “Sammy is fairly well and would like to see his parents at eleven o’clock.”\n\n1918\n\nCaptain and Mrs. Baker endow the first Rice scholarship for high academic standing, named in honor of their eldest son, the late Frank Graham Baker. It is open to both female and male undergraduates, and the recipient will receive a stipend of $360 for one year. (Even through Rice is tuition free, there are a registration fee and room-and-board costs.)\n\n1924\n\nJohn W. Heisman, for whom the Heisman Trophy will eventually be named, becomes Rice’s first full-time head football coach. Although Heisman has a reputation for coaching championship teams, his record at Rice is less than stellar. His first season ends in a tie with Texas A&M for third place in the Southwest Conference, his second in seventh place, and his third in the cellar. Following an even more dismal fourth season, Heisman resigns on December 1, 1927.\n\n1932\n\nDue to the Great Depression, faculty salaries are cut 5-10 percent. Students pay a price, too. The registration fee is raised from $10 to $25, and students are required to live one year in the residence halls and pay $18 per year to support the Student Association, the Honor Council, and student publications.\n\n1941\n\nIn April, troubled by the institute’s financial position, Captain Baker recommends to the trustees that the charter be amended to allow Rice to charge tuition. The board agrees, but a sequence of events prevents the filing of the necessary suit to alter the charter. First, on April 23, the board has to file a renewal of the charter. Second, on May 14, Edgar Odell Lovett resigns as president, although he agrees to stay on until a successor can be found. And third, on August 1, Captain Baker, the only chair the Rice Board of Trustees has known, dies. But tuition becomes, for the time being, a moot point when oil is discovered on the Rice lands in Louisiana that were part of the original endowment.\n\n1941\n\nDue to World War II, campus life is disrupted academically and socially in July 1943. Naval ROTC is established, and approximately 200 naval trainees are quartered on campus, outnumbering civilian men two to one; no civilian men live on campus. (Civilians lived on campus through May of 1943) Rice goes on the navy’s schedule, holding classes year-round and adhering to navy-prescribed curricula and campus routines.\n\n1941\n\nThe Engineering Society is disbanded after its hazing practices get out of control. Sometime between March 1944 and June 1946 the Engineering Society was abolished and was later revived in 1946 under strict faculty regulations and guidance only to expire again after the Spring of 1947.\n\n1945\n\nThe trustees devise a 10-year plan to meet new goals for Rice. In preparing this plan, the trustees analyze the institute’s past developments, present status, and future outlook. This analysis shows that Rice is not simply the engineering school many think it is. Between 1929 and 1943, 49 percent of students had been registered in the liberal arts school (which included the pure sciences and mathematics), 33.7 percent in engineering and architecture, and remaining 17 percent in physical education, premedical, and graduate programs. The foremost objective of the trustees’ plan follows Lovett’s original intentions to provide especially good training for a limited number of students through a sound basic program that sets a high standard of scholarship and provides leadership in higher education. Faculty will be increased, and the curriculum will be further developed, with expansion in the arts and letters, through the emphasis will remain on science and research. The trustees also call for a substantial building program, including plans for a library, classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, and a house for the president.\n\n1947\n\nWith Houston come many changes, not the least of which is a revamping of the curriculum, which has remained virtually untouched since its original formulation and still does not provide for the modern concept of the “major.” To keep in step with developments at other major universities, to broaden the curriculum, and to give students more experiences that will prepare them for the outside world and for graduate school, formal academic programs are established. These are broken into two main areas, academics and science/engineering, each having its own required core courses. Students take courses that, for the first two years, are designed to emphasize basic skills in English, mathematics, history, and science. At that time, they will declare a major and will begin taking courses in their specialization.\n\n1947\n\nAdditional graduate student enrollment is encouraged, in part using stipends as incentive, but entry requirements are becoming more stringent. For the first time, candidates are advised to take the Graduate Record Exam, with high scoring candidates given preference. There is also a plan to increase the number of faculty, but President Houston insists that candidates possess two characteristics that echo a tradition set by President Lovett: They must be outstanding scholars who publish or who are involved in research, and they must be inspiring teachers.\n\n1950\n\nThe trustees announce that most of the 10-year goals adopted in 1945 have been completed five years ahead of schedule. The Board of Trustees itself undergoes changes. To the seven trustees, who still hold legal ownership of the institute, are added eight nonvoting term governors to help shoulder the responsibilities of the developing institute.\n\n1957\n\nLovett does live long enough, however, to see one of his dreams come to fruition with the establishment of the residential college system. The first colleges are Baker (formerly East Hall, named for Captain James A. Baker, Jr.), Will Rice (formerly South Hall, named for trustee William Marsh Rice, Jr.), Hanszen (formerly West Hall, named for trustee Harry Clay Hanszen), and Wiess, all for men, and Mary Gibbs Jones (named for the wife of businessman and Houston Endowment founder Jesse H. Jones) for women.\n\n1960\n\nThe Board of Governors, echoing President Lovett’s long-held belief the that word “institute” no longer conveys the the scope of Rice’s educational program or its status in the academic world, proposes that the Rice Institute change its name to William Marsh Rice University. In the face of only minor opposition, the new name becomes effective on July 1.\n\n1961\n\nKenneth Pitzer, who had been a professor of chemistry at Berkeley, is inaugurated as the third Rice president. Although Pitzer wants Rice to remain modest in size, he proposes enlarging undergraduate enrollment and encourages growth in the graduate school from 400 to 800 students. In an effort to attract the best graduate students, he increases the number of graduate fellowships. Pitzer also believes that a faculty of great distinction, consisting of outstanding teachers who also are eminent in research, is the key to a university’s reputation. He predicts that an upgraded faculty will benefit the undergraduate as well as the graduate programs, helping to attract good students. In addition, he wants to see several new buildings–one for architecture, one for fine arts, and two for new colleges. And last, he proposes a professional school for business administration.\n\n1962\n\nA semi centennial celebration similar to the opening celebration of 1912 is held on October 10-12. Hundreds of scholars and distinguished representatives from universities worldwide visit the campus to hear special speakers, to attend lectures, and to participate in ceremonies commemorating the university. The highlight of the event is the formal installation of Kenneth Pitzer as Rice’s third president. The low point is a football game against the University of Oregon that the Owls lose 31-12.\n\n1962\n\nOn September 12, President John F. Kennedy delivers his space exploration address in Rice Stadium, promising that the U.S. will send a man to the moon by the end of the decade: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard…. And I am delighted that this university is playing a part in putting a man on the moon as part of a great national effort of the United States of America.”\n\n1963\n\nIn January, the board approves, for the first time, a formal tenure policy and, by March, has assigned all faculty tenure or one-to three-year appointments. The board also addresses several connected issues of vital concern: rising costs, a need for increased capital expenditures, and a difficulty in securing grants because the university is perceived as not using all its possible financial resources to the fullest. A unanimous board files a lawsuit to alter the university’s charter to permit Rice to charge tuition. The suit, filed on February 21, also contains a second important provision allowing Rice to admit qualified students without regard to race or color.\n\n1964\n\nThe university issues a 10-year plan that outlines improvements and enhancements that will be required for Rice to meet its own needs and expectation. These include increased fund raising, new academic buildings, new residential college, major purchases of laboratory equipment, and library acquisitions. Even more than in the past, students are to be selected for their high intellectual abilities, motivation, and personal qualifications, while professors are the ablest that Rice can attract. New departments are created and others strengthened, and the foreign language curriculum is expanded.\n\n1964\n\nIn February, the court finds in favor of the petition filed the year before to allow Rice to modify its charter to charge tuition and to admit students of all races. Although tuition will now be charged, the university places strong emphasis on providing scholarship aid for all qualified students who need financial help.\n\n1968\n\nKenneth Pitzer resigns as president of Rice to become president of Stanford University. The trustees announce on February 20 their choice for the new president, William H. Masterson, historian and former dean of humanities, but most faculty and students protest because they were not consulted in the decision. The “Masterson Crisis” ends five days later as Masterson resigns. History professor Frank E. Vandiver is appointed interim president until the post can be filled officially.\n\n1970\n\nChemist Norman Hackerman, former president of the University of Texas at Austin, is inaugurated as the fourth president of Rice. He comes to a university that has just completed its most expansive 25 years, and he sees as his main obligation the need to balance programs with means. He is most concerned with restructuring the administration to address the needs of a larger, more complex, more research oriented university. The Development Office begins its work in earnest.\n\n1976\n\nThe Brown Challenge, a fund-raising program designed to encourage annual gifts, is launched . It is one of the most significant decisions ever made on behalf of the university, and by the time it ends in 1995, it will have brought the total of Brown Foundation gifts during the period to more then $50 million. At the same time, the Brown Foundation matching money attracts additional tens of millions of dollars from individual donors.\n\n1979\n\nThe Rice Quantum Institute, composed of chemists, physicists, and engineers, is founded. It is Rice’s first interdisciplinary research center, a concept that will become integral to Rice University in the decades to come. Transcending traditional boundaries between disciplines, departments, and even divisions, interdisciplinary programs bring research and ideas from widely divergent fields to bear on scientific, technical, social, and cultural problems that cannot easily be solved by single approach.\n\n1985\n\nGeorge E. Rupp is named the fifth president of Rice. Former dean of Harvard Divinity School and a professor of religious studies, he is the first nonscientist president of Rice. He reemphasizes the ideals set forth by President Lovett: Rice will offer outstanding education to the most capable students; it will intensify its efforts in research, scholarship, and professional accomplishment; and it will uphold and extend the very concept of education that animated the founder—service to the community. His plans include improving the curriculum to maintain Rice’s excellent undergraduate education; strengthening graduate programs by building on areas of existing excellence; adding new faculty with interdisciplinary interests and either great distinction or promise; fostering research; and initiating a new wave of building.\n\n1987\n\nChanges are made again to the Rice curriculum. The new “foundation course curriculum” states that science, engineering, architecture, and music students must take a year-long humanities course and a social science course, and humanities and social science students must take a year-long natural science course.\n\n1993\n\nEconomist S. Malcolm Gillis is inaugurated as the sixth president of Rice on October 30. He comes to Rice from Duke University, where he served as dean of the graduate school, vice provost for academic affairs, and then dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. He pays homage to Rice’s traditions and academic excellence, but he also emphasizes the diverse ways Rice needs to respond to a changing world. These changes include investing in efforts to internationalize Rice, concentrating on new undertakings in science and engineering, providing greater responsiveness to the community, enhancing the quality and value of education and scholarship at Rice, strengthening the faculty, and enlarging Fondren Library. To achieve these aims, he vigorously pushes ahead a number of initiatives, such as the creation of new interdisciplinary institutes and centers and the construction of buildings to house them and renewal of fund-raising efforts.\n\n1997\n\nJames A. Baker III Hall, the new home of the Baker Institute, the School of Social Sciences, and the Departments of Political Science and Economics, is dedicated. Former president George Bush, current U.S. Secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who delivered her remarks in a videotaped message, and former Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev speak to more than 6,000 conference attendees. Joining in the program are former U.S. secretaries of state James A. Baker, III; Warren Christopher; and Henry Kissinger and CNN news anchor Bernard Shaw, who moderated a panel discussion.\n\n1998\n\nDell Butcher Hall, named in honor of a former chair of the Rice board, is dedicated in April. It is the new home of the Center for Nanoscale Technology and the Department of Chemistry.\n\n1998\n\nRice announces plans to rebuild Wiess College and to build a ninth college, Marian and Speros P. Martel College, named for a Houston businessman and his wife, whose foundation has a tradition of philanthropy to the university. The renovated and new college will allow 83 percent of undergraduate students to live on campus.\n\n1998\n\nGroundbreaking ceremonies are held in December for the new Humanities Building. The building will house the offices of the dean of humanities; the Departments of History, Religious studies, and Philosophy; and the offices of the Center for the Study of Cultures and the Study of Women and Gender program.\n\n1998\n\nRice is cited in the September U.S. News & World Report as having the least debt per graduate of private universities. Rice is also voted among the best college values in the nation. Rice begins to cap undergraduate student loan debt to ensure that students do not incur onerous debt in getting an education.\n\n1999\n\nRice creates the Center for Neuroscience, a broad-based program that draws on the resources of five schools at Rice as well as the Neuroscience Division of Baylor College of Medicine, to establish a new, interdisciplinary graduate program in the neurosciences. The Rice Graduate Council approves 10 course in neuroscience to being in fall 1999."
