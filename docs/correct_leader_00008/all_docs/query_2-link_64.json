Mr. METZENBAUM addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized. Who yields time? Several Senators addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Helms is recognized. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized. Mr. HELMS. I will be glad to yield to the distinguished Senator from Ohio provided I do not lose my right to the floor. Mr. SPECTER. Will my colleague yield for a 30-second unanimous- consent request? Mr. METZENBAUM. I was about to make one myself. Mr. SPECTER. I will await Senator Metzenbaum. Mr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak for 10 minutes as in morning business on a totally different subject than the Talbott nomination. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? If not, the Senator is recognized. Mr. McCAIN. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] is recognized. Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request. Following the remarks by the distinguished Senator, Mr. McCain, who will follow, as I understand it, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, I ask that the distinguished Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] be recognized for 20 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleagues for yielding---- Mr. METZENBAUM. Is this on the unanimous-consent request to which the Senator from Pennsylvania is addressing himself? Mr. SPECTER. I am addressing the Chair. The Senator from Ohio is making a parliamentary inquiry, subject to the yielding of time by the manager of the bill. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that articles by Ambassador Talbott be printed in the Record in full dated April 3, 1989, August 20, 1990, June 3, 1991, and October 7, 1991, which constitute the text of Ambassador Talbott's comments which I had submitted in my floor statement this morning which shows a pattern of attitude on the United States-Israeli relationship, which is of recent origin, not going back to 1981. I have said that these items were not furnished to me---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold? Who yields time to the Senator from Pennsylvania? Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from North Carolina had stated that I would be recognized under the previous agreement for 20 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. SPECTER. I thought the Senator from North Carolina yielded time to me for my unanimous-consent request. Mr. President, is there a parliamentary inquiry from the Senator from Ohio? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Was there an inquiry from the Senator from Ohio? Mr. METZENBAUM. Indeed, there was. The question was whether or not while my parliamentary inquiry was being made, a request for permission to speak as in morning business, then as I understand it, the Senator from North Carolina asked unanimous consent that certain people be recognized for the purpose of speaking on the Talbott nomination. I do not believe that consent was ever given to that request. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Senator from Ohio sought the floor earlier and asked for recognition, I asked for 30 seconds to make a unanimous-consent request. I then understood the Senator from Ohio to say that he had a 30-second unanimous-consent request that he asked for consent for 10 minutes and the Senator from Arizona objected. Then the Senator from North Carolina, who is the manager on the Republican side, yielded time for my unanimous-consent request which may go to 45 seconds instead of 30 seconds and then yielded time to Senator McCain and to Senator Gorton. I believe the Senator from North Carolina has the authority to yield that time since he has that much time on the bill. Mr. HELMS. That is correct. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has the authority to yield the time. However, it takes unanimous consent to establish that. Mr. HELMS. I certainly ask unanimous consent. I thought it was implicit. If not, I am glad to ask unanimous consent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is their objection? Hearing none it is so ordered. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized. Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Carolina and I thank the Chair. I just wanted to make a clarifying statement following a floor presentation I made this morning to include these copies of Ambassador Talbott's articles in Time which represent, in my view, a continuation of his attitudes far beyond the 1981 date. Second, I wish to add that when I met with Ambassador Talbott for more than an hour on February 8, he said he would send me a copy of his articles so that I could read them in their entirety. That had not been received. What had been received by my office last Thursday was a packet of materials which contained a good bit of information in favor of Ambassador Talbott's nomination, but not the articles I had requested. I just wanted to clarify the record on that. I do not wish to make a Federal case out of whether he sent me the material or not, but I was reciting a concern I had in collaboration with materials which were supposed to have been sent by Ambassador Talbott following the hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee on January 24, 1994. I thank my colleagues and yield the floor. There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From Time magazine, Apr. 3, 1989] America Abroad; How to Move the Immovable (By Strobe Talbott) Yitzhak Shamir personifies intransigence. Wherever he goes, even if it is just to his office in Jerusalem, he is attended by low expectations for Arab-Israeli diplomacy. Still, his visit to Washington next week could advance the cause of peace if his encounters with the American President, Congress and the Jewish community reinforce the message he has been getting back home: something has to give on the occupied territories. Shamir believes that Israel has a historic birthright to the lands it seized from Jordan in the 1967 War. After 21 years of Israeli rule and settlements in the West Bank, Palestinian Arabs still outnumber Jews there 16 to 1. For demographic reasons alone, it is hard to see how ``Greater'' Israel can remain a Jewish state and still be a true democracy. Nor is an Israel whose soldiers are ordered to break teenagers' bones the ``light unto the nations'' that its Zionist founders wanted. Not incidentally, those founders--David Ben-Gurion and Chaim Weizmann--detested the Stern Gang that was implicated in terrorist bombings and assassinations. Shamir was one of its most notorious members. If Israel refuses to budge on the West Bank, it could, over time, become just another Levantine war zone pretending to be a country, in which latter-day equivalents of the Stern Gang battle with the most extremist of the Palestinians. Like all other Administrations since 1967, the new leadership in Washington believes that Israel must at some point trade some of the West Bank for peace. The U.S. opened a dialogue with the P.L.O. last year because it hoped the organization was redefining the first two words of its name: the ``Palestine'' to be ``liberated'' is on the West Bank; it does not include pre-1967 Israel. As part of an eventual agreement, the U.S. is looking for reciprocal territorial concessions by Israel. But forcing the issue now will do no good and could do harm by giving Shamir an excuse to dig in his heels. Likud has consolidated its strength in recent local elections, so it would be folly to peg American diplomacy to the more pliable policies of the weakened Labor Party. Left to his own devices and instincts, Shamir would come to the U.S. with his jaw out, his dukes up and nothing in his pocket. The idea of a ``Shamir initiative'' sounds like a contradiction in terms. His preferred role is still that of defiant custodian of the status quo. But the status quo is untenable. That is the message Shamir has been getting not just from the Palestinian stone throwers but from their antagonists in the Israeli army as well. It is a reminder of the enduring humanism and idealism of the Zionist state that many of its warriors hate breaking bones and say so to their Prime Minister. So Shamir knows he needs to make a move, if only to escape the impression that he alone is standing still while events run beyond his control. He is expected to arrive with a proposal for elections among the Palestinians in the West Bank, followed by negotiations between those elected representatives and Israel. He wants to buy time by avoiding the question of whether Israeli withdrawal from--and Arab sovereignty over--the West Bank might someday be on the agenda of those negotiations. The Bush Administration will probably not insist that he bless the idea of territorial compromise in advance, but as his part of the bargain he had better not rule it out forever. That would probably be as much flexibility as the U.S. or the Arabs are likely to get out of this Israeli leader. But it might be enough to restart the diplomatic process; and perhaps that process will continue long enough for other Israeli statesmen to decide where it finally leads. ____ [From Time magazine, Aug. 20, 1990] America Abroad; The Dangers of Demonization (By Strobe Talbott) According to a perverse law of international politics, hard-liners on opposing sides tend to reinforce each other's stubbornness and influence, especially in times of tension. Consider the interaction between Baghdad and Jerusalem. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud government is hoping that Iraq's conquest of Kuwait will make it easier for Israel to retain possession of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Before the crisis broke, Shamir's Foreign Minister, David Levy, intended to visit Washington last week for what had promised to be a tough session. Secretary of State James Baker was prepared to bear down hard on the need to jump- start the peace process that Shamir let stall last spring. Both Bush and Congress have grown impatient with the Likud's ingenuity in finding excuses not to negotiate with the Palestinians. Levy's trip has now been postponed until early next month. Thanks to Saddam, Levy will probably find his American hosts less insistent on Israeli concessions. A full-scale confrontation in the Middle East makes this an inauspicious time for the U.S. to be pressuring its closest ally in the area. Besides, the Iraqi dictator's well-publicized embraces last week of Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat and the Precarious Little King of Jordan make it all the easier for hawkish Israelis to say: You expect us to deal with these people? The American answer to that question ought still to be yes. The Likud is using the current upheaval to underscore one reason for the Arab-Israeli conflict--the bellicosity and treacherousness of its radical neighbors--while obscuring another--Israeli intransigence and expansionism. As long as Israel refuses to budge from any of the occupied territory and as long as it continues to repress the Palestinians who live there, Israeli policy will be a source of instability; and the U.S., as Israel's friend and guardian, will pay a price in its ability to deal with Arabs of all stripes, moderates as well as radicals. Iraq's aggression has inflicted another, more subtle kind of collateral damage on the prospects for peace between Israel and the Arabs. No sooner had word of the attack reached the outside world than politicians, pundits and editorial cartoonists in the U.S. and Europe, including Germany--and particularly in Israel--were identifying Saddam with Adolf Hitler, and Kuwait in 1990 with Czechoslovakia in 1938. One purveyor of this parallel even found historical prototypes for King Hussein (Benito Mussolini) and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt (Neville Chamberlain). In the case of Saddam, the name-calling is far from preposterous. He has unleashed a blitzkrieg against a weak country on his border and committed mass murder--using poison gas, no less--on Iraq's Kurdish minority. But there is nonetheless something pernicious about the analogy. Regardless of how those making the comparison try to qualify its implications, there is a danger that many of their readers and listeners will, at least subliminally, take the point to its invidious extreme: Saddam equals Hitler, ergo Arabs equal Nazis. As a brutalizing corollary, the forces fighting the Jewish state, from P.L.O. commandos to the child warriors of the intifadeh, can too easily appear as agents of a new Holocaust. Saddam has done enough on his own to make the Middle East a more dangerous place than it was two weeks ago. His critics, in their justifiable outrage, should be careful not to feed, however inadvertently, the tendency that already exists on all sides in that region to demonize adversaries. ____ [From Time magazine, June 3, 1991] America Abroad: What Good Friends Are For (By Strobe Talbott) The U.S. has ``special relationships'' with half a dozen or so countries. Near the top of the list are Israel and Japan. The U.S. was instrumental in the founding of the Jewish state in 1948, and almost 6 million American Jews could be automatically entitled to citizenship there. The case of Japan is more ambiguous but no less special. The U.S. used A- bombs to finish off a militaristic empire, then helped rebuild what has become an economic superpower. Both relationships are strained these days. The Likud government's commitment to the de facto annexation of the occupied West Bank, hence to the open-ended subjugation of its Palestinian population, hinders the U.S.'s ongoing effort to broker a Middle East peace and jeopardizes Israel as a humane and democratic society. Ties between Tokyo and Washington are frayed as a result of bad American habits, notably an addiction to debt, as well as predatory Japanese trade practices. But if the U.S. is having trouble with both Israel and Japan, these two countries have had practically nothing to do with each other. Without ever admitting it was doing so, Japan has aided and abetted the Arabs in their 43-year-old economic boycott of Israel. The U.S., Canada and some countries in Western Europe have laws against companies' abiding by the boycott. The Japanese kept mumbling that they favored free trade, but that the ``private sector'' must make its own decisions on commercial grounds. In fact, there is no such thing as a private sector in Japan. Either that or there is nothing but the private sector. For years Japan Inc. has had a one-dimensional foreign policy: what's good for Japanese exports is good for Japan. Since there were many times more customers for Toyota and Nippon Steel in the Arab and Islamic worlds than in Israel, Japan abided by the boycott. That's begun to change. In April, Toyota announced it would sell cars directly to Israel. Nissan and Mazda are expected to follow. For the first time, Japan is adding a representative of the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry to the staff of its embassy in Israel. El Al is being allowed to open service between Tel Aviv and Tokyo (via Moscow). Israeli diplomats consider these moves to be modest and tentative but welcome nonetheless. American Jewish leaders and members of Congress have been lobbying hard for the staff. So, much more quietly, have some younger civil servants inside several Japanese ministries. They see their country's compliance with the boycott as symptomatic of the parochialism and selfishness that have until now marked Japan's definition of its role in the world. The Reagan and Bush administrations have helped too. Former Secretary of State George Shultz raised the issue repeatedly. James Baker and most of his senior deputies have done the same. During a meeting in California in April, President George Bush told Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu that the end of the gulf war ``might be an opportunity for Japan to have closer relations with Israel.'' Kaifu agreed, adding that the Arab boycott was ``undesirable.'' Vice President Dan Quayle, who met with Kaifu in Tokyo last week, pressed for more steps in the right direction. This story, while unfinished, already has a moral: the Japanese need gai-atsu, or outside pressure, almost as much as they resent it. By leaning hard on its friends in Tokyo, the U.S. is doing a favor for Japan as well as Israel. But, then, what else are special relationships for? ____ [From Time Magazine, Oct. 7, 1991] America Abroad; They Come Bearing Hope (By Strobe Talbott) When I visited Israel earlier this year, the night flight from Cairo taxied to a spot between two El Al jumbo jets that were already disgorging onto the tarmac a profusion of joyous, exhausted humanity. Standing in line for customs, I was engulfed by a sibilant jabber that I recognized from other journeys--to Moscow, Minsk, Kiev, Tbilisi, Tashkent, Baku, Irkutsk. The people around me were the latest of the 1 million immigrants from the U.S.S.R. who are expected to swell the Jewish population of Israel nearly 30% in the coming years. I've thought about them a lot in the past few weeks. In the short term, they're part of the problem that's poisoning Israel's relations with far-off American friends and diminishing the chances of peace with its nearby Arab enemies. The Likud government has been using the massive influx of Soviet Jews to justify a tripling in settlement activity in the occupied territories. Never mind that few of the new arrivals have any desire to live in the West Bank or Golan Heights; never mind that even though Israel is a small country, there's still plenty of undeveloped real estate inside the pre-1967 borders. Likud is bent on settling the territories to ensure their defacto annexation and preclude any exchange of land for peace. If Housing Minister Ariel Sharon had his way, the Trojan horse would be filled with immigrants speaking Russian. George Bush, quite rightly, doesn't want the U.S. to subsidize Sharon's operation. That's why Bush has asked Congress to hold off granting Israel $10 billion in loan guarantees to help in the ``absorption'' of the Soviet Jews. Bush's critics, in both Israel and the U.S., have accused him of playing a crude and cynical game with the immigrants, holding them hostage to his political objectives. It's the right charge, but it should be aimed at Sharon, not Bush. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is also dead set against conceding one square inch of the West Bank. Inaugurating a new settlement last week, he vowed that ``all our territories that can be built on will be populated by Jews to the end of the horizon.'' But at least Shamir is motivated by a sense of what he believes to be the historical birthright of his people. Sharon's goal, by contrast, has less to do with an ideological commitment to Greater Israel than with the aggrandizement of his personal power. His strategy, breathtakingly obvious and all too promising, seems to be to subvert the peace process, provoke a crisis with Washington and then elbow Shamir aside in the resulting Cabinet upheaval. For Sharon, the Soviet Jews have appeared at just the right moment. Desperate for somewhere to live, they're natural constituents of the Housing Minister. Many are easy recruits for Likud--if only because the alternative, the Labor party, files a red flag, celebrates May Day and has been known to sing the Internationale. Nonetheless, because they've come to stay, ``the Russians,'' as they're often called, may in the long run be part of the salvation of their new homeland. They joined the aliyah (literally, ``the ascent'') in order to move up in the world. They didn't leave an expansionist, totalitarian empire that repressed its minorities only to become citizens of a garrison state at war with its neighbors as well as with 1.7 million embittered, disfranchised and mutinous Palestinians. Nor are the Soviet Jews happy at the prospect of foundering in another bureaucratized, militarized, socialistic economy. They don't just need places to live--they need meaningful, productive jobs. Even if they bring nothing but what they can carry in two suitcases, they are rich in education, skill and ambition. Already there are enough doctors for a clinic on every corner, enough musicians for a string quartet in every apartment building and enough engineers and computer programmers for a booming, high-tech, export-oriented manufacturing sector on the order of Taiwan's or Singapore's. Yet Israel is too burdened by defense spending and too isolated internationally, especially in its own region, to take advantage of the infusion of human capital that the Soviets Jews represent. Writing last April in the weekly magazine the Jerusalem Report, Natan Sharansky, a former prisoner of conscience in the U.S.S.R. and a leading spokesman for Soviet Jews, complained that ``in the existing stagnant economic and political system, there is no place for the enormous energy the immigrants bring with them.'' Unless Israel develops an ``open economy,'' he warned, the Zionist dream itself will be in jeopardy. Sharansky picked up that theme again in the latest issue of the Report: ``Whether this exodus will become a great blessing or a terrible burden for our country depends on how our government meets the challenge.'' Sooner or later, Israel will face a stark choice: either it can have Arab lands or it can have Arab markets; either it can absorb the West Bank or it can absorb the Soviet Jews. Last week several planeloads of newcomers arrived at Ben- Gurion Airport. Fortunately, most of them will be around a lot longer than Sharon and Shamir. Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first, I would like to say to the Senator from Ohio, who I see has left the floor, I apologize if I inconvenienced him. The fact is I had asked for a specific amount of time and I had asked earlier today if I could address the Senate at this particular time. I am more than agreeable for the Senator from Ohio to proceed after I conclude my remarks, but since we are on the Talbott nomination, that is the subject of my remarks and I had asked for this particular time and it had been agreed to, it is my understanding, by both sides. I would prefer to proceed with my remarks and then, if the Senator from Ohio wishes to address the Senate as in morning business, that would be perfectly agreeable to me. I hope there is no misunderstanding or inconvenience. Mr. President, last spring I addressed the Senate in opposition to the confirmation of Strobe Talbott to serve as Ambassador at Large and Special Adviser to the Secretary of State for the New Independent States. My opposition was based on my grave concern that as a statesman, Ambassador Talbott would exercise the same flawed judgment about urgent matters of State that he consistently demonstrated as a journalist. At the time, I explained my opposition in the following terms: My opposition is neither partisan nor personal. I take no pleasure in denying support to the President's choice for this critically important post. I am aware that Mr. Talbott is a close friend of the President, and I am generally disposed to defer to the Commander in Chief's choice of personnel to implement his foreign policy. But if I find a nominee's judgment to be consistently in error on questions of such great importance to our national security as I have found to be the case with Mr. Talbott, then I cannot in good conscience vote to confirm his appointment. I suspected that Ambassador Talbott's flawed judgment, consequential as a policy analyst, would prove even more important as a policymaker. Mr. President, I take no satisfaction in saying that Ambassador Talbott's record in office over the last 9 months has confirmed my original concern. Thus, I must again voice my strong opposition to the nomination of Strobe Talbott, this time to an even more important office, Deputy Secretary of State, an office where Ambassador Talbott's proclivity for zealously defending one's thesis beyond the bounds of logic and truth and wisdom will potentially endanger our national interests in a much larger area of the globe than he has heretofore had the opportunity to effect. Frankly, I find alarming the prospect that Ambassador Talbott could possess the same ability to influence our policy in Korea that he has had with regard to our policies in Europe and the former Soviet Union. While I am under no illusion that a majority of my colleagues will join me in opposing this nomination, I would caution Senators to consider very carefully the unfortunate parallels between Ambassador Talbott's record as a journalist and his record as a policymaker before voting to confirm him. In my previous statement, I quoted generously from Ambassador Talbott's many essays for Time magazine to support my contention that while he occasionally responded by modifying his reasoning for finding fault in United States policies toward the Soviet Union, he never waivered in his conclusions. More often than not, his conclusions found the policies of Presidents Reagan and Bush toward the Soviet Union to be reckless, dangerously simple minded, unnecessarily provocative, and ultimately counterproductive. Throughout the last decade, Ambassador Talbott challenged virtually every Reagan-Bush initiative to counter the Soviet threat, arguing variously that anti-Soviet diplomacy and rhetoric from Washington only undermined Soviet reformers; that United States positions in arms control negotiations would never be accepted by the Kremlin; that the Soviets would match any United States defense buildup, be they offensive or defensive weapons. When subsequent developments discredited Mr. Talbott's opinions, he quickly dismissed the accomplishments of Reagan and Bush policies by either questioning the value of the accomplishment or by rejecting the relevance of U.S. policies to these developments. When the Soviets acceded to the terms of the INF Treaty, Talbott questioned whether the elimination of an entire class of nuclear weapons in Europe was a result ``we should have asked for? And do we want it now?'' When the Soviet Union not only failed to match the U.S. defense buildup but collapsed while trying to do so, when one Soviet reformer was replaced by an even more ambitious reformer, Mr. Talbott refused to credit the containment policies of 40 years with that singular achievement. Instead, he chastised the ``hawks'' of the cold war debate for consistently overestimating Soviet strength and attributing the Soviet system's collapse solely to its own inadequacies and defects. Mr. President, I wonder if Ambassador Talbott could identify those cold war hawks who exaggerated Soviet strength more often than he did as he dismissed everything from cruise missiles to Pershing II's to SDI as feckless provocations of Soviet fears of encirclement, provocations which the Soviets would ultimately overcome? Why did not Ambassador Talbott consider the inadequacies and defects of the Soviet system when he reckoned Soviet military might to be impervious to the puny efforts of the West to correct the cold war balance of power? ``The doves in the great debate of the past 40 years were right all along,'' Ambassador Talbott wrote in 1990. But who among Ambassador Talbott's doves concurred with Ronald Reagan's 1982 address to the British Parliament envisioning the West's triumph over the Soviet threat in our lifetime? Who among them shared President Reagan's belief that ``a new age is not only possible but probable.'' Who among these visionary doves did not wince when Ronald Reagan brought a little honesty to the cold war debate accurately describing the nature of the Soviet empire as evil? Who among them truly believed that as Lech Walesa scaled the wall of the Gdansk shipyards he in effect breached the fortifications of the Soviet empire? Who among them thought Vaclav Havel, and every other courageous East European who braved the imperial wrath of the Kremlin could by their courage restore their national sovereignty? Who among them grasped the real power of one dissident, one Sakharov, one Shcharansky, one refusenik to defy the prerogatives of the police state and hasten its collapse? I do not fault Ambassador Talbott for not envisioning the demise of the Soviet Union. Only a few people possessed such wisdom, and I was certainly not among their number. But I do fault Ambassador Talbott for claiming after the fact that the doves of the great debate, among whom we can include Ambassador Talbott, saw it coming all along and hastened its arrival. He could have spared a few words of praise for Soviet dissidents, for Solidarity, for Afghan rebels, for the people of Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Lithuania and every captive nation where good triumphed over evil. And he could have given a little of the credit to those Western statesmen--those hawks--who had the honesty to call evil evil, the wisdom to see its defeat, and the courage to proclaim it before it happened. Mr. President, I will return to Ambassador Talbott's opinions as a commentator on foreign policy later in my remarks. But I would now like to examine his record as a statesman, a record I find to be just as flawed as his record as a journalist. ``Less shock, more therapy.'' It is ironic that a prolific writer like Ambassador Talbott has come to be associated with that pithy remark more than any other. Perhaps it is the price a journalist pays when he enters government service. One learns that musing out loud is a risky hobby when every day dozens of foreign embassies report back to their governments every utterance of senior American officials. Being cavalier in one's remarks is a luxury which statesmen should not share with journalists. I suspect Ambassador Talbott understands that rule better now that he has had to endure considerable criticism for uttering his clever, but reckless prescription for Russian reform. But utter it, he did. And the criticism he has received for it has been deserved. The most powerful criticism came from a leading Russian reformer former Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov, as he left the Yeltsin government. According to Fyodorov, Ambassador Talbott had ``stabbed Russian reform in the back.'' I asked Ambassador Talbott about that criticism in a question I submitted for the record at his confirmation hearing. He responded by saying that his remark had been ``widely misinterpreted,'' and that he had merely meant that reform should be ``pursued in a way that alleviates the social pain caused by the transition from a command economy to a market economy.'' He went on to stress the importance of controlling inflation in Russia and that he understood Fyodorov's ``frustration with the events of recent months.'' Finally, he boldly stated that the Clinton administration's support for Fyodorov's cause ``is beyond question.'' Well, Mr. Fyodorov saw fit to question it, along with former Deputy Prime Minister Gaidar and other Russian reformers. With President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Secretary Christopher, Ambassador Talbott, and much of the administration's Russian policy team in Moscow last month, I would think that reformers like Gaidar and Fyodorov could have had their concerns about United States support for serious reform assuaged. Why was it that the President and Ambassador Talbott, two very articulate and persuasive men, were not able to correct Fyodorov's misinterpretation of Talbott's remark? I suspect it is because they had cause to believe that Ambassador Talbott's remark correctly indicated that the pace and extent of reform has become less important to the administration. Surely, United States assistance can address some of the dislocation that precedes real economic and political reform. But, in political campaign parlance--which I am sure this administration understands--the United States should never get off message in its insistence to Moscow that urgent, systemic reform is the quickest way out of Russia's current mess. Most of that mess has not been caused by rapid economic changes, but by half-hearted efforts to privatize huge state-run industries, and control inflation. Recently, Ambassador Talbott explained that United States assistance can continue even if IMF assistance cannot. He went on to say that a ``major goal of our assistance program is the development of `islands of success' at the regional and local levels, with the hope that these islands will have a spillover effect into less reform-minded areas.'' That is all well and good, but United States assistance will not be very effective without the macroeconomics reforms that Moscow now seems to fear. If the Russian Central Bank doesn't quit printing rubles, national economic chaos will overwhelm any ``island of success.'' Admittedly, some of the administration's rhetoric in recent weeks has stressed their commitment to promoting real reform in Russia. Unfortunately, all too often in the administration's foreign policies there has been a yawning chasm between rhetoric and action. I will judge their commitment by their deeds and not their words. Ambassador Talbott's admonition notwithstanding, until such time that I have evidence of a sustained administration insistence on urgent, systemic economic reform in Russia, I will continue to have questions about that commitment. Other criticisms have been leveled at the administration and Ambassador Talbott in particular for developing aid programs that leave other former Soviet republics waiting for the table scraps left over from our generous assistance to Russia. And I also note the concerns raised by the chairman and ranking Republican of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senators Leahy and McConnell, who have complained about the lack of a coherent strategy to guide our aid program. The most distressing recent manifestation of Ambassador Talbott's preoccupation with Kremlin sensitivities is the administration's Partnership for Peace proposal. This proposal in effect denies NATO membership to the Visegrad countries, offering them instead membership in a sort of junior auxiliary where the terms and requirements of their association with NATO have been left deliberately vague. The Wall Street Journal credits Ambassador Talbott with almost single-handedly preventing an offer of provisional NATO membership to Eastern Europe's new democracies because the move would feed Russian paranoia and weaken Mr. Yeltsin. Mr. President, the United States should substantially assist the political and economic transformation of Russia. But we should work just as hard at preparing for the consequences of failure as we do pursuing the benefits of success. We should make clear to Russia that we appreciate the importance of Russian stability to our own security. But we should make equally clear to Russia that we are free to pursue all opportunities for enhancing our security and that of our allies. Why should the United States forgo opportunities to expand the frontiers of NATO ever further from the plains of Germany while Russia feels free to meddle in the affairs of newly independent nations on its borders--a meddling which, by and large, has been tacitly tolerated by the Clinton administration? A Harvard University report released last January concluded that ``the U.S. is acquiescing in the de facto reconstitution of the U.S.S.R. by turning its head as Russia maneuvers its way back into the affairs of all its former republics.'' Giving the Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Hungarians and others a date certain for NATO membership should they meet a specific set of political and economic conditions is sound security policy and morally right. NATO is and always has been a defensive alliance. That Russia should fear encirclement by a security guarantee to the Czech republic is absurd. Talbott's narrow concern with Moscow--a concern which one journalist has described as ``yielding'' to rather than confronting the Kremlin-- has begun to attract greater criticism. Duke University Russian scholar Jerry Hough described Talbott's views as ``extraordinarily dubious and dangerous.'' Richard Haas calls them ``unrealistic,'' and Zbigniew Brzezinski contends that Talbott suffers from a ``Russocentric obsession which is troubling.'' Lately, journalist Morton Kondrake, as well as former Bush administration foreign policy professionals such as Robert Zoellick and Brent Scowcroft, and a great many other observers have raised concerns about that obsession as well. Mr. President, I want to touch on another concern which has recently been raised about the nominee. I believe other Senators will address Ambassador Talbott's writings about the United States/Israel relationship in greater detail, but I want to register my concern over the tone and substance of some of those writings. I understand that quotes lifted from larger essays can magnify the import of those quotes beyond the author's intention. In fairness, some of the quotes which have been cited recently, when read in context, are qualified somewhat. However, the nature of many of these opinions, read in or out of context, substantially exceed that Ambassador Talbott described as ``provocative.'' They are insulting, immature, and incorrect. In a 1981 article entitled: ``What to Do About Israel,'' Talbott contended that: ``Israel was well on its way to becoming not just a dubious asset but an outright liability.'' Ambassador Talbott now claims that his thinking about the value of the United States/Israeli relationship has evolved, and that the opinion expressed in that article was wrong. I will leave it to others to determine whether Talbott's mea culpa constitutes the real thing or just a confirmation conversion. I must admit that, at a minimum, I find his retraction to be refreshing since it is one of the rare occasions I know of when Ambassador Talbott has conceded that he is capable of making mistakes in judgment. Both Democrat and Republican members of the Foreign Relations Committee expressed their concern over the insensitivity of many of Ambassador Talbott's writings on United States/Israel relations. Often cited was Ambassador Talbott's 1990 essay, entitled, ``How Israel is like Iraq,'' drawing some comparisons between Yitzak Shamir and Saddam Hussein. Talbott wrote that ``Shamir's talk of a greater Israel is as ominous for the prospects of there ever being real and lasting peace in the region as Saddam's militant nostalgia for Nebuchadnezzar's Babylonian empire.'' He went on to assert that ``Ariel Sharon is busily creating new facts in the form of Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Saddam too is in the new facts business with his systematic obliteration of Kuwaiti nationhood.'' Again to be fair, Talbott did draw distinctions between Israel and Iraq in that article, and he has also recently apologized for the comparisons he did draw characterizing them as ``invidious.'' Indeed they were. Another Talbott comment that distressed a good many people was his reference to Israel's meddling in American politics and his description of Menachem Begin's appreciation for the political influence that the American Jewish community wielded being ``far beyond their numbers.'' I do not accuse Ambassador Talbott of antisemitism. But as many other Senators pointed out to Ambassador Talbott such characterizations of Jewish political influence quite often find their way into the most despicable antisemitic tracts. Mr. President, I do not know Mr. Talbott personally nor am I trained in psychoanalysis. My speculation on why Ambassador Talbott, in Dr. Brzezinski's words, has a ``Russocentric obsession'' would be purely subjective. Suffice it to say that in both his journalistic and government careers, Talbott has manifested such an obsession, an obsession which has often been at odds with the national interest. To illustrate that point let me cite two quotes about SDI, the first is from a 1983 column by Ambassador Talbott. He wrote: If the U.S. tried to erect the sort of protective umbrella Reagan has in mind, the Soviet Union would suspect that the U.S. was seeking the capability of destroying the USSR with impunity. To forestall that, the Soviets would no doubt accelerate their own already considerable research into defensive weapons, while simultaneously refining their offensive weapons in order to ``beat'' or ``penetrate'' whatever ABM system the U.S. devises. In that sense, the worst sin against strategic sensibility is a good defense-- particularly the kind of ``prevent defense'' Reagan has in mind. Now, let me quote a far more astute analyst of the Soviet regime, Alexander Solzhenitsyn: The Cold War was essentially won by Ronald Reagan when he embarked on the ``star wars'' program and the Soviet Union understood that it could not take the next step. Ending the Cold War had nothing to do with Gorbachev's generosity; he was compelled to end it. He had no choice but to disarm. Mr. President, in recent years a great many former Soviet officials have corroborated Solzhenitsyn's view that SDI and the Reagan defense buildup helped force the Soviet Union into bankruptcy and greatly accelerated the break up of the Soviet Empire and the democratic reforms underway in Russia today. In response to questions during his confirmation process, Ambassador Talbott allowed that he had a social relationship with a Mr. Victor Louis, an established disinformation agent for the KGB who long masqueraded as a journalist. Ambassador Talbott has maintained that irrespective of Victor Louis' covert assignment to spread Soviet disinformation through the articles of unsuspecting Western journalists, Louis never influenced Mr. Talbott's work. I will take Ambassador Talbott at his word. However, I could also observe that given Ambassador Talbott's facility as a journalist to embrace a considerable variety of Soviet diplomatic strategies, Victor Louis might have seen no further need to use Ambassador Talbott's columns as vehicles for Soviet propaganda. Mr. President, I have taken up a considerable amount of the Senate's time, and I will conclude my remarks in a moment. In closing, let me stress my primary concern about this nominee. I have no doubt that Ambassador Talbott is an intelligent, industrious, and dedicated public servant. But it is my belief that Ambassador Talbott lacks sound judgment about most of the critical foreign policy questions of our time. I have found sufficient evidence of this failing in Ambassador Talbott's record as a journalist and his record in government. Until his recent retraction of remarks about Israel, I knew of no occasion when Ambassador Talbott had admitted making an error in judgment despite the fact that many of his expressed opinions about Russia, and United States policy toward the Soviet Union have been thoroughly discredited by other more experienced observers and by subsequent historical developments. This, then, is my greatest concern about Strobe Talbott. A person so reluctant to admit error when confronted with abundant evidence of his bad judgment is probably incapable of learning from his mistakes. This is an irritating failing in a journalism. It is a very dangerous attribute in a statesman. This flaw alone provides the Senate with sufficient justification to reject this nomination and I strongly urge my colleagues to do so. Senator PELL addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from Washington is recognized. Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do note that my friend from Illinois, Senator Simon, has been here for some time. How much time is he going to use? Mr. SIMON. If I could have 3 minutes, I would appreciate it. Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, without losing my right to the floor, I am delighted to yield to my friend from Illinois. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Illinois? Mr. PELL. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] is recognized for 3 minutes. Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Strobe Talbott has written some things that I wish he had not written. Strobe Talbott has written some things that he wishes he had not written. Part of being a journalist is you write a great deal--sometimes with wisdom; sometimes lacking it. Part of being a public official is we speak a great deal. I am sure if someone went back over the speeches of Paul Simon, you will find some things that I wish I had not said. That might even be true of the Senator from Colorado or the Senator from Rhode Island or the Senator from Washington or the Senator from Arizona. But the question is: First, does he have the basic skills and ability to be a good Deputy Secretary of State? I think he does. That is my judgment. I have worked with him on some things. The second question, and a very sensitive one and an important one: Does he harbor an attitude toward Israel that has some tone that should not be there? I was interested in his response to the questions from Senator Helms and Senator Biden. My judgment is that he has learned in this process; he has learned about our concerns; he is going to be more sensitive; he is going to be helpful in the Middle East situation and not harmful; and we would be wise to follow the President's recommendation and advise and consent to his nomination. Sometimes we learn through mistakes. That is true for all of us. I think Strobe Talbott has learned that he has to be more careful and that some things can be misinterpreted. The very basic question is: Is there any touch of anti-Semitism in his background? I do not think there is. I think we are not taking any huge gamble by approving the President's recommendation. Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized. Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do not frequently vote against Presidential nominees who serve at the pleasure of the President. Barring unusual circumstances, I believe the President should be allowed to pick whoever he believes can best serve his administration, particularly in his capacity as Commander in Chief. Last April, however, I voted not to confirm Strobe Talbott as Ambassador at Large to the New Independent States. I based this decision on the only evidence of his character available to the Senate at that time, his writings. Because Mr. Talbott had written some 150 articles between 1980 and the early 1990's, and, because for most of that time I had been one of his readers, I considered myself qualified to evaluate him fairly. On the issue of United States policy toward the Soviet Union--Ambassador Talbott's area of expertise--he was wrong on a great majority of the major decisions made by the Reagan and Bush administrations, decisions that won the endgame of the cold war and led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Mr. Talbott began the 1980's by expressing his agreement with the Reagan administration on a number of assumptions about the Soviet Union. He saw its threat with a clear eye, finding it not only recently enlarged but dangerously active. In 1982, he reported Soviet military that was ``at least as powerful as the United States in some respects and more powerful in others,'' and a Soviet foreign policy that, ``when the United States was shrinking from overseas commitments because of Vietnam, * * * was busy making mischief, on its own and by proxy, in Africa, Indochina and Central America.'' But by 1983 Mr. Talbott began to oppose Reagan policies aimed to meet that threat. His positions were based on arms control policies rather than military buildup, and included opposition to the Strategic Defense Initiative, to increased funding for advanced technologies, and to President Reagan's zero option initiative on intermediate missiles in Europe. On SDI, he wrote: If the U.S. tried to erect the sort of protective umbrella Reagan has in mind, the Soviet Union would suspect that the U.S. was seeking the capability of destroying the U.S.S.R. with impunity. To forestall that, the Soviets would no doubt accelerate their own already considerable research into defensive weapons, while simultaneously refining their offensive weapons in order to ``beat'' or ``penetrate'' whatever ABM system the U.S. devises. In that sense, the worst sin against strategic stability is a good defense. Let me delete some words in that last sentence to convey the essence of Mr. Talbott's thinking in the very area of foreign policy for which we are asked to confirm him: ``The worst sin * * * is a good defense.'' Two years later he capitulated completely writing: If Reagan holds firm on Star Wars, he might as well abandon the pursuit of drastic reductions in existing Soviet weaponry. In fact, the Reagan administration did achieve major arms cuts, and former Soviet officials later acknowledged SDI to be a realistic proposal that improved our negotiating position. On the issues of advanced technologies, such as the Tomahawk cruise missile, Mr. Talbott opposed increased funding not only because he saw no need for them, but because they would slow progress in arms control talks. In 1983, he wrote: One of the burdens under which the administration's arms- control negotiators are laboring is an injunction not to trade away or even accept, significant limitations on weapons systems where the U.S. has a technological edge. For example, microelectronics and precision guidance put the U.S. cruise missile program well ahead of the U.S.S.R.'s. As a result, cruise missiles have been declared virtually out of bounds for restrictions under START. This faith in technology as the solution to the country's military problems may be both forgetful about the past and shortsighted about the future. In fact, these claims were unfounded: Tomahawk cruise missiles were later subject to a successful arms control agreement with the Soviet Union. Furthermore, less than a decade after his comments, the very missiles that he labelled ``shortsighted,'' rapidly accelerated our victory in the Gulf war. Finally, Mr. Talbott devoted an entire book to denouncing President Reagan's attempt to obtain a zero option agreement. He preferred a deal in which the United States would deploy fewer Pershing II's and allow the Soviets to keep some of their heavy SS-20's, all the while considering the zero option unrealistic and grandstanding. He wrote: ``[In Reagan's opinion,] as No. 2, the United States must try harder; it must build up while the Soviet Union scales down. That is the premise on which both his START and INF theories are based, and it is dubious.'' Yet, the United States signed an INF agreement accomplishing the zero option initiative 5 years later, this one removing 850 United States weapons in return for 1,750 Soviet missiles stationed not only in Europe, but in Asia as well. Mr. Talbott was dead wrong on three of the fundamental decisions of the cold war, and as the New Republic put it, ``knew that Reagan's bold and rudely moralistic rhetoric and the sanctions linked to human rights attacked the Soviet Union as its weakest point: Its political illegitimacy. And for precisely that reason he opposed them.'' All of Mr. Talbott's flawed suggestions and predictions, however, might well be forgiven if he had had the grace to admit to and learn from his mistakes. After all, an ability to reevaluate the collapse of the Soviet Union would be one of the most valuable assets of an Ambassador at Large. But after the cold war was won, Mr. Talbott insisted that only the inherent weakness of the Soviet system was responsible for our victory, and that President Reagan's military buildup was unnecessary. In 1990, he wrote: A new consensus is emerging, that the Soviet threat is not what it used to be. The real point, however, is that it never was. The doves in the great debate of the past 40 years were right all along. Yet, I can find no instance of Mr. Talbott predicting the imminent fall of the Soviet Union. Rather, 1982, he said: It would be wishful thinking to predict that international communism someday will either self-destruct or so exhaust itself in internecine conflict that other nations will no longer be threatened. He goes on to say that-- The sorry state of morale and well-being [in the east bloc] do not automatically mean the imminent demise of the system, at least in the U.S.S.R. Mr. Talbott did not predict the Soviet Union's demise until after it happened. Instead of reflecting on his mistaken analysis, Mr. Talbott attempted to rewrite history. He said: If the Soviet Union had ever been as strong as the threatmongers believed, it would not be undergoing its current upheavals. Those events are actually a repudiation of the hawkish conventional wisdom that has largely prevailed over the past 40 years. Mr. Talbott apparently believes that the Soviet collapse discredits not just the Reagan and Bush military policies, put the entire post- World War II policy of containment. Nor would he allow that forcing the Soviet Union to spend 20 to 25 percent of its GNP on defense might have helped bring about its dissolution. While I may be biased with respect to President Reagan's Soviet policy, former Soviet leaders cannot be. Two years ago, President Yeltsin stood in this Capitol to thank the Reagan and Bush administrations for their policies toward the Soviet Union, admitting that they contributed to the second Russian revolution. Mr. Talbott's inability to recognize this truth was perhaps the greatest indictment of his suitability for the ambassadorship: if he could not correctly evaluate the forces that toppled communism, I believed, he was unlikely to appreciate the complicated forces that threaten a tenuous Russian reform. That failure argues with equal weight against his promotion. Today, however, as we consider Ambassador Talbott for Deputy Secretary of State, we must examine his writings not only in regard to Russia, but with respect to the rest of the world as well. The most disturbing, no doubt, are the product of a 1981 article titled, ``What To Do About Israel,'' in which Mr. Talbott joined the chorus of those who doubt the strategic worth of Israel to the United States. He wrote: The sad fact is that Israel is well on its way to becoming not just a dubious asset but an outright liability to American security interests, both in the Middle East and worldwide. The implications of that statement are devastating. If the United States ceases to consider Israel a strategic ally, Israel may very well cease to exist. Moreover, Mr. Talbott made this statement 12 years ago. Since then, his predictions that Israel--a nation that at our request turned its cheek to Saddam Hussein's Scuds, and that has boldly embraced a dangerous peace process--have proven completely groundless. In other articles, Mr. Talbott compared Israel's administration of the West Bank to Iraq's pillaging of Kuwait, and suggested that the United States condition aid to Israel on progress in the peace talks. During his hearings, Ambassador Talbott said he had simply changed his mind, that he now considered Israel a strategic ally that should not be pressured to make concessions in the peace process. Yet he also said that he made the comments because he knew ``what was good for [Israel].'' It is this same assumption that State Department officials know better than Israel what is in Israel's best interests that too often taints the administration's policies toward the Mideast peace process. After President Clinton's meeting with President Assad, Charles Krauthammer wrote: The administration expects Israel to respond with radical territorial concessions to satisfy Assad. The heat is on. Such pressure ultimately works against our interests. The concession that the administration asks of Israel is the Golan Heights from which someday may come a devastating Syrian offensive. In exchange, Syria has allegedly offered normal diplomatic ties, while remaining vague about the numerous steps required to achieve them. Israel should pursue these negotiations only to the extent that it benefits her well-being. Our role, in turn, is not to serve Syria, or Jordan, or even the Palestinians. Israel is our most important and stable ally in the region, and the party with the most to lose. If Ambassador Talbott is to serve our interests in the peace talks as Deputy Secretary of State, his views toward Israel will, indeed, need to have changed dramatically since 1981. Mr. President, again unlike the situation 10 months ago when we last considered Mr. Talbott's ability to serve the Department of State, we now have his record. Indeed, we have the record of the entire Department of State. I find it bewildering that the administration has chosen someone with little managerial experience for a post that requires enormous managerial skill, in an agency which has been consistently criticized for its inability to reorganize itself. On this issue alone, I believe the Ambassador's nomination invites serious skepticism. But even more relevant is an emerging Russian policy that bears a striking resemblance to Ambassador Talbott's views on the possibilities of Russian reform, and its potential threat to former Warsaw Pact nations. The most disturbing aspect of this policy is its effect on the enlargement of NATO membership--an issue on which the Ambassador's views have held sway over Secretary Christopher. Just as in the cold war, Mr. Talbott prefers a course that minimizes conflict with Russia, the places all the eggs in his basket on that nation's willingness and ability to reform. In January, he wrote in the Boston Globe that Russia's economic reform was stabilizing. Days later two of its prominent leaders resigned, undercut by Mr. Talbott's flip comment that the Russian election called for less shock and more therapy and the Russian Prime Minister said he was considering wage and price controls. Russian officials, meanwhile, claim their right to stabilize the near-abroad, while interfering in Georgia, Azerbaijan, and other neighboring republics, and Mr. Zhirinovsky brandishes a map which places much of Europe, not to mention Alaska, under Russian control. Even so, the United States has not developed a strategy for protecting Eastern European nations. Part of the problem is a policy that has focused too narrowly on furthering Russian reform, and has interpreted that effort as including the appeasement of, rather than confrontation with, Russian nationalism. While I support our efforts to promote reform in Russia, we should realize that our attempts to affect Russia's internal struggles can be only marginally effective. Everything so far--from aid, to public shows of support, to overlooking violations of democratic practice--had no influence on December election returns in which totalitarian forces won nearly half the vote. We should proceed with an understanding that Russia's fate is almost entirely in Russia's hands, and that its democratic neighbors need the promise of security. Our current policy not only ignores the security of nations clearly dedicated to democracy, free markets and the West; it encourages Russian nationalism. In effect, we have given Russian nationalism a veto on the enlargement of NATO membership. Given this deference, what else will Russia soon be demanding? Almost certainly portions of President Yeltsin's foreign policy, with a renewed understanding that Eastern Europe, not to mention support of the Serb position in the Balkan conflict, remain within their sphere of influence. In fact, the proper way to deal with these nationalists is by including the Eastern Europeans in NATO at the first opportunity. Since its inception in 1949, NATO has acted as a purely defensive entity; it has had no role but to protect its members from the threat of attack and to support stability in the region. The President should be capable of explicitly stating that, while offering no threat to the Russians, the United States supports the entrance of stable, democratic Eastern European nations into NATO. The creation and history of NATO is the only justification he needs. If this is not persuasive, he should ask what threat the Russians perceive in the armies of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. The people of Poland live in a nation whose boundaries have shifted east and west on half a dozen occasions over 200 or 300 years, always as a result of aggression from a more powerful nation. It has been literally partitioned out of existence on four separate occasions. Are the Poles a threat? Can their actions be considered provocative? To ask these questions is to answer them. We have allowed artificial concerns to become overriding. Henry Kissinger recently reminded us in the Washington Post of Dean Acheson's quote in regard to Soviet fears of NATO: ``the guilty flee where no man pursueth.'' For the Eastern European countries, the administration has unfortunately created a Partnership for Peace Project that provides no clear requirements, and no timetable, for enlarging membership in NATO. This project, whose chief purpose was to mollify nations hoping to join NATO, was called by the Polish Prime Minister a buzz-off. Contrary to Mr. Talbott's suggestion in 1992, that, ``It is time to think seriously about eventually retiring the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,'' that alliance is central to the future of Eastern Europe's stability. In fact, NATO's relevance depends on its expansion east. The President has said it, the Europeans have said it, Boris Yeltsin said it in August, and most importantly for the purposes of this nomination, the U.S. Senate has said it with a 94 to 3 vote in favor of a resolution urging enlarged NATO membership as soon as possible. That was an easy vote, a sense of the Senate resolution, as certain not to offend the administration as it was to be ignored by it. But if those Senators seriously propose to advance the recommendations of that amendment, they should vote against this nomination. It's Ambassador Talbott who brought us the Partnership for Peace, and it is the rejection of his nomination that will effectively deliver on our January 27 sentiments. Eastern Europe, Mr. President, is just one region in which I consider our current foreign policy to be dangerously misdirected. As we look around the world, we see others in which we are engaged in fruitless diplomacy, or are risking our uniformed men and women without clear objectives. None of these policies will be much improved, in my opinion, by moving Ambassador Talbott to the Deputy Secretary of State position. For a year, North Korea has refused the International Atomic Energy Agency's request to inspect two locations believed to contain plutonium. In that time, the United States has relied solely on diplomacy to win North Korean compliance, and has avoided any confrontation with the North Korean Government, either by the IAEA or the United Nations Security Council itself. In June, the administration offered the North Koreans new political and economic ties if they would agree to maintain the continuity of the IAEA safeguards, a phrase which by itself allows North Korea to avoid inspections of the two sites under question. Predictably, the Koreans did not agree, but demanded until last Tuesday that the IAEA inspect only portions of the other seven of the nine acknowledged sites. We have moved no closer to attaining access to the two clandestine sites, forcing the President to back off on a November pledge that North Korea cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb. The cost of these failures is too high: a North Korea with nuclear capability will destabilize the entire region, spur rearmament, and threaten the region's economic development. It also seriously jeopardizes South Korea, and the 37,000 American troops stationed there. The United States must either stop making concessions to Kim-Il Sung, and firmly demand North Korean compliance with the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty with a threat of possible military destruction of its key nuclear sites, or candidly admit that the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is dead, not only in Korea, but in every other bandit nation around the world. Instead, the President has delivered an ultimatum to the Serbs. Admittedly, Sunday's gambit appears to have succeeded: Sarajevo's 380,000 residents now enjoy immediate relief from the daily artillery and mortar shelling--for which the President deserves credit. But we are unwilling to extend our protection to other Bosnian communities, the atrocities which are not covered by CNN. Nor would the actual use of our air power and its inevitable American casualties, be likely to bring the conflict to an end. Finally, in return for a limited cessation of Serb atrocities, we are now attempting to enforce a partition on the Bosnians which just a few months ago we denounced as unjust and incapable of producing a viable Bosnian nation. In other words, we are now willing to ratify the results of Serbian aggression. If the administration wishes to establish its leadership and make good on its sentiments, it should prevail upon the Europeans to lift the misdirected arms embargo or do so unilaterally. As recently as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan we provided profoundly billions of dollars in aid to people with whom we disagreed except for their desire to be free and independent. Yet, we have accepted the notion that Bosnia's citizens were not entitled to fight for their own independence with arms secured not just from the United States, but from anyplace in the world. The result has been an immoral policy, superficially evenhanded but on the ground overwhelmingly favorable to Serb aggressors. If there is to be true peace in Bosnia, it will need to be forged on the ground by the Bosnians. A similar sentiment must have driven the President's Somalia policy. First, the decision to adopt the U.N. policy of nation-building there, and his decision in October to keep U.S. troops in Mogadishu in spite of mounting casualties, suggested an overvaluation of our ability to restore peace and democracy on the cheap in a country totally unwilling to accept them. The troops now there could have returned home in October after the failed raid, or earlier in May when we adopted nation-building responsibilities, and left behind the same conditions we will leave in March. Last week, the Washington Post reported that clan warfare is erupting daily in Mogadishu, and, even more disturbingly, in southern towns like Kismayoo and Baidoa, which for more than a year have been considered secure. The Post went on to say: The latest surge in violence raises questions about exactly what the costly 14-month-long Western military intervention in Somalia has achieved. Instead of resolving the problem of warfare, clan violence and banditry that led to widespread famine and prompted the international community to send troops to relieve the starving, the intervention seems only to have placed Somalis' fighting on hold. Now that fragile peace appears to be breaking down, Somalis are returning to settle old scores. No doubt future generations will look back upon this intervention and debate whether we left too early. The fact is, we left too late--and were wrong to enter at all. We never had an attainable objective clear enough to warrant our intervention. It was an intervention caused and maintained by television. Mr. President, every foreign crisis deserves to be examined individually. Each requires a unique response--which makes it difficult to determine exactly how and why an administration has faltered. But disturbing patterns have emerged from the Clinton administration: A willingness to commit forces--or allow them to linger--in areas where we have neither a vital national interest nor a clear objective. And perhaps more importantly a heavy reliance on fruitless diplomacy, and faith in the promises of potential adversaries to reform, when clearly action is required. The United States must at times use force, and just as importantly, lead. We are blessed today by being the world's only superpower at a time when many of our former enemies are attempting democratic reform. This is a historic opportunity, which we can seize only if we act decisively and without fear, and properly use our influence. Throughout the cold war, Ambassador Talbott argued that the United States should not attempt to win. In his current post, he has helped forge a policy that appeases Russia's least savory elements, while turning his back on democratic states in Eastern Europe. Now, that style of management is to be applied to all of the responsibilities of the Department of State. As the New Republic put it, Talbott's assignment is to give the administration's floundering statecraft a new direction and a more polished spokesman. He is the favorite to succeed Secretary of State Warren Christopher when the appointed hour arrives. I suggest that we begin repairing this administration's floundering state-craft by ensuring that Mr. Talbott's views do not continue as State Department policy. Mr. Talbott is a man of great intelligence and eloquence--and has wisdom. As a consequence we should not elevate or confirm the exemplar of the words ``the worst sin * * * is a good defense.'' I will vote against Ambassador Talbott's confirmation, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lieberman). Who yields time? Mr. PELL. I yield as much time as he may desire to the Senator from Georgia. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has the floor. Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. I rise to support the nomination of Strobe Talbott to be Deputy Secretary of State. I have known and respected Mr. Talbott for a number of years, and I am particularly pleased that President Clinton appointed him to be the overall coordinator for United States policy toward Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union at a period of time when we really needed coordination and leadership. Of course, that challenge continues. He has done, I think, a fine job in that position. This was the position that Senator Lugar and I, and others in the Senate urged, and Strobe Talbott has brought to this position energy, imagination and extensive backgrounds in foreign policy generally and in Soviet affairs specifically--now Russian affairs--and, of course, now the former Soviet Union. He has performed with distinction, and we have been fortunate to have a person of Strobe's talents and experience in this key position. Among his many accomplishments over the past year, Mr. Talbott has advanced programs to dismantle weapons of mass destruction in Russia, Byelarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine pursuant to legislation originating in this body in 1991. In particular, the trilateral agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States signed during President Clinton's recent visit to Moscow has the potential to resolve a very serious and potentially very dangerous dispute between Russia and Ukraine over strategic nuclear weapons and, correspondingly, to advance the national security interests of the United States. The removal of strategic nuclear weapons from Byelarus is proceeding smoothly and a comparable program is about to be instituted with Kazakhstan. Strobe Talbott and his staff can take pride in these accomplishments, and we all share that pride in what has been done so far, realizing that a great deal more needs to be done. I believe that Mr. Talbott's talents and experience will enable him to serve with distinction as Deputy Secretary of State. Strobe has followed foreign policy matters and national security matters, and particularly arms control matters, very carefully and very closely. For years he has written extensively on arms control and on international relations. And so he certainly has the background required for this foreign policy challenge. He has developed an excellent productive working relationship with Secretary of State Christopher. He enjoys the personal friendship and full confidence of President Clinton, which is enormously important in this key position. My only concern that I will share with my colleagues--not about this nomination but the collateral concern I have that would flow from this nomination--is that we would be losing an ideal, full-time coordinator of our policy toward the former Soviet Union at a time of complex historic transition in that critical part of the world. Mr. President, we saw during the last administration that an effective Deputy Secretary of State, no matter how able and accomplished and experienced, simply does not have time to also be an effective coordinator of policy toward the former Soviet Union. In my view, that is a full-time job. I hope the administration will come to this realization because I believe we need to preserve the coordinator position as Mr. Talbott has developed it. We need to fill that position with a person who, like Strobe, has considerable stature and standing and also has a close relationship with the Secretary of State and the President of the United States. Mr. President, the Strobe Talbott nomination fully merits the Senate's confirmation as Deputy Secretary of State. I urge my colleagues to support this nomination. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for yielding me the time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in the order of appearance, as I understand it, we are going from Democrat to Republican. That is the way it should be. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] be recognized for 10 minutes; the distinguished Republican leader, Mr. Dole, for 12 minutes; Mr. McConnell for 10 minutes; and Mr. Murkowski for 10 minutes in the order of their being recognized. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. PELL. One question. I think if we go back and forth, if a Democrat comes in, he or she will---- Mr. HELMS. Absolutely. That was understood. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understood that to be the intention of the Senator from North Carolina. Mr. PELL. If, for example, there is a Republican, Democrat, and you stop, then a Democrat should be recognized. Mr. HELMS. Certainly. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HELMS. I hope that unanimous consent did not include any of my time because we are running short. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair suggests to the Senator that it did not. Under the previous order, the Chair now recognizes the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown]. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise out of concern for the nomination of Mr. Talbott to be Deputy Secretary of State. This body has previously voted on Mr. Talbott when he was appointed as special Ambassador at Large to the New Independent States. I voted for Mr. Talbott for that nomination. I find myself often voting not necessarily for people I would appoint myself or whom I would normally endorse, but I believe great deference is given to the President, as is appropriate, whether that President is Democrat or Republican. However, it seems to me that this nomination for Deputy Secretary of State is a different matter than the ambassadorial post that Mr. Talbott now holds. It is different in that the primary focus is managerial. It is different in that the scope of responsibilities is much broader and the areas affected are much broader. This job involves the entire world and not simply an area where Mr. Talbott had, I thought, significant experience and expertise, in the area of the former Soviet Union or the Newly Independent States. I am concerned about Mr. Talbott's nomination, and I want to be specific. It is not that I do not believe he is intelligent. I think he is quite intelligent. It is not that I do not believe he has some fine attributes. I do indeed recognize him as not only a scholar but a very effective journalist who has a distinguished career. But I do have specific concerns and I want to go through them individually. No. 1: I am concerned about Mr. Talbott's view of the Soviet threat throughout much of our recent history. In 1990, Mr. Talbott wrote: A new consensus is emerging that the Soviet threat is not what it used to be. The real point, however, is that it never was. The doves in the great debate of the past 40 years were right all along. Mr. President, I respectfully disagree with Mr. Talbott on that observation. I believe if one thing is apparent, it is that far from the doves being correct, those who wanted a firm hand against the former Soviet Union were correct. There is no more specific or clear differentiation than the policies of President Reagan and President Jimmy Carter. President Carter sincerely and honestly believed the way to deal with the Soviet Union was to unilaterally disarm, make unilateral concessions on nuclear items and engender in the Soviet Union a response that would lead to peace, harmony and a reduction of tensions. Thus, Jimmy Carter unilaterally reduced military expenditures. The Soviet response was to increase their military. President Carter unilaterally declared, even after the countries of Western Europe had called for intermediate range missiles to be deployed, that he would not deploy those missiles. The Soviet response was to increase deployment of their intermediate range ballistic missiles. In response to our dovish approach to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. To say that the doves in the great debate of the last 40 years were right all along is simply not correct. At least in that perception of the Soviet Union, I fundamentally disagree with Mr. Talbott. I do not question the sincerity of his comments. I simply disagree fundamentally with his conclusions. On June 11, 1990, referring to Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Talbott said: He is a lightweight demagog, a buffoon, a windbag, at best naive, at worst dangerous. Mr. President, I fundamentally disagree on that analysis of Mr. Yeltsin. It seems to me that in that process--and I would believe Strobe Talbott at this point would describe his reactions to the new President differently--he has failed to properly assess the qualities and commitment that President Yeltsin brought to his job. Third, with regard to Israel, on September 4, 1981, he was quoted as saying: Israel sometimes seems to have taken a visage and a tone of a rather nasty, bitter nation, even a violent one. Israel, in the past, has managed to convey more sorrow than anger when it wielded its terrible swift sword. Now there seems to be only one anger and it is too often shrill and self-righteous and even a bit frightening. I fundamentally disagree with Mr. Talbott's assessment of Israel. It seems to me Israel has a right to exist and to defend itself. On October 29, 1990, speaking on how Israel is like Iraq, he said: Ariel Sharon has an apparent mandate to treat zoning as the conduct of war by other means. Mr. President, I fundamentally disagree with Mr. Talbott on his assessment. Fourth, Mr. President, in developing a policy of partnership for peace in Eastern Europe, Mr. Talbott's position has been to oppose immediate membership in NATO for the nations of Eastern Europe. This body has gone on record, as I have, in favor of NATO membership for these countries. Mr. Talbott even disagrees with setting a time line for that membership. I find myself in fundamental disagreement on this important aspect of policy. No. 5. Mr. President, it is clear that Mr. Talbott opposed the deployment of Pershing missiles in Europe in 1982. I simply disagree, and I think the proof is in the pudding. The fact is the Soviets had deployed intermediate range ballistic missiles prior to that. The U.S. failure to deploy intermediate range ballistic missiles in the Carter administration had led to further deployments, and the reality is our willingness to deploy intermediate range ballistic missiles in 1982, contrary to Mr. Talbott's viewpoint and advice, ended up helping bring about a reconciliation, bringing about a reduction of arms rather than the opposite. Sixth, Mr. President, in U.S. News & World Report, Mr. Talbott is quoted with regard to star wars as saying: If Reagan holds firm, he might as well abandon the pursuit of drastic ``Soviet arms'' reductions. Mr. President, Mr. Talbott was fundamentally wrong on that observation. The reality is that President Reagan's holding firm was the key that brought about fundamental reductions in arms. Once again, I find myself in strong disagreement. Mr. President, recently, July 20, 1992, in Time, an article entitled ``The Birth of the Global Nation,'' Mr. Talbott is quoted as follows: I'll bet that within the next hundred years nationhood as we know it will be obsolete. All States will recognize a single global authority. He is further quoted as saying: All countries are basically social arrangements, accommodations to changing circumstances. No matter how permanent and even sacred they may seem at one time, in fact, they are all artificial and temporary. Mr. President, I fundamentally disagree not just with the forecast but with the view of our Nation. It is far more than simply a social arrangement. It is a commitment to an ideal, something far more fundamental than a social arrangement that could be a passing fancy. The commitment to human rights and individual rights is so fundamental to pass it off as a social arrangement ignores or overlooks the fundamental focus of the American dream and the American experience as well as its influence on the world. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial from the Rocky Mountain News of February 11, and a copy of an article from the New Republic that was recently published concerning Mr. Talbott. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Rocky Mountain News, Feb. 11, 1994] A Dismal Record of Opinion The Senate confirmation hearings for Strobe Talbott, who will be the next deputy secretary of state, were strangely lopsided. They aired at length the nominee's controversial writings on Israel but scarcely noted his slant on a more far-reaching issue, the Soviet Union. As a longtime diplomatic correspondent and editor-at-large for Time magazine, Talbott commented regularly on international affairs throughout the 1980s. He also translated Nikita Khrushchev's memoirs and wrote scholarly works on arms control. He argued that U.S. policy for four decades was based on a ``grotesque exaggeration'' of the Soviet threat. Consistent with this assessment, Talbott opposed NATO's deployment of Pershing missiles in Europe in 1982, considered the Star Wars defense system a dangerous provocation, scolded President Ronald Reagan for ``challenging the legitimacy of the Soviet regime'' (something the captive peoples of the Soviet empire would soon risk their lives to do en masse) and chalked up to ``extraordinary luck'' Reagan's part in the unravelling of Soviet communism. These beliefs are serious misjudgments. Soviet expansionism was no delusion. As late as the second half of the 1970s, former arms control chief Ken Adelman reminds us, the Soviets planned or assisted a communist takeover of a pro-Western country each year: ``in 1975, South Vietnam; in 1976, Angola; 1977, Ethiopia; 1978, Cambodia; and in 1979, Afghanistan and Nicaragua.'' Numerous former Soviet officials have confirmed Reagan's significant role in spurring change in Moscow. The senators might have asked Talbott whether the fall of communism has changed his thinking. They were too busy grilling him on a 1981 statement that Israel was becoming ``a liability to U.S. interests,'' which he said he no longer believes. No one is right all of the time, but Talbott's record in his field of expertise inspires little confidence. We still hope that he at least will do some good in combatting this president's inclination to ignore foreign affairs altogether. ____ [From the New Republic, Mar. 7, 1994] The Master of the Game (By Charles Lane) On an April day in 1967 columnist James Reston of The New York Times visited the campus of Yale College. The protests at Yale had been quieter than at most places, so Reston came to prove that the anti-Vietnam war movement was not just ``weirdies and beardies.'' Respectable students were involved, too. Exhibit A was Nelson Strobridge Talbott III, ``a clean-cut, solemn, serious, patriotic, progressive Republican type.'' His opposition to the war seemed a matter of mature concern for the national interest, and the tone of the national debate, not mere adolescent moralism. As Talbott told Reston, ``I do not want to help pillory the present administration. I am interested to see if there are new means and attitudes by which this university--and hence the university community in general--can make discussion less polemical and more meaningful, and at the same time help the search for peace.'' Talbott has written since of the nation's ``traumatic memory'' of Vietnam, but for him those years were free of trauma. It was a time in which he assumed the identity expected of him as son and namesake of Nelson Strobridge Talbott Jr., Cleveland investment banker and chum of the Republican Tafts. Strobe Talbott wasted no time on failure, introspection or rebellion. ``Though he was our age, he always seemed much, much older,'' says Hannah Achtenberg, a fellow student in those years. From Hotchkiss and Yale, where his father and grandfather had also studied, Talbott went on to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, then to a job in Eastern Europe for Time magazine, where he worked for the next twenty-two years as White House correspondent, diplomatic correspondent, Washington bureau chief and editor-at-large. His memories of being shaped by the turbulent '60s seem only to underscore his actual insulation. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, he and the rest of the Hotchkiss boys were summoned to the chapel to pray for peace. ``A vivid memory of our sixteenth year--along with proms, high school sports and our first driver's license--was the prospect of instant obliteration,'' Talbott and his friend, political scientist Michael Mandelbaum, wrote in an essay for their Yale twenty- fifth class reunion. In a Time essay he wrote in 1992 to defend his friend and fellow Rhodes Scholar Bill Clinton from charges of draft-dodging, Talbott recalled another epiphany: Clinton and housemate Frank Aller, a draft resister, arguing the issue so heatedly they lost track of time while basting a Thanksgiving turkey. Talbott himself secured a medical deferment thanks to a letter to his draft board from a friendly orthopedist in Cleveland. He later confessed to ``a moral discomfort bordering on guilt'' about the trick knee that kept him ``out of the Mekong Delta, but not the squash courts and playing fields of Oxford.'' He and Mandelbaum conceded that ``it took more intellectual and political courage to support [the war] than to oppose it,'' given the campus mood of the times. But Talbott had opted for a Clintonian gambit: he kept his ties to his establishment elders, without alienating his friends or breaking ranks with his generation. He protested the war, but in a calibrated way. ``At Yale, he was not an organizer of events, not even teach-ins,'' recalls classmate and brother-in-law Derek Shearer. ``He did not participate in marches.'' In the essay with Mandelbaum, Talbott claimed to have written a Yale Daily News editorial endorsing Eugene McCarthy for president. Talbott is writing a larger role for himself in the rebellious history of his generation than he actually played: in fact, the paper's endorsement editorial was written by Alan Boles, a junior. Today, Nelson Strobridge Talbott III is poised to assume the stewardship of American foreign policy. During a jog on the beach during the Renaissance Weekend in Hilton Head, South Carolina, in 1992, President-elect Clinton invited Talbott to be his special envoy to the former Soviet Union. After a year in that post, Talbott has been nominated to be deputy secretary of state. Traditionally the number two at State has either focused on department management or on issues the secretary himself doesn't want to deal with. But in the Clinton administration, Friends of Bill are usually more important than their bosses. Talbott's assignment is to give the administration's floundering statecraft a new direction and a more polished spokesman. He is the favorite to succeed Secretary of State Warren Christopher when the appointed hour arrives. The intellect and probity of this product of elite institutions are not, and should not be, in doubt. His competence, his geniality and his remarkable discipline have won him the power and admiration for which he always seemed destined. ``Strobe believes that by doing right in the world, America enhances its own strength,'' says author Walter Isaacson, a former colleague at Time. Such a view is not incorrect, but what exactly does it mean? For all his glittering credentials, even Talbott's friends fall back on platitudes to describe what he stands for. At 47, Talbott has perfected the Clintonian art of squaring circles. His thinking is analytic rather than empirical, pragmatic rather than idealistic, though it pretends to idealism. While he takes moral positions, he prefers to defend them in the language of national self-interest. His characteristic prescription is one that lets the country keep its options open, while meritocratic elites, at ``the highest levels,'' keep the state afloat. Thus, in 1986, during the ferocious Nicaragua debate--a time, like Vietnam, when friendships were ending over the issue--Talbott urged Congress to grant military aid to the contras, but if and only if it were used as a form of pressure to win diplomatic concessions from the Sandinistas. Partnership for Peace, the Clinton administration's security framework for the new Europe, ``can go either way,'' in Talbott's recent phrase. If Russia turns aggressive, we can let the Eastern European countries into nato; if not, we might let the Russians in, too. But Talbott's worldview is not all compromise. Two lodestars have remained fixed throughout his carefully measured career. The first is the mystique of Russia. Talbott is a passionate student of Russian language and poetry. He translated Nikita Khrushchev's two-volume memoirs for Time while still at Oxford, and has written or co-written six books on U.S.-Soviet relations. Yet for all the depth of Talbott's Russophilia, its origins seem puzzlingly serendipitous. Though Talbott has visited the country often, he never lived there for more than a few months at a time--in part due to a kgb ban imposed because he worked on the smuggled Khrushchev papers. Rather, he has lived for years in the Russia of his imagination. The origins of this enthusiasm lie in an experience that seems to have been a cross between youthful indulgence and the flowering of a mature, but not exactly flamboyant, aesthetic sensibility. As a tenth-grader at Hotchkiss, Talbott was assigned to an English class taught by an inspiring young man named Clinton Ely. Ely also happened to teach Russian and Russian literature to eleventh-graders, and he recruited Talbott to join his class the next year. Young Strobe became ``enraptured and fascinated,'' recalls Ely, with whom Talbott has remained friends ever since. ``We both felt there was just something magical about Russia.'' The fascination deepened at Yale. As his mother wished, Talbott started out pre-med, but turned to journalism and Russian studies after he did poorly in chemistry. As a Yale senior he wrote a 256-page thesis, ``Fyodor Tyutchev: Poet of Privacy,'' about an ardent pan-Slavist who once wrote: ``Russia cannot be known with the mind, cannot be gauged with some general measure. . . . In Russia, it is only possible to believe.'' In Tyutchev, Talbott found a character whose career had a particular resonance for the romantic but career-minded Yalie. Tyutchev was a minor aristocrat and diplomat who, after losing a package of secret codes in Switzerland, was fired from the foreign service and wound up later as a toady in the imperial court. As a reward for an essay in which he had called on the West to join with reactionary Russia against the forces of reform in Europe, Tyutchev was appointed by Czar Nicholas I to a commission in charge of censoring foreign publications. ``Neither before or since has the Russian autocracy had a more loyal bard,'' writes Joseph Brodsky. Tyutchev is said to have been one of Lenin's favorite poets as well. Tyutchev's contempt for the masses would find a faint, but unmistakable, echo in Talbott's own career. The second concept around which Talbott's intellectual system revolves is the special, anointed role of elites. At the Highest Levels, the title of his recent study (with Michael Beschloss) of George Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev and the end of the cold war, could be Talbott's credo. The participation in the affairs of foreign policymakers by lobbies, Congress or an unruly public has long annoyed Talbott. In an August 1992 Time column, for instance, he took China's and Bush's side in the debate over Most Favored Nation status for Beijing--even as Clinton campaigned against Bush's coddling of the butchers of Tiananmen Square: ``Once again those would-be statesmen on Capitol Hill are trying to micromanage American foreign policy and legislate morality in another country--something Congress does often and badly. . . . The whole episode is a vivid reminder of the uneasy, often unhelpful interaction between U.S. politics and foreign policy, especially in an election year. Politicians are quick to embrace simple positions on complex issues that make them feel good and look good--but in fact make a bad situation worse.'' His admirers construe his elitism as virtue, calling him the lineal descendant of the ``Wise Men''--the centrist, internationalist mandarins who shaped postwar American foreign policy. ``Strobe is part of the honest foreign policy tradition that began with Elihu Root and Henry Stimson, and runs through Paul Nitze and Cyrus Vance,'' says Isaacson, himself an admiring chronicler of the ``Wise Men.'' It's a peculiar encomium for a journalist. At Time, Taibott's stories were almost entirely free of any insurgent spirit. His writing about George Kennan, Cyrus Vance, et al., was always reverent. Sometimes it was worshipful. In the preface to The Master of the Game, his critical but admiring biography of Paul Nitze (Hotchkiss `24), Talbott's salute to the liberal meritocrats of the establishment was downright unctuous: ``Harold Brown, who has been such an important theoretician and practitioner of national security policy . . . McGeorge Bundy . . . soon to publish a landmark book on the role of nuclear weapons . . . Robert McNamara, himself a key figure in the history of the nuclear age. . . .'' Talbott's books and articles were billed as top-secret inside looks at the movers and shakers, but their real purpose was more to explain than to expose. His three major books on arms control and the cold war, Endgame, Deadly Gambits and At the Highest Levels, were all done with the cooperation of senior officials who agreed to confide in Talbott as long as he agreed not to write anything contemporaneously for Time, or to reveal their identities. Talbott's access lent his otherwise anodyne writing a ``you are there'' feel. To some, it also lent it an air of professional compromise. In the New York Times Book Review in 1984, Theodore Draper took on the ``novelized history'' of Deadly Gambits. Talbott had provided word-for-word quotations, attributed to no source, for the famous 1983 ``Walk in the Woods'' arms negotiations between Nitze and his Soviet counterpart, Yuli Kvitsinsky. First, Draper pointed out, there were only two men present at the Walks in the Woods, so hiding the source of the words was a charade. Obviously it was Nitze, as Nitze himself later admitted. Second, how could other researchers check Talbott's accuracy if no source was cited? Draper's polemic was a bit overwrought, and Talbott was right to respond that sometimes reporters have no choice but to protect their sources. (This article is no exception.) Still, Draper raised a legitimate issue. Talbott's coziness with his sources was troubling not because there was a conflict of interest, but because there was an identity of interest. Most of the people Talbott was writing about, or using as sources, were his colleagues in the study groups and panel discussions of such bodies as the Aspen Strategy Group and the Council on Foreign Relations. No fewer than seventeen people mentioned in his books are now fellow senior officials of the Clinton administration. (It was almost eighteen. But Talbott's source and Aspen colleague, Bobby Ray Inman, whom he enthusiastically recommended to Clinton for secretary of defense, confounded Talbott's confidence by staging a public psychological meltdown.-- The cold war. Talbott's intellectual obsession from adolescence to adulthood, posed a series of contradictions for him: between the inner grandeur of the Russian people and the manifest barbarity of Soviet communism (he never denied this); between the danger of nuclear war and the promise of superpower cooperation; between the demands of democracy and the demands of diplomacy. Talbott's romantic view of Russia and elite view of politics shaped the template he developed for sorting out these tensions. His was a careful balancing act, derived largely from Kennan's work. The Soviets were dangerous. But they were dangerous mostly because Russians feel threatened by, and inferior to the West. That insecurity might press less urgently upon them if they were shown respect and reassured about the West's intentions. This could be achieved through contact--at the highest levels--between statesmen on both sides. Engagement was valuable for its own sake. In this policy prescription, detente provided mutual reassurance and arms control provided stability. ``He was a `two apes on a treadmill' kind of guy,'' says one specialist in Russian affairs, ```If we could only have smart people from the Aspen Institute in charge this would all be over.''' These views once again placed Talbott in the position he found most comfortable; that of treating complicated moral and historical matters in the technocratic language of national interest. Talbott argued that the balance of terror paradoxically was the most realistic, and therefore best, hope of preventing nuclear war. This was a perfectly defensible position, and in the days of the peace movement of the early '80s, a courageous one, because deterrence was under moral attack both from advocates of a nuclear freeze on the left, and from advocates of Star Wars on the right. The purpose of arms control was to refine deterrence. Thus Talbott hailed the Carter administration for its 1979 SALT II agreement with the Soviets, and urged the Reagan administration to swap Star Wars for Soviet reductions in heavy missiles. The end of the cold war wrecked Talbott's worldview, as it did everyone else's. His first reaction was to declare vindication. In 1990, in a paean to Mikhail Gor"
