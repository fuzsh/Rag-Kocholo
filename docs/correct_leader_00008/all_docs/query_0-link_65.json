All unauthorized edits may be reverted on the admin's discretion. Propose any changes to the talk page.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and U.S. President George H. W. Bush visited Pyongyang, Korea from 12 to 16 May 1991. The visit was the first two of any world leaders to the former-North Korean areas of the newly reunified Korea. During the visit, the Pyongyang Agreement was signed establishing defence and a collective security principle between Japan, Korea and the United States.\n\nBackground[]\n\nKorea had reunified on 19 October 1990. This followed the North Korean revolution in 1989, which resulted in negotiations leading to the reunification. The reunification faced difficulties gaining recognition on the international stage, with some countries reluctant to recognise the unified Korea over concerns of instability and concerns around the survival of the state.\n\nOne of the nations especially reluctant to recognise Korean sovereignty over all of the peninsula was the People's Republic of China led by Zhao Ziyang. Despite recent democratic reforms, the Chinese leadership saw the country as a potential threat. The Chinese-Korean border had faced difficulties adapting to the new political situation, and the Chinese leadership followed a refusal of recognising Korean reunification. This led to concerns of a potential military or security threat, with Korean president Kang Young-hoon looking for further assistance in the case of a potential military or security threat.\n\nItinerary[]\n\n12 May: Arrival and official welcome[]\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu arrived via airplane to an airfield outside Pyongyang at 10am local time on 12 May 1991, to a large security brigade. Toshiki Kaifu carried out talks with Young-hoon regarding the Korean-Japanese relations. Trade between the two nations were also discussed, as well as Japanese assistance with Korean reintegration.\n\nU.S. President George H. W. Bush arrived to Camp Humphreys in the South Korean areas of Korea. He greeted American troops, and gave a speech congratulating them on their work \"which was and will continue be vital to the growth of a united Korea\". The U.S. military there also co-ordinated security, including the provision of certain vehicles and planes to guide Air Force One to Pyongyang. Bush left Camp Humphreys at 4pm local time, arriving at Pyongyang at 7pm local time - he would spend from one to two hours discussing issues with Kaifu and Young-hoon, before being escorted via car to the hotel he was staying at in Pyongyang. Similarly, Kaifu was escorted to a different hotel.\n\n13 May: Consulate-general openings and visits to official facilities[]\n\nBush travelled to the opening of the American consulate-general in Pyongyang. He delivered a speech commemorating \"this new chapter for east Asia, and a new era of relationships between all of Korea and America.\" Similarly, Kaifu opened the new Japanese consulate-general in Pyongyang.\n\nIn the afternoon, both Kaifu and Bush visited the Ryongsong Residence and other government facilities, alongside Young-hoon. This included to the government-owned Revolution Museum, which was converted from the former Party Founding Museum, which they toured with Young-hoon acting as their guide to the museum's objects. They would also visit the nearby gardens, and visit the location of a nearby memorial to those killed during the North Korean Revolution. In the afternoon, Bush met with families of those killed during the North Korean Revolution; two families invited to the event would not be allowed access due to \"security concerns\", attracting controversy in Korea.\n\n14 May: Tour of Pyongyang[]\n\nOn 14 May, Bush and Kaifu both toured Pyongyang, to various civilian facilities and landmarks. This included visits to various memorials and museums, with Bush opening a new park which had opened as part of Young-hoon's reintegration processes. The tour attracted attention for the security measures in place, with concerns over a potential threat from supporters of the former North Korean dictatorship model of government.\n\n15 May: Pyongyang Agreement[]\n\nMain article: Pyongyang Agreement\n\nOn 15 May, negotiations would take place surrounding various topics, mostly on the theme of the future of Korea. Discussions around reintegration, international support and defence were held; this led to the Pyongyang Agreement. Young-hoon had pushed for a formal agreement between Korea, Japan and the United States that could deter China from taking action against the newly-unified Korea. The Pyongyang Agreement established a collective security principle between the three nations, as well as the establishment of two joint American-Japanese bases on the Korean peninsula. The agreement also announced further support for efforts towards reintegration and defence of the reunified Korea.\n\n16 May: Return flights to Japan and the United States[]\n\nAfter the Pyongyang Agreement, Young-hoon's goals had been mostly fulfilled. Bush and Kaifu would remain until midday on 16 May, for a ceremony celebrating the relationships between Korea, Japan and the United States. American-Japanese security co-ordination led to the sharing of the presidential aircraft, Air Force One; this followed security concerns regarding the capabilities of the Japanese agencies.\n\nAftermath[]\n\nTensions between China and Korea continued, however the visit and Pyongyang Agreement contributed to de-escalation; the People's Republic of China later dissolved on 19 December 1991. The visit also lead to closer relations between the United States and Japan, with both nations having much influence in Korea. The collective security principle remains active, as of 2022.\n\nKorean President Kang Young-hoon left office on 1 December 1991, following the 1991 Korea presidential election in which he did not contest. Kim Dae-jung replaced Young-hoon, becoming the first elected Korean president. Dae-jung continued close relations and defence co-operation with the United States and Japan, however such security was of less priority with a weaker China."
