        "text": "Mike Martin '04 is in his 12th season as the Men's Basketball Head Coaching Chair in 2023-24. He is the 31st head men’s basketball coach in the program’s 117-year history. Martin launched his Brown career in 2012-2013 as the fourth youngest head men’s basketball coach in Division I.\n\nWith an 80-66 home victory over Cornell on Feb. 11, 2023, Martin became the winningest head coach in Brown men's basketball history with his 134th career win, breaking the 54-year-old record previously held by Stanley Ward. Following the completion of the 2022-23 season, Martin's record stood at 135 victories.\n\nIn 12 years at the helm of the Brown Basketball team, Martin has changed the direction and culture of the program, with the building blocks in place to develop an Ivy Championship team.\n\nThe 2022-23 season not only saw Martin set the program's all-time wins record, but it was also the team's fourth straight season of at least 13 victories, just the second time in program history that the Bears have compiled at least that many wins in four straight seasons. Sophomore Kino Lilly Jr. was named to the All-Ivy First Team and senior Paxson Wojcik to the Second Team.\n\nIn 2021-22, Martin led the program to 13 victories. Jaylan Gainey '22 was named Ivy Defensive Player of the Year for the second straight season and Kino Lilly Jr. '25 was honored as Ivy League Rookie of the Year.\n\nMartin's 2019-20 team posted 15 wins, compiling the most wins (35) over two years in Brown basketball history. The Bears' eight Ivy League wins (8-6, 4th place) mark the 14th time in Brown history that a Brown team has won eight or more conference games. Jaylan Gainey '22 was named the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, the second consecutive Brown player to earn the honor.\n\nIn 2018-19, Martin was named the Ivy League Coach of the Year after guiding Brown to its first 20-win season ever (20-12) and a postseason berth in the College Basketball Invitational. The catalyst to the teams' success was defense with the Bears' defense being ranked 22nd out of 353 Division I teams behind the play of Obi Okolie '19, who was named the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year. His squad also posted its first-ever postseason win, beating Alabama Birmingham in the first round of the College Basketball Invitational.\n\nIn his first year as head coach of the Bears, Martin was named a finalist for the Joe B. Hall Award as the nation's outstanding first-year head coach after leading the Bears to a turnaround season with a 13-15 overall record, including a fourth-place finish in the Ivy standings with a 7-7 mark after winning four of its last five games.\n\nMartin instilled a defensive work effort on the court that translated into an improvement in team defense of five points per game from the previous season. He also coached Brown's first-ever Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, Cedric Kuakumensah '16.\n\nMartin's 2013-2014 team posted a 15-14 overall record and hosted Brown's first ever postseason game, playing Holy Cross in the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament at the Pizzitola Sports Center. In addition, Kuakumensah was named the Ivy League's Defensive Player of the Year for the second straight season.\n\nMartin's first recruiting class proved to be one of the most honored in Brown basketball history, with three different freshmen being named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week a school record 10 times - forward Leland King '17 (four times), forward Steven Spieth '17 (three times) and guard Norman Hobbie '17 (three times).\n\nA member of the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Regional Advisory Committee, Mike was inducted into the New England Basketball Hall of Fame in the Perry Category for distinguished achievement in two categories (player and coach), and was inducted along with his dad, Mike, who was inducted into the Icon category, his uncle, Buddy, who played at Dartmouth and was inducted in the Prep School Category, cousins Colin and Sean Tabb, representing their high schools, and his late grandfather, William, who played at Providence College and was inducted in the high school category.\n\nA four-year starter at Brown, Martin was part of the winningest class in the Bears' basketball history, posting a 63-45 four-year record from 2000-2004. He also helped the Class of 2004 to a school-record 39-17 Ivy League mark during that period -- the best by an Ivy League team other than Penn and Princeton since 1970.\n\n\"I'm honored and thrilled to be the head coach at Brown, a school at which I have so many fond memories,” said Martin. “I believe strongly in all we have to offer at Brown and am eager to connect with all the current players, Brown alumni, fans, and supporters.\"\n\nAn economics concentrator as an undergraduate, Martin was co-captain of Brown's 2003-2004 team that finished second in the Ivy League standings for the third time in his four years and defeated Princeton for the first time ever in Princeton, New Jersey. He also helped the Bears to a school-record four straight winning seasons.\n\nA native of Agawam, Mass., where he starred at Cathedral High School, Martin averaged 11 points per game for Brown as a senior. He also played a major role on the Bears' 2003 team that posted a 12-2 Ivy League mark and earned a berth in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). When he graduated, Martin ranked third all-time at Brown in career treys (143), ninth in career steals (113), and tenth in career assists (232).\n\nAfter graduating from Brown, Martin spent the 2004-05 season playing professionally for Dart Killester in Ireland's top division of professional basketball.\n\nMartin launched his coaching career at Brown on head coach Glen Miller’s staff as an assistant coach in 2005-2006. He joined Miller at Penn in 2006-2007 as an assistant coach and enjoyed a memorable season, with the Quakers posting a 22-9 record, winning the Ivy League Championship with a 13-1 League mark, and advancing to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nAt Penn, he helped head coach Jerome Allen and the Quakers post 20 wins overall in 2011-2012 for the first time since 2006-07, finishing second in the Ivy League at 11-3, one game behind Harvard in the standings. Penn then played in the postseason College Basketball Invitational, defeating Quinnipiac in the opening round before falling to Butler in the quarterfinal round.\n\nMartin has helped recruit and mentor some of the Ivy League's top players during his time at Brown and Penn, including Sean McGonagill '14, Brown's third all-time leading scorer and a two-time first-team All-Ivy selection under Martin; Matt Mullery ’10, Brown’s all-time leader in blocked shots; and Penn’s Zack Rosen, the Ivy League Player of the Year in 2011-12 and the program's all-time assist leader. He also developed Kuakumensah ’16 into the greatest shot blocker in Ivy League history and the only player in Ivy annals to score 1,000 points, grab 800 rebounds and block 300 shots.\n\nMartin's wife, the former Kristin Ferrell '04, was a member of the women's soccer team while at Brown.\n\nHEAD COACHING RECORD\n\nSeason School/Team Overall Percentage Ivy League Conference Percentage Conference Finish Postseason 2012-13 Brown 13-15 .464 7-7 .500 fourth 2013-14 Brown 15-14 .517 7-7 .500 fourth CollegeInsider.com Tournament (CIT) 2014-15 Brown 13-18 .419 4-10 .286 seventh 2015-16 Brown 8-20 .286 3-11 .214 seventh 2016-17 Brown 13-17 .433 4-10 .286 sixth 2017-18 Brown 11-16 .407 4-10 .286 seventh 2018-19 Brown 20-12 .625 7-7 .500 fourth College Basketball Invitational (CBI) 2019-20 Brown 15-12 .556 8-6 .571 t-fourth 2020-21* Brown - - - - - - 2021-22 Brown 13-16 .448 5-9 .357 t-sixth 2022-23 Brown 14-13 .519 7-7 .500 t-fourth Career 11 Seasons 135-153 .469 56-84 .400\n\n*Season canceled due to COVID-19"
