        "text": "This week, The Athletic will take a closer look at each of the candidates for the Knicks’ coaching vacancy and how each would fit in the job. We started with Tom Thibodeau. The next installment focused on Kenny Atkinson. This one spotlights Mike Miller.\n\nAge: 55\n\nCurrent job: Knicks interim head coach\n\nResume\n\n17-27 as Knicks interim coach\n\nG League Coach of the Year in 2018\n\n162-209 as Division I head coach\n\nKnicks Ties\n\nMiller was the Knicks’ G League coach for four seasons and then was on their bench this season.\n\nStrengths\n\n• Player development as the Westchester Knicks coach\n\n• Brought stability to the Knicks after taking over in December after David Fizdale was fired\n\n• Was asked to be and proved to be capable spokesperson for the entire organization\n\nQuestions\n\n• What kind of offensive style does Miller prefer if starting a season cleanly?\n\nReferences\n\n“Are you confident, sincere, reliable and trustworthy? And if you are, (players) don’t care if you played or didn’t play in the NBA, are black or white, big or small. That’s what they want. I believe Mike has all four of those completely knocked out of the park. That’s why I think he’ll be successful. He’s not the kind to win the press conference — all he’ll try to do is win the games. He is giving credit to the players. I think because of that it’s bread-and-butter basketball. It’s no thrills. It’s not gimmicky. It’s not something he gamed. It’s just fundamental, bread-and-butter basketball. What is winning in the NBA has always won in the NBA. Get more better shots than your opponent.” — Jeff Van Gundy to The Athletic\n\n“He really loves this game. He has good knowledge of this game. Even if it’s not here, I know he’s going to be successful.” — Elfrid Payton to Newsday\n\n“He’s a really good coach. He knows his stuff. He holds everyone accountable. He’s big on details and wants guys to go out and play hard. He’s the same guy now with the same voice and details like in Westchester.’’ — Damyean Dotson to the New York Post\n\n“From my personal standpoint, dealing with him on a daily basis has been absolutely amazing while he interacts with us, how he coaches the game — everything. We’ve responded really well to him and he’s done a great job … He just made some adjustments, so what he feels is best, as far as playing to guys’ strengths and stuff like that. It’s just the adjustments and all that type of stuff. So, he’s done a great job.” — Julius Randle, via SNY\n\n“He’s dedicated. He’s prepared. He brings maximum energy every day. He doesn’t let the ins and outs and ups and downs determine how he approaches what we’re doing. He’s a good teacher. He’s very detailed. He should be a head coach in this league.” — Allan Houston, Knicks special assistant to the GM, to Knicks Journal in 2017\n\nIn His Own Words\n\n“I spent six years in the D League/G League and it was day to day. How do you make the players better? And I really feel like that experience gave me a different perspective on how to do these jobs and how to do a job that brings value to this organization.” — Miller, via Newsday\n\n“We want movement. Let’s get some force with our entries coming into our offense. Let’s have some attack. Let’s get downhill more, put more pressure on that defense and do that consistently. Because when we’ve done that, we’ve felt like we’ve had good possessions.” — Miller on his offensive philosophy\n\n(Miller is not a big talker or a self-promoter)\n\nThe Big Takeaway\n\nA Miller hire would be a vote for the status quo. Not the status quo of the James Dolan regime, but of the work that Miller has done since taking over the team on Dec. 6. Miller’s .386 winning percentage in that time is actually the highest by a Knicks coach since Mike Woodson. It would also be an investment in testing out what stability could do for a franchise. The Knicks, if they name a different coach, would be on their sixth since the start of the 2014-15 season. That kind of carousel undoubtedly leaves heads spinning. The Knicks were inarguably better once he was named coach, and bringing Miller back full-time would be a clear sign that team president Leon Rose liked where things were going. It would also, likely, be an opportunity to see what Miller could do with a roster better suited for how he wants to play (once he makes that clear) and without the restraints of an interim title. It would also be a validation for Miller, who has worked his way up from unknown college grinder to G League coach to the sidelines at MSG.\n\nHow He’d Fit In New York\n\nMiller has already shown that he’s a fit with the Knicks in a number of ways. There is a clear case for Miller to return as coach. The on-court product improved, and he stabilized a team in tumult. As soon as Miller took over, the Knicks played better defense and were more spaced on offense, and the results were an improvement on what they had been doing under Fizdale. He also proved a calm, if laconic, force as the Knicks’ de facto team spokesman — a perfect mix for a franchise that prefers as little said publicly as possible. His low-key approach allowed the Knicks to have a relatively smooth final three-plus months of the season on the team/coach level (not even Red Holzman could prevent the churn and controversy at the executive level). It would be interesting to see how the Knicks would play if Miller worked in tandem with the front office through the offseason with a clear philosophy in mind, rather than trying to make the best of the ill-fitting roster he took over. Miller has been a pragmatist throughout his career as an offensive coach, so it’s not clear where that would lead now. It would also give Miller clout with the team if he is empowered from the start of a season rather than thrown in as the one asked to correct things midseason in the middle of a crisis. Rose did not get a chance to develop a rapport with Miller under normal terms after he took over as team president, although indications are that Rose was impressed by Miller. To become the Knicks coach he’ll have to beat out candidates who have glossier resumes or bigger names within the sport. But in some ways, an unassuming basketball lifer — “The People’s Coach” — might make the easiest fit in the maelstrom in New York.\n\n(Photo: Jim McIsaac / Getty Images)"
