        "text": "Mike Miller spent three seasons with the Miami Heat during the Big Three era, but now the retired forward is an agent and podcaster.\n\nMiller, along with longtime Heat forward Udonis Haslem, launched their debut episode of \"The OGs\" podcast earlier this week. Miller's top client is former No. 1 pick Paolo Banchero, whom Miller holds tremendous expectations for.\n\n\"Obviously, I talk to him all the time through the process and through everything, and the reason he's going to be an All-Star this year and going to be a Hall of Famer is the way he answers, and when I say old soul, I mean this,\" Miller said. \"He can go out and get 35 every night; he can attack; he can get to the foul line; he can shoot 12 free throws a game; he's actually got his three-point up to about 40 percent this year, maybe above 40 percent.\"\n\nBanchero is a key factor in the Orlando Magic's early-season success. They currently hold the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\n\"He continues to evolve his game, but his whole thing is, I just want to win, and he told me he goes, \"Coach, I told you this when I got here were going to make the playoffs the second year' so to see this and to do this without Wendell Carter too cause their core is elite.\"\n\nBanchero and the Magic are taking on the Heat on Wednesday.\n\nAnthony Pasciolla works as a contributing writer to Inside the Heat.\n\nHe can be reached at ampasciolla@gmail.com or follow him on Instagram @anthonypasci\n\nYou can also check out his personal blog HERE\n\nFollow all of our Miami Heat coverage on Facebook here"
