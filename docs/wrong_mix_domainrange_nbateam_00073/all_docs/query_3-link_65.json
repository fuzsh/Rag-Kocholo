        "text": "Special Teams Coordinator\n\nMike Miller was named the Blue Bombers special teams coordinator on January 8, 2024, moving directly from the playing ranks to a position on the coaching staff.\n\nMiller spent the 2023 season working with the specialists in a non-playing role after being injured in training camp.\n\nMiller began his outstanding playing career in Edmonton in 2011 as undrafted prospect out of Acadia University.\n\nDuring his days in Edmonton, he established himself as a superb contributor on special teams, further building on that reputation after joining the Blue Bombers in 2017. Miller retired as the CFL’s all-time leader in special teams tackles with 226, a record first held by Blue Bombers President and CEO Wade Miller (185) before he was passed by Jason Arakgi (190) in 2016. Miller became the all-time leader in 2021.\n\nMiller was twice named the Blue Bombers Most Outstanding Special Teams Player (2019, 2021), was the team’s Most Outstanding Canadian in 2019 and was selected as the West Division’s Most Outstanding Special Teams Player in 2019 and 2021. He is a three-time Grey Cup champion, having won with Edmonton in 2015 and with the Blue Bombers in 2019 and 2021."
