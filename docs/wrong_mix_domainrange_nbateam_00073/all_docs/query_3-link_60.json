They have 0 good assets and no free agent wants to go to Detroit. They have their own 1st round draft picks at least. It’s not a good situation.\n\nPost: #89\n\nRE: Mike Miller\n\n(04-17-2020 03:48 PM)maximus Wrote:\n\n(04-17-2020 03:11 PM)gusrob Wrote:\n\n(04-17-2020 02:55 PM)jgardne Wrote:\n\n(04-17-2020 09:26 AM)tigertaylor Wrote: the 247 podcast from yesterday says Miller being courted to be assistant GM of the Detroit Pistons\n\nDetroit is in an awful position roster and cap wise.

It's not the whole story, but it has fueled the discussion.\n\nAs for recruiting, Penny does alright, lol. Tony knows a lot of HS/AAU coaches in the south. Cody is looked at as a recruiting asset from his development reputation. And Penny would have no trouble landing another high level recruiter."
