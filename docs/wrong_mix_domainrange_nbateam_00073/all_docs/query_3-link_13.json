        "text": "“I feel I have four, five seasons left in me,” Mike Miller said after the Heat’s 103-84 win over the San Antonio Spurs. “That might have something to do with the fact I haven’t played. Sometimes, there’s light at the end of the tunnel, even when you’re frustrated. I feel great, so hopefully it stays that way.”\n\nAfter scoring nine points on three 3-pointers in Game 2 of the NBA Finals on Sunday, Mike Miller admitted his limited minutes for the Miami Heat this season – and the past two years – have been difficult for him. Yet still, he is fresh at the most critical stage now and has the health to extend his NBA career. “I feel I have four, five seasons left in me,” Miller said after the Heat’s 103-84 win over the San Antonio Spurs. “That might have something to do with the fact I haven’t played. Sometimes, there’s light at the end of the tunnel, even when you’re frustrated. I feel great, so hopefully it stays that way.”\n\nThere was a time, just 10 months ago, when Mike Miller not only didn’t think he would be in position to challenge for playoff playing time, but wasn’t sure he even would be playing. “I was very close to quitting,” he said, as the Miami Heat turned their attention to Wednesday night’s regular-season finale against the Orlando Magic at AmericanAirlines Arena. “If I felt like I was going to be a liability for this team, I was going to.” Then came an offseason of rigorous rehabilitation on his balky back, followed by minimal playing time for the opening months of the season. Now? “Right now,” he said, “I feel great. “The way I feel, I feel better than I have in the last four years.”"
