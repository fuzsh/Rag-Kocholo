        "text": "Despite being the best in his field, he lives in a pal’s basement.\n\nHe cannot remember the last time he was recognized on the street. “Which is fine by me.” The other day he was asked to sign a jersey, but, then again, so were the rest of his teammates.\n\nHe has a social media presence. But just barely, despite family members urging him to ramp up his engagement. “I have a tough time self-promoting, I guess.”\n\nThursday afternoon in a BMO Centre boardroom brimming with athletic specimens — mighty or fleet or both — he can make no boasts. Even in a Winnipeg Blue Bombers hoodie, nothing about him screams football player. “I’m a very average looking man walking about, for the most part.”\n\nYet.\n\nAt some point next year, Mike Miller will take over as the CFL’s all-time special teams tackler.\n\nNo small thing, that. But the unassuming native of Riverview, N.B., offers little more than shrugs about his accomplishments, upcoming or already banked — such as the summer’s day he tied the CFL single-game record for special teams takedowns.\n\nPleasant and soft-spoken and red-bearded, Miller had been a finalist for the league’s special teams player of the year. In advance of Thursday’s awards banquet, he didn’t sit down and write a speech. To memory he committed a few themes — such as the importance of family members and coaches and teammates — and that had been his preparation for what would have been a very short spiel.\n\nIn the end, however, Hamilton Tiger-Cats return ace Frankie Williams earned the honours.\n\nJust as well. “I’m not much of a public speaker,” said Miller. “When I’m surrounded by strangers, I’m very introverted, I would say.”\n\nInstead of attending the CFL’s annual gala, one of his teammates suggested that Miller would have preferred to be watching film in his hotel room, getting ready for the Grey Cup. “He definitely wants to be chilling.”\n\nBut definitely not crowing. His modesty doesn’t matter, though. Since breaking in with the Edmonton Eskimos in 2011, the work has spoken for itself.\n\n“He’s not really a household name,” said Paul Boudreau, special teams co-ordinator of the Blue Bombers, “but every game, he’s in there doing the dirty work. Off the field, he’s pretty mellow, calm. Then the switch goes off … and it turns into a different dude.\n\n“He’s tough as hell. There’s times when you know he’s hurting and you say, ‘You OK?’ And it’s just, ‘Yeah, I’m good.’ He just keeps motoring on, no matter what might be dinging him.”\n\nGood thing, because anchoring all four of Winnipeg’s special team units — Miller handles cover and return for punts and kickoffs — can be grisly business.\n\nA well-established commodity (within the football fraternity), Miller endures double-teaming, potential pancakings by 300-pound meanies, downfield ass-hauling, breakneck improvisation, multiple jarrings. Sometimes all on the same play.\n\n“It’s all-out effort every time,” said Miller. “Punt return is probably one of the most taxing … because you’re trying to hold somebody up for as long as you can, then when they get away from you, it’s a full-on sprint to try to catch up with them — because it’s not over. Without the fist-fighting, it’s basically … like a street fight.”\n\nTwo of his cohorts use the word “scary” to describe special teams deployment at the CFL level, but they’re beaming when they say it. Because it also happens to be “thrilling,” according to Shayne Gauthier, while Nick Hallett calls it “exciting. But I’ve always been a run-as-hard-as-you-can and hit-as-hard-as-you-can kind of guy.”\n\nDefensive sequences, in contrast, are relatively contained — “close,” is how one guy puts it — but special teams are a different beast. It’s an open-throttle “mess,” says a regular, who, not wanting to offend Boudreau, then upgrades his term to “organized chaos.”\n\nBoudreau, of course, coaches up his boys as much as he can. Nevertheless, when the ball’s been booted, things can get hairy in a hurry. “For some guys, everything that’s been taught goes out the window.”\n\nNot so for Miller, which is why he thrives while others lose their way.\n\n“When all hell’s breaking loose, he has a way of weaving his way through all the crap and coming out clean on the other side,” said Boudreau. “Maybe things look differently to him … he knows where people might be and how to fight off different blocks.\n\n“He has an innate ability — a nose for the ball.”\n\nBearing out that knack is the CFL’s record book.\n\nMiller has been credited with 185 career special team tackles. Only Jason Arakgi has managed more, 194, but he retired after the 2016 season.\n\nMeaning Miller takes over top spot next year.\n\n“He’s going to be the best special teams player in the history of the CFL,” said Gauthier. “He knows how to do it. It takes a special mindset and he’s got it.\n\n“When I watch film, I watch what he does. And if you have questions, he’s a good person to go to, asking him how he does this, how he does that. He’s always open to give you great advice.”\n\nWhich, if possible, increases the value of Miller’s presence. The veteran’s work with the Blue Bombers’ youngsters is laudable.\n\n“They see how he’s done it for a long time,” said Boudreau, “and how it’s not just a one-hit wonder.”\n\nGrowing up in Riverview, N.B., where his mom was a teacher and his dad worked for CN, Miller threw himself into as many sports as he could.\n\nHockey, for starters. But soon adding volleyball and track to his pursuits. As part of his high school’s football outfit, he was named defensive player of the year for his New Brunswick conference.\n\nAttending Acadia University, he earned the Axemen’s top rookie honours. As a junior, he was a second-team All-Canadian, then, as a senior, he became one of the team captains.\n\nAnd even though Miller’s phone didn’t ring during the 2011 CFL draft, it buzzed a couple of hours later. The Eskies called to let him know they’d added him to their negotiation list.\n\nStill, there wasn’t much clarity. At rookie camp in Edmonton the coaches weren’t quite sure what to do with the gung-ho newcomer.\n\n“I asked the defensive coordinator where he wanted me,” recalled Miller, chuckling, “and he was like, ‘Wherever you feel comfortable. You’re going to play DB, so pick one of them.’ So I looked at the depth chart and they didn’t have a lot of people playing the boundary-halfback position, so I decided to go there because that’s where I played in university.”\n\nHe advanced to main camp at which point the Eskies decided to shift Miller — and his 208-pound frame — to linebacker. But, no surprise, he showed off his special-team know-how in the preseason. “And that helped me crack the roster,” Miller said. “For me, it was always: how could I contribute to the team? That just happened to be my niche.\n\n“In the CFL, special teams is huge. It’s a big momentum swing for getting good field position. I take a lot of pride in it.”\n\nIn nine seasons — the first six with Edmonton — Miller has finished out of the top 10 in special teams tackles only once (when he settled for 11th). He topped the category in 2016.\n\nAnd this year, with 25 tackles, he tied for second overall with teammate Kerfalla Exuma, who appreciated the opportunity to get a live tutorial every week. Watching No. 24 overcome double-teamed attention had been an education.\n\n“Unbelievable,” said Exuma. “It’s crazy. Because even if he’s on notice and people want to hold him to zero tackles, he’s going to find a way. He’s relentless.”\n\nJuly 5 against the home-field Ottawa Redblacks, he joined a short list of CFL players who have collected seven special teams tackles in a single game. Getting there before Miller were Paul Clatney, Terry Wright, Brendan Rogers, Norman Bradford, Donovan Gans, Darren Joseph.\n\nMiller’s feelings about the feat, predictably, are more aw-shucks than anything. “Just one of those days.”\n\nHe doesn’t have a game ball or the game sheet or any keepsakes from the record-tying evening. As for the eye-catching performance itself, “there’s other games when I think I’ve been in better position … and it just didn’t come my way. It comes down to my teammates doing a great job.”\n\nYeah, right. Nobody else, on either side, wrapped up more than one returner that night. “To put it into perspective,” said Derek Jones, “it’s very common that a guy will have seven (special teams) tackles in a season. To have seven in one game? Outrageous.”\n\nBoudreau’s succinct takeaway? “Holy crap.”\n\nExcelling for one season — or even one game — in the most punishing phase of football is not easy. Nor will it be forever.\n\nMiller’s deal takes him through the 2020 campaign. He’s unsure what will happen after that, not that he’s panicking. “That’s how I’ve always treated my career, I guess,” the 30-year-old said. “Play out this contract and hopefully there’s another contract.”\n\nIt’s all part of a down-the-road decision that will be made in close consultation with his wife Erica, with whom he has two children — son Ethan, 4, and daughter Coady, 1.\n\nMiller is devoted to his family — which is why he tries to keep his offseasons as open as possible — and that commitment is illustrated on his arms.\n\nAfter his CFL rookie season, he got his first tattoo on the right side — Archangel Michael “because of the protector meaning … and me being an older brother to two younger sisters.”\n\nThe theme of his left arm’s inkwork is fatherhood. In honour of his son, there is a picture of a lighthouse and a boy with a lantern on a rowboat. “He’s going to go on his own path, but hopefully I can steer him in the right direction,” explained Miller. “And I got a compass and a silhouette of a dad with his daughter with a treasure map behind it. Same thing — she’s going to go on her own path, but hopefully, I can help steer her in the right direction.”\n\nThese days, though, he’s got only his scrapbook sleeves to keep him company.\n\nErica and the kids returned to New Brunswick at the end of October. “That’s just kind of what we’ve always done.” Nothing superstitious. Just practical. Like, why be on the hook for a full month’s rent in November if the team makes an early playoff exit?\n\nSo he moved into the lower level of Jones’ place, where, as you can imagine, he behaves like a wild man. In actuality, of course, you’d never know he was there, according to his landlord.\n\nMiller laughs about the arrangement, before offering a perfectly in-character response.\n\n“I try to be a good tenant,” he said. “I try not to step on anybody’s toes. I’m just there to sleep and to contribute whatever I can contribute to the house.”\n\n(Photo: Richard A. Whittaker / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"
