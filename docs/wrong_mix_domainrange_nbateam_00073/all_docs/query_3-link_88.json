        "text": "Former Knicks interim head coach Mike Miller will join Mark Daigneault's Thunder staff, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Wednesday.\n\nMiller, not the former NBA sharpshooter of the same name, went 17-27 as Knicks head coach last season. He took over last December when New York fired David Fizdale.\n\nMiller, 56, grew up in Monmouth, Illinois. After playing college basketball at East Texas State (now Texas A&M University-Commerce), Miller started his coaching career in 1989 as an assistant at Western Illinois.\n\nHe landed his first head coaching job at Southwest Texas State (now Texas State) in 1994. The Bobcats went 87-79 in Miller's six seasons. He led the program to its second NCAA Tournament appearance in 1997.\n\nAfter five seasons as an assistant at Kansas State, Miller received his second head coaching opportunity in 2005 at Eastern Illinois.\n\nThe Panthers went 75-130 and 45-85 in the Ohio Valley Conference in Miller's seven seasons.\n\nMiller was named head coach of the G League Westchester Knicks in 2015. He won G League Coach of the Year in 2018.\n\nAfter four seasons with Westchester, Miller was promoted to a Knicks assistant in 2019. He was named interim head coach in his first season on staff.\n\nDaigneault, since being named Thunder head coach two weeks ago, has said assembling his staff is among his top priorities."
