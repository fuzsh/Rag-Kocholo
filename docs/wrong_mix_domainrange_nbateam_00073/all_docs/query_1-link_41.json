He'll continue to coach the Tight Ends unit, while adding Co-Offensive Coordinator duties this season.\n\nIn 2021, Miller served as Maryland's Tight Ends Coach and Passing Game Coordinator. Miller helped the Terps set numerous school records during the year, including the single-season program marks for total yards (5,740), passing yards (3,960), completions (339) and completion percentage (69.3%). Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa also set seven single-season Maryland records in 2021, including program best marks for passing yards (3,860), completions (328), completion percentage (69.2) and passing touchdowns (26 – ties school record).\n\nUnder Miller's tutelage, multiple Maryland tight ends had break-out season in 2021. Chigoziem Okonkwo hauled in 52 receptions for 447 yards and five touchdowns during his senior campaign. He ranked first in the Big Ten in receptions in conference games (41) and second in receiving touchdowns (five). He hauled in 12 receptions against Penn State, marking the second most catches in a game by any Big Ten player in 2021. Okonkwo's 112 receiving yards at Michigan State were the second most by any tight end in a Big Ten game in 2021. Miller also guided then-sophomore Corey Dyches to a strong season in which he made 19 grabs for 208 yards and caught four touchdowns.\n\nIn 2020, Miller oversaw a tight ends unit that helped block for the second best passing offense in the Big Ten. The Terps averaged 264.0 yards per game through the air and their average of 409 total yards per game ranked as the third best total offense in the conference.\n\nIn 2019, Maryland's two tight ends, Okonkwo and Tyler Mabry, combined for 32 receptions for 356 yards and five touchdowns in Miller's first year leading the unit. With a touchdown in each of Maryland's first three games, Mabry became the first Maryland tight end to catch a touchdown pass in three straight games since Vernon Davis in 2005.\n\nSince joining the Maryland staff, Miller was recognized by 247 Sports as one of college football's rising stars in their '30Under30' list for 2019. He was also named to the American Football Coaches Association's 35 Under 35 Coaches Leadership Institute in December of 2021. Miller is one of just 35 coaches out of over 200 nominees to be recognized on the annual list.\n\nMiller joined the Terrapin coaching staff in January of 2019 after spending two seasons as Michael Locksley’s offensive graduate assistant at the University of Alabama from 2017-18. Miller worked primarily with the Crimson Tide quarterbacks and wide receivers.\n\nIn 2018, Alabama’s offense set school records for points scored (684), single-season total offense (7,830 yards) and passing yards (4,854) in a season. The Crimson Tide finished the season averaging 47.9 points and 527.6 yards per game. Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was named first-team All-SEC, won the Walter Camp and Maxwell Awards, and finished second in the Heisman Trophy balloting, threw for 3,189 yards and a school-record 37 touchdowns in 2018. Jerry Jeudy, the 2018 Biletnikoff Award winner, caught 68 passes for 1,315 yards (19.3 avg.) and 14 touchdowns. The Crimson Tide won the 2018 SEC Championship and the 2019 College Football Playoff Semi-Final Orange Bowl.\n\nIn 2017, Miller helped coach an Alabama wide receiver core who combined to catch 128 passes for 2,059 yards and 19 touchdowns led by First Team All-SEC selection Calvin Ridley. Ridley hauled in 63 passes for 967 yards and five touchdowns in his junior season. The Crimson Tide finished the season in dramatic fashion winning on the last play in overtime in the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship.\n\nIn 2016, Miller served as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Charlotte Christian (N.C.) High School. Charlotte Christian finished the season 10-2 and averaged 40 points per game. Under Miller’s guidance, Garrett Schrader went on to become one of the most prolific prep signal callers in the state of North Carolina.\n\nIn 2015, Miller helped coach the quarterbacks as a student coach at Clemson University. The 2015 Tigers had 11 consecutive games with at least 500 yards of total offense, a school record. Deshaun Watson became the first player in FBS history with at least 4,000 passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards in a season. The Tigers had a perfect regular season, won the 2015 ACC Championship and the 2016 College Football Playoff Semifinal Orange Bowl.\n\nMiller was a walk-on quarterback at the University of Alabama-Birmingham in the spring of 2011 and would go on to earn a scholarship in December of 2013. Miller jump-started his career as a defensive student coach at UAB in the fall of 2014.\n\nMiller’s father, Mike Miller Sr., played wide receiver at Ole Miss from 1975-79. His Grandfather, Art Miller, played offensive guard at Duke University for legendary head coach Wallace Wade from 1939-1942.\n\nMiller and his wife, Megan, have three children, Bo, Grisham and Mary Caitlin."
