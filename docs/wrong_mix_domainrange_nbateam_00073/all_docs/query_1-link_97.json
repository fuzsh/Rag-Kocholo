        "text": "CHARLESTON, Ill. -- Mike Miller, associate head basketball coach at Kansas State University, has been named head men’s basketball coach at Eastern Illinois University, effective immediately, EIU athletics director Dr. Rich McDuffie announced Monday.\n\nMiller has been an assistant for the past five years at Kansas State (2001-2005). The Wildcats were 17-12 this year starting three sophomores and a true’ freshman, and had six wins over teams that advanced to postseason tournaments.\n\n“We had applicants from coast to coast. After reviewing the candidates and contacting numerous references, the response we received across the board indicated Mike was one of the best young coaching prospects in America. We met with him at the Final Four in St. Louis and he sold us on his desire to lead our men’s basketball program,” said McDuffie.\n\n“The response from every constituency that Mike visited during his interviews on and off campus confirmed that he indeed is the best fit for Eastern. He’s been a successful Division I head coach directing Texas State (formerly Southwest Texas) to two Southland Conference championships as well as a second place finish. He’s been an associate head coach at Kansas State which competes in an elite high major basketball conference (Big 12). Mike is originally from Illinois (Monmouth) so has the recruiting contacts in a state which produces exceptional prep talent.”\n\n“The returning players were unanimous in their support of Mike Miller. That was an important factor in the decision. They want to compete and succeed under his leadership. Therefore, we’re confident that Mike has the teaching skills, the proper values of educating student-athletes and a plan to take our program to another level,” McDuffie said.\n\n“I believe this is a great time to become head coach at Eastern. I’ve been so impressed by everyone I’ve met,” said Miller. I had an opportunity to visit with President (Lou) Hencken, and he shared his passion and vision for the University. I’ve spent a lot of time the past couple weeks with Rich McDuffie, and certainly am pleased with his direction of the athletic program.”\n\n“There is a very strong foundation at Eastern...as an academic institution, as an athletic program and as a basketball program. There has been success here and with a very good corps of returning players, I’m excited to roll up my sleeves and go to work immediately. This is just a great fit for my family and me. We look forward to becoming part of the community and the University,” Miller said.\n\nDuring the past five years 10 of 14 Kansas State seniors, who completed their eligibility, have graduated and five players earned Academic All-Big 12 honors.\n\nThe past three years the Wildcats recruiting class has been selected in the Top 25 in the nation by Hoop Scoop magazine, and was No. 1 in 2002.\n\nMiller was head coach at Texas State (formerly Southwest Texas) for six years (1995-2000) and directed the Bobcats to the 1997 NCAA tournament. He earned Southland Conference Coach of the Year’ honors that season.\n\nThe ’97 and 1999 teams won Southland Conference regular season championships, and the ’97 club also was a Southland Conference post-season tournament winner. The 1999 team won 19 games, second most in the school’s NCAA Division I history, and ranked third in the nation in field goal percentage defense (37.3%). Texas State ranked as the No. 1 defensive team in the Southland Conference for six straight years.\n\nTexas State was the only Southland Conference team to advance to the post-season tournament semifinals in each of his last four years as head coach there.\n\nMiller was also an assistant at Texas State (1992-94) when the Bobcats earned a 1994 NCAA tournament appearance. At age 29, he became the second youngest Division I men’s basketball coach when he was promoted in March, 1994. Six of Miller’s players earned Academic All-Southland Conference honors, and eight received University Cream of the Crop’ academic honors. Miller also recruited Jeff Foster, a 1999 NBA first round draft selection.\n\nHe was an assistant coach at Sam Houston State in 1991 and Western Illinois in 1990.\n\nA graduate of Monmouth (IL) High School, Miller earned an undergraduate degree from East Texas State in 1987 where he was a two year basketball letter winner. The 1984 East Texas team won the Lone Star Conference championship.\n\nHe and his wife, Kelly, have two sons, Matt (16) and Joey (12).\n\nWHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT MIKE MILLER\n\nTim Floyd, Head Coach, Southern California & former NBA head coach\n\n“I’m very pleased that Mike Miller has been afforded the opportunity to coach at Eastern Illinois University. You are getting a good coach and a great person. Jim Wooldridge (Kansas State coach) and I were college roommates and good friends, so I have known Mike for a number of years. He is an excellent person and a great evaluator of talent...and he relates very well to young players today. I think the ultimate compliment I can pay him is that I would have liked to have hired him at Southern California but I know he wanted a head coaching position so I’m pleased that he can advance his career at Eastern Illinois.”\n\nJim Wooldridge, Head Coach, KansasState\n\n“Mike is just an outstanding person...and obviously a great basketball coach. He does a great job working with student-athletes, is an excellent teacher and does it all with class. I’m thrilled that you’ve selected Mike. Everyone at Eastern will like him because what you see is what you get. He is simply the total package.”\n\nGreg Sankey, Assistant Commissioner, Southeastern Conference & Former Commissioner, Southland Conference\n\n“Mike’s ability to build a program was evident at Southwest Texas where he had continued improvement throughout his six years. I’m confident he’ll be equally successful at Eastern and the people in Charleston will appreciate that he will do it the right way. I wish him and his family all the best...and congratulations to Eastern on a great hire.”\n\nMike Alden, Director of Athletics at Missouri & former Director of Athletics at TexasState"
