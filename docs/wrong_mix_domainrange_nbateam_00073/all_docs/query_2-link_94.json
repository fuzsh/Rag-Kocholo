He won the Southland league and playoff championships in 1997, garnering the program's second-ever NCAA bid, and won the league again two years later. EIU didn't go well at all, with losing seasons in six of his last seven years and no teams that broke into the top 200. EIU had a few teams around the turn of the millennium that were decent and one bid as a 15 seed; Miller's successor has done a whole lot of nothing.\n\n[After THE JUMP: Miller's stock goes up after he hits the G-League.]\n\nAfter leaving EIU he jumped to the Spurs' G-League affiliate as an assistant; two years later the Westchester Knicks made him their head coach. There Miller's had a lot of success in the chaotic G-league. He was the coach who bounced Trey Burke back into the NBA, and he maintained the W-Knicks' success even after losing him:\n\nThis season in particular was a banner year for Miller and the W-Knicks program. The team finished 32-10, tied with (go figure) the Austin Spurs for the best record in the G-League. Westchester finished with the third-best net rating in the league with a +3.7, only behind the Spurs and the Raptors 905 (a team that sports another solid coaching candidate, Jerry Stackhouse). Miller won the G League’s Coach of the Year award. …\n\nMaybe the most important item when finding a new Knicks coach, the Dubs posted elite defensive numbers across the board this season: Miller’s team finished third overall in opponent FG% at 44.4 and second in points allowed per game at 101.5. Defense was a goal all year for Westchester, despite the team’s revolving door of talent throughout the season.\n\n“I think one of the things that happened is, when Trey Burke signed and was gone, we knew that was a big piece of offense that was gone,” Miller said. “We sat down with our group and said, if we don’t become one of the top defensive teams — we had set out to be one of the top five defensive teams, that was something we talked about, we wanted to be one of the best top five teams — and we weren’t there. So we kept moving that way, and got better and better in the second half of the season. I think we defended very well.”\n\nHe won the G-League coach of the year award in 2018, which has a pretty good track record. Other recipients include Stackhouse, Raptors coach Nick Nurse, new Arkansas and former Nevada head coach Eric Mussleman, and Jazz head coach Quin Snyder. Quotes from his team after he won the award—including one from a familiar name—sound a bit like Juwan Howard quotes:\n\nZak Irvin\n\n“Coach Mike is one hell of a coach. It was well deserved that he was able to get Coach of the Year last year and he’s done a good job this year as well, especially when [the] roster changes. You never know [who's] going to be here. He’s able to adapt to that.”\n\nBilly Garrett\n\n\"I thought he would win it the whole time. One thing that makes him so in detail with the player development is he understands everyone’s game and he can dissect it and figure out where you need to improve. Not every coach can do that and he knows how to convey what he’s trying to teach to you and not everybody is capable of that. That’s a strength that he has and it’s the reason why he can develop guys and send guy after guy to the NBA.”\n\nXavier Rathan-Mayes\n\n“It’s just the way he is with guys. He does a great job in helping guys in getting to where they want to be. We go through progress reports every week and where we want to get to and our goals. We set that and lay it out. Obviously, winning as a point guard is big. That’s something he stressed to me is that point guards are looked at upon as winners or losers.\"\n\nMiller's most recent G-League teams were a bit heavy on mid-range jumpers and light on three pointers, but that might have been a function of personnel. In addition to Trey Burke the W-Knicks had Nigel Hayes. In the G-League you get who you get and Miller was handed midrange city, baby.\n\nThe only real negative that pops out to me is recruiting. Miller's never done it at a high- or even mid-major level. Other than that you're getting a guy who got some traction for the Knicks job and is in a G-League COTY award cohort that has a lot of head coach success stories along with important assistants for the Spurs, Heat, and Celtics—three of the best-run organizations in the league. Getting Miller as a college assistant is a small coup."
