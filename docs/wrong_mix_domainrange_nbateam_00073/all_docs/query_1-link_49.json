        "text": "Mike Miller, an 18-year veteran of the collegiate coaching ranks, has developed a strong reputation for turning around programs and has recruited and promoted 20 players to Major League Soccer, including 11 first-round picks, in his coaching career. Originally from East Brunswick, N.J., he completed his fourth season as associate head coach at UConn in 2019.\n\nSucceeding at every stop in his coaching career, Miller has transitioned from a goalkeeper coach at the University of Evansville to a highly respected associate head coach and recruiter at UConn in just an 11-year span – earning a nod to the list of Top Assistant Coaches by College Soccer News in each of the past three years. Additionally, Miller was responsible for bringing in the nation's 12th-best recruiting class of 2019, a class that featured 10 freshman and five Division I transfers.\n\n“Coach Miller has done a great job recruiting for us,” said head coach Ray Reid. “His ability to identify some of the best talent in the country, both domestically and internationally, has aided in the resurgence of the UConn men's soccer program.\"\n\nSince coming to UConn, the Huskies have earned seven selections to the All-American Athletic Conference First Team and had three players chosen in the MLS SuperDraft under Miller’s tutelage – including first round picks Jake Nerwinski (seventh overall, Vancouver) and Kwame Awuah (16th, NYC FC) in January of 2017 and most recently, second-round pick Jacob Hauser-Ramsey (42nd overall, Colorado).\n\nThe Huskies qualified for the AAC semifinals from 2016-2018, including an 12-6-2 record and a trip to the NCAA Second Round during the 2018 campaign. Five players garnered All-Conference recognition in Miller's fourth year on the UConn staff, including Moussa Wade and Ben Awashie who both earned spots on the AAC All-Rookie team. In 2018, Miller coached freshman Ibrahima Diop (All-Conference Rookie Team) and Dayonn Harris (Second Team All-Conference) to conference honors. Six players received All-Conference recognition in each of Miller's first two seasons, including freshmen Blaise N'Gague and Josh Burnett being named to the All-Conference Rookie Team in 2017.\n\nMiller has recruited and coached a long list of MLS draft picks in his collegiate tenure, including eight overall first picks – Nerwinski, Awuah, Miles Robinson (second overall, 2017), Jeremy Embossed (fourth overall, 2017), Julian Buescher (11th overall, 2016), Alex Bono (sixth overall, 2015), and Skylar Thomas (11th overall, 2015).\n\nPrior to UConn, Miller gained Major League Soccer experience with Sporting Kansas City as a domestic scout. His responsibilities included scouting first team, USL and academy players, putting to work his talent of finding highly skilled players. He brought Gianluca Busio to the team, the second-youngest MLS signee all-time, as well as Wan Kuzain bin Wan Kamal.\n\nBefore his time in the professional ranks, Miller served as an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Duke from 2014-16. He was instrumental in the rebuild of Duke’s program, responsible for student-athlete development, fundraising efforts, video analysis and opponent scouting. In three seasons, he produced a pair of top-15 recruiting classes, including a fourth-ranked class in 2014.\n\nMiller left his stamp on the Duke program even after departing for UConn, as the Blue Devils reached the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament and were ranked No. 6 in the RPI at the conclusion of the 2017 season.\n\nBesides the ability to recruit and develop young talent, Miller’s coaching skills have resulted in improved team results at each of his previous stops – including two of the biggest turnarounds of any team in the country while at Evansville (2006) and Syracuse (2012).\n\nServing four years on the Syracuse staff from 2010-14, he received more recognition from College Soccer News as one of the nation’s top assistants in 2013. He was vital in producing three-straight top-40 recruiting classes for the Orange from 2011-13 and was promoted to Head Recruiting Coordinator in 2011 for his efforts.\n\nMost notably, however, Miller’s guidance on the field helped lead the Orange (14-6-1) to a breakout season in 2012 – advancing to the NCAA Round of 16, just the program’s second all-time NCAA postseason appearance. Syracuse finished the year ranked No. 17 in the NSCAA/Continental Tire Poll, after going just 3-12-1 the year before in 2011.\n\nHis 2012 recruiting class at Syracuse was tabbed 14th nationally by College Soccer News, while the group featured a trio of top freshmen – including All-ACC Second Team player Emil Ekbom. In addition to his recruiting duties with the Orange, Miller mentored the goalkeepers, while handling video editing and opponent scouting.\n\nMiller received his master’s degree while serving as an assistant at Evansville from 2006-10, leading the Purple Aces to an incredible turnaround in just his first season with the staff. A team that went 2-14-1 in 2005 improved to a 9-8-0 mark in 2006 with Miller working closely with the goalkeepers, while helping to bring a pair of College Soccer News Top 40 classes during his tenure. He worked with Alec Dufty, Cory Elenio, and Robby Lynch, all MLS players.\n\nHis coaching career began in 2004 as an assistant coach at North Florida, serving his role with the Ospreys until 2006.\n\nMiller received his bachelor’s degree in physical education in 2004 from Jacksonville University, where we played as goalkeeper from 1999-2004. As a student-athlete, he finished fifth in program history in single-season shutouts. A two-time Atlantic Sun Player\n\nof the Week, he earned a spot on the All-Conference Tournament Team in 2001.\n\nHe served as a member of the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA), holding several national coaching licenses and served as the chair on the group’s committee that was responsible for selecting the national assistant coach of the year. Currently, he is on the All-American and Mac Hermann Trophy Committee.\n\nMiller resides in West Hartford with his wife, Anne, daughter, Freya, and son, Stellan"
