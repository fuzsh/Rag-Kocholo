        "text": "Brandon Dill/Associated Press\n\nVeteran NBA swingman Mike Miller will extend his career to a 16th season, as the Denver Nuggets reportedly have signed the 35-year-old to a one-year contract, according to Chris Dempsey of 104.3 The Fan.\n\nESPN.com's Marc Stein reported Miller was in Denver earlier Wednesday and cleared waivers.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers traded Miller to the Portland Trail Blazers earlier in the offseason, unloading cap space to prepare for a championship run. The Trail Blazers then reached a buyout agreement Sunday, per Yahoo Sports' Shams Charania, who also indicated the Nuggets were interested.\n\nDenver will be Miller's fourth different team in as many seasons and his seventh in total since the Orlando Magic selected him with the No. 5 overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft. Miller has managed to carve out a lengthy NBA tenure, even if he never morphed into a franchise-caliber player, as the Magic envisioned.\n\nNew Nuggets head coach Michael Malone can use a veteran like Miller, who was a part of two NBA championship teams in Miami, to help with the team's culture. Malone's full-time predecessor, Brian Shaw, lost his Denver squad, which features talented players but no proven stars.\n\nIt's unlikely that Miller will have a massive role on the court with the Nuggets, but his value will be evident as a leader in the locker room. He is a capable spot-up shooter, he brings size to the wing and he's a smart, savvy defender, which Denver largely lacks on the wing at the moment."
