        "text": "LeBron James said teammate Mike Miller is selfless.\n\nHe said Miller doesn’t worry about numbers or how many minutes he gets.\n\nThe 34-year-old swingman is about winning and sacrificing for the good of the team.\n\n‘(He takes) whatever role is meant for him and understands what he’s here for,’ James said after practice Oct. 26 at Cleveland Clinic Courts in Independence. ‘You can put him in the starting lineup or bring him off the bench and he’s ready to go. There were times in Miami where he didn’t play and he was ready. You have to have guys like that on the roster. You have to have guys that aren’t about ‘me.”\n\nThe 6-foot-8, 218-pound Miller was dumped by Miami before the 2013-14 season. The Heat used their amnesty provision on him to eliminate his salary.\n\nHe signed a two-year, $5.5 million deal with the Cavaliers Aug. 5.\n\nIt brought a smile to James’ face.\n\n‘It means everything,’ James said. ‘I know how instrumental he was in our championship run in Miami. I hated to see him go last year. I’m happy to be back with him once again. Hopefully, we can put together something special here as we make a run at it.’\n\nMiller had a dismal preseason for the Cavaliers. He shot 21.7 percent from the field (5 of 23) and 18.8 percent from the 3-point arc (3 of 16). He averaged 2.4 points and 1.9 rebounds.\n\nCavaliers coach David Blatt attributes Miller’s poor shooting to the players surrounding him on the floor. Blatt said he should have played Miller with players who are creators and find open shots for their teammates.\n\nMiller, though, has two NBA titles to his credit.\n\n‘Our core guys have won championships. But the guys who will be asked to do a lot of stuff on this team have yet to do that,’ he said. ‘That’s the best part about it. At some point, you have to learn that. Talent makes up for a lot. This team has a ton of talent.’\n\nWhen Heat president Pat Riley first put the Miami team together in 2010, it had a terrible beginning.\n\n‘The best thing we learned is the 9-8 start didn’t dictate where we finished,’ Miller said.\n\n‘Fortunately for us, we had an almost identical situation in Miami. We get to take what we learned from the good and the bad and bring it to a different situation and have a second opportunity.’\n\nMiller said there are going to be ups and downs this season.\n\n‘There’s a whole new coaching staff for a lot of us players,’ Miller. ‘There’s a new head coach for all of the players. It’s not going to be easy. Our goal is to be the best Cleveland Cavaliers team in June.’\n\nAfter getting kicked to the curb in Miami – a move that didn’t thrill James – Miller played last season in Memphis.\n\n‘This path I’m on now is where I’m supposed to be,’ he said. ‘I was able to go to Memphis and have a great year, be healthy, and prove to myself more than anybody that I can still do what I want to do at this level. I feel a have a lot of basketball left.’\n\nHe was very proud of appearing in all 82 games for the Grizzlies.\n\n‘In the past, I was always someone who spent a lot of time in the gym,’ Miller said. ‘I figured out at this stage (of my career), less is more. I take more of a mental approach rather than a physical approach. I started realizing it’s more important to be on the court for games rather than (spending) three hours for practice. My wife won’t say this, but I’m starting to wise up a little bit.’\n\nMiller is the backup at shooting guard for now. Rookie Joe Harris is nipping at his heels and trying to get into Blatt’s rotation.\n\nMiller has averaged 11.8 points and shot 40.9 percent from the 3-point line in the first 14 seasons of his career.\n\nQuick shots\n\n* Blatt said backup center Brendan Haywood sat out of the scrimmage in practice Oct. 26. ‘He’s had a little bit of soreness,’ Blatt said.\n\n* James said he wished he could have played with future Hall of Fame point guard Steve Nash, who will miss the Los Angeles Lakers’ season with an injury. ‘You hate to see anyone get their career taken away from them because of injury,’ James said. ‘He has nothing to be ashamed of. He should be proud of whatever he accomplished, including the two MVP awards. If you were playing street basketball, and you were picking guys, you’d never pick him. His run in Phoenix was unbelievable.’\n\n* James has averaged 39.5 minutes per game in his 11 seasons in the NBA. ‘Thirty-nine minutes are a lot,’ Blatt said. ‘We have to keep our wits about us as far as the long term.’"
