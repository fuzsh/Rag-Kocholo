        "text": "Sunday spotlight: Mike Miller's next chapter in Cleveland\n\nThe spectrum of pro sports is littered with athletes who insist they don't do it for the money while offering ample evidence to the contrary.\n\nWho can blame them, right, if the pursuit of championships occasionally takes a back seat to the almighty dollar?\n\nFor Mike Miller, though, the ring is the thing.\n\nThe Mitchell native and 14-year NBA veteran failed to advance beyond the first round of the playoffs in his first 10 pro seasons after leaving the University of Florida, and he's never forgotten that feeling.\n\nMiller finally broke through and captured a pair of titles after joining LeBron James with the Miami Heat, memorably scoring 23 points on seven 3-pointers in Game 5 of the 2012 NBA Finals to clinch his first crown.\n\nSo when James left Miami to return to Cleveland earlier this month and asked Miller to join him, the 34-year South Dakota native faced a hard decision.\n\nHe had gained leverage from a healthy and productive season in Memphis and drew plenty of free agent interest, including a three-year offer worth $12 million from the Denver Nuggets.\n\nMany athletes nearing the twilight of their career would have taken the money and ran. Signing for multiple years at that sort of salary offers security against injury, declining skills and just plain bad luck.\n\nBut King James can be convincing, and Miller was all ears.\n\nThough the Cavaliers could only offer a two-year deal worth $5.5 million (with a player option after the first season), Miller would be in the middle of the action, trying to revive a long-suffering franchise with a four-time MVP and rising stars such as Kyrie Irving and possibly Kevin Love.\n\nIn the end, Miller's decision came naturally. He would take his talents to Cleveland.\n\n\"I had to pick what was best for me basketball-wise, and things will take care of themselves financially,\" the 6-foot-8 swingman told me this week. \"The reason I first started playing was to have fun and to win, and this was a chance to be part of something special again.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you have to love what you're doing, you want it to matter, and going back to Cleveland made it matter at a high level again. I saw it in Miami first-hand, and I think it will be elevated this time around. I can't wait to get started.\"\n\nLeaning on LeBron\n\nMiller's quandary paled in comparison to the drama surrounding James' decision to leave Miami, but their fates were intertwined.\n\nAs LeBron wrestled with his future in the aftermath of an NBA Finals drubbing to San Antonio, he and Miller – friends since James' high school days in Akron – texted back and forth to brainstorm scenarios.\n\nSince Miller had been waived by Miami via the NBA's amnesty clause following the 2012-13 season (a salary cap move that rankled LeBron), the South Dakota native was not allowed to return to the Heat.\n\nJames wanted to know whether his former teammate would be willing to join him if he left Miami to start a new chapter elsewhere, while Miller mainly sought career advice from the world's best player.\n\n\"We had contact back and forth,\" says Miller, who averaged 7.1 points for Memphis last season while shooting 45.9 percent on 3-pointers, second-best in the NBA. \"I was just bouncing ideas off him as far as where I should go. He's intelligent and understands the game of basketball so well, I was basically saying, 'What do you think would fit best?'\"\n\nOnce James made up his mind to leave, staggering the pro sports world with his \"I'm Coming Home\" proclamation, the answer to Miller's question was simple: You should come to Cleveland.\n\nThe problem was that the Cavs opened the coffers for LeBron but didn't have enough cap space to offer Miller the moon, especially if they still hope to trade for Love. Just as he did when he opted to sign with Miami in 2010, Miller would leave money on the table, earning $2.7 million in 2014-15.\n\nIf he played well and stayed healthy, he could opt out after that season and seek more money from the Cavs through the NBA's Larry Bird Exception, which allows teams to pay the maximum to retain established roster players (Miller qualifies because he was amnestied).\n\nIf Miller's back flares up again or he simply doesn't play well? Well, that was the gamble.\n\nIt was such a crucial decision that Miller went beyond his circle of basketball advisors to reach out to his original brain trust, parents Tom and Sheryl.\n\n\"He doesn't do that very often, but he did on this one,\" says Tom, 65, a former Mitchell educator who now lives in Sioux Falls. \"He said, 'I can take more money and sort of relax or sign for less money and put a little more pressure on myself. I think I'm going to bet on myself.' It was tough to argue with that.\"\n\nAdventure begins\n\nSo the next chapter begins for Miller and his family – wife Jennifer, sons Mason (13) and Mavrick (10) and daughter Jaelyn (3). They're looking for a home in the Cleveland area and the boys will start school in August as their father prepares to embark on what proves to be a memorable NBA adventure.\n\n\"My family is excited,\" said Miller, whose career 3-point percentage of .409 ranks 18th in NBA history. \"They know what makes me happy, and I never would have assumed that I would have this opportunity again. I knew that it was the sort of decision where if I didn't do it this way, I would regret it down the road.\"\n\nThis will be Miller's sixth team since he was drafted fifth overall by the Orlando Magic out of Florida in 2000 and earned NBA Rookie of the Year honors. His career path has weaved through Orlando, Memphis (twice), Minnesota, Washington and Miami as he appeared in 913 games and racked up 10,773 points.\n\nIn addition to being seen as one of the league's most lethal 3-point marksmen, Miller has earned a reputation as a hard-working \"team first\" player who provides positive energy, even when injuries and other factors affect his minutes.\n\nLeBron is no dummy. He knows the young and unproven Cavs will need solid veterans to set the tone if they hope to claim their first-ever championship. They have already lured James Jones from Miami and Miller is on record saying they should bring in 39-year-old Ray Allen as well.\n\nWhen you add that to Cleveland's recent trio of No. 1 picks (Irving, Anthony Bennett, Andrew Wiggins) or ponder a roster shuffle involving Love, things could get very interesting in the East.\n\n\"If you put LeBron on any team, you have a chance,\" says Miller. \"But Cleveland is being smart about what they're doing, taking their young talent and adding in guys who have been to the playoffs and experienced those situations so they can help show the way.\"\n\nThat's what Miller signed up for, rather than take the easy way out. He figures he has a few more seasons to live out his basketball dream, and he doesn't plan to do it near the bottom of the standings.\n\nFor those who recall him playing under Gary Munsen in Mitchell, lighting up the Corn Palace and making a national splash with summer sizzle, it's been one heck of a ride.\n\n\"We couldn't have asked for anything more,\" says Tom Miller, who plans to spend a lot of time in Cleveland watching his son play.\n\n\"It seems like just yesterday that we were flying to Orlando to sign his rookie contract, and now he's a veteran playing with LeBron. It's like a whole new adventure.\"\n\nArgus Leader Media sports editor Stu Whitney can be reached at swhitney@argusleader.com.
