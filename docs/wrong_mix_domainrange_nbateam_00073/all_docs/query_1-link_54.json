That group ultimately included three members of the BIG EAST’s All-Freshman team -- Trey Alexander, Ryan Nembhard and Arthur Kaluma.\n\nMiller also worked closely with the CU defense that ranked 19th best nationally per KenPom in 2021-22, and 14th in 2022-23.\n\nThe South Dakota native arrived at Creighton after serving the previous five seasons at TCU as an assistant coach (2016-18) and assistant head coach (2018-21).\n\nThe Horned Frogs reached the postseason three times with Miller on staff, including a 2018 NCAA Tournament trip that was the program’s first bid to the Big Dance in 20 seasons. TCU’s nine Big 12 wins that season remain a program record.\n\nIn Miller’s first campaign as an assistant coach at TCU, the Horned Frogs improved from 12 wins to 24 victories and claimed the 2017 NIT title. TCU’s 24 victories were tied for the second-most in program history.\n\nMiller is regarded as one of the top recruiters in the country and helped to lure future NBA First Round pick Desmond Bane to TCU. Before his time in Fort Worth, Miller was part of a UNLV staff that landed the nation’s No. 11 and No. 5 ranked recruiting classes in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\nDuring his time at UNLV, Miller developed and coached Rashad Vaughn, who was selected No. 17 overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2015 NBA Draft. A 2014 McDonald’s All-American and five-star recruit, Vaughn was ranked as high as No. 8 nationally coming out of Findlay College Prep. He was named Mountain West Freshman of the Year at UNLV after averaging 17.8 points and 4.8 rebounds per game.\n\nMiller was named the fourth-best recruiter outside the Power 5 while at UNLV by ESPN’s Jeff Borzello and Adam Finkelstein and had a hand in the Rebels garnering commitments from two\n\nTop-100 signees in 2015 in five star Stephen Zimmerman, who was rated the nation’s No. 12 player by ESPN, and Derrick Jones, a four-star recruit who was ranked in the top-50 nationally. Another notable student-athlete during Miller’s stay at UNLV was Christian Wood who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nMiller has also been an assistant coach at Auburn, New Mexico, Pepperdine and Memphis. Miller has coached in six NCAA Tournaments, won five regular-season titles and one league tournament title on the sidelines.\n\nPrior to his time at UNLV, Miller spent two years as an associate head coach at Auburn between 2012-14. Before that, Miller served five seasons as an assistant coach at New Mexico under Steve Alford. During his tenure, the Lobos went 126-46 overall and made five consecutive postseason trips, including a pair of NCAA Tournament berths. New Mexico also won two regular-season Mountain West Conference Championships and one league tournament crown. Miller spent 2006-07 as an assistant coach at Pepperdine before joining the New Mexico staff.\n\nHe began his college coaching career as the video coordinator and Assistant Director of Basketball Operations at Memphis under John Calipari between 2003-06. During his three years with the Tigers, Memphis compiled a 77-28 record and appeared in three postseasons, including two NCAA Tournament trips. In 2006, Miller aided in guiding the Tigers to the Sweet 16. Among those he worked with while at Memphis is new Creighton assistant Derek Kellogg.\n\nThe Mitchell, S.D., native attended Northern State, where he was a two-time Northern Sun All-Conference selection. He finished his career eighth on Northern State’s all-time scoring list after leading his teams to four straight conference championships and the 1998 regional title.\n\nHe was named a Division II All-American and an Academic All-NSIC member as a senior in 1997-98 and earned his bachelor’s degree in physical education from Northern State in 2000.\n\nMiller was drafted by the CBA in 1999 and played professionally for the Fargo-Moorhead Beez of the International Basketball Association. He also saw action for the Dakota Gold of the IBA where he served as player/assistant coach during the 2000-01 campaign.\n\nMiller attended Mitchell High School where he was a two-time All-State pick and led the school to the 1994 state championship.\n\nHis brother, Mike, played 17 years in the NBA and was named NBA Rookie of the Year in 2001 and the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2006. Mike also won back-to-back NBA Championships with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013, respectively.\n\nMiller and his wife Marna have two daughters, Melia and Halle. He is the uncle of Bluejay forward Mason Miller.\n\nThe Ryan Miller File\n\nPersonal\n\n• Wife - Marna\n\n• Children – Melia and Halle\n\nCollegiate Coaching Experience\n\n• Creighton - Assistant Coach, 2021-Present\n\n• TCU - Assistant/Associate Head Coach, 2016-21\n\n• UNLV - Assistant/Associate Head Coach, 2014-16\n\n• Auburn - Associate Head Coach, 2012-14\n\n• New Mexico - Assistant Coach, 2007-12\n\n• Pepperdine - Assistant Coach, 2006-07\n\n• Memphis - Assistant Director of Basketball Operations/Video Coordinator, 2003-06\n\nProfessional Playing Experience\n\n• Dakota Gold - 2000-01\n\n• Fargo-Moorhead Beez - 1999-2000\n\nCollegiate Playing Experience\n\n• Northern State - Guard, 1994-98\n\nCollege Education\n\n• Northern State - B.S.
