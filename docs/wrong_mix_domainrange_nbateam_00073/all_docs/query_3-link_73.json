        "text": "Mike Miller was quick to admit his transition from player to coach remains a work in progress.\n\nSpeaking to the media for the first time since taking the field for training camp three weeks ago as the Blue Bombers’ new special-teams co-ordinator, Miller said there has certainly been an adjustment.\n\nAmong them: having to lead less by example and more with his voice, while also getting over any stage fright that comes with commanding a large group of people. While he’s often prided himself in giving teammates one-on-one instruction, having to lead an entire group of men through different schemes has had its unique challenges.\n\n“My voice has definitely been strained, beyond belief, like it’s never had before,” Miller said shortly after the Bombers wrapped up practice Monday, ahead of Thursday’s regular-season opener against the visiting Montreal Alouettes. “I’ve obviously stumbled and mumbled in meetings or said something wrong in context or whatever, but the guys have been great. They’ve bought-in since Day 1 and made it a lot easier transition because they’ve been supporting me through this whole training camp.”\n\nMiller was given the job at the end of last season — a season in which the CFL’s all-time special-teams tackler, with 226, didn’t make a single play. In fact, the 35-year-old was never cleared to ever take the field, plagued by what turned out to be not only a season-ending, but career-ending neck injury sustained in training camp.\n\nRefusing to accept the severity of his injury, Miller looked to get a second opinion and, ultimately, a second chance at extending his football career. When it wouldn’t come, the Bombers helped ease his forced retirement by offering him a coaching job, with Miller taking over for Paul Boudreau, whose contract wasn’t extended and has since joined the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.\n\n“I’ve always respected my coaches and all the work they did, and to put us, when I was a player, in great positions to be successful,” Miller said. “But you do appreciate more the amount of hours they put in and I can understand some of the frustrations they have when they put that many hours in and someone doesn’t do the right thing.”\n\nBombers head coach Mike O’Shea has been impressed with what he’s seen so far and understands there will be inevitable hiccups as he works to get more comfortable. There have also been moments where Miller’s presence and resume speak for itself.\n\n“He can be going along talking and he may pause for a split second, maybe be looking at the guys, and he doesn’t really need to say anymore – the message is understood,” O’Shea said. “I like the fact that he wasn’t sure whether he was ready or not. If you have never done it before and you come in thinking, yeah, I got this, I don’t know it’s going to go where he wants. You’re always learning in this profession and wanting to do well and understanding that maybe you don’t have all the answers but that’s OK. I think that’s something you got to learn is you don’t have all the answers.”\n\nOLIVEIRA READY TO GO: Brady Oliveira practised for the first time Monday after sitting out all of training camp. The Bombers star running back suffered an injury while training in the offseason, but said he’ll be ready to go against the Alouettes.\n\n“Maybe a little bit of over-training,” Oliveira said. “Definitely something that I’m going to look at heading into the next off-season. Maybe my load of training, maybe it’s been a little bit too much.”\n\nBombers safety Brandon Alexander also returned to the field for the first time this year and has been cleared to play.\n\nSMITH CUT, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN: There were some eyebrows raised Sunday morning when the Bombers announced their cuts and had released returner Chris Smith. After all, Smith had provided what little excitement there was in the Bombers’ preseason finale, returning a punt 109 yards for a touchdown in a 31-10 loss to the Calgary Stampeders.\n\nTurns out, Smith suffered an injury a short time later that’s put his immediate future in doubt. He remains with the team getting medical care and could be an option once he’s healthy again.\n\n“We’ll see,” O’Shea said. “He was exciting. I thought it was a nice return. Good blocking on that return, too.”\n\nReceiver Myron Mitchell appears to be front-runner to take over return duties.\n\n“We had a handful of returners at camp,” the coach said. “The guys did a great job of bringing returners in also. So, we had lots of choice. Stylistically, there are going to be some differences between certain guys, but I think there’s a bunch that can get the job done, for sure.”\n\nJeff.Hamilton@freepress.mb.ca\n\nX: @jeffkhamilton"
