        "text": "According to nba.com, the New York Knicks announced the addition of Westchester Knicks head coach Mike Miller to the Knicks coaching staff for the upcoming season. Miller joins the Knicks after four seasons with the Westchester Knicks, the NBA G League affiliate of the New York Knicks. Miller, 55 years old, compiled a 108-92 record with Westchester. In the 2017-18 season, Miller guided the club to a franchise-record 32 victories as the team finished with the best record in the Eastern Conference and earned the Atlantic Division title for the first time in franchise history. That earned him the NBA G League Dennis Johnson Coach of the Year. Miller is a 1982 graduate of Monmouth High School and was a big part of the Zipperâ€™s runnerup finish in the 1982 IHSA State Finals. Among his 25 years of coaching experience, he has head coached in the college ranks at Texas State University and then served as the head man at Eastern Illinois University from 2005-2012 before moving on to the G-League in 2015. While at Texas State, he led the Bobcats to the Southland Conference regular season and tournament championship, advancing to the NCAA Tournament in 1997, and winning the League Championship again in 1999. As a college player, he played basketball at East Texas State, where he was a part of the team that won the 1984 Lone Star Conference championship."
