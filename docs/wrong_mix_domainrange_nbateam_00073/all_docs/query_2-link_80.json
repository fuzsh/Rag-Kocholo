        "text": "Mike Miller's roller coaster life that is professional coaching has brought him back to where it all began.\n\nMiller recently was named the offensive coordinator at Robert Morris University. Miller began his coaching career at Robert Morris in 1997 as a graduate assistant under longtime Colonials coach Joe Walton.\n\n“Robert Morris is a very special place to me,” Miller said. “Coach Walton gave me my first opportunity as a coach, and then I had the opportunity to go back for one season, in 2006. Getting the opportunity to work under coach Walton and coach Rad (former defensive coordinator Dan Radakovich) may have been the best coaching experience I ever had.”\n\nMiller also had the opportunity to work with John Banaszak during that 2006 season, and the two remained close. Now the coach at Robert Morris, Banaszak turned to Miller, who had gone on to spend several years in the NFL, when he was looking for a new offensive coordinator.\n\n“John and I have been friends since we worked together in 2006,” Miller said. “He contacted me and said he was making some changes and wanted to know my situation. We talked about it, and I told him coming back to Robert Morris was something I would be very interested in.”\n\nBanaszak’s phone call came at the perfect time in Miller’s life. Miller was out of coaching for a year after a job in a professional developmental league didn’t work out. He also was seriously injured in a car accident last year on Ohio River Boulevard that left him recuperating for nearly three months.\n\n“It was a tough time,” Miller said. “I leaned on my family and my girlfriend, Julia, to help me through it. My cousin, Dan Glatz, is a physical therapist and he got me right. So, this opportunity at Robert Morris came at a time when I really needed it.”\n\nMiller’s road back to University Boulevard had many stops along the way.\n\nHe spent 13 seasons in the NFL, first as Steelers offensive quality control coach from 1999-2003, then two seasons as tight ends coach for the Buffalo Bills (2004-05). After his brief return to Robert Morris in 2006, he spent six seasons with the Arizona Cardinals as wide receivers coach (2007-08), passing game coordinator (2009-10) and offensive coordinator (2011-12).\n\nDuring his time at Arizona, he coached All-Pro wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald and helped the Cardinals reach Super Bowl XLIII against the Steelers. In that 2008 season, Fitzgerald, Anquan Boldin and Steve Breaston had more than 1, 000 receiving yards each, a feat accomplished only five times in NFL history.\n\nMiller and Fitzgerald have remained close.\n\n“We keep in touch,” Miller said. “The thing that’s impressive about Larry is he’s a big time player, a Hall of Fame player. But he’s an even better person.”\n\nSince leaving the Cardinals, Miller spent time coaching in the Canadian Football League and one season on the college level at Edinboro, meaning the recruiting process won’t be completely foreign to him.\n\n“These guys have such a great system in place,” Miller said. “Coach (Andrew) Richardson and coach (Scott) Farison are so detailed and so organized. This is going to sound cliché, but this program sells itself. The coaching staff we have, coupled with the tremendous academics at Robert Morris, I just have to jump in at the very end and present what we do on offense and where we feel they fit in.”\n\nMiller will inherit some offensive talent. The Colonials return promising quarterback Matt Barr, who started as a freshman, reigning NEC Offensive Rookie of the Year Kyle Buss at receiver and both starting running backs.\n\n“My goals are team goals, which first and foremost is to win the NEC, and we’re capable of doing that this year,” Miller said. “We’ve got the players in place. I can’t wait to get started in the spring. I’m excited to come to work every day.”"
