        "text": "Mike Miller's stint as assistant coach at the University of Memphis is over after two seasons.\n\nThe 40-year-old Mitchell native and former NBA standout, who was making $500,000 a year, tweeted Wednesday that he intends to \"spend more time focused on family and wherever the journey will take me next.\"\n\nWidely regarded as the Tigers' most valuable recruiting assistant, the former first-round draft pick who won two NBA championships with the Miami Heat has spent the past two seasons on Penny Hardaway's staff.\n\n\"The past two years have been amazing, and I have so many people to thank: Coach Hardaway for believing in me, all our players for their commitment, the University of Memphis and its incredible fans, my wonderful wife and kids, and the entire city of Memphis for everything you have done for me and my family,\" Miller's full statement reads. \"All of you made this opportunity possible for me, and I'm truly grateful. As much as I've loved this job and had a blast being part of the special program Coach is building, the past few months have made me realize that it's time for me to spend more time focused on family and wherever the journey will take me next.\"\n\nHardaway wished Miller well in a statement: \"We will stay in touch and I'm looking forward to him attending practices from time to time.\"\n\nFor Miller, family time means more basketball time with his sons. Mason and Mavrick will be a senior and sophomore, respectively, at Houston High in Germantown, Tenn. Mason is a 6-foot-9, four-star power forward with offers from Memphis, Creighton and TCU who played in last year's Hoop City Classic in Mitchell and Sioux Falls.\n\n\"It’s a long journey, but it goes fast,” Miller told the Argus Leader in 2019 about Mason's recruitment process. “I told him to just enjoy it and stay focused. A lot of kids get caught up in rankings and what schools offered them, but it’s not about that. It’s about getting better every day and seeing the big picture.”\n\nMiller’s recruiting experience served him well as an assistant coach at Memphis, where he joined Hardaway’s staff in April of 2018.\n\nTogether with Hardaway, the former Memphis phenom and NBA standout, Miller helped bring star power to living rooms while building a 2019 recruiting class ranked No. 1 nationally by most scouting sites, beating out Kentucky, Arizona and Duke.\n\nHe is credited with spearheading the recruitment of class of 2020 standouts Precious Achiuwa, Lester Quinones and Boogie Ellis.\n\nMiller helped Memphis reach the National Invitation Tournament in 2019. The Tigers' 2020 season was cut short when the AAC Tournament, NCAA Tournament and NIT were all cancelled in the ongoing effort to combat the spread of coronavirus.\n\n“It’s a learning situation that has helped me grow as a person,” Miller said of his coaching role. “The basketball doesn’t change, so a lot of it comes down to relationships. You work hard to get kids and families to trust that you’ll have a positive effect on their lives.\"\n\nMiller spent a total of seven seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies as a player across two stints. The NBA Rookie of the Year for the Orlando Magic in 2001 was also named the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year in 2006 after averaging 13.7 points and 5.4 rebounds with the Grizzlies.\n\nMiller owns and operates Let It Fly Sports Bar, which opened in Germantown in October 2019. Miller is also part-owner of multiple BurgerFi locations, including one in Germantown.\n\nJason Munz of the Memphis Commercial Appeal contributed to this story."
