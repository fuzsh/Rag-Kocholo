Nobody promised you're going to be in the second round [of the playoffs]. There's people that have never been in the second round; there's people that have never been in the NBA finals. So, in my first seven seasons, I'm not viewing it as, 'I lost.'\"\n\"It was a learning experience, so hopefully, this moment, instead of thinking that we lost something, we can gain and learn in order for us to put ourselves in a position to win another championship.\" Thank you Giannis for another fantastic season. \nThe World Champion Milwaukee Bucks and Milwaukeeâ€™s MVP! \nPhotographed for Brietling Watches by Mike Miller Images. \n #thankyou #giannis #milwaukeebucks #milwaukee #brietling #watches #advertisingphotography #commercialphotography #creativedirector #blackandwhitephotography #marketing #mikemillerimages #bucksin6 #deerdistrict #basketball #milwaukee #greatfulness #milwaukeephotographer\".",
