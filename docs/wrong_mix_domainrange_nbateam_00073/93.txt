Mike Miller, Mitchell, SD native, is being inserted into the Cleveland Cavaliers starting line-up, where he'll be given a shot to prove himself at the shooting guard position.

Miller, who is a former 1st round pick from the University of Florida, is in his 15th NBA season. During his time in the league he's played with six different teams, including a stint in Miami where he won two NBA championships (2012 and 2013).

At 34 years old, it's safe to say Miller's days of playing professional basketball are numbered, but he could fill a much needed void in the short term for the Cavs. He's known for his impressive 3-point shooting, having shot over 40% from beyond the arc throughout his career.

The Cleveland Cavaliers will play at home tonight against the Brooklyn Nets.
