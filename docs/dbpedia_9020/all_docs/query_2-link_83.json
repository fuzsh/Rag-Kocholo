        "text": "To Liberate Me from the detestable yoke of foreignness,… I implore you to change my surname,” Umberto Terchig begged Italian authorities in Venezia Giulia, Italy&#39;s new northeastern border territory incorporated in the wake of the Habsburg collapse. In Venezia Giulia, comprised of several of the provinces of the former Austrian Adriatic littoral, some 1,000 individuals in the population of approximately 350,000 requested surname changes over the period from the end of World War I in 1918 to the Fascist takeover in 1922. Most petitioners hailed from Trieste and the city&#39;s immediate surroundings. Their level of education and relative sophistication varied. Nonetheless, these individuals shared a particular “nationality consciousness” that led them to choose name change as a means to establish national belonging in Italy. Former Habsburg subjects, like Umberto Terchig, living throughout the successor states sought to rearticulate ethnic and national identities to reflect persona...\n\nThe essay presents several ideas regarding the management of the «Adriatic Question» in the period following World War II, focusing particular attention on the strategies of the political centre-left, of «Moroteism» and of «border Catholicism» aimed at getting beyond the legacy of the conflict and achieving a normalisation of Italo-Yugoslav relations after the return of Trieste to Italy in 1954. The analysis reconstructs the conciliatory path of two bordering states, formerly divided by a heated national, political and ideological rivalry. Drawing a parallel between the choices made centrally and those made locally, the work furthermore examines the connection between Aldo Moro’s Ostpolitik and the line taken by Trieste’s Christian Democrats, both of which aimed to put an end to controversy on the eastern front – the «Adriatic normalisation», following the «defence of Italianness» – in a situation characterised by a lowering of tensions between the blocks, by the reorganisation of international Communism and by the multilateralism of the Helsinki Conference. The aim of this paper is therefore to shed light upon how and with what consequences Moro’s «Peace in the Security» and Triestine Moroteism’s «bridge border» strategy – leading principle of the Giulian Christian Democrats throughout the Sixties and Seventies – established on the one hand a relationship of collaboration with Tito’s Yugoslavia (culminating in the Treaty of Osimo in 1975) and on the other designed a new political, economic and national function for the eccentric region of Venezia Giulia, whose sovereignty had been long contested and had been severely penalised in the wake of the second world war. The paper will be based on new documentation from: Archivio Democrazia cristiana di Trieste, Fondo segreteria Democrazia cristiana nazionale, Fondo Giulio Andreotti, Fondo Aldo Moro, Fondo Sergio Coloni, Christian Democrats newspapers.\n\nA critical legal thinking analysis of autonomy in Südtirol/Alto Adige is useful for rethinking Italian sovereignty in the province. Initiating with articles 5, 6, and 116 of the Italian Constitution (1948) and subsequently with two statutes of autonomy (1948 and 1972) with several amendments, a particular system of law was constructed in the context of the Italian regional state. Several historical events have also determined the current Südtirol/Alto Adige autonomous status. Most notably during the aftermath of World War I, it was subject to a change in sovereignty from Austria to Italy. Soon after, during the fascist period, a failed attempt at so-called Italianization dramatically lessened the rights of the Ladin and German-speaking majority. Moreover, following the devastation of World War II autonomy was granted but not fully accepted in its original form by the majority of the population in Südtirol/Alto Adige. As a consequence, the political movement for selfdetermination became more relevant and terrorist violence emerged. The international community stepped up to the conflict and the Italian government established a new form of autonomy that brought justice and peace. Thereafter, Südtirol/Alto Adige's autonomy has received support and recognition from the United Nations, the European Union, and other international organizations.\n\nThe question of sub-state nationalism in Italy assumes some peculiar characteristics because territorial fractures have existed since the birth of the Italian nation-state, and in recent decades new sub-state nationalist movements were born on the edge of these cleavages. Although some sub-state nationalist groups are seeking apparently new declinations of the nationalist claim, the majority moves according with the traditional sub-nationalist ideology. The devolvement of powers is one of the successful strategies to disempower the centrifugal pressures coming from ethno/regionalist/sub-state parties and movements and to accommodate ethno-regional claims. At the same time, it responds to a functional reorganization of the state. But, of course, autonomy is not independence and it does not imply any form of recognition of national identity. On the one hand, there is a functional problem of governance and of optimal scale for policy decisions. On the other hand, there are the claims o..."
