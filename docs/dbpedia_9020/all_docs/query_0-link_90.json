(b) worker opposition to Communist domination of the CGT is beginning to appear and could, if it deve- loped rapidly as the majority of workers realized the revolutionary and political implications of a general strike, frustrate a prolonged general strike; (c) the Government could make the strike a clear political issue and enlist the workers in a back to work movement, thus discrediting the Communist CGT leadership. (CIA Comment: CIA concurs with the view that a majority of the workers would not support a general strike of a purely poli- tical nature. CIA believes however, that the Communists will re- frain from calling such a believes, at this time in order to avoid pre- cipitating a showdown with the Government.) FAR EAST 2.

The struggle between the civilian ele- ments in the coup, headed by Abhaiwong, and the military under Phileul will be complicated by efforts of the ousted Free Thai move- ment to regain power in the elections scheduled for February 1948.

According to the Foreign Office, Bevin has informed the two leaders-in-exile that he is encouraged by \"the measure of agreement\" they have reached, and he has told Prieto that he is ivoosed to sanctions against Snain and to intervention by the UN. (Prieto and Gil Robles met in London in mid-October with tacit UK anoroval and reached agreement on many major outstand- ing issues which have prevented the formation of an anti-Franco centrist coalition. However, they did not agree on the procedure for forming an interim government. In order to compel Franco to step down, Gil Robles pr000sed to enlist the aid of the Vatican. (Bevin has long believed that Spanish opposition groups, ex- cluding Communists, should be encouraged to reach agreement on a successor regime to Franco and that outside interference serves only to strengthen Francois position. Bevin also feels strongly that the Western democracies can not deal with Franco.) 2.

Al- though the London \"emigres\" reportedly believe that their president, Zalewski, will remain the unquestioned head of Polish emigres in Europe, they fear that Mikolajczyk may split the Polish emigre move- ment by attracting an important following in the US.

The Embassy expects this resistance to increase greatly if the new Government imposes a secret ballot for strikes and provides adequate police protection for workers refusing to go on strike. In many industries where secret ballots have been held, the majority of workers have reportedly opposed strike action. 4. CZECHOSLOVAKIA: ji ewsen Czechmloyakeitation.- - res ident Benes has personally expressed to US Ambassador Stein- hardt his belief that recent Communist defeats--in the Slovak crisis and in the removal of Fierlinger, left-wing President of the Social Democratic \"arty--have restored balance in the Government and have bolstered the morale of non-Communist leaders and the gen- eral public. Benes anticipates that the Communists will make at least two more efforts to influence the May elections through intim- idation, or even terrorization, but he believes that the severity of any future crisis will be less pronounced. Steinhardt adds that the Czechoslovak president, who apparently has recovered substantially from his stroke, showed more hostility toward the Communists than at any previous meeting.

(Such a procedure, following the Far Eastern Commission model, would permit exercise of the veto by the US, the USSR, the UK, and China.) The Australian Minister has indicated to the Department that Australia would cooperate if it obtains either a fifth-power veto, or the power to exercise the British veto. EUROPE 6.

Source stated that in this campaign the Communists would: (a) make conditions for leives and children of US officials \"increasingly disagree- able if not actually dangerous\"; (b) persecute Hungarian employees of the Legation; and (c) attempt to suppress US commercial films and the US information service bulletin. Chapin believes that increased Com- munist activity in Hungary is coordinated with some broad Soviet plan for domination in Western Europe and reflects the \"complete readiness\" of the Hungarian Government to cooperate with the USSR. 'V ITALY: Easing, of war damage claims held necessary�US Ambassador Dunn considers that payment by Italy of war claims advanced by nationals of UN members will cause a severe setback to the internal economy If 3 Approved for Release: 2018/09/26 CO2643634 Approved for Release: 2018/09/26 CO2643634 Italy. The claims, according to Dunn, total approximately 250 billion lire of which some 28% is being sought by US citizens. Dunn believes that payment by Italy of these claims will allow Italian Leftists to contend that the US is \"giving aid with one hand while demanding reparations with the other.\" As a possible means of easing Italy's financial burden, Dunn suggests either that: (a) the US allow Italy to use in its budget the lira funds which will accrue from the new interim aid bill; or (b) France, the UK, and the US agree to permit settlement of these claims from the liquidation of German assets In Italy.

Source also states that \"Communist shock troops\" will demonstrate against increased transport fares. These demonstrations, source adds, will not be undertaken without the Soviet Embassy's anproval and are not to approximate an in- surrection because Moscow does not want a Communist coup to gain power but wants rather to destroy the French economy. Mollet may...be acting for Communists--US Ambassador Caffery renorts that a number of French political observers are wondering whether Guy Monet, left-wing Socialist leader, \"despite Communist criticism of his action, may not turn out to be the French Pietro Nenni.\" Caffery points out that: (a) Monet rallied a Social- ist majority in the Socialist Directing Committee to defeat a com- promise economic program, supported by Blum and Ramadier, which probably would have avoided the present political crisis; and (b) Mallet announced the proposed Blum cabinet before President Auriol had advised Ramadier, thereby making it difficult, if not impossible, for Rarnadier to remain as premier.

The Chinese Foreign Minister told Ambassador Stuart that China is prepared to accept US super- vision at least comparable to that contemplated in connection with US aid to Europe. (CIA Comment: The Chinese proposal is the first official reaction to the tentative outline of $300 million in US aid to China recently suggested by Secretary Marshall. The expressed willing- ness of the National Government to accept US controls and to institute a \"program of fundamental internal reform\" indicates the desperation to which the National Government has been re- duced by deteriorating military and economic conditions. However, whether the Nationalists are capable of effecting such reforms, even if willing to do so, remains questionable.)

This reoort, together with reports of Com- munist-instigated disturbances even in Belgium (where the Com- munist Party is relatively weak), suggests that a further Commu- nist motive may be to arouse the fear in the US Congress that all of Western Eurone is so dominated by Communism that US backing of the European recovery program would be useless.) 4.

Riddleberger considers that such a step would represent a radical departure from the basic policy and propaganda of the USSR which professes to support the unity of Germany against the desire of the Western Powers for its partition and exploitation. Riddleberger observes, however, that the USSR may take some less extreme action, such as the establishment of a zonal government along national lines or the promotion of a new political grouping for non-Communist elements.

On the sub- ject of autonomy for the native populations of North Africa, Soustelle showed \"considerable reserve\" and appeared to believe that such aspirations would disappear if the standard of living among the natives could be raised.
