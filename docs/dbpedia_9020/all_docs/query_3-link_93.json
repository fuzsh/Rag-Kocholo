        "meta_description": "How could a state’s distanced approach to the welfare of its national subjects shape experiences at the end of empire? In this article, I consider this question by looking at the relationship between the Italian state and the departure of Italians from Egypt after 1945. The article presents a sociopolitical history of how experiences and expectations of welfare have shaped relations between the state and its migrant subjects at the end of empire. I argue that the regional strategies of the postwar Italian state turned away from institutional support of Italian residents in Egypt as a means of positioning itself closer to Nasser’s government after 1954 and, in doing so, marginalised the interests of migrant Italians even while it relied on interwar narratives about their importance for Mediterranean political kinships. The article begins by using oral history to understand how the memories of repatriated Italians from Egypt framed the historical context of experiences and expectations of welfare support in relation to the state. It then looks back to the political conjuncture of the early 1950s and its reverberations among Italians in Egypt seeking to re‑establish their lives after the Second World War, the collapse of fascist imperialism, and decolonisation. It examines how, at the very moment the two new republics moved closer together one another, Italian residents in Egypt were kept at a strategic distance by the Italian state and its diplomatic actors in Egypt. With the so‑called unmixing of the colonial sea, then, it looks at how Italians sought – and failed to acquire – aid and assistance from the Italian state when departing from Egypt and how this contoured the perspectives of Italian repatriates.",

They also want their relations with the countries hosting them to go undisturbed .”\n\nMarginalising community\n\nBecoming refugees\n\n27Carmelo De Lorenzo, a teacher born in Cairo, wrote to then Prime Minister, Antonio Segni, one of the pioneers of Italy’s movement towards European integration. De Lorenzo had arrived in Genoa nearly one month earlier, after having been made redundant in Egypt. His son, a designer for the Arabic‑language el‑Moqattam newspaper, had also been dismissed at the beginning of the Suez conflict. De Lorenzo identified himself as “an Italian without political affiliation” and advised Segni that a similar letter had been sent to all the local Genovese newspapers. The only paper that had agreed to publish his letter was an unspecified one on the “political Left” and he asserted that other papers (he specifically mentioned Secolo xix and Nuovo Cittadino) had promised publication but then declined, stating that the letter expressed strongly worded anti‑governmental sentiments.\n\nA fading institution\n\n84 ACGA, Belleli Alberto fu Vittorio cl. 1883, “notizia sulla Società Italiana di Beneficenza di Ale (...)\n\n“1) to procure work for the unemployed; 2) to oversee the institutionalisation of impoverished children and the recovery of the elderly; 3) to grant subventions – in money or material form – to those who merit them; 4) to propose to consular authorities necessary [cases for repatriation]; and 5) to assist the sick at home or in hospitals .”\n\n39By 2000, the SIB had assumed full control of the Casa di Riposo and located a group of Egyptian nurses to care for its residents. The care home was overseen by Antonio Rollo, formerly an electrician whose grandfather had migrated to Egypt in the early 20th century. Rollo managed the day‑to‑day activities of the care home. The SIB was run by Francesco Monaco, who carries the name of his paternal grandfather, founder of a pork production industry that had lasted for three generations in Egypt. Once a household name among Italian and European residents, Monaco closed its 100‑year‑old production in 2012, after being required to import pork from Brazil following the mass culling of pigs ordered by the then president, Hosni Mubarak during the swine flu scare of 2009."
