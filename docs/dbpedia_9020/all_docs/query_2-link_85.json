        "text": "(Reference Office: D.G.IT. – DESK III)\n\nWhile pointing out that citizenship matters fall within the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry, the following is an outline of the regulations in force with specific reference to the procedures that can be activated at the Foreign Ministry’s consular offices.\n\nItalian citizenship: brief introduction\n\nItalian citizenship is currently regulated by Law No. 91 of February 5, 1992 (and its implementing regulations, particularly Presidential Decree No. 572 of October 12, 1993 and Presidential Decree No. 362 of April 18, 1994) which, unlike the previous law, revaluates the importance of individual will and intention in the acquisition and loss of citizenship and recognises the right to hold more than one citizenship at the same time.\n\nThe principles on which Italian citizenship is based are the following:\n\ntransmissibility of citizenship by descent, i.e. for having Italian parents or ancestors (principle of “ius sanguinis”);\n\nacquisition of citizenship based on the principle of “iure soli” (by birth on the Italian soil) in certain cases;\n\npossibility of multiple nationality;\n\nexpression of will for the acquisition and loss of citizenship.;\n\nAs from August 16, 1992 (when Law No. 91/92 came into force), the acquisition of a foreign nationality does not lead to the loss of Italian citizenship unless the Italian citizen formally renounces it (Article 11 of Law No. 91/92), subject to international agreements.\n\nItaly’s denunciation of the 1963 Strasbourg Convention means that, as from June 4, 2010, Italian citizenship is no longer automatically lost by the Italians who become naturalised citizens of the countries that are signatories to the Convention (following the denunciation of the Convention by Sweden, Germany, Belgium, France and Luxembourg, the current signatories are Austria, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands).\n\nAcquisition of citizenship\n\nItalian citizenship can be acquired in one of the following ways:\n\nCitizenship by descent, i.e. for having Italian parents or ancestors (principle of the ius sanguinis\n\nArticle 1 of Law No. 91/92 lays down that a person acquires Italian citizenship when born of a father or a mother who are Italian citizens. Hence the principle of ius sanguinis – already enshrined in the previous legislation – is reaffirmed as a key principle for the acquisition of citizenship, while the principle of ius soli remains an exceptional and residual case.\n\nWhile explicitly stating that also the mother can transmit citizenship, the Article fully acknowledges the principle of equality between men and women with regard to the transmission of the status civitatis.\n\nRecognition of the possession of citizenship to foreigners descending from Italian ancestors who emigrated to countries where the principle of ius soli is in force.\n\nWhile Article 1 of the Law of 1912 reaffirmed the principle of recognition of Italian citizenship through paternal lineage to the citizens’ children regardless of their place of birth, as already provided for in the Civil Code of 1865, Article 7 of Law No. 555/1912 was meant to ensure that the children of Italian emigrants could maintain the link with their ascendants’ country of origin, thus introducing an important exception to the principle of single citizenship.\n\nIn fact, Article 7 of Law No. 555/1912 enabled the children of Italian citizens, born in a foreign State which had granted them citizenship according to the principle of ius soli, to retain the Italian citizenship acquired at birth, even if the parents lost it when minors, thus recognizing to the persons concerned the significant right to renounce it when becoming of legal age, if living abroad.\n\nThat special rule derogated not only to the principle of single citizenship, but also to the principle whereby the fate of the minor children’s citizenship depended on the father, as provided for by Article 12 of Law No. 555/1912.\n\nHence the conditions required for such recognition are based, on the one hand, on the demonstration of descent from the person originally having the status of citizen (the ancestor who emigrated) and, on the other, on the proof that there were no interruptions in the transmission of citizenship (failed foreign naturalization of the ancestor before the birth of the children; absence of declarations of renunciation of Italian citizenship by further descendants before the birth of the next generation, thus proving that the transmission of citizenship did not stop.\n\nThe procedures for recognizing the possession of Italian citizenship iure sanguinis were specifically formalized in circular letter No. K.28.1 of April 8, 1991 of the Interior Minister, the legal validity of which was not affected by the subsequent entry into force of Law No. 91/1992.\n\nThe authorities competent for carrying out the related ascertainment procedures shall be determined according to the place of residence: for those living abroad, it is the competent consular office having territorial jurisdiction.\n\nThe recognition procedure follows the following steps:\n\n– to ascertain that lineage started with an Italian ancestor (there are no limits of generations);\n\n– to ascertain that the Italian ancestor retained Italian citizenship until the birth of the descendants. The lack of naturalization or the date of any naturalization of the ancestor shall be proven by a certificate issued by the competent foreign authorities. Descent from the Italian ancestor shall be proven by means of civil status documents of birth and marriage; said documents shall be duly legalized, where requested, and accompanied by an official translation. In this regard, it should be noted that the transmission of Italian citizenship through maternal lineage is possible only for children born after January 1, 1948, e.g. the date of entry into force of the Constitution. It shall be certified that neither the applicant nor the ascendants have ever renounced Italian citizenship – thus interrupting the transmission of citizenship – through appropriate certificates issued by the competent Italian diplomatic and consular authorities.\n\nThe applicant shall submit his/her application accompanied by the required complete documentation designed to prove the requirements and conditions listed above.\n\nThe application shall be submitted to the consular office of the district in which the foreigner of Italian origin lives.\n\nCitizenship by marriage to an Italian citizen or by civil partnership\n\nThe acquisition of citizenship by the foreign or stateless spouse of an Italian citizen is regulated by Articles 5, 6, 7 and 8 of Law 91/92 and subsequent amendments.\n\nThe foreign spouse can acquire Italian citizenship upon request, if the following requirements are met:\n\nin Italy: two years of legal residence after marriage or since the date of acquisition of Italian citizenship by naturalization of the spouse; abroad: three years after marriage or since the date of acquisition of Italian citizenship by naturalization of the spouse. These terms are halved in case of children born of or adopted by the spouses;\n\nvalidity of marriage for the Italian legal system and registration of the marriage certificate with the competent Italian Municipality, as well as persistence of the marriage bond until the adoption of the decree;\n\nabsence of convictions for offences leading to a maximum penalty of three years of prison or convictions by a foreign judicial authority of over one year for non-political offences, when the conviction has been registered in Italy;\n\nabsence of convictions for one of the crimes and offences listed in Book 2, Title I, Chapters I, II and III of the Criminal Code (offences against the State);\n\nabsence of obstacles relating to the security of the Italian Republic;\n\ncertified knowledge of the Italian language at a level no lower than B1 of the “Common Reference Framework for Knowledge f Languages” (rule in force for the applications submitted starting from December 4, 2018).\n\nPeople living abroad shall currently submit an online application to acquire the Italian citizenship, according to the new procedure established by the competent Interior Ministry.\n\nThe applicant shall register on the dedicated portal, called PORTALE SERVIZI, at the following url: https://www.interno.gov.it/servizi/servizi-line and, once logged in, will have access to the online procedure for submitting the citizenship application.\n\nIn order to facilitate the identification of the diplomatic-consular Representation territorially competent to receive the application, at the above mentioned Internet address there is a link which enables the user – after having selected the country of residence – to choose, by means of a drop-down menu, the competent Representation by accessing a list which includes the entire diplomatic-consular network of the selected country.\n\nThe user shall fill in all the fields in the form and enclose the following mandatory documents required by the Interior Ministry to apply for citizenship (please note that the E.U. Regulation No. 2016/1191, which entered into force on February 16, 2019, provides for the exemption from legalisation provided that public documents are issued to an EU citizen by the authorities of his/her Member State of nationality):\n\nbirth certificate of the country of origin (in compliance with the legalisation/apostille and translation requirements laid down by the legislation in force), complete with all personal details, or, in the event of documented impossibility to obtain it, a certificate issued by the diplomatic-consular authorities of the country of origin, stating the applicant’s exact personal details (name, surname, date and place of birth), as well as paternity and maternity;\n\ncriminal record certificate of the country of origin, and of any third countries of residence and countries of which the applicant holds citizenship (in compliance with the legalisation/apostille and translation requirements under current legislation);\n\nreceipt of payment of 250 euros;\n\nidentitydocument: photocopy of s valid passport (pages with personal data, photograph, dates of issue and expiry) or identity card;\n\ncertificate of knowledge of the Italian language at a level not lower than B1 of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) or qualification issued by a public or officially certified private educational institution recognized by the Ministry of Education, University and Research and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.\n\nThe CLIQ (Certificazione Lingua Italiana di Qualità) certifying bodies – possibly in collaboration with local Italian cultural institutes – are only the University for Foreigners of Siena, the University for Foreigners of Perugia, the University of Roma Tre and the Società Dante Alighieri.\n\nThe following people are not required to provide a qualification or certification proving knowledge of the Italian language:\n\nforeigners (even if resident abroad) who have signed the integration agreement referred to in Article 4 bis of Legislative Decree No. 286/1998 (Consolidated Act on Immigration);\n\nholders of an EU (or EC) stay permit for long-term residents referred to in Article 9 of the above stated Consolidated Act.\n\nIn order to find out which educational institutions are authorised to issue the requested certification, please consult the dedicated web page of the Italian language portal (portale della Lingua Italiana).\n\nAfter the online submission, the applicant will be summoned by the diplomatic-consular Representation that received the application for identification and for fulfilling the other procedures necessary to finalise the application, including the acquisition of the original documents attached to the application submitted online and any other document that may be useful for its examination. In this regard, it should be noted that, if the applicant is an EU citizen, the marriage certificate, the family status certificate and the spouse’s Italian citizenship certificate are replaced by self-certification in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 445/2000 and most recently with Law No. 183/2011.\n\nApplicants who are nationals of a non-EU country may be exempted from submitting the marriage certificate, the family status certificate and the spouse’s Italian citizenship certificate, only if these documents are already in the possession of the diplomatic-consular Representation.\n\nPursuant to Article 4, paragraph 5, of Presidential Decree No. 572/93, the Interior Ministry may request other documents as appropriate.\n\nPlease note that, in accordance with the Interior Ministry’s directive of March 7, 2012, as from June 1, 2012, competence to issue decrees granting citizenship lies with:\n\nthe Prefect in case of applications submitted by foreigners legally residing in Italy;\n\nthe Head of the Department for Civil Liberties and Immigration, if the foreign spouse resides abroad;\n\nthe Interior Minister if there are reasons relating to the security of the Republic.\n\nTo all intents and purposes, we suggest you to consult the website of the Representation competent by residence.\n\nFollowing the publication in the Official Journal (issue No. 22 of January 27, 2017) of Legislative Decrees No. 5, 6 and 7 of January 19, 2017 – adopted pursuant to Art. 1, paragraph 28, of Law No. 76 of May 20, 2016 (Rules and regulations on civil partnerships between same-sex persons and rules and regulations on living together) – as from February 11, 2017, applications for Italian citizenship may be submitted online, pursuant to Articles 5 and 7 of Law No. 91/1992, also by foreign citizens who have established civil partnerships with Italian citizens, entered in the civil status registers of the Italian Municipality .\n\nCitizenship granted as a result of acknowledgment of paternity/maternity or judicial ruling on paternity/maternity when minors\n\nLaw No. 91/92 attaches particular importance to the acquisition of citizenship when minors as a result of:\n\na) acknowledgment of paternity / maternity or judicial ruling on paternity / maternity;\n\nb) adoption;\n\nc) parent’s naturalization.\n\na) Citizenship through acknowledgment of paternity / maternity or judicial ruling on paternity / maternity\n\nA minor who is acknowledged by an Italian citizen to be of Italian parentage or is declared to be of Italian parentage through a judicial ruling on paternity / maternity is an Italian citizen (Article 2, paragraph 1, of Law No. 91/92).\n\nCitizenship granted as a result of adoption when minors\n\nItalian citizenship is granted to any minor child adopted by an Italian citizen by means of a ruling of the Italian judicial authorities or, in case of adoption abroad, by means of a ruling issued abroad and made effective and binding in Italy, through an order (issued by the Juvenile Court) for registration in the Civil Status Registers.\n\nAdoptees of legal age can acquire citizenship by naturalization after 5 years of legal residence in Italy since adoption.\n\nCitizenship granted to minors as a result of parents’ naturalization\n\nIn accordance with Article 14 of Law No. 91/92, “The minor children of those who acquire or reacquire Italian citizenship, while living together with them, shall acquire Italian citizenship but, after coming of legal age, they can renounce it, if in possession of other citizenship”.\n\nHence the acquisition of citizenship takes place automatically only when they live together and the person is not of legal age, in accordance with the Italian legal system.\n\nFor the parents who have become Italian to pass their status civitatis onto their children, the following three conditions shall be met:\n\n– there is a parent-child relation; children are not of legal age; parents live together with their children.\n\nArticle 12 of Presidential Decree No. 572/93 clearly lays down that the condition of living together shall be stable and effective, as well as certified with appropriate documents, and shall also exist at the time of parents’ acquisition or reacquisition of citizenship.\n\nChoice of citizenship following acknowledgement of parentage when adults\n\nIf the acknowledgement or judicial ruling regards adults, they acquire Italian citizenship only if they express their will to do so within a year of the ruling by means of a “choice of citizenship” (Article 2, paragraph 2, of Law No. 91/92).\n\nIn the event that the acknowledgement or judicial ruling concerns adults, pursuant to Article 3 of Presidential Decree No. 572 of October 12, 1993 (Regulations for implementing Law No. 91/92), the declaration for choosing citizenship referred to in Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Law shall be accompanied by the following documents:\n\n– birth certificate (for exactly identifying the person concerned);\n\n– acknowledgement certificate or certified copy of the ruling with which paternity or maternity is declared;\n\n– parent’s citizenship certificate.\n\nThese above stated certificates are the prerequisite for requesting citizenship.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that the judicial ruling of acknowledgement of parentage may have been made abroad: in this case, the one-year period for making the declaration to choose citizenship shall be calculated from the date on which the foreign ruling is made effective and binding in Italy.\n\nCitizenship granted as a result of benefits granted by law to certain groups of people (Article 4)\n\nThis type of acquisition, regulated by Article 4 of Law No. 91/92, refers to cases that apply only to the Italian territory. Hence reference shall be made to the Interior Ministry for the relevant regulations.\n\nGranting of citizenship pursuant to Article 9 (including work carried out for the State)\n\nArticle 9 of the Law envisages the granting of Italian citizenship by Decree of the President of the Republic, providing for different ways and methods based on specific requirements and graduating the period of legal residence required to legitimize the submission of the related application.\n\nAs a general rule, legal residence on the Italian territory for at least ten years is required for non-EU foreigners (Article 9, subparagraph f), but there are many cases for which the period of residence required is shorter:\n\n– 3 years of legal residence for the foreigners whose father, mother, or any of the second-degree ascendants in a direct line were Italian by birth or for the foreigners born in Italy and residing there;\n\n– 4 years for the citizens of an EU Member State;\n\n– 5 years of legal residence following adoption for the foreigners of legal age or following the recognition of the status of stateless people or political refugees.\n\nThe requirement of residence is not envisaged for the foreigners who worked also abroad for the Italian State for at least five years (Article 9, subparagraph c).\n\nAs to the cases which apply only to the Italian territory, reference shall be made to the Interior Ministry for the related regulations.\n\nArticle 9, paragraph 2, lays down that Italian citizenship may be granted by Decree of the President of the Republic – after hearing the Council of State’s opinion and with a prior resolution of the Council of Ministers, upon proposal of the Interior Minister, jointly with the Foreign Minister – to foreigners who rendered eminent services to Italy, or when there is an exceptional interest of the State.\n\nThe starting of the procedure does not require an initiative by the person concerned, but requires a proposal made by bodies, organizations, public personalities, associations, etc., proving a thorough assessment of the existence of the requirements established by law.\n\nThe procedure envisages that the opinions of the law enforcement agencies and, for those living in Italy, of the Prefecture of the place of residence are obtained.\n\nIt is, however, necessary to obtain the declaration of agreement by the party interested in acquiring citizenship.\n\nEven in this case, the Presidential Decree granting Italian citizenship is not effective and binding if the person concerned, when living abroad, does not take an oath of allegiance to the Italian Republic before the relevant consular authorities, as provided for by Article 10 of the Law.\n\nThe achievement of the Italian status civitatis shall be effective and binding as from the day following the oath.\n\nGranting of citizenship based on the principle of ius soli as a residual and supplementary criterion\n\nItalian citizenship is granted to:\n\n– the subjects born on Italian soil whose parents are unknown, stateless or cannot pass their citizenship onto their children, in accordance with the laws of the State of which they are citizens (Article 1, paragraph 1, subparagraph b, of law No. 91/92);\n\n– the children of unknown parentage who are found abandoned on Italian soil, whose citizenship cannot be ascertained (Article 1, paragraph 2, of Law No. 91/92).\n\nLoss of citizenship\n\nItalian citizens can lose citizenship automatically or formally renouncing it.\n\nCitizenship is lost automatically by:\n\nany Italian citizen who voluntary enlists in the armed forces of a foreign country or accepts a government post with a foreign State, despite this is expressly prohibited by Italian law (Article 12, paragraph 1, of Law No. 91/92);\n\nany Italian citizen who served during a state of war with a foreign country, held a government post or acquired citizenship of that State (Article 12, paragraph 2, of Law No. 91/92);\n\nadoptees whose adoption is revoked by fault of their own, provided that they hold or acquire citizenship of another country (Article 3, paragraph 3, of Law No. 91/92) .\n\nRenunciation of Italian citizenship\n\nThe following subjects lose citizenship provided that they formally renounce it:\n\nadoptees of legal age, following revocation of adoption by fault of their own, provided that they hold or reacquire citizenship of another country (Article 3, paragraph 4, of Law No. 91/92);\n\nany Italian citizen living abroad and holding, acquiring or reacquiring citizenship of another country (Article 11 of Law No. 91/92);\n\nany subject of legal age who acquired Italian citizenship as a minor, following the acquisition or reacquisition of citizenship from either parents, provided he / she holds citizenship of another country (Article 14 of Law No. 91/92).\n\nIn case of residence abroad, the declaration for renouncing citizenship shall be made at the competent consular office. It shall be accompanied by the following documents:\n\n– birth certificate issued by the Municipality where the birth certificate is registered;\n\n– certificate of Italian citizenship;\n\n– documentation relating to the possession of foreign citizenship;\n\n– documentation relating to residence abroad, where required.\n\nThe minor does NOT lose Italian citizenship if one or both parents lose it or reacquire foreign citizenship.\n\nReacquisition of citizenship\n\nThe reacquisition of citizenship is regulated by the provisions of Article 13 of Law No, 91/92. In particular, citizens living abroad, who lost their citizenship, can reacquire it, pursuant to paragraph 1, subparagraph c), with a prior specific declaration to the consular office, if they take up residence in Italy within a year since said declaration;\n\nWomen married to foreigners prior to January 1, 1948, who – by virtue of marriage – automatically acquired their husbands’ citizenship, lost the Italian citizenship and can reacquire it, even though they live abroad, by means of a declaration.
