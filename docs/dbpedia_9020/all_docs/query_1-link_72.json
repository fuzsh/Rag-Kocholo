These frontiers are traced on the maps attached to the present Treaty (Annex I). In case of a discrepancy between the textual description of the frontiers and the maps, the text shall be deemed to be authentic.\n\nArticle 2\n\nThe frontier between Italy and France, as it existed on 1 January 1938, shall be modified as follows:\n\n1. Little St. Bernard Pass\n\nThe frontier shall follow the watershed, leaving the present frontier at a point about 2 kilometres northwest of the Hospice, crossing the road about 1 kilometre northeast of the Hospice and rejoining the present frontier about 2 kilometres southeast of the Hospice.\n\n2. Mont Cenis Plateau\n\nThe frontier shall leave the present frontier about 3 kilometres northwest of the summit of Rochemelon, cross the road about 4 kilometres southeast of the Hospice and rejoin the present frontier about 4 kilometres northeast of Mont d'Ambin.\n\n3.

Marco, crosses the railway connection between the above railway and the Sagrado-Cormons railway, skirts the Gorizia cemetery, which is left in Italy, passes between Highway No. 55 from Gorizia to Trieste, which highway is left in Italy, and the crossroads at point 54, leaving in Yugoslavia the towns of Vertoiba and Merna, and reaches a point located approximately at point 49;\n\n(viii) Thence the line continues in a southerly direction across the Karst plateau, approximately 1 kilometre east of Highway No. 55, leaving on the east the village of Opacchiasella and on the west the village of Iamiano;\n\n(ix) From a point approximately 1 kilometre east of Iamiano, the line follows the administrative boundary between the provinces of Gorizia and Trieste as far as a point approximately 2 kilometres northeast of the village of San Giovanni and approximately 0.5 kilometre northwest of point 208, forming the junction of the frontiers of Yugoslavia, Italy and the Free Territory of Trieste.\n\nThe map to which this description refers forms part of Annex I.\n\nArticle 4\n\nThe frontier between Italy and the Free Territory of Trieste shall be fixed as follows:\n\n(i) The line starts from a point on the administrative boundary between the provinces of Gorizia and Trieste approximately 2 kilometres northeast of the village of San Giovanni and approximately 0.5 kilometre northwest of point 208, forming the junction of the frontiers of Yugoslavia, Italy and the Free Territory of Trieste, and runs southwestward to a point adjacent to Highway No. 14 and approximately 1 kilometre northwest of the junction between Highways Nos. 55 and 14, respectively running from Gorizia and Monfalcone to Trieste;\n\n(ii) The line then extends in a southerly direction to a point, in the Gulf of Panzano, equidistant from Punta Sdobba at the mouth of the Isonzo (Soca) river and Castello Vecchio at Duino, about 3.3 kilometres south from the point where it departs from the coastline approximately 2 kilometres northwest of the town of Duino;\n\n(iii) The line then reaches the high seas by following a line placed equidistant from the coastlines of Italy and the Free Territory of Trieste.\n\nThe map to which this description refers forms part of Annex I.\n\nArticle 5\n\n1. The exact line of the new frontiers laid down in Articles 2, 3, 4 and 22 of the present Treaty shall be determined on the spot by Boundary Commissions composed of the representatives of the two Governments concerned.\n\n2. The Commissions shall begin their work immediately on the coming into force of the present Treaty, and shall complete it as soon as possible and in any case within a period of six months.\n\n3. Any questions which the Commissions are unable to agree upon will be referred to the Ambassadors in Rome of the Soviet Union, of the United Kingdom, of the United States of America, and of France, acting as provided in Article 86, for final settlement by such methods as they may determine, including, where necessary, the appointment of an impartial third Commissioner.\n\n4. The expenses of the Boundary Commissions will be borne in equal parts by the two Governments concerned.\n\n5. For the purpose of determining on the spot the exact frontier laid down in Articles 3, 4 and 22, the Commissioners shall be allowed to depart by 0.5 kilometre from the line laid down in the present Treaty in order to adjust the frontier to local geographical and economic conditions, provided that no village or town of more than 500 inhabitants, no important railroads or highways, and no major power or water supplies are placed under a sovereignty other than that resulting from the delimitations laid down in the present Treaty.\n\nSECTION II\n\nFRANCE\n\n(Special clauses)\n\nArticle 6\n\nItaly hereby cedes to France in full sovereignty the former Italian territory situated on the French side of the Franco-Italian frontier defined in Article 2.\n\nArticle 7\n\nThe Italian Government shall hand over to the French Government all archives, historical and administrative, prior to 1860, which concern the territory ceded to France under the Treaty of 24 March 1860 and the Convention of 23 August 1860.\n\nArticle 8\n\n1.

Any person so opting shall retain Italian citizenship and shall not be considered to have acquired the citizenship of the State to which the territory is transferred. The option of the husband shall not constitute an option on the part of the wife. Option on the part of the father, or, if the father is not alive, on the part of the mother, shall, however, automatically include all unmarried children under the age of eighteen years.\n\n3. The State to which the territory is transferred may require those who take advantage of the option to move to Italy within a year from the date when the option was exercised.\n\n4.

For the purposes of this Article, the rules relating to the effect of options on wives and on children, set forth in Article 19, paragraph 2, shall apply.\n\n5. The provisions of Annex XIV, paragraph 10 of the present Treaty, applying to the transfer of properties belonging to persons who opt for Italian nationality, shall equally apply to the transfer of properties belonging to persons who opt for Yugoslav nationality under this Article.\n\nSECTION III\n\nFREE TERRITORY OF TRIESTE\n\nArticle 21\n\n1.

The Italian Government shall cooperate with the United Nations in, and shall provide at its own expense all necessary facilities for, the search for and restitution of property liable to restitution under this Article.\n\n5. The Italian Government shall take the necessary measures to effect the return of property covered by this Article held in any third country by persons subject to Italian jurisdiction.\n\n6. Claims for the restitution of property shall be presented to the Italian Government by the Government of the country from whose territory the property was removed, it being understood that rolling stock shall be regarded as having been removed from the territory to which it originally belonged. The period during which such claims may be presented shall be six months from the coming into force of the present Treaty.\n\n7. The burden of identifying the property and of proving ownership shall rest on the claimant Government, and the burden of proving that the property was not removed by force or duress shall rest on the Italian Government.\n\n8. The Italian Government shall restore to the Government of the United Nation concerned all monetary gold looted by or wrongfully removed to Italy or shall transfer to the Government of the United Nation concerned an amount of gold equal in weight and fineness to that looted or wrongfully removed. This obligation is recognised by the Italian Government to exist irrespective of any transfers or removals of gold from Italy to any other Axis Power or a neutral country.\n\n9. If, in particular cases, it is impossible for Italy to make restitution of objects of artistic, historical or archaeological value, belonging to the cultural heritage of the United Nation from whose territory such objects were removed by force or duress by Italian forces, authorities or nationals, Italy shall transfer to the United Nation concerned objects of the same kind as, and of approximately equivalent value to, the objects removed, in so far as such objects are obtainable in Italy.\n\nSECTION III\n\nRENUNCIATION OF CLAIMS BY ITALY\n\nArticle 76\n\n1. Italy waives all claims of any description against the Allied and Associated Powers on behalf of the Italian Government or Italian nationals arising directly out of the war or out of actions taken because of the existence of a state of war in Europe after 1 September 1939, whether or not the Allied or Associated Power was at war with Italy at the time, including the following:\n\n(a) Claims for losses or damages sustained as a consequence of acts of forces or authorities of Allied or Associated Powers;\n\n(b) Claims arising from the presence, operations, or actions of forces or authorities of Allied or Associated Powers in Italian territory;\n\n(c) Claims with respect to the decrees or orders of Prize Courts of Allied or Associated Powers, Italy agreeing to accept as valid and binding all decrees and orders of such Prize Courts on or after 1 September 1939 concerning Italian ships or Italian goods or the payment of costs;\n\n(d) Claims arising out of the exercise or purported exercise of belligerent rights.\n\n2. The provisions of this Article shall bar, completely and finally, all claims of the nature referred to herein, which will be henceforward extinguished, whoever may be the parties in interest. The Italian Government agrees to make equitable compensation in lire to persons who furnished supplies or services on requisition to the forces of Allied or Associated Powers in Italian territory and in satisfaction of non-combat damage claims against the forces of Allied or Associated Powers arising in Italian territory.\n\n3. Italy likewise waives all claims of the nature covered by paragraph 1 of this Article on behalf of the Italian Government or Italian nationals against any of the United Nations which broke off diplomatic relations with Italy and which took action in cooperation with the Allied and Associated Powers.\n\n4. The Italian Government shall assume full responsibility for all Allied military currency issued in Italy by the Allied military authorities, including all such currency in circulation at the coming into force of the present Treaty.\n\n5. The waiver of claims by Italy under paragraph 1 of this Article includes any claims arising out of actions taken by any of the Allied and Associated Powers with respect to Italian ships between 1 September 1939 and the coming into force of the present Treaty, as well as any claims and debts arising out of the Conventions on prisoners of war now in force.\n\n6. The provisions of this Article shall not be deemed to affect the ownership of submarine cables which, at the outbreak of the war, were owned by the Italian Government or Italian nationals. This paragraph shall not preclude the application of Article 79 and Annex XIV to submarine cables.\n\nArticle 77\n\n1. From the coming into force of the present Treaty property in Germany of Italy and of Italian nationals shall no longer be treated as enemy property and all restrictions based on such treatment shall be removed.\n\n2. Identifiable property of Italy and of Italian nationals removed by force or duress from Italian territory to Germany by German forces or authorities after 3 September 1943 shall be eligible for restitution.\n\n3. The restoration and restitution of Italian property in Germany shall be effected in accordance with measures which will be determined by the Powers in occupation of Germany.\n\n4. Without prejudice to these and to any other dispositions in favour of Italy and Italian nationals by the Powers occupying Germany, Italy waives on its own behalf and on behalf of Italian nationals all claims against Germany and German nationals outstanding on 8 May 1944, except those arising out of contracts and other obligations entered into, and rights acquired, before 1 September 1939. This waiver shall be deemed to include debts, all inter-governmental claims in respect of arrangements entered into in the course of the war, and all claims for loss or damage arising during the war.\n\n5. Italy agrees to take all necessary measures to facilitate such transfers of German assets in Italy as may be determined by those of the Powers occupying Germany which are empowered to dispose of the said assets.\n\nPART VII\n\nPROPERTY, RIGHTS AND INTERESTS\n\nSECTION I\n\nUNITED NATIONS PROPERTY IN ITALY\n\nArticle 78\n\n1. In so far as Italy has not already done so, Italy shall restore all legal rights and interests in Italy of the United Nations and their nationals as they existed on 10 June 1940 and shall return all property in Italy of the United Nations and their nationals as it now exists.\n\n2. The Italian Government undertakes that all property, rights and interests passing under this Article shall be restored free of all encumbrances and charges of any kind to which they may have become subject as a result of the war and without the imposition of any charges by the Italian Government in connection with their return. The Italian Government shall nullify all measures, including seizures, sequestration or control, taken by it against United Nations property between 10 June 1940 and the coming into force of the present Treaty. In cases where the property has not been returned within six months from the corning into force of the present Treaty, application shall be made to the Italian authorities not later than twelve months from the coming into force of the present Treaty, except in cases in which the claimant is able to show that he could not file his application within this period.\n\n3. The Italian Government shall invalidate transfers involving property, rights and interests of any description belonging to United Nations nationals, where such transfers resulted from force or duress exerted by Axis Governments or their agencies during the war.\n\n4. (a) The Italian Government shall be responsible for the restoration to complete good order of the property returned to United Nations nationals under paragraph 1 of this Article. In cases where property cannot be returned or where, as a result of the war, a United Nations national has suffered a loss by reason of injury or damage to property in Italy, he shall receive from the Italian Government compensation in lire to the extent of two-thirds of the sum necessary, at the date of payment, to purchase similar property or to make good the loss suffered. In no event shall United Nations nationals receive less favourable treatment with respect to compensation than that accorded to Italian nationals.\n\n(b) United Nations nationals who hold, directly or indirectly, ownership interests in corporations or associations which are not United Nations nationals within the meaning of paragraph 9(a) of this Article, but which have suffered a loss by reason of injury or damage to property in Italy, shall receive compensation in accordance with sub-paragraph (a) above. This compensation shall be calculated on the basis of the total loss or damage suffered by the corporation or association and shall bear the same proportion to such loss or damage as the beneficial interests of such nationals in the corporation or association bear to the total capital thereof.\n\n(c) Compensation shall be paid free of any levies, taxes or other charges. It shall be freely usable in Italy but shall be subject to the foreign exchange control regulations which may be in force in Italy from time to time.\n\n(d) The Italian Government shall grant United Nations nationals an indemnity in lire at the same rate as provided in sub-paragraph (a) above to compensate them for the loss or damage due to special measures applied to their property during the war, and which were not applicable to Italian property. This sub-paragraph does not apply to a loss of profit.\n\n5. All reasonable expenses incurred in Italy in establishing claims, including the assessment of loss or damage, shall be borne by the Italian Government.\n\n6. United Nations nationals and their property shall be exempted from any exceptional taxes, levies or imposts imposed on their capital assets in Italy by the Italian Government or any Italian authority between 3 September 1943 and the coming into force of the present Treaty for the specific purpose of meeting charges arising out of the war or of meeting the costs of occupying forces or of reparation payable to any of the United Nations. Any sums which have been so paid shall be refunded.\n\n7. Notwithstanding the territorial transfers provided in the present Treaty, Italy shall continue to be responsible for loss or damage sustained during the war by property in ceded territory or in the Free Territory of Trieste belonging to United Nations nationals. The obligations contained in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Article shall also rest on the Italian Government in regard to property in ceded territory and in the Free Territory of Trieste of United Nations nationals except in so far as this would conflict with the provisions of paragraph 14 of Annex X and paragraph 14 of Annex XIV of the present Treaty.\n\n8. The owner of the property concerned and the Italian Government may agree upon arrangements in lieu of the provisions of this Article.\n\n9. As used in this Article:\n\n(a) \"United Nations nationals\"' means individuals who are nationals of any of the United Nations, or corporations or associations organised under the laws of any of the United Nations, at the coming into force of the present Treaty, provided that the said individuals, corporations or associations also had this status on 3 September 1943, the date of the Armistice with Italy.\n\nThe term \"United Nations nationals\" also includes all individuals, corporations or associations which, under the laws in force in Italy during the war, have been treated as enemy;\n\n(b) \"Owner\" means the United Nations national, as defined in sub-paragraph (a) above, who is entitled to the property in question, and includes a successor of the owner, provided that the successor is also a United Nations national as defined in sub-paragraph (a). If the successor has purchased the property in its damaged state, the transferor shall retain his rights to compensation under this Article, without prejudice to obligations between the transferor and the purchaser under domestic law;\n\n(c) \"Property\" means all movable or immovable property, whether tangible or intangible, including industrial, literary and artistic property, as well as all rights or interests of any kind in property. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions, the property of the United Nations and their nationals includes all seagoing and river vessels, together with their gear and equipment, which were either owned by United Nations or their nationals, or registered in the territory of one of the United Nations, or sailed under the flag of one of the United Nations and which, after 10 June 1940, while in Italian waters, or after they had been forcibly brought into Italian waters, either were placed under the control of the Italian authorities as enemy property or ceased to be at the free disposal in Italy of the United Nations or their nationals, as a result of measures of control taken by the Italian authorities in relation to the existence of a state of war between members of the United Nations and Germany.\n\nSECTION II\n\nITALIAN PROPERTY IN THE TERRITORY OF ALLIED AND ASSOCIATED POWERS\n\nArticle 79\n\n1. Each of the Allied and Associated Powers shall have the right to seize, retain, liquidate or take any other action with respect to all property, rights and interests which on the coming into force of the present Treaty are within its territory and belong to Italy or to Italian nationals, and to apply such property or the proceeds thereof to such purposes as it may desire, within the limits of its claims and those of its nationals against Italy or Italian nationals, including debts, other than claims fully satisfied under other Articles of the present Treaty. All Italian property, or the proceeds thereof, in excess of the amount of such claims, shall be returned.\n\n2. The liquidation and disposition of Italian property shall be carried out in accordance with the law of the Allied or Associated Power concerned. The Italian owner shall have no rights with respect to such property except those which may be given him by that law.\n\n3. The Italian Government undertakes to compensate Italian nationals whose property is taken under this Article and not returned to them.\n\n4. No obligation is created by this Article on any Allied or Associated Power to return industrial property to the Italian Government or Italian nationals, or to include such property in determining the amounts which may be retained under paragraph 1 of this Article. The Government of each of the Allied and Associated Powers shall have the right to impose such limitations, conditions and restrictions on rights or interests with respect to industrial property in the territory of that Allied or Associated Power, acquired prior to the coming into force of the present Treaty by the Government or nationals of Italy, as may be deemed by the Government of the Allied or Associated Power to be necessary in the national interest.\n\n5. (a) Italian submarine cables connecting points in Yugoslavia shall be deemed to be Italian property in Yugoslavia, despite the fact that lengths of these cables may lie outside the territorial waters of Yugoslavia.\n\n(b) Italian submarine cables connecting a point in the territory of an Allied or Associated Power with a point in Italian territory shall be deemed to be Italian property within the meaning of this Article so far as concerns the terminal facilities and the lengths of cables lying within territorial waters of that Allied or Associated Power.\n\n6. The property covered by paragraph 1 of this Article shall be deemed to include Italian property which has been subject to control by reason of a state of war existing between Italy and the Allied or Associated Power having jurisdiction over the property, but shall not include:\n\n(a) Property of the Italian Government used for consular or diplomatic purposes;\n\n(b) Property belonging to religious bodies or private charitable institutions and used exclusively for religious or charitable purposes;\n\n(c) Property of natural persons who are Italian nationals permitted to reside within the territory of the country in which the property is located or to reside elsewhere in United Nations territory, other than Italian property which at any time during the war was subjected to measures not generally applicable to the property of Italian nationals resident in the same territory;\n\n(d) Property rights arising since the resumption of trade and financial relations between the Allied and Associated Powers and Italy, or arising out of transactions between the Government of any Allied or Associated Power and Italy since 3 September 1943;\n\n(e) Literary and artistic property rights;\n\n(f) Property in ceded territories of Italian nationals, to which the provisions of Annex XIV shall apply;\n\n(g) With the exception of the assets indicated in Article 74, part A, paragraph 2(b) and part D, paragraph 1, property of natural persons residing in ceded territories or in the Free Territory of Trieste who do not opt for Italian nationality under the present Treaty, and property of corporations or associations having siège social in ceded territories or in the Free Territory of Trieste, provided that such corporations or associations are not owned or controlled by persons in Italy. In the cases provided under Article 74, part A, paragraph 2(b), and part D, paragraph 1, the question of compensation will be dealt with under Article 74, part E.\n\nSECTION III\n\nDECLARATION OF THE ALLIED AND ASSOCIATED POWERS IN RESPECT OF CLAIMS\n\nArticle 80\n\nThe Allied and Associated Powers declare that the rights attributed to them under Articles 74 and 79 of the present Treaty cover all their claims and those of their nationals for loss or damage due to acts of war, including measures due to the occupation of their territory, attributable to Italy and having occurred outside Italian territory, with the exception of claims based on Articles 75 and 78.\n\nSECTION IV\n\nDEBTS\n\nArticle 81\n\n1. The existence of the state of war shall not, in itself, be regarded as affecting the obligation to pay pecuniary debts arising out of obligations and contracts which existed, and rights which were acquired, before the existence of the state of war, which became payable prior to the coming into force of the present Treaty, and which are due by the Government or nationals of Italy to the Government or nationals of one of the Allied and Associated Powers or are due by the Government or nationals of one of the Allied and Associated Powers to the Government or nationals of Italy.\n\n2. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the present Treaty, nothing therein shall be construed as impairing debtor-creditor relationships arising out of pre-war contracts concluded either by the Government or nationals of Italy.\n\nPART VIII\n\nGENERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS\n\nArticle 82\n\n1. Pending the conclusion of commercial treaties or agreements between individual United Nations and Italy, the Italian Government shall, during a period of eighteen months from the coming into force of the present Treaty, grant the following treatment to each of the United Nations which, in fact, reciprocally grants similar treatment in like matters to Italy:\n\n(a) In all that concerns duties and charges on importation or exportation, the internal taxation of imported goods and all regulations pertaining thereto, the United Nations shall be granted unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment;\n\n(b) In all other respects, Italy shall make no arbitrary discrimination against goods originating in or destined for any territory of any of the United Nations as compared with like goods originating in or destined for territory of any other of the United Nations or of any other foreign country;\n\n(c) United Nations nationals, including juridical persons, shall be granted national and most-favoured-nation treatment in all matters pertaining to commerce, industry, shipping and other forms of business activity within Italy. These provisions shall not apply to commercial aviation;\n\n(d) Italy shall grant no exclusive or discriminatory right to any country with regard to the operation of commercial aircraft in international traffic, shall afford all the United Nations equality of opportunity in obtaining international commercial aviation rights in Italian territory, including the right to land for refueling and repair, and, with regard to the operation of commercial aircraft in international traffic, shall grant on a reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis to all United Nations the right to fly over Italian territory without landing. These provisions shall not affect the interests of the national defence of Italy.\n\n2. The foregoing undertakings by Italy shall be understood to be subject to the exceptions customarily included in commercial treaties concluded by Italy before the war; and the provisions with respect to reciprocity granted by each of the United Nations shall be understood to be subject to the exceptions customarily included in the commercial treaties concluded by that State.\n\nPART IX\n\nSETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES\n\nArticle 83\n\n1. Any disputes which may arise in giving effect to Articles 75 and 78 and Annexes XIV, XV, XVI and XVII, part B, of the present Treaty shall be referred to a Conciliation Commission consisting of one representative of the Government of the United Nation concerned and one representative of the Government of Italy, having equal status. If within three months after the dispute has been referred to the Conciliation Commission no agreement has been reached, either Government may ask for the addition to the Commission of a third member selected by mutual agreement of the two Governments from nationals of a third country. Should the two Governments fail to agree within two months on the selection of a third member of the Commission, the Governments shall apply to the Ambassadors in Rome of the Soviet Union, of the United Kingdom, of the United States of America, and of France, who will appoint the third member of the Commission. If the Ambassadors are unable to agree within a period of one month upon the appointment of the third member, the Secretary-General of the United Nations may be requested by either party to make the appointment.\n\n2. When any Conciliation Commission is established under paragraph 1 above, it shall have jurisdiction over all disputes which may thereafter arise between the United Nation concerned and Italy in the application or interpretation of Articles 75 and 78 and Annexes XIV, XV, XVI, and XVII, part B, of the present Treaty, and shall perform the functions attributed to it by those provisions.\n\n3. Each Conciliation Commission shall determine its own procedure, adopting rules conforming to justice and equity.\n\n4. Each Government shall pay the salary of the member of the Conciliation Commission whom it appoints and of any agent whom it may designate to represent it before the Commission. The salary of the third member shall be fixed by special agreement between the Governments concerned and this salary, together with the common expenses of each Commission, shall be paid in equal shares by the two Governments.\n\n5. The parties undertake that their authorities shall furnish directly to the Conciliation Commission all assistance which may be within their power.\n\n6. The decision of the majority of the members of the Commission shall be the decision of the Commission, and shall be accepted by the parties as definitive and binding.\n\nPART X\n\nMISCELLANEOUS ECONOMIC PROVISIONS\n\nArticle 84\n\nArticles 75, 78, 82 and Annex XVII of the present Treaty shall apply to the Allied and Associated Powers and to those of the United Nations which broke off diplomatic relations with Italy or with which Italy broke off diplomatic relations. These Articles and this Annex shall also apply to Albania and Norway.\n\nArticle 85\n\nThe provisions of Annexes VIII, X, XIV, XV, XVI and XVII shall, as in the case of the other Annexes, have force and effect as integral parts of the present Treaty.\n\nPART XI\n\nFINAL CLAUSES\n\nArticle 86\n\n1. For a period not to exceed eighteen months from the coming into force of the present Treaty, the Ambassadors in Rome of the Soviet Union, of the United Kingdom, of the United States of America, and of France, acting in concert, will represent the Allied and Associated Powers in dealing with the Italian Government in all matters concerning the execution and interpretation of the present Treaty.\n\n2. The Four Ambassadors will give the Italian Government such guidance, technical advice and clarification as may be necessary to ensure the rapid and efficient execution of the present Treaty both in letter and in spirit.\n\n3. The Italian Government shall afford to the said Four Ambassadors all necessary information and any assistance which they may require in the fulfilment of the tasks devolving on them under the present Treaty.\n\nArticle 87\n\n1. Except where another procedure is specifically provided under any Article of the present Treaty, any dispute concerning the interpretation or execution of the Treaty, which is not settled by direct diplomatic negotiations, shall be referred to the Four Ambassadors acting under Article 86 except that in this case the Ambassadors will not be restricted by the time limit provided in that Article. Any such dispute not resolved by them within a period of two months shall, unless the parties to the dispute mutually agree upon another means of settlement, be referred at the request of either party to the dispute to a Commission composed of one representative of each party and a third member selected by mutual agreement of the two parties from nationals of a third country. Should the two parties fail to agree within a period of one month upon the appointment of the third member, the Secretary-General of the United Nations may be requested by either party to make the appointment.\n\n2. The decision of the majority of the members of the Commission shall be the decision of the Commission, and shall be accepted by the parties as definitive and binding.\n\nArticle 88\n\n1. Any member of the United Nations, not a signatory to the present Treaty, which is at war with Italy, and Albania, may accede to the Treaty and upon accession shall be deemed to be an Associated Power for the purposes of the Treaty.\n\n2. Instruments of accession shall be deposited with the Government of the French Republic and shall take effect upon deposit.\n\nArticle 89\n\nThe provisions of the present Treaty shall not confer any rights or benefits on any State named in the Preamble as one of the Allied and Associated Powers or on its nationals until such State becomes a party to the Treaty by deposit of its instrument of ratification.\n\nArticle 90\n\nThe present Treaty, of which the French, English and Russian texts are authentic, shall be ratified by the Allied and Associated Powers.[18] It shall also be ratified by Italy.

Frontiers of Italy (Article 1).\n\nB. Franco-Italian Frontier (Article 2).\n\nC. Yugoslav-Italian Frontier (Article 3).\n\nD. Frontiers of the Free Territory of Trieste (Articles 4 and 22).\n\nE. Sea Areas defined in Article 11 of the present Treaty.\n\n[Maps not reproduced here - see UNTS 50.]\n\nANNEX II\n\nFRANCO-ITALIAN FRONTIER\n\nDetailed description of the sections of the frontier to which the modifications set out in Article 2 apply\n\nLITTLE SAINT BERNARD PASS\n\nReference: 1:20,000 map: Ste. Foy Tarentaise Nos. 1-2.\n\nThe new frontier follows a line which starts from the rocky ridge of Lancebranlette, then, descending towards the east, follows the line of the watershed to the 2,180 metre level, whence it passes to the Colonna Joux (2188). From there, still following the line of the watershed, it reascends on to Costa del Belvedere, the rocky outcrops of which it follows, climbs Mt. Belvedere, skirting its summit and leaving the latter in French territory 120 metres away from the frontier and, passing through points 2570, 2703, Bella Valletta and point 2746, it rejoins the old frontier at Mt. Valaisan.\n\nMONT CENIS PLATEAU\n\nReference: 1:20,000 map: Lanslebourg, Nos. 5-6 and 7-8 and of Mont D'Ambin, Nos. 1-2.\n\nThe new frontier follows a line which leaves the old frontier at Mt. Tour, follows westwards the administrative boundary shown on the map, follows the Vitoun as soon as it meets it on its northern branch and descends along it as far as Rocca della Torretta.\n\nThen following the line of rocky outcrops, it reaches the stream coming from the Alpe Lamet and descends with it as far as the base of the rocky escarpment along which it runs for about 800 metres as far as the thalweg at a point situated about 200 metres north of point 1805.\n\nThen it mounts to the top of the landslips which overlook Ferrera Cenisio about 300 metres away and, continuing westwards, meets the road which skirts the east of Rne. Paradiso 400 metres west of the loop (1854), leaving it immediately and bending southwards.\n\nIt cuts the Bar Cenisia road at a point about 100 metres southeast of Refuge 5, crosses the thalweg in the direction of Lago S. Giorgio, roughly follows contour 1900 as far as point 1907, then skirts the southern side of Lago d'Arpon and rejoins the rocky ridge on which it remains in a south-westerly direction as far as the confluence of the streams coming from the Bard glacier (Ghiacciaio di Bard) at a point approximately 1,400 metres southwest of Lago d'Arpon.\n\nFrom there, bending southwards, it roughly follows contour 2500, goes as far as point 2579, then, running along contour 2600, it reaches the Lago della Vecchia and rejoins, at the administrative boundary marked on the map about 700 metres southeast of the lake, the Pso. d'Avanza path, which it follows along the rocky escarpments to the old frontier, halfway between the Col della Vecchia and the Col de Clapier.\n\nMONT THABOR\n\nReference: 1:20,000 map: Nevache, 1-2, 5-6 and 7-8.\n\nFrom Cina de la Planette to Rocher de Guion (Cima del Sueur)\n\nThe new frontier follows a line which leaves the present frontier at Cima de la Planette and, proceeding southwards, follows the ridge through points 2980, 3178, Rca. Bernaude (3228), points 2842, 2780, 2877, Pso. della Gallina (2671), points 2720, 2806 and Pta. Quattro Sorelle (2700).\n\nDescending the eastern slope of this summit, the line leaves in French territory point 2420, whence it rejoins and follows on the east the path leading to the buildings situated about 200 metres from point 2253, this path and these buildings being left in French territory. It then enters a thalweg, passing about 300 metres northeast of point 1915, whence it reaches the northwestern edge of the reservoir which, in the Vallee Etroite (Valle Stretta) feeds the hydro-electric installations of Sette Fontane, leaving this reservoir and these installations in Italian territory. Skirting the reservoir on the south, it reaches the crossroads at point 1499.\n\nThence it follows the path which hugs the edge of the woods along contour 1500 and which leads it to Comba della Gorgia near the 1580 contour; then it ascends the thalweg towards point 1974 and joins the edge of the rocky escarpments of La Sueur as marked by points 2272, 2268, 2239, 2266, 2267, remaining on this edge until it meets the old frontier, the crest of the rocks and the path bordering it remaining in French territory.\n\nCHABERTON\n\nReference: 1:20,000 map: Briançon, Nos. 3-4.\n\nThe new frontier follows a line which leaves the old frontier at point 3042 (north of point 3070 and north of Pointe des Trois Scies) and follows the rocky ridge as far as Croce del Vallonetto.\n\nFrom the Croce del Vallonetto it bends towards the south along the rocky ridge and meets the Chaberton road at the point where the latter enters the cirque of the Clot des Morts.\n\nCrossing this road and the thalweg which borders it, the line roughly follows, for 1250 metres, contour 2300 which, on the ground, follows to the southeast a series of rocky outcrops and debris, then it cuts straight across the eastern slope of Mt. Chaberton, reaches a point about 400 metres west of point 2160 leaving in French territory the intermediate pylon of the cable railway which stands there.\n\nThen it proceeds in a straight line, across a series of rocky barriers and steep ravines, towards the position (not marked on the map) of La Fontaine des Chamois, near point 2228 (about 1400 metres northeast of Clavières) which it skirts to the east, following the second bend of the road joining this position with the fortified barracks of Chaberton, on the road from Cézanne (Cesana) to Clavières, leaving the fortifications at La Fontaine des Chamois in French territory.\n\nThence following first in a southerly direction the commune boundary marked on the map, and then the rocky barrier about 400 metres north of the Clavières-Cézanne (Cesana) road, it bends towards the southwest, passing along the foot of the rocky cliffs, sufficiently far from the latter to allow the construction of double-track road\n\nSkirting in this way to the north the village of Clavières, which is left in Italian territory, it meets the Rio Secco about 200 metres upstream from the Clavières bridge and follows down its course, then that of Doire Ripaire (Doria Riparia) as far as the road from Clavières to Val Gimont, which is left to Italy, and follows this road as far as the bridge over the Gimont.\n\nProceeding up the course of the latter for about 300 metres, the line then leaves it and follows the mule-track which takes it to the upper pylon of the Clavières cable railway (Col du Mont Fort du Boeuf), which is left in French territory.
