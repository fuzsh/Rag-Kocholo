        "text": "Italy had a new Premier last Week. Sandy-haired Giuseppe Pella, the Piedmontese peasant’s son (TIME, Aug. 24) who became Italy’s firm-money Finance Minister after the war, did what his old boss, Alcide de Gasperi, was unable to do. He got the benevolent neutrality of Sara-gat’s Socialists on the left and the monarchists’ votes on the right, and thus won for his government a vote of confidence in the Senate and a surprising 100-vote majority in the Lower House. Pella insisted that his ambitions were modest: to run a quiet caretaker government until the budget was passed.\n\nBut events refused to stay quiet. The Yugoslav news agency announced that, because of “the unconstructive attitude of Rome,” Tito’s government was in a mood to do something about Trieste. This might mean that Tito plans to annex the Yugoslav-occupied Zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste, in which Italy has staked out sizable claims.\n\nPella canceled plans for a vacation, summoned the diplomatic representatives of the U.S., Britain and France to tell them that Italy would not “stand idly by.” Next, Pella, who is his own Foreign Minister, fired off a note to Belgrade warning against any “ill-considered and irresponsible act.” Italy alerted all its troops on the Yugoslav frontier and canceled all furloughs. Yugoslavia announced nervously that it really has no mischievous designs on Trieste."
