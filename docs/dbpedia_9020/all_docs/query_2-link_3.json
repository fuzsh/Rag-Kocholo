        "text": "Free Territory of Trieste, former region, western Istria, southern Europe, surrounding and including the city of Trieste. It was occupied by Yugoslavia in 1945. The United Nations established it as a free territory in 1947. It was divided for administrative purposes into two zones: Zone A in the north, including the city, was under the British and Americans; Zone B in the south was under the Yugoslavs. In 1954 most of the northern zone was incorporated into Italy; the southern zone went to Yugoslavia. Independence activists have argued that the 1954 incorporation was illegal and that the region is still de jure a free territory."
