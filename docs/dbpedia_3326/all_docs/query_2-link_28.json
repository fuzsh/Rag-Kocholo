PROTEST from parents began a number of years ago when they ob jected to experimental teaching pro- grams which included personal ques- tionnaires about a student’s home life and his racial and sexual attitudes The reasoning behind the district’s decision is spelled out in their, policy statement. “Records constitute one of the tools by which the school system seeks to guide its educational programs in the best interest of pupils and their fami- lies. Public school records represent the major local source of information regarding the majority of the families of the community.” v The report also makes clear only school personnel, parents or students should have access to student’s per- manent record without either a sub- poena or the written permission of the parents or legal guardian or the stu- dent. if an adult, to release informa tion contained in the student's per- manent record.

Gifted students get new challenge By STEVE BARNABY WESTLAND - The gifted children program in the Wayne-Westland School District is being expanded be- cause* of successful pilot programs in- stituted in the summer of 1972. accord ing to district administrators Beginning in January 1975. the dis- trict will divide the gifted program into two five-week sessions, allowing the children to further develop their educational interests. Tentatively, the program will include approximately two per cent of the student popu- lation Those participating are stu- dents with I’Qs of more than 130. “Students -must be presented with learning alternatives or episodes which are significantly different Crom what is presented in general educa- tion taking place during the week.” says district administrator Ray Raf- ford. “The discoverv method of teaching should be one of the primary teaching strategies.” THE FIRST FIVE weeks would be a general session at designated ele- mentary centers. At the end of the ses- sion. each child would select one spe cific area on which to concentrate for the next five-week session. The introductory sessions will be conducted in fiVe elementary budd- ings: Tinkham.' Monroe, pdison. Schweitzer and Stottlemyer Students from Kettering will be absorbed by the other centers. I The second two weeks will be spent at Marshall and use resources from the high schools for the older stu- dents Two or three of the elementary centers will be used for the younger students, dependiqgon the number of children involved . Courses to be emphasized are lan- guage arts, science and math. Types of activities being considered for the older children are botany, biology, electronics, photography, ceramics, advanced math, tetevision.production. poetry and drama. For younger children areas like bot any. .biology, astronomy, commu- nications. lari and animal life will be included “The final selection would depend on the interests of the children partici- pating in the program.\" says Rafford Previously. Sessions for gifted chil- dren were conducted on Saturdays, but students, parents and staff felt such sessions were too inhibiting to hobbies, family activities and social activities. Because of this, the coming program will be conducted after school. \"The straight 16 weeks on Satur- days in the past has proven tiring for stiic^ents ana staff. Also, it left half of the school year with no program. This plan gives -some time off and also covers most of the school year.\" says Rafford. . ■* An advantage of the new program will be the daily contact the students are abl ? to maintain at the centers. “In order to best duplicate the sum- mer program, we felt that the school year program should be scheduled two days -a week after the regular school Jay. The student would be able to spec ialize in two areas, one during the first session, in January and Feb ruary. and the other during the third, session.

It's his infectious enthusiasm that drew more than 40 people with rfietal detectors to the East Middle School athletic grounds in the pouring rain to hunt for buried treasure. . 1 * The' hunt, which took place Sunday. Nov 3. was for coins and tokejis bur- ied by Temple and several other m em_ bers of the local treasure hunting club. Temple had gone out Saturday night preceding .the hunt t and buried 1.500 coins worth more than $60 Fifteen tokeas were also planted. They were redeemable at local businesses for pen and pencil sets, deluxe ham'*- burgers, and cases <>f pop that were donated by Plymouth merchants, ny of the objects, whith included and other metal artifacts, were planted by Temple. \"Over one ! rd of the stuff we found I didn’t . jn bury,\" grinned Temple, you see I knew that <the athletic grounds have been used several tidies as a carnival site.\" THE CLUB, still in its infancy, (and as ye} unnamed), is drawing more and more people to each meeting. Tho 40 people at Sundays’ outing was per- fect testimony to that fact. However.- it is Temple’s fever (which borders on fanaticism) that has brought all the treasure hunting aficionados together. •\"1 hop|e we get people from even •- where and every walk of life in mix club— the more the merrier as t'atf as* 1 am concerned/' he explained Temple sees the club as more thpn a hobby, however. \"We are teaching., people how to dig for lyUfacts without- leaving gaping holes or disturbing the. landscape. I [hope in the Tl.it uro to offer Qur services to state and civic or gamzations that need help in locating lo6t ‘Objects of value.\" he said He referred to an .incident in St , Clair shores where treasure hunters with metal detectors had helped to . find property that had been stolen , from a church and then buried by the thieve}. Temple pointed out that the recent * hunt at the scpool grounds also sefved * a <pivif purpose.

THIS COMPROMISE was offered when it was figured that having 'each district name a member to the board would not provide equal representa- tion because of the population factor. For instance, the Clarenceville rep- resentative would be speaking for far few^r residents than the Livonia or Plymouth trustee. By the same token, it was pointed outVi the study session, that using the potential population as a factor.

More than that, the population explo- sion in the Plymouth School District, would eventually have the same re- sult. • Under either of these plans there would be an imbalance So. for that reason the compromise modified resi- dency requirement was offered on the pretext it would have the best chance of being approved by the legislature.

This, however, was pared by the full board to $17,500. month. Under per diem payments, commissioners would get paid for eight meetings per month. “Yet. we Always had a quorum on my com- mittee for the tour meetings which weren’t covered by per diem pay- ments.\" Manning saic) the per diem policy tended to be abused. At one tirhe the county had 29 standing committees, explained Manning, but then reorgan- ized to four standing committees with six 'members each Each committee meeti on specified days of the week so the public can attend and provide input to commissioners. “There has developed a practice re- cently of some commissioners setting up subcommittees 4- even a one-man subcommittee — which were meeting on odd days without a chance for input from the public. We soon reached the stage of having 35^-40 spe- cial subcommittees;’’ Manning added that hiost commis- sioners will do their committee work with the flat salary arrangement be- cause most are dedicated enough to do their homework. . the coun- ty clerk and sheriff were increased $2,515 tp $32,000, and the prosecuting attorney was hiked by $2,324 to a new salary lof $40,000. > This Sunda Butourcas our doors will be open registers will be closed This Sunday you can see the dozens of beautifully decorated rooms in our Ethan Allen Gallery.

Shouldn’t come under cost of living officials. Manning pointed out that the blue ribbon committee approach was used six years ago and 'was a “fiasco\" be- cause the blue ribbon members reco.m- mend salaries “which were much too high.\" Manning said he voted yes on the final proposal because it was a com promise package. He did vote against several variations of pay raises, in- cluding the general government com- mittee recommendation to raise cir- cuit judges salaries to $45,000. “This is more than state supreme justices and the governor earn.\" Manning com- mented.

Voting against the budget were Com- missioners Mary Dumas (R-Livonia) and F’aul Silver 1 1) -Detroit 1 , who charged the budget was not fiscally sound. County departments had requested $126 million more than the auditors had recommended Board of of Auditors, two commission- ers' committees and the full board of commissioners approved most hospi- tal administrative decisions, a process that normally took two months. THE BUDGET leaves the future of Sheriff's township patrols up in the air. pending a court decision on the county's obligation to finance the serv- ice. The law suit, started by seven town- ships in Wayne County, asks that the county be declared legally responsible for funding qownship patrols. Circuit Judge Thomas Foley has scheduled a Nov 15 hearing. v Partial funding of $350,000 for town- ship patrols was put in a special proj- ects account in the Sheriff’s Depart- ment budget. That means another vote will be required to continue the patrol service beyound the end of the fiscal year on ’ Nov. 30. In each of the last two years, the board of commissioners budgeted the township patrols for nine months With townships bearing part of the cpst, but later extended funding for the full year UNDER THE budget, county depart- ments must collectively save $6 mil- lion by not filling vacant jobs until they have achieved their portion of the saving. i Departments must apply to a spe- cial commissioners’ committee for permission to fill vacant jobs Included in the budget is a $50 mil- lion lump sum for Wayne Cpunty Gen- eral Hospital, designed to improve the Hospital's operations. Tne new lump sum budgeting ap- proach gives the hospital adminis- tration board descretion to use its funds within the $50 million limit. Under the old approach.
