        "text": "Georgia is an American academic who's lost her teaching job in Athens. She's taken a job as a tour guide, but she hates it and it shows: the tourists, mostly American, are bored with history and facts; they want to shop. Every group has a goofy couple, a frat boy, a sullen teen, a feuding couple, divorcées looking for a mate, and a funny guy. This group is no exception, plus there's no air conditioning and a bearded silent driver. Thanks to an unlikely friendship, plus daisies, an ice-cream cone, the history of syrup, and the Oracle at Delphi, Georgia may have a shot at finding her kefi during this four-day tour.—<jhailey@hotmail.com>\n\nGeorgia is so fascinated with Greek history and culture that she would study it and become a teacher in Greece. But when she loses her job, and waits to see if she gets another teaching position, she gets a job as a tour guide. But she wants to teach the tourists about Greek history and culture which bores them when they only want to have fun. And they give bad reviews. So her boss always saddles her with the difficult tourists. She considers quitting which her boss wants. But one of the members of her group, tries to get her to loosen up.—rcs0411@yahoo.com"
