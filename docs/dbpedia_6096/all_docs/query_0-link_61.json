        "text": "As I get older, I have many people around me that have started to deal with more health issues. As I see their kids getting older, I have had numerous conversations with them about their future and what they plan to leave behind. For many of them, they think about ways to set up life insurance for their family and most of the dads that I talk to are looking for life insurance with no medical exam.\n\nAs I thought about this myself, when my kids were young, I made the choice to make sure that I had life insurance that would safeguard my family. It was important to do this while I was young when I could get a good rate when I was healthy which would last for many years to come.\n\nAt the time, when I was getting life insurance I had to prove myself through a medical exam, but these days there are other options as well including ones that do not require the exam, so there is no reason to not consider this.\n\nOn top of this, the financial amount you have to invest can be very low for some return that will help to safeguard your family into the future.\n\nThere are many tips that I would give to others when it comes to helping dads think about life insurance and their future, but the biggest piece of advice would be to make sure that you do it as soon as you can while your kids are young.\n\nOutside of this, while you may not want to think about it, thinking about the future and your possible death is important. While life insurance is one thing to consider there are other things to consider as well.\n\nIn the end, as a father, I know that I, for one, want to provide for my family and part of this is making sure that no matter what, that they are taken care of if and when I am gone.\n\nI highly encourage every dad to take the steps to start thinking about the future now, and don’t wait until it is too late!\n\nWhovians everywhere are brimming with excitement as today marks Doctor Who’s diamond anniversary, with three special episodes seeing the return of David Tennant as the Doctor airing weekly from Saturday the 25th of November.\n\nSince first airing back in 1963, Doctor Who has seen various actors play the character of the Doctor, with a brand new incarnation played by Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa gracing our screens next year.\n\nBut with 60 years of history under its belt, the ‘Whoniverse’ is very large and can be very complicated for new viewers to comprehend.\n\nIn an attempt to clear up some confusion for new viewers, the team at OLBG have found the most frequently Googled Doctor Who-related questions and answered them.\n\n1. How many Doctor Who episodes are there? – 13k monthly searches\n\nIf you want to watch all of Doctor Who, good luck. 871 episodes have aired so far, with three more being included after the 60th. If you want to watch it all though, it is impossible. This isn’t because of time constraints, however.\n\nDespite how long it would take to watch the entire show’s history, there are various episodes from the 1960s that no longer exist. The BBC wiped the original tapes they didn’t think were valuable to free up physical storage, once upon a time. This included many episodes of Doctor Who, with only the audio still existing.\n\nBut fear not, many have been reconstructed using animation, but not all of them just yet. Lost episodes have been discovered around the world in the past though, so maybe one day we might have a full catalogue again, but sadly it’s very unlikely.\n\n2. How many people have played the Doctor? – 4k monthly searches\n\nIn total, 15 actors in total have played the Doctor in the TV series, with the upcoming Ncuti Gatwa being the 16th. 13 actors have played the main part, having their own respective series and eras of the show. John Hurt and Jo Martin have played special guest Doctors in the series.\n\nFunnily enough, David Tennant isn’t playing his original incarnation in the 60th-anniversary specials and is in fact playing an entirely new Doctor. This is the third incarnation played by Tennant if you count his meta-crisis human incarnation.\n\n3. Where is the Doctor from? – 4k monthly searches\n\nThe character of the Doctor comes from a fictional planet called Gallifrey, an orange planet with red skies and huge cities covered in giant glass domes.\n\nIt is home to the Time Lords, a race that invented the concept of time travel using TARDIS’, a time machine. The Doctor’s planet was destroyed in a deadly time war, that saw the Time Lords at war with the deadly Daleks.\n\n4. Who played the first-ever Doctor? – 3k monthly searches\n\nWhen The Doctor’s adventures began in 1963, the first actor to play the character was William Hartnell. Mostly well-known as a theatre actor, he played the character for three years and stepped down from the role in 1966 due to ill health.\n\nHartnell’s leaving led to the concept of regeneration, where the character can change his appearance upon death. Therefore, Patrick Troughton became the second Doctor in 1966.\n\n5. What are the Daleks based on? -1k monthly searches\n\nThe Daleks are the Doctor’s greatest enemy and are purely evil creatures inside a suit of armour that turns them into ruthless killing machines. In fiction, the Daleks were created by Davros, who wanted to invent the most evil killing machines to take over the universe.\n\nIn reality, the Daleks were created by Terry Nation, who wrote the second-ever Doctor Who story titled The Dead Planet.\n\n6. What does TARDIS mean? – 500 monthly searches\n\nThe TARDIS refers to the Doctor’s time machine, a blue 1960s police telephone box which is bigger on the inside, and the Doctor’s ship to travel across time and space.\n\nThe word ‘TARDIS’ is an acronym for ‘Time And Relative Dimensions In Space’, which refers to the box travelling through time and space and the relative dimensions of the box being bigger on the inside.\n\nHave you always dreamt of starting your own music studio? If so then now is the time to turn that dream into a reality. If you follow this guide, you should find it easier than ever to launch your own business, so you can finally take your creative interests to that next level.\n\nUnderstand the Market\n\nThe first thing you need to do is understand the market. Musicians and artists have a reduced income and budget, so you need to pinpoint what you can do to cater to this market. Do you want to serve local bands who are saving up to record their album? Or do you want to service more seasoned professionals who have a bigger budget? The market that you target will probably come down to how experienced you are and how much space you have. At the end of the day, making your services more affordable will help you to increase the number of interested artists you have, and it also allows people to showcase their potential. This will all reflect positively, so make sure you keep that in mind.\n\nSource: Pexels (CC0 License)\n\nIt’s All About Location\n\nA lot of industries are becoming more digital as time goes on, and the entertainment industry is no different. A lot of entrepreneurs start a recording studio right out of their home or garage as it helps them to keep the costs down. That being said, you do need to understand how to boost visibility, and how to get the right talent. Don’t forget that you can usually find exceptional deals on real estate if you know where to look. Consider the ROI before you go ahead and pay for a location, or before you turn one down. It is easier for you to see the bigger picture when you do things like this.\n\nKnow your Costs\n\nIf you have decided to open up a recording studio then you probably have years of experience when it comes to music and entertainment. This is great, but at the same time, you have to remember that it;’s not cheap to start your own studio. You need to understand what’s important and what isn’t. Some factors can influence an artist’s sound, for example. There are also factors that can influence their performance. Investing in high-end gear will help you a lot and it should be a priority for your business. If you are starting out then make sure that you are using your budget wisely. Want some help, check out ATS Acoustics for all of the equipment you need as well as getting professional advice you can count on.\n\nIt’s Never a One-Man Band\n\nOpening a recording studio is probably one of the best experiences you will have in your life. With that in mind, you need to make sure that you have an expert in marketing working by your side. And yes, you can always just do your free taxes online, but there are financial experts in abundance who can make light work of that. Beyond that, you also need to have a studio designer or someone who understands the ins and outs of recruiting potential talent. If you don’t, then you may not have the right team to push your company forward. Even if you are not eager to share the profits, remember that this is crucial if you want to get the best possible return.\n\nDiversify your Income\n\nOf course, the main aim of your business should be to give artists the chance to get their music out there and to work towards a successful career. Regardless of where you are, you will probably have competition. You’ll also have a very limited target market. It can be positive for to have a limited target audience. Unfortunately, it can also reduce your income potential. One way for you to work around this would be for you to enlarge your market, and give yourself a bit of a diversified scope. Some great ideas to ensure that your company stays competitive would be for you to be open to podcasts. You also need to look into voice acting and see if you can support people who are interested in recording this kind of audio. If you can do this you will soon find that you can branch beyond marketing while making sure that you always get the result you need out of your business opportunity. Want to diversify your income? It gives you the opportunity to push the boat out while reducing your business risk. Things like this can be major if you want to take your company to the next level, so be mindful of that if you can.\n\nDisney and Pixar just debuted the first look at the highly anticipated Inside Out 2, and excitement over the new film was felt everywhere.\n\nThe first look at the sequel to the 2015 blockbuster was the biggest animated trailer launch in Disney history. The trailer—which brings viewers back into the mind of the now teenage Riley as her emotions try to keep up with her new feelings—garnered 157 million views in 24 hours. The previous record holder was 2019’s Frozen 2.\n\n“We are thrilled so many people have tuned in to check out the new trailer for Inside Out 2,” said Pete Docter, Chief Creative Officer of Pixar. “When the first film came out, we knew that by telling a story where we could see our emotions—those little voices inside your head—there would be so much more to explore than we could possibly fit into one film.”\n\nDocter added that director Kelsey Mann and team “have done such a great job with Inside Out 2, expanding the world and introducing new emotions that we’re very anxious for audiences to discover.”\n\n“We couldn’t be more grateful to see the kind of response the trailer has received so far,” he said. “Thank you to all who have checked it out — we can’t wait for everyone to see the film when it comes to theaters next summer.”\n\nThe film was especially a big hit on TikTok bringing in 78 million views on the social media platform in the past day. Disney announced a first-of-its-kind content hub with TikTok last month to celebrate Disney’s 100th anniversary.\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the reasons that Inside Out 2 was so popular was due to the introduction of the brand-new emotion, Anxiety.\n\nThe frazzled, but lovable orange emotion—who is voiced by Maya Hawke—will join Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust.\n\nDisney and Pixar’s Inside Out 2 releases exclusively in theaters on June 14, 2024.\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/pixar/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PixarInsideOut\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pixarinsideout/\n\nX: https://twitter.com/PixarInsideOut\n\nHashtag: #InsideOut2\n\nWe’re all stars! That’s the message behind Walt Disney Animation Studios and Disney Music Group’s latest song release, “I’m A Star,” performed by the talented cast of “Wish.” Now available on SiriusXM’s Disney Hits Channel 133, YouTube, Amazon Music, Spotify, Apple Music an d all digital service providers, “I’m A Star” is the fourth of five songs being revealed as part of the weekly “Wish Wednesdays” music campaign ahead of the film’s launch in U.S. theaters on November 22. All seven songs in the film were penned by Grammy®-nominated singer/songwriter Julia Michaels and Grammy®-winning producer/songwriter/musician Benjamin Rice.\n\n“I’m A Star” features 22 individual soloists who voice a host of forest animals and plant life that come to life and serenade Asha. “We wanted to have a song that represents what Star is all about,” said director Fawn Veerasunthorn. “Asha has so many questions about Star—primarily, ‘Why me?’ Star is there to remind Asha she has the power to pursue her dreams. And she’s not alone. The song—the movie—is about connection with others.”\n\nSaid Michaels, “Asha learns that everything is made of stardust. It is so fun and beautiful and always brings a little tear to my eye when I watch it.”\n\nAdded Rice, “The song is fun and deeply meaningful—through the power of Star’s stardust, all of nature comes to life and explains to Asha that we are all made of the same stuff. We are ALL stars! This song is also one of my personal favorites due to its message and the emotions and truth that it strikes in us all.”\n\n“There’s a long tradition of singing animals in our animated musicals,” said director Chris Buck. “Baloo sings ‘The Bare Necessities’ with Mowgli, and Sebastian is backed up by all kinds of fish in ‘Under the Sea.’ But we were perhaps most deeply inspired by Snow White and Aurora and those beautiful moments when they sing to the forest creatures—you’ll see some clear references in the animation of ‘I’m A Star.’”\n\nThe Wish Original Motion Picture Soundtrack from Walt Disney Records will be available November 17 on all streaming platforms. Fans can pre-order the CD here and the vinyl here. “This Wish” 10” Star Die-Cut Picture Disc can be preordered here and will be available December 1, exclusively at Disney Music Emporium.\n\nAbout the Movie\n\nThe Portokalos family is back for another serving of ouzo and opa” (Tori Brazier, METRO) in MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING 3, available on Digital, Blu-rayTM and DVD October 31, 2023, from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.

It was great to have this movie set in Greece so you could see the family in an environment that you know they would love. You get to live vicariously through the family as they experience the mother country for themselves. The plot was fun and it was a great family movie for the whole family!\n\nGIVEAWAY\n\nBecoming a parent is a huge milestone and the beginning of a beautiful and rewarding adventure. Being one will teach you more about yourself, challenge you in different ways, and help you find a purpose. Since it does not come with a guide, being a new parent can feel like navigating a maze where you feel you do not know what you are doing a lot of the time. Every parent feels this way, so we have put together some tips from those who have been where you are to help make things easier and help you embrace your new role.\n\nDo Not Compare Yourself to Others\n\nWe are firmly in the age of social media, where it seems like every parent is posting about their baby to their profiles. Since they want to ensure everything looks perfect, these parents often take the best pictures and post about the best moments.\n\nYou might see all these curated moments and think you are not doing things right. Many people do not realise that these parents often don’t post about whatever else is going on, including the challenges they may be facing.\n\nAlso, it is important to remember that every baby is different and hits milestones at different times. If you constantly compare your baby’s milestones against another’s, you may end up worrying too much and might not give them the love and attention they deserve. You will also rob yourself of the opportunity to experience these milestones with them and the joy that comes from doing so.\n\nGet Support\n\nEvery new parent needs support. In the beginning, things can be very hectic with your child requiring constant attention or crying through the night. It can be overwhelming dealing with everything you have to do in addition to trying to keep your life in order. Instead of struggling through this, you should ask for some help.\n\nYou can find support from your friends and family who can help watch the baby, tidy up the house, or let you take a break.\n\nSupport is also important for foster careers caring for their first child. Because they recognize its importance, fostering agencies in Fife ensure their careers receive the support they require, whether that is through additional training, support groups or staying in touch with other careers.\n\nAdditionally, they provide respite care where another career steps in to allow you to take a break and recharge.\n\nBe Patient\n\nIn the beginning, it will seem like your life revolves around the baby. You will be expected to do a lot for them, sometimes with little to no sleep. Many parents fall into the trap of not seeing an end in sight and thinking things will stay like this forever.\n\nThat is not true because things will change in a few months. Their routines will change, and their needs will decrease. They will start crawling soon, and you will find yourself chasing them around the house in no time. Be patient and enjoy the different stages as they come.\n\nFeeling lost and overwhelmed when a baby or child arrives in your home is OK. Every new parent feels the same, but they have found ways to deal with everything those first few days, weeks, or months entail. Learning from other parents, who have been where you are. is a great way to learn how be a great parent and give your child the love and care they need."
