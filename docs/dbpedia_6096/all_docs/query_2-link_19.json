They're on the Peloponnese peninsula, where they spend their evening together, watching the sun set the sky ablaze in orange before it dips into the dusky sea.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nBoy on a Dolphin, 1957\n\nJean Negulesco\n\nThis was the first Hollywood film shot in Greece, and Italian actress Sophia Loren’s English-language debut as a dazzling sponge diver. Loren discovers a sunken ship off the coast of the Aegean Sea filled with priceless treasures, including an ancient gold statue of a boy on a dolphin. Archaeologist Alan Ladd and antiques dealer Clifton Webb vie for both her attention and the artifact. All this is set against the backdrop of the mystical island of Hydra.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nEternity and a Day, 1998\n\nTheo Angelopoulos\n\nNever on Sunday, 1960\n\nJules Dassin\n\nIn this romantic comedy, Ilya is a free-spirited Greek prostitute living in the port of Piraeus. She’s out on the town—downing ooza and dancing the Sirtaki with a different gentleman friend—every day except for, as the title suggests, Sunday. Its star, Melina Mercouri, won best actress for playing Ilya at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nTo watch, click here.\n\nPhaedra, 1962\n\nJules Dassin\n\nPhaedra (Melina Mercouri), the wife of a shipping tycoon, wants for nothing—except for her husband’s son (Anthony Perkins) from his first marriage, who she instantly falls in love with. The two begin an affair, which has devastating results. It’s a bit of a Greek tragedy but there are magnificent moments of island life (Hydra) along the way.\n\nTo watch, click here."
