But apparently, not everybody defines their existence by the number of Evil Dead DVD re-releases they can fit on a shelf, so there are actually a few non-horror titles being released this month. Here are some of the more popular home video releases for the week of October 5th, according to Amazon.com.\n\nMy Life in Ruins\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nDVD Round-Up - Week of October 5: My Life in Ruins, Year One, Trick 'r' Treat, Anvil: The Story of Anvil Back to video\n\nApparently, Nia Vardalos has spent the years since My Big Fat Greek Wedding not honing her craft, but rather practicing her ethnic stereotyping. Thatâ€™s the only explanation I can think of for My Life In Ruins, in which she plays a tour guide showing boorish tourists how to make fun of Greece.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

Instead, it turns out the two styles of humour cancel each other out, leaving an uncomfortable vacuum where the laughter should go.\n\nTrick â€˜râ€™ Treat\n\nOne of the side effects of constantly watching movies is that my attention span can now only be measured in quantum terms. That makes me extra appreciative of anthology films like Trick â€˜râ€™ Treat, which brings together four short, Halloween-themed horror stories.\n\nAnvil: The Story of Anvil\n\nImagine if Spinal Tap were real, Canadian and good. Wait, thatâ€™s 3 Inches of Blood. Okay, then letâ€™s pretend Dio never made it out of the gate, and then youâ€™ve got Canadian heavy metal band Anvil, the subject of this popular documentary.\n\nHereâ€™s the trailer for Anvil: The Story of Anvil:\n\nhttp://www.traileraddict.com/emd/9353\n\nâ€“ Al Kratina\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
