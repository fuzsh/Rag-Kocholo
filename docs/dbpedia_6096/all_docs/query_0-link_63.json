Contours of White Ethnicity: Popular Ethnography and the Making of Usable Pasts in Greek America. Athens: Ohio University Press, 2009.\n\nThis book “explores the construction of ethnic history and reveals how and why white ethnics selectively retain, rework, or reject their pasts. Challenging the tendency to portray Americans of European background as a uniform cultural category, the author demonstrates how a generalized view of American white ethnics misses the specific identity issues of particular groups as well as their internal differences. Interdisciplinary in scope, Contours of White Ethnicity uses the example of Greek America to illustrate how the immigrant past can be used to combat racism and be used to bring about solidarity between white ethnics and racial minorities. Illuminating the importance of the past in the construction of ethnic identities today, Anagnostou presents the politics of evoking the past to create community, affirm identity, and nourish reconnection with ancestral roots, then identifies the struggles to neutralize oppressive pasts. Although it draws from the scholarship on a specific ethnic group, Contours of White Ethnicity exhibits a sophisticated, interdisciplinary methodology, which makes it of particular interest to scholars researching ethnicity and race in the United States and for those charting the directions of future research for white ethnicities.”\n\nAnagnostou, Yiorgos. “Against Cultural Loss: Immigration, Life History, and the Enduring Vernacular.” Hellenisms: Culture, Identity, and Ethnicity from Antiquity to Modernity.

As with the first three case studies, the life story of one Yorgos Mandas poses questions regarding the relationship between “History” and 'istories' (personal travails), between heady metanarratives and the kind of microhistories that seek legitimacy as pasts worth remembering. In this case the voice does not seek association with larger (national) historical narratives? Mandas says little about his personal experiences as a soldier during the Balkan Wars, for example, or to buttress the familiar 'rags to riches' line of most emigrant stories. Rather, his is a didactic study of endeavor and failure, a struggle that speaks for a vast constituency without history.”\n\nPetridou, Elia. “The Taste of Home,” in Home Possessions: Material Culture behind Closed Doors, ed.

Vol. 15, Issue 1 (2006): 61-88.\n\nAbstract: “An early colonial model of creolization asked whether migrants to the New World underwent such drastic denaturing as to no longer be considered trustworthy compatriots. Homelands and their overseas colonies actively debated the moral meaning of change. In this essay, this structural model of creolization is applied to understand the relationship between the Greek state and its diaspora in the United States. That relationship has been governed by the ethno-nationalist concept of Omogeneia, which means “of the same genos or ancestry” but also “homogeneity.” In the twentieth century, Omogeneia referred mainly to ethnic Greeks born and raised abroad and not possessing Greek citizenship. The idea of ethnic homogeneity became increasingly hard to sustain as Greek-Americans lost linguistic and cultural competence. The structural model of creolization guides the exploration of Greek homeland-diaspora negotiations of cultural and linguistic change in the American case. Greek-Americans are both ethnic Americans and diaspora Greeks at the same time. Although hybridity and creolization have been held up in postcolonial studies (e.g., Homi Bhabha) as productive of creative political agency, this study reveals a troubled dimension of creolization in the Greek diaspora. Omogeneia has implicitly become an othering term for those who are not linguistically and culturally competent according to homeland models and standards. A word that initially extended a welcome to ethnic Greeks left behind in Ottoman lands at independence in 1832 is now crumbling under the weight of its own contradictions.”\n\nSutton, David E. Remembrance of Repasts: An Anthropology of Food and Memory. Oxford: Berg, 2001.\n\nThis book offers a theoretical account of the interrelationship of culture, food and memory. Sutton challenges and expands anthropology's current focus on issues of embodiment, memory and material culture, especially in relation to transnational migration and the flow of culture across borders and boundaries. The Greek island of Kalymnos in the eastern Aegean, where Islanders claim to remember meals long past -- both humble and spectacular ñ provides the main setting for these issues, as well as comparative materials drawn from England and the United States. Despite the growing interest in anthropological accounts of food and in the cultural construction of memory, the intersection of food with memory has not been accorded sustained examination. Cultural practices of feasting and fasting, global flows of food as both gifts and commodities, the rise of processed food and the relationship of orally transmitted recipes to the vast market in specialty cookbooks tie traditional anthropological mainstays such as ritual, exchange and death to more current concerns with structure and history, cognition and the 'anthropology of the senses'. Arguing for the crucial role of a simultaneous consideration of food and memory, this book significantly advances our understanding of cultural processes and reformulates current theoretical preoccupations.\n\nSutton, David E. Secrets from the Greek Kitchen: Cooking, Skill, and Everyday Life on an Aegean Island. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2014.\n\nSecrets from the Greek Kitchen explores how cooking skills, practices, and knowledge on the island of Kalymnos are reinforced or transformed by contemporary events. Based on more than twenty years of research and the author’s videos of everyday cooking techniques, this rich ethnography treats the kitchen as an environment in which people pursue tasks, display expertise, and confront culturally defined risks. Kalymnian islanders, both women and men, use food as a way of evoking personal and collective memory, creating an elaborate discourse on ingredients, tastes, and recipes. Author David E. Sutton focuses on micropractices in the kitchen, such as the cutting of onions, the use of a can opener, and the rolling of phyllo dough, along with cultural changes, such as the rise of televised cooking shows, to reveal new perspectives on the anthropology of everyday living.\n\nTeske, Robert T. “The Eikonostasi Among Greek-Philadelphians,” Pennsylvania Folklife 23:1 (Autumn 1973): 20-30.\n\nTeske, Robert T.

Sustained by Eating, Consumed by Eating Right: Reflections, Rhymes, Rants and Recipes. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2013.\n\nWhen Eric L. Ball returned to his hometown in northern New York after a fifteen-year absence that included time in Greece, he began building his version of the good life, largely revolving around growing, foraging, and cooking safe and wholesome foods. Yet, surrounded by family and old memories, he found himself grappling with the loss of his unlikely Mediterranean past and struggling to navigate the interplay of intellectual convictions and emotional needs as he strived to construct a fulfilling ethical life in the unsustainable modern world. In Sustained by Eating, Consumed by Eating Right, Ball shares his experiences and explores questions about food and drink, including the relationship between recipes and learning, the significance of the Mediterranean diet, how to cook authentic Greek foods in the United States, and how to obtain safe and healthy food in a toxic world. Ultimately, Ball considers broader questions about the evolving significance of family, the nature of freedom, the future of the environment, and thinking that one can change the world. The result is a bittersweet story that ponders questions about living a decent and fulfilling life when it comes to food and family.\n\nBogdanos, Matthew and William Patrick. Thieves of Baghdad.

I am one of 3,500 Greek orphans adopted to the U.S. in the 1950s. Conceived in an act of violence, I was born to an unwed mother who was exiled from her island home for 44 years. Homeless and seven months pregnant in a large mainland city, she could not care for me and lost me to foreign adoption. Raised in California, I returned to Greece when I was 30 where, through a series of life-changing events, I reconnected with my birth mother. Finally, as the orphaned child, I tell my story.

Maryland: PublishAmerica, 2003.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the small nation of Greece began the arduous task of rebuilding its ruined infrastructure. This frail effort was disrupted by rival factions whose power struggle culminated in a bloody civil war. The fragile peace that ensued was shattered by the wrath of nature. A series of destructive quakes leveled whatever was still standing, and many people perished. This story is about a young orphan’s struggle to carry on. The account is a composite of personal recollections and retold anecdotal episodes. The story carries a strong universal message of persevering determination in the face of adversity. The world has always been a hostile place and one can either blame his predicaments for failures or attribute them to successes in life. Eftihios chose to do the latter with quiet resolve.

The author’s motto: “Did you ever return to Dresden, Professor Spanos?” “I never left there.” Critical to the narration are the first words of the first chapter: “I am a Greek American”\n\n(1). Note that Spanos comes from a working class immigrant family that became highly educated and prominent, with one brother a politician in N.H. and Massachusetts. In his early years in Newport, N.H. Spanos recalls running away from his ethnic self in response to treatment as a second-class citizen. His “conflicted experience” of his unit's probable betrayal in the Battle of the Bulge and “American’s destructive power in the world” in the Dresden bombing, and the forced labor he endured picking up corpses and enduring spittings by Germans who survived the attack, functions to draw out “the silent hyphen between my Greek and American selves”\n\n(2). Spanos’s memories, unspoken for decades, the act of narrating the unbelievable story of his disappearance for 5 months and return to his family in Newport NH as if from the dead become grist to his intellectual mill. The Dresden firebombing is the ground zero of his intellectual skepticism with respect to American institutions and ideals. (Artemis Leontis)\n\nSpyratos, Kristalenia.

He returned to Greece in 1921 and got married, but because of restrictive immigration policy, he could not return to the United States until 1925. He left his wife and daughters behind, and they joined him in 1934. Stamatiades writes about growing up in Greece and immigrating to the United State. He includes anecdotes about the Italian occupation of the island in the 1920s, his role in organizing the OMONIA of Karpathian Aperians in the United States, and his activities in the labor movement. Because of the latter, he was jailed and blacklisted. Stamatiades worked as a waiter in New York for 55 years. He and his wife raised three daughters and two sons. The book is not the traditional memoir. It includes not only stories about his life, but a short biography of his wife Marigo, his thoughts about the universe and society, adages of how to live, several nostalgic poems by him and fellow patrioti from Karpathos, correspondence received from friends and relatives, two maps, and eight photos\n\nStratakis, Christopher.

The National Herald Online (2010): 10.\n\n“The Cyprus File is an engrossing chronicle of the anti-Makarios coup organized by the Greek junta that triggered the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. It is the work of James G. Pyrros, then in the midst of a 20-year career as an aide to Democratic Congressman Lucien Nedzi of Michigan. While not in the policy level of government, Pyrros had an inside-the- beltway view of Washington's reaction to the crisis. In addition to being a Congressional aide, he also had long been part of an informal group seeking to educate American politicians and mass media about the junta that had seized power in Greece in 1967. That involvement provided Pyrros with considerable insights into the agonies of the summer of 1974. The Cyprus File is not an academic study. It is a segment of a larger diary Pyrros began to write in 1943 after reading William Shirer's bestselling Berlin Diary. Pyrros also wanted to write of events immediately as they occurred. This perspective became especially critical when… it came time for me to play a political role as participant and observer. The resulting diary is exciting reading that accurately records the shocks, fears, and hopes generated by events as they unfolded not only day-to-day, but also hour-to-hour and even minute-to-minute. Although most readers will know the ultimate out-come of events, The Cyprus File is a page-turner in the very best sense of the word.”\n\nGeorgakas, Dan. Review of Broken Greek: A Language to Belong.

Princeton University Press, 2019.\n\nThis is the first biography to tell the fascinating story of Eva Palmer Sikelianos (1874–1952), an American actor, director, composer, and weaver best known for reviving the Delphic Festivals. Yet, as Artemis Leontis reveals, Palmer’s most spectacular performance was her daily revival of ancient Greek life. For almost half a century, dressed in handmade Greek tunics and sandals, she sought to make modern life freer and more beautiful through a creative engagement with the ancients. Along the way, she crossed paths with other seminal modern artists such as Natalie Clifford Barney, Renée Vivien, Isadora Duncan, Susan Glaspell, George Cram Cook, Richard Strauss, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Nikos Kazantzakis, George Seferis, Henry Miller, Paul Robeson, and Ted Shawn. Brilliant and gorgeous, with floor-length auburn hair, Palmer was a wealthy New York debutante who studied Greek at Bryn Mawr College before turning her back on conventional society to live a lesbian life in Paris. She later followed Raymond Duncan (brother of Isadora) and his wife to Greece and married the Greek poet Angelos Sikelianos in 1907. With single-minded purpose, Palmer re-created ancient art forms, staging Greek tragedy with her own choreography, costumes, and even music. Having exhausted her inheritance, she returned to the United States in 1933, was blacklisted for criticizing American imperialism during the Cold War, and was barred from returning to Greece until just before her death. Drawing on hundreds of newly discovered letters and featuring many previously unpublished photographs, this biography vividly re-creates the unforgettable story of a remarkable nonconformist whom one contemporary described as “the only ancient Greek I ever knew.”\n\nPanourgiá, Neni. “Effacing Athens.” Rev. of Facing Athens: Encounters with the Modern City, by George Sarrinikolaou.

University of Michigan Press, 2019.\n\nReveals the history of how 3,000 Greek children were shipped to the United States for adoption in the postwar period. This book presents a committed quest to unravel and document the postwar adoption networks that placed more than 3,000 Greek children in the United States, in a movement accelerated by the aftermath of the Greek Civil War and by the new conditions of the global Cold War. Greek-to-American adoptions and, regrettably, also their transactions and transgressions, provided the blueprint for the first large-scale international adoptions, well before these became a mass phenomenon typically associated with Asian children. The story of these Greek postwar and Cold War adoptions, whose procedures ranged from legal to highly irregular, has never been told or analyzed before. Adoption, Memory, and Cold War Greece answers the important questions: How did these adoptions from Greece happen? Was there any money involved? Humanitarian rescue or kid pro quo? Or both? With sympathy and perseverance, Gonda Van Steen has filled a decades-long gap in our understanding, also for the hundreds of adoptees and their descendants, whose lives are still affected today.\n\nBibliographies\n\nAnagnostou, Yiorgos and Fevronia K.

Often, their cultures have “melted” into American culture. In other cases, or sometimes simultaneously, they keep their traditions, and assimilate American culture into their own. Often, many documents and artifacts of their history are lost, especially if there is no effort to archive, organize and keep them in a safe place. Many Greek American cultural artifacts are being lost. Hardships and accomplishments of ancestors may be forgotten forever. This is an exploratory, qualitative research of Greek-American archives in the United States. This is a preliminary report, which includes interviews of people involved in the effort to archive Greek American cultural documents and artifacts. The purpose of the interviews is to see if there is an organized national effort to collect and maintain Greek American archives, and to explore the reasons why there is or is not such an effort. A small comparison of Greek-American and other ethnic groups’ archival efforts will be presented. This research includes efforts of Greek Americans to archive their own history in this country, and excludes efforts of archiving information on Greek cultural or of solely religious material.\n\nCOMEDY\n\na) Comedy in Popular Culture\n\nBasile. “Growing Up Greek in America: Comedy Greek Style.” SpiceRaque Entertainment & BZK Productions.

The Hidden Schools: Mapping Greek Heritage Language Education in Canada, University of Toronto, 2016.\n\nSince the languages of immigrant communities in Canada are categorized as “non-official”, our government is under no obligation to contribute to the perpetuation of these languages. Furthermore, education, in general, is a provincial responsibility. Thus, no formal reporting and documentation of Heritage/International Language Programs takes place at the national level. Given this situation, the various ethnic community groups are left alone with the task of protecting their valuable linguistic and cultural heritages. Inevitably, without national information sharing or support from the Canadian government, HL policy and programming are in a precarious state. My study involves my participation in a community-based research project that aims to locate, map, assess and develop the Greek HLE resources in Canada. Theoretically based on the concepts of Ethnolinguistic Vitality and Language Maintenance, my investigation (a) addresses the question of access to Greek language and culture education by exploring the programs and resources currently available to HL learners; (b) formulates an asset-based model to analyze the capacity of the Greek community's HLE system and proposes changes for its upgrade; and (c) develops a database to allow community members, HLE stakeholders and researchers to search for information about Greek language schools, community organizations and cultural events across Canada. Overall, this investigation addresses the retention and development of Canada’s cultural and linguistic resources through HLE. My findings demonstrate that for Heritage Languages to be maintained in Canada beyond the third generation, communities need to assume responsibility and foster three necessary conditions for educational success in the 21st century: access, innovation and motivation. As a starting point, I suggest locating, sharing and developing HLE assets through collaborations with stakeholders, including universities, governments, interested professionals and funding agencies. This study not only brings into prominence Greek HLE in Canada, but also underscores the passion and determination of immigrant communities to fully participate in mainstream society without diminishing their cultural and linguistic capital.\n\nBeck, Ann. Greek Immigration to, and Settlement in, Central Illinois, 1880-1930. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2014. [available here]\n\nThis dissertation is a micro-history of Greeks immigrants to central Illinois between 1880 and 1930. The study focuses specifically on those Greek immigrants who were involved in the confectionery trade, opening candy stores (often accompanied by soda fountains and restaurants) in the small towns and cities of rural Illinois. The study draws upon, as its primary case study, the life and experiences of my own grandfather, Constantin “Gus” Flesor, a Greek immigrant who settled in Tuscola, Illinois in 1901 and owned a candy store/soda fountain business there for 75 years. In all, this dissertation tells the stories of more than 160 such Greek immigrant confectioners in more than forty towns and cities in central Illinois. Examples from the lives of my grandfather and these other first-generation Greek immigrants are interwoven throughout the dissertation to illustrate particular experiences. The dissertation begins with a discussion of migration theory, which seeks to locate the first-generation Greek immigrant experience in rural areas within the larger theoretical debate that has primarily focused on the urban immigrant experience. Chapter Two provides a geographical and historical background by briefly reviewing relevant features of Greek geography, particularly that of the Peloponnese region from where most of the immigrants in this study originated. This chapter also contains a short history of Greece that helps to frame the important question of Greek heritage and identity. Chapter Three presents an overview of first-generation Greek immigration to America, focusing particularly on immigration to Chicago and St. Louis, the primary cities that served as transit points for Greeks coming to central Illinois. Chapter Four explores education and the Greek immigrant, and specifically how Greek immigrants learned the confectionery business. Chapter Five addresses the question of Greek identity, anti- immigrant hostility during this period, especially the activities of the Ku Klux Klan, and how Greek immigrants in these small towns responded to this prejudice and bigotry. Finally, Chapter Six looks at the lives and businesses of the individual Greek immigrants to central Illinois. In my conclusion I address the questions raised by this study and possible avenues for further research.\n\nBringerud, Lydia. \"Whose Tradition?: Adapting Orthodox Christianity in North America\". PhD diss. Memorial University of Newfoundland (Canada), 2019.\n\nFocusing on three Orthodox Christian communities – St. Paraskeva and St. Luke in Midwestern US, and St. Nicolas in Atlantic Canada – this thesis examines the complex cultural dynamics surrounding Orthodox Christianity in North America. I explore the ways believers, both the Orthodox-born and new converts, negotiate with an ancient faith in a contemporary society where this faith may appear counter-cultural. Building on Leonard Primiano’s (1995) theory of vernacular religion, I propose the concept of vernacular theology to shed light on these processes. Despite the illusion of theology as the exclusive purview of clergy, laypeople exercise interpretive agency to creatively adapt doctrine to their individual life circumstances.\n\nConsidering the significant role of Church history in the religious choices and experiences of my consultants, I begin with a historical overview of Orthodox Christianity, from its origins in the Roman Empire to the present day, including its path to North America. The themes of empire, romantic nationalism, anti-Westernism, and Communism that have historically shaped this faith are explored specifically in Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine, the home countries of my Orthodox-born participants. I analyze the Orthodox Church’s response to globalization and how this may affect the future of the Church in North America.\n\nI further consider encounters between converts and Orthodox-born immigrants within the walls of North American Orthodox churches, examining how Orthodox Christian communities meet the needs of these different groups. I argue that those who convert to Orthodox Christianity create exoteric folklore about ethnicity in terms of those who have cultural connections with the faith.\n\nIn my last two chapters, I address theory and practice in the lives of Orthodox Christians, with specific emphasis on how women navigate this patriarchal faith in a society in dialogue with feminist ideas. Themes include understandings of clerical authority, spiritual obedience, and the interpretive agency of parishioners. I offer a theory of vernacular feminisms, in which women create strategies of empowerment within a patriarchal system. By creating these choices for themselves, they simultaneously subvert and support a system that limits them on the basis of gender.\n\nDiamanti-Karanou, Panagoula, The Relationship between Homeland and Diaspora: The Case of Greece and the Greek-American. PhD diss. Boston: Northeast University, 2015.\n\nIn an increasingly global world, diasporas are unique actors since they represent a fusion of the cultures, interests and mentalities of their old and new homelands. Thus, the relationship between homelands and diasporas becomes quite significant. Nevertheless, it remains understudied. This dissertation attempts to contribute to the study of this phenomenon through an in-depth examination of the relationship between Greece and the Greek diaspora in the United States. The Greek state and the Greek-American community are interdependent on each other. The state relies on the community for assistance in the areas of development, economic cooperation, humanitarian aid, and advocacy for foreign policy issues. The community relies on the Greek state for support with respect to Greek education and the preservation of Greek culture in the United States. The relationship between the two entities reflects the dynamics of a partnership although the state has tried in the past to extend its control over the Greek-American community. However, the community has proved its independence vis-à-vis the Greek state. In order to have a more fruitful partnership in the future, a number of conditions should be in place, including a systematic and well-planned diaspora policy on the part of the Greek state and better organized structures on the part of the Greek-American community. Moreover, a better and deeper knowledge and appreciation of each other is very important for any further cooperation: the Greek state needs to get to know the spectrum of Greek identity and culture that exists in the Greek-American community while the Greek-Americans need to have a deeper knowledge of Greece and Greek culture. The Greek-American diaspora can have a significant role as an agent of positive change and it can be a unique bridge between the two nations enriching them both at the same time.\n\nEleftheriou, Joanna, This Way Back: Essays from Cyprus. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Missouri, Columbia, 2015.\n\nThis Way Back is a creative dissertation that explores the predicament of the transmigrant, the immigrant who has the capability of returning to the host country, and gets caught in an in-between space, not quite assimilated, and not quite unchanged. Transmigrant subjectivities coincide with globalized financial markets, and with twenty-first century forms of national allegiance. The text calls several binaries into question: Greek/Turk, Greek/Cypriot, Greek/American, gay/straight, male/female, ancient/modern, critical/creative writing, and, through its form, essay collection/memoir. The critical introduction, “Essay, Memoir, or Both? Hunger of Memory and the Problem of Nonfiction Hybrids” addresses this binary, and suggests that reading Hunger of Memory as a memoir animated by essayism makes possible a reconciliation of contradictions that have puzzled Rodriguez scholars in the past. The main, creative component of the dissertation relates stories from the authors life as a New-York-born Greek-speaking citizen of Cyprus: dancing to re-enact a mass suicide by jumping off a school stage onto gym mats, harvesting carobs on her great-grandfathers land, purchasing UNESCO-protected lace, traveling against her father’s wishes to the islands occupied north, and pruning cypress trees, geraniums, and jasmine after he grew too weak to lift the shears. Narrating these stories allows her to investigate questions of voluntary and forced migration, nationhood, and war. Political events such as the 1959 guerilla war against British rule, and the 1974 partition of the island, are conveyed through the stories of Cypriot people, the islands refugees and its returnees, among them the authors late father. Together, the essays are a memorial, one which embodies the links between political and personal loss; the individual and the environment; the living and the dead.\n\nGatzouras, Vicky J.

York University (Canada), 2016.\n\nThis dissertation examines Greek immigrant homeland politics during the period of Greeces military dictatorship, 1967 to 1974, in Toronto and Montreal. It carefully considers the internal dynamics of anti-junta activism in Canadas Greek populations, but it also contemplates the meanings of external perceptions, particularly from the Canadian state and Canadian public discourse. The study acknowledges the dominant paradigm of Greek immigrants as unskilled workers, however, it demonstrates that this archetype is not monolithic. In many ways, it is challenged by a small number of Greeks who possessed skills to write letters to politicians, create petitions, organize public rallies, and politically mobilize others. At the same time, this dissertation carefully considers Canadas social and political environment and shows how uniquely Canadian politics ran parallel to and informed Greek homeland politics. Transnationalism is used as an analytical tool, which challenges the meaning of local/national borders and the perception that they are sealed containers. The main argument expressed here is that environments shape movements and migrant political culture does not develop in a vacuum. Each chapter deals with specific nuances of anti-junta activism in Toronto and Montreal. Chapter One examines the organized voices of the Greek community’s anti-dictatorship movement. The chapters latter section looks at how the Panhellenic Liberation Movement (PAK), led by Andreas Papandreou, consolidated itself as the main mouthpiece against Greece’s authoritarian regime. Chapter Two demonstrates that social movements occurring in Canada meshed neatly with anti-junta sentiment, mobilizing many Canadians against the dictatorship. Chapter Three shows how a few skilled Greeks shaped transnational narratives of resistance in local Greek leftist press. Chapters Four and Five examine RCMP surveillance documents related to local politics in Toronto and Montreal. In doing so, the chapters reveal that regional circumstances, particularly Quebec’s Quiet Revolution, shaped security concerns and definitions of Greek subversive activities. Overall, Canadas Greek moment was a complex tale of activism, surveillance, and transnational politics.\n\nKappatos, Nicole. Greek Immigration to Richmond, Virginia, and the Southern Variant Theory. M.A. Thesis. Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Theses and Dissertations. Paper 3483, 2014.\n\n“Greek immigration to the United States occurred in two distinctive waves: the first wave from the 1890s-1920s and the second wave from the 1960s-1980s. This thesis explores the regional diversity of the Greek immigrant experience in the Southern United States through the case study of the Greek community in Richmond, Virginia. The first chapter introduces the history of Greek immigration to the United States, discusses major scholars of Greek American studies, and explains the Southern Variant theory. Chapter two examines the experiences of the first wave of Greek immigrants in Richmond. The third chapter incorporates oral history to explain the experiences of second wave Greek immigrants in Richmond. Chapters two and three examine factors including language, church activity, intermarriage, and community involvement, in order to demonstrate a Southern Variation in the experiences of Greek immigrants in Richmond in comparison to their counterparts elsewhere in the United States.”\n\nKarpathakis Anna.

George Mason University, 2016.\n\nThis study explores teachers’, students’, and parents’ beliefs about language learning in two Modern Greek language programs at the elementary school level in the United States using a phenomenological embedded multiple case study approach. Participant beliefs were identified through a survey which included adapted teacher, student, and parent versions of the Beliefs about Language Learning Inventory (Horwitz, 1988) and adapted subscales related to children’s ability/expectancies, task value, and task perceptions (Eccles & Wigfield, 1995). Student and parent beliefs and lived experiences were further explored using in-depth individual interviews. Results indicate that the students’ beliefs about language learning and specifically about learning Greek were more positive than those of their respective teacher and parents, despite holding some counterproductive or contradictory beliefs about language learning. Their interviews illustrated their negotiations between classroom and home environments and support for learning Greek.\n\nThe parent interviews brought to light that their beliefs were formed from their own experiences with language learning and prior experiences with learning Greek. Across these programs, two distinct conceptualizations for Modern Greek language learning are presented. Educational implications include: addressing goals and expectations; impact of beliefs on program models; students’ contradictory beliefs; assessment of language learning; long-term expectations of Greek language learning; conceptualizations of the roles of identity, culture, and language; and diverging cultures and conceptualizations of Greek language learning.\n\nKindinger, Evangelia. “Homebound: Diaspora Spaces and Selves in Greek American Return Narratives.” Diss.

Harvard University, 2017.\n\nThis dissertation focuses on the music and dance practices of Greek refugee and migrant families from the historical region of Aeolia or Western Anatolia (the Aegean coast of present-day Turkey and the island of Lesvos), including those who settled in the Boston area following the end of the Greco-Turkish War in 1922. Shortly after the end of the conflict, a population exchange between the two states resulted in the deportation of nearly 2 million Greek Orthodox Christians from Turkey – an event known to Greeks as the “Great Catastrophe.” Drawing on five years of ethnographic fieldwork in the Anatolian Greek communities of greater Boston and the island of Lesvos and a wealth of never-before examined archival material, this study examines the multitude of ways that Anatolian Greeks in diaspora have used musically-framed material culture to narrate their community's intergenerational story of displacement and adaptation and enable the preservation and transmission of repertoire, style, and both musical and social memory. Each chapter of this dissertation focuses on a distinct yet overlapping sphere of sensually-rich, performative relationships with material objects and bodily practices in Anatolian Greek music and dance. These include handwritten musical transcriptions from the early 1900s; commercial recordings, from 78 rpm records and piano rolls to compact discs; homemade reel-to-reel tape, cassette, and video recordings; the gendered performance of social dance; legacies of sonic and physical violence; and the role of commensal foodways in theorizing musical time. Drawing on the Greek concepts of myth and mimesis, I highlight the performative agency embedded in these objects and practices. In the process, I reveal that, beyond mere archives or venues of musical and social activity, they are sonic and material sites of emotional valence, nodes for the face-to-face mediation of personal and musical relations, and a means of engaging the body to craft a polytemporal sense of self. These musical archives and actions enter into a pluralistic dialogue with other human and non-human agents to reveal past musical practices, shape contemporary ones, produce ideas and memories about the musicians who made and used them, and contribute to an inherently relational model of Anatolian Greek personhood.\n\nLillios, Emmanuel N. The Relationship Between Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help, Religious Orientation, and Greek Orthodox Religiosity. Diss. University of Iowa, 2010.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of the relationship that attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help have with religiosity and religious orientation among members of the Greek Orthodox Christian Church in the United States. In addition, this study also investigated the nature of the relationship that confessional involvement has with the following variables: intrinsic religious orientation, extrinsic religious orientation, religiosity, attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help, and ethnic background. This is important because Greek Americans, for reasons perhaps related to culture and religion, have historically displayed a reticence to seek professional psychological help when there are psychological problems. There is a paucity of research on the role religiosity and religious orientation has on seeking professional help for mental health problems. Taking a sample from the members of an urban, large-sized Greek Orthodox parish, participants will complete a questionnaire consisting of demographic data, the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help scale (ATSPPH) short form-revised (Fischer & Farina, 1995); the New Indices of Religious Orientation scale (NIRO) short form (Francis, 2007); and the Christian Orthodox Religiousness Scale (CORS) (Chliaoutakis et al., 2002). The results will be analyzed to provide information useful in understanding the relationship between religiosity, religious orientation and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help among members of the Greek Orthodox Church. Implications of these findings and suggestions for further research will be discussed.\n\nLouvarsi, Elenie. «Δύναμη καı Παράδoση» Strength and Tradition: History and Memory of the Greek Genocide in Turkey and its Impact on Culture and Heritage in the United States. University of Colorado at Denver, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018.\n\nFrom 1913-1924 the ethnic-Greeks of Asia Minor were the victims of genocide perpetrated first by agents of the failing Ottoman State, the rise of the Young Turks an finally Mustafa Kemal’s Turkish Republic. This study analyzes the actions and effects of the Turks in three sections. The first chapter defines genocide and ethnic cleansing, and gives a historiography of nationalism, the Greek Genocide and includes a brief historical context. The Second chapter contextualizes the atrocities committed in Asia Minor. This is done by first presenting how nationalism transformed the Balkan Peninsula, and then showing how the Turks systematically dismantled Greek communities in Turkey through attacks. Using survivor testimonies from Nicomedia I show that these attacks were committed against the Greek Orthodox Church, clergy as well as women and children purposefully. Further, I endeavor to show that all of these actions were committed against Greeks in an effort to destroy their sense of identity, to sever community ties, and ultimately to remove them from Turkey. In the third and final chapter, I show how despite their efforts, the descendants of the victims of genocide have, in the United States, established institutions, societies, and organizations to perpetuate and preserve the unique culture and identity that the Turks tried so hard to destroy.\n\nMavratsas, Caesar, V.

Ph.D. Dissertation, Boston University, 1993.\n\nMorrow, Eric V. Transnational Religion in Greek American Political Advocacy. Diss. Baylor University, 2012. (available online)\n\n“Contemporary studies of transnationalism are challenging scholarship on the political advocacy of ethnic groups by examining a broader range of connections that shape immigrant identity and engagement with the political systems of host countries. One of these connections is the role religion has in forming new ethnoreligious identities and how this role is influenced by transnational relationships with countries of origin and external religious institutions. In many analyses of ‘ethnic politics,’ religion is either excluded or viewed as a cultural element closely aligned with ethnic identity. This has obscured the significant influence of religious affiliation and religious institutions in the political advocacy of immigrant groups. This dissertation examines the role of religion in Greek American advocacy and analyzes the transnational elements that have shaped Greek American identity and contributed to the engagement with the United States government on specific foreign policy issues. From a basis in theories of diaspora nationalism and transnationalism and within the larger context of Greek American advocacy, focus is placed on the development of the role of the Greek Orthodox Church in America in defining a unique ethno-religious identity and in direct engagement with U.S. policymakers on the issues of the invasion and partition of Cyprus, the Macedonian Question, and the legal status and religious freedom of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul, Turkey. Following a survey of the role of the Church and its leadership in advocacy on these issues, this dissertation analyzes the elements of transnational religion in the Greek American experience in order to develop a methodology for approaching other groups in the United States. With the increase of immigrant religious affiliation and institutions in America and the diversity of engagement in both domestic and foreign policy issues, the analysis of transnational religious connections is critical to understanding identity formation and ethnoreligious lobbying, as well as gauging the impact of this advocacy on the U.S. political system.”\n\nΜανδατζής, Χρ.

Pulse and the Slow Horizon that Breathes: Two Collections of Poetry and Critical Introduction. The University of Nebraska - Lincoln, 2018.\n\nThis dissertation contains two collections of poetry, one of my own entitled “Pulse,” and one of translations, from the Greek, of the poet Dimitra Kotoula. Both collections, as examined in the introduction, deal with the concrete and metaphorical concept of crossing boundaries. More concretely, throughout these poems, translations, and critical introduction, the narrator is constantly testing her own capacity for hard living, love, and travel. Whereas the translations’ boundary-crossing primarily entails the concept of survival during a major fiscal crisis, the poems’ boundary-crossing primarily entails acts of self-destruction, feelings of discomfort, and ultimate self-resurrection. Both genres, however, both involve the speaker and the actual author crossing into unknown and uncomfortable geographical territories, including Greece, Belize, and Guatemala. No matter what, though, the speaker and the author manage to claw their way out of worldly and self-made destruction and learn to be in the dark until they can actually see in the dark. Resiliency is the thematic core of these collections and introduction, because ultimately, these works seek to interrogate how not only the speaker, but humanity as a whole, are able to live, love, and breathe despite the larger and local sufferings which occur, including war, mass shootings, and death.\n\nNicolaidis, Maria George.

Novels of Return: Ethnic Spaces in Contemporary Greek-American and Italian American Literature. Diss. Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki: Aristotle University, 2011.\n\nThe present thesis is a comparative approach to six Italian-American and Greek-American literary works written in the last three decades of the 20th century. Based on the common theme of the authors' return, either metaphorical or literal to the two countries of origin and their respective cultures, this doctoral thesis explores the common motifs of mythology, ritual and storytelling where the heroes and heroines resort to in their quest for self-definition. In specific, my analysis attempts to answer two questions: how is the journey to self-definition, as well as the formation of subjectivity, connected with the recourse to ethnic space in each of the novels examined? In addition, to what extent are these two elements affected by the constantly changing framework of social, historical and economic conditions, covering two decades? Within the context of the seventies, I discuss Daphne Athas's Cora (1978) and Helen Barolini's Umbertina (1979), whose heroines, caught under the spell of feminist and psychoanalytic trends of their times, realize the importance of ethnic space in their journey towards self-definition. Assisted by diverse theories, I argue that though differently approached, in the end for both novels ethnic space is proven to be a site of resilience and inspiration. Moreover, in the so-called era of post-feminism, Catherine Temma Davidson's The Priest Fainted (1998) and Susan Caperna Lloyd's No Pictures in My Grave (1992) portray heroines who seek enlightenment and guidance by returning to the home country and its culture. In both cases, I consider the theoretical arsenal of revisionist myth making and the late-capitalist dictates reflected, and I argue that the two heroines are carriers of a similar \"haughty\" air of Orientalism. I conclude that since they opt for a \"selective\" ethnicity, they oversimplify and disorient readers as to the importance and difficulty of the ethnic female quest. Finally, utilizing two novels written by male authors, Stratis Haviaras When The Tree Sings (1979) and Tony Ardizzone's In the Garden of Papa Santuzzu (1999), I break away from the exclusive attention to a feminist approach, and view the conceptualization of ethnic space as this is unraveled by the powerful narrative mode of storytelling. Thus, I argue that overcoming the twenty years that separate them, both novels come to underwrite the surviving powers of the oral narrative, project the ethnic story as \"alternative\" history, and portray the diachronic character of ethnic space as a site of rebelliousness and anti- conformism.\n\nPiperoglou, Andonis.

University of California, Santa Barbara, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018.\n\nThis work examines the Evangelical Orthodox Church—a group of evangelical Protestant Christians who, from the 1960s to the 1980s, developed their own ecclesial movement in an effort to restore in the modern world the original Christian church as they believed it would have existed in the first centuries of the current era among the followers of Jesus. They eventually converted as a group of roughly 2,000 members and 19 parishes to Eastern Orthodox Christianity in 1987. To understand the conversion event, the present study examines the interconnections of the theological and cultural changes that brought the group to convert. Understanding the group’s conversion from evangelical Protestant to Orthodox Christian reckons with the issues of religious adaptation in modern society. Adaptation occurs in the spiritual marketplace, which arises from and functions within the plurality of religious choices available in the U.S. In the spiritual marketplace, consumers of spiritual ideas not only choose between religious traditions, but also mix.\n\nGiven the divisions of Eastern Orthodox communities in the U.S. along ethnic lines, I show that the EOC members, who as white evangelical Americans were normally unaware of their ethnic identities and customs, were forced to reckon with their ethnic Identities while they negotiated this theological shift. Many works exist to address the issues of ethnicity and religion in the U.S. The ones that inform this study most significantly consider the construction of whiteness in the U.S. This racialized concept gets to the heart of the issues in this study because it explains the attempts on the part of both EOC members and certain Orthodox leaders to form a culture-free religion. As we will see, EOC members and archdiocesan leaders both bemoaned the connection many Orthodox Christians felt and still feel with their parishes through ethnicity. The EOC and the archdiocese viewed such connections as inauthentic and impure compared to the spiritual, doctrinal truths of Orthodoxy, which they asserted as the proper bases of connection. At the same time, the EOC and the archdioceses advocated the development of an American expression of Orthodoxy, which they predicated on a rejection of ethnicity.\n\nSoumakis, Fevronia K. A Sacred Paideia: The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese, Immigration, and Education in New York City, 1959–1979. Ph.D. diss., Columbia University, 2015.\n\nThis dissertation examines the role the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America played in shaping Greek education in New York City during the period 1959-1979. Beginning in 1959, when Archbishop Iakovos was appointed as the fourth Archbishop by the Ecumenical Patriarch, the Archdiocese focused its attention on expanding and modernizing educational institutions. The Archbishop advocated for a “resurrection of a Greek Orthodox consciousness” in education that would instill knowledge of the Greek language, as well as the historical, cultural, and religious legacy of the Greek Orthodox nation. As parish communities in New York City and the new wave of Greek immigrants heeded the call to build and expand parochial schools over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the Archdiocese’s Department of Education also sought to modernize its curriculum and books, in addition to the challenging task of upgrading the teacher training program at St. Basil’s Academy. Modernization, however, did not entail assimilation and a diminishing of Hellenism, but a renewal of a Hellenic Orthodox identity within a religiously and ethnically pluralistic society. In part, several factors influenced the educational agenda of the Archdiocese: the historical position of the Church in relation to education, the needs of the new immigrants within the broader context of Greek Americans in the US, and the politics of Greece in relation to Cyprus and Turkey. This study ends in 1979 when shifts in demographics, declining enrollments, and competition with public schools compelled the Archdiocese and parish communities to reassess the future of their educational programs. This work weaves the Greek American immigrant experience into the broader narrative of immigration to New York in the post-1965 period. A more complex and dynamic portrait of Greek American education in New York emerges as well as the central role played by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese. The insights from this work contribute the Greek American educational experience to the larger body of scholarship on the history of education in the United States.\n\nStamatis, Yona.

The Intergenerational Integration of Immigrants in the American Society: A Quantitative Study of Attitudes and Behaviors in the Greek American Community of New Jersey. Diss. Panteion University Athens, Greece, 2012.\n\n“This exploratory study examined the extent to which a population of Greek Americans hold attitudes and behaviors for the conservation and intergenerational transmission of their ethnic culture. In particular, six core value domains were considered for their impact on the preservation of ethnic identity: the Greek language, Greek Orthodox Church, family cultural orientation and values, Greek cultural activities and organization membership, continuing contact with Greece and/or Cyprus, and political activity. Data was obtained through a questionnaire administered to 229 self-identified Greek Americans in 11 parishes of the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of New Jersey. The collected data was analyzed quantitatively and the differences in behaviors and attitudes among the first, second, and third and beyond generations were statistically compared. At least four patterns of intergenerational changes emerged. The first pattern was observed within the Greek language domain and demonstrated the steady diminishment of this as a core value from one generation to the next. The second pattern was observed for the domains of the Greek Orthodox Church and Greek cultural activities; here, the core values reflected the least degree of reduction in the subject population. The third pattern was observed mostly in behavior rather than in expressions of attitude regarding the domains of family cultural orientation and values and continuing contact with Greece and/or Cyprus. These domains reflected more similarities exist between the first and second generations while a significant deviation was seen for the third and beyond generational cohort. The fourth pattern was observed in the core values of organization membership and political activity which showed similar responses for the second and third and beyond generational groups, and greater distance from the results for the first generation.”\n\nTchaconas, Terry Nickolas.

A Quest for Human Rights and Civil Rights: Archbishop Iakovos and the Greek Orthodox Church. Wayne State University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018.\n\nThis dissertation consists of a biography of Archbishop Iakovos, Primate of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America from 1959 to 1996, and the role he played in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, his continuing advocacy for human rights, and his vision for a humanistically Greek, theologically Orthodox Christian, and socially just society. The fundamental research question that I sought to answer was why Archbishop Iakovos went to Selma in March of 1965 and participated in a memorial service/civil rights demonstration. What were the influences and circumstances that prompted him, a religious leader of an almost exclusively white ethnic church, to join the African American civil rights movement in the 1960s and to continue to advocate for human rights until his demise in April 2005? How did Iakovos’s identity as a Greek émigré from Turkey, an immigrant to America, and later a United States citizen evolve, and how did he seek to transform the identity of Greek Americans to accomplish his goal of social justice for society?\n\nI argue that the four foundational influences dialectically interacted with Archbishop Iakovos’s evolving identity from émigré to immigrant to United States citizen to citizen of the world, which prompted his civil and human rights activism and contributed to his ultimate vision of a socially just society and world. These four influences were his conviction to the classical Greek ideals of freedom, reason, the pursuit of truth, justice, and equality, his Orthodox Christian belief in the inherent, divinely bestowed dignity that each human being possesses, the history of an oppressed Greek people and discriminated Greek American immigrants, and his personal experience of bigotry and religious persecution growing up in Turkey.\n\nVournelis, Leonidas V.

Greek American Identity Under Historical, Social, and Literary Transformation. Honors Thesis completed under the guidelines of the University of Michigan College of Literature, Science and Arts, Winter 2011.\n\nGreek American Identity Under Historical, Social, and Literary Transformation encompasses three generations of Greeks in Michigan and analyzes Greek identity within and through these generations. I used Yiorgos Anagnostou’s book, Contours of White Ethnicity, as my theoretical base model; I questioned, analyzed, and developed his argument by suggesting that Greek American identity constantly changes throughout each generation via circumstance, social environment, or political atmosphere (just to name a few). I examined three different texts: Legends and Legacies by Pearl Kastran Ahnen, My Detroit by Dan Georgakas, and Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides. I discovered as each text distinctions in literary richness. As we move from pure fact in Ahnen’s work, to memoir in Georgakas’ text, to fictionalization in Eugenides’ novel, the level of flexibility in identity interpretation increases. In other words, the more fiction involved, the more room there is for interpreting identity. This suggests that Greek identity is extremely fluid and is constantly questioned and developed depending on circumstance.\n\nDOCUMENTARY\n\na) Documentaries\n\nBooth, Clark.
