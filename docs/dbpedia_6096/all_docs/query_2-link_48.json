        "text": "For me there is something dreamy and romantic about visiting a site or a scene that I saw in a movie. It makes the experience in visiting that place more magical and intriguing. And when you watch the movie again after your visit you get to relive your experience all over again!\n\nAll of the movies below are American and British films set in Italy so they are all in English and easily available through Amazon or YouTube Movies to rent or buy. All these films are also feel good films even though there is a bit of drama here and there.\n\nWhile I was writing this post I came across other old movies that I must watch, including The September Affair, Roman Springs of Mrs. Stone, Avanti, The Seven Hills of Rome and If It’s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium (only part of this is Italy :) I will add them as I go if they are good!\n\n#1 It started in Naples (La baia di Napoli) - 1960\n\nStarring Sofia Loren and Clark Gable, this movie is playful and fun, and I absolutely adore the little boy who plays Sofia Loren’s nephew - Nando. This film follows the story of Nando, an orphan living on the Island of Capri with his Aunt Lucia (Loren). Clark Gable plays Mike, Nando’s uncle who is in Italy to take care of his late brother’s affairs. When he finds out about Nando and how he is living, he wants to do more to help him and take him to America. Lucia, also wants Nando and so the feud and the fun begins.\n\nWHAT WE SEE - This movie is mostly set on the island of Capri but there are bits of Naples at the beginning and end including Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi and the Naples train station.\n\nThis film highlights the Marina Grande on the island of Capri (the house where Sofia lives in the film is here - see map below), the town of Capri and it’s main piazza - Piazza Umberto. Mike’s hotel room overlooks this piazza. He also spends a few evenings here enjoying a coffee under the stars and the beautiful clock tower.\n\nAs Mike and Lucia get to know each other better, we get to travel around the island a bit. They take a boat ride to the famous Blue Grotto where they get to take a dip in the waters…something that none of us will ever get to do…haha! We also get to see the lovely views from the Anacapri chairlift that takes you up to Mount Solaro. Along with all the wonderful and unique scenery around the island, this film also features Sofia Loren singing Tu vuò fà l'americano (You want to be American).\n\n#2 Come September (Torna a settembre) - 1961\n\nThis wonderful movie stars Rock Hudson, Gina Lollobrigida, Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin. This film has such a special place in my heart! It was my son's first favorite movie (he was about 1 1/2) and we watched it together a lot when we first moved down here to California and didn’t know anyone. It was just me and him in our little apartment. This film kept us company :) Since then it has become one of our favorite movies to watch together as a family.\n\nThis film is mostly set in and around Portofino on the Ligurian coast. The story follows rich and handsome Robert/Roberto (Rock Hudson) as he travels to his palazzo on the Ligurian Coast. Returning earlier than normal he discovers that his trusted Majordomo has been turning his home into a hotel when he is away. As his love interest Lisa (Lollobrigida) comes to stay along with the other guests at the “hotel”, and some unwanted American college students, the antics begin.\n\nWHAT WE SEE - At the beginning of the film you get to see some footage in Milan as they drive Roberto’s car through the streets. We will also get to spend a bit of time in Rome’s Piazza Navona with Lisa before she heads to the Palazzo. As Roberto heads from Milan to the coast we will see some views of the countryside and hill towns…one of which is Rocca di Papa south of Rome. Roberto will also drives through the town of Portofino heading to his house.\n\nThe palazzo where this is filmed is spectacular and from the terrace there is great scenery of Porto di Santa Margherita Ligure. The exact address of the palazzo is Villa delle Palme at Corso Nicolò Cuneo 60 in Santa Margherita Ligure….if you want to look it up after watching the movie! :)\n\nMoving on in the film our characters head off on a Vespa ride into the hills. During this ride we get to see both the ruins at Osta Antica and views of Lake Albano looking out from Villa del Cardinale. I’m pretty sure this lake is in another scene too closer to the beginning of the film when Roberto picks up Lisa from the train station. anyway…both of these locations are near to Rome instead of Portofino as we are made to believe.\n\nTowards the end of the story we head back to Rome. where we will get to see the views from my favorite house* up on the hills of Trastevere as well as the Rome train station.\n\nThis wonderful film is where Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee met and fell in love. Bobby Darin is also featured singing one of his most famous songs - Multiplication.\n\n*On our trip to Italy in 2019 I actually found the house (pic below) that Gina Lollobrigida lives in, in Rome. We would have never found it if there hadn’t been an accident on the main road. Our cab driver took us a back way around the traffic and right by this incredible building. I knew it immediately and it absolutely made my day!! - This building is also shown in the film Three Coins in a Fountain - Below. The address is 35 Via Garibaldi. It is opposite La Fontana dell'Acqua Paola.\n\n#3 Three Coins in a Fountain (Tre soldi nella fontana) - 1954\n\nThree Coins in a Fountain stars Clifton Webb, Dorothy McGuire, Jean Peters, Louis Jourdan, Rossano Brazzi, and Maggie McNamara. This romantic comedy/drama follows three ladies (Anita, Miss Frances and Maria) on their search for love in the eternal city. This film is sweet, romantic and happy.\n\nWHAT WE SEE - During the opening credits of the film, while being serenated by Frank Sinatra singing the theme song Three Coins in a Fountain, we will see some beautiful footage of Rome’s fountains including - Piazza della Repubblica’s Fontana delle Naiadi (Naiadi fountain), Piazza del Popolo’s Fontana dei Leoni (Lions Fountain) and Fontana del Nettuno (Neptune’s fountain), and Piazza Navona’s Fontana del Nettuno (Neptune’s Fountain) and Fontana dei Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers). You will also see the magical fountains of Villa d’Este in Tivoli*.\n\nAs the film continues we will get to walk through picturesque locations in Rome like The Trevi Fountain (where you will get to see each road leading up to the fountain), The Spanish Steps, St Peter’s Square, Piazza Pietro d’Illiria, the Roman Forum and my favorite house at 35 Via Garibaldi in Trastevere. We also get to walk through the gardens at Villa Borghese taking in the views, statues and the Fontana di Venere in Piazzale Scipione Borgheses.\n\nThrough the film as the ladies are picked up, dropped off and taken out for day trips to the country, we get to drive along through the scenery of Rome. We will drive up to the Trevi Fountain, the Colosseum and Constantine’s Arch, the Tempio di Portuno (Portuno Temple), Via Appia Antica, Piazza del Campidoglio and The Museo Nazionale (National Museum).\n\nThis movie also gives us some beautiful bonus scenery as a few of the characters take a quick trip to Venice. As they fly to Venice we get to enjoy some great areal footage of the city as well as take a Gondola ride and enjoy lunch on the Grand Canal.\n\n*Tivoli is about 35 min outside of Rome and is home to one of the most magical places - Villa d’Este. You cannot begin to imagine the beauty of the fountains here. It is something that must be experienced first hand! I remember seeing this movie and falling in love with these fountains. I had no idea where they were but knew that I had never seen anything like them in Rome. It wasn’t until years later that a good friend of mine went to Villa d’Este and posted photos on Instagram. Oh my goodness…I was so excited to finally know where they were :) In 2019 we traveled to Tivoli but sadly the fountains were off that day because of the recent rains. All of the fountains are fed through the natural springs from the area and so they turn them off during and after heavy storms when the waters dirty and muddy. I was so upset to have finally made the trip but not see the fountains. There were still a few big features on and it was beautiful even without the water. I can’t wait to return though!\n\n#4 A room with a view (Camera con vista) - 1985\n\nThis British romantic drama (some British humor in there as well) is set in the year 1907 and takes place in England and Italy. Staring Helena Bonham Carter as Lucy and Julian Sands as George. This movie also features the fabulous Maggie Smith and Judi Dench as well as Denholm Elliot and and Daniel Day-Lewis. This love story is about a young woman finding her way through the restrained Edwardian era culture. It is romantic and full of the properness that only the British can deliver so fantastically.\n\nWHAT WE SEE - Only the first part of this movie is set in Italy. The rest is set in England. For Italy though we will get to see Florence and the Tuscan countryside. At the beginning of the film we get to see some views of the Arno from Lucy’s hotel room. As the characters venture out into Florence we get to walk through some wonderful scenery including Piazza Santa Croce and inside the lovely Santa Croce Church, Piazza della Santissima Annunziata with the Fontane dei Mostri Marini (Sea Monster Fountains), and Piazza della Signoria with its Fontana del Nettuno and its statues - Ercole e Caco and David. During Lucy’s time in Florence we will also get to see more views of the Arno River, Florence skyline, and the Tuscan countryside as everyone takes a day trip to have a picnic.\n\n#5 Summertime (Tempo D’estate) - 1955\n\nI only just watched this movie for the first time a couple of years ago. I couldn’t believe that I’d never seen it because it was completely shot on location in Venice. And if you didn’t know….I LOVE Venice. It was the first city I stepped foot in when I visited Italy for the first time. It has such a special place in my heart! If you love Venice, you will love the scenery in this lovely movie!\n\nSummertime is a drama romance starring Katharine Hepburn & Rossano Brazzi. The film follows a Jane (Hepburn), a middle-aged American secretary traveling alone touring Venice for the first time. This sweet love story shows us some magnificent scenes of Venice as Jane falls in love the magic of Venice and falls in love with Renato (Brazzi), a local Venetian antiques dealer.\n\nWHAT WE SEE - When Jane first arrives we get to see the Venice train station and take a trip on a Vaporetto. This first part is magical as she is traveling on the Vaporetto! There are incredible views of the Venetian canals, the grand canal with the Rialto Bridge, the main Venice Fire station (Love this place! It’s so fun to see the fire boats come and go. >>HERE<< it is on Google), and there is a part where the Vaporetto stops at a traffic light which is so interesting! And as far as I know this doesn’t exist anymore.\n\nAs she disembarks and heads to her hotel we get to walk through Campo Santo Stefano and take in the views from her hotel of the back of Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute and Abbazia di San Giorgio Maggiore.\n\nAs Jane ventures out we get to see some magical scenes in Piazza San Marco during sunset…incredible!! Campo Santo Stefano again, Ponto Barnaba and Campo San Barnaba (this is where Renato’s antique store is and where Jane falls into one of the canals), Piazza San Marco at night, and a quick gondola ride across the grand canal.\n\nAs the story comes to it’s end and Jane ventures out of Venice we get to see the surrounding lagoons as well as some wonderful footage on the island of Burano. The movie finishes where it began, at the Venice train station.\n\n#6 Roman Holiday (vacanze romane) - 1953\n\nOH!! This movie…I have always been in love with it! It’s romantic, dramatic and beautifully funny! AND the scenery in Rome!! It’s just spectacular! I guess one of the only draw backs to the scenery is that it is in black and white. But, as I’ve just learned, that was done on purpose. Movies were being made in color but the director opted for black and white so that the focus would be on the actors and their characters and not the scenery. It’s Rome though so it is absolutely impossible not to look at it…black and white or not :)\n\nThis wonderful story stars Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck and Eddie Albert. If you watch old Italian films at all though you are sure to notice a few other familiar faces. The story follows Ann (Hepburn), an over scheduled princess escaping her life (and granting some of her wishes for a day on the town with reporter Joe Bradley (Peck) who may or may not know she’s a princess. Her wishes take them on an adventurous tour of Rome’s best sites.\n\nWHAT WE SEE - At the beginning of the story we get to see some lovely scenes from Palazzo Brancaccio, including Anne’s bedroom. This palazzo is now a wedding and events center that can be rented out and I bet its incredible to have something there! As the story moves on Ann meats Joe one night along via dei Fori Imperiale (Imperial Forum Road). As they talk we get to see the Settimio Severo Arch in the background.\n\nFrom here we get to see Joe’s apartment at Via Margutta 51. Its interesting because this is the actual address of the building they go to and leave from on the outside. I feel like that doesn’t usually happen in movies. They will always make up a new address or something. The inside of the apartment building is different though so I’m note sure where that site is located.\n\nAs Ann starts her day we get to see Via Margutta, the Trevi Fountain, Via della Stamperia (one of the roads that leads to the Trevi Fountain), and Ann enjoying a gelato on the Spanish Steps…something you can’t do anymore sadly! As Joe joins the day they start working on Ann’s wish list. We get to see them enjoying a drink at Cafe Rocca in Piazza della Rotonda in front of the Pantheon, the Colosseum, and the Wall of Wishes (something from WWII that doesn’t exist anymore).\n\nAs the day continues we get to follow along with Ann and Joe as they visit and create the famous scene at La Bocca della Verità (Mouth of Truth), travel on a runaway Vespa through Piazza Venezia (watch for the part where the go by the Fontana della Pigna (Pinecone Fountain) and finish the day dancing on the barges of the Tiber River in front of Castel Sant’Angelo.\n\nThe final scene of the story, the princess's press appearance, is set in the Palazzo Colonna Gallery.\n\n#7 Letters from Juliet (Lettere a giulietta) - 2010\n\nIf you like beautiful Italian scenery and romantic love stories than this movie is for you. This one will just leave you feeling good…and ready to book a ticket to Italy :) This romantic comedy-drama stars Amanda Seyfried, Christopher Egan and the lovely Vanessa Redgrave. The story follows along Sofie (Seyfried) as she travels to Verona with her fiancé for a pre-wedding honeymoon. Sofie finds herself wandering into Juliet’s House (Casa di Giulietta) in Verona alone and stumbles upon Juliet’s secretaries. As Sofie collects the letters one day she discovered a lost letter from 1957 and feels that she must answer it. This leads her to meeting (Redgrave) and her grandson (Egan). You’ll have to watch it to see what happens next :)\n\nWHAT WE SEE - This beginning of this film show glimpses of New York City but the rest is filmed in Italy. It starts off with some wonderful footage of Verona including Piazza Erbe (this is one of the most beautiful piazzas I’ve ever been in), Piazza Bra with the ancient Roman Verona Arena, and the Ponte Pietra - the Roman stone bridge with arches that date back to 100 BC. As we follow Sofie along at the beginning of her story we get to see lots of lovely streets in Verona’s historic center, some driving in the countryside, and of course Juliet’s House with it’s piazza, Juliet Statue, where everyone rubs Juliet’s breast for good luck, and picturesque balcony.\n\nAs Sofie’s story continues it takes us out of Verona and south into Tuscany where there are magical scenes in small Tuscan towns as well as lots of gorgeous villas and fields in that magical Tuscan countryside. Also while in Tuscany, we get to see some wonderful shots of Siena’s skyline, streets and Siena’s main piazza - Piazza del Campo.\n\nFun fact - There is actually a club that answers mail from all around the world addressed to Juliet. It has been going on since the 1930’s. They read, translate and answer every single letter. The letters are then kept and archived. How sweet is that!? You can visit the site >>HERE<<\n\n#8 Under the Tuscan Sun (Sotto il sole della Toscana) - 2003\n\nThis may be the most well known movie on the list! I feel like there isn’t an Italy lover out there who hasn’t seen this movie or read the book. Two very different stories by the way! I like them both in their own way.\n\nThis movie was the reason that I first ever went to Cortona…and I’m so glad that I did! It is a little touristy at this point but it is still one of my favorite Tuscan towns, and the views are simply to die for. Plus it has one of my favorite churches in Italy at the very top of the hill -Basilica di Santa Margherita. I have been back to it many many times since that first trip and I still love it. (Learn more about Cortona >>HERE<< ).\n\nThe romantic comedy stars Diane Lane, Sandra Oh, Lindsay Duncan and Raoul Bova. The story follows Frances (Lane), a newly divorced writer who’s a bit depressed and lost for what to do next in life. When her friend urges her to take her place (and plane ticket) for a tour of Italy, Frances can’t help but say yes. This one decision leads Frances to purchasing a rundown villa and moving to Italy. Lots of ups & downs, love, friends and a lovely story are what comes next.\n\nWHAT WE SEE - The beginning of this film is set in San Francisco. Once we get to Italy though the story briefly takes us to Florence for a shot of it’s Duomo, and then on to some wonderful scenery around Tuscany including sunflower filled fields and cypress lined roads. One of the first stops (and last stop for Frances) is Cortona. There are some lovely scenes of the drive up as well as the market, and the main piazza, Piazza della Repubblica.\n\nAs Frances’ story unfolds we get to see the more of that wonderful Tuscan countryside as well as a trip to Arezzo for the flag throwing festival. We also get to see bits and pieces of Cortona throughout the movie including Christmas time in the Piazza and a scene in Piazza Luca Signorelli where Kathrine (Duncan) reenacts a famous scene from La Dolce Vita. The fountain was actually created for the film and placed in Piazza Luca Signorelli. It’s too bad it’s not real because it is really beautiful!\n\nFrances ventures away from Cortona a couple of times throughout the film, taking us to Rome where we get to see some of Rome’s streets as well as Piazza Venezia. We also get to see some lovely scenes from the town of Positano on the Amalfi Coast.\n\n#9 Only You (Amore a prima vista) - 1994\n\nOut of this whole list, this movie has the most special place in my heart. As a teenager in the mid 90’s who dreamed of going to Italy I watched this movie more times than I can count. This movie was the inspiration for my first trip to Italy at 21. I went to Venice, Rome and the Amalfi Coast specifically because of this movie. On the Amalfi Coast I actually ended up meeting Angelo Cinque (story about him >>HERE<<) who was an Extra in the scene at the Hotel Le Sirenuse (a beautiful hotel I hope to stay at someday!). He took me there and introduced me to the gentleman behind the check-in desk who actually plays himself in the movie :) What a fun experience and wonderful memory for me after all of those years of watching the movie and dreaming about being there someday!\n\nThis romantic comedy stars Marisa Tomei, Robert Downey Jr., and Bonnie Hunt. It follows Faith (Tomei). As a teenager, Faith was told that her destiny is a man named Damon Bradley. Years later when Faith is just 10 days from marrying another man, Damon Bradley (her fiancé’s old friend) calls to wish them all the best. Faith drops everything, jumps on a plane with her friend Kate (Hunt) and sets off for Italy to find her soulmate.\n\nWHAT WE SEE - The journey starts off in Venice with some lovely views of the building facades as we glide down the grand canal. We also get a glimpse inside Hotel Danieli - a luxery hotel close to Piazza San Marco. Someday I would love to stay here!!\n\nAfter Venice we travel south where Faith and Kate get lost driving around in Tuscany. They run out of gas on a very picturesque rode with San Gimignano in the background (I’ve tried to find this exact rode but haven’t yet…haha). After some help to get back on the road again they finally end up in Rome.\n\nIn Rome we get to see Piazza Navona and Neptunes Fountain, along with lots of Roman streets, fountains and ruins. Faith and Kate dine by the Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere in Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, and we get to walk along with Faith while she takes a romantic walk and dances on the Ponte Fabriccio and Isola Tiberina (Tiber Island). There is also a fun scene at La Bocca della Verita where the famous scene from Roman Holiday is reenacted.\n\nAfter Rome we travel south again to Positano on the Amalfi Coast. There are incredible scenes of the mountains, cliffs and sea as they drive south. Faith spends time here in Positano staying at the beautiful Le Sirenuse Hotel. We get to see the lobby and pool area as well as the rooms and balconies of the hotel along with the streets and steps of Positano.\n\n#10 Tea with Mussolini (Un tè con Mussolini) - 1999\n\nThis semi-autobiographical comedy-drama war film stars two of my favorites, Judy Dench and Maggie Smith. This film also stars Cher, Lily Tomlin and Joan Plowright. The story follows along an orphaned Italian boy named Luca and the circle of British and American ladies who help take care of him. The story takes place in Italy before and during World War II.\n\nI love this movie! There is beauty and British humor and even though it is set during WWII it doesn’t feel too heavy. It is a wonderful story that I know you will love!\n\nWHAT WE SEE - The beginning of this film our British ladies and Luca take us walking through the streets of Florence, past Piazza della Signoria with its statues and clock tower and the Florence Cathedral and bell tower. We also get to see the English Cemetery that sits right in the middle of Piazza Donatello (An odd place for a cemetary I think!), the wonderful Piazza della Santissima Annuziata with its Fontane dei Mostri Marini (Sea Monster Fountains) and inside the Ospedale degli Innocenti.\n\nAs Luca’s story moves on and the ladies help take care of him we get to see a maagnificent room full of statues at the Instituto D’Arte, as well as walk by the lovely Basilica di Santa Maria Novella. We get to sit in the public gardens of Piazza Nicola Demidoff and visit some ancient ruins in the town of Fiesole outside of Florence.\n\nAs the film heads farther into WWII we get to see the inside and outside of the Uffizi Gallery as well as the Ponte Santa Trinita and the Florence Train Station. Soon after this our characters head out of Florence where we get to see some wonderful scenery in the Tuscan countryside on way to San Gimignano.\n\nExcept for a minute when the film shows Piazza Signoria in Florence and that same spectacular room full of statues at the Art Institute, the rest of the story, and the end of the war, is set in the Tuscan hill town of San Gimignano. There we get to see Piazza del Duomo and Piazza Erbe with its famous towers. We also get to see quite a few different shots in Piazza della Cisterna and Albergo Cisterna (Hotel Cisterna). The ladies stay at this hotel and enjoy the fabulous view of the valley below from the balcony. The most beautiful part of the stay in San Gimignano is the inside of the church of Santa Maria Assunta with its frescos, specifically the La Cappella di Santa Fina that the ladies work hard to protect.\n\n#11 Rome Adventure (Gli amanti devono imparare) - 1962\n\nI remember my dad talking about this movie and how breathtaking all the scenery in Italy was. And it is…it really really is! I don’t think there is another English speaking movie set it Italy that shows as much as this one. It is truly amazing! And so incredible to see what everything was like in the 60’s. I wish I could go back in time!!\n\nRome Adventure, also known as Lovers Must Learn (this name remained in the Italian version), is a romantic drama. It stars Suzanne Pleshette (Prudence Bell), Troy Donahue (Don Porter), Angie Dickinson and Rossano Brazzi. The film follows along Prudence as she travels to “where they really know what love is about - Italy”. As her love story unfolds so does the lovely scenery in Italy!\n\nWHAT WE SEE - When Prudence first arrives we are driven through ancient Rome with the Arch of Constantine, The Colosseum, The Roman Forum, and Piazza Venezia. On her first days in Rome we will get to see Castel Sant’Angelo and Ponte Sant’Angelo, Scalinata dell'Ara Coeli, Piazza del Campidoglio, the noon cannon firing that happens daily (even today) in Piazzale Giuseppe Garibaldi in Trastevere, Piazza San Pietro (the piazza in from of St. Peter’s Basilica) and Bernini’s fountains at sunset in the lovely Piazza Navona. We also get a quick trip to the Rome train station. This film really does show so much and it’s only just getting started!\n\nAs the movie moves on, Prudence and her love interest Don take a bus tour together during the Ferragosto holiday. Leaving from the beautiful Piazza della Repubblica, the tour’s first stop is Ostia Antica, an ancient Roman port filled with ruins. Moving on in the tour they head north to Bomarzo’s Parco dei Mostri (Monster park…look it up. It very interesting!). We then head to the flag throwing festival in Arezzo, Michelangelo’s David in Florence and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Strangely after this the film heads back down south to Orvieto and its Cathedral before finishing up north at Lago Maggiore and the Giardino D’Amore on the Isola Bella. I’m not sure why they put the film together this way! Even though their tour is done they keep on exploring. From Lago Maggiore they head up to the Dolomites where we get to see some wonderful views of the Sassolungo and valleys as well as the town of Ortisei with its Piazza San Durich.\n\nFor the last stop of there trip they enjoy the colorful city of Verona. Here we get to see some wonderful sites like Juliet’s house with piazza and balcony, the Ponte Castel Vecchio, the Ponte Pietra - the Roman stone bridge with arches that date back to 100 BC, the ancient Roman Verona Arena, Piazza Erbe and its market, Scala della Ragione and Piazza dei Signori with its statue of Dante Alighieri. So amazing!\n\nAs the story comes to an end we are taken back to beautiful majestic Rome.\n\n#12 To Rome with Love (A Roma con amore) - 2012\n\nIf you don’t like Woody Allen movies then just skip this one…haha! I don’t like all of his stuff but I do like this film. To Rome with Love stars Woody Allen, Roberto Benigni (my favorite!!), Penelope Cruz, Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, an Alison Pill. It follows along the lives of 4 different couples in Rome and the romances, adventures and predicaments that they find themselves in.\n\nWHAT WE SEE - This film bounces back and forth since it follows along different stories but we get to see tons of different bits and pieces of Rome! Some of the big things we see are Piazza Venezia, the Scalinata dell'Ara Coeli (Stairway of the Ara Coeli) by the Vittorio Emanuele II Monument, the Trevi Fountain, Villa d’Este (in Tivoli outside of Rome), Acquedotto Claudio (Claudio Aquaduct), the ruins of Villa dei Quintili, the lake and gardens at Villa Borghese, and Piazza Navona and Piazza Mattei and their fountains. There are many beautiful street scenes in this film too as the characters and their unfolding stories walk around Rome.\n\nOne of the stories that we follow spends a lot of their time in Trastevere. Here we get to see many wonderful street scenes plus La Porta Settimiana and Piazza Santa Maria in Trastavere."
