        "text": "Phenomenal! Greek historical fiction is new to me, and despite being unsure when I first started reading, this book pulled me right into its web. You meet three women, all born in different decades/generations, who share commonality in their experiences. The characters are easy to love (or despise), the pace builds nicely, the author does a great job of describing the scenery so that it feels like you’re there. I also really enjoyed the mythology that is mixed into the story.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own. Thank you to NetGalley and Harper Muse for the ARC.\n\nThis will be out on October 8 and I highly recommend you grab a copy!\n\nMy new favorite Yvette Manessis Corporon book! I didn’t think anything could top Where the Wandering Ends, but Daughter of Ruins has done it!\n\nYou’re taken on an epic journey through the life of Demitra, whose story is as captivating as it is heartbreaking. A story of love, loss, and the enduring strength of women who defy stereotypes and overcome the odds. A testament to the power of love— its ability to uplift and to devastate. Demitra is relatable and inspiring and her resilience and determination are powerful.\n\nWith a vivid description of Greece you’re transported to the ancient ruins, and the vibrant seascapes of the Mediterranean. You can almost feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, see the bright blue of the Sea, and smell the salt air. The setting came to life, I felt like I was there.\n\nI couldn’t stop turning the page- hooked from start to finish, I couldn’t put it down.\n\nA must read for fans of Greek mythology, strong female characters , and beautiful settings.\n\nThe story lingers in your mind & heart long after you’ve turned the last page.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Harper Muse for providing me with an ARC of this novel in return for an honest review.\n\nIn our introduction to Demitra, a young girl growing up on the island of Cephalonia, Greece, she is in the act of burning a letter she's written to her mother so the smoke will carry her words to heaven. The story follows her as she grows up, occasionally veering into chapters focused on two other women: Elena, an Italian prostitute in Greece; and Maria, a Greek \"picture bride\" shipped over to America to marry a man she doesn't know. The three women's stories are interconnected and together weave a tail of love, loss, growth, overcoming generational hindrances, and finding one's place in the world.\n\nDespite moments of tragedy, despair, and loss, Daughter of Ruins manages to be a hopeful and comforting read. Demitra, as main character and the thread that connects everyone else, is wholly fleshed out and easily comes off the page. It's effortless to feel for her, to root for her, and in her relationship with her step-mother, Stella, there is a much needed balm for both Demitra and the reader. Of all the relationships in the story, this one is perhaps my favorite, followed closely by the (to avoid naming them and thus spoiling anything) the \"bakery team\" in the latter portions of the book.\n\nBeyond a compelling story, there are deftly woven symbols and references to Greek mythology throughout the story. As a lover of Greek mythology, I really appreciated these and how they were used in the story. Some of the parallels between the mythological women and the characters were obvious, but they were no less powerful for it. They provide another layer of insight to the characters as well as the culture. Is it weird to say they also help to anchor the Greek-ness of this book, beyond the descriptions of Greek locales? Well, they do, and I loved it. Scenery jumps off the page in this, too.\n\nWith a satisfying ending, this was a perfect sort of comfort read about found and chosen family and I look forward to its official publication.\n\nThis is a dual-time novel of 3 strong Greek women A motherless daughter. An Italian prostitute. A mail-order bride. Woven within this tapestry is Greek mythology, which no story set in Greece would be left out. Demitra's mother died in America in the 1930s when Demitra was three years old. She was brought back to Greece by her father and is now living with her “Baba.” In 1943 we are introduced to Elena a beautiful Italian woman who is a prostitute and until the Germans arrived she was entertaining Italian soldiers. Maria lives in a poor mountain village in 1921 and is sent to America as ‘picture bride’ for Greek emigrants in search of a wife. With a cast of supporting characters this book is an emotional read that takes into account love, loss as well as the rich history of Greece and its myths. Three women who find it difficult and have to fight to find what their lives were really about Told in a most sensitive and compassionate way, I am giving this story 5 stars. Thanks to NetGalley for this ARC...highly recommended.\n\nI could easily read this again and it is not often I say that about a book! I cannot wait to own a physical copy of this book when it is published. It is such a beautiful novel saturated perfectly in Greek culture and my senses were alight based on the descriptions.\n\nThe women in this novel are all 'ruined' in different ways, whether physically or because society deems them to be, yet they have so much beauty and power. They have an enduring strength against so much adversity and I loved seeing them take back control of their destiny.\n\nGreek mythology is weaved through the story and any fans of female figures in Greek mythology will love this.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to read this book - it will stay with me for a very long time.\n\nDaughter of Ruins by Yvette Manessis Corporon is a poignant dual-time narrative set in Greece and the United States. The author artfully weaves together Greek mythology and art with the post-war travails of everyday Greeks, brave women, arranged marriages, and the heartbreaking cost of human trafficking. This page-turning historical novel entertains us, even as it moves, and educates us.\n\nThe novel’s engaging protagonists are Maria (‘past’ - 1920s) and her daughter, Demitra (‘present’ – 1940s onwards). Raised by her ‘Baba’, Pericles, Demitra mourns the loss of the mother she barely remembers, after her father returned with her from Milwaukee to his home island of Cephalonia. There, left to struggle with her Baba’s unaccountable hostility, Demitra writes letters to her mother, whom she’s recast as a goddess from Greek myth. Compelled to create, Demitra loves nothing better than to sketch the beauty around her. Baba has no tolerance for his daughter’s gift, instead determining to marry her off to the hapless Niko as soon as possible.\n\nNiko is but one of several beautifully constructed supporting characters who provide a convincing picture of Greek community life in this challenging period. Stella was another one of my favourite characters, together with Demitra’s cousin Sophia, her husband, Tino, and family, who offer Demitra an escape route from Baba’s single-minded plans. I appreciated the author’s skill in balancing conflict and injustice with the warmth and generosity of people of goodwill.\n\nEleni is another trafficking victim, condemned by the bigotry of the era to follow her mother into the sex industry. Her story intersects with Demitra’s when Eleni accompanies Italian soldiers to Cephalonia during their occupation of the island during World War II.\n\nTwenty years prior, Maria’s story is interwoven strategically with Demitra’s. Unknowingly tricked into posing for a photograph by her father, Maria finds herself shipped off to the United States with other hapless Greek girls — some as young as fourteen — as ‘picture brides’ for Greek emigrants in search of a wife. The girls’ fear and bewilderment are masterfully depicted, even more so as we follow Maria’s journey into her marriage with Pericles. Pericles is a difficult character to like, but it must be said that the author does a superb job in calibrating his story arc as well.\n\nLove and loss, creation, and devastation, run through this riveting story. The unifying device of Greek myth is a clever one, sensitively portrayed, and doesn’t overpower the narrative or require any prior knowledge by the reader. But it’s the central triad of women — Maria, Demitra, and Eleni — who are the driving force of this warm and compassionate novel, which I recommend whole heartedly.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
