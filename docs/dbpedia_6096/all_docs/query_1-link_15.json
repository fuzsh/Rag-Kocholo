If you would like to take these questions as a Quiz, head on here to take these questions in a test format, absolutely free.\n\nPassage 1 : CAT Reading Comprehension: Power in language\n\nThe first systems of writing developed and used by the Germanic peoples were runic alphabets. The runes functioned as letters, but they were much more than just letters in the sense in which we today understand the term. Each rune was an ideographic or pictographic symbol of some cosmological principle or power, and to write a rune was to invoke and direct the force for which it stood. Indeed, in every Germanic language, the word âruneâ (from Proto-Germanic *runo) means both âletterâ and âsecretâ or âmystery,â and its original meaning, which likely predated the adoption of the runic alphabet, may have been simply â(hushed) message.â\n\nEach rune had a name that hinted at the philosophical and magical significance of its visual form and the sound for which it stands, which was almost always the first sound of the runeâs name. For example, the T-rune, called *Tiwaz in the Proto-Germanic language, is named after the god Tiwaz (known as Tyr in the Viking Age). Tiwaz was perceived to dwell within the daytime sky, and, accordingly, the visual form of the T-rune is an arrow pointed upward (which surely also hints at the godâs martial role). The T-rune was often carved as a standalone ideograph, apart from the writing of any particular word, as part of spells cast to ensure victory in battle.\n\nThe runic alphabets are called âfutharksâ after the first six runes (Fehu, Uruz, Thurisaz, Ansuz, Raidho, Kaunan), in much the same way that the word âalphabetâ comes from the names of the first two Hebrew letters (Aleph, Beth). There are three principal futharks: the 24-character Elder Futhark, the first fully-formed runic alphabet, whose development had begun by the first century CE and had been completed before the year 400; the 16-character Younger Futhark, which began to diverge from the Elder Futhark around the beginning of the Viking Age (c. 750 CE) and eventually replaced that older alphabet in Scandinavia; and the 33-character Anglo-Saxon Futhorc, which gradually altered and added to the Elder Futhark in England. On some inscriptions, the twenty-four runes of the Elder Futhark were divided into three Ã¦ttir (Old Norse, âfamiliesâ) of eight runes each, but the significance of this division is unfortunately unknown.\n\nRunes were traditionally carved onto stone, wood, bone, metal, or some similarly hard surface rather than drawn with ink and pen on parchment. This explains their sharp, angular form, which was well-suited to the medium.\n\nMuch of our current knowledge of the meanings the ancient Germanic peoples attributed to the runes comes from the three âRune Poems,â documents from Iceland, Norway, and England that provide a short stanza about each rune in their respective futharks (the Younger Futhark is treated in the Icelandic and Norwegian Rune Poems, while the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc is discussed in the Old English Rune Poem).\n\nWhile runologists argue over many of the details of the historical origins of runic writing, there is widespread agreement on a general outline. The runes are presumed to have been derived from one of the many Old Italic alphabets in use among the Mediterranean peoples of the first century CE, who lived to the south of the Germanic tribes. Earlier Germanic sacred symbols, such as those preserved in northern European petroglyphs, were also likely influential in the development of the script.\n\nThe earliest possibly runic inscription is found on the Meldorf brooch, which was manufactured in the north of modern-day Germany around 50 CE. The inscription is highly ambiguous, however, and scholars are divided over whether its letters are runic or Roman. The earliest unambiguous runic inscriptions are found on the Vimose comb from Vimose, Denmark and the Ãvre Stabu spearhead from southern Norway, both of which date to approximately 160 CE. The earliest known carving of the entire futhark, in order, is that on the Kylver stone from Gotland, Sweden, which dates to roughly 400 CE.\n\nThe transmission of writing from southern Europe to northern Europe likely took place via Germanic warbands, the dominant northern European military institution of the period, who would have encountered Italic writing firsthand during campaigns amongst their southerly neighbors. This hypothesis is supported by the association that runes have always had with the god Odin, who, in the Proto-Germanic period, under his original name *WoÃ°anaz, was the divine model of the human warband leader and the invisible patron of the warbandâs activities. The Roman historian Tacitus tells us that Odin (âMercuryâ in the interpretatio romana) was already established as the dominant god in the pantheons of many of the Germanic tribes by the first century.\n\nFrom the perspective of the ancient Germanic peoples themselves, however, the runes came from no source as mundane as an Old Italic alphabet. The runes were never âinvented,â but are instead eternal, pre-existent forces that Odin himself discovered by undergoing a tremendous ordeal.\n\nThe word âpantheonâ in the passage refers to\n\nA temple of all the gods\n\nAll the gods collectively of a religion\n\nA monument or building commemorating a nation's dead heroes\n\nA domed circular temple at Rome, erected a.d. 120â124 by Hadrian\n\nWhich of the following statements is incorrect?\n\nUnlike the Latin alphabet, which is an essentially utilitarian script, the runes are symbols of some of the most powerful forces in the cosmos\n\nRunic writing was probably first used in southern Europe and was carried north by Germanic tribes.\n\nThe word âruneâ and its meaning was derived from the runic alphabet.\n\nThe first runic alphabets date back to the 1st century CE.\n\nWhich of the following can be inferred from the passage?\n\na. Runic script was most likely derived from Old Italic script.\n\nb. Runes were not used so much as a simple writing system, but rather as magical signs to be used for charms.\n\nc. In the Proto-Germanic period, the god Tiwaz was associated with war, victory, marriage and the diurnal sky.\n\nd. The knowledge of the meanings attributed to the runes of the Younger Futhark is derived from the three Rune poems.\n\nAll the above\n\nii and iv\n\ni, ii and iv\n\ni and iii\n\nWhich of the following cannot be reasonably inferred with regard to the beliefs of the Proto-Germanic people?\n\nOdin came upon the runes after going through a lot of torment.\n\nThe name of a rune was almost always the first sound of a Godâs name\n\nThe cosmological power represented by a rune was invoked by writing it.\n\nProto-German Gods were modeled on humans.\n\nPassage 2 : CAT Reading Comprehension: Upholding the Law\n\nHard cases, it is said, make bad law. The adage is widely considered true for the Supreme Court of India which held in the height of the Emergency, in ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla that detenus under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) could not approach the judiciary if their fundamental rights were violated. Not only was the law laid down unconscionable, but it also smacked of a Court more âexecutive-minded than the executiveâ, complicit in its own independence being shattered by an all-powerful government. So deep has been the impact of this judgment that the Supreme Courtâs current activist avatar is widely viewed as having its genesis in a continuing need to atone. Expressions of such atonement have created another Court made to measure â this time not to the measure of the government but rather the aggrandised self-image of some of its judges.\n\nLet us look back to the ADM Jabalpur case. As a court of law, the Supreme Court was called upon in the case to balance the interest of public order in an Emergency with the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed to every person. Nine High Courts called upon to perform the same function had found a nuanced answer by which they had held that the right to life cannot be absolutely subservient to public order merely because the government declared so â the legality of detentions could be judicially reviewed, though the intention of the government would not be second-guessed by the Court. This was a delicate balance. The Supreme Court however reversed this view and made the right to life and personal liberty literally a bounty of the government. Given that the consequences of their error were entirely to the governmentâs advantage, it was widely viewed as the death of an independent judiciary. The excessively deferential, almost apologetic language used by the judges confirmed this impression.\n\nToday, however, while public interest litigation has restored the independent image of the Supreme Court, it has achieved this at the cost of quality, discipline and the constitutional role judges are expected to perform. The Court monitors criminal trials, protects the environment, regulates political advertising, lays down norms for sexual harassment in the workplace, sets guidelines for adoption, supervises police reform among a range of other tasks of government. That all these tasks are crucial but tardily undertaken by government can scarcely be questioned. But for an unelected and largely unaccountable institution such as the Supreme Court to be at the forefront of matters relating to governance is equally dangerous â the choice of issues it takes up is arbitrary, their remit is not legal, their results often counterproductive, requiring a degree of technical competence and institutional capacity in ensuring compliance that the Court simply does not possess. This sets an unhealthy precedent for other courts and tribunals in the country, particularly the latter whose chairpersons are usually retired Supreme Court Justices. To take a particularly egregious example, the National Green Tribunal has banned diesel vehicles more than 10 years old in Delhi and if reports are to be believed, is considering imposing a congestion charge for cars as well. That neither of these are judicial functions and are being unjustly being usurped by a tribunal that has far exceeded its mandate, is evidence of the chain reaction that the Supreme Courtâs activist avatar has set off across the judicial spectrum.\n\nFinally, the Courtâs activism adds to a massive backlog of regular cases that makes the Indian justice delivery mechanism, slow, unreliable and inefficient for the ordinary litigant. As on March 1, 2015, there were over 61,000 cases pending in the Supreme Court alone. It might be worthwhile for the Court to set its own house in order, concomitantly with telling other wings of government how to do so.\n\nAs we mark 40 years of the Emergency and the darkest period in the Supreme Courtâs history, it might be time to not single-mindedly harp on the significance of an independent judiciary. Judicial independence, is and must remain a cherished virtue. However, it would be blinkered to not confront newer challenges that damage the credibility of our independent judiciary today â unpardonable delays and overweening judges taking on the mantle of national government by proxy. The Supreme Court 40 years on is a different institution â it must be cognizant of its history but not at the cost of being blind to its present.\n\nWhich of the following is a suitable title for the passage?\n\nAn Atonement Gone Too Far\n\nSanctimony from a Ruined Pedestal\n\nThe ADM Jabalpur's Case: The Supreme Court's Darkest Hour\n\nOvercompensating for Past Mistakes\n\nThe author says that the Supreme Court was âmore executive-minded than the executiveâ during the Emergency. Which of the following options captures the essence of what the writer means by the phrase: 'more âexecutive-minded than the executiveâ'?\n\nThe Supreme Court abdicated its independence to an authoritarian government by embracing its perspective.\n\nThe Supreme Court was more emphatic than the Government about exercising executive power under the MISA.\n\nThe Supreme Court reflected the unconscionable actions taken by the government by upholding its laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court wanted to curry favor with the government through its deferential decisions during Emergency.\n\nWhich of the following cannot be reasonably inferred from the passage?\n\nThe Supreme Court was complicit in curbing judicial independence during the Emergency.\n\nPublic interest litigations have, post-Emergency, led to the judiciary overreaching into the realm of legislature.\n\nThe Indian Judiciary ought not indulge in general supervisory jurisdiction to correct actions and policies of government.\n\nThe Indian judiciary must be equipped with technical competence and institutional capacity to ensure compliance to orders passed in relation to public interest litigations.\n\nThe word âegregiousâ in the passage is farthest in meaning to :\n\noutrageous\n\nflagitious\n\ndistinguished\n\narrant\n\nWhich of the following is the author least likely to agree with?\n\nThe rise in judicial activism is in danger making the Supreme Court diffuse and ineffective, encroaching into the functions of government.\n\nWhere the Supreme Court is only moved for better governance and administration, which does not involve the exercise of any proper judicial function, it should refrain from acting.\n\nAdoption, police reform and environment issues are the remit of the judiciary.\n\nThe Indian judicial system needs to focus on clearing the massive backlog of cases to re-establish its credibility.\n\nPassage 3 : CAT Reading Comprehension: Upholding the Law\n\nSound the alarm! The kingdom of letters has admitted Trojan horses: James Frey, JT Leroy, Misha Defonseca, Margaret B. Jones, Herman Rosenblat, and now Matt McCarthy, portions of whose baseball memoir, the New York Times reports, are âincorrect, embellished or impossible.â The watchmen have let down their guards.\n\nI write: Hold your horses. In the rush to diagnose these fake memoirs as symptoms of a diseased culture, we have failed to consider an equally plausible alternative. What if the exposure of fake memoirists is not due to an increased frequency of lying, but rather to our increased ability to root out liars and hold them accountable for their verisimilitudes? Perhaps the outings of these hoaxes mark not a blurring of the line between fact and fiction, but a further demarcation.\n\nIndeed, it may be helpful to remember that the novel was born from exactly such confusion. One of the standards by which the earliest novels were judged was their ability to convince readers that their narratives were, in fact, real. Authors deployed several tricks to scaffold the illusion. 'Robinson Crusoe' was âwritten by himself,â according to the novelâs title page, which omitted Daniel Defoeâs name. Samuel Richardsonâs novel 'Pamela', an attempt to instruct in good conduct through entertainment, was written as a series of letters penned by the heroine. In his preface to the novel, which excluded his name altogether, Richardson included several real letters from friends to whom he had shown the manuscript, but he changed the salutation from âDear Authorâ to âDear Editorâ and even, writing under the guise of âeditor,â praised âPamelaâsâ letters. However, this was a lie, but not a hoax. Richardson wanted his novels to be read with \"Historical Faith\", since they contained, he believed, \"the truth of the possible- the truth of human nature\". Richardsonâs authorship was revealed shortly after Pamelaâs publication, but rather than serving time on Oprahâs couch, he was hailed as an innovator of the novelistic form.\n\nWhereas novels were unashamedly fake memoirs at their conception, our recent hoaxes suggest that the line between the genres, once drawn, cannot easily be erased. This is in no small part due to the Internetâs surveillance. All along, historians had raised questions about Misha Defonseca, who claimed to have survived the Holocaust by living with a pack of wolves, but the engine of her downfall was her former publisher Jane Danielâs blog. James Freyâs sine qua non of the fudged-memoir genre, A Million Little Pieces, was debunked by the website The Smoking Gun, which posted his actual arrest records and compared them to Freyâs embellished retellings. Deborah Lipstadt used her blog to gather evidence against Herman Rosenblatâs memoir.\n\nIf anything, you could argue that the fact-checkers are doing too good a job. There seems to be some risk that, in attempting to hold memoirs to journalistic standards of factuality, the watchdogs miss the forest for the trees, fixating on minor details in books whose general pictures are correct. The New York Times includes in its dossier against Matt McCarthy disputations by teammates who McCarthy alleges threatened children and made fun of Hispanics, as though their denials of having said such self-incriminating things were more trustworthy than McCarthyâs accusations. When Jose Canseco published his baseball memoirs Juiced and Vindicated, reviewers caviled over minor details and unsubstantiated claims, including that Alex Rodriguez had used steroids. Recent events have proven the gist of Cansecoâs memoirs largely correct.\n\nIndeed, it seems unlikely that, say, every claim in Casanovaâs The Story of My Life would hold up to such scrutiny. And yet, if we knew this were the case, would we excise it from the canon? Writersâ enormous talents can sometimes render moot questions of their worksâ factuality; our fraudsters, meanwhile, attempted to compensate for their meager talents by actually inhabiting their bloated fictions. They suffer not an excess of imagination, which can illuminate even the most mundane experiences, but a retreat from it. And yet simply because they lost their handles on the truth does not mean that the culture also has. Maybe the symptom of our age is not the fake memoirists themselves, but the catching of fake memoirists. In which case: Sound the church bells! The traitors are routed! The watchmen won!\n\nWhich of the following is a suitable title for the passage?\n\nHow to write a memoir\n\nThe age of literary fraud\n\nWho is afraid of fake memoirists\n\nWriting in the age of the internet\n\nWhich of the following is the author unlikely to agree with?\n\nThere isnât more literary fraud in our age. More fraud is coming to light due to the Internetâs surveillance.\n\nThe line dividing novels and fake memoirs was never clear.\n\nAs long as the main or essential part of a memoir is correct, it does not matter if lesser details do not stand up to verification.\n\nThere exists now a widespread, diseased culture of literary fraud.\n\nWith regard to the novel âPamelaâ, the author states that Richardsonâs artifice â was a lie, but not a hoaxâ. What does he mean?\n\nIt was an unintentional deception that contained the truth of human nature and was hence acceptable to readers.\n\nIt was just a ploy to capture the imagination of the readers with the truth of the possible.\n\nIt was a deception perpetrated simply to make money.\n\nIt was a mere prank, and did not generate public interest.\n\nThe word âverisimilitudeâ in the passage is farthest in meaning to\n\nabsurdity\n\nplausibility\n\nauthenticity\n\ncredibleness\n\nPassage 4 : CAT Reading Comprehension: Power in language\n\nConsidered amongst the greatest works of Western literature, the Iliad, paired with its sequel, the Odyssey, is attributed to Homer.\n\nHowever, that the author of the Iliad was not the same as the compiler of the fantastic tales in the Odyssey is arguable on several scores. The two epics belong to different literary types; the Iliad is essentially dramatic in its confrontation of opposing warriors who converse like the actors in Attic tragedy, while the Odyssey is cast as a novel narrated in more everyday human speech. In their physical structure, also, the two epics display an equally pronounced difference. The Odyssey is composed in six distinct cantos of four chapters (\"books\") each, whereas the Iliad moves unbrokenly forward with only one irrelevant episode in its tightly woven plot. Readers who examine psychological nuances see in the two works some distinctly different human responses and behavioral attitudes. For example, the Iliad voices admiration for the beauty and speed of horses, while the Odyssey shows no interest in these animals. The Iliad dismisses dogs as mere scavengers, while the poet of the Odyssey reveals a modern sentimental sympathy for Odysseus's faithful old hound, Argos.\n\nBut the most cogent argument for separating the two poems by assigning them to different authors is the archeological criterion of implied chronology. In the Iliad the Phoenicians are praised as skilled craftsmen working in metal and weavers of elaborate, much-prized garments. The shield which the metalworking god Hephaistos forges for Achilles in the Iliad seems inspired by the metal bowls with inlaid figures in action made by the Phoenicians and introduced by them into Greek and Etruscan commerce in the 8th century B.C. In contrast, in the Odyssey Greek sentiment toward the Phoenicians has undergone a drastic change. Although they are still regarded as clever craftsmen, in place of the Iliad's laudatory polydaidaloi (\"of manifold skills\") the epithet is parodied into polypaipaloi (\"of manifold scurvy tricksters\"), reflecting the competitive penetration into Greek commerce by traders from Phoenician Carthage in the 7th century B.C.\n\nOne thing, however, is certain: both epics were created without recourse to writing. Between the decline of Mycenaean and the emergence of classical Greek civilizationâwhich is to say, from the late 12th to the mid-8th century B.C.âthe inhabitants of the Greek lands had lost all knowledge of the syllabic script of their Mycenaean fore-bears and had not yet acquired from the easternmost shore of the Mediterranean that familiarity with Phoenician alphabetic writing from which classical Greek literacy (and in turn, Etruscan, Roman, and modern European literacy) derived. The same conclusion of illiterate composition may be reached from a critical inspection of the poems themselves. Among many races and in many different periods there has existed (and still exists sporadically) a form of purely oral and unwritten poetic speech, distinguishable from normal and printed literature by special traits that are readily recognizable and specifically distinctive. To this class the Homeric epics conform. Hence it would seem an inevitable inference that they must have been created either before the end of the 8th century B.C. or so shortly after that date that the use of alphabetic writing had not yet been developed sufficiently to record lengthy compositions. It is this illiterate environment that explains the absence of all contemporary historical record of the authors of the two great epics.\n\nIt is probable that Homer's name was applied to two distinct individuals differing in temperament and artistic accomplishment, born perhaps as much as a century apart, but practicing the same traditional craft of oral composition and recitation. Although each became known as \"Homer, \" it may be (as one ancient source asserts) that âhomros âwas a dialectal word for a blind man and so came to be used generically of the old and often sightless wandering reciters of heroic legends in the traditional meter of unrhymed dactylic hexameters. Thus there could have been many Homers. The two epics ascribed to Homer, however, have been as highly prized in modern as in ancient times for their marvelous vividness of expression, their keenness of personal characterization, their unflagging interest, whether in narration of action or in animated dramatic dialogue.\n\nWhich of the following cannot be reasonably inferred from the passage?\n\nBefore the 12th century BC , the use of syllabic writing existed in Ancient Greece.\n\nPhoenician traders flourished in Greece at the time the Homeric epics were composed.\n\nGreek, Roman and modern European literacy can be traced back to the Phoenicians.\n\nIliad and Odyssey are purely oral poetic speech, set to rhyme.\n\nWhich of the following can be characterized as the main idea of the passage?\n\nThere could have been many Homers, old and often sightless wandering reciters of heroic legends.\n\nAttributing the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey to one Homer is erroneous.\n\nBoth Iliad and Odyssey were created without recourse to writing.\n\nThe Iliad and the Odyssey are of distinct literary types, physical structure and style.\n\nThe term epithet as used in the passage is farthest in meaning to\n\nSobriquet\n\nMoniker\n\nNickname\n\nJargon\n\nThe following questions are from IPMAT Rohtak and Indore sample papers.

The long-term effects ofÂ Â concussions,however, are less understood and far more severe.Â\n\nRecent studies suggest that people whoÂ sufferÂ multiple concussions are at significant risk for developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), aÂ degenerative brain disorder that causes a variety of dangerous mental and emotional problems to ariseÂ weeks, months, or even years after the initial injury. These psychological problems can include depression,Â anxiety, memory loss, inability to concentrate, and aggression. In extreme cases, people suffering from CTEÂ have even committed suicide or homicide. The majority of people who developthese issues are athletesÂ who participate in popular high-impact sports, especially football. Although new sports regulations andÂ improvements in helmet technology can helpprotect players, amateur leagues, the sports media, and fans allÂ bear some of the responsibility for reducing the incidence of these devastating injuries.Improvements inÂ diagnostic technology have provided substantial evidence to link severe and often fatal psychologicalÂ disorders to the head injuries that players receive while on the field.Â\n\nRecent autopsies performed on theÂ brains of football players who have committed suicide have shown advancedÂ cases of CTE in every single victim.In response to the growing understanding of this danger, the NationalÂ Football League (NFL) has revised its safety regulations. Players who have suffered a head injury on theÂ field must undergo a concussionÂ sideline assessmenta series of mental and physical fitness tests before being allowed back in the game.\n\nIn an effort to diminish the amount of head and neck injuries on the field, NFL officials began enforcingÂ stricter penalty calls for helmet-to-helmet contact, leading with the head, and hitting a defenseless player.Â Furthermore, as of 2010, if a player's helmet is accidentally wrenched from his head during play, the ball isÂ immediately whistled dead. It is hoped that these new regulations, coupled with advances in helmet design,Â will reduce the number of concussions, and thus curb further cases of CTE. Efforts by the NFL and otherÂ professional sports leagues are certainly laudable; we should commend every attempt to protect the mentalÂ and physical health of players. However, new regulations at the professional level cannot protect amateurÂ players, especially young people.\n\nFatal cases of CTE have been reported in victims as young as 21. ProperÂ tackling form using the arms and shoulders to aim for a player's midsection should be taught at an earlyÂ age. Youth, high school, and college leagues should also adopt safety rules even more stringent than thoseÂ of the NFL. Furthermore, young athletes should be educated about the serious dangers of head injuries at anÂ early age. Perhaps the most important factor in reducing the number of traumatic brain injuries, however,Â lies not with the players, the coaches, or the administrators, but with the media and fans.Â\n\nSports mediaÂ producers have become accustomed to showcasing the most aggressive tackles and the most intenseÂ plays. NFL broadcasts often replay especially violent collisions while the commentators marvel at theÂ players physical prowess. Some sports highlights television programs even feature weekly countdowns ofÂ the hardest hits. When the media exalts such dangerous behavior, professionals are rewarded for injuringÂ each other on the field and amateurs become more likely to try to imitate their favorite NFL athletes.Â Announcers, commentators, television producers, and sportswriters should engage in a collective effort toÂ cease glorifying brutal plays. In turn, fans should stopexpecting their favorite players to put their lives onÂ Â the line for the purposes of entertainment. Players must not be encouraged to trade theirÂ careers, their health, their happiness, and even their lives for the sake of a game.\n\nIPMAT 2020 Sample Paper - IPM Rohtak Verbal Ability\n\nBased on information in the passage, it can be inferred that all of the following statements are trueÂ except\n\ntackling is not always dangerous; however, players who use improper tackling form may injure others\n\nscientists have established a definitive link between players who die untimely deaths and the onset of CTE\n\nNFL officials have done little to address the problem of CTE\n\nathletes who are praised for exceptionally brutal hits are likely to continue engaging in such dangerousÂ behavior\n\nChoice C\n\nNFL officials have done little to address the problem of CTE\n\nIPMAT 2020 Sample Paper - IPM Rohtak Verbal Ability\n\nAccording to the passage, which of the following factors contribute(s) to the incidence of CTE in\n\namateur players?\n\nI. inconsistent application of safety regulations for all levels\n\nII. lack of education about the dangers of head injuries\n\nIII. amateur players' desire to emulate professionals\n\nl only\n\nII only\n\nI and II only\n\nII and III only\n\nChoice C\n\nI and II only\n\nIPMAT 2020 Sample Paper - IPM Rohtak Verbal Ability\n\nAs used in paragraph 3, which is the best synonym for laudable?\n\npraiseworthy\n\nineffectual\n\nmemorable\n\naudacious\n\nIPMAT 2020 Sample Paper - IPM Rohtak Verbal Ability\n\nThe author's tone in the final paragraph can best be described as\n\nremorseful\n\nhopeless\n\nperplexed\n\ninsistent\n\nIPMAT 2020 Sample Paper - IPM Rohtak Verbal Ability\n\nAs used in the final paragraph, which is the best antonym for exalts?\n\nmitigates\n\nvenerates\n\nmollifies\n\nexpedites\n\nIPMAT 2020 Sample Paper - IPM Rohtak Verbal Ability\n\nIn describing the sports media, the author emphasizes its\n\nresponsibility\n\nentertainment value\n\nsenselessness\n\ndanger\n\nIPMAT 2020 Sample Paper - IPM Rohtak Verbal Ability\n\nIn the final paragraph, the author mentions sports highlights television programs as an example of how\n\nI. the media glorifies violence\n\nII. amateurs learn to mimic professional athletes\n\nIII. professional athletes gain approval\n\nI only\n\nII only\n\nI and II only\n\nII and III only\n\nPassage 7 : IPMAT Reading Comprehension\n\nRead the passage below and answer the questions that follow :\n\nThe ravages [of the storm] were terrible in America,Â Europe, and Asia.

But though their labours were thus naturally severed, that small group of shipwrecked men would understand well enough that the speediest progress was to be made by helping each other-not by opposing each other; and they would know that this help could only be properly given so long as they were frank and open in their relations, and the difficulties which each lay under properly explained to the rest. So that any appearance of secrecy or separateness in the actions of any of them would instantly, and justly, be looked upon with suspicion by the rest, as the sign of some selfish or foolish proceeding on the part of the individual. If, for instance, the scientific man were found to have gone out at night, unknown to the rest, to alter the sluices, the others would think, and in all probability rightly think, that he wanted to get the best supply of water to his own field; and if the shoemaker refused to show them where the bark grew which he made the sandals of, they would naturally think, and in all probability rightly think, that he didn't want them to see how much there was of it, and that he meant to ask from them more corn and potatoes in exchange for his sandals than the trouble of making them deserved. And thus, although each man would have a portion of time to himself in which he was allowed to do what he chose without let or inquiry - so long as he was working in that particular business which he had undertaken for the common benefit, any secrecy on his part would be immediately supposed to mean mischief; and would require to be accounted for, or put an end to: and this all the more because, whatever the work might be, certainly there would be difficulties about it which, when once they were well explained, might be more or less done away with by the help of the rest; so that assuredly every one of them would advance with his labour not only more happily, but more profitably and quickly, by having no secrets, and by frankly bestowing, and frankly receiving, such help as lay in his way to get or to give.Â\n\nIPMAT 2020 Question Paper - IPM Indore Verbal\n\nWhen a dozen men are cast away on an imaginary island, the best educated would look for metals in rocks because\n\nmetals can be used to make weapons.\n\nsuch an island probably has unexploited resources.\n\nhe may find it beneath him to dig or cut or make shoes.\n\nhe is suited for such work.\n\nChoice D\n\nhe is suited for such work.\n\nIPMAT 2020 Question Paper - IPM Indore Verbal\n\nThe author states that any appearance of secrecy or separateness would instantly and justly be looked upon with suspicion.

Stereotypes pertaining to male superiority and female submissiveness could be traced to earlier ages where assigned roles were needed as survival measures. But, can we today see a swing away from these stereotypes, or have they established a stranglehold on our perceptions? In this gendered world, we continue to live with notions that one's gender determines one's skills and preferences, from toys and colours to career choices. So the girl child will be presented with a Barbie doll, while the boy child will receive a Lego set.\n\nDoes that mean that our brains are different? This myth has been exploded by a British professor of cognitive neuroimaging. Her research attempts to establish how these stereotypes mould our ideas of ourselves. She examines how science has been misinterpreted or misused to ask the wrong questions, instead of challenging the status quo. She urges us to move beyond a binary view of people's brains and instead to see these as highly individualised, profoundly adaptable, and full of unbounded potential. Her conclusive findings establish that no brain differences can be found that are solely gender related. In other words, modern neuroscientists have identified no decisive category-defining differences between the brains of men and women.\n\nAs a result of these findings we owe it to ourselves to dump the myths and look at ourselves afresh. We need to recognise that the male and female brain debate is a distraction, besides being based on inaccuracies. It is possibly harmful too, because it can be used as a hook to justify saying there is no point in girls doing science because they do not have a science brain; or compelling boys to opt for science because their brains are shaped for that subject. It can also condemn boys for being emotional, as this is seen as a feminine trait. And, most dangerous of all, to proclaim that boys, not girls, are meant to lead.\n\nIPMAT 2020 Question Paper - IPM Indore Verbal\n\nThe research of a British professor of cognitive neuroimaging has succeeded in establishing that\n\nthe brains of men and women are alike.\n\nscience needs to challenge the status quo.\n\nsociety must break away from attempts at stereotyping gender issues.\n\nthe potential of a human brain is not directly linked to gender.\n\nChoice D\n\nthe potential of a human brain is not directly linked to gender.\n\nIPMAT 2020 Question Paper - IPM Indore Verbal\n\nBy referring to the world as \"gendered' the writer wants to convey that\n\ngender differences can be detected right from childhood.\n\nsociety continues to be fixated on gender stereotypes.\n\none's gender is bound to determine one's abilities.\n\nthe debate on gender differences will never be resolved.\n\nChoice B\n\nsociety continues to be fixated on gender stereotypes.\n\nIPMAT 2020 Question Paper - IPM Indore Verbal\n\nOne of the dangers in adopting a binary view of the human brain is that it can\n\npromote the notion of feminine and masculine traits.\n\ndetermine as well as limit academic choices.\n\nlead to the distortion and misinterpretation of scientific data.\n\nbe used to encourage male dominance and superiority.\n\nChoice A\n\npromote the notion of feminine and masculine traits.\n\nIPMAT 2020 Question Paper - IPM Indore Verbal\n\nThe writer of this passage wants to emphasise the need to\n\nuse new insights provided by scientific research for a better understanding of human abilities.\n\ncontinuously debate issues of gender differences to achieve human progress.\n\nquestion the findings of scientific inquiry into the functioning of the human brain.\n\naccept gender differences as essential to the survival of the human species.\n\nChoice A\n\nuse new insights provided by scientific research for a better understanding of human abilities.\n\nIPMAT 2020 Question Paper - IPM Indore Verbal\n\nThe synonym for 'stranglehold' (Para 1) is\n\nasphyxiation\n\ncontainment\n\nprohibiting entry\n\noverwhelming control\n\nIPMAT 2020 Question Paper - IPM Indore Verbal\n\nThe antonym for \"unbounded' (Para 2) is\n\nimprisoned\n\naggressive\n\nrestricted\n\nfearful\n\nThe Questions that follow, are from actual CAT papers.

Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\nMany human phenomena and characteristics â such as behaviors, beliefs, economies, genes, incomes, life expectancies, and other things â are influenced both by geographic factors and by non-geographic factors. Geographic factors mean physical and biological factors tied to geographic location, including climate, the distributions of wild plant and animal species, soils, and topography. Non-geographic factors include those factors subsumed under the term culture, other factors subsumed under the term history, and decisions by individual people. . . .\n\n[T]he differences between the current economies of North and South Korea . . . cannot be attributed to the modest environmental differences between [them] . . . They are instead due entirely to the different [government] policies . . . At the opposite extreme, the Inuit and other traditional peoples living north of the Arctic Circle developed warm fur clothes but no agriculture, while equatorial lowland peoples around the world never developed warm fur clothes but often did develop agriculture. The explanation is straightforwardly geographic, rather than a cultural or historical quirk unrelated to geography. . . . Aboriginal Australia remained the sole continent occupied only by hunter/gatherers and with no indigenous farming or herding . . . [Here the] explanation is biogeographic: the Australian continent has no domesticable native animal species and few domesticable native plant species. Instead, the crops and domestic animals that now make Australia a food and wool exporter are all non-native (mainly Eurasian) species such as sheep, wheat, and grapes, brought to Australia by overseas colonists.\n\nToday, no scholar would be silly enough to deny that culture, history, and individual choices play a big role in many human phenomena. Scholars don't react to cultural, historical, and individual-agent explanations by denouncing \"cultural determinism,\" \"historical determinism,\" or \"individual determinism,\" and then thinking no further. But many scholars do react to any explanation invoking some geographic role, by denouncing \"geographic determinism\" . . .\n\nSeveral reasons may underlie this widespread but nonsensical view. One reason is that some geographic explanations advanced a century ago were racist, thereby causing all geographic explanations to become tainted by racist associations in the minds of many scholars other than geographers. But many genetic, historical, psychological, and anthropological explanations advanced a century ago were also racist, yet the validity of newer non-racist genetic etc. explanations is widely accepted today.\n\nAnother reason for reflex rejection of geographic explanations is that historians have a tradition, in their discipline, of stressing the role of contingency (a favorite word among historians) based on individual decisions and chance. Often that view is warranted . . . But often, too, that view is unwarranted. The development of warm fur clothes among the Inuit living north of the Arctic Circle was not because one influential Inuit leader persuaded other Inuit in 1783 to adopt warm fur clothes, for no good environmental reason.\n\nA third reason is that geographic explanations usually depend on detailed technical facts of geography and other fields of scholarship . . . Most historians and economists don't acquire that detailed knowledge as part of the professional training.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nAll of the following can be inferred from the passage EXCEPT:\n\nagricultural practices changed drastically in the Australian continent after it was colonised.\n\nindividual dictat and contingency were not the causal factors for the use of fur clothing in some very cold climates.\n\nwhile most human phenomena result from culture and individual choice, some have bio-geographic origins.\n\nseveral academic studies of human phenomena in the past involved racist interpretations.\n\nChoice C\n\nwhile most human phenomena result from culture and individual choice, some have bio-geographic origins.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nAll of the following are advanced by the author as reasons why non-geographers disregard geographic influences on human phenomena EXCEPT their:\n\ndismissal of explanations that involve geographical causes for human behaviour.\n\nbelief in the central role of humans, unrelated to physical surroundings, in influencing phenomena.\n\nlingering impressions of past geographic analyses that were politically offensive.\n\ndisciplinary training which typically does not include technical knowledge of geography.\n\nChoice A\n\ndismissal of explanations that involve geographical causes for human behaviour.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nThe examples of the Inuit and Aboriginal Australians are offered in the passage to show:\n\nhow environmental factors lead to comparatively divergent paths in livelihoods and development.\n\nhuman resourcefulness across cultures in adapting to their surroundings.\n\nhow physical circumstances can dictate human behaviour and cultures.\n\nthat despite geographical isolation, traditional societies were self-sufficient and adaptive.\n\nChoice C\n\nhow physical circumstances can dictate human behaviour and cultures.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nThe author criticises scholars who are not geographers for all of the following reasons EXCEPT:\n\ntheir rejection of the role of biogeographic factors in social and cultural phenomena.\n\ntheir outdated interpretations of past cultural and historical phenomena.\n\ntheir labelling of geographic explanations as deterministic.\n\nthe importance they place on the role of individual decisions when studying human phenomena.\n\nChoice B\n\ntheir outdated interpretations of past cultural and historical phenomena.\n\nThe passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\nFor early postcolonial literature, the world of the novel was often the nation. Postcolonial novels were usually [concerned with] national questions. Sometimes the whole story of the novel was taken as an allegory of the nation, whether India or Tanzania. This was important for supporting anti-colonial nationalism, but could also be limiting â land-focused and inward-looking.\n\nMy new book \"Writing Ocean Worlds\" explores another kind of world of the novel: not the village or nation, but the Indian Ocean world. The book describes a set of novels in which the Indian Ocean is at the centre of the story. It focuses on the novelists Amitav Ghosh, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Lindsey Collen and Joseph Conrad [who have] centred the Indian Ocean world in the majority of their novels. . . . Their work reveals a world that is outward-looking â full of movement, border-crossing and south-south interconnection. They are all very different â from colonially inclined (Conrad) to radically anti-capitalist (Collen), but together draw on and shape a wider sense of Indian Ocean space through themes, images, metaphors and language. This has the effect of remapping the world in the reader's mind, as centred in the interconnected global south. . . .\n\nThe Indian Ocean world is a term used to describe the very long-lasting connections among the coasts of East Africa, the Arab coasts, and South and East Asia. These connections were made possible by the geography of the Indian Ocean. For much of history, travel by sea was much easier than by land, which meant that port cities very far apart were often more easily connected to each other than to much closer inland cities. Historical and archaeological evidence suggests that what we now call globalisation first appeared in the Indian Ocean. This is the interconnected oceanic world referenced and produced by the novels in my book. . . .\n\nFor their part Ghosh, Gurnah, Collen and even Conrad reference a different set of histories and geographies than the ones most commonly found in fiction in English. Those [commonly found ones] are mostly centred in Europe or the US, assume a background of Christianity and whiteness, and mention places like Paris and New York. The novels in [my] book highlight instead a largely Islamic space, feature characters of colour and centralise the ports of Malindi, Mombasa, Aden, Java and Bombay. . . . It is a densely imagined, richly sensory image of a southern cosmopolitan culture which provides for an enlarged sense of place in the world.\n\nThis remapping is particularly powerful for the representation of Africa. In the fiction, sailors and travellers are not all European. . . . African, as well as Indian and Arab characters, are traders, nakhodas (dhow ship captains), runaways, villains, missionaries and activists. This does not mean that Indian Ocean Africa is romanticised. Migration is often a matter of force; travel is portrayed as abandonment rather than adventure, freedoms are kept from women and slavery is rife. What it does mean is that the African part of the Indian Ocean world plays an active role in its long, rich history and therefore in that of the wider world.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nAll of the following claims contribute to the \"remapping\" discussed by the passage, EXCEPT:\n\nthe global south, as opposed to the global north, was the first centre of globalisation.\n\nthe world of early international trade and commerce was not the sole domain of white Europeans.\n\ncosmopolitanism originated in the West and travelled to the East through globalisation.\n\nIndian Ocean novels have gone beyond the specifics of national concerns to explore rich regional pasts.\n\nChoice C\n\ncosmopolitanism originated in the West and travelled to the East through globalisation.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nWhich one of the following statements is not true about migration in the Indian Ocean world?\n\nGeographical location rather than geographical proximity determined the choice of destination for migrants.\n\nThe Indian Ocean world's migration networks were shaped by religious and commercial histories of the region.\n\nThe Indian Ocean world's migration networks connected the global north with the global south.\n\nMigration in the Indian Ocean world was an ambivalent experience.\n\nChoice C\n\nThe Indian Ocean world's migration networks connected the global north with the global south.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nOn the basis of the nature of the relationship between the items in each pair below, choose the odd pair out:\n\nPostcolonial novels : Border-crossing\n\nPostcolonial novels : Anti-colonial nationalism\n\nIndian Ocean world : Slavery\n\nIndian Ocean novels : Outward-looking\n\nChoice A\n\nPostcolonial novels : Border-crossing\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nAll of the following statements, if true, would weaken the passage's claim about the relationship between mainstream English-language fiction and Indian Ocean novels EXCEPT:\n\nmost mainstream English-language novels have historically privileged the Christian, white, male experience of travel and adventure.\n\nthe depiction of Africa in most Indian Ocean novels is driven by an Orientalist imagination of its cultural crudeness.\n\nvery few mainstream English-language novels have historically been set in American and European metropolitan centres.\n\nthe depiction of Africa in most Indian Ocean novels is driven by a postcolonial nostalgia for an idyllic past.\n\nChoice A\n\nmost mainstream English-language novels have historically privileged the Christian, white, male experience of travel and adventure.\n\nThe passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\n[Fifty] years after its publication in English [in 1972], and just a year since [Marshall] Sahlins himself diedâwe may ask: why did [his essay] \"Original Affluent Society\" have such an impact, and how has it fared since? . . . Sahlins's principal argument was simple but counterintuitive: before being driven into marginal environments by colonial powers, hunter-gatherers, or foragers, were not engaged in a desperate struggle for meager survival. Quite the contrary, they satisfied their needs with far less work than people in agricultural and industrial societies, leaving them more time to use as they wished. Hunters, he quipped, keep bankers' hours. Refusing to maximize, many were \"more concerned with games of chance than with chances of game.\" . . . The so-called Neolithic Revolution, rather than improving life, imposed a harsher work regime and set in motion the long history of growing inequality . . .\n\nMoreover, foragers had other options. The contemporary Hadza of Tanzania, who had long been surrounded by farmers, knew they had alternatives and rejected them. To Sahlins, this showed that foragers are not simply examples of human diversity or victimhood but something more profound: they demonstrated that societies make real choices. Culture, a way of living oriented around a distinctive set of values, manifests a fundamental principle of collective self-determination. . . .\n\nBut the point [of the essay] is not so much the empirical validity of the dataâthe real interest for most readers, after all, is not in foragers either today or in the Paleolithicâbut rather its conceptual challenge to contemporary economic life and bourgeois individualism. The empirical served a philosophical and political project, a thought experiment and stimulus to the imagination of possibilities.\n\nWith its title's nod toward The Affluent Society (1958), economist John Kenneth Galbraith's famously skeptical portrait of America's postwar prosperity and inequality, and dripping with New Left contempt for consumerism, \"The Original Affluent Society\" brought this critical perspective to bear on the contemporary world. It did so through the classic anthropological move of showing that radical alternatives to the readers' lives really exist. If the capitalist world seeks wealth through ever greater material production to meet infinitely expansive desires, foraging societies follow \"the Zen road to affluence\": not by getting more, but by wanting less. If it seems that foragers have been left behind by \"progress,\" this is due only to the ethnocentric self-congratulation of the West. Rather than accumulate material goods, these societies are guided by other values: leisure, mobility, and above all, freedom. . . .\n\nViewed in today's context, of course, not every aspect of the essay has aged well. While acknowledging the violence of colonialism, racism, and dispossession, it does not thematize them as heavily as we might today. Rebuking evolutionary anthropologists for treating present-day foragers as \"left behind\" by progress, it too can succumb to the temptation to use them as proxies for the Paleolithic. Yet these characteristics should not distract us from appreciating Sahlins's effort to show that if we want to conjure new possibilities, we need to learn about actually inhabitable worlds.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nWe can infer that Sahlins's main goal in writing his essay was to:\n\nhighlight the fact that while we started off as a fairly contented egalitarian people, we have progressively degenerated into materialism.\n\nput forth the view that, despite egalitarian origins, economic progress brings greater inequality and social hierarchies.\n\nhold a mirror to an acquisitive society, with examples of other communities that have chosen successfully to be non-materialistic.\n\ncounter Galbraith's pessimistic view of the inevitability of a capitalist trajectory for economic growth.\n\nChoice C\n\nhold a mirror to an acquisitive society, with examples of other communities that have chosen successfully to be non-materialistic.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nThe author mentions Tanzania's Hadza community to illustrate:\n\nthat forager communities' lifestyles derived not from ignorance about alternatives, but from their own choice.\n\nhow two vastly different ways of living and working were able to coexist in proximity for centuries.\n\nhow pre-agrarian societies did not hamper the emergence of more advanced agrarian practices in contiguous communities.\n\nthat hunter-gatherer communities' subsistence-level techniques equipped them to survive well into contemporary times.\n\nChoice A\n\nthat forager communities' lifestyles derived not from ignorance about alternatives, but from their own choice.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nThe author of the passage criticises Sahlins's essay for its:\n\noutdated values regarding present-day foragers versus ancient foraging communities.\n\nfailure to supplement its thesis with robust empirical data.\n\ncritique of anthropologists who disparage the choices of foragers in today's society.\n\ncursory treatment of the effects of racism and colonialism on societies.\n\nChoice D\n\ncursory treatment of the effects of racism and colonialism on societies.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nThe author of the passage mentions Galbraith's \"The Affluent Society\" to:\n\ncontrast the materialist nature of contemporary growth paths with the pacifist content ways of living among the foragers.\n\ndocument the influence of Galbraith's cynical views on modern consumerism on Sahlins's analysis of pre-historic societies.\n\nshow how Galbraith's theories refute Sahlins's thesis on the contentment of pre-hunter-gatherer communities.\n\nshow how Sahlins's views complemented Galbraith's criticism of the consumerism and inequality of contemporary society.\n\nChoice D\n\nshow how Sahlins's views complemented Galbraith's criticism of the consumerism and inequality of contemporary society.\n\nThe passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\nRESIDENTS of LozÃ¨re, a hilly department in southern France, recite complaints familiar to many rural corners of Europe. In remote hamlets and villages, with names such as Le Bacon and Le Bacon Vieux, mayors grumble about a lack of local schools, jobs, or phone and internet connections. Farmers of grazing animals add another concern: the return of wolves. Eradicated from France last century, the predators are gradually creeping back to more forests and hillsides. \"The wolf must be taken in hand,\" said an aspiring parliamentarian, Francis Palombi, when pressed by voters in an election campaign early this summer. Tourists enjoy visiting a wolf park in LozÃ¨re, but farmers fret over their livestock and their livelihoods. . . .\n\nAs early as the ninth century, the royal office of the Lupariiâwolf-catchersâwas created in France to tackle the predators. Those official hunters (and others) completed their job in the 1930s, when the last wolf disappeared from the mainland. Active hunting and improved technology such as rifles in the 19th century, plus the use of poison such as strychnine later on, caused the population collapse. But in the early 1990s the animals reappeared. They crossed the Alps from Italy, upsetting sheep farmers on the French side of the border. Wolves have since spread to areas such as LozÃ¨re, delighting environmentalists, who see the predators' presence as a sign of wider ecological health. Farmers, who say the wolves cause the deaths of thousands of sheep and other grazing animals, are less cheerful. They grumble that green activists and politically correct urban types have allowed the return of an old enemy.\n\nVarious factors explain the changes of the past few decades. Rural depopulation is part of the story. In LozÃ¨re, for example, farming and a once-flourishing mining industry supported a population of over 140,000 residents in the mid-19th century. Today the department has fewer than 80,000 people, many in its towns. As humans withdraw, forests are expanding. In France, between 1990 and 2015, forest cover increased by an average of 102,000 hectares each year, as more fields were given over to trees. Now, nearly one-third of mainland France is covered by woodland of some sort. The decline of hunting as a sport also means more forests fall quiet. In the mid-to-late 20th century over 2m hunters regularly spent winter weekends tramping in woodland, seeking boars, birds and other prey. Today the FÃ©dÃ©ration Nationale des Chasseurs, the national body, claims 1.1m people hold hunting licences, though the number of active hunters is probably lower. The mostly protected status of the wolf in Europeâhunting them is now forbidden, other than when occasional culls are sanctioned by the stateâplus the efforts of NGOs to track and count the animals, also contribute to the recovery of wolf populations.\n\nAs the lupine population of Europe spreads westwards, with occasional reports of wolves seen closer to urban areas, expect to hear of more clashes between farmers and those who celebrate the predators' return. Farmers' losses are real, but are not the only economic story. Tourist venues, such as parks where wolves are kept and the animals' spread is discussed, also generate income and jobs in rural areas.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nThe inhabitants of LozÃ¨re have to grapple with all of the following problems, EXCEPT:\n\npoor rural communication infrastructure.\n\nlack of educational facilities.\n\ndecline in the number of hunting licences.\n\nlivestock losses.\n\nChoice C\n\ndecline in the number of hunting licences.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nWhich one of the following has NOT contributed to the growing wolf population in LozÃ¨re?\n\nThe granting of a protected status to wolves in Europe.\n\nThe shutting down of the royal office of the Luparii.\n\nAn increase in woodlands and forest cover in LozÃ¨re.\n\nA decline in the rural population of LozÃ¨re.\n\nChoice B\n\nThe shutting down of the royal office of the Luparii.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nThe author presents a possible economic solution to an existing issue facing LozÃ¨re that takes into account the divergent and competing interests of:\n\ntourists and environmentalists.\n\nenvironmentalists and politicians.\n\npoliticians and farmers.\n\nfarmers and environmentalists.\n\nChoice D\n\nfarmers and environmentalists.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 1 - VA RC\n\nWhich one of the following statements, if true, would weaken the author's claims?\n\nWolf attacks on tourists in LozÃ¨re are on the rise.\n\nHaving migrated out in the last century, wolves are now returning to LozÃ¨re.\n\nThe old mining sites of LozÃ¨re are now being used as grazing pastures for sheep.\n\nUnemployment concerns the residents of LozÃ¨re.\n\nChoice A\n\nWolf attacks on tourists in LozÃ¨re are on the rise.\n\nCAT VARC : CAT 2023 Question Paper Slot 2\n\nThe passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\nThe Second Hand September campaign, led by Oxfam . . . seeks to encourage shopping at local organisations and charities as alternatives to fast fashion brands such as Primark and Boohoo in the name of saving our planet. As innocent as mindless scrolling through online shops may seem, such consumers are unintentionallyâor perhaps even knowinglyâcontributing to an industry that uses more energy than aviation. . . .\n\nBrits buy more garments than any other country in Europe, so it comes as no shock that many of those clothes end up in UK landfills each year: 300,000 tonnes of them, to be exact. This waste of clothing is destructive to our planet, releasing greenhouse gasses as clothes are burnt as well as bleeding toxins and dyes into the surrounding soil and water. As ecologist Chelsea Rochman bluntly put it, \"The mismanagement of our waste has even come back to haunt us on our dinner plate.\"\n\nIt's not surprising, then, that people are scrambling for a solution, the most common of which is second-hand shopping. Retailers selling consigned clothing are currently expanding at a rapid rate . . . If everyone bought just one used item in a year, it would save 449 million lbs of waste, equivalent to the weight of 1 million Polar bears. \"Thrifting\" has increasingly become a trendy practice. London is home to many second-hand, or more commonly coined 'vintage', shops across the city from Bayswater to Brixton.\n\nSo you're cool and you care about the planet; you've killed two birds with one stone. But do people simply purchase a second-hand item, flash it on Instagram with #vintage and call it a day without considering whether what they are doing is actually effective?\n\nAccording to a study commissioned by Patagonia, for instance, older clothes shed more microfibres. These can end up in our rivers and seas after just one wash due to the worn material, thus contributing to microfibre pollution. To break it down, the amount of microfibres released by laundering 100,000 fleece jackets is equivalent to as many as 11,900 plastic grocery bags, and up to 40 per cent of that ends up in our oceans. . . . So where does this leave second-hand consumers? [They would be well advised to buy] high-quality items that shed less and last longer [as this] combats both microfibre pollution and excess garments ending up in landfills. . . .\n\nLuxury brands would rather not circulate their latest season stock around the globe to be sold at a cheaper price, which is why companies like ThredUP, a US fashion resale marketplace, have not yet caught on in the UK. There will always be a market for consignment but there is also a whole generation of people who have been taught that only buying new products is the norm; second-hand luxury goods are not in their psyche. Ben Whitaker, director at Liquidation Firm B-Stock, told Prospect that unless recycling becomes cost-effective and filters into mass production, with the right technology to partner it, \"high-end retailers would rather put brand before sustainability.\"\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nThe central idea of the passage would be undermined if:\n\nPrimark and Boohoo recycled their clothes for vintage stores.\n\ncustomers bought all their clothes online.\n\nsecond-hand stores sold only high-quality clothes.\n\nclothes were not thrown and burnt in landfills.\n\nChoice C\n\nsecond-hand stores sold only high-quality clothes.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nThe act of \"thrifting\", as described in the passage, can be considered ironic because it:\n\nhas created environmental problems.\n\nis an anti-consumerist attitude.\n\nis not cost-effective for retailers.\n\noffers luxury clothing at cut-rate prices.\n\nChoice A\n\nhas created environmental problems.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nBased on the passage, we can infer that the opposite of fast fashion, 'slow fashion', would most likely refer to clothes that:\n\ndo not shed microfibres.\n\nare of high quality and long lasting.\n\nare sold by genuine vintage stores.\n\ndo not bleed toxins and dyes.\n\nChoice B\n\nare of high quality and long lasting.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nAccording to the author, companies like ThredUP have not caught on in the UK for all of the following reasons EXCEPT that:\n\nrecycling is currently not financially attractive for luxury brands.\n\nluxury brands do not like their product to be devalued.\n\nthe British don't buy second-hand clothing.\n\nluxury brands want to maintain their brand image.\n\nChoice C\n\nthe British don't buy second-hand clothing.\n\nThe passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\nOver the past four centuries liberalism has been so successful that it has driven all its opponents off the battlefield. Now it is disintegrating, destroyed by a mix of hubris and internal contradictions, according to Patrick Deneen, a professor of politics at the University of Notre Dame. . . . Equality of opportunity has produced a new meritocratic aristocracy that has all the aloofness of the old aristocracy with none of its sense of noblesse oblige. Democracy has degenerated into a theatre of the absurd. And technological advances are reducing ever more areas of work into meaningless drudgery. \"The gap between liberalism's claims about itself and the lived reality of the citizenry\" is now so wide that \"the lie can no longer be accepted,\" Mr Deneen writes. What better proof of this than the vision of 1,000 private planes whisking their occupants to Davos to discuss the question of \"creating a shared future in a fragmented world\"? . . .\n\nDeneen does an impressive job of capturing the current mood of disillusionment, echoing left-wing complaints about rampant commercialism, right-wing complaints about narcissistic and bullying students, and general worries about atomisation and selfishness. But when he concludes that all this adds up to a failure of liberalism, is his argument convincing? . . . He argues that the essence of liberalism lies in freeing individuals from constraints. In fact, liberalism contains a wide range of intellectual traditions which provide different answers to the question of how to trade off the relative claims of rights and responsibilities, individual expression and social ties. . . . liberals experimented with a range of ideas from devolving power from the centre to creating national education systems.\n\nMr Deneen's fixation on the essence of liberalism leads to the second big problem of his book: his failure to recognise liberalism's ability to reform itself and address its internal problems. The late 19th century saw America suffering from many of the problems that are reappearing today, including the creation of a business aristocracy, the rise of vast companies, the corruption of politics and the sense that society was dividing into winners and losers. But a wide variety of reformers, working within the liberal tradition, tackled these problems head on. Theodore Roosevelt took on the trusts. Progressives cleaned up government corruption. University reformers modernised academic syllabuses and built ladders of opportunity. Rather than dying, liberalism reformed itself.\n\nMr Deneen is right to point out that the record of liberalism in recent years has been dismal. He is also right to assert that the world has much to learn from the premodern notions of liberty as self-mastery and self-denial. The biggest enemy of liberalism is not so much atomisation but old-fashioned greed, as members of the Davos elite pile their plates ever higher with perks and share options. But he is wrong to argue that the only way for people to liberate themselves from the contradictions of liberalism is \"liberation from liberalism itself\". The best way to read \"Why Liberalism Failed\" is not as a funeral oration but as a call to action: up your game, or else.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nThe author of the passage faults Deneen's conclusions for all of the following reasons, EXCEPT:\n\nits repeated harking back to premodern notions of liberty.\n\nits failure to note historical instances in which the process of declining liberalism has managed to reverse itself.\n\nits very narrow definition of liberalism limited to individual freedoms.\n\nits extreme pessimism about the future of liberalism today and predictions of an ultimate decline.\n\nChoice A\n\nits repeated harking back to premodern notions of liberty.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nThe author of the passage is likely to disagree with all of the following statements, EXCEPT:\n\nthe essence of liberalism lies in greater individual self-expression and freedoms.\n\nliberalism was the dominant ideal in the past century, but it had to reform itself to remain so.\n\nclaims about liberalism's disintegration are exaggerated and misunderstand its core features.\n\nif we accept that liberalism is a dying ideal, we must work to find a viable substitute.\n\nChoice B\n\nliberalism was the dominant ideal in the past century, but it had to reform itself to remain so.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nAll of the following statements are evidence of the decline of liberalism today, EXCEPT:\n\n\". . . the creation of a business aristocracy, the rise of vast companies . . .\"\n\n\"And technological advances are reducing ever more areas of work into meaningless drudgery.\"\n\n\"Democracy has degenerated into a theatre of the absurd.\"\n\n\"'The gap between liberalism's claims about itself and the lived reality of the citizenry' is now so wide that 'the lie can no longer be accepted,'. . .\"\n\nChoice B\n\n\"And technological advances are reducing ever more areas of work into meaningless drudgery.\"\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nThe author of the passage refers to \"the Davos elite\" to illustrate his views on:\n\nthe way the debate around liberalism has been captured by the rich who have managed to insulate themselves from economic hardships.\n\nthe fact that the rise in liberalism had led to a greater interest in shared futures from unlikely social classes.\n\nthe unlikelihood of a return to the liberalism of the past as long as the rich continue to benefit from the decline in liberal values.\n\nthe hypocrisy of the liberal rich, who profess to subscribe to liberal values while cornering most of the wealth.\n\nChoice D\n\nthe hypocrisy of the liberal rich, who profess to subscribe to liberal values while cornering most of the wealth.\n\nThe passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\nThe Positivists, anxious to stake out their claim for history as a science, contributed the weight of their influence to the cult of facts. First ascertain the facts, said the positivists, then draw your conclusions from them. . . . This is what may [be] called the common-sense view of history. History consists of a corpus of ascertained facts. The facts are available to the historian in documents, inscriptions, and so on . . . [Sir George Clark] contrasted the \"hard core of facts\" in history with the surrounding pulp of disputable interpretation forgetting perhaps that the pulpy part of the fruit is more rewarding than the hard core. . . . It recalls the favourite dictum of the great liberal journalist C. P. Scott: \"Facts are sacred, opinion is free.\". . .\n\nWhat is a historical fact? . . . According to the common-sense view, there are certain basic facts which are the same for all historians and which form, so to speak, the backbone of historyâthe fact, for example, that the Battle of Hastings was fought in 1066. But this view calls for two observations. In the first place, it is not with facts like these that the historian is primarily concerned. It is no doubt important to know that the great battle was fought in 1066 and not in 1065 or 1067, and that it was fought at Hastings and not at Eastbourne or Brighton. The historian must not get these things wrong. But [to] praise a historian for his accuracy is like praising an architect for using well-seasoned timber or properly mixed concrete in his building. It is a necessary condition of his work, but not his essential function. It is precisely for matters of this kind that the historian is entitled to rely on what have been called the \"auxiliary sciences\" of historyâarchaeology, epigraphy, numismatics, chronology, and so forth. . . .\n\nThe second observation is that the necessity to establish these basic facts rests not on any quality in the facts themselves, but on an apriori decision of the historian. In spite of C. P. Scott's motto, every journalist knows today that the most effective way to influence opinion is by the selection and arrangement of the appropriate facts. It used to be said that facts speak for themselves. This is, of course, untrue. The facts speak only when the historian calls on them: it is he who decides to which facts to give the floor, and in what order or context. . . . The only reason why we are interested to know that the battle was fought at Hastings in 1066 is that historians regard it as a major historical event. . . . Professor Talcott Parsons once called [science] \"a selective system of cognitive orientations to reality.\" It might perhaps have been put more simply. But history is, among other things, that. The historian is necessarily selective. The belief in a hard core of historical facts existing objectively and independently of the interpretation of the historian is a preposterous fallacy, but one which it is very hard to eradicate.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nAll of the following, if true, can weaken the passage's claim that facts do not speak for themselves, EXCEPT:\n\nthe truth value of a fact is independent of the historian who expresses it.\n\nfacts, like truth, can be relative: what is fact for person X may not be so for person Y.\n\na fact, by its very nature, is objective and universal, irrespective of the context in which it is placed.\n\nthe order in which a series of facts is presented does not have any bearing on the production of meaning.\n\nChoice B\n\nfacts, like truth, can be relative: what is fact for person X may not be so for person Y.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nIf the author of the passage were to write a book on the Battle of Hastings along the lines of his/her own reasoning, the focus of the historical account would be on:\n\nderiving historical facts from the relevant documents and inscriptions.\n\nproviding a nuanced interpretation by relying on the auxiliary sciences.\n\nexploring the socio-political and economic factors that led to the Battle.\n\nproducing a detailed timeline of the various events that led to the Battle.\n\nChoice C\n\nexploring the socio-political and economic factors that led to the Battle.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nAccording to this passage, which one of the following statements best describes the significance of archaeology for historians?\n\nArchaeology helps historians to carry out their primary duty.\n\nArchaeology helps historians to interpret historical facts.\n\nArchaeology helps historians to ascertain factual accuracy.\n\nArchaeology helps historians to locate the oldest civilisations in history.\n\nChoice C\n\nArchaeology helps historians to ascertain factual accuracy.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nAll of the following describe the \"common-sense view\" of history, EXCEPT:\n\nhistory is like science: a selective system of cognitive orientations to reality.\n\nonly the positivist methods can lead to credible historical knowledge.\n\nhistory can be objective like the sciences if it is derived from historical facts.\n\nreal history can be found in ancient engravings and archival documents.\n\nChoice A\n\nhistory is like science: a selective system of cognitive orientations to reality.\n\nThe passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\nUmberto Eco, an Italian writer, was right when he said the language of Europe is translation. Netflix and other deep-pocketed global firms speak it well. Just as the EU employs a small army of translators and interpreters to turn intricate laws or impassioned speeches of Romanian MEPs into the EU's 24 official languages, so do the likes of Netflix. It now offers dubbing in 34 languages and subtitling in a few more. . . .\n\nThe economics of European productions are more appealing, too. American audiences are more willing than before to give dubbed or subtitled viewing a chance. This means shows such as \"Lupin\", a French crime caper on Netflix, can become global hits. . . . In 2015, about 75% of Netflix's original content was American; now the figure is half, according to Ampere, a media-analysis company. Netflix has about 100 productions under way in Europe, which is more than big public broadcasters in France or Germany. . . .\n\nNot everything works across borders. Comedy sometimes struggles. Whodunits and bloodthirsty maelstroms between arch Romans and uppity tribesmen have a more universal appeal. Some do it better than others. Barbarians aside, German television is not always built for export, says one executive, being polite. A bigger problem is that national broadcasters still dominate. Streaming services, such as Netflix or Disney+, account for about a third of all viewing hours, even in markets where they are well-established. Europe is an ageing continent. The generation of teens staring at phones is outnumbered by their elders who prefer to gawp at the box.\n\nIn Brussels and national capitals, the prospect of Netflix as a cultural hegemon is seen as a threat. \"Cultural sovereignty\" is the watchword of European executives worried that the Americans will eat their lunch. To be fair, Netflix content sometimes seems stuck in an uncanny valley somewhere in the mid-Atlantic, with local quirks stripped out. Netflix originals tend to have fewer specific cultural references than shows produced by domestic rivals, according to Enders, a market analyst. The company used to have an imperial model of commissioning, with executives in Los Angeles cooking up ideas French people might like. Now Netflix has offices across Europe. But ultimately the big decisions rest with American executives. This makes European politicians nervous.\n\nThey should not be. An irony of European integration is that it is often American companies that facilitate it. Google Translate makes European newspapers comprehensible, even if a little clunky, for the continent's non-polyglots. American social-media companies make it easier for Europeans to talk politics across borders. (That they do not always like to hear what they say about each other is another matter.) Now Netflix and friends pump the same content into homes across a continent, making culture a cross-border endeavour, too. If Europeans are to share a currency, bail each other out in times of financial need and share vaccines in a pandemic, then they need to have something in commonâeven if it is just bingeing on the same series. Watching fictitious northern and southern Europeans tear each other apart 2,000 years ago beats doing so in reality.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nBased on information provided in the passage, all of the following are true, EXCEPT:\n\nEuropean television productions have the potential to become global hits.\n\nonly half of Netflix's original programming in the EU is now produced in America.\n\nnational broadcasters dominate in the EU in terms of total television viewing hours.\n\nNetflix has been able to transform itself into a truly European entity.\n\nChoice D\n\nNetflix has been able to transform itself into a truly European entity.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nThe author sees the rise of Netflix in Europe as:\n\na unifying force.\n\na looming cultural threat.\n\nfilling an entertainment gap.\n\nan economic threat.\n\nChoice A\n\na unifying force.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nWhich one of the following research findings would weaken the author's conclusion in the final paragraph?\n\nResearch shows that Netflix has been gradually losing market share to other streaming television service providers.\n\nResearch shows there is a wide variance in the popularity and viewing of Netflix shows across different EU countries.\n\nResearch shows that older women across the EU enjoy watching romantic comedies on Netflix, whereas younger women prefer historical fiction dramas.\n\nResearch shows that Netflix hits produced in France are very popular with North American audiences.\n\nChoice B\n\nResearch shows there is a wide variance in the popularity and viewing of Netflix shows across different EU countries.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 2 - VA RC\n\nBased only on information provided in the passage, which one of the following hypothetical Netflix shows would be most successful with audiences across the EU?\n\nA trans-Atlantic romantic drama set in Europe and America.\n\nAn original German TV science fiction production.\n\nA murder mystery drama set in North Africa and France.\n\nAn Italian comedy show hosted by an international star.\n\nChoice C\n\nA murder mystery drama set in North Africa and France.\n\nCAT VARC : CAT 2023 Question Paper Slot 3\n\nThe passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\nThe biggest challenge [The Nutmeg's Curse by Ghosh] throws down is to the prevailing understanding of when the climate crisis started. Most of us have accepted . . . that it started with the widespread use of coal at the beginning of the Industrial Age in the 18th century and worsened with the mass adoption of oil and natural gas in the 20th. Ghosh takes this history at least three centuries back, to the start of European colonialism in the 15th century. He [starts] the book with a 1621 massacre by Dutch invaders determined to impose a monopoly on nutmeg cultivation and trade in the Banda islands in today's Indonesia. Not only do the Dutch systematically depopulate the islands through genocide, they also try their best to bring nutmeg cultivation into plantation mode. These are the two points to which Ghosh returns through examples from around the world. One, how European colonialists decimated not only indigenous populations but also indigenous understanding of the relationship between humans and Earth. Two, how this was an invasion not only of humans but of the Earth itself, and how this continues to the present day by looking at nature as a 'resource' to exploit. . . . We know we are facing more frequent and more severe heatwaves, storms, floods, droughts and wildfires due to climate change. We know our expansion through deforestation, dam building, canal cutting â in short, terraforming, the word Ghosh uses â has brought us repeated disasters . . . Are these the responses of an angry Gaia who has finally had enough? By using the word 'curse' in the title, the author makes it clear that he thinks so. I use the pronoun 'who' knowingly, because Ghosh has quoted many non-European sources to enquire into the relationship between humans and the world around them so that he can question the prevalent way of looking at Earth as an inert object to be exploited to the maximum. As Ghosh's text, notes and bibliography show once more, none of this is new. There have always been challenges to the way European colonialists looked at other civilisations and at Earth. It is just that the invaders and their myriad backers in the fields of economics, politics, anthropology, philosophy, literature, technology, physics, chemistry, biology have dominated global intellectual discourse. . . . There are other points of view that we can hear today if we listen hard enough. Those observing global climate negotiations know about the Latin American way of looking at Earth as Pachamama (Earth Mother). They also know how such a framing is just provided lip service and is ignored in the substantive portions of the negotiations. In The Nutmeg's Curse, Ghosh explains why. He shows the extent of the vested interest in the oil economy â not only for oil-exporting countries, but also for a superpower like the US that controls oil drilling, oil prices and oil movement around the world. Many of us know power utilities are sabotaging decentralised solar power generation today because it hits their revenues and control. And how the other points of view are so often drowned out.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 3 - VA RC\n\nOn the basis of information in the passage, which one of the following is NOT a reason for the failure of policies seeking to address climate change?\n\nThe greed of organisations benefiting from non-renewable energy resources.\n\nThe marginalised status of non-European ways of looking at nature and the environment.\n\nThe decentralised characteristic of renewable energy resources like solar power.\n\nThe global dominance of oil economies and international politics built around it.\n\nChoice C\n\nThe decentralised characteristic of renewable energy resources like solar power.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 3 - VA RC\n\nWhich one of the following best explains the primary purpose of the discussion of the colonisation of the Banda islands in \"The Nutmeg's Curse\"?\n\nTo illustrate how systemic violence against the colonised constituted the cornerstone of colonialism.\n\nTo illustrate the first instance in history when the processes responsible for climate change were initiated.\n\nTo illustrate the role played by the cultivation of certain crops in the plantation mode in contributing to climate change.\n\nTo illustrate how colonialism represented and perpetuated the mindset that has led to climate change.\n\nChoice D\n\nTo illustrate how colonialism represented and perpetuated the mindset that has led to climate change.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 3 - VA RC\n\nAll of the following can be inferred from the reviewer's discussion of \"The Nutmeg's Curse\", EXCEPT:\n\nacademic discourses have always served the function of raising awareness about environmental preservation.\n\nenvironmental preservation policy makers can learn a lot from non-European and/or pre-colonial societies.\n\nthe contemporary dominant perception of nature and the environment was put in place by processes of colonialism.\n\nthe history of climate change is deeply intertwined with the history of colonialism.\n\nChoice A\n\nacademic discourses have always served the function of raising awareness about environmental preservation.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 3 - VA RC\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, would make the reviewer's choice of the pronoun \"who\" for Gaia inappropriate?\n\nModern western science discovers new evidence for the Earth being an inanimate object.\n\nGhosh's book has a different title: \"The Nutmeg's Revenge\".\n\nNon-European societies have perceived the Earth as a non-living source of all resources.\n\nThere is a direct causeâeffect relationship between human activities and global climate change.\n\nChoice C\n\nNon-European societies have perceived the Earth as a non-living source of all resources.\n\nThe passage below is accompanied by four questions. Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\nSteven Pinker's new book, \"Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters,\" offers a pragmatic dose of measured optimism, presenting rationality as a fragile but achievable ideal in personal and civic life. . . . Pinker's ambition to illuminate such a crucial topic offers the welcome prospect of a return to sanity. . . . It's no small achievement to make formal logic, game theory, statistics and Bayesian reasoning delightful topics full of charm and relevance.\n\nIt's also plausible to believe that a wider application of the rational tools he analyzes would improve the world in important ways. His primer on statistics and scientific uncertainty is particularly timely and should be required reading before consuming any news about the [COVID] pandemic. More broadly, he argues that less media coverage of shocking but vanishingly rare events, from shark attacks to adverse vaccine reactions, would help prevent dangerous overreactions, fatalism and the diversion of finite resources away from solvable but less-dramatic issues, like malnutrition in the developing world.\n\nIt's a reasonable critique, and Pinker is not the first to make it. But analyzing the political economy of journalism â its funding structures, ownership concentration and increasing reliance on social media shares â would have given a fuller picture of why so much coverage is so misguided and what we might do about it.\n\nPinker's main focus is the sort of conscious, sequential reasoning that can track the steps in a geometric proof or an argument in formal logic. Skill in this domain maps directly onto the navigation of many real-world problems, and Pinker shows how greater mastery of the tools of rationality can improve decision-making in medical, legal, financial and many other contexts in which we must act on uncertain and shifting information. . . .\n\nDespite the undeniable power of the sort of rationality he describes, many of the deepest insights in the history of science, math, music and art strike their originators in moments of epiphany. From the 19th-century chemist Friedrich August KekulÃ©'s discovery of the structure of benzene to any of Mozart's symphonies, much extraordinary human achievement is not a product of conscious, sequential reasoning. Even Plato's Socrates â who anticipated many of Pinker's points by nearly 2,500 years, showing the virtue of knowing what you do not know and examining all premises in arguments, not simply trusting speakers' authority or charisma â attributed many of his most profound insights to dreams and visions. Conscious reasoning is helpful in sorting the wheat from the chaff, but it would be interesting to consider the hidden aquifers that make much of the grain grow in the first place.\n\nThe role of moral and ethical education in promoting rational behavior is also underexplored. Pinker recognizes that rationality \"is not just a cognitive virtue but a moral one.\" But this profoundly important point, one subtly explored by ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, doesn't really get developed. This is a shame, since possessing the right sort of moral character is arguably a precondition for using rationality in beneficial ways.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 3 - VA RC\n\nThe author refers to the ancient Greek philosophers to:\n\nindicate the various similarities between their thinking and Pinker's conclusions.\n\nreveal gaps in Pinker's discussion of the importance of ethical considerations in rational behaviour.\n\nshow how dreams and visions have for centuries influenced subconscious behaviour and pathbreaking inventions.\n\nhighlight the influence of their thinking on the development of Pinker's arguments.\n\nChoice B\n\nreveal gaps in Pinker's discussion of the importance of ethical considerations in rational behaviour.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 3 - VA RC\n\nThe author mentions KekulÃ©'s discovery of the structure of benzene and Mozart's symphonies to illustrate the point that:\n\ngreat innovations across various fields can stem from flashes of intuition and are not always propelled by logical thinking.\n\nunlike the sciences, human achievements in other fields are a mix of logical reasoning and spontaneous epiphanies.\n\nPinker's conclusions on sequential reasoning are belied by European achievements which, in the past, were more rooted in unconscious bursts of genius.\n\nit is not just the creative arts, but also scientific fields that have benefitted from flashes of creativity.\n\nChoice A\n\ngreat innovations across various fields can stem from flashes of intuition and are not always propelled by logical thinking.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 3 - VA RC\n\nAccording to the author, for Pinker as well as the ancient Greek philosophers, rational thinking involves all of the following EXCEPT:\n\nthe belief that the ability to reason logically encompasses an ethical and moral dimension.\n\nan awareness of underlying assumptions in an argument and gaps in one's own knowledge.\n\nthe primacy of conscious sequential reasoning as the basis for seminal human achievements.\n\narriving at independent conclusions irrespective of who is presenting the argument.\n\nChoice C\n\nthe primacy of conscious sequential reasoning as the basis for seminal human achievements.\n\nCAT 2023 Slot 3 - VA RC\n\nThe author endorses Pinker's views on the importance of logical reasoning as it:\n\nequips people with the ability to tackle challenging practical problems.\n\nfocuses public attention on real issues like development rather than sensational events.\n\nprovides a moral compass for resolving important ethical dilemmas.\n\nhelps people to gain expertise in statistics and other scientific disciplines.\n\nChoice A\n\nequips people with the ability to tackle challenging practical problems.\n\nThe passage below is accompanied by four questions.
