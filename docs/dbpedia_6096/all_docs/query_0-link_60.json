        "text": "Some of the best travel films are based on a true story and Into the Wild, which follows the Alaskan adventure and ultimate demise of Christopher 'Alexander Supertramp' McCandless. Sean Penn's take follows McCandless, played by Emile Hirsch, kayaking the Colorado River, summiting snowy peaks, and embodying unchecked wanderlust. It's adventure travel at its best and most reckless, which of course makes for a great film.\n\nStream it on NOW TV\n\nWhen it was released in 2008, this sunny tribute to ABBA was the most successful movie musical ever. But the onslaught of Scandi pop from Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep is somehow less central to the film’s success than its location. It’s set on the fictional Greek island of Kalokairi, and the cast and crew set up in the Sporades island of Skopelos. Amanda Seyfried (Sophie) and Dominic Cooper (Sky) romp about in unspoiled Mediterranean coves such as Kastani Beach. In bad news for fans making the pilgrimage to the island, though, the jetty – where we see Sky’s stag-do mates memorably dance in flippers – was temporarily added for the film. Perhaps most striking is Agios Ioannis, where Sophie and Sky are due to be married. This dinky church sits precariously above a 100-metre cliff face in the north of the island, with 202 steps leading to the summit. Sarah James\n\nStream on Netflix\n\nWhere was Mamma Mia! filmed in Greece?\n\nThe 2020 Netflix adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier’s Gothic classic Rebecca travelled all across England to recreate Manderley, arguably the most famous fictional house ever dreamt up. The vast Cornish estate belonging to Maxim de Winter (Armie Hammer) is said to be one of the most beautiful properties in the country – but in real life, the crew took elements of several locations to create a composite of this impressive mansion. The exterior was shot at 17th-century Cranborne Manor in Dorset, while most of the interior was filmed at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire (also used in The Favourite and The Crown). Back in Dorset, Mapperton House’s 15 acres of gardens stand in as Manderley’s grounds. Away from Manderley, we see Lily James (Mrs de Winter) and Armie Hammer strolling the wild Cornish coast, actually filmed in Devon’s Hartland Quay. And further afield, Monaco’s Jardin Exotique and the Belle Epoque Ancien Hôtel Régina in Nice also make star appearances. Sarah James\n\nStream on Netflix\n\nWhere was Rebecca filmed? A locations guide\n\nWhile its predecessor made use of a thriving Greek isle for its sunny location shots, the sequel – filmed a whole decade later – moved the production to a sleepy Croatian outlet, Vis. This rugged 35 square-mile island, one and a half hours from mainland Croatia, was home to the cast and crew for six weeks. Lily James, who plays a young Donna (played by Meryl Streep in later life) strolls around Srebrna Bay with her lover Sam (Jeremy Irvine), while Vis harbour also stars. Kalokairi’s famous jetty from the first film appears again in the sequel, this time set up on the western tip of the island, Barjaci. Greek food was even imported to the island, to add to the all-important authenticity. Sarah James\n\nStream on Netflix\n\nWhere 'Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again' was filmed\n\nThree brothers head across Rajasthan by train, truck and scooter in a film that feels it’s in perpetual motion; a flick-book of vividly coloured paintings of Hindu gods, and people in their multitudinous safas and ghagra cholis. Even the dust of the Rajasthani plains looks infused with pale saffron – in one scene the sand almost seems to be aflame, while the soundtrack plays Debussy’s ‘Clair de lune’: moon and fire combined. Ice and heat. The best scenes, on a cross-country train, take place in an antiquated, super-florid luxury dining car that seems fantastical but might very well be an immaculate reconstruction of the real thing. Anybody who’s been to this part of India knows it’s more than possible. Chandeliers hugger-mugger with those intricate paintings of princes hunting gazelles or Shiva bringing the Ganges down from heaven or Vishnu Vaikuntha defeating the king of Kangra. All the while, carriage windows flash past camels and scared cows, parakeets, doves and crows, old tombs and thorn scrub and the ruins of temples, to the rattle of Raj-era cutlery and the boiling of perpetual chai.\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nDirector Alfonso Cuarón has a thing about beaches – they represent liberty and potency to him. His adored 2001 road movie Y Tu Mamá También, about two randy teenagers heading down Mexico’s southern coast, shows a beach so analgesically romantic it’s since become a very specific and celebrated destination for fans (Bahías de Huatulco, about 70 miles east of Puerto Escondido, in case you’re interested). In the movie, that cove with sand like cool velvet looks like a defining image of excitement tinged with vital regret. All summers must end. The director’s autobiographical mega-hit Roma is mostly set in Seventies Mexico City, where he was raised, and the scenes when the family at the centre of the story head to the beaches at Tuxpan for a holiday completely knocks our heads off. Huge breakers, salt and wind, children’s voices bouncing hard across the water, enlivening both the family on screen and the audience. Beaches: beautiful and dangerous. In full view of your loved ones you can be eaten by a shark. Or drown. Get swept away. When I interviewed Cuarón a couple of years ago and mentioned the beaches in his films, he hooted and nodded. And said there was nothing in his childhood like that thrilling, nervy sensation of leaving Mexico City and heading towards the sea: ‘I longed for those moments.’\n\nStream on Netflix\n\nWhere was Roma filmed?\n\nOn the subject of beaches, if there are better seaside scenes in a recent movie than the ones shot along Crane Beach in Massachusetts for Greta Gerwig’s cherished new adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel, I’d like to see them. The rest of the film centres mostly on the house of the March family: a near-cloying mirage of heritage clapboard, open fires, American quilts, dried-flower swags, lanterns in the snow, Christmas feasts, Marmee hurrying forth with still-warm bread in a wicker basket. But when the girls head to Crane Beach for a picnic one spring day, the camera tracks the grass-fringed dunes and waters of one of north-east America’s most spectacular shores, studded with rare piping plovers – just outside the town of Ipswich and along towards the Essex River Estuary and salt marshes. Suddenly the film gulps in fresh air. Laurie flirts madly with an oblivious Jo all along the water’s edge as the sun throws armfuls of pure light across white sand out from the screen right across us.\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nWhere is the new 'Little Women' filmed?\n\nTarantino’s lauded love letter to late-Sixties LA, and a semi-fantasy version of the city, now (natch) a popular bus tour all of its own. The seductive and enthralling locations are countless – the 1938 Aquarius Theatre, the Puerco Canyon in Malibu, Casa Vega on Ventura Boulevard... How well Tarantino captures the sense of the sprawling movie lots, the vacant extras, the catering trucks, the everyday strangeness of it all. The tone of the movie is phenomenal, capturing not just a fascinating place in time but a newly famous, and doomed, woman in that specific place in time: Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), filmed bowling down the freeway in her convertible, or watching herself in a movie in amazement, or just dancing and laughing at a party in a modernist bohemian enclave of the Hollywood Hills (away from ‘the tired old men and tired old money,’ as Raymond Chandler once put it to describe other Californian neighbourhoods). A woman at the high point of her happiness. ‘Good air, and a view of the mountains,’ Chandler also declared, was the best LA (ie, life) could offer. What more could any of us want?\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood locations – the LA filming spots\n\nStream on Now TV\n\n‘This way of life ain’t long for this world…’ A story set today but with a woozy, antique feel – from its opening moments you suspect it’s a remake of a much older movie (it’s not). Or at least inspired by something written by Mark Twain, especially when one of the characters turns out to be called Tom Blankenship, the name of Twain’s childhood friend and the real-life Huckleberry Finn. The characters live along the Mississippi in wooden houseboats that crouch low along the water, hand to mouth, fishing for crawfish and mussels, and occasionally bringing up pearls. Two kind children meet Mud, an unfrightening convict hiding out on an uninhabited island in the river – Matthew McConaughey, the most handsome of Magwitch types, despite being drenched in perpetual sweat and wearing unlovely dentures. It’s filmed in the Arkansas Delta Lowlands and an island outside Eudora, and the Mississippi itself is ever-present, verdant and varied. Mystical, historical, aesthetic. Sometimes big as a sea, other times full of winding creeks and inlets edged in low-slung trees and the soft furze of mossy stones. In one scene in the morning, a dreamlike mist hovers and a snake curls through the water, geese languidly flying in a crescent overhead. You want to enter the frame as the river’s slow green flow crinkles in the occasional breeze.\n\nStream on Amazon/Google\n\nTeenage Elio falls for handsome doctoral student Oliver, who’s spending the summer with his family. It’s not that the Italian town and its surrounds here – Crema, in Lombardy – is devastatingly gorgeous. Or that the villa where it’s set is headturningly historic. Or any of the too-unctuous things that usually oversell locations in movies: it’s the weirdly accurate sense of time and milieu that it grasps. Of being just ‘somewhere in Italy’, in 1983, seeing out the summer. The cardboardy towels. The wrong-sized bike. Nesquik on the breakfast table. Plates of over-bruised cherries. The endless cigarettes, and clanging of church bells. You’ve been to that town during an unreliably warm July. You’ve sat in a Fiat picking at the door-catch. Endured evenings in the living room while someone has a go on the piano and others watch telly. Gone to bed early, listless. Had a cold swim in a local river. Crushed on the exchange student’s middle brother. And even though it’s a film about love and passionate sex and quashed dreams – and so upliftingly sad – it’s also the safest and familiar-feeling movie of all time. Like Wordsworth’s bright ‘spots of time’, it could be your own memories.\n\nStream on Amazon/Google\n\nWhere was Call Me By Your Name filmed?\n\n‘How is anybody ever going to come up with a book or a painting or a symphony or a sculpture that can compete with a great city?’ Specifically, Paris. So many shots in Woody Allen’s relentlessly charming amusement about an American writer (Owen Wilson) accidentally travelling back in time to Paris in the 1920s and meeting such panjandrums as Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll, incandescent) show the city drenched in rain. Absolutely pelting down. Rain racing in the gutters. Rain hammering on the Seine, turning it white. The shots, though brief, seem to go on for long moments. The narcotic beauty of it! The insatiable longing that descends on us as the movie goes on – to be negotiating some café chair yourself, under an awning off the Pont Neuf, with your coat collar up, ordering coffee swilling with Armagnac while your shopping bags dissolve in the deluge. ‘How drop-dead gorgeous this city is in the rain!’ says Wilson. The same might be said for all cities, really – they magically turn into mirrors in the rain. Street puddles reflect light glimmeringly back upon itself. But Paris, being rain-coloured to begin with (those silver-grey apartment buildings), does rain best.\n\nStream on Amazon/Google\n\nA masterpiece, especially for the way it conjures London. Rarely is the city filmed in wide-shot (we never see a whole street), and yet you come away completely immersed in the place and era. It’s set circa 1953, with Daniel Day-Lewis playing a couture designer living and working in a smart London square off the Marylebone Road. His house is a high-stretching, late-Georgian caress of a building: polished parquet, stucco, white shutters, immaculate cupola and a vaulted staircase that winds into infinity past rooms filled with assiduous seamstresses. Here is the air of wealth. European royalty come and go, immaculately lipsticked, being fitted for weddings. And yet at the same time there’s something very close and secretive and quintessentially Fifties to the movie – it has the tone of a Muriel Sharp novel. The city reveals itself in alluring details only. Doors slightly ajar reveal shadows of the square beyond. Through tall sashed windows, as a countess is swathed in tulle and pinned, we see plane trees and sky and elegant brick. Perhaps the red blur of a London bus. You marvel that this is all we need to so successfully locate us in a place. A certain corner. A statue. Beautiful Sanderson wallpaper. Whenever I’m in the area I find myself walking out of my way especially to sit in Fitzroy Square where it was filmed, thinking about Daniel Day-Lewis eating a plate of porridge with cream for breakfast and drinking his lapsang, frowning and sketching while London wakes up beyond his casement.\n\nStream on Amazon/Google\n\n‘I love not Man the less, but Nature more,’ Byron wrote. This movie is as much as anything about travelling alone. Christopher McCandless was a restless young American seeking personal revitalisation by hitching towards Alaska in the early 1990s, inspired in part by Walt Whitman (‘I take to the open road’). Emile Hirsch’s McCandless grows ever thinner in leaky boots, his rucksack brimming with guides to edible plants, his hair a dustbowl, scrawny arms eternally on the brink of throwing each meagre item in his possession off a bridge just to ensure he won’t lose the focus of his ideals. Living on what he can forage, he strikes up brief friendships – in that intense, addictive way that any backpacker will recognise – with a catalogue of characters en route. The suspiciously buoyant Swedish campers. The caring older couple keen to offer their advice. The watchful girl with a guitar and a sheaf of sad songs. From the wheat fields of South Dakota and the blue water of the Topock Gorge, everything we see looks gorgeous. Especially the very guts of Alaska itself when we get there – huge skies of winter sunshine. It’s a landscape that eventually consumed McCandless, and its vigour and immensity feel overwhelming.\n\nStream on Amazon/Google\n\nThe most exciting crime thriller in years, about a New York City jeweller (Adam Sandler) perpetually on the crazed lookout for the next big score. It’s a movie completely charged by a desire to evoke the thrum of the diamond district and all the stories that the directors – the obsessive, hard-working Safdie brothers – heard their father tell about that part of the city. Stories that sounded to them like irresistible mini pulp-genre flicks as teenagers. It’s mostly filmed on 47th Street. An outdated, antiquated world; a cash-based economy of gemstones and bartering. The movie comes at you yelling. There are scenes where you feel like every argument, every deal, every scam is being drilled right into your head, the sound mix is so chaotic and vivid. Layers and layers of conversation and alarms and traffic and mobile phones. The Safdies didn’t close the area off for their exterior shots – they just went right out on the street, real pedestrians mixing unknowingly with extras (in that way of other indelible New York movies including Marathon Man, or Tootsie, when Dustin Hoffman, dressed as Dorothy for the first time, totters with prim perfection past unsuspecting members of the actual public). But more than anything, it’s the way that 47th Street itself is clearly utterly alive for everyone involved, a living thing that they just can't stop thinking about. A knockout.\n\nStream on Netflix\n\nOf all films shot in the desert, this one feels most saturated in a hypnotic, sunbaked, slow-blooded yellowness. A thirsty, seductive amber. It is perhaps the ultimate cinematic dream of aloneness. Mia Wasikowska stars in the true story of Australian writer Robyn Davidson, who, aged 27, walked 1,700 miles across bone-dry west Australia – for the hell of it, for the thrill, the peace – with just a few doting camels for company. ‘I’d always been drawn to the purity of the desert. The hot wind and the wide open spaces,’ she says. Occasionally she’s followed by a Time magazine photographer (played by a then-unknown and thrillingly idiosyncratic Adam Driver), who gazes at Mia’s upturned freckled frown approaching through heat-shimmers with a kind of existential longing we all share by the end of the movie: Tracksmakes you want to be a different sort of person. Happier with solitude. Braver.\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nThe look on Matt Damon’s face says it all. His character, Tom Ripley – low-born American charlatan, villainous but compelling impersonator – has come, in the late 1950s, to ‘Mongibello’, an amalgam of southern Italy’s Positano, Procida and Ischia, to spy on Jude Law’s Dickie Greenleaf, a WASP trust-fund brat. It’s not just Law’s startling eyes (blue as borage) and insolently expensive caramel curls that Ripley desires. Everything Tom sees, he covets. The candy-coloured houses clambering up the sparkling coast. The scooters and tans, the rattan bags and sandals. Espresso taken under citrus trees whilst playing at writing novels in the cobbled Amalfi afternoons; to the sound of Chet Baker and swifts and clapping masts in the bay below. But here’s Rome, too, at Christmas, with fairy lights swagged across chilly fountains. And Venice on a vivid blue day out of season, boats transporting socialites in cashmere. The freedom, the glamour and history of Italy! Away from the ‘subways and taxis and starched collars’ of America. All captured in Damon’s expression.\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nThis movie, about a British rock singer hiding from the world on a Sicilian island, and wrangling her troublesome lovers, is pretty much perfect. Sexy, hilarious and, absurd, it’s shot on a large, elegant old estate dotted with traditional houses (called dammusi; they look like scarab beetles), crimson hibiscus and Maiolica ceramics. A vivid yellow and blue swimming pool sits by a walled Arabian garden with a citrus tree that catches the movement of the light throughout the day like a sundial. In some of the best scenes, Matthias Schoenaerts drives an old Citroën Méhari (they’re everywhere here), sexily negotiating the pitted tracks and potholes of the roads, flooring the clutch in trodden-down deck shoes and blasting Captain Beefheart while Tilda Swinton hangs off his neck. Flowing fields of capers give way to sudden swathes of amber flowers that look like waving hedgerows of Champagne. There’s a lagoon in the opening scene that islanders call the Mirror of Venus – an ancient caldera coloured the outlandish blue of a Himalayan poppy, where Swinton and Schoenaerts spend the morning crusted in skin-softening mud, snogging and sleeping. Where is this? you ask just about every time the scenery changes. The location glowers and shadows, and by the end you’re wind-blasted, ensnared. Interviewing the director, Luca Guadagnino, once, I told him I’d visited Pantelleria in tribute to the movie. ‘When you were there, did you dream?’ he asked. ‘Oh the dreams on Pantelleria! So dramatic. So tempestuous. Oh, the dreams….’\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nLeonard Cohen would have put the Greek island of Hydra on the map when he made it his home in 1960, if this film hadn’t pipped him to the post. Sophia Loren stars as a sponge diver in a patently ridiculous tale of skulduggery and salvaged ancient statues, and many of those still living on the island appeared in the film as children, and talk about it like it all happened yesterday. However foolish the plot, the film is mesmeric, the camera capturing so much of what makes Hydra (then, and still) a kind of paradise. Sere thistles and Judas trees punctuate the shore as we swoop past grand villas and smaller overhanging-flowered cottages, water glistering off rocky shores, sponges in the underwater shots the colour of caramel, coming up from abyssal depths. And up comes Sophia too, time and again, clutching one to her historic décolleté after a dive (‘Her double was even more beautiful!’ the harbour master here once told me.) Watching the movie you see how little the island’s one main town has changed. Shaped like a horseshoe, the port backing into a natural amphitheatre dotted with russet and citrine, 18th-century, Genoese-designed millionaire-mariner’s mansions; coiling around these houses, intensely warm coloured in the sun, are white labyrinths of high steps and streets which take on a honeysuckle glow in the pale evening shadows. They sometimes show the film in the port during the summer, and people shout ‘There’s my house!’ and whoop and applaud.\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nA movie that seems to have been made in part as an advert for its location, In Bruges simultaneously – so cleverly, so irresistibly – offers a challenge to any prospective visitor. Writer-director Martin McDonagh knows that we are all sitting there silently earmarking the city as a MUST VISIT IMMEDIATELY, as he sends his two antiheroes, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson – soft-hearted, doomed Irish hitmen both – to hang out in the medieval capital of the County of Flanders, waiting for instructions from their nutty, Bruges-fanatic boss (an incandescent Ralph Fiennes). Where Farrell is furiously bored by the town (history is ‘all just a load of stuff that’s already happened’), Gleeson is completely charmed (‘all those canals and bridges and cobbled streets…’) and the camera flits down the waterways and through the squares, picking out glowering swans and moonlight reflected off leaded windows as Farrell rants and Gleeson goes assiduously to museums. Oh, the bloodied wintry sunsets over 13th-century stone belfries. Bruges is famously photogenic – but what the film comprehends is its more menacing thrum and darkness, its greater sense of fate. The film’s a taunt to the traveller, an enticement.\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nThe only film to have debuted simultaneously at the two largest movie theatres in NYC, the Roxy and Radio City Music Hall – 10 screenings a day, each sold out. And not just because of the magnificent scenes of the giant ape, cinema’s favourite misfit, uprooted from his prehistoric Skull Island lair, where he had lived in roaring disharmony with dinosaurs. But it’s loved more, I think, for the scenes in New York, where his co-star Fay Wray is first discovered, pale under a little cloche hat, stealing an apple from a stall off Broadway. The lights of Times Square – ads for Pepsodent and Chevrolet – glisten in a winter fog. The Manhattan skyline is seen from the New Jersey side of the Hudson, with the sharp jag of the Chrysler Building looking like an arrow to the heavens. It seems to impersonate the slimness and sparkle of Wray herself. And when Kong hangs off the top of the Empire State at the end of the movie, a furious dawn sun breaks through the clouds as in Titian’s painting of Goliath, and we spot Central Park below, a patch of wild space in this most designed and thrusting of cities. With this backdrop, Wray struggles in the monster’s grip in a powerful image of unrequited love.\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\n‘The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild…’ wrote the incomparable Romantic poet John Keats, in a verse composed while sitting under a plum tree in a garden on Hampstead Heath in 1819. Then, Hampstead was his adopted locale, in a house that still stands up by the Spaniards pub, when the village was a day’s march from the city of London. The heath area there today remains 800 acres of ancient parkland, woodland and meadow. This film, about Keats’s time in Hampstead, might send you directly there – and the reality won’t disappoint. ‘I’ve explored all these paths,’ explains Ben Whishaw’s unbearably tender, dying Keats to his beloved neighbour and betrothed Fanny Brawne, ‘which are more in number than your eyelashes…’ Moments in the film are so sad and beautiful that audiences openly wept. Here’s drama and plot and love and tragedy, and yet sometimes the whole thing feels like a super-feminine, drowsy montage of sensations and beauty; a spring bower of magnolia buds and bluebells, butterflies and dew-drenched poppies. High reeds around the swimming ponds, blurred dragonflies, the occasional glimpse of St Paul’s in the grey distance reminding you that a whole city beckons below, with all its hardness and reality. Death is inescapable. If only we could dawdle forever in this high Hampstead dell.\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nTo the Montparnasse studio of the great Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti, in 1964. This wasn’t even filmed in the city and yet still manages to give that most charismatic, celebrated of terrains – the Left Bank of the Seine – more than its due. Director Stanley Tucci used to joke that this was the easiest job he’d ever had – walking to the Twickenham set to film, from his home by the Thames. On those walks he would think about how to bring Paris to the audience, in this cluttered, grimy art-studio setting that its owner once called ‘the prettiest and humblest of them all’. Magically, Tucci pulls it off. The belted macs on the hurrying extras in the street, the cigarettes and cigarettes, Geoffrey Rush as the artist with his tremendous uprush of grey curls, head held in concentration and then growing impatience over red wine and espressos gulped in neighbouring cafés. The bells of – is it? Yes… – Notre-Dame pealing eerily as the grey winter light ekes its way through the glass while Giacometti works with frozen hands. ‘Everything is about to dissolve, everything is floating,’ noted the writer Jean Genet once, of the studio that Tucci has recreated with such spirit. ‘And yet it all appears to be captured in an absolute reality.’\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nAng Lee’s swooning Chinese martial-arts fable involving two sets of lovers, a missing sword and the theft of an ivory comb, is set under the Qing dynasty, during the 19th-century – and yet the story feels far, far older. It seems to inhabit some indefinite, painted past, with a teeming hinterland of Mongol invaders and a heart-poundingly romantic closing scene showing steps leading up a forested, moss-bursting mountain towards an ageless temple. The characters literally float when in combat (the actors were hoisted frighteningly high on wires), silk robes streaming, and what we see and hear beneath them makes us twitch to be there: pink-throbbing cherry blossom, the whistling of fighters in vast woodlands, horses tearing across the Gobi Desert. Paper lanterns in the dusk of antique Chinese courtyards, the sort of architecture that seems to unfold in the dim light, like a delicate paper scroll, while Yo-Yo Ma bursts the life out of his cello on the soundtrack.\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nIt could be morbid: a film about the hostels in the holy city on the Ganges where elderly Hindus take themselves off to die, having decided enough is enough. They buy their time-slot and simply prepare, seemingly unquestioningly, for the end – families visit, pyres are built along the riverbank, the days tick by. Such hostels exist. And yet… young director Shubhashish Bhutiani, with little to no budget, moves with instinctive swagger and tenderness amongst the crowds with his cinematographer – especially in the scenes along the river, which are pure vérité, catching faces in rhapsodic moments of grief and humour and wonder. There’s a scene during a mass prayer ceremony where many celebrants have been drinking lassi laced with mango and marijuana, singing on the steps of old temples, boats hugger-mugger, flares lit, stars hanging like lamps over green-blossomed champak trees, voices rising in urgent unison. Such wit in every shot, but love, too, and also that sense of a film learning new and quite mystical things about an old, old religion – and an even older country.\n\nStream on Amazon Prime\n\nLike this?
