        "text": "Abstract\n\nAlbert Camus' reception of the ancient world is a subject deserving greater consideration than it has currently received. This article will discuss the importance of Greece and Rome in Camus' Absurd cycle and its implications in the context of colonial Algeria. I begin with an analysis of Camus' instinctive polarization of Greece and Rome (Greece as artistic and democratic; Rome as violent and imperialist), before arguing that this antithesis was vital in two of Camus' most lasting creations: Sisyphus and Caligula. I will examine both the complex use of Greek myth in Le Mythe de Sisyphe and Camus’ contrasting representation of Roman society in the play Caligula. These receptions will then be situated within the political and literary contexts in which Camus wrote, particularly that of colonialism. Camus' reception of the ancient world reveals much about his complex relationship with Algeria. Even as he rejected the Latinizing tropes of previous colonial writers, his own concept of Graeco-Mediterraneanism was equally predicated on Eurocentric discourses. Camus' vision of the ancient world goes to the heart of understanding not only his Absurd literature but ultimately, I suggest, reveals a writer at a crossroads between Europe and Africa.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the fifty years that have passed since Albert Camus' death he has become recognized as one of the most important figures in modern French literature. Born into poverty, he lived a ‘life mapped against one of the most violent periods of history’ and has become one of the most defining voices of this time.1 He is often linked with Jean-Paul Sartre and the school of French existentialism; however, Camus saw himself as part of a very different tradition. Receiving his Nobel Prize in 1957, he was asked in a Question and Answer session if he considered himself an existentialist. He replied\n\nI am not an existentialist, although of course critics are obliged to make categories. I got my first philosophical impressions from the Greeks, not from nineteenth century Germany.2\n\nThe presence of classical culture can be felt throughout Camus' work. Famously Le Mythe de Sisyphe (1942) concludes with a reflection on the Greek mythic figure. L'Homme révolté (1951) establishes the moderate and just Greeks as the antithesis of modern excess. Camus recorded in his journal: ‘the world in which I am most at ease: Greek myth’.3 Abbou argues that ancient Greece was a continuous source of inspiration in Camus' imagination.4 Rome also exerted a hold on his imagination. He wrote an historical drama Caligula (1944) and several of his early essays are based on visits to Roman ruins. Against this rich backdrop it remains surprising how little scholarly attention has been paid to the importance of these classical references in Camus' work. In his dialogue with the ancient world we encounter some of the most significant and contentious questions concerning the modern relationship with the classical tradition. Recognizing their significance will give a more complete understanding both of Camus as a writer and also of the cultural and political context in which he wrote.\n\nCamus represents a vitally important example of classical reception in two major ways. First, he sits at a confluence of European thought about Classics that reaches back as far as the Enlightenment. Ancient Greece held a particularly significant place in the French imagination, extending from the works of Voltaire and Chateaubriand through to Gide and Malraux. Camus' use of Greece plays a formative role in his interaction with this tradition. It also demonstrates the influence of Romantic literature on his work, present in his obsession with myth and his reverence of antique ruins. Equally, his use of Greece brought him in to contact with the contemporary resurgence of ancient mythology in the writings of Anouilh, Sartre, Cocteau and Giradoux. Camus' literature exists at the juncture between modernity's uses of myth and the more traditional idealized and romanticized vision of Greece. His Greece was both a place of idealized beauty and cultural and artistic pre-eminence but also a theoretical construction that he used to illustrate his key philosophical and political arguments.\n\nThe second context of major importance is Camus' Franco-Algerian identity. In the literature of French Algeria there was a long tradition of using classical motifs both to justify colonialism and (later) to integrate the European and non-European populations. Camus' perspective on Greece and Rome was inevitably informed by these traditions. Camus was not only influenced by the literary traditions but also by propagandistic appropriations by Algerian colonialists and European Fascists. The example of Camus is instructive as he sits at a crossroads between Europe and Africa at a period of intense colonial activity. His interest in Classics tells us a great deal about how essential the discourse of classicism was to European imperialism. It also raises larger questions about why an Algerian writer should identify so closely with Greek culture and what this says about the culture and society of the colonizers.\n\nThis article will attempt to provide an introduction to thinking about Camus and the classical world, focusing on his Absurd works. Not only does this period contain perhaps his most explicit interactions with antiquity but they also demonstrate a key aspect of Camus' thought: the binary opposition between ancient Greece and ancient Rome. Studying this opposition demonstrates not only how Camus was able to shape classical narratives to his own philosophy, but also how this fascination with antiquity was implicated in the intensely volatile period of its composition.\n\nGreece and Rome\n\nThe idea of Greece permeates Camus' writing. In his essays L’Été (1954) and L'Homme révolté, Greek culture is presented as the antithesis of the modern age. For Camus, Fascism and war had their roots in the modern alienation from the values of Greece.\n\nWe have exiled beauty, the Greeks took up arms for her. It is the first difference, but a long-standing one. Greek thought was always founded on the idea of limits. It pushed nothing to the extreme, neither reason, nor religion, because it denied nothing, neither reason nor religion. It gave everything its share, balancing shadows with light. Our Europe on the contrary, embarking on the conquest of totality, is the daughter of excess. It denies beauty as it denies everything that it does not exalt.5\n\nThis idealization of Greek culture, although fraught with idiosyncrasies and paradoxes, is essential to Camus' thought. Martin Rodin, for instance, argues that for a writer who displays such a significant preference for the Mediterranean and for antiquity, Camus' affinity for ancient Greece should ultimately come as no surprise.6 Greek philosophy and mythology do not function in his arguments simply as rhetorical flourishes but rather demonstrate his strong personal and intellectual bond with the ancient world. Although he did not visit Greece until 1955, twenty years earlier Camus was writing in praise of the beauty of Greece and its imagined similarities to Algeria based on climate, landscape and people. He saw no tension in this imaginary mapping of Europe onto Africa. So he describes Kabylie, a poverty-stricken, mostly Arab region of Northern Algeria:\n\nNarrow paths bordered by barbary and fig trees, olive, carob jujube trees. On these paths you meet men with brown faces and clean eyes, leading donkeys laden with olives … Greece? No, Kablyia. And it is as if suddenly, across the centuries, the whole of Greece had suddenly been set down between the sea and the mountains, reborn in its ancient splendour.7\n\nAs a constant parallel to this affinity for Greece, ancient Rome is conceived as a ruthlessly imperialistic society that had suppressed the Greek spirit and replaced it with a love of conquest and violence. Camus' complaint against modern thought is that it had turned its back on Greek culture in favour of\n\nthe power which apes grandeur, first Alexander and then the Roman conquerors, which our textbooks, by an incomparable baseness of soul, teach us to admire.8\n\nThis tyrannical impulse was a subversion of everything Greece had given to humanity. Rome's contribution had only been to ‘replace artistic genius and feeling for life, which they lacked, with a genius for war’.9 Modern Europe's fundamental error had been ‘attributing to Rome that which began in Athens'.10\n\nThis direct contrast between Greece and Rome features in much of Camus' writing. For Camus, the term Caesar became a byword for tyrannical leadership, be it fascist or socialist. Importantly, Rome is always characterized by the rule of the Caesars, Greece as a democratic, free and peaceful state. Athens' military imperialism and the democracy of the Roman Republic receive no mention in Camus' work but this is less paradoxical than it may seem: his concepts were, after all, clearly not historical. Rather his selective understanding of the cultures of Greece and Rome demonstrates that they were ultimately both constructions of his own imagination. Considering this opposition gives a new and important context to the works for which Camus is perhaps best known: his Absurd cycle.\n\nThe Absurd works were composed in the late 1930s and early 40s and mark the first major phase of Camus' literary career. The most famous of these works are the novel L’Étranger, the play Caligula, and the essay Le Mythe de Sisyphe, which collectively Camus referred to as his ‘three absurds'.11 Another play, Le Malentendu, and his posthumously published novel La Mort heureuse are now also viewed as Absurd works. Germaine Brée summarizes the Absurd as recognition of ‘the discrepancy between human desires and the evidence of human limitations'.12Le Mythe de Sisyphe discusses the futility of the search for greater meaning and yet affirms humanity's instinctive revolt against this meaninglessness. Weyembergh describes the essay as fully accepting the landscape of Nietzschean thought, the total absence of god and the spectre of the nihilistic impulse.13 The Absurd realization or, as Camus describes it, the moment when ‘the “why” arises', could potentially be dehumanizing if it is not met with lucidity and ultimately a will to resist.14 For Camus, this resistance came about through embracing rather than struggling against the limitations of existence and therefore finding happiness both in spite of, and indeed because of, absurdity. L’Étranger (1942) is written in a consciously stark prose that offered no room for literary devices like classical reference, however, Le Mythe de Sisyphe and Caligula, are both heavily indebted to Camus' interaction with the classical world.\n\nSisyphus—an inverted myth\n\nCamus' Le Mythe de Sisyphe deals with one of post-religious philosophy's most pressing questions: if one accepts the meaninglessness of existence, what is the justification for continuing to live? The essay begins\n\nthere is only one philosophical problem that is truly serious, it is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not is worth living is to answer the fundamental question of philosophy.15\n\nCamus ultimately concludes that one should not commit suicide; that suicide is an evasion of the Absurd not a solution. Yet while life itself must be considered worth living, how can happiness be achieved in the face of the Absurd? Camus explored this problem by considering the mythic figure of Sisyphus.\n\nCursed to push a rock to the top of a mountain for eternity, a meaningless and unceasing endeavour, Sisyphus is a personification of the Absurd condition. Camus was interested specifically in the moment when Sisyphus is forced to watch the rock roll back down the mountain and unquestioningly follow it to begin his labour again.\n\nIt is during this return, this pause, that Sisyphus interests me … I see this man going back down with a heavy yet equal step towards the torment of which he will never know the end … in each of these instants, where he leaves the summits and sinks bit by bit towards the lair of the gods, he is superior to his destiny. He is stronger than his rock.16\n\nIn these moments Sisyphus is granted a brief respite to pause and consider his condition. Lucidity is what makes Sisyphus the ‘Absurd hero’.17 There would be no punishment at all if he felt hope that his task was achievable. Instead, he ‘is lucid about and thus accepts, as he resists, the limits of the condition’.18 He understands his efforts are ultimately meaningless and in this he is similar to the modern worker who ‘works, every day of his life, at the same tasks and this fate is not less absurd’.19 Rather than cursing Sisyphus, this understanding and comprehensive knowledge of the limitations of his condition is the source of his happiness. His endless labour, although a punishment, is fundamentally his own and he remains master of how he faces this destiny. Pushing the rock to the summit is his self-expression, his art. As Camus writes ‘His rock is his thing’.20 It is all he can achieve, so he achieves it as best he can. For Weyembergh, it is between the absence of hope and the refusal of despair that Sisyphus can find happiness.21 He understands his limits, accepts what he cannot change and commits himself to accomplish what he can. In this acceptance, he is fulfilled and his fulfilment is his revolt against his punishment. For Camus therefore, the human condition, which is equally as inescapable and cruel as Sisyphus' labour, must be met with lucidity and acceptance. He concludes that\n\nthis universe henceforth without a master does not seem sterile or futile to him … the struggle itself towards the summits is enough to fill the heart of man. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.22\n\n* * *\n\nArchambault has written a thorough study of Camus' classical sources, particularly the influence of Aeschylus, Homer, and Thucydides.23 He concludes that Camus' reflections on these writers were\n\nimpressive neither for their precision nor for their critical acuity. His most memorable pages on Sisyphus are almost entirely the product of school book sources.24\n\nArchambault demonstrates through a close study of linguistic similarities that it is most likely Camus was using general reference works: Commelin's Nouvelle Mythologie des Grecs et des Latins and the Grand Dictionnaire Universel, rather than ancient Greek sources themselves.25 He takes this as evidence that\n\nquality of feeling is very much a product of quality of understanding … it seems reasonable to assume that Camus' knowledge of Greek culture is a fair stick wherewith to measure the quality of his love.26\n\nThis is currently the only major study dedicated specifically to the importance of Greece in Camus' work but I would suggest that directly comparing his work with ancient texts to establish a degree of ‘accuracy’ misses the importance of the role Greece played in his thought.27 Camus was not a classicist and when reading ancient texts he did so in translation. The degree of fidelity to ancient sources alone is a severely limiting approach to the study of reception and this is particularly true for Camus, who actively attempted to alter and shape ancient material to his own contemporary purposes. He wrote that ‘myths have no life of their own. They wait for us to incarnate them’.28 This statement is a good summation of the place mythology occupied in his imagination, as a more thorough study of Sisyphus demonstrates.\n\nIt is clear that Camus has incarnated a figure of Sisyphus quite differently from one we would recognize. He effectively inverts the traditional and familiar. Sisyphus becomes a model of eternal contentment rather than eternal suffering. This is a conscious attempt to defy expectations and to disrupt tradition. Camus immediately decentres the myth, choosing not to focus, as previous artistic depictions have, on the moment of Sisyphus' agonizing struggle but rather on the moment when he walks down the mountain. This moment is absent from most depictions yet he makes it his prime focus. In focussing on this normally assumed moment, Camus is interacting with the myth rather than simply retelling. Both the myth's focal point and its conclusion are inverted — and in this Camus mirrors the structure of his argument. We expect a miserable, eternally suffering Sisyphus so Camus presents us with an eternally satisfied one. Equally, despite the seemingly bleak and devastating conclusions of a meaningless universe, his argument demonstrates that happiness is possible, indeed natural. Engagement and refutation of a traditional depiction of myth helps Camus reinforce his conclusions. He engages with and challenges expectations in order to strengthen his conclusion.\n\nSisyphus is also an example of the function mythology has played in philosophical discourse. Greek mythology has become a symbol of philosophical discourse, a part of the vocabulary of European philosophy, from Nietzsche's Dionysus to Freud's Oedipus. A larger discussion of this phenomenon would be impossible here, but clearly Camus was interacting with this tradition and attempting to engage with it in his own use of myth. Sisyphus also allowed Camus an unbridled freedom to follow the Absurd to a conclusion not bound by practical limitations. The essential malleability of mythology permits him to mould it to fit his philosophy. Perhaps at a deeper level, mythology can be seen as a mask behind which the writer can hide. Brée argues that Camus inherently disliked any form of personal confession and in this sense the myth is a device that gave him some critical distance, turning him from participant into a narrator.29 Finally Sisyphus, with his eternal punishment and absolute rebellion, is a transcendent figure, one who is beyond humanity and whose immortality gives his struggle an enduring, ageless quality. For a work that rejects religious solutions, this sense of gravity and grandeur could not be achieved with the use of biblical figures generations of Christian philosophers had done before. Again, Camus is intentionally interacting with this tradition and attempting to find a secular equivalent. Sisyphus is a martyr to the Absurd who teaches through his suffering.\n\nOf most significance is that Camus' positive example of how one can live with the burdens of the Absurd comes in the form of a Greek myth. Sisyphus is the most famous example of this but Camus used Greek mythology in this way in a number of essays. A reference in his notebooks demonstrates that the major movements in his thought were conceived around mythic themes:\n\nI. The myth of Sisyphus (Absurd) – II. The myth of Prometheus (revolt) – III. The myth of Nemesis.30\n\nPrometheus was one of the most important figures in Camus' literary career. The motif of Prometheus as a humanistic revolutionary (in Prométhée aux enfers) and as a metaphysical revolutionary (in L'Homme révolté) embodies some of the most important ideas of Camus' later thought.31 Nemesis was used in L’Été and L'Homme révolté to symbolize the natural correction of the transgression of limits, ‘Nemesis is watching, goddess of moderation, not of vengeance’.32 Camus' insistence on modernity's ideological immoderation is a key theme of L'Homme révolté and the projected essay on the theme of Nemesis looked to expand upon this, again using the vehicle of Greek myth.33\n\nGreek mythology was a vital part of Camus' intellectual expression. It is essential to note that in each of the cases above the myth is deployed as an affirmative and positive exemplar. The antidotes to modern problems are located in these ancient models. It cannot be considered an accident that the mythology chosen to embody these ideals is that of ancient Greece, a culture that Camus understood as containing the key to humanity's potential for happiness and virtue. This impression is fundamentally strengthened when one considers the substantial departure from Sisyphus, which occurs in the Absurd work located in a culture Camus viewed as the antithesis of Greek virtue: ancient Rome.\n\nCaligula as dictator?\n\nCaligula is the best known and most successful of Camus' plays. His first draft of the play was completed in 1938 but the final and much changed version was published in 1944.34 It was contemporaneous with L’Étranger and Le Mythe de Sisyphe, although it explores the theme of the Absurd in a quite different way. Meursault, the protagonist of L’Étranger, and Sisyphus are inherently powerless, against the judgement of society or the punishments of the gods. Caligula conversely has absolute power. After the death of Drusilla for the first time, Caligula is ‘exposed to the experience of the Absurd’.35 He comes to the realization that ‘men die and they are not happy’ and considers that the only option left to mankind is to embrace this absurdity fully.36 His realization of the Absurd does not lead him to seek personal happiness but rather to force his subjects to understand the meaninglessness of life by pursuing a campaign of brutal and arbitrary violence. This leads to the revolution of his subjects both against his tyrannical rule and against the eradication of meaning from their lives. The play's first performances temporal proximity to the end of the Second World War has also led audiences to see in the figure of Caligula as a representation of the rise of the European dictator.\n\nCaligula is conceived in a similar mode to Le Mythe de Sisyphe in so far as once again Camus actively seeks to disrupt the familiar image of the Emperor and invert expectations. Caligula is presented in the ancient historical accounts as an insane tyrant and it is this concept that most artistic interpretations of the Emperor have adhered to. Camus' Caligula is rather in the grip of the Absurd realization and following it to its ultimate and logical conclusion. Cherea laments that Caligula ‘is not mad enough. And that is what I detest in him, that he knows what he wants'.37 Furthermore, despite his actions, the play challenges how far the audience should view Caligula as a tyrannical dictator or whether other aspects of his personality and his motivations present a different characterization. This sense of consciously challenging the traditional portrayal of Caligula is heightened by Camus' use of notorious moments of tyrannical excess from Suetonius' chapter on the Emperor. Jean Grenier, Camus' university philosophy instructor, introduced him to the writings of Suetonius who he perceived as a ‘barbarian Nietzsche’.38 Camus, however, presents them as conscious gestures to demonstrate the Absurd rather than acts of insanity or tyranny.39 Rather than inverting the traditional conventions of myth as he did with Sisyphus, here Camus inverts an historical account to strengthen his philosophical argument. In the production notes of the earlier version of the play Camus wrote ‘nothing here is unhistorical. The words are authentic, their exploitation is not’.40 As in Le Mythe de Sisyphe, Camus' reception is ultimately a reinvention, consciously working against the audience's expectations.\n\nBastien describes Caligula as the meeting of the absolute power of an individual with absolute powerlessness over the human condition.41 The idea of absolute power is critical to the play. It can be seen broadly as a theatrical device, used by Camus to remove any practical limitations on an individual's response to the Absurd. Yet as with the case of Greece, the choice of Rome and its implications cannot be viewed as incidental or arbitrary but rather as central to Camus' literary intentions. It remains important to recognize that Caligula's complex characterization must be located firmly in the context of Camus' reception of Rome.\n\n* * *\n\nCaligula does not feel that he is a tyrant. When Scipio identifies him as one he responds:\n\nA tyrant is a man who sacrifices the nation to his ideas or to his ambition. I have no ideas and I have nothing to aspire for in terms of honours and power.42\n\nCaligula argues that he has engaged in no wars to expand Rome's frontiers and has, in fact, done nothing that was specifically for his own glory but rather ‘if it is easy for me to kill, it is because it is not hard for me to die’.43 The outlandish and indiscriminate nature of his actions is designed simply to stop subjects from lying to themselves about the nature of their existence and accept the Absurd. Rather they ‘need a teacher’ to open their eyes to the truth of an indifferent universe.44 He cares nothing about personal glory and ultimately will acquiesce even in his own death. Caligula reflects: ‘the more I think about it, the more I persuade myself that I am no tyrant’.45 It is significant, in the context of the events of the 1930s and 40s, that Caligula sees imperialist expansion and a singular leader cult as the signs of a tyrant. Camus quite consciously attempts to differentiate the actions and motivations of Caligula from those of a modern European dictator. Camus' Emperor is deliberately more complex and multifaceted.\n\nCaligula is both Emperor and Artist. His vision is to demonstrate the Absurd to his subjects with a vast performance of which murder is only a part. He aims to invite his subjects ‘to a celebration without limitations, to the general proceedings of the greatest of spectacles'.46 Then he ‘will show them something they have never seen before’.47 For Gay-Crosier, Caligula effectively takes on the role of theatrical impresario, actor and director of his own Absurd performance.48 Bastien sees Caligula as playing a ‘highly theatrical game’ and this theatricality is integral to the play.49 In the third act during the dialogue with Cherea, the stage direction states the Caligula talks ‘naturally … for the first time since the beginning of the play’ suggesting that he has been and continues to be playing a role.50 Throughout the play he is offering a performance. Within this there are a number of smaller performances and spectacles and his artistic talents are considerable. He dances, plays the part of Venus and is Scipio's equal in poetic composition.51 He is equally comfortable playing the comedian as he is playing the role of a supreme deity over his subjects.52 Lévi-Valensi saw Caligula as a supreme theatrical director who reserved for himself the most important roles: of judge and executioner, god and destiny.53 Even his assassination is contrived, turning the patricians and even Cherea into ‘puppet assassins’ in a choreographed suicide.54 Camus made Caligula an intricate and ambiguous figure rather than a straightforwardly dictatorial presence. Margerrison saw the young Camus' fascination with Nietzsche in the Emperor, who through his creative abilities is a manifestation of the ‘artist-god’.55 His imperial power allows him to turn Rome into a stage on which to act out his philosophy.\n\nMuch as he denies his own tyranny, Caligula's actions still resemble those of a totalitarian ruler. Bastien comments on the anger and violence with which Caligula addresses to his subjects at times in the play.56 Toura describes the solitary nature of Caligula's supremacy while Gay-Crosier agrees that Caligula cannot necessarily distinguish between the desire for happiness and the desire for power.57 Caligula regularly talks about his freedom as separating him from the other Romans:\n\nthis world is without importance and whoever recognises this conquers his freedom … and in fact, I hate you because you are not free. In all the Roman Empire, here am I, the only free man.58\n\nThis freedom is both a philosophical freedom from worldly concerns and also the freedom of absolute power. He openly admits that this freedom must come at the expense of the suffering of others. When he closes the grain stores in order to create a famine he states that\n\nTomorrow, there will be catastrophe, and I will stop the catastrophe when it pleases me … After all, I do not have so many ways to prove that I am free.59\n\nYet Caligula's celebration of his absolute power is equally part of his performance. Arguably, the role of dictator is the most important he plays. His freedom is also the freedom of artistic creation. The other patricians fail to see this and react only to the oppression and tyranny of his reign. Cherea however recognizes that\n\nCaligula may be doing what he dreamed of doing and everything which is dreamed is happening. He is transforming his philosophy into corpses and, unfortunately for us, it is an uncontested philosophy.60\n\nCherea's desire to live simply and to ignore the conclusions of the Absurd is the exact inverse of Caligula's philosophy yet the pair's implicit understanding of each other is telling. They are effectively the two sides of the Absurd realization. In his notebooks, Camus wrote in a draft of a later abandoned epilogue to the play\n\nNo, Caligula is not dead, he is in each one of you. If you were given the power, if you had the courage, if you loved life, you would see this monster or this angel that you carry within you break loose.61\n\nLike Cherea, we are intended to see Caligula not simply as a tyrant but as one who has a comprehensive understanding of the absurdity of existence. To teach the world about its absurdity he becomes teacher, actor, comedian, and artist as well as executioner and despot.\n\n* * *\n\nCamus specifically rejected a reading of the play that linked the figure of Caligula to the rise of the European dictatorships. He stressed that the play had been substantially written in 1938 and subsequent events had endowed it with ‘an unintended meaning’.62 However, comparisons between the earlier and later versions of the play have generally shown that Caligula's artistic and theatrical capacities were toned down and a stronger focus placed upon his authoritarian rule and the ensuing revolt.63 This can potentially be understood as a reaction to contemporary events but also, as Gay-Crosier suggests, as part of Camus' more general progress from the Absurd to the philosophy of Revolt.64 The first Caligula is arguably the cousin of the Absurd works while in the later drafts we see the origins of La Peste.65 Margerrison considers the rewritings of the play as the reason that we find in Caligula a ‘Christ-like or Dionysian figure’, the supreme artist, yet also ‘a penetrating study of a dictator’.66 Yet despite Caligula's increasingly dictatorial nature, in both drafts of the play the truly tyrannical presence is Camus' Rome and her politics.\n\nIn the choice of Rome as a setting, Camus includes a critique of a society that knowingly and willingly permitted absolute power to be granted to an individual. In the play's early scenes the Patricians discuss how previously they have been successful in manipulating the young Emperor, who lacked the confidence to rule absolutely. This is presented as the political status quo that Caligula's Absurd realization disrupts. There is no sense of Caligula's power being atypical; it is only his exercise of it that creates discord. He can play the roles of artist, teacher, dictator, and god because his power allows him the absolute freedom to do so. The most strikingly totalitarian aspect of Camus' play is not Caligula himself but rather the Roman world he occupies.\n\nRome is presented as a world in which authoritarian leadership has always been the accepted form of government. While plotting a conspiracy Cherea mentions that Rome has ‘known mad Emperors' in the past.67 He also points out that\n\nwithout doubt this is not the first time that, amongst us, a man has had unlimited power at his disposal.68\n\nCamus' Rome is a society that has always accepted the absolute rule of the Caesars. The play makes no reference anywhere in his work to the Roman Republic and democracy in Rome. There is certainly no suggestion that Caligula was only the third Emperor. In the context of his binary between an enlightened democratic Greece and a totalitarian Rome, this one-dimensional re-imagining of Roman history is not surprising. In comparison to Camus' idealized conception of Greek culture, the Rome of Caligula is an inherently repressive and authoritarian culture. It is made clear in the first act that should Caligula fall, another individual will take his place as absolute ruler. Gay-Crosier and Bastien describe Cherea's character as that of a prototypical revolutionary.69 Yet his actions are a revolt against Caligula's philosophy and the attempt to render life meaningless. The other conspirators act out of fear, vengeance, or humiliation.70 Neither fundamentally rejects the system that allowed Caligula to rule. Caligula's assassination is a personal and a philosophical revolt, not a political one. Rome, for Camus, was a civilization that created Caligula and was incapable of imagining the possibility of granting freedom to its citizens. His exercise of power may not be imperialistic, but Caligula's imposition of his Absurd philosophy on his subjects is dependent upon existing in a historical culture that permitted complete and unquestioned power. Ultimately, as Weyembergh argues, without the device of the Roman Empire Caligula is a ‘teacher without students'.71 The Patricians do not desire their political freedom. They seek only to replace Caligula with an Emperor who they can manipulate for their own interests. Against Camus' perception of the freedom and tranquillity of Greece, the Rome of Caligula again demonstrates the strength of the binary between the two. Ultimately the complexity of Caligula's characterization cannot be viewed outside of this context. His artistic and deadly fantasies find an outlet only because it is this culture he exists in. Rome is fundamentally conceived as a culture of oppression and despotism.\n\nSisyphus recognizes and embraces the absurdity of existence yet sees a way to live with this knowledge. Caligula focuses on the crushing lack of meaning the Absurd represents yet he is not presented as being wrong. He is lucid about the constraints of the human condition rather refusing to face them. Yet by taking the Absurd to its most extreme conclusions, it becomes dehumanizing rather than affirmative. If Sisyphus is the Absurd hero, then perhaps Caligula is the Absurd antihero. The audience is both repulsed and fascinated by both his actions and his philosophical conclusions. It is of little surprise Camus located these two conflicting reactions to the Absurd in Greece and Rome, two cultures that he saw as repudiations of one another.\n\nAlgerian contexts\n\nThe sharp distinction between Greece and Rome in Camus' thought was not incidental but had its antecedents in both the literature of colonial Algeria and the political events of Camus' life. His idealization of Greece and disdain for Rome were not idiosyncratic conclusions but rather a reaction to a long tradition of political and rhetorical exploitation of these cultures.\n\nMost important amongst these was the use of Rome in the rhetoric of Algerian colonialism. In the early twentieth century, Algeria's Roman history was increasingly identified as a justification for the continued presence and dominance of the European outsider. Novelist and historian Louis Bertrand was a founding figure in the school of Algerianism (or Algérianité). The Algerianists sought to overcome the orientalizing tradition of French literature and instead articulate and promote a Franco-Algerian nationality that was culturally equal to metropolitan France. In time this identity would also be stressed as culturally superior to the Arab population and was based on the presence of France in Africa as an absolute right founded in classical history. The Maghreb was\n\nderided, then elided within an imaginary geography of ‘virgin territory’. This was then claimed as the rightful inheritance of the European settler.72\n\nBertrand underplayed the Arabic and Berber history of Algeria in favour of a pre-existent Roman presence that was symbolized by the wealth of material remains in the Algerian countryside. Bertrand wrote that in French Algeria the ‘timeless Latin man’ and\n\nLatin Africa … was being reborn in the pagan necropolis and Christian catacombs, in the ruins and the colonies and towns Rome had spread across the land.73\n\nThese physical remains not only gave a sense of a European ‘powerful prior claim’ to Algeria, but also stood as testaments to the civilizing spirit of the Latin race.74 Bertrand's ‘Latin Africa’ was a product of the colonial adventure which was begun by the Romans and continued by their French successors. This led to what Haddour describes as the ‘fetishizing [of] Roman ruins' by adherents of the Algerianist movement.75 The physical remains of Rome's superiority ‘served as anchors’ to the Algerianist's views.76 Camus directly engaged with this tradition and aimed to subvert its conclusions. In his early essay collection Noces (1939), Camus transformed Bertrand's symbols of colonial precedence into scenes of youthful Mediterranean joy or into a direct rejection of imperialist ambitions. Considering the Roman ruins at Djémila, he concluded that\n\nmen and societies have followed one another here, conquerors have marked this country with their petty officer's civilisation. They had a base and ridiculous idea of greatness and measured that of their Empire by the surface area that it covered. The miracle is that the ruins of their civilisation are the very negation of their ideal.77\n\nCamus' direct engagement and refutation of the Algerianism's use of physical remains is unambiguous in passages such as this one.\n\nThe Roman rhetoric of Algerianism was similar to the example of Fascist Italy, which also positioned itself as the successor to the Roman Empire in Africa.78 Pre-fascist Italian nationalism had employed the idea of modern Italy continuing the conquests of their ancient predecessors. Mussolini's government used Rome to legitimize its rule and ultimately to justify a continuation of Italian colonialism. Stone describes the importance of ‘Roman imperial motifs’ in Mussolini's military and cultural self-presentation.79 Particularly in the conquests of Ethiopia and Libya this visual language was used to convey a sense that modern Italy was continuing the ‘civilizing mission’ of Rome.80 Camus was aware of these attempts and they strongly reinforced his sense that ancient Rome was indelibly linked with imperialistic excess and military repression. The Algerianists' use of Rome and the concept of a Latin Africa put them on the same ideological plane as fascism in Camus' thought. This militaristic use of classics was a misrepresentation of the true Mediterranean spirit, as he would make clear in a 1937 speech:\n\nthere is only one culture. Not that which feeds on abstractions and capital letters. Not that which condemns. Not that which justifies the abuse and the deaths in Ethiopia and which legitimises the taste for brutal conquest. This one we know well and we reject.81\n\nThe Second World War pervades Camus' Absurd works, both in the underlying anxiety and despondency of the reflections on suicide in Le Mythe de Sisyphe and, more pertinently, in the dictatorial aspects of the character of Caligula. Rome's use in the rhetoric of colonialism and fascism fundamentally demonstrated a natural continuity for Camus between modern and ancient oppression. The specific choice of Caligula has even been linked to the Emperor's historical involvement with preserving the Roman rule of Algeria.82 Camus' reception of Rome in Caligula cannot be viewed outside this context.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is not enough simply to view Camus' affinity to Greece as a reaction against Rome, although placing Greece and Rome in binary opposition fundamentally strengthened his opinions of both. Greek thought had been introduced to Camus at a young age and he clearly had a natural affinity for it. He was an avid reader of André Malraux, André Gide and his philosophy teacher, the essayist Jean Grenier, all of whom used the concept of Greece and Greek myth in their work. One Algerian literary context is of specific importance however, and that is the concept of Mediterraneanism to which the young Camus was a keen adherent.\n\nMediterraneanism was a movement founded in the 1920s by Gabriel Audisio. Its ethos was simply that the Mediterranean people were unified by a culture and spirit that transcended nationalities and borders. Audisio is a figure whose importance amongst his contemporaries is obscured by his lack of prominence today. He was born in 1900, unlike Camus in mainland France, but came to Algeria as a young man. He introduced his ideas about Mediterranean culture in his 1933 essay Jeunesse de la Méditerranée that has been described as ‘a landmark in the cultural life of colonial Algeria’.83 He understood the Mediterranean to be\n\nnot a sea but a country. I go further, I say a homeland. And I specify that, for the peoples of this sea, there is only one true homeland, the sea itself, the Mediterranean.84\n\nThe unified Mediterranean allowed for a universal fraternity: in France, Italy, Spain, or Algeria, Audisio could feel foreign nowhere: ‘my country? Everywhere where there is sunlight’.85 Camus was strongly influenced by Audisio's writing as can clearly be felt in his own writings about the Mediterranean,\n\nThe men who howl in the singing cafes of Spain, who wander through the port of Genoa, on the quays of Marseille, this curious and strong race that lives on our coasts, they come from the same family.86\n\nFor both writers this Mediterranean culture was based on principles inherited from ancient Greece. Rodin argues that for Camus the Mediterranean and Greece were intrinsically linked and that he saw the modern Mediterranean as descended from their ancient Greek counterparts.87 Camus recognized these common antecedents and the sense of cultural priorities that united the Mediterranean people as the continuation of the Greek spirit in modern culture. He used ‘the closely related symbols “Greek” and “Mediterranean” interchangeably’ and in this sense they became co-dependent concepts in his thought, paradigms of freedom, moderation and the reverence of natural and artistic beauty.88 Watching labourers in Algiers enjoying the sea during their lunch, Camus saw\n\nToday … the young people racing on Mediterranean beaches rediscover the magnificent gestures of the athletes of Delos.89\n\nEqually the seafaring heroes of Audisio's Héliotrope were likened to the Odyssey, which was conceived as the ‘paradigmatic Mediterranean text’.90\n\nMediterraneanism, as a movement, was intended to confront the rhetoric of Algerianism directly. The emphasis on ancient Greece in Audisio and Camus' writing constituted a direct rebuke of Bertrand's use of Rome. Similarly, Dunwoodie describes the focus on the Mediterranean and its Greek rather than Latin nature as a means of ‘remapping a cultural space inherited from Greece and therefore relativizing the impact of Rome’.91 Rome's position as colonizer and subjugator was reinforced by the fact that it had colonized Greece itself, replacing the reverence of beauty, art, and natural limits with an excessive zeal for conquest and totality that had persisted into modern day. Camus' Graeco-Mediterraneanism was the spirit of classical virtue: Latinity was ‘not the true Mediterranean’ (O.C.I: 568). Audisio before had been equally emphatic: ‘Rome is not the Mediterranean’.92\n\nCamus' Mediterranean should be viewed in a dialectical relationship with both the rhetoric of Algerianism and the classical models of contemporary fascism. The integral opposition between Greece and Rome was grounded in Camus' interaction with these previous traditions and movements. The fact that Rome could be viewed as a Mediterranean culture itself was a paradox in this line of thought he steadfastly refused to engage with. The Mediterranean acted as a reclamation of classical culture which was being used elsewhere to justify imperialism and oppression. Rome, the tool of the colonialists and imperialists, had to be discarded. Camus' opposition between Greece and Rome was not a rhetorical device but rather a deeply rooted reaction to a history of receptions that had utilized the ancient world for political and social purposes.\n\nNevertheless, the exclusively European focus that underpinned the Mediterraneanist philosophy cannot be ignored. Lévi-Valensi correctly recognized that in its foundation in Romance language and classical history and ignorance of Arab and Berber culture, Camus' Mediterranean vision was fundamentally ethnocentric.93 Despite claims of an historical union between East and West in Algeria, the events of the 1950s would show Mediterranean assimilation to be a fundamentally untenable proposition. It is perhaps best to view it as an attempt to fuse the disparate parts of Camus' pied noir identity. He was ‘not French in the sense that he is north African … .nor is he Algerian or Arab’ but rather ‘an intruder, part of the colonial system’.94 Camus seemed more aware throughout his life of this sense of isolation. Watching a production of the Medea in Paris he wrote\n\nI cannot hear this language without crying … These words are mine, these feelings mine, this belief mine … ‘What a misfortune is the one of a man without a city’, ‘Oh make it so that I will not be without a city’. The choir said. I am without a city.95\n\nThe only identity Camus had was that of a French Algerian. In 1958 he wrote in his notebooks\n\nAlgeria obsesses me this morning. Too late, too late … my land is lost, I would be worth nothing.96\n\nThis fear provided a major motivation for Camus' silence on the question of Algerian independence, a silence for which he has been criticized as a colonialist writer, most notably by Edward Said.97 It was this shifting, uncertain identity that Camus' reliance on antiquity was intended to address. He could declare himself a son of Greece with a sense of simplicity with which he could never have declared himself a son of France or Algeria. Abbou describes Greece as the thread through the labyrinth of Camus' often-difficult life and it is precisely this personal reliance on the ancient world that separates him from his contemporaries.98 Rodin agrees that the sense of identity that Greece gave Camus was essential through his literature.99 Yet this identity could not provide a solution to the problems and contradictions of French Algeria. Greece remained a comfort to Camus, but ultimately little more than a fantasy.\n\nTo describe Camus as insensitive or indifferent to the future of the Arab population would be misleading, as can be seen by his journalistic treatment of the subject. His reports from Kabylie described the inequalities of French rule.100 He was particularly critical of the French role in regional famine, or as he described it ‘Buchenwald under the sun’.101 Yet he could not extend these critiques or his later calls for a ‘civil truce’ to a rejection of the idea of French Algeria.102 He simply believed that a continued union with France would be mutually beneficial to the European and Arab peoples, a misapprehension, but one that he tragically seemed powerless to escape. Events would quickly demonstrate the obsolescence of his calls for conciliation. Ultimately, like the protagonist of his short story L'Hôte, Camus had to face the realization that ‘in this vast country he had loved so much, he was alone’.103\n\nConclusion\n\nCamus' reception of the classical world was an essential component of his writing. Understanding the role classics played in his imagination gives a far deeper insight into his work than simply situating Caligula and Le Mythe de Sisyphe within the framework of his philosophy. Binary oppositions typified his work:\n\nmoderation and excess, beauty and ugliness, nature and history … these are the antitheses which sound throughout Camus's writing.104\n\nHis response to the classical world was perhaps his most personal and important of these. Camus' love of Greece and opposition to Rome fulfilled primal needs for the young writer, not only in his search for a sense of heritage but also in articulating his emphatic reaction against colonialist rhetoric and fascism. Algeria is a fascinating example of the role the reception of classics can play in colonial cultures. Camus may have rejected the conclusions of Algerianism but both ideologies were, through their reliance on European classics, imposing a cultural framework on a nation that was not European. Camus' conclusions are perhaps more palatable to modern tastes than those of Bertrand, but it is important to acknowledge the continuity between the two. Essentially, Camus' reliance on Greece was rooted in the instability of his own identity. This reliance went beyond the intellectual and was a deeply personal and emotional reaction. However, the problematic nature of this largely escaped him. The inability (or unwillingness) to see the continuity between Greece and Rome sadly reflects his inability to see the continuity between the Soviet occupation of Hungary (which he denounced) and the continuing French occupation of Algeria.\n\nThe first half of the twentieth century saw an explosion of the use of Greek mythology in European literature, particularly in France with writers like Camus, Cocteau, Anouilh, Giradoux, and Malraux. Sartre wrote about this generation that it represented a collective catharsis through myth. In the face of war and catastrophe the artist's role was ‘to forge myths, to project for the audience an enlarged and enhanced image of its own sufferings'.105 Camus' Sisyphus is perhaps one of the most moving evocations of this need to find analogues powerful enough to represent what these writers witnessed. Yet even in accepting this, a more complete understanding of Camus' recourse to Greek mythology must fundamentally consider the traditions he engaged with and refuted and the unique modalities of self-expression it allowed. Is it of great significance that he was reading a dictionary rather than Homer when composing Sisyphus? I would argue that it is not: to suggest that his reception was ever or could ever have been a direct line from antiquity, impervious to all other influences, neglects the true nature of his artistic dialogue with earlier receptions.\n\nCamus' use of the classical world was fundamentally informed by the political and social context in which he lived. Greece and Rome played specific, paradigmatic functions and were in a sense as mythical as Sisyphus. But, understanding and recognizing Camus' mythologizing goes to the heart of understanding his work. In Le Mythe de Sisyphe he wrote that ‘myths are made for the imagination to bring them to life’.106 It was not simply imagination, but his engagement with colonialism and fascism, his attempts to solve the problem of meaning without the divine and his facing the painful uncertainties of French Algeria that bought his myths to life — and, to this day, make his work vibrant, engaging and important to generations of readers.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all translations are my own.\n\nReferences\n\n© The Author 2011.
