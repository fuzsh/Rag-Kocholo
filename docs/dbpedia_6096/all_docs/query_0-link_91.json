        "text": "Impulsive behavior, nudity, and nonstop sex on the big screen feel like relics from the 1980s -- but that's not necessarily a bad thing ... for adults, anyway. With Monday, writer-director Argyris Papadimitropoulos has created a modern update on '80s-style grown-up romance and added a twist of reality, though it could send an iffy message to teens. Lovebirds Mickey and Chloe may have some sensibility when they're sober: Chloe is a confident attorney who establishes boundaries, and Mickey is a fun-loving musician who longs to spend more time with his son. But together, they make impetuous decisions in the heat of the moment, and for the most part, it doesn't catch up with them. They drink heavily, do drugs if available, and live a wondrous life of \"why not?\" The audience, it seems, is meant to be aghast at their irresponsibility, but we can't help but get caught up in it and wonder whether we, too, shouldn't live with a little more abandon.\n\nMasterful directing makes it easy to get caught up in the characters' romance, which is marked by audacity and adorable, sizzling banter. Most of the film doesn't dwell on the big issues. For instance: She's moving, and he wants her to stay. But we skip through the negotiation and instead spend all day with them as Chloe moves into Mickey's apartment. It's the little things that buoy a love affair, and we bask in it with them. And, as doubts seep in, we're right there, too. As much as we fall for Mickey and Chloe's love, we also fall in love with Greece. This isn't a drippingly gorgeous scenic travelogue; its appeal is in yard parties, beach swims, and even difficult advertising clients looking for a jingle imbued with just the right amount of Greekness. Unfortunately, the \"Friday\" and \"Monday\" timetable gets confusing to know just how much time has passed, and the film eventually drags a bit -- 20 minutes could have been cut out, and we'd all be the better for it. Still, Monday brings the heat for date night, as long as you can appreciate its warning against following your loins into love."
