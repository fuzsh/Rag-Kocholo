        "text": "There are plenty of movies about Greece to watch to help you get in the mood for a trip to the Mediterranean. In fact, it has been romantic Greek movies set on Cycladic islands, with whitewashed houses and handsome actors that have been the source of inspiration for many people who have suddenly decided to up and go to Greece.\n\nSimilarly, if you are not able to get over to Greece right now, your trip has been postponed, or anything else, you can live your dream Greece itinerary via one of the many movies set in this gorgeous country. The movies about Greece shortlisted here are broad.\n\nYour FREE Itinerary Template for Stress-Free Travel\n\nTired of travel overwhelm? Say goodbye to endless tabs, scattered notes, and the fear of missing out.\n\n​\n\nMy free itinerary template is your secret weapon for organized, personalized adventures.\n\nI respect your privacy. Unsubscribe at any time.\n\nSome are romantic comedies, designed to help your daydreams about someday moving to a remote Greek island, and falling in love. Others focus on Greek history or mythology.\n\nMovies About Greece to Watch\n\nWhen you mention movies about Greece, there are probably a few ultra-popular titles that immediately spring to mind. Namely, Mamma Mia, Shirley Valentine (at least for British audiences!), Zorba the Greek (a classic!), and 300.\n\nHowever, the reality is, that there are more movies set in Greece than people realise. Dozens of movies have been made over the past few decades that have Greek culture, history, mythology, and Greek gastronomy as focal points of the plot.\n\nSimilarly, there are plenty of movies set in Greece where the story isn’t all about Greece per se, but various filming locations are used around the country to depict paradisical islands and gorgeous natural scenery. Various Hollywood movies have used Greece as a backdrop.\n\nThe number of movies filmed here looks poised to increase in the coming years too. So while people flock to the Sporades and Volos to search for Mamma Mia filming locations currently, in the future, it may be other islands that movie fans venture to too.\n\nIn 2021, 18 international movies were shot in Greece, including the hugely successful Beckett. The Hellenic Cinema Center predicted that revenues from foreign productions shot in Greece in 2021 would hit €90 million ($106 million US).\n\nA diverse selection of movies about Greece is shortlisted below for your perusal. These are perfect for when you feel like enjoying your evening entertainment with shouts of ¨oppa!”, plate smashing, and loud folk music.\n\nShirley Valentine\n\nA few decades ago, Shirley Valentine was the movie that inspired droves of women that they must up and pack their bags and travel to Greece immediately. The movie follows the story of Shirley, a bored housewife from Northern England.\n\nUnhappy with her mediocre life and marriage, she travels to Mykonos, the Cyclades, and meets a dashing local named Kostas. Will Shirley stay in Mykonos or be lured back home by the great British rain?\n\nThis short movie is witty and lighthearted. It may be particularly enjoyable for you if you are also British.\n\nSome of the humorous portrayals of British people, the way they act abroad, and their dry, sarcastic sense of humour are spot on, even to this day. One of the Mykonos beaches where the movie was filmed has been informally renamed as ¨the Shirley Valentine beach¨\n\nMamma Mia\n\nIf it was Shirley Valentine that inspired women to travel to Greece in the late eighties and early nineties, it was Mamma Mia! That followed suit in the noughties. The Hollywood Blockbuster is the movie adaption of the broadway musical of the same name.\n\nMamma Mia tells the story of Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) and her mother (Meryl Streep) as they prepare for Sophie’s wedding. The only issue?\n\nSophie does not know who her father is and there are three possibilities. So, she invites them all!\n\nThe movie is set on the fictional island of kalokairi. The real-life location of this is the little island of Skopelos in the Sporades.\n\nHollywood movie directors scoured dozens of Greek islands looking for the perfect setting before settling for Skopelos. The island, with its pristine beaches and awe-inspiring nature and hiking trails, is the greenest in the Mediterranean.\n\nIt is possible to visit all of the Mamma Mia filming locations while in the area. The film was shot at various locations across Skopelos beaches, Skiathos town, Volos, and Pelion. Arguably the most famous location is the clifftop church of Agios Ioannis Kastri in the northern part of the island.\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding follows the life of Toula (Nia Vardalos), a Greek-American waiter living in Chicago. Toula is constantly a disappointment in her very traditional Greek parents’ eyes on account of the fact that she is over 30 and not yet married or a mother.\n\nThis disapproval only increases when she meets a non-Greek partner (John Corbett). The movie is very funny, particularly as it discusses the cultural differences between Greeks and westerners.\n\nYou may find it especially relatable if you are of Greek heritage, or you are someone dating a Greek man or woman. There is also a sequel to the movie: My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2.\n\nBeckett\n\nBeckett, released in 2021, is an action movie starring John David Washington, Boyd Holbrook, Vicky Krieps, and Alicia Vikander. Washington plays an American tourist that travels to Greece on vacation with his girlfriend. Unfortunately, he finds himself involved in a tragic car accident that makes him the focus of a political conspiracy and forces him to go on the run.\n\nThe movie was filmed on location in various areas of Northern Greece, including the Thessaly region, Ioannina, Trikala, Zagori, and the ancient city of Delphi. Washington’s character has to try to get to Athens, in order to reach the American Embassy and clear his name.\n\nAfter its release, the movie quickly shot to the number 1 most streamed movie on Netflix in various countries around the globe. Beckett is not a true story, but it is so fast-paced and anxiety-inducing that it will have you on the edge of your seat all the way through!\n\nThe movie, which premiered at the 74th Locarno Film Festival, may not have a main focus on the nature of Greece. However, some of these lesser-known gems around the country make a great backdrop to a compelling story.\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 2\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 2, released in 2016, is the much-anticipated sequel to the first Big Fat Greek Wedding movie. Set years after the original move, Toula and her husband Ian are struggling with the challenges that come with parenting, particularly in an intercultural relationship.\n\nTheir teen daughter, Elena, in particular, struggles to identify with Greek traditions and aspects of Greek culture, as a Greek American kid. Arguably the movie struggles to live up to expectations after the popularity of the first movie.\n\nStill, it’s a light-hearted, easy-to-watch, and funny movie regardless. Better still?\n\nThe producers have confirmed that Nia Vardalos and John Corbett will be returning to their roles for a third movie. In August 2022, the cast headed to Athens to conduct filming and the principal photography for the movie.\n\nAs of yet, the directors have kept things pretty quiet about the storyline and the specific filming locations of the new movie. However, they have confirmed that several islands, as well as the Greek mainland, will be the filming locations.\n\nRise\n\nRise (aka the ¨Greek Freak movie¨) is a 2022 movie set in Greece that follows the true story of NBA player Giannis Antetokounmpo. Antetokounmpo currently plays for the Milwaukee Bucks in the US.\n\nSince moving to the United States to play basketball professionally, his speed and skills have gained him a lot of recognition as one of the best basketball players of all time. Since he is of Nigerian roots and grew up in Greece, his huge success has made him the pride of Greece, Nigeria, and the US.\n\nThis is particularly true due to his humble beginnings. Antetokounmpo grew up in Sepolia, a somewhat rundown and less-than-desirable Athenian neighborhood.\n\nHe and his two brothers moved to Greece with their parents Vera and Charles Antetokounmpo, who sought a better life and better opportunities for their children. Rise is a heartwarming and inspiring rags-to-riches story that is fun to watch, even if you aren’t a sports fan.\n\nThe movie has been filmed in various Athens neighborhoods including Monastiraki, Zografou, Psiri, and several Athens hotels. If you have visited the Greek capital before, you will find it fun to try and recognize the different parts of town.\n\nKnives Out 2\n\nKnives Out 2 is set for international release in November 2022. (Its official new name is Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery).\n\nThe movie sees Tech Billionaire Miles Bron (played by Edwards Norton) head out to his private Greek island with his friends for the weekend. After someone dies, a detective (played by Daniel Craig) is called up to investigate.\n\nFilming took place on the gorgeous island of Spetses, Greece – a lesser-known paradise with phenomenal natural scenery that sits just 3 hours away from Athens in the Argolic Gulf. This is a fast-paced action movie that has a much-anticipated arrival after the success of the first Knives Out movie.\n\nThe backdrop of beautiful blue seas, luxurious Greek villas with huge pools and terraces, and dense woodland is enough to inspire anyone to visit Greece. Little Spetses, is one of the closest islands to Athens\n\nIt is home to just 4,000 people and outside of the main settlement (Spetses town), the island is essentially just one big national park. No cars are permitted on the island, and the best way to get around is by renting a bicycle or an ATV.\n\nThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\n\nThe 2005 movie ¨The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants¨ starring Blake Lively and Alexis Bledel is one of the best movies about Greece for younger viewers. It is based on the book of the same name.\n\nThe movie sees four best girlfriends who want to remain in each other’s lives as they grow older and start to move in different directions. One girl heads to Mexico, another to Greece, and two of the girls stay in the US.\n\nThey are all the same dress size, so they share a pair of jeans that fit them all, and the jeans make their journey across the world. What may be a somewhat gross concept, actually translates into a fun and uplifting movie about friendships and getting older.\n\nThe Greece scenes of the movie are set in Santorini. More specifically, picturesque Oia and Ammoudi Bay. The second movie, shot in 2018, is also filmed in Santorini.\n\nXenia\n\nXenia, a 2014 drama movie directed by Panos H. Koutras, tells the story of two Albanian teenagers in search of their Greek father. After their mother, an Albanian singer, passes away, they embark on a road trip across Greece to search for their father.\n\nThe film explores many important topics affecting modern Greece today. For instance, the relationship between Greece and Albania, the perception of Albanians in Greece, as well as LGBTQI+ issues.\n\nOne of the brothers, Dany is gay. Although some areas in Greece (e.g. Skiathos) are known for being LGBTQI friendly, the country on the whole still has a long way to go before this community sees equality. So, to have a gay man as the main character is important.\n\nThe movie was filmed in various locations across Greece. The abandoned Xenia hotel set was in Kozani, a scene where the two teens are on a boat at night was filmed on the Pineios River in the Peloponnese.\n\nPiraeus, the Athens Acropolis, and central Thessaloniki all also make appearances. Xenia was selected to compete in the 2014 Cannes film festival and the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nThe Trip to Greece\n\nThe Trip to Greece is a 2020 British comedy movie featuring British comedy legends Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. They set off to beautiful Greece to follow in the footsteps of Odysseus as he made his way home from Troy.\n\nThe movie was filmed in several locations in Greece and on Turkey’s north-west Aegean coast. Their Turkey itinerary starts in the ruins of Troy in Hisarlik. From there, they head to Assos, just opposite the Greek island of Lesbos to see the famous Moria refugee camp, then board a boat to Kavala.\n\nThe ruins of Ancient Stagira (the birthplace of Aristotle) are up next. Then, the duo continues onwards to the villages of Pinakates and Damouchari in the Pelion, the ruins of Ancient Delphi, the UNESCO-protected Theatre of Epidaurus, Hydra, the Mani peninsula, Kefalonia island, and Ithaca. Phew.\n\nThroughout the journey, the pair squabble comedically about all manner of Greek cultural topics. The Trip to Greece will inspire you to visit off-the-beaten-track parts of Greece that you have perhaps never heard of.\n\nLara Croft Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life\n\nThe first Tomb Raider movie, Cradle of Life, was filmed in 2003 and starred Angelina Jolie (as Lara) and Gerard Butler. Lara is tasked with retrieving Pandora’s box before it is found by a man who plans to use it as a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nThe movie was arguably not met with a lot of positive reviews and enthusiasm when it was first released. However, fans of the Tomb Raider game series will no doubt enjoy it, and it does contain lots of fast-paced action and stunts.\n\nIt was filmed in numerous exotic locations around the world, including China, Wales, England, Hong Kong, and Kenya. The opening scene was filmed in Santorini, Greece.\n\nA Touch of Spice (Politiki Kouzina)\n\nIf you are looking for wonderful movies about Greece that are actually Greek, showcase excellent Greek actors, and provide insight into the country´s culture and issues, you will enjoy A Touch of Spice (Politiki Kouzina). The movie follows the story of a young Greek boy that grew up in Istanbul, Turkey, and leaves the country to return to Greece due to political turmoil.\n\nIt explores a topic that is still a sensitive matter of discussion for most Greeks today. Namely, the tumultuous relationship between Greece and Turkey.\n\nEl Greco\n\nEl Greco is a 2007 movie directed by Yannis Smaragdis. It is a biographical film about the life of Greek Painter Domenicos Theotokopoulos, known internationally as ¨El Greco¨.\n\nRenowned contemporary Greek actors such as Dimitra Matsouka and Dina Konsta play some of the main roles. So too, do Greek actors that rose to fame during the 1960s golden era of Greek cinema.\n\n(For instance Sotiris Moustakas and Katerina Helmi.) El Greco himself is played by British actor Nick Ashdon. The Greek scenes of the movie were filmed in locations in Heraklion, Crete, Rhodes, and Athens.\n\nSummer Lovers\n\nSummer Lovers is a 1982 movie directed by Randal Kleiser that explores the themes of love, lust, and temptation in long-term relationships. The story follows an American couple that visits Greece on vacation and befriends a young French woman.\n\nPeter Gallagher, Daryl Hannah, and Valerie Quennessen play the main character roles. The movie was filmed in Santorini so the backdrop of the scenes is always made up of idyllic white-washed traditional houses and gorgeous beaches. The movie, and the classic 80s music that makes up the soundtrack, perfectly capture the people that travelled to Greece in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n300\n\n¨This. Is. Spartaaaa.¨ 300 is the shockingly inaccurate Greek history movie that followed King Leonidas and the Spartans during the Battle of Thermopylae. While the Battle of Thermopylae was indeed a real battle that took place in Ancient Greece in 480 BC, the movie is not true to historical facts.\n\nIt is based on the comic of the same name by American Comic Book Artist Frank Miller. Regardless, it is gory, action-packed, and engaging to watch.\n\nBetter yet, it inspired new generations to learn more about ancient Greek history and travel to the country’s historical sites. The city of Sparta in Lakonia, Peloponnese was the home of the Spartans.\n\nAlthough it is unfortunately not so well preserved today, there are numerous archaeological sites and museums around the city that are worth visiting if you should find yourself in the area. Nearby, you can also visit the charming Byzantine city of Mystras.\n\nZorba the Greek\n\nZorba the Greek is a timeless classic. This award-winning movie filmed in 1964 follows the story of an English Writer that travels to Greece, befriends an elderly local man, and falls in love with a local woman.\n\nDespite being shot in black and white and now being somewhat dated, this should be high on your list of classic movies about Greece to watch when planning your first Greek adventure. The movie is particularly famous for its theme music ¨sirtaki¨.\n\nEven if you haven’t heard of or seen this movie, you have most likely heard sirtaki. This instrumental music starts off slowly and gradually gets faster and faster.\n\nToday, the associated dance is one of the most renowned Greek dances. However it was actually created specifically for the movie! The music is regularly played at Greek tavernas, and in touristic districts like Plaka, Athens, or Thissio.\n\nZorbas the Greek was set and filmed in Crete. Notable filming locations include Chania, Kokkino Chorio village, and Stavros beach, Akrotiri.\n\nClash of the Titans\n\nDespite all of the weird and wonderful Greek mythology stories out there, there are shockingly few movies that tell them. One movie that changed that was the 1981 Clash of the Titans.\n\nThe movie loosely (very, very loosely) tells the story of Perseus. The Greek hero ventures across Greece to kill the Kraken, a giant mythical sea monster.\n\nThe movie was actually filmed on location in Spain, Malta, and at movie studios in London, UK. However, regardless, it was the movie that inspired many to learn more about Greek myths.\n\nToday, some of the CGI and makeup effects are both dated and comical. In its day, some of the characters in the original Clash of the Titans movie, particularly the snake-haired Medusa, terrified younger generations.\n\nThe Clash of the Titans is still very worth a watch. In 2010, the movie was remade, and the remake essentially follows the same story.\n\nWrath of the Titans\n\nWrath of the Titans was released in 2012 as a sequel to the Clash of the Titans remake. It once again joins Perseus as he ventures into the Underworld to save Zeus who has been captured by Hades and Ares. In doing so, he hopes to save Mankind.\n\nThere are many mythological inaccuracies in this movie. It has essentially taken the names of Greek mythology figures and nothing more.\n\nSo, if you are an avid follower of Greek myths and legends, you may be disgruntled or downright irritated. Sadly, the movie also received fairly negative feedback and reviews.\n\nThis is not a terrible movie to watch if you just want some easygoing, action-inspired viewing. It’s something you can have on in the background without having to concentrate too much.\n\nLike its predecessor, Wrath of the Titans was not filmed in Greece. It was filmed mostly in Tenerife and Wales.\n\nTroy\n\nThe 2004 Troy movie directed by Wolfgang Petersen is based on Homer’s ¨The Iliad¨. For many Grecophiles, literary aficionados, and history buffs, the Iliad is one of the best books about Greece and it is something of a right of passage.\n\nThe movie ¨Troy¨ deviates massively from Homer’s writing. This meant that the movie was heavily criticised and disappointing for many.\n\nTroy tells the story of the 10-year Trojan war, with Brad Pitt playing the hero ¨Achilles¨. Regardless of its imperfections, it is an enjoyable action movie about the Greek wars.\n\nGreed\n\nThe 2019 movie Greed is a British satirical comedy. It follows a billionaire fashion tycoon as he throws a yacht party in Mykonos designed to help him improve his reputation.\n\nThe movie has aspirations of light-heartedly questioning capitalism, the existence of billionaires, and the lifestyles of the super-rich. Although in parts, it seems a little unsure as to the direction it is following.\n\nRegardless, it’s an amusing watch, and it stars a number of notable British Comedians and Comedy Actors. Not to mention, Mykonos, displayed in all its glory, is a spectacular backdrop.\n\nMy Life in Ruins\n\nMy Life in Ruins is a romantic comedy set in Greece starring Nia Vardalos, of ¨My Big Fat Greek Wedding¨ fame. Vardalos plays tour guide Georgia who is tired of showing obnoxious tourists around the Acropolis, the Agora, and other touristic sites of Greece.\n\nThat is until she meets a handsome Greek bus driver that changes her perspective. Not only is the movie uplifting, light-hearted, and fun to watch, but it also showcases some of the very best landmarks in Greece.\n\nIf you have just booked a trip to Greece and you want to see a movie that will get you in the mood to go, My Life in Ruins is undoubtedly one of the best movies about Greece.\n\nMamma Mia 2: Here We Go Again\n\nMamma Mia ¨Here we go again¨ is the second installment of the Hollywood Blockbuster ¨Mamma Mia¨. It is simultaneously a prequel and a sequel to the first movie.\n\nIn this movie, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is expecting her first child while struggling to run her mother´s guesthouse. The film alternates between the present day and flashbacks to her mother’s younger life.\n\nWhile Mamma Mia 2 is set once again on the fictional Greek island of Kalokairi, it was actually filmed in Vis, Croatia. The movie directors cited Greek bureaucracy, costs, and taxes as the reason for the move.\n\nThe Big Blue\n\nThe 1998 movie ¨The Big Blue¨ is an English-language movie by French director Luc Besson. It was originally released with the French title ¨Le Grand Bleu¨ and is based on the true story of two childhood friends Jacques Mayol, and Italian Enzo Maiorca.\n\nThe friends try to compete and outdo each other at free-diving in different destinations around the world. Although the movie has been heavily hyperbolised from the true story, it is still one of the best deep-sea diving movies in existence.\n\nThe Big Blue was filmed at a number of gorgeous locations around the world, including the little Greek island of Amorgos. In the background of some of the scenes, you can see Agia Anna and the monastery of Panagia Hozoviotissa.\n\nAt the time, The Big Blue was a huge box office hit and encouraged thousands of French tourists to vacation in the Cyclades and go Greek island hopping. Aside from that though, Amorgos remains relatively off the beaten track. It is a great island to visit if you prefer quieter islands.\n\nRembetiko\n\nRembetiko (Ρεμπέτικο) is a 1983 Greek film produced by Costas Ferris and Sotiria Leonardou. It was filmed in Greek but has English subtitles. It is essentially a Greek history movie with a twist.\n\nWhile other Greek history films may focus on Greek wars, the struggle for independence, or Ancient Greece, Rembetiko follows the stories of musicians called Rembetes.\n\nRembetiko could be described as being the Greek version of the Blues. Today, it is still possible to enjoy Rembetiko.\n\nSome tavernas and restaurants around the country host live musicians to entertain their patrons as they dine. Similarly, you will often find it played out over loudspeakers in a lot of bars and eateries.\n\nThe movie follows the events in Greece that took place between 1917 to 1956. It provides a great glimpse into Greek culture, while simultaneously allowing you to enjoy Greek music and dancing.\n\nBoy on a Dolphin\n\nIn 1957, Italian screen goddess Sophia Loren and a team of American producers and directors flew to Greece to film ¨Boy on a Dolphin¨. This was the very first American movie to ever be filmed in Greece.\n\nSophia’s character Phaedra is an impoverished Greek sponge diver who finds a statue of a boy riding a dolphin while diving in the Aegean sea. After her discovery, she is torn between giving it to a man that wants to sell it, and a man who wants to give it as a gift to Greece.\n\nThis movie was filmed throughout Greece, and various beautiful destinations act as the backdrop. That includes the little island of Hydra in the Saronic Gulf and notable museums of Athens. While watching, it is interesting to see how much these Greek destinations have changed throughout the last few decades.\n\nSophia Loren was open about her love of Greece. She would often vacation in the upscale region of Vouliagmeni and the Athens Riviera in its early days. Upon arrival in Greece to film the movie, she was met with huge crowds.\n\nAlexander\n\nAlexander (2004) is a historical drama that aims to tell the story of the life and conquests of Alexander the Great. The real-life Alexander III of Macedon was born in the city of Pella, Northern Greece.\n\nHe ruled over Macedonia for less than 13 years. However, he certainly made an impact during his rule.\n\nAlexander the Great conquered and invaded a vast amount of countries. He travelled from Macedonia and Greece to Egypt and India. In doing so, he spread Hellenistic culture across the world.\n\nHis birthplace, Pella is a wonderful place to visit on a day trip from Thessaloniki. Despite its historical and cultural significance, the Central Macedonia region of Greece is often overlooked by tourists, who prefer to see the historical sites of Athens, Delphi, and Olympia.\n\nThe Alexander movie emphasises why this region, and this particular ruler, were so important in shaping Greece’s history. Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, and Jared Leto star in this movie.\n\nHowever, sadly, it was an international flop.
