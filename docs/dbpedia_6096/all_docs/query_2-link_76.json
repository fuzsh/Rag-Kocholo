        "text": "Cinema as an influencing medium has had immense impact on mass psyche. It evidently plays a huge role in the whole making and unmaking process of a destination. In yesteryears, it had been travelogues. That remains true. But movie as a medium has evidently reached a greater population.\n\nEven before I had an iota of idea of Greece as a nation state, I knew about the heydays of mighty Greek civilization. The conquests of Alexander the great, whom we Indians call as the Iskandar. His army and tribesmen remain in the safe haven of the Himalayas, at the mystic Aryan valley of Kargil. I could easily visualize the rise and fall of many Greek empires,\n\nRomantic escapades of the princesses, politics and conspiracies of prime characters at the backdrop of the great Greek epic, Iliad and Odyssey. I get goosebumps even till this day, thinking of the demons and the wrath of the Greek Gods. Growing up, I found them coming live on the TV screen, in the form of many movies. The Greek culture and rich food heritage intrigued me. I closely followed many visual manifestations of the Greek cultural celebration. Thus, the economic crisis of Greece back in 2016 felt personal to me, as I prepared my notes for a presentation at the MBA school. Where are you, Alexander? I almost whispered!\n\nAnyway, here is a compilation of the movies that will take you through the cultural heritage of Greece. Not just a nation full of beautiful scenic islands, Greece is the birthplace of one of the iconic and oldest human civilizations on this Earth! These movies are a proud portrayal of Greece! Watch them before you plan a trip of a lifetime to Greece and you will have an immersive experience during your travels in the offbeat Greek landscapes!\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002)\n\nIMDB: 6.6\n\nDirected by Zoel Zwick, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is relatable for multiple reasons. Here is a American woman with Greek ancestry who falls for a non Greek man. She struggles to make her family accept the man and arranges for an Old Orthodox Christian wedding. All the while, her father, who is the sweetest father on the earth in my honest opinion, is afraid his daughter will be leaving behind her cultural heritage and Greek identity. I related the most with her father in the entire movie!\n\nThe movie is not exactly set in Greece. However, there is ample example of Greek culinary heritage. The best part is there is a wedding, a Greek wedding with endless laughter, an elaborate large family, and plenty of food and Greek moonshine! You should totally watch it if you love familial celebrations! I am an Asian woman. I loved it!\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding is filmed in English. There is a sequel to the film, which has more appearance by the father. The movie is shot in America. The backdrop, dresses, food, lifestyle: everything is American. However, the human values, religious adherence, historical anecdotes, like the grandmother cursing the Turkish invaders, the father over emphasizing on a Greek nuptial bond: all reminds you of a land they have been uprooted from. despite that, their love for Greece is overpowering!\n\nI recommend this movie as a light family watch, as it is a romantic family drama.\n\nShirley Valentine (1989)\n\nIMDb: 7.2\n\nDirected by Lewis Gilbert, Shirley Valentine is a British Romantic Comedy. The film portrays the mundane life of a British housewife in her early 40s. However, she joins her friend on a trip to Greece. That decision legit changed her life! The journey to Greece actually proved to be an inward journey for Shirley where she found her inner self, and agreed to shed many inhibitions. The swimming scene where she is baring herself in the sea for the lack of a swimsuit is actually a metaphor for her celebrating herself for what she is!\n\nIt is a beautiful film that makes you feel good about yourself, and reinstates it is possible to restart life and set new priorities beyond societal conditioning!\n\nThe backdrop of the film looks dreamy indeed as it was mostly filmed at a few of the finest beaches of Mykonos island in Greece.\n\nShirley valentine was portrayed by Paulline Collins who won an Academy award for her portrayal of the protagonist.\n\nKazantzakis (2017)\n\nIMDB: 6.2\n\nKazantzakis is a biographical film based on the life of prominent author Nikos Kazantzakis set in Crete. The film has garnered mixed reviews from the critics due to production design.\n\nBoy on a Dolphin (1957)\n\nIMDB rating: 6.2\n\nThe first Hollywood film shot in Greece, Boy on a Dolphin is a classic adventure film. Set in the island of Hydra, Phaedra, a diver finds a lost Greek statue of a boy standing on dolphin from the bed of Aegean Sea! The statue is believed to bring fortune for the city of Hydra but bidders dealing with historic artefacts are keen of procuring the heritage. You will get glimpses of destinations like Athens, Rhodes and Delos, Cinecittà in Rome, the Eastern Orthodox monastery complex at Metéora.\n\nThere’s a tale that they tell of a dolphin\n\nAnd a boy made of gold.\n\nWith the shells and the pearls in the deep,\n\nHe has lain many years fast asleep\n\nWhat they tell of the boy on a dolphin,\n\nWho can say if it’s true?\n\nShould he rise from the depths of the ocean,\n\nAny wish that you wish may come true.\n\nYou say “he’s only a statue, and what can a statue achieve?”\n\nAnd yet, while I’m gazing at you,\n\nMy heart tells my head to believe.\n\nIf the boy whom the gods have enchanted\n\nShould arise from the sea,\n\nAnd the wish of my heart could be granted,\n\nI would wish that you loved only me.\n\nWhat is this thing they call love\n\nBefore Midnight (2013)\n\nIMDB: 7.9\n\nIf I am to name one movie that has inspired me to travel to Europe, and that is not a war film, it has to be Before Sunrise series! Two strangers meet on their way in Paris, they explore each other and the city together and thus, they start to share a beautiful relationship which eventually progressed towards a nuptial bond. What could be more romantic than this?\n\nThe lovers Jesse and Celine have grown older. Their fine and smooth faces are now painted in wrinkles and tiredness that is inevitable at 40s. They are parents of a twin who give them a run for energy. Love is now subtle connector between the couple. The wounds and hurts are more evident as they have matured in their relationship. An interesting conversation unfolds as they spend an idyllic vacation in Peloponnese. they look back at life, at the playful days of youth when they had impulsively de-boarded a train and embarked on a surprising journey that brought these two humans closer!\n\nBefore Midnight draws a perfect end to one of the best romantic trilogies of our time! We literally grew with the couple, believed in the ever after and when we are to near the happily ever after we are prepared how distant it is from the made up romance. rather, reconciliation and love as a bond is based of accepting the imperfect yet beautiful conjugal survival!\n\nDo watch Before Midnight. Not just this but watch the whole trilogy! It would remain as one of your most intriguing cinematic experience ever!\n\nThe Big Blue (1988)\n\nIMDB: 7.6\n\nShot at the Greek island of Amorgos, The Big Blue is a French film. It is a cult classic among the divers’ fraternity, telling the gripping story of two divers who remained friends since childhood yet somehow got entangled in the diving rivalry. The film drew inspiration from real life famous divers: Jacques Mayol and Enzo Maiorca. The film portrays beautiful images from underwater, showcases human aquatic potential and empathy between friends at extreme situations. I absolutely adore the metaphor shown through the dolphin by the end of the film, that takes life back to the sea!\n\nMy Life In Ruins (2009)\n\nIMDb: 5.9\n\nA romantic comedy set in the ruins of ancient Greece, My life in Ruins tells the tale of a tour guide. The film was briefly shot at Acropolis. the film revolves around the story of an ex teacher who lost her teaching job and is struggling to hold on to the new job which clearly tastes her capacity to cope and adjust. the backdrop of the film lets you take a sneak peak to the ancient wonders of Greece, like Olympics or Parthenon etc. Nia Vardalos, who starred in My Big Fat Greek Wedding appears in this film yet again however could not please the critics like before. You would know why if you watch the film. I do not complain though since I get to see Greece nonetheless!\n\nHercules (2014)\n\nIMDb: 6\n\nBased on a graphic novel on the same name, Hercules is a million USD budget Hollywood film based on a fictional adventure of the iconic Greek hero! The movie Hercules as the name suggests is based on fantasy genre. As the story suggests, Hercules the son of Zeus and a Greek woman travels as a mercenary for payment in gold. However, he emerges as a true warrior when the time comes to save the kingdom of Thrace against savages! If you love entertaining movies with great locales serving as a backdrop for the shoot, this movie is for you. Though the movie was shot mostly in Hungary and Italy, it has many Greek cultural nuances.\n\nCaptain Correlli’s Mandolin (2001)\n\nIMDb: 5.9\n\nThe azure blue waves of the beautiful Greek island Kefalonia served as the backdrop of Captain Corelli’s Mandolin, a movie based in Greece! It is one thing I looked up for the movie to watch Penelope Cruise on screen. I just love this beautiful woman.\n\nLove blossoms between a Greek local girl and an Italian commander at the onset on world war two. However, the woman protagonist has already given her word to a Greek man who has set on sail to fight the war. Tumultuous days of world war two follows with myriad course of battles won and lost. Overall, Captain Corelli’s Mandolin is a story of love and forgiveness in the face of an all engulfing war!\n\nSami, Antisamos beach and the surrounding hills became world famous in ensuing days as the filming location for this iconic film. The film is based on the novel of the same name written by British author Louis de Bernières, who elaborated a fictional story from the time of German and Italian occupation.\n\nMamma Mia (2008)\n\nIMDb: 6.4\n\nMamma Mia was shot at the beautiful Greek island of Skopelos. The movie revolves around the protagonist girl inviting three men for her wedding and wishes to rekindle her mother’s lost love. The mother is portrayed by none other than the immensely graceful, Meryl Streep who is the only saving grace of this otherwise lousy rom com. However, I watched the movie only to gawk at the incredible beauty of the island living of this small Greek village (Skepelos village and Pelion region).\n\nZorba the Greek (1964)\n\nIMDb: 6.4\n\nBased in the beautiful greek island of Crete, Zorba the Greek is a B&W classic adapted from the novel Zorba the Greek; by Nikos Kazantza. You also get to see glimpses of the city of Chania, the village of Kokkino Chorio in the Apokoronas region and Stavros beach in the Akrotiri peninsula in the movie. It is a Greek comedy Drama and remains timeless in its appeal.\n\nSisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)\n\nIMDb: 2005\n\nThe American comedy drama adapted by the novel of the same name is a story about friendship with explicit sexual content. A large part of the movie was shot at the dreamy Santorini island of Greece. I sat through a couple of hours only to have glimpses of that ethereal backdrop!\n\nMediterraneo (1991)\n\nA group of Italian soldier from World War two gets stranded on an island on the aegean sea. The story unfolds with them eventually gelling well into the local greek way of life. It is a feel good movie set against stunning locales as backdrop.\n\nThe movie is filmed at the beautiful Greek island Mighisti.\n\nIMDb: 7.5\n\nPercy Jackson and Sea of Monsters (2013)\n\nIMDb: 5.8\n\nThe film adaption of the Greek mythology reinstates anyone with right moral compass can emerge as victorious and become the hero everyone worships.

I wont talk more about it in the fear of giving out spoilers!\n\nFor Your Eyes Only (1981)\n\nIMDb: 6.7\n\nA Bond movie set in yester years, For your Eyes Only is about the 007 agent finding a missing British vessel.
