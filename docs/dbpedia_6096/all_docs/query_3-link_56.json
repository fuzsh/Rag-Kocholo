        "text": "Introduction\n\nAncient Greek civilization—“the glory that was Greece,” in the words of Edgar Allan Poe—was short-lived and confined to a very small geographic area. Yet it has influenced the growth of Western civilization far out of proportion to its size and duration. In ancient times, Greece was not a country in the modern sense but a collection of several hundred independent cities, each with its surrounding countryside. Since these cities were independent political units, they are known as city-states. In Greek, the word for city-state is polis, and the English word politics comes from it.\n\nThe Greece that Poe praised was primarily the city-state of Athens during its golden age in the 5th century bc. The English poet John Milton called Athens “the eye of Greece, mother of arts and eloquence.” Athens was a city-state in which the arts, philosophy, and democracy flourished. It attracted those who wanted to work, speak, and think in an environment of freedom. In the rarefied atmosphere of Athens were born ideas about human nature and political society that are fundamental to the Western world today.\n\nAthens was not all of Greece, however. Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, and Thessalonica were but a few of the many other city-states that existed on the rocky and mountainous peninsula at the southern end of the Balkans. Each city-state vied with the others for power and wealth. These city-states planted Greek colonies in Asia Minor, on many islands in the Aegean Sea, and in southern Italy and Sicily.\n\nThe Beginnings of Ancient Greece\n\nThe story of ancient Greece began between 1900 and 1600 bc. At that time the Greeks—or Hellenes, as they called themselves—were simple nomadic herdsmen. Their language shows that they were a branch of the Indo-European-speaking peoples. They came from the grasslands east of the Caspian Sea, driving their flocks and herds before them. They entered the peninsula from the north, one small group after another.\n\nThe first invaders were the fair-haired Achaeans of whom Homer wrote. The Dorians came perhaps three or four centuries later and subjugated their Achaean kinsmen. Other tribes, the Aeolians and the Ionians, found homes chiefly on the islands in the Aegean Sea and on the coast of Asia Minor.\n\nThe land that these tribes invaded—the Aegean Basin—was the site of a well-developed civilization. The people who lived there had cities and palaces. They used gold and bronze and made pottery and paintings.\n\nThe Greek invaders were still in the barbarian stage. They plundered and destroyed the Aegean cities. Gradually, as they settled and intermarried with the people they conquered, they absorbed some of the Aegean culture.\n\nLife of the Early Wanderers\n\nLittle is known of the earliest stages of Greek settlement. The invaders probably moved southward from their pasturelands along the Danube, bringing their families and primitive goods in rough oxcarts. Along the way they grazed their herds. In the spring they stopped long enough to plant and harvest a single crop. Gradually they settled down to form communities ruled by kings and elders.\n\nThe background of the two great Greek epics—the Iliad and the Odyssey—is the background of the Age of Kings (see Homeric legend). These epics depict the simple, warlike life of the early Greeks. The Achaeans had excellent weapons and sang stirring songs. Such luxuries as they possessed, however—gorgeous robes, jewelry, elaborate metalwork—they bought from the Phoenician traders.\n\nThe Greek City-States and Their Colonies\n\nThe Iliad tells how Greeks from many city-states—among them, Sparta, Athens, Thebes, and Argos—joined forces to fight their common foe Troy in Asia Minor (see Trojan War). In historical times the Greek city-states were again able to combine when the power of Persia threatened them. However, ancient Greece never became a nation. The only patriotism the ancient Greek knew was loyalty to his city. This seems particularly strange today, as the cities were very small. Athens was probably the only Greek city-state with more than 20,000 citizens.\n\nThe city-state was made possible by Mediterranean geography. Because of the mountainous and coastal landscape, every little fishing village had to be able to defend itself against attack from land or sea, because outside help could not reach it easily. A person was thus dependent on his community for physical as well as economic survival. Each city-state was an economic, cultural, and religious organization. Each was also a self-governing community capable of maintaining its independence by enlisting its men as soldiers.\n\nSome Greek city-states were separated by mountain ranges. In many cases, however, a single plain contained several city-states, each surrounding its acropolis, or citadel. These flattopped, inaccessible rocks or mounds are characteristic of Greece and were first used as places of refuge. From the Corinthian isthmus rose the lofty acrocorinthus, from Attica the Acropolis of Athens, from the plain of Argolis the mound of Tiryns, and, loftier still, the Larissa of Argos. On these rocks the Greek cities built their temples and their king’s palace, and their houses clustered about the base.\n\nOnly in a few cases did a city-state push its holdings beyond very narrow limits. Athens held the whole plain of Attica, and most of the Attic villagers were Athenian citizens. Argos conquered the plain of Argolis. Sparta made a conquest of Laconia and part of the fertile plain of Messenia. The conquered people were subjects, not citizens. Thebes attempted to be the ruling city of Boeotia but never quite succeeded.\n\nSimilar city-states were found all over the Greek world, which had early flung its outposts throughout the Aegean Basin and even beyond. There were Greeks in all the islands of the Aegean. Among these islands was Thasos, famous for its gold mines. Samothrace, Imbros, and Lemnos were long occupied by Athenian colonists. Other Aegean islands colonized by Greeks included Lesbos, the home of the poet Sappho; Scyros, the island of Achilles; and Chios, Samos, and Rhodes. Also settled by Greeks were the nearer-lying Cyclades—so called (from the Greek word for “circle”) because they encircled the sacred island of Delos—and the southern island of Crete.\n\nThe western shores of Asia Minor were fringed with Greek colonies, reaching out past the Propontis (Sea of Marmara) and the Bosporus to the northern and southern shores of the Euxine, or Black, Sea. In Africa there were, among others, the colony of Cyrene, now the site of a town in Libya, and the trading post of Naucratis in Egypt. Sicily too was colonized by the Greeks, and there and in southern Italy so many colonies were planted that this region came to be known as Magna Graecia (Great Greece). Pressing farther still, the Greeks founded the city of Massilia, now Marseille, France.\n\nThe mountainous terrain of ancient Greece made travel by land difficult, but the city-states were all located on or near the sea. Many were seafaring societies, sailing to nearby and distant coasts to establish new colonies and trading outposts. The Greek city-states traded with other city-states as well as Greek colonies and other entities along the Mediterranean and Black seas, including Phoenicia, Egypt, and Sicily. The Greeks did not have enough farmland suitable for growing grains, so they imported wheat, especially from what is now Ukraine, to feed their growing populations. Through trade they also obtained slaves, luxury goods, timber, metals, and medicinal plants. Grapes and olives flourished on Greek soil, so the city-states exported wine and olive oil as well as fine pottery, honey, textiles, and silver. Athens in particular conducted a busy trade, and its profits allowed it to build a great navy and formidable city walls.\n\nSeparated by barriers of sea and mountain, by local pride and jealousy, the various independent city-states never conceived the idea of uniting the Greek-speaking world into a single political unit. They formed alliances only when some powerful city-state embarked on a career of conquest and attempted to make itself mistress of the rest. Many influences made for unity—a common language, a common religion, a common literature, similar customs, the religious leagues and festivals, the Olympic Games—but even in time of foreign invasion it was difficult to induce the cities to act together.\n\nVarious Types of Government\n\nThe government of many city-states, notably Athens, passed through four stages from the time of Homer to historical times. During the 8th and 7th centuries bc the kings disappeared. Monarchy gave way to oligarchy—that is, rule by a few. The oligarchic successors of the kings were the wealthy landowning nobles, the “eupatridae,” or wellborn. However, the rivalry among these nobles and the discontent of the oppressed masses was so great that soon a third stage appeared.\n\nThe third type of government was known as tyranny. Some eupatrid would seize absolute power, usually by promising the people to right the wrongs inflicted upon them by the other landholding eupatridae. He was known as a “tyrant.” Among the Greeks this was not a term of reproach but merely meant one who had seized kingly power without the qualification of royal descent. The tyrants of the 7th century were a stepping-stone to democracy, or the rule of the people, which was established nearly everywhere in the 6th and 5th centuries. It was the tyrants who taught the people their rights and power.\n\nBy the beginning of the 5th century bc, Athens had gone through these stages and emerged as the first democracy in the history of the world. Between two and three centuries before this, the Athenian kings had made way for officials called “archons,” elected by the nobles. Thus an aristocratic form of government was established.\n\nAbout 621 bc an important step in the direction of democracy was taken, when the first written laws in Greece were compiled from the existing traditional laws. This reform was forced by the peasants to relieve them from the oppression of the nobles. The new code was so severe, however, that the adjective draconian, derived from the name of the code’s compiler, Draco, is still a synonym for “harsh.” Unfortunately, Draco’s code did not give the peasants sufficient relief. A revolution was averted only by the wise reforms of Solon, about a generation later. Solon’s reforms only delayed the overthrow of the aristocracy. About 561 bc Pisistratus, supported by the discontented populace, made himself tyrant. With two interruptions, Pisistratus ruled for more than 30 years, fostering commerce, agriculture, and the arts and laying the foundation for much of Athens’ future greatness. His sons Hippias and Hipparchus attempted to continue their father’s power. One of them was slain by two youths, Harmodius and Aristogiton, who lived on in Greek tradition as themes for sculptors and poets. By the reforms of Clisthenes, about 509 bc, the rule of the people was firmly established.\n\nVery different was the course of events in Sparta, which by this time had established itself as the most powerful military state in Greece. Under the strict laws of Lycurgus it had maintained its primitive monarchical form of government with little change. Nearly the whole of the Peloponnesus had been brought under its iron heel, and it was now jealously eyeing the rising power of its democratic rival in central Greece.\n\nDuring this period the intellectual and artistic culture of the Greeks centered among the Ionions of Asia Minor. Thales, called “the first Greek philosopher,” was a citizen of Miletus. He became famous for predicting an eclipse of the Sun in 585 bc.\n\nSuddenly there loomed in the east a power that threatened to sweep away the whole promising structure of the new European civilization. Persia, the great Asian empire of the day, had been awakened to the existence of the free peoples of Greece by the aid which the Athenians had sent to their oppressed kinsmen in Asia Minor. The Persian empire mobilized its gigantic resources in an effort to conquer the Greek city-states. The scanty forces of the Greeks succeeded in driving out the invaders (see Persian Wars).\n\nAthens’s Rise to Power\n\nFrom this momentous conflict Athens emerged a blackened ruin yet the richest and most powerful city-state in Greece. It owed this position chiefly to the shrewd policies of the statesman Themistocles, who had seen that naval strength, not land strength, would in the future be the key to power. “Whoso can hold the sea has command of the situation,” he said. He persuaded his fellow Athenians to build a strong fleet—larger than the combined fleets of all the rest of Greece—and to fortify the harbor at Piraeus.\n\nThe Athenian fleet became the instrument by which the Persians were finally defeated, at the battle of Salamis in 480 bc. The fleet also enabled Athens to dominate the Aegean area. Within three years after Salamis, Athens had united the Greek cities of the Asian coast and of the Aegean islands into a confederacy for defense against Persia. It was called the Delian League because the treasury was at first on the island of Delos. In another generation this confederacy became an Athenian empire.\n\nAlmost at a stride Athens was transformed from a provincial city into an imperial capital. Wealth beyond the dreams of any other Greek state flowed into its coffers—tribute from subject and allied states, customs duties on the flood of commerce that poured through Piraeus, and revenues from the Attic silver mines. The population increased fourfold or more, as foreigners streamed in to share in the prosperity. The learning that had been the creation of a few “wise men” throughout the Greek world now became fashionable. Painters and sculptors vied in beautifying Athens with the works of their genius. Even today, battered and defaced by time and people, these art treasures remain among the greatest surviving achievements of human skill. The period in which Athens flourished, one of the most remarkable and brilliant in the world’s history, reached its culmination in the age of Pericles, 460–430 bc. Under the stimulus of wealth and power, with abundant leisure and free institutions, the citizen body of Athens attained a higher average of intellectual interests than any other society before or since.\n\nAthenian Democracy\n\nAs the birthplace of democracy, Athens has served as an inspiration to numerous other societies—to other city-states in ancient Greece and later to countries throughout the world. The word democracy comes from Greek words meaning “rule by the people.” The city-state was a small enough unit for the establishment of a direct democracy, in which the people gathered together in an assembly to decide matters of policy and law themselves. This form of democracy is different from the representative democracy practiced in most places today, where the populations are much larger. In a representative democracy, the citizens choose a smaller group of people to represent them in the legislature and pass laws on their behalf.\n\nRule by the people was a radical idea in the ancient Greek world. It is important to note, however, that only a small portion of Athens’s residents could actually take part in the democracy. Participation was limited to adult male citizens—perhaps about 12 percent of the population. Women, minors (children), slaves, and foreign residents were excluded from political life.\n\nThere was no president or prime minister of Athens. In the democratic era, the chief officials known as archons were chosen by lot. The heart of the Athenian government was the Assembly (the Ecclesia), which met almost weekly on the Pnyx, a hill west of the Acropolis. It decided the city-state’s laws and policies. All adult male citizens of Athens could participate in the Assembly, though typically only about 5,000 of the 30,000 or so eligible men attended. After discussion that was open to all members, a vote was taken. As in many later assemblies, voting was by a show of hands. The votes of a majority of those present and voting prevailed; this practice would be adopted by many later democracies.\n\nThe agenda of the Assembly was set by a body known as the Council of Five Hundred. Unlike the Assembly, it was composed of representatives. The 500 members of the Council were ordinary male citizens who were chosen by lot to represent their district for a one-year term. Each district was allotted a certain number of representatives in rough proportion to its population. The Council’s use of representatives (though chosen by lot rather than by election) foreshadowed the election of representatives in later democratic systems.\n\nAnother important political institution in Athens was the popular courts. All male citizens over 30 years of age could be chosen to be jurors, who were selected by lot. The popular courts are a further illustration of the extent to which the ordinary citizens of Athens were expected to participate in the political life of the city.\n\nSlavery in Ancient Greece\n\nIt must be remembered, however, that a very large part of the population was not free, that the Athenian state rested on a foundation of slavery. Two-fifths (some authorities say four-fifths) of the population were slaves. Slave labor produced much of the wealth that gave the citizens of Athens time and money to pursue art and learning and to serve the state.\n\nSlavery in Greece was a peculiar institution. When a city was conquered, its inhabitants were often sold as slaves. Kidnapping boys and men in “barbarian,” or non-Greek, lands and even in other Greek city-states was another steady source of supply. If a slave was well educated or could be trained to a craft, he was in great demand.\n\nAn Athenian slave often had a chance to obtain his freedom, for quite frequently he was paid for his work, and this gave him a chance to save money. After he had bought his freedom or had been set free by a grateful master, he became a metic—a resident alien. Many of the slaves, however, had a miserable lot. They were sent in gangs to the silver mines at Laurium, working in narrow underground corridors by the dim light of little lamps.\n\nDaily Life in the Age of Pericles\n\nAlthough slavery freed the Athenians from drudgery, they led simple lives. They ate two meals a day, usually consisting of bread, vegetable broth, fruit, and wine. Olives, olive oil, and honey were common foods. Cheese was often eaten in place of meat. Fish was a delicacy.\n\nThe two-story houses of the Athenians were made of sun-dried brick and stood on narrow, winding streets. Even in the cold months the houses were heated only with a brazier, or dish, of burning charcoal. The houses had no chimneys, only a hole in the roof to let out the smoke from the stove in the tiny kitchen. There were no windows on the first floor, but in the center of the house was a broad, open court, such as is found in Spanish and Chinese homes today. Clustered about the court were the men’s apartment, the women’s apartment, and tiny bedrooms. There was no plumbing. Refuse was thrown in the streets.\n\nThe real life of the city went on outdoors. The men spent their time talking politics and philosophy in the agora, or marketplace. They exercised in the athletic fields, performed military duty, and took part in state festivals. Some sat in the Assembly or the Council of 500 or served on juries. There were 6,000 jurors on call at all times in Athens, for the allied cities were forced to bring cases to Athens for trial. Daily salaries were paid for jury service and service on the Council. These made up a considerable part of the income of the poorer citizens.\n\nThe women stayed at home, spinning and weaving and doing household chores. They never acted as hostesses when their husbands had parties and were seen in public only at the theater—where they might attend tragedy but not comedy—and at certain religious festivals.\n\nThe Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC)\n\nThe growth of Athenian power aroused the jealousy of Sparta and other independent Greek states and the discontent of Athens’s subject states. The result was a war that put an end to the power of Athens. The long struggle, called the Peloponnesian War, began in 431 bc. It was a contest between a great sea power, Athens and its empire, and a great land power, Sparta and the military coalition it led, called the Peloponnesian League.\n\nThe plan of Pericles in the beginning was not to fight at all, but to let Corinth and Sparta spend their money and energies while Athens conserved both. He had all the inhabitants of Attica come inside the walls of Athens and let their enemies ravage the plain year after year, while Athens, without losses, harried their lands by sea. However, the bubonic plague broke out in besieged and overcrowded Athens. It killed one-fourth of the population, including Pericles, and left the rest without spirit and without a leader. The first phase of the Peloponnesian War ended with the outcome undecided.\n\nAlmost before they knew it, the Athenians were whirled by the unscrupulous politician Alcibiades, a nephew of Pericles, into the second phase of the war (414–404 bc). Wishing for a brilliant military career, Alcibiades persuaded Athens to undertake a large-scale expedition against Syracuse, a Corinthian colony in Sicily. The Athenian armada was destroyed in 413 bc, and the captives were sold into slavery.\n\nThis disaster sealed the fate of Athens. The allied Aegean cities that had remained faithful to Athens now deserted to Sparta, and the Spartan armies laid Athens under siege. In 405 bc the whole remaining Athenian fleet of 180 triremes (oar-powered three-decked warships) was captured in the Hellespont at the battle of Aegospotami. Besieged by land and powerless by sea, Athens could neither raise grain nor import it, and in 404 bc its empire came to an end. The fortifications and long walls connecting Athens with Piraeus were destroyed, and Athens became a vassal, or subject state, of triumphant Sparta.\n\nThe End of the Greek City-States\n\nSparta tried to maintain its supremacy by keeping garrisons in many of the Greek cities. This custom, together with Sparta’s hatred of democracy, made its domination unpopular. At the battle of Leuctra, in 371 bc, the Thebans under their gifted commander Epaminondas put an end to the power of Sparta. Theban leadership was short-lived, however, for it depended on the skill of Epaminondas. When he was killed in the battle of Mantinea, in 362 bc, Thebes had really suffered a defeat in spite of its apparent victory. The age of the powerful city-states was at an end, and a prostrated Greece had become easy prey for a would-be conqueror.\n\nSuch a conqueror was found in the young and strong country of Macedon, which lay just to the north of Classical Greece. Its King Philip II, who came into power in 360 bc, had had a Greek education. Seeing the weakness of the disunited cities, he made up his mind to take possession of the Greek world. Demosthenes saw the danger that threatened and by a series of fiery speeches against Philip sought to unite the Greeks as they had once been united against Persia.\n\nThe military might of Philip proved too strong for the disunited city-states, and at the battle of Chaeronea (338 bc) he established his leadership over Greece. Before he could carry his conquests to Asia Minor, however, he was killed and his power fell to his son Alexander, then not quite 20 years old. Alexander firmly entrenched his rule throughout Greece and then overthrew the vast power of Persia, building up an empire that embraced nearly the entire world known to the Mediterranean peoples. Alexander’s conquest of the Greek city-states spread Greek ideas and culture widely throughout the empire.\n\nThe Hellenistic Age and Roman Conquest\n\nThe three centuries that followed the death of Alexander are known as the Hellenistic Age, for their products were no longer pure Greek, but Greek plus the characteristics of the conquered nations. The age was a time of great wealth and splendor. Art, science, and letters flourished and developed. The private citizen no longer lived crudely, but in a beautiful and comfortable house, and many cities adorned themselves with fine public buildings and sculptures.\n\nThe Hellenistic Age came to an end with another conquest—that of Rome. On the field of Cynoscephalae (“dogs’ heads”), in Thessaly, the Romans defeated Macedonia in 197 bc and gave the Greek cities their freedom as allies. The Greeks caused Rome a great deal of trouble, and in 146 bc Corinth was burned. The Greeks became vassals of Rome. Athens alone was revered and given some freedom. To its schools went many Romans, Cicero among them.\n\nWhen the seat of the Roman Empire was transferred to the east, Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) became the center of culture and learning and Athens sank to the position of an unimportant country town (see Byzantine Empire). In the 4th century ad Greece was devastated by the Visigoths under Alaric; in the 6th century it was overrun by the Slavs; and in the 10th century it was raided by the Bulgars. In 1453 the Turks seized Constantinople, and within a few years practically all Greece was in their hands. Only in the 19th century, after a protracted struggle against their foreign rulers, did the Greeks finally regain their independence.\n\nThe Heritage of the Ancient Greeks\n\nThe glorious culture of the Greeks had its beginnings before the rise of the city-states to wealth and power and survived long after the Greeks had lost their independence. The men of genius who left their stamp on the golden age of Greece seemed to live a life apart from the tumultuous politics and wars of their era. They sprang up everywhere, in scattered colonies as well as on the Greek peninsula. When the great creative age had passed its peak, Greek artists and philosophers were sought as teachers in other lands, where they spread the wisdom of their masters.\n\nWhat were these ideas for which the world reached out so eagerly? First was the determination to be guided by reason, to follow the truth wherever it led. In their sculpture and architecture, in their literature and philosophy, the Greeks were above all else reasonable. “Nothing to excess” (meden agan) was their central doctrine, a doctrine that the Roman poet Horace later interpreted as “the golden mean.”\n\nThe art of the Greeks was singularly free from exaggeration. Virtue was for them a path between two extremes—only by temperance, they believed, could humankind attain happiness. Since this belief included maintaining a balanced life of the mind and body, they provided time for play as well as work (see Olympic Games).\n\nFrom Homer to Aristotle\n\nThis many-sided culture seemed to spring into being almost full-grown. Before the rise of the Greek city-states, Babylon had made contributions to astronomy, and the rudiments of geometry and medicine had been developed in Egypt. The genius of the Greeks, however, owed little to these ancient civilizations. Greek culture had its beginnings in the settlements on the coast of Asia Minor. Here Homer sang of a joyous, conquering people and of their gods, who, far from being aloof and forbidding, were always ready to come down from Mount Olympus to play a part in the absorbing life of the people. Philosophy was also born in Asia Minor, where in the 6th and 5th centuries bc such men as Thales, Heracleitus, and Democritus speculated on the makeup of the world. Thales also contributed to the science of geometry, which was further advanced by the teacher and mathematician Pythagoras in the distant colony of Croton in southern Italy.\n\nIn the 5th century bc, with the rise of Athens as a wealthy democratic state, the center of Greek culture passed to the peninsula. Here the Greeks reached the peak of their extraordinary creative energy. This was the great period of Greek literature, architecture, and sculpture, a period that reached its culmination in the age of Pericles. Philosophers now turned their thoughts from the study of matter to the study of humankind.\n\nToward the end of the century Socrates ushered in what is considered to be the most brilliant period of Greek philosophy, passing on his wisdom to his pupil Plato. Plato in turn handed it on to “the master of those who know,” the great Aristotle.\n\nThe Progress of Science in the Hellenistic Age\n\nAlexander died in 323 bc. The spread of Greek learning that resulted from his conquests, however, laid the foundation for much of the cultural progress of the Hellenistic Age. Alexandria, the city founded by Alexander at the mouth of the Nile River in Egypt, became the intellectual capital of the world and a center of Greek scholarship. Its famous library, founded by Ptolemy I, was said to have contained 700,000 rolls of papyrus manuscripts.\n\nIn literature and art the Hellenistic Age was imitative, looking to the masterpieces of earlier days for inspiration. In science, however, much brilliant and original work was done. Archimedes put mechanics on a sound footing, and Euclid established geometry as a science. Eratosthenes made maps and calculated Earth’s circumference.\n\nAristarchus put forward the hypothesis that Earth revolves around the Sun. Ptolemy, or Claudius Ptolemaeus, believed all the heavenly bodies circled Earth, and his views prevailed throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nHow Greek Culture Survived\n\nThe Hellenistic Age ended with the establishment of the Roman Empire in 31 bc. The Romans borrowed from the art and science of the Greeks and drew upon their philosophy of Stoicism. As Christianity grew and spread, it was profoundly influenced by Greek thought. Throughout the period of the barbarian invasions, Greek learning was preserved by Christians in Constantinople and by Muslims in Cairo, Egypt. Its light shone again in the Middle Ages with the founding of the great universities in Italy, France, and England. During the Renaissance it provided an impetus for the rebirth of art and literature. Modern science rests on the Greek idea of humankind’s capacity to solve problems by rational methods. In almost every phase of life the quickening impulse of Greek thought can be seen among the peoples who inherited this priceless legacy.
