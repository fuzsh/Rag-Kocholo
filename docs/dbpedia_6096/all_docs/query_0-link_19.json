        "text": "This movie reminded me of If it's Tuesday this must be Belgium. I would say they are similar in quality and subject matter (romance on a tour bus with wacky tourists as comedy relief). The romance was a bit better in Belgium and maybe the movie overall but they are close. Low brow clich√©d comedy in both and while Belgium does Western Europe Ruins is set in Greece. The cinematography is better in Ruins so if you like pretty pictures take a trip with Vardalos and company. The movie isn't awful and I would classify it as a pleasant time waster of a summer movie but that is it. It is the type of movie you wait to arrive on DVD, cable or regular TV. Nevertheless the crowd I saw it with at an advance screening clapped at the end so there are some as other user comments attest to that really liked it."
