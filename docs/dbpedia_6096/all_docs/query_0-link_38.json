        "text": "I love My Life in Ruins, though some of the jokes don't hold up to today's standards. I haven't even been to Greece!\n\nIt really is vicarious travel as it follows a tour group through Greece as they bond with each other, and learn and love the history.\n\nThanks for posting. I started listing my favorites and realized that 1) most of them are set in Italy and 2) I own them all on DVD!\n\nThese are not listed in order of being my favorite. I like them all:\n\nThe Enchanted April\n\nSummertime\n\nBread & Tulips\n\nCasanova\n\nUnder the Tuscan Sun\n\nRoman Holiday\n\nA Room with a View\n\nWings of the Dove\n\nNow that you've got me thinking about these movies, I will have a much easier April in isolation. I was too downhearted in March to watch my Irish films, watching only the Quiet Man. But maybe I will get to them, too.\n\nAnd for May/June: I Capture the Castle - bluebells and solstice. Oh, and my new-ish DVD of Emma Rice's Midsummer Night's Dream filmed in the Globe. Yes!\n\nThe Quiet Man, The Sundowners, La Dolce Vida, Cinema Paradiso, Chocolate, Von Ryan‚Äôs Express, The Great Escape, Three Coins in The Fountain, Two For The Road, Ryan‚Äôs Daughter, Our Man In Havana, Room With A View, Talented Mr Ripley, Roman Holiday, Local Hero, Zorba The Greek, Breathless, To Catch A Thief, Amarcord, 8 1/2, Passage to India, Notting Hill, Comfort and Joy, Night and The City, Hard Days Night, Waking Ned Devine, Lawerence of Arabia, Our Man In Havana, Chariots of Fire, Vicki Christina Barcelona, Grand Prix, Knife In The Water, Clockwork Orange, Dr No, Out of Africa, In Bruges, Dr Zhivago, Swept Away ( NOT the one with Madonna) and El Cid ( only because I adored the ending, ‚Äú For God, For Cid, For Spain ‚Äú ) .\n\nAnd yes folks I‚Äôm a film lover....\n\nI will add Wings of the Dove to my list. Just read a description of the film and will try to find it. Does anyone know if it is Amazon Prime or Netflix?\n\nJust found it on Amazon Prime and rented it for $3.99. Will watch it tonight! Thanks for this thread.\n\nI have to report on the movie Wings of The Dove - it was very good and I loved the scenes in London and Venice, lots of rain in Venice. It‚Äôs based on a Henry James novel so the plot is unconventional and complicated in a way you do not expect. I give it a thumbs up as a travel movie with a literary theme and period costumes.\n\nTwo stand outs for me are \"The Sound of Music\" and \"Roman Holiday\" which always make me want to go back to Salzburg and Rome respectively.\n\nA special mention for \"The Last Emperor\" which I just rewatched last night. It was filmed in China, with a lot of scenes in the Forbidden City. It won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Cinematography. I am not totally convinced it should have gotten Best Picture, but it certainly deserved the cinematography award. That also makes me want to go back to China.\n\nI also like the Melissa McCarthy comedy \"Spy\" which was filmed in Paris, Rome and Hungary. Maybe this is because I first saw it on a plane trip to Europe. It is very funny, and in travel terms, I really enjoyed the scene where she takes a taxi when first arriving in Paris, and enjoys the sights and fancy hotels she sees, but then finds she is getting into sleazier parts of Paris, and finds her employers, the CIA, have put her in a real dump of a hotel. Jason Statham also steals the show in this movie.\n\nRick has book and film lists for all the countries he covers right on this website in the \"Explore Europe\" section. Go to that link, choose the country of interest from the pull down box, click on \"Plan\", then click on \"(country name): Recommended Books and Movies\". I imagine those lists are similar to the ones in the guidebooks, but I've never made that comparison.\n\nI love this thread!! I cry every time I see Out of Africa. It immediately takes me back to a trip to Tsavo, Kenya. I will add to the list films that don't think have been mentioned. Not all of them are upbeat, but they all have an aspect that reminds me of some place I have visited.\n\nIreland - Circle of Friends - visited Inistioge in Kilkenny, beautiful location.\n\nIreland - Leap Year - even though no location is accurately identified, it does have stunning location and feel\n\nGreece Islands - Shirley Valentine, Mama Mia\n\nCozumel/Isla Mujeres Mexico - Against all Odds\n\nAfrica - Queen of Katwe, Mister Johnson, the Gods Must be Crazy, Born Free, The Constant Gardner, The Last King of Scotland, Blood Diamonds, Nowhere in Africa.\n\nItaly - Call Me by your Name, Eat Pray Love, Life is Beautiful, Ill Postino, The American\n\nFrance - Charade, A Good Year, The Hundred Foot Journey, Amelie, Funny Face\n\nChina - Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Farewell, The Painted Vail\n\nEngland/Canada/China - The Red Violin\n\nSouth America - The Motorcycle Diaries, The Official Story, Proof of Life, The Mission, City of God, Central Station\n\nVietnam - Heaven and Earth, The Quiet American, Indochine, The Lover"
