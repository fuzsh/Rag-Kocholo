        "text": "You don’t have to wait for May 4 – or “Star Wars” Day – to celebrate the many worlds of the legendary sci-fi franchise. From a desert trek on Jedha to dinner at Luke Skywalker’s childhood home, here are some of the real-world destinations where “Star Wars” comes to life all year round.\n\nWadi Rum, Jordan\n\nAnother “Star Wars” film, another desert country pressed into service.\n\nWelcome to Wadi Rum, Jordan, the russet sandy locale that serves as a backdrop in the final “Star Wars” movie, “The Rise of Skywalker.” This dramatic landscape in the country’s south, also called The Valley of the Moon, stood in for the moon of Jedha in “Rogue One.”\n\nWadi Rum is a frequent location for otherworldly film shoots. It doubled for Mars and hosted a profane Matt Damon in “The Martian.”\n\nPuzzlewood, Gloucestershire, England\n\nMeandering paths. Mossy rocks. Twisted trees and gulleys. No wonder Puzzlewood, which sits in the Forest of Dean not too far from Wales, is such a draw.\n\nAnd not just for “Star Wars.” You’ve also seen it in “Merlin,” “Doctor Who” and other TV and film productions. But it’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” that’s really put Puzzlewood on the travel map.\n\nIt’s here, as battle rages in the surrounding forests of Takodana, that Rey first encounters her nemesis Kylo Ren.\n\nHotel Sidi Driss, Matmata, Tunisia\n\nPerhaps the most famous “Star Wars” landmark in the world, this is where the interiors of Luke Skywalker’s childhood home on planet Tatooine were filmed.\n\nCenturies ago, Berbers built the underground structure as a real home. Eventually it became a hotel, which George Lucas used to film the first “Star Wars” film.\n\nThe set decorations came down when the crew left, but were rebuilt in 2000 for “Attack of the Clones.” Since then, they’ve remained, so guests can eat at the table where young master Luke did.\n\nLa Grande Dune, outside Nefta, Tunisia\n\nThe igloo exterior of Luke’s house was filmed about 300 kilometers away on the dried-up salt lake of Chott El Jerid. The igloo is still there, reachable with a decent car at the GPS coordinates 33°50’34.42″N, 7°46’44.48″E.\n\nThe surrounding craters are man-made, to create the illusion that the underground house is next to it.\n\nThe igloo from the 1977 movie was dismantled, but again rebuilt for “Attack of the Clones,” and later restored by a fan.\n\nNearby is La Grande Dune, site of the Dune Sea. About 30 minutes from the igloo is the set of Mos Espa, the spaceport town where Anakin was discovered as a young slave.\n\nSalar de Uyuni, Bolivia\n\nThis spectacular salt flat in Bolivia is rendered even more spectacular for a battle scene between the Resistance and the First Order in “The Last Jedi.”\n\nThe desert doubles as the the remote mining planet of Crait, a rebel outpost.\n\nIn the movie, the barren terrain’s blindingly white salt surface covers blood-red minerals, producing violent bursts of color with every explosion and footprint.\n\nReynisfjara, Iceland\n\nThe otherworldy landscape of Iceland is fast becoming the go-to destination for sci-fi movies, and “Rogue One” joined the club in 2016.\n\nThe black sand beach of Reynisfjara, a wild stretch of North Atlantic coastline close to the small town of Vik and Iceland’s southernmost tip, stands in for the stormy planet of Eadu.\n\nIt’s here the movie’s lead, Jyn Erso, played by Felicity Jones, unsuccessfully tries to save her grievously wounded father.\n\nRedwood National and State Parks, California\n\nEndor, the forest moon home of the furry Ewoks, was filmed among giant redwoods of California. Most of the well-known scenes were shot on private land owned by a lumber company.\n\nSince the cast and crew worked on “Return of the Jedi” in 1982, heavy logging has left most of the landscape unrecognizable. But driving through the parks still gives a feel for the set, especially along the Avenue of the Giants highway.\n\nIn Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park and the Humboldt Redwoods State Park, plates were filmed for some chase scenes.\n\nKrafla, Iceland\n\nWe stay on “Rogue One’s” Eadu for another visit to Iceland, this time Krafla, an active volcano in the country’s remote northeast.\n\nA source of geothermal energy, Krafla’s seething crater and nearby Lake Mývatn have also made an appearance in “Game of Thrones.”\n\nHardangerjøkulen Glacier and Finse, Norway\n\nExteriors of the ice world Hoth in “The Empire Strikes Back” were shot in the tiny village of Finse, Norway.\n\nThe cast and crew stayed at the Finse 1222 Hotel, where snowstorm scenes were shot from the back door. But the main battlefield scenes were shot on the nearby glacier.\n\nIn March and April, skies are normally clear and there’s still plenty of snow. Guides in Finse can help with hikes to see the exact locations.\n\nCanary Wharf Station, London, England\n\nLondon’s squished commuters would probably welcome a Galactic Empire takeover of the city’s under-strain metro system if its stormtroopers could get the trains to run to schedule.\n\nIt’s a scenario that almost plays out in “Rogue One,” when Canary Wharf, a modern London Underground interchange serving a key financial district, doubles as an Imperial base.\n\nThe futuristic steel, glass and concrete station is filled with stormtroopers rather than bankers for scenes on the Imperial planet of Scarif.\n\nVilla del Balbianello, Lenno, Italy\n\nIn “Attack of the Clones,” Anakin and Padme go into hiding at a lake retreat that in real life is a popular choice for destination weddings on Italy’s Lake Como.\n\nAt the tip of a wooded peninsula reachable only by boat, Villa del Balbianello was built in 1787 for Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini.\n\nJames Bond came here for a bit in “Casino Royale.”\n\nThe villa’s exteriors were digitally altered for the Star Wars movie, but it’s easy to find and recognize the balcony where Anakin and Padme kiss.\n\nPhang Nga Bay, Thailand/Guilin, China\n\nEveryone’s favorite Wookiee was born on planet Kashyyyk, seen in “Revenge of the Sith” as a lush world of one endless season.\n\nThe images in real life were mostly taken as plate photography near Phuket, Thailand. Some shots were digitally combined with places in Guilin, China.\n\nWhippendell Woods, UK\n\nThe forest of Naboo, where Jar Jar Binks first meets Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn in “The Phantom Menace,” was filmed in England near the Leavesden Film Studios.\n\nGungans like Jar Jar live in underwater cities, but there’s no lake in Whippendell Woods. All the shots with water were created with digital effects.\n\nLaamu Atoll, Maldives\n\nBeing sent to the planet of Scarif, a tropical planet linked to the development of the first Death Star, was probably a dream posting for Galactic Empire engineers.\n\nIn “Rogue One,” Scarif is played by the Laamu Atoll, a string of islands that form part of the Maldives archipelago.\n\nThe idyllic location witnesses explosive battle scenes as Jyn Erso leads a rebel squad on a mission to steal Death Star plans.\n\nPlaza de Espana, Seville, Spain\n\nWhen Padme and Anakin arrive in Theed at a plaza outside the palace, they were actually in this plaza built for the 1929 Ibero-American Exposition. The real plaza is a half-circle ringed by a moat with four bridges.\n\nFor the scenes in “Attack of the Clones” and “The Phantom Menace,” the plaza was dramatically expanded to a full circle, and the building altered to include the towers and green domes of Naboo.\n\nMount Etna, Italy\n\nNo, the actors didn’t actually battle among the lava flows on the Sicilian volcano.\n\nBut it was used for plate photography to create the battle scene on Mustafar between Obi-Wan and Anakin in “Revenge of the Sith.”\n\nDeath Valley National Park, California\n\nAlthough most of Tatooine was shot in Tunisia, crucial scenes in “A New Hope” were filmed in Death Valley between the Sierra Nevada mountains and Mojave Desert.\n\nTwenty Mule Team Canyon was used for “Return of the Jedi” scenes with C-3PO and R2-D2 traveling to Jabba the Hut’s palace.\n\nOther stops in the park that seem familiar from the movies: Dante’s View and the Mesquite Sand Dunes.\n\nMayan ruins in Tikal National Park, Guatemala\n\nThousand-year-old Mayan ruins are the backdrop to the Rebel Alliance’s Massassi outpost on the fourth moon of Yavin.\n\nTemples II and III reach over the jungle canopy, just as they do in the first shot of Yavin in “A New Hope.”\n\nButtercup Valley, Yuma Desert, Arizona\n\nThe Great Pit of Carkoon, home to the sarlacc that eats Jabba’s prisoners in “Return of the Jedi,” was filmed in Arizona rather than Tunisia.\n\nThe sail barge was constructed here, behind fences to keep out prying fans.\n\nIt was so big that the crew used the space underneath for offices, trailers and a commissary with 150 seats. They didn’t blow up the barge here, but fans still like to come hunting for pieces of the set in the sand.\n\nAvenue 7 Novembre, Medenine, Tunisia\n\nWhen Anakin was a slave boy in “The Phantom Menace,” his quarters were filmed on this real-life Tunisian street.\n\nThe distinctive buildings with vaulted ceilings are ghorfas, used by Berbers to store their grain. They were fortified and grouped into ksour. These are among the best-preserved examples.\n\nAjim, Island of Djerba, Tunisia\n\nThe cantina where Luke and Obi-Wan get stopped by sandtroopers is in the middle of the island town of Ajim. The building, once a bakery, went out of use and can be hard to find.\n\nThe GPS coordinates are 33°43’26.69″N, 10°44’59.95″E.\n\nObi-Wan’s home is easier to find, ironically located right on the Mediterranean Sea and much more beautiful than its desolate film locale. A lovely spot for a building that’s used by fishermen as a storeroom.\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nFor the “The Force Awakens,” director J.J. Abrams chose the desert of the United Arab Emirates rather than Tunisia. The cinematic sandy expanses stood in for the planet Jakku.\n\nSkellig Michael, Ireland\n\nThe epic climax of “The Force Awakens” was filmed at the ruins of this seventh-century monastery, which sits on the steep sides of the island Skellig Michael.\n\nNew edition to the franchise “The Last Jedi” returns to this spectacular location, as Rey catches up with Luke Skywalker in his mysterious hiding place.\n\nEven though it’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site, its hard-to-reach location 12 kilometers off the coast of southwest Ireland discourages many visitors.\n\nDubrovnik, Croatia\n\nDubrovnik has become a regular on TV screens in recent years – thanks to its starring role in “Game of Thrones.” Now it’s standing in for the gambling city of Canto Bight in “The Last Jedi.”\n\nThe medieval walled city’s well-preserved center gets a futuristic makeover to transform it into the “Star Wars” equivalent of Vegas.\n\nThe Adriatic port already trades heavily on its GoT connections with some complaining the screen role has brought in too many visitors. Let’s hope this additional exposure doesn’t create much more of a disturbance – in the streets, let alone the Force.\n\nFormer RAF Greenham Common military base, Berkshire, UK\n\nThis former military base was used by US and British forces during World War II but closed in 1993.\n\nIn “The Force Awakens,” it enters active service once more, as a base for Resistance X-Wing Fighters. The former nuclear bunker is usually closed to the public, but visits have been allowed during the country’s annual Heritage Open Days.\n\nAn error in an earlier version of this story created a disturbance in the Force. Luke Skywalker himself set us straight:"
