Madison asks Chelsea who they should call when her antics inevitably land them in jail, and Chelsea questions the correlation between her rising anxiety levels and her proximity to Madison. Starring Joe Pesci, Ralph Macchio, and the incomparable Marisa Tomei, our hosts agree the only thing that could make this classic better is more Mona Lisa Vito dropping jaws in that Alabama courtroom!\n\nConnect With Us\n\nFollow us on Instagram @loveatfirstscreening or send an email to loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction\n\nHosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\nMusic: Good Steph\n\nArtwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nSocial Media: Marissa Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.

In this first episode, they discuss the movie as a standalone film and explore both how it fits into the rom-com genre, but also how it fits into queer media as a whole. Listen in as they discuss how the film manages to address more serious topics than your average rom com while still maintaining a tone of levity. Also, Madison promises that she does eventually find her way to the point she is making, but is very grateful that Chelsea is there to help steer her back to it. Tune in next week for part two where the conversation gets more unhinged as our hosts begin comparing it to the book.

Starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey (and an exciting Kathryn Hahn cameo), this approach to \"the Bet\" trope has our hosts and special guest Luke questioning which behaviors constitute poor dating etiquette specifically vs. generally unhinged human conduct. (Talking during a movie is just bad manners, whether or not you're on a date!)\n\nA huge thank you again to Luke: You're a shining example to all men who dream of speaking into microphones—we owe you one (a kidney)!\n\nConnect With Us\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\nEmail: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\nGuest Extraordinaire: Senator Tori Green, South Carolina\n\nMusic: Good Steph\n\nArtwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nSocial Media: Marissa Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.

Chelsea picked both this movie and Tori as its viewer as a special birthday gift to herself and it’s honestly a gift to us all. Listen as we talk root vegetables, epic monologues, Ayo Edebiri’s Irish origins, and so much more. While she knows she said this earlier in the season, Madison has decided that this is her favorite episode so far. She also fears that Chelsea may fire her in favor of hiring Tori and who would blame her? Thank you again.

It's a classic tale of wacky, opera-singing guy tries to worm his way into the heart of frigid chef who has recently suffered the loss of her sister and gained custody of her niece. Madison admits this pick doesn't serve a traditional rom com, and Chelsea wonders if there weren't too many plotlines in this kitchen? The duo both agree, however, that the grieving baby Breslin needed therapy, not fish sticks.\n\nConnect With Us\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\nEmail: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\nMusic: Good Steph\n\nArtwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nSocial Media: Marissa Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time. The cinematic world of love and laughter had rom-com enthusiast Madison head over heels from the time Harry met Sally. For genre skeptic Chelsea, however, it’s been a grueling enemies-to-lovers plot. In Love at First Screening, Madison introduces Chelsea to all the fan-favorite love stories she’s never wanted to watch.

Tune in every Wednesday to find out.\n\nJoin our hosts on the wee Scottish Isle of Hegg (or, rather, the Isle of Mann, masquerading as Scotland if we are being honest about our filming locations) as they review Chelsea's pick: The Decoy Bride. Madison is baffled, yet delighted, at Chelsea's appreciation of the movie and both uncover the real reason why this movie works so well: David Tennant. Sure, the dialogue is witty and the accents and scenery are great, but the cast of the movie is really what elevates it to a height like that of the Hebridean cliffside. While we adored Kelly MacDonald's accent, can we please start letting David Tennant use his Scottish accent? For science? Either way, this movie is definitely worth the watch (and for what it's worth-- this is Madison's favorite episode this season).\n\nConnect With Us\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\nEmail: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\nMusic: Good Steph\n\nArtwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nSocial Media: Marissa Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.

Much to Madison's surprise, Chelsea seemed to enjoy this flick, and even more shocking, she didn't request a queer rewrite! (Although, it absolutely needed more dogs!) Featuring cameos from Dermot Mulroney, Stockard Channing, and Madison's sexual awakening, Christopher Plummer (who tore apart no fascist icons but was charming nonetheless), this one's a howling good time.\n\nConnect With Us\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\nEmail: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\nMusic: Good Steph\n\nArtwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nSocial Media: Marissa Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.

Chelsea promises that while every movie would be made better if only if were gay, this movie would truly make more sense if that were the case. Madison looks at concepts of codependency through the metaphor of how Julia Roberts' character likes her eggs. Ultimately, we are just proud to say that Richard Gere doesn't come across as a stale Wheat Thin in this movie--but he does come across as an asshole. so is this an improvement?\n\nConnect With Us Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\nEmail: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\nMusic: Good Steph\n\nArtwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.

Hop on the tour bus alongside some unforgettable characters exploring Greece...amid their day drinking, dad jokes, shoplifting, and syrup monologues. This comedy-fueled rom-com is no gay pirate romp, but it's got plenty of kefi (and one smoking hot werewolf, I mean bus driver)!\n\nConnect With Us Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\nEmail: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\nMusic: Good Steph\n\nArtwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nSocial Media: Marissa Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.

This week, Chelsea and Mads watched Love & Basketball (2000), starring Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan. Right out the gate, this sports “rom-dram” is pretty much guaranteed to fail the romantic comedy test– but then why is it always featured on the must-watch rom-com lists? Listen as our hosts explore this and more as they break down the ins and outs of this cult classic. In a not shocking turn of events, Chelsea explains how this movie could be made so much better, if only it were gay.

In this episode of Love at First Screening, our hosts try to wrap their minds around Palm Springs (2020), or perhaps a better title would have been The Hot Girls' Guide to Mathemagics. Have Chelsea and Madison finally cracked the Happily Ever After code to their romantic comedy analysis? It's a film that may not tick all the rom-com boxes, but your dad will probably stay awake through movie night for once.\n\nConnect With Us\n\nInstagram: @loveatfirstscreening\n\nEmail: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction/Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\nMusic: Good Steph\n\nArtwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.

Did you think we would make it this far? Our cohosts welcome back you back to the fold with a 2023 rom-com Your Place or Mine featuring Reese Witherspoon, Ashton Kutcher, and Tig Notaro’s ever-present and massive cup of coffee.

In a deep conversation of relationship dynamics, marriage practices, and queer dignity expansion, our hosts break down Alexis Hall’s Boyfriend Material and Husband Material. The conversation gets surprisingly vulnerable, especially for a chat about one of the funniest sets of romantic comedies written in the last five years. If you haven’t had the luxury of diving into Hall’s grounded and charming prose, we highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed. Perhaps we can convince you through this conversation?\n\nP.S.

These gays do nothing but gab, and our leading ladies (Dianna Agron and Daisy Ridley) may just kick the infamous rom-com miscommunication trope to the curb as the clock strikes midnight.\n\nConnect With Us\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\n- Email: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction\n\n- Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\n- Music: Madison Hill\n\n- Artwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nIn this Christmas-spirited episode of their special “Rom Com Road-Trip” series, our hosts have been blessed with a visit from someone at the top of Santa's nice list: Caroline Bourke (@carrottlime on TikTok and @carolinekbourke on Instagram). With a story inspired by Anna Vaus's song, \"Halloween on Christmas Eve\" the LAFS team takes Caroline on a magical sleigh ride of Christmas magic, dive bars, and accidental love with the star of your 17-year-old dreams. While honesty is always the best policy, our main character Georgia finds herself in a mess of her own making. Perhaps, though, she may be able to dig herself out of the snowbank of lies she finds herself in. With a stellar cast including Jaz Sinclair and Josh Hutcherson, what more could you want? Cozy up to this one with a cup of cocoa and perhaps a pet cow.\n\nConnect With Caroline:\n\n-@carrottlime on TikTok\n\n-@carolinekbourke on Instagram\n\nConnect with Us:\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\n- Email: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction\n\n- Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\n- Music: Anna Vaus\n\n- Artwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nIn this episode of their special “Rom Com Road-Trip” series, Madison takes Chelsea to a cult-- wait... no. Not a cult. I swear, it's really not a cult. It's just a co-op living community. Together, wearing jewel-toned linen outfits, Madison reveals an over 55 romance to Chelsea in an attempt to make up for forcing her to watch that one Diane Keaton movie (you know the one). Your husband may die, but your opportunities for love with a hot lumberjack don't have to. Starring our Lord and Savior, Laura Dern and the smoking hot Cheyenne Jackson, LAFSters will get to sink their teeth into a slightly unconventional love story that is still cookie-cutter rom-com perfection.\n\nConnect With Us\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\n- Email: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction\n\n- Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\n- Music: Madison Hill\n\n- Artwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nIn this episode of their special “Rom Com Road-Trip” series, Madison goes with the spirit of the topic and shows up a little less than sober... Don't worry, the whole driving part of this is only metaphorical and she somehow ends up putting this story together more coherently than she has told others in the past. In order to fulfill Chelsea's request of drunken wedding shenanigans, Madison presents a story of a professional bridesmaid-for-hire, a reluctant bride, and a gut-wrenching one liner that has Chelsea stop in her tracks. Also, if anyone wants to hire Madison as a bridesmaid, she is available. Starring Jeanine Mason and Jameela Jamil, listen as we actualize Chelsea's dream of seeing a wedding fall to shambles.\n\nIn this episode of their special “Rom Com Road-Trip” series, Chelsea has a lot to say about ambiguously fruit-flavored toaster pastries. Oh, but don't worry, she definitely gets around to telling a story at some point (even if she does get lost in the spooky potential and forgets the Com for this Rom). A witch on the run from her ex-boyfriend and a magical mafia reunites unexpectedly with her estranged sister and her college girlfriend in this seasonal second-chance romance starring Madelaine Petsch and Kaniehtiio Horn. Crank up the AC, because everybody knows there's nothing hotter than swords, daggers, and watching the love of your life annihilate your enemies!\n\nConnect With Us\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\n- Email: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction\n\n- Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\n- Music: Madison Hill\n\n- Artwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nIn this episode of their special “Rom Com Road-Trip” series, Madison takes Chelsea on possibly the most banal trip yet. Like, seriously all we saw was corn and then Madison started ranting about hornworms? Not her finest work, but if you are into that kind of thing, she does tell a semi-decent tale of a marriage of convenience. Starring Kat Graham and an alarming number of male characters--seriously Mads, it's called the Bechdel test-- LAFSters can look forward to one night stands with Spider-Man, ways around your homophobic grandpa's will, and a lobster baby. What more could you want? Probably a lot, but this'll have to do.\n\nConnect With Us\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\n- Email: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction\n\n- Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\n- Music: Madison Hill\n\n- Artwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nEpisode analytics\n\nIn this installment of their special “Rom Com Road-Trip” series, Chelsea shoves Madison into the car alongside a group of queer documentary filmmakers as they set out on a cross-country bar crawl. But you know what they say: It's all fun and gay until you're drunk in a motel room...and there's only one bed. Starring Stephanie Allynne and Roberta Colindrez, it's a sexy romp that'll give you both the warms and the fuzzies.

This week, our hosts dive into Jennifer's Body, the 2009 horror comedy flop that, in retrospect, critics may have misunderstood—much like Madison has misunderstood the reach of her \"power\" as a Florida State Park Junior Ranger. After debating which of Hollywood's Chrises is the correct choice (trick question; there is only a wrong choice!), the pair rolls up their sleeves to transform this underrated film into a sapphic romantic comedy meets revenge fantasy that LAFSters will love...from eyeballs to entrails.\n\nConnect With Us\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheLAFSPod\n\n- Email: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction\n\n- Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\n- Music: Madison Hill\n\n- Artwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.

Madison gleefully walks Chelsea and the listeners through her Wiki rabbit hole about the Hollywood Blacklist and Audrey Hepburn's rise to stardom. While one of our hosts found the film to be…less than memorable, the other insists it’s one everyone should see at least once. Join us as Madison pretends to know about trees and Chelsea continues her search for a new host.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by the concept of Prince Harry's memoir \"Spare\". If you or a loved one has listened to it and needs someone to speak with about it, please reach out to Madison at the information below.

The cinematic world of love and laughter had rom-com enthusiast Madison head over heels from the time Harry met Sally. For genre skeptic Chelsea, however, it’s been a grueling enemies-to-lovers plot. In Love at First Screening, Madison introduces Chelsea to all the fan-favorite love stories she’s never wanted to watch.

A special LAFSter request has our hosts behind the wheel of the 1995 cult classic Clueless. (Let's hope they're better drivers than Cher and Dionne!) After Chelsea reveals which Hollywood Baldwin (aka hottie) she'd like to watch for an hour or two, she asks Madison if they should re-brand LAFS as a teen movie podcast. Will our hosts swap genres for good? As if! They will, however, name-drop a dozen must-see teen movies and share a few teen driver horror stories while they have the chance.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by the word \"iconic\"; drop this adjective in any sentence of your choosing to automatically elevate the status of your favorite book, film, catchphrase, etc.\n\nConnect With Us\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\n- Email: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction\n\n- Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\n- Music: Madison Hill\n\n- Artwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.

Madison attempts not one, but two, terrible accents. Chelsea questions why she ever agreed to watch this movie, much less continue this podcast. While Madison can forgive the (admittedly) lackluster film for the inclusion of Dermot Mulroney, Chelsea isn't so easily swayed. Will this movie stand up to the rom-com criteria set forth or will it fail to make it to the second date?

Chelsea and Madison rank the 13 films they watched this season from best to worst (or most favorite to least favorite), consider the impassioned perspectives of LAFSters, and share their hopes for Season Two.\n\nConnect With Us\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheLAFSPod\n\n- Email: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction\n\n- Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\n- Music: Madison Hill\n\n- Artwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.

Chelsea finally gets to experience joy while watching a movie for the first time in too long and Madison quickly dashes it by taking a perfectly good 90’s action film and insisting they turn it into a rom-com. They said it couldn’t be done; however, our hosts manage to do the impossible and they make Blade romantic…ish. At the very least, it has a potentially star-studded cast and really only needs an angel investor or two (looking at you, David Boreanaz).\n\nUse promo code \"LoveAtFirstSerum\" for 70% off your a signed copy of the soon-to-be written script of A Blade to the Heart (title under review).\n\nConnect With Us\n\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/loveatfirstscreening/\n\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheLAFSPod\n\n- Email: loveatfirstscreening@gmail.com\n\nProduction\n\n- Hosts: Chelsea Ciccone and Madison Hill\n\n- Music: Madison Hill\n\n- Artwork: Chelsea Ciccone\n\nAbout the Show\n\nAn examination of classic tropes and iconic characters pits connoisseur against cynic—one romantic comedy at a time.
