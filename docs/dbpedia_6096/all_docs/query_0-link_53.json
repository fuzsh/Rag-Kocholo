        "text": "Ancient Greek ruins tell the story of an incredibly influential civilization, pioneering artistic, intellectual, and scientific achievements that continue to have an impact on Western society to this day.\n\nTheir legacy is plain to see through the wealth of preserved historic sites dotted around Greece. From the iconic to the every day, there is an abundance of ruins in Greece dating back to ancient times, showcasing the natural beauty and landscape of the country. Alongside historical highlights, Greece offers delicious food, idyllic beaches, and a warm, vibrant culture, making it the perfect destination for learning about the past while enjoying the present.\n\nWhy Are Ancient Ruins in Greece Worth Visiting?\n\nExploring famous ruins in Greece and important cultural sites gives you the chance to learn how the Ancient Greeks worked, worshipped, and relaxed. Whether you’re traveling with kids or heading on a romantic honeymoon, visiting these ancient Greek ruins in person lets you connect with the cultures of the past and understand how they lived during the late Bronze Age and Hellenistic Period.\n\nThere are a wealth of ruins to view across the country, giving you the freedom to explore mainland Greece and its islands however you’d like. Many regard Athens as the best city in Greece for ruins, but islands like Crete and Santorini also offer plenty of opportunities to see remnants of the ancient world and learn about the Ancient Greeks. Additionally, a visit to northern Greece is a must for those interested in ancient ruins, as the region is home to the stunning monasteries of Meteora and Mount Athos. The drive to Meteora is also considered by many to be among the most scenic road trips one could take through mainland Greece.\n\nIn fact, as our Greece Expert and Travel Specialist Ashley Hall notes:\n\n“There are ruins and ancient sites at every corner you turn. Of course, the Acropolis is the most iconic, but do not miss the Temple of Apollo, Temple of Poseidon, and the Akrotiri of Thera in Santorini.”\n\nWherever you’d like to travel, our travel experts are on hand to help you plan your perfect Greece vacation, taking in all the best ruins along the way.\n\nThe Best Ancient Ruins in Greece\n\nFrom the most famous sites to the real hidden gems, here is our list of must-visit ancient ruins in Greece.\n\n1. Acropolis, Athens\n\nLocated in central Athens, the Acropolis is one of the most famous ancient ruins in Athens and Greece. The iconic location is home to four separate ruins, and after a short hike to the summit, you’ll see some of the most well-known and best-preserved ruins in all of Greece, dating back to the 5th century BC: the Parthenon, the Propylaea (the gateway to the Acropolis), the Erechtheion, and the temple of Athena Nike. The Acropolis is situated on Acropolis Hill, providing a stunning view of the city of Athens. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recogni\\ed for its significant cultural and historical value.\n\nWhether you’re admiring the bright marble remains or learning more about the area’s rich history at the Acropolis Museum, this is a must-see spot. Plus, as the highest point of the city, this hilltop grants stunning views and provides the perfect backdrop for photos. To get the most out of this iconic site, we’d also recommend visiting the Greek ruins in the Acropolis with a local guide who can answer any questions you may have.\n\n2. Ancient Agora of Athens, Athens\n\nIf you’re looking for more ruins to visit while in Athens or southern Greece, just a 15-minute walk from the base of the Acropolis is the Ancient Agora of Athens. In modern Greek, the word ‘agora’ means ‘marketplace’, a nod to this ancient site’s origins as a commercial and residential meeting place. The Ancient Agora of Athens, also known as the heart of ancient Athens, played a crucial role in shaping the city's political, religious, cultural, social, educational, administrative, philosophical, and financial life. The Agora houses several fascinating sites, including the stunning 5th century BC Temple of Hephaestus.\n\nWhile the archaeological site is smaller than some of the other ruins on this list, the agora does feature an on-site museum. Here you’ll find a range of artifacts that bring the area’s history to life for children and adults alike.\n\n3. Panathenaic Stadium, Athens\n\nBefore you leave Athens, another one of the top ancient ruins in Greece you should visit is the Panathenaic Stadium. This impressive stadium was originally built in 330 BC but was rebuilt in 144 AD, becoming the only stadium in the world fully constructed out of marble - truly a memorable sight.\n\nAfter years of neglect, the stadium was excavated and used to host the first modern Olympic games in 1896, paying homage to its athletic and community roots.\n\n4. Archaeological Site of Olympia, Peloponnese\n\nWest of Athens, the hilltop villages of the Peloponnese are also steeped in history, and nowhere is this more evident than at the archaeological site of Olympia.\n\nOlympia played a pivotal role in ancient Greek society as a key religious site, not to mention its roots as the birthplace of the Olympic games in 776 BC. Nowadays, visitors can wander through ruins like the Ancient Stadium or the Temple of Zeus, home to the famous Statue of Zeus that was once listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Be sure to set aside time to explore the three on-site museums, especially those dedicated to the modern and ancient Olympic games.\n\n5. Ancient Mycenae, Peloponnese\n\nAncient Mycenae is one of the oldest and biggest ruins in Greece and should be at the top of any keen historian’s list. Potentially dating as far back as the 7th century BC, this fortified city plays an important role in Greek mythology and history, appearing in Homer’s epics, The Odyssey and The Iliad, and acting as the base for mainland Europe's first Bronze Age society.\n\nToday, a guided tour of the city is the best way to explore this hub of Ancient Greek and Bronze Age civilization, marveling at remains like the imposing Lion Gate and the Treasury of Atreus. Its hilltop position also affords spectacular views of the Greek countryside and the sparkling Argolic Gulf.\n\n6. Theater of Epidaurus, Argolis\n\nBuilt into the verdant hillside of Argolis in the Peloponnese during the 4th century BC, the ancient Theater of Epidaurus is one of the best-preserved ruins in Greece. Seating 16,000 people, this impressive structure was lauded in the ancient world and would have been used for a variety of plays and musical performances. It still hosts an annual arts festival to this day, taking place between June and August.\n\n7. Temple of Poseidon, Sounio\n\nJust an hour’s drive from Athens, Sounion is the perfect day trip destination, especially for those searching for ancient Greek ruins to visit. From idyllic swimming spots to authentic restaurants, there’s plenty to draw visitors to Sounion. The main attraction is undisputedly the hilltop Temple of Poseidon, with its towering columns and stunning views of the surrounding landscape. The Temple of Poseidon in Sounion is a prime example of Doric columns, with 16 still standing and providing a stunning backdrop to the Aegean Sea.\n\nDating from around 400 BC, this temple also makes up part of the Sacred Triangle of Greece, a trio of temples (including the Parthenon and the Temple of Aphaia in Aegina) which align on a map to form a triangle. While there are many guesses behind the temple’s triangular arrangement, what we know for sure is this layout means you can easily visit all three without having to travel too far.\n\n8. Temple of Apollo, Delphi\n\nAnother one of the most famous ancient ruins in Greece, the remains of the Temple of Apollo can be found just two hours northwest of Athens in Ancient Delphi. Built in the 5th century BC and set atop the slopes of Mount Parnassos, the Temple of Apollo was a primary location for worshipping the Greek god of the sun. People from across ancient Greece would travel to Delphi to pray at the temple and meet the renowned oracle of Delphi, who would impart wisdom and advice from Apollo himself.\n\nOnce an important historical location, nowadays, Delphi is home to both a small, modern town and a major archaeological site featuring numerous ruins like the Temple of Apollo, perfect for a day trip. It’s also home to the remains of a 5,000-seat amphitheater which hosted the Pythian Games - a celebrated series of sports and art competitions.\n\n9. Minoan Palace of Knossos, Crete\n\nInterested in learning more about the country’s rich and varied ancient cultures? Knossos is one of our favorite ancient ruins in Crete, Greece, full of remnants from the Minoan civilization. Known for their impressive cities and palaces, extensive trading, and sophisticated art forms, the Minoans brought the Bronze Age to the island of Crete.\n\nYou can see this legacy today in the ruins that remain in Knossos, especially the Minoan Palace with its maze of rooms, vibrant frescoes, and striking red walls. This labyrinth-like structure supposedly inspired the myth of the Minotaur, a fierce beast that was defeated by the legendary hero, Theseus. While on Crete, be sure to visit the Heraklion Archaeological Museum to see wall frescoes and objects that were found inside the Palace of Knossos.\n\n10. Akrotiri of Thera, Santorini\n\nSantorini is a beautiful island known for its stunning beaches, picturesque caldera, and iconic blue-domed buildings, but did you know it’s also home to an archaeological wonder?\n\nSimilarly to Pompeii in Italy, the ancient city of Akrotiri was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1450 BC, leaving behind some of the best-preserved ancient ruins in Greece. This volcanic eruption is also what created Santorini’s breathtaking caldera.\n\nWander through the ruins to see streets, murals, and furniture that capture a snapshot of daily life in this busy urban hub, all beautifully preserved by volcanic ash. Visit with a local guide to learn more about the Minoan civilization that once called this city home."
