        "text": "Dr. Rosalynn Quinones\n\nThis course is designed for science and non‐science majors and will begin with an introduction to some basic principles of light, color, and chemistry. These principles will be used to investigate artists’ materials. In ancient Greek art, the philosophers held a theoretical view of color and art while the artists were more pragmatic in their production of art. Causes of deterioration will be explored. Scientific methods to analyze works of art including microscopic analysis and techniques using X-rays, ultraviolet, and infrared light will be introduced. Conservation and restoration topics will be addressed. Field trips to art galleries, museums, and restoration laboratories are an important part of this course.\n\nDr. Mary Sheridan\n\nRecent popularity in the retelling of Greek myths highlights how fresh takes on these ancient stories have much to teach us about the current moment. Whether critically acclaimed books like Home Fire or The New York Times best seller Circe, these reworkings ask us to consider who can be a story teller? What stories are occluded? How have answers to these questions endured or altered across time and place? We will explore these questions by analyzing how contemporary literary reworkings can inform our experience in Greece, where cultural stories are chiseled in architecture, hung in galleries, and adorn the everyday, from coffee shops to street names. By the end of the course, you’ll be attuned to the stories and story tellers various cultures privilege, and the consequences of that privileging.\n\nAll KIIS course credit is awarded by Western Kentucky University. Prior to your KIIS program, please speak with your home campus academic advisor and/or study abroad office to determine course equivalencies. Grades will be transferred to your home institution in late January after the completion of the program. Course offerings are subject to change according to enrollment. For more information, visit Transcripts & Grades.\n\nTo help you budget, keep in mind that you are responsible for the cost of your textbooks & materials, passport fees ($165), two meals per day + personal expenses (approx. $400, or if you are an avid shopper, you may consider bringing additional funds), and any fees from your college/university.\n\nAlthough KIIS tries to foresee all possible expenses in formulating program fees, please note that dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency valuations and/or airline surcharges may affect the total cost of the program.\n\nThe Greece Winter program offers a group flight option where you can travel to/from Athens, Greece with other students and faculty. If you choose this option, KIIS will purchase a round-trip flight ticket for you. The flight cost will be added to your final program fee on November 1. The group flight will depart from Cincinnati or Louisville.\n\nIf not selecting the group flight, you are responsible to purchase your own roundtrip airfare.\n\nThe flight to Athens, Greece is overnight arriving the following morning. On the return, the flight from Greece to the USA departs and arrives on the same day.Visit Flights and Passports & Visas for more information.\n\nDr. Mary Sheridan\n\nRecent popularity in the retelling of Greek myths highlights how fresh takes on these ancient stories have much to teach us about the current moment.
