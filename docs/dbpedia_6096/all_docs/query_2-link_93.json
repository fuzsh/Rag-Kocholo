        "text": "Director Luca Guadagnino has a track record of placing locations at the centre of his work. In his previous film, 2015’s A Bigger Splash, the Italian island of Pantelleria pretty much drove the plot, drawing his characters into a series of drastic actions. This time, the effect is just as powerful but altogether more beatific.\n\nGuadagnino is a little cagey about the details, giving us just the on-screen line that the story takes place ‘somewhere in Northern Italy’. He does tell all in the end titles, though, so perhaps his reservation is that this is home territory for him. André Aciman’s source novel was set on the coast, but the director moved the action to Lombardy, chiefly the town of Crema, an hour from Milan and close to where he lives. ‘It is quintessentially Italian without being an idea of Italy,’ he explained. ‘It’s just Italy.’\n\nOf course, ‘just Italy’ is just gorgeous. The 17th-century mansion where Elio lives with his family, the Villa Albergoni, is just south in Moscazzano and sadly not open to visitors. Console yourself that this means you’ll never have to find out that both the peach trees and plunge pool that play central roles were faked up.\n\nTo the north-west is Pandino, site of the striking war memorial in Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, where Elio begins to declare his feelings to Oliver, and the Gothic-style Castello Visconteo beyond, where visitors are free to look around the outside. For wild swimming, stay north of Crema for the Laghetto dei Riflessi, where Elio takes his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel) after dancing to The Psychedelic Furs at the village discoteca, or to Fontanile Quarantina, a park near Capralba further north-west, where he and Oliver swim after a long cycle ride.\n\nAlmost as famous is Cascate del Serio, the waterfall they visit in their last days together – it’s Europe’s second tallest, and a spectacular sight even for those not in the grips of passion and erotic metaphor.\n\nFinally, if you can’t resist the chance to relive the heartbreak, the station where Elio and Oliver part is at Pizzighettone (even though Elio asks his mother to pick him up at Clusone). It is, inevitably, beautiful.\n\n‘Call Me By Your Name’ is available on DVD or streaming services\n\nLike this?
