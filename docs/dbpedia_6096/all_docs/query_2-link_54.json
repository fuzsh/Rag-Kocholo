        "text": "The article interrogates the rationale and origins of changing imaginaries of tourism in Greece in the context of the current economic crisis. We detect a radical change in the 'picture' of the country that circulates in global media conduits (YouTube, Facebook, official press websites and personal blogs). We enact a journey into past media representations of Greece as an idyllic peasant and working-class site, but proceed to highlight that such representations are being recycled today by Greeks (especially but not exclusively) living and studying abroad. This stereotype, which focuses on embodied understandings of happiness and well-being, is being challenged by the current economic crisis. In its place, we detect the emergence of a new dark and slum imaginary, propagated by both native and global intellectuals–activists. The new imaginary both tests in practice and bears the potential to re-invent Greece as a tourist destination. Not only is the change informed by the European histories of art, slum and dark tourism, focusing on middle-class refinement and philanthropy, it also bears the potential to promote Greece as a cultural tourist destination in global value hierarchies in controversial ways.\n\nThis article examines how four Greek films of the 1950s and early 1960s, set in different islands, presented island life: Stelios Tatasopoulos's Black Earth (1952), Michael Cacoyannis's The Girl in Black (1956), Roviros Manthoulis's Lefkada (1958), and Takis Kanellopoulos's Thasos (1961). These films were made at a period when wanderlust tourism predominated in Greece, as tourists' curiosity about unfamiliar places and their desire to learn about existing traditions and past cultures were stronger than their desire for relaxation. The article argues that despite their differences, these films reflected an understanding of Greek island life parallel to the culturally explorative experience of wanderlust tourism, while their directors borrowed from and adapted foreign film methods to serve their explorative concerns. As a result, these films produced images of Greek islands which would largely disappear from the screens and popular discourse—a difficult life, financial hardship, paganism, and folk traditions—thus challenging us to reconceptualize Mediterranean life as more multifaceted than the one we imagine in this era of mass tourism.\n\n‘White City’, Christian’s documentary commissioned by the Greek National Tourism Organisation, emphasises thebright sun and the bright marble so as to rebrand the Greek capital as a modern tourist utopia. The cinematic portrayal of modern Athens in touristic films offers a rich cultural database for drawing conclusions about film-induced tourism and city branding policies for the metropolis of the future. Investigating the processes involved in reinventing identities for historical cities, via the moving image, for the tourist, lies at the very heart of this paper’s aims. This analysis proposes a toolkit for tracing transformations that have to do with the shifting mentality of thetimes: moving from culture to recreation. Architecture portrayed in touristic films provides a familiar backdrop for the international audience and propagandises national continuity. Christian’s film is used advisedly as it proposes acritical reconsideration of policy-making for the branding of historic cities and mature destinations.\n\nWithin the frame of the current Greek economic crisis (2008 – present), this paper investigates how ancient heritage deemed “Greek” is significant in forming Modern Greek identity and how the crisis may have impacted such appropriations. It explores how contemporary socio-political tensions have brought about multiple and conflicting versions of “Greek identity.” Archaeological excavations in several Greek cities, street art and graffiti as well as The Parthenon Bomber, a novel republished in 2010, during the crisis, are examined in order to reveal how elements of ancient Greek heritage are valued and how identity is expressed. Ancient heritage is valued differently by its multitude of stakeholders, which affects the valuing of antiquities and the representation of heritage in contemporary art forms. The protection and management of antiquities rank highly in Greece, as antiquities have long been an essential component of Greek heritage and thus identity. However, not all antiquities are valued equally. The Greek state has time and again placed the Classical, and now recently the Hellenistic past and their physical remains, highly in its official narrative of the past. Other pasts, such as the Roman, the Ottoman, or even parts of the Byzantine are more controversial. It has yet to fully incorporate the Byzantine past because it is not considered Greek enough to fit into the Greek canon. Subversive expressions of heritage challenge this canon of Greekness and the official narrative. Street art, graffiti as well as The Parthenon Bomber, explore methods of protest against authority and the state by subverting ancient heritage and altering its symbolic capital. Street artists use a wide range of ancient imagery and focus on transforming the values of gods and iconic figures from Greek History and Mythology. While street art forms also include ancient monuments, this is the focus of the novel where the author questions state authority by destroying one of the nation’s most symbolic monuments."
