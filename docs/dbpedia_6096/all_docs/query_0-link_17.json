[Full review in Spanish]\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nWith its portrait of cranky, uninterested tourists, rowdy Aussies, fat Yanks, dingy hotels, shady merchants and busted buses, Ruins feels like somebody's personal vendetta against the travel industry.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nAs a tour guide, Georgia rates as \"average,\" as a movie star Vardalos rates much the same.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nThe story is loaded with cliches and weak characters that are simply too annoying to handle.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nVardalos is fine, but Petrie and writer Mike Reiss yoke her to an ossified formula in which various national stereotypes (and the character actors who play them) embarrass themselves in bazaars and at Greek temples.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
