        "text": "(see Under the Tuscan Sun, How Stella Got Her Groove Back, Shirley Valentine.) One also has to wonder about the shameless product placements (how much did IHOP pay to have their name mentioned so often in the warn-out jokes around pancakes?) And to make things worse, there is a homophobic scene in which two predatory sex-crazed gay Greek men prey on the naïve American college student who unknowingly wears a shirt that says \"Enter from the rear\" in Greek. Reportedly, Vardalos fought to have this scene cut from the film, but lost the battle with producers, a fact that is puzzling considering one of the producers is her friend and former collaborator, Rita Wilson. Like her follow-up film, Connie and Carla, there may be too many expectations around My Life in Ruins to live up to the unexpected $300 million surprise of Vardalos' first film. So far, the film cost $17 million to make, and over the opening weekend it grossed $3.2 million. Let's hope that at least Greek people will buy the dvd, and it eventually breaks even. Otherwise, it may vary well be Vardalos' career that's left in ruins.\n\nThat said, I continue to stand by Vardalos and her body of work, not just because she is Greek, but because she is one of the few women working as an independent (whether as an actress, writer, producer, or with her soon to be released film, I Hate Valentine's Day, a director). The characters she chooses to play are independent Greek women who take risks, embrace their heritage, and ultimately end up happy. Her Greek-themed films continue to create an important dialog about modern Greek identities and the diaspora. My Life in Ruins explores the tensions between ancient and modern Greece with insight and humor. The depictions of various national groups are stereotypes, but they are recognizable to anyone who has traveled to Greece and paid attention to the constantly changing culture of tourism in Greece. Perhaps this is a subtle critique of this phenomenon from Vardalos' Greek perspective. If her film contributes to the narrow image of Greece as a magical, escapist playground for foreigners and encourages even more of the ugly tourism embodied by the cast, it also contains a valid critique of the capitalist attitudes of post-EU Greece and those who comply with the greed of making a quick buck in exchange for the consumption of that image. Premiering the film in Greece a month before its release in the States shows that Vardalos is conscious of these inter-cultural issues, and sensitive to her Greek identity and its roots.\n\nUltimately, Vardalos' films are lighthearted and funny, made with a gentle hand which, although cliché at times, avoid selling out to the graphic sex-and-violence formula found in most American films. Toula and Georgia, who both start out as self-deprecating, depressed, and lost until they arc through a soulful transformation only to emerge as a beautiful and fulfilled butterfly at the hands of a handsome, long-haired love interest are repetitive. But, they allow her to laugh at herself with a refreshing sense of humility not found in many Hollywood A-list actresses. More importantly, Vardalos invites audiences to laugh along with her. And although according to Procopis, \"laughter is good\" and as it is implied, inherently \"Greek\", rarely have we Greeks been able to laugh at ourselves. Pride or hubris may be closer to our most common reactions when it comes to history, identity and culture. If you don't believe me, just ask any Greek to engage in a conversation about any of the following topics: The Elgin Marbles, The Greek War of Independence, the partitioning of Cyprus' and try to have a discussion that does not end in a nationalistic and decidedly unfunny rendition of Greekness.\n\nI wonder if these films aren't experienced differently by Greeks of the diaspora who identify with Vardalos' characters who seem to be caught in between the insider/outsider spaces of cultural meanings. Hearing Vardalos tentatively yet eloquently rattle off a few phrases in Greek while talking to her bus driver, Poupi sent a sweet chill up my spine and left me longing to return to Greece this summer and lick and ice cream cone while taking a volta through Monastiraki. After all, aren't even the most cynical of us still enamored by Greece? I don't know anyone, Greek or otherwise, when strolling through Plaka on a warm summer night and when looking up, catching a glimpse of the majestic Acropolis under a full moon, who doesn't feel a little bit of kefi moving under their skin. For us Greeks who do not live in Greece, the feeling is both familiar and exciting, just like Vardalos' film.\n\nApril Kalogeropoulos Householder is a part-time faculty member in the Gender and Women's Studies Program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where she teaches courses in Film and Media Studies.
