        "text": "Over 40 premieres - films, series, and animation - will be presented by Russian content makers and distributors at the European Film Market (EFM) from February 10 to 17. Under the Russian Content Worldwide (RCW) brand, 39 participating companies will unite at a virtual stand organized by Roskino, a Russian film promotion body, with the support of the Russian Cinema Fund. In total, Russian companies will present more than 130 projects.\n\nEvgenia Markova, CEO of Roskino: “At the beginning of the year, the Russian film industry is announcing itself loudly and proudly at the film market, which traditionally begins the film year, where the main trends of the global film industry are set, and where directions for further development are determined. For the first time in Berlin, Russian regional cinematography is strongly presented—the works of Yakut directors are at the Russian Content Worldwide (RCW) booth at the film market (two premieres), and in the short film competition of the film festival. I am incredibly pleased that new talents from the regions keep appearing, and we will make every effort to promote them to the world. I would also like to note the large number of premieres from Russian online platforms, which once again proves the creative potential of modern VOD services and the great audience demand for their original content.”\n\nFILMS AND SERIES\n\nThe key projects of Central Partnership are the films \"The World Champion\" and \"First Oscar\".
