Mr. Putin's Kremlin employs an asymmetric arsenal that includes military invasions, cyberattacks, disinformation, support for fringe political groups, and the weaponization of energy resources, organized crime, and corruption. The Kremlin has refined the use of these tools over time and these attacks have intensified in scale and complexity across Europe. If the United States fails to work with urgency to address this complex and growing threat, the regime in Moscow will become further emboldened. It will continue to develop and refine its arsenal to use on democracies around the world, including against U.S. elections in 2018 and 2020. Following attacks like Pearl Harbor and 9/11, U.S. presidents have rallied the country and the world to address the challenges facing the nation. Yet the current President of the United States has barely acknowledged the threat posed by Mr. Putin's repeated attacks on democratic governments and institutions, let alone exercised the kind of leadership history has shown is necessary to effectively counter this kind of aggression. Never before in American history has so clear a threat to national security been so clearly ignored by a U.S. president. The threat posed by Mr. Putin's meddling existed before the current U.S. Administration, and may well extend beyond it. Yet, as this report will demonstrate, the Russian government's malign influence operations can be deterred. Several countries in Europe took notice of the Kremlin's efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election and realized the danger posed to their democracies. They have taken steps to build resilience against Mr. Putin's aggression and interference, and the range of effective measures implemented by European countries provide valuable lessons for the United States. To that end, this report recommends a series of actions that the United States should take across government, civil society, and the private sector--and in cooperation with our allies--to push back against the Kremlin's aggression and establish a set of long-term norms that can neutralize such efforts to undermine democracy. Yet it must be noted that without leadership from the President, any attempt to marshal such a response will be inherently weakened at the outset. (v) In addition, it is important to draw a distinction between Mr. Putin's corrupt regime and the people of Russia. Many Russian citizens strive for a transparent, accountable government that operates under the democratic rule of law, and we hold hope for better relations in the future with a Russian government that reflects these demands. In the meantime, the United States must work with our allies to build defenses against Mr. Putin's asymmetric arsenal, and strengthen international norms and values to deter such behavior by Russia or any other country. The events discussed in this report are illustrative, not exhaustive, and cover a period ending on December 31, 2017. There are several important geographic areas that remain beyond the scope of this report, including the Russian government's role in the Syria conflict, its complicated relationship with Turkey, or its involvement in places like Central Asia and Latin America. The Russian government's use of corruption and money laundering also merit additional examination by relevant committees in Congress, as well as the Executive Branch. Given the ongoing investigations by the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, this report does not delve into Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Furthermore, U.S. election infrastructure, electrical grids, and information systems are outside the jurisdiction of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and therefore beyond the scope of the recommendations in this report, but certainly warrant further study. Finally, there must be a bipartisan sense of urgency so the United States immediately begins taking the steps necessary to fortify and protect our democracy from Mr. Putin's malicious meddling. There is a long bipartisan tradition in Congress in support of firm policies to counter Russian government aggression and abuse against its own citizens, our allies, and universal values. This report seeks to continue that tradition. Sincerely, Benjamin L. Cardin, Ranking Member . PUTIN'S ASYMMETRIC ASSAULT ON DEMOCRACY IN RUSSIA AND EUROPE: IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ---------- Executive Summary ---------- Nearly 20 years ago, Vladimir Putin gained and solidified power by exploiting blackmail, fears of terrorism, and war. Since then, he has combined military adventurism and aggression abroad with propaganda and political repression at home, to persuade a domestic audience that he is restoring Russia to greatness and a respected position on the world stage. All the while, he has empowered the state security services and employed them to consolidate his hold on the levers of political, social, and economic power, which he has used to make himself and a circle of loyalists extraordinarily wealthy. Democracies like the United States and those in Europe present three distinct challenges to Mr. Putin. First, the sanctions they have collectively placed on his regime for its illegal occupation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine threaten the ill-gotten wealth of his loyalists and hamper their extravagant lifestyles. Second, Mr. Putin sees successful democracies, especially those along Russia's periphery, as threats to his regime because they present an attractive alternative to his corrupt and criminal rule. Third, democracies with transparent governments, the rule of law, a free media, and engaged citizens are naturally more resilient to the spread of corruption beyond Russia's borders, thereby limiting the opportunities for the further enrichment of Putin and his chosen elite. Mr. Putin has thus made it a priority of his regime to attack the democracies of Europe and the United States and undermine the transatlantic alliance upon which Europe's peace and prosperity have depended upon for over 70 years. He has used the security services, the media, public and private companies, organized criminal groups, and social and religious organizations to spread malicious disinformation, interfere in elections, fuel corruption, threaten energy security, and more. At their most extreme, the Russian government's security services have been used to harass and even assassinate political enemies at home and abroad; cheat at the Olympic Games; and protect and exploit cybercriminals in Russia who attack American businesses and steal the financial information of American consumers. Mr. Putin resorts to the use of these asymmetric tools to achieve his goals because he is operating from a position of weakness--hobbled by a faltering economy, a substandard military, and few followers on the world stage. The tactics that Putin has deployed to undermine democracies abroad were developed at home, and over nearly two decades he has used them against the Russian people with increased impunity. The result has been hundreds of billions of dollars stolen and spirited away abroad, all while independent media and civil society, elections, political parties, and cultural institutions have been manipulated and suppressed, significantly hindering effective domestic opposition to Putin's regime. While consolidating his grip on power at home, Mr. Putin oversaw an opportunistic expansion of malign influence operations abroad, targeting vulnerable states on Russia's periphery, as well as countries in Western institutions like the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Kremlin has substantially increased its investments in propaganda outlets beyond Russia's borders, funded and supported nongovernmental organizations and political parties that advanced Mr. Putin's anti-EU and anti- NATO agenda, nationalized mafia groups to help launder money and commit other crimes for the state abroad, and used its near-monopoly over energy supplies in some countries to exert influence and spread corruption. In semi-consolidated democracies and transitional governments on Russia's periphery, the Kremlin most aggressively targets states that seek to integrate with the EU and NATO or present an opportunity to weaken those institutions from within. For example, as Georgia and Ukraine moved closer to these institutions, the Russian government attacked them with cyberwarfare, disinformation campaigns, and military force. When the Kremlin's attempt to politically influence Montenegro's election failed, its security services allegedly tried to launch a coup. In Serbia, the Kremlin exploits cultural connections and leverages its near monopoly on energy supplies to attempt to slow down or derail the country's Western integration efforts. And though they are in the EU and NATO, countries like Hungary and Bulgaria face acute challenges from the Russian government, which exerts significant influence in politics, business, and the energy sector. Despite some efforts to counter Russian malign influence, these countries remain significantly vulnerable to the Kremlin's corrupt agenda. In consolidated democracies within the EU and NATO, the Russian government seeks to undermine support for sanctions against Russia, interfere in elections through overt or covert support of sympathetic political parties and the spread of disinformation, and sow discord and confusion by exacerbating existing social and political divisions through disinformation and cultivated ideological groups. This group of countries has developed several effective countermeasures that both deter Russian government behavior and build societal resilience. As it crafts its response, the United States should look to these lessons learned: The United Kingdom has made a point to publicly chastise the Russian government for its meddling in democracies, and moved to strengthen cybersecurity and electoral processes. Germany pre-empted Kremlin interference in its national election with a strong warning of consequences, an agreement among political parties not to use bots or paid trolls, and close cyber cooperation between the government and political campaigns. Spain has led Europe in cracking down on Russia-based organized crime groups that use the country as an operational base and node for money laundering and other crimes. France has fostered strong cooperation between government, political, and media actors to blunt the impact of the Kremlin's cyber-hacking and smear campaigns. The Nordic states have largely adopted a ``whole of society'' approach against Mr. Putin's malign influence operations, involving the government, civil society, the media, and the private sector, with an emphasis on teaching critical thinking and media literacy. The Baltic states have kept their publics well-informed of the malicious activities of Russia's security services, strengthened defenses against cyberattacks and disinformation, and diversified energy supplies to reduce dependence on Russia. While the countries of Europe have each had unique responses to the Kremlin's aggression, they have also begun to use regional institutions to knit together their efforts and develop best practices. NATO and the EU have launched centers focused on strategic communications and cyber defense, and Finland's government hosts a joint EU/NATO center for countering hybrid threats. A number of independent think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also launched regional disinformation monitoring and fact-checking operations, and European governments are supporting regional programs to strengthen independent journalism and media literacy. Some of these initiatives are relatively new, but several have already begun to bear fruit and warrant continued investment and broader expansion. Through the adoption of the Third Energy Package, which promotes energy diversification and integration, as well as a growing resistance to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, many European countries are reducing their dependence on Russian energy supplies, though much remains to be done. Despite the clear assaults on our democracy and our allies in Europe, the U.S. government still does not have a coherent, comprehensive, and coordinated approach to the Kremlin's malign influence operations, either abroad or at home. Although the U.S. government has for years had a patchwork of offices and programs supporting independent journalism, cyber security, and the countering of disinformation, the lack of presidential leadership in addressing the threat Putin poses has hampered a strong U.S. response. In early 2017, Congress provided the State Department's Global Engagement Center the resources and mandate to address Kremlin disinformation campaigns, but operations have been stymied by the Department's hiring freeze and unnecessarily long delays by its senior leadership in transferring authorized funds to the office. While many mid- level and some senior-level officials throughout the State Department and U.S. government are cognizant of the threat posed by Mr. Putin's asymmetric arsenal, the U.S. President continues to deny that any such threat exists, creating a leadership vacuum in our own government and among our European partners and allies. key recommendations The recommendations below are based on a review of Mr. Putin's efforts to undermine democracy in Europe and effective responses to date. By implementing these recommendations, the United States can better defend against and deter the Kremlin's malign influence operations, and strengthen international norms and values to prevent such behavior by Russia and other states. A more comprehensive list of recommendations can be found in Chapter Eight. 1. Assert Presidential Leadership and Launch a National Response: President Trump has been negligent in acknowledging and responding to the threat to U.S. national security posed by Mr. Putin's meddling. The President should immediately declare that it is U.S. policy to counter and deter all forms of Russian hybrid threats against the United States and around the world. The President should establish a high-level inter- agency fusion cell, modeled on the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), to coordinate all elements of U.S. policy and programming in response to the Russian government's malign influence operations. And the President should present to Congress a comprehensive national strategy to counter these grave national security threats and work with the Congress and our allies to get this strategy implemented and funded. 2. Support Democratic Institution Building and Values Abroad and with a Stronger Congressional Voice: Democracies with transparent governments, the rule of law, a free media, and engaged citizens are naturally more resilient to Mr. Putin's asymmetric arsenal. The U.S. government should provide assistance, in concert with allies in Europe, to build democratic institutions within the European and Eurasian states most vulnerable to Russian government interference. Using the funding authorization outlined in the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act as policy guidance, the U.S. government should increase this spending in Europe and Eurasia to at least $250 million over the next two fiscal years. To reinforce these efforts, the U.S. government should demonstrate clear and sustained diplomatic leadership in support of individual human rights that form the backbone of democratic systems. Members in the U.S. Congress have a responsibility to show U.S. leadership on values by making democracy and human rights a central part of their agendas. They should conduct committee hearings and use other platforms and opportunities to publicly advance these issues. 3. Expose and Freeze Kremlin-Linked Dirty Money: Corruption provides the motivation and the means for many of the Kremlin's malign influence operations. The U.S. Treasury Department should make public any intelligence related to Mr. Putin's personal corruption and wealth stored abroad, and take steps with our European allies to cut off Mr. Putin and his inner circle from the international financial system. The U.S. government should also expose corrupt and criminal activities associated with Russia's state-owned energy sector. Furthermore, it should robustly implement the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which allow for sanctions against corrupt actors in Russia and abroad. In addition, the U.S. government should issue yearly reports that assign tiered classifications based on objective third-party corruption indicators, as well as governmental efforts to combat corruption. 4. Subject State Hybrid Threat Actors to an Escalatory Sanctions Regime: The Kremlin and other regimes hostile to democracy must know that there will be consequences for their actions. The U.S. government should designate countries that employ malign influence operations to assault democracies as State Hybrid Threat Actors. Countries that are designated as such would fall under a preemptive and escalatory sanctions regime that would be applied whenever the state uses asymmetric weapons like cyberattacks to interfere with a democratic election or disrupt a country's critical infrastructure. The U.S. government should work with the EU to ensure that these sanctions are coordinated and effective. 5. Publicize the Kremlin's Global Malign Influence Efforts: Exposing and publicizing the nature of the threat of Russian malign influence activities, as the U.S. intelligence community did in January 2017, can be an action-forcing event that not only boosts public awareness, but also drives effective responses from the private sector, especially social media platforms, as well as civil society and independent media, who can use the information to pursue their own investigations. The U.S. government should produce yearly public reports that detail the Russian government's malign influence operations in the United States and around the world. 6. Build an International Coalition to Counter Hybrid Threats: The United States is stronger and more effective when we work with our partners and allies abroad. The U.S. government should lead an international effort of like- minded democracies to build awareness of and resilience to the Kremlin's malign influence operations. Specifically, the President should convene an annual global summit on hybrid threats, modeled on the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL or the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) summits that have taken place since 2015. Civil society and the private sector should participate in the summits and follow-on activities. 7. Uncover Foreign Funding that Erodes Democracy: Foreign illicit money corrupts the political, social, and economic systems of democracies. The United States and European countries must make it more difficult for foreign actors to use financial resources to interfere in democratic systems, specifically by passing legislation to require full disclosure of shell company owners and improve transparency for funding of political parties, campaigns, and advocacy groups. 8. Build Global Cyber Defenses and Norms: The United States and our European allies remain woefully vulnerable to cyberattacks, which are a preferred asymmetric weapon of state hybrid threat actors. The U.S. government and NATO should lead a coalition of countries committed to mutual defense against cyberattacks, to include the establishment of rapid reaction teams to defend allies under attack. The U.S. government should also call a special meeting of the NATO heads of state to review the extent of Russian government-sponsored cyberattacks among member states and develop formal guidelines on how the Alliance will consider such attacks in the context of NATO's Article 5 collective defense provision. Furthermore, the U.S. government should lead an effort to establish an international treaty on the use of cyber tools in peace time, modeled on international arms control treaties. 9. Hold Social Media Companies Accountable: Social media platforms are a key conduit of disinformation campaigns that undermine democracies. U.S. and European governments should mandate that social media companies make public the sources of funding for political advertisements, along the same lines as TV channels and print media. Social media companies should conduct comprehensive audits on how their platforms may have been used by Kremlin-linked entities to influence elections occurring over the past several years, and should establish civil society advisory councils to provide input and warnings about emerging disinformation trends and government suppression. In addition, they should work with philanthropies, governments, and civil society to promote media literacy and reduce the presence of disinformation on their platforms. 10. Reduce European Dependence on Russian Energy Sources: Payments to state-owned Russian energy companies fund the Kremlin's military aggression abroad, as well as overt and covert activities that undermine democratic institutions and social cohesion in Europe and the United States. The U.S. government should use its trade and development agencies to support strategically important energy diversification and integration projects in Europe. In addition, the U.S. government should continue to oppose the construction of Nord Stream 2, a project which significantly undermines the long-term energy security of Europe and the economic prospects of Ukraine. ---------- Chapter 1: Putin's Rise and Motivations ---------- A Russian interior minister once remarked that ``we are on the eve of a revolution'' and ``to avert a revolution, we need a small victorious war'' to ``distract the attention of the masses.'' \\1\\ While he made the comment in 1903, the year before the Russian Empire entered a disastrous war with Imperial Japan, he could also have been speaking before Russian forces invaded Chechnya in 1999, Georgia in 2008, Ukraine in 2014, or Syria in 2015. Those conflicts reflect a nearly twenty-year pattern of the Kremlin prosecuting similar `'small'' wars to achieve internal political objectives, revealing a direct link between the Russian government's external aggression and its internal oppression.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Simon Montefiore, The Romanovs, Alfred A. Knopf, at 514 (2016). When he made the remark, Vyacheslav Plehve, Tsar Nicholas's interior minister, had just put down a strike in Odessa. He had also turned the Ohkrana, the nickname for the Security Bureau, into ``the world's most sophisticated secret police.'' Ibid. at 510. Lenin adopted the Ohkrana's methods when he formed the Cheka, predecessor of Stalin's NKVD, which became the KGB and, in its current incarnation, the FSB. Ben Fischer, Okhrana: The Paris Operations of the Russian Imperial Police, Diane Publishing, at 10 (1999). \\2\\ See Statement of Daniel B. Baer, The European Union as a Partner Against Russian Aggression: Sanctions, Security, Democratic Institutions and the Way Forward, Hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Apr. 4, 2017. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin has used a sophisticated combination of propaganda and suppression to keep the Russian public supportive of wars abroad and distracted from the regime's criminality and corruption at home. Putin's overarching domestic objectives are to preserve his power and increase his net worth, and he appears to have calculated that his regime can best do so by inflating his approval ratings with aggressive behavior abroad.\\3\\ While the first-order effect of Putin's survival methodology poses a serious threat to global peace and stability, it has also created a profound series of second-order effects that threaten to corrode democratic institutions and open economies around the world, including here in the United States. It is not enough to sell the necessity of Russia's foreign interventions to only a domestic audience and to delegitimize or silence any Russian voices that rise in opposition. For Putin to succeed, he also requires a divided opposition abroad. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Putin's net worth is estimated at between $40 billion and $200 billion (at the low end, making him the wealthiest person in Europe and, at the high end, in the world) and, as some believe, is held partly by a group of proxies. Samantha Karas, ``Vladimir Putin Net Worth 2017: Russia's Leader May Be One of the Richest Men in the World,'' International Business Times, Feb. 15, 2017; Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and Novaya Gazeta, Putin and the Proxies, https://www.occrp.org/en/putinandtheproxies, Oct. 24, 2017. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To that end, the Kremlin has honed its arsenal of malign influence operations at home and taken it global. And while the methods used may differ across countries, the goals are the same: sow distrust and confusion, promote radical voices on divisive political issues, and gain economic leverage, all while eroding support for the democratic process and rules- based institutions created in the aftermath of the Second World War. These efforts are largely led by the government's security services and buttressed by state-owned enterprises, Kremlin- aligned oligarchs, and Russian criminal groups that have effectively been nationalized by the state. The length and intensity of these operations emanate out in geographic concentric circles: they began in Russia, expanded to its periphery, then into the rest of Europe, and finally to the United States. The United States must now assume that the Kremlin will deploy in America the more dangerous tactics used successfully in Russia's periphery and the rest of Europe. This includes, for example, support for extremist and far-right groups that oppose democratic ideals, as well as attempts to co-opt politicians through economic corruption. Putin's regime appears intent on using almost any means possible to undermine the democratic institutions and transatlantic alliances that have underwritten peace and prosperity in Europe for the past 70-plus years. To understand the nature of this threat, it is important to first look at who is responsible for it, their motivations, and what they are willing and capable of doing to achieve their objectives. To that end, the rest of this chapter will detail how Putin rose to power by exploiting blackmail, the fear of terrorism, and war, and subsequently used the security services to consolidate political and economic power. The motivations and methods behind Putin's rise help explain how he views the role of the security services and his willingness to use them to do the regime's dirty work, including assaulting democratic institutions and values in Europe and the United States. ASCENT TO THE TOP In 1999, Russian president Boris Yeltsin faced a problem. His second presidential term would end the following year, and his political rivals appeared positioned to take power. Russians at the time were not happy with Yeltsin's tenure: hyperinflation, austerity, debt, and a disastrous privatization scheme combined to decrease GDP by over 40 percent between 1990 and 1998, a collapse that was twice as large and lasted three times longer than the Great Depression in the United States.\\4\\ The health and mortality crises that resulted from this economic disaster are estimated to have caused at least three million ``excess deaths.'' \\5\\ Yeltsin's approval ratings had also cratered amid allegations of rampant corruption, which also touched his family members. He needed a successor who could protect him and his family after he left office, but no one in his inner circle was nearly popular enough to secure victory.\\6\\ He finally settled on a relatively unknown bureaucrat to serve as his sixth prime minister in less than a year and a half: Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, who was then director of the Federal Security Service (or FSB, the KGB's successor). Why Putin? In the words of one Russia expert, ``it was like spin the bottle, and the bottle stopped spinning at Putin.'' \\7\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Robert English, ``Russia, Trump, and a New Detente,'' Foreign Affairs, Mar. 10, 2017. \\5\\ Ibid. \\6\\ Mikhail Zygar, All the Kremlin's Men, PublicAffairs, at 9 (2016). \\7\\ Eleanor Clift, ``Blame This Drunken Bear for Vladimir Putin,'' The Daily Beast, Apr. 22, 2014 (quoting Russian expert Strobe Talbott). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Putin had also shown that he was willing to protect Yeltsin and his family. In 1999, Russia's prosecutor general, Yury Skuratov, was conducting an investigation into high-level corruption in the Kremlin, including among Yeltsin's family members.\\8\\ As Skuratov was pursuing his investigation, Yeltsin's chief of staff summoned him to the Kremlin and showed him a grainy videotape that purported to show him with two prostitutes in a hotel room. Skuratov submitted his resignation, though he later insisted that the tape was a fabrication.\\9\\ But the resignation had to be approved by the upper chamber of Russia's parliament, the Federation Council, which insisted that Skuratov testify first. The day before his scheduled testimony, the sex tape was played on a television station after reportedly being personally delivered by Putin.\\10\\ When showing the tape on TV did not prove enough to push the Federation Council into action, Putin went on TV himself and told the Russian public that the man in the tape was indeed Skuratov.\\11\\ A former KGB general, Oleg Kalugin, maintains that the whole episode ``was a special FSB operation to discredit an official with the help of a video featuring a person who resembled the prosecutor-general.'' \\12\\ The `'special operation'' succeeded, and Yeltsin chose Putin to succeed him.\\13\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Sharon LaFraniere, ``Yeltsin Linked to Bribe Scheme,'' The Washington Post, Sept. 8, 1999. A Swiss construction company, Mabetex, which had won renovation contracts at the Kremlin, was found to have spent between $10-15 million on bribes for Russian officials, including President Yeltsin and his two daughters.

The tape was ``rumored to have been delivered personally to the head of RTR by `a man who looked like the head of the FSB,' who at the time was none other than Vladimir Putin.'' Ibid. \\11\\ Ibid. The tape was also reportedly authenticated by Yuri Chaika, who succeeded Skuratov as Russia's prosecutor general. Andrew E.

We should vote, forget about it, and get on with business. We all have things to do.'' \\16\\ Some in parliament were said to have supported Putin ``mainly because he will be yet another `technical' prime minister'' and would have ``no real political role.'' \\17\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\14\\ Vladimir Kura-Murza, ``The August Vote That Changed Russia's History,'' World Affairs, Aug. 16, 2017. \\15\\ Ibid. \\16\\ Ibid. \\17\\ Floriana Fossato, ``Russia: Duma Approves Putin as Prime Minister,'' Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Aug. 9, 1999. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A poll taken at the same time of the confirmation vote showed that just two percent of Russia's population favored Putin for the presidency.\\18\\ But it did not take long for Putin to seize on an opportunity--though a tragic one--to increase his public profile and strengthen his position to succeed Yeltsin. In early September 1999, less than three weeks after Putin was installed as prime minister, a series of large bombs destroyed apartment buildings in Dagestan, Volgodonsk, and Moscow, killing hundreds of people as they slept. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ International Republican Institute, Russia Presidential Pre- Election Assessment Report, at 7 (Mar. 20, 2000). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prime Minister Putin reacted fiercely and promised to hunt down the terrorists and even ``wipe them out in the outhouse,'' if that was where they chose to hide.\\19\\ Despite no clear evidence or claims of responsibility linking the bombings to ``Chechen terrorists,'' within days of the last explosion, Russian warplanes started a bombing campaign in Chechnya that the Russian defense minister claimed would ``eliminate the bandits,'' and within a week, Russian troops crossed Chechnya's border. \\20\\ As the war progressed, so did Putin's popularity, and the number of voters who said they would choose him for president increased sharply: from just two percent in August 1999 (before the bombings), to 21 percent in October, then nearly doubling to 40 percent in November, and reaching 55 percent in December.\\21\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ Sergei Karpov, ``Putin Vows to Annihilate `Terrorists' after Suicide Bombings,'' Reuters, Dec. 31, 2013. \\20\\ David Satter, The Less You Know, the Better You Sleep: Russia's Road to Terror and Dictatorship under Yeltsin and Putin, Yale University Press, at 11 (2016); Ruslan Musayev, ``Russia Prepared for Ground War Against Chechnya,'' Associated Press, Sept. 27, 1999. \\21\\ International Republican Institute, Russia Presidential Pre- Election Assessment Report, at 7 (Mar. 20, 2000). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yet even though Russian authorities said that there was a ``Chechen trail'' leading to the bombings, no Chechen claimed responsibility.\\22\\ In February 2000, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright if she believed that ``the Russian government is justified when it accuses Chechen groups as responsible for the bombings.''

With the advantage of incumbency, a short campaign period, a large amount of monetary support from business interests (the average check from oligarchs to the campaign was about $10 million), and rising popularity from the prosecution of the war in Chechnya, Putin won the presidency at the ballot box with 53 percent of the vote.\\24\\ For his first act as president, he guaranteed Yeltsin immunity from prosecution.\\25\\ He was now the most powerful man in Russia; yet even before his election, he had already been hard at work extending his influence throughout the government. Yeltsin would recall later in his memoirs that, after he appointed Putin as prime minister, ``[he] turned to me and requested absolute power . . . to coordinate all power structures.'' \\26\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\24\\ Zygar, All the Kremlin's Men, at 11; Michael Wines, ``Putin Wins Russia Vote in First Round, But His Majority Is Less Than Expected,'' The New York Times, Mar. 27, 2000. \\25\\ Statement of David Satter, Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute, Russia: Rebuilding the Iron Curtain, Hearing before the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, May 17, 2007. \\26\\ Amy Knight, ``Finally, We Know About the Moscow Bombings,'' The New York Review of Books, Nov. 22, 2012. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- And so he did.

Rather, they describe Russian power as ``a conglomerate of clans and groups that compete with one another over resources,'' with Putin acting as a powerful arbiter and moderator who has the last word.\\31\\ His power comes from his office, his relations with the elites, his high approval ratings among the public, as well as his control over much of the energy sector and major state-owned banks and, especially, the security services.\\32\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\31\\ Minchenko Consulting, Vladimir Putin's Big Government and the ``Politburo 2.0.'' \\32\\ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As Putin's power increased, so did that of the security services, which, according to independent journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan, Putin invited ``to take their place at the head table of power and prestige in Russia'' as he ``opened the door to many dozens of security service agents to move up in the main institutions of the country.'' \\33\\ Russia's security services are aggressive, well-funded by the state, and operate without any legislative oversight. They conduct not just espionage, but also ``active measures aimed at subverting and destabilizing European governments, operations in support of Russian economic interests, and attacks on political enemies.'' \\34\\ Some analysts assert that the security services are divided internally, compete in bureaucratic turf wars, and make intelligence products of questionable quality. Nonetheless, they are extremely active and, since returning to the presidency in 2012, Putin has ``unleashed increasingly powerful intelligence agencies in campaigns of domestic repression and external destabilization.'' \\35\\ Similar to his predecessors, Putin believes that he can best hold together Russia, with its variety of ethnicities and disparate regions, by using the security services to concentrate economic resources and political power.\\36\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\33\\ Andrei Soldatov & Irina Borogan, The New Nobility: The Restoration of Russia's Security State and the Enduring Legacy of the KGB, PublicAffairs, at 241 (2010). \\34\\ Mark Galeotti, ``Putin's Hydra: Inside Russia's Intelligence Services,'' European Council on Foreign Relations, at 1 (May 2016). \\35\\ Ibid. \\36\\ ``Take Care of Russia,'' The Economist, Oct. 22, 2016. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The most powerful of Russia's four main intelligence agencies is the FSB, which reports to Putin indirectly through the head of the Presidential Administration (the executive office of the president) and directly through informal channels built on long-standing relationships.\\37\\ The FSB's mindset is described as `'shaped by Soviet and Tsarist history: it is suspicious, inward looking, and clannish.'' \\38\\ While its predecessor, the KGB, was controlled by the Soviet Politburo, the FSB is a `'self-contained, closed system'' that is ``personally overseen by Putin.'' \\39\\ The FSB also controls the Investigative Committee, Russia's equivalent to the FBI, meaning that no prosecutor's office has independent oversight over it and the courts defer to it when making judgements. To monitor the private and public sector, all large Russian firms and institutions reportedly have FSB officers assigned to them, a practice carried over from the Soviet Union.\\40\\ According to scholars of the FSB, ``Putin's offer to the generation of security service veterans was a chance to move to the top echelons of power. Their reach now extends from television to university faculties, from banks to government ministries, but they are not always visible as men in epaulets . . . . Many officers, supposedly retired, were put in place as active agents in business, media, and the public sector while still subordinated to the FSB.'' \\41\\ And, according to Vladimir Kara-Murza, the twice-poisoned Russian opposition activist, the FSB ``doesn't just rule Russia, it owns it.'' \\42\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\37\\ Galeotti, ``Putin's Hydra: Inside Russia's Intelligence Services,'' at 12. \\38\\ Soldatov & Borogan, The New Nobility: The Restoration of Russia's Security State and the Enduring Legacy of the KGB, at 242. \\39\\ ``Wheels Within Wheels: How Mr. Putin Keeps the Country Under Control,'' The Economist, 22 Oct. 2016. \\40\\ Ibid. \\41\\ Andrei Soldatov & Irina Borogan, The New Nobility: The Restoration of Russia's Security State and the Enduring Legacy of the KGB, PublicAffairs, at 27, 28 (2010). \\42\\ Committee Staff Discussion with Vladimir Kara-Murza. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The security services have grown accustomed to operating with impunity inside Russia's borders. More alarmingly, over the past decade they have applied this mentality beyond Russia's borders with measurable success. They have been accused of assassinating Putin's political opponents abroad (see Appendix B), conspiring to cheat doping standards to win more Olympic medals (see Appendix C), and protecting cybercriminals who steal credit card and online account information from U.S. consumers (see Appendix D). THE KREMLIN'S PARANOID PATHOLOGY Despite the Kremlin's increasingly aggressive tactics beyond Russia's borders, the United States and its partners and allies should not conflate the Russian people with the Russian regime. The Russian people have the same hopes and aspirations as any other country's citizens: a government that is accountable to the people for providing safe streets and good jobs, schools, and hospitals. But they are ruled by a regime that has a very different set of priorities, focused primarily on the maintenance of Putin's power and wealth. Free, fair, and open elections are a threat to his grip on power and to the enormous wealth he has stolen from Russia's people. If Putin can demonstrate to the Russian people that elections everywhere are tainted and fraudulent, that liberal democracy is a dysfunctional and dying form of government, then their own system of `'sovereign democracy''--authoritarianism secured by corruption, apathy, and an iron fist--does not look so bad after all. As the National Intelligence Council put it, Putin's ``amalgam of authoritarianism, corruption, and nationalism represents an alternative to Western liberalism . . . [which] is synonymous with disorder and moral decay, and pro-democracy movements and electoral experiments are Western plots to weaken traditional bulwarks of order and the Russian state.'' \\43\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\43\\ National Intelligence Council, Global Trends: Paradox of Progress at 125 (Jan. 2017). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In dealing with Putin and his regime, the United States and its partners and allies should not assume that they are working with a government that is operating with the best interests of its country in mind. Rather, according to a former British ambassador to Moscow, Putin's ``overriding aim appears to be to retain power for himself and his associates. He has no perceptible exit strategy.'' \\44\\ Furthermore, Putin's regime and most of the Russian people view the history of the late 20th century and early 21st century in a starkly different light than most of the West does. The historical narrative popular in Russia paints this period as one of repeated attempts by the West to undermine and humiliate Russia. In reality, the perceived aggression of the United States and the West against Russia allows Putin to ignore his domestic failures and present himself as the leader of a wartime nation: a ``Fortress Russia.'' This narrative repeatedly flogs core themes like enemy encirclement, conspiracy, and struggle, and portrays the United States, NATO, and Europe as conspiring to encircle Russia and make it subservient to the West. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\44\\ Sir Roderic Lyne, Former British Ambassador to the Russian Federation, Memorandum to the UK Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee, Nov. 22, 2016. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As part of this supposed conspiracy, the EU goes after former Soviet lands like Ukraine, and Western spies use civil society groups to meddle in and interfere with Russian affairs.\\45\\ A good example of this narrative at work was Putin's remarks after terrorists attacked a school in Beslan, Russia, in 2004, killing hundreds, many of whom were children. Putin's response ignored the failure of his own security services, and pointed the finger outward, declaring ``we live in a time that follows the collapse of a vast and great state, a state that, unfortunately, proved unable to survive in a rapidly changing world . . . . Some would like to tear from us a `juicy piece of pie.' Others help them.'' \\46\\ Putin's reaction to that tragic event demonstrates the reasoning behind analysts' observations that he embodies a ``combustible combination of grievance and insecurity'' and that ``Russian belligerence is not a sign of resurgence, but of a chronic, debilitating weakness.'' \\47\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\45\\ Monitor 360, Master Narrative Country Report: Russia (Feb. 2012). \\46\\ Mikhail Zygar, All the Kremlin's Men, PublicAffairs, at 79 (2016). \\47\\ William Burns, ``How We Fool Ourselves on Russia,'' The New York Times, Jan. 7, 2017; ``The Threat from Russia,'' The Economist, Oct. 22, 2016. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Despite Russia's weakness, however, Putin's regime has developed a formidable set of tools to exert influence abroad. According to a study by The Jamestown Foundation, these tools include ``capturing important sectors of local economies, subverting vulnerable political systems, corrupting national leaders, penetrating key security institutions, undermining national and territorial unity, conducting propaganda offensives through a spectrum of media and social outlets, and deploying a host of other tools to weaken obstinate governments that resist Moscow.'' \\48\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\48\\ Janusz Bugajski & Margarita Assenova, Eurasian Disunion: Russia's Vulnerable Flanks, The Jamestown Foundation, at 6 (June 2016). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- On the foreign policy front, Vladimir Putin's fortunes improved in 2015. His military intervention in Syria reestablished Russia as a geopolitical player in the Middle East. In 2016, the UK voted to leave the European Union and the United States elected Donald Trump, who had warmly praised Putin's leadership. Pro-Russia candidates won elections in Bulgaria and Moldova. But as Western democracies woke up to the Kremlin's interference efforts to destabilize democratic processes and international institutions, the pendulum has begun to swing back in defense of democracy. Emmanuel Macron won a resounding victory in France's presidential elections last spring against a field of candidates with pro-Russian sympathies. In Germany, Putin's critic Angela Merkel won a plurality of votes in the September elections. And countries throughout Europe, increasingly vigilant, are dedicating increased resources and coordinating efforts to counter Russian malign influence. Nonetheless, the United States and Europe can and should expect Putin to continue to use all the tools at his disposal to assault democratic institutions and progress around the world, just as he has done so successfully inside Russia over nearly two decades. ---------- Chapter 2: Manipulation and Repression Inside Russia ---------- Many of the tactics that Vladimir Putin's Kremlin has deployed abroad to undermine democracy were first used domestically, and their brazenness and brutality have grown over time. To effectively understand and respond to the Russian government's malign influence operations around the world, then, requires starting at the Kremlin's own gates. Within Russia, Putin's regime has harassed and killed whistleblowers and human rights activists; crafted laws to hamstring democratic institutions; honed and amplified anti-Western propaganda; curbed media that deviate from a pro-government line; beefed up internal security agencies to surveil and harass human rights activists and journalists; directed judicial prosecutions and verdicts; cultivated the loyalties of oligarchs through corrupt handouts; and ordered violent crackdowns against protesters and purported enemies. This laundry list reflects not just governance tactics in the abstract, but tangible, regrettable impacts on lives and prosperity. Some cases in point: an estimated $24 billion dollars has been amassed by Putin's inner circle through the pilfering of state resources.\\49\\ At least 28 journalists have been killed for their reporting inside Russia since Putin took office in December 1999.\\50\\ The pro-Putin United Russia party's hold on seats in the Russian Duma grew to 76 percent in the 2016 elections, and the number of seats currently held by liberal opposition has been reduced to zero.\\51\\ This chapter illustrates in more detail the Kremlin's manipulation and repression within its own borders, later deployed or mimicked abroad, in three areas: ideological, political, and cultural influence; controlling the public narrative; and corrupting economic activity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\49\\ The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Putin and the Proxies, https://www.occrp.org/en/putinandtheproxies, Oct. 24, 2017. \\50\\ Committee to Protect Journalists, ``58 Journalists Killed in Russia/Motive Confirmed,'' https://cpj.org/killed/europe/russia (visited Dec. 5, 2017). \\51\\ Andrew Osborn & Maria Tsvetkova, ``Putin Firms Control With Big Win For Russia's Ruling Party,'' Reuters, Sept. 17, 2016. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In October 2014, Putin's then-first deputy chief of staff, Vyacheslav Volodin, famously quipped that ``there is no Russia today if there is no Putin.'' \\52\\ The statement encapsulated a consolidation of power in Russia over nearly 15 years into a ``highly centralized, authoritarian political system dominated by President Vladimir Putin.'' \\53\\ By equating Putin with the Russian state, Volodin's assertion--just months after Russia's invasion of Crimea that brought on international sanctions-- linked the fate of the Russian people with Putin's own. For Putin and his advisors, the move to co-opt the identity of an entire nation was no doubt fueled by his soaring popularity among Russians--from a `'slumping'' 61 percent prior to the Sochi Winter Olympics in February 2014 to above 80 percent in the months after.\\54\\ Yet Volodin's statement also marked a break from the Kremlin's attempts to maintain a semblance of democratic institutions and processes--it revealed that these institutions and processes, which became increasingly subordinated to the needs and interests of Putin's ruling clique, now existed only to prop it up. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\52\\ `` `No Putin, No Russia,' Says Kremlin Deputy Chief of Staff,'' The Moscow Times, Oct. 23, 2014. \\53\\ U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015: Russia, at 1. \\54\\ Michael Birnbaum, ``How to Understand Putin's Jaw-droppingly High Approval Ratings,'' The Washington Post, Mar. 6, 2016. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Volodin's predecessor as first deputy chief of staff, Vladislav Surkov, had been credited with developing a policy of `'sovereign democracy,'' an oxymoronic term explained by writer Masha Lipman as a ``Kremlin coinage that conveys two messages: first, that Russia's regime is democratic and, second, that this claim must be accepted, period. Any attempt at verification will be regarded as unfriendly and as meddling in Russia's domestic affairs.'' \\55\\ As described in a 2016 profile, Surkov maneuvered through a complex Russian political system to implement this vision, ``cultivating fake opposition parties and funding pro-Kremlin youth groups. He personally curated what was allowed on to Russia's television screens, and was seen as the architect of `post-truth politics' where facts are relative, a version of which some have suggested has now taken hold in the west.'' \\56\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\55\\ Masha Lipman, ``Putin's `Sovereign Democracy,' '' The Washington Post, July 15, 2006. \\56\\ Shaun Walker, ``Kremlin Puppet Master's Leaked Emails Are Price of Return to Political Frontline,'' The Guardian, Oct. 26, 2016. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Kremlin's concept of a `'sovereign democracy'' was intended to serve not just as a mechanism for domestic governance in Russia, but also as a model to other countries. The more that Russia's sovereign democratic model could appeal to and be replicated elsewhere as ``a style of government that corresponds with the needs and interests of the power elites,'' the more Russia would be able to extend its diplomatic reach and provide a counterpoint to the democratic principles that the United States has long championed.\\57\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\57\\ David Clark, ``Putin Is Exporting `Sovereign Democracy' To New EM Allies,'' The Financial Times, Dec. 20, 2016. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The trajectory of Russia's `'sovereign democracy'' experiment has unfolded along a spectrum ranging from deft manipulation to outright oppression of the media, civil society, elections, political parties, and cultural activities. All the while, the Kremlin's sustained and global effort to undermine human rights and the governments, alliances, and multilateral institutions that champion them has sought to reduce outside scrutiny of the anti-democratic abuses that are core to its `'sovereign democratic'' system. And similar to Putin's capitalizing on the 1999 apartment bombings to galvanize his own standing (see Chapter 1 and Appendix A), he has used other hardships befalling the Russian people as justification for tightening his grip on power. Such punctuating moments include the Kursk submarine disaster in 2000, which prefaced a crackdown on media critical of the government's response; the 2004 terrorist siege of a school in Beslan, after which Putin moved to replace a system of popularly-elected regional governors with centrally-appointed ones; and international sanctions resulting from the 2014 Russian military invasion of Ukraine, upon which Putin has amplified the narrative of Russia as a besieged fortress requiring his strong hand to defend.\\58\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\58\\ The Russian navy submarine Kursk sank in the Barents Sea on August 12, 2000 after multiple explosions onboard, resulting in the deaths of 118 Russian seamen. In the aftermath of the disaster, reports revealed that 23 crewmen had survived the initial explosion, but likely died several hours later in an escape compartment that filled with water, raising questions of whether the individuals could have been rescued in the interim. Government officials first claimed that the sinking was caused by a collision with a Western submarine, disputing assertions that faulty onboard equipment led to the disaster, and initially rejected foreign offers of assistance with the rescue effort. See ``What Really Happened to Russia's `Unsinkable' Sub,'' The Guardian, Aug. 4, 2001. In 2004, a group of Chechen rebels besieged a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, taking more than 1,000 individuals hostage, many of whom were children. Russian security services stormed the facility in an operation to end the standoff, during which approximately 330 individuals were killed. The European Court of Human Rights recently ruled in a complaint case brought by 409 Russian nationals that their government failed to prevent, and then overreacted in responding to, the attack, leading to inordinate loss of life. See European Court of Human Rights, ``Serious Failings in the Response of the Russian Authorities to the Beslan Attack,'' Apr. 13, 2017. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another key opportunity he seized was to bring a face- saving close to the conflict in Chechnya--a major element of the Putin founding narrative, as discussed in Chapter 1--by supporting strongman Ramzan Kadyrov's effort to stamp out rivals in Chechnya who were fueling the insurgency against Moscow and effectively establish his own fiefdom in the Chechen republic.\\59\\ Observers have noted that the brutal Kadyrov is ``essentially employed by Putin to stop Chechens from killing Russians, but he has also been linked to a long list of killings'' and human rights abuses in the North Caucasus region and elsewhere in the country.\\60\\ Moscow has provided subsidies to cover an estimated 81 percent of the Chechen Republic's budget.\\61\\ In exchange, Putin relies on Kadyrov and his security services to keep a lid on the Chechen conflict, deploys them as needed for hybrid operations in Ukraine and Syria, and uses the threat of terrorism in Chechnya as justification for restricting civic freedoms throughout the country.\\62\\ The outsized power Putin has afforded to internal security services (in both Moscow and Grozny) has proven useful to him, but has also placed the Kremlin atop a figurative tiger that it must ride in an inherently corrupt, brittle system fraught with risk. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\59\\ Ekaterina Sokirianskaia, ``Is Chechnya Taking Over Russia?''

And much like their Soviet predecessors, Putin's Kremlin has suppressed independent civil society and human rights activists through a variety of means, including legal restrictions and administrative burdens, the creation of government-sponsored civil society groups to counter independent organizations, and violent attacks. Russia's restrictive legal framework for civil society was designed and refined over many years. In December 2005, the Duma passed amendments that increased scrutiny and bureaucratic reporting requirements of NGO finances and operations, used vaguely defined provisions to prohibit foreign NGO programming, barred foreign nationals or those deemed ``undesirable'' from founding NGOs inside the country, and prohibited any NGO deemed a threat to Russian national interests.\\63\\ Surkov argued that the amendments were a needed defense against the specter of Western countries and organizations set on fomenting regime change in Russia. In 2012, after Putin's re-election to the presidency, the Kremlin shepherded through new legislation that further tightened the operating climate for NGOs: any group receiving foreign funding and engaged in political activities had to self-report as a ``foreign agent''--a Soviet-era term used to describe spies and traitors.\\64\\ Observers widely saw the foreign agent law as an attempt to stigmatize and deny funding to NGOs working on human rights and democracy.\\65\\ In May 2014, the law was amended to enable Russia's Justice Ministry to directly register groups as foreign agents without their consent, and authorities have since expanded the definition of ``political activities'' to include possible aspects of NGO work and fined or closed organizations for violations of the law.\\66\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\63\\ Katherin Machalek, ``Factsheet: Russia's NGO Laws'' in Contending With Putin's Russia: A Call for U.S. Leadership, at 10-13, Freedom House, Feb. 6, 2013; ``Russian Duma Passes Controversial NGO Bill,'' Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Dec. 23, 2005. \\64\\ Ibid.

Human Rights Watch reported in September 2017 that ``Russia's Justice Ministry has designated 158 groups as `foreign agents,' courts have levied staggering fines on many groups for failing to comply with the law, and about 30 groups have shut down rather than wear the `foreign agent' label.'' \\67\\ Other laws--relating to extremism, anti-terrorism, libel, and public gatherings--have also been selectively utilized by Russian officials to repress independent NGOs and human rights activists, among other targets. The hostile environment for domestic NGOs also fueled a blowback against foreign entities who sought to support them. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which for two decades had supported democracy and rule of law promotion in Russia, as well as health and education, announced in October 2012 that it would shut down its mission amidst pressure from the Kremlin.\\68\\ USAID was not alone: by December of that year, the International Republican Institute (IRI) announced it was closing its office on orders from the Russian government, and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) closed its office in Russia and moved its staff out of the country.\\69\\ In January 2015, the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation announced it was closing its Moscow office after the Duma asked the Justice Ministry to investigate whether a select group of organizations, including MacArthur as well as the U.S.-based Open Society Foundations (OSF) and Freedom House, should be declared ``undesirable'' and banned from the country.\\70\\ By June 2017, the Russian government had listed OSF, NDI, IRI, and eight other organizations as ``undesirable.'' \\71\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\67\\ Human Rights Watch, ``Russia: Government vs. Rights Groups,'' Sept. 8, 2017. \\68\\ Arshad Mohammed, ``USAID Mission In Russia To Close Following Moscow Decision,'' Reuters, Sept. 18, 2012. \\69\\ ``U.S. Pro-Democracy Groups Pulling Out Of Russia,'' Reuters, Dec. 14, 2012; National Democratic Institute, Russia: Overview, https:/ /www.ndi.org/eurasia/russia (visited Dec. 11, 2017). \\70\\ Alec Luhn, ``American Ngo to Withdraw From Russia After Being Put on `Patriotic Stop List,' '' The Guardian, Jul 22, 2015. \\71\\ The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, Civic Freedom Monitor: Russia, http://www.icnl.org/research/monitor/russia.html, (updated Sept. 8, 2017). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Legal and administrative tactics used during Putin's tenure to create headwinds against the work of independent civil society organizations have not only muted criticism of his own regime at home and abroad, but have afforded other governments a roadmap to similarly deflect criticism. Research by Human Rights First published in February 2016 cites at least fourteen countries where Russia has provided a ``bad example'' that may have inspired other governments to introduce or pass restrictive NGO laws; this includes countries like Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan traditionally viewed by Russia as within its geographic sphere of influence, as well as countries further afield such as Ethiopia, Cambodia, Egypt, and Ecuador.\\72\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\72\\ Melissa Hooper & Grigory Frolov, Russia's Bad Example, Free Russia Foundation, Human Rights First, Feb. 2016. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Kremlin has also sought to co-opt civil society by ``devot[ing] massive resources to the creation and activities of state-sponsored and state-controlled NGOs.'' \\73\\ Commonly referred to as ``GONGOs'' (Government Organized Non- Governmental Organizations), such groups are used to toe a government-friendly line or to promote alternative narratives to counter the work of legitimate Russian and international human rights NGOs. As one former U.S. ambassador to the OSCE described it, ``GONGOs are nothing more than the real-world equivalent of the Internet troll armies that insecure, authoritarian, repressive regimes have unleashed on Twitter. They use essentially the same tactics as their online counterparts--creating noise and confusion, flooding the space, using vulgarity, intimidating those with dissenting views, and crowding out legitimate voices.'' \\74\\ An expert from the National Endowment for Democracy has noted that ``Russia sinks extensive resources into GONGOs in countries on its periphery and beyond,'' where it can ``eagerly exploit'' the relatively free operating space for civil society to maximize their impact.\\75\\ He also notes that, similar to Russia, ``leading authoritarian governments have established a wide constellation of regime-friendly GONGOs, including think tanks and policy institutes, that operate at home and abroad.'' \\76\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\73\\ Statement of Michael McFaul, Senior Associate, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Russia: Rebuilding the Iron Curtain, Hearing before the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, May 17, 2007.

In 2005, after youth activists fueled protests in Ukraine that ultimately toppled the government, Surkov sought a buffer against such upheaval in Russia. Seizing on the anxieties of a nascent youth group in St. Petersburg, he helped develop it into the Nashi (``Ours'') youth organization and recruited participants, particularly from Russia's poorer regions, who could be readily mobilized as a counter-force to pro-democracy demonstrations.\\77\\ The group's first summit was held at a Kremlin-owned facility outside Moscow and included pro-Kremlin activists.\\78\\ Within months, Nashi held a rally in Moscow in which thousands of activists were bussed in to celebrate Russia's World War II victory over Germany.\\79\\ Nashi and its projects were funded by both the state and pro-Kremlin oligarchs and focused on pro- Putin gatherings and the political ``training'' of youth in summer camp-style gatherings, which included posters demeaning Kremlin critics and human rights activists as liars and Nazis.\\80\\ More recently, a ``military-patriotic movement'' of 11- to 18-year-olds known as Yunarmiya (``Youth Army'') has been promulgated in schools across Russia, a project of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu endorsed by Putin and enjoying sponsorship from four state-owned banks.\\81\\ Its ranks swelled from 100 members in 2016 to more than 30,000 a year later, and Yunarmiya was prominently featured in the Kremlin's annual World War II Victory Day parade in May 2017--just weeks after a large number of Russian youth turned out at opposition- organized anti-corruption protests around the country.\\82\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\77\\ Eva Hartog, ``A Kremlin Youth Movement Goes Rogue,'' The Moscow Times, Apr. 8, 2016. \\78\\ Mikhail Zygar, All the Kremlin's Men, PublicAffairs at 98 (2016). \\79\\ Ibid. at 99. \\80\\ Julia Ioffe, ``Russia's Nationalist Summer Camp,'' The New Yorker, Aug. 16, 2010; Eva Hartog, ``A Kremlin Youth Movement Goes Rogue,'' The Moscow Times, Apr. 8, 2016. \\81\\ Ilnur Sharafiyev, ``Making Real Men Out of Schoolchildren,'' Meduza, Oct. 6, 2017. \\82\\ Daniel Schearf, ``Putin's Youth Army Debuts on Red Square for `Victory Day,' '' Voice of America, May 8, 2017. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, the Kremlin has created a climate where physical attacks against civil society activists, as well as political opponents and independent journalists, occur regularly and often with impunity (see Appendix E). While such attacks are not exclusively part of the Russian `'sovereign democracy'' toolkit, the impunity with which they have been perpetrated in Russia has provided comforting company to other authoritarian governments who use similar tactics. Political Processes, Parties, and Opposition Russia's `'sovereign democracy'' relies on democratic structures, albeit largely hollow ones, to give a sheen of legitimacy to a regime that puts its own interests before those of its citizens. Under Putin's leadership, the Russian government has undermined political processes, parties, and opposition that present a meaningful check on the Kremlin's power.\\83\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\83\\ Statement of Michael McFaul, Senior Associate, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Russia: Rebuilding the Iron Curtain, Hearing before the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, May 17, 2007. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Putin and his allies have neutered political competition by creating rubber-stamp opposition parties and harassing legitimate opposition. For example, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the founder of the Russian oil company Yukos, was imprisoned for more than a decade on a spate of charges deemed to be politically motivated.\\84\\ His prosecution could be broadly interpreted as a signal to other powerful oligarchs that supporting independent or anti-Putin parties carries great risk to one's personal wealth and well-being. Genuine opposition party candidates have also been blocked from registering or participating in elections.\\85\\ At the same time, parties invented by the Kremlin to take away votes from the real opposition have received resources and support from the state and the private sector. Yet when these co-opted parties have asserted a degree of independence, they have had their leadership and resources gutted.\\86\\ More recently, opposition activists attempting to join forces through the Khodorkovsky- supported Open Russia platform have been blocked from using hotels and conference facilities to hold gatherings, and some have even had their homes raided.\\87\\ And the Kremlin appears set on quashing the 2018 electoral aspirations of anti- corruption activist and presidential hopeful Alexey Navalny, as the Central Election Commission declared him ineligible to run because of an embezzlement conviction, which international observers and his supporters allege was politically motivated.\\88\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\84\\ Tom Parfitt, ``Mikhail Khodorkovsky Sentenced to 14 years in Prison,'' The Guardian, Dec. 30, 2010; David M.

Early in his first term, he undermined the authority of elected regional governors by creating seven supra-regional districts, to which he appointed mainly former generals and KGB officers.\\89\\ By acquiring greater control over media resources, he achieved electoral victories for a growing swath of United Russia candidates and thereby reduced parliamentary autonomy.\\90\\ In 2004, Putin ``radically restructured'' the Russian political system by eliminating the election of regional governors by popular vote in favor of centrally- directed appointments, characterizing this significant power grab as an effort to forge ``national cohesion'' in the wake of the terrorist attack at a school in Beslan in North Ossetia.\\91\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\89\\ Statement of Michael McFaul, Senior Associate, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Russia: Rebuilding the Iron Curtain, Hearing before the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, May 17, 2007. \\90\\ Peter Baker, ``Putin Moves to Centralize Authority,'' The Washington Post, Sept. 14, 2004. \\91\\ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The erosion of democratic processes in Russia's elections has directly corresponded to Putin's efforts to secure a mandate and tighten his grip on power (see Appendix F for a summary of flawed elections in Russia since 1999). Around the most recent presidential election in 2012, in which Putin returned to power amidst credible allegations of fraud, tens of thousands of Russian citizens joined large-scale demonstrations in Moscow in late 2011 and early 2012, chanting ``Russia without Putin!''\\92\\ The Kremlin's response ranged from coalescing support to cracking down on criticism. Throngs of pro-government supporters were bussed in to participate in campaign rallies expressing support for Putin in a ``battle'' for Russia that painted any opposition as traitorous.\\93\\ Following the protests that tarnished Putin's inauguration, the government fast-tracked passage of a law that increased administrative penalties by a factor of one hundred for unsanctioned protests and other violations of the law on public assembly.\\94\\ Working through the Investigative Committee, a beefed-up internal security service that then-President Dmitry Medvedev established in 2011 and which reports directly to the president, the Kremlin carried out smear campaigns and discredited opposition figures through dubious charges and flawed legal proceedings.\\95\\ The backlash against political competition reached alarming levels in February 2015, when opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was murdered just steps from the Kremlin.\\96\\ Nemtsov was to participate two days later in a protest he organized against the Kremlin's economic mismanagement and interference in Ukraine. He was also planning to release a report on Russia's role in Ukraine.\\97\\ Observers alleged that the demonization in pro-government media of opposition figures as traitors had contributed to his death.\\98\\ In June 2017, a Russian court convicted five Chechen men of Nemtsov's killing. While the verdict was welcomed by the United States and other governments, Nemtsov's supporters charged that the masterminds behind the killing remained at large, and Nemtsov's family has called for Ramzan Kadyrov to be interrogated in the case.\\99\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\92\\ Ellen Barry & Michael Schwirtz, ``After Election, Putin Faces Challenges to Legitimacy,'' The New York Times, Mar. 5, 2012. \\93\\ Marc Bennetts, ``How Putin Tried and Failed To Crush Dissent in Russia,'' Newsweek, Feb. 26, 2016. \\94\\ U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012: Russia, at 24. \\95\\ Nastassia Astrasheuskaya & Steve Gutterman, ``Putin Foe Charged, Russian Opposition Fear KGB Tactics,'' Reuters, July 31, 2012. \\96\\ ``Russian Opposition Politician Boris Nemtsov Shot Dead,'' BBC, Feb. 28, 2015. \\97\\ Alec Lunh, ``Boris Nemtsov Report on Ukraine to be Released by Dead Politician's Allies,'' The Guardian, May 12, 2015. \\98\\ ``Russian Opposition: Critics or Traitors?''

In addition, presidential hopeful Alexey Navalny spearheaded several anti-corruption protests in cities across Russia in 2017. Using social media, Navalny's Anti- Corruption Fund has broadly circulated the results of its investigative work into alleged corruption by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and other high-ranking officials. At least 1,750 Russian citizens were detained after June 2017 anti- corruption protests, according to the Russian monitoring group OVD-Info.\\100\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\100\\ Marc Bennetts, ```There Are Better Things Than Turnips:' Navalny Plans Putin Birthday Protests,'' The Guardian, Oct. 5, 2017. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cultural Forces and Religious Institutions Under Putin, the Kremlin has engaged and boosted cultural forces and religious institutions inside Russia to provide an additional bulwark against the democratic values and actors it paints as anathema to the country's interests. One prominent example is the strong ties that Putin and his inner circle have forged with the Russian Orthodox Church and its affiliates.\\101\\ The Russian Orthodox Church enjoys special recognition under Russian law, while in contrast, laws such as the 2006 NGO laws and the 2016 ``Yarovaya'' package of counterterrorism laws have enabled pressure against non-Russian Orthodox religious entities through cumbersome registration processes and administrative constraints, restrictions on proselytizing, and expanded surveillance.\\102\\ Additionally, the U.S. State Department has reported that the Russian state has provided security and official vehicles to the Russian Orthodox patriarch (but not to other religious leaders) and noted reports that the Russian Orthodox Church has been a ``primary beneficiary'' of presidential grants ostensibly designed to reduce NGO dependence on foreign funding.\\103\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\101\\ See Chapter 4 for more information on the Russian Orthodox Church's role in promoting Kremlin objectives abroad. \\102\\ U.S. Department of State, International Religious Freedom Report for 2006, Russia; U.S. Department of State, International Religious Freedom Report for 2016: Russia, at 1. \\103\\ U.S. Department of State, International Religious Freedom Report for 2016: Russia, at 23-24; U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016: Russia, at 53 (citing report published in the Moscow Times. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In return for the state's favor, the Russian Orthodox Church has promoted Putin and the state's policies at multiple turns. A former editor of the official journal of the Moscow Patriarchate (the seat of the Russian Orthodox Church and its affiliated churches outside the country) told The New York Times in 2016 that ``The [Russian Orthodox] church has become an instrument of the Russian state. It is used to extend and legitimize the interests of the Kremlin.'' \\104\\ This is noteworthy given Putin's roots in the KGB--the tip of the Soviet spear in restricting religious activity during the Communist era--and it reflects a careful cultivation of his identity as a man of faith and a defender of the Orthodox faithful. The image of Putin as defender of traditional religious and cultural values has also been leveraged by the Kremlin ``as both an ideology and a source of influence abroad.'' \\105\\ In projecting itself as ``the natural ally of those who pine for a more secure, illiberal world free from the tradition-crushing rush of globalization, multiculturalism and women's and gay rights,'' the Russian government has been able to mobilize some Orthodox actors in places like Moldova and Montenegro to vigorously oppose integration with the West.\\106\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\104\\ Andrew Higgins, ``In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower,'' The New York Times, Sept. 13, 2016. \\105\\ Simon Shuster, ``Russia's President Putin Casts Himself as Protector of the Faith,'' TIME, Sept. 12, 2016. \\106\\ Andrew Higgins, ``In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower,'' The New York Times, Sept. 13, 2016. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Kremlin's cultivation of the Russian Orthodox Church intensified following the massive 2011-12 street protests opposing Putin's return to the presidency. Patriarch Kirill, who assumed leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church in 2009, endorsed Putin's long rule as a ``miracle of God'' on February 8, 2012, weeks before the presidential election. He praised Putin for ``correcting [the] crooked twist'' of Russia's tumultuous democratic transition in the 1990s, and derided Putin's opponents as materialistic and a threat to Russia.\\107\\ Eleven days later, members of the rock group Pussy Riot performed a protest song, ``Virgin Mary, Redeem Us of Putin'' in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior. In a high-profile and widely criticized prosecution, three Pussy Riot members were later sentenced to two years' imprisonment for ``hooliganism motivated by religious hatred.'' \\108\\ In a December 2012 speech, Putin invoked traditional and spiritual values as the antidote to Russian decline and criticized foreign influences, defining Russia's democracy as ``the power of the Russian people with their traditions'' and ``absolutely not the realization of standards imposed on us from outside.'' \\109\\ And in January 2013, Putin signed a law criminalizing ``insulting religious believers' feelings'' which enabled fines and prison time of up to three years.\\110\\ The Kremlin's fueling of culture wars has also provided context for the passage of laws criminalizing ``gay propaganda'' and decriminalizing first instances of domestic violence.\\111\\ The effects of these laws on the security of LGBT persons and women in Russia is discussed in more detail in Appendix G. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\107\\ Gleb Bryanski, ``Russian Patriarch Calls Putin Era `Miracle Of God,' '' Reuters, Feb. 8, 2012. \\108\\ U.S. Department of State, International Religious Freedom Report for 2012, Russia, at 9. \\109\\ Ellen Barry, ``Russia's History Should Guide Its Future, Putin Says,'' The New York Times, Dec. 12, 2012. \\110\\ Carl Schreck, ``Holy Slight: How Russia Prosecutes For `Insulting Religious Feelings,' '' Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Aug. 15, 2017. \\111\\ Lucian Kim, ``Russian President Signs Law to Decriminalize Domestic Violence,'' National Public Radio, Feb. 16, 2017. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONTROLLING THE PUBLIC NARRATIVE Media Capture Throughout Putin's tenure in Russia, the Kremlin has pressured independent media outlets to prevent them from being a meaningful check on his power. From the early days of Putin's first term, the U.S. State Department noted the threats to editorial independence posed by an increasing concentration of media ownership in Russia and news organizations' heavy reliance on financial sponsors or federal and local government support to operate.\\112\\ Print media required the services of state-owned printing and distribution companies, while broadcast media relied on the government for access to airwaves and accreditation to cover news. Kremlin favoritism, then, played heavily in determining which outlets survived. Conversely, media outlets that criticized President Putin or his actions risked retaliation.\\113\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\112\\ U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001, Russia. \\113\\ U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001, Russia. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A seminal moment in the Kremlin's efforts to capture the media in Russia came after the August 2000 Kursk submarine disaster that killed 118 Russian seamen. Questions swirled about how much the government knew about the accident and whether it had done enough to mitigate it.\\114\\ Putin, who had been vacationing in Sochi when the Kursk disaster unfolded and did not speak about it until days later, held a town hall with families of the dead, in which several relatives excoriated him for incompetence. Despite Kremlin efforts to limit media access to one Russian state broadcaster and to heavily edit the footage that was aired, international and Russian print media released details of the meeting and interviews with family members that cast Putin's young government in a harsh light.\\115\\ In a secretly taped record of the meeting by a journalist from Kommersant, a national Russian newspaper, Putin fumed that national television channels were lying about the Kursk events and accused them of destroying the Russian military through their corruption and efforts to discredit the government.\\116\\ The independent channel NTV, founded by oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky, had swiftly challenged the government's explanation of the Kursk tragedy and criticized its refusal of foreign assistance for the first five days following the initial explosion.\\117\\ (NTV had also aired a piece in 1999 asserting an FSB role in the failed apartment bombing in Ryazan, after which the Kremlin informed Gusinsky he had ``crossed the line.'' In 2000, Gusinsky was briefly jailed, exiled, and pressured to sell his stake in NTV to the state energy company Gazprom.) \\118\\ In October 2000, a critical one- hour TV special aired about the Kursk disaster on ORT, a public television channel partly owned by oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who had helped to execute the smooth transfer of power from Yeltsin to Putin a year earlier but subsequently fell out of favor with the Kremlin and announced his opposition.\\119\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\114\\ Michael Wines, `` `None of Us Can Get Out' Kursk Sailor Wrote,'' The New York Times, Oct. 27, 2000. \\115\\ Ian Traynor, ``Putin Faces Families' Fury,'' The Guardian, Aug. 22, 2000. \\116\\ Arkady Ostrovsky, The Invention of Russia: The Journey from Gorbachev's Freedom to Putin's War, Atlantic Books, at 277-78 (2015). \\117\\ See Jonathan Steele, ``Fury Over Putin's Secrets and Lies,'' The Guardian, Aug. 21, 2000. \\118\\ Robert Coalson, ``Ten Years Ago, Russia's Independent NTV, The Talk Of The Nation, Fell Silent,'' Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Apr. 14, 2011.
