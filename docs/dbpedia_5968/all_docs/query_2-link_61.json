        "text": "On March 4, 2012, Putin was elected to a third term as president of Russia, with an official count of 64 percent of the vote. International observers reported comparatively few flagrant electoral abuses, but the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe criticized the poll for the overwhelming government support that Putin enjoyed in relation to his competitors. Putin was inaugurated on May 7, 2012, and one of his first acts was to nominate Medvedev as prime minister; the appointment was confirmed by the Duma the following day.\n\nPutin’s first months in office were marked by attempts to quash or marginalize the protest movement and those entities that might lend it support. Under newly enacted laws, the organizers and participants of unauthorized demonstrations were subject to dramatically increased fines, and nongovernmental organizations that received funding from outside Russia were forced to declare themselves as “foreign agents.” While those measures were criticized by Western governments, the prosecution of the feminist punk collective Pussy Riot drew far wider condemnation. Three members of the band were arrested for an anti-Putin performance staged within the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow in February 2012. In August 2012 the trio was sentenced to two years in prison for “hooliganism.” Later that month Russia completed its accession to the World Trade Organization, but economists cautioned that many of the benefits of membership were dependent on structural reform within Russia’s economy and legal system.\n\nIn spite of U.S. Pres. Barack Obama’s much-publicized “reset” of relations with Moscow in 2009, tension between Russia and the West remained. The war of words escalated in December 2012 with the U.S. Congress’s passage of the so-called Magnitsky Act, a law that denied visas to and froze the assets of Russian officials suspected of involvement with human rights abuses. Putin responded by approving a measure that banned the adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens. Ties between Washington and Moscow were further strained in June 2013 when former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden fled to Moscow after revealing the existence of sweeping secret NSA intelligence-gathering programs. Despite repeated requests from the U.S. government, Putin refused to extradite Snowden, who had been charged with espionage by U.S. prosecutors. In July 2013 anticorruption blogger Aleksey Navalny, who had been a prominent figure in the protests of 2011–12, was sentenced to five years in prison for embezzlement. The verdict was criticized by the U.S. and the EU, and thousands of opposition supporters filled the streets of Moscow in protest. Navalny was unexpectedly released the following day, however, and in September 2013 he performed surprisingly well in Moscow’s mayoral election.\n\nPutin continued to assert Russia’s role on the global stage, and his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, brokered a deal that headed off potential Western military intervention in the Syrian Civil War. The agreement, made in the wake of a nerve gas attack on a civilian population outside Damascus, introduced UN inspectors and placed the chemical weapon stockpile of Syrian Pres. Bashar al-Assad under international control.\n\nAhead of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, and in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the post-Soviet constitution, some 25,000 people were freed from Russian prisons in December 2013. Among those freed were the imprisoned members of Pussy Riot and 30 Greenpeace activists who had been jailed in September 2013 for staging a protest at a Gazprom oil rig in the Pechora Sea. Days later Putin issued a pardon for Mikhail Khodorkovsky. After having spent more than a decade behind bars, the former oligarch promptly flew to Germany and vowed not to return to Russia as long as there existed the possibility that he might be arrested again.\n\nThe Ukraine crisis\n\nPutin also took an active role in the events in neighbouring Ukraine, where a protest movement toppled the government of pro-Russian Pres. Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. The protests began in November 2013 when Yanukovych scuttled a treaty that would have strengthened ties between Ukraine and the European Union. Instead, he sought to steer the country into the proposed Eurasian Economic Union with Russia. After a bloody crackdown in Kiev left scores dead and hundreds wounded, Yanukovych fled to Russia. The Putin administration, which did not recognize the acting government that had replaced Yanukovych, moved to capitalize on the situation. On February 28 armed men whose uniforms lacked visible insignia took control of key sites in the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea. Long the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, the Crimean Peninsula was home to a predominantly Russian population, and the movement of Russian troops into the region was not opposed.\n\nBy March 3 a pro-Russian prime minister had been installed at the head of the regional parliament, and Russia had achieved de facto military control of Crimea. On March 16 a referendum was held in Crimea, and 97 percent of voters stated a preference for leaving Ukraine and joining Russia. The U.S. and the EU responded by enacting sanctions against high-ranking officials in Russia and in the self-declared government of Crimea. On March 18 Putin and members of the Crimean parliament signed a treaty that transferred control of the peninsula to Russia. This treaty was ratified by the upper and lower houses of the Russian parliament and signed into law by Putin on March 21.\n\nIn early April 2014 heavily armed pro-Russian gunmen occupied government buildings throughout southeastern Ukraine and proclaimed the independence of the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. As in Crimea, the separatist groups in both regions held referenda on the matter, but the results had little practical effect. In public statements, Putin referred to the contested region as Novorossiya (“New Russia”), evoking claims from the imperial era, but denied that Russia was supporting the separatist movement. Despite early reversals, the Ukrainian army began reclaiming rebel-held territory as separatist groups fielded increasingly sophisticated heavy weapons, including tanks and air-defense systems. On July 17, 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, carrying 298 people, crashed in eastern Ukraine. Pro-Russian separatists were implicated in the shooting down of the aircraft, and the U.S. and EU dramatically expanded their sanctions against Russia, limiting Russian access to international capital markets and banning the export of defense and energy-sector technology. Russia, denying any connection to the rebels, retaliated with a wide-ranging ban on Western food imports.\n\nThroughout August 2014, journalists, Western intelligence agencies, NATO, and the Ukrainian government documented multiple instances of troops and matériel crossing into Ukraine from Russia. Although Russia continued to publicly deny any role in the conflict, Ukrainian military forces captured numerous Russian troops inside Ukraine. On August 28 Ukrainian Pres. Petro Poroshenko stated that Russian forces had entered Ukraine, and NATO estimated that at least 1,000 Russian troops were actively engaged in operations inside Ukraine. Putin responded by publicly declaring his support for the separatists but reiterated the claim that Russia was not a participant in the hostilities. On September 5 Putin and Poroshenko met in Minsk, Belarus, and agreed to a cease-fire plan that pledged to de-escalate the fighting and limit the use of heavy weapons in civilian areas. The agreement was soon violated by both sides, however, and, in spite of a drawdown of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, ample evidence remained of Russian intervention in the conflict.\n\nConsolidation of power, Syria, and campaign against the West\n\nOn the domestic front, Putin attempted to expand his already extensive control of the media. The Kremlin responded to the events in Ukraine by launching a widely successful propaganda campaign that used anti-Western rhetoric to stoke Russian patriotism. In August 2014, regulations entered into effect that required bloggers with more than 3,000 daily readers to register as media outlets. In addition, anonymous blogging was prohibited, and Internet service providers were required to maintain a record of user data that could be accessed by government authorities. Putin signed a bill in October 2014 that restricted foreign ownership of Russian media assets to 20 percent, drastically limiting outside access to the Russian market. In December anticorruption activist Aleksey Navalny received a three-and-a-half-year suspended sentence on fraud charges. His brother, Oleg, was imprisoned for three and a half years for the same offense. The prosecutions were widely seen as politically motivated.\n\nWestern sanctions and plunging oil prices combined to send the Russian economy into recession in early 2015. In an attempt to shore up a plummeting ruble in December 2014, the Russian central bank spent billions of dollars from its foreign currency reserves and hiked its key interest rate to 17 percent. Those efforts stemmed the immediate effects of Russia’s worst currency crisis since 1998, but they did little to restore foreign investor confidence. The ratings agency Standard and Poor’s downgraded the ruble to “junk” status, and capital flight contributed to an already dire situation, with Russian officials projecting that GDP would contract 3 percent in 2015.\n\nOn February 27, 2015, Boris Nemtsov, an opposition leader who had spoken out against the Russian military campaign in Ukraine, was assassinated near the Kremlin. Nemtsov was just one of a growing number of Putin critics to be silenced, either by foul play or by imprisonment. Russian activities in Ukraine continued as part of a wider effort to assert military influence in the “near abroad”—the countries of the former Soviet Union—and elsewhere. In September 2015 Russia entered the Syrian Civil War in support of Syrian Pres. Bashar al-Assad, a move that helped preserve a regime that was on the verge of collapse. With its conventional military capability on display in Syria, Russia’s rapidly developing cyberwarfare capacity was demonstrated in Ukraine. A cyberattack that was attributed to Russian security services left hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians without electricity in December 2015. The incident marked the first time that a power grid had been taken offline by a hacking attack, and an even more sophisticated attack plunged Kiev into darkness almost exactly one year later.\n\nAs Russia’s air campaign in Syria entered its second year, the Assad government regained momentum against the opposition and Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces. Russian fighter jets routinely violated NATO airspace in the Baltic in 2016, and nuclear-capable missile systems were deployed to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. In the months prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a series of high-profile hacking attacks targeted the Democratic Party and its presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Thousands of private e-mails were subsequently published by the Web site WikiLeaks, and U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies implicated Russian state security services in the cyberattacks. After the victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump in November 2016, a series of investigations were launched by the U.S. to determine if there had been collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.\n\nAlthough the Russian economy continued to struggle, Putin remained broadly popular with the Russian public. Low oil prices hurt exports, and imports were hamstrung by Western sanctions and a ruble that had fallen sharply against the dollar. Putin’s enduring appeal seemed to derive in no small part from his propagation of the image of an ascendant Russia bedeviled by a jealous West. When the entire Russian track and field team was banned from the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Putin decried the politicization of sport—despite the fact that investigators had uncovered a massive Russian state-sponsored doping program. The International Olympic Committee subsequently issued the harshest penalty in the history of the modern Olympic movement when it banned the entire Russian team from the 2018 Winter Games in P’yŏngch’ang (Pyeongchang), South Korea. In December 2017 Putin declared his intention to seek reelection for a fourth term as president.\n\nPutin’s fourth term as president, novichok attacks, and military action against Ukraine\n\nTwo weeks before the March 2018 presidential election, Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy who had acted as a double agent for Britain, was found unconscious with his daughter in Salisbury, England. Investigators alleged that the pair had been exposed to a “novichok”—a complex nerve agent developed by the Soviets—by two Russian military intelligence operatives. British Prime Minister Theresa May responded by expelling nearly two dozen Russian intelligence officers who had been working in Britain under diplomatic cover. Although the Skripals eventually recovered, a British woman died in July 2018 after handling a perfume bottle, presumably used in the Salisbury attack, that contained novichok.\n\n(Read Britannica’s list of citizens detained by foreign governments.)\n\nThe fallout from the Skripal poisoning had not abated when Russian voters went to the polls on March 18, 2018. It was hardly a coincidence that the date chosen for the election was the fourth anniversary of Russia’s forcible annexation of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea, an event that triggered a significant uptick in Putin’s domestic popularity. As expected, Putin claimed an overwhelming majority of the vote in an election that was characterized as being rife with irregularities by independent monitoring agency Golos. Ballot stuffing was observed in numerous locations, and opposition leader Aleksey Navalny was barred from running, but Putin’s campaign characterized the result as an “incredible victory.”\n\nAlthough Russia’s global presence had been greatly reduced, Putin’s personal stature was undiminished. With Britain struggling to conclude an exit deal with the European Union, German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the twilight of her tenure as de facto leader of Europe, and governments in Poland and Hungary exhibiting increasingly authoritarian tendencies, Putin faced a West that seemed unable to find its footing. In addition, Putin had fostered a relationship with Trump that saw the American president praise his Russian counterpart while criticizing NATO as obsolete and rejecting the conclusions of his own intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn January 2020 Putin announced his intention to modify the Russian constitution and remove term limits for presidents, paving the way for him to remain in office indefinitely. Medvedev promptly announced his resignation, stating that a new government would give Putin “the opportunity to make the decisions he needs to make.” The Russian legislature quickly approved the changes, but Putin scheduled a national referendum on the matter. That vote was originally scheduled for April, but it was postponed until July due to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Unsurprisingly, the result was an overwhelming affirmation of Putin’s agenda.\n\nOn August 20, 2020, Navalny became seriously ill on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk, and tests confirmed that he had been exposed to a novichok. Navalny was flown to Germany to recover, and the following month opposition candidates performed surprisingly well in local elections held in the area where Navalny had been campaigning. The Kremlin denied involvement in the poisoning, but such protestations had become increasingly implausible, as the attack on Navalny represented only the most recent in a long series of attempts on the lives of Putin’s critics. When Navalny returned to Moscow in January 2021, he was promptly arrested.\n\nRussia was hit especially hard by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and, by the end of 2021, more than 650,000 Russians had been killed by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. While the pandemic had dominated global headlines over the previous two years, 2022 began with a sports-related controversy with the United States and, more significantly, the prospect of a major war in Europe. On February 17, American basketball player Brittney Griner was detained in Russia on a drug offense. She was put on trial, found guilty, and sentenced to nine years in a penal colony. She was eventually released back to the United States in a prisoner exchange for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer serving a 25-year sentence in a U.S. federal prison. The year 2022 also began with Putin’s massive buildup of Russian forces along the Ukrainian border. Putin defended the forward deployment of tens of thousands of troops as mere exercises, but Western governments characterized the moves as a precursor to an invasion of Ukraine. By February 2022 there were as many as 190,000 Russian troops along the Russo-Ukrainian border, in Belarus, in Russian-occupied Crimea, and in the Russian-backed separatist enclave of Transdniestria in Moldova. On February 21 Putin recognized the independence of the self-proclaimed people’s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and ordered Russian “peacekeepers” into Ukrainian territory. Russia had been supporting the separatist movements in these Ukrainian territories since 2014, but these steps marked a dramatic escalation. Western leaders announced a new wave of sanctions, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz suspended certification of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. On the morning of February 24 Putin delivered a televised address announcing the beginning of a “special military operation,” and within minutes Russian air strikes were carried out against cities across Ukraine, beginning the Russia-Ukraine war. Putin’s unprovoked attack was condemned by leaders around the world, and many vowed that even harsher sanctions were to come.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
