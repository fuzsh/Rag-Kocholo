        "text": "Citation preview\n\nFor my wife, Sofia\n\nKINO: THE RUSSIAN CINEMA SERIES General Editor’s Preface\n\nC\n\ninema has been the predominant art form of the first half of the twentieth century, at least in Europe and North America. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the former Soviet Union, where Lenin’s remark that ‘of all the arts, cinema is the most important’ became a cliché and where cinema attendances were until recently still among the highest in the world. In the age of mass politics Soviet cinema developed from a fragile but effective tool to gain support among the overwhelmingly illiterate peasant masses in the civil war that followed the October 1917 Revolution, through a welter of experimentation, into a mass weapon of propaganda through the entertainment that shaped the public image of the Soviet Union – both at home and abroad for both elite and mass audiences – and latterly into an instrument to expose the weaknesses of the past and present in the twin process of glasnost and perestroika. Now the national cinemas of the successor republics to the old USSR are encountering the same bewildering array of problems, from the trivial to the terminal, as are all the other ex-Soviet institutions. Cinema’s central position in Russian and Soviet cultural history and its unique combination of mass medium, art form and entertainment industry, have made it a continuing battlefield for conflicts of broader ideological and artistic significance, not only for Russia and the Soviet Union, but also for the world outside. The debates that raged in the 1920s about the relative merits of documentary as opposed to fiction film, of cinema as opposed to theatre or painting, or of the proper role of cinema in the forging of post-Revolutionary Soviet culture and the shaping of the new Soviet man, have their echoes in current discussions about the role of cinema vis-à-vis other art forms in effecting the cultural\n\nand psychological revolution in human consciousness necessitated by the processes of economic and political transformation of the former Soviet Union into modern democratic and industrial societies and states governed by the rule of law. Cinema’s central position has also made it a vital instrument for scrutinising the blank pages of Russian and Soviet history and enabling the present generation to come to terms with its own past. This series of books intends to examine Russian, Soviet and ex-Soviet films in the context of Russian, Soviet and ex-Soviet cinemas, and Russian, Soviet and ex-Soviet cinemas in the context of the political history of Russia, the Soviet Union, the post-Soviet ‘space’ and the world at large. Within that framework the series, drawing its authors from both East and West, aims to cover a wide variety of topics and to employ a broad range of methodological approaches and presentational formats. Inevitably this will involve ploughing once again over old ground in order to re-examine received opinions, but it principally means increasing the breadth and depth of our knowledge, finding new answers to old questions and, above all, raising new questions for further enquiry and new areas for further research. The continuing aim of this series is to situate Russian, Soviet and exSoviet cinema in its proper historical and aesthetic context, both as a major cultural force and as a crucible for experimentation that is of central significance to the development of world cinema culture. Books in the series strive to combine the best of scholarship, past, present and future, with a style of writing that is accessible to a broad readership, whether that readership’s primary interest lies in cinema or in political history.

I have opted for a dual system: in the text I have used the Library of Congress system (without diacritics), but we have broken away from this system (a) when a Russian name has a clear English version (e.g. Maria instead of Mariia, Alexander instead of Aleksandr); (b) when a Russian name has an accepted English spelling, or when Russian names are of Germanic origin (e.g. Meyerhold instead of Meierkhol’d; Eisenstein instead of Eizenshtein); (c) when a Russian name ends in –ii or –yi, this is replaced by a single –y (e.g. Dostoevsky) for a surname and a single –i for a first name (e.g. Grigori, Sergei). In addition, in order to aid pronunciation I have chosen Fyodor instead of Fedor, Semyon instead of Semen, Yakov instead of Iakov, Yuli instead of Iuli and Yevgeni instead of Evgenii. I also use the more familiar Politburo instead of Politbiuro and Orgburo instead of Orgbiuro. In the scholarly apparatus I have adhered to the Library of Congress system (with diacritics) for the specialist.\n\nINTRODUCTION Existing Research, Aims, Objectives and Methodology\n\nT\n\nhe basic shape of the established Western approach to Soviet cinema, which emerged in the 1930s, and still exists in a traditional, ‘totalitarian’ form of analysis, suggests that, under Stalinism, the Soviet film industry was brought under the firm grip of an allembracing, centralised state and administrative system. This system crushed the creative spirit of the 1920s and obliged film-makers to become complicit in the creation of pro-regime film propaganda and the imposition of an artistically weak socialist realist approach.1 Such accounts were challenged by ‘revisionists’ who emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. Richard Taylor began looking at Soviet cinema in the 1920s from a political point of view, contending that the Party only began to gain control of the medium at the end of the decade.2 Taylor soon turned to the 1930s, arguing against the traditional film history interpretation of the decline into socialist realism. He contended that, while the aim of creating a ‘cinema for the millions’ was subject to complex political and economic constraints, the film industry and in particular its leader, Boris Shumiatsky, managed to lay the foundations of a genuine mass form of politicised entertainment by the late 1930s.3 Taylor and Ian Christie have also provided researchers with invaluable resources on Soviet cinema in the 1920s and 1930s, through the translation and publication of newspaper/journal articles and other documents, in the collection The Film Factory.4 Taylor later co-edited a very important contribution to understanding the cinema of the Stalin era and its legacy, Stalinism and Soviet Cinema, featuring a range of articles from scholars of different disciplinary backgrounds, including academics from the former Soviet Union. The collection dealt with\n\n2\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nthe origins, development and legacy of Stalinism in cinema and offered contributions from both the ‘totalitarian’ and ‘revisionist’ schools of thought.5 Denise Youngblood has also challenged received historical ideas about cinema, but from the broader perspective of revisionist Soviet history. In her Soviet Cinema in the Silent Era, Youngblood argued that Stalinism constituted a revolution from below in cinema, but later amended this theory, arguing that there was no mass support for the changes. Instead a ‘revolution from the middle’ was said to have taken place within the film industry itself.6 The approaches of Western revisionists stood in stark contrast to the work of their Soviet counterparts. In the USSR academics, at least formally, saw the Party as the careful guiding hand for the film industry, ensuring that it moved in the correct political direction. For example, Alentina Rubailo examined the process of growing Party control during 1928–37, contending that the Bolsheviks gradually increased their influence in terms of administration, planning and the ideological side of film production. Given that the book was written in the Brezhnev era, it is unsurprising that the author presented a wholly positive account of Party influence and the politicisation of the film industry. Since the collapse of the Soviet system, study of the 1930s has ironically adopted the traditional, ‘totalitarian’ arguments of the West, concentrating on the supposedly overwhelming influence of Stalin, comparing Soviet films of the 1930s with those of Nazi Germany, and focusing on the negative aspects of the cinema industry. Nonetheless, Russian scholars have recently published a wealth of archival materials which promise the emergence of more nuanced accounts of the interaction between politics and cinema in the 1930s.7 Interest in the 1930s has grown and moved in new directions over recent years. The French scholar Natacha Laurent has dedicated an entire book, based on archival sources, to censorship during the Stalinist era (although the particular focus is on the 1940s). Laurent pays special attention to aspects of the decision-making process, providing us with a better understanding of the mechanics of censorship. Among other arguments, she points out that censorship was not only imposed from above, but also involved the film-makers themselves who formed part of a complex web.8 Eberhard Nembach provides a useful narrative on the reorganisation of the film industry in the 1930s which favours the bridging of historical divides and provides some new factual information also based on archival research.9 Other recent work has tackled new areas, such as\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\ngender and masculinity and the importance of time and space in the films of this era. Yevgeni Dobrenko has devoted a book to the exploration of how Stalinist cinema produced history (as opposed to this work which looks at the history of the film industry itself) with film playing the role of a museum that artificially manipulated the past to legitimise the Soviet present. This new work has emerged in a context of increasing interest in the broad domain of Russian and Soviet cinema from academics working in a whole range of disciplinary areas. Such interest is exemplified by the creation of a new journal, Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema.10 On the one hand, the current work acknowledges the importance and validity of elements of historical interpretations that lean toward traditional or ‘totalitarian’ approaches. It will be argued throughout that centralised and administrative political control had a fundamental impact on Soviet cinema during the 1930s. Excessive bureaucracy played a large role in undermining the film industry and minimising the potential impact of the envisaged ‘cinema for the millions’. Moreover, political violence had a significant impact on cinema especially during the late 1930s. At the same time, however, the analysis argues against certain aspects of the traditional view, especially those that regard Stalin as wielding complete control over the industry and the suggestion that any creativity was completely wiped out during this period. This book also endorses aspects of revisionist accounts. In addition to the fact that cinema was subjected to extreme centralisation and bureaucracy, the film industry was also characterised by organisational chaos and inefficiency. But while these arguments are important to this book, the aim here is to develop a fresh approach to Soviet cinema in the 1930s. If we want to understand why Soviet cinema adopted certain political, economic and organisational forms and why the aims set out for the film industry led to particular outcomes, we must begin by examining the ways of thinking that underpinned its development. This work not only differs methodologically from previous interpretations of cinema in the 1930s, but it also deals with a broader political subject matter than has traditionally been the case. Areas that have received the particular attention of scholars, such as Peter Kenez, Taylor and Youngblood, include government and Party policy, cinema administration and administrators, censorship, the relationship between politics and socialist realism, questions of genre, the role of popular cinema and close examinations of directors, individual films or groups of films. This book also deals with some of these matters, but aims to use the\n\n4\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\naforementioned method to gain a new perspective. So, for example, the analysis agrees, to some extent, with Kenez’s view that censorship had a profound impact on film production, but the intention here is to establish why censorship increased in the 1930s and why certain decisions on films or potential films were made. It is a certain mentality that lies behind the elaborate control mechanisms and it is essential that we understand these modes of thought if we are to comprehend what happened to Soviet cinema in the 1930s. Certain aspects of cinema have received some attention for the period covering the 1930s, but not as much as the 1920s. This is particularly relevant to the economic facets of Soviet cinema.11 I will address this and try to develop a closer examination of the central role of the industry and its infrastructure in reaching the people. I will also address the area of film education and training which has received negligible treatment despite its fundamental importance.12 Political violence was also of great significance in determining the future direction of the industry in the late 1930s. Again, this is an area which has been discussed, but requires further exploration.13 Other areas have been almost completely neglected by film historians, namely thematic planning, one of the key driving (or hindering) forces behind Soviet cinema during these years. The establishment of the first cinema trade union is also important for a better understanding of how representation of varying interests changed in the 1930s and how film-makers and other workers interacted with the authorities and the cinema administration. Although this work seeks to explore new territory, it is not all encompassing. For instance, the author has decided to focus mainly on the feature film aspects of Soviet cinema as documentary filmmaking in this period deserves more comprehensive treatment than this book could allow. If we are to apply the aforementioned method successfully, we must also understand the way in which the Bolsheviks attempted to justify and legitimise the basis of their power and see how their defensive ways of thinking, to a large extent, arose from the application of (an already demanding) Marxist theory to an impoverished Russia. Particular Bolshevik attitudes and ways of thinking were crucial in both shaping the Soviet system and almost every aspect of film industry development from the late 1920s onwards. The historical methodology of examining the mentalities of human beings has long-established foundations. It is usually associated with the French Annales school of historiography who established the approach through a series of studies which examined the attitudes\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nand values of various social groups over the long term, but with a particular interest in medieval themes.14 Moreover, a concern with distinctive mentalities has also long preoccupied scholars of Russian and Soviet history. This methodology has proven especially fruitful when examining the psychological world of individual Bolsheviks, such as Stalin, and has helped us to understand why they acted in the ways that they did.15 It has also been applied to collective mentalities manifested during the Revolutionary events of 1917, as well as in longer-term overviews of Russian history.16 Bolshevik Defensive Thinking The attempt here to understand the Bolshevik way of thinking, and its impact on Soviet cinema in particular, will involve a slightly different methodological approach than those normally applied to deciphering attitudes and values in human history. The focus will be on the domain of politics as opposed to the sphere of social history often examined in the area of mentalities. The main subjects of this work are Bolshevik politicians, administrators, film-makers and cinema industry personnel in general. The aim is to show how the Bolsheviks tried to create a cinema that would serve their goals rather than to examine the reception of film among the masses or its role in their everyday lives. Thus the focus will be on the view of political history and cinema ‘from above’, as well as ‘the middle’, as Denise Youngblood describes it. The analysis does not seek to claim that there was only one mode of thought in Soviet society, rather, it tries to discover how a dominant mindset had such a huge impact on the film industry and its day-to-day functioning. The Annales historians have generally argued that attitudes have to be analysed over a long period of time as changes do not take place instantaneously.17 The argument presented here does not deny this point, but suggests that the Bolshevik defensive way of thinking, while having its roots in pre-Revolutionary attitudes, had its own distinctive Bolshevik stamp. One of the central methods employed by the Annales school has been the use of figures and statistics as both a means of revealing changes in mentalities, as well as proving the scientific credentials of the historiographical enterprise by suggesting that it has the same claims of accuracy and objectivity as the social sciences. For example, this might involve trying to prove the decline of the Spanish Empire in the seventeenth century by carefully quantifying imports and exports of money and goods and the balance of trading relations with the New World. The\n\n6\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nanalysis adopted here does not use numerical methods as a means to confirm its argument, but it does adopt the concepts of ‘structure’ and ‘agency’ from the world of political science as a means of trying to establish how dominant patterns of Bolshevik thinking emerged. This approach is the first step in the methodology of this work. Whenever we attempt to understand political, social or economic developments, either historical or contemporary, we try to establish the connection between agency (individuals or groups of individuals) and the structures in which they find themselves. In the twentieth century, academics working in social sciences and humanities have adopted differing views over where the emphasis should lie in this debate. Structuralism emphasises the importance of structure, arguing that observable political, social or economic events, processes and outcomes are merely the product of unobservable political, social or economic structures, of which ‘actors are merely bearers’. An alternative, but equally simplistic view, can be found in the arguments of intentionalism which suggest that structures are the outcome of human agents (often, but not always individual) acting on rational, strategic intentions that are usually unfettered by any structural constraints. Over the past two decades, there have been various attempts to overcome the artificial separation of structure and agency in order to develop more sophisticated explanations of how humans have interacted with their world. Among the most effective of these has been critical realism. Critical realism contends that human agency must always be understood as a close interaction with existing and pre-constituted structures as these structures either constrain or enable individual or collective agents by the choices and strategies which they define. Human agents can, to some extent, transform structures through intentional acts which might have either intended or unintended consequences. Moreover, by combining their incomplete knowledge of existing structures with strategic learning, achieved by observing the consequences of their actions, agents are able to develop new strategies for future action.18 If we apply this basic conceptualisation to the historical agency of the Bolsheviks and the distinctive structures which defined the courses of action available to them, then we are able to see why their future approach to the cinema industry (and every other aspect of Soviet life) revealed less of a flexible strategic learning and more of an almost unchanging way of thinking. A particular defensiveness evolved which, to a large extent, reflected the gap between what the Bolsheviks wanted to achieve and what the structural realities allowed them to achieve.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nBefore we can establish a proper understanding of the relationship between Bolshevik measures and Russian structural realities, we must first look at the origins of their ideas, which can be traced back to Karl Marx. In order to understand the Bolsheviks’ attempts to frame Russian reality within the terms of Marx’s thinking we must briefly examine his fundamental ideas and the efforts to apply them to specifically Russian circumstances. Despite the debates on the scientific status of Marx’s theoretical framework, his thought was fundamentally moral. Marx thought that human beings had the potential to be creative, free individuals, to realise themselves as fully as possible. Such emancipation had not been achieved mainly due to scarcity and the inevitable struggle for resources that were related to primitive levels of material productivity. The advent of capitalism and its mechanisation of labour showed that the masses could potentially become free of compulsive labour. Yet this could only be achieved if humanity could destroy the class system on which capitalism thrived. For Marx the central characteristics of capitalist society were class division and class exploitation, reinforced by a state that enabled the ruling class to maintain the exploitative status quo, through coercion if necessary. He believed that this intolerable situation would eventually culminate in a social revolution, leading to the end of capitalism and the emancipation of humanity. Following the revolution the proletariat would seize and maintain political control in a transitional period whereby a socialist society would gradually replace its capitalist predecessor. The transitional period consisted of the replacement of ‘bourgeois’ class dictatorship with proletarian class dictatorship, justified by the fact that the working class constituted the large majority of the population. The transitional, proletarian class-controlled, socialist state would oversee the dismantling of the legal and institutional basis of capitalism, foster the development of the economic and productive powers of the state and protect the revolution from political enemies.19 In short, it would lay the basis for the future communist society. Marx assumed that the working class would be the agency, not only for the transitional period of social change, but also for the eventual emancipation of humanity as a whole from capitalism and its class system. The ultimate goal of communism consisted of a classless society of individuals freed from exploitation, drudgery and able to realise their creative capacities in a context free from ‘bourgeois’ institutions. This would largely be made possible by abundance and the final elimination of scarcity. The Bolsheviks adopted Marx’s basic theory\n\n8\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nas one of the key foundations of Party legitimacy. They claimed that he had uncovered the objective laws of human development through which all societies must pass, yet, despite their allegedly inevitable character, the Bolsheviks argued that such laws had to be partly helped along by political activism and this was particularly necessary in the Russian context. It is well known that Marx’s predictions failed to materialise in the West as he expected. When the Revolution took place in Russia, it was in a country where capitalism was still in its early stages and the state was dominated by a huge peasantry engaged in primitive agrarian forms of production, while a relatively small working class existed in the urban centres. Indeed, the pre-existing structures within which the Bolsheviks would attempt to realise Marx’s vision certainly enabled the Bolsheviks to seize power. They managed, at least for a very brief period, to appeal to workers and peasants with promises to transform lives, end exploitation and expropriate land from the wealthy. In this way the Bolsheviks presented themselves as a saviour to all. Yet, economic backwardness would also prove to be an enormous constraint in the drive to implement Bolshevik policies. Lenin, who was acutely aware that Marx’s schema did not correspond to Russia, adapted to the country’s particular circumstances. In accordance with his belief that the working class did not have the knowledge and understanding to lead a social revolution, he argued that they would have to be led by a so-called vanguard. This vanguard consisted of the Communist Party, an elite organisation of class-conscious, professional revolutionaries who would lead the way from capitalism towards a classless society. However, in Russia the highly productive material basis to be created by advanced capitalism was absent. As Marx had contended, this well-developed material base was an essential prerequisite for a successful transition to a communist society where scarcity would be eliminated. Thus from the very beginning, the Bolsheviks were faced with the need to reconcile the gap between the need for a sophisticated material base and their claim that the new Soviet state had entered the transitional period referred to by Marx.20 In truth the USSR began as a dictatorship of communist elites that would have to oversee full industrialisation and the drive for productive powers, before it could claim to have even reached the transitional period of socialism. So from 1917 onwards, the Bolsheviks were presented with a huge problem and it was essentially a problem of political legitimacy. In the first place, the revolutionaries claimed to embody an ideology that sought to free the masses from the inhuman exploitation of capitalism. Yet, with\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nregard to its pre-existing economic and social structures, Russia was an undeveloped country and the arduous process of full industrialisation still lay ahead. The historical record had shown that the transformation of societies from predominantly agrarian economies into industrial giants usually involved hard toil, poor living standards and a significant level of exploitation. It seemed evident that Russia would struggle to avoid such difficulties and when industrialisation did take place under Stalin, it proved to be far more brutal than anyone could have imagined. So, from the very beginning, the Bolshevik claim that Party authority, to some extent, emanated from the inevitable developmental march of history was shown to be an unfounded and illegitimate argument. The Party tried to cover this glaring lack of theoretical legitimacy by still claiming that the USSR was in a transitional period, which it rather euphemistically described as ‘socialist construction’. The Bolsheviks also suffered from a further political legitimacy deficit. Marx had never adequately described the nature of worker control during the socialist transition period, but the implication was that it would involve the participation of the working masses in some form. Although Lenin argued for a vanguard party, he recognised that this must be temporary and that a truly socialist system had to provide democratic mass participation if society was to be successfully transformed. Such a view was enunciated in his State and Revolution (Gosudarstvo i revoliutsiia, 1917) where he supported mass participation in the administration of socialism and the abolition of the parliamentary system in favour of the true democracy of the commune. He believed that such developments would lead to the gradual withering away of the state. The post-Revolutionary reality was quite different. When the Bolsheviks were soundly defeated in the constituent assembly elections, it was clear that they did not have the popular backing they wanted. Their reaction was the closure of the assembly, the banning of rival parties and the establishment of repressive police control. From this point on, the masses, in whose name the Bolsheviks claimed to rule, would have no say in the running of the Soviet state. This was problematic, as the Bolsheviks’ other source of legitimacy came from the people and, in particular, the working class. As soon as it was clear that the Bolsheviks did not have popular support, they tended to lean on the role of the elite vanguard party and, more importantly, Marxist-Leninist doctrine, which would always be the ultimate area of Party legitimacy. Internal structural constraints were compounded by the regime’s uneasy relationship with the rest of the world. Marx’s vision of proletarian\n\n10\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nrevolution was a worldwide vision and, for a short period, the Bolsheviks held out some hope that revolutions might break out in other European countries. When this did not happen the USSR was isolated. Indeed, not only did the Western powers attempt to prevent the Bolsheviks from winning the civil war, there was also a reluctance to recognise the legitimacy of the Soviet Union as a geo-political entity for several years. Russia traditionally had a difficult relationship with the West. Rulers, such as Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, had tried to emphasise the need for European modernisation, while Slavophiles argued about the unique nature of Russia which they believed should follow its own path. This historical tension manifested itself in the Bolshevik desire to see Russia reach and surpass European levels of development. At the same time, this development would be guided by Marxist ideology, which became both a way of attacking the capitalism of the West and a way of showing how Russia was unique. Throughout the existence of the Soviet state the Bolsheviks constantly believed they had to defend themselves from what they saw as an immoral, exploitative Western world. Thus, in terms of the collective agency of the Bolsheviks, once they had seized power they could not simply proceed towards the transformation of the pre-existing structures of tsarist Russia. On an even more fundamental level the Bolsheviks had to prove the legitimacy of their ideas and their right to hold power. On the one hand, this meant intellectual self-justification which, as we have seen, was achieved by emphasising the importance of revolutionary elites and the role of the vanguard party. However, more importantly their vision had to involve a significant degree of mass support and participation which, as we have also seen, was largely absent when the Bolsheviks came to power. Certain historians of a purely totalitarian persuasion have sometimes overemphasised the combination of ideology and terror, implying that the Bolsheviks treated the masses with contempt and, therefore, had no interest in whether or not they had their support.21 But such accounts fail to recognise the importance of the mass of ordinary people for the potential realisation of Marxist ideals. Coercion was, of course, an option available to the Bolsheviks and one that was often employed in the 1930s. Yet, pure coercion can rarely be the sole basis for the effective functioning of a modern state. The industrialisation of the Soviet Union required mass cooperation to achieve its extremely ambitious goals. But the Bolsheviks wanted more than cooperation. They wanted the masses to believe in the ideals of the classless society of emancipated human beings and to be\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\npart of the transformation towards that society. It was not their intention to enslave ordinary people. The Bolsheviks were subject to constraints on various different levels. As we have seen, on a fundamental level they had to contend with economic backwardness, which always threatened to undermine their entire project. But they were also constrained by political and social issues. In particular, their claim to embody the will of the masses was problematic given their ideological partiality to the working class. They may have been able to offer a brief and superficial appeal to the peasantry, but the Bolsheviks believed in collective ownership, while the peasant was desperate to maintain a significant degree of private farming. The Bolsheviks were also constrained and, to some extent, influenced by the political mentalities and traditions of the past. Generally, autocracy and coercive government have been regarded as central to Russian history. While there is a great deal of truth in this, recent research has shown that there was a long-standing pre-Revolutionary belief in strong government constrained by religious and national tradition in the interests of the masses. If the Bolsheviks were too repressive, they might be seen as a continuation of the worst aspects of tsarism, but if they failed to be ruthless, they might be perceived as weak utopians. The Bolsheviks ultimately leaned towards the idea of an extremely powerful and unconstrained government, which was consistent with their monolithic view that any power ceded to the opposition, or even the slightest element of pluralism, would destroy the entire Revolutionary enterprise. Another aspect of the pre-Revolutionary political mode of thinking was a belief in the centrality of the state not merely as a mechanism for maintaining public order and raising taxes, but also for administering justice, acting as a moral arbitrator in public affairs and playing a substantial role in economic ownership and regulation. Thus the substantial role of the state was already firmly rooted before the arrival of the Bolsheviks. Nonetheless, the communist agenda was very specific in that it sought to use the state’s resources to gain the support of and mobilise the masses toward a distinctive political vision, eliminating private property in favour of a state-led form of public ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange.22 These factors limited the strategies open to the Bolsheviks. The demands they faced from millions of peasants and workers meant they had to be decisive, strong-willed and, most importantly, they had to produce visible results quickly in order to maintain their hold on power. Following years of civil war, the revolutionaries sensibly adopted the course\n\n12\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nof compromise through the NEP (New Economic Policy) which allowed them to consolidate their position and foster economic recovery. However, the Bolsheviks were never satisfied with compromise. Their revolutionary model was preoccupied with the need to fit Russia into the Marxist historical schema and to reach the level of economic and social development that Marx had seen as a necessary prerequisite for the socialist transition period. This necessitated rapid economic development as well as radical policies that would prove the legitimacy of Bolshevik power. By the end of the 1920s, the decision to embark on holistic transformation had been made. Certainly, this was partly due to Stalin’s political manoeuvring, yet it was also fully consistent with the Bolshevik revolutionary ‘all or nothing’ model and their impatience to enact radical programmes. The structural constraints that the Bolsheviks faced both internally and externally meant that their choices and strategies were always restricted. Their choice to go down the path of exclusive, elite dictatorship meant that they would always be on the defensive. Their inability to reconcile a grandiose ideological outlook with these structural constraints led to the evolution of a defensive way of thinking, a sense of constantly being under siege. As well as the constant need for self-justification, the Bolsheviks knew that the greater mass of the people, including the huge peasantry, were not with them. This became more obvious during the grain requisitioning onslaught after the Revolution and the later industrialisation and collectivisation programmes. In addition to the realisation that the majority of the people were not sympathetic to the regime, the revolutionaries genuinely believed that there were traitors, enemies, spies and saboteurs throughout society intent on destroying the communist dream. This was accompanied by the fear that the capitalist countries were also attempting to undermine the Soviet system by any means necessary. When a regime believes that it is under siege it takes defensive measures not unlike those adopted during a war. Thus the strategy of holistic transformation was guided and shaped by the revolutionaries’ defensive outlook. However, the reaction of defending or closing up, especially when radical measures had unintended consequences, meant that the Bolsheviks tended not to learn from their mistakes. Their strong belief in a rigid revolutionary model meant, as we shall see, that the Soviet government and cinema administration continued to implement failing policies to the cinema industry, fearing that openness to new ideas might be seen as an acknowledgement of political failure.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nImplications for Cinema How does what we have said relate to our central concern, Soviet cinema? In order to answer this question we must examine the formal, intended functions of cinema in Soviet society. Cinema presented the Bolsheviks with a potentially powerful weapon, as it was not only an exciting new technology; it was also accessible and appealing to the masses as an art form that they could engage in. From the communist perspective, cinema could serve many crucial functions. First of all, it could play its role in the struggle to circumvent the problems implied by illiteracy. Yet, this was not merely a practical application. The liquidation of illiteracy would be done within the terms of reference and ideas of communist ideology. Therefore, cinema would politically educate the masses so that they would develop a conscious understanding of the Revolution, the new socialist reality and their part in that reality. At its most ambitious, such an education would contribute to the creation of a ‘New Soviet Man’, a highly moral, socialist paragon of virtue, dedicated to the final goal of communism. However, the most fundamental task of cinema was never publicly spelled out. As we have argued, the Bolsheviks’ defensive way of thinking was central to their outlook and this had both an impact on their idea of cinema’s purpose and how it should be organised. The cinema industry became both part of the quest for legitimacy and part of the frontline of political and ideological defence. It had to legitimise and protect communist ideology, power and, most importantly, the reality that they had given rise to. The communists could not properly explain why their hold on power did not correspond to the supposedly scientific Marxist theoretical framework to a sceptical intelligentsia, although the average Soviet citizen was almost certainly not interested in such issues. Nonetheless, ordinary people were concerned with the everyday reality that sprang from Bolshevik thinking. The communists had to reconcile their rhetoric of human emancipation with the grim Soviet reality of breakneck industrialisation and the hardship and low living standards that came with such a transformation. Party leaders also knew that achieving mass cooperation was essential for the realisation of their goals. So they had to convince the masses of the necessity of their effective participation in socialist construction, by claiming that they were working towards a communist paradise. Thus cinema was to play a fundamental role, not only in politically educating and moulding the new man, but also in showing ordinary people that their feats and sacrifices were in their own interests and the interests of society as a whole. Cinema would\n\n14\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nplay a crucial role in helping to keep the masses on side while they made good the modernisation gap required to give them the better life that they yearned for and to provide an interim legitimacy for the Bolsheviks. Indeed, film’s political function went beyond political education, mobilisation and persuasion. As we shall see in the final chapter, film would also play a key role in sharing the Bolsheviks’ burden of political responsibility with ordinary citizens. The Bolshevik defensive way of thinking that emerged was shaped by a range of past and present structures but, most of all, by the irreconcilable gap between their political aims and the pre-existing structures within which they had to operate. This defensiveness sought to protect the communist ideal and Soviet power from being exposed as fraudulent. It guided policy and administration, which rested on the uneasy foundations of profound political insecurity and illegitimacy, and was a disaster for Soviet cinema, bringing it to the brink of productive and creative collapse. As we shall observe, this defensiveness manifested itself in many different ways on both an institutional and an individual level. Ultimately, its main effect was to undermine the very industry that had been intended to serve as a frontline in the ideological defence of the Bolshevik regime.\n\n15\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\nT\n\nhis chapter will examine the role of government, Party and administrative decision-making and the development of Soviet cinema’s industry and infrastructure. The 1930s saw a gradual shift from a preoccupation with the macromanagement of the broader industry, to organising cinema on centralised principles and imposing ideological control over the production process. This shift was particularly evident in official government and Party decision-making, as well as industry administration. At this time the administration came under increasing pressure not only to create an industry that reached the masses and was economically successful, but also ideologically sound. However, the impact of defensiveness had unintended negative consequences. Boris Shumiatsky, the cinema chairman, reacted to increasing centralisation and his own decreasing autonomy by devising an individual defensive strategy to protect his position of power. This involved an attempt to prove his credentials as an ideal Bolshevik leader of Soviet cinema, in the course of which Shumiatsky became obsessed with micromanaging the industry. His everyday activities shifted from a concern with broader industry development to checking every film script before production, controlling individuals’ movements and writing letters to Stalin and Molotov, pleading for funds or approval of some sort. This made a huge contribution to stunting the growth and success of Soviet cinema. In this way, Bolshevik defensiveness had an effect on the day-to-day operation of the system, as well as its output. Paradoxically, the desire to defend and protect thus provided the source of the system’s paralysis as well as its chaotic aspects. It helped create elaborate structures of control while simultaneously undermining these principles of organisation by taking them to absurd levels.\n\n16\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, the Soviet film industry was under attack from government and Party representatives as well as journalists. The cinema administration, initially under the name Sovkino, was accused of pursuing an overtly commercial line with too much emphasis on films of a Hollywood type that did not address the vital political issues of the time and were clearly intended for profitable export. Sovkino was also criticised for spending vast sums of hard currency on the import of popular Western product in the interest of profiteering. In essence, it was considered that Sovkino showed far more concern for ‘trivial’, ‘bourgeois’ films than the more ideologically sound products. Yet, ideological reasons were not considered to be Sovkino’s only shortcomings. It was accused of failing to develop the industry itself with too few films being produced and not enough adequate theatres to show these films.1 The criticism culminated in the first All-Union Party Conference on Cinema which was held on 15–21 March 1928 under the auspices of the Party’s Central Committee. This was an important turning point as it marked the beginning of the gradual shift towards centralised administration, which would eventually have a detrimental effect on Soviet cinema. The conference was an attempt to bring political order to Soviet cinema and direct it along a secure ideological path. A series of key resolutions were made at the event. Acknowledging the public’s love of action, adventure and comedy, which they had become accustomed to through popular Soviet films and imported American and European films, it was stressed that movies should provide communist enlightenment, but in a form ‘intelligible to the millions’. This meant that cinema had to convey the political message, but in an entertaining manner that would engage the mass audience.2 The conference also noted what it regarded as the political unreliability of those who ran the cinema industry, calling for more workers and peasants with Marxist sympathies from the spheres of literature, theatre and journalism to take control. Among the other important resolutions was recognition of the importance of creating an expanded cinema industry to reach the masses and a domestic infrastructure, thus freeing itself from dependency on the foreign market in areas such as film stock and almost all forms of cinema equipment and hardware.3 The fact that the Party conference was to help shape the elaborate legislative framework of subsequent years became immediately evident. On 11 January 1929, a Central Committee decree was promulgated, reflecting the aims of the conference resolution that referred to cadres.\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\n17\n\nThe decree entitled: ‘On the Strengthening of Cinema Cadres’, was intended to ‘proletarianise’ the personnel throughout the Soviet cinema industry on every level. The decree proposed that Party, professional, Komsomol and civic/scientific organisations foster the development of new cadres and discuss cinema enterprise production plans. Writers of working-class or peasant origins were to be drawn into the work of studios on a permanent basis. The predominantly proletarian and peasant personnel elements in cinema were to be guaranteed by giving these groups a seventy-five per cent quota in the cinema schools.4 The decree represented the first of many legislative building blocks in the ambitious effort to create a centralised system of complete control over the cinema industry. The part that this piece of legislation was intended to play in the overall framework was the elimination of the old, ideologically unreliable ‘bourgeois’ personnel in favour of the new and younger generation. In essence, the decree sought to ensure that the views of the political leadership and the creative workers of cinema coincided. The Party made the sweeping assumption that those of a working-class background would both agree with the communist outlook and, therefore, were best suited to producing ideologically sound films. Indeed, the impact of this decree in subsequent years brought limited results for the leadership. While the numbers of workers and peasants entering into all areas of the cinema industry undoubtedly rose, the process of giving individuals from these backgrounds positions of control was extremely slow. A year and two months after the decree it was noted, during the purges of Mezhrabpomfilm, that of the two hundred and twenty-six personnel working at the studio, only sixteen to twenty could be considered to be of worker or peasant origin.5 Moreover, this minority carried out tasks, such as joinery, which was important for film production, but had little influence on the running of the studio’s artistic and administrative affairs. By the end of 1930, even after the height of purges in cinema had passed, it was clear that administrative personnel of working-class and peasant origins were struggling to break through into leading positions of authority. This led to further calls for the working class to take control of cinema production.6 However, most key positions were still held by older specialists from what was regarded as a less desirable social background. As we shall see later, it would only be during the late thirties when those of a working-class or peasant background would occupy many more positions of power. One of the central reasons for the slow rise of worker and peasant personnel was their lack of experience\n\n18\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nand training in administrative and artistic matters. Indeed, the failure to fully purge the cinema of the old bureaucrats, typically of a middle/ lower middle-class or an intelligentsia social background, was due, to a large extent, to the need for their experience and expertise at a time when these were desperately required. The Soviet government issued several decrees over 1929–30. The first of these established the short-lived Cinema Committee which was entrusted with the task of planning for the future development of a centralised cinema industry. Yet its proposals for reorganisation were passed on to a special Central Committee commission to be finished off. On 10 July 1929, a decree was passed ‘On Tax Relief for the Cinema Industry’, proposing the freeing-up of the sphere of cinema equipment production from business tax, as well as general state and local tax breaks for cinema theatres affiliated to institutions, industrial enterprises, military units, educational establishments and so on. In reality though, this was a meagre concession. The domestic cinema equipment sector was still relatively small at this stage and, therefore, any taxes gained by the state would have been fairly modest. Moreover, the lifting of taxes from cinemas affiliated to various institutions and the mobile installations was certainly a positive move, but offered no relief to the urban theatres, which made the real taxable money that could have benefited the industry. Indeed, tax on cinema tickets would consistently rise during the 1930s at a time when the industry desperately needed all the finances it could hold on to.7 Later that year further decrees were issued concerning the establishment of cinefication funds intended to finance the expansion of the cinema network although, again, this involved more talk than action. This was followed by a further decree, promulgated on 7 December 1929, instructing cinema enterprises to create special departments devoted to the production of politico-educational films. A substantial thirty per cent of each studio’s budget was to be allocated to the production of these films and the union commissariats were expected to devote resources to politico-educational work in the sphere of cinema. However, the most important decrees issued at the turn of the decade were those that shaped the structure and administration of the cinema industry. On 13 February 1930, the Soviet government issued a decree entitled ‘On the Development of an All-Union Cinema Industry Combine’. The rather brief document pointed out that the new organisation, named Soiuzkino, should concentrate on ‘all matters concerning the production of cinema equipment’, as well as ‘all matters of film production, rental and general use’.8\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\n19\n\nA charter was drawn up for the new cinema administrative body Soiuzkino to provide further clarification on the purpose of the new organisation. The charter indicated that Soiuzkino would be responsible for the broad leadership, planning and regulation of the cinema industry. The charter also suggested that full centralisation had not yet arrived. It specifically stated that, while Soiuzkino would have ideological leadership of film production, in the republics, the regional Narkompros (People’s Commissariat of Enlightenment) agencies would be responsible for such leadership. Moreover, while the advent of Soiuzkino signalled the end for almost all of those studios which did not constitute part of the state film industry, the charter notably allowed the Mezhrabpomfilm studio to retain almost complete independence due to the fact that it was owned, to some extent, by foreign capital. Soiuzkino only had the powers to check and approve its production plans. It is very likely that as the foreign investors were from International Workers’ Aid, who supported the communist cause, this studio was tolerated for a few more years. The prolonged existence of the Mezhrabpomfilm studio meant that competition for the now government-led cinema industry had not been completely extinguished.9 A brief glance at the decrees on cinema issued at the turn of the decade reveals a striking emphasis on the macromanagement of the economic and administrative aspects of the cinema industry rather than the predominance of ideological concerns that one might expect, given the fact that the cultural revolution was now in full swing. The aforementioned decrees point to a central concern with the economic development of cinema, focusing on ways of speeding up the process through tax relief and establishing cinema funds for the expansion and growth of the industry. Even the decree, which called for the establishment of what was to become Soiuzkino, quite clearly suggests that the main role of the new body was to oversee the construction of new studios, cinema equipment manufacture and the general economic development of the cinema industry. On the other hand, the decrees on cadres and politico-educational films certainly indicate that ideological questions were also of the utmost importance in this period. It is also important to note that certain non-legislative means of influence were getting more rigid, such as censorship, thematic planning, as well as ideological indoctrination through the cinema education system. Yet the broad emphasis on economic matters in cinema decrees reflected the modernisation drive to close the development gap which, as we have observed, was so important to the Bolsheviks.\n\n20\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nBoris Shumiatsky Government and Party decrees were crucial in developing the basic structure of the industry, but the most important individual was the head of that industry. The first chairman of Soiuzkino was Martemian Riutin, who had carried out Party work in Irkutsk, Dagestan and Moscow in the 1920s, before becoming a member of the VSNKh (Supreme Council of the National Economy in the USSR) Presidium in 1930. He was an apparently reliable Party figure, advocating strict planning, socialist production techniques, administrative intervention where necessary, as well as rigid censorship. On the other hand, Riutin also argued that the cinema organisations under Soiuzkino’s control must be given at least some independence and ought to show initiative. He even took the concerns of the republics into account, persuading the Politburo to halt temporarily the moves towards full centralisation. Ultimately, the main reason for Riutin’s brief spell as chairman of Soiuzkino was connected to his conflicting political relations with Stalin, which would eventually lead to his arrest. On October 23 1930, the VSNKh ordered Riutin’s dismissal.10 In the meantime, Konstantin Shvedchikov, who had been criticised for his commercialism as chairman in the late 1920s, took temporary charge of Soiuzkino until the VSNKh declared Boris Shumiatsky as the new chairman one month later on 23 November 1930.11 Shumiatsky would prove to be the most important leader of the cinema industry throughout the 1930s, at least until his arrest in 1938. In his first few years of control, Shumiatsky and his board were preoccupied with the transition to sound and the construction from scratch of a cinema industry capable of producing its own raw film stock, cameras, projectors, sound recording machines, lighting and so on. Consequently, Soiuzkino decrees were predominantly concerned with approving economic plans or demanding additions or amendments to those plans. There were endless orders on producing or acquiring sound equipment along with all the other necessary components for film-making and on securing the qualified personnel who could operate the new devices.12 Shumiatsky was very conscious of the need for the Soviet industry to become independent from foreign products and during his first few years he repeated much of the general political rhetoric on how the end of this dependence was in sight. Thus Shumiatsky gave strong support to ‘mass inventiveness’ such as a certain Kosmatov’s idea of reusable film stock.13 Directives were issued supporting such inventiveness, demanding an end to the sabotage\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\n21\n\nallegedly preventing such ideas from reaching fruition. Many of Soiuzkino’s directives revealed a central concern with the frequent lack of discipline in the workplace or general slovenliness and irresponsibility among certain personnel. This had implications for efficiency and productivity so Shumiatsky passed an order, which would mean wage deductions or sackings for those who did not fall into line.14 It is important to point out that ideological matters were not completely absent from Shumiatsky’s agenda in the early to mid-1930s. For instance, he issued orders demanding improvements to film quality by ending the production of films that were reflective of an ‘ideology alien to the proletariat’. He also ordered the introduction of questionnaires for new personnel in every sector of the cinema industry. This reflected his concern to attract those from ideologically reliable backgrounds.15 Yet, on the whole, Shumiatsky’s ideological measures were fairly low key during his first few years in charge of cinema. His concern with broader industry development was illustrated in a draft plan written by Shumiatsky in 1931, under the heading, ‘The Big Programme of Soiuzkino for 1932’. Shumiatsky began with the now familiar condemnations of Soviet cinema to date. That is the lack of film productivity, caused by the same old ‘illnesses’ of Soviet cinema production, namely far too many ideologically unsound films, as well as the lack of scripts and cadres. Shumiatsky also complained of the lack of an industrial base for the production of film stock and filming equipment, as well as the poor financial position of Soviet cinema in terms of its debts and tax obligations, but also with regard to investment in capital construction. Furthermore, Shumiatsky pointed out that completed films were not being exploited properly and cinefication was characterised by the backwardness of the rural and school cinema network.16 In response to these problems, Shumiatsky proposed a comprehensive programme of development and reconstruction for Soviet cinema. First of all, Shumiatsky aspired to the creation of 500 full-length films, including more than 100 silent movies compared to the output of 200 films in 1931. He looked to a figure of 3 billion cinema visits in 1932 compared with 700 million in 1930 and 1 billion in 1931, as well as a 1 billion rouble turnover compared to 400 million in 1931 and 300 million in 1930. From these rather optimistic figures, Shumiatsky deduced that the state would be able to deduct taxes and duties of between 200 and 220 million roubles, as opposed to 100 million in 1931 and 20 million in 1930. He wanted to see a clear profit for Soviet cinema of between 200–\n\n22\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\n220 million roubles instead of the zero profit of 1930 and the 17 million roubles made in 1931. As well as a dramatic increase in financial growth, Shumiatsky aspired to massive industrial projects, including the building of a gigantic film stock factory, three new studios in Central Asia, Belorussia and Eastern Siberia, 100 new cinema theatres in new areas and kolkhoz centres, 8,500 sound cinema installations and 50,000 new mobile installations. Shumiatsky’s plan was extremely ambitious. While it was intended to be a programme for 1932, in terms of the figures suggested, it would really prove to be a programme for the entire decade.17 Sound In 1929–30 the central issue of the time for Soviet cinema was the transition to sound. Such a transition, of course, had huge political significance. In the 1930s, illiteracy was still a significant issue and, while film certainly played its role in eliminating this problem, sound cinema provided the ideal means of reaching the masses in a more effective way. Sound also constituted a technical and economic shift. The director, cameraman, scriptwriter and journalist, Nikolai Anoshchenko, recognised that the rhetoric of the political leadership on ‘catching and overhauling the West’ could, ironically, not be realised without the technical help of the West. Other journalists, such as Ippolit Sokolov, believed that the Soviet sound devices invented by Pavel Tager and Alexander Shorin were both important and not inferior to their American rivals. 18 But Anoshchenko argued in March 1930 that, despite Tager and Shorin’s impressive efforts, sound cinema in the USSR was still at an ‘elementary stage of development’. In effect, the materials that Tager and Shorin were working with to develop their ideas were not sophisticated enough and so the quality of their first experimental films was fairly low. Anoshchenko realistically contended that, if Soviet cinema wanted to make a quick and effective transition to sound cinema for the benefit of quality, propaganda and the overseas trade of Soviet films, then the cinema administration simply had to rely on American help and technical advice.19 Regardless of the official government line on independent Soviet economic development, the government and the cinema administration succumbed to the practical need for technical assistance. On 25 June 1930, Soiuzkino established an agreement with a New York company called Audio-Cinema to ‘give Soiuzkino technical help in the planning, design and installation of equipment for sound studios and theatres,\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\n23\n\napplying the most up-to-date methods of the cinema industry’.20 The American specialist, Joey Koffman, arrived in the Soviet Union in the autumn of 1930, bringing with him all the latest equipment to satisfy Soiuzkino’s requirements, including microphones and modulators. His ten-thousand-dollar payment also entailed advising Soiuzkino specialists how to operate and develop the sound system. Soiuzkino’s reaction to Koffman’s visit was frank. In a letter from Soiuzkino to the VSNKh it was stated that, with the availability of the American equipment, it was now possible to order the laboratories of Leningrad and Moscow (where Tager and Shorin were based respectively) to ‘copy immediately these samples significantly improving the construction of our sound recording and sound producing apparatuses’.21 In addition to Koffman’s visit, Soviet representatives including Ippolit Sokolov, Sergei Eisenstein, Grigori Alexandrov and Eduard Tisse went abroad to observe how cinema industries operated and produced in Europe and America and reported back in detail on their return.22 Nonetheless, despite these exchanges, lack of funds meant that sound device manufacture was very slow and sound cinema took many years to develop in the USSR. Cinefication The development of sound in Soviet cinema was closely associated with the development of ‘Kinofikatsiia’ (cinefication) in the country at large. In essence, this referred to the expansion of the cinema network and the availability of viewing facilities in both the urban and rural environments. Even if the production of sound films had been more substantial, the chances of being able to see them were fairly slim for the majority of the population. By June 1931, the Soviet enterprises concerned had only managed to produce one sound projector, which was set up in a theatre that month.23 The situation remained difficult throughout the 1930s. By the end of the first Five Year Plan in 1933, there were now 27,578 cinema installations, but only 224 had sound projectors. In 1938 there were still only 28,574 cinema installations overall. It seems that many of the silent projectors had been decommissioned as the proportion of sound projectors included in this figure had now reached 11,242. It was only by the end of 1938 that the quantity of sound projectors within the overall network reached the 54 per cent mark.24 Overall then, despite the dramatic increase between the mid-1920s and the beginning of the new decade, the growth of cinema outlets was fairly meagre in the 1930s, largely due to the slow transition to sound. It made no sense to produce more silent projectors,\n\n24\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nyet the technological base was not developed enough to enable the mass production of sound projectors. We can gain a strong idea of just how poorly the cinema network was serving the population from the proposals of the third Five Year Plan declared in 1939. In order to provide adequate cinema facilities throughout the USSR, Viacheslav Molotov announced that the network of sound-producing stationary and mobile projectors would have to be increased by six times.25 The cinefication programme undoubtedly favoured the urban and European part of the Soviet Union. Throughout the 1930s, the major towns and cities of the USSR consistently had over one third of the viewing facilities of the entire Union. Despite Shumiatsky’s wish to create a network over a five year period that would give cinema access to the majority of the peasant population, this did not materialise. Moreover, the quality of cinefication in the urban environment was far superior to that of the country.26 For example, the Udarnik cinema in Moscow could boast a one thousand seat capacity and a grand foyer where waiting patrons could listen to an orchestra, dance, play chess or read. This cinema, as with most urban equivalents, also had a buffet area where customers could have something to drink, such as a cup of tea on a cold night, or some sandwiches, smoked herring, caviar or a pastry. In addition, the viewing experience was better than in rural cinemas as film goers could often see newly issued film prints sometimes shown in cinemas equipped with sound.27 In contrast, films in the countryside were usually shown with silent projectors which were often aged and subject to constant technical problems, leading to persistent film stoppages. Due to the frequently poor state of the film copies, projectionists sometimes had to piece film together with fragments of different films, causing either confusion or amusement among the peasants. Throughout the mid-1930s, films in the country were still being shown in small rooms of about five-six square metres in kolkhoz administrative offices, which were crammed to capacity and generally did not even have seats. Such places were often dirty, dark, cold and sometimes had leaking roofs. Moreover, the projectionist, who was expected to deliver and set up the mobile cinema on site as well as prepare the premises and advertise the showing, sometimes did not turn up. At least certain rural areas had some form of cinema provision, in remote regions of the RSFSR (Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) and republics, such as Tadzhikistan, Turkmenia and Kirgizia, cinema was a rare event.28\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\nA cartoon sketch of a couple leaving an outdoor cinema in the countryside (1935).\n\nShumiatsky’s administration was so preoccupied with broader industry development that it tended to neglect matters of distribution and exhibition. This may have been partly due to the fact that the agencies that controlled these areas were answerable to Shumiatsky, but had a fair degree of autonomy. In Moscow, up until 1934, cinemas were still dominated by foreign product much of which had been imported in the\n\n25\n\n26\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nlate 1920s. In the summer of 1933, one critic demanded to know why Moscow’s theatres could only show dated foreign films, including comedies featuring Harold Lloyd and Monty Banks, escapist westerns or German thrillers that had been seen time and time again with the exception of the occasional new import.29 Although by 1934 the import of new foreign films was reduced to a few on a yearly basis, it did not completely stop. Events, such as the first international film festival in Moscow in 1935, brought the Walt Disney cartoons Three Little Pigs (1933), Peculiar Penguins (1934) and The Band Concert (1935) among other feature films. Even many of the Soviet films shown in the early to mid-1930s were the hits of the 1920s, such as The Bear’s Wedding (Medvezhia svadba, 1926) or Miss Mend (1926) rather than the politicised classics. It was clear by the way that films were being advertised that urban film exhibition still had an essentially commercial face. Lower down the distribution ladder the situation was equally problematic. The difficulty in both workers’ clubs and rural areas was not an excess of foreign films, but rather the lack of films generally. In 1936 one commentator claimed that eighty per cent of the installations were showing dated films which, in many cases, were in a condition not worthy of public exhibition. The typical sort of film shown would again be Soviet product from the late 1920s, such as Grigori Roshal’s The Salamander (Salamandra, 1928), a film about the biologist Paul Kammerer, which was unpopular on its original release, or Amo Bek-Nazarian’s Khaz Push (1928), a film about a revolt of Persian peasants and craftsmen in 1891. Older foreign films were also shown in the countryside, such as Duke Worne’s Blue Fox (1921), an American adventure movie. The obvious concern for Party officials was not only that the more prestigious urban theatres and, to a lesser extent, the workers’ clubs and kolkhoz buildings, were still showing many dated foreign films, as well as old domestic product, but that most new Soviet films were hardly being shown at all throughout the USSR. Soviet citizens, especially in the smaller towns and countryside, could only be offered the same films from the 1920s over and over again. It was clear to all that the new ‘cinema for the millions’ was not reaching the millions.30 The crux of the problem was the lack of prints available for new Soviet films. In the mid-1930s, it usually took two to three years before the areas with cinema provision had seen the majority of new Soviet films due to the low productivity of the newly established copy factories, and this was compounded by the slowness of production. There simply\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\nA caricature of foreign film stars sitting on top of one another.

Over the next few years, this figure slowly increased and prints for sound projectors also began to emerge. By the end of the decade, this had risen to around 250– 300 sound and silent copies per film, which was still less than sufficient. It is useful to draw a comparison with America in this case. In 1940 the USA had fewer than 20,000 cinemas compared to just over 29,000 viewing facilities in the USSR. The average number of prints for major American films at this time was 250, similar to the Soviet figure. However, the fundamental difference was that America produced 673 movies in 1940 compared to the USSR’s 40 films. So, in addition to the fact that US theatres were well provided with film prints, they also had a high level of choice.31 In contrast, the Soviet industry which, in theory at least, believed that every Soviet citizen should see its major films, failed to produce and distribute enough films and copies for the necessary communication of the communist message. There were some exceptions to this rule, such as Sergei Eisenstein’s Alexander Nevsky (1938) and Fridrikh Ermler’s Peasants (Krestiane, 1935), which were both eventually released in 900 copies. A few more, including part two of Ermler’s The Great Citizen (Velikii grazhdanin, 1937–9) were released in between approximately 500– 600 copies. But, even for this minority of films, such figures were still less than sufficient, especially when we take into account the low output of film production and the rapid decline of the copies. On the whole, the distribution of most films, including ideologically important propaganda movies such as Lenin in 1918 (Lenin v 1918, 1939), was meagre. In 1939 one observer noted that Tula, one of the better-served regions of the Soviet Union, which had 79 installations, had been presented with only 5 copies of the film. Moreover, although the sound network would increase sharply over the next two years, at this point nearly half of the network still consisted of silent projectors. Despite this, no silent copies of Lenin in 1918 were produced and this applied to other films, such as Shchors (1939) and T he Tractor Drivers (Traktoristy, 1939).32 A great deal of the blame for what was being shown on the screens throughout the USSR in the early to mid-1930s was placed on the shoulders of the film distribution agencies. Rossnabfilm and its Union representatives remained fairly autonomous until 1938, which meant that a policy of profit making with the films that were available still prevailed\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\n29\n\nover planned, ideologically orientated distribution throughout the decade. Although distribution did not fall directly under Shumiatsky’s jurisdiction, he and his successors gave their full support to the idea of planned repertoires, thus helping to level the imbalances favouring urban centres, as well as ending commercialism and competition between theatres. In 1938 distribution was centralised under Semyon Dukelsky, formally giving the new Cinema Committee more control over what was being shown on Soviet screens. However, by the end of the decade, Soiuzkinoprokat, the division of the Cinema Committee now responsible for distribution, was failing to distribute films evenly. Instead of planning, the old commercial system of dividing cinemas up into first, second and third screens remained in place, suggesting that the administrators of Soiuzkinoprokat were not prepared to distribute some new film prints to the less profitable regions and villages first in the interests of ideology.33 Theatre managers in Moscow regarded the new system of planned repertoires as chaotic. They complained that Soiuzkinoprokat often did not provide them with details of film content and duration, which meant that planning timetables and selling tickets in advance was impossible. Managers also complained that Soiuzkinoprokat frequently promised individual theatres specific films. In response to this, the theatres would arrange advertisements and sell a large quantity of advance tickets only to learn that they would not receive the film after all.34 These complaints suggest that the very opposite of planning was taking place in the area of film distribution. Some argued that the theatres themselves should also be under a consistent, centralised control structure. When the autonomous Cinefication Administration was established in 1933, the theatres that had formerly fallen under Sovkino and Soiuzkino control were placed in its hands, while equivalent administrations were established in the republics. Yet, although private ownership had by now been officially liquidated, urban theatres were controlled by a variety of organisations that still competed with each other for the biggest profits. Moscow provides an interesting example. Those cinema outlets, which did not constitute part of the Cinefication Administration trust system, were under the control of Moscow City Council, the autonomous Mezhrabpom, which controlled several top theatres in the capital, and other organisations, such as Vostokfilm, which also owned a theatre in Moscow. These different outlets were all in competition with one another to maximise profits. Gradually, ownership was narrowed down. In 1936 Mezhrabpom was\n\n30\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nliquidated, as was Vostokino. In 1938 the Cinefication Administration was also liquidated, handing over the control of many cinemas to the centralised Cinema Committee. In Moscow the majority of theatres were now under the control of the city council’s cinema trust (Mosgorkino). In effect, the competition had been significantly reduced. Nonetheless, even in Moscow there was a clear divide between the quality of theatres located in the centre of the city and those further outside the main metropolis. Managers of the top theatres knew that they would be most likely to receive the best films and the newest prints. Consequently, they could charge as much as four roubles a ticket in comparison to the lesser theatres, which usually charged less than two roubles a ticket. In contrast, tickets for the most basic rural cinema installation cost as little as fifty kopecks. Ultimately, the desire to eliminate competition and introduce an ideologically sound, planned, equal system of film access was compromised by a distribution and theatre system that was stratified and inevitably succumbed to the practical necessity of making money for the state. Shumiatsky’s task of overseeing the establishment of an industry and infrastructure was a particularly big challenge. The production of Soviet film stock was considered to be a matter of urgent priority as the USSR had become accustomed to importing it from Western Europe and America on a large scale and at a high cost for the cinema industry. In 1929 construction began on the USSR’s first film stock factory in Shostka in the north of Russia and this was soon followed by the building of a second factory at Pereslavl-Zalessky near Moscow. In the Shostka case a deal was reached with Lumière to help with the construction and equipping of the film stock factory, while a company called SIMP (Société Industrielle des Matières Plastiques) was hired to provide similar support in Pereslavl-Zalessky. Both of the factories began operating at the end of 1931. However, the Soviet desire to move towards fully independent film stock production proved to be a slow and difficult process. The official figures suggest that, in 1930, 46 million metres of foreign film stock were imported, but in 1933 this figure had dropped to 1 million metres. Between 1932 and 1941, the output of Soviet film stock remarkably soared by nearly eight fold. Nonetheless, this quantitative increase was not, at least until the end of the 1930s, accompanied by qualitative improvements. Film-makers were consistently presented with low-quality Soviet film stock. Cameramen and directors came to expect ‘new’ film stock that might be scratched, covered in fingerprints, cut to the wrong size, unevenly\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\n31\n\nperforated, or even partly or completely lack the silver compound chemical emulsion necessary to shoot the images.35 Consequently, despite the apparent abundance of film stock, a great deal of it was not up to professional standards. In practice this meant that there were shortages of good quality Soviet stock and this was undoubtedly a factor in the low levels of film production. Although the import of foreign film stock had been curtailed, the evidence suggests that the cinema administration continued to import it, as well as chemical emulsion for the Soviet stock from countries such as Germany and Italy throughout the 1930s and beyond. Indeed, during April 1935, Shumiatsky informed Stalin that film stock was being produced at approximately two times below demand, but also at roughly two times more than was being imported from abroad. This indicated that film stock imports were still very significant.36 Other areas of film equipment production, such as cameras, were less successful. Here too the quality was poor, necessitating a continued reliance on foreign models. Soviet cameramen particularly liked the cameras made by André Debrie’s French company as well as the German ‘Kinemo’ model and these, along with foreign lighting products, dominated film production throughout 1930s. The USSR had been producing its own projectors since the 1920s, but with the advent of sound, the industry struggled to produce both the right quantity and quality of sound projectors. As in every other sphere, Soviet technicians combined their own ideas with foreign designs. American Super-Simplex sound projectors were purchased for urban theatres, including Stalin’s own private cinema and Soviet experts studied their design. While in the countryside the Pathé silent projectors were still abundant.37 Boris Shumiatsky’s initial approach to developing Soviet cinema’s technical base had been to try to reduce the emphasis on imported materials and machines, emphasising the need to develop domestic cinema equipment production. But Shumiatsky developed a more realistic attitude by the mid-thirties, realising that Soviet technical development in cinema had not reached acceptable standards. He was not afraid to tell the political leadership what he thought about the quality of domestic equipment and was instrumental in persuading Stalin and the Central Committee that the import of more foreign products, as well as expertise, was absolutely necessary.38 In May 1935, with Stalin’s approval and the financial backing of the Soviet government, Shumiatsky was permitted to lead a delegation to America to examine technical equipment and\n\n32\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nproduction processes. The main requirement for a better understanding of film stock production was satisfied during this period. The delegation visited the Friedman laboratory in New York where the group studied film developing and film copying machines and were impressed by their speed, efficiency and quality. After the delegation had returned home, several American film technicians were invited to the USSR to help with further improvements and development in the various areas of production. When the technicians arrived, they were posted at Mosfilm and Lenfilm to carry out support work. In addition, the cinema administration ordered a sizeable quantity of technical equipment to be imported into the Soviet Union. In 1936 Shumiatsky’s administration spent nearly 500,000 dollars purchasing American equipment that was used to update the Soviet studios.39 Thus, under Shumiatsky, the aspiration to achieve complete independence for the Soviet cinema industry was gradually brushed aside as importation continued in almost every single area associated with cinema. As we have seen, all the key technical items were still imported, including film stock, cameras and projectors. But other items were also imported by Shumiatsky and his successors. Amongst them were film printing and developing machines, cranes, special automobiles for carrying out moving shots, as well as more minor items, such as cables. This meant that imports varied from, for example, the 3,000 roubles released by the government in 1940 for Ivan Bolshakov’s administration to make some purchases in France, Germany and Switzerland to the 300,000 dollars spent by Bolshakov’s representatives in New York in the same year, with plans to spend three times that amount.40 Given the continued need for imported materials it is important to note that the Soviet film industry did export materials in the 1930s although levels of items, such as raw film stock, cameras, projectors and so on were relatively low. As the USSR was fairly new to these areas of production, demand for its raw film stock and equipment was almost non-existent in the West. Most of the income from exports in the late 1930s came from neighbouring countries, such as China and Mongolia, which were at a fairly early stage of cinema industry development.41 By far the most profitable area of export for the Soviet film industry were the films themselves. In the mid-to-late 1920s, Soviet films achieved both critical and financial success in countries such as Germany and the USA. Yet, despite the financial success, the USSR was receiving little in terms of a currency equivalent due to relatively weak connections and understandings\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\n33\n\nof Western markets, as well as a lack of specialised personnel to trade with foreign partners and establish more beneficial price policies.42 Moreover, by 1933 the close relationship with Germany was ended by the rise of the Nazi regime. Despite this setback, the USSR began to develop a more professional approach to film export with the establishment in 1930 of a specialised department called Intorgkino, which became Soiuzintorgkino in 1933. The closure of the Berlin offices led to the set up of a new permanent Paris office and stronger trade links were forged with America through the Amkino Corporation in New York. Overall though, Soviet trade links with foreign cinema industries remained extremely basic, partly due to the general decline of world trade in the 1930s and the increasingly inward nature of the Soviet economic system. The export of Soviet films to America in the mid-tolate 1930s represents a good example of how underdeveloped trade links were at this time. In 1935 Soiuzintorgkino established an agreement with Amkino, giving that corporation the rights of sale and rent on all types of Soviet film. However, these rights not only covered the USA, but also South America, Central America, Mexico, Cuba and Canada, indicating that Soiuzintorgkino was reliant on one trading partner for the length and breadth of an entire continent. Moreover, while the price of each individual film was negotiable, the copies of all feature films were to be sold for ten cents a metre, which represented a very modest figure for the time. Given such an undeveloped export system, it is not surprising that the actual overall income from film exports, while important, was even lower than the levels of the late 1920s. In 1929 the Soviet Union received 1, 509,000 roubles from film exports. Throughout the 1930s, exports often failed to yield even a third of this figure, falling to 216,000 roubles in 1940.43 GUKF While the development of Soviet cinema’s industrial base was central for Shumiatsky in the early to mid-1930s, changes were gradually taking place which foresaw the shift from macromanagement, concerned with broad industry matters, to micromanagement concerned with film content and control over the film production process. The signs were there as early as 11 February 1933, with a Soviet government decree ‘On the Organisation of the State Directorate for the Film and Photo Industry’. This new body replaced Soiuzkino and was to be directly subordinate to Sovnarkom (Council of Peoples Commissars). The decree gave GUKF\n\n34\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\n(the State Directorate for the Film and Photo Industry) direct authority over several trusts formerly under Soiuzkino control. In the ideological sphere, the new directorate was placed in charge of all higher education institutions dealing with the training of new personnel for the cinema industry in the RSFSR and, more importantly, GUKF was instructed to ‘observe the content of films, examine and confirm basic plans for the production of the most important films.’44 Although the decree, and the charter that followed it were still, to a large extent, concerned with economic factors and corresponding matters of central administration, they also indicated that GUKF was responsible for examining and scrutinising the yearly and quarterly plans of all union and republic trusts for all the main types of film, as well as the plans of the independent Mezhrapomfilm. Moreover, control over film content was extended to the republics. The statute also devoted a section to the administrative structure of the new state directorate. This structure was to be headed by a manager who essentially carried out similar functions to those of Soiuzkino. As with Soiuzkino, the chairman had a considerable degree of autonomy.45 Shumiatsky’s Administration of GUKF Shumiatsky’s administration of GUKF continued in a similar manner to the way he had run its predecessor Soiuzkino. Yet, while the broad development of the Soviet film industry still lay at the heart of the administration’s agenda, Shumiatsky had to deal with everyday issues too. GUKF would occasionally take action if a given trust or organisation was failing to fulfil its obligations. This meant administrative intervention, especially when production efficiency was being hampered in any way. For example, in September 1934, the film stock factories complained of constant shortages of tin boxes needed to package the new reels of film. GUKF reacted to this shortage by ordering the director of the Samara cinema apparatus factory to establish a new agreement with the Shostka film stock enterprise whereby the quantity of tin boxes produced would be more than doubled.46 As the head of Soviet cinema, Shumiatsky used his powers to employ and dismiss on an even more frequent basis between 1933 and 1937. Many of the sackings now took place in the industry trusts responsible for the production of film stock, film copying, cameras, projectors, lighting and other hardware. These factories had only or were only being built in the early 1930s and there were seemingly endless problems with the quality\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\n35\n\nand quantity of output. This led to a series of usually high-profile sackings, such as the two senior engineers based at the Shostka raw film stock factory who were fired in September 1934 due to incompetence. On some occasions Shumiatsky sacked enterprise heads, such as the director of the Leningrad cinema apparatus factory, who was removed in August 1936 for the inability to deal with his workload.47 While organisational and personnel issues were central to the everyday running of the Soviet film industry in the mid-1930s, it was at this time that Shumiatsky began to devote more attention to the content of the films themselves and further increase his micromanagement of the film industry. In 1935–36 he published a series of articles in the cinema press as well as his book A Cinema for the Millions: the Experience of Analysis (Kinematografiia millionov: opyt analiza, 1936) in which he expressed his arguments on the ideological and artistic content of past, present and future Soviet films. Shumiatsky wanted to completely rid Soviet film of Formalist cinema characterised by montage, the absence of a typical plot or a clear line of narrative, the instrumental use of the cinema actor, reducing him to a social type or model and often unnecessary exposition or detail.48 Certainly, Formalist films were now in the minority, but the slow development of sound cinema in the USSR was not helping his cause. Shumiatsky wanted to see the creation of a mass Soviet cinema with compact, entertaining films that would have simple plots and heroic figures with whom the audience could identify. The mass spectator would also be attracted by a broader range of genres including drama, comedy, fairy tales and the biographical film, as well as new themes, ranging from socialist construction in the town and the countryside to defence. Only this type of cinema could effectively convey the communist message to the broader audience. A Soviet Hollywood? Part of his inspiration for developing such a cinema undoubtedly came from the USA. After returning from his three-month trip to America, Shumiatsky and the other members of his delegation wanted to apply some of the best aspects of American film production to the studios of the USSR. He wanted to introduce the idea of the producer as the key manager of every Soviet film project. Following Hollywood, Shumiatsky was convinced of the need for producers who would deal with creating a general plan for a given film, including estimates and specific dialogues and have full financial control over resource distribution for a production. The producer would\n\n36\n\nSOVIET CINEMA\n\nalso attend to issues of film crew and actor recruitment as well as obtaining costumes and sets. In short, the producer was expected to deal with the general organisation of the production, allowing the film director to concentrate on artistic matters. Nonetheless, the director was obliged to assist the producer on the artistic aspects of the above issues.49 The Shumiatsky delegation were impressed by other aspects of American studios which also led to high levels of efficiency, namely the professionalism of cinema personnel, the constant improvement of technology and especially the rationalised methods of production, which led to a highly efficient, conveyor system. In effect, Shumiatsky and his colleagues had observed Taylorism in practice whereby film production was based on getting the most out of individual workers through optimisation methods, such as the division of labour into specialist tasks. This was hardly new to Shumiatsky as there had been calls for work rationalisation in the early 1930s. However, this had clearly not developed in any substantive way. Now Shumiatsky insisted on the idea of dividing work into specialised tasks, borrowing America’s ideas of how to run a script department, create stunt and special effects departments and establish editing departments.50 Shumiatsky’s trip to America also inspired his most ambitious project: to create a Soviet Hollywood. Again this idea was not entirely new, in the early 1930s various figures from the film industry had pointed to the need for Soviet cinema to have a southern base. Shumiatsky himself had first mentioned the idea to Stalin in June 1934. In that same year, one journalist described the newly established Yalta studio as such a base, suggesting that substantial investment from GUKF could create a ‘model cinema village’.51 Nonetheless, Shumiatsky’s experience in Hollywood led to his proposal of a huge southern cinema complex far more daring in scope than anything previously put forward. For Shumiatsky, the idea of a Soviet Hollywood represented the potential solution to the extremely low output of Soviet films. Shumiatsky argued that Hollywood’s abundance of sun and minimal levels of rain allowed them to film almost all year round. He was also impressed by the availability of varied outdoor locations within the bounds of the Hollywood studios. Thus he proposed the establishment of a similar base in the Crimea, which would eliminate the difficulties of the long, harsh winters of the north, as well as ending the expensive trips all over the USSR to find suitable natural locations. Such a base would therefore save money but, most importantly, it would improve efficiency, eventually yielding 800 films a year.52 Such output would also be made possible by the\n\nFILM ADMINISTRATION AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT\n\n37\n\nintroduction of changes recommended for all the existing studios in the Soviet Union, namely the establishment of a producer-based system of film-making and a strict division of specialists and labour. The planning stage for the project seemed to go reasonably well. By the end of 1935, Shumiatsky had produced cost estimates for the construction of cine-city (Kino-gorod). The construction would be a largescale project, ranging from tree-lined streets to a huge complex capable of housing four studios as well as permanent accommodation for the thousands of administrators, film-makers and workers. Initially the cost of the enterprise was estimated at 305 million roubles although this figure rose closer to 400 million by 1936. At the beginning of 1936, GUKF set up a special commission to investigate the most appropriate site for cinecity. On 4 July 1936, GUKF announced that the Laspi valley near Foros in the Crimea was its preferred location.53 Yet despite all the preparation and planning, cine-city never emerged. In many ways such an imaginative project was precisely what the somewhat moribund Soviet film industry needed in the "
