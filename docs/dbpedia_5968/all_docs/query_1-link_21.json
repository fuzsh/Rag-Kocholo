In places like this, gallant knights are victorious over mighty evil wizards and they release bewitched, beautiful maidens from captivity. Grey wolves and swift-winged hawks, golden fish and white swans serve valiant heroes with fidelity. Look — there's an ancient oak, covered in moss. Suddenly it turns into a little, wizened old man. An ugly frog, having shed its green skin, turns into Vasilisa the Beautiful. Since their earliest years, our children in the Soviet Union have taken journeys to these secret and wonderful worlds of the fairy tale. Their first books are fairy tales. And the very first films they watch are fairy tales, too ...\n\nTHE C O R R E L A T I O N OF CARTOONS, SONGS, STORIES, AND THEIR AUDIENCES IN THE\n\nSOVIET UNION\n\nOn 30 June 1999 the government of Boris \\eltsin passed a resolution to resurrect the biggest cartoon studio in Eastern Europe, Soiuzmul'tfirm. It had fallen upon very hard times in recent years, a victim of the nation's fickle, poorly behaved economy. Yeltsin felt it important that the studio be restored to its former glory, even keeping its original name, a nationally famous abbreviation made from the Russian words soiuz (\"union\"), mul'tiplikatsiia (\"animation\"), and fil'm (\"film\"). But since the \"union\" vanished eight years prior, was this really nothing more than unbridled nostalgia? Perhaps a rather desperate attempt to revive an innocent childhood? This book responds to these questions with a resounding answer in the negative. The Moscow studio - once properly funded - simply continued doing what it had done since its inception in 1936, when it was founded as the nation's only factory able to handle the production of cartoons from start to finish, from sketchbook to the silver screen. Between the mid-1930s and its brief, forced demise in the mid-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1990s, Soiuzmul'tfirm produced more than 1,500 films. Drawing on my own substantial collection and other archives, this study examines a large number of the films in considerable detail to discover what on earth a Soviet cartoon was (and is), since it could apparently survive with equal success under both communism and capitalism. Some of the studio's governing body today is made of the former Soviet Union's finest (most elderly) animators, who bequeath both artistic and technical advice to willing neophytes. Those youngsters, in turn, work now on Soviet cartoon shows for children that have remained popular, such as \"The Jolly Roundabout\" (Veselaia karusel'), which began under Brezhnev in 1969. Soiuzmul'tfil'm has just established a website dedicated to this and other achievements; here it invites the graduates of today's colleges in Russia to \"make their contribution towards preserving the wonderful traditions of Russian animation.\" Politics come and go, but talking animals, evil witches, and mythical princesses have endured. What was the relation of this wonderful tradition to politics in the Soviet Union, and what did Soiuzmul'tfil'm find in that grim dogmatic atmosphere that might warrant salvation by a post-Soviet state in 1999? A major socialist art form is surely inviting us to reconsider the nature of Soviet culture per se. This book attempts such reconsiderations and hypothesizes that socialist animation between 1936 and 1999 was a fundamentally emotional, not wordy, propagandistic enterprise. One could argue that emotional art in a dictatorial society serves merely to naturalize the status quo, and in support of this, one could refer to examples of Stalinist cinematic jollity such as \"Volga-Volga,\" \"Circus,\" or slapstick, romantic comedy like \"The Happy-Go-Lucky Guys\" (1934). The person responsible for musical mirth here was Isaak Dunaevskii, the Jewish Ukrainian composer from Stalinist Russia in whose name a television award would be instituted in 2000. Although his movie-songs may often have been commissioned by the state, they were very frequently apolitical in emphasis, always happy and genuinely popular. Even, in other words, if they were \"supposed\" to be political, they were neither written nor received on those terms. When, for example, Dunaevskii worked with lyricist Vasilii LebedevKumach on \"The Happy-Go-Lucky Guys\" (Veselye rebiata), the initial song of a lone, romantic mountain shepherd with his shabby livestock was only gradually commandeered for increasingly political means. The private story first became a big choral arrangement at the film's denouement and then fell victim to even grander processes in society. Verses on the Communist Youth League and the need for repelling an anonymous enemy transformed the song into something less than charming; it was used at Kremlin presentations and Soviet diplomatic\n\nxii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nfunctions in London three years later.1 Although Dunaevskii's colleague could very easily pen allegiant bluster, such as the song \"Holy War\" (Sviashchennaia voina) of 1941, it is here that non-ideological emotion is being courted by politics. Soviet doctrinal songs acquiesce before or employ the sentiment of non-Soviet (i.e., apolitical) scenarios. Heartfelt popularity is prior to successful politics. Nonetheless, music books and the Internet today preserve only the fully political version of this text that grew slowly away from its original, music-hall context, a shepherd's love story and Ijis very private affection for a disenfranchised chambermaid.2 The time of Veselye rebiata could be defined as a period when sung politics in cinema began to make use of popularity in earnest. That, however, was only possible because initial, incipient socialist entertainment had previously been notable for music-hall celebrities, for personalities singing enduring, old-style songs. In fact, the early professional Soviet songs had all first appeared on the small stage.3 The same necessary interplay of political intent and public desires was just as evident in the parallel world of book publishing. The Soviet authorities knew perfectly well which books the public did want to read. Initially, during the 19203, and then again from the sixties onwards, official studies were conducted into readers' tastes and desires.4 Later, when the authorities, after decades of paper shortages, acquiesced and offered desired volumes in exchange for pulping unwanted texts, those most precious authors became immediately evident in select lists: nineteenth-century Russian classics, Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Kipling, Verne, and Hugo. Among factual titles, the public wanted The ABC of Gardening, Advice for Market Gardeners, andThe Popular Encyclopedia of Medicine. Exciting adventure, romance, and fruitful domesticity appeared uppermost.5 These tensions - the problems and forms of social balance - are a key part of our study and are well formulated in the following observation: In the history of Soviet publishing, the interplay and tension between four sets of interests is a dominating theme. There is, firstly, the [mere] conviction of the Communist Party and Soviet government that the content and circulation of printed matter in the USSR should be controlled by means of ideological guidelines, administrative supervision and the censorship apparatus. Secondly, there are economic considerations, which favor an efficiently operating industry, the optimum use of limited resources and the minimum recourse to subsidies. Thirdly, there is the strength of professional commitment among many - not all - publishing house staff and authors, and their desire for a[n apolitical] reputation among their colleagues and readers which rests on more than officially-inspired commendation. Finally, there are the\n\nxiii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nvariegated and shifting concerns of the huge Soviet reading public, its influence stemming from the freedom, however limited, to read one book rather than another ... Soviet publishing takes serious account of its readers' interests and preferences'?\n\nThis degree of freedom does not leave politics in a position to naturalize or colour the status quo with surefire humour or guaranteed success; in fact, Western scholars of animation like Michael O'Pray and Kristin Thompson have proposed that institutions characterize cartoons' potential for transformation through amusement as trivial only in order to safeguard their own aspirations to stasis and conservatism.7 Amusement here is not naturalizing the status quo; it is being misrepresented in order to belittle the subversive, authentically humorous ability of cartoons to outdo and overshoot governmental forms of social change. \"Mere\" amusement shelters the uncanny nature of an art form that unnerves dogma, because - as Robyn Ferrell has written on cartoons (via Freud and Cixous) - the artistically uncanny is \"never the same twice.\"8 Dogma and its plans are - and can only ever be - intent, employing the differing tools of fear and persuasion hopefully to craft an overlap between political intentions and actual abilities. Fear is hardly an aspect of selling stories or movie tickets, and so unavoidably dogma must instead try to be persuasive, employing \"amusement\" with difficulty as it goes. Katerina Clark, whose classic study of ideologically driven Soviet art considers the supposed synonymy between policy and print shops, likewise admits that it \"is not sufficient to demonstrate how, over time, official values have been imposed upon literature, since these official values have themselves been culturally determined.\"9The question we therefore need to ask ourselves is this: Which culture made official values what they are? Since any doctrine is in essence only an attempt to impose meaning and cannot guarantee its receipt by any audience on the terms it intends, it must know, anticipate, and pander to the fickle, sentimental, or often funny patterns of public demand. Vera Dunham's study of concessions made to a massive socialist reading public includes additional information that tends us away from equating ideology with freely chosen cultural practices of the public. Take, for example, this definition of how much trouble the state had being loud and doctrinal after World War Two: Stalinist heroism \"clashed with the people's mourning. Although attempted by orthodox writers, the restoration of the cliches of the thirties did not work. For one thing, the pronouns balked. Too much had happened in Soviet society to permit large retroactive movements, even in middlebrow fiction. For many reasons, the first pronoun singular would not give way, so the creation of the postwar public hero became a problem.\"10\n\nxiv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDuring the war itself things were just as tricky for the state in the realm of enduring or convincing art forms. At this time there was a request that gramophone records be handed in, broken or not, for the war effort, since an unnamed element in the vinyl was needed for some mysterious process of great benefit to the nation. Nevertheless, a number of popular musical artists constituted a \"Diamond Fund,\" whose records were neither to be broken nor handed in. Such records were stamped \"Not for Exchange.\" The passionate singer of gypsy romances Vadim Kozin was, initially, the only person on that list; later the authorities added Izabella lur'eva (more romances), Leonid Utesov (big-band jazz), Lidiia Ruslanova (folk songs), and Klavdiia Shul'zhenko (waltzes and tangos). A new Kozin release would cost five smashed records, plus a bribe to the sales staff. People would buy boring records - such as dogmatic political speeches - in order to shatter them immediately at the counter and guarantee a new Kozin record.11 Stalin loved the work of these performers. He felt a public need to be fearful, but his private tastes were radically different. Stalin would dispatch cars late at night to collect the petite lur'eva (but not her husband) for private performances. In the pitch-black corridors of the Kremlin he would then tell her: \"Izabella, you can sing whatever you want, any kind of gypsy nonsense. Just don't do any Soviet songs!\"12 This was a matter of emotion rather than of an illicit affair, since bandleader and storyteller Leonid Utesov was given the same loving treatment. The following anecdote, recalled by the film director Leonid Mariagin, shows well that the songsmith floated between contradictory political influences.13 Humour once again unnerves institutional doctrine. I [Utesov] was walking along one afternoon, when coming towards me on the opposite sidewalk there's [head of the State Radio Committee] Platon Kerzhentsev, the same guy who closed down the Meierkhol'd Theatre and sent everybody packing. He sees me and stops. Points to me and calls me over. \"Listen, Utesov,\" he says. \"I've been told that yesterday, against my orders, you performed that [semi-criminal] song 'Little Lemons' again, plus 'From an Odessa Lock-up.' You're playing with fire! Things aren't the way they used to be. If I hear about your stubbornness one more time, you'll lose the right to perform altogether. Maybe that's not the only thing you'll lose ...\" And off he went. The next day we were working in a collective concert at the Kremlin in honour of some military academy's graduation ceremony. Well, anyway, we played the foxtrot \"Over the Waves,\" [and] I sang [the folkish] \"Mead and Moorland.\" Then the curtain closes and my guys start gathering their instruments. The MC comes up in a vaguely military uniform and says: \"Hold on! Play 'Little Lemons' and 'Odessa Lock-up ...'\" I shrugged my shoulders: \"I'm not allowed to sing that stuff.\" \"But he asked for them,\" says the MC and points\n\nxv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nover his shoulder into the auditorium. I look through a hole in the curtain and there's Stalin, sitting with the cadets. We went back on stage, played through our entire program. The cadets loved it and \"him with the moustache\" clapped along with the beat, too. That evening I'm walking along ... and Kerzhentsev comes towards me. I don't wait for him to call me over. I go right up to him and say that I didn't do what he ordered, 'cos I played today exactly what he'd forbidden. Kerzhentsev turned pale: \"What do you mean, 'didn't do what I ordered,' if I've already forbidden it?\" \"I couldn't turn down a request from the audience,\" I said in a despondent, guilty sort of way. \"Who couldn't you refuse, if I already said you can't sing it?\" \"Stalin,\" I said. Kerzhentsev turned around and minced off down the street as fast as possible. I never saw him again.14\n\nAnother version of this story, maybe embellished, has Stalin asking for the utterly non-patriotic, excitingly criminal song \"Odessa Lockup\" three times in a row and singing along the entire time.'5 In tales such as these we see why politics would want and try to use this positive, socially non-committal emotion. It would be the necessary element in any attempt at persuasive naturalization, but emotion is prior to language or speech (es), as evinced by any baby shaking with the passionate desire to utter a coherent, convincing command. It is, to quote Freud, the \"oceanic feeling\" of selfless union with others that has much in common with the (pre-dogmatic, romantic) goals of socialism, but little in common with intolerant, exclusive ideology. Emotion (as sentiment) is eternally forgiving, altering, and inclusive; dogma, on the other hand, employs emotion to proffer increasingly exclusive and prejudicial notions, to plot the increasingly relentless progression of some grand narrative. Soviet animation enacts this inclusive sense of union through decreasing recourse to words. These cartoons have tiny screenplays, often no text whatsoever. They are visually, more than verbally, active. If they are ever to be called propagandistic, it cannot be on linguistic grounds. They do not include explicit expressions of political language, speeches, or other proclamations, as were sometimes stitched into the fabric of socialist realist novels. Cartoons are the sentimental, if not mawkish, force of inclusion of which any political system dreams. As we will see, these films and their characters speak and act in radical advocacy of joining an amusing, eternally inclusive (and therefore eternally changing) realm that suggests kinship with all of nature (or at least all mankind) more than it suggests the exclusive, pragmatic, and progressive notions of one nation or one class. Surely the time has come to assess several aspects of Soviet culture according to two new benchmarks: what did people really enjoy, and\n\nxvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndid those moody preferences operate in a manner often independent of - not necessarily opposed to - the linear workings of Soviet dogma?16 Preference and enjoyment per se, with their inclinations and leanings towards something (s), tend to ignore linearity, all for the following reason: at the root of preference and liking is affect, a term employed throughout this book and usually defined as the demonstrative aspect of emotion - as \"doing\" a feeling. Affect means being open to and using emotional influence. Consequently, it is a force of some description, one that both precedes the person who is about to speak or be affected (s/he draws upon it) and outlasts the time s/he actually spends leaving an emotional imprint on (or view of) the world for others. In broad terms, \"power-relations are the [basic kind of] differential relations which determine affects.\"17 By implication, therefore, the power behind affect is greater than both emotion per se (since this power admits, bears, or conditions the emotion) and the person who senses it; it is greater than the subjective self usually associated with (introspective) emotion or sentiment. It is a supra- or prepersonal state, one of manifold \"becomings that spill over beyond whoever lives through them.\"18 It is drawn upon and dispatched, recalled, and released. In the influential \"active discharge of emotion ... affects are projectiles, just like weapons ... There is a relation between the affect and the weapon, as witnessed not only in mythology, but also in the chanson de geste, and the chivalric novel or novel of courtly love. Weapons are affects and affects weapons.\"19 It indeed requires little effort, for example, to find such forward, froward emotions in Don Quixote, whose chivalric transformations and attacks upon the world are surely spurred on by grand tales and a big heart. The contest between emotions becomes a battle to coerce or influence the world. \"I follow the narrow path of knight-errantry ... I have redressed injuries, righted wrongs, punished insolences, vanquished giants and crushed monsters. / am in love.\"20 It is easy to see how love overlaps with the language of Muscovite doctrine, of the \"Friendship of Peoples\" (Druzhba narodov) or other such exclusionary nonsense masquerading as inclusive, forgiving sentiment. The heroes of our loving, big-hearted cartoons use love and related weapons to enact a better, more natural, and ever-metamorphic form of socialism that slips through the fingers of conservative politics, which is aiming for the immobility and stasis that mark the modus operandi of guaranteed imperial space. The love of Soviet cartoons even sidesteps exclusionary notions of \"better\" or more desirable aesthetics. We may evaluate artists such as lurii Norshtein, highlighted in this book, as one of Russia's better artists, a man with a different\n\nxvii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nKot Leopol'd (\"Leopold the Cat,\" 11 films between 1975 and 1987), A. Reznikov. The world-weary hero shown making his nationally famous request that people and animals live in peace.\n\nart-house bag of tricks, but these distinctions are made neither by the Soviet public nor by the artist himself. Norshtein has spent the best part of his career working at Soiuzmul'tfiTm, the home of considerably sillier labours. Western criticism, as a result of the attention of many prestigious festivals, views Norshtein apart. That is not so in Russia, even today, as shown by the broadcasts of animation en masse on all television stations. Maudlin metaphors of family and togetherness are still working hard to deny animation all intolerant notions of hierarchy, centre, or periphery. This book shows the success of that tolerant worldview since World War Two, and does so with extensive reference to representations of animation in the Soviet mass media. Since we in the West assume a constant solid parallel between policy and art in the USSR, we would perhaps not pay much serious attention to erstwhile newspapers and magazines from the world's biggest country. Surely, they, as publications subject to censorship, are mere organs of ideology? No, they are not. They frequently advocate the different forms of social cohesion (and do so with relative freedom) that I suggest above, the socialism done better and in constant avoidance of conservative immobility. Even the press cannot be totally co-opted into policy.\n\nxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGiven the profoundly maudlin nature of Disney's work in the West over this same confusing period, we then need to ask: Were Soviet cartoons, if not essentially political, in fact trying to keep pace with developments in Hollywood rather than Moscow? The answer will surprise many of us, accustomed to equating funny films with doctrinaire fustian anywhere east of Berlin. I suggest that the skills needed to acquire a socialist oceanic feeling were sometimes learned from the prudish, big-hearted (and moderate!) aesthetics of Disney's studio. In order to position Russian cartoons between California and the Kremlin, we nonetheless have to define the relationship of mermaids, garrulous rabbits, and wizened wizards to the official aesthetic theory of the Soviet Union, socialist realism. How real, for example, were tales of medieval magic and mystery? I organize our examination of this tricky question under headings or issues inherent in the production of any cartoon at Soiuzmm\"tfiTm. Each issue is given an entire chapter: realism, originality, humour, and music. All of these real (or unreal) emphases allow us to suggest that animation was so successful in mapping the huge empty domain between Marx and Disney that it in fact came to represent and promote a different type of socialist selfhood, a new type of protagonist and person. These novel heroes of Soviet cartoons were massively popular across the biggest country in the world for decades, but have garnered no scholarly attention. The resulting philosophy of a nascent, very different type of Marxist subjectivity was so conspicuously widespread that I was prompted to look for analogous philosophical tendencies elsewhere in Europe and found them in phenomenology. The study commences with a chapter investigating the common ground between phenomenology and socialism. Here we find 1,500 stories huddled on the edge of politics and ethics, charming hundreds of millions of people for years - under both Stalin and Putin - in a manner that will surely dissuade us from (as usual) associating politics and culture, even in the nastiest ideological weather. It is high time we afforded some dignity and selfdetermination to the people who made Soviet culture, rather than emphasizing or prejudicing the crude political processes that hoped to claim that culture as their own. The most famous hero in this modest, witty stand against dogma was (and remains) a little furry creature called Cheburashka who came to Russia by accident in a box of typical marketplace oranges. One renowned animator, who no doubt shopped at such markets, claimed that his country's cartoons challenged the semantics of doctrine not only with Cheburashka, but also with their potential to create equally convincing and even stranger \"yellow crocodiles or blue oranges.\" As\n\nxix\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsoon as we remember that Cheburashka's best friend was himself a (green) crocodile who felt well dressed in a jacket but no pants, we sense a need to investigate those boxes of gaudy fruit, to discover the provenance of fuzzy, profoundly Soviet fauna, the true colour of halfnaked socialist crocodiles, and then ask how \"real\" any of them could hope to be.\n\nxx\n\nPart One\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST STATUS OF THE ANIMATED EPOCHE\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOVIET ANIMATION AN ANOMALY?

Soviet animation, I propose, was not an anomaly, but was busy with ideas and practices that are, to our surprise, indicative of a widespread multiplicity in Soviet culture, hidden or simplified for decades by Cold War oratory. In other words, regardless of what the Communist Party said, its cultural arbiters were actually doing something else. I will try to show exactly what that was, but we must reach a point where we ask if anywhere else in world culture of this period, even beyond Hollywood, there were similar philosophical trends, operating outside of dictatorial constraints and able to develop, express, or formulate themselves in a way of use to us. Did anybody write down (i.e., express in words) what Soiuzmul'tnTm was doing in pictures and then follow rigorously the logical passage of their thought?\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST S T A T U S OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHS\n\nWe can answer in the positive by turning our attention towards Western phenomenology, towards the loosely grouped thinkers who followed in the footsteps of Husserl. Here, not terribly far from the lands of socialism and at precisely the same time, there developed a worldview that spoke of exactly what we will see throughout the history of cartoons or animated drawings in the Soviet Union. Phenomenology is an excellent place to look for enlightening parallels to the philosophy of socialist animated cinema, since it, too, attempted to look beyond ideology or the logocentric workings of any dogma. The history of phenomenology shows us a path that dialectical materialism, from its idealist Hegelian roots, could (and should) have taken in order to discover more about consciousness (which we will show as social) and emotional social essences (which we will show as pre- or extra-linguistic). The supra- or extra-linguistic centre of that social existence is the body, the home of the big heart. This story, from the initial reflective investigation (Husserl's epoche) to social, sentient bodies (Merleau-Ponty), charts the increasing significance of \"being-in-the-world\" (etre au monde) made and recorded by the movement out into that world or as an ek-sistence. By looking at various aspects of what happens to physicality in Soviet animation, we will gain a much richer view of East European realism and the sense of \"being-there\" (Da-sein) amid phenomena rather than just sitting at home, viewing that culture through the two opaque prisms of Englishlanguage and Soviet rhetoric. After all, philosophers such as Heidegger and Sartre were freely employed by Russian commentators to find what lies inside, not outside, of dogma. This is neither subversion nor dissidence, but the unfolding of Soviet realism's discomforting, potentially apolitical multiplicity, which becomes clearer still when we look at how the supposedly censured press spoke of cartoons: \"Finally today, when the process of release from totalitarian thinking is underway, issues of [Soviet] philosophy can be decided in the context of universally human culture. It's no good behaving like an ostrich, hiding your head in the sand at the first sight of things unknown or unusual!\"1 THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL CONTEXT: W H A T E X A C T L Y IS IT?\n\nPhenomenology has been notoriously difficult to define as a unified school of thought since its conception by Husserl. Definitions tend from transcendentalism to an investigation of tangible, ostensible existence, from epistemological issues to those ontological. There is at least common agreement among its exponents that philosophers must turn from supposedly objective science and the objects of scientific\n\n4\n\nIS THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOVIET A N I M A T I O N AN A N O M A L Y ?\n\ninquiry to their meaning in that ostensible existence. How, in other words, is \"being-in-the-world\" done as an activity? (Here already is the key parallel that we will be drawing with our animators.) Kant appears as a logical point of origin in his use of \"phenomenology\" to define the manner in which things appear to us or are given sense. The other famous use of the term can be attributed to Hegel; in fact, Husserl's work led both to a resurgence in Hegelian studies and to another reason why we might find parallels between phenomenology and official Soviet wisdom. Hence we will be examining the meaning of things or, more precisely, the way they are given significance, an issue I have touched upon in the foreword. Any act of intending or meaning needs an object; that act has a secondary stage, too, in which the intender or affecter always becomes aware of him- or herself: I feel that I am feeling. In concentrating upon the manner (s) in which visualized things exist or depend for meaningful existence upon cognitive activity (seeing, hearing, feeling, touching), we will maybe see the true, essential structure that objects have for us. Husserl saw any investigation of the busy world based upon downto-earth assumptions, upon standards, pre-existing beliefs, policies, or rationality, as an undiscriminating interaction with one's surroundings. When the phenomenologist begins to muse upon objects \"philosophically,\" s/he excludes all unquestioning, established stances. This exclusion or suspension Husserl called the phenomenological epoche, a process of estrangement, perhaps a reflective investigation of intentions and their objects. Preconceived worldviews and overarching philosophies and ideologies must therefore initially be rejected in the epoche. Only then might one investigate what exactly it is within consciousness that allows consciousness to refer to objects outside itself. The origin of acts of intention or meaning is the ego. The epocheeffecting ego is made over time in a way that not only dissolves partially into the immediate past and present, but also into an objective realm of things. Every act of, for example, imagining is imagination of something. \"The point, for Husserl, is that, disregarding whether or not the object of the act exists, it has meaning and a mode of being for consciousness, it is a meaningful correlate of the conscious act ... Sometimes phenomenology's emphasis on the mutual belonging of the notions of subjectivity and objectivity is expressed as an overcoming of the subject-object divide ... Instead of proceeding to an ontological account of the res cogitans as a thinking substance as Descartes himself did, one can focus on the intentional structure which Husserl describes as ego-cogitatio-cogitatum, the self, its acts of consciousness, and its objective correlate. We have overcome the subject-object divide by\n\n5\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST S T A T U S OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHE\n\nfinding a deeper meaning within subjectivity itself.\"2 We are unpacking or unfolding the sentient subject, wedged among objects. That meaning, as I suggest, does not contradict ideology; it lies both within and beyond it. Phenomenology does not deny the existence of material phenomena; it merely posits them as \"phenomenal occurrences\" of objects with acts of intending. Things exist as they occur to us, an aphoristic truism that leads us to admit, perhaps, the primacy of intuiting over the things we intuit. \"Whether I am imagining or perceiving, if I disregard the veridical claims of the act (i.e., whether it gives me true knowledge about the world), I can at least be certain that I am engaging in an act of consciousness and that the act, together with its contents just in the manner in which they appear, is given absolutely.\"3 Things, after all, are things when they matter to me in some way. My relationship to the material world is affective. P H E N O M E N O L O G Y AFTER BEING SOCIAL\n\nHUSSERL:\n\nThis type of eternally reflexive subjectivity does not lend itself to clear, goal-oriented development, and it is therefore not surprising that by the time progressive revolution was brewing in Russia at the end of the twentieth century's first decade, Husserl was rejecting modernist historicism per se and calling for a return to spirituality. It was Heidegger who subsequently tried to put the suspiciously solipsistic, idealist tendencies of Husserl's late work back into society, among everybody and everything else, \"over there.\" In doing so, Heidegger stressed the element of choice in intuiting meaning; he drew upon Kierkegaardian notions of anxiety to show how fear reveals the troubling (yet exciting) possibility of selfhood in the threatening, anchorless multiplicity of the outside world. The givenness of that world \"in\" which one finds oneself comes from being as if \"in\" trouble or \"in\" love; the nature of one's existence therefore comes from being consciously \"response-able\" to it. This newer view of contemporary selfhood in the world sounded clearly in the subsequent work of Gadamer, for example, who went as far as to claim that the very verb verstehen (\"to understand\") also means to \"stand in\" for a person, to place oneself elsewhere so that a vital \"dialectic [may] be retrieved in hermeneutics.\" Hannah Arendt, expressing her debt to Heidegger, saw an analogous tricky placing of oneself elsewhere in terms of hard work or labour as a refashioning of key Marxist notions. Her convictions recall my study of late twentieth-century light entertainment, where I looked at Jean-Francois Lyotard's observations on birth and history, on the problems of private biography and public (grand) narratives. There I showed how the\n\n6\n\nIS THE P H I L O S O P H Y OF S O V I E T A N I M A T I O N AN A N O M A L Y ?\n\nSoviet traditions of wantonly aimless, multigeneric creative work in jazz and popular song saved (and save) young neophytes from a sense of being either post-historical or constrained by historicism. Hardearned, physically taxing humility amid the canons or history of others is what makes selfhood. In a similar fashion, Arendt claimed that birth (biographical novelty) is merely the creation of possible action. Work, as subsequently chosen acts, is then communally creative by understanding, by being conscious of and \"standing in\" for others: \"Action, no matter what its specific content, always establishes relationships and therefore has an inherent tendency to force open all limitations and cut across all boundaries.\"4 Work creates a social world for others outside me (as yet unborn); it is willing to accept the unknown potential of the future and is fuelled by that potential. Although it is in the present, work is posited elsewhere and among others, as Arendt wrote in Amor Mundi of the closely related, equally problematic power of acceptance or forgiving, of abandoning long-standing suppositions and judgments in a spin upon Husserl's thoughts concerning preepoche conventional worldviews. If the worst ideas and deeds of the past are forgiven, they lose consequence and are undone. If I am charitably open to the potential truth and validity of all acts and all times, then even history (itself a process of enduring judgment and selection) dissolves with me in it.5 The epoche is now posited as a carte blanche or laborious removal of exclusionary worldviews in order that something inclusive is ushered in. It is perhaps in Levinas that we find phenomenology's most quotable spokesperson for the role of inclusive selfhood as other people, places, or alterity, moving even beyond the discernment of others to one's concrete responsibility before them. In a vein similar to Arendt's nonjudgmental, open-armed forgiveness, Levinas welcomes the intrusion of the other and writes of \"welcoming that other as hospitality; [because] in it the idea of infinity is consummated.\"6 The distance from here to friendship (druzhba [narodov]) or love is very short and recalls the use of medieval writings on affect by Julia Kristeva to place the self ideally elsewhere, in the Dasein of love: ego affectus est. HUSSERL + =\n\nSARTRE AND\n\nSOCIALISM MERLEAU-PONTY\n\nIn the work of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty we find the greatest overlap between phenomenology and Marxism; Sartre and Merleau-Ponty also, it seems fair to say, are better known in Russia than any of the other members of this loosely defined school. By 1937 in The Transcendence of the Ego, Sartre voiced his (rather tardy) doubt regarding\n\n7\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST STATUS OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHS\n\nHusserl's founding notions by claiming that the epoche can never be totally complete, because admitting consciousness does in fact mean admitting the reality of things in the world. Subjectivity is both ongoing and in the world; it comes perhaps from interaction more than from isolated, solipsistic self-awareness. The \"no-thing-ness\" of consciousness needs always to choose within the world that it move towards being \"some-thing\" (which in actuality we may never attain). Sartre turns Heidegger's Dasein into a frustrating, endlessly social or dialogic understanding of non-standard intersubjectivity as Mitsein. Merleau-Ponty's early readings were perhaps an even stronger expression of the inclusively social nature of human beings, to the point where he was able to claim Hegel as the first real existentialist influence in his life, in the sense that Hegel married the dialectic of human interaction with that of history. The Frenchman praised Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit as an attempt \"to recapture a total sense of history, describing the inner workings of the body social.\"7 That body social is seen by Merleau-Ponty quite literally; it consists of both an \"inside\" and a place where the outside world stops or penetrates. The body in this role as membrane fills with sensory thought, a prescientific pensee sauvage. For Merleau-Ponty, the epoche takes us beyond Arendt, back to I'etre sauvage of pre-reflective, pre-ideological being. His appeals to open, desirous, and never-ending systems led to an approving employment of his philosophy by Deleuze; even Deleuze's arch-enemy Lacan sought and saw help in Merleau-Ponty for studies of the unconscious. THE\n\nMATTER\n\nOF \"TOTAL EXPERIENCE\":\n\nIS SPINOZA, THE\n\nNOT\n\nHEGEL,\n\nPERHAPS\n\nSOCIALIST KIN OF PHENOMENOLOGY?\n\nAs I look for alternatives to (or variations upon) a Hegelian tradition, all in a way that allows me to fashion a continuation of prior work with Deleuze, the reputation of Spinoza's materialism in the USSR also suggests itself as a bridge between 1917 and 1968, maybe between Husserl and Sartre.8 Spinozistic ideas certainly lack the necessary negativity of Hegelianism and are therefore driven not by dialectic but by immense inclusion that rejects the dialectical opposition of subject and object. Spinoza would allow for a transfer of East European emphases upon social existence and (marketable) production to a Deleuzian, neoMarxist understanding of production. Since human beings in such a scheme are public or sauvage - and naturally so - before they are private, Spinoza's forces of production foster a type of apparent antihumanism to the point where \"Nature = Industry = History.\"9\n\n8\n\nIS THE P H I L O S O P H Y OF SOVIET A N I M A T I O N AN A N O M A L Y ?\n\nSubsuming Spinoza into the orthodox Marxist tradition is (and was) entirely possible.10 He managed to neatly sidestep the nastiness of Dutch mercantile existence (and therefore future Soviet criticism) through sympathy for the apolitical mysticism of spiritual groups such as the Mennonites and the Collegiants.11 This deft avoidance of bourgeois influence led to the Soviet definition of Spinoza in 1936 as \"Marx without a beard\"!12 Even Stalin himself, four years later, would concur with Spinoza and a core tenet of this book that \"nature is a connected and integral whole, in which things and phenomena are organically connected with, dependant on and determined by each other.\"13 Despite such an apparently productive and parallel approach, things are a little different (and easier) when we look at the leftist, yet equally \"connected,\" social or natural patterns of late phenomenologists like Sartre. The Frenchman held that emotions and emotional behaviour are a manner of acting upon oneself when reasonable, practical options fail. Those acts transform a person's world, but in doing so negate the same (standard) world because it is felt to be logically unmanageable. Actively drawing upon Heidegger's more socially active notions of \"being\" as interactive verstehen, Sartre added to this idea of potentially negative world-negating emotion the assertion that feeling is an ineluctable, integral part of consciousness, because every perception is accompanied by an affective reaction. \"Consciousness is a desirous consciousness. Objects of perception are at the same time objects of concern; they 'affect' us actually or potentially, hence we have feelings about them.\"14 Emotion therefore perhaps reorders the established world more than it negates it, a la Husserl. Let us consider the following helpful and elucidating example from a Sartrean scholar: I have just witnessed a terrible accident. There seems nothing I can do to help the victims. Overwhelmed by sorrow for them, I begin to cry. I tend to be emotional in situations like this. But - after all — I am a grown man and people mustn't see me in this state. I must get hold of myself. I fight back the tears and finally regain my composure. I get back in my car and drive on. If we subject this example to a Sartrean analysis, we note, first of all, a shift from the unreflective to the reflective. At first I cry, then I start thinking about my behaviour. The statement, \"There seems nothing I can do ...\" is revealing: if I had been able to spring to the aid of the victims, I would not have been crying. The emotional response is chosen because the situation is too difficult to permit an instrumental response. Then I begin to reflect upon how I will look to others; the fact that I am able to reflect at all shows that the emotional spell is broken - that is, that I have been able to shift my attention from the \"cause\" of the emotion to my reaction to it. If I were capable of on-the-spot purifying reflection, that would be the end of the emotion. But I am only on\n\n9\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST STATUS OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHE\n\nthe level of impure reflection, for which I am in a \"state\" of emotion to be combated. The \"cause\" of the emotion is no longer the terrible accident; it is now \"I who tend to be emotional and who have just witnessed a terrible accident.\" By an effort of will I succeed in mastering my emotion. This means, for purifying reflection, that the situation is no longer regarded as too difficult and that there is, in consequence, a new intention or choice - the choice of reflective and rational or pragmatic means. The struggle between the emotions and the will is thus a deception. There is always choice, recognized or unrecognized ... Once again, therefore, we are brought back to Sartre's fundamental notion that emotion represents one means of achieving an aim, a means chosen when other means (instrumental-rational-voluntary) offer no prospect of success. If the will appears to win this struggle with emotion, this means only that the situation which provoked the emotion is no longer evaluated as too difficult to be dealt with by instrumental or rational means.'5\n\nWithin the Soviet context, that choice takes on a clearly moral aspect in defining the nature of social relationships.16 The philosophy of this kind of interaction, as we are slowly seeing, came to Russia more from France than from Germany and brought, consequently, a greater emphasis upon the body as barometer of experience than upon anything idealist or, to quote fellow Frenchman Mikel Dufrenne, \"the Romanticism of the profound.\"17 Movement towards shared corporeal experience lies outside the linear metaphors of social progression, but within the non-linear paradigms of social existence, \"not a mere intention toward but a participation with.\"18 Emotions go many places as they \"participate,\" yet travel nowhere in particular. They result from an expressiveness of will, \"the need to overcome\" or cancel a given obstacle, prompting analogies in the Soviet tradition with refereed \"norms\" or conventional ways of doing things in the world of sport:19 \"The mind engages in equipping felt needs with the ways and means of satisfying emotions, in accordance with the norms historically present in the given community.\" 20 The heart finds, overcomes, and transforms. It is in these conjoined realms of emotions and received normalcy that we can compare the transformational potential of phenomenology and Marxism, since both philosophies are concerned \"with the world of total experience as it exists for us. Both can and do utter the same pronouncement: 'to the things themselves.' Both seek to enunciate, on the theoretical and individual level, the hidden or alienated meanings of the experiences found in nai've, everyday life.\"21 Both Marx and Husserl concentrate upon how the essence of a thing (commodity) appears to us anew after a form of radical reduction or bracketing.22 \"If we make an abstraction from use-value, we make\n\n10\n\nIS THE P H I L O S O P H Y OF S O V I E T A N I M A T I O N AN A N O M A L Y ?\n\nabstraction at the same time from the material elements and shapes that make a product a use-value; we see in it no longer a table, house yarn, or any other useful thing. Its existence as a material thing is put out of sight.\"*?1 SO WHY NOT\n\nDID\n\nMARXISM\n\nTOLERATE PHENOMENOLOGY?\n\nThe process of selfhood's ultimate or \"full\" formation moves a little differently in phenomenology, leading to the limited tolerance by later, institutionalized (i.e., dogmatic) Marxism for Husserl et al., criticizing the Western school as non-historical, subjectivist epistemology.24 Seemingly only in the igGos did this bad-tempered scepticism lessen.25 When late Soviet philosophers began showing how a penchant for Husserl would lead them (happily) in the direction of Solov'ev's spirituality or Shestov's existential irrationalism, maybe orthodox Marxism proved that it had been right to be so standoffish. Other kindred spirits came under tardy fire in the seventies. MerleauPonty was accused of \"various kinds of anti-dialectical and metaphysical notions.\" The Frenchman was criticized for bracketing psychology and logic as woefully dogmatic; his admiration for Shestov's mentors, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, was also declared suspect. The entire enterprise of these men was deemed excessively introspective and isolationist. \"An artist's subjectivity becomes genuine subjectivity when he rejects anarchy and free will. Having then comprehended the objective laws of development of nature, society, and thought, he expresses them through his [proper, tempered] vision of the world, experience, and such, through his personal attitude toward reality. Only then is the subjective a concentrated expression of the objective, an attainment of it, and cognition of the laws of its development.\"26 \"Anarchy,\" as we will see, is the supremely social working of desire. \"Free will\" is the choice - made under tremendous duress! - to fashion an emotional worldview amid the rigours of quotidian existence. Both materialism and phenomenological existentialism - despite discrepancies - offer a view that comprehends or wills to choose and change the world; both juxtapose the unchosen \"thrownness\" of social existence with a more natural levelled state; both balance \"a partial determinism, which is dominated and enhanced by freedom\"; both assume that man acts in a dialectic with the resistance or obstacles of objects.27 Both the Marxist and the phenomenological notions of subjectivity have more in common than orthodoxy would care to admit. The one major problem, however, in the context of this study, is that because Marxist consciousness is made and matured in history, emotions\n\n11\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST STATUS OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHS\n\n(especially Sartrean anxiety) should \"never be the essential element of [dogmatic] ontology.\"28 Sartre sits somewhere in the middle of these extremes, in between Marx and (only) me, Hegel and Kierkegaard, the objective and the subjective. \"Thus we see that in the Sartrean interpretation, a Marxist position parallels that of Kierkegaard in its attempt to rescue the existential from the Hegelian Idea, yet repudiates Kierkegaard and rejoins Hegel in eliminating the overemphasis of Kierkegaard upon the subjective and defending the objective. For Marx it is the concrete individual in his world who matters, the man who works, needs food, and must live. Marxism thus makes room for both Kierkegaard's 'specificity of human existence' and Hegel's 'concrete man in his objective reality.'\"29 We could perhaps find a kindred, profoundly Russian middle ground, sometimes reminiscent of sentimental or loving realism, in Dostoevskii's early Orthodoxy - circa Netochka Nezvanova - rather than in orthodox Marxism.30 Dostoevskii's orthodoxy recalls aspects of Heidegger's \"moral glue\" or care for the world (Sorge), an individual responsibility for collectives. That responsibility is to recognize others' freedom as a prerequisite to one's own (since this is not the solitary, atomistic, and \"bourgeois\" notion of liberty).31 Bringing East and West even closer, one could say that Sartre embraces a responsible social (ist) form of dialectical freedom, in that the negation of the world via reflexive emotion recognizes a type of lack. When that lack becomes a need (for one to fill it), the negation is itself negated; what began as a phenomenology of consciousness becomes a philosophy of potentially socialist praxis.32 That philosophy, in the words of Sartre himself, would be a humanism to take us \"beyond ourselves, in [to] the circle of men.\" It is a demand for love. Here, perhaps, is a truly kind realism, the initially spoken enterprise that love embraces and finishes, being excessively social (ist) and crowning lack with union.\n\nCONCLUSION: MARXISM AND PHENOMENOLOGY WERE SIMILAR ENOUGH TO TREAT EACH OTHER WITH GREAT SUSPICION Both Marxism and phenomenology share a (rarely compared) dialectical essence that reduces our view(s) of subjectivity in order that we understand mfer-subjectivity.33 As even Husserl said, \"In whatever way we may be conscious of the world as universal horizon, as coherent universe of existing objects, we, each T-the-man' and all of us together, belong to the world as living with one another in the world; and the world is our world, valid for our consciousness as existing precisely through this 'living together.'\"34 Such assurances, however, did little to break the\n\n12\n\nIS THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOVIET A N I M A T I O N AN ANOMALY?\n\nritual silence over the (non) discussion of Husserl in Soviet philosophical publications. As we will see in our next chapter, an overview of phenomenology wholly within Russia, it was the duo of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty who were afforded more space on the Soviet printed page, because Soviet academia held that at least their phenomenology became existentialism as a consequence of worsening social relations in the West. Both Frenchmen experienced and criticized the horrors of capitalist society. This is to some degree both a shame and a surprise because of the healthy and promising contact that had existed between Russia and German phenomenology prior to the Revolution via Shestov, Solov'ev, Shpet, and Jakobson.35 The following pages are an attempt to show that irrespective of ideological intrusions or obfuscation, there are fruitful, telling parallels to be drawn between the evolution of orthodox Marxism and phenomenology's frosty reception inside the Soviet Union. Was the tradition of Husserl really seen as nothing more than \"subjective idealism, the separation of the subject and the world [in which] the former is rendered helpless to do more than to understand, to interpret, to know, but not to change the latter\"?36 Was it often denounced as totally, \"ineliminably subjective\"? Any answers to the contrary will permit me to show phenomenology not only as a mute, unuttered aspect of socialist thought, but also as a fitting worldview for Soviet animation, a rarely linguistic, primarily visual form of introspective and affective expression in a materialist society that sometimes showed itself to be horribly, crudely social.\n\n13\n\n2 CARTOGRAPHY: MAPPING THE STATUS OF PHENOMENOLOGY IN THE SOVIET UNION Take the straight and narrow path And if you start to slide, give a little whistle And always let conscience be your guide.

We will be focusing upon Husserl and Heidegger from the days of the early school, followed by Sartre to represent the shift towards existential emphases. Passing reference will be made to Arendt, Levinas, and Merleau-Ponty, as before, and to Derrida. Husserlian thought saw little space in the Soviet press until the late Thaw or early Stagnation under Brezhnev, when it was criticized as remedial in its social awareness, as having mishandled the \"problem of selfhood and creative activity.\"1 Phenomenology per se in the seventies came fairly\n\nCARTOGRAPHY\n\noften under attack for audacious attempts at \"different socialist endeavours, a critical Marxism.\"2 Work of the eighties tried to rehabilitate similar critics or related anti-orthodox stances, such as the ahistoricism of consciousness outside of dogmatic notions of objective societal progress.3 These attempts bore some fruit after planting roots of moral fibre in disciplines like pedagogy, concerned for example with the employment of rhythmic music and \"musical essences\" in the socialization of children while simultaneously respecting the structures of logic and morality.4 The (novel!) idea that phenomenology was potentially related to \"essences\" of moral or edifying consequence soon led scholars back unwittingly - to the type of spiritual (or mystically patriotic) emphases of Solov'ev from before the Revolution. \"Back to things themselves\" became \"back to pre-socialist values,\" albeit in a way that moral criteria were often presented in a culturally non-specific light that would meet with considerable assent in almost any political climate. The ahistoricism of phenomenological consciousness began again to sound like the elements of Dostoevskii with which Sartre concurred. \"The classical world and Russian artistic tradition can be opposed to the debasing and self-destructive nature of man, to the exploitation and primitive, lowly feelings we encounter in conditions of aggressive mercantile liberalism. The Russian tradition, if followed, guarantees the preservation of an 'unconscious spirituality,' together with notions of vertically structured values - those of high and low, absolute and relative.\"5 Let us now take a look at this passage from Husserl to Sartre in the land of Dostoevskii.\n\nHUSSERL: ESSENTIAL PRAXIS OR ANTISOCIAL INTROSPECTION? Perhaps not surprisingly, when Husserl was initially discussed in Soviet academic quarters during the sixties, he came under fire for doing little more than treading a familiar line of idealism. The central opposition of Husserlian thought - consciousness and the world - had supposedly already found \"adequate resolution\" in the more active and historically grounded workings of dialectical materialism.6 Husserl was sometimes forgiven his \"ideological distortions and absolutizing\" theories when he wrote of intuition, a \"universal human ability,\"7 but in essence the broad application of a human intuitive potential inside and outside of logic or dogma was troubling to the state. Intuition was not defined in opposition to dialectical materialism, but was seen to be somehow operating in and then beyond its boundaries. Intuition and subjective experience were therefore held in the seventies to be\n\n*5\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST STATUS OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHS\n\nlacking any clearly edifying, dialectic function and were politely declined as 'just one intermediary stage in the process of creating any scientific theory.\"8 Allegedly missing in Husserl's philosophy were the outside world and the \"movement of social-historical praxis. \"9 It made claims to the objectivity of social experience but in actual fact was fundamentally solipsistic and subjective.10 In the nineties, therefore, these barely suffered elements of subjectivity returned happily to the forefront of academic attention and were celebrated to the detriment of philosophies with which the Soviets had enjoyed easier relations.11 Notions of intersubjectivity, however, were shifted away from ostensible society and flourished in talk of things transcendental, \"the foundation of the subject's existence amid things.\"12 Ingarden's Introduction to the Phenomenology of Edmund Husserl was published in 1997, and his critique of the philosopher's \"lack of interest in this world\" took on a new meaning in a modern Russia, where \"this world\" was perhaps now too ugly to warrant great or affectionate attention. Husserl came back, therefore, in the spirit of his original work and times as the twentieth century ended, to the point where academics entered into direct dialogue with their late colleagues, the pre-revolutionary Slavic scholars, who were accused of not having done Husserl's work justice in the atmosphere of \"superficiality and generalizations\" of the time/3 To a large degree we can conclude that attitudes towards Husserl reflected (and were shaped by) socio-political changes in Russia. If we are looking for a constant in phenomenology before, during, and after the Soviet period, Husserl falls a little short, despite some hopeful, fleeting nods in the direction of intuitive practices. Let us try Heidegger instead, and see if either Soviet dogma or the philosopher's dalliance with national socialism spoils our search for an overlap or middle ground between dialectical materialism and idealist solipsism.\n\nHEIDEGGER: FASCIST OR CHAMPION or FREE SOCIAL BEING?\n\nSerious consideration of Heidegger began in the early seventies against the backdrop of a slow, simultaneous acceptance of psychoanalysis. Aspects of subconscious thought were perceived in his work, but he was upbraided for separating them from necessarily conscious processes, as they are \"mutually interactive aspects of [anybody's] unified thought.\"14 Towards the middle of the decade, that division was seen in terms of a split between introspective and outward-looking existence, between the self and society. Heidegger's work noted social forces of estrangement that Western imperialism had employed to\n\n16\n\nCARTOGRAPHY\n\nstifle \"the creative strengths of selfhood,\" but his findings, like those of Husserl, had shied away from a Marxist-Leninist application of such oppositions to a properly \"progressive\" dialectic.15 Progression in this case had been delayed by Heidegger's supposed irrationalism and agnosticism.1Agnosticism here was understood in rather secular terms as some adogmatic stance and therefore in contravention of Lenin's belief that \"partyless ideology\" or philosophy is an oxymoron.1\" By the late seventies Heidegger's philosophy was being equated not only with Nietzschean nihilism,18 but more specifically with a total absence of ideology that soon became an absence of morals, leading in turn to the logical consequence of amorality — \"loneliness and hopelessness.'\"9 That sense of loneliness was born of excessive analogies between selfhood and a transcendental realm, which could only result in some kind of impractical \"meta-philosophical, meta-anthropological reality.\"20 Socialist critics also had no problems equating the supposedly vacuous, amorphous realm of the transcendent with Sartre's (recently explicated) nothingness. To pass through Heidegger, they said, was to move into mental illness. \"Over and above the phenomenological method and irrational doctrine of Heidegger and Sartre, the existential psychoanalysts have rejected any specific methods of studying psychic phenomena. The influence of external surroundings and physiological processes upon human consciousness remains outside their attention. Consciousness for them has begun to produce the entire world; neuroses and psychoses have been interpreted as the result of the patient's 'free choice.'\"21 As the Soviet Union passed away in the early i QQOS, the difficulty of discussing Heidegger in prior decades was admitted - the awkward tension between highlighting his \"moments of [social] value\" while downplaying any connection with fascism.22 As with Husserl, Heidegger began to be published tentatively,23 and a \"sharp rise\" in interest in him was noted at this time, together with discussion of frequent parallels between Heidegger and the now-modish tendencies of pre-igiy Russian thought. The German's criticisms of technology's powers found many sympathetic ears as the awful price of failed Soviet modernism was revealed in the press and documentary films.24 Studies of how Heidegger's work related to the slightly less palatable Husserl were soon in print,25 which helped at least to ease the former out of Soviet stereotypes and into a pan-European tradition, at times into \"the most important movements and tendencies of twentiethcentury philosophy.\"26 Finally, when the rhetorical prejudices of Sovietese had been completely removed, Heidegger was placed in a phenomenological-existential framework. That, given his more \"social\" thought, led to an explication of dialogue between the self and something else,\n\n!?\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST S T A T U S OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHE\n\napart from massed human presence. Parallels sounded between Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and the self as a simultaneously recalled past and present. \"[Both Heidegger and Kierkegaard] try to find a certain point of support in the eternally sequential nature of time, one that will lead to Christianity's central notions of the 'fullness of time.' That fullness is 'an instant as eternity,' where the temporal is simultaneously both future and past. Thus an instant becomes doubly significant, 'in which time and eternity touch each other.'\"27 Heidegger therefore falls, like Husserl, a standard victim to the reasoning of Soviet philosophy, but once the nineties begin, he is less claimed by the spiritual renaissance of those championing, say, Solov'ev, than he is reinstated in a slightly more \"grounded\" tradition of social specificity. That grounding leads to this parallel with a Kierkegaardian dialectic of spirituality and ostensible reality, between the temporal and the eternal, the moment and a \"flow.\" Not surprisingly, as a result, we reach the conclusion that the more that concrete society (and not transcendental dialogism) is referenced in a philosopher's work, the more likely it is that the philosopher will survive as a proponent of a valid worldview both before and after 1991. Enter Sartre, whose work is seen and suffered in Soviet writings with much greater frequency than that of any orthodox phenomenologist. SARTRE: THE ASCENT TO A \"TWENTIETH-CENTURY CLASSIC\" We can begin an overview of Sartre in the Soviet Union immediately after World War Two, much earlier than with our German subjects. Early Russian writings concerned Sartre's literary endeavours and highlighted the incompatibility of postwar patriotism with the isolation of an existentialist subject. It plainly could not be believed, for example, that the partisans depicted in his oeuvre might experience \"tragic feelings of envy or offence.\" The Frenchman was showing the \"darkest sides of the human soul in places where they simply cannot exist!\"28 Here social ideals and selfhood were placed in the rather obscure framework of social struggle and socialism.29 Since these same review articles quote Stalin's henchman Zhdanov approvingly, it is perhaps logical that such a critical viewpoint would remain in place until the Thaw, when Sartre was suddenly advertised to the Soviet people as \"an intelligent, courageous, and unique writer.\"30 In 1956, for example, we read of Liubov' Orlova as Lizzie in Sartre's play The Respectful Prostitute. Here the heroine of brash Stalinist cinematic comedy found the type of drama that allowed her to slip from Stalinism into Krushchevian cultures with a courageous and unique\n\n18\n\nCARTOGRAPHY\n\nstate-sponsored refashioning of social existence. It was emotional. Orlova underlined by negative example the heroine's \"effort to respect people, the [elusive] ability to believe them, a desire to tear herself from the pit into which life has thrown her ... Orlova looks long and hard into the soul of an unhappy woman and emphasizes everything that makes her human.\"31 The real tour de force in Sartre's ascent, however, perhaps came in the early to mid-sixties whenever a few initial seeds of doubt were sown in Soviet society over new rosy-spectacled romanticism. An air of scepticism fell over the advocacy of emotions for their own sake, and an atmosphere of more objective consideration surrounded sentiment.32 The Frenchman's heroes enacted and echoed these doubts; they held back from world-negating emotional excess and did so in a context of \"unfulfilled love, unspoken hatred, admissions that are broken off halfway, intentions that don't become actions, or acts that never reach their goal.\"33 Whereas Heidegger's work was nowhere near being celebrated in an atmosphere of \"universally human culture,\" free of \"ostrich-like\" behaviour around matters unknown or unusual, Sartre's thought had been aiming for the status of universality and social applicability more than thirty years prior.34 By showing in an \"emotionless,\" dark manner the nature of an isolated hero, Sartre - oddly - became a champion of emotion's (absent, unfulfilled) validity.35 \"The path of the French intelligentsia was different to that of many Soviet citizens, but at the top of some hill or other their paths have converged ... Soviet people know how to respect a person who exists for mankind with all his big heart, with his brave, exciting intellect. That's why Sartre's progress is so important or interesting and understandable. That's why it's something to which we [in the USSR] are not indifferent.\"36 As the Thaw faded in the mid-sixties, Sartre's lot improved even more, as he became a man \"taking active part in all events leading to a better life and future for mankind, to the preservation of peace and mutual understanding between people.\"37 That type of pan-national, universally specific notion of socialization, though, initially troubled some nationalists, who continued to dismiss the Frenchman as a Western \"bourgeois anarchist.\"38 The sociology of materialism (which the Soviets saw as Sartre's ultimate concern), together with \"a phenomenological approach to personality,\" led to a type of sociology that was still a tad cerebral, abstract, and divorced from concrete, quotidian existence.39 Sartre was gradually divorced from enduring, albeit rare criticisms of Western \"hopeless modernists\" and sometimes even dubbed a 100 per cent realist, in the Soviet sense of the term.40 On good days he was seen as a proponent of a \"heterorganic alloy of ideas,\" of Hegelian\n\n!9\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST S T A T U S OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHE\n\ndialectic plus existentialism (i.e., \"the possibility of human freedom in the framework of historical necessity\").41 On bad days, in the early seventies, straggling conservative criticisms of Sartre were heard as a consequence of his (or any) subjective enriching of an alreadyendorsed social idea. Here the same old grounds for fault-finding were mapped out: \"real historic contexts\" in his work were occasionally felt to be lacking.42 The emotional negation of those contexts, when problematic, was infrequently - and not surprisingly - seen as a rejection rather than as a refashioning of the world.43 Although the unmasking of \"social and moral hypocrisy, uppermost in bourgeois society\"44 was itself a laudable endeavour, the slightly violent heritage of Paris's May Revolution also troubled some cultural observers, given the unruly aspect of its Trotskyite or Maoist leanings. \"Sartre criticizes capitalist society, but doesn't see genuine socialism. Rejecting capitalism, he doesn't see any alternatives in the nations that are building socialism.\"45 Let us not dwell, however, upon the increasingly uncommon critiques, but look at what exactly under Brezhnev was being offered as the reason to accept Sartre and shy away from Husserl. \"In Husserl's eidos we see the summary of an experiment already underway: the spiritual and intellectual acquisition of the world. In Sartre's qualities and symbols of existence there is an embodiment of the past, a spiritual-emotional acquisition of reality. The subject's past emotional experience is laid upon the material world, forming a 'layer of significances.' The existential psychoanalytic is committed to deciphering them.\"46 By the mid-seventies things looked even better - or at least more tolerant. Although Sartre stood outside of fully-fledged materialist historicism, his views were nonetheless praised in high places as \"strongest of all in the area of introspective analysis, of personality's inner world.\"47 There emerged a new dispute between exponents of similar views and those who now saw his work as overextending the (mass) social validity of analysing small-scale social relationships48 or - conversely - who felt his personal pessimism as out of place in the workshop of national projects.49 Some were worried that the Frenchman saw in \"big\" society nothing more than \"attitudes of repression, violence, levelling, and so forth towards the individual.\"50 Gradually, as the eighties began, the two attitudes converged as Sartre's own thinking was shown to be both necessarily and healthily dialogic. Any one of his ideas, came the claim, \"will neither be closed in upon itself nor monologic, for it joins the thought of others. It [always] joins a path of contrary thought ... and is therefore internally dialogic.\"51 There was also frequent dialogue over the type and title of Sartre's humanism. It protested against \"bourgeois conformist ideology and\n\n20\n\nCARTOGRAPHY\n\nfetishist representation\"52 but seemed to be persistently - despite Sartre's overt lack of sentimentality - troublingly \"anarchic and romantic\"! Emotion here was sought and advocated by some as the marvellous glue of future society, while others still worried about the subversively transformational power of feelings.53 These respected but worrying thoughts from the Frenchman were published and permissible into the nineties, and here we see the true value of Sartre in Russian culture. The concepts of estrangement discussed in Soviet times were precisely those discussed during the post-Soviet years.54 In both periods his deconstruction of social relations is evidently valid; in both periods it enjoys respect. The only difference is one of reception or context: the so-called introspective emotional aspects of his philosophy have now found slightly kinder acceptance. \"The philosophy of Sartre and Camus reflects the state of modern society's moral decline. These thinkers have managed to uncover man's internal world and his relation to the external world through a prism of subjectivity. They show the causes of estrangement as well as possible paths towards overcoming it.\"55 By the mid-nineties, Sartre's Soviet significance was clearer still. Researchers decided in retrospect that he had always stood face to face with the monologic aspects of totalitarian thought, be it socialist or capitalist, stolid systems that \"overcome the depths of a man's soul, forcing him to make painful compromises.\" Phenomenology offered means to defend that internal world with alternative aspects of modern thought.56 Sartre had turned to socialism as a man upset by the totalitarian aspects of market forces, but found neither in Paris nor Moscow the true essence of interactivity.57 Troubled by \"prudishness and vulgarity,\" he had sought instead a timeless, truer realm of intimate human relations.58 He made social relations human. So how did Sartre go about that search, in Russian eyes? Some critics in recent times have declared him a master of intricate, intimate praxis;59 others discern a man struggling gracelessly to do anything in the narrow framework of \"old French culture, sullied by the psychology and idealism\" of Catholicism.60 We sense here a new, post-Soviet adversary to his existentialism - neo-Orthodox Christianity - but even religious or morally vigorous thought today sees the value of Sartre's worldview in preserving the rarely spoken of, the rarely uttered or ineffable, aspects of binary oppositions that ideologies happily admit, but to which they will not grant equal opposing weight. Sartre and his kindred spirit Dufrenne are men who went as true socialists back to things themselves, and in materiality they revealed a stubborn duplicity. The two men are today lauded as philosophers who have represented \"a return to the sources, to the true bases of existence, to the\n\n21\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST S T A T U S OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHS\n\nsyncretization and profundity of worldly knowledge. They are a return to joy, to the happiness of experiencing the world vivaciously, to what is both spoken and unspoken in the world, to both the typical or evident and the unexpected or unbelievable, to both the physical and the spiritual.\"61 Publications of Sartre have multiplied,62 and the man is now deemed a \"twentieth-century classic,\" balancing \"the contradictions of existence, the problems of struggle between good and evil.\"63 Researchers now declare again that he was committed to dialogic, balanced, and eternally multiplying ideas. He denounced social planning and therefore — as Freud — became something of a pariah, surrounded by \"the distrust of his own family, poverty, the prejudices of bourgeois [or socialist!] society.\"64 As a consequence, Russian writers suggest that a Sartrean \"grand freedom\" cannot but observe and breach society's desires or laws at the same time. \"For a cardinal change in its image, one [society] must transpose oneself into a totally new environment, such that the vaulted ceilings of prior laws melt away for it [or Sartre], like evaporating steam.\"65 With Sartre, we live in but beyond society, in a force of potential freedom embodied in alternative, fundamentally non-dogmatic social bonds. Those bonds are the essence of animation's philosophy in the Soviet Union, hence my extended promotion of phenomenology as an initial, introductory guide to their modus operandi. P H E N O M E N O L O G YI S THE\n\nOTHER\n\nSOVIET\n\nREALISM\n\nIn a recent republication of Husserl's \"Origin of Geometry\" (Nachalo geometrii), Russia's search for different social bonds within socialism was reassessed with great perspicacity as an \"unhappy affair between Russo-Soviet-Neorussian philosophy and phenomenology that has already dragged on for a whole century.\"66 More than one author has suggested that the Soviet standoffishness was due to the uncomfortable similarities between the two philosophies that I am proposing in this methodological introduction. One is obliged to admit that the source of the Soviet state's rejection lay not in the differences but in the similarities of dialectical materialism and phenomenology, irrespective of how poorly or superficially they were presented to readers. Each of these complex philosophies of human formation has a single goal: a strictly and genuinely scientific, conclusive basis for a science itself, one of knowledge and human activity. Both affirmed that they are acquiring or will acquire an absolute truth. Both considered themselves ultimate\n\n22\n\nCARTOGRAPHY\n\nworldviews, which rob all consequent systems of both sense and raison d'etre. Both had a revolutionary program but were guarded or conservative in practice. Both made an uneasy peace with other philosophies, despite the declared dialecticism of the former and the open, anti-systematic pronouncements of the latter ... Both [dialectical materialism and the phenomenology of Husserl] demanded development and change in a single, originating theory. Nonetheless they both in practice developed according to a path of synthesis, divergence, reconsideration, and dissent. In other words, they both realized their dialectical and open-minded aspects only retrospectively. To put things simply, it would be difficult to ask of dialectical materialism, at one time the reigning philosophy, that it allow its double to sit beside it, especially a double with exactly the same [and simultaneous] pretensions towards an absolute.67\n\nWhat we see is the convincing assertion that dialectial materialism and phenomenology, despite their occasional scrappiness (and the rather sad representation here of the latter), often had a lot in common. We also see that despite the inherent conservatism of Marxist and Husserlian worldviews, a slow, yet eventually healthy process of divergence, reconsideration, and dissent led to the increased flexibility and dialectical development of both. The flexibility of the ideologically driven art of Marxism will thus be examined in this book as a consideration — via animation — of key elements in Soviet socialist realism: how it was done and precisely what aspects of reality it was referencing or making. Those changes (or oft-ignored aspects) in realism are inherent in synchronous aspects of the phenomenology that was Marxism's constantly shunned double. Just, however, as Marxism grounded Hegelian thought or inverted Hegel's idealist emphasis to deal instead with socio-economic realia, so — as we have seen in this chapter - idealist Husserlian thought had a rough ride in Soviet academia. The more socially specific and emotionally concrete work of Sartre shows accurately the shadowy flipside of Marxist thought that we need for this book, the other type of reality - and the other, emotional realism. In precisely the same way, the so-called idealist introspective or solipsistic elements of lyrical cartoons were always tempered or grounded with a civic element. Phenomenology shows why the social element was so inherent in private expression or being; it is a matter of existence, not of Soviet ideology. Were this book totally dedicated to phenomenology in the Soviet Union, it would make sense to move even beyond Sartre to MerleauPonty, who both brought Husserl's thought into France and moved beyond an emphasis on matters transcendental, even beyond Heidegger's and Sartre's social accents, to the feeling sensate body within that society. In emphasizing - as Soviet graphic art - the fleshy minimal\n\n23\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST S T A T U S OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHE\n\nunit from which society is composed, he took a step away from universal, absolutizing thought. Husserlian intersubjectivity - or, come to that, the Marxist equivalent - becomes here corporeity and a deft step sideward, away from dogmatism. Merleau-Ponty's work may have unnerved some during Brezhnev's term,68 but as we come closer to the present, his ideas concerning the body as both creator and recipient of meaning have met with much favour in a context of post-Soviet materialism. Here, to be rigorous with our argument, Merleau-Ponty and Freud are often equated as kindred concluding spirits of the phenomenological enterprise in Eastern Europe. I wrote in my book on El'dar Riazanov's comic cinema that Freud's \"oceanic feeling\" of selfless social existence was a strange, passionately desired facet of socialism, one rarely acknowledged. The Frenchman and the Viennese doctor are in fact now often conflated in contemporary Russian philosophy as men who investigated the body and its feelings as \"simultaneously mobile foundations [of meaning], points of [semantic] support, and the bearer of human life.\"69 Cartoons and puppets offer us the same sentient vital corpus. I also showed in my work on Freud how emotion was a key mediator in Soviet society, but it is hardly ever accredited as such. In turning to Merleau-Ponty, we see that by moving the body around (or watching affect move it), we enter not only a post-Husserlian, \"grounded\" form of phenomenology but also, perhaps, the embryonic stage of any culture. Soviet culture, if bracketed as in animation to the point of a colourful little epoche or essential core of \"social-ism,\" is the contact and mutual recognition of two sensible sentimental bodies. \"A human, cultural world emerges at the moment when a system of 'I-the-Other' comes together. This is the moment when an internal relation appears between my consciousness/body and 'an other.' It occurs when 'the other' comes forth not as a 'fragment of the world,' but as a vision of the world and the bearer of behaviour. The body of that 'other' is the quintessential cultural object.\"70 In cartoons we see it undergoing sentimental socialization, away from standardized, humourless rhetoric. The attractiveness of this kind of smaller socio-cultural model or kernel is especially understandable in Russia, where other thinkers, such as Hannah Arendt, have made perfectly clear to Slavic readers the troubling parallels between universal grand theories, such as Soviet and German totalitarianism.71 \"Her star is rising here in Russia,\" we hear today.72 In shying away from anything on an imperial scale, we find ourselves once more in the realm of Levinas and his work on the fundamental status of an other. Through his assertion that acceptance\n\n24\n\nCARTOGRAPHY\n\nof a responsibility towards the otherness of the other is the key to love, we can hazard extending a bridge from Merleau-Ponty into an open alternative realm of wide terrene significance. Levinas - in publications for the Russian public - held that in the one \"other\" we encounter not only a typical human but also all humans, and even God. In the Slavic context this has been seen as \"a type of 'connection' between our existence and that other [tot], who [like any other] is on the far side of this world.\"73 Ethics, diplomacy, and spirituality merge in the interaction and reaction of bodies, where even the incompatibility of another person takes on a potentially positive (dialectical) significance for the subject.74 Opposites are incorporated, not rejected; they are included, not excluded. A\n\nCLOSING WORD\n\nON AN\n\nENDLESS\n\nENTERPRISE\n\nThus we finish an overview of how and why major phenomenological thinkers were (and remain) vitally important to the expression of a profoundly social philosophy on the edges of a doctrine known in the USSR (somewhat arrogantly) as socialism. Given that with Sartre, Merleau-Ponty et al. we have stepped away from both political rhetoric and the grand designs to which it (or even early phenomenology) aspired, it seems logical to conclude this introduction with a word or two about the status of Derrida in Russia at the tail end of phenomenological endeavours, as he heralded the core problems of any language of thought and sensation that lead us into noises, rhythm, light, and colour. In Russia Derrida's work has been interpreted as a specific prompting to investigate the frustrating \"expressibility\" of that which simply must be expressed (somehow) .75 Russian commentators saw the cancelling out of fustian - or its pretensions to rhetorical universality by using deconstruction - as similar in several ways to the negations of Hegelian dialectics.76 Maybe this would prompt an interior language? Through cancellations of prior spoken meaning and constant celebrations (or at least a release) of things \"unexpressed,\" deconstructivism in Russia would perhaps even move from consideration of the \"apophatic to the apocalyptic,\" that is, from the advocacy of the ineffable amid dogma to a point of crisis once dogma had gone. Nonetheless, that troublingly apocalyptic tone has been countered by what some Russians see as Derrida's positive anticipation of a non-dogmatic unpredictability. \"The desolate, 'emptied' landscape of deconstructivism's messianic air seems to promise nothing apart from 'total surprise,' the possibility of the impossible. Maybe, however, it is in considering an [endless, happy] openness to the future that deconstructivism finds its designation?\"77\n\n25\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIALIST S T A T U S OF THE A N I M A T E D EPOCHS\n\nAs a man who began his career studying Husserl, Derrida came quickly to address the early totalizing suppositions of phenomenological metaphysics, to question the idea of complete meaning per se. The constant and eternally relative slippage or glissage of significance has taken its place, maybe for no other reason than that meaning is forever contextually dependent.78 Big ideas fall humbly and unavoidably silent. Russian commentators of Derrida note that as the Frenchman shied away from Freud's searches for full \"dictatorial\" meaning, he discovered nothing more than the presence of absence, a multitude of linguistic speculations.79 In my book on Russian cinematic comedy, I showed how this kind of unutterable emptiness was filled - with difficulty and with constant ever-novel attempts — by mawkish, humorous Soviet screenplays. In that study I added a chapter on the importance of close-ups. They served in Soviet romantic comedy to show visually, through shot/reverse shot and continuity editing, the eventual (very briefly) metaphorical make-up of selfhood that always slips away in the metonymical lack of (any) wordy screenplays. There were good reasons in that study for stressing the linguistic foundation or genesis of Soviet kinokomedii, but here our task will be very different. We will move from a long-winded foundation to a fully-fledged pictorial project. Since I have already demonstrated the importance of emotion in the expression of Soviet existence (via Freud's status in the USSR), the task here will be to examine what lies beyond words or slips away in the glissage exacerbated by polities' emotionally barren and insistent language. Marxist visual art, as animation, was the province of that examination; it crafted notions that socialism did not (or simply could not) say, but to which that same ideology often had no loud or dangerous objection. Phenomenology tells us what this visual art, the display of consciousness, was up to. It shows us, in its explication of socializing bodies among objects, the other aspect of socialist endeavour. As a consequence of these surprising and fruitful parallels, the Marxist and phenomenological notions of social subjectivity were (and remain) almost too close for comfort. Both worldviews purported to understand and guide individuals; both contrasted the thrownness of social existence with a more natural uniform state of all people; both posited \"a partial determinism, which is [nonetheless] dominated and enhanced by freedom\"; and both assumed the active individual to be in a positively dialectical relationship with the resistance or givenness of objects. Animation is made of those objects; it shows the individual as, among, affecting (or being affected), and altering things, and therefore reveals the essence or lost potential of a social dogma, one\n\n26\n\nCARTOGRAPHY\n\ncalcified in cliched bravado and bluster. There is a very good reason why Soviet cartoons tried so hard to be so reticent, humble, and happy. When they succeeded in doing so, as we will see via Deleuze in later pages, they were so perfectly social that even the assumed, stable, and conscious corporeal subject of the phenomenological epoche would dissolve.\n\n27\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPart Two\n\nTHE PROVENANCE OF ANIMATED PHENOMENOLOGY\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n3 SEVERAL PARADOXES OF SOVIET REALISM AND DISNEY'S UNEXPECTED ALTERNATIVE Are we on our way to Devonshire, to Lancashire, to Woostershire?

In justifying this approach, we must focus upon responses to the films within the USSR, hence the increasing emphasis across this monograph upon Soviet mass media and journalistic work in both promoting and assessing cartoons. To ignore the Russian responses to Russian films would lead us simply to the imposition of our own culturally specific theories from afar. We need to show that - despite dogma - even the supposedly censured and censorious media of Russian newspapers and magazines celebrated and saw Soviet cartoons in a way that is both within and broader than socialist doctrine. These periodicals show the radical overachievement of cartoons' worldview in a manner that suggests phenomenology, not the Kremlin,\n\nTHE PROVENANCE OF ANIMATED PHENOMENOLOGY\n\nas a guide to animation's goals. The emotionally driven, inclusive, and apolitical (or at least pre-political) emphases of Soviet animation, as I proposed in the foreword, came perhaps as much from Disney as they did from anything indigenous. As Ronald Holloway has also suggested, \"in the Soviet Union, Walt Disney's influence lasted the longest.\"1 Having therefore proffered one prism - existentialist phenomenology - through which to view the supra-national, if not \"ecological\" notions of membership in the world (Daseiri), I now in this chapter propose another - Hollywood - which shows itself to be an oddly kindred spirit. Here we see how America helped to foster a socialist art form. I aim in this chapter to do no more than outline some obvious formal strategies in the work of artists in Moscow, Florida, and Los Angeles. The reason for doing so is, on the heels of our philosophical prologues, to suggest how the tempered (if not prudish) employment of sentiment in Disney's work (as an inherent function of capitalist or postwar American society) was drawn upon. Disney unconsciously fuelled a profound, sincere, and wider-reaching notion of kinship that could do double (and better) duty in the Soviet Union. Frequent and more concrete reference to the American's influence in socialist cartoons is made in subsequent chapters, so we can see such observations contextualized in the press. In this chapter I suggest only likely paths of investigation and places of formal coincidence. Before we turn to Mickey Mouse, let us first consider the Soviet state of affairs. As with all other modes of state-sponsored artistic enterprise, animation was considered part and parcel of Soviet socialist realism. Here I also offer an introduction to the official Soviet aesthetic, so that we will later be able to see how animated cinema both overlapped with and differed from it. Soviet realism was born in the late spring of 1932, together with the Union of Soviet Writers; it was the offspring of an engineered harmony between politics and art, especially after the first Writers' Congress in 1934. During this initial period a five-person leadership committee to oversee realist theory was appointed by the Politburo and guided by Stalin himself. Soviet realism was supposedly the logical culmination of Russia's socially responsible and admirably \"critical\" Golden Age (the realist masters of the nineteenth century), while simultaneously addressing the demands of the present and the desires of the future.
