It creates that space inside and looks great on the outside. And the sailing performance for a production catamaran … is very very good.\n\nWhen we arrived in Les Sables-d’Olonne John had this rockstar entrance… surreal does not even begin to describe how it felt.”\n\n” – Aaron and Lara Jones – Lagoon 42, Sabella\n\nLagoon 42, Bilby\n\n“A big tick to TMG… They’ve been fantastic with their support, if we’ve had any issues we get in touch with them and they go out of their way to help us so they’ve made buying this boat in Europe such a pleasant experience and yeah, I’ll give them a 10 out of 10, it’s been great… If you’re going to buy a Lagoon buy it from TMG.\n\n” – Liz and Rob – Lagoon 42, Bilby\n\nAntics on the Flybridge\n\n“It’s very very easy, so much space, we just had 4 couples for 5 days, it was very chilled out and relaxed.\n\nThe flybridge is such a big beautiful place with a view, its elevated and we put permanent clears around ours so you can use it anytime, day or night, windy or raining, it doesn’t matter. You can sit up there have lunch, have dinner. We call it the first class lounge, you can’t go wrong.” – Anthony and Seryn Ryan – Lagoon 630MY, Antics\n\nLatest Pickup In France – The World Carries On\n\nThese Lagoon 40 owners recently took delivery, “We decided to stick to our schedule and pick up our Lagoon 40 in Les Sables-d’Olonne in early March despite the uncertainty surrounding the current worldwide pandemic and the lockdown in France (curfew in France is 7 pm).”\n\nJadean – Sailing The World With Children\n\nThe incredible story of a young family that left Cape Town, South Africa to sail the world… It has been the biggest adventure of our lives. We say it is a “bucket list adventure being checked off one experience at a time”.\n\nLagoon 42 Owner Review\n\n“I couldn’t fault the TMG network and what we were able to do and how everyone was easy to get on with. The actual handover period… was fantastic. We sat on the boat for the first day and went through everything. It was a great learning experience, and then out sailing the next day. Making sure everything worked properly. It was a fantastic thing to do and I can’t speak highly enough about that actual process.” Paul Brown – Lagoon 42\n\nHappy Lagoon 46 owners\n\n“So excited to have finally taken delivery of our Lagoon 46 in Manly, Queensland yesterday. Rowan McMahon from TMG took us on a windy delivery trip up from the Gold Coast yesterday with lots of smiles onboard. Very happy with our clears, solar arch, Weber BBQ platform and tender setup. We can’t thank TMG enough for their support in getting Arena ready for our family sailing adventures.” – Dean Robertson, Lagoon 46 Owner.\n\nLagoon 400S2, Espresso\n\n“We love our Lagoon, we’ve been out in some pretty tough conditions and it’s always brought us home safe, it’s fantastic under sail and great at anchor so we absolutely love our boat.\n\nOur favourite thing about our boat is the places it can take us, we get to see a lot of the east coast that most people can only imagine to see and to be able to access it with a boat it’s just fantastic.” – Matt Doncan – Lagoon 400S2, Espresso\n\nLagoon 440, Blue Pointer\n\n“Greg and Sue Harding created and monitor the Lagooned in Oz Facebook Community and are vital and enthusiastic Lagoon owners.\n\nThe pair have owned numerous Lagoons and love their current Lagoon 440. – Greg and Sue Harding” – Lagoon 440, Blue Pointer\n\nLagoon 52F, Infinity II\n\nThere is more enjoyment in a sailboat in that the enjoyment is in the journey as much as it’s in the destination. That to me makes it a totally different experience.\n\nThe advantage of a flybridge to me is the fact you are that much higher off the surface of the water, you can get better vision all around, a greater sense of being on-top of the whole thing and I do enjoy being out in the sun most of the time.” – Jeff D’Albora – Lagoon 52F, Infinity II\n\nLiving the dream single handed onboard 50ft Lagoon\n\nMark Rolle envisioned a life on the sea and when the opportunity presented itself he didn’t hold back.\n\nAfter working hard for years Mark sold his business and decided that there was more to life than work.

A European Launch Story\n\n“We looked around quite a bit, and investigated the opposition! The 42ft is the right size for us, and she has a good feel when under sail. The combination of layout and space was just what we were looking for. Importantly, the Lagoon 42 sails well short handed. The 42 is a very, very nice boat. I’d be hard pressed to fault it,” said Drew.\n\nWhy life is better lived on a Lagoon\n\nGreg and Sue Harding, owners of a magnificent Lagoon 440, Blue Pointer, are the first to admit they are Lagoon tragics. “Our love affair with Lagoon started from day one, even though our first Lagoon was really a project boat.”\n\nMoor RnR\n\nPaul Rogers is one of the founders of Lagooned in Oz “…the best thing about our lifestyle is not the boat or location, it’s the people.

For us it was finding a boat that would take us and all our possessions and our Lagoon does that. We live and sail in paradise! ” – David and Nerida Lee – Lagoon 380 Seabreeze\n\nTicketyboo delivered\n\n“The entire TMG team were really good. In the initial stages, John gave great advice and helped spec the boat, looking back it was all very valuable… From our first enquiry, through specification, order, to delivery and after-sales, TMG have been terrific to deal with. Ordering our Lagoon 40 was no small decision and a perfect delivery reassured us from the start,” Mike Pain.\n\nFall in love with the Flybridge\n\n“I love the air on the flybridge, the overview when going into anchorages, harbours etc. Its’ like standing on the bridge of my own little ship.” Says Martin.\n\nSailing Papua New Guinea with John Pruim\n\nThis is a story of an adventure taken onboard John Pruims 410.\n\nThis is the kind of adventure you could only experience on a boat of your own…\n\nLagoon 50 unbelievable upgrades with John Pruim\n\nForth time Lagoon owner John Pruim has just become the first Lagoon 50 owner in Australia!!!\n\nThis tech-savvy owner is all about making this boat the best of the best with all the latest in technology, see what upgrades he has onboard…\n\nCaribbean first impressions and hurricane plan\n\nPeter has just had his Lagoon 630MY shipped to the Caribbean after 3 years in the Mediterranean.\n\nHe is already loving the abundance of sea life, catching fish on every cruise and spotting turtles in the clear ocean.

I wanted it to feel like a home, like a floating apartment. I thought regarding the kids, on the 42 specifically, we can steer the boat from here on the same level, it’s not a separate area … and the entire thing can be enclosed without it being a visual and physical barrier,” said Lara.\n\nWaters Family Update\n\n‘Lagoons are perfect as a live-aboard option. They have plenty of room, everyone in the family has their own space. Tyler can be off in her room, Max on the trampoline burning off energy, Darren keeping on top of the maintenance. The boat never feels cramped,” says Kristy.\n\n“Living the dream” on board a Lagoon 380\n\nEvery day is magical when you’re living on board. Take this morning, for example … the water was like a millpond, delivering a special sunrise. This was the view from our cabin as we woke up. We chose the 380 for her spacious interior. She’s super easy to sail, well suited for the two of us to live and work on board comfortably and she has plenty of indoor and outdoor living areas,” Said owners, Justin and Kelly.\n\nLagoon 39, Zephyr\n\n“Ross was super – he went through everything.\n\nWe’ve never had that; going through everything was a huge positive.” – Graeme and Linda Hubbard – Lagoon 39, Zephyr\n\nAdèle 1\n\n“I think it’s a fascinating and great way to live … so many people put things off until retirement and then can’t achieve their dream when they get there.\n\nI’m happy with my choice.\n\nIt stretches you a bit and you juggle a lot of things, but with good people like the team at TMG, you can follow your dream.” – Drew Hakin, Adèle 1\n\nWonderful memories sailing Sabella\n\n“From our 6 months onboard, there are so many personal highlights. From a sailing and cruising perspective, I can hardly put our time in the Balearics into words. Formentera in particular, some of the anchorages there once the crowds had gone for the day were absolutely stunning. Seeing our young girls develop was something special.”\n\nA truly unique Sailaway adventure\n\nSteve is as passionate about Lagoon and Sailaway offers people access to a ‘wow factor’ as part of their holiday – “It’s in reach for people to enjoy a bit of that business class feel with their friends and family, in an everyday way. With the Lagoon, we can live out our passions for sailing, nature and the environment. I have had confidence in Lagoon from the moment I first stepped aboard.”\n\nCruising adventures onboard El Gato\n\n“The comfort is just amazing. When we were in rough seas sitting in the cockpit in the monohull, we could touch the water. But in the cat, you’re sitting on top of the flybridge – with 2m following seas – she’s solid, she’s stable, she’s just fantastic in the water,” said Lagoon 440 owners.\n\nSailing Sabella April Update\n\nLagoon 42 owner Aaron tells us “…living on Sabella is wonderful. Whilst much smaller than an Australian house, we each have our own space and it doesn’t feel cramped.”\n\nHome sweet home is a Lagoon 420\n\nBob and Margaret Kennedy have called their Lagoon 420 home for 6 years, “We thought it was terrific. In comparison, our other boat was ‘camping’, but this was ‘home’. We found a little-used boat in very good condition – we lucked out with the perfect boat.”\n\nThe Jones Family heads for warmer climates\n\n“There are so many wonderful memories from this short time at sea – sunsets, dolphins, peaceful night watches – this way of life is just spectacular and really feels right for our family. We pinch ourselves each day and wonder when we’ll wake up from the dream,” Lagoon 42 owners the Jones family.\n\nIs this the best Lagoon 450 ever?\n\nThis Lagoon 450F was Johns 3rd out of 4 Lagoons “You want to buy a production boat, built in a factory in series. You get a properly designed and built boat. Compared to other 40ft boats a 40ft Lagoon will have the most volume. A signature of Lagoon is its vertical windows. The advantages are you have ample headspace in the saloon, plenty of light and 360 degree views, whilst keeping the sun out.”\n\nThe Jones Family take delivery of their new 42\n\n“We’re in Les Sables-d’Olonne and we’re taking the boat out for a test sail and I’m floating on a cloud, I’ve got no idea what’s going on! It’s the most stunning day – in January no less! The weather was fine and the wind almost calm, but regardless she made 3 knots in 5 knots of breeze. What a clever little thing she is!”\n\nHAPPY DAYS ON ZEPHYR\n\n“As soon as we got onboard, we were sold— the sliding doors were brilliant, the big glass window right by the kitchen sink—it was just like an apartment,” said Lagoon 39 owners.\n\nPACIFIC HIGHLIGHTS WITH THE WATERS FAMILY\n\nWith only limited yachting experience between Darren and Kristy, their Lagoon 500 is fortunately “very user friendly and it was easy to pick up”. To anyone considering following their lead, Kristy is quite clear — “Do it!”\n\nDon McIntyre- A Lifetime of Global Adventure\n\nDon McIntyre, Global Adventurer and Explorer, Life in Tonga with his Lagoon 450, Golden Globe, Royal Yacht Club Nomuka. Don describes the boat as “perfect, fantastic, incredible”— this “is the most fun” and “living on-board is like an apartment on the water”.\n\nThe liveaboard life Lagoon style\n\nThe Atkinsons love their catamaran. They had the design in mind for 20 years, and even though they weren’t actively looking, when they saw the Lagoon 400, they found the exact layout they had been dreaming of.\n\nLAGOON 52F – HANDOVER COMPLETE!\n\nWorking with TMG was a positive experience for John and Tania, “the team were always on hand and did everything they could for them throughout the process,” said the Lagoon 52 owners.\n\nLagoon 42 modified for quadriplegic sailor\n\n‘When you’re in a wheelchair there’s a lot of places you never see or you can’t get to. They’re just not accessible. Yesterday when we were out we sailed past some of those places that I have never seen before,’ Cliff said. For many sailors the freedom of the sea is one of the attractions. For Cliff, it’s life changing.\n\nMEDIA REVIEWS\n\nPrestige M48 Yacht Tour & Boat Walkthrough\n\nWe Love Boating – July 2024\n\nOn this yacht tour & boat walkthrough, we take an in depth tour of the award winning PRESTIGE M48 power catamaran yacht.\n\nPRESTIGE F4 Boat Test\n\nClub Marine TV – December 2023\n\nPRESTIGE’s new F4 introduces a new aesthetic for external styling while raising the bar for finish and function.\n\nPRESTIGE M8 Boat Test\n\nClub Marine TV – November 2023\n\nIs the Prestige M8 the best thing to happen since power catamarans were first launched.
