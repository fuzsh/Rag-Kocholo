Premiere at Tribeca Film Festival 2016. The Oscar candidate of Slovenia 2017.\n\n“We met with the Rough Cut Service team in a rough cut stage of our feature-length project. The service was recommended to us by Hanka Kastelicova, HBO Europe. We were really satisfied with the cooperation, helping us to calibrate our compass and giving a fresh perspective and pumping up our little bit drained creative process. We even took two consulting cycles and production-wise it was one of the best investments in the production of the film. And we also like twisted and sometimes bizarre Finnish humor!”\n\nBostjan Virc, producer.\n\nFor The Love Of A Man by Rinku Kalsy (India 2015)\n\nIn South India, in Tamil Nadu a film star Rajinikanth is a God to hundreds of thousands of his fans.

Premiere at LA Film Festival 2016.\n\n“Having meaningful, productive, valuable access to some of the world’s greatest filmmakers and documentary editors is an incredible opportunity and is what Rough Cut Service delivers. RCS’s engagement with me, was solely focused on my film and my film’s needs around story, structure and the elements to take it from good to amazing. Skyping, chatting and exchanging ideas, notes and solutions with Iikka Vehkalahti and Jean Tsien is extraordinary and not only made the film better but made me better too.”\n\nDeborah Riley Draper, director.\n\nNoma by Pablo Pinedo (South Africa 2016)\n\nA documentary following the tradition of Italian neorealism follows the fight of shack dwellers against the brutal eviction. Premiere at Durban Film Festival 2016.\n\n“For me and the project the RCS was very helpful.

This is not the story of a Hollywood rom com, but an incredibly incisive refugee portrait by the Kurdish-Swedish filmmaker Hogir Hirori. Premiere at Gothenburg Film Festival 2016.\n\n“Before I contacted RCS I was in a very difficult place. I had so much material, a very complicated editing procedure and had a hard time choosing and prioritizing in the vast amount of material. Iikka and Per K. at RCS made me rethink, restructure and tell a story effectively, and shorten the film in a way that felt intuitive and natural.”\n\nHogir Hirori, director.\n\nFree by Tomislav Zaja (Croatia 2015)\n\nAn intimate documentary on people with intellectual disabilities released from institutions to live normal life among other people in Croatia.

Venice Film Week 2016 – Best Feature Documentary.\n\n“The experience of working with Rough Cut Service helped both me and my editor to see the film from new, fresh perspective and to discover new ways to tell the story – ways that were unimaginable to us before we started to work with experts from RCS. It was very inspirational to see my film from different angles and to analyse each scene and every single shot in detail. It helped me to get the distance from my footage and become more realistic about story structure and my main characters. So I can divide editing of my film in two very different phases – before I started to work with people from Rough Cut Service and after it.”\n\nTomislav Zaja, director.\n\nExodus- Where I Come From Is Disappearing by Hank Levine (Brazil, Germany 2017)\n\nIn six different countries shot documentary film on refugees, their lives and thoughts.

Premiere at MakeDox 2016. Awarded at South East European Film Festival LA.\n\n“RCS helped our film a lot . The days when I felt trapped with our film only with my editor became much more dynamic, I had to think it all over again and answer all the questions (even the weird ones) and try all the possibilities in editing I did not try until then. And fight for everything I thought was important in the film, but not necessarily important to everyone from the RCS team. It was a gamble of ideas and trying to make them work in the final film. And I must say it was done with respect to authors, I never felt under pressure if certain ideas didn’t work out. I really respect this way of working.”\n\nPetra Seliskar, director.\n\nA State of Exception by Jason O´Hara (Canada 2017)\n\nFive years the filmmaker followed what is happening to the indigenous people and inhabitants of favelas in Rio De Janeiro when World Cup and Olympic Games were changing the city. Premiere at Hot Docs 2017. Magnus Isacsson Award at RIDM – Rencontres Internationales du Documentaire de Montréal 2017.\n\n“We were lost at sea when we turned to Rough Cut Service – so much footage shot over so many years and a drawn out editing process had muffled and blinkered our ability to see our material objectively as a cinematic experience. Iikka wrangled with us through finding a new structure – suggesting a completely radical approach that we trusted and flew with. And yet, at no point was it an imposition – the few things we wanted to keep, we kept, and otherwise were blown away at how much the new ideas, the new input, not only shaved off all the unnecessary junk and helped clear up confusions, it also gave us tons of fresh insights on how to tell our story, re-energized our own creative approach to the material.\n\nYael came in next and offered a subtler eye on the rhythms, the pacing, the filmic experience, bringing the scenes from rushed, pedestrian assemblies to living, breathing scenes. Such an incredibly valuable service!”\n\nKatharine Asals, editor.\n\nAn Insignificant Man by Khusboo Ranka and Vinay Shukla (India 2016)\n\nThe film follows the birth of the newest political party in India, AAP, that got a landslide victory in Delhi and grows to a universal story about how people are tired of the old elite of politics.

Premiere at IDFA 2016.\n\n“Hiring an editor for several months for a feature length documentary can cost 10,000 to 20,000 euros. Often my budgets cannot sustain this cost. And yet I feel the need for editing help by people who know an international audience, who know documentary, and who are sensitive and understanding of stories faraway from their society, and know how to help bring out the universal elements in them while keeping the integrity and authenticity of the ‘local’.\n\nThe Rough Cut Service, which I have used twice now, answers all these needs. Their critique of the film is thorough, detail , and look at both the content (ie a faraway world) as well as the aesthetic and technical. The RCS responded to my rough cuts with a fine, nuanced critique, paying attention to all the seemingly small details that ultimate add or, their mishandling, spoil a film. Its comments are to the point, forceful, yet sympathetic, and leave room for the filmmaker to decide for herself the important decisions.\n\nI have used the RoughCutService in my last two films and would use it again, without hesitation. Its affordability and ease of collaboration is a boon especially for filmmakers in the developing world.”\n\nKesang Tseten, director.\n\nNowhere To Hide by Zaradasht Ahmed (Norway, Iraq 2016)\n\nA disturbing war experience by an Iraqi father and male nurse who is forced to flee when his home city is occupied by ISIS. Winner of the main competition at IDFA 2016. Winner at Prague One World Festival 2017.\n\n“Rough Cut Service is an important documentary film consulting service for film makers that need to lift up her/his project 2 to 3 levels. During our cooperation with RCS with Iikka Vehkalahti and Jean Tsien we were able to improve the quality of the film. We managed to make a more interesting story both dramaturgical and also story wise. As a director I highly recommend the RCS with my full support to them and their vision of developing one of the most important areas outside the European union and USA. I’m very pleased to have had the opportunity to work with highly dedicated film-people.”\n\nZaradasht Ahmed, director.\n\nCity of the Sun by Rati Oneli (Georgia, US 2017)\n\nIn his documentary debut, director Rati Oneli provides fascinating insights into a living environment in a ghost mining town Chiatura in western Georgia.

Premiere at Toronto Film Festival 2017.\n\n“We worked with Joelle Alexis and Iikka Vehkalahti on the documentary at a very critical stage in the edit. I can say with absolute certainty they contributed significantly to turning the film around. Their proposed solutions, big and small, brought clarity to the storytelling. We had got to a point in the edit where we had run out of ideas on how to improve the film. With their input, the edit gained momentum and the storytelling leaped forward. They are film rescuers! I am a big fan!”\n\nSteven Markovitz, producer.\n\nUp Down & Sideways by Anushka Meenakshi & Iswar Srikumar (India 2017)\n\nA musical portrait of a community of rice cultivators in a village close to the India-Myanmar border. While working in the fields in small cooperative groups, the men and women sing together – songs that follow the seasons. Screened at IDFA and Thessaloniki Documentary Festival. Nominated for Asia Pacific Screen Awards 2018.\n\n“One thing that really worked for us is that both Per and Iikka were acutely aware of what we wanted and they helped us get the best version of that. Having two mentors working on the film is an excellent idea. Sometimes they agree and sometimes they don’t, but all of this helps create more and more possibilities for us to play with as story tellers. Ideas and suggestions are one thing, but to be able to give them with a sense of humour and with a lot of love is of unbelievable help when one is questioning and doubting everything, which is pretty much what happens while editing. These people love documentaries, and it shows.\n\nCreating a unique platform such as this, keeping it affordable and helping with suggestions on how to fundraise, putting us in touch with people, all of this has made it one of the most fulfilling experiences for us.”\n\nAnushka Meenakshi & Iswar Srikumar, directors.\n\nThe Mountain Pact by Manuele Cecconello & Maurizio Pellegrini (Italy 2017)\n\nThe Mountain Pact was the first act in Europe through which equal pay between men and women was established.

He meets places, outputs and protagonists, such as Nino Cerruti and Argante. The former is the internationally renowned stylist and son to one of the signatories of the pact, the latter is a partisan commander and witness of what took place then.\n\n“I met Joelle Alexis in a training session about how to do good teasers and when she looked at the teaser of the Mountain Pact she simply said: “nothing to say… perfect, professional”. Now I’m back to Rough Cut Service and I hope the film will impact equally good, but I know your full support and help will make the difference!”\n\nFrancesca Conti, producer.\n\nThe Redeemed by Morten Vest (Denmark 2018)\n\nThe story of Danish Christian missionaries in countries like Nigeria is not just about the past – on the contrary.

Atlanta Film Festival – nominee Grand Jury Award. Screened at Havana Film Festival, São Paulo International Film Festival, This Human World.\n\n“Rough Cut Service was one of the most important pieces of our puzzle during the editing process. After many years shooting one story, we become kind of “blind” to really see some aspects of it. Iikka and Erez were very sensitive and accurate in terms of defining the boundaries between what we have lived during filming and what is within our images. They were exceptional in understanding our view as auteurs and working from this aspect, exploring the potentials that we had within it.\n\nRCS is an important tool in documentary world that gives the opportunity for young directors to connect with very talented and experienced editors throughout the world for bringing up what we all have in common: love for documentaries.” Giovanna Giovanini & Rodrigo Boecker, directors.\n\nRush Hour by Luciana Kaplan (Mexico 2017)\n\nTransportation is a burning topic of everyday life nowadays.

Premiere Sheffield Doc/fest 2018.\n\n“In the editing process one can easily become blind to the material and its potential. The help we got from RCS was absolutely vital in first of all getting very skilled and insightful but objective eyes to look at our cut. As a first time filmmaker, it was very important for me that the feedback was encouraging, warm, seemed to be “on our side” but was also honest, critical and constructive. There is no doubt in my mind that the film is much better as a result from RCS help.” Inka Achté, director\n\nThe Cleaners by Hans Block, Moritz Riesewieck (Germany 2018)\n\nA look at the shadowy underworld of the Internet where questionable content is removed.

When we sent them the rough cut, we knew that the film was in there but it wasn’t coming through the way we wanted.

I came to RCS with the idea to do some make up but it turned out that there was much more than a bit of make up to do. By going once again through the footage (10 years of footage!) in order to provide answers made us discover a treasure hidden because of decisions made long ago. The film has incredibly improved, the protagonists have become tridimensional, the storyline is at the service of the protagonists.\n\nWorking with Iikka and Menno allowed me and the editor to watch our film from an International perspective and discover weaknesses and strengths.

Premiere at Locarno Film Festival 2019.\n\n“We are really very thankful for the help RCS gave us during our editing process. It really gave us trust into our film, in a time when we where quite critical with ourselves – especially with the more abstract episodes of the storytelling and also with the overall philosophical arch of it. So it helped us to come finally to a version that we love ourselves, that works in terms of dramaturgy, and that is radical, without compromises.”\n\nElsa Kremser, director.\n\nContradict by Peter Guyer & Thomas Burkhalter (Switzerland 2020)\n\nTogether with artists from Ghana the filmmakers explore questions of global developments, values and visions for the future. Premiere at Solothurner Filmtage 2020.\n\n“After almost a year of editing and a lot of test screenings with no tangible result, we were stuck and slightly desperate. The outside, e.g. international, view and the dramaturgical expertise as well as the fresh ideas how things could be told in a different way, helped a lot and opened new fields and thoughts which was liberating indeed! Moreover the feedback, remarks and criticism were direct but always very respectful.”\n\nMadeleine Corbat, producer.\n\nNever Happened by Barbora Berezňáková (Slovakia/Czech Republic 2019)\n\nThe director investigates a top level kidnapping case, exploring the chain of events and the emotional impact for the witnesses. Premiere at Warsaw IFF 2019. Cinematik IFF – Cinematik.doc Award.\n\n“The RCS experience was one of the most eye-opening experiences after my studies. The consultants were very sensitive people with a lot of understanding for my film as well as the approach I took to the topic. Even that the story was quite complicated and of a local character, they understood the specifics and gave me sophisticated insight into both the structure of the film and the style I chose.” Barbora Berezňáková, director.\n\n“From my point of view, the consultations with both Iikka Vehkalahti and Menno Boerema helped the director in the last phase of editing to focus the story, change some unclear spots in the narrative and they both gave her their insight in a very sensitive way. We were as well very pleased by very quick feedback which helped us a lot as we were under time pressure.”\n\nHana Blaha Šilarová, Czech Producer.\n\nTwo Roads by Radovan Síbrt (Czech Republic 2019)\n\nThe film follows members of The Tap Tap – a music band of physically disabled.

Selected for Hot Docs, One World, goEast.\n\n“We planned to approach RCS as we had a prior experience with them and valued their input. We approached at the right moment, while we were editing but running in circles at the same time. We were even becoming depressed about our own film. Therefore, we needed someone to see with no closer involvement and help us to make a meaningful progress. Jordana Berg and Jakob Kirstein Høgel helped us to renew the strong story line and essential message of the film. It hurt as any editing process does, but totally worth it.”\n\nRadovan Síbrt, director.\n\nRemnants of a Revolution by Cha Escala (the Philippines 2019)\n\nA founding member of the Communist Party of the Philippines is on the final days of his life when his son discovers his role in the dark period of the Party’s history.

World premiere at Sheffield Doc/Fest 2020.\n\n“It took me 4 years to finish my film and I must say that without the help of RCS, I probably would never have finished it. Deciding on a structure with the materials that I was able to gather within the years I was working, mostly on own, was the most difficult part. I came up with a rough cut but couldn’t move forward from it. It sat there for more than a year until RCS came on board and solved the puzzle.” Cha Escala, director.\n\nHoles by Shirly Berkovitz (Israel)\n\nFollowing his son’s murder, Danny the father – an Ex-Hitman-Syrian-Muslim who turned Israeli-Jew – realizes the state won’t seek justice and sets on an investigative quest to find the truth.

Premiere at DocPoint Documentary Film Festival 2021 where it was awarded the Jury Special Mention.\n\n“It was a great experience to work with Iikka and Claudio from RCS. Both have a strong sense of dramaturgy and a clear vision of how to make the story stronger and lift it to a higher level. I enjoyed exchanging ideas with them; they were challenging me, sharing their views, but always leaving the final choice to the filmmaker. I can strongly recommend RCS.” Mohamed El Aboudi, director.\n\nColombia in my Arms by Jenni Kivistö & Jussi Rastas (Finland)\n\nThe film examines if a nation can stop the cycle of violence that has lasted for decades, even centuries.

Premiere at IDFA 2019.\n\n“When in the editroom in Amsterdam we came to a point that we’ve had been editing for so long that we where losing our freshness and didn’t see clearly anymore where and how we could improve our film, I contacted the RCS. My first contact was with Iikka Vehkahlahti. Iikka put me in contact with Erez Laufer. From the moment I’ve shown my film to those two highly skilled proffesionals I felt I was in good hands. I felt they both understood the film and I also felt that working with both of them could bring the film to a higher level.\n\nShowing one’s film in such a vulnerable stage is never easy, but I can not say otherwise than I’m truly amazed on how they worked with me and the film. They didn’t spare me nor the film, but instead put their fingers exactly on the weak spots of the film. Not just critizising, but always coming up with valuable suggestions on how we could try to solve our problems. And by following most of their suggestions the film has indeed inmensly improved.\n\nI feel great gratitude to have had the opportunity to work with the RCS, in fact I cannot imagine how I’ve made films before without consulting them. It’s my sincere hope that this is the beginning of a life long collaboration.”\n\nOeke Hoogendijk, director.\n\nPLAY! by Thorunn Hafstad (Iceland 2019)\n\nThe imagination of children leads us into a fantasy narrative of play, where adults are nowhere to be found and the harsh reality of nature and imagination takes over.

You could say I had two films, one before the RCS and one after. My consultants, Joelle Alexis and Jakob Høgel gave me the courage to tell the story I had hiding deep inside. They seemed to deeply care about the progress of the film and went out of their way to see it through to the end. Last but not least they showed me the power of the service of great editors, never to be underestimated.”\n\nDögg Mósesdóttir , director.\n\nFault by John Harkrider (USA 2020)\n\nFault tells the story of the director’s father – a Caltech geophysicist who is slowly losing his memory to Alzheimers.

The all-encompassing waters, unceasing waves and distant horizons are elements that link the protagonists, regardless of their motivation to go out to sea.\n\n“We started working with RCS at a stage when we felt to be stuck in a dead end, going in circles. The conversations with the consulting editors and Anne Fabini and Niels Pagh Andersen gave us a new look on our material, the edit and many fresh ideas. The feedback also helped us to look at our film from an audience perspective and discover what is working and what not and why. We started to try out things with new confidence which led us to change the film structure and way of storytelling. In a very short time we reached a stage, in which we felt that we have a real film in between our hands. We are very grateful and thankful for this fruitful collaboration. I feel I have now the film that I have been always looking for, that is sincere and close to me and at the same time works with the audience.” Jola Wieczorek, director & producer.\n\nNinosca by Peter Torbiörnsson (Sweden 2020)\n\nNinosca – The Woman and the Emigrant’s Song is the third and last film of a trilogy, about a woman’s struggle for independence which requires her to face her past in the macho-culture of Central America.

Our film has several narrative lines and countless possibilities of embroider it. We’re in the middle of its montage and got two independent feedbacks from Iikka Vehkalahti and Maya Hawke. It was great. Both provoked us to think deeply about our choices and helped us to find the best form to address it. Several meetings and innumerable exchanges throughout the process. We even thought we were abusing then but they kept interested in the film till the very end. We can only say: thank you very much for all!” Toni Venturi & Val Gomes, directors.\n\nThe Quest for Tonewood by Hans Lukas Hansen (Norway, The Netherlands 2020)\n\nIn certain alpine forests one might find special trees that are worth their weight in gold.

Premiere at Human IDFF 2021.\n\n“When we got in contact with RCS “The Quest for Tonewood” needed an outside viewpoint, someone who could see the film from a different angle, without relating to other, previous versions or to the source material. Getting the feedback from the two RCS experts was really valuable. It confirmed some of the things we already knew, both good and bad, and it gave us some new ideas of how to solve specific scenes and overall structure. It was interesting to hear two completely different views, that nevertheless shared our enthusiasm for the film. Especially being at the very last stage of the editing, it was very useful to get a new perspective on the project.” Benedikte Danielsen, producer and Hans Lukas Hansen, director.\n\nThe Other Side of the River by Antonia Kilian (Germany, Finland 2020)\n\nHala, a young Arab woman, joins the Kurdish women’s movement to flee the Islamic State.
