        "text": "As the 50th anniversary of Franco's death and the 90th anniversary of the Francoist coup approach, this story looks back at the war that shook Spain to its core. A war opened in 1936, but never really closed since.\n\nOf the Civil War that tore Spain apart, we generally retain only a few famous images, such as Robert Capa's photographs, Orwell's books, or Picasso's painting Guernica, a symbol of both Nazi barbarism and Franco's dictatorship. Through the poignant testimonies and accounts of people who lived through this tragic period, this documentary delves into the roots of dictatorial regimes to better understand what is at stake today, in Spain as in Europe, in the defense of freedom and democracy. The story is structured around two 52-minute episodes.

From the 1960s to the present day, their words bring to life this historic epic in its political, geopolitical, social, and human dimensions.\n\nA thriller-like documentary series based on an unbelievable story where next generation weapons, the resurgence of the Cold War, and worldwide geopolitical intrigues all merge. Hundreds of U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers have fallen victims to mysterious attacks they initially called “the Thing”. This unique investigation, featuring exclusive high profile interviews, offers a new insight into what is secretly haunting the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nIt all starts out with an immaculate crime scene, a piercing noise, and American state officers who suddenly develop mysterious symptoms. Yet, no doctor or scientist can explain what happened. At the highest level of the U.S. government, from the CIA to the White House, the news spreads that agents around the world are falling one after another.\n\nThe agents targeted – amongst the most brilliant of their generation – suffer severe after-effects: some lost their sense of balance, others the use of one eye, or can no longer memorize a text.\n\nGovernment officials and scientists scramble to decipher what’s happening and to find the culprits. In the meantime, the invisible and threatening enemy remains at large… Is America struggling with an epidemic of paranoia or is it the dawn of a new Cold War, with the world as a battlefield?\n\nDream travels, unusual encounters and exciting stories, this series shows you the world and provides insights into the lives and work of exceptional men and women across the globe. This multiple award-winning series is one of the most ambitious productions of its kind.\n\nFrom sapphire mines in Madagascar to a small Russian village on the edge of the Arctic Circle that is slowly sinking into the sand… Our teams travel the planet exploring nature, technology and remote civilizations and portray what they discover there through meticulously documented, emotion-packed reports.\n\nA stunning series that takes you along the most beautiful and vast corridor of life in the Rockies.

Through the success stories of four emblematic animals (bison, grizzly, woodland caribou, wolf), we follow this immense 2000 mile corridor of life all the way through the four episodes of this series and discover how it is working to preserve the Rocky Mountain ecosystem, in close collaboration with Canadian Indian and First Nations tribes.\n\nThe art market had not yet experienced its digital revolution. Until that day of 2021, when NFTs, short for Non Fungible Token, appeared on your screens. Thanks to this new transaction technology, Beeple, an almost unknown digital artist, became the third most expensive living artist in the world.\n\nNFTs promise to revolutionize the art market. More money for artists, fewer intermediaries, and fewer barriers for collectors. Will this digital revolution be virtuous, or will it meet the same fate as many others before it, emptied of their meaning and twisted from their original goals?\n\nThis 10-part series takes you on an anthropological and cultural journey to ten destinations around the world, to reflect on our globalized consumption patterns. An invitation to travel in the most beautiful way possible to the last bastions of local customs and cultures.\n\nLet us meet the men and women who make these markets a place of commercial and cultural exchange. While the globalized economy leads to a standardization of tastes and consumption, going to a market allows you to dive immediately into a local culture, to meet its inhabitants, its food, its smells, its colors, its customs. An invitation to travel in the most beautiful way possible, to enjoy the abundant and varied riches of nature and meet people from different cultures around the world, who are the beating hearts of these markets.\n\nDive into 5 of the most visited European heritage emblems and their breathtaking, unexpected and diversified wildlife. This ambitious series is an amazing immersion into the heart of incredible ecosystems, with the people who preserve it everyday.\n\nMont Saint-Michel, the Loire valley châteaux, Alhambra or Bastei Bridge… Every year, these breathtaking sites attract tourists from across the world. But hidden in the meanderings off the beaten track, fascinating and unexpected stories unfold: the stories of the wildlife that inhabits these places.\n\nFor, although these famous French cultural heritage sites have been built over the centuries, they are located within areas of outstanding natural beauty, with their own iconic species such as the Red deer of Chambord, the Black stork of Pont Bastei or the toads of the Alhambra.\n\nToday, the preservation of these exceptional sites can no longer be done without taking into account the wildlife. And after several centuries of ignoring each other, these two worlds are finally coming together to show that natural and historical heritage can become allies! Over the course of four seasons, this prestigious documentary collection revisits the great French heritage sites from the perspective of the wildlife that inhabits them, offering an unusual look at these mythical sites, with fur, feathers or scales.\n\nBy the producers of the internationally acclaimed series The Great Greek Myths, this new series unveils for the first time the true essence of Nordic tales which are based on ancient texts. These Nordic legends gave birth to the most popular culture block busters: Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, Marvel’s Thor or George R. R. Martin’s GOT.\n\nThe fascination for this mythological world became widespread especially among the youngest, who are sensitive to the many explicit references in popular culture. All these references only draw on these myths, modifying, adapting or transforming them. The original stories have never been faithfully retranscribed with the very soul of these legends and the complexity of their characters. More precisely, it seems that no documentary production has ever attempted to tell these stories as they have come down to us. This documentary series based on ancient texts is therefore unique. It aims to tell the stories in a rigorous way, as a heritage response to the ever-growing interest in this mythological world."
