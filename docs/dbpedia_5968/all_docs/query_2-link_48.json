        "text": "On January 7th, the FUJI Adventure boarded the Sky Princess cruise ship out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Guests received VIP treatment and customized medallions as they boarded through private FUJI Adventure lines for quick, easy access.\n\nThe FUJI Adventure kicked off with an amazing welcome reception for all guest and clinicians. Guest received a special swag bag packed with over $300 worth of custom FUJI Sports gear specific to the FUJI Caribbean Adventure! Gear included everything from custom rashguards, custom shorts, custom shirts, bags, towels, and more. FUJI Sports co-owner Jimmy Pedro did an incredible job as MC for the welcome reception, introducing our talented clinicians and FUJI staff.\n\nThe first seminar kicked off the next morning on Princess Cruiseâ€™s Private Island of Princess Cays. Clinicians Xande Ribeiro and Gregor Gracie did an excellent job leading a two hour session covering butterfly guard. Guest were able to train and learn from some of the best grapplers in the world right on the beach thanks to FUJI Mats supplying custom mats for these events! At the end of the seminar, guests were able to take individual photos with all of the guest instructors.\n\nAfter the seminar, guests enjoyed the beach along with excursions throughout the island. At night, FUJI Adventure guests had an unbelievable experience training on the deck of the Sky Princess. The night seminar was led by BJJ & Judo Legend Travis Stevens! Travis went over essential concepts of grappling to help students better apply their own techniques.\n\nAfter the evening seminar, the VIP treatment continued with a private FUJI Adventure social hour where guests got to drink, eat, and dance with all the guest clinicians.\n\nLooking forward to the next day with Rilion Gracie, Jimmy Pedro, and Kayla Harrison!"
