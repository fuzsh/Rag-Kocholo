        "text": "Disclaimer: You may want to scroll down to Day 23 to start reading, to stay in chronological order, it took a couple days to catch up. Stick\n\nDay 24 and this ride is in the history books.\n\nThe 4 riders had a complete blast riding the back roads of America, and exploring the small towns and cities along the way. We saw incredible sights, sights that we would never had experienced on a typical road ride whether by bike or passenger vehicle.\n\nOur plan the entire time, was no plan. We would make it up as we went. We didn’t have a hard schedule, just a general time line of upto 30 days on the road. It wound up being completed in just 24 days.\n\nAnd while we didn’t see everything that we talked and discussed in our casual conversations along the way, such as Moab, or the Glacial Highway in Northern Montana, we don’t feel as if we missed a thing. The spontaneous route changes ensured we saw more than we could have expected. Besides, you always have to have something to look forward to on the next ride!\n\nI would like to give the Rand McNally award to our GPS guru and Ride Captain Ski Doo Matt. Each night as we sat around sipping cold rocky mountains, the 4 of us looking at our google maps and throwing out suggestions for the next night’s host city, Matt would look up mileage, sights along the way, and the back roads we would need to travel, and pick out the next town to pumble. Thank you Matt from all of us for your patience, your guidance and overall excellent trip. To Infinity And Beyond (inside joke, while at dinner at the Brass Rail, Julie couldn’t figure out who Matt reminded her of. As her and Monkey discussed it, they said he looks like Buzz Lightyear. Matt overheard their conversation, and exuberantly proclaimed in his best rendition of Buzz “To Infinity And Beyond! And we all had a good laugh).\n\nTo Hedge Hog, Hedgie, and a host of other names I called you over the last 23 days that are not suitable for print, thank you for your friendship. You are great company on the road, and we can always count on you to engage in conversation with the locals at each stop thru out the day. To you out there still following this stupid blog, I am going to take a minute and explain where HedgeHog came from. A few years ago we were on a snowmobile trip during Ground Hogs day. Since the ground hog is named Phil, I proclaimed him our ride ground hog, but he couldn’t be ground hog because there’s already one named Phil, and he would have to be our hedgehog. It’s all in love and he has begrudgingly accepted it. Love ya my brother.\n\nTo The Monkey, who had never owned a road bike before this trip, just a lot of motorcross experience, you were a great Wing Man, and co-habitant of a room each night. I know he was thoroughly overwhelmed, in a good way, with the experience and the sights seen. What a way to take your first multi day rode trip on a bike. You started at the top of ride experiences and I know you are already mulling your next adventure. Since I’m discussing how nick names came about, may as well explain Rod’s moniker. We were out in Sacramento back in 2016 with a big group of people for an AMA flat track race, and we had 2 window licker vans. He was the driver of one, and our buddy Toldo was the driver of the other. We were leaving the local H-D dealer, Monkey in the front van and getting directions from a passenger back to the hotel, and Toldo was behind him at the intersection. Toldo already knew to turn right, but Rod turned left. This led Toldo to blurt out, I don’t know where that Monkey is going, but we ain’t following him! Hence, Monkey has stuck, appropriately so.\n\nFor 4 guys that have never spent multiple mornings, lunches, dinners, and evenings around a tailgate for an extended period of time, you guys were the best. Never a disagreement, a temper flare up, or fist a cuff situation. There’s something to be said for that, and I look forward to our next adventure together. Here’s a final “fist bump” to you, my friends.\n\nThank you to our wives, Julie, Shannon, Kim and Jen. Without your support of our crazy endeavors, we wouldn’t be able to even contemplate these crazy adventures we cook up. Thank you for your patience and support, it is appreciated from the entire group, to each of you.\n\nI would like to thank Terry Rhymer in Rapid City SD for his friendship and your tour guide expertise around Sturgis and the Black Hills. You took us to see more in the area in just a day and a half than we could have seen on our own in 5 days. Your hospitality was over the top for just meeting most of us on this journey, and you can cook me another Rib Eye on the Big Green Egg anytime, my friend.\n\nThank you to Truck/Trailer Driver Brian for being the support on the road that came in handy for us all. And also for setting a high bar for the next driver, by making sure the cooler was heavily iced and stocked. And also for being sure we had good accommodations each night, lol.\n\nThank you to Monkey Brother Rick for jumping in when Brian’s tour of duty was over. With only about 72 hours notice/request to fly from Vegas to Jackson Hole and take over the wheel. You were a quick study of the duties of the role, and filled the shoes to a tee.\n\nTo all the people we met at gas stations, restaurants and Harley Stores that inquired about our ride, where we came from, where we are going (to the Pacific Ocean was our standard reply) and quizzical looks when we said what day of 30 we were on, THANK YOU for your well wishes and conversations. It made the trip great for us to receive your warm well wishes.\n\nThursday night found Monkey & I back in Michigan, him resting on his couch for the afternoon. But first he stopped by the local bar Scooters, where him & I met on Day 1, and got a selfie. We had planned to arrive together on 2 wheels, but the gremlins couldn’t keep their claws off my HD.\n\nDay 22, and we have landed in Peoria IL, at the Baymont Hotel. Another dump of a location, but about the only thing available with 3 rooms. Apparently there is a girls soft ball or volley ball tournament going on in the area, taking up all the good rooms! Our room door had black duct tape holding the dead bolt recessed, and had to hit the door with your shoulder to enter. And to close the door when you left, you had to use the key card to unlock the door before closing, turn the handle to release the latch, and then slam the door shut. 5 stars here, baby.\n\nMy morning started at 7:30 am for our scheduled departure time of 8am. Last night I thought the dealer opened at 9am. However that was the dealer I was talking to in Lincoln NE, not the one in Omaha NE, that is now the closer dealer and also on the route towards east and home. Nope, Defiance HD in Omaha doesn’t open until 10am. So we will be early, it’s worked our for us in the past.\n\nBrother Rick & I arrived in Omaha, a few miles from Defiance HD, about 9:15am, so we stopped at the local diner for a breakfast for Rick, I had already eaten the complimentary corn flakes in the hotel lobby. But the place advertised the best pies’ in the world. Now how could I just let this opportunity slip by. I ordered the apple pie ala mode as a little snack. The first slice of warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream had a nice long black hair on top. I sent that piece back. Soon after the replacement pie arrived, and I’d say best in the world is a stretch, probably not even the best on the street.\n\nAnywho, Ski Doo led Monkey and Hedgie out on the road at I’m not sure what time because I wasn’t there, and nobody really volunteered much information to me. I only know they had a lightly overcast day of riding with comfortable temperatures that went from 65-75 degrees, and apparently they had smooth sailing. I know they put in one of the longest days yet, I think it was around 420 miles and they got in around 5:30pm local time.\n\nRick & I arrived at the HD Dealer right about 10am, and they were opening the doors and moving bikes outside for display. I was first in line at the Service write up counter, and the young man got my Panamerica right in for diagnostics.\n\nI used the down time to finish this stupid blog in the showroom with the free wifi. Then I did some real work on my laptop, then I made phone calls to people I haven’t talked to in 3 weeks. That killed about an hour and a ½. I hadn’t heard from the service department, do it couldn’t hurt to inquire, right?\n\nI was told the diagnostics came up low voltage on the battery, and many error codes had been thrown out. They were in the process of charging and testing the battery and that had about 45 more minutes to go.\n\nSo I gave them until 1pm before I inquired again. I killed this hour buying my tshirt shot glass and a sticker for everybody. I also spent the time telling myself I was riding out of this dealer on 2 wheels, and I was going to catch up with the boys if they get me out of here by 3pm.\n\nAt 1pm, time for my pestering inquiry as to what is the current status. The battery is good, and the technician is now the phone with Harley Tech Support to help proceed Great, I can still ride on 2 wheels today, I keep telling myself.\n\nI sat with Rick in the service lobby, with a tv in the corner playing 50 year old reruns of Gunsmoke. Really, it’s 2022, can’t we get into the current century of rerun tv! Maybe some Two & ½ men or something.\n\nAnyway around 1:30 I was getting hungry, so Rick drove me around town in circles with the truck and trailer, trying to find a place we could pull into for some takeout. Just when we located a Burger King, my phone rings with a local number from Omaha. The service writer tells me that Harley Support wants them to take the starter off, run a volt test on that, and work backwards from there. And there are a lot of parts to take off to get to the starter.\n\nI interrupt him and tell him to get it ready to load, I’m not staying the night in Omaha, especially with still not a guarantee that the bike will be fixed after all this. I’ll take it to Ray’Cs HD in Lapeer MI for this. So we skipped the Burger King, hightailed it back to the dealer, loaded and strapped the bike down, and off to Peoria IL to catch up with the others. It was around 2:30 pm. My ride on 2 wheels is over. The rest of my trip is looking thru the windshield of this Ford Super Duty 250, from the passenger seat.\n\nApparently Hedgie had a few problems with his Panamerica on his ride as well. While cruising down a busy state highway, at speed, his bike went into “limp”mode, and dramatically slowed to 25 mph. Not fun when there is a loaded down concrete truck rolling behind you, and blaring the horn as your bike has no concern that it is putting you into peril. I hear this limp mode was activated twice during his travels yesterday. Not a fun situation to be in.\n\nRick & I hot lapped the truck & trailer into Peoria, about 420 miles out. We got into town around 8:40pm and had to pick Monkey, Ski Doo and Hedge up at the restaurant they had just finished dinner at, because the Uber driver that dropped them off, was going off shift after that drop off, and their Uber app didn’t show any other drivers available for the return trip to the hotel.\n\nAfter we parked the truck and trailer out front of the hotel, we proceeded to tailgate with the iced down cooler, until that was drained by about 11pm. One by one we meandered off to our respective rooms.\n\nTomorrow, Wednesday July 27, 2022, our destination is Plymouth Indiana. This is the nearest town to where Hedge and Ski Doo live, that has a Holiday Inn Express. Their ride will be complete at the end of the day. We are planning on having dinner and celebratory drinks at the Wings Etc in Plymouth tonight, if anybody would like to join us.\n\nMonkey & my plan is that my wife, Julie, is going to leave Flint and drive my truck and motorcycle trailer to the Holiday Inn in Plymouth, and join us for dinner and drinks, and I will load my bike and gear in my own trailer to get my crap home. I will be the support vehicle for Monkey on his final leg of the ride tomorrow, Wednesday July 28, 2022, to get home. Not that he will need the support, the KTM’s have performed flawlessly on this trip, and I fully expect that to continue.\n\nWe shall see,\n\nBye for now,\n\nStick\n\nWe took our paper plates of pizza and wings to the outside patio space that was blockaded with a white aluminum stockade fence, and enjoyed the very pleasant evening outdoors. We continued our conversations for the rest of the evening around that table, and it was a great evening with friends. Sorry, I was wrapped up in the moment, and didn’t think to get any pictures of our night.\n\nFrom the weather reports we were looking at Sunday night, we knew we would not be having an early departure on Monday. There was a big rain cell moving in over night, and it was moving in the same direction we need to be moving… East.\n\nAround 9:30am, I was done catching up with my real work on my tablet, the bag was packed, and we were showered and ready, but the rain was still falling, but getting lighter. I called Hedgie to get their opinion, and we all agreed to a roughly 10:30am start time. Rain or shine, this circus has to move to the next town.\n\nWe were on the road before 11am, with a light drizzle heavy mist falling on our windscreens. The rain would intermittently be light or misty thru out the day, and our ride. No biggie, we have the proper gear for the occasion, and quite honestly it was enjoyable to me for these conditions. It wasn’t the high desert heat melting us, and there sure wasn’t anything to look at riding thru Nebraska, might as well enjoy the cool temperatures of 63 degrees and rain.\n\nI guess it was around 2:30/3pm when we got to Hastings Nebraska and found the Goldenrod Café. It was a good time to stop, we had caught up with the heaviest part of the rain cell in front of us, and a grilled cheese and bowl of chili would be good right about now. So, 4 grilled cheeses and bowls of chili were ordered and delivered. Brother Rick came thru town not much longer after our arrival, so we ordered him a cheeseburger all dressed, and he joined us for our lunch stop. Wish I could say we warmed up and dried out at the little café, but we sat right under the air conditioning vents and it felt like they had the air on blast. But the food was good, can’t have everything.\n\nAfter lunch, we topped off the fuel tanks, and headed back in to the land of John Deere. We stopped occasionally for quick rest, but pretty much kept rolling. What else are you going to do in Nebraska?\n\nAfter about 220 miles, we came across a small one bar town, and stopped in at the one bar, for another quick rest. After everybody that ordered a soft drink consumed their soft drink, back on the road we were. Most of them anyways.\n\nI mounted my bike, and turned the power switch on. My Bluetooth helmet had not been synching for most of the day and I wanted to see if it would finally synch this time. Nope. So I put my riding gloves on and fired up the bike. Put it in gear and began to roll out the clutch when it shut down. The kickstand was still down, and as a safety feature, it shuts the bike down. Ok, kickstand up, push the fire up button. Nothing. Notta, zilch.\n\nThe guys rallied around me and my dead bike. We tried different scenarios to get it to fire with no luck. We put a battery pack on the positive cable to see if that would help. Nothing. Notta, zilch.\n\nBrother Rick, get the trailer over here, it’s getting loaded up, I’m not holding up the guys and their ride. It was around 5:15pm and as I rode shot gun in the truck with Brother Rick, I started calling the local HD dealership to see how late the service department will be open. 6pm is the closing time, but they gave me a few ideas to try when we get in, to do a hard reset of the ignition and such.\n\nBrother Rick & I got into the Syracuse Inn & Suites around 6:15pm, just behind the boys on bikes. They already had our rooms checked in, so after unloading our gear, the time came to crack a few cold ones and try the suggestions to get my bike back up and running. I did the quick on/off of the power switch 3 times with a 3 second pause between offs, as suggested by the HD service department. No luck. Still dead. Monkey and Ski Doo took the skid plate off for access to the battery to disconnect it and attempt to reset whatever is defaulting. While doing that, there is a 15 amp fuse that monkey pulled out to check, and broke while replacing it. Ski Doo and I walked over the local gas station/convenience store across the parking lot and got a fresh pack of fuses.\n\nWhile checking out, Ski Doo noticed the display case with the shooter bottles of different liquors, and we made the joint decision that this called for a FireBall for each of us. We stepped out on the sidewalk cracked the shooter bottles, toasted each other and laughed our way back to the trailer where Monkey was impatiently waiting for us.\n\nFuse replace, battery disconnected, and re-connected and still Nothing. Notta, zilch. We tied the bike back down and Ski Doo and I proceeded to drain the cooler of the cold rocky mountains. Hedgie and Monkey bounced in and out of our session, and that was the rest of our night.\n\nWhile we were having our session, a friendly fella by the name of Dave, who owns a mobile “hardware” for the farmers around the midwest, joined us for a few cold ones and lively conversation as well. He was quite the hoot, and even I can remember his wedding date: June 9; get it 6/9. Enjoyed his company and I think he enjoyed ours as well.\n\nDinner was exceptional. Before bed we decided we better do better than the pork chops in a can we had been consuming. The only options left open was the same convenience store/gas station across the parking lot. We wound getting premade/prepackaged sandwiches from the cooler. Chicken salad, ham and cheese and turkey and cheese. Oh boy. After chowing those down in the hotel lobby, and a few quick spins on the lobby slot machine and we were DUN, done.\n\nI’m pretty sure it was her husband who had the cooking station set up on the front covered deck, with a Blackstone Griddle for cooking the best burgers in town. We enjoyed our short lunch visit with the husband/wife proprietors. Bought a couple long sleeve t-shirts from her, gave her our home addresses so she could mail us a couple stickers when she get’s them restocked, and he engaged with us on the local riding scene and how he is in the market for an HD Panamerica. Great stop, and I highly recommend it if you find yourself near Encampment WY.\n\nThru out the day we intermittently stopped to put our rain gear on, take our rain gear off, put our rain gear on, as the showers were sporadic all day. Nothing really heavy ever hit, even though it looked like a wall of rain we were running into several times, as it dispersed usually be the time we reach the weather cell.\n\nWe saddled back up, and continued down the road, to Colorado. Thanks to a recommendation from the friendly cook at the Mangy Moose we took the path thru the Roosevelt National Park. I really can’t even put into words how majestic the ride thru this national park is. The road travels along the river, with just unbelievable rock faced mountains on the other side of you. There are lots of camping sites, that looked pretty full on this Saturday in July, as well as the fly fisherman, and white water rapids inflatables braving the rapids. Unfortunately, my description is all your going to get. During the last rain gear strip down, I left my phone in my rain gear, strapped to the back of my bike, and I was not able to get any pictures from the phone mount on my handlebars. I am just as aggravated, you really are missing out on what we saw from the saddle!\n\nBut I better back up to our entry into Colorado. We saw the Welcome to Colorado sign, and needed to get our group picture. As the other 3 were positioning their bikes in front of the sign, I was trying to position my bike as the camera stand. As I was doing that, I stopped in a low spot in the median, and my short legs couldn’t adequately square up on the uneven terrain, let alone try and get the kickstand down, and I wasn’t going to fight it, as it was leaning to the left, I just said screw it, and jumped out before I smashed a toe again. No harm no foul.\n\nDay 18 is complete after about 373 miles today. Much better weather conditions, and the end, for a few days, of highway riding. We are back in Wyoming, in Rock Springs at the Rock Springs Baymont motel. The boys are out front talking smack, and having a couple cold ones, with a couple other Harley riders that are in for the night. And I am writing this stupid blog again.\n\nLast night in Jerome, Idaho, we went to dinner at Fat Clarence’s Grille. Simple bar fare was had, and a couple tall, large rocky mountains. Not to much to write about that, hot wings and salads is what went around.\n\nBack to the hotel by 9pm, and your writer turned in. I believe the rest of them hung out in the pool area, having a couple night caps. Call time was for between 7am and 7:30. It was closer to 7:30 when Ski Doo Matt came out of hibernation, and we were ready to launch. Got off to a smooth start, until we didn’t.\n\nAs we came off the entrance ramp of I-84 headed east, Stick looked in his rear view mirror and couldn’t see Hedgie anywhere to be. I rolled up next to Ski Doo and game him the slow down hand motion, and pointed behind us. After another mile of no Hedgie in sight, we pulled over on the shoulder of the busy highway, and called him. His bike had gone into “limp”mode, and would not accelerate beyond 25 mph.\n\nWe were pulled over just past an exit ramp, and he finally appeared, and exited the highway behind us. We cut thru the grassy median, and followed him down the exit ramp. He shut down, and restarted the bike and the dash lights were now now longer flashing every color in the rainbow. He tried to accelerate up the entrance ramp directly in front of us, and it shut down again.\n\nWe decided to call Monkey Brother back, he had just passed us as we sat on the exit ramp, on the highway above us. Once we knew Monkey Brother was in route for pick up, the remaining 3 of us decided the only thing for us to do was to continue on towards our destination. The other 2 would go to the Golden Spike H-D dealer in Riverdale Utah. It was the closest dealer without backtracking, and keeping them going in a forward direction.\n\nAnywho, our day continued on. The temps were much more moderate, and we trucked along without issue for a good spell.\n\nAfter I don’t recall how many miles, we were done with I-84 and back on to the one & two lane roads we prefer. Interstate 30 was our road for the majority of our day. We crossed back into Wyoming, and the scenery was just beautiful all day.\n\nLittle America is just a big tourist catch, that has a cafeteria walk up counter to order your food, wait for your number to be called (not very quickly either) and go back and grab your puke and choke. We quickly departed the crowded facility and got our gear on and ready. But not so quick, usually Ski Doo is one of the first ready to mount up and go. He wasn’t so quick after lunch. I inquired in the only manner I know and asked what was up? You ready? He replied, I am not real excited about getting my arse back on this bike right now! I laughed out loud, because I cleaned up his response dramatically for this blog, and his actual words would be inappropriate for you kids at home. He finally came to terms with the promise that one more mount up and the next stop would be a cold rocky mountain when he got in. You just got to know what motivates your crowd.\n\nAs we re-entered I-80 for the remaining 30 or so miles in to Rock Springs, the first billboard I see is for the Flaming Gorge H-D dealer that is at the exit about 11 miles from our destination. I let Ski Doo continue down the highway un-aware that I was planning on stopping in for a t-shirt, shot glass and sticker, until the final mile when I passed him and led him and Monkey down the exit ramp. At the stop sign he inquired in not quite these terms, what are you doing? I said, Harley dealer this exit! He replied, Oh, you saw the sign. Yes, yes I did. And it turned out to be a good stop too.\n\nAs we were pulling into the parking lot of the strip plaza that the dealer is located in, Hedgie was calling my phone wanting to know if we wanted them to stop at Flaming Gorge H-D for the t-shirt, shot glass and sticker! I inquired where exactly was their location and he said they were 1 mile from the exit. Perfect, I exclaimed. We just pulled into the parking lot, and to meet us here, and he can unload his bike and ride in the last 11 miles with us! Perfect!\n\nSki Doo even enjoyed his visit at the HD dealer, as they offered each of us a cold Bud Light while we browsed for our desired t-shirts. As we checking out, Hedgie came thru the door and we all fist bumped his return to the pack.\n\nHis trip to Golden Spike HD was a success. His Technician, BS, was extremely helpful and accommodating to this traveling Harley Rider. BS quickly diagnosed the problem as a plug wire that connects to the ECM (electronic computer module) was routed incorrectly, and was routed over the clutch cable, and should have been under the clutch cable. The continuous use of the clutch eventually dislodged the plug wire enough to put the bike into limp mode. BS took the bike for a quick test run, ran it thru it’s paces, and turned it back over to Hedgehog.\n\nAfter our purchases at Flaming Gorge HD, we unloaded Hedgie’s bike, threw his helmet at him, and said get on, you started today on 2 wheels, you’re finishing on 2 wheels.\n\nAfter the quick 11 miles in, we were in for the night.\n\nTomorrow’s target city is Fort Collins, Colorado. I hear rumors we may even have a double night in Fort Collins.\n\nWe shall see.\n\nAnd, again, today was not a good picture day for me but I got a few.\n\nBye for now,\n\nStick"
