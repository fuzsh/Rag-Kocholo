        "text": "The Fall of 2019, I was part of a Meetup MTBing group that started talking about night riding. I started looking into bar mounted lights to find they didn't produce a ton of light (around 1,200 lumens), had a \"large\" external battery pack you mounted to your frame that only lasted upwards an hour and the cost...around $800!!! I pushed it off and then COVID hit the following Spring. I kinda gave up on the idea of night riding until last year when I started to see these adds popup on my Instagram feed from this \"Outbound Lighting\"?! I brushed them off at first but then took a look. When I read they touted a dual helmet and bar light setup, I didn't even bother to see the price as it had to be expressive based on prior research (right?). Finally the adds started to call to me and I broke down and looked up the package price and was SHOCKED to see it was only $375!?! How could that be?! It had to be too good to be true. There was no way you could have everything built into a small package, with no external battery packs, touting the run time and lumen output. Or could it?! The images posted of how these lights lit up the trails was very convincing. So I started researching the company and following them for awhile. Finally last Fall I decided I'd buy a set the following Spring. So fast-forward to my birthday (yes I treated myself) and I got the Evo Downhill Package. I still couldn't believe all of what Outbound was touting could be in these two small packages. So I waited for what I considered the ideal weather conditions for a night ride. That was Thu June 6th, 2024. I live in Northern Utah and the daytime temps had just reached the mid-90's, and it was a New Moon. I reached the trail head parking at twilight and proceeded to set up everything for my ride. At this point the darkness had started setting in, so I turned on the lights. WOW!!! is all I can say! These lights are everything Outbound Lighting states them to be! This is my 35th season MTBing, and I never thought I would find something that would bring me back to how I felt the first time I jumped on a MTB. This experience did just that for me! I think if I had done it sooner, with substandard light(s), it wouldn't have been the same experience. The 3,200 lumens light up the trial and everything just around it. At no point did I feel like I would overdrive the lights. I want to thank Outbound Lighting for giving me another reason to ride and to have the ability to experience what's out there in the dark. It really is a whole other world waiting to be experienced!\n\nYou absolutely do not \"need\" 2, but I wanted a high and low beam, because... why not?\n\nI recently purchased the Trail Evo, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations. As an avid mountain biker, I've tried various name-brand lights over the years, but none have come close to the performance of this one.\n\nFirst and foremost, the brightness of this light is phenomenal. It illuminates the trail with a crisp, powerful beam that turns night into day. Whether I'm riding through dense forests or open trails, the visibility is impeccable, allowing me to spot obstacles well in advance. The adaptive brightness setting is a great feature, offering versatility for different riding conditions.\n\nWhat truly sets this light apart, though, is its battery life. On a single charge, it lasts significantly longer than any other lights I've used. During extended night rides, I no longer have to worry about conserving battery. Even on the highest setting, the battery life is impressive, providing peace of mind for those longer adventures.\n\nThe build quality is another standout feature. It's rugged, water-resistant, and has withstood a few accidental drops without any issues. The mounting system is secure and easy to install, ensuring the light stays put even on the roughest terrains.\n\nIn summary, the Trail Evo is a game-changer. Its unmatched brightness and exceptional battery life make it the best option for serious mountain bikers. Having tried other well-known brands, I can confidently say that this light surpasses them all in both performance and reliability. If you're looking for the ultimate MTB light, look no further."
