It was truly one of the best if not the best trip we have ever taken.\n\n~ J.G., Scottsdale, AZ\n\nThe Artisans team on the ground was phenomenal. They treated us like their own family. TOP NOTCH. Our Egyptologist guide was full of knowledge, bright, friendly and just went out of his way to assist us. Our driver had skill and confidence. The hotels were all spectacular. Some of our favorite sites were sites you included in our itinerary (from what I can tell, no one else knows to visit them!). We never would’ve have known about these sites if not for your recommendation. We can’t wait to do another international trip with Artisans of Leisure. The pre-planning, the execution, everything—this trip has been stress-free and exceptional. I can’t believe we’ve waited this long to take a trip like this!\n\n~ T.F., Houston, TX\n\nOur Greece trip was AMAZING!!!! We loved every hotel and tour. The food was delicious everywhere.

Additionally, you get the chance to chat with local people, learn about the culture, and get recommendations you don't find in the guide books.
