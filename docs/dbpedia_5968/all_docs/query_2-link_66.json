In order to accommodate twice the number of rear axles as well as the loading bay, the BRABUS XLP 800 6x6 Adventure features an extended frame courtesy of state-of-the-art simulation software. This exceptional conversion, in concert with a selection of signature BRABUS highlights, results in a total length of 6.23 meters.\n\nIn the front, the BRABUS front fascia commands attention – emphasizing the unmistakable accents set by a complete BRABUS Widestar exterior concept withs is confident appearance. Reinforced to accommodate any challenge with an integrated carbon fiber underride guard, BRABUS Adventure bull bar and an integrated rope winch boasting 4,500 kilograms of pulling force. The BRABUS carbon fiber Powerdome on the hood serves as an additional defining feature, accentuating the supercar’s signature character while the BRABUS wind deflector above the windshield perfects its rugged go-anywhere functionality. Designed to direct the airstream over the BRABUS Adventure roof rack that extends across the entire cabin, it provides excellent illumination of the terrain in front of the pick-up in the dark with four round LED headlights.\n\nBRABUS typical carbon fiber elements including custom BRABUS mirror caps, door handles and air inlets implemented just behind the cabin add further sporty accents along the sides of the BRABUS XLP 800 6x6 Adventure’s extended wheel base. Tailormade running boards featuring electronically extendable side-steps as well as integrated LED lights facilitate entry and exit. In the rear, the supercar’s thrilling looks are rounded off by a high-gloss sealed carbon fiber BRABUS logo trim as well as the BRABUS rear fascia, likewise complete with a custom carbon fiber underride guard for added protection.\n\nPower & Sound. YOUR GO-ANYWHERE ADVENTURE\n\nPrepare to be captivated by the earth-shattering symphony that resonates from beneath the hood, as the 4.0-liter V8 engine equipped with two BRABUS high-performance -turbochargers roars to life – unleashing a torrent of 588 kW and 800 hp of untamed strength. This colossal force propels the 6-wheeled behemoth from 0 – 100 km/h in just 5.8 seconds. To protect the heavy-duty all-terrain tires, the top speed was electronically limited to 210 km/h. 1,000 Nm of torque are released in precise harmony with the nine-speed automatic transmission, which can be shifted either automatically or manually – all at the driver’s leisure via the tailormade carbon fiber BRABUS paddle shifters on the steering wheel.\n\nThe BRABUS high-performance exhaust system perfects the BRABUS XLP 800 6x6 Adventure’s crescendo of pure adrenaline with an unmistakable V8 tone. Depending on the selected driving program, its integrated valve control technology delivers a variable sound experience ranging from the \"Coming Home\" mode’s discreet whispers and the breathtaking rumble of the “Sport” position at the push of a button. With two black-coated side-pipes in front of the rear wheels on either side of the adventure pick-up, the stainless-steel exhaust system also sets exciting visual accents. Finally, the system was developed to further optimize the vehicle’s power delivery by significantly reducing the exhaust backpressure.\n\nWheels & Chassis. BEYOND BOUNDARIES.\n\nPurpose-built to face the uncharted, both the front and rear axles of the BRABUS XLP 800 6x6 Adventure were designed as an independent suspension system – defined by the uncompromising ability of its three portal axles and an extensive selection of high-grade aluminum components. Created through the use of the latest in CNC technology, these include the completely new integral beam, the various axle links and reinforced housings as well as the suspension control arms featuring a BRABUS typical red paint finish. The sophisticated chassis geometry represents the elementary basis for the BRABUS XLP 800 6x6 Adventure’s outstanding off-road characteristics.\n\nAs you approach this giant of the uncharted, your eyes are immediately drawn to its six towering wheels – defying gravity and paving the way for an extraordinary experience beyond the beaten path. Developed for heavy-duty off-road action using the latest in high-tech forging and machining technology, the BRABUS XLP 800 6x6 Adventure is equipped with special 22-inch BRABUS Monoblock Z/HD wheels. A black signature finish adds an exclusive touch of BRABUS typical styling, resulting in the perfect symbiosis of striking 1-Second-Wow elegance and rugged dependability no matter where your journey may take you. In addition, all six wheels are connected to the BRABUS tire pressure control system, which allows for easy and precise fine tuning on any terrain you are likely to find – directly from inside the cabin.\n\nThe BRABUS XLP 800 6x6 Adventure was also fitted with special titanium-coated aluminum suspension – matched in its exceedingly robust design to the weight, the high center of gravity and the special six-wheel configuration. The damping is fully adjustable from the cockpit, ensuring you’ll be able to easily conquer anything from the deepest crevices to the tallest peaks.\n\nInterior. BREATH OF THE WILD.\n\nInside, the BRABUS XLP 800 6x6 Adventure pulls you into an entire world of bespoke interior luxury and mesmerizing elegance with its signature BRABUS Masterpiece interior – handcrafted to impeccable perfection at the BRABUS saddlery by our team of highly skilled specialists. Designed to impress in every single detail, a stylish combination of the finest black leather and Dinamica microfiber lines the pick-up’s cabin, creating a seamless blend between the spacious cockpit and the headliner. A unique BRABUS “Triangle” quilting pattern was integrated with surgical precision on the seat surfaces, the door panels as well as the foot wells – made even more eye-catching by contrasting red stitching and piping. The center sections of each seat have been perforated with surgical precision to ensure optimal efficiency of the integrated climate control system and maximum comfort.\n\nThe closer you look, the more there is to uncover. Over 206 individual cockpit elements including the switches, the speaker covers and air vents, as well as all trim panels and handles feature an unmistakable Rocket Red glazing. The same vibrant color scheme used to anodize the custom BRABUS door lock pins. The BRABUS “Heritage” brand pattern was brought into the design for a BRABUS typical touch of heritage – paying tribute to 1977, the year BRABUS was founded, with embossed “77” signets on the center console, the sun visors and the back pockets of the front seats.\n\nFinally, an extensive range of BRABUS carbon fiber elements accentuating the instrument panel, the door panels and the center console, carbon fiber pedal pads as well as carbon fiber door sill trims complete with an integrated LED backlit BRABUS logo that changes color in sync with the interior’s ambient lighting complement the go-anywhere pick-up’s extraordinarily sporty side.
