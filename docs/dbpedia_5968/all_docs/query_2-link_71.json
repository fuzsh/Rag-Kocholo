The Select Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:37 o'clock a.m., in Room SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, the Honorable Richard Shelby Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Shelby, Lugar, DeWine, Inhofe, Roberts, Allard, Kerrey of Nebraska, Glenn, Baucus and Robb. Also Present: Taylor Lawrence, Staff Director; Chris Straub, Minority Staff Director; Dan Gallington, General Counsel; Don Mitchell, Professional Staff; and Kathleen McGhee, Chief Clerk. Chairman Shelby. The Committee will come to order. Last year marked the 50th anniversary of the enactment of the National Security Act, the legislation that created the Central Intelligence Agency and established the national defense and intelligence structure for the Cold War era. This year, we approach an equally significant anniversary-- November 1999 will mark the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the beginning of the end of the Cold War, and the beginning of the post-Cold War era. Today, it is fitting that the Committee meet publicly, at the beginning of a new session of Congress, to hear the Intelligence Community's views regarding the nature and extent of the changing national security threats to the U.S. The identification and analysis of these threats are crucial to defining and conducting our nation's foreign policy. Our intelligence on these threats provides the basis for our defense strategy and planning, informs our budget and procurement choices, and supports our military forces when they go into action. To be useful, intelligence must be timely and, of course, accurate. Equally important, the Intelligence Community must ``call it as it sees it''--reporting the facts to policymakers without bias, even if the intelligence findings do not support a particular policy or decision. Every day, U.S. policymakers and military forces rely on Intelligence Community reporting. By its very nature, most of this information must be classified to protect the sources and methods from which it is derived. Today we meet in open session so that, at a time of waning interest in international affairs, the American people may learn about the very real threats that we face in the post-Cold War era. We look forward to hearing from Director Tenet and other witnesses on the broad range of threats to U.S. national security. Many of the issues we will discuss bear directly on critical policy choices facing the administration and the Congress today and in the near future, and raise a number of complex questions. For example: Once again, Iraq is refusing to allow UN inspectors full access to its weapons programs. How strong is Saddam Hussein within his own country that he can defy the international community? Is he, in fact, better off than he was before he instigated the current crisis over weapons inspections? What is the status of the Iraqi weapons programs? How quickly could these programs be expanded or revived if sanctions were removed? Is it true, as has been suggested in the press, that Iraq tested biological and/or chemical weapons on human beings? Will Saddam Hussein ever comply with the UN resolutions? And on the other side of the Shatt al Arab, we have Iran. Many of us saw Iranian President Khatami's recent television interview. What do his remarks then and subsequently--and the response of his hardline opponents--mean for US-Iranian relations? Most critically, has the Intelligence Community seen any reduction in Iranian support for international terrorism, or slackening in Iran's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, since the election? How soon will Iran deploy new ballistic missiles capable of threatening Israel and other U.S. allies? Iran of course is only one of more than a dozen or so countries which possess or are developing ballistic missile systems, and one of over two dozen nations that are developing weapons of mass destruction. I am extremely concerned of the potential that such weapons will be used, or that someone somewhere will plausibly threaten to use such weapons, against the United States, our troops, our allies or our interests in the not too distant future. After all, it has already happened--the single greatest loss of life by American forces in the Persian Gulf War came when an Iraqi SCUD crashed into a barracks in Saudi Arabia. How does the Intelligence Community assess the global ballistic missile threat to the United States--the greatest single threat to our national security? The Committee is looking forward to reviewing in the very near future the updated National Intelligence Estimate on this subject, but we hope the witnesses will provide us with a preview today. The 1995 National Intelligence Estimate of ballistic missile threats to North America was the subject of extensive, and in my view largely justified, criticism. What steps have been taken in the current intelligence estimative process to address those criticisms? In particular, I would be interested to hear how Iran's faster-than-expected progress in its missile program comports with the assumptions underlying both the 1995 National Intelligence Estimate and the planned update? And of particular concern to this Committee is the status of North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. How does the Community view the unfolding political, military and economic developments in North Korea? On another front, I would like to commend the Intelligence Community for its support for the arrest of suspected war criminal in Bosnia last week. Although that matter did not receive the attention that I believe its deserved, I know that your efforts were critical to the success of that operation. But tough questions remain: What are the prospects for a meaningful peace in Bosnia? When, if ever, will conditions there permit the withdrawal of US forces? What is the potential for a terrorist attack on US troops deployed in Bosnia and the region? On the terrorism front, I am pleased to note that the past year has yielded some significant successes, including the rendition and conviction of Mir Aimal Kasi, who killed two CIA employees outside CIA headquarters in 1993, and the recent sentencing of Ramzi Yousef for his role in the World Trade Center bombings and his plot to blow up U.S. airliners. However, numerous other terrorist threats remain--in Bosnia, in the Middle East, and around the world. These include both traditional state-sponsored terrorist groups, and other more independent actors such as Usama Bin- Laden. Furthermore, the murderers of 19 U.S. servicemen in the Khobar Towers bombing have yet to be brought to justice. I hope Director Tenet and Deputy Director Bryant today will provide us a status report on that investigation, including the cooperation of the Saudi government, and any indications of whether the government of Iran should be held responsible. Turning now to one of our most significant foreign policy and intelligence challenges of the 21st century: that is, China. I look forward to hearing the Community's assessment of the status of China's proliferation of nuclear, missile, chemical, biological and advanced conventional weapons technologies to Iran, Pakistan, and other countries. But today, we will also want to hear how China's extensive military modernization is complicating our ability to carry out military missions in support of key US interest in the region, as well as the extent and purpose of China's nuclear force modernization. Nearly a decade after the end of the Cold War, the United States continues to face a serious counterintelligence threat. We look forward to hearing from Deputy Director Bryant on the extent and the sources of this threat. In particular, we hope the FBI will be able to share with the American public its findings to date with respect to allegations that the Chinese government has attempted to illegally influence the American political process. We are also interested in the recent revelation that a former US government physicist passed classified information to the Chinese government, and in other Chinese government intelligence activities aimed at the United States. While China poses new challenges for the U.S., Russia still remains the only nation with the power to destroy the United States with intercontinental ballistic missiles. The security of Russia'snuclear arsenal, and the integrity of Russia's nuclear command and control systems, are of vital importance. So too are Russian sales of missiles and other technologies of mass destruction to Iran and elsewhere. We look forward today to hearing your assessments of the nature and extent of these programs. In addition to the traditional threats of a massive nuclear attack, terrorism, espionage, and the proliferation of advanced weaponry, we face new threats to our critical information infrastructure from hostile states, terrorism groups, and organized crime. Recall the enormous disruption to the northeastern United States and Canada caused by recent power outages. These disruptions were caused by an ice storm. Imagine if a computer operator in Tehran or Pyongyang could create the same havoc and confusion--or worse--with a few keystrokes. We look forward to hearing the Intelligence Community's current assessment of these threats. US businesses today also face an unprecedented level of industrial and economic espionage. A recent report cited in the Los Angeles Times estimated that U.S. businesses lost $300 billion worth of information in 1997 alone. We look forward to hearing from Deputy Director Bryant on the extent of this threat--the countries involved, their methods, and what US technologies are most at risk. I have spent enough time outlining my concerns and raising questions regarding threats to the United States--it is time to hear from the real experts--our witnesses. Without objection, our four witnesses will submit their written testimony for the record. Director Tenet will begin by giving his statement. After Director Tenet's opening statement, he will be joined, as I think he already is, at the witness table by: FBI Deputy Director Bob Bryant, Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research Phyllis Oakley, and Lt. General Patrick Hughes, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. These witnesses will provide their perspectives on the current and projected threats to US national security. They have all submitted written testimony to the Committee, although not necessarily in a timely fashion, and so they will be asked to give brief summaries of their written testimony. We will then open the session to 5 minutes of questions from each Member of the Committee, based on the order in which Members have entered the hearing room. At 2:30 p.m. this afternoon in the Committee's hearing room, SH-219, the Committee will meet in a closed session to discuss classified matters related to threats posed to the national security of the United States. Director Tenet, Deputy Director Bryant, Assistant Secretary Oakley, and General Hughes--I want to thank you all for appearing before us today. Today's hearings mark the frst time that the FBI has been asked to participate in our annual threat hearings, and representMrs. Oakley's first appearance before our Committee in her new capacity. We look forward to hearing your perspectives on these important issues. Senator Kerrey. Vice Chairman Kerrey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would first just ask that my full statement be included in the record. Chairman Shelby. Without objection, it is so ordered. [The prepared statement of Senator Kerrey follows:] Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Open Hearing on World Wide Threats Thank you, Mister Chairman. The Committee is starting out on the right foot with this very important hearing. I join you in greeting our witnesses, and in giving a special welcome to Secretary Oakley in her first appearance before the Committee in her new position. Secretary Oakley was born in Omaha, Nebraska, so her success was a foregone conclusion. This is also the first appearance of the FBI at this annual hearing, and I welcome Deputy Director Bryant. In measuring threats, we must resist the politician's natural tendency to follow the CNN curve, the pull of the international crisis of a particular moment. We must take the long view and prioritize the threats in terms of the life of our nation, the lives of our citizens, and the livelihoods of our citizens. We should also make this assessment in full awareness that Americans don't feel very much threatened today, at least not from external sources. The threats are more subtle now but they must still be identified and watched and deterred. The cycles of history or our short-term preoccupation with other matters do not absolve us of this duty. If preserving our life as a nation is the first priority, then Russia's nuclear weapons are still the first threat. The U.S. Strategic Command continues to deter the use of those weapons and our intelligence could have no more important topic. Nine years after the fall of the Berlin Wall I am disappointed we have not done more to reduce this threat further. The Russians have not done enough, either. Action is overdue. The Russian Duma should ratify START 2 promptly, and then we should discuss de-alerting the weapons of both sides together. Beyond deterring the other side's nuclear forces, these weapons have no purpose. But as long as they exist, we'll need all the intelligence on them we can get. The proliferation of nuclear weapons--and also chemical and biological weapons--is a growing concern. When proliferation links up with terrorism, we could face a high-order threat. Regional conflicts such as the Yugoslav war of the early 90's or the chronic instability of the Persian Gulf represent threats in the sense that the U.S. military could be in combat there at any moment. The foreign threats affecting the greatest number of Americans are probably the illegal drugs and accompanying crime coming from south of the border. Our interest in the stability and prosperity of a democratic Mexico, a Mexico which can stop the drugs and crime before they get here, has never been greater. This is about keeping Americans safe. Two events of 1997, the Asian economic crisis and the Kyoto summit on global warming, represent trends which are not traditional threats but which can certainly affect the livelihoods of Americans. I look forward to our witnesses' views on how much effort the intelligence community should devote to these topics. I want to highlight some of my concerns about intelligence as we start this session of Congress. First, we must act this year to reverse a fifty year trend and reduce government secrecy, including intelligence secrecy. It is not only a question of saving the cost of creating and keeping these millions of secrets. My goal is for the American people to understand how necessary your work is and how well you and our intelligence professionals do it. I want to counter the presumption that everything you do is somehow sinister. It can't happen unless we tell the people more. Also, we can't keep the secrets we must keep unless we get the classification system under control and throw the excess, unnecessary secrets overboard. The Committee has scheduled a hearing on the Moynihan-Helms secrecy legislation, and I look forward to it. The opposite of secrecy is openness, and I want to see the government and the public benefit from greater openness. All Americans, not just policymakers and military commanders, need information about our world to make decisions. I would like to see much more declassified information, including images, available to the public. The Intelligence Community should also be getting more of its information from open, unclassified sources. In addition, a new set of sources, the American commercial imagery industry, will soon have products available to respond to many of the demands of intelligence customers. I hope you will make use of them. I also challenge you to find more intelligence technologies with applications to benefit citizens. NIMA made a great start with image interpretation technology which could also help doctors detect breast cancer. But there is much more to be done and I urge you to redouble your efforts. We have not forgotten the whistleblower legislation which was dropped in conference with the House last year. In fact, the Committee will have a hearing on it next week. This legislation is about the right of Congress to know, the right of government employees to come to Congress with evidence of wrongdoing, and ability of both branches of government to keep necessary secrets from leaking. We will pass it this year. After our questions about the threats have been asked and answered today, I ask each of you to carry back to your agencies our appreciation for what your people do. They are striving in anonymity to keep our country safe, to keep policymakers informed, to give our warfighters the edge, and some of your people take significant risks. The overwhelming majority of them do this work in full accordance with American law and American values. If there were less unnecessary secrecy, more Americans would know that. Thank you, Mister Chairman. Vice Chairman Kerry. Mr. Chairman, I would say this as well to the public, that one of the questions that very often is asked is why, and the Chairman alluded to it--why do we have an open hearing on threat assessment. And I believe it is important to do so in order to engage the American people in a discussion, in a debate about what the threats are to this country and to hear especially from the Executive branch policymakers, how they prioritize the threats to the people of the United States of America. America, as a consequence of our leadership position of the world, sometimes gets called upon to do things that we perhaps would prefer not to do. Leaders always do get called upon to do things that they perhaps would prefer to fall to somebody else. We're an open society. We take sides in international conflicts. We're involved extensively in trade. Nearly a third of all the new jobs created in America today are created as a consequence of sales abroad. So there are lots of reasons for the United States of America to be engaged with the world, and lots of reasons, as a consequence, for us to be at risk. We're a target for very many reasons. And as I see it, your work has two parts--one, and most importantly, to provide accurate intelligence to the policymakers, particularly to the Commander in Chief, so that their decisions are good and so that their decisions enable them to prevent a conflict. The best war we ever fight is the one we avoid as a consequence of getting there ahead of time and with diplomacy preventing it from happening; or to deter, as a consequence of believing that somebody is not going to be able to be persuaded; or to organize a military effort; or to increasingly get to the bottom of some situation such as Khobar Towers, where we have been under attack and we then have to find out who it was that has done something against the United States of America. So good intelligence can reduce cost and increase the likelihood of success. I had the pleasure of working with General Hughes prior to him taking over at DIA and the organization of the takeover authority of Bosnia. And unfortunately, all Americans didn't have an opportunity to see the value of intelligence in making that operation a success. Back in the Ice Age, when I was in the Vietnam War--and General Hughes probably has similar experiences--there were many things that we probably could have got done if we had similar kind of intelligence. Our war fighters are much better prepared, much more able to get the job done, much more likely to be successful. There are things that America can do today. I know, with pride, the President's been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. I suspect that he, like I, would say that an awful lot of the success of that operation was due to the fact that we were able to get our war fighters good intelligence, enabling us to say, here's what you have done, here's what you haven't done, and as a consequence, get the warring parties to abide by the Dayton Peace Agreement. The most difficult thing for us to do is to prioritize the threats, however. It's very easy to get sort of drug around in this town in the current following the latest story, the latest news event, especially in the last week. We've all been in this black hole of conspiracy theories. And it is very important for you to come to us and orient us to the most important threats. And as I see them, as the Chairman said, there's only one threat that can still take every single citizen of the United States of America to their grave, and that's a nuclear weapon. And, I, for one, would have preferred the President to have talked about that last night in the State of the Union. It's been eight years since the Soviet Union fell apart. It's been seven years since August of 1991, when the coup was unsuccessful inside of Russia. We still don't have the Duma ratifying START II. I don't hear a vision of where we're going to go with nuclear weapons. The proliferation of nuclear weapons are clearly a major problem for us. And retargeting would be very easy for the Russians to do. It seems to me that if you look at the threat that can still take every single American down and the cost of maintaining and the difficulty of maintaining with the nuclear test ban in place, it seems to me that that ought to be top of the list, and we ought to be trying to figure out what it is, what's our strategy, what's our plan of attack to reduce that threat to the people of America. As I said, proliferation of all things--all matters--I was pleased with the President's very strong statement last night about Iraq. He went right to camera, right to Saddam Hussein, right to the people of Iraq, saying that we're not going to give you the capacity to use weapons of mass destruction again. We're going to prevent that from happening. However, we all know that until this dictatorship is gone, it's not likely that we're going to feel safe and secure. It's likely you're going to see a repeat of this kind of behavior in the future. I'm pleased, Mr. Bryant, to have you here for the first time. As I look at the radar screen of threats to us, increasingly they're non-rational threats. You can't negotiate with terrorists that aren't sent out by their government. Certainly, we still have nations that are funding terrorism throughout the world. But increasingly, we find, whether it's the kind of thing that the chairman is alluding to with information warfare or other kinds of terrorist activity, especially those associated with the movement of drugs into the United States of America, these are not being run by governments. They make corrupt governments, and they make governments less stable, and they may create problems for us in lots of ways. But these are non-rational threats and much more difficult to deal with, as a consequence. And I hope as well in your testimony, Mr. Bryant, Mr. Tenet, that you'll talk to us a little bit about your plans to resolve the conflicts over this encryption legislation. It is tied up in Avogadro's number of committees up here that have some sort of jurisdiction. Everybody has got a point of view on it. Almost none of us understand the technology. It is a very important issue from the standpoint of the U.S. economy, from the standpoint of U.S. values, of openness and personal freedom. But I'm also very much aware that if we want to make the American people continue to feel safe, you and NSA and others that have the responsibility of accumulating intelligence have to be able to somehow deal not just with a complexity of signals, but increasingly encrypted signals that are impossible for us to break. Next, I would say this committee intends to hold a hearing on the legislation that has been introduced by Senator Helms and Senator Moynihan on secrecy. Not only are the American people our customers from the standpoint of making them safer; they're our customers from the standpoint of informing them. This is government of, by, for the people; if they suspect we're withholding information, as we did for a short time, with the National Reconnaissance Office building just to protect our own mistakes, it's likely that they will suspect us, and it's likely, as a consequence, they're not going to give us the support that we need to keep those secrets that are essential for the security of this country. So we've got to make certain that this classification system is done in a fashion that protects national security, in order to protect the safety and security of the American people, and not just there as a consequence of our desire to have the American people not see how occasionally we can make mistakes and be stupid and do things wrong. The American people cannot make good decisions unless they are informed. As I said at the beginning, if the United States of America is going to lead, our people have to make good decisions. And increasingly, they are having to make decisions with open-source information. And I believe that though it's very tricky ground, I think that the creation of NIMA gives us the opportunity to use images in an open fashion to help the American people make better decisions. And I hope, Mr. Tenet, that we're able to over the course of the next couple of years get the American people to understand that they are our customers--their safety, their security and their capacity to make good decisions. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this open hearing, and I look forward to the testimony. Chairman Shelby. Senator Inhofe. Senator Inhofe. Thank you very much. I think I caught everything that Senator Kerrey said. And everything I can remember, I do agree with. This hearing is taking placeat the same time--at 10:00 o'clock we're having a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on essentially the same thing. And I have no choice, I have to be there. But I was a little distressed last night in the hour and 20 minutes, we never did hear anything about what's happened to our ability to defend ourselves, the nature of the threat that's out there. And I think that's far more critical than anything else that I heard last night. Mr. Chairman, when you talked about the problems in Iraq and when are we going to--are we going to see any cooperation from Saddam Hussein, or when are we going to, I don't think we are. I think our head is in the sand if we think that we're going to get cooperation that he's going to do anything that he doesn't have to do. And as far as Iran is concerned, we do know there is--that Iran does have weapons of mass destruction. There's a communication and a transfer in trading of technology and systems between both China and Iran and Russia and Iran. And I really want to pursue this. Senator Kerrey said, when he talked about the fact that we are a target--and I agree with that--but he also asked the question about having this as an open meeting. I think it's very, very important to have this out in the open so that the people of this country can get over this euphoric idea that the Cold War is over and there's not a threat out there. There's a huge threat out there and a threat that we're going to have to face. I see some good things happening. I was very pleased when Secretary Cohen came out and now is talking about over 25 nations with weapons of mass destruction--biological, chemical and nuclear--and the fact that we don't have a nuclear--a defense system, a missile defense system. He also talked about VX gas, that Saddam Hussein has enough to kill every man, woman and child on the face of this earth in 60 minutes. That's huge. That's very significant. Unfortunately, I won't be able to stay for this meeting, but I will be there at 2:30 and want to pursue this. I have such a high degree of confidence in Director Tenet that I'm very glad that at this very treacherous moment in our history, that he is at the helm of our intelligence community. I would, finally, say that I think that having open meetings like this are helping a lot. Prior to the recent sex scandals, virtually every national weekly publication has come out with articles talking about the threat that we're facing and our inadequate defense system. So, I will be here at 2:30 and look forward to the closed session. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Shelby. Senator Lugar. Senator Lugar. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for calling the hearing in such a timely way, and I join you and Senator Kerry in welcoming the witnesses. I would just underline, again, a theme that was picked up by you and Senator Kerry and Senator Inhofe. You alluded, Mr. chairman, to the thought that there appears to be a waning interest in foreign and security affairs. That is clearly not true of this Committee or of the panel that we have before us or those who have joined us in this hearing in the audience. I would have appreciated, as all now have pointed out, if the President had outlined--at least as the most crucial set of facts facing our country--our security and our military position. I think that really is essential, and we are working with the cooperative threat reduction situation in Russia with the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici program in this country right now in a quiet way, city-by-city, to prepare our citizens for what might be a terrifying threat--biological or chemical weapons conveyed by means other than missiles, by human beings, to those communities. The most dire threats right now to Americans, they come in unconventional forms, and the Intelligence Community that is represented here today is our major bulwark, because information, uncovering, revelation of this, prompt activity, coordination with state and local authorities, may make a very large difference in the saving of American lives in a way that we do not often think about as we think about more dramatic foreign adventures. So we look forward to this as a very, very important step in commencing our Committee's work this year. And I thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for your diligence in making certain we are on the job--literally the morning after the State of the Union. Chairman Shelby. Senator Baucus. Senator Baucus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I thank you and particularly our witnesses. It is important that we establish this precedent of having as our first hearing a threat assessment. I think it's a good way to start the year, and again I compliment you and the Vice Chairman for beginning the year this way. As we look at threats, though, I think it's important--as has been indicated by other Senators--that the definition of threat has various meanings. It's changed and evolved over the years. We no longer concern ourselves only with traditional military threats as we did, say, during the Cold War. Rather we're now concerned, in addition, with more subtle threats. They may not be as dangerous as that presented by the Soviet Union--certainly the threats during the Cold War--but we must deal with them very clearly. Let me give an example. Last month, I visited the Philippines, Brunei, Thailand and Indonesia to investigate the financial crisis that's affecting that region. Now this may seem remote to some people, but it's not. In the last 100 years, we fought seven foreign wars, and five, in part or in whole, were in Asia. But due to the political stability created by growth and prosperity in Asia, along with our military presence in the region, none of them happened in the last 20 years. But a prolonged period of high unemployment, high inflation and recession could turn the clock back with very serious implications for us. At present, we also see very different responses to the crisis in different Asian countries. One interesting point is that democracies seem to be proving more capable of addressing the crisis than authoritarian countries. A second point is our failure to predict that economic troubles in Thailand could, within days, cause an Asian-wide financial crisis that's also affecting not only America but the rest of the world. Now this is not a swipe at the Intelligence community, because neither the Congress, banks or Asian governments themselves did any better. They did not anticipate this or take measures to correct it. But I wonder what we can learn and how we can do better in the future? And I also hope to hear our witnesses' views on other questions. What is the outlook in Asia? What are the short and long-term implications of this crisis for the United States? And how well are the respective governments poised to respond to the challenges that they face? Finally, by focusing on the economic questions, I do not want to imply that the military threats have disappeared. They have not. As my colleagues have mentioned, the threat of nuclear weapons remains. We have American soldiers keeping the peace in many part of the world. Other American military units are watching the bad actors like Saddam Hussein. Intelligence plays a crucial role in protecting them from the unexpected and preparing them to act decisively when we must. I am sure our witnesses will cover these issues in detail, and I look forward to their testimony during this hearing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Shelby. Senator Allard. Senator Allard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like other Members of this Committee, I'd like to thank you for the hearing. I think it is appropriate that we do have public hearings from time to time to remind the American public that we still have some very dangerous spots in this world and by no means is it--could we consider it a safe world. Information plays a vital point in how we shape public policy and many of the decisions that we have made in this Committee as well as the Administration has to make. So I am looking forward to this hearing. I think the gathering of information certainly has to occur with the cooperation of both domestic as well as foreign agencies. So I'm glad to see you put together this panel for us this morning so we can hear their perspective. I think we also have to realize that what is happening in the world of intelligence is many--corresponds in many regards as what is happening in just the regular business world out there as far as high technology and as far as drugs are concerned. And I think the drugs in many cases become an international currency, and I think our keeping track of what happens with the--in the international markets, as far as illegal drugs are concerned, leads to many other discoveries. And so not only does it help from a domestic standpoint in trying to control the use of illegal drugs, but I think it gives us a better feel of what is happening in the international area. So I'm going to keep my remarks brief, Mr. Chairman. I'm looking forward--because I want to hear what the panel has to say. And I'd like to associate myself with your remarks and those of my colleague from Oklahoma. I do believe that we live in a dangerous world, and we need to work hard to stay on top of it, and we shouldn't take anything for granted, and just because we have no major powers out there other than ourselves, I think. But we do have a lot of hot spots, and they can create a lot of instability in the international environment. So thank you, Mr. Chairman, and we'll listen to the panel. Chairman Shelby. Senator DeWine. Senator DeWine. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for holding these hearings, and I'll waive my opening statement. Chairman Shelby. Director Tenet, before your testimony begins, I have one brief administrative comment to make just for the record. During the first session of Congress, I was disappointed, and others on the Committee, in the performance of the Intelligence Community in the timeliness of their responses to questions for the record propounded by Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Of the 31 sets of questions submitted to you and others over at the CIA, our hearings last session, 74 percent of the responses were received late with an average tardiness of over 24 days. And there are at least four sets of questions from hearings back in September and October that are still outstanding. That's a long time. In addition, the community does not seem--the Intelligence Community--to be respectful of rule 8.5 of the Committee that requires witnesses to submit a copy of their written testimony at least 72 hours in advance of their appearance before the Committee. For example, we received your testimony, Director Tenet, for today's hearing only 16 hours ago. And General Hughes' final testimony was not received until just a few moments ago. Director Tenet, as a former staff director for this Committee, I'm sure you may have even written the rule. I'm sure you're well aware of the need to provide this Committee with timely information so that the staff can adequately prepare the members for hearings such as this. I hope that you and the other leaders in the Intelligence Community will work with the Committee to improve this in the second session of Congress, and I believe you will. Director Tenet. Mr. Chairman, you're right. We'll do better. Chairman Shelby. Okay. Director Tenet, you may proceed, as you wish. [The prepared statement of Director Tenet follows:] Statement of Director of Central Intelligence George J. Tenet Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to address the Committee again this year on the worldwide threats to our national security. I have submitted a detailed Statement for the Record and would like to summarize its key points in my opening remarks. Before plunging into the details, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to step back for a moment and put the threats to our security into a broader strategic context. Scholars and pundits, as you know, are still struggling to capture the essence of this post-Cold War world we live in, but no one, in my view, has quite put their finger on the things that make it uniquely challenging for US interests. From the perspective of an intelligence officer, Mr. Chairman, I think it comes down to three words: complexity, scope, and speed. Let me explain what I mean. I say complexity because, as my testimony will make clear, the dangers facing the United States today--ranging from chemical warfare to terrorism, regional crises, and societal turmoil--are linked in unprecedented ways and frequently span multiple countries or continents. Dealing with them therefore requires multiple intelligence disciplines, along with the combined tools of diplomacy, law enforcement, and the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), internationalterrorism, drug trafficking, information warfare and, most recently, the fallout from the Asian financial crisis. Second, Mr. Chairman, the stakes remain high for the United States in countries like China and Russia as they struggle through unprecedented political and economic transformations. Third, are the challenges facing us from countries that continue in the post-Cold War era to view the United States with varying degrees of hostility or suspicion--Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Sudan, and in a more complicated way this year, Iran. Fourth, we are challenged still by regional trouble spots that could flare into conflict, whether in the Middle East, South Asia, the Aegean, or Bosnia. Fifth, we must continue to be alert to humanitarian emergencies-- caused by natural disasters, ethnic conflict, and foreign government mismanagement--that emerge rapidly and place heavy demands on U.S. military and financial resources. challenge i: transnational issues Mr. Chairman, in today's world few events occur in isolation, and national boundaries are much less reliable shields against danger. Emblematic of this new era is an assortment of transnational issues that hold grave threats for the United States. That is where I would like to begin today. Proliferation.--I am most concerned, Mr. Chairman, about the proliferation of WMD because of the direct threat this poses to the lives of Americans. Despite some successes for U.S. policy and U.S. intelligence, technologies related to this threat continue to be available, and potentially hostile states are still developing and deploying WMD-related systems. Efforts to halt proliferation continue to be complicated, moreover, by the fact that most WMD programs are based on technologies and materials that have civil as well as military applications. Finally, a growing trend towards indigenous production of WMD- related equipment has decreased the effectiveness of sanctions and other national and multinational tools designed to counterproliferation. Chinese and Russian assistance to proliferant countries requires particular attention, despite signs of progress. My statement for the record provides the details but some key points should be made here. With regard to China, its defense industries are under increasing pressure to become profit making organizations--an imperative that can put them at odds with U.S. interests. Conventional arm sales have lagged in recent years, encouraging Chinese defense industries to look to WMD technology- related sales, primarily to Pakistan and Iran, in order to recoup. There is no question that China has contributed to WMD advances in these countries. On the positive side, there have recently been some signs of improvement in China's proliferation posture. China recently enacted its first comprehensive laws governing nuclear technology exports. It also appears to have tightened down on its most worrisome nuclear transfers, and it recently renewed its pledge to halt sales of anti- ship cruise missiles to Iran. But China's relations with some proliferant countries are long- standing and deep, Mr. Chairman. The jury is still out on whether the recent changes are broad enough in scope and whether they will hold over the longer term. As such, Chinese activities in this area will require continued close watching. The Russian proliferation story is similar. On paper, Russia's export controls specifically regulate the transfer of missile-related technologies as well as missile components. But the system has not worked well, and proliferant countries have taken advantage of its shortcomings. Iran is one of those countries. When I testified here a year ago, Mr. Chairman, I said that Iran, which had received extensive missile assistance from North Korea, would probably have medium-range missiles capable of hitting Saudi Arabia and Israel in less than ten years. Since I testified, Iran's success in gaining technology and materials from Russian companies, combined with recent indigenous Iranian advances, means that it could have a medium range missile much sooner than I assessed last year. Following intense engagement with the United States, Russian officials have taken some positive steps. Just last week Prime Minister Chernomyrdin issued a broad decree prohibiting Russian companies from exporting items that would be used for developing WMD or their delivery systems--whether or not these items are on Russia's export control list. If it is enforced, this could be an important step in keeping Iran from getting the technology it needs to build missiles with much longer ranges. Without minimizing the importance of Russia's response, Mr. Chairman, I must tell you that it is too soon to close the books on this matter. Russian action is what matters, and therefore monitoring Russian proliferation behavior will have to be a very high priority for some time to come. Mr. Chairman, in focusing on China and Russia, we should not lose sight of other proliferators. North Korea is the most notable here, as it continues to export missile components and materials to countries of proliferation concern. Likewise, Mr. Chairman, in focusing on Iran's acquisition of WMD technology--as we should since it is one of the most active countries seeking such materials--we cannot lose sight of other proliferants. Iraq retains the technological expertise to quickly resurrect its WMD program if UN inspections were ended. Syria continues to seek missile-related equipment and materials. Despite the UN embargo, Libya continues to aggressively seek ballistic missile-related equipment and materials. Despite the UN embargo, Libya continues to aggressively seek ballistic missile-related equipment, materials, and technology. Asian Economic Instability.--Moving on to a very different transnational challenge, Mr. Chairman, the recent financial troubles in Asia remind us that global markets are so interconnected--and that economics and politics are so intertwined--that economic problems in one country can have far reaching consequences for others. At the root of this crisis is a confluence of economic, social, and political factors. Soaring growth and financial systems that lacked adequate regulation led to a speculative boom. Lending decisions by banks and finance companies ignored fundamental economic risks and when export growth began to slow regionally in 1995, corporate borrowers had trouble repaying loans. Faced with high levels of short term debt and limited foreign exchange reserves, Thailand first and then Indonesia and South Korea were forced to devalue their currencies. Because of the high level of economic integration and reaction of investors, the currency crisis spread rapidly to other countries in the region. The crisis has been difficult to resolve, in part because governments must take some politically risky steps like closing weak banks and shelving projects that will add to unemployment The current troubles in Asia will, of course, have economic costs for the United States--most important, a reduction in US exports to the region. But the troubles also carry political risks. Social tensions which we already see in Indonesia and other states in the region, are likely to increase as prices go up for things like food and fuel, and as unemployment rises. International Terrorism.--Turning now to terrorism Mr. Chairman, I must stress that the threat to US interests and citizens worldwide remains high. Even though the number of international terrorist incidents in 1997 was about the same as 1996, US citizens and facilities suffered more than 30 percent of the total number of terrorist attacks--up from 25 percent last year. Moreover, there has been a trend toward increasing lethality of attacks, especially against civilian targets. The most recent examples, of course, are the suicide bombings in Israel in 1996 and 1997 and the attacks on tourists in Luxor, Egypt last November. Perhaps most worrisome, we have seen in the last year growing indications of terrorist interest in acquiring chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. In addition, a confluence of recent developments increases the risk that individuals or groups will attack US interests. Terrorist passions have probably been inflamed by events ranging from the US Government's designation of 30 terrorist groups to the conviction and sentencing of Mir Aimal Kasi and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef as well as the ongoing US standoff with Iraq and frustration with the Middle East peace process. Among specific countries, Iran remains a major concern, despite the election of a more moderate president. Since President Khatami assumed office in August, Iran has continued to engage in activities, such as support for Hezballah and its Palestinian clients, that would not require his specific approval. Iraq, Sudan, and Libya also bear continued watching, both for their own activities and for their support of terrorist organizations. International Narcotics.--Turning to the international narcotics threat, I must tell you, Mr. Chairman, that the illicit drug industry is adapting to the counterdrug successes that we and other governments have had in recent years. Most worrisome, the narcotics underworld is becoming more diverse and fragmented. In addition, traffickers are infusing their business with new technologies to enhance their operations, hide their illicit earnings, and improve their security. Mr. Chairman, I do not mean to downplay the impressive progress that has been made against drug traffickers, especially those that deal in cocaine. You know of the arrest of the Cali kingpins in Colombia--which has disrupted long-held smuggling patterns there and forced traffickers still at large into hiding. Drug interdiction efforts in Peru, once the world's leading producer of the leaf used to make cocaine, have seriously damaged that country's drug economy and led to a 40-percent decline in cultivation over the last two years. The cocaine trade, however, is still a formidable challenge--thanks to the industry's ability to adapt. Our success against the Cali kingpins has nurtured smaller groups that now dominate trafficking through the Caribbean. Violent Mexican drug cartels are exploiting the Cali mafia's setbacks to wrestle away a greater share of the international drug business. Despite declines in Peru and Bolivia, coca production continues to expand in southern Colombia--where the new ingredient is the involvement of insurgents who tax drug profits to fund their war against the state. I'm also concerned, Mr. Chairman, about developments in international heroin trafficking. Worldwide production of opium--the source of all refined heroin-- continues at record levels. And heroin traffickers are exploiting weak enforcement institutions in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to expand traditional heroin smuggling routes from the Golden Crescent and, to a lesser extent, the Golden Triangle regions. International Organized Crime.--As for international organized crime, the globalization of business and technology have given crime syndicates unprecedented opportunities for illicit activities. Yet law enforcement authorities often remain constrained by national sovereignty and jurisdictions. Trends that cause us the greatest concern are: An increasingly sophisticated financial system that includes emerging financial secrecy havens, stretching from islands in the Caribbean to the South Pacific. A broader array of seemingly legitimate businesses that serve as fronts for criminal enterprise. The increasing role of gray arms brokers in arming rogue states, terrorists, and criminal groups. The activities of arms brokers make it even more difficult to judge when such actions are supported by governments and when they are not. Information Warfare.--As you know, Mr. Chairman, all of this is occurring in what we all call the ``Information Age.'' With that in mind, it is clear that foreign entities are aware that an increasing proportion of our civil and military activity depends on the secure and uninterrupted flow of digital information. In fact, we have identified several countries that have government- sponsored information warfare programs underway. It's clear that those developing these programs recognize the value of attacking a country's computer systems--both on the battlefield and in the civilian arena. In addition, I believe terrorist groups and other non-state actors will increasingly view information systems in the United States as a target. Mr. Chairman, let me assure you that we are increasing our efforts to uncover information warfare activities. We are also developing the tools needed to improve our ability to detect and counter information warfare attacks. This is an enormously complex, sensitive, and innovative endeavor, Mr. Chairman, that will require insights from law enforcement and the private sector in order to fully succeed. challenge ii: russia and china in transition Moving beyond these transnational issues, Mr. Chairman. I want to focus for a moment on a second major challenge: the still unsettled state of affairs in key countries like Russia and China--one time Cold War adversaries who now have the potential to be major partners. Russia Today we see hopeful signs that the seeds of democracy and a free market economy sown in Russia just a few years ago have taken root. Moreover, Moscow cooperates with the United States and the West in ways that were unimaginable during Soviet times. But whether Russia succeeds as a stable democracy, reverts to the autocratic and expansionist impulses of its past, or degenerates into instability remains an open question. The answer will depend in large part on how Russia copes with several major challenges. Democratic political institutions while developing, are not yet deeply rooted. The executive branch and Communist-dominated Duma often deadlock, while crime and corruption threaten to undermine confidence in political and economic reform. Russia has implemented many economic reforms and achieved a measure of economic stability, but long-term steady growth is still dependent on other reforms--namely ensuring that economic activities are governed by the rule of law. The Russian military, meanwhile, continues to suffer from serious social and economic difficulties. Finding the wherewithal to pay the retirement costs of over 250,000 redundant military officers will be a particular challenge. Despite these difficult times for the military, Russia retains a major nuclear arsenal--some 6,000 deployed strategic warheads. As long as there is even the slightest doubt about future political stability in Russia, those weapons must be a major preoccupation for US intelligence. We must also remain mindful that Russia continues a wide-range of development programs for conventional and strategic forces. Finally, while Russia continues to seek close cooperation with the United States on matters of mutual concern, it is increasingly strident in opposing what it sees as US efforts to create a ``unipolar'' world. And Moscow continues to place a high priority on keeping others from gaining undue influence in the New Independent--especially in the energy rich Caucasus and Central Asia. China Turning now to China, the leadership there was a clear goal: the transformation of their country into East Asia's major power and a leading world economy on a par with the United States by the middle of the 21st Century. It is too soon to say what this portends, Mr. Chairman--whether China in the future will be an aggressive or a benign power. What is clear, though, is that China will be an increasingly influential player--one what will have the capacity to, at a minimum, alter our security calculus in the Far East. Hong Kong's 1997 reversion to Chinese rule was peaceful but involved important changes to the political system. The Chinese Government disbanded the existing legislative council and installed a hand-picked provisional legislature. A key question now is whether new legislative elections scheduled for May will be free and fair. Cross-strait relations with Taiwan are still tense, China has not renounced the use of force and is placing its best new military equipment opposite Taiwan. Chinese military modernization remains a key leadership goal. China is increasing the size and survivability of its retaliatory nuclear missile force is taking important steps toward building a modern navy capable of fighting beyond China's coastal waters. Finally, Mr. Chairman, the post-Deng Xiaoping leadership shows no signs of abandoning Communist political ideology, although it has committed itself to market-oriented economic reforms. These are eroding State control over major sectors of the economy as well as over the daily life of many Chinese citizens. challenge iii: regional troublemakers Mr. Chairman, I would like now to turn to states for whom the end of the Cold War did not mean an end to hostility to the United States. Iran Among these countries, Iran in many respects represents the greatest challenge we will face over the next year. It appears to us that a genuine struggle is now underway between hardline conservatives and more moderate elements represented by Iran's new President Khatami. And so the challenge is how to cope with a still dangerous state in which some positive changes may be taking place--changes that could, and I stress could--lead to a less confrontational stance toward the United States. Khatami's strongest card is his electoral mandate--a 70 percent vote representing mostly youth and women, as well as ethnic and religious minorities in Iran. Since assuming office in August, he has made limited but real progress toward fulfilling his campaign pledges for political and social reforms. He gained approval for a new cabinet that puts his people in key posts such as the ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Islamic Culture. Censorship is now less oppressive, with previously banned periodicals reappearing and socially controversial films being shown. And against this backdrop, there is even renewed debate about a central tenet of the revolution--rule by a supreme religious leader. Progress is likely to be fitful, however, and hard-line elements remain formidable obstacles. They still control the country's defense and security organizations, for example, and therefore exert heavy influence on issues most vital to the United States. Statements by Khatami and his foreign ministry suggest he is trying to play a more constructive role in the international community. It is simply too early to tell, however, whether this will lead to demonstrable changes in Iranian policies that matter most to the United States. We have seen no reduction in Iran's efforts to support Hizballah, radical Palestinians, and militant Islamic groups that engage in terrorism. Moreover, even as it attempts to improve its international image, Tehran is continuing to bolster its military capabilities. Iran is improving its ability potentially to interdict the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz. It has acquired KILO-class submarines from Russia and is upgrading its antiship-missile capabilities. And, as I noted earlier, Iran continues its efforts to acquire the capability to produce and deliver weapons of mass destruction. North Korea Turning to North Korea, we also face a more complex challenge than last year--some progress but in the face of a worsening economic and social situation and a continued real military threat. The North is still observing the terms of the Agreed Framework that directly relate to freezing its nuclear reactor program. The IAEA has maintained a continued presence at Yongbyon since the May 1994 refueling of the reactor, and P'yongyang and the IAEA continue to discuss steps the North needs to take to come into full compliance with its safeguards commitments. Amidst these signs of progress, however, a combination of economic stagnation and social decay continues to raise doubts about North Korean stability. North Korea's spreading economic failure is eroding the stability of the regime of Kim Chong-il. Industrial and agricultural output continues to drop. The North's most recent fall grain harvest was far less than the 4.5 million tons the North needs to meet even minimal rations. Crime, corruption and indiscipline, including in the security services and military, are increasing, and people are more willing to blame Kim Chong-il for their plight. While Kim reportedly is aware of the economic problems and their impact on soldiers and civilians, his legitimacy remains closely tied to his father's legacy. As a result, P'yongyang likely will avoid an avowedly reformist agenda and will try to package any reform experiments in traditional ideological terms. As such, significant improvements in the economy do not seem to be in the cards. Its economic weaknesses notwithstanding, North Korea retains a military with the capability to inflict serious damage on South Korea and the 37,000 US troops deployed there. The North's offensive posture along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) means that it could go to war with little additional preparation. And North Korea's long-range artillery and surface-to-surface missiles near the DMZ, some of which could deliver chemical warfare agents, can hit forward defenses, US Military installations, airfields and seaports, and Seoul. Iraq Mr. Chairman, Iraq, under Saddam, continues to present a serious threat to US forces, interests and allies. Our principal aim must be to ensure that Saddam does not have weapons of mass destruction or the capacity to regain any he has lost. As my statement for the record points out in greater detail, we assess that Iraq continues to hide critical WMD production equipment and material from UN inspectors. Continued UN sanctions can keep pressure on his regime and cast uncertainty over Saddam's hold on power. But, as you know Mr. Chairman, Saddam is pushing more aggressively than last year to erode the sanctions regime. More than seven years of sanctions have had a devastating effect on Iraq's economy. Inflation is soaring, the civilian infrastructure is deteriorating, and the Iraqi population continues to suffer from high rates of malnutrition and inadequate services--in part because of Saddam's manipulation of relief supplies. Key regime officials and support organizations remain largely immune to the harsh living conditions facing the general population and even live off revenues generated through illicit trade--a fact that engenders resentment and poses an underlying threat to Saddam and his family. While its military force continues to slowly deteriorate under UN sanctions and the arms embargo implemented after the Gulf War, Iraq remains an abiding threat to internal oppositionists and smaller regional neighbors. challenge iv: regional trouble spots Mr. Chairman, I propose again this year to provide you a brief description of where we stand in several potential ``hot spots.'' As I did last year, I will focus on the situation in the Middle East, South Asia, and Bosnia. Middle East With regard to the Middle East, Mr. Chairman, my bottom line message must be that the region is more volatile and more troubled than when I testified here last year. Many of the threats I have discussed today intersect in the Middle East, where the historic strife and distrust that mark the region are now aggravated by the spread of sophisticated weapons programs, an upsurge in terrorism, and demographic trends that point to heightened social tensions. Against this backdrop, the peace process has foundered, with dangerous implications for all of the parties. Iraq, as noted earlier, continues to defy the international community's effort to deny it the means to again commit aggression. And some of the fixed points have begun to change, Iran in particular, but not so conclusively as to permit a dropping of our guard. Meanwhile, world demand for imported energy will ensure the region's strategic importance, along with the active, and sometimes competitive, engagement of many nations. In short, Mr. Chairman, the period ahead is one of enormous challenge for the United States as it seeks to ensure stability, prosperity, and peace in this most critical of regions. South Asia In South Asia, relations between India and Pakistan remain poor. The long-standing dispute over Kashmir remains a major sticking point. A modest India-Pakistan dialogue is underway, though progress is certain to be slow and subject to abrupt setbacks. We cannot be sure this tentative dialogue will continue when a new Indian government assumes office after national elections in March. The stakes of conflict are high, because both countries have nuclear capabilities and have or are developing ballistic missile delivery systems. Although Indian and Pakistani officials say deterrence has worked for years, it would be at risk in a crisis. Bosnia and the Balkans Turning to Bosnia, Mr. Chairman, the story is progress but with significant remaining challenges. On the positive side, developments in recent months have somewhat improved the prospect for Dayton implementation. The emergence in the Republika Srpska of a government backed by Muslim and Croat deputies is a breakthrough that--if sustained--could accelerate the pace of Dayton implementation. At the same time, the High Representative is using his new authority to impose solutions on the parties to reinforce central institutions. Bosnia's military forces remain demobilized with their heavy weapons stored in sites that are regularly inspected by SFOR. Furthermore, each army has significantly reduced its heavy weapons under the Dayton-mandated arms control agreement. Iran has terminated its military aid and training in Bosnia and has focused its involvement on economic assistance. Although Bosnians are a long way from regaining their pre-war standard of living, significant economic growth has resumed and unemployment is starting to decline. Relatively little progress has been made, however, in implementing minority returns and other provisions of Dayton relating to freedom of movement and resettlement. The OSCE goal of 220,000 returns in 1997 was only about half met, and the bulk of those who did return went to majority areas. Looking to the future, most Bosnians recognize that continued international engagement is essential for keeping the peace. Such involvement is required to continue weakening the hardline nationalists who are obstructing Dayton, and national elections in 1998 might increase the political clout of opponents of the nationalists who currently dominate the three communities. In addition, a number of volatile issues could still disrupt the gradual process of reconciliation. These include the Brcko arbitration decision--postponed last year but expected in March and the UN's stated goal of returning 50,000 refugees to minority areas during the first six months of 1998. In addition, continuing mutual distrust between Muslims and Croats will hamper the effort to create a functioning Federation. I must also note the threat of instability in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo, where animosity remains high between the 90 percent Albanian majority and the local Serbian residents. There is increasing support for violence as a way to resolve the situation. The Aegean Turning to the Aegean, there is reason for increased concern about tensions between Greece and Turkey, particularly in the wake of the EU summit decision to proceed with membership negotiations with Cyprus-- while rebuffing Turkey's application--and the expected arrival of SA-10 air defense batteries from Russia this summer. Ongoing disputes over air and sea delineations in the Aegean have also heightened long- standing Greek-Turkish animosity. challenge v: humanitarian challenges Mr. Chairman, last year I concluded my briefing by discussing with you the challenge posed to US citizens and interests by humanitarian crises whose origins often go back many years but which can escalate with dramatic suddenness. I regret to say that the dimension of this challenge remains unchanged. The totality of the problem is similar to that I described last year 34 million people worldwide unable to return to their homes; more than 20 million internally displaced; 14.5 million refugees. As it was last year, Africa is the region most troubled by these crises--with attendant calls on US and UN resources to assist relief operations and attendant risks to US citizens caught up in violence. We have no reason to believe that 1998 in Africa will be any more stable than was 1997. The instability in central Africa that led to the overthrow of governments in Zaire and Congo (Brazzaville) last year lingers, and it is probably only a matter of time until serious problems erupt again in Burundi and Rwanda. Apart from ethnic and political conflict, for the coming months the impact of El Nino, particularly in southern and eastern Africa, will bear careful watching--especially water shortages and consequent food scarcity. concluding comments I hope these and the other challenges I have discussed with you today illustrate why I opened these remarks by referring to complexity, broad scope, and speed as the touchstones of this new era. These challenges will require the most sophisticated intelligence collection and analysis that we can produce. Only by continuing to invest in this kind of effort can the Intelligence Community play the role it must in protecting American lives, guarding American interests, and sustaining American leadership. Thank you Mr. Chairman, I would welcome your questions at this time. Director Tenet. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I'm pleased to be joined today by my distinguished colleagues. The world we face today poses a complexity and scope of problems that I believe is unprecedented for the United States. The speed of technological change in the world magnifies these threats. I'm most concerned, Mr. Chairman, about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction because of the direct threat this poses to the lives of Americans. Despite some successes for U.S. policy and U.S. intelligence, technologies related to this threat continue to be available and potentially hostile states are still developing and deploying WMD related systems. Efforts to halt proliferation continue to be complicated, moreover, by the fact that most WMD programs are based on technologies and materials that have civil as well as military applications. Finally, a growing trend towards indigenous production of WMD-related equipment has decreased the effectiveness of sanctions and other national and multinational tools designed to counter proliferation. Chinese and Russian assistance to proliferant countries requires particular attention despite signs of progress. My statement for the record provides the details, but some of the key points should be made here. With regards to China, its defense industries are under increasing pressure to become profit making organizations, an imperative that can put them at odds with U.S. interests. Conventional arms sales have lagged in recent years, encouraging Chinese defense industries to look to WMD technology-related sales, primarily to Pakistan and Iran, in order to recoup. There is no question that China has contributed to the WMD advances in these countries. On the positive side, there have recently been some signs of improvement in China's proliferation behavior. China has recently enacted its first comprehensive laws governing nuclear technology exports. It also appears to have tightened down on its most worrisome nuclear transfers. And it recently renewed its pledge to halt sales of anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran. But China's relations with some proliferant countries are longstanding and deep, Mr. Chairman. The jury is still out on whether the recent changes are broad enough in scope and whether they will hold over the longer term. As such, Chinese activities in this area will require continued close watching. The Russian proliferation story is similar. On paper, Russia's export controls specifically regulate the transfer of missile-related technologies as well as missile components. But the system has not worked well and proliferant countries have taken advantage of its shortcomings. Iran is one of those countries, Mr. Chairman. When I testified here a year ago, I said that Iran--which had received extensive missile assistance from North Korea--would probably have medium range missiles capable of hitting Saudi Arabia and Israel in less than 10 years. Since I testified, Iran's success in gaining technology and material from Russian companies, combined with recent indigenous Iranian advances, means that it could have a medium range missile much sooner than I assessed last year. Following intense engagement with the United States, Russian officials have just taken some positive steps. Just last week, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin issued a broad decree prohibiting Russian companies from exporting items that would be used for developing WMD or their delivery systems--whether or not these items are on Russia's export control list. If enforced, this could be an important step in keeping Iran from getting the technology it needs to build missiles with much longer ranges. Without minimizing the importance of Russia's response, Mr. Chairman, I must tell you that it is too soon to close the books on this matter. Russian action is what matters, and therefore monitoring Russian proliferation behavior will have to be a very high priority for some time to come. Likewise, Mr. Chairman, in focusing on Iran's acquisition of WMD technology, as we should, since it is one of the most active countries seeking such materials, we cannot lose sight of other proliferants. My statement talks about Iraq, Syria and Libya. Moving on to the very different transnational threat that Senator Baucus talked about, the recent financial troubles in Asia remind us that global markets are so interconnected and that economies and politics so intertwined that economic problems in one country can have far-reaching consequences for others. At the root of this crisis is a confluence of economic, social and political factors. Soaring growth and financial systems that lacked adequate regulation led to a speculative boom. Lending decisions by banks and finance companies ignored fundamental economic risks. And when export growth began to slow regionally in 1995, corporate borrowers had trouble repaying loans. Faced with high levels of short-term debt and limited foreign exchange reserves, Thailand first, and then Indonesia and South Korea, were forced to devalue their currencies. Because of the high level of economic integration and reaction of investors, the currency crisis spread rapidly to other countries in the region. The crisis has been difficult to resolve--in part because governments must take some politically risky steps like closing weak banks and shelving projects that will add to unemployment. The current troubles in Asia will, of course, have economic costs for the United States. But the troubles also carry political risks. Social tensions--which we already see in Indonesia and other states in the region--are likely to increase as the prices go up for things like food, fuel and as unemployment rises. Turning to terrorism, Mr. Chairman, I must stress that the threat to U.S. interests and citizens worldwide remains high. Even though the number of international terrorist incidents in 1997 was about the same as 1996, U.S. citizens and facilities suffered more than 30 percent of the total number of terrorist attacks--up 25 percent from last year. Moreover, there has been a trend toward increasing the lethality of attacks, especially against civilian targets. The most recent examples, of course, are the suicide bombings in Israel in 1996 and 1997, and the attacks on tourists in Luxor, Egypt, last November. Perhaps most worrisome, Mr. Chairman, is the fact that we have seen in the last year growing indications of terrorist interest in acquiring chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. In addition, a confluence of recent developments increases the risk that US individuals or groups will attack US interests. Terrorists' passions have probably been inflamed by events ranging from the US government's designation of 30 terrorist groups to the conviction and sentencing of Mir Aimal Kasi and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, as well as the ongoing standoff with Iran and frustration with the Middle East peace process. Turning to international narcotics, I must tell you, Mr. Chairman, that the illicit drug industry is adapting to the counterdrug successes that we and other governments have had in recent years. Most worrisome, the narcotics underworld is becoming more diverse and fragmented. In addition, traffickers are infusing their business with new technologies to enhance their operations, hide their illicit earnings and improve their security. I do not mean to downplay the impressive progress that has been made against drug traffickers, especially those that deal in cocaine. You know that the arrests of the Cali kingpins in Colombia, whichhas disrupted long-held smuggling patterns there and forced traffickers still at large into hiding. Drug interdiction efforts in Peru--once the world's leading producer of the leaf used to make cocaine--have seriously damaged the country's drug economy and led to 40 percent decline in cultivation over the last two years. The cocaine trade, however, is still a formidable challenge thanks to the industry's ability to adapt. Our success against the Cali kingpins has nurtured smaller groups that now dominate trafficking through the Caribbean. The violent Mexican drug cartels are exploiting the Cali mafia's setbacks to wrestle away a greater share of the international drug business. Despite declines in Peru and Bolivia, coca production continues to expand in southern Colombia where the new ingredient is the involvement of insurgents who tax drug profits to fund their war against the government. I'm also concerned, Mr. Chairman, about developments in international heroin trafficking. Worldwide production of opium--the source of all refined heroin--continues at record levels. And heroin traffickers are exploiting weak enforcement institutions in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to expand traditional heroin smuggling routes from the Golden Crescent and, to a lesser extent, the Golden Triangle regions. As for international organized crime, the globalization of business and technology have given crime syndicates unprecedented opportunities for illicit activities. Yet law enforcement authorities often remain constrained by national sovereignty and jurisdictions. Trends that cause us the greatest concern are an increasingly sophisticated financial system that includes emerging financial secrecy havens stretching from the islands in the Caribbean, to the South Pacific; a broader array of seemingly legitimate businesses that serve as fronts for criminal enterprises and the increasing role of gray arms brokers in arming rogue states, terrorists and criminal groups. The activities of arms brokers make it even more difficult to judge when such actions are supported by governments and when they are not. As you know, Mr. Chairman, all of this is occurring in what we call the information age. With that in mind, it is clear that foreign entities are aware that an increasing proportion of our civil and military activity depends on the secure and uninterrupted flow of digital information. In fact, we have identified several countries that have government sponsored information warfare programs well underway. It's clear that those developing these programs recognize the value of attacking a country's computer systems, both on the battlefield and in the civilian arena. In addition, I believe terrorists groups and other non-state actors will increasingly view information systems in the United States as a target. Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about Russia and China and the transition they find themselves in. With regard to Russia, today we see hopeful signs that the seeds of democracy and a free market economy sown in Russia just a few years ago have taken root. Moreover, Moscow cooperates with the United States and the West in ways that were unimaginable during Soviet times. But whether Russia succeeds as a stable democracy, reverts to the autocratic and expansionist impulses of its past or degenerates into instability remains an open question. The answer will depend in large part on how Russia copes with several major challenges. Democratic political institutions, while developing, are not yet deeply rooted. The executive branch and communist dominated Duma often deadlock while crime and corruption threaten to undermine confidence in political and economic reform. Russia has implemented many economic reforms and achieved a measure of economic stability. But long term steady growth, is still dependent on other reforms, namely ensuring that economic activities are governed by the rule of law. The Russian military, meanwhile, continues to suffer from serious social and economic difficulties. Find the wherewithal to pay the retirement costs of over 250,000 redundant military officers will be a particular challenge. Despite these difficult times for the Russian military, Russia retains a major nuclear arsenal--some 6,000 deployed strategic warheads. As long as there is even the slightest doubt about the future political stability in Russia, those weapons must be a major preoccupation of US intelligence. We must also remain mindful that Russia continues a wide range of development programs for conventional and strategic forces. Finally, while Russia continues to seek close cooperation with the United States on matters of mutual concern, it is increasingly strident in opposing as what it sees as US efforts to create a unipolar world. And Moscow continues to place a high priority on keeping others from gaining undue influence in the newly independent states, especially in the energy-rich Caucasus in Central Asia. Turning to China, the leadership there has a clear goal-- the transformation of their country into East Asia's major power and a leading world economy on a par with the United States by the middle of the 21st century. It is too soon to say what this portends, Mr. Chairman, whether China in the future will be an aggressive or benign power. What is clear, though, is that China will be an increasingly influential player, one that will have the capacity to, at a minimum, alter our security calculus in the Far East. Hong Kong's 1997 reversion to Chinese rule was peaceful, but involved important changes in the political system. The Chinese government disbanded the existing legislative council and installed a hand-picked provisional legislature. The key question now is whether new legislative elections scheduled in May will be free and fair. Cross-strait relations with Taiwan are still tense. China has not renounced the use of force and is placing its best new military equipment opposite Taiwan. Chinese military modernization remains a key leadership goal. China is increasing the size and survivability of its retaliatory nuclear missile force and is taking important steps toward building a modern navy capable of fighting beyond China's coastal waters. Finally, Mr. Chairman, the post-Deng Xiaoping leadership shows no sign of abandoning communist political ideology, although it has committed itself to market-oriented economic reform. These are eroding state control over major sectors of the economy as well as over the daily life of many Chinese citizens. Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about Iran, because you mentioned it in your opening statement. Among the countries, Iran in manyrespects represents the greatest challenge we will face over the next year. It appears to us that a genuine struggle is now under way between hard-line conservatives and more moderate elements represented by Iran's new President Khatami. And so the challenge is how to cope with a still dangerous state in which some positive changes may be taking place, changes that could--and I stress could--lead to a less confrontational stance toward the United States. Khatami's strongest card is the electoral mandate, a 70 percent vote representing mostly youth and women, as well as ethnic and religious minorities in Iran. Since assuming office in August, he has made limited but real progress toward fulfilling his campaign pledges for political and social reforms. He gained approval for a new cabinet that puts his people in key posts, such as the ministries of foreign affairs, interior and Islamic culture. Censorship is now less oppressive with previously banned periodical reappearing and socially controversial films being screened. And against this backdrop, there is even renewed debate about a central tenet of the revolution--rule by a supreme religious leader. Progress is likely to be fitful, however, and hard-line elements remain formidable obstacles. They still control the country's defense and security organizations, for example, and therefore exert heavy influence on issues most vital to the United States. Statements by Khatami and his foreign ministry suggest he is trying to play a more constructive role in the international community. It is simply too early to tell, however, whether this will lead to demonstrable changes in Iranian policies that matter most to the United States. We have seen no reduction in Iran's efforts to support Hizbollah, radical Palestinians and militant Islamic groups that engage in terrorism. Moreover, even as it attempts to improve its international image, Tehran is continuing to bolster its military capabilities. Iran is improving its ability potentially to interdict the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz. It has acquired KILO-class submarines from Russia, and it is upgrading its anti-ship cruise missiles. As I noted earlier, Iran continues its efforts to acquire the capability to produce and deliver weapons of mass destruction. Turning to North Korea, Mr. Chairman, we also face a far more complex challenge than last year. Some progress, but in the face of a worsening economic and social situation and a continued real military threat, the North is still observing the terms of the agreed framework that directly relate to freezing its nuclear reactor program. The IAEA has maintained a continued presence at Yongbyon since the May 1994 refueling of the reactors, and Pyongyang and the IAEA continue to discuss steps the North needs to take to come into full compliance with its safeguard commitments. Amidst these signs of progress, however, a combination of economic stagnation and social decay continue to raise doubts about North Korea stability. North Korea's spreading economic failure is eroding the stability of the regime of Kim Chong II. Industrial and agricultural output continue to drop. The North's most recent fall grain harvest was far less than the 4.5 million tons the North needs to meet even minimal rations. Crime, corruption and undiscipline--including in the security services and military--are increasing, and people are more willing to blame Kim Chong II for their plight. While Kim reportedly is aware of the economic problems and their impact on soldiers and civilians, his legitimacy remains closely tied to his father's legacy. As a result, Pyongyang likely will avoid an avowed reformist agenda and will try to package any reform experiments in traditional ideological terms. As such, significant improvements in the economy do not seem to be in the cards. Its economic weaknesses notwithstanding, North Korea retains a military with a capability to inflict serious damage on South Korea and the 37,000 US troops deployed there. The North's offensive posture along the demilitarized zone means that it could go to war with little additional preparation. And North Korea's long-range artillery and surface-to-surface missiles near the DMZ, some of which could deliver chemical warfare agents, can hit forward defenses, US military installations, and airfields and seaports in Seoul. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I'll talk about Iraq. Iraq under Saddam continues to present a serious threat to US forces, interests and allies. As my statement for the record points out in great detail, we assess that Iraq continues to hide critical weapons of mass destruction equipment and material from UN inspectors. Continued UN sanctions can keep pressure on his regime and cast uncertainty over Saddam's hold on power. But as you know, Mr. Chairman, Saddam is pushing more aggressively than last year to erode the sanctions regime. More than seven years of sanctions have had a devastating effect on Iraq's economy. Inflation is soaring. The civilian infrastructure is deteriorating. And the Iraqi population continues to suffer from high rates of malnutrition and inadequate services--in part because of Saddam's manipulation of relief supplies. Key regime officials and support organizations remain largely immune to the harsh living conditions facing the general population and even live off revenues generated through illicit trade--a fact that engenders resentment and poses an underlying threat to Saddam and his family. While its military forces continue to slowly deteriorate under UN sanctions and the arms embargo implemented after the Gulf War, Iraq remains an abiding threat to internal oppositionists and smaller regional neighbors. Mr. Chairman, I'll stop there. I'll enter the rest of my statement into the record. There's much more ground to cover. Perhaps we would be best suited to do that in questions and answers. Chairman Shelby. Thank you, Director Tenet. I'll ask the other witnesses to briefly sum up their testimony--take five minutes or less. As I said earlier, your written testimony will be made part of the record in its entirety. Deputy Director Bryant of the FBI, we're glad to have you here. We understand that Judge Freeh, the director, is awaiting the imminent birth of his sixth son. Is that correct? Mr. Bryant. Yes, it is. He's at home with his family, and I think his sixth son is due at any moment now. Chairman Shelby. Well, we welcome you to the Committee. STATEMENT OF ROBERT BRYANT, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Mr. Bryant. I'll just take a few moments to summarize my statement. But I want to hit a few key points. We've seen a lot of changes in the world in the last dozen years. Many of them have made a better world for us. But certainly we have great challenges ahead of us. And before I get into specific threats, I just want to hit one issue. I'm speaking of encryption. This is a critical problem. It is here right now and is only going to get worse. Encryption has implications for our ability to combat every threat to national security that we see. Federal, state and local law enforcement officials unanimously agree that the widespread use of robust non-key recovery encryption will ultimately devastate our ability to fight crime and prevent terrorism. There are all kinds of views about this issue, but we see that this issue needs to be addressed very quickly because it's going to harm all of our abilities to do what is legal, ethical and for the best interests of the American People. I guess I would just say on the summary of the national threats, from a law enforcement perspective--the drug issue that faces the United States is a significant issue. We see it in all the investigations that the FBI has; we see it in all corners of our investigations. And it's of grave concern. Whether it's methamphetamines, cocaine, heroin or whatever, there's just great concern for that issue and what we're going to do about it. I guess the next issue I see is international terrorism. We certainly have, from the DCI's statement, an agreement. We have concerns over weapons of mass destruction and what they can do. The FBI currently has investigations directed toward these activities. Certainly, we've had help with legislation from this body and that has been tremendously helpful. But I consider this a priority that could have devastating consequences for this great nation. The next issue that I would go to would be international terrorism organizations and terrorism generally. The FBI looks at domestic terrorism as groups of individuals that are American citizens using violence to commit * * *--to change-- for social or political change. The domestic side of it is an issue with us. Certainly, the international side, as Mr. Tenet said, the state sponsors, certainly the organized federations, such as Hizbollah, Gama'at al-Islamiyyah, Hamas are areas where we're very concerned. I guess another issue I want to hit a little bit is this critical infrastructure protection. We have a society that's terribly dependent upon computers, and the service they perform for this nation. It's helped our economy. We're probably world leaders in computer technology. But it's also a vulnerability, and it could be used and is being used by criminals, by terrorists, by intelligence services and certainly by military services. And we have to basically put in the infrastructure and vehicles to protect this great nation from this type of attack. I guess I would just close and just say that certainly the espionage issues. We've had--numerous cases have been prosecuted in the last year. This is ever a threat that's been here for--since the beginning of time. It's still here. Chairman Shelby. Not getting any better, though, is it? Mr. Bryant. It's probably as serious as ever. Chairman Shelby. Okay. Mr. Bryant. Just in passing, on economic espionage, the Congress passed the economic espionage statute last year. This statute has certainly brought about a change in the way business is done, because our technology--we now have a law to protect it. There are prosecutions going forward. And this has been a great benefit, and can discuss this more in the question and answer. The only thing I would add, on the drug trafficking situation--there are foreign-based groups that are bringing vast amounts of drugs into this country. And ourself, the Intelligence Community, with the DEA and Customs and the whole government is trying to develop strategies to basically control this issue. I guess I would just close and say, on July 26, 1998, the FBI will celebrate its 90th birthday. The FBI has been a remarkable institution for many reasons, but not the least of which its ability to change and evolve and face growing threats. And we serve--we serve you all, we serve the American people, but we see numerous threats that I've just enumerated and hope we're part of the solution. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Freeh follows:] Statement of Louis J. Freeh, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation Good morning Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman Kerrey and Members of the Committee. I welcome this opportunity to be part of this distinguished panel to discuss threats to U.S. National Security. The overriding concern now facing law enforcement is how rapidly the threats from terrorists and criminals are changing, particularly in terms of technology, and the resulting challenge to law enforcement's ability to keep pace with those who wish to do harm to our nation and our nation's citizens. This is why the encryption issue is one of the most important issues confronting law enforcement and potentially has catastrophic implications for our ability to combat every threat to national security that I am about to address in my statement here today. Law enforcement remains in unanimous agreement that the widespread use of robust nonrecovery encryption ultimately will devastate our ability to fight crime and terrorism. Uncrackable encryption is now and will continue, with ever increasing regularity, allow drug lords, terrorists and even violent gangs to communicate about their criminal intentions with impunity and to maintain electronically stored evidence of their crimes impervious to lawful search and seizure. Other than some type of key-recoverable system, there is currently no viable technical solution to this problem for law enforcement. This is not a problem that will begin sometime in the future with theoretical implications. In many impo"
