It was forced on them by the Russian Imperialists— Grand Duke Nicholas, Isvolski, Sazonoff, Sukhomlinoff, and as­ sociates in control of Russia.

The happiness and future peace of the world re­ quire the reconciliation o f the German and French people. FOREW ORD In the summer of 1923 in Europe there fell into my hands at Paris the work of Rene Marchand— Un Livre Noir— containing the secret dispatches between the Russian Foreign Office and Isvolski, the Ambassador of Russia at Paris imme­ diately preceding the W orld W ar. In London I obtained de Sieberts’ publication of the like secret dispatches between the Russian Foreign Office and Benckendorf, the Ambassador of Russia at London. M y interest was thus aroused and every book available on the subject was studied because it was perceived that the Allied Propaganda that they had fought unselfishly for demo­ cratic principles and to establish justice and right in inter­ national affairs had greatly deceived the people of the United States. It became perfectly obvious that the theory that the Czar was leading the fight to make the world safe for Democracy was ludicrous. These Secret Dispatches showed that the theory that the war was waged in defense of American ideals was untrue. They also proved that the theory that the Entente Allies were fighting a war to defend themselves and the United States from the criminal design of William II to dominate the world by military force was false. Vl ll FOREWORD It became clear that a few leaders of the Entente Allies had instigated and launched the war inspired by the mixed motives of imperialistic ambitions, greed for commercial and political power, future security, revenge, hate, love of secret diplomacy and intrigue, believing that the war would be quickly ended, that the profit would be great and the future enjoyment of such illicit gains well protected. When the Records had been studied, the evidence and my conclusions were presented to the American People in the United States Senate, December 18, 1923. M y action was moved alone by my love for the people of the United States, feeling that it was my duty as a matter of loyalty, to disclose to them the truth, even if I seemed quite alone. N ow that European interests are vigorously declaring by a second great American Propaganda that it was “ Our War ” as a basis for cancelling the W ar Debts, it has seemed worth while to put in a compact form the evidence to show it was not “ Our W ar,” and to show the Common People of all the nations that they have been the victims of imperial intrigue and unwise leadership, and that they should, by democratic processes, defend themselves in future against the secret di­ plomacy and intrigue of unintelligent officials.— R.

T h e P roblem The most gigantic conspiracy of all time in its conse­ quences was the intrigue of the Russian Imperialists, who deliberately and intentionally brought about the World W ar in 1914. Isvolski was the evil genius chiefly responsible for the final explosion. The object was the control of Constantinople and the Dardanelles, over-lordship in the Balkans and the seizure of German and Austrian territory. The motive was imperial greed for power, political, com­ mercial and financial. The German territory lay between Russian and French territory with no adequate natural defensive boundaries. The German theory was that they must be strong enough to prevent successful attack by Russia and France. The German leaders prepared against war and greatly feared it. They knew the terrible odds against them. They hoped their preparedness would keep the Russian leaders from attacking. Their hopes proved to be vain. An intimate study of the causes of the World W ar and its 1 TH E RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY 2 results shows that the common peoples of Europe did not will aggressive w a r; that they were patriotic, brave and de­ termined to defend their own homes, but they did not have the will to invade their neighbors’ territory for profit. The people of the belligerent nations were trained in the art of war and made to believe it a virtue to cultivate the spirit of a soldier. Militarism was common to all. A ll the people involved were, probably 90 per cent, or more, innocent of wrong purposes, and they were all, whether victorious or defeated, the victims of this tragedy. O ver thirty-seven million people suffered death or muti­ lation, and other unrecorded millions disappeared. Six mil­ lion died from civil strife and forty million from consequent epidemics; hundreds of millions suffered indescribable sor­ rows and anxiety. own. It was through no conscious fault of their They merit compassion. Whenever the people realize the great truth that they were misled, that they were deceived by propaganda, that they were all alike victims of the errors of unwise leadership, it may be possible for them to understand each other and to feel sympathy rather than hate, and understanding and good will may be established. Imperialists profited by international hate and promoted it. They taught autocracy was necessary for war defense and that the safety of the people required intensive military preparation and centralized power. The German Kaiser occasionally rattled the sword and cultivated militarism while declaring himself the guardian mtmrnm INTRODUCTION of peace. The czar built up a huge army. 3 Austria, Serbia, France, Italy, developed their arms to the extent of their taxing power. The people all went to the battlefields of death with cour­ age and loyalty, praying to God to bless the cause for which they were making the supreme sacrifice. The history of their sufferings is the history of their credulity and patriot­ ism. The spirit of excessive nationalism, militarism and im­ perialism built up through centuries, was the atmosphere which made this war possible, but the deliberate plans of the Russian Imperial conspirators, who clearly saw the possi­ bility, made it a certainty. The Russian Foreign Office leaders willed and planned the war, and unhappily found in the ambition of the Serbian leaders and in the fears, hates and ambitions of a very few French leaders the material which made the conspiracy brilliantly successful, as an in­ trigue, but a hideous and ghastly tragedy in the final issues. It is doubtful if one Frenchman in ten thousand had any knowledge that Poincare was deliberately leading France to war. Neither the Russian nor French government really believed that the German government intended aggressive war on them but the military preparedness of Germany and the bombast of some of its chauvinists laid a convenient but false foundation for the French and British propaganda that the German leaders had plotted the brutal military con­ quest of the world. The reconciliation of the French and German people, their mutual heartfelt moral disarmament is essential to phys- 4 TH E RUSSIAN IM PERIAL CONSPIRACY ical disarmament; their mutual respect and good-will are vital to their future peace and the future peace of Europe and the world. Valliant Coutourier, member of the French House of Dele­ gates, in accusing Raymond Poincare of having been respon­ sible with the Russian leaders for having caused the war, did so “ on his honor as an old French soldier” ; and so “ on my honor as a long-time member of the United States Senate, I record the accusing evidence in this book and my pro­ found conviction that the conclusions are absolutely sound, assuring those who read these lines that they have been written as the result of careful study, entirely free from any conscious prejudice or ill will, even against those be­ lieved directly responsible for unloosing the W orld W ar, without any desire to stigmatize them, but with the purpose of making the truth known in order that the people may be ultimately reconciled to each other when they can better understand each other. W ith this book goes a prayer that it may be of some use in establishing understanding, truth and good will. R .L.O . “ To sin by silence when we should protest Makes cowards out of men. The few who dare must speak and speak again T o right the wrongs of men.” “ There is no competent and informed historian in any country who has studied the problem of the genesis of the World W ar in a thorough fashion who does not regard the theory of war guilt held H a m INTRODUCTION 5 in Articles 227 and 231 in the Versailles Treaty to be wholly false, misleading and unjust.” ( “Genesis of the W ar,” H. E. Barnes— 679.) “ Never before in the whole history of historical writing has there been so rapid and complete a change in the opinions of historians con­ cerning an event of major importance as has been witnessed in the revision o f our conceptions concerning the causes of the outbreak of the W orld W ar in August, 1914.” (ibid. 713 ) II. T h e E v id e n c e The American people are the descendants, almost exclu­ sively, of the European people. Their immediate ancestors are British, German, Scandinavian, Dutch, Russian, French, Italian, Greek, Spanish, etc., but the American people, sepa­ rated by three thousand miles of water, have been too busy with their own affairs to search out the truth with regard to the origin of the late war. Indeed, the truth itself was completely hidden from sight, first because the archives were profoundly secret, then further obscured by willful false­ hood and by a flood of propaganda against the German people, as well as against the German Government. This propaganda was useful to the Entente Powers and their allies. It enabled them to borrow ten billion dollars from the United States, and finally to receive the military and naval aid of the United States, and its powerful financial and commercial support when the German Command con­ ceived it to be necessary as a war measure to submarine American ships. Fortunately for the world, the overthrow of the absolute monarchy of the Czar of Russia put into the hands of the 6 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY revolutionary government all of the secret Russian archives which have now been largely published, and from which the world has been able at last to ascertain the actual truth as to the infinitely dangerous intrigues of a few statesmen of Russia, France, Serbia, Great Britain, etc. W ith the overthrow of William II the German records were opened wide by the Socialists, who had expected to find the leaders of the German Empire under William, guilty of willing the war. They found their leaders did not will the war. The seizure of the Belgium records disclosed the secret archives of Belgium. The overthrow of the monarchy in Austria resulted in a republican government, which made complete exposure or publication of the records of Austria. In Great Britain under their parliamentary system, im­ portant portions of the truth have been made public through parliamentary inquiries and demands, and their Foreign Office records will now be opened to public knowledge. The French records have not been opened, but partly falsified when published. A s a consequence of these extremely important disclo­ sures, the refusals to disclose and falsifications, there no longer remains any reason why the truth should not be known. The truth is known to the historians and scholars of the world. The most important of these secret records is first a book containing 858 secret dispatches passing be­ tween the Russian Foreign Office and the Russian Embassy at London, entitled “ Entente Diplomacy and the W orld,” by Benno de Siebert (Secretary of the Russian Embassy at London, England), Knickerbocker Press, New York, and f “ Un Livre Noir” , consisting of two volumes edited by Rene Marchand, published by the Librairie du Travail, Paris, 5 France, containing the secret dispatches between the Russian > Foreign Office and Isvolski, Russian Ambassador at Paris. . These two records are sufficient completely to disclose the 1 truth with regard to the launching of the World W ar, and the manner in which it was done. t These two books alone contain about 1,500 secret Russian dispatches. Very volu­ minous quotations from these dispatches will be found in 1 the Congressional Record of December 18, 1923 (PP- 355 f to 399). On page 397 (ibid) will be found Exhibit 20, the literature bearing upon this matter, together with a number 1 1 of books by French and other authors, which justify the conelusions which are set forth in this volume. (See Appendix.) Among very distinguished French scholars who have pointed out the responsibility of French and Russian leader- ^ ship for the W orld W ar will be found such men as Alfred Fabre-Luce (author of La Victoire), who is a scholar of distinction and a historical author. 3 e Victor Margueritte, a distinguished French writer, is responsible for obtaining the first 102 signatures of distinguished French scholars, s generals, authors, men and women of Letters, to an appeal s to the conscience of France, demanding modification of y Article 231, and also the abrogation of Articles 227 to 230 of the Treaty of Versailles (the sanctions), in which the 8 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY German leaders were charged with being exclusively re­ sponsible for the W orld W ar. Among the French authors who believed that the Ger­ man confession of war guilt was wrongfully extorted in Article 231 or that certain French and Russian leaders were responsible for launching the war will be found George DeMartial, Gustave Dupin, G. de Toury, A . Pevet, Emile Laloy, Rene Marchand, Colonel Converset, Alcide Ebray, Lazare, Victor Margueritte, Millon, Mathias Morhardt, A. Fabre-Luce, Ernest Renauld, Ernest Judet, J. Caillaux, Charles Humbard, et al. (See Supplement.) Among the British authors of like opinion appear E. D. Morel, J. M. Keynes, Francis Neilson, G. P. Gooch, G. Lowes Dickinson, Raymond Beazley, Edith Durham, Irene Cooper Willis, et al. Among the American authors of like opinion are Pro­ fessor Sidney B. Fay, Professor Harry Elmer Barnes, Pro­ fessor Ferdinand Schevill, Charles E. Tansill, historical ex­ pert, Library of Congress, E. F. Henderson, Frederick Bausman, W . L . Langer, James W . Thompson, et al. The Ex-Premier of Italy, Francisco Nitti, has written strongly to like effect in a number of volumes. The revision­ ist viewpoint is supported by such Italian scholars as Corrado Barbagallo, Augusto Torre and Alberto Lombroso. In Belgium the new views on war guilt are supported by such scholars as Alcide Ebray and V . de Brabandere; in Sweden by Dr. A a l; in Denmark by Dr. Karl Larsen- in INTRODUCTION 9 Holland by Dr. N. Japiske; and in Hungary by Eugene Horwath, Guillaume de Huszar and John Lutter. The overwhelming majority of opinion in Russia is that the Czar’s Government caused the war, and the succeeding governments gladly gave full publicity to all the secret Rus­ sian records from which this fact is demonstrated. From Serbia we have the “ Causes of the World W ar , by Dr. M. Boghitchevitch, who was the Serbian Minister in Paris and Berlin before the W ar, and fully confirms the Russian Conspiracy. In Canada we have John S. Ewart, K ing’s Counsel, who wrote “ The Roots and Causes of the Wars 1914-18” , after five years of intensive study, giving the evidence in great de­ tail and proving Russian and Entente responsibility. These historians from Allied countries are among the thousands of intellectuals throughout the world who now know this history. It must be remembered that Marchand s translation of the Black Book “ Un Livre Noir” , has never been published in English, and was only published in French in 1923, and yet this volume is the official record of secret telegrams proving clearly that the Russian leaders deter­ mined on this war, and took the successive persistent steps during a period of twenty-two years— 1892-1914— to bring it about. Under the United States Senate Resolution (1925) to collate the evidence on the origin of the World W ar, Charles E. Tansill, expert historian, was assigned the task and is now convinced of the Russian and French responsibility. His IO TH E RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY book has not been published as a Government document for reasons of diplomatic amity. A list of the more interesting bibliography is attached as an exhibit to this volume. A sweeping acknowledgment is made to these authorities for the evidence in this volume. III. W h y th e T ruth Is U nknow n. A natural question arises: “ How is it that a truth of such gigantic consequence has not been made known to all the world and freely recognized?” The answer is simple— These most secret archives were not published or known until some years after the war, and when they were disclosed, naturally those who had carried on the pre-war propaganda, and the war-time propaganda in which not only the German Government but the German people were bitterly denounced as the enemies of mankind, were not disposed to confess that they had been parties to an unsound propaganda against the German people. The international press, outside of Germany, had denounced the Germans as guilty of the crime of unloosing the war, and then charged the German troops with every crime in the calendar— cutting off the hands of babies, bayoneting women with child, crucifying soldiers, committing massacres on noncombatants; boiling their own dead to make glycerine for explosives, etc., etc., etc. Every artifice was used to make all the world hate the German name. These war-time accusations of wholesale atrocities are no II INTRODUCTION longer believed by informed people. All armies contain some individuals who exhibit atrocity during the terrible excite­ ment of war. The story of cutting off the children s hands was thoroughly investigated, and found untrue. The story of boiling the German dead to get the fat from their bodies was proved to be the confessed invention of a British offi­ cer. The press of the world, finding it embarrassing to re­ verse the views previously believed in, and by which the world was misled, seems to prefer the position that the question of war guilt was settled by the Treaty of V er­ sailles and need not be reopened. Ih ey, therefore, have failed as a rule to give publicity to the recently discovered facts or to take the labor and pains to investigate. For this reason, the people of the world have not had access to the truth except through books (such as those written by the authors to whom I have referred), whose circulation is small. The American press is a giant and has a giant’s responsi­ bility. Ultimately, when it knows the truth, it will do its full duty. Another obstacle to the knowledge of the evidence is Entente official opposition. The Treaty of Versailles (A r ­ ticle 231) had compelled the German leaders to accept com­ plete responsibility for the war. It was not a treaty of agreement. It was a treaty dictated by the victors, and the conquered Germans (over their vehement protests) were compelled to sign the confession of guilt under the threat, after they had disarmed, of being invaded and devastated 12 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY by war by the Allied armies. The German women and chil­ dren were suffering the extremities of death by starvation under an Allied embargo as a means of coercing German con­ sent to the dictated treaty. The Germans still strenuously protest they did not will the war. The Treaty of Versailles violated many of the 14 points under which President Woodrow Wilson and the Entente Allies obtained the German con­ sent to the Armistice. For these reasons, the governmental powers of Europe, outside of Germany, were unwilling to have any publicity given to the truth that a few Russian and French leaders had willed this war and forced it on the German leaders, on Europe and on the world. Therefore, the evidence has been largely suppressed by the leaders of the Entente nations. But the truth disclosed by the evidence cannot be kept permanently concealed, and the scholars of the whole world are now quite well advised with regard to the evidence. The facts set forth in this book are based upon the evi­ dence of the official records of the belligerent governments, and the particular records listed in Exhibit A will be found to completely justify every important statement made in this work. There are those who, accepting the facts of the evidence disclosed, still attempt to put the responsibility of the world war upon the German leaders on the theory that the Ger­ man leaders had no legal right to object to Russia’s exercise of her sovereign powers of mobilizing within her own bor­ ders ; that Russia had a legal right to mobilize within her own 13 INTRODUCTION borders and that until she actually invaded Germany the German leaders had no right to declare “a state of war exist­ ing” . But these apologists are compelled to confess that the military menace of Russian mobilization under secret con­ tract to attack Germany on an undefended frontier, with no natural boundaries and no adequate forces, exposed the German military leaders to absolute destruction, if they had failed to mobilize against such a military menace and recog­ nize it for what it was— war. The evidence shows that the general mobilization of Russia was itself a declaration of war, according to instructions given and understood by the Russian leaders, and, infinitely more important, the evidence now obtained discloses that there W A S a secret contract of 1892 (kept actively alive by annual secret military conference to 1914) between the Russian and French leaders simultaneously to attack Ger­ many “at the first indication” of Austrian mobilization. In 1892 Gen. de Boisdeffre, representing France, said to the Czar, in construing the Secret Treaty of that date which pledged Russia and France to attack Germany if one of the Powers of the Triple Alliance should mobilize: tion IS war.” Alexander III replied: “ Mobiliza­ “ That is as I under­ stand it.” The evidence shows that the German leaders made a strenuous effort to prevent the local conflict between Austria and Servia from leading to a general European war, and that the German leaders were not supported either in St. Peters­ burg, or Paris in this attempt to prevent a European war, 14 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY but were prevented from localizing the war, or adjusting it by a concert of the powers, by the Russian leaders. Austria intended a local war and was opposed to a general war. The war against Serbia into which Austria was deliberately incited by the ruinous intrigues of Serbia at the instigation of Russia was a trap into which Austria fell, not knowing it was fomented by Russia to create the pretext of general mobilization and war and to make Austria and Germany ap­ pear to the world as the wilful originators of the great conflict. But the Russian Imperialists are convicted by the secret treaties, military conventions, dispatches, documents and by the confessions out of their own mouths— for example ( 1914): Gen. de Boisdeffre— “ Mobilization is W ar.” Alexander III agreed that Mobilization is an act of W ar. Sazonoff, July 24.— “ This is the European W ar.” Sukhomlinoff, July 25.— “ This time we shall march.” Isvolski, August 1.— “ This is my war.” Grand Duke Nicholas’ wife, Anastasia, quotes code mes­ sage from her father, King of Montenegro (July 22) : “ W e shall have war before the month is out. Grand Duke Peter’s wife, Melitza (Anastasia’s sister), to Paleologue, July 22: “ You will get Alsace Lorraine back— our armies will meet in Berlin— Germany will be annihilated,” etc., etc., etc. General Dobrorolski, declared that the W ar was definitely determined, on July 25th. Pashitch, Serbian Premier, stated INTRODUCTION 15 July 31st that the Russian peace negotiations were merely to conceal W ar. The Russian General Palizyn confirms Pashitch see Supplement, Sec. 25 and 29. In 1916 SazonofT admitted that the World W ar was brought on in 1914 by the determination of France and Russia to humiliate Germany. Colonel E. M. House wrote to the President of the United States, from Europe May 29, 1914, (House, II, 248) : “ Whenever England consents, France and Russia will close in on Germany and Austria.” C H A P T E R II P R E -W A R T E N S IO N IN E U R O P E I. R u s s ia In the attempt to arrive at a just understanding of the factors making possible the W orld W ar, it is necessary to consider the psychology of the various then governing leaders of the nations occupying Europe. The Russian Government, under the Romanoff family, had gradually acquired powers of absolute monarchy over an area equal to about one-sixth of all the land in the world, and autocratic power over approximately 170,000,000 people speaking many languages and dialects. The policy of the Russian Government was to expand its power and its territory whenever and wherever possible. which led to the war with Japan. It was this policy It was this policy that made the Russian Government desire to exercise hegemony over the Balkans and led to the secret treaties with Serbia, and Bulgaria, setting up the Czar as an arbiter over Balkan disputes, having him pose as the protector of all the people of Slav extraction. The Russian Government deeply desired the control of Constantinople and the Dardanelles as an out- 16 let for the free passage in war of her battleships. Russia desired not only to exercise hegemony over the Balkans, but was secretly and intensively behind the Pan-Slav Movement, which had for its object the disintegration of the AustroHungarian Empire and the seizure ultimately of Austrian territory. Russia financed the Pan-Slav movement, especially using Serbia as the instrument, subsidizing the Serbian press and its officers for that purpose. The Russian imperialists were jealous of the German Em­ pire and coveted German and Austrian territory and nego­ tiated a secret treaty with the French leaders to take a part of it. To carry out these objects, Russia built up the greatest army in Europe, estimated by the Russian press in 1914 as containing 2,230,000 men ready for quick action, and having over 14,000,000 men subject to a call to the colors, accord­ ing to Dobrorolski, General in charge of mobilization. In order to carry out the ambitions of the absolute mon­ archy of Russia, not only were secret agreements made with Roumania, Bulgaria and Serbia, but, still more important, a secret agreement was made with the President of France in 1892, contemplating a simultaneous attack on Germany by Russia and France. In order to make this attack suc­ cessful, it was essential not only to build up the military and naval powers of Russia and France to a maximum, but it was also necessary to subsidize the Russian and the French press, and persuade public opinion of the honor, patriotism and wisdom of the Russian government in its alleged policies, the real policies never being exposed. l8 TH E RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY The terrible cruelty and corruption of the Russian military autocracy had built up in Russia a very widespread, deepset revolutionary spirit, of which the belligerent section ap­ peared through organized nihilism. It was believed by many of the governing officers of Russia that a general war against aliens would excite the patriotism of the Russian people and consolidate them behind the government. Even­ tually after Russia’s collapse in the World W ar, this revo­ lutionary spirit in Russia proved to be more hostile to the Romanoff autocracy and supporting intelligencia than it wras to the alien enemy. It turned on the imperialists with de­ structive ferocity, tearing down the old standards of govern­ ment and even the State religion. The Bolshevik regime with Lenine followed. In the spring of 1914, Russia through France finally had arrived at a gentleman’s agreement with the British Gov­ ernment, through Edward Grey. man’s agreement with Italy.

B alkan S tates The Balkan states, Roumania, Bulgaria and Serbia, and Turkey and Greece, during the several years preceding the W orld W ar had engaged in three different wars, all of them inspired by a spirit of militarism and imperialism, seek­ ing to obtain advantages, commercial and political, at the ex­ pense of their neighbors.

I .......— --------— THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY 20 When the W orld W ar came on, it was an important part of the strategy of Russia and France to make Germany and Austria appear as the aggressors, in order that Italy would have the justification of refusing to co-operate with Germany and Austria. This plan worked out successfully through the Pan-Slav movement, the murder of the Archduke of Austria and the violent propaganda carried on in Serbia against Austria. This political intrigue accomplished its in­ tended purpose and led Austria, through the grief of the Emperor’s household and the indignation of the Austrian Court, to the conviction that Austria was justified in the use of stern measures to secure guarantees against Servia. Austrian ultimatum and mobilization followed. The The ultimatum given by Austria to Serbia, the instant military measures of Serbia, Russia, France and Belgium and the war which was declared to exist by Germany on August i, 1914, enabled the Italian Government to refrain from supporting Austria and Germany on the allegation that Germany and Austria were the aggressors and aggrieved— that they had first declared war. not the A famous Frenchman, Montesquieu, said a great while ago that: “ The true author of a war is not he who declares it, but he who makes it necessary.” The European diplomats thoroughly well understand this doctrine, but the mass of mankind did not understand it or its intimate application when the W orld W ar was made to come by Russian mobilization and influence. PRE-WAR TENSION IN EUROPE IV . 21 F rance The French people are largely of Latin extraction, inter­ mingled, however, with the blood of the North. They are a proud and excitable race, intelligent, artistic, of great social grace, with a language of the highest degree of mental refinement. There is no society in the world more charming than that of the best French circles. Their architecture, paintings, literature are models of beauty and the admiration of the world. They have had a very warlike history. seem to rejoice in “ Glory” . They Their leaders seem to favor militarism, though disclaiming it. When the French Revolu­ tion was followed by Napoleon, Napoleon conquered nearly all of continental Europe, and was adored by the French, who still honor his memory as the greatest of all Frenchmen. His tomb is a Mecca. In 1870, the French Emperor, Na­ poleon III, declared war against Germany, and in a few months the Germans dictated a humiliating peace to the French at Versailles, imposing a tax of a billion dollars on the French, and taking over the government of Alsace-Lor­ raine, which became a terra irredenta and a poisoned thorn in the side of sensitive France. This all gave birth to the doctrine of “ Revanche” or revenge, which finally bore ter­ rible fruit. Raymond Poincare was born in Lorraine, and long before he had the opportunity of power, and came into the presi­ dency of France (19 12 ), he had set his heart on the res­ toration of these provinces. In an address at the Uni- 22 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY versity of Paris, October, 1920, Poincare expressed his sentiments in these burning w ords: “ I have not been able to see any other reason for my generation living, except the hope of recovering our lost provinces.” It was this spirit which in 1892 enabled the Russian leaders, in pursuance of their own imperial policies, to make a treaty secretly with the President of France, by which it was agreed that Russia and France should attack Germany simultaneously, in the event of a certain contingency, which the Russian leaders knew they could create, to-w it: “ the mobilization” of Austria. They camouflaged this mobiliza­ tion of Austria under these terms: “ In case the forces of the Triple Alliance, or of one of the powers which are a party to it, should be mobilized (e.g. Austria), France and Russia, a t t h e f ir s t in d ic a t io n of the event, and w it h o u t a fire zn o u s a g r e e m e n t being necessary, s h a ll m o b ilis e a ll o f t h e ir f o r c e s im m e ­ d ia t e ly a n d s im u lt a n e o u s ly , and shall transport them as near to their frontiers as possible. * * * w it h th e g r e a t e s t d is p a t c h , T h e s e f o r c e s s h a ll b e g in c o m p le t e a c t io n so that G e r m a n y w i l l h a v e to f ig h t a t th e s a m e tim e in th e E a s t a n d in th e W e s t .” A fter this treaty was entered into by the French President with the Russian leaders, the Russian leaders subsequently borrowed seven billions of dollars from the French people, by selling Russian bonds to them, and using a portion of the proceeds of the bonds to subsidize the French Press, so that it would commend with enthusiasm the value of the invest­ ment in Russian securities, and favor a strong Franco-Russian policy in the Balkans. The French leaders required, PRE-WAR TENSION IN EUROPE 23 however, the money to be employed in building up a great Russian army, in the manufacture of light and heavy artillery, in building military strategic railroads, leading up to the Ger­ man border, etc., and in preparing for the war contemplated by this treaty. The French, during all these years, from 1870, had been developing great areas in Africa, where they governed be­ tween fifty and sixty million African people, recruiting A fr i­ can troops and training them in modern warfare. This pro­ vided a means of making available for war a French-con­ trolled population larger than the German population. The building up of the huge Russian army caused Ger­ many to strengthen its military equipment, and thereupon, when Poincare became President, the French extended the time of military service for the young men of France from two years to three years, thus increasing this force by 50 per cent. In the meantime, year after year, the French General Staff held military conventions with the Russian General Staff, planning the ways and means by which a war of offense could be made against Germany. France had an understanding with the Italian leaders by 1902 and both France and Russia began to compose all differences with Great Britain in 1904-1907. France, through its Ambassador at London, negotiated in 1912 a secret agreement with Edward Grey, which pur­ ported not to be an agreement, but merely an exchange of letters, in which it was recited that in the event an occasion 24 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY of war should arise in which the co-operation of the French and British Government might be deemed desirable, that the question of common action should be immediately discussed and if it “ involved action the plans of the general staffs would at once be taken into consideration and the governments would then decide what effect should be given to them.” This hypothetical alliance was gradually strengthened. Military and naval plans were worked out between the French and British officers. It was agreed that France could withdraw its entire fleet from the W est coast of France to the Mediterranean, that the British fleet would protect the French coast, and that Great Britain would put 160,000 men on the left wing of the French army, all of which was duly carried out when the war took place the first of August, 1914. When Raymond Poincare became President (with treaty­ making powers) he immediately and repeatedly assured the Russian statesmen that they could rely with confidence upon the diplomatic support of Russian policy in the Balkans, and upon the French support in case of a general war flowing therefrom. The week before Russian mobilization Poincare was in St. Petersburg strengthening the Russian will to war. (See Paleologue, Ewart, Barnes, Morhardt.) When the general war grew more intensely threatening he refused to try to exercise any moderating influence with Russia. alone could have prevented war. willed war. He He did not because he PRE-WAR TENSION IN EUROPE V. 25 G reat B r ita in The British interest was quite different. The tremendous strides made by the Germans in industrial production, ship­ building, and commerce, and finally the ambition of the Kaiser to build up a big navy disturbed many British leaders. They began to view Germany as a somewhat dan­ gerous rival and looked with increasing hostility upon the proposed German naval expansion. The intensive military training of the German youth, the Prussian military system, probably the most efficient in the world, and the Hohenzollern monarchy were regarded with aversion and increasing ap­ prehension. According to the controlling British view, if the Prussian military machine should conquer France, it would dominate Europe and this consideration, with the others mentioned, probably led Edward Grey to believe the agree­ ment with Cambon justified. When the Czar mobilized under Poincare’s encourage­ ment and war ensued involving Germany and France, the British statesmen were moved by what they believed to be best for the British Government. The invasion of Belgium was a pretext and not the cause for the declaration of war by Great Britain. The newly published English documents bear out the above conclusions. V I. G ermany In 1914 Germany had no reason for war, no terra irre­ denta, no revenge and knew that a general European war THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY 26 might easily destroy its merchant marine, its foreign com­ merce, both of which were rapidly expanding, and cause the loss of its colonies. Between 1870 and 1914, under the German Empire, the productive power of the German people had been tremen­ dously increased by systematic, technical education of the German youth in all the industries, arts and sciences. The German schools and universities had attained the distinction o f being the finest in the world. A t Dusseldorf, the German Government promoted the establishment of a manufacturing system where every kind of manufacturing enterprise in Germany was represented, and the custom was established to permit students of the higher grades from all parts of Ger­ many to visit Dusseldorf and examine these plants in action, so that they might select the life-work for which their tastes inclined them. Co-operative credit, co-operative buying and selling, muni­ cipal management of public utilities and other democratic processes were stimulated, but the central power was very firmly held under the Hohenzollern regime. The German people were happy and prosperous and intensely patriotic. Germany like other nations had its jingoes and super-pa­ triots who rejoiced in war talk, like von Bernhardi. William II posed as a W ar Lord at times and assiduously cultivated his army and navy in the hope of protecting Germany from attack by a show of power. The German Emperor, however, and his advisers during forty years made no war on others. William II claimed and PRE-WAR TENSION IN EUROPE 27 believed that he was a powerful force for the preservation of the peace of Europe. The people of Germany were great home-lovers, and had large families. They were social, fond of music, and developed music unsurpassed in the world. The capital of Germany, Berlin, in the uniform excellence of its architecture, of its streets, of its public conveniences and parks, and the economy of living was unsurpassed. The people were not only industrious, but they were thrifty, and Germany very rapidly grew in wealth, in commercial and financial power. The Germans desired security and peace, but believing that they were surrounded by dangerous ene­ mies, the spirit of nationalism, of patriotism and military training was stimulated to the highest degree, and they, like the other people of Europe, were ready to die for the defense of their country. It was entirely against the interests of Germany to engage in war. The Germany of Schiller and Goethe, of Wagner and Beethoven hated war. The German leaders were against war and feared it. Just as the enormous military preparations of Russia ex­ cited the fears of the German leaders, so the German prepa­ rations excited the fears and anger of the French leaders and strengthened those who were plotting for war. The Prussian military machine, with its general staff, was probably the most efficient war machine ever constructed. Its officers lived an intensive, military, self-sacrificing ex­ istence. They were given extraordinary honors by the civil­ ian population on all occasions. They were the men who THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY 28 had pledged their lives for the peace and security of the country. They held their profession in supreme honor. The German army was full of inherited tradition. man valor and efficiency were unsurpassed. Ger­ The Germans knew they were surrounded by enemies, much more numer­ ous than they, and of equal intelligence, and that they could only make up for their disadvantage by courage, speed and skill. They had annual maneuvers, the officers were con­ stantly at work studying the art of war, and the scientific men of Germany were co-operating in metals and in chemi­ cals to make improved engines of war. The reputation of the Prussian military machine went abroad, and neighboring nations regarded it with fear. Its great efficiency was conceded, so that when the time came for Russia to begin the attack on Germany, it was of great im­ portance, in the Russian view, that the Russian mobilization should have the advantage over the German mobilization of at least a week to ten days. The military conventions be­ tween the French and Russian Staffs assert that it probably would be the 15th day before Russian armies could get into full action, whereas either Germany or France could prob­ ably get into action within a week or ten days. For this rea­ son, it was absolutely essential, from a Russian military standpoint, that the Russians should on July 24, 1914, camou­ flage their military measures, and prevent the Germans from knowing their serious military plans. The Germans, from reliable reports, did know what it was; and the German military attache at St. Petersburg flatly rejected the repre- PRE-WAR TENSION IN EUROPE 29 sentations of the Russian chief of staff to his face when an attempt was made to make it appear that there had been no mobilization whatever. V II. B elg ium The lands of Belgium between the German and French territory are level, with no natural defenses. They com­ prise a densely settled rich section occupied by industrious, productive and highly cultivated people closely bound by many ties to France. The people generally speak French and use the franc for currency. Because of its geographical location, this region had been frequently a battleground in the past. Belgian leaders had made every effort to obtain a position of guaranteed neutral­ ity, and an agreement of other nations that this neutrality should be respected, but the military strategists of Europe recognizing that “ necessity knows no law” , universally re­ garded it as a certainty that in the event of war between Germany and France, Belgium would be employed as a necessary corridor for the entry into France of German troops, because the French border, otherwise protected by mountains and hills, had been so thoroughly fortified that a passway was impossible. The demonstration of this was shown at Verdun, where the Germans lost 500,000 men in an attempt to break through, and never were able to pass. The interest of the Belgian people required their government 30 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY to co-operate with France and Great Britain as against Ger­ many, and there was a gentleman’s agreement as to this co­ operation, although the Belgian authorities greatly desired to strictly preserve their legal, technical position of defend­ ing their neutrality against any invasion. The only invasion which they had occasion to anticipate and the only invasion against which they prepared was the invasion of German troops. The European strategists knew that in the event of a war involving France and Germany the German general staff would be compelled to attack France through Belgium. Belgium relied upon French and British support against Germany, and did not seek or rely upon Germany support against a French invasion. A s a matter of military strategy, the French did not need access to Germany through Belgium. A t the outbreak of the war Belgian authorities were notified not to regard French entry on Belgian territory as an offense. The Duchy of Luxemburg, like Belgium, was necessary also as a passway to or from France, but unlike Belgium, Luxemburg had no powers of defense, and could do nothing more than make a gesture against the passage of alien troops. Belgium had a strong army. The forts next to the German border were well designed, for defense, and were able in August, 1914, for several weeks to stay the advance of the German troops. Belgium with magnificent bravery refused to allow Germany to violate its neutrality and suffered ter­ ribly in consequence. the Russian intrigue. It was a victim of fate as a result of PRE-WAR TENSION IN EUROPE 31 V III. S witzerland Switzerland, which is a republic consisting of German, French and Italian people, speaking all three languages, was and is a modern republic of highly cultivated, brave people. Their country was easily defensible because of the gigantic mountain ranges, thoroughly fortified, and with an efficient militia of 600,000 men. None of the belligerents could a f­ ford, as a matter of military strategy, to violate the neutral­ ity of Switzerland, and none of them attempted it. IX . T h e H ig h S eas The enormous war fleet of Great Britain, consisting of over 400 vessels, absolutely commanded the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the entrance to the Baltic. The entire German merchant marine was paralyzed by the war. The French fleet withdrawn from the Atlantic controlled the Mediterranean Sea against Germany. X . I m p e r ia lism All the nations of Europe had contributed to the building up of the spirit of militarism, in which they had engendered fear of each other and mutual animosities, because of threats, real or implied, in their imperialistic and acquisitive policies, and all of the great nations, as also the Balkans contributed THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY 32 in this sense to the spirit of war which made it possible by intrigue to bring about the catastrophe of 1914. None of the European belligerent governments can be entirely absolved from responsibility for creating conditions which made war possible. It was the common doctrine of Europe that the only way to prevent invasion and war on one’s country was to be thoroughly prepared “ for defense” . This was the doctrine of the civilians as well as the military caste, but the military caste went further and held that the best way in which to wage defensive war was by waging an offensive war. military plan was to strike first. The This doctrine is clearly set up in concrete terms in the minutes of the annual mili­ tary conferences between the Russian and the French Gen­ eral Staffs. A ll the great nations of Europe had cultivated the policy of colonial expansion, taking over territory throughout the world, occupied by weaker and defenseless people, and had excited rivalries between each other, which in A frica had brought about serious tension between France and its allies and Germany. All these conditions contributed to the success of the in­ trigues which led to the W orld War. In pursuance of these policies all the nations of Europe were well armed. There was a rivalry in armament and in preparations for war. The people were led to support these policies by propaganda in the public press advocating preparedness for defense. proved to be preparedness for offense. It PRE-WAR TENSION IN EUROPE 33 France, Germany, Austria, Russia and Serbia had their jingoes, who praised war and stirred up fear and hate, but the real power was in a few hands and it was the cold­ blooded will to war of Isvolski, Sazonoff, Grand Duke Nicholas, and others in Russia, and of Poincare, Delcasse, Viviani, Millerand, et al. in France that launched it. The German Kaiser was convinced that a war of the En­ tente allies against Germany meant the defeat of Germany and his own political destruction and on July 30, 1914, made a written record of this conviction. prevent it. He did his utmost to C H A P T E R III W AR PLAN S AND W AR BOOTY I. H ow the W orld W ar W as E ngineered By a V ery F ew M en The evidence of how the W orld W ar took place is now quite complete. It was engineered by the Russian officials in control of Russian foreign affairs, led by Isvolski, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Empire, and in the years preceding the war Russian Ambassador to Franee. A microscopic study has been made of Isvolski. His letters and dispatches have been analyzed and indexed and printed in great detail by Frederich Stieve, Rene Marchand and others. His personal relation to the plotting of the war appears in the book ^'Isvolski and the W orld \\\\ ar , by Stieve. In May, 1906, Isvolski was placed at the head of the Foreign Office of the Russian Empire. Shortly before this, in March, 1906, he went to Paris, where he met three other Russian diplomats— Count Benckendorff, Russian Ambassador to London; Nelidov, Russian Ambassador to Paris, and Muravieff, Russian Ambassador in Rome. There was an ex­ change of views between the four men, at which it was agreed to develop the Triple Entente between Russia, France and 34 WAR PLANS AND WAR BOOTY Great Britain. 35 The new Foreign Minister informed the Czar of the results when he took over the seals of office. Isvolski himself describes it as the program— “O f which the further development led to the system of the Triple Entente,” in which it was determined by the four Ambassadors to re­ inforce the alliance of France by agreements with Great Britain and Japan. Immediately after he took office, he began to work to­ wards a rapprochement with Great Britain and her ally Japan. On July 30, 1907, a convention was concluded be­ tween Russia and Japan, clearing up all existing differences. On August 31, 1907, a convention was concluded at St. Petersburg between Great Britain and Russia, covering all points at issue between the two powers in regard to Afghan­ istan, Tibet and Persia. Isvolski’s aims harmonized with the London policies of King Edward V II of encircling Germany. The Entente of Great Britain was cemented by the meeting of the British King and the Czar, at Reval in June, 1908. It was in pursuance of this policy of building up the Triple Entente against the so-called Triple Alliance that the treaty concluded in 1905 at Bjorkoe between the German Emperor and Czar Nicholas II, proposing friendly relations between Germany, Russia and France, was refused ratification. The adverse influence of the French leaders and of the Triple Entente prevented various other efforts made by the ^6 Germans THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY to establish a rapprochement severally Great Britain, with France and with Russia. with The sinister and dangerous objects which Isvolski and the Russian and French leaders had in view are completely disclosed by the dispatches published in “ Entente Diplomacy and the World W a r” , by de Siebert, in “ Un Livre Noir” , by Rene Marchand, and in the Isvolski Papers, by Frederick Stieve. The de Siebert publication gives 856 secret dispatches be­ tween the Russian Foreign Office and Benckendorff, the Russian Ambassador at London. Un Livre Aoir gnes about a like number of secret dispatches, passing between the Russian Foreign Office and the Russian Ambassador, Isvolski, in Paris. These dispatches day by day, of the most intimate secret character, demonstrate clearly and positively the Russian policy. That policy was that the Russians must have con­ trol of the Dardanelles, as a means of giving free access to the world markets for Russian products, and second, the extension of Russian influence in the Balkans and to the West against Germany and Austria, an object which could only be attained by a general European war in which Russia, France, Great Britain, with the Balkan allies, should over­ throw Germany. The Russian Imperialists had clearly in view the considerations which would be offered to various allies in order to induce their co-operation in a general war against Germany. First, was the ambition of the few French leaders who controlled the Foreign Policy of France. They wished to WAR PLANS AND WAR BOOTY 27 obtain the restoration of Alsace and Lorraine, the great iron mines of Lorraine, the coal properties of the Saar Valley, revenge on Germany for the indignity and humiliation in­ flicted by the Franco-Prussian W ar of 1871 and to break down the growing power of Germany. The French Govern­ ment got what it was after, but the expense was larger than had been anticipated by Poincare. The co-operation of Serbia was secured by promising and giving Serbia Russian support in the Pan-Slav movement for a “ Greater Serbia” , in which it was proposed that the PanSlav population of Austria and adjacent country and the territory occupied by them should be made a part of “ Greater Serbia” . The Serbian Government, as Jugo-Slavia, got what the leaders sought. Roumania was to be satisfied by obtaining Transylvania, which she got and now holds. Bulgaria was to be made a secret ally by supporting certain of her pretensions. Bul­ garia was also committed to Germany and thus got noth­ ing. Great Britain was to be moved to co-operate with France in the event of a war between France and Germany, on the ground that Germany had become a rival to be reck­ oned with commercially; that Germany was building up a navy that threatened British supremacy at sea; that German military autocracy, if it were allowed to conquer France, would control Western Europe, and would become a menace to British interests. This Russian intrigue was politically possible between Isvolski and his associates and the French leaders because, THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY under the Constitution of 1875* President of France had the right (and still has the right) to make a secret trea*.\\ on his sole authority, binding France without the advice or consent of the French Senate or the French Parliament. Joseph Barthelemy, French professor of political science, in “ Democracy and Foreign Policy,’ I9X makes the fol­ 7> lowing statement of the principles of the French constitution of 18 75 :1* 3 “ The constitution of 1875 was the result of a transaction brought about, among other things, by the force of co-operation between a m o n a r c h is t m a jo r it y unable to establish a monarchy and a republican minority. “First, in principle, the President of the Republic alone represents the nation in foreign affairs; it is to him are accredited the ambassa­ dors of foreign powers j it is in his name in which the ambassadors of France speak; he conducts the negotiations; it is by his signature that he binds the country in international treaties of which he is the juridical author.” “ The principle expressly set forth by Article 8 of the law of the 16th of July, 1875, is that the President of the Republic negotiates and ratifies treaties upon his sole authority. “Almost all of the great international acts which have marked the turning point of our foreign policies during the half-centurj, almost all those which have exercised a decisive influence on the destinies of France, are the work of the Government alone and have been ratified by the President of the Republic upon his sole authority. It is in effect that Article 8 of the law of the 16th of July 1875, does not submit to parliamentary approval the most important perhaps of all the treaties, the great political treaties and the treaties of alliance.” * 1 Op. cit. p. 102. 3 Op. cit. p. 105. 3Op. cit. p. 109. WAR PLANS AND WAR BOOTY 39 It was under this authority that the profoundly secret treaty between Russia and France of 1892 contemplating military operations against Germany was executed and with­ held from the knowledge of the French Parliament and from the French people. It was under this authority that the secret treaties of 1916-17 to divide German and Austrian territory between France and Russia were entered into. Great Britain’s foreign affairs are directed in like fashion by the British Foreign Office, No. 10 Downing Street, with­ out necessarily being directed by or even disclosed to the British Parliament. Sir Edward Grey, in his agreements with the Governments of France and Russia, contemplating military and naval co­ operation between Russia, France and Great Britain along the lines worked out by the military and naval staffs of the three countries, was able to do so in absolute secrecy. He did not submit these records to Parliament until after the war had been entered into by Great Britain. Six times the British Parliament was advised that there were no com­ mitments made.1 It is of supreme international importance that the world should understand the structure of these foreign offices and what they did in bringing about the World W ar.2 The imperial structure of the French and British govern­ ments still so exist. 1 “ How Diplomats Make W ar” , Neilson; “Entente Diplomacy and the World” ; “Un Livre Noir”, etc. 3 Congressional Record, 355-356. 40 TH E RUSSIAN IM PERIAL CONSPIRACY II.

The official record evidence of the plan to attack Germany is Russian and French evidence. These minutes further declare, Article 4: “ (3 ) T h e m in u t e s o f th e c o n f e r e n c e s w i l l b e s u b m it t e d to t h e a p ­ p r o v a l o f th e g o v e r n m e n t o f e a c h c o u n tr y , a n d a v i s e o f th e m in is t e r o f zvar a n d o f t h e p r im e m i n is t e r w i l l b e a t t a c h e d th e r e t o , s o th a t th e c h i e f s o f s t a f f s o f th e a llie d a r m ie s m a y r e f e r t o t h i s d o c u m e n t in th e r e a liz a t io n o f d e s ir a b le im p r o v e m e n t s .” So these warlike plans to attack Germany had the approval of the Prime Minister of France and of Russia.1 They agreed also not to make peace separately in Article 5, as follows: \" T h e c o n f e r r i n g p a r t ie s a r e a g r e e d th a t A r t i c l e 5 c o m p e ls t h e c o n ­ tr a c tin g p a r t ie s n o t o n ly n o t to m a k e p e a c e , b u t a ls o n o t to c e a s e o p e r a ­ tio n s in o r d e r t o c o n c lu d e a n a r m is t ic e , i n d iv id u a lly The military conferences of 1912 and 1913 confirm the previous understandings, and in the conference of August, 1913, appears the following language: \" G e n e r a l J o f f r e d e c la r e s th a t F r a n c e w i ll e n g a g e o n i t s n o r t h e a s t f r o n t i e r a lm o s t a l l o f h e r f o r c e s , t h e n u m b e r o f w h ic h w i l l e x c e e d th a t 1 Congressional Record, 359. 3 Congressional Record, 359.

Mobilization must have started eleven days before or July 24/* These military conferences provided for the double track­ ing of the roads leading to the German frontiers as a means of quickly mobilizing the Russian troops against Germany. It is clear that General Joffre pledged 1,500,000 men for quick action and that their mobilization began July 24, for they were ready August 4. A large number of these troops were from the African colonies of France— Moroccans, Arabs, negroes. Europeans were killing Europeans with trained Africans. A ll the records must be interpreted in the light of this profoundly secret treaty of the Russian and French leaders to make offensive war on the German people, who were kept in ignorance of the conspiracy. The very existence of this secret treaty was denied, and Article 7 of the agreement itself provided: \" A l l th e c la u s e s e n u m e r a te d a b o v e s h a ll b e k e p t a b s o lu t e ly s e c r e t .” These military conventions demonstrated certain truths 1 Congressional Record, 361. 4French Yellow Book, 158. Congressional Record, 373. 46 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY now of the first consequence. First, that the pretended un­ preparedness of Russia and of France in July, 1914, was a colossal willful falseful, intended to deceive the world, sup­ port the theory of the innocence of the guilty Russian and French leaders, and further the theory of the willful guilt of the German leaders. Russia, as these military conventions show, was to have the required light and heavy artillery ready for war by 1914. The public press of St. Petersburg announced that the avail­ able Russian forces were ready, and that they had over 2,000,000 men ready for quick action. The military conventions were not confined to the heads of the general staffs of Russia and France, but by their own terms were to be submitted “ to the approval of the gov­ ernment of each country and a vise o f the Minister of War and o f the Prime Minister will be attached thereto.” The conventions provided for the most complete inter­ communication by messengers, by cable, by radio. The un­ derstandings between the Russian and French leaders with regard to division of German and Austrian territory and property were not left in doubt, and these agreements will be found set forth on page 362 of the Congressional Record o f December 18, 1923. Above all as “ Mobilization” was declared to be W ar by the Russian and French leaders who made the secret treaty it follows as a logical necessity that the mobilization o f Russia with French approval July 30th, 1914, and the refusal to stop WAR PLANS AND WAR BOOTY 47 it was by the Russian and French understanding an act of war against Germany which began the World W ar. The Russians and French thus began the W orld W ar. Germany acknowledged its existence and declared it, 7:10 P.M ., August 1st, 1914, eight days after it began and two days after it was declared by the decree of Mobilization pub­ lished throughout Russia. IV . D iv id in g T he B ooty of W ar Sazonoff on the 24th of February, 1916, wired the Rus­ sian Ambassador at Paris, Isvolski, as follows: \" T h e p o lit ic a l a g r e e m e n ts c o n c lu d e d b e tw e e n t h e A l l i e s d u r in g th e w a r m u s t r e m a in in ta c t, a n d a r e n o t s u b j e c t to r e v is io n .

The London treaty with Italy referred to promised Italy various territories belonging to other governments, but which the Italian leaders coveted. This same telegram says: 48 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY “ R o u m a n ia has a lr e a d y been o ffe r e d a ll th e p o li t ic a l a d v a n ta g e s w h i c h c o u ld in d u c e h e r to ta k e u p a r m s , a)id t h e r e f o r e it w o u ld b e p e r f e c t l y f u t i l e to s e a r c h f o r n e w b a its in t h is r e s p e c t .” The term “ bait” is more expressive than polite. It is not the usual language of diplomacy, but served the purpose of conveying the idea of how Sazonoff regarded the great country of Transylvania as “ bait” which he had thrown to the Roumanian Government, as he might throw the haunch of a stag to a faithful retainer. It probably was useful in assuring the co-operation of some of the Roumanian leaders, although Roumania had powerful ties of blood with Russia and with Great Britain, through the able and beauti­ ful Queen of Roumania, daughter of the Duke of Edin­ burgh, who was an influence of great power in the de­ cisions of Roumania. On February 1, 1917, the Russian Foreign Minister ad­ dressed the following note to the French Ambassador at Petrograd: “ I n y o u r n o t e o f to d a y ’ s d a te y o u r E x c e l l e n c y u>as g o o d e n o u g h to in fo r m t h e I m p e r i a l G o v e r n m e n t t h a t th e G o v e r n m e n t o f th e R e p u b ­ li c w a s c o n t e m p la t in g t h e in c lu s io n in th e t e r m s o f p e a c e to be o f fe r e d to G erm any th e f o l l o w i n g d e m a n d s a n d g u a r a n t ie s o f a te r r it o r ia l n a tu r e : “ l .

On February 26, 1917, Isvolski, the Russian Ambassador, sent the following telegram to M. Pekrovsky: “ S e e m y r e p ly to te le g r a m N o . 16 7 , N o . 2.

The usual diplomatic term employed in the time of Frederick the Great was “ Corriger la figure” , meaning to “ correct the figure” , that is, make the lines look better on the map. On February 27, 1917, following the French pledge to recognize Russia’s complete liberty in establishing her western frontier at the expense of Germany and Austria, the Russian revolution took place, and three days later the Czar abdicated. As a consequence, the Imperial Govern­ ment of the Czar never had an opportunity to “ correct the figure” of Russia on the west, nor to exercise “complete liberty in establishing her western frontiers,” but, on the contrary, the people of Poland demanded the right of selfdetermination and an independent government. WAR PLANS AND WAR BOOTY 51 The Russian Soviet Government, being regarded as a menace to the governments of Western Europe, was given no recognition when the time came for establishing new frontiers, but a series of republics was established on what had previously been western Russia in Latvia, Esthonia, Lithuania, Poland; Northern Silesia was attached to Poland with Danzig and part of East Prussia; Czecho-Slovakia was set up, Transylvania was attached to Roumania, and Roumania was expanded on the east by allowing her to take over Bessarabia. Greater Serbia became Jugo-Slavia, at the ex­ pense of Austrian territory. Austria became a very small State. The Entente deprived the Germans of large portions of their Eastern territory as well as other sections on the West and South. Mr. Balfour on December 19, 1917, denied on behalf of Great Britain any knowledge of the Russian and French plan to cut off western Germany into a new State on the west bank of the Rhine, so it seems that the Russian and French conspirators did not disclose their plan for division of the loot to their most intimate allies. In 1905 William II aggressively made the Bjorkoe Treaty with the weak Nicholas, pledging German and Russian friend­ ship and inviting France to join. France refused and the treaty was cancelled through Russian and French influence. Nicholas II knew of the treaty with France of 1892 when he signed the Bjorkoe Treaty. 52 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY T h e T r iple E n t e n t e a n d Its W ar P l a n s It was in 1906 that the four Russian Ambassadors got together in Paris, determined on the plan of promoting the Triple Entente and that Russia promptly made a settlement of outstanding differences with Japan and Great Britain, and France had already composed its differences with the British Foreign Office. In 1906 Sir Edward Grey, on behalf of the British Government, entered into an agreement with France, which on November 22, 1912, be reduced to writing: (Letter of Sir Edward Grey to F r e n c h Ambassador Cambon, November 2 2 , 1 9 1 2 .) M y D ear A m b a ssa d o r : From time to time in recent years the French and British military and naval experts have consulted t o gether It has always been understood that such consultation does not restrict the freedom of either government to decide at any future time whether or not to assist the other by armed force. We have agreed that consultation between experts is not and ought not be regarded as an engagement that commits either government to action in a con­ tingency that has not yet arisen and may never arise. The disposition, for instance, of the French and British fleets, respectively, at the pres­ ent moment*is not based upon an engagement to co-operate in war. You have, however, pointed out that if either government have grave reason to expect an unprovoked attack by a third power, it might be­ come essential to know whether it could in that event depend upon the armed assistance of the other. I agree that if either government had grave reason to expect an unprovoked attack by a third power, or something that threatened the general peace, it should immediately discuss with the other whether both governments should act together to prevent aggression and to preserve peace and, if so, what measures they would be prepared to take in common. WAR PLANS AND WAR BOOTY 53 If these measures involved action, the plans of the general staffs would at once be taken into consideration, and the governments would then decide what effect should be given to them.1 The French Ambassador, Cambon, immediately replied in the following letter: F rench E m b a ssy , London, November 23, 1912. D ear S ir E dw ard : Y ou remind me in your letter of yesterday, November 22, that during the last few years the military and naval authorities of France and Great Britain had consulted with each other from time to time; that it had always been understood that these con­ sultations should not restrict the liberty of either government to decide in the future whether they should lend each other the support of their armed forces; that on either side these consultations between experts were not and should not be considered as engagements binding our governments to take action in certain eventualities; that, however, I had remarked to you that if one or other of the two governments had grave reasons to fear an unprovoked attack on the part of a third power it would become essential to know whether it could count on the armed support of the other. Your letter answers that point; and I am authorized to state that in the event of one of our two governments having grave reasons to fear either an attack from a third power or some event threatening the general peace, that government would immediately examine with the other the question whether both governments should act together in order to prevent aggression or preserve peace. If so, the two governments would deliberate as to the measures which they would be prepared to take in common. If those measures involved action, the two governments would take into immediate consideration the plans 1 T h e la s t v i t a l p a r a g r a p h w a s n o t r e a d to P a r lia m e n t b y G r e y , al­ though afterwards published in the White Book.

M il it a r y A rrangements and M o b iliza tio n In 1914 Sir Edward Grey delivered copies of these letters exchanged between him and the French Ambassador to the Russian Ambassador as a basis for an entente between Great Britain and Russia,1 under which a plan of naval co-opera­ tion between Great Britain, Russia and France was worked out. W hen the German rulers ordered a German mobilization, 5 P.M ., Saturday afternoon, August I, their action was followed the next morning, Sunday, August 2, 1914,2 by the marching of regiments through London equipped for war.

France declared war against Germany on August 3, 1914; 1 See ch. 12, Entente Diplomacy and the World, p. 709. “ How Diplomats Make W ar, Neilson, p. 295. a Reflections on the World War, p. 145. 4 Preparation and Conduct of the World W ar.

In the Russian Czar’s orders for mobilization, 30th of September, 1912, Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg quotes the following language: “It is the Emperor’s order that the notification of the mobilization should be equivalent to the notification of a state of war with Germany.” In other words, the Russian mobilization order was to be regarded as a secret declaration of war. The Russian troops invaded Germany before Russia de­ clared war. Hollweg further states that the Russian in­ struction for the troops on the German front was: “As soon as concentration is completed we shall proceed to advance against the armed forces of Germany with the object of carrying the war on to their own territory.” * This was strictly in line with the Franco-Russian Treaty of 1892 and the military conferences of I9I I > 1912 and I9 I3* It will be observed that under the Franco-Russian secret treaty of 1892, Section I, it was provided that in case of war Russia should employ all its available forces to fight Germany and that the military and naval staffs, in the mili­ tary conference above quoted, expressly contemplated that 1 Von Kuhl, pp. 70-80. * Reflections on the World War, p. 132. 56 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY the German Arm y would be obliged to attack France through Belgium, and stipulated: “ The French Army could concentrate as rapidly as the German Army, and that as from the twelfth day it is in a position to take the offensive against Germany with the help of the British Army on its left flank.” And thus clearly outlines the co-operation agreed upon between Russia, France and Great Britain: “It is essential that Germany shall be attacked at the same time on the east and on the west.” But the most important light is thrown upon the matter by the preamble in the minutes of the meetings of the French and Russian chiefs of staffs, which is here repeated: P ream ble The tzvo chiefs of staff declare, by common accord, that the words “ defensive war” must not be interpreted in the sense of a war which would be conducted defensively. They affirm, on the contrary, the absolute necessity for the Russian and French armies to adopt a vigorous offensive, and, as far as possible, a simultaneous one, in con­ formity with the text of Article 3 of the convention, whose terms pro­ vide that the forces of the two contracting powers shall come into full action with all speed. The Franco-Russian Treaty, of 1892, provided “ In case the forces of the Triple Alliance or of one of the powers which are a party to it” (for example, Austria) “ should be mobilized, France and Russia, at the first indication of the event and without a previous agreement being necessary shall mobilize all their forces immediately and simultaneously and WAR PLANS AND WAR BOOTY 57 shall transport them as near to their frontiers as possible.” * * * “ These forces shall begin complete action with the greatest dispatch, so that Germany will have to fight at the same time in the east and in the west.” Therefore, when Austria partially mobilized for a local war against Serbia in ignorance of the terms of this secret Franco-Russian Treaty of 1892, Russia and France were under a secret contract to mobilize immediately and attack Germany with all their forces. This zvas a secret declara­ tion of war on Germany as of the date of the Austrian mobilisation, July 28, 1914, under the secret contract between Russia and France of 1892 as modified finally by Poincare and Isvolski who had agreed 011 making the Austrian Serbian •war a basis for the general European war. The Russian and French mobilizations, which were begun under the treaty of 1892, must be interpreted in the light of that treaty and the annual military conferences from 1903 to 1913 of the general staffs of the Russian and French armies. The fact that Austria’s mobilization was local and partial and only against Serbia under terrible provocation made no difference to the Russian and French conspirators. The technical case of casus foederis had arisen and they instantly took advantage of it. The mobilization by Russia on July 30, 1914 under the Franco-Russian contract of 1892 required the immediate in­ vasion of Germany. The evidence is complete. 58 THE RUSSIAN IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY V II. A bsence of a W ar P rogram in G ermany The German leaders have been painted in America and throughout the world as having brought on the World W ar. It was said that they had been preparing for this war for forty years; that they had been drinking to the day when they would launch it. Their extraordinary intellectual at­ tainments were well known, their intelligence was conceded and it is impossible to believe that with no adequate object and with no treaties with other nations that were of any great value, they were proposing to fight the whole world. They were encircled on land and sea, and without raw ma­ terials, with foes outnumbering them overwhelmingly, and yet not only were they charged with planning the war with Russia, with France, with Belgium, with Great Britain, with Servia, Roumania, Japan, but with doing so knowing that they would not have the support even of Italy, and with A us­ tria, their only reliable ally, seething with the Pan Slav movement and threatened with internal dissolution. Ger­ many had everything to lose and nothing to gain, because it is inconceivable that the 300,000,000 people in Europe and the hundreds of millions outside of Europe, controlled by Great Britain, Russia, France and Japan would permit Ger­ many to dominate Europe or the world. The theory that the German leaders willed the war violates every element of reason and common sense, and would require proof of the highest character to demonstrate that their leadership was so foolish as to will this war. WAR PLANS AND WAR BOOTY 59 Sir Edward Goschen, British Ambassador to Berlin in 1914, wrote Nicolson on July 30, 1914, that he was firmly convinced that the German civil government and industrial and commercial leaders were strongly against war. Professor Gooch, a leading English historian, in his book “ Germany” says: “No evidence has appeared to indicate that the German Government or the German people had desired and plotted a world war.” Honorable John S.
