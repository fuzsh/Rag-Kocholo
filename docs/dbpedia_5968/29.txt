It is not my favorite Ryasanov's movie, but nevertheless I recommend it for everybody who like comedies about treasure hunting. The plot is quite usual. Somewhere in very poor Italian hospital dies old Russian lady, who appears to be one of noble Russian aristocrats. She left Russia after revolution 1917, but she was not able to take with her all her treasures. So in the hospital, before she dies, she reveals to everybody, who is near her (her granddaughter, gangster, doctor, paramedics, patients) her secret. And treasure hunt begins! The movie is quite funny, but not the best example of Russian comedies. The good news is that unlike many Russian comedies which are fun only for native speakers, this one can be comprehended by any audience.
