        "text": "There is a plot in BREWSTER McCLOUD, but it mainly showcases the surreal nature of Altman's cinema. It's a must see for lovers of weirdness, expression and redemptive grace.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Jun 4, 2020\n\nThe off-kilter humor on display during the first half is terrific, but the film can't maintain its momentum and meanders during the second hour.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Dec 22, 2018\n\nI can't say that I regret watching Brewster McCloud, but I also can't say that I'd sit through it again.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/5 | Jul 30, 2012\n\nThere is something delightful in the absurdity and chaos of the movie that kept my interest even as I struggled to pinpoint exactly what it was that I was watching.\n\nFull Review | Aug 24, 2010\n\nThe film is so odd and freewheeling that it probably should have become a cult classic, if not for the fact that it has been so hard to find on video.\n\nFull Review | Jul 23, 2010\n\nAnyone who cherishes Robert Altman's work definitely needs to see this defiantly kooky comedy.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jul 14, 2010\n\nWe get the sense of a live intelligence, rushing things ahead on the screen, not worrying whether we'll understand.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Oct 23, 2004"
