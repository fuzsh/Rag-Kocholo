        "text": "Sally Kellerman’s…do whut??\n\nYou can call it “the Sally Ride” for short, if you wish. It will happen Saturday 1 June, the night before Sally Kellerman’s birthday.\n\nHere’s the setup: Sally Kellerman (1937-2022), fresh from her Oscar-nominated performance in M*A*S*H, teamed up with director Robert Altman for another film, Brewster McCloud. In this dark and profoundly weird 1971 cult comedy, Kellerman plays Louise, an enigmatic bird-woman who coaches young Brewster (Bud Cort) in his efforts at human-powered flight. Louise and her bird friends also have a knack for shoplifting and homicide.\n\nIt’s important to note here that Brewster lives in a squat apartment in the fallout shelter of the Astrodome. Brewster McCloud is one of the first feature films to be shot primarily in Houston, Texas; it was also probably the most Houston of the dozens of movies shot or set in Space City. It covers a lot of local ground, with scenes in and around the Dome, Hermann Park, Sam Houston Park, Downtown, Westbury, the future Galleria area, and the railroad track that used to cross Brays Bayou near Ardmore Street. It also marks the cinematic debut of Waltrip High School alumna Shelley Duvall as an Astrodome tour guide Suzanne.\n\nM*A*S*H is famous for, among other things, the scene in which Hawkeye and Trapper John bring down the shower building while Major Margaret O’Houlihan (Kellerman) is mid-shower. Brewster McCloud is not quite as famous (it did not garner any major nominations), but its most iconic moment is Kellerman’s scene in which she bathes nude in Mecom Fountain, splashing around joyfully like one of her bird friends.\n\nTo commemorate the late Ms. Kellerman’s birthday, the plan for this ride is to start in Hermann Park, proceed to the Astrodome, and return for a dip in Mecom Fountain. Recommended dress is swimwear or something else you don’t mind getting wet. It may be a good idea to have a towel with you.\n\nMecom Fountain is located in a roundabout, and access to it is difficult (and somewhat dangerous) for pedestrians or cyclists. We will devise a way to make it safer and easier. Be advised that the floor of the fountain may be slippery, so exercise caution if you decide to take a birdbath.\n\nWe will also have a Plan B in case Mecom Fountain is turned off or empty."
