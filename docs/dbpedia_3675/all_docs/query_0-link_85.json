Ever since he started attracting notice in the late 1960s, up until his death in 2006 and beyond, some twenty books and hundreds of articles and reviews have been published on Altman and his uneven but magnificent body of work. What would justify another book on Altman? What can one say about this legendary American film director that has not already been said, and said well, by so many others? That question dogged me during the early, tentative stages of this project. Gradually, after a lot of thought and research and a number of false starts and conceptual dead-ends, a realisation began to take shape. It occurred to me that there has been altogether too much emphasis placed on the two most obvious aspects of Altman’s career: as an innovative cinematic artist and as Hollywood’s enfant terrible, an untamed and unrepentant rebel against film industry business practices and aesthetic conventions. Both these perspectives have great merit, of course, but it seems to me neither is sufficiently political in the deepest and most integrative sense of the term. Focusing on Altman’s artistic wizardry or his life-long battle against purely commercial filmmaking imperatives tends to obscure another and arguably more trenchant point of view, the one that considers Robert Altman as a social critic; or, to put it in more specific terms, a relentless debunker and demystifier of America’s dominant ideology, the winner-takes-all ideology of patriarchal capitalism. Though putatively meritocratic and fair-minded, our long-reigning American Dream ethos has always been something of a hypocritical farce. Beneath all the carefully contrived and cheerful advertising that bombards the citizenry every day, cynicism, ruthlessness and a hyper-individualistic code of Social Darwinism prevails, one that fetishises personal wealth, success and fame without too many qualms about their manner of attainment or any other considerations, e.g. community, democracy, compassionate other-directedness or the cultivation of a genuinely creative inner life that stands apart from the single-minded pursuit of money.

Of the many books written on Altman, four of them subject varying parts of his body of work to penetrating ideological critique: Helen Keyssar’s Robert Altman’s America (1991), Robert T. Self ’s Robert Altman’s Subliminal Reality (2002), Robert Kolker’s A Cinema of Loneliness (2011), and A Companion to Robert Altman (2015), edited by Adrian Danks.

A Companion to Robert Altman is a superb compilation of twenty-three critical essays by various film theorists and critics, largely from historicist and ideological perspectives, but it concentrates on about fifteen of the most celebrated Altman films (and other topic areas as well, e.g. his early television career and the critical reception to his work). All of these works are of estimable value but there is, I think, still room for the book before you: a fairly comprehensive ideological survey of Altman’s work, rendered more or less chronologically, academically rigorous but also aimed toward a more general BVEJFODF BOEPOFUIBUEFMWFTJOUP\"MUNBOTXPSL OPUNFSFMZBTBTFSJFTPGëMNJDAUFYUT UPCFEJTTFDUFEJOUIFBCTUSBDUCVUBTFYQFSJNFOUTJOëMNNBLJOHDPOEVDUFEJOUIFSFBM XPSME BHBJOTUHFOFSBMMZIPTUJMFNBSLFUGPSDFT\"DDPSEJOHMZ UIJTCPPLFYBNJOFTIPX Altman chose projects; how he adapted them from source material; how, when and where he developed, financed and shot them; how they were received and to what FêFDU HJWFOUIFQPMJUJDPDVMUVSBMDPOUFYUUIBUQSFWBJMFEBUUIFUJNF3PCFSU\"MUNBO was a naturalistic filmmaker avid to get his art as close to life as possible.

I consider myself an artist, and I don’t have anything to say. I just show what I see. This is the way it looks to me. – Robert Altman Andrew Sarris, the leading proponent of auteur theory, famously averred that ‘the strong director imposes his own personality on a film; the weak director allows the personalities of others to run rampant’ (1996: 31). Sarris, writing just before Robert Altman emerged on the scene, did not foresee a third, counterintuitive possibility: that the strong director might allow the personalities of others healthy amounts of creative freedom and still be a ‘strong’ director, perhaps all the stronger for it. Over the course of a career that spanned nearly four decades, Robert Altman departed from Hollywood’s quasi-autocratic directorial tradition by regularly inviting talented actors and crafts-people to make meaningful, even crucial, contributions to his films. He also deconstructed or satirised Hollywood genre conventions and cookie-cutter narrative formulae in favour of heterogeneous structures, codes and languages: a style of filmmaking that, in the words of Robert T. Self, tended to ‘threaten, delimit, and define the BQQBSFOUVOJUZTPVHIUCZEPNJOBOUTUSBJOTPGBVUFVSDSJUJDJTN YJJJ \"DDPSEingly, in his book, Robert Altman’s Subliminal Reality, Self eschewed an auteur-centred BQQSPBDIUP\"MUNBOJOGBWPVSPGBTUSVDUVSBMJTUFYBNJOBUJPOPG\"MUNBOTNBKPSëMNT in order to show how they ‘both adhere to and embody characteristics of art-cinema narration’ (ibid.). While acknowledging that Self ’s approach to Altman and his films makes good sense – and that the auteur concept is problematic because filmmaking is a highly collaborative enterprise – I would argue that Altman’s rejection of Hollywood’s cherished narrative classicism in favour of a destabilising multifariousness of form and content still constitutes a distinctive directorial style, albeit a style that suggests the need for a subversive revision of auteur theory, at least in Altman’s case.1 What follows, h ol ly wood m ave r i c k\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 1\n\n1\n\n13/10/15 12:48:53\n\nthen, is an auteur-centred, historicist approach to Altman that draws on psychoanaMZUJD .BSYJTU GFNJOJTU BOE TUSVDUVSBMJTU UIFPSZ BOE BDLOPXMFEHFT UIF TQFDJBM DIBMlenges Altman’s case poses to the director-as-author paradigm. Altman’s Background Robert Altman was born on 20 February 1925 in Kansas City, Missouri, which he later described as ‘a rather uneventful, American middle-class community’ (in Zuckoff 2009: 11). Altman had, by his own account, an ‘ordinary, untraumatic’ childhood.2 His father, Bernard Clement (‘B.C.’) Altman (1901–1978), was a highly successful insurance salesman but also a womaniser, a compulsive gambler and something of a con man (see Zuckoff 2009: 19). According to his third wife, Kathryn, Altman was ‘influenced a lot by his dad and his dad’s behavior’ (in Zuckoff 2009: 24). As Altman told interviewer Aljean Harmetz, ‘I learned a lot about losing from him: that losing is an identity; that you can be a good loser and a bad winner; that none of it – gambling, money, winning or losing – has any real value; that the value you thought came with winning $10,000 simply isn’t there; that it’s simply a way of killing time, like crossword puzzles’ (in Sterritt 2000: 15). Patrick McGilligan asserts that Altman ‘came to emulate his father. Like B.C., he became the outgoing con salesman and the mischievous charmer, the incessant gambler, and the scandalous womaniser. But at the same time – unhappily – Altman grew remote from his father’ (1989: 32). Robert T. Self and Terry F. Robinson argue that the ‘biography of Altman’s professional career indicates that Altman’s antipathy to producers, writers, and stars derives from his never-resolved feelings of inferiority and insecurity around the imposing and threatening figure of his father, “B.C.”’ (2000: 54). Self and Robinson go on to observe that Altman’s films are rife with images of dominating or absent fathers. On the other hand, his mother, Helen (née Matthews) Altman, a Mayflower descendant from Nebraska was, according to Altman’s high school girlfriend, Jerre Steenhof, ‘the sweetest, most considerate, charming lady’ (in Zuckoff 2009: 19). She and Altman’s two younger sisters, Joan and Barbara, evidently provided feminine nurturance and gentility to counter B.C.’s brash, self-centred ways. Another major influence was Glendora (‘Glen’) Majors, a wise, tough-minded but kind African-American maid who served as confidante and intermediary between young Bobby and his parents. According to Altman’s friend, Harry Belafonte, Glen also ‘opened him up on race. He’d see through her eyes. She played an important part in his growing up, maturing, and in that maturity, found his centre’ (in Zuckoff 2009: 28). Majors also introduced Altman to jazz music (a legacy he would showcase in Kansas City (1996)). In sum, unusually comfortable circumstances and female love and stability leavened male adventurousness to produce the more or less confident, assertive, risk-tolFSBOUFYUSPWFSUUIBUXBT3PCFSU\"MUNBO#VUUIFTFUXPJOHSBJOFEQPMBSJUJFToFNQBUIZ and other-directedness on the one hand, and an inveterate gambling instinct on the PUIFSoXFSFJOUFOVPVTCBMBODFBOENBEFGPSBDPNQMFY DPOìJDUFEQFSTPOBMJUZ BU once intensely amicable but also restless, proud, sensation-seeking and highly individualistic. As McGilligan notes, Altman’s self-image was ‘as a lone wolf and an outsider 2\n\nth e cinema o f ro bert alt man\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 2\n\n13/10/15 12:48:53\n\n… a maverick, a gadfly, a posturer above the fray’ (1989: 40).

Another key formative element in Altman’s upbringing was his Catholicism. His parents, both staunch Catholics, enrolled him at St. Peter’s School, a Catholic QBSPDIJBMTDIPPMJO,BOTBT$JUZ XIJDIIFBUUFOEFEGSPNUP BHFTTJYUP thirteen). Altman also briefly attended Rockhurst High School (a Jesuit institution), before transferring to Southwest High School (a public school), and then attending 8FOUXPSUI.JMJUBSZ\"DBEFNZJO-FYJOHUPO .JTTPVSJ GSPNXIJDIIFHSBEVBUFEJO 1943. Though Altman often denied the Catholic influence, his years at St. Peter’s and Rockhurst were undoubtedly crucial to the formation of his personality. Catholic schools not only provided a solid educational foundation but also instilled in him selfdiscipline, a strong work ethic and an elevated moral awareness: attributes that would serve him well for the rest of his life. As he matured, Altman rejected the Church’s TPDJBMBOETFYVBMDPOTFSWBUJTNBOEXPVMEMBUFSSJEJDVMFSFMJHJPOJOTPNFPGIJTëMNT (e.g., M*A*S*H (1970), McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), A Wedding (1978)). Though he renounced Catholicism, Altman remained a nominal Catholic – he had his children baptised – and appears to have struggled all his life with the nagging, nebulous TFOTFPGHVJMUUIBUNPTU$BUIPMJDT MBQTFEPSOPU UFOEUPFYQFSJFODF)JTCJPHSBQIFS Patrick McGilligan, reports that Altman’s friend, John Stephens ‘believed Altman to be very conflicted about his Catholic upbringing, and guilty, still, for having torn himself away from it. “He was fighting against it… Anyone with a strong Catholic upbringing who breaks away from it will always have those guilt feelings as to whether PSOPUZPVSFSFBMMZEPJOHUIFSJHIUUIJOH0ODFZPVSFFYQPTFE PODFZPVSFUBVHIU you can say anything you want to say about what you don’t believe – but what is it you don’t believe?”’ (1989: 146). Paul Giles argues that a ‘residual element of cultural Catholicism is imbedded in the formalistic patterns of Altman’s movies’ (1991: 156), as evidenced by the preponderance of ritual moments in Altman’s films (e.g., weddings and funerals). Giles also notes that the Catholic imagination tends to be analogical, a mode of thinking that stresses ‘the interpenetration of unity and multiplicity, sameness BOEEJêFSFODF'PSFYBNQMF A Wedding, ‘formalistically and thematically emphasizes analogies and resemblances among heterogeneous groups of people’; furthermore ‘the central theme of Brewster McCloud (1970) is the communal nature of social life, the necessary sharing and indeed interchangeability of human characteristics’ (1991: 147). In sum, Giles sees Altman and America’s other great Catholic film director, John Ford, as rejecting ‘the dialectic of good and evil, opting instead for an all-embracing universalism. Their styles of filmmaking, with a heavy emphasis on ritual and a consequent tendency to disrupt and dislocate the solipsistic vision of any one individual character, h ol ly wood m ave r i c k\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 3\n\n3\n\n13/10/15 12:48:53\n\nfunction as a corollary to this thematic impulse’ (1991: 163). Indeed, it takes no great leap of imagination to see that Altman’s fondness for ensemble work and his affinity for de-centred, multi-protagonist films that downplay the role of the individual hero derive from the communitarian ethos that Catholicism imbued within him. Still more critical than his parents’ influence and Catholic upbringing to Altman’s mature sense of self was his service in World War II. After graduating from Wentworth Academy, Altman joined the United States Army Air Forces at the age of nineteen. During the war, Altman flew an astonishing forty-five bombing missions as the co-pilot of a B-24 Liberator with the 307th Bomb Group, 13th Air Force, in Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. His friend, Frank W. Barhydt later observed, ‘all that he saw and BMMUIBUIFFYQFSJFODFE BOEIPXMPOHQBTUUIFMPOHFWJUZPGBOBWFSBHFQJMPUIFMJWFE all that had an effect on him. It had a lot to do with how he lived his life’ (in Zuckoff 2009: 53). Altman’s friend, Garrison Keillor, put it more forcefully: ‘When you have done that at the age of nineteen or twenty you really have crossed a bridge … left your youth in Kansas City behind you. And that’s how you get the chance to die old and CFMPWFEBOEEJTUJOHVJTIFEJO$BMJGPSOJB CZCFJOHFYUSFNFMZMVDLZXIFOZPVBSFOJOFteen or twenty. He really was a man who believed in his luck. When you’ve flown fifty missions in a B-24 Liberator bomber over the Pacific, what’s the worst they can do to you in the movie business? Nothing. Nothing whatsoever’ (in Zuckoff 2009: 52). Also crucial to Altman’s formation as a filmmaker and unique to him among his peers was his long and deep apprenticeship in industrial filmmaking and television work in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of Altman’s younger contemporaries in New American Cinema (Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Paul Schrader and Terrence Malick) were the products of graduate film programmes. Altman’s training was strictly on-the-job. Following unsuccessful post-war stints in Hollywood and New York City, Altman moved back to Kansas City in 1949 and worked as a writer-director for the Calvin Company, an educational and industrial film production outfit that was the largest and most successful film producer of its UZQFJOUIF6OJUFE4UBUFT0WFSUIFOFYUFJHIUZFBST\"MUNBOXSPUFBOEEJSFDUFETPNF TJYUZëWFNNJOEVTUSJBMUSBJOJOHëMNTBOEEPDVNFOUBSJFTGPSUIF$BMWJO$PNQBOZ and learned every imaginable aspect of the filmmaking process from the ground up.

After what could be termed a twenty-year ‘apprenticeship’, Altman’s career as a Hollywood film director began in 1967, when Warner Bros./Seven Arts hired him to direct Countdown (1968), a low-budget space-flight drama starring James Caan and Robert Duvall – a project from which he was ultimately fired by Jack Warner for allowing overlapping dialogue. 4\n\nth e cinema o f ro bert alt man\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 4\n\n13/10/15 12:48:53\n\nLarger cultural changes he lived through also shaped Altman in profound ways.

Though orderly and driven in his work habits, Altman was a hedonist by disposition. He lived large, worked compulsively and played hard. He was a heavy drinker and a marijuana enthusiast throughout his adult life: manifestations, perhaps, of a naturally ebullient personality but perhaps more likely indicative of a man struggling to escape or insulate himself from insoluble inner contradictions. All of the factors just alluded to – Altman’s innate temperament, his family background, his Catholic schooling, his war service, his protracted apprenticeship – made him a disciplined, resourceful and technically proficient filmmaker. The banality of so many of the film projects that were thrust his way in the early years also made him a restless innovator.

As he told an interviewer, When I cast a film, most of my creative work is done. I have to be there to turn the switch on and give [the actors] encouragement as a father figure, but they do all the work… All I’m trying to do is make it easy on the actor, because once you start to shoot, the actor is the artist… I have to give them confidence and see that they have a certain amount of protection so they can be creative… I let them do what they became actors for in the first place: to create. (Stevens Jr. 2012: 7–8) Regarding the Altmanesque What is stylistically characteristic about Robert Altman’s films? By and large, Altman was what might be termed a naturalistic filmmaker. Mostly character-driven and openended, Altman’s films aspire to be plausible renditions of life’s unfolding chaos while undermining film genre clichés. Hence, storytelling is de-emphasised. The use of multiple plots, loose plots or virtually no plots at all, subverts conventional Hollywood narrative mechanics in favour of a focus on evolving human behaviour and relationships that elude definitive closure. Accordingly, Altman films typically feature ‘natural’ JFEFTVMUPSZ TPNFUJNFTBDUPSJNQSPWJTFE EJBMPHVFBOESJDIMZUFYUVSFEWJTVBMDPOUFOU (i.e. wide-screen compositions and mobile, fluid camera work; e.g. a profusion of long shots, telephoto shots, arcing crane shots, slow tracking shots, zooms, etc. in lieu of more stable/stabilising deep focus shots, close-ups and shot/reverse-shot sequences). Altman films are also famous for being aurally dense and realistic (i.e. lots of overlapping, even simultaneous, dialogue and ambient sound). Taken together, these formal h ol ly wood m ave r i c k\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 5\n\n5\n\n13/10/15 12:48:53\n\npractices make for a busy, diffuse mise-en-scène that problematises point of view or disperses it to the periphery, necessitating heightened attention and greater viewer involvement. In terms of character depiction, Altman’s films are consistently anti-heroic; they tend to feature deluded, passive, manipulative or marginalised protagonists. For FYBNQMF JO\"MUNBOTXPNFODFOUSFEëMNToThat Cold Day in the Park (1969), Images (1972), 3 Women (1977) and Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982) – his oppressed and neurotic female protagonists undergo catastrophic personality implosions. In more ironic and less emphatic ways, most Altman films echo some of the salient features of a different genre: American literary Naturalism, a deterministic subset of the Realism tradition, insofar as he depicts the typical American JOEJWJEVBMBTPSUIPEPYBOEMBDLJOHJOTFMGBXBSFOFTT JFBMXBZTBMSFBEZJOUFSQFMMBUFE by, and therefore at the ultimate mercy of, a venal and cynically manipulative social order.3 Altman also subverts the bourgeois subject structurally, by deemphasising its centrality to the cinematic narrative. Quite a number of Altman’s films – Nashville (1975), A Wedding, HealtH (1980), Short Cuts (1993), Prêt-à-Porter (1994), Gosford Park (2001), A Prairie Home Companion (2006) – employ large ensemble casts in multi-plotted carnivalesque fashion, rather than the traditional hero-protagonist (or two), around which the standard Hollywood storyline revolves: a formal tendency that carries strong ideological implications. Altman further destabilises character representation through casting choices. His films usually feature celebrity actors but often in roles that use their established star personae in ironic or subversive ways. He also puts major stars in minor roles or has them play themselves in cameo, or turns musicians into actors (e.g. Lyle Lovett, Tom Waits, Huey Lewis), or actors into musicians (e.g. Nashville). Such Brechtian stratagems combine with the typically decentred and multivalent Altman mise-en-scène to undermine representations of the stable subject while also deflating the dominant American ideology of heroic hyper-individualism: characteristics that militate against easy viewer identification and are therefore guaranteed to baffle viewers accustomed to more familiar fare. As for Altman’s recurrent themes – isolation, loneliness, madness, betrayal, deception, theatricality, deal-making, social climbing, gambling, delusion, failure, death – these rather grim motifs add up to a vision of America as an atomised society of driven, often desperate hustlers, a vision that runs counter to the dominant ‘American Dream’ ideology that simplistically equates individualism with ‘freedom’ and autonomy.

For Altman, the filmmaking process was as important and gratifying as the finished film itself – perhaps even more so. In a 1977 interview, when publicist Jack Hirschberg asked what really drove him the most, Altman replied, ‘Well, I don’t know. I call it the sand castle syndrome. I like to play. And I know that the joy or fun of it is in the doing – not in the result. Once it’s finished it’s in the can in a closet somewhere. Or the ocean comes and takes it away.’5 While Altman satirised the American hustler mentality, he was himself a compulsive gambler and hustler, always working or scheming to finance new work. What separated him from the object of his derision was that his primary purpose was to make art, not money. Accordingly, Altman assumed the role of a Prospero-like paterfamilias on set, working with a changing but ‘dependable community of production people and players, a mini-studio in which the MPHJTUJDTBOEDPNQMFYJUJFTPGIJTëMNTXFSFXPSLFEPVUBNPOHJOEJWJEVBMTGBNJMJBSBOE comfortable with his methods and approach’ (Kolker 2011: 305). As McGilligan nicely put it, ‘It [was] as if his collaborators [were] a bridge to the self for Altman, as well as to the audience’ (1989: 329). In a way, Altman was a throwback to the pre-modern artist. Encouraging collaboration, improvisation and company solidarity – creative suggestions were welcome (though not always implemented), attendance at nightly rushes was strongly encouraged and socialising was routine – Altman created and orchestrated a series of small societies of creative fellowship, something like latter-day crafts guilds for each of his film projects. Consciously or not, Altman was trying to replicate what German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies idealised as ‘Gemeinschaft’ (Community): a cohesive congregation marked by informal, cooperative relations based on cultural homogeneity and imbued with a sense of loyalty and moral obligation to the group, i.e. the kinds of relationships found in hunter-gatherer, horticultural and other small-scale societies before the development of industrial capitalism. Not surprisingly, Altman’s films often satirise Gemeinschaft’s polar opposite, ‘Gesellschaft’ (Society), i.e. the sort of rationalized, impersonal, large-scale social order that is epitomised by the modern, technocratic-corporate state and characterised by centralized bureaucracy, wholesale corruption, class stratification, division of labour, political disenfranchisement, and the lonely and alienated pursuit of individual self-interest. It must be noted, though, that Tönnies’ categories – Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft – are ideals that have OFWFSFYJTUFEJOQVSFGPSN8IJMF\"MUNBOTPVHIUUPNBLFVODPOWFOUJPOBMNPWJFTJO unconventional ways, he was still beholden to the powers that be for financial backing. That he made as many films as he did for so little money while so many of them were unprofitable was a miracle of ingenuity on Altman’s part that will never be repeated. To sum up, stylistic and thematic features common to Altman’s films and filmmaking process suggest a homologous series of binary oppositions.

I would add others: plot and character, authority and subversion, stasis and fluidity, univocality and multifariousness, commercialism and aestheticism, Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft. All these related dichotomies, ultimately weighted toward the second term, point to an artist in search of authentic community but knowing full well that, in modern business civilisation, the search is likely to find its object only intermittently, if at all.

Altman admitted as much in his interview with Jack Hirschberg: I really try not to look upon myself because the minute I – I mean even this conversation I consider as dangerous. I mean I really think it’s dangerous. I really think that the minute I start to lose my naïveté – the minute I lose an honest enthusiasm – the minute I have to say ‘oh, I wonder what so and so is going to think about that when I say it’ – then I decide not to say it. There’s value gone. Then I’m only saying the safe things… And if you start thinking about yourself or how you look or about how you’re going to appear – and it’s impossible… You’re limiting you’re creativity, your ability to do what you want to do. That’s why I drink a lot. I like to get stoned or whatever. And just somehow keep my attention away from my own thoughts…6 Altman’s ostensible rationale for avoiding introspection as ‘dangerous’ because it stifles the spontaneous creative impulse is plausible enough on its own terms, and certainly BTUBQMFBYJPNPGSPNBOUJDBFTUIFUJDJTN JFUIFABOUJTFMGDPOTDJPVTOFTTUIFPSZUIBU dates back to Thomas Carlyle and the British Romantic poets).

For Altman, obsessively making films was his best means of constructing a heroic self-concept, keeping a step or two ahead of his demons, maintaining a sense of community, amusing himself and contributing something meaningful to the world. Many artists are similarly motivated; what makes Altman rather unique, especially in the world of cinema, is the relentless intensity he brought to his life’s mission. For him, filmmaking wasn’t just a profession; it was a deeply personal struggle against his own alienation, the alienation that pervades everyday life in the NPEFSOXPSME/PUUPTBZUIBU\"MUNBOXBTB.BSYJTUIFXBTBMJCFSBMEFNPDSBU/PS was he consciously pursuing a sophisticated ideological agenda – very few filmmakers do – but his films were political in the sense that all films are ineluctably ‘political’; that they cannot help but bear some definite relation to the dominant ideology, a relation that is conformist, ambiguous or oppositional. Altman’s films tend toward the latter two categories, hence their limited popular appeal but their enduring fascination for film scholars and critics. 8\n\nth e cinema o f ro bert alt man\n\nIn ‘Cinema/Ideology/Criticism’ (1969), a groundbreaking Cahiers du cinéma essay on the ideological analysis of movies, Jean-Luc Comolli and Paul Narboni assert that ‘film is ideology presenting itself to itself, talking to itself, learning about itself. Once we realize that it is the nature of the system to turn the cinema into an instrument of ideology, we can see that the filmmaker’s first task is to show up the cinema’s so-called “depiction of reality”. If he can do so, there is a chance that he will be able to disrupt or possibly even sever the connection between the cinema and its ideological function’ $PNPMMJBOE/BSCPOJHPPOUPEJWJEFBMMNPWJFTJOUPTJYHFOFSBMDBUFHPSJFT (‘a’ – ‘f ’) that cover, in descending order, the spectrum from strict conformity to strident opposition to the dominant, capitalist ideology. Of particular interest is category ‘e’ because it’s the one that best defines Altman’s work: Films which seem at first sight to belong firmly within the ideology and to be completely under its sway, but which turn out to be so only in an ambiguous manner. For though they start from a non-progressive standpoint, ranging from the frankly reactionary through the conciliatory to the mildly critical, they have been worked upon, and work, in such a real way that there is a noticeable gap, a dislocation, between the starting point and the finished product… The films we are talking about throw up obstacles in the way of the ideology, causing it to swerve off course. The cinematic framework lets us see it, but also shows it up and denounces it. Looking at the framework one can see two moments in it: one holding it back within certain limits, one transgressing them. An internal criticism is taking place that cracks the film apart at the seams. If one reads the film obliquely, looking for symptoms; if one looks beyond its apparent formal coherence, one can see that it is riddled with cracks; it is splitting under an internal tension which is simply not there in an ideologically innocuous film. (1976: 27) Though recognisably ‘Hollywood’, Altman’s films are filled with the ‘internal tension’ that Comolli and Narboni describe: self-deconstructive fissures that induce viewers to glimpse the artifice beneath the movies’ putative ‘depiction of reality’ and perhaps begin to recognise that artifice is ideology (and vice versa): a political construct, not ‘the way things are’ and, as such, worthy of interrogation and rethinking. *** As noted above, Robert Altman was, by and large, a satirist whose interrelated target areas were conventional ideologies of self, society and the filmmaking industry. His best films managed to attack all three areas with nearly equal efficacy. More often, though, Altman went through phases that concentrated on one of these areas or oscillated between them.

This does not make Altman a ‘feminist’ but it does manifest an easy confidence in his own masculinity and a commendable willingness to step outside the strict confines of the Hollywood code of phony machismo that is in keeping with his generally iconoclastic tendencies. Persona / Personae Certainly two but arguably three of Altman’s early films dealing with women – That Cold Day in the Park, Images and 3 Women – have their creative genesis and inspi12\n\nth e cinema o f ro bert alt man\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 12\n\n13/10/15 12:48:54\n\nration in Ingmar Bergman’s enigmatic masterpiece, Persona (1966; released in the US in 1967). In an interview with David Thompson, Altman admitted that Persona ‘impressed me a lot. I’m sure that film was largely responsible for Images and 3 Women. There was a power in Persona, and I think that came from the fact that one woman talked and the other didn’t, more than anything else.

Though largely unknown by American audiences outside of graduate film courses and art-house revivals, Bergman’s Persona remains a key film in European avant-garde cinema. Indeed, its powerful influence on Altman also makes it an important precursor of the New American Cinema as well. Bergman’s scenario is virtually without plot. Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann), a prominent Swedish actress, goes mute during a stage performance of Aeschylus’s Electra – presumably because she is depressed by the state of the world and has had her fill of empty roles, whether on stage, as a wife, a mother, or in any other capacity. Her doctor (Margarethe Krook) suggests a long convalescence at the doctor’s summer cottage on the tiny, remote island of Fårö, Northern Gotland. Looking after her is Sister Alma (Bibi Andersson), a naïve young nurse who carries on a nonstop monologue, partly to escape solipsism, partly to try and remedy her patient’s silence. Once Elisabeth seems to shows some signs of attentive engagement, Alma becomes infatuated with her patient and begins to pour her heart out, confessing infidelities, a secret abortion and an unwanted pregnancy. Particularly engrossing is \"MNBTWJWJEEFTDSJQUJPOPGBTFYVBMFODPVOUFSXJUIUXPUFFOBHFECPZTXIJMFTIFXBT sunbathing in the nude. The relationship is transformed, though, when Alma discovers an unsealed letter by Elisabeth, which reveals that she has been using Alma as a character ‘study’.

Or, to put it another way, are they the inner and outer aspects of the same person? Do they embody something like Ego and Superego? Likewise, the term ‘persona’ (Latin for ‘mask’) is pregnant with meaning. In theatrical terms it of course refers to the masks that actors wore in classical drama. In Jungian terms the persona ‘is a complicated system of relations between individual consciousness and society, fittingly enough a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others, and, on the other, to conceal the true nature of the individual’ (Jung 1953: 192). Clearly, as an actress, Elisabeth specialises in the conscious cultivation of personae but then, according to Jung, everyone is an actor presenting a plausible façade to the outer world. Perhaps Elisabeth has confused persona for self, hence the recourse to muteness – but then other permutations slide into view. Of the two women, which one functions as persona or outward mask of the other? Or do both simultaneously? Is the convergence and ultimate merger of the two identities a kind of salvation or a spiritual death?

All sorts of hermeneutic avenues remain open and interpretive possibilities multiply uncontrollably. For a daring, iconoclastic American director like Altman, long schooled in the mechanics of plot-driven cinematic narratives but hungry for new ideas and approaches, Bergman’s Persona hit like a bombshell. Here was film as postmodern dreamscape; one that vigorously refused closure or resolution or interpretative certainties of any kind – on the visual level, on the aural level, on the level of spoken (and written) discourse.

Many Altman scholars dutifully continue to discount the film as an early misstep. Altman himself felt differently. In a 1978 interview with Charles Michener he declared the film ‘one hell of a movie!’ (in Sterritt 2000: 94). Though not without its flaws the film is, indeed, much more accomplished and intriguing than the critical consensus would indicate, and is well worth careful consideration. In 1967 Altman purchased the rights to That Cold Day in the Park (Delacorte, 1965), a decidedly offbeat novel by child actor-turned-writer Richard (aka Peter) Miles (pseudonym of Gerald Perreau Saussine, 1930–1991). Miles’ novel deals with a wealthy 1BSJTJBOTQJOTUFSXIPIPMETBTFFNJOHMZNVUFIPNPTFYVBMZFBSPMETUSFFUXBJGDBQUJWF JOIFSBQBSUNFOUGPSDPNQBOJPOTIJQBOETFYVBMGBWPVST*OUSJHVFECZTUSJLJOHUIFNBUJD similarities to the Persona scenario – muteness and folie à deux – Altman managed to secure $500,000 in funding from his friend, the cosmetics heir, Donald Factor, and $700,000 from the Canadian production company, Commonwealth United. He then hired novelist-screenwriter Gillian Freeman (The Leather Boys) to adapt Miles’ novel to the screen. From the outset, Altman’s interest in That Cold Day in the Park revolved around the fraught and mysterious relationship between the woman and the boy. He JOTUSVDUFE'SFFNBOUPEFMFUFUIFCPPLTDPQJPVTIPNPTFYVBMDPOUFOU DVUBODJMMBSZDIBSacters and incidents, and just focus on the bare bones of the story (see McGilligan 1989: 281). Altman wanted to shoot the film in London, possibly with Elizabeth Taylor or Ingrid Bergman in the lead, but ultimately opted to shoot the film in Vancouver, British Columbia, with Academy Award-winner Sandy Dennis in the starring role.1 In Freeman’s adaptation, Miles’ Parisian old maid – a shadowy, underdeveloped character known only as ‘Madame’ – is fully fleshed out as Frances Austen (Dennis), a prim and proper single woman who, by coif, clothing and manner appears to be well ensconced in middle age (though Dennis was only thirty-one at the time). Evidently quiet affluent, Frances lives alone in a large, nicely appointed Vancouver apartment inherited from her deceased parents: an apartment beautifully rendered in shadowy 14\n\nth e cinema o f ro bert alt man\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 14\n\n13/10/15 12:48:54\n\nearth tones on a sound stage at Panorama Studios in West Vancouver by set designer Leon Ericksen. Also inherited from her parents are Frances’s housekeeper and ‘friends’: a deadly dull set of bourgeois fogies at least a generation older than she is. During a boring dinner party for these people, Frances observes outside her window a handsome, blonde young man (played by Michael Burns, twenty-one years old at the time) huddled on a bench in an adjacent public park. After her guests leave, Frances brings the young man back to her place, ostensibly to get him out of the cold and the rain, but it soon becomes evident that strong unconscious motivations are at work. Because he is too lightly attired for the weather and does not speak, Frances quite naturally assumes that he is nothing more or less than a post-adolescent mute street urchin, as does the viewing audience. The young man’s youth, good looks, stony silence and apparent vulnerability make him pitiable, safe and therefore desirable to the obviously lonely older woman. She invites him to bathe, dry his clothes, have dinner and even stay the night in his own bedroom, all the while chattering at him incessantly to fill the conversational vacuum created by his muteness. On a deeper level, the young man’s silence makes his personality opaque and cryptic: an empty vessel that Frances proceeds to fill with projected fantasies and desires.2 Frances buys her acquaintance new clothes, invites him to stay as long as he wants, and begins, rather ominously, to lock him in at night. Unfazed, the young man makes the first of many nocturnal flights via the bedroom window and fire escape and goes to visit his sister, Nina (Susanne Benton), and her American draft-dodger boyfriend, Nick (John Garfield Jr.). Though they are making love when the waif happens onto the scene, he happily observes until his sister warns him away (a later scene between brother and sister, in Frances’s bathroom, is plainly incestuous). Also revealed in this scene, some forty minutes into the film, is the fact that the supposedly dumb boy can speak. Nina tells Nick that her brother has occasionally feigned muteness, sometimes ‘for days’, since childhood. Somewhat surprisingly, the young man returns to Frances’s apartment and continues his mute charade, probably because he revels in the elaborate game, likes Frances in a way, enjoys the plush accommodations and perks – he proudly tells his sister, ‘I have my own room and my own bed’ – and is flattered by her attentions. Frances, in turn, becomes more obsessively infatuated. After rejecting the gauche advances of Dr. Stevenson (Edward Greenhalgh), a cloying, desiccated member of her mother’s social set, she visits a gynecologist’s office to be fitted for a diaphragm in eager anticipation of consummating her relationship with her protégé. During this four-and-a-halfminute sequence, Frances is often filmed in long shots and through glass partitions and windows, while most of the dialogue is supplied by three other young women in UIFXBJUJOHSPPNDIBUUJOHBCPVUTFYBOEDPOUSBDFQUJPOɨFOFUFêFDUJTUPBDDFOUVBUF Frances’s discomfort and isolation – and generate similar feelings for viewers.

Altman scholar Helene Keyssar takes a far more perceptive tack in arguing that the hippie youth played by Michael Burns is every bit as crazy as Frances Austen, perhaps more so (1991: 201–3). His passiveaggressive bid to control the relationship by feigning muteness is morally untenable and smacks of psychic regression. In a larger sense the young man’s instinctive recourse to manipulative farce bespeaks a dark strain in the 1960s youth counterculture: its knee-jerk contempt for ‘straight’ society, which it views as clinging to old-fashioned, SFQSFTTJWF TPDJBM QSPQSJFUJFT BOE DPOWFOUJPOT WFSTVT UIF FYJTUFOUJBM GSFFEPN TQPOUBOFJUZ TFYVBMMJDFOTFBOEQMBZGVMOFTTQSJ[FECZUIFZPVOHFSHFOFSBUJPO*OTVN That Cold Day in the Park is several things: a film about loneliness, a duel character study, a cultural allegory dramatising the endemic generational schism that erupted in the 1960s.

When these two stubbornly habituated worldviews collide, as they do in That Cold Day in the Park, calamity is the predictable result. That Altman was not to have good luck with his first film as auteur was augured by what happened at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival. Screened out of competition, That Cold Day in the Park was not seen in its entirety because the projector room caught fire (see Cagin and Dray 1994: 115). A short theatrical run generated anemic ticket sales and critical reviews were harsh – for what turned out to be a watered-down version of Altman’s original vision. As Justin Wyatt notes, ‘Against [Altman’s] will, the film was edited by producer Donald Factor to obtain an R, rather than an X, rating.

As Michael Turner notes, ‘Although set in 1968, Cold Day is really about the stodgy 1950s, as personified by the uptight spinster and the world that keeps her chained’ (2006: n.p.). Images (1972) While Images was Altman’s fourth film as auteur, conceptually it was his first. It supposedly had its genesis in London in 1967, when Altman had a dream about a woman whose perception of reality begins to warp and fragment as she succumbs to schizophrenia. Some months later, back in Santa Barbara, Altman took up the idea again and soon completed an eighty-page treatment that set the story on the coastline of either California or Maine. As Gerard Plecki points out, ‘most of the ideas and actions of Images’ are there ‘in their barest form’, albeit with different character names (1985: 52). Altman approached every major studio but no one in Hollywood was interested in producing a cryptic, downbeat psychological thriller so Altman had to shelve the project for four years, until the immense success of M*A*S*H suddenly made him a hot property. In the interim Altman rewrote Images at least eight times, making the script the most carefully wrought of his career. Originally Altman wanted to shoot Images in Vancouver with Sandy Dennis in the lead role but That Cold Day in the Park took its place. He later considered casting Julie Christie as Cathryn and, later still, pondered Sophia Loren in the lead role with the film set in Milan. When these options evaporated, he set out to scour Europe for a lead actress and a suitable location. The first problem was quickly solved when Altman happened to watch Susannah York portray the title role in Delbert Mann’s Jane Eyre (1970), an in-flight movie he watched on Aer Lingus (see McGilligan 1989: 351). The film was mediocre but something about York’s ethereal beauty convinced Altman that she was right for the part. He immediately sent the script to York on the Greek island of Corfu where she was vacationing with her husband, Michael Wells. Bewildered by what she read, York telephoned Altman to turn down the role.

With York signed up, Altman scouted a number of locations on the continent before settling on Ardmore Studios and environs in County Wicklow, Ireland, just south of Dublin. The rugged, beautifully desolate landscape of coastal Ireland proved a richly evocative setting for Cathryn’s psychological disintegration. As for the rest of the cast, Altman regular Rene Auberjonois plays Cathryn’s caring but somewhat petulant husband, Hugh. Marcel Bozzuffi – (in)famous as the villain in William Friedkin’s The French Connection (1971) – plays Cathryn’s spectral lover, Rene (dead three years). Hugh Millais – the grandson of Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais, who played hired assassin Dog Butler in Altman’s previous picture, McCabe & Mrs. Miller – plays Marcel, friend of Cathryn and Hugh, and Cathryn’s h ol ly wood m ave r i c k\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 17\n\n17\n\n13/10/15 12:48:54\n\nformer and would-be lover. Cathryn Harrison plays Marcel’s twelve-year-old daughter, Susannah. Having secured a topflight cast, Altman – though hamstrung by a modest production budget of $800,000 – was able to create astonishingly good production values. Superb art design by Leon Ericksen finds perfect complement in the sombre-toned cinematography of the great Vilmos Zsigmond and a moody, Academy Award-nominated score by John Williams, punctuated by Stomu Yamashta’s tinkling, crackling ‘sound sculptures’. The net impact of a weird script, offbeat musical score, autumnal country scenes and moody interiors shot in stark, naturalistic fashion, is to establish and sustain a lonely, brooding aura of mystery and melancholy that haunts the viewer like the vague emotional after-effects of a troubling dream. Clearly inspired by one aspect of Persona, i.e. Bergman’s deliberate refusal to distinguish between reality, dream and fantasy in the way he shoots certain scenes, \"MUNBOFYQMPSFTUIFJNQMPEJOHQTZDIFPGBIZQFSTFOTJUJWF PWFSJNBHJOBUJWFXPNBO whose inability to have a child leads to guilt-inducing affairs, which precipitate a mental breakdown.3 Cathryn begins to have hallucinations of lurid telephone calls, glimpses of herself from a distance and former lovers sometimes when she is alone, sometimes in the presence or in place of her husband, Hugh.

The nervewracking problem for Cathryn and the viewer – who is always and only privy to her highly solipsistic point of view – is that it is impossible to distinguish hallucination from reality; both are equally ‘real’ visually. In the film’s closing scene Cathryn disposes of what she thinks is another hallucination by running it off a steep cliff with her car. The final shot pans down the cliff, through a cascading waterfall, to reveal that the figure was not a figment of Cathryn’s imagination but was, in fact, her husband, Hugh. The final shot provides catharsis and resolution by distancing the viewer from Cathryn’s mad visions but cannot retroactively resolve the many oscillations between hallucination and reality that come before. And therein lays the rub. As Plecki points out, ‘the analysis of self-image and self-perception in Images … is quite confusing [because the] already-complicated personality of Cathryn is hidden with obscure visual riddles, enigmas, conflicts, and subplots. Cathryn remains virtually unknowable’ (1985: 49). Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the forces that precipitate Cathryn’s TDIJ[PQISFOJBBSFOFWFSBEFRVBUFMZFTUBCMJTIFEPSFYQMBJOFE4IFJTZPVOH JOUFMMJHFOU beautiful and affluent and no debilitating trauma seems to have befallen her. It would also be accurate to say that the film’s final settling on a realistic point of view does not adequately mitigate all the epistemological confusions that precede it. We awaken to reality but a reality that will never quite regain its former stability. 3 Women (1977) As had been the case with Images, 3 Women literally had its basis in a dream. In the latter months of 1976 things were going badly for Altman.

After the commercial failure of Buffalo Bill and the Indians, producer Dino de Laurentiis fired Altman as director of Ragtime and replaced him with Milos Forman.

Nor could he obtain the rights to Kurt Vonnegut’s novel from 1973, Breakfast of Champions,XIJDIIFXBTFYUSFNFMZ keen to film (see Kass 1978: 36). To make matters worse, Altman’s wife, Kathryn, suddenly took ill and had to be rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night.4 At his home in Malibu during his wife’s hospitalisation, Altman had a dream about making a movie in a desert setting entitled ‘3 Women’ that would star Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek as two of the three women. The plot was murky but centred on what Altman calls ‘personality theft’, a central theme of Bergman’s Persona: ‘Two ZPVOHHJSMTGSPN5FYBT ESFBNJOHPGUIFHPPEMJGF NFFUJOBEFTFSUDPNNVOJUZ DPNF to terms with the undercurrents in their lives and undergo a metamorphosis.’5 After scribbling down some notes, Altman developed a fifty-page treatment with a young writer named Patricia Resnick (a former American Film Institute intern who had worked as a PR assistant on Buffalo Bill and the Indians) and convinced 20th Century 'PYT \"MBO -BEE +S UP HSFFOMJHIU UIF QSPKFDU CVEHFUFE BU B NPEFTU NJMMJPO without a finished screenplay. Indeed, Altman decided, much to Resnick’s chagrin, that he did not want a finished screenplay. Instead he decided as he so often did, to embrace his instincts and mostly improvise the movie as he went along, with the actors (especially Shelley Duvall) contributing much of their own dialogue. In his director’s commentary to the 2004 Criterion DVD edition of 3 Women, Altman said ‘too much emphasis is placed on scripts’. He deliberately avoided careful scripting in order to make a ‘very organic’ and ‘impressionistic’ film about ‘the ambiguity of lost souls’. 8IBUVMUJNBUFMZFNFSHFEXBTBOFYUSBPSEJOBSZëMN XFJSEMZDSZQUJDBOEBNCJHVPVTCVUBMTPTUSBOHFMZGBTDJOBUJOH0êUIFCVTGSPN2VJUNBO 5FYBT BSFBMDJUZ FBTU of Dallas), a naïve young waif named Mildred ‘Pinky’ Rose (Spacek) obtains a job as an orderly at Desert Springs Rehabilitation and Geriatric Center, a facility in the desert a hundred miles or so east of Los Angeles, nicely described by Scott Von Doviak as ‘a ghastly mausoleum of decrepitude overseen by penny-pinching misanthropes’.6 .JMESFEA.JMMJF-BNNPSFBVY %VWBMM\n\nBMTPZPVOHCVUBWFUFSBOFNQMPZFF JTBTTJHOFE the task of showing Pinky the ropes.

Mildred undergoes psychic regression after she has a terrible nightmare (visualised in a dream sequence featuring Willie’s ominous murals). Demoralised and deeply shaken, Mildred reverts to ‘Pinky’ and climbs into bed with Millie for solace. At that moment a drunken Edgar lets himself into their apartment and announces that his wife, Willie is in labour. The two women rush to Willie’s aid at her house behind Dodge City. Millie takes over as midwife and orders Pinky to summon an ambulance but to no avail; emotionally paralysed, Pinky remains a helpless bystander while Willie gives birth to a stillborn baby. The closing scenes reveal that Edgar has succumbed to a gunshot wound but whether it was suicide, an accident or murder is left to conjecture. In the end, the three women are shown living together in Willie’s house behind Dodge City with Willie assuming a grandmother role, Millie – now dressed in Willie’s attire – the role of a carping mother and Pinky, the role of a young, submissive daughter. A final, lingering shot of a pile of discarded tires near the house seems to serve no other purpose than to suggest that Edgar’s corpse might lie beneath. In his Criterion commentary Altman said ‘that’s really what the film is about – what happens when the last male dies’. Robert T.

Film critic Stephen Farber sees the film’s ending not as too reductive but as too enigmatic: ‘The problem is that this ending is so opaque and impenetrable; that virtually any interpretation is possible. Altman closes us out of the puzzle’ (1977: 84). Whatever one makes of its ending, 3 Women clearly bifurcates into two almost unrelated films: a trenchant satire of American cultural vacuity that ultimately devolves into the cryptic and arguably meaningless Freudian tableau derived from Altman’s Persona-inspired dream. Too beholden to his original concept, Altman obviously felt he had to end up there. Had he allowed for an ending that organically developed from his satiric storyline, 3 Women might have been a masterpiece instead of the near miss that it ultimately is. h ol ly wood m ave r i c k\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 21\n\n21\n\n13/10/15 12:48:54\n\nNotes 1 2\n\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n22\n\nElizabeth Taylor was not considered ‘bankable’ and Ingrid Bergman found the script ‘disgusting’.

On a wider front, the Civil Rights struggle melded into an increasingly passionate anti-Vietnam War movement that polarised the country and politicised a large swathe of American youth: a rebellious counterculture demanding more iconoclastic fare that confronted and challenged the old, shopworn verities. The commercial success of youth-oriented films like Bonnie and Clyde (1967), The Graduate (1967), Easy Rider (1969) and Midnight Cowboy (1969) prompted the old studio moguls to reluctantly hand the reins over to a new generation of directors, ushering in a brief period of intense creative freedom that has since been dubbed the h ol ly wood m ave r i c k\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 23\n\n23\n\n13/10/15 12:48:54\n\n‘Hollywood Renaissance’ or ‘New American Cinema’. Though hardly a Young Turk, Altman was at the vanguard of this new movement and one of its chief practitioners, especially in regard to the making of films that revised, ironised or otherwise demolished Hollywood genre conventions. M*A*S*H (1970) Heister Richard ‘Dick’ Hornberger, M.D. (1924–1997), a thoracic surgeon who practiced medicine in Waterville, Maine unwittingly transformed Altman’s career as a filmmaker when, under the pseudonym Richard Hooker, he finally published MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors (Crown, 1968), after scores of publisher rejections. A former army surgeon with the 8055th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) who treated combat casualties during the Korean War, Hornberger (with the crucial assistBODFPGGSFFMBODFTQPSUTXSJUFS8$)FJO[ UVSOFEIJTXBSFYQFSJFODFTJOUPBDPNJD romp. Asked to write a promotional dust-jacket blurb, the once-blacklisted screenwriter Ring Lardner Jr. read the book in galley form and thought it would make a great movie.1 Producer Ingo Preminger (Otto’s brother) agreed, and hired Lardner to write a screen adaptation. Altman was only offered the job of directing the film after some TJYUFFOPUIFSEJSFDUPSToBNPOHUIFN(FPSHF3PZ)JMM 4UBOMFZ,VCSJDLBOE4JEOFZ Lumet – turned it down or were otherwise unavailable. Despite the fact that his stingy DPOUSBDUXJUIUI$FOUVSZ'PYDBMMFEGPSNPEFTUQBZ BOEOPQSPëUTIBSJOH ‘points’, M*A*S*H would prove to be Altman’s most commercially successful film and a tremendous boon to his career. Though reluctant at first to take on the project, Altman soon warmed to the material. Lardner’s adaptation of Hornberger’s novel was anti-authoritarian, called for a large ensemble cast and was highly episodic – really just a disjointed series of comic vignettes: a film project uniquely suited to Altman’s talents and predilections. He immediately put his stamp on the movie by casting mostly no-name actors so as to keep the scenario realistic and off-beat. After securing his three main co-stars – Donald Sutherland as Benjamin Franklin ‘Hawkeye’ Pierce, Elliott Gould as John Francis Xavier ‘Trapper John’ McIntyre and Tom Skerritt as Augustus Bedford ‘Duke’ 'PSSFTUo\"MUNBOSFDSVJUFENPTUPGIJTDBTUPGFYUSBTGSPNUIF\"NFSJDBO$POTFSWBUPSZ Theater in San Francisco with the help of theatre impresario Bill Bushnell.

Whether pro-war or anti-war, war movies tend to take their subject matter very seriously. There have been comedies in war settings (e.g., No Time for Sergeants (1958), Mr. Roberts (1955), Kelly’s Heroes (1970)) and Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove (1964) parodied the Cold War but, before M*A*S*H, war film spoofs were quite rare. However, the intense controversy and divisiveness aroused by the Vietnam War, which was at its height when M*A*S*H was being made, rendered the time auspicious for a movie that would bring some comic relief to an ongoing national nightmare, while spoofing the war film genre and the underlying ideology the genre affirms. Though it is set during the Korean War, everyone understood that the implicit subject of M*A*S*H was Vietnam. The conflation of past and present US military adventures in Asia might also seem to suggest that the object of the film’s satire was not any particular war but all war. Yet a careful analysis shows that M*A*S*H is only tangentially an anti-war film; the principal object of its satire is not war but the authoritarian mindset that supports the dominant order and makes wars possible. M*A*S*H’s anti-genre bent is immediately evident from its setting: an army field hospital near the front lines, where the torn and bloody casualties of war are treated. There are no stirring and heroic combat sequences. Only the grisly aftermath of the fighting is shown, as helicopters fly in the wounded during the opening credit sequence, to the tune of ‘Suicide is Painless’, a distinctly anti-genre theme song that is no paean UPQBUSJPUJDFYQMPJUTCVUBTUSBOHF JSPOJDBOUIFNUPUIFEFQSFEBUJPOTPGUJNF DIBODF and life’s futility (music by Johnny Mandel, lyrics by Altman’s then fourteen-year-old son, Michael).2 The film’s three protagonists – ’Hawkeye’ Pierce, ‘Trapper John’ McInUZSFBOEA%VLF'PSSFTUoMJLFXJTFDPOGPVOEHFOSFFYQFDUBUJPOT1IZTJDJBOTXIPBSF only nominal military officers, the trio are hearty drinkers, carousers and scoffers at all aspects of military discipline and bureaucracy that infringe upon their individual freedoms. But these three also happen to be highly skilled surgeons who routinely save lives, thus positing the notion that competence on the job is easily compatible with anarchic rebelliousness off duty (indeed, Hawkeye and Duke arrive at the 4077th in a stolen jeep). In marked contrast to our hip and genial anti-heroes are the film’s villains: Major Frank Burns and Major Margaret ‘Hot Lips’ Houlihan. Both characters, at least initially, are sanctimonious hypocrites who avidly support Christian piety, war and the NJMJUBSZFTUBCMJTINFOUoQFSGFDUFYFNQMBSTPGXIBUɨFPEPS8\"EPSOPet al defined as the ‘authoritarian personality’.3 Essentially fascist martinets, Burns and Houlihan are belligerent conformists who instinctively affirm Gesellschaft authority over individual autonomy. At base, this makes them proponents of the established military order that the war film genre usually idealises.4 While the genre generally supports the USBJUTUIFZFYIJCJUoEJTDJQMJOF QBUSJPUJTN QJFUZoJUJOTJTUTUIBUTVDIUSBJUTCFNBEF manifest in moderation, so as to conceal their authoritarian underpinnings. As reductio ad absurdum caricatures of ‘good soldiers’, Burns and Houlihan show that militarism ultimately amounts to Gesellschaft dehumanisation at its worst. h ol ly wood m ave r i c k\n\nDC_Robert_Altman_pages.indb 25\n\n25\n\n13/10/15 12:48:54\n\nAccordingly, M*A*S*H is structured to vilify and ridicule Burns and Houlihan or to more broadly satirise the authoritarian-corporatist values they and the war film genre embody – though it should be noted that the film ultimately recuperates Houlihan’s character (probably because she’s a beautiful woman: an identity that trumps her backward ideas and unctuous careerism).

Father Mulcahy, who is giving a dead soldier the last rites, is interrupted by Duke, who is operating on a live one and needs the chaplain to stanch the patient’s bleeding: ‘I’m sorry, Dago, but this man is still alive and that other man is dead and that’s a fact. Will you hold it with two fingers, please?’ In another early scene, while Hawkeye is seducing WAC lieutenant ‘Dish’ (Jo Ann Pflug), she guiltily informs him that she is married. He replies that he is too, that he loves his wife, and ‘if she was here I would be with her’. In yet another brief vignette, Burns falsely accuses Boone (Bud Cort), an orderly, of killing a patient: an act of emotional sadism that infuriates Trapper John, causing him to knock Burns to the floor with a fist to his face – but only after enquiring if he’s finished his shift in the operating room. John’s assault on Burns binds him to Hawkeye and Duke, who heartily approve. ɨFëMNTEFQMPZNFOUPGTFYBTBOBOUJHFOSFEFWJDFëOETJUTNPTUJOUFOTFFYQSFTsion in a key sequence that depicts the outwardly chaste Burns and Houlihan hypoDSJUJDBMMZ IBWJOH BO FYUSBNBSJUBM BêBJS XJUI FBDI PUIFS 8IFO DPNNBOEJOH PïDFS Henry Blake (Roger Bowen) is called away, the MASH camp devolves into bacchanalian decadence.

Curious as to whether Houlihan is a ‘true blonde’ or not, Hawkeye, Trapper John and Duke contrive to pull away the canvas tarp that encloses her shower stall while she’s taking a shower. Revealed naked to the entire camp, which has gathered to watch the prank (perverse theatre), Hot Lips is suitably startled and mortified – but does win the sympathy of her fellow nurses. To add insult to injury, when she goes to Col. Blake right after the incident and threatens to resign her commission if he doesn’t have the perpetrators arrested by MPs, he casually rebuffs her. If the shower scene and aftermath were supposed to reinforce the film’s construction of Major Houlihan as a moralistic crank, the sequence fails. The shower stunt is self-deconstructing insofar as it comes off as vicious fraternity hazing – not righteous or funny but mean-spirited and misogynistic.

The shower incident redeemed Hot Lips Houlihan through victimhood and put the movie’s protagonist trio (and all the men of the MASH unit) in a less than flattering light. The Tokyo sequence seems designed to morally recuperate Hawkeye and Trapper John by showcasing their humanitarian instincts while reinforcing their identities as talented surgeons and fun-loving, anarchic individualists. It also gently spoofs the class privilege that prompted their mission in the first place. Upon their return to the 4077th, Hawkeye and Trapper John enter the tent UIFZTIBSFXJUI%VLFKVTUBGUFS%VLFBOE)PU-JQTIBWFFWJEFOUMZDPODMVEFEBTFYVBM encounter – a scene that completes the trio’s moral rehabilitation by suggesting that Duke has made it up to Houlihan for everyone who conspired to humiliate her and that Hot Lips has forgiven her tormentors and is now fully integrated into the MASH community. The film’s final set piece revolves around an amateur football game arranged as a betting opportunity between Col. Blake and visiting General Hammond (G. Wood) (with lots of side bets by Hawkeye et al) that pits members of Blake’s unit against Hammond’s team. Though it starts out as an apparently fair contest, the game soon devolves into a chaotic farce, rife with blatant cheating (e.g. the clandestine use of pro players and an illegal play that ‘wins’ the game for the 4077th), bumptious cheerleading, bureaucratic rivalry and a raucous carnival atmosphere obviously meant to mock war as the most corrupt ‘game’ of all and lampoon the earnestness of the war film genre that almost always features unalloyed heroism, grit and a culminating victory. Satirised on the gridiron, martial glory is further blunted by an anti-climactic ending, with Duke and Hawkeye returning to surgery after the game, only to learn that their UPVS PG EVUZ IBT FYQJSFE BOE UIFZ DBO VODFSFNPOJPVTMZ HP IPNF \"MUNBO GVSUIFS EFìBUFTUIFDPOUSJWFEASFBMJTNPGUIFHFOSFCZTFMGSFìFYJWFMZVTJOH1\"BOOPVODFNFOUT as a means to introduce both cast members and the film itself as it closes.

His miserly contract denied Altman a big payday but M*A*S*H did propel him into the ranks of bankable directors, at least for a few years. Taking advantage of the film’s success, Altman formed Lion’s Gate Films, a mini-studio in Los Angeles (named after the suspension bridge that connects Vancouver to West Vancouver) that would be his business bulwark until he was forced to sell it in 1981. In the final analysis, though, M*A*S*H was very much a matter of timing and novelty.
