        "text": "By Gary Springer\n\nI loved Shelley Duvall. She very much changed my life and I am forever grateful. I was a young kid in NYC who luckily wound up in two movies – not that I wanted to be an actor – and decided I wanted to be a NY crew guy. Got cast in another film starring Shelley Duvall, Bud Cort, Dennis Christopher and Veronica Cartwright. Thought it was fun I still had the crew aspirations. Shelley became my instant best friend. She said ‘why don’t you come out to LA and stay with Patrick (Reynolds of tobacco fame) and me until you have to go back to school. I did. I spent 7 months living with Patrick and Shelley in a castle in the Hollywood Hills and then another 4 months rooming with Shelley until she called me one day from NY where she was filming “Annie Hall: and said, I think I’m going to sell the house and move in with Paul (Simon). I had to get my own place and spent the next nine years in LA as a working actor (including a television movie which also co-starred the editor of this publication). Shelley was my mentor, my love (platonically), my facilitator, my friend. I met so many people through her and experienced so much that I never would have. Her bringing me to LA for a couple of weeks changed my life completely. I quit acting and moved back to NY in 1982 to work with my dad, but Shelley and I stayed friends. She called me in 1984 and offered me a role in one of her Faerie Tale Theatre pieces (the last professional phone I had). We stayed friends. She moved to Texas and I visited. She had difficulties and I was her friend. I flew down to Texas bringing our friend Dennis Christopher last month to visit her and spoke to her twice last Sunday on her 75th birthday (one wonderful FaceTime). I loved Shelley Duvall and always will.\n\nShelley Alexis Duvall, inimitable actor, producer, and style icon, died in her sleep July 11, 2024 at her home in Blanco, Texas. She just turned 75 this past Sunday, July 7. Her longtime partner, Dan Gilroy was at her side. She is survived by Dan Gilroy and her three brothers her brothers Scott, Stewart and Shane.\n\n“My dear, sweet, wonderful life, partner, and friend left us last night. Too much suffering lately, now she’s free. Fly away beautiful Shelley,” said Gilroy\n\nShe was born in Fort Worth on July 7, 1949, grew up in Houston, and returned to her Texas roots after successful decades in the Hollywood entertainment industry, Shelley was a brilliant and unique film actor and a visionary television producer.\n\nShe was first discovered in 1970 when she hosted a party to try and sell some of her husband, Bernard Sampson’s, paintings. Little did she know that crew members from a movie shoot in town were present and were captivated by her. Under the pretense of selling paintings, they brought her to meet the director, Robert Altman, and producer Lou Adler, who were blown away by her wonderfully quirky distinctiveness and cast her in the movie they were filming, “Brewster McCloud” opposite Bud Cort. In Shelley’s words: “I said, ‘don’t you want to buy any paintings?’ And they said: “No, we want you!’”\n\nShe continued working with Bob Altman on six more films such as Thieves Like Us, Nashville, Popeye, and Three Women, for which she won the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. Seeing her in that film inspired Stanley Kubrick to cast her in his film The Shining where Shelley’s harrowing performance is indelibly etched in film lore. Shelley had a one-of-a-kind look and manner—wide-eyed, toothy, skinny and gawky, but with her own beauty and elegance—that endeared her to industry pros and audiences alike. Beyond her striking looks, she was also a serious, dedicated, and admired dramatic and comedic actor. Shelley appeared in many other film and television roles from the 1970s, 80s, and into the 90s.\n\nBehind the camera, Shelley also conceived and created groundbreaking TV fare through her Platypus Productions: she produced, hosted, and sometimes guest-starred in her Faerie Tale Theatre series, which also called upon the talents of her wide circle of notable actors, directors, and film veterans including Robin Williams, Eric Idle, Mick Jagger, Teri Garr, Jean Stapleton, Frank Zappa, Vincent Price, John Lithgow, Pam Dawber, James Earl Jones, Candy Clark, Francis Ford Coppola, Roger Vadim, Tim Burton and so many more who would not usually have worked on a nascent cable channel show.\n\nFaerie Tale Theatre’s one-hour adaptations of classic stories, followed up by her Tall Tales and Legends series, enchanted children and their elders through most of the 1980s (and live on to enchant in rerun heaven). She continued the streak with Nightmare Classics, Shelley Duvall’s Bedtime Stories, and Mrs. Piggle Wiggle, garnering two Emmy nominations for Producer over the years.\n\nShelley, who had been called ‘The Texas Twiggy’ and, from film critic Pauline Kael, “The Female Buster Keaton,” was a frequent host on Saturday Night Live and during those heady late 70s and 80s was also known for dating the likes of Paul Simon and Ringo Starr.\n\nIn the mid-90s, Shelley found herself retreating from Hollywood and retiring from active production; successful though she had been as a star actor and producer. Then, her three-acre home in Studio City, which hosted a menagerie of birds, dogs, and other pets, was heavily damaged in the Northridge earthquake of 1994. Shelley and her partner since 1989, actor and musician Dan Gilroy, moved back to Texas to the small town of Blanco, near Austin, where the couple became a beloved part of the protective community. In recent years, Shelley has reconnected with some old friends and admirers from her Hollywood days while living a peaceful and quiet life in the Texas Hill Country.\n\nDan Gilroy, her brothers Scott, Stewart and Shane, friends and colleagues, the town of Blanco, and legions of fans mourn the passing of Shelley Duvall.\n\nLASSO-ED AGAIN? — (via Deadline) Ted Lasso fans, this is not a drill. In a major step toward the long-awaited fourth season of Apple TV+’s hugely popular soccer comedy, the series’ studio Warner Bros. Television has picked up the options on the three original cast members who had been contracted under the aegis of the UK acting union Equity, sources tell Deadline. They are Hannah Waddingham, who plays AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Walton, Brett Goldstein, who plays hardman Roy Kent and Jeremy Swift, who plays Director of Football Operations Leslie Higgins.\n\nAfter securing the trio, the studio is expected to start reaching out to Ted Lasso cast members with SAG-AFTRA contracts whose options had expired, so they will need to make new deals, we hear. In addition to co-creators/executive producers Jason Sudeikis (Ted Lasso) and Brendan Hunt (Coach Beard), that is believed to include Juno Temple (Keeley Jones). We hear one of the Ted Lasso OGs, Phil Dunster (Jamie Tart), has not been picked up, presumably due to a conflict with another series; he is on both Prime Video’s The Devil’s Hour and Apple’s Surface.\n\nIt is unclear which other stars may be approached about Season 4; the cast have all said repeatedly that they would be happy to reprise their roles if an opportunity arises. Many would likely pop in for guest appearances.\n\nGetting the cast back paves the way toward a Season 4 green light, contingent on budget approval and scheduling as actors whose options have lapsed may have joined other series that have them in first position, sources said.\n\nWhile the outreach to the cast is underway, early preparations are also being made to open a writers room. If all elements come together, we hear production on a fourth season is eyeing an early 2025 start. Reps for WBTV and Apple TV+ declined comment.\n\nStarting the process for a Season 4 greenlight indicates that the main Ted Lasso driving force on and off-screen, Sudeikis, is on board for a new installment as the studio would not have proceeded without his consent.\n\nThe fate of Ted Lasso has always hinged on Sudeikis, who’d originated the character in NBC Sports videos. While being open that they would love to extend Ted Lasso, one of the biggest and most acclaimed comedies of the past decade, Apple and Warner Bros. executives have made it clear that it would be up to Sudeikis whether the show would continue.\n\nThe Saturday Night Live alum, who co-created Ted Lasso with Hunt, Joe Kelly and Bill Lawrence, had originally conceived the comedy as a three-season story arc and he stuck with the plan despite the series’ enormous success. But he had not shut the door to more Ted Lasso — which is why Season 3 was not labeled as final — contingent on finding the right idea. Much to Ted Lasso fans’ delight, more than a year after the Season 3 finale, it looks like that has happened.\n\nWith its uplifting tone and a good-natured, eternal optimist lead character, Ted Lasso was the perfect show to launch at the height of the pandemic in August 2020. The comedy became an instant global hit and Apple’s signature and most-watched ever original series.\n\nIn addition to its immense popularity that catapulted it into the pop culture zeitgeist, Ted Lasso earned 13 Emmy Awards during its original three-season run, including two back-to-back Outstanding Comedy Series trophies and acting wins for Sudeikis (2), Goldstein (2), who is also a writer-producer on the show, and Waddingham.\n\nThe May 2023 Season 3 finale saw Keeley and Rebecca potentially partnering for a new venture, AFC Richmond Women’s Team, with all the main characters main characters getting a happy ending, including Ted, last seen coaching his son on a soccer field in Kansas.\n\nInteresting to say the least. The question is and has always been, could they again capture what made the first-run of the show, so successful? I personally was happy with the resolution, although many were not. It’d be a major payday for everyone involved, so that’s a major consideration for everyone. Stay tuned.\n\nDREW’S BLUES — (Via Deadline) As she prepares to get back to her studio couch, Drew Barrymore plans to give her guests a little more space going forward.\n\nFollowing The Drew Barrymore Show’s renewal for seasons 6 and 7, the actress and talk show host explained why she tends to get literally up-close and personal with her subjects on the syndicated CBS morning show.\n\n“Well, I’ll try to practice physical distance, which is not my strong point,” Barrymore said on Entertainment Tonight. “Do you know how hard the pandemic was for me? I was alone in a studio by myself! I like to be around people!”\n\nShe acknowledged that her indifference toward personal space is “not everyone’s favorite but I’m sorry to those people!”\n\n“I think that, first of all, we’re always gonna be big on joy and laughter and feeling good, and that was something I always wanted to do,” explained Barrymore. “But I never thought we would launch in a pandemic, and trying to lean into the joy and the feel good and the comedy at that time was real weird and wacky.”\n\n“Drew is a one-of-a-kind talent who is an integral part of the CBS and Paramount family,” said Wendy McMahon, president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures. “This early renewal and upgrades are a testament to our commitment to The Drew Barrymore Show and its loyal audience, who tune in every day to see Drew’s warmth, inquisitiveness and spontaneity.”\n\nThis fall, The Drew Barrymore Show moves to upgraded time slots on CBS stations in six markets, including five of the top 10 markets. Meanwhile, the show is averaging 1.1 million viewers, with nearly 6 billion minutes watched this season, according to CBS.\n\nI’m a fan, but I don’t often watch her show. I watched it when I was sequestered at home, but found it somewhat off-putting. The current 9:30 AM ET slot was kind of awkward too. There was alto of talk about the show being canceled, so this is manna from heaven.\n\nSHORT TAKES — Our old Friend Marcus Linail (ML Presents) is currently featuring a Coldplay-tribute band. Why not? Marcus ran NYC’s The Canal Room and Shine – both much missed and has worked for years with the tribute band Jessie’s Girl – who are phenomenal. Check out his productions at https://www.mlpresents.com/ …\n\nKjersti Long’s about-to-be-staged play in London has undergone a name change, to Little Piece Of You. More to follow on this one, including who will be the star of the show, which will be a mind-blower. We heard it and could not believe it … Now here’s something I’d really love to read: You can read about Peter and all the Monkees, plus all your teen idols in my memoir: “Meow! My Groovy Life with Tiger Beat’s Teen Idols,” you can grab an e-book or paperback at Amazon.com or an autographed copy at my website:annmoses.com …\n\nHad occasion to listen to Robin Trower’s magnificent “Bridge Of Sighs” from 1974. My God, it sounded as good as ever. Jim Dewar’s vocals just mesmerize. The Bride Of Sighs is in Venice and was the last thing the convicts of the day saw before their death. What a song. Take a listen\n\nAre Oasis re-uniting after a 15-year split? “Wonderwall” remains a stone-cold classic. Check this piece out from Deadline: https://deadline.com/2024/08/liam-gallagher-appears-to-confirm-oasis-reunion-15-years-after-warring-brothers-split-1236049824/ … Micky Dolenz admitted on his weekend interview with Cousin Brucie on WABC, that being a DJ on CBS-FM back in 2005, was a difficult one in that getting up at 3:00 AM was often difficult as being on rock and roll time, he’d be going to sleep then. Great interview and don’t forget Dolenz will be at Flagsataff/Westbury Music Fair on December 14 … Jeff Lynne and his re-configured ELO opened their 31-date Over and Out Tour over the weekend in Palm Desert, CA. He’s one of my all-time faves but from the videos I saw, it looked a tad shaky. It’s essentially the same band he’s had in previous tours and while they’re good, they’re almost a little too slick. Hope to catch them at MSG next month …\n\nAnd, CBS News Radio -just shy of 60 years on air- officially signs off tonight. Sad for sure.\n\nNAMES IN THE NEWS — Vito Bruno; Toby Mamis; Chuck Pulin; Paul Undersinger; Mark Bego; Tom & Lisa Cuddy; Lillian Roxon; Jane Blunkell; Debbie Gibson; Heather Moore; Liz Skollar; Van Dean; Mark Berry; Lon Van Eaton; Steve Plotnicki; Manny Bella; Carol Ross; Tommy James; Dan Zelinski; Peter Shendell; Randy Alexander; Lee Jeske; Steve Walter; Barry Fisch; Eppy; Amanda Naylor; Zach Martin; Race Taylor; Joe Bonadonna; and BELLA!\n\nImages on this page have been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license.\n\nMEGALOPOLIS SCREW-UP — (from Variety) “Lionsgate is immediately recalling our trailer for ‘Megalopolis,’” a Lionsgate spokesperson said in a statement provided to Variety. “We offer our sincere apologies to the critics involved and to Francis Ford Coppola and American Zoetrope for this inexcusable error in our vettingprocess. We screwed up. We are sorry.”\n\nThe trailer, released on Wednesday morning, aimed to position Coppola’s latest film as a work of art that would withstand the test of time, much like his previous masterpieces “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now.”\n\nThe video included several quotes from critics panning Coppola’s previous work — but none of the phrases, attributed to the likes of Roger Ebert and Pauline Kael, could be found in any of their reviews.\n\nVariety‘s Owen Gleiberman was incorrectly cited as calling the 1992 film “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” “a beautiful mess” and highlighting its “absurdity” when he reviewed the film for Entertainment Weekly, where he worked at the time of its release.\n\n“Even if you’re one of those people who don’t like critics, we hardly deserve to have words put in our mouths. Then again, the trivial scandal of all this is that the whole ‘Megalopolis’ trailer is built on a false narrative,” Gleiberman said of the trailer’s falsified quotes. “Critics loved ‘The Godfather.’ And though ‘Apocalypse Now’ was divisive, it received a lot of crucial critical support. As far as me calling ‘Bram Stoker’s Dracula’ ‘a beautiful mess,’ I only wish I’d said that! Regarding that film, it now sounds kind.”\n\nIt’s not clear where most of the quotes featured in the trailer came from — with the exception of Roger Ebert’s comment, “a triumph of style over substance,” which was actually pulled from his 1989 review of “Batman,” and not about “Dracula,” as indicated in the trailer.\n\nThe trailer snafu is the latest in a string of scandals befalling the $120 million production, which Coppola financed entirely himself. Last month, Variety exclusively obtained video depicting Coppola trying to kiss young female extras on the set of the project, as additional crew members detailed his unprofessional behavior during production.”\n\nHere’s the trailer –\n\nSHORT TAKES — U2 are releasing a film of their Sphere residency. Was bound to happen. While it’ll be difficult to imagine the show in person on film; it’ll no doubt be great …\n\nJanet Jackson at 58, will be heading a Vegas residency in January? God bless her … NBC and The Today Show have been relentlessly promoting the forthcoming two-part Wicked movie (directed by Jon M. Chu); from their sister studio Universal. I hear the film is not very good, but has all this advance PR helped, or hurt. We’ll see …\n\nThe pristine name Warner Brothers is in real trouble; mostly caused by one David Zaslav aka Zaz The Butcher. The brand Warner Brothers is worth $9.1 billion less this year, than last. Check this missive out: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/party-loving-hollywood-mogul-making-131500886.html Personally when he threw the name HBO out and re-branded it was MAX, I knew he was in major trouble. Oh, he’s changing it back to HBO now. There you go …\n\nMicky Dolenz is interviewed on Bruce Morrow’s WABC show Saturday night … First Robert Downey Jr. has returns to the Marvel Universe, now has James Spader who will reprise hisUltron-voice for the new Vision series; tentatively called VisionQuest. Here’s Deadline’s take on it: https://deadline.com/2024/08/james-spader-ultron-marvel-vision-series-1236048975/ …Yes, the just-completed DNC show in Chicago ran very, very smoothly and a lot of that is due to producer Ricky Kirshner. Yes, Don’s son … As we go to press, the rumor of the day is Trump and Kennedy hooking up on the ticket? What a crazy, crazy roller-coaster ride this election has been. Stay tuned for sure as I just bet there’s eve more to come …\n\nAnd, clearly it’s a premiere puff-piece for Primary Wave’s goal to launch the house of James Brown as another Graceland, but from Billboard a crazy article for sure. Called the James Brown House on Beech Island, it’s quite an amazing read and yes, almost every member of the Primary Wavestaff gets a mention. A must read indeed: https://www.billboard.com/business/publishing/james-brown-estate-primary-wave-1235757863/#recipient_hashed=935fc793dece95682dfcc35475321e6768c49a84cbb830da9f8df0f8b6837d2a&recipient_salt=7221de42d457b3d6b5f3aa5ba131113f2bdf13c416519f9139035c49228a3a99&utm_medium=email&utm_source=exacttarget&utm_campaign=billboard_MustRead&utm_content=545828_08-22-2024&utm_term=171799\n\nNAMES IN THE NEWS — Al Roker; Savannah Guthrie; Jon Small; Jon Goldwater; Anthony Noto; Jerry Orbach; Tom & Lisa Cuddy; Scott Shannon; Tucci’s; Jon Landau; Dick Wingate; Janus Records; Al Stewart; Don Wardell; Walt McQuire; John Boulos; Deb Caponetta; Monica Lynch; Adrian Niles; Paul Undersinger; Jacqueline Boyd; Andrew Sandoval; Steve Leeds; Judd Bernard; Shep Pettibone; and CHIP!\n\nImages on this page have been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license.\n\nDONAHUE WAS KING — I was a fan from his first day in NYC. Who was this silver-haired devil bolting around his live audience? Whether it was John Wayne or Bill Clinton or Ringo Starr, he was a whirling dervish. Donahue always said that his audience were the real stars; they were the buyers who made shows like his possible … and he was right.\n\nBeginning to Dayton, Ohio, then Chicago, then New York, Phil Donahue had the real, first-ever talk show, where his audience would get involved. Oprah, who for my money stole his format, might have gotten more ink, but Donahue’s choice of topics was absolutely stunning and diverse.\n\nHis 44-union with Marlo Thomas was pretty amazing too. She sort of dropped off the radar after her series That Girl; although we would see her in relentless commercials for St. Jude, which her father Danny founded.\n\nThink about everyone who followed in Phil’s footsteps; Geraldo; Sally Jesse Raphael; Montel Williams; Joan Rivers; Jenny Jones; Maury Povich; Gordon Elliot; Tyra Banks; Jerry Springer; Bill Boggs;Lee Leonard; Richard Bey; Stanley Siegal; Morton Downey Jr. … just an endless stream of competition, but Phil was the best.\n\nTo tell the truth, after Phil I became an avid Larry King devotee and he definitely borrowed some elements from his show. I first met Donahue in my dentist’s office, if you can believe that. We started talking and soon become acquaintances. He was definitely the real deal.\n\nNo question, Phil was the king. RIP.\n\nBELLO TO WATERFRONT — (Via Deadline) Maria Bello (Beef) is set as a series regular opposite Holt McCallany in the new Netflix family drama series The Waterfront, written and executive produced by Kevin Williamson.\n\nInspired by true events, The Waterfront dives into the flawed Buckley family as their attempts to retain control of their crumbling North Carolina fishing empire drive them to increasingly dangerous means to keep themselves afloat.\n\nBello will play Mae Buckley, a complex woman who’s married to Harlan (McCallany) and the mother of their two children. After her husband took a step back from the family business, together with their son, she has been running the fishery in very questionable ways in a desperate attempt to save the family.\n\nWilliamson and Ben Fast executive produce for Outerbanks Entertainment. Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, where Williamson is under an overall deal, is the studio.\n\nBello won the Critics Choice Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress this year for her role in Beef. Her film works includes The History of Violence and The Cooler. She’ll next be seen in the French/English language film Hell in Paradise\n\nSHORT TAKES — NBC’s trailers of Zachary Quinto new show Beautiful Minds are a tad ominous. He was great as Spock in the Star Trek-movies and I don’t think I can get that image of out my mind … Are you a fan of McDonalds? They’ve been on the scene since 1940. Hard to believe, right. Check out this article from the Independentin the U.K. – https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/mcdonalds-sales-fast-food-chain-competition-high-street-b2597337.html …Monkee-Micky Dolenz was a DJ on CBS-FM; and he’s playing a weddding DJ in the new zom-com The Zombie Wedding.

What an exquisitely done show from Ryan Murphy; from the casting to the writing to the fashion.\n\nA definite highlight and Tom Hollander as Capote was awesome.\n\nMy prediction: he’ll win … HBO on Tuesday announced that Wise Guy:David Chase and the Sopranos, a two-part documentary on the premium cabler’s iconic mob drama The Sopranos and the visionary behind it, will premiere on September 7. The two parts will air consecutively, beginning at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT on the 7th, and will also be available to stream on Max. Here’s the trailer:\n\nNassau County exec Bruce Blakeman has curated some great “free” concerts at Eisenhower Park this summer – where I lived nearby for years. Living Color; Don Felder and even a Taylor Swift-tribute band. The word has not been good on Blakeman, but with numerous commercials and some creative-booking, let’s give him an E for effort … FBI’s Katherine Renee Kane, who portrayed agent Tiffany Wallace, will depart this season. Too bad as she was great. Overlord Dick Wolff keeping his costs down for sure – insiders reports he’s still aggravated that his early Law & Order stars got so rich. Too bad. Wolff is definitely not a one of the good guys …Kudos to Wednesday’s National Radio Day … Caught Ben Affleck’s 2010 drama The Town again and was just blown away. Just sensational direction. With Rebecca Hal, Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner, it was just brilliant … Happy Bday Al Roker (70) and Debbie Gibson (54)!\n\nNAMES IN THE NEWS — Mark Bego; Colin Quinn; Glenn Friscia; Vito Bruno; Alan Cumming; Carson Daly; Matt Lauer; Lee Jeske; Randy Alexander; Tom & Lisa Cuddy; Michael Ellis; Frankie Crocker; Greg D’Alessandro; Steve Immerman; Tony Seidl; Markos Papadatos; and SADIE!\n\nImages on this page have been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license."
