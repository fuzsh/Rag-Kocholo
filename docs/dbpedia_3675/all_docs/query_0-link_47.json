        "text": "This obituary may be late to the party, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t pay my respects to the late Shelley Duvall, who left us on July 11, 2024. The news of her passing both shocked and saddened me, as did a good many others who were fans of her film roles and of Faerie Tale Theatre. As someone who’s spent little over two years reviewing and ranking Faerie Tale Theatre episodes, I can attest to the impact she’s made on my life.\n\nMiss Duvall seems something of an unconventional heroine in both her filmography and in her own life. I’ve previously mentioned how much of her life story mirrors that of Rapunzel; coincidentally, she famously played the role in Faerie Tale Theatre’s third episode. From her first screen appearance in Robert Altman’s Brewster & McCloud, critics and co-stars alike noted her fascinating, unconventional appearance, accented by her eccentric wit and enchanting personality. Her presence was a welcome shakeup in the film industry to be sure – but it also meant she could never quite fit into the archetypes Hollywood often boils down for its actresses. She was neither a lust-inducing maiden, a quiet wallflower mother (though Duvall has, ironically, played mothers several times throughout her career), nor a menacing crone. This made it difficult to find more meaningful roles as time went on, but also made the films she featured in that much more special by her inclusion.\n\nI confess, I haven’t seen enough of Shelley Duvall’s features up to this point (something I plan to rectify in the future), yet those I have are the ones that everyone remembers: The Shining, with tormented mother Wendy Torrance, Popeye’s sweetheart Olive Oyl, and the compassionate oddball mother in Tim Burton’s short film version of Frankenweenie, to name a handful. Even under the guidance of esteemed directors such as Altman and Kubrick, she truly made those parts her own.\n\nOf course, I need hardly tell you how much I appreciate and admire the work she put into producing every episode of Faerie Tale Theatre, where she reimagined familiar stories into exquisitely designed and brilliantly acted television that could even rival Disney at their best. While the Mouse House’s animated features have made me an ardent admirer of fantasy and romantic adventures, I doubt I’d be half the fairy tale fan I am today if it wasn’t for this wonderful show she created. It was a part of my childhood, and if you’ve visited this blog but once, you’ll find it’s an even bigger part of my adulthood.\n\nIt’s bittersweet seeing the outpouring of sentiments and reevaluation of Miss Duvall’s career in the wake of her passing. One wishes she were here to see it; despite the blathering of certain exploitative talk show “doctors”, she would have understood and appreciated the thoughts sent her way. I envy those who were deep into the Faerie Tale Theatre fandom well before I was aware it even existed, who got to convey their gratitude to Shelley herself while she was still with us. Though the chance for me to do so has passed with her, I’d like to express my feelings now:\n\nThank you, Shelley Duvall.\n\nThank you for the years of laughter, tears and screams.\n\nThank you for showing us the wonder and joy in revisiting stories through a child’s eye.\n\nThank you for everything.\n\nRest in peace, our Faerie Tale Theatre queen.\n\nIn honor of Shelley Duvall, I will be donating all of August’s Patreon earnings to Breakthrough T1D. They are a nonprofit organization doing important work in research and advocacy for diabetes, providing aid to those who suffer from the disesase as well as working with top scientists to develop treatments and lead the way to a cure.\n\nSo, we’ve come to the end of this years-long Faerie Tale Theatre retrospective, my friends. It’s been quite a ride. Unlike most big Hollywood collaborations, Faerie Tale Theatre wasn’t a vanity project or a corporate mandate driven by synergistic greed, but a labor of love from start to finish. There’s been highs and lows, but I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t any passion put into every minute of it. If the acting isn’t magnetizing and subtle, then it’s entertainingly over-the-top. And the idea of basing the production design off famous illustrators and works of art is a masterstroke, branding every episode with a unique identity. Many of the entries provide an entertaining fairy tale alternative to Disney; others you can derive pleasure from the camp value, nostalgia, or the recognizable names involved.\n\nWill time be as kind to Faerie Tale Theatre as it has been to many products of the 1980s? Who can say? I’ve already touched on how the age is beginning to show in some aspects (namely the special effects and some enforced heteronormativity). But a good work, while not free from criticism, can still stand strong regardless. New generations have already begun to discover this series, whether it’s through their parents, a casual find on the internet, or through youtubers reacting to episodes and reviewing them, some of which I found quite entertaining.\n\nTwo qualities that routinely define my favorite pieces of media – be it film, plays, television, etc. – is whether the work in question has grown and changed as I’ve continued to mature, and if I can find something new with every viewing. I’m delighted to say that Faerie Tale Theatre boasted both these qualities in spades during my revisit, and I can proudly declare without irony or fear of ridicule that it is now one of my favorite shows of all time. It reminds viewers that fairy tales aren’t just for children and shouldn’t be classified as such, but can still give older viewers the same feelings of wonder, terror, and cheer that they had experiencing these stories in their childhood.\n\nReviewing these episodes have been a thrill, and ranking them hasn’t been easy. Some of the assigned places will come as no surprise to you, some will inspire rage, but each one includes a summation of my feelings and a link to the whole review for you to peruse. Feel free to share in the comments what your favorite episode is, and how much of this list I got completely wrong.\n\nShall we begin?\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“The man of my dreams is a prince among men.”\n\n– Princess Jeanetta’s wish for a prince\n\nAnd so Faerie Tale Theatre concludes as it began, with a story from the Brothers Grimm. The Twelve Dancing Princesses isn’t remembered as fondly as fables like The Frog Prince or Hansel and Gretel, but by all accounts it should be. It’s got intrigue, royal balls, magical subterfuge, an underdog hero, interclass romance, and princesses subverting their father’s control through a mix of spells and cleverness; qualities that lend themselves to a potentially infinite amount of reimaginings. Unfortunately Cinderella’s had the fairytale ball/dancing princess market cornered for centuries, and popular culture isn’t ready to let twelve newbies have the floor.\n\nThis is yet another fairytale with alternate versions spanning the globe, mainly in Europe, Russia, Africa and Asia. My personal favorite is a gender-flipped retelling from Scotland called Kate Crackernuts: not only does the titular princess save the prince this time around, but she defies the evil stepsister trope by rescuing her adopted sibling from their abusive mother (Disney adaptation WHEN??). There are also some differing German versions from Hesse and Paderborn competing with the one Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm recorded, which were later folded into their take on the story.\n\nKnowing this, don’t be fooled by the whimsical title. There’s still plenty of darkness beneath the glamor. For example, in the original the princes who failed to solve the riddle of the princess’ whereabouts were executed, which makes the princesses stringing them along seem like actively malicious characters (Women portrayed negatively in a Grimms’ fairy tale? The devil you say!) Victorian editors wisely saw fit to remove the death penalty and sympathize the princesses in their retellings. Andrew Lang’s version temporarily imprisoned the failed suitors in the enchanted dominion they tried to sneak into. Other renditions have the princesses under a spell where they’re compelled to dance each night with evil giants or demons in disguise until the hero liberates them. The most common alteration, however, is trimming the number of dancing royals to as little as three or one in order to keep things simple.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“Love is a disease only humans catch. Somehow you’ve caught it, and when you’ve caught it, you can never be rid of it.”\n\n– The Sea Witch’s definition of love, directed towards the lovestruck titular character\n\nThere’s a turning point in a child’s life where one discovers that the stories they knew weren’t always sunshine and happily endings. Nine times out of ten, the tale that causes that shocking realization is The Little Mermaid. If you’re only familiar with the animated Disney classic, as is the case for most within my generation, then the revelation of how it originally goes is a bitter pill to swallow. That moment came for me when I received a storybook containing folktales about the sea. I turned to The Little Mermaid first since it was the only one I was familiar with and…\n\nYep, there’s a lot to unpack here.\n\nMermaids have a long, rich history in folklore around the globe. The short Western version is take the bird-like Sirens of Greek mythology, throw in some manatee sightings by horny sailors during the Golden Age of Sail and BOOM, you got your alluring half-human half-fish women. The beauty and mystery surrounding these creatures have inspired countless works of art and literature, chief among them being the fairytale by this walking case of internalized gay panic.\n\nAh Hans Christian Andersen, the forerunner of all angsty self-insert incels. Granted, when you’re an awkward lonely kid with bisexual leanings growing up in a time where anything remotely gay was considered sinful, you’re bound to develop a few issues. Hans was deeply in love with several women way out of his league throughout his lifetime, but it’s been well-documented through correspondence with male friends that he had feelings for men as well; feelings that he barely acted upon because they weren’t reciprocated (and also the toxic “homosexual = hellbound” mindset). That desire to be with someone living in a remotely different world, to walk alongside them even if every step is pure silent anguish, even if they’ve already given their heart to someone else of the opposite gender, makes Hans’ Little Mermaid all but an open confession of his forbidden love.\n\nIt’s no surprise that such an evocative, passionate fairy tale would become one of Disney’s biggest hits. But here’s where opinions on it split. Many fairy tale critics and die-hard Andersen fans lambasted Disney’s Little Mermaid for erasing the grimmer aspects and giving it a happy ending where the mermaid gets her legs and the guy. This in turn gave way to armchair critics and fake feminists (or “faux-minists” as I call ’em) shitting on the movie for supposedly teaching girls to throw away their lives for a man. But consider this: if the original story has queer undertones, wouldn’t the superior ending be the one where the lead achieves her goals despite the odds? Hell, I know several trans people who cited Disney’s Little Mermaid as their guiding light during their transitional journey. After all, the movie is about a woman who is fascinated by a world she is barred from because of her body, is repeatedly told by controlling bigoted parents that her feelings are wrong, undergoes a physical transformation to be a part of that world, and ultimately finds comfort, acceptance and true love in her new appearance. Plus it was written by openly gay Disney maestro Howard Ashman, god rest his soul. If this film ain’t a positive LGBT+ allegory, then I don’t know what is.\n\nAnd how does Andersen’s Little Mermaid go? Well, the mermaid’s princely pursuit is but part of her goal. In the story, mermaids are blessed with an incredible lifespan but not immortality because they lack an immortal soul. The only way to obtain one is by earning a human’s love. Then their soul rubs on you like a cat shedding hair on your pants, never to come off. So in order to win the prince’s love and shoehorn a heap of that Christian moralizing Andersen loved, the mermaid has her tongue cut out in exchange for legs. The prince, however, treats her like a pet, and then tosses her aside when a more socially acceptable companion comes along for him to marry. She then sacrifices her one chance to save herself and jumps from the prince’s wedding ship where her body dissolves to nothing on impact. But it’s okay, because some angels make her an air spirit and say she’ll eventually get into heaven, give or take three hundred years.\n\n…So, to all the folklorists and Disney-hating faux-minists who are reading this, you’re telling me that this miserable tragedy that Andersen wrote in a fit of metaphorical self-flagellation is the best possible outcome? That the true “happy ending” for the coded-gay character is for them to mutilate themselves then DIE, painfully, alone, brokenhearted and forgotten, forced to wait centuries in limbo before they find peace?\n\nAnd that’s not the half of it. Andersen saw fit to tack on one of those Victorian-era morals made to bully children into model behavior. The text explicitly states that the mermaid gets time off her purgatory if a child is good, but if they cry, then each tear adds more to her sentence. P.L. Travers summed it up so succinctly that I’m just going to quote her:\n\nA year taken off when a child behaves; a tear shed and a day added whenever a child is naughty? Andersen, this is blackmail. And the children know it, and say nothing. There’s magnanimity for you.\n\nShe may have been wrong about how Disney handled Mary Poppins, but we stan a queen who calls out manipulative twaddle when she sees it.\n\nAll this is a roundabout way of saying that this Faerie Tale Theatre episode was among the last faithful adaptations of Hans’ Little Mermaid before Disney radically altered it, so grab your Prozac, readers. We’re going deep under the sea of depression.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“I only know that I fell asleep last night, and when I woke up, everything has changed.”\n\n– Rip’s rude awakening shortly after his actual awakening\n\nSo here’s a question for you all: what counts as a fairy tale? A fairy tale (or “wonder tale” as the highfalutin folklorists call ‘em), is, by standard definition, a short story that’s part of the folklore genre where fantastical things happen that are 100% fictional. Snow White, for example, is a fairy tale. It takes place in an unspecified time and place long ago and far away, and is full of dwarfs, witches, magic, all that good stuff. Pinocchio, despite its inclusion in Faerie Tale Theatre and in the standard children’s fantasy pantheon, is NOT a fairy tale. It’s a novel comprised of episodic writings originally published in a magazine.\n\nLikewise, today’s subject isn’t a fairy tale, but a short story set in late eighteenth century America that draws on some legends and fantasy tropes. My guess is as good as yours as to why Shelley Duvall thought to feature Rip Van Winkle in in this series if that’s the case. Maybe its fantasy elements made it easy to mistake for a fairy tale. Maybe they were running out of stories to adapt. Or maybe, and this is wholly speculation on my part, this episode was meant to be a back door pilot for Shelley Duvall’s Tall Tales & Legends (basically Faerie Tale Theatre but with American folktales such as Pecos Bill).\n\nRip Van Winkle came about thanks to a conversation between writer Washington Irving and his brother-in-law Henry Van Wart. While he was trying to come up with ideas, the two reminisced about the past. They got so wrapped up in nostalgia that Irving felt as those he was back home in the Hudson Highlands. Inspired, he overcame his writer’s block and penned the first draft in a single night. Irving described the experience, appropriately enough, as “feeling like a man awakened from a long sleep”. Rip Van Winkle was included in Irving’s 1819 anthology The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent and was a huge success. Over two-hundred years later and “Rip Van Winkle” is still a shorthand term for one who sleeps well past their time into a strange new era.\n\nThere are a handful of fairy tales worldwide that bear similarities to Rip Van Winkle, from Germany’s Peter Klaus to Japan’s Urashima Tarō, but what surprised me while doing research was that this story has some deep biblical roots. There are several tales in Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition involving prophets who miss out on persecution and the destruction of their homelands thanks to God turning them into extremely late sleepers. The dramatic theme of a man lost in time has also branched out into the realm of sci-fi thanks to H.G. Wells, Ursula K. LeGuin, Robert Heinlein, Matt Groening and David X. Cohen, and Rob Grant and Doug Naylor (yes, Futurama and Red Dwarf count as Rip Van Winkle stories. This is a hill I will sleep for twenty years on).\n\nBut since I can tell some of you are already starting to fall asleep too –\n\nLet’s get this review started, shall we?\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“But Dad, I’m also a girl, and girls just want to…they want to…well, see, that’s the problem. I don’t know what it is girls want.”\n\n– Princess Henrietta, whose serious sequestered lifestyle shows her nescience of Cyndi Lauper\n\nThere are more than a few fairytales featuring princesses in need of a good laugh, yet more often not, they’re footnotes that come at the end of the story. The mirthless princess introduced late in “The Golden Goose” cracks up on seeing the world’s first conga line outside her window. One book from my childhood (whose name I sadly can’t recall) centers around a foolish young man named Jack improperly carrying goods to market, culminating in him giving a donkey a piggyback ride, which is what makes “the sad and silent” Princess Melissa laugh for the very first time. Giambattista Basile’s fairy tale collection “Pentamerone” has the framing device of a princess looking for diversion, but that quickly gives way to a story of curses, fetch quests, and some unfortunate period-typical racism. And of course, there’s the Russian fairytale that shares a similar title to today’s episode, “The Princess Who Never Smiled” or “The Unsmiling Tsarevna”. In this story, the protagonist falls in the mud and a mouse, dung beetle, and catfish he helped earlier try to rescue him, which is what ends the princess’ dour streak.\n\nIn all of these instances, the princesses are given as prizes to the men who made her laugh. It’s a morally dubious arrangement by today’s standards, but in my experience, a good sense of humor and the ability to make you laugh is a highly desired quality in a partner.\n\nThat said, none of these stories ever explore the princess’ side of things. What is it that stole her laughter in the first place? How does she feel about being offered up to the first person to get a guffaw out of her? This episode of Faerie Tale Theatre gives us a deeper character exploration than usual, which makes it a rarity among its peers. In fact, apart from bearing an almost identical name to the aforementioned Russian tale, this episode really stands out by being the only one in the series that’s wholly original. The inciting incident, characters, and resolution are entirely new to the fairy tale scene but still feel like they’re from a traditional story, albeit with some added modern colloquialisms that feel like a precursor to Shrek at times. The outcome in particular bears a touch of modern wit while still adhering to standard folkloric tropes. You may have noticed that I described the protagonists in the other stories as “foolish”. That was intentional; these heroes embody the fool archetype I previously discussed in The Boy Who Left Home to Find Out About The Shivers. And much like the classic fool, the one who comes to the rescue here does so through the simplest of acts…\n\nContinue reading →\n\nNOTE: Throughout the month of May I’m raising money for the American Cancer Society, Please read to the very end of the post to see how you can help.\n\n“Are there any of you who wish to live happily ever after?”\n\n– A tantalizing offer from the Genie of the Lamp\n\nAladdin: genies, magic lamps, flying carpets, vast deserts, beautiful princesses, wicked viziers, it’s just your basic Arabian fairytale from The One Thousand and One Nights, right?\n\nThough the stories within The One Thousand and One Nights (aka The Arabian Nights) were collected by Asian, Arabic, and African authors over several centuries, Aladdin was shoehorned in by Antoine Galland as part of his French translation of the anthology. It was based on a folktale that Galland claimed he heard from the Syrian storyteller Hanna Diyab in 1709. This “original” iteration takes place in China though it retains the Arabian elements we’ve come to expect, including there being a sultan instead of an emperor. There’s also an unusual epilogue where the evil sorcerer’s brother disguises himself as a medicine woman as part of an elaborate ruse to get revenge on Aladdin. Considering the bizarre, forced turns many of the Disney direct-to-video sequels took in order to justify their existence, I’m surprised none of the Aladdin sequels decided to take a page from there and give us “JAFAR’S CRAZY BROTHER!!”\n\nWith the advent of cinema and rise of filmmaking technology, Aladdin and Aladdin-type stories became a recurring staple of adventure-fantasy flicks set in the Middle East (as viewed through the West’s warped exoticism-heavy lens, of course). The earliest surviving animated film, The Adventures of Prince Achmed, boasts elements of Aladdin, as does Richard Williams’ unfinished masterpiece The Thief and the Cobbler; the latter, in addition to The Thief of Baghdad and The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, would go on to inspire the best-known (and overall best) version of the story in modern culture, the 1992 animated Disney classic. Today’s Faerie Tale Theatre episode is one of the last adaptations of Aladdin before Disney swallowed everything that came before and after it. So how does it hold up?\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“The people care not one whit for the inner workings of government. They only care that I look the part. If I’m to appear as a slovenly, disheveled ragamuffin, the subjects would assume that I am as common and ordinary as they are and unfit to rule this vast kingdom. No, they want to look up to me. They need to admire me. They demand I oppress them! And I shall.”\n\n– The Emperor’s raison d’etre that proves to be his undoing\n\nNow we go from one fashion-centric fairytale about maintaining royal appearances to another. The Emperor’s New Clothes is the story that best encapsulates the lesson “clothes (don’t) make the man”. Though popularized by Hans Christian Andersen, the original version goes as far back as 1300s Spain. It’s one of many cautionary tales collected by Prince Juan Manuel of Villena in his moralistic compendium Libro de los ejemplos. Leaning into the fact that these stories were not intended for children, the king in this narrative is tricked into buying a suit that’s “invisible” to any man who’s not the son of his presumed father. A similar story is told in India, where the ruse is exposed when the commoners ask their king if he’s become a naked monk.\n\nAndersen was unfamiliar with the Spanish original but based his take on a German translation. The alterations he made reflected his ire towards the vanity, pride, and false intellectualism of the upper class. One such change, however, reflects an incident in Andersen’s own life. As a boy, his parents took him to see the king’s procession through town; so much hype was built up around him that upon seeing the monarch for himself, young Andersen declared “But he’s only a man!” Despite his family shushing him, he would not be silenced. There’s little doubt that this scene influenced the climax of his story.\n\nHollis Robbins, in her critique of The Emperor’s New Clothes, states that the tale is so transparent that there’s no need for scrutiny. If you’ll forgive the expression, it wears its moral on its sleeve. And yes, I can see where Robbins is coming from, but that doesn’t make it any less important. In the wake of certain administrations and the ongoing battle to bring them to justice, it’s more important than ever to point out the naked truth regarding corrupt, self-serving officials instead of swallowing the lies they deck themselves in. This story is foundational in teaching those young and old that change can begin when someone has the courage to say that the Emperor has no clothes.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“Bootmaker, I’m looking for a boot as light as air and fast as the wind. A boot that makes no sound, leaves no tracks.” “You’re in luck, I’ve got one pair left!”\n\n– A feline acquires his defining bit of footwear\n\nFairytales are full of trickster mentors that aid the hero in their quest. The amount of stories where the mentor takes the form of a wily animal are beyond counting. Cats are a particularly popular choice for the role on account of folklorists making their natural stealthiness and hunting prowess shorthand for cunning and guile. And there’s no fairy tale feline more renowned for their craftiness than Puss in Boots.\n\nWalking into this review I assumed Puss in Boots was going to be a Charles Perrault original, which is how I was introduced to it, but the story actually has Italian roots. The oldest known version is 1550’s Constantino Fortunato, or “Fortunate Constantine” by author and fairytale collector Giovanni Francesco Straparola. One of several tales included in the two-volume collection The Facetious Nights, the story is about a poor boy who marries a princess thanks to a clever cat. It’s interesting to note that this cat isn’t just a magical talking cat but a fairy in disguise; a detail that fell by the wayside in future retellings. Writer Girolamo Morlini wrote his version of Puss in Boots shortly afterwards (fair turnabout since Straparola often borrowed from Morlini), followed by Giambatta Basile in 1634. Then Charles Perrault popularized the tale in France as part of his fairy tale collection (the same that also launched the character of Mother Goose), and the feline’s fame hasn’t dwindled since. He’s even well-known in Japan, where a popular film by Toei Animation has made him the studio’s mascot.\n\nPuss in Boots is one of those fairytales that falls into a gray area where the moral is concerned…in that there isn’t really one at all. If you go by a purely textual reading of the story, the takeaway is that lying, cheating and stealing will get you what you want without any consequences; not much of a lesson (but one that’s far too relevant if you look at the current state of the Republican Party). On the flip side, Puss uses his wits to make the most of his and his master’s lousy circumstances. He’s simply doing what he can with what little he has to improve their situation. The story takes place in a society that favors the first-born son, so it’s easy to root for the youngest son stuck with naught but a wisecracking mouse-catcher while his selfish brothers have the means to support themselves. The men and monsters Puss deceives are largely deserving of his trickery.\n\nTying into that is the unusual choice of clothing this cat in footwear. It’s not just for aesthetics, I assure you. Shoes were a luxury afforded only to young people of the upper-class in the Middle Ages because they were outgrown or worn through so quickly. As such, boots were a sign of wealth and status.
