The Iris Theatre was not a movie palace. It was a second-run theatre, specializing mostly in westerns and Saturday serials. But for me it was a kind of paradise. I got to see every western movie produced at the time as I watched Ken Maynard, Hoot Gibson, Bob Steele, and a host of other gun-slinging good guys chase the rustlers. But it was a seven-day-a-week job, and my salary was eleven dollars a week. At the time it didn’t seem that onerous. I worked steadily at the Iris for a year until I\n\n*\n\ngot a job as an office boy at the Humble Oil Company and immediately enrolled in night classes at the University of Houston. As I roamed the aisles of the Iris, manned the concession stand popping the corn, and did a bit of janitor work, I could never in my wildest conjuring of the future have forecast that some twenty-five years later I would be one of the leaders of the Hollywood movie industry. I met on several occasions a unique figure in the theatre business, Will Horwitz. He owned, at the time, the Uptown, the Texan, the Ritz and the Iris, all managed by my Uncle Fred. Mostly I saw Mr. Horwitz at his annual Christmas party at the downtown Sam Houston Coliseum, giving away toys and food to disadvantaged kids in Houston. As I look back, I view with mounting admiration the philan-\n\nv ii\n\n00 Welling 2rev page proofs 0007 7\n\n8/29/07 2:04:28 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nthropy of Will Horwitz, unmatched in Houston, and on a scale rarely to be found today. He was also an implacable foe of the major studios and their distribution arms, fighting them tenaciously, accusing them of antitrust violations. The Supreme Court in the early fifties would agree with Horwitz and his colleagues. Their decision marked the slow undoing of the studio contract system, the collapse of the corporate embrace that nurtured stars, directors, and writers. These were the glory days of the movie palaces in Houston. In downtown Houston could be found the Majestic, the Metropolitan, Loew’s, and the Kirby—large and inviting, their ornate architecture and vast auditoriums singularly equipped for movie viewing. It was an Olympian theat-\n\nrical environment. It never got any better, though at the time we had no idea of the radical, sweeping changes to come, not only in theatrical design but also in the shape and form of the major Hollywood studios, whose fortunes and changes I presided over for almost thirty-nine years. But it is all fastened in my memory. I can still see those westerns at the Iris, still fascinated by the sounds of horses galloping and gunfights on the plains. It was a halcyon era for theatres in Houston. For me, the nostalgia still brims over with a boy’s awe and wonder. jack valenti Former Chairman and CEO, Motion Picture Association of America\n\nv iii\n\n00 Welling 2rev page proofs 0008 8\n\n8/29/07 2:04:28 PM\n\nintroduction\n\nacknowledgments\n\nSome books come together in a blink of an eye. This was not such a project. Initial research began in 1991, involving digging around in numerous files and archives, talking with people, and many, many eye blinks. Because many of the theatres referred to have long since been demolished, and a good number of those who worked at them are no longer around, the prime source of information has been newspaper accounts from years past, along with a large number of secondary sources. Above all, thanks goes to the two newspapers that reported day-to-day life in Houston during the last century: the Houston Post, the library and photo files of which were explored during the early part of the project, and the Houston Chronicle. Most of the dates, details, and accounts were culled from these two vital sources.\n\n*\n\nThanks also go to the other local newspapers, which helped to fill in the gaps, including the Houston Press, the Leader, the Houston Business Journal, the Metropolitan Civic News, the Pasadena Citizen, and the Public News. The Metropolitan Research Center at the Houston Public Library was invaluable in helping assembly the background information and photographs for the book. Joel Draut deserves knighthood, or at least an Indiana Jones archaeology award, for his astute ability in uncovering long-forgotten photographic antiquities. His knowledge and darkroom wizardry is beyond measure. Other individuals and institutions that were of great benefit include Steven Fenberg with Houston Endowment Inc.; Alfred Cervantes with the Houston Film Commission; the archives of the Museum of Fine Arts,\n\nix\n\n00 Welling 2rev page proofs 0009 9\n\n8/29/07 2:04:28 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nfinding many elusive photos, and played me some great tunes. Special thanks also goes to Roy Bonario for his aid and historical knowledge and for generously allowing many of the photographs and clippings from his collection to be used in this book—and to his wondrous Memory Shop, which, during the seventies and eighties, caused me and countless others to wholeheartedly embrace the endless aspects of collecting. Photos and stories also came from other invaluable sources: Alvin Guggenheim, whose father played a major role in theatre operations in Houston; Charles Paine of both the Jefferson Amusement Company and Tercar Theatre Company; Carroll A. Lewis, who shared stories and photos of the Post Oak Drive-in and Movieland Golf, and of finding diamonds in a truckload of dirt; Jim Ohmart, for details and pictures from the world of Cinema West; Jim Koehn, whose theatre paintings I have admired for many years; Ray Hugger, for sharing his family photos; and Becky and Parker Riggs—his passion for drive-ins surpasses my own. Thanks also to Story Sloane III of Story Sloane’s Gallery, who graciously offered some amazing images from his collection. Thanks to the KPRC Channel 2 group for unearthing the Post Oak Drive-in photos: Ron Stone, Lyn Salerno, Lois Samford, Von Johnson, and Evelyn Hunt. Other individuals who have helped out, by way of information, interviews, photographs, or random acts of kindness, include Jan Bettis, Earl Blair, Bryan Boudreaux, Chad Browning with the Regal Entertainment Group, John Coles, Keith Curtis, Al Davis, Mike Dean, Louis De Rose, Cary Dier, James E. Fisher, Tom Hannegan, Ed Henderson, Gus and Sha-\n\nHouston; the Woodson Research Center at the Fondren Library, Rice University; the University of Houston Special Collections and Archives; and two archives at the University of Texas: the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center and the Center for American History. To Jim Burr, my great editor at the University of Texas Press, major thanks for guiding me through all of the inherent crests and valleys. My heartfelt appreciation also goes to manuscript editors Mary LaMotte and Lynne Chapman, and copy editor Kip Keller for crafting this into a far better book. To Teresa Wingfield, a special thanks for her superb design ability. I know all too well the effort involved in this craft; her creative vision has made this book complete. My heartfelt thanks to former Houstonian Jack Valenti, who without hesitation consented to write the foreword, but did not live to see the final book. From the Horwitz theatres to his leadership of the MPAA, motion pictures were a central part of his life. He passed away on April 26, 2007, and I would like to think that with his words, he came home one last time. Invaluable to this project was Gary Warwick, who generously shared a wealth of photos, many hours of his time, and stories of the Ritz, Will Horwitz, and Eddie Miller (to name just a few). Thanks also to Al Zarzana, who played a big part in Houston’s theatrical past. By sharing with me numerous photos and stories, giving me leads on new areas of research, and clarifying portions of the text, he contributed enormously to the book. My profound appreciation as well to Ray M.

Recollected through words and pictures, it embraces a time gone by, places that no longer exist, and the people who made it happen. Mostly it is about rosecolored glasses—which is, after all, what the cinema has always been about. Movies offer a touch of the fantastic to a sometimes too harsh reality. This sense of wonder is magnified when experienced through the eyes of a child, for whom the surrounding world seems exaggerated and extra large—perhaps because the smaller we are, the bigger everything around us appears. Is it any surprise that people’s memories of their first movie experience are awash with more than the usual rose tinting? Understandably, the screen—for that matter, the whole auditorium—seemed huge at that age. As the smell of candy\n\nmarcus loew\n\nx iii\n\n00 Welling 2rev page proofs 00013 13\n\n8/29/07 2:04:31 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nand popcorn permeated the air, we sat in chairs way too big for us, some with spring-loaded seats that we could barely weigh down. The fear of darkness swelled uncontrollably as the house lights dimmed, plunging the auditorium into black—only to be dispelled as that first image appeared before us on the screen. I remember—if only in bits and pieces, which is to be expected from a five-yearold. Early childhood recollections are elusive and slippery, not quite tangible in the way of later experiences. They come in flashes of half-formed moments. Yet I remember the theatre clearly . . . and as much as I would like to claim that those early memories were of a spectacular picture palace, with its grand antiquefilled foyer leading to a massive auditorium adorned in gold trim and deep, plush velvet curtains—my recollections instead are of a worn-out small-town movie house not far from Houston. The old Alvin Theatre had long since seen its glory days. The seats were worn and torn, the floors sticky from the layers of candy mixed with soda syrup, the air reeked of stale popcorn—and age. It had accumulated a lot of that. The passing years had slowly diminished whatever magic had been entrusted to those walls. This was a modest, unpretentious, barebones kind of affair. The darkness that enveloped the auditorium helped mask the neglect that the theatre had endured over its three decades of existence. In short, the theatre was a rattrap. That was what my brother called it, and even joked of the tug-of-war he had waged with an oversized rat after dropping his Mars bar to the ground. The tug-of-war was dubious; the oversized rats were not. The place was a dump.\n\nOf course, none of that mattered to us kids. The Saturday matinee was the nevernever land for us. Movies offered escapism, and it made little difference whether the cinematic fare was a western—naturally popular in a small Texas town—cartoons, or cheap science fiction. The attraction on that particular day was Godzilla vs. the Thing, featuring a man in a rubber monster suit and some really bad dubbing. I had tagged along with my older brother, who more than likely had been given parental orders to take me with him. After a visit to the cramped concession stand, positioned in the matchbox lobby behind the ticket window, we took our seats in the kid-filled auditorium. The lights dimmed. The projector lit up the screen. My life has never been the same since. Eventually, my parents forbade us from going to the Alvin movie house—some-\n\nAuditorium of Johnny Long’s Alvin Theatre, 1987.

Long had previously bought the Alvin Grand Theatre, which had been showing flickers since 1919. For Alvinites, Long’s theatre was a center of activity, back in much simpler times. People would “go downtown” on Friday and Saturday nights for a movie or just to sit in their cars and watch the crowds go by. That was Saturday-night entertainment. Aside from a steady stream of motion pictures, live appearances by such luminaries as Tex Ritter and his Musical Tornadoes, Ramblin’ Tommy Scott, and Luke McLuke were also common occurrences. A Bonnie and Clyde stage show, complete with a bullet-ridden Model A Ford parked in front of the theatre, would sell out the house. Midnight spook shows with live productions were also held, as were occasional church services. The popularity of television, among other forms of entertainment, took its toll, not only on the old Alvin Theatre but also on Long’s entire theatre chain. By the sixties, the Alvin Theatre was a pale ghost of its former glory. Finances were thin, repair and upkeep difficult, and for the wages paid, janitors did a bare minimum. Finally, the roof that had long been weakened by water damage gave way. It came crashing down into the auditorium during an evening feature. Amazingly, only one minor injury occurred. As for recompense, the patron was quite satisfied with the theatre management covering her doctor bill, and never was heard the discouraging word “lawsuit.” Again, those were simpler days. The roof was rebuilt, but the theatre’s end was in sight. Long’s closed down, and except for its brief stint as a place of worship, sat dormant, neglected, and forgot-\n\nthing to do with its nasty condition. This reason made little sense to us kids. What did we care if the floors were sticky and the walls were destined to fail the whiteglove test? Regardless, it was deemed offlimits. The old theatre would close soon after that, leaving Alvin without an indoor theatre until a new one was built in 1968. When the old theatre eventually opened its doors again, it was as a place for religious revivals, and people came for prayers and sermons, not cowboys and Indians. Eventually, it would close for good, falling into disrepair before facing demolition in 1996. long’s alvin theatre, as it was originally called, was quite a big deal when it opened in 1936. A story (“New Alvin Theatre to Open Friday, Feb. 28th”) in the Alvin Sun touted its modern design and construction, which featured a vaudeville stage accented with rich, crimson velvet curtains and large dressing rooms on either side. The townsfolk flocked to the February 28 gala event, paid their twenty-five-cent admission, listened to a mayoral dedication, and then watched the Harold Lloyd comedy The Milky Way. The Alvin High School girls pep squad presented the patrons with spring flower arrangements as they entered. As a second newspaper story (“Completion of New Theatre Is Source of Pride to Citizens of Alvin and Community,” Alvin Sun, February 28, 1936) noted, this was the fifteenth theatre in Johnny G. Long’s theatre circuit, which included houses in Texas towns such as Bay City, Port Lavaca, El Campo, and Beaumont. His was an independent chain that booked second-run films, usually after their initial showings in the Houston xv\n\n00 Welling 2rev page proofs 00015 15\n\n8/29/07 2:04:32 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nten. The roof would eventually collapse again, exposing the balcony to the elements. A few years shy of demolition, the balcony itself would fall, effectively barricading the lobby entrance. Rusted theatre chairs and torn remnants of the movie screen were all that was left inside. The old Alvin Theatre was razed in 1996 as part of a downtown-revitalization program.\n\nare rare. Unless they are noteworthy landmarks, most buildings fall with little or no fanfare. This is especially true of Houston’s movie houses, which die without the crowds, reporters, or klieg lights that heralded their ribbon-cutting births. Instead, there may only be a passively curious onlooker as the demolition crews do their work. Left behind are memories, along with newspaper clippings and photographs, for a legacy. Reduced to rubble, these structures are swept away to make room for newer structures, freeway construction, and that ever-popular use for property, the parking lot. Some are converted to retail space, their innards ripped out and discarded in the name of commerce. Euphemistically, it is called progress. For historians, it goes by another, less favorable word, but by any name, the buildings are forever lost. What remains today of the downtown Houston theatres can be counted on one hand. The 1926 Ritz/Majestic Metro Theatre is the only downtown movie house to have been restored, and now functions as a venue for special events. The artistic integrity of the restoration rivals that of the suburban Alabama Theatre, which was restored and reopened as part of the Bookstop chain of bookstores. In both cases, though no longer commercial cinemas, they succeed for other uses because the architecture remains faithful to its original intent. In fact, they are more appreciated now for their “theatre-ness” than they were during their final years of running flicks. The building that housed the Isis, Houston’s first deluxe theatre, sat unused for years before undergoing a restoration in 1998 (although the theatre itself was\n\ntales of the big city were not that different from those of its small-town cousins. In an early-seventies edition of the Houston Post there ran a short paragraph paying homage to one of Houston’s great movie houses. Accompanying the text was a series of photographs of the abandoned theatre, taken by a staff photographer. Below these images ran the following copy: In January 1923, reporters hailed the new Majestic Theatre at 908 Rusk as the “playhouse the duplicate of which cannot be found in America.” On opening night, Houstonians from Rev. Peter Gray Sears to Mayor Oscar Holcombe flocked to the Majestic to see Henry B. Walthall starring in The Unknown. This week— after almost 50 years of vaudeville, musical productions, dramatic performances and movies—little is left from the Majestic except for the rubble of demolition crews. Modern economic conditions and contemporary entertainment trends had taken their toll. Now the broken and discarded remains of Greek statues, Roman pillars, Italian Renaissance fixtures and electric exit signs are mute testimony to the years gone by. Architectural obituaries such as this xvi\n\n00 Welling 2rev page proofs 00016 16\n\n8/29/07 2:04:33 PM\n\nintroduction The 1912 Isis Theatre after reopening as the Mercantile Brewery in 2000, with the upper-wall ornamentation still intact. Photograph by David Welling.\n\nDallas, San Antonio, and Austin have all held on to their Majestics, refurbishing them into performing arts centers. Efforts to raise public interest, find sponsors, and secure much-needed funds can effectively turn a losing proposition into a profitable one. Houston missed the boat in this area. Yet with the current revitalization of the downtown area, and the conversion of previously vacant buildings into private lofts, the prospect of such a restored performance center could have been quite feasible. The downtown theatres originally died off because of the push toward suburbia. Now the downtown district is rediscovering itself, but sadly, none of the original showplaces still stand. More’s the pity. Likewise, the original suburban theatres, which lured patrons from the downtown area, have also faced extinction. These were never palaces on the grand scale of their predecessors. Instead, they offered what is now considered the stereo-\n\nlong gone). Only a few architectural remnants remained from its movie house days. The Zoe/Capitol building, at 719 Main, still stands, but the theatre is gone. The Scenic, at 113 Travis, was neither glamorous nor expansive, merely a nickelodeon-style business operating in the early teens. It is now part of Treebeard’s Restaurant in Old Market Square. The eatery takes up the former 113, 115, and 117 lots, and the space for the former movie house is still visible on the floor. Historical respect is an elusive thing, especially when dealing with the intangibles that make something historic. If the qualifying factor is age, then at what point does a building make the transition from just old to historic? In Houston, a structure is eligible for historic status after fifty years; the ill-fated Shamrock Hotel (1946–1986) was razed after only forty. Other buildings don’t last even that long, falling quickly to the wrecking ball. x v ii\n\n00 Welling 2rev page proofs 00017 17\n\n8/29/07 2:04:34 PM\n\ncinema*houston A weathered wall advertisement for the Zoe Theatre (home of Paramount Pictures), c. 1995.

Of this period, from roughly the thirties through the fifties, only the River Oaks has survived intact and active—and at the time of this writing, its future is uncertain. Some others still stand, either gutted and serving other functions or closed and abandoned. The rest have been demolished. Taking the place of these theatres are the multicinemas and megaplexes, which have grown to as many as thirty screens. After a long period of throwing up matchbox theatres, movie-house owners are slowly rediscovering spectacle. Stadium seating, the reappearance of large-scale auditoriums (and large-scale lobbies), and food bars are all part of the redefining of the modern cinema. Still, even the most expansive of these new cinemas can’t hold a candle to the palaces of the twenties. Nowadays, they would simply cost too much to build. No more Greek statues, mezzanines filled\n\nwith fine antique furniture, or Egyptian temple interiors. All this was of a different time, when movies, along with the places that showed them, were magic—palaces of light that did not stand the test of time. But a wealth of photographs does survive. It is these photographs, along with a wide variety of other documentation, that form the heart and soul of this book. For those too young to have known the Metropolitan, Loew’s State, or the Majestic, this is as much of their grandeur as we will ever get to experience. Going to the movies was meant to be a spectacle, both on the screen and in the theatre itself. It was meant to be larger than life. It was meant to be remembered. Here, then, is a celebration of what once was and will never be again, of an age when going to the movies was a magical experience. If you look hard enough, you may very well find that the photographs here still contain that magic. Sit back, enjoy, and don’t forget the popcorn. x v iii\n\n00 Welling 2rev page proofs 00018 18\n\n8/29/07 2:04:35 PM\n\nintroduction\n\nn\n\nh o u s t * * *\n\no n\n\nc\n\ni\n\na e m\n\nxix\n\n00 Welling 2rev page proofs 00019 19\n\n8/29/07 2:04:35 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nThe Sweeney & Coombs Opera House.

E. Amerman in a 1948 Houston Press column by Paul Hochuli.1 “And a Mr. E. E. Taylor—who ran the movie—told me that when he operated it, the movie was the first in Houston.” Recollections such as this, found in yellowed newspaper clippings, represent all that is left of Houston’s introduction to motion pictures. According to Amerman, the movie house was on the east side of Main Street between Rusk and Capitol, right next to a rose garden. Amerman died in 1958. The theatre is long gone. So are the roses. In the same article, Joseph Hornberger told of his first movie, also around the turn of the century. “The first one I attended was on Congress Avenue, on the (then) present location of Zindler’s, and was\n\nI didn’t like the play, but then I saw it under adverse conditions—the curtain was up. groucho marx\n\n01 Welling 2rev page proofs 0011 1\n\n8/29/07 2:05:57 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nabout in the middle of the block. In order to make the room dark, they had blackpainted canvas stretched around the room. There were a few chairs, and a sheet was used as a screen. Admission was 10 cents. “In those days, when a picture was finished, the house was cleared. If you wanted to see it again, you had to pay again. I saw it four or five times.” The Houston of 1900 was a fast-growing city with a population of 44,600, an increase of over 17,000 from the decade before. Cotton and lumber were the major sources of commerce, as was rail transportation, Houston being a junction for fourteen railroads. Water connections through Buffalo Bayou and the Gulf of Mexico served as the other factor in the city’s growth. As with most cities, the hub of activity was the downtown area, and this is where the first motion pictures appeared.2 “The film I saw,” continued Hornberger, “was about a fisherman sitting on a plank extended over a small stream. Along came a fellow in a covered wagon, who stopped, picked up a big rock, and threw it at the opposite end of the plank. Up in the air went the fisherman, coming down in the water. This caused a great deal of laughter, and that’s all there was to the show.” What Hornberger remembered was typical of both motion pictures and the houses in which they were shown. Movies were new to Houston—and the world— and would not gain legitimacy for years to come. While opera and dramatic performances had their own venues in town, it would take time for the motion picture to find its own home. Movies would be sandwiched between live performances as\n\nfiller or left to the small storefront rooms as described by Hornberger. Once introduced to Houstonians, the movies would play an integral part in redefining downtown architecture. The Houston movie theatre would evolve from the performance hall to the nickelodeon and reach its grandest heights in the opulent palaces of the twenties. Still ahead would be the deco-based neighborhood theatres, the drive-ins, the multicinemas, the large multiplexes of the eighties and nineties, and the stadium-seat auditoriums of the new millennium. However, the roots of Houston’s movie houses date back to the 1830s, well before the first motion picture, with the establishment of live theatre. Before the flickers, the stage reigned supreme.\n\nhouston’s first performances John Carlos and Henri Corri The foundations of Houston’s movie theatres began in the 1830s. The playhouses from this period, although crude at first, served a multitude of functions: as entertainment venues, as lecture halls and forums for subjects ranging from literature to politics, and as centers of social activity for much of the population. Plus, an opera house brought respectability and culture to a city. For Houston, support for the dramatic arts was strong at the outset, and much of the patronage came from the political wing of the population, the city being the capital of a new republic. Support would continue with some difficulty after 1839, when the capital was moved to Austin.3\n\n01 Welling 2rev page proofs 0012 2\n\n8/29/07 2:05:57 PM\n\nstaged origins\n\nIn 1837, an early attempt to start a theatrical venue in the city ended in tragedy. G. L. Lyons, an actor from the East, had posted a notice in the March 28 issue of the Telegraph and Texas Register, announcing plans to establish a “dramatic temple” in Houston. After assembling a troupe, he and his players set sail in the Pennsylvania. A gale capsized and sank the schooner, leaving only two survivors. The city’s first true dramatic performances occurred the following year, when merchant John Carlos furnished a building for use as a theatre. At the same time, the Saint Charles Theatre troupe of New Orleans, under the management of Henri Corri, was sailing to Houston from Louisiana. Corri had placed a notice in the Telegraph on May 30, stating that as soon as he had made arrangements for a theatre, the city would be given “amusements worthy of their patronage.” Initial attempts to lease a building called Hubbard’s Exchange led to a problem: to get the playhouse, Corri would have to make Carlos a partner. Carlos lacked Corri’s knowledge of theatrical matters, and therefore grudgingly agreed to be coproducer. Houston experienced its true first night on June 11, 1838, with the presentation of J. Sheridan Knowles’s popular comedy, The Hunchback (1832). Absent from opening night was the orchestra, still en route from Mobile, Alabama. The Carlos-Corri partnership was shortlived. On August 15, Corri bought a fiftyfoot-wide lot in the middle of the block of Congress, between Milam and Travis, opposite Market Square. Meanwhile, financial setbacks forced John Carlos to sell his theatre building. It was bought by Samuel G. Powell in a sheriff’s sale on July 15, 1844, and renamed the City Exchange.\n\nCorri’s Houston Theatre The year 1839 started off well for Henri Corri. His new theatre—the first true theatre building in the republic—opened on February 25 with Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s School for Scandal (1777). During the 1839–1840 season, his theatre took on the permanent name of the Houston Theatre. The Houston Theatre’s operational history was uneven. In October 1839, the theatre closed after a presentation of The Golden Farmer and The Romp because of the “indisposition” of some of the company—or, said the Houston Star, because of the “indisposition of the people to attend and see good pieces murdered.” Attendance slowly dropped over the next several years, in part because of the relocation of the capital. On April 30, 1841, Corri filed for bankruptcy, and by year’s end he and his wife, Eliza, had booked passage back to New Orleans. The Houston Theatre building and property was bought by Robert P. Boyce, the contractor who originally built the playhouse. After completing repairs to the building, A. S. Newton, a member of Corri’s original acting troupe, reopened Corri’s theatre in 1845 with a new company of players.\n\nPerkins Hall (Pillot’s Opera House) The February 16, 1860, issue of the Telegraph announced a new building under construction on Franklin near Main, being built for Captain E. S. Perkins\n\n01 Welling 2rev page proofs 0013 3\n\n8/29/07 2:05:58 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nand James H. Perkins. Perkins Hall, as it became known, would go on to feature most of the great contemporary American performers during its nearly thirty years in existence and to establish itself as the first great playhouse in Houston. In 1879 its name was changed to Pillot’s Opera House when Eugene Pillot undertook a complete renovation of the building. Although Perkins Hall was finished just before the Civil War erupted, it apparently did not open until 1866, when James Perkins—popularly known as “Brother Perkins”—presented Camille on April 12. In December 1867, the spectacular play Under the Gaslight by Augustin Daly was brought to Houston from New York, where it had opened in August. The five-act melodrama dazzled the audience with such stunning effects as New York lit by gaslight, a ferryboat powered by real steam, a climactic rescue from the wheels of an oncoming locomotive (the first use of what would soon become a clichéd suspense device), and a plot turnabout in which the heroine rescued the male. About a year later Perkins Hall was lit with gas for the first time. In 1870 it was remodeled and its seating capacity increased to 1,000. However, by the end of December the theatre had succumbed to the “disease of empty benches,” as described by playhouse actor Edmund D. Langley. Despite this slump, during the early 1870s the theatre hosted such performers as Edwin Forrest, Maurice Barrymore (father of John, Ethel, and Lionel), Buffalo Bill Cody’s company, and Joseph Jefferson.\n\nCity Hall Opera House (Scanlan’s Folly) In the 1870s, Mayor Thomas H. Scanlan decided to tear down the old Houston City Hall and replace it with a fancy combination city hall and market house. Several additional square miles of territory were annexed to acquire the tax base to support the bonds for the project. Originally estimated to cost $250,000, the project became a $470,000 fiasco because of overruns and miscalculations, garnering nicknames such as Scanlan’s Folly, Scanlan’s Palace, and Scanlan’s Scandal. The ground floor contained the city market. An upstairs auditorium, officially titled the Academy of Music, was commonly known as the opera house. According to Dr. S. O. Young, vaudeville was first established in Houston by Ed Bremond.4 The building was completed in the summer of 1874, and then burned in July 1876. Since the structure had been insured for only $100,000, the insurance company made some repairs, but the building burned again a few years later. After Scanlan’s death, his daughters spent a part of their legacy on the construction of a memorial office building—the Scanlan Building. Stella and Lillian Scanlan were also responsible for constructing the Ritz Theatre in 1926. With the city hall opera house gone, only Perkins Hall was left to service Houston’s stage-entertainment needs. However, the hall had become outdated, causing many performers to refuse to appear there. In January 1879, Eugene Pillot announced he would completely renovate Perkins.\n\n01 Welling 2rev page proofs 0014 4\n\n8/29/07 2:05:58 PM\n\nstaged origins\n\nsuited to theatrical needs. It did, however, encourage the building of a new house. On January 15, 1890, new owners J. J. Sweeney and E. L. Coombs announced plans to tear down the existing house and build a new opera house to be ready for the 1890–1891 season. Sweeney declared that by the next season’s opening, Houston would have the “neatest and prettiest opera house in the south.”6 The Sweeney & Coombs Opera House opened on November 3, 1890, with the Grau Opera Company performing Gilbert and Sullivan’s The Gondoliers, but patrons nearly froze when the heating system failed to work. As reported in the next day’s Houston Post, “There was a large audience present, but it was not a good natured one, the house being too cold to render those present thoroughly sensible to the divine charm of music.” The divine Sarah Bernhardt appeared on February 4, 1892, and many were surprised when instead of the lean figure shown in photos of her, there appeared a short plump individual. Many disappointed patrons left before the play was half over, and some even suggested that madam was walking through her part.\n\nGray’s Hall Another new theatre was announced for the 1879–1880 season: Gray’s Hall, located on the west side of Fannin across from the courthouse, was to be converted into a usable playhouse. With Gray’s and Pillot’s, the public was given twice the amount of theatrical entertainment as well as the prospects of a theatrical rivalry for the first time since the Carlos-Corri wars. At the end of 1882 a new contraption was added at Pillot’s—a telephone, allowing playgoers to reserve seats by phone. In 1884, Pillot’s was wired for electric light, as was Gray’s the following year. In 1887, after years of waiting, Houstonians finally were able to see the great actor Edwin Booth. For his performance of Hamlet on February 23, tickets quickly sold out far in advance; in an early example of ticket scalping, seats originally priced at $2 and $3 went for as much as $24 before the show. His Houston engagement also included Othello and Julius Caesar.5 The final performance at Pillot’s Opera House was on April 14, 1886. On May 3 the building burned to the ground. The fire appeared to originate from the Bell Variety Theatre, later called the New Variety, around eight in the evening. Within half an hour, both houses were consumed by the blaze.\n\nnew owners took over Sweeney & Coombs in 1904: Hyman Prince, who had previously built the Olympia Opera House in Houston in 1903 (see Chapters 2 and 10 for details), and Harvey T. D. Wilson. The opera house underwent renovation and reopened on Thursday, September 29, 1904, under the new name of the Houston Theatre. Construction was not complete, and chairs for the lower area would not arrive for another week, but the show went on regardless.

At his curtain call on opening night, Murphy said, “God knows you needed a new opera house,” which garnered enthusiastic applause from the crowd. The building would stand only three years before falling victim to fire. A massive blaze swept through several blocks of downtown Houston late in the evening on Sunday, December 1, 1907—beginning in the Dunn Building, where an explosion raised the roof several feet. Evidence suggested arson as the cause. Ironically, great lengths had been taken against fire in the renovation of the theatre, including installing an alarm system and encasing the auditorium in brick firewalls. Performances were moved to the Winnie Davis Auditorium, which required extensive remodeling to accommodate the demands of the detoured performances.\n\nThe Winnie Davis Auditorium. Courtesy of the Houston Metropolitan Research\n\nThe Winnie Davis Auditorium had been opened in 1895. The hall, located at the corner of Main and McGowen and named after the daughter of the former Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, sported electrical connections, but the plumbing was primitive at best. It served its function for the next fifteen years. The Metropolitan Opera appeared there in 1901 for a performance of Richard Wagner’s Lohengrin. Two hundred and fifty extra incandescent lights supplied additional illumination. After a repeat performance four years later, the Met did not return to Houston for forty-two years. In 1910, the new City Auditorium replaced Winnie Davis. A well-proportioned hall that featured a grand proscenium arch, the City Auditorium was used for conventions, society balls, and occasional performances by theatrical stock\n\nCenter, Houston Public Library, MSS 1248-2027.\n\n01 Welling 2rev page proofs 0016 6\n\n8/29/07 2:06:03 PM\n\nstaged origins\n\nInterior of the 1910 City Auditorium.

No-TsuOh (“Houston” spelled backwards), also known as the Houston Carnival, was the big social event of the year and included horse and auto races, poultry and pet stock shows, rodeo events, and daily band concerts, all leading up to a spectacular parade and ball. A highlight of the City Auditorium’s history was the 1920 appearance of Enrico Caruso. Caruso disliked performing live, and therefore asked for exorbitant fees for his solo appearances. He demanded, and received, $12,000, which was placed in a bank thirty days before his appearance. The ticket office was swamped by hundreds of people for the sold-out show. Unwilling to turn them away, concert organizer Edna W. Saunders asked the ushers to open all\n\nthe doors and windows of the hall. The evening air was filled with the voice of the most revered tenor of the day, heard by hundreds of people on the sidewalks outside the auditorium.7 The City Auditorium was razed in 1963 and replaced by Jones Hall. after the Houston Theatre fire, Prince and Wilson laid out plans for a new theatre, to be built on the site of the destroyed playhouse. The Prince Theatre, as it was christened, became Houston’s true transition venue from live entertainment to motion pictures—and in the coming years the two would oftentimes be intertwined, sharing bills and auditoriums. The picture palaces were still years away; after all, motion pictures, still in their infancy, required time to grow.\n\n01 Welling 2rev page proofs 0017 7\n\n8/29/07 2:06:04 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nThe Cozy Theatre, 1919.

For the exhibitor, group participation is simply good business sense: more money can be made selling a single product to a group than to an individual. The original peep-show movie loops of Edison’s Kinetoscope suffered from that basic limitation; only one person could watch at a time. Realizing this, numerous inventors and entrepreneurs quickly forged ahead to create a form of motion picture that could be shown to a large group of people, and Edison and the Lumière brothers led the pack. Edison’s answer was the Vitascope,\n\n* the\n\nthomas a. edison, motion-picture inventor\n\nYoung man, you should be grateful, since, although my invention is not for sale, it would undoubtedly ruin you.

After the 1896 premiere of both the Vitascope and the Lumière Cinématographe, projected moving pictures quickly spread across the nation. These early movies became part of the entertainment programs in opera houses, music halls, and early vaudeville theatres, whereas storefront theatres opened up to showcase film as the primary attraction. Traveling exhibitors would set up tent shows or find empty store space for their exhibits. Others would set up in parks or use the side of a downtown building. Little was needed to go into business: a vacant storefront, chairs, a projector, a white sheet stretched across the wall, and a sign painted on the exterior window. This new form of entertainment blossomed in Houston much as it did in other major cities. In a 1940 Houston Post interview, P. W. Cain spoke of a movie house he opened with his brother, T. E. Cain. The year, according to Cain, was 1902: “We rented a store building in the 300 block of Main for—believe it or not—$20 a month, but the people just didn’t seem to care about motion pictures, and our overhead was eating into our capital fast.” They decided to hold free open-air shows and sold advertising to local merchants. They moved operations to a leased lot at Elysian and Carter, two blocks from the Southern Pacific Roundhouse. After several successful weeks, largely because of merchant cooperation, they moved again to a site on Congress. “It was a tough section over there near the roundhouse in those days,” said Cain. “The neighborhood boys thought it was great fun to toss rocks through the screen and perpetrate other bits of their brand of\n\nhumor, which proved to be embarrassing at times. One night one of the playful lads brought in from the woods one of the striped-back kitties and turned it loose in the crowd. There was no more show that night.”1 For Houstonians at the beginning of the new century, most of the theatrical entertainment could be found in three places: Sweeney & Coombs, the Standard Theatre, and the Grand Theatre. Sweeney & Coombs booked legitimate productions, while stock companies played the Grand. The Standard handled vaudeville, usually two shows a day.2 The Grand would later reopen as the first of the three Majestic theatres that Karl Hoblitzelle established in Houston (see Chapter 4 for a full account of Hoblitzelle’s Houston Majestics). To honor the opening of Hoblitzelle’s third Majestic, in 1923, the Houston Post ran a special section recounting Houston’s early theatrical days. According to the account, one of the earliest motion-picture showings took place in the empty top floor of the building on Congress that later housed Zindler’s store. Inside the projector, a three-foot-diameter flywheel carried a continuous film loop. Power for the projector was brought in from the street-railway wires and reduced to a usable voltage by passing it through two barrels of water. A canvas screen was stretched across one wall, and the audience stood behind a roped-off area.3 This may have been the same theatre that patron Joseph Hornberger recalled in his 1948 Houston Press interview with Paul Hochuli (see Chapter 1).4 In the same Hochuli column, Natalie Carlisle recalled seeing The Pied Piper of Hamelin in 1902: “I had seen it in Dallas, and when I found out it would be in 10\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00810 10\n\n8/29/07 2:06:50 PM\n\nthe nickelodeons\n\nHouston, I made a trip here. I don’t recall exactly where the theatre was, but it seems to me it was either the Isis, or a forerunner at the same location on Prairie between Main and Fannin.” Carlisle’s remembrances point to the main difficulty—fallible human memories—in accurately presenting a chronology of these early theatres. The Isis Theatre was indeed located on Prairie between Main and Fannin, but it did not open until 1912. Carlisle may have been thinking of the Theato at 912 Prairie; however, it was not around until 1910. There also may have been a storefront theatre prior to the Isis around 1902, but documentation for that time is vague. (In addition, The Pied Piper of Hamelin was not released until 1903.)\n\nt h e o ly m p i a o p e r a h o u se (also known as the Standard, the Lincoln, and the Majestic), 7 1 1 prairie The Olympia Opera House first opened its doors in 1903. During its history, the Olympia was known under various names—the Standard, the Texan, and the Majestic—but it was best known as the Lincoln. This may have been the movie house that Natalie Carlisle remembered in the 1948 Houston Press interview. It was constructed in 1903 for Hyman Prince—owner of Sweeney & Coombs (the Houston Theatre)—who intended the showplace to feature vaudeville exclusively. Principal architect for the Olympia was Henry Cook, whose other works included the old Central Fire Station as well as the Rice and Pillot residences in Westmoreland Place. The Moorish-style two-story building was originally designed as an aerodome (or airdome, an open-air theatre) with wooden ceiling slats that could be cranked back during the hot summer months. It was later converted to a fixed ceiling. Seating was approximately five hundred, and the interior illumination was most likely by gaslight.5 By 1905 it had changed hands. The new operators, Alvido and Lasserre, renamed the theatre the Standard. Now functioning as a burlesque venue, it developed a rather scandalous reputation. Already considered an eyesore, it was raided numerous times, only to reopen shortly after each raid. It was eventually shut down by the city. From 1907 it functioned as a brewery warehouse. In 1916 it became an early black professional building, housing law-\n\nthe first motion pictures were void of story—merely a moving snapshot—but narrative soon became an essential part of film and its marketability. Edwin S. Porter, a cameraman and director for the Edison Company, created The Great Train Robbery (1903), an elevenminute tour de force that told a definite story, ending with the startling shot of a cowboy aiming a gun directly at the viewer and pulling the trigger. The public quickly developed an appetite for these short films. While the upper class firmly avoided such lowbrow entertainment, immigrant populations, whose lower incomes matched the affordability of this new medium, flocked to it. Nickelodeons, so called because admission was usually five cents, appeared throughout the downtown districts of all the major and midsized cities of America. In addition, films began to find their place in the larger live theatres of the day. 11\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00811 11\n\n8/29/07 2:06:50 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nup openly in the auditorium, was later moved to an enclosed booth opposite the screen. Because of the flammable nature of the early nitrate film stock, projection booths often included an escape window for the projectionist.6\n\nyers, dentists, and insurance agents. As the Lincoln, the theatre ran a variety of “all colored” films for years to come (see Chapter 10 for a full account of its later history). while the lincoln did not start off as a motion-picture house, others did. The nickelodeons were initially considered a novelty. They would, however, expand the social, moral, technical, and business boundaries of the time. The patrons of 1896 were shocked by the wanton sexuality of The Kiss, a brief film that featured a mustachioed man planting a smooch on the object of his affection. Such scandalous things were not meant to be seen in public, at least not by respectable people. The five-cent picture theatres found homes across the downtown landscape but gained little recognition otherwise. The Houston City Directories initially lumped vaudeville theatres, opera theatres, and nickelodeons together under one heading. Only in 1907 was there a separation into “theatres” and “moving pictures.” As opposed to a grander opera house, a nickelodeon was a simple affair, usually a converted retail space with banners and posters hung outside and a ticket booth next to the door. The interior was generally a long rectangular room measuring some twenty by eighty feet. Seating was either wooden benches or auditorium chairs, and a central aisle ran down the center of the room. Ceiling fans offered the basics of climate control. Occasionally, patrons would have to step up one or two steps to the sloped wooden floor, installed to improve sightlines to the screen. The screen might be fabric or a painted wall. The projector, originally set\n\na s h o r t d e t o u r t o g a lv e s t o n At this time, Galveston gained its first true moving-picture venue, the Globe Theatre on Market Street. Owner-manager Claude Brick had operated a struggling music store at that location, but was enamored of the movies. All the instruments were moved to the front of the store, and down the center was positioned a wall with three openings—a box-office window, an entrance, and an exit. “By this simple process, Claude Brick became Galveston’s first motion picture exhibitor,” said legendary director—and Galveston native— King Vidor, who worked at the theatre, taking tickets for $3.50 a week.7 In his 1953 autobiography, Vidor gave a full account of the Globe’s operations, revealing the day-to-day functions of an early show place. He worked from ten thirty in the morning to ten thirty at night, tearing tickets and running the projector when the operator went to lunch. Access to the projector was limited. He would climb up a ladder and through the sixteen-by-sixteen-inch opening in the cramped galvanized-iron projector booth. The box had an opening for the projector lens, another for the operator to view the screen and focus the image, and another on the opposite side that looked down on the music store. This last opening was there in case of an emergency in either\n\n12\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00812 12\n\n8/29/07 2:06:51 PM\n\nthe nickelodeons\n\nElectric Park: an outdoor venue that featured a combination of vaudeville and moving pictures.

Since the projector had no take-up reel, the projected film would spill out into a large cloth hamper below. During reel changes, an intermission slide was shown, stating: “Just a moment, please, the operator is changing the reel.” Such slides were quite common, and would be used in between features well into the twenties. A second reel would be loaded into the projector, to be fed into another cloth hamper. He would then hand-crank the original film back onto its reel, using a separate rewind. Said Vidor, “This crude process presented a tremendous fire hazard, since sparks from the sputtering arc often fell from the flimsy lamp-house into the hamper of loose film. The resulting explosive flash rarely gave the early operators time to scramble down through the sole means of escape.”8 The Globe ran split-reel comedies and dramas, the “split” referring to two or more stories on the same reel. Many of the comedies were French imports, starring the great Max Linder, France’s Chaplin. At a later date, the two-reel Italian epic Ben-Hur was shown. Admission was raised for the event, from five cents to ten. Vidor’s first exposure to motion pictures was Georges Méliès’s Trip to the Moon (1902) at the Grand Opera House. After his stint with the Globe, he worked as a newsreel photographer before moving to Hollywood. Vidor’s films include The Big Parade (1925), Ruby Gentry (1952), War and Peace (1956), Northwest Passage (1940), and The Fountainhead (1949).\n\nThe term “electric” soon found its way into theatre verbiage as a way to distinguish motion-picture houses from those that featured strictly live performances— although a number of show places included both. The term was also tied in with the overabundance of lights used to showcase the exterior of these early cinemas. The Electric Park, on San Jacinto between Caroline and Prairie, was an outdoor vaudeville space. Billed as the coolest place in town, it featured 3,000 seats, 50 private boxes, and prices ranging from twenty to fifty cents. Tickets were available in advance at Spencer’s Drug Store.9 Motion pictures were often used as the concluding act of the bill. By December, the venue had changed its name to the People’s Theatre. A separate Electric Park Theatre, at 314 Dallas Avenue, was in operation around 1912, operated by the Vaudette Amusement Company.\n\n13\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00813 13\n\n8/29/07 2:06:51 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nThere was also the Electric Theatre on Main, which featured such acts as the dancing, performing Filipino Midgets. Yet another People’s Theatre, at 211 Milam, was listed in the 1910–1911 Houston Directory and was owned by Thomas F. Loftus. While some theatres merely changed locations, the tendency to reuse old theatre names would occur time and time again in the city. The Texas summer heat, then as now, could be torturous. Adequate ventilation proved to be an obstacle for any indoor entertainment venue, and would remain so until the advent of air conditioning. This, along with the ease of putting up a theatre, led to the creation of the airdomes. These open-air theatres consisted of an outdoor space set up with benches, a projector, and a screen. In the evenings, when the temperature cooled off, the overall experience at an airdome could be quite pleasant. One such venue was the Lyric Theatre, located at the corner of Capitol and\n\nSan Jacinto. It too featured motion pictures on a vaudeville bill, and referred to this attraction in its advertising as the Lyricscope. The Lyric was leased by Claude Z. Brand and Henry Hoffman in December 1907, and then outfitted with heating, flooring, and a roof. Brand and Hoffman were already operating vaudeville houses in Galveston and San Antonio at the time.10 It also was the object of court hearings between the owners and manager John Dickey, who had allegedly not fulfilled his part of the verbal contract.11 Most noted in 1908 was the opening of the New Houston Theatre, better known as the Prince. Lesser houses, such as the Alhambra Theatre and the Cozy, were also unveiled during that time. The Alhambra, located at the corner of Rusk and Fannin, was apparently under the same management as that of the Lyric, and was later managed by Robert Sutton. The Cozy, at 1018 Texas, was built by M. F. “Mefo” Foster, then editor of the\n\nAuditorium of the Prince Theatre.

The dailies publicized the gala premiere with the headline “It’s out at last! The near theatre with the real show!” The October 11, 1908, opening night featured the singing and dancing comedienne Louise Hess, Richard Hamlin (“the medley man in brown”), and comedian Garry Owen. The tiny showplace, located in the Light Guard Armory, originally seated 250 people, and would be enlarged on two separate occasions during its brief life. The theatre was run by Maurice Wolf, who, along with his brother, also operated another theatre, the Happy Hour, in the same building at 1022 Texas. The Happy Hour was a tab house, the name referring to the tabloid program, which spotlighted eight to ten attractive girls and a comedian.\n\ntheatre. Patrons were greeted by a 2,000seat auditorium of dark green and cool gray, accented by brass bars and bronze brushwork. The stage utilized two curtains: the asbestos drop curtain featured a central medallion and two tall flame-bearing urns on either side of the stage, while the stage curtain featured a Greek court scene, accented by heavy green velvet drapery. Ceiling and sidewall frescos, plus a great circular light in the ceiling’s center, completed the effect. Over the following years, the Prince would play host to vaudeville acts, melodramas, and movies. Houstonians saw live performances by Sarah Bernhardt, Al Jolson, Fanny Brice, Otis Skinner, John Drew, Lillian Russell, Anna Pavlova, Al G. Fields, James K. Hackett, Mary Mannering, Viola Allen, James T. Powers, Murray & Mack, DeWolf Hopper, Chauncey Olcott, Weber & Fields, and Anna Held. In October 1915, the Prince featured a road show of D. W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation, complete with a thirty-piece symphony orchestra. It returned for a repeat engagement the following February; the ticket prices advertised in a local newspaper ranged from twenty-five cents for gallery seats to two dollars for the lower floor. The Prince featured its own orchestra during the teens and twenties, under the baton of Professor Steinfaldt. On March 3, 1919, a new $10,000 organ was unveiled during a presentation of live acts and film, along with a two-hour recital given by Professor Piller.13 Business slowly dwindled as newer, more elaborate theatres opened. A 1920 newspaper ad showed it, along with the Liberty, Queen, and Zoe, under the management of the Paramount Theatre Cor-\n\nt h e p r i n c e t h e at r e 320 Fannin The Prince Theatre, successor to the burned-down Houston Theatre (the former Sweeney & Coombs Opera House), opened on Thursday, September 24, 1908, with The Land of Nod, a play inspired by Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland. Also featured on the bill was The Salome Dance by Marie Fauchonette.12 The interior was luxurious for its time. As described in Houston Post clippings, “The approach to the main entrance of the new theatre is through a long foyer, the walls of which are white porcelain tiling with a richly artistic frieze of landscape paintings done in oils.” For opening night, ferns and tall palms lined the foyer, and red roses decorated other parts of the\n\n15\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00815 15\n\n8/29/07 2:06:52 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nporation. Eventually, the doors were closed, opening only for an occasional road show. It was then taken over by Loew’s Interests, using the theatre as a showplace for Loew’s vaudeville. This continued through 1922, when the Lewis Worth Stock Company secured it. The building eventually became the property of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. In the thirties, the building was leased to the Classified Parking System and converted into a four-story parking garage, at an estimated cost of $50,000. The building, before the conversion, had become a ghostly, abandoned shell. Chairs were still in place, as was the stage curtain, adorned with advertisements for Cheek & Neal’s Maxwell House Coffee, Lewis’s Fish and Oyster Cafe, and Krupp & Tuffley’s buttoned, bulldog-nosed shoes for men. The dressing rooms were covered with autographs of the personalities that had graced the Prince’s stage. All this disappeared when the Prince became a twenty-four-hour hotel for cars. This, too, would eventually be razed.\n\nThe Bijou, at 413 San Jacinto, was an open-air theatre with a top constructed of a gas-pipe framework and a black tarpaulin that could be thrown back on sunny days. The auditorium was heated by gas stoves during the colder periods.14 The Vendome, featuring “polite vaudeville,” was owned by W. F. Box and located at 406 Fannin. Its grand opening took place on April 18, 1909, with six highclass acts. As advertised in a newspaper of the day, admission was ten cents, and reserved seats cost an extra dime. It reopened in 1910 under new management. Movies featured there, such as those by Pathé and Biograph, were advertised as Vendomescope. It offered special bargain matinees on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons at two thirty.15 Another “polite vaudeville” house was the Passmore, at 414 Fannin. By December 1909, it changed names after being bought out by A. Schwartz, who had worked with the London Hippodrome and the New York Columbus Theatre. It was renamed the Imperial Grande, and later still it would change to the Orpheum, under the management of John B. Kelly.16 The year 1910 marked the opening of two important structures: Karl Hoblitzelle’s second Majestic Theatre, which opened in February, and the new City Auditorium, which opened on December 8. The new Majestic was, for its time, the grandest of the local theatres. Upon its opening, a Houston Chronicle reporter stated that it would be “compared favorably with the gilded palaces of ancient kings” (see Chapter 4 for a full account of Hoblitzelle’s Houston Majestics).17 Another smaller-scale theatre was the\n\nsmall e r v e n u e s o f t h e t i m e The 1908–1909 period gave rise to a number of smaller theatres: the Happy Hour, at 1022 Texas, managed by Harry Bonn; the Superba, at 403 Main; the Victor, at 412 Milam; and the Scenic, at 313 Travis, owned by Charles F. Bode. Its structure still stands as part of Treebeard’s Restaurant in Old Market Square. Another Scenic was listed in the 1910–1911 Houston Directory at 507 Main, under the proprietorship of Bode and Isenhour.\n\n16\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00816 16\n\n8/29/07 2:06:52 PM\n\nthe nickelodeons\n\nGiuseppe de Liguoro’s Dante’s Inferno (1909) was Italy’s first full-length feature film, and it became an international hit when released in America in 1911.

It would entertain patrons throughout the twenties, eventually changing its name to the Feature #2. The Dixie was managed at various times by Fred Peters, Anthony Kornmann, and V. H. Hulsey, and at one time employed Fred Cannata as a combination doorman and usher for three dollars a week. In his spare time, he played the clarinet in the orchestra pit. Cannata would go on to become Will Horwitz’s right-hand man in later years. The Dixie was one of four theatres that would be controlled by Moye Wicks, the others being the Star, at 507 Main; the Vaudette (“The little house\n\nwith the big program”), next to Sweeney’s at 417 Main; and the Gem, at 505 Main, across from the Rice Hotel. Wicks would eventually give up the theatres for the confectionery business, which he operated while handling the movie houses.18 John De Brueys, in Paul Hochuli’s 1948 Showcase column, said that the Star was right next to the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company store, adding: “We kids always called the Star the ‘Rats,’ which was Star spelled backwards.”19 The Gem opened on March 6, 1912. Listed also at that address in the 1912 Houston Directory was the Bil-Sol The-\n\n17\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00817 17\n\n8/29/07 2:06:54 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\natre, under the proprietorship of Solan and Billings. Associated with Wicks was Anthony Xydias, who managed both the Gem and the Star, and later still, the Rex. Xydias would eventually quit as an exhibitor during the twenties and become a director of cheaply made western thrillers in Hollywood.20 Many of these features, with titles such as Buffalo Bill on the U.P. Trail and General Custer at Little Big Horn (both 1926), would find a second audience in the thirties with the 16mm home-movie market. Also dating from this time was the Theato, at 912 Prairie, in the Scholibo Building, which was originally constructed in the 1880s. During its brief history, it was managed by W. F. Hennessey. A fire destroyed the theatre in the spring of 1910. The building survived and no one was hurt in the blaze, but the fire created concerns on the city council, resulting in a safety ordinance that required all theatres without rear exits to have the seats face the entry door. This caused many existing theatres to shift the seats around, so patrons entering the house faced the audience. The council’s attention was well founded, since the highly flammable nitrate motion-picture stock made theatre fires a harsh reality.21 The Scholibo Building would become better known as the Shoe Market Building, from the retail store it housed for many years. The building was modernized in the forties, but by the early 1990s it had fallen into abandonment and disrepair. Its last occupant was an adult-movie theatre. It gained a new lease on life in the later nineties, after a complete restoration won it a 1999 Good Brick Award from the\n\nGreater Houston Preservation Alliance. By then the building housed the Shoe Market Gallery on the ground floor, which specialized in gifts, home furnishings, and ethnic arts and crafts. The upper floor served as community meeting rooms and office space for Treebeard’s Restaurant.22\n\nAdvertisement in the Houston Chronicle for the grand opening of the Cozy, October 16, 1910.\n\nthe newer, bigger cozy 1112 Texas Avenue By 1910, the original Cozy proved to be too small, so M. F. Foster agreed to build a larger showplace. It would become one of the early standards for theatres in Houston, ranking with the Majestic, Isis, Queen, and Travis as a solid entertainment venue. It began as a musical-comedy house, later advancing to burlesque, and finally becoming a movie house.23 The theatre was built at a cost of about $30,000; Gus Street was the general contractor. It shared the same building as the old Light Guard Armory. The two-story structure seated around eight hundred people. The auditorium featured a balcony, four boxes flanking each side of the broad stage, and dressing rooms in the\n\n18\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00818 18\n\n8/29/07 2:06:54 PM\n\nthe nickelodeons\n\nrear. One of these contained a fireplace, the room most likely reserved for the star entertainer. It was acclaimed also as having the best ventilation in Houston; the air conditioning consisted of forty large openings that allowed a moderate breeze to pass. In later ads, it billed itself as the “almost open-air theatre” and the “house of exits.”24 The theatre was operated by Maurice Wolf, who had run the older Cozy at 1018 Texas. The new Cozy opened on October 17, 1910, with six “big acts” and an orchestra led by Charles Lewis, of the Herb and Lewis musical team. Performers included Lola Milton and company, the Melrose Comedy Four, Will Beam, the Sharrocks, Torcat and his great trained roosters, and a Cozygraph feature. Regular admission was ten cents, while the reserved seats on the main floor and the balcony-circle seats were twenty cents. Reservations could be made in advance by calling Preston 178. Friday evening was amateur night. Meanwhile, the original Cozy continued operations for an additional week. Wolf eventually moved to Boston, becoming the New England district manager for the Loew’s theatre chain. In 1913, the Cozy was rented to the Barraco brothers, Paul and Victor, for eight hundred dollars a month. The Barracos also operated the Best Theatre and the Crescent. Paul died in 1932; Victor found a career as an attorney and in the Marine Corps. He would also be instrumental in the construction of the Bellaire Theatre in 1949. “I was in the show biz then,” Victor said in a 1973 Texas Monthly interview.25 “Owned five theatres and the Key vaudeville house on West Dallas where Bessie\n\nSmith used to play.” Barraco also owned the property at Grant and Welch that eventually became Anderson Fair. He died in December 1990 at the age of ninety-seven. Houstonian Denney Strad, in a 1941 interview, recalled performing there with the Pete Pate Musical Comedy Company during its heyday: “The Cozy was one of the best small theatres in Texas in those days and presented some of the country’s best entertainers in one-night stands. We were here on vacation with Mrs. Strad’s folks when we started playing the Cozy. We did an operatic singing and violin vaudeville act. Pete was packing ’em in and hanging out the ‘Standing Room Only’ sign almost every night in those days.” The Strad and Legato act would pull down one hundred dollars a week— not bad money for the time. The Strads also played the Travis and Prince theatres, as well as on Broadway and abroad.26 The Barracos operated the Cozy for several years.27 Gabe Laskin then took it over for four or five years, including the World War I years. Soldiers from Camp Logan and Ellington Field would come into town to see the shows. By the late twenties, the Cozy had been taken over by Bill Lytle, a former San Antonio mailman who owned a chain of movie houses. During this time, the theatre presented movies exclusively. After Lytle, management of the Cozy became unstable, and the theatre would be open one week and closed the next. Charles Camp, who had previously operated the Prince Theatre, eventually became the manager. On March 28, 1926, the Cozy reopened\n\n19\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00819 19\n\n8/29/07 2:06:54 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nas the Royal Theatre. The evening program featured comedian Sam Mylie and his “peppy review,” along with the Culberson Orchestra. The last gasp of the Cozy took place around 1932 or 1933. It was open for about three weeks. The Commerce Company eventually bought the property. During its remaining years, the front entrance and lobby were converted into a fruit stand. In September 1941, the Olshan Demolishing Company began work on the Cozy. The common lot of many of Houston’s early theatres was eventual demolition. The Cozy was razed to make way for a parking lot.\n\nAccording to Stockard, the house was opened by George K. Jorgensen on January 1, 1907. Jorgensen had trained himself in carnivals, street fairs, and circuses, touring the country with his own projector and films. When film distributors made it easier to obtain new merchandise, he rented a vacant storefront in Houston, filled it with 200 folding chairs, hung up a sheet as a screen, installed his Little Edison projector, and set up a ticket office in front. His capital investment came to eighty-five dollars. The first day’s business brought in 800 patrons and forty dollars, followed the next day by 1,200 attendees. He handled all operations, from selling the tickets to hand-cranking the projection equipment. At the end of each reel he would turn on the house lights for a five-minute intermission while he rewound the film. Jorgensen sold his enterprise one month later at a profit, moved to Galveston, and\n\njorge n s e n a n d a i r d o m e s A 1940s Houston Post article by Mildred Stockard described a nickelodeon at 410 Main, where the Princess was located.28\n\nThe Isis Theatre on Prairie.

When it was sold in 1939, it was worth $250,000. Two airdomes opened in Houston in 1911. The Plaza, at 1101 Main, was under the management of Mrs. Cora E. Jones, and later that of Charles T. Brian, Jr., who had managed the Galveston Grand Opera House the previous year. The 2,000-seat showplace, which opened on June 18, was decorated with thousands of electric lights, ferns, and flowers. The entrance featured a shell walk bordered by benches, swings, and flowers. The Plaza’s motto: “Stars above you—Stars in front of you.”29 Another open-air venue was the San Jacinto Airdome, at the corner of Prairie and San Jacinto. It opened on May 12. Over a dozen houses debuted in 1912. Chief among them was the Isis.\n\natre man Hal Norfleet. Fichtenberg planned the showplace to feature a combination of motion pictures and live musical entertainment. Absent from his itinerary were vaudeville acts and stage plays.30 The theatre’s namesake—Isis, the Egyptian goddess of fertility and enchantment—and her symbol, a flaming torch, were incorporated into the exterior structure. Referred to as “the theatre beautiful,” the Isis featured modern fireproof architecture, a spectacular $5,000 pipe organ, and live orchestral accompaniment for the films. The organ, fifteen feet wide, twelve feet deep, and twenty feet high, was positioned behind the mirror curtain on the stage. The console was located in the orchestra pit and connected by a set of trackers. A ventilation system brought in a constant stream of fresh air from the outside. Known as the air-washing system, it was composed of a large fan that sucked air from the roof through a fine spray of water that “washed” the air before shooting it into the auditorium. During summer months, blocks of ice would be placed in the washing chamber, creating an early form of air conditioning. In addition, vents carried air into the projectionist’s booth, much to the comfort of the operator, who normally had to endure the heat produced by the film projector. Three ventilators on the roof eliminated the dead air that collected in the upper reaches of the auditorium. Seating capacity was 900, with 750 seats on the lower floor and 150 in the balcony. The opera-style chairs were upholstered in leather and finished with brass. The interior was decorated in green and gold, with paintings of the namesake\n\nt h e i s i s t he at r e 1012 Prairie The Isis Theatre was Houston’s first truly deluxe motion-picture theatre. Built in 1912, it brought audiences from the nickelodeons into a larger, plusher world. When it opened on April 16, the world was still reeling from the news of the Titanic, which had sunk only four days earlier. The theatre, on Prairie between Main and Fannin, was owned by Hermann Fichtenberg of New Orleans, who had operated similar houses in other cities. The structure itself was constructed by C. D. Hill and Company. Management of Fichtenberg’s chain was handled by W. H. Gueringer, with Moe H. Goodman as the local manager. Goodman would eventually be succeeded by veteran the-\n\n21\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00821 21\n\n8/29/07 2:06:56 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nEgyptian goddess on the walls. Illuminating the auditorium were fourteen hanging lamps as well as three large circular domes fitted with electric lights. In the opening-day newspaper ads, a footnote stated: “Balcony exclusively for colored.” The Isis balcony was accessible from a separate entrance. Segregation was commonplace, and would remain so for decades to come. The Isis grand opening kicked off at six o’clock. Admission was ten cents for adults and five cents for children. Once inside, the patrons were escorted to their seats by a trained team of ushers. A full\n\nprogram had been planned out for the evening, beginning with an overture performed by the Isis Orchestra and conducted by W. R. Patrick. Arthur J. H. Barbour was the featured organist. Next on the program was the drama A Dangerous Model, followed by singer John Baxter. Two split-reel comedies, Checkmate and The Ranchman’s Marathon (both 1912, directed by Allan Dwan), were presented before singer Guy Harris, billed as “that eccentric fellow.” The final entry in the program was another drama, The Torn Letter (1912, directed by Tom Ricketts).31 The Isis program changed every one or\n\nFront and rear views of the interior of the Isis.

A rare filmed appearance of the great stage actress Sarah Bernhardt in Jeanne Doré (1915, directed by René Hervil and Louis Mercanton) was shown for a four-day run beginning February 2, 1916. Another early film, The Trey o’ Hearts by Joseph Vance, described as “the great serial problem play,” was presented in installments, much like the later movie serials. On the bill could also be found a list of live entertainment, such as Frank Callon, the eccentric singing comedian; singer Bessie Walsh; and Neal Abel, the man with the mobile face. Additions and improvements were con-\n\nstant. Within two years, a new marquee and electrical display, studded with bulbs and suspended arc lights, were integrated into the theatre exterior. Part of this was due to one-upmanship with its chief rival, the Queen, which E. H. Hulsey opened in 1913. The Isis reached its peak in 1917, when it was taken over by the Saenger Amusement Company, with Al Lever as its manager. Saenger was a Louisiana-based theatrical chain, founded in 1912 by brothers Abe and Julian Saenger. The chain was purchased by Paramount in 1929. Al Lever went on to become branch\n\n23\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00823 23\n\n8/29/07 2:06:58 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nmanager for Interstate Theatres. Saenger would eventually let go of the Isis, and it fell under the control of Will Horwitz, who placed Fred Cannata in charge of its operations. Along with the Liberty Theatre, the Isis would run under the Horwitz Homefolks theatre banner for a short time, but its days as a showplace were coming to an end. The twenties brought in an era of truly opulent movie houses. Once considered the finest theatre in Houston, the Isis became plain by comparison with the regal upstarts. The last to manage the movie house was Ed F. Barnes, who later went on to become city editor for the Houston Post. By 1928, the Isis had closed down, having never made the conversion to sound. The last newspaper advertisement ran on Sunday, October 7, for the Janet Gaynor feature 7th Heaven (1927, directed by Frank Borzage). The building was remodeled for retail; the last tenant before a\n\nlong period of vacancy was McCrory’s 5&10 Variety Store.\n\nthe afterlife of the isis In 1998, the structure was given a chance for renewal. The downtown area had recently experienced a surge of redevelopment, including a new baseball stadium and the conversion of the Albert Thomas Convention Center into Bayou Place (including two theatres—the Angelica Film Center & Cafe and the Aerial Theatre). A number of older buildings were being converted into residential lofts, the most notable being the Rice Hotel. Across the street from the Rice side entrance was the Isis building. Plans for the three-story building featured office space on the upper floors and a ground-floor pub, established by Scott and Lauri Littlewood, owners of the Bank Draft brewery in the Rice Village shop-\n\nFacial busts in the interior of the former Isis, 2000.

Although the original Isis Theatre was no longer intact, numerous architectural flourishes still remained, and plans were set to uncover and restore the original structure. Ironically, the Titanic’s ghost still seemed to hover about the structure. There was a burst of renewed interest in the ill-fated ship after James Cameron’s blockbuster film was released the previous year, sweeping the Academy Awards and becoming the largest-grossing film to date. The former theatre space was effectively divided in half. First to open was the Mercury Room, an atmospheric bar designed in shades of browns and oranges. Icon Ventures LLP, headed by David Edwards, served as developer for the transformation. The terrazzo floors were refinished, and structural elements long hidden by the ceiling were exposed. Installed on the lower floor was the semiprivate VIP Room, with lighting sculptures by Isaac Maxwell and custom-made furniture and accents by the design teams Spaw Maxwell, Whitney and Whitney, and Griffin Architects. However, the premiere architectural element was the original art deco master stairway. The staircase and decorative railings were restored, and an inlaid wood cap was added to raise the height in order to comply with current building codes. The work on the stairs alone cost $40,000. The Mercury Room’s premier opening was held on October 12, 1999, as a benefit for the Theatre District Association’s ArtStart outreach program.32 Meanwhile, work continued slowly on converting the other side into the Mercantile Brewpub, which offered some surprises as the space was cleared. A long-\n\nvacant upstairs room, which once served as the theatre’s projection space, still had the wall opening left for the projector. But the real treasure was discovered after the drop-down ceiling was removed. On an upper sidewall was a highly detailed sculpture running the length of the room, with ornate flourishes and five faces spaced throughout. Although in need of restoration, this decorative element would become a highlight of the finished brewery, earning it the “Best Atmosphere” listing in the Houston Press’s 2000 “Best of Houston” issue. Spirits at the Mercantile were sometimes more than just libations. General manager Jeff Ehrich commented in the September 2000 issue of 002 that the building was supposedly haunted, and noted that three of the bartenders and a waitress had all reported seeing a man standing on the staircase landing at closing time, after the bar had been emptied. “He wears a derby hat, slacks, a white shirt and tie,” stated Ehrich. “They tell me you see him out of the corner of your eye.”33 Unfortunately, the opening of the Mercantile brought about the downfall of both it and the Bank Draft. “The Mercantile never really fulfilled its potential, despite the revitalization of downtown Houston,” reported one trade journal. It was eventually shut down.34 More successful was the neighboring Mercury Room, which was listed in the May 2000 Playboy as one of the best bars in America.35 houston’s list of theatres kept growing in 1912. The Crystal, at 407 Main, was operational in 1912, managed by William\n\n25\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00825 25\n\n8/29/07 2:06:59 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\ntle of Love.38 As advertised, it was “always cool at the Key.”39 The Royal, at 211 Main, next to the First National Bank, had been a vaudeville house owned by Maurice Newmann.40 In January 1912, its name was changed to the Pastime, and it was managed by John D. Dunmyre. Later still, its operations were handled by A. Schulman, who would continue working in show business when this theatre eventually closed.41 Others that opened included the Mecca, on Texas between Main and Travis, and the Grand, owned by Connally and McTighe, at 3618 Washington. It would be later known as the Midway, and featured live entertainment. Meanwhile, the Barraco Brothers opened the Crescent\n\nGeibig. On April 22 and 23 of that year, it presented what was advertised as the only existing footage of the Titanic, taken on deck and from the landing stage ten minutes before sailing time. In truth, part of this footage was actually taken from the Titanic’s sister ship, the Olympic.36 Also in May, the theatre installed a $5,000 Choralcelo electric piano.37 In June 1914, the operation of the theatre was taken over by Pearce Theatre management, which put in a new picture screen, overhauled the projectors, and installed new lenses. It was later purchased and rebuilt by A. E. Kiesing and placed under the management of Hal C. Norfleet, who made his career in the amusement business. It reopened on January 21, 1915, as the Key, showing Francis X. Bushman in The Bat-\n\nThe Pastime Theatre.

Other theatres that they would control were the Best, at 212 Main, and the Cozy. The 1912 Houston Directory also listed the “Is It Is,” at 2209 Congress. No further details are known. The early theatres remained in a constant state of evolution. Storefront shells made way for bigger and better venues.\n\nThe 1912 Isis was a solid indicator of the future of motion-picture houses. With 1913 would come more new theatres, including one that would challenge the Isis on its own turf. The duel of the cinemas was about to begin, setting a trend that continues to this day.\n\n27\n\n02 Welling 2rev page proofs 00827 27\n\n8/29/07 2:07:00 PM\n\ncinema*houston\n\nThe 800 block of Main Street facing north, c. 1926.

The Adventures of Kathlyn (1913, directed by Francis J. Grandon) introduced the format of a serial film, and after the success of the nine-reel foreign epic Quo Vadis? (1912, directed by Enrico Guazzoni), American audiences seemed more accepting of longer lengths. Director D. W. Griffith cemented this new standard with his four-reel Judith of Bethulia (1914), before embarking on his grand vision, the twelve-reel Birth of a Nation (1915). And in 1914, the Keystone Film Company introduced a new comedian to the world: Charlie Chaplin. Theatres across America reflected these movie-industry changes as nickelodeons evolved into larger, plusher movie houses.

As the decade progressed, architectural opulence found its way into the design palette of the movie houses.\n\nprogram in many theatres, took on more prominence as the decade passed. In addition, theatres paid more attention to customers’ comfort and satisfaction, striving to provide comfortable seating, quality music, soundproofed projection equipment, and attentive service staffing. The smaller storefront houses were slowly replaced by more impressive venues designed either exclusively for film or for film–live performance combinations. The natural—and logical—inspiration for\n\nthe queen 613 Main The most noted of the 1913 openings was that of E. L. Hulsey’s Queen. Hulsey had 30\n\n03 Welling 2rev page proofs 02830 30\n\n8/29/07 2:07:58 PM\n\nbigger and better\n\nalready established a string of theatres, including the Queens in Dallas and Galveston. The $200,000 Houston showplace, on Main between Texas and Capitol, opened one year after the Isis Theatre did, and while the Isis may have been Houston’s first deluxe theatre for film and live performances, the Queen was the city’s first theatre built exclusively to show motion pictures. Indeed, it set out to rival the Isis, and this competition would continue between the two for some time. The architectural firm of C. D. Hill handled the work under the supervision of E. F. Glick. Construction began after Hulsey took out a ninety-nine-year lease from the property owners, the Levy brothers; total investments on the Queen sat at half a million dollars. F. W. Peters would manage the theatre.1 The Queen, according to opening-day ads, was “fit for a king or queen and not too fine for the comfort of their majesties, the good, plain American people.”\n\nThe stone, terra-cotta, and brick exterior featured a front vestibule of marble and fresco work, mahogany panels and doors, and even a mahogany entry-stairs handrail. The interior consisted of a 25-by50-foot lobby leading to the 50-by-100-foot auditorium, with green leather operahouse seats. Although fireproofed to the standards of 1913, the building contained fourteen separate exits for both safety and convenience. The central feature was the $20,000 Pilcher and Sons pipe organ, located in the orchestra pit along with a baby grand piano. The taller pipes formed part of the decorative embellishments on the sides of the proscenium arch. The Isis countered this by adding its own ten-piece orchestra, the competition favorably raising the standards of music in Houston’s movie houses. As at the Isis, climate control was an important factor at the Queen. A $15,000 air-washing system was installed in the the-\n\nLobby and staircase of the Queen.

A large electric fan would draw the air into the “washing tanks,” then back into the theatre by way of 400 mushroom-shaped air registers located in the floor beneath the seats. The unit could also heat the building during the winter months. Opening day was to begin with an organ recital at three o’clock; however, this was postponed to a later date. The opening performance, the Vitagraph three-reel picture Wreck, began at six thirty. Admission was twenty cents for box seats, fifteen cents for the reserved-forsmoking mezzanine, ten cents for the\n\nlower floor, and five cents for the balcony. Hulsey’s Queen would remain the high mark in Houston’s theatre scene for a number of years, eventually becoming one of Houston’s Paramount theatres, along with the Liberty, Zoe, and Prince.2 Yet by the end of the silent era, other much grander palaces would surpass its opulence. One of the last Queen ads ran in May 1932 for D. W. Griffith’s The Struggle, a fitting choice for what had once been a premier showplace in Houston.3 O. B. Thomas, the last of a long line of Queen managers, found his way to the Empire Theatre in San Antonio.

The Garden, on Fannin between Capitol and Rusk, opened on May 7. Also opened around that time were the Texas, at 215 Main next to South Texas Commercial National Bank; the Jewel Theatre, at 505 Travis; and the Heights Airdome, at 402 West 19th Avenue in the Heights. The Top o’Houston, located on the roof of the Carter Building (later known as the Second National Bank Building), featured live entertainment, motion pictures, and a food menu that included cold drinks, ice cream, tea, juice, salads, deviled eggs, and cigars.5 Also listed in the 1913 Houston Directory was the Deroloc (“colored” spelled backwards) Theatre at 609 San Felipe, most likely a movie house for black patrons. In the 1919 Directory, it was listed as the American Theatre.\n\nThe Rex Theatre, at 511 Main, in the Binz Building, was later known as the Rivoli. The Binz Building, Houston’s first skyscraper, was built in 1894 by Jacob Binz, and towered a full six stories.6 Two other theatres were of note that year, the Pearce and the Travis. The Travis Theatre, at 614 Travis, held its opening on April 13, 1913, with a program largely composed of vaudeville and a moving picture. The first week’s entertainment consisted of the Mayfair Trio, the Copelands, a musical presentation entitled Musical Pikes, and a “Traviscope” movie.7 Under the management of William Geibig, it eventually became a known as a tab show—a tabloid, or a condensed, lowbudget version of a major live show, often consisting of skits, singing, dancing, and a movie.8 In 1919, the Travis was sold to a young man for $150, a sum he had to borrow.

The reopening-day newspaper advertisements promised a theatre that was as “clean as a pin,” as well as willing to honor old coupons. Some theatres at this time sold books of admission tickets. If the cinema was sold, it was left to the discretion of the new owners whether to honor the old tokens. The Liberty management decided to honor the old Pearce coupons as a buy one–use one deal. The ads also stated that the child’s admission was “half a dime. A slick for you. A jitney for your kid.” Also in the ad was a notice of nonhostility: “To our esteemed contemporaries: The Liberty opens in the friendliest of spirit. It has no fight to make on anyone. It believes in co-operation—in harmony. It bears malice toward none and good will\n\nonly had $13 in his pocket at the time.

The theatre was advertised as one of the most beautiful playhouses in the South, and featured a new radium gold screen and musical accompaniment by a live orchestra. A large battery of electric fans provided ventilation and cooling. The opening-day presentation, on June 10, featured The Accusing Hand (directed by Romaine Fielding) and The Forgotten Latchkey (directed by Ralph Ince).9 34\n\n03 Welling 2rev page proofs 02834 34\n\n8/29/07 2:08:02 PM\n\nbigger and better\n\nAuditorium of the Liberty.

It used the old phonograph system, which was unpredictable at best—synchronization was rarely precise, resulting in a character’s voice continuing after the mouth stopped moving, and the volume was never quite loud enough.12 Will Horwitz later operated the Liberty for several years, beginning in 1926, but by the end of the twenties the theatre had ceased operations.
