        "text": "Turns out watching this as an \"adult\" instead of a high schooler who wanted to see more movies like Harold and Maude was a much more rewarding experience. This is Robert Altman's Playtime, a sprawling, somewhat freeform series of gag-filled scenes that are loaded with social commentary/criticism. It's an incredibly angry movie that uses a spoonful of sugar to help the vitriol go down.\n\nIt's also about failure. The opening joke is the MGM lion opening its mouth, but there's silence instead of the typical roar, then you hear, \"I forgot the opening line.\" Then an old white lady (the Wicked Witch of the West, it turns out) sings \"The Star Spangled Banner\" out of key, blames the black marching…\n\n“Brewster McCloud” is one of the most hard career pivots from commercial to crazy in Hollywood history.\n\nDirector Robert Altman, in the same year of release as the cultural phenomenon “Mash,” followed up that monster success with a movie about a serial killer that leaves bird poop as a calling card.\n\n“Brewster McCloud” seems like it should be an aberration; a mistake that Altman or the studio would wish to hide as they pumped “Mash” for all the money it was worth. It would be a fitting fate for a movie with a running theme of failure. The first line of “McCloud” is, after all, “I forgot the opening line.”\n\nInstead, Altman’s film is a pigeon poop-besotted burst of creative…\n\n\"How I yearn to throw\n\nmyself into endless space, and float above the awful abyss.\"\n\n- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nStarting with the MGM lions roar, muted, with a dubbed, \"I forgot the opening line\", this movie has a lot of unique humor.\n\nI liked a lot of the running gags, like: Hines/Hanes, \"sir Frank\", or the pull-up masturbator. Also liked how the professor giving monologues slowly transforms into a bird as the movie progresses.\n\nI loved the bird excrement calling card of the strangler. Especially when Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West) dies in ruby slippers, covered in bird shit, while some notes of \"Over the Rainbow\" plays, haha.\n\nThis Fellini-inspired movie follows a Where's Waldo-looking Brewster…\n\nBrewster McCloud might be one of the best stoner comedies that doesn't have anything to do with being a stoner, so I guess it was a happy accident that I ended up watching this ode to the absurd on 4/20. You can practically smell the weed that was consumed through your television. On paper, a dark comedy about a young man whose dream in life is to literally fly like a bird who will stop at nothing to make it a reality should not work. It's script seems like it was literally drafted on dozens of King Size rolling papers that were promptly rolled and smoked once it was finalized. Robert Altman—who was a huge pothead—clearly undestood how to make…"
