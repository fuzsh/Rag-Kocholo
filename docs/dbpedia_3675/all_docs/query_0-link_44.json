        "text": "Ranked By\n\n522 votes\n\n114 voters\n\nVoting Rules\n\nVote up all your favorite Shelley Duvall movies and shows.\n\nA prolific and talented actress, Shelley Duvall has starred or guest-starred in several movies and shows, and we're ranking them from best to worst with the help of your votes. Wendy Torrance in The Shining and Olive Oyl in Robert Altman's Popeye are among her most recognized roles but she also took on comedic performances in Annie Hall and Suburban Commando. We also included one-off episodes from Frasier, L.A. Law, and The Twilight Zone as she did not have many recurring roles when it comes to television. With so many shows and movies featuring the legendary Duvall, it's going to be hard to determine which ones should be in the top ten, let alone the number one spot.\n\nVote up all your favorite Shelley Duvall films and shows, voting down the ones you've seen and thing others should skip, despite being her fans. Don't forget to look for the Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Paramount+, Apple TV+, and Amazon Prime buttons below each item to stream them whenever you want.\n\nMost divisive: Casper Meets Wendy\n\nOver 100 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The 30 Best Shelley Duvall Movies\n\nActors : Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers, Barry Nelson\n\nReleased : 1980\n\nDirected by : Stanley Kubrick\n\nRole: Wendy Torrance\n\nIn the chilling film The Shining, Jack Torrance (portrayed by Jack Nicholson) takes on a winter caretaker role at Colorado's secluded Overlook Hotel. His aim is to overcome his writer's block, and he brings along his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd). A unique aspect of this narrative is Danny's psychic abilities, which lead him to experience unnerving premonitions. The movie unfolds as Jack grapples with a stagnant writing process and Danny's visions grow increasingly alarming. The crux of the plot lies in Jack uncovering the hotel's sinister past, an event that triggers a terrifying transformation within him towards violence against his own family.\n\nActors : Robin Williams, Shelley Duvall, Paul L. Smith, Ray Walston, Paul Dooley\n\nReleased : 1980\n\nDirected by : Robert Altman\n\nRole: Olive Oyl\n\nIn the 1980 film Popeye, Robin Williams takes on the eponymous role, making his cinematic debut in a world where spinach is mightier than the sword. Shelley Duvall co-stars as Olive Oyl, Popeye's love interest and damsel in distress. The movie, directed by Robert Altman, transforms E.C Segar's classic comic strip into a live-action musical extravaganza. It presents Popeye's quest to find his long-lost father while also battling the brutish Bluto (Paul L. Smith) for Olive's affection. This comedy-adventure flick showcases an idiosyncratic take on a beloved pop culture icon.\n\nActors : Steve Martin, Daryl Hannah, Rick Rossovich, Shelley Duvall, Michael J. Pollard\n\nReleased : 1987\n\nDirected by : Fred Schepisi\n\nRole: Dixie\n\nIn the charming romantic comedy Roxanne, we meet C.D. Bales (Steve Martin), a witty and well-liked fire chief in a small town, who happens to have an unusually large nose. He falls for the beautiful Roxanne Kowalski (Daryl Hannah), a smart astronomer new to the town. However, Roxanne is smitten with Chris McConnell (Rick Rossovich), a handsome but dim-witted firefighter under Bales's command. In a twist of Cyrano de Bergerac-style love triangle, Bales helps McConnell woo Roxanne, while secretly harboring his own feelings for her. This film gracefully intertwines humor and heartache, showcasing Martin's comedic genius and Hannah's captivating performance.\n\nPremiered : October 2, 1959\n\nRole: Margaret (in the “A Saucer of Loneliness” episode)\n\nHost Rod Serling introduces stories of fantasy and suspense.\n\nActors : John Cleese, Sean Connery, Shelley Duvall, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm\n\nReleased : 1981\n\nDirected by : Terry Gilliam\n\nRole: Dame Pansy\n\nIn Time Bandits, a young boy named Kevin (Craig Warnock) gets swept away on a time-traveling adventure with six dwarfs. Led by Randall (David Rappaport), they've stolen a map charting all the holes in the fabric of time from the Supreme Being (Ralph Richardson). Their journey whisks them through historical epochs, encountering iconic figures like King Agamemnon (Sean Connery) and Napoleon Bonaparte (Ian Holm). This 1981 British fantasy film directed by Terry Gilliam is rich in quirky humor, vivid imagination, and unexpected surprises - an eccentric romp through space and time.\n\nPremiered : September 16, 1993\n\nRole: Caroline (voice)\n\nThe psychiatrist helms a radio call-in show in Seattle."
