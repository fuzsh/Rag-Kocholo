        "text": "Iconic actress and Texas native Shelley Duvall died Thursday, just four days after her 75th birthday.\n\nDuvall died in her sleep from complications related to diabetes at her home in Blanco, Dan Gilroy, her life partner since 1989, told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n“My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she’s free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley,” Gilroy told the entertainment news organization.\n\nWhat films did Shelley Duvall act in?\n\nDuvall's first role was in Robert Altman's \"Brewster McCloud,\" a 1970 movie shot in Houston. She went on to appear in several of Altman's films, including the period Western \"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\" (1971), the crime drama \"Thieves Like Us\" (1974), the ensemble musical comedy \"Nashville\" (1975), and the Western \"Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson\" (1976). She also played Olive Oyl alongside Robin Williams in Altman's live-action feature \"Popeye\" (1980).\n\nHer performance in Altman's psychological thriller \"3 Women\" (1977) won her the Best Actress Award at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival, a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award and a BAFTA Award nomination in the same category.\n\nDuvall is perhaps most famous for her role as Wendy Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's critically acclaimed 1980 horror movie \"The Shining.\"\n\nShe also produced children's TV series, including \"Faerie Tale Theatre\" (1982-1987) and \"Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories\" (1992).\n\nHow long did Shelley Duvall live in Texas?\n\nDuvall was born in Fort Worth in 1949 and moved to various cities within the state before settling in Houston at 5 years old. She graduated from Houston's Waltrip High School and attended South Texas Junior College.\n\nAccording to a 1977 article in Boca Raton News, Duvall had never left Texas prior to Altman's offer to cast her in \"Brewster McCloud.\"\n\nShe moved to Los Angeles to pursue her career in the 1970s, but after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, she relocated to the Hill Country town of Blanco.\n\nWhere is Blanco, Texas?"
