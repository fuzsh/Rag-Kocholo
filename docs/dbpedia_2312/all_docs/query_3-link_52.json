Fever and cough were the most common presenting complaints in the SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive inpatient cohort, whereas dyspnoea was more frequently reported in the SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive community cohort (Table ). Diabetes, chronic lung disease and cardiovascular disease were the most common underlying health conditions in all SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases. Obesity was also common, with five of eight SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases considered to be obese [body mass index (BMI) of ≥30], and, of these, two were severely obese (BMI of ≥40). Three of the deceased in the non‐hospitalised community cohort died at home; the fourth died in prison, where he reported no symptoms.\n\nTable 1\n\nCaseAge (years)SexRaceBMIMedical conditionsSymptoms at presentationVentilator daysTreatment137MaleBlack34.2Asthma, DM2Fever, cough, SOB, myalgia, HA6Steroids, hydroxyquinoline, empirical antibiotics246MaleBlack46.6Asthma, DM2Fever, cough, SOB, myalgia, HA8Hydroxyquinoline, empirical antibiotics379FemaleWhite18.5DM2, renal transplant, bipolar disorderFever, cough, myalgia, diarrhoea0* Tocilizumab, empirical antimicrobials463FemaleBlack28.2DM2, HTN, CADCough, fever16Sarilumab trial †\n\nTable 2\n\nCaseAge (years)SexRaceBMIMedical conditionsPremortem symptomsIndication(s) for postmortem SARS‐CoV‐2 testing549FemaleBlack33.7CVDMyalgia, cough, SOB, nausea/vomitingSymptomatic, sick contacts, healthcare worker644MaleBlack48.5NoneFever, SOBSymptomatic755MaleBlack34.9CVD, DM2, chronic renal failure on HDNoneSick contacts, prisoner867MaleBlack21.7Drug abuse disorderUnknownUnknown symptoms, contacts, and travel history\n\nTable 3\n\nSARS‐CoV‐2‐positive inpatient cohort (N = 4)SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive community cohort (N = 4)Age (years)Range (average)44–67 (55.5)37–79 (56.3)<6534≥6511Male/female ratio3:12:2Black/white ratio4:03:1BMI range (average)21.7–48.5 (34.7)18.5–46.6 (31.9)Presenting/premortem symptomsFever4 (100)1 (25)Cough4 (100)1 (25)Myalgia3 (75)1 (25)Dyspnoea2 (50)2 (50)Headache2 (50)0 (0)GI complaints1 (25)1 (25)None/unknown0 (0)2 (25)Medical conditionsDiabetes4 (100)1 (25)Chronic lung disease2 (50)0 (0)Cardiovascular disease1 (25)2 (25)Immunocompromised condition1 (25)0 (0)Chronic renal disease0 (0)1 (25)\n\nThe inpatient control cohort was composed of four females, two black and two white, ranging in age from 22 years to 80 years (average, 53 years). Ventilator days ranged from zero to 16. All patients died of clinical ARDS. Two patients had underlying sepsis, including one with polymicrobial bacteraemia following acute cholecystitis, and one with candidaemia. One patient had acute exacerbation of idiopathic bronchiectasis and pneumonia, and one suffered an acute intraparenchymal brain haemorrhage. The community death control cohort consisted of two white males, one black female, and one white female, aged 33–63 years (average, 49 years). All died of natural causes, with primary autopsy findings of DAD with or without acute bronchopneumonia.\n\nPathological Findings\n\nAn average of five sections per case (range 3–7) of lung were submitted at the time of autopsy for SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive inpatients. The average for inpatient control cases was 4.8 sections per case (range, 4–5). The averages for non‐hospitalised community cohorts were 3.8 sections per case (range, 3–5) for SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases, and 3.5 sections per case (range, 2–5) for SARS‐CoV‐2‐negative control cases.\n\nDefinite DAD was identified in all but one (case no. 7) of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases (Table ). There was overall agreement in confirming the presence of DAD in the control cases. The lung weights for patients with a consensus diagnoses of DAD ranged from 620 g to 1600 g for the right lung (normal average, 300–350 g) and from 640 g to 1350 g for the left lung (normal average, 250–300 g). The patient without DAD (case no. 7) had lung weights of 450 g each for the right and left lungs.\n\nTable 4\n\nCaseGross lung weights (g) † Histological diagnosis(es)Scoring of histological features*, mean (range)Underlying chronic changesHyaline membranesFibrin thrombiAirspace organisationAFOP‐like fibrinAcute bronchopneumoniaPerivascular inflammation/endothelialitisFibrinoid vessel wall necrosisHaemorrhage and/or capillaritisSARS‐CoV‐2‐positive inpatient cohort1R: 1520; L: 1330DAD2 (2)1.7 (1–3)0 (0)1 (1)1.3 (1–2)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)–2R: 1300; L: 1100DAD1 (1)2 (2)0.7 (0–1)1.7 (1‐2)1 (0–2)0.3 (0–1)0 (0)0 (0)–3R: 750; L: 700DAD ‡ 3 (3)1 (0–2)1.3 (1–2)0.7 (0–1)1 (0–2)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)Diffuse alveolar septal amyloidosis4R: 840; L: 640DAD1.7 (1–2)0.3 (0–1)1 (0–2)1 (1)0 (0)0.7 (0–1)0 (0)0 (0)–SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive community cohort5R: 800; L: 700DAD3 (3)1 (1)0 (0)0.7 (0–1)0 (0)0.3 (0–1)0 (0)0 (0)–6R: 750; L: 775DAD2 (2)0.7 (0–1)0 (0)1 (1)0.3 (0–1)1 (1)0 (0)0 (0)–7R: 450; L: 450Focal fibrinous pneumonia ‡ 0.3 (0–1)1 (1)0 (0)1 (1)0 (0)0.3 (0–1)0 (0)0 (0)Metastatic calcifications8R: 1400; L: 1100DAD3 (3)0 (0)0 (0)0.3 (0–1)1 (1)0.3 (0–1)0 (0)0 (0)–Control inpatient cohort9R: 980; L: 840DAD2 (2)1.3 (1–2)0 (0)0.3 (0–1)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)–10R: 750; L: 750DAD2.3 (2–3)0.3 (0–1)1.3 (1–3)1.7 (1–2)0 (0)0.3 (0–1)0 (0)0 (0)–11R: 970; L: 750DAD2 (2)1 (1)0 (0)2 (2)1.7 (1–3)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)Bronchiectasis12R: 860; L: 510DAD1.7 (1–2)0 (0)0 (0)2.7 (2–3)1 (0–2)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)Metastatic spindle cell neoplasmControl community cohort13R: 620; L: 420DAD2.3 (2–3)0.3 (0–1)1 (0–3)0.7 (0–1)1 (1)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)–14R: 1150; L: 1280Acute necrotising BP and DAD1.7 (1–2)1.3 (1–2)0 (0)1.3 (1–2)3 (3)0 (0)0.7 (0–2)0 (0)–15R: 1150; L: 920Acute BP and DAD ‡ 1.3 (0–2)3 (3)0 (0)1.3 (1–2)3 (3)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)IV drug abuser’s lung16R: 1600; L: 1350DAD2 (2)0 (0)2.3 (2–3)2 (2)0.3 (0–1)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)–\n\nAmong all cases reviewed (n = 16), there was unanimity regarding the presence of hyaline membranes in 14 cases, and unanimity regarding the extent of the hyaline membranes in nine cases. Among the cases without concordance, the majority of disagreements (n = 5) were due to differences in interpretation of the extent; in two cases (no. 7 and no. 15), there was lack of agreement on the presence of hyaline membranes. Case no. 7 was diagnosed as ‘early DAD’ by one reviewer, who identified focal hyaline membranes, whereas the other two reviewers did not see hyaline membranes. Case no. 15 was complicated by diffuse acute bronchopneumonia. Two reviewers also reported patchy hyaline membranes and diagnosed DAD, whereas one reviewer diagnosed only acute bronchopneumonia.\n\nFibrin thrombi, involving small precapillary vessels and/or muscular arteries, were identified by at least one reviewer in 13 cases. Fibrin thrombi were not identified in one SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive case and two control cases. There was no difference in the overall extent of fibrin thrombi identified between SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases and control cases, with an average extent of 0.9 (on a scale of 0–3) in both aggregated SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases and control cases.\n\nHistological evidence of organising DAD was reported by at least one reviewer as focal (score 1) or patchy (score 2) airspace organisation in three of four SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive inpatients. Airspace organisation was scored as present by all three reviewers in only one case (no. 3). In contrast, airspace organisation was not identified by any reviewers in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive community cases.\n\nInterobserver variability was greatest for AFOP‐like intra‐alveolar fibrin, which was scored as present by at least one reviewer in all cases. This feature was identified by all three reviewers in 11 cases that were equally distributed across all four cohorts, with unanimity regarding extent in six of them. Of the cases for which there was not a consensus on extent, reviewers scored four cases as either 1 (focal) or 2 (patchy), and one was scored as 2 (patchy) or 3 (diffuse). For five cases, spread across all four cohorts, there was lack of agreement on the presence of AFOP‐like intra‐alveolar fibrin, but, when scored as present, it was only a focal finding (score of 1). Overall, the extent of fibrin deposition was not appreciably different between aggregated SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases (average 0.9) and control cases (average 1).\n\nThere was more acute bronchopneumonia in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive inpatients (average of 1.5) than in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive community cases (average of 0.8). Perivascular inflammation was a more common finding in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases (average of 0.4) than in control cases (average of <0.1), but, in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases, it was a focal finding when identified, and only one case was scored as having perivascular inflammation by all three reviewers. Fibrinoid vessel wall necrosis, haemorrhage and/or capillaritis were not features of SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases. Viral cytopathic changes were not seen in any SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first comparison of autopsy lung findings in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive medically managed inpatients and untreated, non‐hospitalised deceased persons with those in uninfected historical control cases of DAD. The main limitation of our study is the small number of cases in each of the cohorts. Nonetheless, we think our SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases are probably representative of the broader COVID‐19 patient population, as both hospitalised and non‐hospitalised deceased persons had underlying conditions previously identified as risk factors for severe disease, including diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, 13 and obesity. 14\n\nDAD is ubiquitous at autopsy in hospitalised and non‐hospitalised COVID‐19 patients. DAD was the primary abnormality in all hospitalised COVID‐19 patients, as previously reported by others. 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 DAD was also present in nearly all SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive deceased persons who died without medical intervention. This suggests that COVID‐19‐related lung disease is a common cause of death not only in hospitalised patients, but also in those who die in the community. The single exception was a case that lacked histomorphological features clearly diagnostic of DAD. The lung weights were also relatively normal as compared with all other cases in which DAD was present. All reviewers noted a focal AFOP‐like airspace exudate, similarly to previous descriptions of incidental pulmonary findings in patients later diagnosed with COVID‐19. 17 This person was reportedly asymptomatic prior to being found dead. We conclude that he was either an asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 carrier or suffered from early preclinical or subclinical COVID‐19, for the following reasons: (i) the absence of significant pulmonary changes; and (ii) autopsy evidence of hypertensive heart disease, which probably accounted for his death.\n\nSARS‐CoV‐2‐positive inpatient and non‐hospitalised community cases show no meaningful differences in lung histology at autopsy. DAD is the primary abnormality in both, with there being little to distinguish these two populations. Airspace organisation, which is a finding more typical of the organising phase of DAD, was seen only in hospitalised COVID‐19 patients, indicating that they survived longer with their lung disease than their non‐hospitalised counterparts. Neither SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected cohort showed fibrinoid vessel wall necrosis, vasculitis/capillaritis or haemorrhage resembling that previously reported by others. 7 , 8 , 9 We have not observed any of these vascular changes in other hospital‐based COVID‐19 patient autopsies that were not included in this study. Given the morphological similarity between treated COVID‐19 DAD and COVID‐19 DAD in non‐hospitalised patients, we conclude that the DAD seen in the inpatient cohort is directly attributable to viral infection rather than medical therapies, including those that may cause hyperoxaemic lung injury.\n\nDAD in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients is histologically indistinguishable from DAD due to other causes. Although additional clinical correlation is needed to understand whether the ARDS experienced by COVID‐19 patients represents a novel subphenotype, our results suggest that the histological features of COVID‐19‐related DAD are not specific, and indicate that the pathogenesis includes elements common to other causes of DAD. Fibrin thrombi with an average score of at least rare/focal (≥1) were seen in five of eight SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases and in four of eight control cases. Furthermore, we have not observed a greater incidence of thrombi in other COVID‐19 inpatient autopsies. These observations underscore the original descriptions of DAD, in which fibrin thrombi were common. 18 Indeed, the term DAD was coined to emphasise the central role of diffuse injury to the epithelium and endothelium constituting the distal pulmonary acinus. AFOP‐like fibrin also occurred with similar frequency in all SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected and uninfected cases. At least focal (mean of ≥1) AFOP‐like changes were identified in five of eight SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases and in six of eight control cases. This finding was never more than ‘patchy’ in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases as independently assessed by three reviewers, including two who were blinded to cohort assignment. AFOP‐like fibrin was extensive in only a single non‐hospitalised case that preceded the COVID‐19 pandemic, supporting the non‐specific nature of this histological finding. Variably prominent alveolar fibrin deposition was also included in the original description of DAD, 18 further demonstrating that it is not specific to COVID‐19 or any other variant of DAD. Perivascular inflammation was noted by at least one reviewer in five of eight SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases as compared with one of eight COVID‐19‐negative control cases. When present, this finding was, at most, focal (mean of ≤1) and of uncertain significance with regard to the pathogenesis of COVID‐19‐related lung disease. As a diagnostic clue, it is neither specific nor sufficient to reliably separate COVID‐19 from other causes of DAD. Similar patterns of inflammation have been described and illustrated with a variety of terms in other viral pneumonias, including those caused by coronaviruses, human parechovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus 1, and influenza virus. 19 This finding has also been described in non‐viral cases of DAD, further emphasising its non‐specific nature. 18\n\nWe had relatively high rates of concordance for the presence or absence of most histological features, and discordance usually involved a difference of only a single grade (e.g. ‘absent’ versus ‘rare/focal’). The rates of discordance were randomly distributed across all four cohorts, and therefore did not significantly affect the final comparisons. Finally, as the numbers of lung sections examined were relatively consistent between cohorts, we think that sampling bias is unlikely to explain our results.\n\nIn summary, our blinded comparison of SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected deceased persons affirm previous observations of DAD as the primary histological manifestation of severe lung disease in hospitalised COVID‐19 patients, and further establishes that this is the primary finding in those who die untreated, in non‐hospital settings. We also demonstrate that the histomorphological findings in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients show substantial overlap with those in patients who have DAD from other causes, suggesting common elements in their pathogenesis."
