        "text": "Michera is a North Texas native who has worked at the intersection of education and access to opportunity for nearly 20 years. As Leadership ISDâ€™s executive director, she utilizes her expertise in strategic visioning, planning, and implementation to guide the organizationâ€™s direction and impact. She also works to secure and align key resources while maximizing LISDâ€™s capacity to empower communities to advance educational equity. Systemic change requires collective vision and effort, and Michera loves collaborating with incredible people across North Texas to build an educational ecosystem that prepares all students to achieve their boldest dreams.\n\nDrawn to Leadership ISD because of its unique expertise in both developing and supporting school board trustees and informing and activating communities, Michera is passionate about building up leaders and systems that are laser-focused on creating a strong and equitable public education system. LISDâ€™s work generates powerful and durable systemic shifts that improve student outcomes and student experience, and Michera is grateful to lead these efforts to affect positive change in the North Texas community that forged her.\n\nPrior to serving as Leadership ISDâ€™s executive director, Michera worked as a public school teacher, education law attorney, and nonprofit leader in multiple educational equity organizations. Michera received her BA from Duke University and her J.D. from New York University School of Law. Outside of work, she enjoys spending time with family and friends, traveling to new places, reading (fiction and nonfiction), and spending time outside, preferably where the forest, mountains, and water all come together.\n\nAs Leadership ISDâ€™s vice president of programs, Tamara develops and executes the organizationâ€™s strategy for identifying, equipping, connecting, and supporting leaders who will make decisions that lead to better outcomes for students. Tamara loves having the opportunity to work with people from diverse backgrounds all working toward a common goal as well as creating experiences that open people to new perspectives. Simply put, she sees her role as making sure that excellent things happen for ALL students on purpose.\n\nGrowing up, Tamara was taught that if she worked hard at her education, opportunities would be available for her in the future. However, when she moved to Dallas she learned that isnâ€™t the reality for many students. That knowledge led her to Leadership ISD where she was a Fellow (Dallas â€™16) before joining the organization full time. Tamara is committed to working toward an education system where every student feels seen, valued, and hopeful about their future.\n\nPrior to Leadership ISD, Tamara worked for health and education nonprofits as a development and community engagement professional. She has a bachelorâ€™s degree from Syracuse University and currently serves as an active volunteer for several nonprofit organizations working with students. Outside of work, Tamara enjoys all things outdoors and water-related, reading, and attending concerts and sporting events.\n\nAs Leadership ISDâ€™s regional director for Dallas County, Joey leads our work throughout the county, facilitating our Civic Voices Fellowship, supporting trustees, and building community coalitions dedicated to improving student outcomes. Joey is passionate about developing community leaders into public education advocates and ensuring trustees have the support they need to create excellent, equitable learning environments in their districts.\n\nJoeyâ€™s drive to improve student outcomes was built on his experience as a former teacher in Dallas. He could see that his schools were underserved and there was a clear equity gap, so he joined Leadership ISD as a Fellow in 2019 to learn more about how the education system worked. Through his Fellowship, Joey discovered that if we donâ€™t take matters into our own hands and advocate for these students, no one else will. He now takes this passion and purpose into his full-time work with Leadership ISD.\n\nIn addition to his work with Leadership ISD, Joey has also founded Firme DFW, a nonprofit organization that provides first-generation Latine students the necessary resources needed to thrive in college such as scholarships and mentorships. Joey has a Bachelor's degree from New Mexico State University and a Masterâ€™s in Education from Johns Hopkins University. Outside of work, you can find Joey working out and watching sports with friends or tapping into his creative side as a music writer, avid movie-goer, and improv performer.\n\nAs Leadership ISDâ€™s regional director for Tarrant County, Ken oversees the regional efforts to develop community, business, and education leaders into well-informed and equity-focused public education advocates. Ken is driven to help parents, teachers, and other advocates find their voice to speak up for all students and support educational equity.\n\nAfter his daughter was born in 2013, Ken became an active advocate for something he had been passionate about his whole life: improved outcomes for ALL students. When his daughter enrolled in pre-kindergarten in a Fort Worth ISD school, he attended the first PTA meeting and got involved. Ken has since held a variety of leadership positions in the PTA at his daughterâ€™s school and on the Fort Worth ISD Council of PTAs - work that led him to participate in Leadership ISDâ€™s Civic Voices Fellowship in 2021-2022. He has testified on education issues in the Texas Senate, was a presenter at Fort Worth ISDâ€™s 2022 Racial Equity Summit, sits on the Fort Worth ISD Community Oversight Committee, and serves on the Texas PTA Board of Directors. Ken was also a 2022 recipient of the Texas State Board of Educationâ€™s Heroes for Children Award.\n\nAfter attending Baylor University, Ken began his radio broadcasting career behind the microphone and proceeded to manage various Texas radio stations before working as a freelance voice actor more recently. Outside of advocating for all kids, Ken loves spending time with his own daughter, kayaking, and mountain biking.\n\nTwyla serves as Leadership ISDâ€™s director of program and alumni engagement, activating our network of fellows, alumni, and partners to increase community involvement and mobilize coalitions that advocate for improved student outcomes. Additionally, she co-facilitates our Tarrant County Civic Voices Fellowship and designs advocacy initiatives focused on racial equity, community voice, and accountable school board governance. Twylaâ€™s goal through her work is to empower students to grow, thrive, and flourish as they reach their God-given potential.\n\nWith a strong desire to give back to her community, Twyla has previously been involved with a variety of nonprofit organizations such as Fort Worth Sister Cities, the Arlington Alliance 4 Youth, and the YMCA of Metropolitan Fort Worth. She is the Founder and CEO of The Jonathan Andrew Youth Enrichment Foundation, an organization focused on social and leadership development programs for youth and their families, and is currently the Chairwoman for the discipline subcommittee of the Fort Worth ISD Racial Equity Committee. Twyla is also a proud Leadership ISD 2020 Tarrant County Fellow.\n\nIn addition to her passion for positively impacting the lives of students, Twyla is an avid follower of most sports. She also enjoys gardening, listening to music, and writing."
