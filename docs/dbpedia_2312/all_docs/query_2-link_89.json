        "text": "RESULTS\n\nPrior to PROACTIVE termination due to inadequate accrual of randomized subjects, 237 patients (169 SS, 42 SC, 15 Sβ0-thalassemia, 11 Sβ+-thalassemia), 118 males and 119 females, were enrolled in the PROACTIVE trial from July 2009 through June 2010 by 26 centers, 2 to 27 patients (mean 9.5) per center. Alloimmunization was cited as a reason for exclusion of 27 of 378 (7.1%) subjects identified as potentially eligible for enrollment. Mean age of enrolled patients was 19.3 years (range 2.0–68.0); there were 122 children and 115 adults (age ≥ 18 years). More than three quarters of the participants had received at least a single transfusion of red blood cells prior to the study; more than two thirds of children under age 10 had been transfused ( ). Forty-five percent of adults over age 35 had received 10 or more transfusions.\n\nTable I\n\nAge group2–9 years (N=44)10–17 years (N=78)18–35 years (N=92)36+ years (N=22)Total (N=236)Number of prior red cell transfusionsNumber of patients with alloantibody (N=3)Total Number of patients (%)Number of patients with alloantibody (N=11)Total Number of patients (%)Number of patients with alloantibody (N=15)Total Number of patients (%)Number of patients with alloantibody (N=5)Total Number of patients (%)Number of patients with alloantibody (N=34)Total Number of patients (%)None014 (31.8)017 (21.8)122 (23.9)04 (18.2)157 (24.2)1–5220 (45.5)736 (46.2)327 (29.3)15 (22.7)1388 (37.3)5–1005 (11.4)113 (16.7)422 (23.9)13 (13.6)643 (18.2)>1015 (11.4)312 (15.4)721 (22.8)310 (45.5)1448 (20.3)\n\nBlood bank data were reported on 236 subjects. Thirty-four patients (14.4%), 14 (11.5%) children and 20 (17.4%) adults (p=0.19), had a history of at least one alloantibody and 17 of these had more than one. There was no difference in alloimmunization between adult men (15.7%) and women (18.8%) (p=0.28). Alloimmunization prevalence by age and transfusion load is depicted in . Among children, 9 of 56 (16.1%) with 1–5 transfusions had alloantibodies compared to 4/17 (23.5%) with >10 transfusions (p=0.48). Four of 32 (12.5%) adults with 1–5 transfusions were alloimmunized compared to 10/31 (32.3%) those with >10 transfusions (p=0.07). The alloimmunization rate of heavily transfused subjects was no different between adults and children (p=0.74). Antibodies were reported against D (2), C (9), E (9), e (5), V (2), Kell (K) (4), Jsa (1), Kpa (3), Kpb (2), Fya (3), Fyb (2), Jka (1), Jkb (2), Lea (2), M (4), S (3) and other (11, including 5 autoantibodies). Looking only at those 179 patients who had received at least one transfusion, 33 (18.4%), 14 (15.4%) children and 19 (21.6%) adults (p=0.28), had a history of at least one alloantibody and 16 of these had more than one; unfortunately, one subject with no reported transfusions had a blood bank history of alloantibodies to anti-D, anti-C, anti-E, anti-e, anti-Fyb and anti-Jka (likely indicating incomplete data reporting for this individual). Only 18 participants (12 adults, 6 children) had antibodies detectable on screening of blood specimens obtained at enrollment; 10.5% of adults and 5.0% of children had detectable antibodies (p=0.11).\n\nWhen surveyed prior to commencement of PROACTIVE, 9 of 11 responding centers said that they performed red cell phenotyping for their patients with SCD; one center did not, and one performed red cell phenotyping only for adult patients. After the termination of the study twenty-three sites (88%) responded to the follow-up survey regarding pre-transfusion antigen typing. Nineteen centers (83% of responders) reported antigen matching beyond ABO/Rh and known antibodies for all transfusions (one for genotype Hb SS only); three did this only if one (two sites) or more (one site, for chronic transfusion patients only) antibodies were known to be present, and one center “on a case-by-case basis”. There was no difference in antibody prevalence between the four centers that did not routinely provide antigen matched blood (13.7%) and those that did (14.8%) (p=0.85); within the latter group, there was no difference between those that limited matching to C, E and K antigens (14.8%) and those that did more extensive matching (14.7%) (p=0.99). Eleven sites matched for Duffy antigens (Fya and Fyb).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIndividuals with SCD frequently require transfusion of red blood cells to treat acute complications, and chronic transfusion is recommended for primary 12 and secondary 13 stroke prevention; it appears use of transfusion has increased over the last several decades. In a report from the CSSCD, a large natural history study of sickle cell anemia in the 1980’s, only approximately 50% of enrolled subjects had a history of transfusion at entry, 11 as compared to 75.8% having a history of transfusion in PROACTIVE. It may be that transfusion is more frequently utilized today than during the CSSCD due to improved safety of the blood supply, 14 documentation by the Stroke Prevention (STOP) trials of the need for indefinitely prolonged chronic transfusion for primary stroke prevention15,16 and the perception that transfusion improves outcomes of patients with acute chest syndrome. 17–19 Acute chest syndrome is a leading cause of sickle cell-related hospitalization and, whereas during the CSSCD (1979–87) 26% of subjects with ACS were therapeutically transfused, 20 during the National ACS Study (1993–7), a similar a large multi-institutional observational study, 72% of ACS patients received blood. 21\n\nCSSCD data were chosen for comparison since both the CSSCD and PROACTIVE were multi-institutional trials that involved centers with large sickle cell populations and expertise in their care. However, whereas all patients under care at participating institutions were eligible for entry into the CSSCD, PROACTIVE enrollees consisted only of individuals hospitalized for pain. SCD patients with pain are more likely to have higher hemoglobin levels 22,23 and thus perhaps a lower risk for transfusion. Higher hemoglobin levels are also seen in patients susceptible to ACS, 22,24 a major indication for red cell transfusion, perhaps biasing PROACTIVE in the other direction, since ACS is a common indication for transfusion and thus risk for alloimmunization. The higher frequency of a history of transfusion overall in the PROACTIVE group as compared to the CSSCD would potentially increase the risk of alloantibodies.\n\nThe rate of alloimmunization of patients with SCD is higher than that of the general population, reaching 47% in one series, 25 perhaps largely related to antigen disparity due to differences in ethnic heritage between donors and recipients; 3 in addition, blood cell antigens Rh (particularly D) and are the most alloimmunogenic. 3,4,26–28 Not only does allosensitization put patients at risk for acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, sometimes severe, 1 but also can make a search for compatible blood difficult and costly for blood banks and providers. Antigen-matching may reduce alloimmunization. 6–9,29 As demonstrated by our survey, the vast majority of our PROACTIVE sites insist on compatibility of these antigens even for non-sensitized patients, yet antibodies to C, E and remain the most commonly identified in our population.\n\nHas this policy helped? Despite nearly universal attempts by PROACTIVE-participating sites to reduce the alloimmunization rate in their patients by extending antigen compatibility to at least the most problematic antigens (C, E and ) and often further, the alloimmunization rate remains high (14.4%; 18.4% among those by history receiving at least one transfusion) among enrolled subjects; additionally, 7.1% of potentially eligible subjects could not be enrolled to PROACTIVE due to concern that existing alloantibodies might preclude prompt transfusion, if so randomized. Site practice regarding antigen matching did not impact on alloantibody prevalence in their PROACTIVE subjects, and there was no substantive reduction even among children, who should have most benefitted from recent recommendations for antigen matching. Unfortunately, we have no specific data from PROACTIVE sites as to when antigen matching was adopted. It is somewhat surprising that transfusion load did not appear to affect alloimmunization rates in either age group, though there was a trend toward a higher prevalence of alloantibodies in adults with more transfusion exposures as opposed to fewer.\n\nThe CSSCD documented by blood bank history and serologic screening prior to transfusion (90% concordant) that the overall alloimmunization rate upon enrollment to the study, 12.5%, was similar to that of PROACTIVE patients; 11 the SS genotype and increasing age were associated with a higher risk of alloimmunization. It is possible that antibody histories available during the CSSCD may have been less comprehensive than available today or that the current computerized records are more accurate and yield more complete results; the true alloimmunization rate may have been higher. In addition, current methods of antibody detection are more sensitive than those used at the time of the report in 1990, raising the possibility that these data reflect better detection, not a similar alloimmunization rate.\n\nIn a survey of those selected to participate in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute-supported Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers, 71% of responding centers indicated antigen-matching was done for all individuals with SCD, though a majority of respondents felt there was no clear consensus regarding appropriate practice in this regard. 30 It is likely that centers that encounter smaller numbers of patients with SCD may not match for specific antigens, resulting in higher alloimmunization rates, though Management Guidelines produced by consensus and published by the National Institutes of Health’s Heart Lung and Blood Institute (last updated in 2002) state that for patients with SCD requiring transfusion “limited matching for E, C, and Kell antigens is usually performed, unless patients have antibodies”. 31 However, a survey suggests that in 2003 only a minority of blood banks phenotyped red blood cells for certain non-ABO antigens for transfusions given to individuals with SCD prior to immunization. Those blood banks that screened provided blood compatible at C, E and K antigens most commonly, with some blood banks matching for additional antigens based on the patient’s red cell phenotype. 32 Though the patients in PROACTIVE were being seen at SCDCRN centers, some may have also been seen at other hospitals in their community that do not adhere to the same policies as those in specialty centers, and thus be exposed to antigens that put them at high risk of alloimmunization. That only 18 subjects had detectable antibodies on screening enrollment to PROACTIVE while 34 had an antibody history emphasizes the need for complete transfusion histories; alloantibody strength can diminish over time, ultimately causing the antibody to become undetectable.\n\nEleven (45.8%) of the survey responders that did antigen matching attempted to exclude exposure to Duffy antigens. Of those sensitized at entry to or during the CSSCD, 18.3% of antibodies were to Fya and 4.7% to Fyb; 14.7% of the antibodies reported in PROACTIVE were to a Duffy antigen. In addition to being a portal of entry for the malarial parasite and thus uncommon in Africans and those of African ancestry, 33 Duffy antigen has also been proposed as a cytokine sump, provision of which through transfusion might theoretically attenuate the course of ACS; 34,35 it is also of interest that a “masking mutation” (GATA) suppresses expression of Duffy antigen on erythroid cells while permitting expression on other somatic cells, reducing the likelihood of alloimmunization of affected Fy(a-b-) patients if transfused Fy(b+) cells. 36,37 The SCDCRN had hoped to assess the potential therapeutic impact of transfusion of Duffy positive cells as a secondary endpoint but failed to accrue adequate numbers of transfused patients. One hundred forty of 155 (90%) patients with red cell phenotype available were Fya negative, 132 of 153 (86%) were Fyb negative and 123 (80 %) were negative for both Duffy antigens, apparently even somewhat higher than that previously reported for African Americans (68%). 33 We have thus confirmed the high prevalence of Duffy negativity in people with SCD, but also a moderate prevalence of allosensitization. A prospective trial is needed to further explore the risks/benefits of transfusing Duffy negative patients with Duffy positive blood.\n\nIn conclusion, PROACTIVE data demonstrate that transfusion is commonly used to treat SCD today. Based on our PROACTIVE survey, it appears antigen matching for C, E, and often additional antigens for red cell transfusion is standard practice at most sickle cell centers today. The nearly universal use of red cell phenotyping and antigen matching at SCDCRN centers appears to have had modest, if any, impact on alloimmunization prevalence. Since we speculate that patients are in large part developing alloantibodies because they are seen at hospitals that do not proactively antigen match, it is important that this practice be considered standard of care for all patients with SCD who require transfusion."
