She has obtained many other verdicts and settlements that exceed $1 million for her clients, including a $26 million jury verdict in a wrongful death case, and an $8 million arbitration award for an entrepreneur wronged by their former partner. Ms. Barnett also served as lead trial counsel in two class action trials in the Multidistrict Litigation lawsuit arising from the mishandling of remains at Tri-State Crematory. These cases settled well into both trials, for combined judgments of over $120 million.
