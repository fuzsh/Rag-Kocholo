        "text": "Biography Overview\n\nVictoria was born and raised in Georgia, where she earned her undergraduate degree from Georgia College & State University, before moving to Birmingham, Alabama in 2004 to attend Cumberland School of Law. During her time in law school, Victoria served as the Student Materials Editor for the American Journal of Trial Advocacy, served as a Judge Abraham Caruthers Fellow in the Legal Research & Writing program, was an Associate Justice for Cumberland’s Henry Upson Simms Moot Court Board, and was a competitor on the school’s National ABA Appellate Advocacy team. Victoria received recognition over the course of her law school career as a Scholar of Merit for her top academic achievements in several courses, including Scientific Evidence, Conflicts of Laws, Domestic Relations, and Jurisprudence: Foundations of Law.\n\nWhile in law school, Victoria began clerking with a Birmingham-area personal injury law firm and joined that firm as an attorney immediately upon graduation. She worked with that firm from 2007 until she joined Morgan & Morgan in 2021. During her career, Victoria has represented plaintiffs in a wide variety of claims and cases, including commercial trucking litigation, products liability, insurance fraud and bad faith, boating accidents, business litigation, premises liability, and automobile accidents. Victoria has been involved in numerous successful pre-suit and pre-trial settlements, participated in several jury trials, and has achieved appellate success in the Alabama Supreme Court on behalf of her clients.\n\nVictoria has a particular interest in serving the needs of clients suffering catastrophic injuries, such as traumatic brain injuries and quadriplegia. She enjoys taking an active and involved role in every aspect of the cases she handles, from investigating claims to conducting discovery to formulating and implementing legal strategies and arguments to be made in the case. Victoria believes that all injuries are personal and takes pride in the work she does on behalf of her clients.\n\nVictoria has been named to the Super Lawyers “Mid-South Rising Star” list since 2017 and was included in the National Trial Lawyers “Top 40 Under 40” list of Alabama attorneys for several years. Victoria is proud to hold a prestigious AV® Preeminent Peer Review Rating™ from Martindale-Hubbell®, signifying her achievement of the highest ratings for professional ethics and legal ability by her peers."
