Farah gave us an update on the store's move to McBride Street (the old Spero's store) and some of the exciting new additions to the store, including a smoothie bar and a bring your own bottle refill station for cleaning & health products. I highly recommend going and checking her store out, in addition to vitamins and health products there's many interesting food and environmentally conscious products, including the Tru Earth laundry strips - made in Canada with no plastic involved and the miso paste in the fridge.\n\nSeptember 15 Meeting Lori Wilson 2022-09-18 07:00:00Z 0\n\nAugust 18 Meeting\n\nAt our August 18th Meeting we had Brendan Eshom as our guest speaker. Brendan, while still a teenager, developed an App with a \"word of the day\" in Sm'algyax, the language of the Ts'msyen people. Brendan spoke about the development of his App and of the culture of his mothers people who are from Hartley Bay. Brendan is a very accomplished young man with an impressive resume and he's an excellent public speaker - he joined Toastmasters while still in his teens. Among his accomplishments, he is a recipient of the BC Reconciliation Award, which is for \"individuals, groups and organizations who have demonstrated exceptional leadership, integrity, respect and commitment to furthering reconciliation or inspired others to continue reconciliation efforts\". Brendan's app can be found on most app stores - just search \"sm'algyax word\".\n\nAugust 18 Meeting Lori Wilson 2022-08-18 07:00:00Z 0\n\nAugust 4 Meeting\n\nYou never know what you might learn when you come to a Rotary Lunch Meeting. On August 4th we had Anne Dopson and Echo as our speakers. Anne has a business \"Calm Dog\" in Prince George, and she spoke a bit about therapy dogs and the value of them for people/children in stressful situations. She also gave some tips on dog training and walking my dogs has not been the same as I try to incorporate some of her tips. Echo was also a lovely speaker who charmed the room and was extremely calm and patient in unfamiliar surroundings with many people around, a walking advertisement for \"Calm Dog\".\n\nAugust 4 Meeting Lori Wilson 2022-08-17 07:00:00Z 0\n\nAuction\n\nAuction Is Already Here!!!!!! http://auction.prrc.ca/\n\nAuction Ellen Witherly 2021-11-10 08:00:00Z 0\n\nAugust 5, 2021 - Scott Farwell\n\nApril 5, 2021 - Scott Farwell - Crest Hotel\n\nScott gave us an update on the hotel/restaurant industry in Prince Rupert and elsewhere in the province.\n\nAugust 5, 2021 - Scott Farwell Ellen Witherly 2021-08-10 07:00:00Z 0\n\nCelebrating 100 Years!\n\nPlease join us as we remember 100 years of Rotary in Prince Rupert.

This is an underground high grade gold mine that the company purchased in 2010. The years 2011-12 were spent in exploration activity and employees lived on site in tents.\n\n2013-14 years were spent in permitting and 2016-17 in construction both above and underground.

Dave's childhood was spent on the family farm/ranch. He belonged to the Air Cadets for 6 years and obtained his pilot's licence at the age of 16. After graduation he joined the navy at the urging of a friend. The navy took him across Canada and he served on most ships in the fleet and also spent time in the Arabian Gulf. He was trained to hunt submarines under the water, ships on the water and airplanes above the water. Dave was approached to take a posting to Colorado which was surprising to a navy man as there is no water there! He became a space officer who tracks man-made orbiting material. You would be amazed at how much material there is. Why do they do it? Because it is a risk to the space shuttle and station. An orbiting paint chip can cause serious damage to the windscreen of the station. This experience saw him to travel with UN to Cambodia and with NATO to Brussels, all because he is now considered an aerospace expert. Dave was posted to Maritime HQ in Victoria where he attended Royal Rodes and achieved his MBA, studying business and leadership. He is now the Director Port Operations and Harbour Master for the Port of Prince Rupert. Dave and his family moved to Prince Rupert 6-1/2 years ago. This is the first time in his adult life that he has lived more than 5 years in one place.\n\nMarch 22, 2018 New Member - David Charlton Ellen Witherly 2018-03-22 07:00:00Z 0\n\nFebruary 1, 2018 - New Member Sabrina Silvey\n\nFebruary 1, 2018 - New Member Sabrina Silvey\n\nOur new member Sabrina Silvey gave her \"Who's Who\" Talk at our last Rotary meeting.

Sabrina is the Salvation Army Pastor and Greg is the outreach worker with the church. Thoughts are underway about how they can provide a safe, accepting space for teens to hang out. We also learned a lot about the history of the Salvation Army from its roots in England, whose brand strategy is \"Giving Hope Today\".\n\nFebruary 1, 2018 - New Member Sabrina Silvey Ellen Witherly 2018-02-08 08:00:00Z 0\n\nJanuary 11, 2018 - Visitor Heather Bell\n\nJanuary 11, 2018 - Visitor Heather Bell - My Life in Costa Rica\n\nHeather Bell, daughter of long time Rotarian, Alf Bell, visited our club recently and spoke of her time in Costa Rica.

The District Governor spoke of the connections and lasting friendships experienced in Rotary. John certainly proved this true on his trip as he met with Bruce and Betty Forward in Nanaimo, where he learned all about the Nanaimo Club major booksale fundraiser, met someone on the plane from Nanaimo to Vancouver who buys her books at the sale, and then had breakfast at YVR where he met some Sechelt Rotarians who told him all about their Scotch Tasting and Auction fundraiser.\n\nNovember 2, 2017 - John McNish Travels Ellen Witherly 2017-11-28 08:00:00Z 0\n\nRotary Auction\n\nRotary Auction 750 Winners!\n\n1st Prize: Lynn Meers\n\n2nd Prize: Melissa Case\n\n3rd Prize: The Stromdahls\n\nRotary Auction Ellen Witherly 2017-11-28 08:00:00Z 0\n\nRotary Auction\n\nThe 53rd Annual Rotary Auction has come and gone!\n\nContact the Lester Centre to pick up items not delivered or picked up during the auction.\n\nA big thank you to all the businesses who donated to the auction and to all those who bid on the more than 800 items over the three nights!

She noted many differences between her home in Karlsruhe and Prince Rupert.\n\nFirst of all Karlsruhe is a busy city of about 300,000 inhabitants, so Teresa is finding it pretty quiet in Prince Rupert. She attends a dedicatede music high school where she studies cello and has specific classes for music and is required to play in an orchestra.\n\nTeresa showed us a photo of a tram - something that they also have in Karlsruhe. When she showed the photo at a school presentation, some students had never seen a tram.\n\nAlso Teresa can visit 9 different countries by driving less than 8 hours.

Dave actually began his McDonalds career at the age of 15, before trying out other sales jobs and receiving his Entrepreneur Business degree. He submitted his interest to become an owner operator and was approved for western Canada. He had to be willing to relocate to any location in that area. Then he had extensive interviews and a trial work experience. It took 6 months for him to get into the program and then it is 1 year of unpaid training. McDonalds works hard to protect their brand. He learned all aspects of the business starting from the front counter. You can be cut from the program at any time and of the 4 that started his cohort, only 2 were successful. Prince Rupert is lucky that he was one of them. Recently moved to the community, Dave and his wife are interested in giving back to community and Dave is already playing with the Rampage.

He visited the Parliament in Victoria and the Aquarium and ran into snow at Manning Park! His stay in Canada is nearing its end, and while there was good sharing with other exchange students at Outbound, he found it hard to say goodbye.

Ray was born and grew up in Fort Langley and then his family moved to Winnipeg where he played football that taught him to practice hard and play hard - a lesson for life. His introduction to Japan came when he was an exchange student at age 18. His early adult years were spent between Canada and Japan when he earned a degree in geology (Canada), worked as a civil servant (Japan), went into business for himself worked building homes (Canada) Executive Search work (Japan). Ray met his wife in Japan in 2000 where he started his own Executive Search firm and in 2013 the family made a move back to Canada. Ray's business can be located anywhere and he had fond memories from his youth visiting Prince Rupert when his father worked on the Queen North.

Local tourism has benefited from the combination of high end sport fishing lodges, sport fishing day charters and the many individual sports fishermen who visit Prince Rupert. While a concern, the down-turn in Alberta doesn't seem to have affected this market. Local businessman, Steve Smith promoted the \"Totem Circle Tour\". While bus coach tourism is declining, individual car travel visits are increasing. Prince Rupert Tourism are currently working on a Rockies to Alaska tour through Rupert with VIA Rail. The vacation arm of BC Ferries vacation tours has been very positive and they are sold out for 2017. Our first cruise ships docks on May 19th - the first of 17 ships booked this summer with 17,000 passengers expected in 2017. Cruise visitors rate the Prince Rupert Adventure Tours, the Prince Rupert Museum and North Pacific Cannery very highly. The new Cow Bay Marina has been well received and bookings are up this year over last. In addition to the Cruise Ambassador program, Mobile Visitor information teams are in place for 2017. The challenge remains that we are highly dependent on the ferry and airline schedules.\n\nMay 18, 2017 - Scott Farwell Ellen Witherly 2017-05-19 07:00:00Z 0\n\nMay 17, 2017 - Chris Marett City West\n\nChris Marett, CEO CityWest\n\nOn May 11th, Chris Marett, CEO of City West, spoke to the Club about City West, our locally owned and operated telephone internet and cable company.

Captain Shiels and his wife Nancy came here from the Smithers area about 15 years ago. He says they didn't really want to make the move 15 years ago, but a chance encounter shortly after they arrived convinced them that this was exactly the place they needed to be. Now that they are looking forward to retirement this summer they don't really know how they will leave! The need in Rupert was great when they arrived here and it still is. The soup kitchen is far too busy and they served 803 families with Christmas Hampers this last year.\n\nFebruary 2, 2017 - Captain Gary Shiels E.

A talented artist she then attended the Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art that brings all nations together in pursuit of education and developing fine art skills with a focus on traditional First Nations Pacific Northwest Coast art. Through a chance meeting she was invited to Gisborne, New Zealand in 2014 where she was introduced to traditional tattooing. When she returned to the northcoast, she met with elders who shared their stories of tattooing in their culture. Nakkita shared a picture of a Haida tattoo kit with us. The traditional methods used were scarification, pricking and stitching. She is currently working in ancient methods with modern tools, and northwest coast designs.\n\nJanuary 26, 2017 - Nakitta Trimble 2017-02-15 08:00:00Z 0\n\nJanuary 19, 2017 Speaker, Community Development Institute\n\nJanuary 19, 2017 Speaker - Krystin St. Jean\n\nKrystin St. Jean, Senior Facilitator from Community Development Institute spoke about Redesign Rupert.

She will start her duties officially on July 1, 2016 and her term will last for 3 years until June 30, 2019. She will be responsible for 6 Rotary Clubs; the Interact and Rotaract clubs in the area, as well as the new concept of the Rotary Community Corps (this is for those who do not wish to become Rotarians; but would like to volunteer for community projects on behalf of Rotary.)\n\nNancy shares the observation that even though it involves a number of clubs, it is still a lot more manageable than her previous term as Assistant Governor for the Northwest, where the her clubs involved a one way 4 hour drive to Smithers and a one way 2 1/2 hour drive to Kitimat.\n\n(That might be the case Nancy; but you have to admit that the trips to the northern clubs involved highway routes without any real traffic jams, to speak of, regardless of the time of day!!! :)\n\nGood luck Nancy in your new role....we know that you will give it your all...like you always do!!!\n\nNancy Eidsvik in Transition within Rotary 2016-04-19 00:00:00Z 0\n\n2016 Polar Bear Swim\n\nThe 2016 Prince Rupert Polar Bear Swim was a huge success with approximately 150 people taking the plunge. The Prince Rupert Rotary Club hosted the event and served hot dogs, coffee and hot chocolate to the participants and the spectators on a beautiful, clear day. The Rotary club would like to thank Tim Horton's for donating the coffee and the hot chocolate. Bandstra was a huge contributor to the success of this event by transporting all the bbq's, tables and supplies down to the Rushbrooke site. The Coast Guard was present to ensure safety and they stood by in the inflatible 'Cape Dauphin'. We would also like to thank the non Rotarians, who volunteered to help out with such things as traffic control, serving food and beverage and announcing the play by play of the actual event.

After recently retiring from the RCMP, I now work for the Prince Rupert Port Authority as the Manager of Port Security.\n\nI joined Rotary in 2010 and currently hold the position of President–Elect and Northwest regional representative for the District Youth Exchange Committee.\n\nI had my first contact with Rotary when my daughter was selected to go on youth exchange in 1994. While I wasn’t a member of Rotary at the time I was exposed to the work the organization was doing not only in the community but elsewhere around the world. My job at the time made it difficult to join Rotary but that changed once I returned to Prince Rupert where I planned to retire. I joined Rotary largely because of the programs they have for youth and the opportunities they present for local youth to expand their horizons. As cliché as it sounds, youth are our future leaders and providing them the opportunity to improve their leadership skills, exchange ideas with others across the country and build their tolerance of cultures different from our own are worthwhile goals. Rotary does this through programs such as the Rotary Youth Leadership Award (RYLA) held in Vancouver, Terrace and Prince George, adventure programs focusing on career interests held in Ottawa, Kelowna, Prince George and Prince Rupert and the International Youth Exchange Program which enables youth from around the world to experience life in another culture. These experiences can be life altering for the youth involved and exemplify Rotary’s motto of service above self.\n\n\"GETTING TO KNOW\" our club members - Bob Killbery Douglas Kydd 2014-04-14 00:00:00Z 0\n\nPHF - Dorothy Stewart\n\nThe Rotary Club of Prince Rupert is very happy to present its final 2014 Community Recognition Paul Harris Fellow Award to\n\nDOROTHY STEWART\n\n(l to r) Crystal Lorette, club President; Dorothy Stewart and Nancy Eidsvik, club member\n\nRecognized for her many community involvements, people know Dorothy through the Seniors’ Teas, her pleasant greetings as Cruise Ship Ambassador and as Past President of the Legion’s Ladies Auxiliary.
