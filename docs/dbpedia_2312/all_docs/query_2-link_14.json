        "text": "The Beginnings\n\n1868 The first Catholic church in Minneapolis west of the Mississippi River was built at Third Street and Third Avenue North. Called the \"Shed Church\" because of its simple design, it was an extension built behind the school for Catholic children living on the river's west bank. The new parish was named Immaculate Conception. Rev. James McGolrick (Rector 1868-1889) soon founded a St. Vincent de Paul Society, a Rosary Society, and became a leader in the Total Abstinence temperance movement in Minneapolis.\n\n1873 On New Year's Day, the second Church of the Immaculate Conception was dedicated. Built of limestone in the Gothic Revival style on the same lot, it was much more substantial than the Shed Church it replaced.\n\n1892 As the original parish site was encroached upon by manufacturing and industrial development, Rector Rev. James J. Keane (1892-1902) advocated for a third, larger church to be built on a new location.\n\n1902 The youthful Rev. Thomas Cullen (1902-1921) is named rector, only a year after his ordination.\n\n1900s— The vision and plan are carried forth.\n\nBy the turn of the century the Immaculate Conception parish was outgrowing its second church building. Archbishop Ireland's vision included two new monuments to the vitality of the Catholic communities in both cities: a new Cathedral in St. Paul and a Pro-Cathedral in Minneapolis.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1903, Archbishop Ireland proposed plans for a Pro-Cathedral to members of the Immaculate Conception parish. He received the parishioners' support and fund raising began for a new building under the leadership of Rev. Thomas E. Cullen (Rector 1902–1921). Parishes from all over the city and beyond its western borders held bazaars and fairs to raise money for the effort.\n\nIn 1905, Immaculate Conception parishioner Lawrence S. Donaldson, scion of the Donaldson's department stores, donated land worth more than $40,000 for the new Pro-Cathedral. Overlooking Loring Park, it was strategically located on the main city thoroughfare, Hennepin Avenue.\n\nJune 2, 1907 The cornerstone was laid for the Cathedral of St. Paul at Selby and Dayton Avenues.\n\nAugust 7, 1907 Archbishop Ireland attended a ground-breaking ceremony for the new building along with the building committee and invited guests.\n\nMay 31, 1908 The cornerstone was laid for the Pro-Cathedral at Sixteenth Street and Hennepin Avenue. 20,000 citizens, including 500 students from the College of St. Thomas and more than 300 priests and seminarians, took part in the procession.\n\nThe decision makers:\n\nJohn Ireland (the third Bishop and the first Archbishop of St. Paul) was born in Ireland and came to the United States when he was eleven years old. He attended the Cathedral School in St. Paul where he attracted the attention of Bishop John Cretin, who sent Ireland and his brother to France for seminary training; they became the first Minnesota seminarians. Upon returning to Minnesota, he founded St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary. He served as a chaplain in the American Civil War. Ireland was a prominent national figure, an ardent advocate for the temperance movement, and a strong proponent of Americanism.\n\nEmmanuel Masqueray, our architect, was born in France in 1861 and attended the \"Ecole des Beaux Arts\" of Paris. He was the chief architect and designer of the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Archbishop Ireland met Masqueray at the Fair and was impressed with his work.\n\nArchbishop Ireland invited Masqueray to Minnesota to collaborate on his grand plan to simultaneously build both the grand new cathedral in St. Paul and the Pro-Cathedral in Minneapolis.\n\nThe building's exterior is completed.\n\nIn September, 1913 the new Pro-Cathedral School opened for students. The new parochial school was located at the rear of the Pro-Cathedral campus on Laurel Avenue and Sixteenth Street.\n\nNovember 1913, the church building opened to the public for a month-long Civic Dedication series that included concerts and nationally renowned speakers. In addition to giving non-Catholics a look inside the majestic building before it was consecrated, the series tickets provided an oppportunity for all citizens of Minneapolis to help fund the construction.\n\nMay 31, 1914, the first Mass was celebrated in the new Pro-Cathedral. The new church was still quite bare inside, with plain glass windows, concrete walls, and a temporary wooden altar.\n\nAugust 15, 1915, the Pro-Cathedral was dedicated at the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nApril 1917 The United States declared war on Germany. Further work on the Pro-Cathedral came to a halt as parishioners turned their energies toward the war effort, including a Red Cross center in the Pro-Cathedral School. 494 parishioners — men and women — served in the armed forces during WWI.\n\nMay 26, 1917, Architect Emmanuel Masqueray died. Subsequent work completing the Pro-Cathedral interior was done by his former assistants, Frederick Slifer & Frank Abrahamson of St. Paul.\n\nIn 1918 Archbishop John Ireland died and was succeeded by Archbishop Austin Dowling.\n\nAmerica's first basilica\n\nAugust, 1921 Rev. Thomas Cullen is named President of the College of St. Thomas, and Rev. James M. Reardon (1921-1963) is appointed pastor.\n\nReardon’s tenure lasted for more than forty years. A writer and historian, he closely oversaw the design and details for the Pro-Cathedral's unfinished interior. Just after his appointment as pastor, Monsignor Reardon wrote: \"The stately grandeur of its imposing exterior postulates an interior loveliness unsurpassed by anything in the land.\"\n\nDuring the first decade of his pastorate, the interior was completed using the finest materials and workmanship available. This included the marble altar and baldachin, the elaborate wrought iron grille surrounding the sanctuary, the sculptures of the Twelve Apostles, a new pulpit, stained glass windows, an organ, and ceiling decoration.\n\n1926 The Pro-Cathedral was raised to the rank of a minor basilica by Pope Pius XI. It was the first basilica to be designated in the nation and its name became the Basilica of Saint Mary of Minneapolis.\n\nApril 1928 A new residence for the clergy and the sacristy were constructed and blessed.\n\nMarch 26, 1929 The only requiem Mass in the United States for Marshal Foch, Generalissimo of the Allied forces in World War I, was held at the Basilica. More than four thousand persons attended.\n\nWar Work and the Eucharistic Congress.\n\nJune 14, 1940 to October, 1946, the women of the Basilica parish knitted and sewed garments, made surgical dressings, helped with hospital work, and served as staff assistants. The Red Cross honored many for their excellent work and attendance. 653 men and women of the parish served with the armed forces. Three of the assistant priests were called up to chaplain duties.\n\nAfter the war, two ciboria covers were made of white silk from a parachute that fell in Belgium. They were embroidered by Sisters of the Visitation Convent in St. Paul and given to Monsignor Reardon on February 27, 1947.\n\nMay 1, 1940 The daily exposition of the Blessed Sacrament was inaugurated at the Basilica, the first parish in the diocese to be given that permission.\n\nJune 1941 the Ninth National Eucharistic Congress was held in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Thousands of people came from all over the country to attend this important event in the history of the Basilica. The number of priests needing to say daily Mass was so great that many temporary chapels were set up in the undercroft and two new side altars were dedicated in the nave. During the Eucharistic Congress, Father Reardon was raised to the rank of Monsignor.\n\nJune 27, 1941 Solemn Consecration of the Basilica. The Souvenir of Consecration booklet includes an unattributed quote that describes the Basilica as \"a marble poem; an aesthetic dream of sculptured beauty fit to be the theme of Angel fancies; a Madonna prayer uttered in stone.\"\n\nThe Basilica gets National Register designation.\n\nApril 1973 Bishop Cowley resigned his position due to illness. Monsignor Terrance Berntson followed him as rector (1973-1978).\n\n1974 Monsignor Berntson founded the Care Guild. It developed a variety of programs that were all indispensable to the growth and well-being of the Basilica parish: scripture study; food shelf; nursery service; assistance to the home-bound. Many of these vital programs continue on today within the St. Vincent de Paul ministries.\n\n1975 The Basilica was named to the National Register of Historic Places. The register nomination form summarizes the significance of the Basilica:\n\n\"Firstly, it exemplifies great design in architecture and engineering. Designed by Masqueray, it ranks with the Cathedral of Saint Paul as an expression of Baroque influence in church architecture of the early twentieth century.\n\n“Secondly, the Basilica is a testimonial to the religious movements and their roles in the development of Minnesota's heritage.\n\n“And, thirdly, the building was the first such church to be proclaimed a basilica in the United States.\"\n\n1975 With enrollment falling due to neighborhood disruptions, and the withdrawal of the teaching CSJ sisters, the Basilica school closed.\n\n1978 Rev. Alfred Wagner (1978-1985)succeeded Monsignor Terrance Berntson.\n\nRestoration begins.\n\nAt the Basilica, the late 1980s began a time of growth and renewed interest in church activities.\n\n1985 Father Dennis Dease succeeded Father Wagner as rector (1985-1991). He wrote that the Basilica's \"absolutely grand old architecture made it a landmark in not only downtown Minneapolis, but throughout the region.\"\n\nBut while numbers grew and programs revitalized, water continued to leak through the dome and into the ceiling after each snow or rainfall. By the mid-1980s it was evident that repairs were desperately needed. Copper from the dome blew off during a storm and plaster chunks fell into the sanctuary.\n\nAccording to architectural historian Carol Frenning, \"Wall and wooden support beams were soggy and rotten with water damage. Only four of over one hundred supports that connected the Basilica's three cement floors were intact.\n\n“While the restoration work was being done, construction workers discovered that the rose windows were actually holding the supporting walls, not the other way around.\"\n\nDamage was assessed, fund raising started, and restoration on the building began.\n\nGrowth and Restoration\n\n2000 The John XXIII Gallery art gallery was established at The Basilica under the patronage of Blessed Pope John XXIII, part of an extensive renovation of the church undercroft which also added a beautiful meeting space (The Teresa of Calcutta Hall) and, for the first time in it's history, bathrooms within the church building.\n\nAs parish membership continued to grow, the Basilica expanded its outreach to the community and its liturgical offerings. Annual events such as the November Icon Festival, the Blessing of the Bikes and the ever-popular Blessing of the Animals (St. Francis Festival) continue to draw visitors from the wider community. The Cathedral Choir was joined by two children’s choirs, a teen choir (Juventus) and a world music choir (Mundus).\n\n2008 Rev. John Bauer succeeds Rev. O'Connell as pastor.\n\nOctober 2010: One of twenty-five historic sites vying for a Partners in Preservation grant, the Basilica won the popular vote via Facebook and was able to restore the narthex (entry) of the church and our sacristy to their full glory.\n\n2014 The Rectory, once a residence for priests and now primarily offices, gains a new elevator, improving access for staff, volunteers and visitors.\n\n2015 The unfinished 4th floor Rectory attic is redeveloped as Art and Archives storage, a substantial work room, and staff offices.\n\nLooking ahead into the future, the Basilica will continue to expand its role in the community, provide exemplary liturgical and artistic offerings, and steward her resources to maintain this beautiful church."
