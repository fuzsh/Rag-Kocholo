        "text": "As the upcoming presidential election approaches, Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have selected their running mates. But who are they and what do they stand for?\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nWho Is Tim Walz, Harris' Pick For VP?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has selected Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her presidential running mate, three sources tell CBS News. While Walz might not be a household name, his political star has been on the rise in recent weeks after making several viral cable news appearances.\n\nWalz was also credited with helping launch the \"weird\" movement among his fellow Democrats, which has gained traction and put former President Donald Trump, his vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance and other Republicans on the defensive.\n\nHe has also been applauded and condemned for several progressive laws passed while in Minnesota's highest office, especially in his second term when the DFL Party took total control of state government following the 2022 elections.\n\nHe also faced severe criticism in his first term for how he handled the dual crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and the violent uprising that followed the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020.\n\nIn an interview with CNN last month, host Jake Tapper pressed Walz about whether he could harm the Democratic ticket, as the Trump campaign works hard to portray Harris as an ultraliberal. Walz said he was \"more than happy\" to take any label they have.\n\n\"What a monster! Kids are eating and having full bellies so they can go learn, and women are making their own health care decisions. And we're a top-five business state and we also rank in the top three of happiness,\" Walz said.\n\nLarry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, believes Walz is an asset to Harris' campaign because of his \"attack dog\" skills.\n\n\"I think we'd see Tim Walz really going after the Trump-Vance ticket, and it'd probably be a harsher tone than what we've seen here in Minnesota in his everyday conduct. And he'd really be counted on to win the key states in the Upper Midwest,\" Jacobs said.\n\nHere are several of Walz's accomplishments — with an unusual number of legislative successes scored in March 2023 alone — and setbacks during his tenure as governor.\n\nThe pandemic\n\nWalz's use of emergency powers during the pandemic — including the institution of a mask mandate, business shutdowns and a hotline number established to report people violating social distancing guidelines — outraged his critics.\n\nSeveral lawsuits followed, including one filed in 2020 by the conservative Upper Midwest Law Center alleging Walz misinterpreted the Minnesota Emergency Management Act and illegally bypassed state lawmakers when issuing a peacetime emergency.\n\nThe case, which focused on the mask mandate, eventually made its way to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which sent it back to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In July 2023, that court ruled that Walz indeed had the authority.\n\nDuring his 2022 reelection campaign against GOP candidate Dr. Scott Jensen, who was banned from some social media platforms for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, Walz consistently defended the \"hard decisions\" he made during the pandemic. He went on to defeat Jensen by nearly 200,000 votes.\n\nThe murder of George Floyd and its aftermath\n\nConservatives lashed out at Walz for his delay in the historic activation of the Minnesota National Guard, which helped restore order on Twin Cities streets during the unrest in May 2020.\n\nThe delay drew the ire of then-President Trump, who went on to falsely claim he ultimately made the call. Months after the chaos, Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he asked Walz for troops three days before he gave the green light.\n\nWalz, who served in the Army National Guard for nearly a quarter of a century, clapped back at Frey.\n\n\"I don't think the mayor knew what he was asking for,\" Walz said. \"I think the mayor said, 'I request the National Guard, this is great. We're going to have massively-trained troops.' No, you're going to have 19-year-olds who are cooks!\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News, Minnesota Republican Party Chair David Hann accused Walz of delaying guard activation because \"he was fearful of alienating his progressive base, who were supporting the riots.\"\n\n\"[Walz has] been a disaster for Minnesota and is by far the most partisan governor that I can remember having,\" Hann said. \"He displayed a remarkable lack of leadership in dealing with the riot that was very destructive, and the aftermath of which is still affecting the quality of life and the business climate in Minneapolis.\"\n\nAbortion rights\n\nIn a 1995 ruling, the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld abortion rights in Minnesota. In January 2023, Walz signed the PRO Act (Protect Reproductive Options Act) into law, making abortion a \"fundamental right,\" as well as access to contraception, fertility treatments, sterilization and other reproductive health care.\n\nThe law made Minnesota the first state to codify abortion rights in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which nullified Roe v. Wade after nearly 50 years of precedent.\n\n\"Your access to reproductive health and your right to make your own health care decisions are preserved and protected,\" Walz said during the signing ceremony. \"And because of this law, that won't change with the political wins or makeup of the Supreme Court. This is a bill for Minnesota today and all future generations.\"\n\nRepublicans vigorously opposed the PRO Act, which was labeled as an \"extreme law\" by the party's top lawmakers, who failed to add amendments that would've banned third-trimester abortions and required clinics to be licensed.\n\nIn April 2023, Walz signed the Reproductive Freedom Defense Act into law, shielding women and providers from any legal action originating from the patient's state.\n\nGov. Walz greets Vice President Harris at MSP Airport on March 14, 2024.STEPHEN MATUREN/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nPro-LGBTQIA+ legislation\n\nWalz has a long history of supporting LGBTQIA+ rights. While teaching at Mankato West High School in the 90s, he helped found its first gay-straight alliance group.\n\n\"You have an older, White, straight, married, male football coach who's deeply concerned that these students are treated fairly and that there is no bullying,\" Walz said in a 2018 campaign ad.\n\nIn March 2023, Walz signed an executive order to protect the right of residents to have access to gender-affirming health care. Weeks later, he signed the \"Trans Refuge\" bill, banning the enforcement of arrest warrants, extradition requests and out-of-state subpoenas for those who traveled to Minnesota for care.\n\n\"When someone else is given basic rights, others don't lose theirs,\" Walz said. \"We aren't cutting a pie here. We're giving basic rights to every single Minnesotan.\"\n\nRepublicans sought to place an amendment in a separate bill to outlaw access in line with some neighboring states.\n\nOther critics, including Christian conservative groups, claimed the law places vulnerable youths in danger of irreparable harm.\n\nProponents say gender-affirming care treatments are evidence-based with plans developed on a person-by-person basis, taking into consideration the patient's developmental stage.\n\nThe practice of putting LGBTQIA+ youths into \"conversion therapy,\" which aims to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, was also formally banned in early 2023, although Walz issued an executive order two years earlier to restrict the practice.\n\nOpponents of conversion therapy, like Children's Minnesota pediatrician Dr. Angela Kade Goepferd, say the practice can cause psychological trauma, and increase the risk of self-harm and suicide.\n\nOpponents of the ban said it was ultimately an attack on religious freedom.\n\nGun laws\n\nLater that year, Walz signed a public safety package including a \"red flag\" law that allows family members, roommates or law enforcement to petition the courts to remove firearms from the possession of anyone deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n\nAnother law within the package required private gun transfers to be subject to background checks.\n\n\"This is not about the second amendment,\" Walz said. \"This is about the safety and security of our communities. That's what's happening here today.\"\n\nRepublicans and gun rights advocates accused Walz and DFL lawmakers of burying the gun control measures into the enormous package, and unfairly impacting the rights of lawful gun owners.\n\nPaid family, medical and sick leave\n\nIn May 2023, Walz signed a law creating a state-run program to provide paid family and medical leave for Minnesota workers, funded by a 0.7% payroll tax on employers, by 2026.\n\nWhile proponents say the law is an \"equalizer\" that provides a road map for a similar federal effort, critics claim it would cost much more than estimated and devastate small businesses.\n\nLegalization of recreational marijuana\n\nIn May 2023, Minnesota became the 23rd state in the nation to legalize recreational cannabis use. Three months later, people 21 and older could start to possess certain amounts of marijuana at home and on their person, in addition to legally growing up to eight plants at a time.\n\nMinnesotans with minor marijuana convictions are also eligible to have their criminal records expunged, and residents from communities of color — which were disproportionately targeted for arrests and convictions for possession for decades — are given preferential status in applying for cannabis-related business licenses.\n\nRepublican lawmakers accused the Democratic majority at the Capitol of forcing through legislation that was full of loopholes that ultimately endanger youths and increase public safety risks, especially the prospect of more impaired drivers on state roads.\n\nDriver's licenses for undocumented Minnesotans\n\nWalz also signed a bill into law in March 2023 that allows Minnesota residents of any immigration status the ability to obtain a driver's license.\n\nAdvocates for the bill, which had strong backing from law enforcement, business and religious groups, said it would lead to safer roads and a stronger economy.\n\nOpponents accused lawmakers and Walz of potentially opening a Pandora's box that could blur eligibility for voting and enrollment in other state programs.\n\nRepublican lawmakers also unsuccessfully sought to make special licenses for undocumented Minnesotans that would be easily distinguishable from the standard cards.\n\nRestoration of voting rights for former felons\n\nIn that same watershed month, Walz signed a bill that restored the right to vote to more than 50,000 convicted felons who had already served their time.\n\n\"We are in a country of second chances, we're a country of welcoming people back in. And the idea of not allowing those voices to have a say in the very governing of the communities they live in is simply unacceptable,\" Walz said.\n\nSeveral Republicans lambasted the legislation, saying those still serving probation for felonies should not have the right to vote. Sen. Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, went further, saying the law \"opens our elections to being influenced by convicted felons and illegal immigrants.\"\n\nUniversal school meals\n\nAmid the increase in food insecurity for many Minnesotans during the pandemic, and the subsequent strain on the state's food shelves that remains to this day, Walz signed a bill in March 2023 that ensures all K-12 students in the state have access to free breakfast and lunch on school days.\n\n\"As a former teacher, I know that providing free breakfast and lunch for our students is one of the best investments we can make to lower costs, support Minnesota's working families, and care for our young learners and the future of our state,\" Walz said.\n\nInitially pegged to cost $388 million in the state's two-year budget, the cost ballooned by more than $80 million, stoking sentiment among Republican lawmakers that the program is a waste of taxpayer funds, and largely provides meals for students of families that can easily afford to pay for them.\n\nWalz's clashes with Hennepin County's attorney\n\nIn April 2023, Walz became the first Minnesota governor in three decades to reroute a criminal case from a county attorney to the state attorney general's office.\n\nThe case involved the 2022 murder of 23-year-old Zaria McKeever. The father of her young child was sentenced to life in prison earlier this year for orchestrating her death. Two teenage brothers, one of whom fired the fatal shots inside her Brooklyn Park apartment, were also sent to prison.\n\nHennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty originally put together a plea deal for the brothers that would've seen them serve time in juvenile detention instead of being sent to adult facilities. The move angered McKeever's family and community members, and their outcry led Walz to intervene and place the case in the hands of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.\n\nEarlier this year, Moriarty faced fierce criticism for charging a White Minnesota state trooper in the death of a Black motorist in 2023. Her office eventually dropped the charges, and Walz told reporters soon after he had planned to intervene again if Moriarty hadn't made \"the right decision.\"\n\nMoriarty called Walz's move in the McKeever case \"deeply troubling\" and alarming to \"prosecutors across the state.\" That sentiment was shared by the National Lawyers Guild, which called Walz's conduct \"not just wrong, but in the context of other decisions, shows that you are making these sensitive decisions based on political expedience.\"\n\nFollowing the end of the state trooper case in June 2024, Moriarty accused Walz of unfair treatment due to her gender and sexuality, as she is the first openly LGBTQIA+ Hennepin County attorney, pointing to the lack of criticism her predecessor Mike Freeman enjoyed.\n\nWhen pressed by the media about Moriarty's claims, Walz simply said they were \"false.\"\n\nWho Is JD Vance, Trump's Pick For VP?\n\nSen. JD Vance, the junior senator from Ohio, has come a long way in a short amount of time since he published his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" months before Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016.\n\nOn Monday, Trump announced on his social media platform, Truth Social, that Vance is his running mate.\n\nVance, 39, won election to the U.S. Senate in 2022, and has only been a senator for a year and a half. Here's what to know about him.\n\nVance's book, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" catapulted him to fame\n\nVance's memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" became immensely popular in 2016, telling Vance's personal story against the backdrop of the struggles of Appalachia and Rust Belt America.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) ANDREW HARNIK / GETTY IMAGES\n\nA key message in Vance's book was that only by their own willpower can Americans in economically and socially struggling regions improve their own lives. But the book also gave Americans in coastal and more affluent areas a window into the lives of the people who made up the backbone of Trump's support in 2016. When Trump won, Vance's book became a bible of sorts for leaders and the media to better understand people who voted for Trump, and how a real estate mogul from New York could appeal to struggling Rust Belt Americans.\n\nIt rose back to the top of bestseller lists after Trump announced his choice for VP.\n\n\"J.D.'s book, 'Hillbilly Elegy,' became a Major Best Seller and Movie, as it championed the hardworking men and women of our Country,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social as he announced Vance as his running mate. \"J.D. has had a very successful business career in Technology and Finance, and now, during the Campaign, will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond.\"\n\nVance said he would not have certified 2020 election if he were vice president\n\nVance has said he would have refused to certify the election on Jan. 6, 2020, if he were in Pence's position. \"If I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others that we needed to have multiple slates of electors,\" he told ABC News in February, \"and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there. That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that's what we should have done.\"\n\nIn 2020, Trump pressured Pence, who presided over the joint session of Congress that affirmed the results of the presidential election, to refuse to certify the electoral votes that showed Joe Biden had won. Pence did not agree to do so, concluding that his role was ceremonial, and he ultimately announced that Mr. Biden had won — after an attack on the Capitol that day. Since then, Trump has continued to publicly claim that Pence \"did have the right to change the outcome.\"\n\nOn the issues\n\nAbortion\n\nAlthough Vance said in 2022 that he'd back a national ban on abortions after 15 weeks, he indicated that he also supports Trump on leaving the question to the states.\n\n\"I am pro-life. I want to save as many babies as possible,\" he told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" in May. \"And sure, I think it's totally reasonable to say that late-term abortions should not happen with reasonable exceptions. But I think Trump's approach here is trying to settle a very tough issue and actually empower the American people to decide it for themselves.\"\n\nUkraine\n\nVance opposes U.S. aid for Ukraine, arguing in a New York Times op-ed in April that the administration lacks a plan for Ukraine's success. He wrote that Ukraine lacks the manpower and the firepower to fend off Russia and also that the U.S. does not have the manufacturing capacity to make up the difference. He believes that Ukraine and its western allies must give up the goal of a return to Ukraine's boundaries in 1991, after the fall of the Soviet Union, to move forward. The U.S. and European allies support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not stop his expansionism at Ukraine.\n\nU.S. \"could learn\" from authoritarian Hungarian leader Victor Orbán\n\nVance said on \"Face the Nation\" in May that the U.S \"could learn from\" some decisions made by authoritarian Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, including controversial policies related to dealing with dissidents at universities.\n\n\"On the university principle, the idea that taxpayers should have some influence in how their money is spent at these universities, it's a totally reasonable thing, and I do think that he's made some smart decisions there that we could learn from in the United States,\" Vance said.\n\nVance noted at the time that he was not endorsing every thing Orbán has done. Orbán, who is revered in some hardline conservative circles, seized control of state universities, a move that critics say has extended his government's right-wing influence. Vance has praised the approach, saying his way could be the model for eliminating what he views as a left-wing bias at American universities. The May comments came as many universities in the U.S. were embroiled in protests from pro-Palestinian students.\n\nTrump met with Orbán last week, when the Hungarian prime minister was in the U.S. for the NATO summit. Orbán has endorsed Trump in this year's presidential election and said he hopes Trump can bring an end to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nTrain and rail safety\n\nVance has been a leading voice on train safety after the toxic train disaster that spawned health and environmental concerns for the residents of East Palestine, Ohio. He is part of a bipartisan group of six senators who introduced rail safety legislation in March 2023 that aims to prevent future derailments. The measure has not passed in the Senate even though it has six GOP co-sponsors and the support of six Democratic lawmakers.\n\nVance had a challenging childhood\n\nBorn James Donald Bowman in August 1984 in Middletown, Ohio, Vance was 6 years old when his biological father gave him up for adoption to his stepfather. His name changed from James Donald Bowman to James David Vance.\n\nVance's childhood was tumultuous. Not only did his father leave the family, but his mother struggled with an addiction to drugs and alcohol, which Vance documented in his book. Vance spent much of his time growing up with his grandparents in Kentucky. His grandmother, a \"blue dog\" Democrat who owned 19 handguns, according to Vance's Senate biography, was a big influence on his life.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Vance enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nHe holds a law degree from Yale\n\nAs Vance discussed at length in his book, adapting to the social expectations and nuances of the elite culture at Yale University was initially a challenge for him. Vance graduated with a law degree from Yale in 2013.\n\nIn the Senate\n\nVance serves on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; the Commerce Science and Transportation Committee, Joint Economic Committee and the Special Committee on Aging.\n\nVance's wife, Usha, is an accomplished lawyer\n\nVance met his wife, Usha Chilukuri, at Yale. They married in 2014. She is a litigator and clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when Kavanaugh was a federal judge. Vance and Chilukuri, who is Indian-American, have three young children."
