        "text": "Johnson and Levinson were all set to make \"Donnie Brasco\" (1997) with Al Pacino and Tom Cruise when \"GoodFellas\" (1990) came out and \"no one wanted to compete with Martin Scorsese,\" so they shelved the movie indefinitely, eventually casting Johnny Depp opposite Pacino. Away from Levinson, Johnson produced Clint Eastwood's \"A Perfect World\" (1993) and Alfonso Cuaron's remake of \"The Little Princess\" (1995), the third film adapted from Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel \"Sarah Crewe.\" Don Parisot's \"Home Fries\" (1998), starring Drew Barrymore, reteamed him with Levinson (and Lawrence Kasdan and Charles Newirth) as producers, and he executive produced Rand Ravich's \"The Astronaut's Wife\" (1999). Among the numerous projects Johnson has in various stages of development are the TV pilot \"Falcone,\" based on the same material that was the basis for \"Donnie Brasco,\" and a screen version of Nicholas Sparks' best-seller \"The Notebook\" (lensed 1999)."
