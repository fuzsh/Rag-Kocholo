Sadly, her happiness is horribly threatened when her father must go to fight in World War I and she is sent to boarding school in New York. Naturally, her free-spirited ways are perceived as a threat by the severe headmistress, though many of the girls there find her enchanting. While the headmistress allows her a bit of leeway initially because of her father's wealth, something happens to dramatically change her situation. Sara gets the devastating word that her father is missing in action and has apparently been killed. Suddenly, she becomes a complete outcast who is relegated to the role of servant, but her imagination and hope keeps her from complete misery."
