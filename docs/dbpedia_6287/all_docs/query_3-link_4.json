        "text": "A Little Princess is a 1995 American family drama film directed by Alfonson Cuaron, which was released on May 10, 1995 by Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nIt is based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel of the same name.\n\nPlot[]\n\nWhen Sara Crewe is sent to a boarding school in New York City while her father, Richard is serving in World War I, she makes the best of things by entertaining her new friends with stories; however, when Richard goes missing, she is forced to work in servitude.\n\nCast[]\n\nLiesel Matthews as Sara Crewe\n\nEleanor Bron as Miss Maria Minchin\n\nLiam Cunningham as Captain Richard Crewe/Prince Rama\n\nVanessa Lee Chester as Becky\n\nCamilla Belle as Jane\n\nRachael Bella as Betsy\n\nKaitlin Cullum as Ruth\n\nTaylor Fry as Lavinia\n\nHeather DeLoach as Ermengarde\n\nKelsey Mulrooney as Lottie\n\nPeggy Miley as Mabel\n\nRusty Schwimmer as Amelia\n\nArthur Malet as Charles Randolph\n\nErrol Sitahal as Ram Dass\n\nVincent Schiavelli as Mr. Barrow\n\nAlison Moir as Princess Sita\n\nLomax Study as Monsieur Dufarge\n\nDarcie Bradford as Jesse\n\nAlexandra Rea-Baum as Gertrude\n\nLauren Blumenfeld as Rosemary\n\nProduction[]\n\nPrincipal photography for \"A Little Princess\" began on April 11, 1994 and ended on July 11, 1994.\n\nFilming locations included Chicago, Illinois; Taj Mahal, Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India; Simla, Himachal Pradesh, India; and Burbank, California.

Domestically and worldwide, it grossed $10,015,449.\n\nCritical Reception[]\n\n\"A Little Princess\" received critical acclaim upon its release. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 97% based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site's consensus states: \"Alfonso Cuarón adapts Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel with a keen sense of magic realism, vividly recreating the world of childhood as seen through the characters.\"\n\nJanet Maslin called the film a \"bright, beautiful and enchantingly childlike vision,\" one that \"draw[s] its audience into the wittily heightened reality of a fairy tale\" and \"takes enough liberties to re-invent rather than embalm Miss Burnett's assiduously beloved story.\"\n\nRita Kempley of The Washington Post called \"A Little Princess\" Alfonso Cuarón's \"dazzling North American debut\" and wrote that it \"exquisitely re-creates the ephemeral world of childhood, an enchanted kingdom where everything, even make-believe, seems possible.\"\n\nWriting for Variety, Todd McCarthy said: \"An astonishing work of studio artifice, A Little Princess is that rarest of creations, a children's film that plays equally well to kids and adults.\"\n\nRoger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times said: \"[Alfonso] Cuaron's version of magic realism consists of seeing incredibly fanciful sets and situations in precise detail, and Johnson has provided him with the freedom and logistical support to create such places as the street where Miss Minchin's school looms so impressively.\"\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum from the Chicago Reader wrote: \"The virtues on display are very much those of the heroine: generosity, imagination, charm, and the capacity to keep an audience mesmerized with a good story.\"\n\nThe San Francisco Examiner called \"A Little Princess\" a \"delightful film.\"\n\nJames Berardinelli from ReelViews wrote: \"To be sure, A Little Princess has a few missteps. For one thing, Miss Minchin could have been played with less villainy, but younger viewers will probably appreciate the one-dimensional nastiness. There are also a few moments of overt sweetness, but these are easily forgiven. Actually, there's very little this movie has to apologize for -- it's the rare kind of picture that can be enjoyed by viewers of 8, 18, and 80.\"\n\nAwards[]\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association Awards (1995)\n\nBest Music: Patrick Doyle [Winner]\n\nBest Production Design: Bo Welch [Winner]\n\nNew Generation Award: Alfonso Cuarón [Winner]\n\nBest Picture [Nominated]\n\nAwards Circuit Community Awards (1995)\n\nBest Art Direction: Bo Welch (production design) and Cheryl Carasik (set decoration) [Nominated]\n\nBest Costume Design: Judianna Makovsky [Nominated]\n\nAcademy Awards (1996)\n\nBest Cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki [Nominated]\n\nBest Art Direction (Set Decoration): Bo Welch and Cheryl Carasik [Nominated]\n\nDallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association Awards (1996)\n\nBest Picture [Nominated]\n\nYoung Artist Awards"
