        "text": "Throughout the decades of film that audiences have been blessed with, a classic and often re-visited sub-genre is that of espionage. These days, many different characters come to mind but no spy is quite as iconic as Bond… James Bond. One of the most famous characters of all time to hit the silver screen, James Bond has been a recurring character from his beginnings in 1962. Played so far by 6 different James Bond actors (soon to be 7 after Aaron Taylor-Johnson was offered the role), each film honors the classic Bond tropes but to each their own flavor of James. Do you like it shaken or stirred? As any fan of Bond knows there is only one right answer.\n\nTo celebrate 60 years of Bond, we’ve cultivated a list of each and every film in order of the actor that played the role. Though a James Bond movie marathon may seem a daunting task, any fan of spy movies should consider it worthwhile to see every Bond movie at least once. With no defined end in sight for this timeless movie series, it’s quite possible that a new Bond timeline will open up in the near future. Due to this, it’s best to know exactly where to begin your James Bond film education from beginning to present.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nLooking for more espionage? You can also check out our list of the best spy movies of all time.\n\nHow Many James Bond Movies Are There?\n\nThere are a total of 26 James Bond films played by 6 different Bond actors. With the first film releasing in 1962, the James Bond movie franchises is officially over 60 years old -- making it one of the longest-running movie franchises of all time. Although we don't now who the next James Bond will be, it is innevitable that there will be future movies in the series.\n\nHow to Watch All the James Bond Movies in Order\n\nWith 6 different actors and 26 movies in the series, watching all of the James Bond movies is a rather daunting task. If you're hoping to watch the films in chronological order, your best bet is to stick to the actors and work your way down the list. You can also watch the movies by release order, but the timeline gets a bit thrown off due to Sean Connery coming back multiple times.\n\nJump to:\n\nSean Connery Bond Movies in Order\n\nGeorge Lazenby Bond Movies in Order\n\nRoger Moore Bond Movies in Order\n\nTimothy Dalton Bond Movies in Order\n\nPierce Brosnan Bond Movies in Order\n\nDaniel Craig Bond Movies in Order\n\nHow to Watch By Release Date\n\nAll Sean Connery Bond Movies in Order\n\nStarting our list from the first sign of Bond in 1962, Ian Fleming’s James Bond character gets a strong start with the help of Sean Connery: who many find to be the best Bond of them all. Starring in 7 Bond films, Connery takes the lead with most Bond movies combined. Connery’s stint as Bond is also unique in the way that not all 7 were chronological. He paved the way as Bond from 1962 to 1967 with his first 5 films, came back for another in 1971, and then even another in 1983. This, among other things, is evidence that people simply loved Connery’s Bond.\n\n1. Dr. No (1962)\n\nIn the very first James Bond installment, Dr. No strongly kicks off the saga with style and grace. Though this film was an iconic beginning, the Bond formula was only in it’s beginning stages. Despite this, the regular tropes already began to take shape: the clever quips, the assassination attempts, the fancy spy gadgets, and more importantly: the Bond girl. Played by Ursula Andress, Honey Ryder began the tradition of the Bond girl to play alongside Bond in his exploits.\n\n2. From Russia with Love (1963)\n\nIn the second Bond installment, From Russia with Love capitalizes on the success of Dr. No in a great way. In what some would consider to be a step up from the last film, this film jumps right into the dreaded criminal organization called SPECTRE, which re-appears periodically throughout the 60 years of Bond and was introduced already in Dr. No. Among other things, this is something that helps to make this a strong filim, as well as its references to the Cold War.\n\n3. Goldfinger (1964)\n\nJust when audiences thought it couldn’t get any better, Goldfinger hits the screen and blows everyone away. Raved about for being the most Bond of all the Bond films, Goldfinger takes the blueprints of the Bond movie formula and absolutely perfects it. Between the dastardly villain that turns victims into gold and the evil sidekick Oddjob that throws a bladed hat, this was the true beginning of the Bond movie style that became so re-useable. This was also the first Bond film that introduced the ‘Bond Song’ (by Shirley Bassey) and the accompanying intro sequence as well as the legendary performance by Desmond Llewelyn as Q, who would continue this role for decades.\n\n4. Thunderball (1965)\n\nTaking a slight dive in overall quality, Thunderball was not received so well by critics as the first three films were. Despite this, this fourth Bond film in four years still acts as a great addition to the saga. With it’s entertaining action sequences, varying settings, and continuation of the battle between Bond and SPECTRE, this is a logical and enjoyable film that’s a whole lot of fun.\n\n5. You Only Live Twice (1967)\n\nIn his fifth and seemingly last Bond film, Connery reprises the role of Bond once again in You Only Live Twice. Though it is not rated as his best Bond film, it still holds up as a fun and worthy classic in the lineup. Set in Japan, we get some creative set designs, costuming, and themes that make this a somewhat unique Bond film.\n\n6. Diamonds Are Forever (1971)\n\nDue to the initial bad taste that Lazenby left on critics tongues with On her Majesty's Secret Service, the studio pined for Connery’s return. Desperate for the commercial success of the first 5 Bond films, they offered Connery a then record breaking salary of $1.25 million to return as Bond along with Goldfinger director Guy Hamilton.\n\nThough this movie was cautiously designed for commercial success–to regain the promise that the series once ha, Diamonds Are Forever is a fairly run-of-the-mill addition to the saga. Checking all the boxes to make this film everything a Bond film should be, it still does so with noticeably less gusto than the previous Connery films. This is not said to disparage the film, as it is still a fun action movie that is everything one would expect it to be.\n\n7. Never Say Never Again (1983)\n\nTo everyone’s surprise Sean Connery comes back again to play the slick spy more than ten years later. Although Connery had promised to never return as Bond again, the plot for Never Say Never Again is basically a re-imagining of Thunderball but the version that Kevin McClory wanted to make. Fleming went on to novelize the other version of the plot that we are more familiar with, not sharing any writing credit with McClory or co-writer Jack Whittingham. McClory filed for a successful copyright claim and was given the right to act on his version once ten years had passed. It was difficult to secure Connery for the role, but his $3 million contract sure helped to seal the deal.\n\nThough most would consider this to not even qualify as a Bond film (first non-Eon production), Never Say Never Again contains everything it needs to be considered a Bond film: a Bond song, Bond girls, spy gadgets, Q, M, a plot revolving around SPECTRE, and most important of all: Sean Connery. Taking on the look and feel of a 1960’s Bond movie, the results turned out surprisingly well. This is also partially due to the supporting role by Kim Basinger as Domino Petachi: a Bond girl that still wouldn’t pass the Bechdel test but is a big step above the previous leading ladies.\n\nAll George Lazenby Bond Movies in Order\n\nThe only actor to portray Bond in only one film, George Lazenby had an extremely short-lived career in the Ian Fleming inspired saga. Collectively jeered at by critics in his time, the Australian model was an odd choice for Bond as his acting experience was minimal and his performance a bit rigid at times. As the second actor to portray Bond, the expectations were very high for Lazenby. Because of this, critiques of George were arguably a bit too harsh. After all this time, his presence in the Bond saga has become hailed as one of the staples.\n\n1. On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969)\n\nLazenby’s mark on the Bond saga, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service feels as though we’ve jumped into another universe, one that rubbed many the wrong way. This film was special in the way that it focused on Bond as a human, not just as the rugged, charming spy he is. Though the plot, action sequences, villains, Bond girls, and Bond song are all quite solid and enjoyable, poor George was the target of criticism for this film. This film was considered the fourth worst Bond film in terms of commercial success.\n\nAll Roger Moore Bond Movies in Order\n\nOne of the more skeptically received Bond actors by audiences, Roger Moore begins his stretch as the sharp-tongued, quick-witted action-hero. Employing quite a bit more of a tongue-in-cheek comedy style, Moore consistently delivered as Bond with a campy nature that audiences would come to enjoy. Leaving his stamp firmly on the saga, many agreed that his newer style and way of speaking turned Bond into a lighter, less rugged version of himself that was an accepted change of pace.\n\n1. Live and Let Die (1973)\n\nStarting off from a decent place, Moore landed mostly on his feet in his new role that audiences had come to love so much. Though it was hard to see someone other than Connery in the role, critics and audiences agreed that it was at least better than Lazenby’s appearance – at least at first. Securely placed in the top three of Moore’s films, Live and Let Die was an overall success that promised a bright future for the lovable character. This movie also features one of the most iconic Bond songs to date performed by Paul McCartney and Wings.\n\n2. The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)\n\nTaking a significant dive in overall movie quality, The Man with the Golden Gun was ammunition for Roger Moore critics. It is known that there were many variables that caused this film to be so badly received, which says that there was likely a lack of spirit from many departments for the creation of this film. Despite this, the mere inclusion of Christopher Lee as the villain makes it worth the watch, towering over our protagonist with an expectedly sound performance.\n\n3. The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)\n\nHailed by critics as the best of the Roger Moore Bond films, The Spy Who Loved Me was the revival that the Bond series desperately needed. Among other things, it was a reminder of Moore’s ability to make the character his very own, setting himself apart from virtually every other actor that had our would reprise the role of Bond.\n\n4. Moonraker (1979)\n\nMaintaining the chaotic ups and downs of the Roger Moore era, Moonraker takes the James Bond saga to arguably ridiculous levels. Silly dialogue mixed with genuinely impressive set designs and creative gadgets make this Bond film an enjoyable spectacle of borderline Star Wars proportions. When taking a closer look at its marketing, even the movie poster looks like it is a Star Wars hybrid parody of itself but still very much worth the watch.\n\n5. For Your Eyes Only (1981)\n\nMost likely the second most successful Roger Moore installment, For Your Eyes Only is a fairly common Bond style action film with all the usual quips and quirks. Considering this was the next Bond film after the fairly outlandish Moonraker, it was a logical and careful choice to make this one by the books. Boasting another better-than-average Bond song and an adequately entertaining plot, no risks were made here but still qualifies as a worthy addition.\n\n6. Octopussy (1983)\n\nGoing against the usual up and down pattern between Bond films, one might expect that Octopussy would jump up the scale in outrageousness, which is only partially true for this film. While it is quite campy and Moore-esque, it mostly follows the formula that they have adapted for Roger Moore’s Bond. In spite of this, there are still some memorable action sequences that slightly deviate from the usual.\n\n7. A View to a Kill (1985)\n\nProbably the most over-the-top and silly Bond film of all time, A View to a Kill is a cheese fest that many had mixed feelings about. Even though critics widely regarded it simply as a bad Bond film, there are still some redeeming qualities that make it a great time. The inclusion of Christopher Walken as the main villain is one of them and is one of the biggest reason to watch it. Also as a great surprise, the Bond song is a rockingly awesome Duran Duran hit that was the only Bond song to ever hit number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAll Timothy Dalton Bond Moies in Order\n\nIntroducing Timothy Dalton as Bond: the man forever remembered for his eyebrows. Dalton upon arrival was not so well liked, but as we already know, audiences and critics haven’t taken to new Bond’s so well in the past either. With Timothy Dalton, however, it seemed that something was indeed different. Dalton’s portrayal of Bond was a fairly strong step into the realm of seriousness. Fewer quips and more modernized visual effects created a more stern tone, pointing the film more towards a drama than a classic Bond film. Either way, the thick and defining facial features on Dalton probably added to the stoney demeanor. Unfortunately, Dalton was only granted the honor of playing Bond twice.\n\n1. The Living Daylights (1987)\n\nTaking a big step into the next generation of Bond films, The Living Daylights is a strongly toned and well-made action movie starring the new guy: Timothy Dalton. A movie that was initially not-so-well received due to aforementioned qualities, this new-era Bond film has aged very well with its significant decrease in misogyny. Because of the new direction that Eon Productions was taking, this was the beginning of what would eventually shape into the modern Bond formula.\n\n2. License to Kill (1989)\n\nAs if the tonal change in the last film wasn’t significant enough, License to Kill was by far the darkest Bond film yet. Luckily, audiences and critics were more prepared this time to see Dalton as their favorite, gadget-wielding fancyman. What made this film strong was the matured plot, as Dalton brought a fierce intensity to a Bond gone rogue and driven to destroy a drug ring by any means necessary. Dalton may have been hard to get used to but his movies will age gracefully.\n\nAll Pierce Brosnan Bond Movies in Order\n\nMoving right on to who most people claim is the second-best Bond of all time, Pierce Brosnan took the role by force and stunned audiences. Clever, handsome, fit, charming, and merciless, Brosnan’s Bond is a perfect combination of all the best of the previous ones. Going on to star in four above-average Bond films, Brosnan was key to the improvement of quality as well as promising a secure future for many Bond movies to come. This was also the beginning of the Judi Dench era, where she would play a fiercely awesome portrayal of M. Many argue about which of Brosnan’s Bond films are the best, which is a good testament to the overall quality of them all.\n\n1. GoldenEye (1995)\n\nThe first ever Bond film to suggest corruption and instability within MI6, GoldenEye deals with all new themes and action styles that split the possibilities for future Bond films wide open. Sent on a mission that seems fairly typical, Bond is exposed to secrets and betrayals that unfolds into a scandal bigger than any agent alone. Played brilliantly by Sean Bean, 006 (A.K.A. Alec Treveylan) is an agent gone rogue that Bond must take down. Also features a great performance from Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp.\n\n2. Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)\n\nTaking a slight dive in overall quality from the previous Brosnan Bond film comes Tomorrow Never Dies. Not quite as bold as GoldenEye as far as plot originality but still very much an entertaining spectacle. A great highlight of this flim is the inclusion of Michelle Yeoh as the kickass Bond girl Wai Lin, doing her fair share of taking down the bad guys. It also never hurts to have a dastardly and borderline charming villain, of which Jonathan Pryce does an eerily good job at.\n\n3. The World is Not Enough (1999)\n\nProbably the most campy of the Pierce Brosnan Bond era, The World is Not Enough still has plenty of good things going for it. Despite having an extremely safe plot and a few underwhelming performances, the film is saved by its strong villain (Robert Carlyle as Renard) and edge-of-your-seat, indelible action sequences. This was also the very last performance from the iconic Q portrayed by Desmond Llewelyn before his untimely passing.\n\n4. Die Another Day (2002)\n\nSo far the flashiest and wildest ride in the Bond series, Die Another Day is explosive, fun, and action-packed; everything that a new-era Bond movie should be. It also features a memorable intro – accompanied by an awesome Bond song by Madonna – where Bond is captured and tortured by enemy forces. This is the one and only time that this happens in the Bond saga and creates a unique starting point for the last Brosnan Bond film.\n\nAll Daniel Craig Bond Movies in Order\n\nAnother situation where fans and critics alike were flabbergasted by the new casting, Daniel Craig was a difficult adjustment for some. Some say it was due to his blonde hair and sapphire blue eyes, some announced that they just thought he looked weird. Either way, Daniel Craig would go on to be a part of the revolution that changed the way Bond films are built. Starring in the first ever Bond series to be on a chronological timeline, the story between Craig’s five Bond films is all directly connected. This, among other things to be mentioned, is what makes Craig’s Bond so special.\n\n1. Casino Royale (2006)\n\nFeaturing an impressive combination of modern filming methods, fight choreography, and exceptional performances from all parties, Casino Royale is a fun, gripping Bond film that changes the way the character appears forever. Focusing mostly on a high-stakes poker game, the writing in this film had to be crisp and concise to keep audiences enthralled. It helps quite a bit that there is always an intense action scene squeezed in between all poker scenes.\n\n2. Quantum of Solace (2008)\n\nReverting back to the old rhythm of Bond films, the second Craig installment was considerably less impressive – which could be due to the booming success of the first. Thought possibly overshadowed by its predecessor, Quantum of Solace is noticeably lacking in effort when it comes to plot. Despite competent performances and a few entertaining action sequences, the sheer, unaimed darkness of this film overpowers a lot of other aspects. Still very much worth the watch though, in order to keep up with the chronological story.\n\n3. Skyfall (2012)\n\nA successful re-vamp of the Daniel Craig Bond series, Skyfall jumps right back up in the rankings of quality Bond films. Featuring a somewhat similar plot to Goldeneye, a past double-O agent turns evil and threatens to take down MI6 completely. Played wonderfully by Javier Bardem, Silva is one of the more maniacally terrifying villains in the history of Bond, making the audience question who is more just in their actions. This film is unique in the way that it is a lot about Bond growing older and out of the game, creating a new conflict for our seemingly invincible hero.\n\n4. Spectre (2015)\n\nPushing ever so much closer to the classic Bond formula, Spectre is a nod to the originals in a few ways. Even though the Craig films stay chronological, a new, alternate universe is explored where Bond finally discovers that the root of all the evils he has faced is due to SPECTRE – the criminal organization mentioned multiple times in the classic movies. Though it was not so popular as the other Craig Bond films, the villain, Blofeld played by Christoph Waltz (another re-incorportation from the classics), was another impressive addition that secured its success.\n\n5. No Time to Die (2021)\n\nIn the most recent James Bond movie, No Time to Die, we explore new, and untraversed themes that seemed to tell audiences they weren’t sure if Bond would go on any longer. Bond is officially retired in this film and tries to live out his days happily, though – not surprisingly– quite unsuccessfully. Though this film seems to jump around a bit inconsistently, the strengths of this film heavily outweigh the negatives. Spoilers for this film would truly be a disaster to disclose, so it’s probably time that you get started watching all 26 (or 25) Bond films in chronological order to be prepared for whatever may come next.\n\nHow to Watch the James Bond Movies by Release Date\n\nIf you're hoping to watch the bond movies by release order rather than chronologically by actor, we've got you covered:\n\nDr. No (1962)\n\nFrom Russia with Love (1963)\n\nGoldfinger (1964)\n\nThunderball (1965)\n\nYou Only Live Twice (1967)\n\nOn Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969)\n\nDiamonds Are Forever (1971)\n\nLive and Let Die (1973)\n\nThe Man with the Golden Gun (1974)\n\nThe Spy Who Loved Me (1977)\n\nMoonraker (1979)\n\nFor Your Eyes Only (1981)\n\nOctopussy (1983)\n\nNever Say Never Again (1983)\n\nA View to a Kill (1985)\n\nThe Living Daylights (1987)\n\nLicense to Kill (1989)\n\nGoldeneye (1995)\n\nTomorrow Never Dies (1997)\n\nThe World is Not Enough (1999)\n\nDie Another Day (2002)\n\nCasino Royale (2006)\n\nQuantum of Solace (2008)\n\nSkyfall (2012)\n\nSpectre (2015)\n\nNo Time to Die (2021)\n\nThe Future of James Bond Movies\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nJames Bond never truly goes away, and while Daniel Craig's run as 007 has come to an end, a new Bond is inevitable.
