Prolific in film and television since her teens, she is the recipient of three Primetime Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards. In 2012, Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nDanes first gained recognition for starring in the 1994 teen drama series My So-Called Life,[2] winning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and receiving a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She made her film debut in the same year in Little Women (1994), and gained wider fame for starring in the romance Romeo + Juliet (1996). Danes has since appeared in The Rainmaker (1997), Brokedown Palace (1999), The Hours (2002), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Shopgirl (2005), and Stardust (2007).

Although ABC canceled My So-Called Life in 1995, her higher profile led to being cast in several film roles,[14] including 1995's Home for the Holidays and 1996's I Love You, I Love You Not and To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday.\n\nHer first leading role on the big screen came in 1996, when she portrayed Juliet in the film Romeo + Juliet,[14] inspiring director Baz Luhrmann to call her, at age 16, \"the Meryl Streep of her generation\".[24] Later that year, it was reported that she turned down the female lead role in Titanic.[28][29]\n\nIn 1997, Danes played abused wife Kelly Riker in The Rainmaker, directed by Francis Ford Coppola,[14] as well as Jenny in Oliver Stone's noir U Turn.\n\nIn 1998, she played several very different roles: Cosette in Les Misérables, and the pregnant teenage daughter of Polish immigrants in Polish Wedding.\n\nIn 1999, she made her first appearance in an animated feature with the English version of Princess Mononoke.

She also starred in Brokedown Palace.\n\nDanes left her career temporarily to attend Yale, having made 13 films in five years.[14] In 2002, she returned to film. She starred in Igby Goes Down. Later that year, she co-starred as Clarissa Vaughan's (played by Meryl Streep) daughter in the Oscar-nominated film The Hours. The following year, she was cast in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, followed by Stage Beauty in 2004. She earned critical acclaim in 2005 when she starred in Shopgirl and The Family Stone.

She was also featured in the 2008 film, Me and Orson Welles.\n\nTheatre\n\n[edit]\n\nDanes got her start in New York City theater appearing in performances of Happiness, Punk Ballet, and Kids Onstage, for which she choreographed her own dance. In April 2000, she appeared off Broadway in Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues. In November of that same year, she appeared as Emily Webb in a one-night-only staged reading of Thornton Wilder's Our Town at All Saints' Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills. The production was staged by Bess Armstrong, who had played the mother of Danes's character on My So-Called Life.[31]\n\nIn September 2005, Danes returned to New York's Performance Space 122, where she had performed as a child. She appeared in choreographer Tamar Rogoff's solo dance piece \"Christina Olson: American Model\", where she portrayed the subject of Andrew Wyeth's famous painting Christina's World. Olson suffered from muscular deterioration that left her weak and partially paralyzed.[32] Danes was praised for her dance skills and acting in the project.[33][34]\n\nIn January 2007, Danes performed in Performance Space 122's Edith and Jenny.[35] Later in 2007, Danes made her Broadway theatre debut as Eliza Doolittle in the Roundabout Theatre Company revival of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, directed by David Grindley at the American Airlines Theatre.[36]\n\nIn January 2012, Harvard University's Hasty Pudding Theatricals named Danes their 2012 Woman of the Year.[37]\n\nIn March 2016, Danes performed in Dry Powder by Sarah Burgess at The Public Theater, starring alongside John Krasinski, Hank Azaria and Sanjit De Silva. The play was directed by Thomas Kail.[38]\n\nOther work\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1995, Danes was the main character of Soul Asylum's music video for the song \"Just Like Anyone\".\n\nIn 1997, Danes wrote an introduction to Neil Gaiman's Death: The Time of Your Life.[39]\n\nIn 2012, Danes's audiobook recording of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale was released at Audible.com.

Restrictions imposed on Danes involved a ban from entering Manila or the Philippines and prohibition on distribution of her films in the region.[notes 1] The ban came after Danes said Manila, the capital of the Philippines, \"smelled of cockroaches, with rats all over, and that there is no sewage system, and the people do not have anything – no arms, no legs, no eyes\". Danes later apologized for those remarks, but they refused to lift the ban.[45][46][47]\n\nDanes and her mother are supporters of the charity Afghan Hands, which helps women in Afghanistan gain independence, education, and livable wages.[48] Danes is also a long time supporter of DonorsChoose, a website that allows public school teachers to create project requests.[49][50][51]\n\nDanes is a feminist and has been critical of female underrepresentation within Hollywood.[52][53]\n\nRelationships and family\n\n[edit]\n\nDanes met singer Ben Lee at her eighteenth birthday party in 1997. They dated for six years before separating in 2003.[54]\n\nIn 2003, Danes began dating actor Billy Crudup, with whom she starred in Stage Beauty. Their relationship attracted significant media attention, as it led to Crudup's break-up with actor Mary-Louise Parker, who was seven months pregnant with their child at the time. Danes and Crudup's relationship lasted until 2006. Reflecting on their relationship, Danes had commented in 2015, \"That was a scary thing. It was really hard. I didn't know how to not do that. I was just in love with him, and needed to explore that, and I was 24 ... I didn't quite know what those consequences would be. But it's OK. I went through it.\"[55][56][57]\n\nDanes met actor Hugh Dancy on the set of the film Evening in 2006. They announced their engagement in February 2009 and married in France later that year.[58][59] They have three children: two sons born in 2012 and 2018,[60][61] and a daughter born in
