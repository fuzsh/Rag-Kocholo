        "text": "We take our breakfast seriously in New Jersey, there’s no messing around.\n\nFew know that better than the people behind Brownstone Pancake Factory, they provide the Garden State with super indulgent pancake stacks and milkshakes, among there many other items.\n\nFor example, this is their Reese’s Pieces Waffle Shake.\n\nThat could fill me for the whole day.\n\nWhy wait until after dinner to celebrate making another trip around the sun? Instead have the Birthday Cake Pancakes to mark your special occasion.\n\nAnd for any other Sunday fun day - they have Chunky Monkey Pancakes.\n\nAs well as their Cracker Jack Twinkie Pancakes.\n\nThose with a sweet tooth will definitely want to try the Oreo Reese’s Peanut Butter Shake.\n\nOr the Fruity Pebbles Cheesecake Shake, which looks like something straight out of a cartoon.\n\nFor any fans of the the show 'Parks and Recreation,' you’ll appreciate the “treat yo self” approach that Brownstone has (not to mention - Leslie Knope, being a huge fan of breakfast foods, would lose her mind seeing what they have to offer).\n\nTreat. Yo. Self.\n\nAs they say on their website:\n\nLife is short, play with your food. Have fun with your loved ones and just unleash a little. There is always room for a cheat meal!\n\nBrownstone Pancake Factory has four New Jersey locations, you can find them in Edgewater, Englewood Cliffs, Brick, and Freehold.\n\nBut maybe you want Brownstone to come to you instead - their food truck is now available for bookings. You can check out. Info on how to have them at your event on their website."
