        "text": "The Austin Film Festival has release its full film slate for its 23rd annual event, with marquee titles such as La La Land starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and Trespass Against Us with Michael Fassbender and Brandon Glesson. The fest, which runs October 13-20, already had set Jeff Nichols’ Loving as the opening night feature. Other big titles to be screened include Lion starring Nicole Kidman, Dev Patel and Rooney Mara; Wakefield featuring Brian Cranston and Jennifer Garner from writer-director Robin Swicord; and the animated feature Nerdland with Paul Rudd and Patton Oswalt.\n\nThe lineup includes 20 world premieres for films such as One Night, an indie-romance with Anna Camp from writer-director Minhal Baig, The Writer’s Burrow, gender exploration doc The Big Flip—Stories From The Modern Household and Austin-based comedy Hot Air. The fest will also feature Retrospective series guest programmed by Jason Segel, Paul Feig, Phil Rosenthal, and others.\n\nPreviously announced, Ghostbusters director Paul Feig will be honored for his contribution to film and Nancy Meyers (Something’s Gotta Give) will be given the Distinguished Screenwriter Award.
