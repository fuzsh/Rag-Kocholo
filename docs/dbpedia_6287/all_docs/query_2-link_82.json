He and I were both inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame the same year and he was a father figure to me, so it’s a full circle moment and feels truly special.”\n\nAdditional honorees include executives Scott Mills, Louis Carr, Constance Orlando, and Kimberly Paige of BET Media Group, who will be jointly recognized with the Social Impact Award. The BMAC Change Agent Award will go to Ivy McGregor, executive director of BeyGOOD, Beyoncé’s non-profit organization.
