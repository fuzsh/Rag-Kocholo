        "text": "Alfonso Cuarón is reinventing his approach\n\nto moviemaking; reinventing its place in his life. A child of the\n\nmovies, he has been working in one capacity or another in the industry\n\nsince the age of 14, when he first began to sneak onto film sets\n\nin his hometown of Mexico City. A stint at Mexico’s National Film\n\nAcademy was followed by any number of production jobs, boom man,\n\ncameraman, etc., and ultimately, a decade of steady work as an AD.\n\nHe worked on a lot of pictures, most of them low-budget American\n\nflicks shot in Mexico: \"A lot of crappy movies. Mostly horror\n\nfilms, \" he says.\n\nAfter directing a few episodes of a local serial produced\n\nby a friend, who identified him as ‘up-and-coming, ‘ Alfonso broke\n\nout with his first feature, a comedy called Love in the Time\n\nof Hysteria (1991). Though the film was never released in the\n\nU.S., he was soon making steady inroads in Hollywood, eventually\n\nlanding a deal to direct The Little Princess (1995) for producer\n\nMark Johnson. It was a job the director fought to secure, and his\n\neffort paid off. The film was a critical success and did respectable\n\nbox office business, too. But his next picture, a modern retelling\n\nof Charles Dickens’ classic, Great Expectations, was a weaker\n\nfilm and left the director questioning the course of his career.\n\nHungry for a fresh start, Curaón returned to\n\nan idea he and long-time collaborator Emmaunel Zabezki, the only\n\nDP Alfonso has ever worked with, tossed around years before: a film\n\nset in Mexico, about a couple of young guys on the cusp of manhood\n\nwho take up one summer with a beautiful young woman several years\n\ntheir senior. A sexy road movie, a coming of age film, a dispassionate\n\nand often blunt take on modern day Mexican social and political\n\nrealities, Y Tu Mama Tambien, slang for \"and your mama,\n\ntoo’, is everything the director needed to bring him back to the\n\ncinema he loves. In this interview with MM, Alfonso talked about\n\nthe film’s off-the-cuff visual and narrative style, where it took\n\nhim as a director and how those pesky Mexican censors tried to take\n\na cut out of the film’s target audience.\n\nPhillip Williams (MM): How was making Y Tu Mama Tambien different from your other films?\n\nAlfonso Cuarón (AC): It was a complete\n\ndeparture from anything I’d done before. I tried a very objective\n\napproach, which is quite different from my other films, that were\n\nvery subjective. I tried to be restrained and removed and let the\n\nactors go with the flow of the scenes. Trusting the material more;\n\ntrusting the actors more. That was the biggest lesson.\n\nMM: With the various observations the film\n\ncaptures about the current state of Mexico, the military presence\n\nand so forth, would you say that it’s an anti-PRI film (the dominant\n\npolitical party in Mexico)?\n\nAC: We tried not to make a judgement; we just\n\ntried to make an observation. For us, this movie is about identity.\n\nTwo young men seeking their identity as adults; a woman seeking\n\nher identity as a liberated woman, more in a spiritual sense than\n\nan ideological sense. Together with that is an observation of a\n\ncountry that in our opinion is a teenage country looking for its\n\nidentity as a grown-up country. So we were not trying to make a\n\ncriticism of the PRI, it was just inherent in the situation. Whatever\n\nyou see in Mexico will reflect on who has been ruling the country\n\nfor the last 71 years. This transition toward a new identity is\n\npart of what Mexico is going through now.\n\nMM: In terms of some of the more overt political\n\ncontent in the picture, the police stopping people on the\n\nside of the road and the student demonstrations, how much\n\nwas in the script and how much did you add during production?\n\nAC: Everything was pretty much in the script,\n\nbut in the process of prepping the movie we were adapting everything.\n\nWhen my brother Carlos and I were writing the script, we decided\n\nthat context was going to be as important as character. When we\n\nwrote the script we quoted certain events that then we had to adapt\n\nbecause reality was also dictating to us. What I mean is, there\n\nare little scenes in the script that we saw new possibilities for\n\nduring scouting. In some cases we would photograph an event we witnessed\n\nfirst-hand and then reproduce it when we were shooting. In other\n\ninstances we picked up material, documentary-like, while were shooting.\n\nFor example, the roadblocks set up by police, you\n\nare not supposed to shoot those things. We stole those shots. The\n\nsecond or third time that we crossed a roadblock the police became\n\nvery suspicious (laughs). When the lead characters need to retrieve\n\ntheir car keys from one of their sisters, whose office is at the\n\nNational University, the National University was actually on strike.\n\nThe police invaded the university and arrested hundreds of students\n\nand put them in prison. So there was a massive demonstration of\n\n150, 000 people demanding the release of these students. Instead\n\nof looking for another location our Director of Photography said,\n\n‘Why don’t we use the demonstration?’\n\nMM: I’m assuming you used just one camera\n\nand available light?\n\nAC: One hand-held camera, available light and\n\na lot of stress because it was a very fiery demonstration.\n\nMM: Did you get what you wanted?\n\nAC: Yes! I got more than what I wanted. And\n\nit was good because it was the first thing that we shot and it was\n\nlike, ‘okay, we have to do it. Let’s do it.’ And we were still doing\n\ncostume tests and so on. We knew that whatever the characters were\n\nwearing in that scene they would be wearing for a large chunk of\n\nthe film and the hair as well. So that morning we had to make a\n\nlot of quick decisions and just go for it.\n\nMM: How do you prepare for a film?\n\nAC: Preparing begins from the moment you start\n\nworking on a story. It’s amazing how your head works on the story\n\neven when you are not. Now that I’m coming back to write, I find\n\nit very enjoyable. Since doing Y Tu Mama I think I’ll tend\n\nto be a little more loose in how I approach the work. I used to\n\nbe so detailed about every single element and aspect of the process;\n\nnow I’d like to rely a bit more on chance, to see what chance brings.\n\nConnect with life and see what life decides for you.\n\nMM: Your next film will be a larger studio\n\nfilm again. How do you think you will prepare?\n\nAC: It will depend on which film I’m doing,\n\nand even which scenes I’m approaching. With certain films it would\n\nbe crazy not to storyboard, not to do a shot list. You have to organize\n\na lot of people; a lot of people need to be in sync with what you\n\nare doing. I take a lot of pleasure in doing storyboards because\n\nI love the drawing process and I love how it becomes a common tool\n\nof conversation with the different departments, even though you\n\ndon’t always follow the storyboards. In a way it becomes a rehearsal\n\nfor you. The problem was that I used to rely too much on that. Now\n\nI’m getting a lot more pleasure out of the human element of the\n\nprocess rather than the technical element.\n\nMM: What is your feeling about how Y\n\nTu Mama Tambien was rated here and in Mexico? It can only be\n\nseen by people over 18 in Mexico?\n\nAC: Well, here it’s a different discussion.\n\nIn Mexico we sued the government. The thing is, when they\n\nrated the film as adults only we had the right to ask for a definition\n\nof, first of all, who rated it, and then how they came to their\n\nconclusion. What we discovered is that the same bureaucrat has been\n\nin power for the last 25 years and anything that is made in film\n\nor television goes through the same institution called the RTC,\n\nRadio, Television and Cinematography.\n\nEverything goes through them for classification. The\n\ngovernment says that there is no censorship, but when you have classification\n\nby the government they are able to use it for political censorship.\n\nWe found that there is no clear definition of how films are classified;\n\nit’s arbitrary. So it violates a lot of constitutional rights for\n\nMexicans. We argued, for example, that it violates the rights of\n\nparents to educate their children. Our plea was: ‘Let the kids go\n\nif they are accompanied by their parents.’ And they said no. Because\n\nthe bureaucrat knows what’s best for your kids. It’s part of this\n\npatronizing system we’ve lived under for the last 71 years. So we\n\nsued the government and they punished us by sending inspectors to\n\nthe theaters and making people prove their age even if they were\n\nin their forties.\n\nMM: Did you try to cut the film at all?\n\nAC: I tried to do some cuts to get an R rating\n\nin the USA and IFC saw the film and said, ‘Don’t do it. You are\n\nbutchering the film.’ And I have to say the MPAA was really cool.\n\nThey saw that the film was not an exploitation film and said, ‘Hey,\n\nguys, we are who we are, the film is what it is.’ We started to\n\npresent cuts and even they said, ‘Don’t butcher the film.’\n\nMM: Do you think that with the success of\n\nfilms like Amores Perros and Y Tu Mama, we are going\n\nto see more output from Mexico?"
