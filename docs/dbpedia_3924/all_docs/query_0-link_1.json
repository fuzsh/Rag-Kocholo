        "text": "In this #DellTechWorld highlight, we dive into the transformative potential of AI with Michael Dell üí° ‚ÄúI think what's exciting about our industry is about every 10 years something comes along and it kind of redefines the opportunity for technology to have an impact in the world. It's right at the intersection of a lot of the things that we do,‚Äù shares Dell. ‚ÄúDell Technologies was made for this moment. We‚Äôre building the solutions, the #AIfactory, the compute, the storage, the networking, the memory, the services, the broad ecosystem from open and closed, and the professional services to make it all happen. And it's all happening right here at Dell Technologies World,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúWe're reinventing Dell and future-proofing Dell so we can be better, faster, stronger, and continue to serve our customers,‚Äù he concludes. üì∞ More: https://lnkd.in/gNQnngKb David Vellante Savannah Peterson\n\nShares of Dell Technologies (NYSE) soared to a record high on previous Friday, driven by a broader rally in companies focused on generative artificial intelligence applications. The surge in optimism for this transformative technology was fueled by strong quarterly results from AI heavyweight Nvidia (NASDAQ) earlier in the week. Key Points: ‚ñ™Ô∏èNew Opportunity for Dell: Analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research emphasized the significance of AI as a new and timely opportunity for Dell. The company's strategic focus on AI-driven solutions has resonated well with investors, leading to a notable surge in its stock price. ‚ñ™Ô∏èMarket Response: Dell shares surged by 6% to $162.82, reaching a record high and adding $6.6 billion to its market value. Despite paring some gains in the afternoon, Dell's stock has more than doubled year-to-date, reflecting strong investor confidence in the company's AI initiatives. üìå Stay informed and make data-driven investment decisions with FMP's Full Financial Statements As Reported API.

(DELL, NYSE) Top 25 Watchlist Dell's strategic focus on AI and on-premise solutions positions the company as a leader in the growing AI server market, projected to reach $150 billion by 2027. On March 1, DELL beat expectations in FY Q4 2024, highlighting opportunities in AI and server optimization, boosting the stock from 95 to 130. Since then, DELL has had a controlled pullback of roughly 20% to the 20-day trend. Depending on how it behaves over the next couple of days, this could be a decent entry point for those looking to add a leader in AI infrastructure.\n\nIt‚Äôs been just over three weeks since we wrapped up Dell Technologies World 2024, and I am still in awe. Not only did we deliver a spectacular AI edition, but we also established ourselves as infrastructure leaders in the AI space. What an achievement! I took some time to reflect and thought I would share my top 5 highlights: üí° AI Factory Unveiling: We introduced the Dell AI Factory- a one-stop shop that provides businesses with access to the broadest AI portfolio. From services to products (including devices, data centers, cloud solutions) and an open ecosystem, the Dell AI Factory empowers customers to achieve their AI use cases. üè¨ Ecosystem Tour-de-Force: Our strong culture of collaboration across our ecosystem partners shone throughout this event. Dell partners with other industry leaders at the forefront of AI and so it was a pleasure to hear from keynote speakers like Jensen Huang and Bill McDermott, who joined Michael Dell on stage, emphasizing our commitment to collaboration. üì¢ Insightful Trailblazers: From music to sports to space, our diverse lineup of speakers shared valuable insights on how AI is being used in their respective industries. Who knew how impactful AI would be in sports or music? Also, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson was a highlight, as always. ü§ì Geekfest Experiences: Whether it was breakout sessions or hands-on labs, or the immersive ‚Äòvillage‚Äô experience, our attendees explored cutting-edge technologies and engaged with Dell experts. Personally, I enjoyed spending time discussing AI business challenges with our customers and partners, highlighting how Dell can help accelerate their outcomes. üï∫ Fun Moments: Beyond the professional showcase, we had some fun! Catching up with friends and colleagues in person, laughing out loud to Jerry Seinfeld, and witnessing the Sphere light up with Dell- all added to the excitement of DTW. It took a village to execute such a successful event, and I am extremely grateful for a team that is innovative and spearheading the industry. Looking forward to Dell Technologies World 2025! üòä #IWork4Dell #AI #DellTechnologiesWorld"
