        "text": "A skilled advocate, Michael has extensive experience representing clients in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) proceedings, including arbitrations and mediations before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the American Arbitration Association, the International Center for Dispute Resolution, JAMS, the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution and other ADR forums. Although he more often represents defendants, Michael has also secured many judgments and settlements on behalf of plaintiffs.\n\nBenchmark Litigation, Chambers USA and Legal 500 United States have repeatedly recognized Michael as a leading litigator. Chambers has praised Michael for his broad litigation practice, including his experience and work in securities and accountants’ liability matters. Chambers notes that Michael handles “an impressive selection of internal investigations and representations before regulatory bodies both domestic and international” and that clients “offer enthusiastic evaluations.” For example, Michael is “a very smart and very capable lawyer,” “a real trial lawyer and very hard-working,” “an incredibly well-rounded lawyer” and “an extremely articulate and capable attorney who can understand complex matters quickly.” Michael “is very careful,” “really sees every angle” and “sees things that others often don’t.” Michael “has a great sense of the different elements of a case,” is “extremely organized and balanced in very complex matters that had a lot of nuances and tentacles,” and “has taken on cases that are often particularly challenging with unique sets of facts and novel legal issues. He is very good at digging into the details, but also at stepping back and grasping the bigger picture.”\n\nMichael is a “go-to guy” for “challenging enforcement matters with U.S. regulators” and a “solid choice for auditors and accounting firms in actions by the SEC and PCAOB, as well as equivalent foreign regulators in cross-border proceedings.” Michael is “an excellent practitioner who does outstanding work in audit defense.” He is “extremely hardworking and dedicated” and “a very good advocate and writer and a true subject matter expert.” Michael “is often involved in major regulatory matters as well as securities litigation, and represents leading clients in the accounting and financial services sectors.”\n\nChambers also observes: “Clients describe Michael as ‘thoughtful, sincere, patient, unflappable, consistent and completely responsive,’ adding that ‘[h]e is very much a team player and brings so much quality’ and that ‘[w]orking with him was an extremely positive experience due to his high professionalism, vast experience with regulators, and willingness to always provide timely responses.’” Michael is “the consummate professional: very calm and thoughtful and able to think ahead,” as well as “very collaborative, always available and very smart.” Michael is “very efficient,” has “an excellent grasp of the issues and the facts” and “brings a lot of value.”\n\nBenchmark Litigation reports that “at the trial and appellate level [Michael] earns resounding praise, with one peer stating, ‘Michael is a consummate pro, just into his work, not out there throwing bombs, just quietly doing a great job protecting his clients.’” Benchmark Litigation named him a Second Circuit Litigation Star in 2013.\n\nLegal 500 US lists Michael as a leading trial lawyer and has named him to its Hall of Fame in Securities Litigation and General Commercial Disputes, explaining that clients report he is “really outstanding,” he “has delivered exceptional service,” he is “always available,” he submits “cogent and erudite legal briefs,” and he “is easily among the small handful of our ‘go-to’ attorneys to address the most significant legal issues facing our industry.” Michael “does ‘consistently high-quality work and does a really good job developing consensus in a case,’” he “is noted for his ability to ‘anticipate how the other side will react,’” he is “client-oriented and highly experienced,” he is “very knowledgeable, thorough, experienced and approachable,” and he is an “‘extremely effective litigator’ who is praised for his ‘excellent judgment’ and for ‘combining excellent legal advice with a great deal of industry knowledge.’”"
