        "text": "Close your eyes, picture a packed Darrell K. Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium on a November night. The pocket breaks down and Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers sees green grass. The crowd roars as Ewers sprints past the 30, the 20, the Tesla logo, the 10 - touchdown! He pounds his chest - just below the Oracle emblem - and raises a finger to the sky.\n\nNow that power conference schools will pay athletes directly through revenue sharing in starting in fall 2025, schools are seeking new revenue streams to offset that cost. Ross Dellenger of Yahoo! Sports reported one option on the table as of Wednesday: corporate on-field logos and jersey patches.\n\nThe corporatization of college sports is almost here. Here are the picks for the best logo for each Texas team to don.\n\nBaylor – Magnolia Homes\n\nChip and Joanna Gaines have fixed up Waco houses on HGTV since 2013. How about sprucing up those new Baylor uniforms with their sleek logo come 2025? McLane Stadium has the foundation, but the interior decorater sees a couple spots between the 40 and 30-yard lines to add a Magnolia logo to give it a nice, open feel!\n\nHouston – Gallery Furniture\n\nJim McIngvale, a.k.a. \"Mattress Mack\", is known for placing gargantuan sports wagers, but slapping his Gallery Furniture logo on those Luv Ya Blue uniforms is the safest bet to make. Houston's administration can sleep soundly knowing Mattress Mack is in their backyard.\n\nNorth Texas – WinStar\n\nHead coach Eric Morris is a gambling play caller, so a logo from the world's biggest casino is only fitting. Casinos aren't allowed in the Lone Star State, but North Texas is only a 40 minute drive from WinStar. I can already see the Mean Green money signs.\n\nRice – NASA\n\nHouston, we have a problem stitching all our logos on these jerseys. Not only is Rice less than 15 miles away from the Johnson Space Center, their football players also have the best chance to work at NASA with their academics.\n\nSam Houston – Walmart\n\nWalmart is the largest non-state employer in Huntsville, Texas, and the spot for all the Sam Houston student population's essentials.\n\nSMU – Comerica Bank\n\nIf SMU is truly Dallas's team, it's only right to have a financial institution sponsoring them. Comerica CEO Curtis Farmer is even on the Cox School of Business Executive Board. Plus, SMU boosters spent plenty of time at the bank to contribute $100 million in the week after joining the ACC.\n\nTexas A&M – John Deere\n\nLet Mike Elko take you for a ride on his big green tractor. The state's Agriculture and Mechanical college is the perfect choice to rep a John Deere logo.\n\nTexas – Dell\n\nWhat starts in Michael Dell's freshman dorm room changes the world. Dell dropped out of pre-med at the University of Texas to sell computers full-time with $1,000 to his name. Now he's a billionaire with more than enough money to advertise at his alma mater - uh, former school.\n\nTexas State – McCoy's\n\nGJ Kinne is building a program at Texas State, so look no further than McCoy's building supply for a sponsor. With headquarters in San Marcos, McCoy's has expanded to 85 retail stores.\n\nTexas Tech – Allsup's\n\nCan I get a beef and bean burrito and some Red Raider football? Allsups and Texas Tech go way back - the company's first concept convenience store (without gas) opened in 2022 across from the University.\n\nTCU – Stetson\n\nNothing says Fort Worth like a Stetson Cowboy hat. If Dallas is the corporate club scene, It's western neighbor is all stockyards and rodeos. Over half of TCU's student body hails from out of state - you bet they got some Stetson western wear at high school graduation.\n\nUTEP – Lucchese\n\nScotty Walden's pulled himself up by the Lucchese bootstraps to turn UTEP into a contender. Not only does this sponsorship fit the workman-like mentality in El Paso, Lucchese's headquarters are in the Sun City.\n\nUTSA – H-E-B\n\nNo ifs, ands or Howard E. Butts, an H-E-B patch would be a great add to those UTSA unis. San Antonio has the most H-E-B stores (48) of any city in Texas."
