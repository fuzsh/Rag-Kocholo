        "text": "[Heungbu-46] [Founders 40] Michael Dell.\n\nA genius businessman who won the title of the youngest richest man.\n\nA boy who made $2,000 by selling rare stamps at the age of 12 and then started a newspaper subscription business at the age of 18, earning $18,000. A genius entrepreneur who went to medical school as his family wanted, but dropped out and started a business at the age of 19 before he was even in his 20s.\n\nThis story, which seems to come out of a drama, is an episode of a real person. Today, Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Computer, who became the youngest 500 richest people in the world at 27 and became a billionaire at 31 is the star of \"The Founder Remaining Brand.\"\n\nDue to the artificial intelligence (AI) craze that has not been extinguished this year, many companies are listed as AI beneficiaries. Several big tech companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, have been classified as related stocks, and the stock price has continued to rise. In particular, there are a number of companies whose stock prices are soaring as long as they are related to Nvidia, which dominates the AI semiconductor chip market.\n\nSupermicro, a computer server manufacturer using Nvidia chips, is a representative example. The stock price, which had soared day after day, eventually was newly incorporated into the S&P 500 index. The traditional stronghold of the computer server market dedicated to Super Micro is today's protagonist, Dell.\n\nNvidia and Dell have similarities other than what they have in common as AI beneficiaries. Similar to Nvidia's production of graphics-specialized semiconductor chips and now loved as artificial intelligence chips, Dell has also grown its business by selling PCs, but recently the artificial intelligence-related business sector is growing significantly. The ability to respond quickly and adapt to changes in market needs and trends in the rapidly changing IT industry ecosystem is really the power of a long-running company.\n\nBorn to be a businessman...the birth of a teenage businessman\n\nUnlike most of the founders who remained brands were around the 20th century who founded global brands, Michael Dell is still active. Michael Saul Dell was born in Houston, southern Texas, in 1965, the son of a Jewish family. His father, Alexander Dell, was a dentist specializing in orthodontics and his mother worked as a stockbroker.\n\nHe was born with Jewish genes for business and money, and his mother, who worked in the financial market, had no choice but to take an interest in money and business from an early age. When we were young, eating with our family and asking for toys, Michael Dell's family discussed how the U.S. Fed's interest rate policy would affect markets and what are the trends in industries that will change the world. It's already started two or three steps ahead of others from the beginning.\n\nIn fact, this entrepreneurial instinct is often seen by global entrepreneurs. Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, and Elon Musk of Tesla are famous for their competitiveness since they were teenagers to sell things or make money.\n\nMichael Dell has also demonstrated his entrepreneurial instincts since he was a teenager. In the 1970s and 1980s, when he was a teenager, there were many people collecting stamps unlike today. Stamps commemorating special events or very old and rare stamps were very valuable. When Michael Dell learned this from his father's friend, he started collecting these stamps one by one.\n\nKnowing that brokers who buy and sell stamps in particular collect large fees instead of arranging them, Michael Dell opted to skip this process and visit buyers himself and sell stamps at a price minus fees. That's a lot of money for a 12-year-old kid, which is a little bit more than $2,000.\n\nMichael Dell's other interest as a teenager was in electronic devices. He first bought a calculator when he was seven years old, and when he was in middle school, he even tried using a telephone typewriter terminal in his early days. Now is the time when there's nothing you can't do with just a smartphone, but back then, many electronic devices were expensive items. Fortunately, Michael Dell, who grew up in a wealthy family, even bought his first computer, Apple 2, at the age of 15.\n\nAs soon as he bought the Apple 2 computer, he disassembled all the expensive items and carefully examined what was inside and how it was designed. And I wouldn't have known at the time. The fact that the experience of completely breaking down Apple 2 would completely change his life.\n\nSell directly to consumers...Dell Made Direct Models\n\nMichael Dell, a teenage businessman, comes across a marketing ad posted in the Houston Post, a local newspaper, in 1983. If you get regular subscribers, you'll pay a marketing fee in proportion to the number of subscribers. Most people call randomly or visit family homes and offer subscriptions, but Michael Dell has business savvy again here. It is a strategy to secure information on new people who have recently moved to this area and focus on it.\n\nHe first strategizes to secure court records that can confirm information on newly-purchased newlyweds and others. I hired someone who could verify this, paid for it, and got new homebuyer information.\n\nMichael Dell sent these families a direct letter of subscription solicitation, and this strategy was effective, making as much as $18,000 in a year. This was more than the annual salary of the teacher at his school at the time. Michael Dell has hired several employees himself and makes quite a lot of money and secures initial funding to start a business.\n\nDell's \"Direct Model,\" which is based on direct sales and advertising tailored to your needs without going through an intermediate process, starts with this experience.\n\nDel, who dropped out of medicine, opened his eyes to business.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Michael Dell goes to the University of Texas pre-med as his parents wish. Michael Dell, who has become a college freshman, demonstrates an entrepreneurial temperament unlike ordinary children who enjoy their college freshmen. Just as Mark Zuckerberg made Facebook in his university dorm, Michael Dell started an informal business in room 2713 of Dobie Center, a dormitory in the school, that collects and sells parts kits for upgrading personal computers.\n\nAt the request of acquaintances around us, the computers that Dell assembled or upgraded were 20% cheaper than those of large companies that use the same parts and perform the same. Naturally, this has gone viral, and Dell plans to extend it to a business model altogether.\n\nIn particular, he opened his eyes to the power of direct marketing strategies that allow him to sell more products at a lower price if he saves the cost of selling commissions for wholesalers in between. And I decided to use this strategy to jump into the assembly computer market.\n\nJust as fish caught in the sea or canned potatoes in the fields go through several distribution processes and prices skyrocket, the company wanted to dramatically reduce the distribution costs accumulated in the process of assembling computers one by one and selling them to customers.\n\nIn January 1984, when he was 19 years old, Michael Dell founded a company called PC's Limited and began assembling his own computers and selling them to customers. And in the meantime, he drops out of college. Continuing my studies in business was rather an obstacle.\n\nMichael Dell introduced the strategy of assembling a PC only after the customer ordered it. While the existing PC sales method was that if the company selected and assembled each part, and released a finished PC, customers had to buy a product that they liked among them. In Dell's company, when the customer selects each part himself, Dell assembles it accordingly, optimizes it, and sends it. Michael Dell's sales method is the originator of customized customization systems commonly used in Yongsan Electronics Market and online PC companies.\n\nIs Tesla's Innovation Sales Strategy Helped by Dell?\n\nIn that sense, Michael Dell was the originator of sales innovation that broke the stereotype of buying cars that Tesla touched, tested, and then contracted at branches.\n\nDell's fresh sales strategy worked as expected, and in May of the same year, Dell renamed itself Dell computers and began selling PCs in earnest. Dell continued to hire staff to take phone orders, and three assembly workers on a square table repeatedly mounted parts one by one and completed the computer on the order sheet throughout the day.\n\nSince then, the business has flourished day by day, and in 1988, Dell Computer became a star in the business world when it went public on the Nasdaq. Since then, he has been named the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company at the age of 27, and became a billionaire at the age of 31, making his name as a star CEO in the 1990s.\n\nI followed my luck. With the introduction of the Internet in earnest in the late 1990s, a new ordering method called online ordering was introduced. Since then, Dell computers have accelerated their success, and in the first quarter of 2001, Dell has surpassed Compaq to become the world's largest market share (12.8%).\n\nDell left at the time of clapping, comeback to overcome the crisis\n\nMichael Dell stepped down as CEO in March 2004. He left when he clapped. But once he leaves, Dell's crisis begins immediately. Since 2005, market share has gradually declined, and there has been a growing sense of crisis that PC market growth has stopped. And since the 2000s, the transition from the desktop era to the laptop era has been in full swing, and the response has been insufficient.\n\nEventually, he returned to CEO in 2007 after three years, but the crisis still continued. Cheap prices in Asian markets such as China and Taiwan have penetrated the gaps in the computer and laptop markets, and Dell has not been able to respond quickly to these market changes.\n\nAlso, Apple's new iPhone was an innovative event that heralded the end of the computer era with the opening of the smartphone era.\n\nIn 2013, he eventually makes a decision. The intention was to delist the company directly after 25 years of listing and convert it into a private company. The reason was that excessive interest and interference from external capital and individual investors made it difficult to change or innovate the constitution of the company. It's similar to Elon Musk, who bought Twater, changed the company's name to X after switching to an unlisted company, saying it would completely fix the company.\n\nDrastic delisting, making way for business diversification\n\nAfter delisting, Dell intends to move from an existing computer manufacturing and sales company to an IT solution company. Dell will acquire EMC, which owns VMware, a cloud-based software company, for $67 billion in 2016. At that time, it was the largest IT merger and acquisition ever. Dell determined that getting a larger business, enterprise-level customer was paramount and made a huge investment in the cloud business, which was called the future industry.\n\nIn addition, we have acquired companies in various fields such as storage, network equipment, and servers and expanded our business areas. Dell also changed its name to \"Dell Technology\" and emphasized the image of a comprehensive IT solution company rather than a PC vendor. I instinctively realized that if I simply stayed in PC sales, I would not be able to survive in a rapidly changing market.\n\nAfter eventually relisting in 2018, Dell became a completely different comprehensive IT solution company than it was five years ago. And the foresight of business diversification, which was far ahead at the time, opened the door for the AI era and brought Dell a spectacular return.\n\nThe bold transition to an unlisted company, the decision to invest tens of billions of dollars in new businesses, and the path that natural-born businessman Michael Dell is taking are still ongoing.\n\n\"Heung\" Interesting \"Boo\" - Land \"Jeon\" (傳).
