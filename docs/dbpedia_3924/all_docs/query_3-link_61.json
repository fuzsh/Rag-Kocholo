        "text": "About Michael Dell\n\nMichael Dell is chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, which formed in 2016 via Dell's $60 billion merger with computer storage giant EMC.\n\nIn late 2018 Dell Technologies returned to public markets through a complicated financial restructuring.\n\nDell's cloud software arm, VMware, spun off in 2021; Microchip firm Broadcom bought it in 2023 for $69 billion, 39% of which went to Dell.\n\nMuch of Dell's fortune lies in his private investment firm DFO Management, which has stakes in hotels and invests in liquid corporate credit.\n\nIn 2023, Dell gifted over $3 billion worth of cash stock to his foundation, which focuses on child poverty, and his donor-advised fund."
