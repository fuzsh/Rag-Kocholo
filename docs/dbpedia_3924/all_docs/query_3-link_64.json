        "text": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dell\n\nMichael Saul Dell (born February 23, 1965) is an American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, and author. He is the founder and CEO of Dell Inc., one of the world’s leading sellers of personal computers (PCs). He was ranked the 41st richest person in the world on 2012 Forbes list of billionaires, with a net worth of US$22.4 billion as of December 2014.\n\nIn 2011, his 243.35 million shares of Dell stock were worth $3.5 billion, giving him 12% ownership of the company. His remaining wealth of roughly $10 billion is invested in other companies and is managed by a firm whose name, MSD Capital, incorporates Dell's initials. On January 5, 2013 it was announced that Michael Dell had bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout since the Great Recession. Dell Inc. officially went private on October 29, 2013.\n\nMichael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal (\"valley\" or \"dale [q.v.]\"; modern common-noun spelling Tal) upon the family's immigration to the United States. The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker, and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell attended Herod Elementary School in Houston. In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.\n\nDell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked. Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence; he then targeted this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.\n\nWhile a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.\n\nIn January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as \"PC's Limited\". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as \"Dell Computer Corporation\" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff \"consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables\". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.\n\nIn 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine's list of the top 500 corporations. In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com. In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.\n\nIn 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations. On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.\n\nIn July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each, former CFO James Schneider to pay $3 million to settle the charges.\n\nAccolades for Dell include \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" (at age 24) from Inc. magazine; \"Top CEO in American Business\" from Worth magazine; \"CEO of the Year\" from Financial World, Industry Week and Chief Executive magazines. Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.\n\nDell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council, and the governing board of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, India. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.\n\nDell's 1999 book, Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry, is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.\n\nForbes estimates Dell's net worth at $19.5 billion. Dell married Lieberman on October 28, 1989 in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.\n\nIn 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. The foundation has provided $65 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute, and the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.\n\nBy 2010, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa Today the foundation has over $466 million assets under management.\n\nIn 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.\n\nIn 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School will begin enrolling students in 2016.\n\nIn 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nIn the April 2011 issue of Mother Jones, a timeline of Michael Dell's life is detailed in \"American Magnate: Michael Dell: How a homegrown geek outsourced, downsized, and tax-breaked his way to the top.\" The article juxtaposes Dell's spending on luxurious homes and private jet travel with his pursuit of tax breaks and tax holidays and Dell Computer's eventual offshoring of jobs overseas after receiving the incentives for setting up shop locally.\n\nמייקל סול דל\n\n''''''(באנגלית: Michael Saul Dell; נולד ב-23 בפברואר 1965), הוא יזם יהודי-אמריקאי, מייסד חברת המחשבים DELL ומנכ\"ל החברה. הונו מוערך בכ-23 מיליארד דולר (2017)[1].\n\nתוכן עניינים 1 ילדותו 2 צמיחת החברה 3 תרומות חשובות 4 קישורים חיצוניים 5 הערות שוליים ילדותו דל נולד ביוסטון, טקסס שבארצות הברית למשפחה יהודית שאת שם משפחתה המקורי \"טל\" (מגרמנית/יידיש: עמק) אינגלזה לזה הנוכחי עם הגעתה לאמריקה. הוא התחיל למד בבית ספר יסודי הרוד. כבר בגיל 12 הרוויח 1,000 דולר ממכירת בולים. לאחר מכן המשיך לבית הספר התיכון ממוריאל.\n\nבגיל 16, במהלך חופשת הקיץ עבד כמשווק מנויים לעיתון \"יוסטון פוסט\", משגילה שרוב הלקוחות הם זוגות צעירים השיג רשימת זוגות שנישאו והציע להם, בהצלחה מרובה, מנוי לעיתון, כך הרוויח במהלך חופשת הקיץ 18,000 דולר.\n\nאחרי סיום הלימודים העל יסודיים, עבר לאוניברסיטת טקסס באוסטין על מנת ללמוד פיזיקה. הוא לא התעניין במקצוע ובגיל 18 ייסד חברה חדשה ששמה PC's Limited,. דל מכר והרכיב, בהתחלה מחדרו שבמעונות, רכיבי שדרוג למחשבים אישיים.\n\nצמיחת החברה במהלך רכישת והרכבת רכיבי המחשב גילה דל כי יש פער גדול בין עלות הרכיבים לבין מחירו של מחשב מורכב. על מנת לנצל פער זה החליט להרכיב ולשווק מחשבים אישיים ללקוחות סופיים. בסיוע הלוואה כספית מסבו ומסבתו, עזב דל את הלימודים כשהיה בן 19 וניהל את דל מחשבים. עם הזמן, היו לו כמה כישלונות (בנוסף למחשבים ניידים שנשרפו ב-1993, אובדן לקוחות לחברת GateWay בתחילת 1990 וכישלונות אחרים), למרות משברים אלו המשיכה דל לייצר מחשבים נייחים וניידים, כיום היא חברת המחשבים השנייה בעולם, עם מכירות של 57 מיליארד דולר בשנת 2007.\n\nבארבעה במרץ 2003, לאחר שהחברה התפתחה לתחומים נוספים מעבר למחשוב, הצביעו רוב מחזיקי המניות לשנות את שם החברה לדל (Dell, Inc) במקום השם הקודם, דל תאגיד מחשוב.
