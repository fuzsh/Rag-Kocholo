Many students study biochemistry because they are curious about how certain medicines and therapies are created.\n\nFinance\n\nNo matter which majors we discuss in this list, it would be pointless if students leave out business, economic, and finance majors, who, after all, deal with and learn about how to increase their income exponentially.\n\nMarketing\n\nWhen people believe that one type of marketing and advertising has run its course, a new one emerges superior to the previous one. Marketing students create a modern form of art, the art of good sales.\n\nMBA (Master of Business Administration)\n\nStudents that can complete an MBA will earn 50% more than those with only an undergraduate degree.
