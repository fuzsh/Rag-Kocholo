        "text": "He transformed the way people buy computers with a radical online- based delivery model. But can Michael Dell stay ahead of the chasing pack as the PC market matures and prices and profits dip?\n\nThe year: 1983. The place: the University of Texas, Austin. The student: 18-year-old freshman Michael Saul Dell. His passion: computers. Within nine years, Michael – still only a precocious 27– would become the youngest ever CEO of a Fortune 500 company.\n\nThe remarkable story of Michael Dell begins in Houston, Texas, where he was born on February 23, 1965. His father was an American businessman, his mother a home-maker. Michael began building his computer company from his university dorm room. He often took a number of precautionary measures – for example, hiding his newly built computers in a bathtub – to make sure that no one cottoned on to his extracurricular activities. The business that grew from the tiny dorm room eventually became known as Dell Computer Corporation and later Dell Inc. The firm was to rapidly become the most profitable PC manufacturing enterprise in the world. With a net worth of $16 billion, according to Forbes magazine, Michael is today the world’s 18th richest person. His company’s annual sales exceeded $ 49 billion in 2005 and it has a net market capitalization of over $ 77 billion.\n\nBut it all began with a set of extraordinary ideas that morphed into an extraordinary global enterprise. Michael used to spend his evenings and weekends in college pre-formatting hard disks. As he watched the emergence of open architecture technology in the early- 1980s, he quickly perceived that it would be the technology of the future. In 1984, at age 19, he registered his company and called it PC’s Limited.\n\nIBM had revolutionized the PC industry in the early-1980s by adopting open architecture as opposed to the proprietary architecture of Apple and Sun at the time. Open architecture machines ran on standard operating systems provided by Microsoft and processors provided by Intel. The ready availability of components like processors, hard disks, RAM drives and peripherals provided an opportunity for any player to enter the market.\n\nAs the decade unfolded, the demand for computers burgeoned. Organizations were rapidly auto- mating their business processes to boost productivity. As computers proliferated, business users became more discerning and many wanted unique features customized to their specific needs. Traditionally, in the mid-1980s manufacturers built computers and distributed them to resellers and dealers who sold them to businesses and individual consumers.\n\nApple and IBM sold their products through computer dealers because they needed the leverage to gain nationwide sales. When IBM introduced the original IBM PC, even though IBM had the most sophisticated field sales organization in the world, it chose to sell its PCs through retail. With the biggest players at that time all selling through resellers, everyone believed that the in- direct channel was simply the way to go.\n\nBut the indirect channel was based on a marriage of the unknown buyer and uniformed seller. So Dell started his business with a simple question: how could he make the process of buying a computer better? The answer lay in selling computers directly to the end-customer. Michael recognized that the customized approach demanded by clients was an opportunity to provide build-to-order solutions to companies using direct distribution. Eliminating middlemen and passing the saving on to the end- customer was the basis of Michael’s direct-sell model. And from his experience as a user, he knew that the direct-sell model would make customers more knowledgeable and demanding with each passing year.\n\nWhile other companies had to guess which products their customers wanted, because they built them in advance of taking the order, Dell knew its customers’ demands before it built the product. While other companies had to estimate which configurations were the most popular, Dell knew this based upon whether its customers ordered one floppy drive or two, or one floppy drive and a hard drive. The company would build the product to meet their exact needs. That was the critical different-iator a strategy whose brilliance lay in its simplicity.\n\nThere’s a real productivity advantage in the direct model because of the way the sales cycle works. In the indirect model, there are two sales forces: sales from the manufacturer to the dealer and sales from the dealer to the customer. In the direct model, there is only one sales force and it’s totally focused on the customer. It all revolves around the basic idea of eliminating the middleman.\n\nWrote Michael in his autobiography, Direct From Dell : “Since an early age, I have been fascinated with the idea of eliminating unnecessary steps. So I guess it’s not surprising that I started a company based on eliminating middlemen. Dell sells computers directly to our customers, deals directly with our suppliers and communicates directly with the customers, all without the unnecessary and inefficient presence of intermediaries. We call this ‘the direct model,’ and it has taken us, to use a common phrase – direct-to- the-top.”\n\nTHE INITIAL SPARK\n\nIn January 1984 freshman Michael went back to university in Austin earlier than he would have needed to in order to attend classes after the Christmas break. He used the extra time to do all the things he needed to set up a business. He registered his new PC company. He placed an advertisement in the classified section of a local newspaper. Michael soon started getting a lot of business. He was selling $50,000 to $80,000 worth of upgraded PCs a month as well as upgrade kits, and add-on components, to people in the Austin area. He was soon able to move from his stuffy dorm room that he shared with a roommate to a condominium with high ceilings and two bedrooms.\n\nIn early-May 1984, 19-year-old Michael put together the $ 1,000 he required to capitalize the company in Texas. That was the full extent of his start-up investment. He then moved his business from his condo to a 1,000 square-foot office in a small business center in North Austin. Michael hired a few people to take orders over the telephone and a few more people to fulfill them. Manufacturing consisted of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables upgrading machines. Business continued to grow and Michael began to think hard about what the potential could be if he could devote himself to the venture full-time.\n\nYoung Dell had to do some deft tightrope walking. To devote himself to business full-time meant not going to college, which was not an acceptable option. Convincing his parents to let him leave school would of course have been impossible. So he just went ahead and dropped out after completing his freshman year, ignoring the consequences.\n\nBy 1985, the computer industry had already become so intensely competitive that companies had to keep innovating to survive. Constantly questioning conventional thinking became part of Dell’s thought paradigm. There were times when the company was so tight on space that two people had to share one small cubicle. Engineers would help out when the manufacturing line got overloaded. Everyone pitched in and answered phones when phone systems got backed up. Sales people would stuff RAM (random access memory) chips into tubes to ship to customers even while they were taking more orders on the phone.\n\nOrder procurement, fulfillment and delivery were the key procedures that had to be put in place to provide customized solutions to clients. Dell received its orders directly through mail, or through incoming phone calls or through orders placed by “inside sales reps” who handled large accounts. This method allowed Dell to gain a higher average revenue per unit. All orders received were broken down into a specification sheet containing a list of parts required for the computer. A bar code linked the specification sheet to the order number and allowed customers to check on order status. It also helped in troubleshooting later. Based on the spec sheets workers would pull components from stock and place them in a bin which was forwarded to the “5 persons production cells” for the assembly of the machines. This increased the capacity of the factory to handle orders. Once the machine was configured, it was sent to the software zone. The system was then tested for 4-8 hours and sent to packaging where all the requisite peripherals were added.\n\nShipping was contracted out with multiple shippers delivering the systems anywhere in North America or South America. Technical support was available to customers through telephone. This allowed Dell to troubleshoot almost 75 per cent of the problems without having to dispatch field staff to the customer. The technical field staff was outsourced though Unisys, Wang Techtronics and IBM Global Services. The cost of servicing a customer on the phone was $ 14-18 compared to $ 250-300 for field visits, making Dell’s operating costs the lowest in the industry.\n\nGETTING PROFESSIONAL\n\nIn 1986 Michael hit a milestone when he hired Lee Walker as president. Lee, a venture capitalist who had also been an executive at a couple of other companies, was the first key management recruit in the company’s history. At that time Dell Computer Corporation was growing at tremendous speed and was voraciously sucking in money. One of the first things Lee did was use his networking skills. He called up Texas Commerce Bank and asked for a loan. Within eighteen hours Dell had a decent line of credit. So while an innovative delivery mechanism drove Dell’s early growth, organizational consolidation was now critical to sustaining and scaling up that growth.\n\nThe build-to-order model had been an instant hit with customers and allowed Dell to ride this success wave for a decade. Dell had avoided the retail channel so far, but decided to use it to expand into the consumer segment in 1992. However, when it did enter the consumer segment, it faced an operating loss for the first time because the 15 percent gross margin required by Dell’s appointed retailers, CompUSA and Sam’s Club, left Dell with a five per cent net loss. Dell also ran into problems with its laptops because the supply and quality of components for laptops had not reached the levels of robustness and stability to suit Dell’s build-to-order model. Setbacks are part and parcel of a new endeavor. You fail only if you do not respond to setbacks. Dell responded to its setbacks by exiting the retail channel and the laptops market.\n\nIn the mid-1990s the demand for PCs surged with the advent of the Internet. Dell made the most of it by sticking to its build-to-order model, which allowed it to significantly lower operating costs and offer very attractive prices to customers. In 1995 Dell added an online order placement facility for more discerning customers. The online store guided customers through the configuration of systems in the same manner as phone sales reps did. Premier pages were accessible to select customers and allowed for paperless purchase orders, pricing, discounts, real-time order tracking and purchase history. Each of Dell’s suppliers also had access to an Intranet portal where they could view the order flows and inventory of components thus enabling them to do their own planning more efficiently.\n\nMichael also brought in Topfer from Motorola and Kevin Rollins from Bain & Co in the mid-1990s to join Dell in an effort to broaden the company’s leadership. Towards the end of the century, the hyper- expansionary phase of the PC industry was over. But Michael and his team members’ urge to compete didn’t falter. They believed that they could perform better in a tough environment. Critics pointed out that PCs were becoming commodities, and Dell would have to adjust its expectations downwards. The management, even in the face of such pessimism, reasoned that Dell’s low-cost direct sales model would apply to the commodity nature of the PC business as well and they were proved right.\n\nDell entered the twenty-first century as the most successful company in the PC industry. It had passed $1 billion in sales in 1992, $10 billion in 1997, and hit $25 billion in 2000. Dell’s revenues and earnings were growing by over 30 per cent year after year, and the company reported a return on invested capital of 243 per cent for 2000. The PC industry juggernaut continued to grow through 2000. As PC demand climbed to over 30 per cent a year, PC companies were left scrambling to keep up. At Dell new product groups and customer segments were formed to manage exploding opportunities, and new employees were hired in record numbers. And then suddenly, in the fourth quarter of 2000, growth came to a screeching halt. Rather than managing a market growing at 30 per cent, for the first time in the PC industry’s history growth actually declined by a whopping 10 per cent. Industry analysts were unsure whether this was an aberration or a harbinger of things to come.\n\nThe PC industry’s hyper-growth in 1999 and 2000 had been driven by several factors. Primary among these was the enormous business investment in technology infrastructure to prepare for Y2K. The explosion of the Internet was also a boon to tech companies. Not only were there thousands of new companies that needed a technology platform to get up and running, but the competition from dotcoms spurred bricks and mortar companies to invest in Internet infrastructure as well. Finally, there was the flood of service providers that came into existence in order to service the technology needs of Internet companies. Perhaps the best barometer of all this heightened demand for technology infrastructure was the NASDAQ stock index, which rose from 1835 in March 1998 to a high of 5132 in March 2000. And then the bubble burst. NASDAQ plummeted to a low of 1619 in April 2001.\n\nTHE MELTDOWN – AND THE LESSONS\n\nDell along with its rivals saw a slump in stock price and market capitalization. As the market cooled, Dell, a company that had hired 16,000 people over the previous two years, announced its first ever reduction in workforce. This was in spite of Dell’s record $32 billion revenue in fiscal 2001 and a new high on return on invested capital of 355 per cent. Dell responded to an early sign of a potential slowdown as it had done many times before – by aggressively moving on price. That was always its key differentiator and Dell needed to slog it to survive the meltdown. Dell Co-President Kevin. B. Rollins insisted that Dell could continue its aggressive pricing and remain profitable. He believed that Dell was the lowest-cost producer and it could do better than its competitors in a tough environment.\n\nSays Michael: “People have often told us that what we wanted to do couldn’t be done. Our success is due, in part, to not just ability, but also a willingness to look at things differently. I believe opportunity is part instinct and part immersion – in an industry, a subject, or an area of expertise. Dell is proof that people can learn to recognize and take advantage of opportunities that others are convinced don’t exist. You don’t have to be a genius, or a visionary, or even a college graduate to think unconventionally. You just need a framework and a dream.”\n\nHe adds: “Ever since Dell became a serious contender for market share in the computer industry, people have asked how we deal with competition. The short answer is: when you’ve got only single-digit market share – and you’re competing with the big boys – you either differentiate or die.”\n\nIn late-2000, Dell began to aggressively explore new growth avenues. It decided on a multi- pronged strategy involving multiple product lines and higher geographic expansion. Dell was always trying to identify high-margin new technology products that it would include in its portfolio driven by the direct model. Dell responded to the changes in the industry by getting into higher-end segments like servers and storage devices. These devices were difficult to configure using the phone order and specification sheet procedure that Dell used for PCs. Still, Dell had perfected the technique so well that it was able to apply it to complex solutions as well and soon became a leading low-cost provider in these segments. Dell also mitigated the risk by forming Controlled Deployment Teams (CDT), which gave it in- house service capabilities to install complex solutions at customer sites.\n\nIn spite of the PC industry slowdown and Dell’s significantly reduced growth targets for 2001- 2002, the company’s top manage- ment remained supremely confident of Dell’s future success. Some in the industry however believed that now that the hyper-expansionary phase of the industry’s growth was over, PC players would have to adjust their strategies to reflect the commodity nature of the new environment. However, such pessimism did not faze Dell in the least.\n\nIn 1999 Dell had overtaken Compaq to become the largest seller of personal computers in the United States. In 2002, Dell lost this position to Hewlett-Packard when HP acquired Compaq. In 2003, Dell – now renamed Dell Inc. – again regained the lead. In 2004 and 2005 Dell attempted to expand its business by tapping into the multimedia and home entertainment markets with the introduction of Dell TVs, Dell Handhelds, and Dell Digital Jukeboxes. Dell also produced Dell- brand home and small office printers to diversify its basket of products and manage risk in an increasingly uncertain environment.\n\nTo further mitigate risk from a stagnating US PC market, Dell rolled out its direct sales model in all the major international markets and achieved rapid growth in market- share in most. Its share of sales from international markets increased for the first two quarters of fiscal 2005. However, all was not well at Dell Inc. It received criticism for the large amount of software included on its system: some users regarded a great deal of it as spyware. Other customers accused the company of using cheap and unreliable parts. Consumer groups also criticized Dell for treating consumers unfairly. For example, they accused its service centers of helping business customers faster than individual customers. Customer service critics targeted Dell’s outsourcing practices, specifically involving India, claiming they contribute to communication pro- blems between the company and its customers.\n\nDell Inc. also received serious criticism from the Internet community for not offering AMD-based systems and selling faulty hardware. Most common complaints related to hard-drive failures, with repeated occurrences even after sending the computer/hard drive in for repair, failing to facilitate upgrading hardware, and the generic monopoly complaints from the Internet/Build-Your-Own communities. Dell was also accused of using proprietary parts, resulting in certain components like the power supply and motherboard not fitting or not working at all, and sometimes frying the system as users installed different non-proprietary parts. In 2005, two class action lawsuits accused Dell of marketing with bait and switch tactics and of conspiring with its financial unit to offer zero per cent financing, only to revoke the offer after the return period had expired.\n\nManaging risk involves adopting to new circumstances. Dell did not change enough to combat the IT slowdown of 2001-2002. It lost ground to nimbler competitors, including IBM and the HP-Compaq combine. Dell currently ships Windows XP as the operating systems (OS) of choice for most of its new computers, but it also offers Red Hat and SuSE for servers and has started to offer its Latitude series laptops with Mandriva Linux pre-installed. This option, already available in Europe, becomes available in the US by end-2005. Dell plans to extend the Mandriva Linux option to its Inspiron series as well as to desktops. Dell has also sought to offer “bare-bones” computers without any pre-installed software at significantly lower prices. Due to Dell’s licensing contracts with Microsoft, customers can obtain such systems only upon request and Dell has to ship them with a free DOS disk included in the box and issue a so-called Windows refund or a merchandise credit after sales of the systems at the regular retail price.\n\nTo diversify and mitigate risk, Dell has expanded into noncomputer products and outsources most of its technical support work to the $2 billion Indian company Infosys Technologies, which also handles outsourced work from other multinationals. Dell International Services functions as a support division of Dell. In 2004, in an effort to improve support, Dell opened a pilot project of Dell- owned/operated technical sup- port operating out of Edmonton, Alberta. Supporting both Dell and non-Dell hardware and software, this Canadian site has quickly begun taking over from other outsourced call centers.\n\nHOW DELL CAME BACK\n\nBack on track after a slump, Dell made a net profit of $3.32 billion on revenues of $49.2 billion in its financial year ending January 28, 2005. These figures represent 26 per cent and 19 per cent growth respectively over the previous accounting year.\n\nThe story of Dell Inc. has been marked by rapid growth and rapid change. The company was faced with challenges that could have threatened its very existence. From forays into retail to under- and over- developed product lines, Dell learned some hard lessons along the way and emerged stronger as a result. The resulting strategies – unrivalled speed to market, direct-to-user sales, superior customer service, and a fierce commitment to producing consistently high-quality, low-cost custom-made systems – have made Dell, Inc. the largest- selling computer vendor in the world.\n\nAnd to think it all started in a university dorm room with a 19-year-old guy formatting hard discs. And Dell’s products reflect that: they are unfussy, depend- able, cheap and easy to fix. But what about the future? Can Dell survive the crunching competition from Asian PC makers? Remarks The Economist: “Dell’s worldwide marketshare of around 19 per cent means there is also room for growth in other regions, notably Asia. But won’t low- cost Asian vendors be difficult for efficient than Lenovo, he says, and more profitable, thanks to its direct- sales model. Other growth areas are printers, storage systems and services. In printing, profit margins are unusually high, notes Michael. ‘We’ll fix that,’ he says, just as the company did when it undercut the high- margin incumbents in the server business. Dell’s service arm, meanwhile, which installs and manages computers for large companies, now represents 10 per cent of its business, and is growing twice as fast as its PC division.”\n\nClearly, Dell is a giant in transition. As it evolves into a pan-global twenty-first century enterprise, the company Michael founded in his dorm room in Austin 21 years ago is set to enter an exciting and challenging new era"
