Furthermore, the deal put the CEO back in the bullseye of his old nemesis, investor Carl Icahn, who bought an 8% stake of the tracking stock and threatened to sue if the offer wasn’t either dropped or raised.\n\nDell bowed to the pressure and offered investors more money—al- though not as much as Icahn wanted—and with Dell-EMC investing heavily in cloud, its FY2018 results showed it is likely to remain one of the top tech companies in the world for some time to come.\n\nA new era\n\n[/ihc-hide-content]"
