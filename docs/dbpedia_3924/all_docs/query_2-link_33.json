Now, as he seeks to take Dell Inc. private, the same investment firm may provide pivotal financing for what would be the largest buyout since 2007.\n\nIt wouldnâ€™t be the first time that Dell, who ranks 63rd on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with $14.1 billion, has relied on MSD Capital LP to increase his holdings in the computer company. Between January 2006 and March 2011, he bought $625 million of Dell stock with cash provided by MSD Capital, according to a person familiar with the firm, who asked not to be identified because its operations are private."
