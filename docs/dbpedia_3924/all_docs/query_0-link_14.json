        "text": "One of the world’s wealthiest tech CEOs is gearing up to make a major philanthropic donation. Michael Dell (DELL), founder of computing giant Dell Technologies, has pledged to give away up to $1.7 billion in company shares.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

As first reported by Bloomberg, 249,000 of these shares have already been donated to his family foundation.\n\nThis marks the second significant donation of Dell shares from the CEO in just two months—in October, he gifted $350 million worth of stock. Around 40 percent went to the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation. The remaining stocks were given to donor-advised funds, a form of giving accounts with flexible transparency requirements that are administered by third parties. The contributions marked Dell’s first donation of company shares since 2006.\n\nDell, 58, is the 17th wealthiest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $66.2 billion. Much of his fortune stems from his 50 percent stake in Dell, which he started as a 19-year-old student while attending the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). He took the company private in 2013 and three years later merged Dell with computer storage company EMC in a $60 million merger that stands as one of the largest-ever tech acquisitions.\n\nThe billionaire’s earliest significant donation took place in 1994 when he gifted 40 acres of land valued at $2.5 million to the Jewish Federation of Austin for a community center. He’s since continued to give away much of his wealth and in 1999 founded the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation. The organization, which aids educational, health and economic stability-focused initiatives in the U.S., India and South America, has donated more than $2.4 billion over the years.\n\nMichael Dell’s philanthropic track record\n\nSome of Dell’s most significant donations have included a $100 million gift for small businesses and Covid-19 relief initiatives in 2020 and a $36 million pledge to aid disaster relief efforts in the wake of 2017’s Hurricane Harvey. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022, the tech entrepreneur made $15 million in grants to Ukrainian groups—a donation that earned Dell and his wife Susan a spot on Forbes’ list of the top 25 U.S. philanthropists in 2023."
