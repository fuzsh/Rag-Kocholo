        "text": "The University of Texas System announces the creation of The University of Texas Medical Center, which will include two new, state-of-the-art hospitals ­­— a UT specialty hospital and a cancer center being built by MD Anderson.\n\nUT Health Austin and partner Ascension Seton perform the first kidney transplants at Dell Seton Medical Center and launch the first pediatric abdominal transplant center in Central Texas. UT President Jay Hartzell announces that Claudia F. Lucchinetti, M.D., will succeed Interim Dean George Macones, M.D., effective Dec. 1, 2022. In addition to serving as Dell Med’s second dean, she is named UT’s senior vice president for medical affairs.\n\nClay Johnston steps down as dean, kicking off a national search for new leadership for Dell Med and for medical affairs at UT. George Macones, M.D., is named interim dean; C. Martin Harris, M.D., is named interim vice president for medical affairs.\n\nDell Med earns full accreditation, paving the way for its inaugural graduation in May. In March, the first students participate in national Match Day. Throughout the year, the school — joined by UT and community partners — plays an integral part in Central Texas’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October, the Texas Center for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease performs the first-ever pediatric heart transplant in Austin, and in December, Dell Med is part of a campus coalition that delivers some of the area’s first vaccines.\n\nWith support from the Texas Legislature, a collaborative partnership — including the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and Dell Med — begins work to redesign the Austin State Hospital with the goal of transforming mental health and substance abuse care into an integrated system of comprehensive brain health. UT Health Austin and Dell Children’s Medical Center together launch the Texas Center for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, providing local families with world-class care close to home.\n\nAscension Seton opens the Dell Seton Medical Center at The University of Texas, the primary teaching hospital for Dell Med, in May as a replacement to the aging University Medical Center Brackenridge. In the summer, students in Dell Med’s inaugural class start providing care in hospitals and clinics around Austin as part of clinical clerkships. UT Health Austin, Dell Med’s innovative clinical practice, begins seeing patients in October.\n\nAt the start of the year, Dell Med launches graduate medical education programs with more than 600 residents and faculty prior to the school’s inaugural Match Day. On the heels of preliminary accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the school kicks off undergraduate medical student recruitment in the summer.\n\nIn January, UT names Clay Johnston, M.D., Ph.D., inaugural dean of Dell Medical School. Several months later, construction begins on medical school buildings designed with elements to support the well-being of occupants and foster collaboration. The innovative buildings ultimately earn recognition for sustainability. In July, UT, Central Health and the Community Care Collaborative sign an affiliation agreement, which formalizes the relationship among the three entities as well as the transfer of $35 million per year to support Dell Med.\n\nThe Michael & Susan Dell Foundation pledges $50 million over 10 years to the school through a naming gift in January. The UT System Board of Regents approves a plan in May to construct three new buildings to house medical education, research and administrative efforts on the UT campus. Ascension Seton and Central Health, the Travis County health care district, confirm plans to build a new teaching hospital on leased university land in the heart of the burgeoning health district.\n\nThe UT System Board of Regents allocates $25 million in annual funding for a UT medical school, plus another $40 million over eight years for faculty recruiting. Travis County voters take the unprecedented step of approving Proposition 1 in November, which raises property tax revenue to improve health for the people of Central Texas. The investment includes $35 million annually for a new medical school."
