        "text": "20.) Bill Moyers\n\nFor all of you PBS hippie lovers, President Johnson’s former Press Secretary, Bill Moyers, graduated from the University in 1956. He is well known for his work in public broadcasting, where you’ll find him on his weekly show Moyers & Company.\n\n19.) Roger Clemens\n\nNot unknown to controversy, 11-time All-Star, 2-time World Series Champion, and 7-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens helped the Longhorns win the 1983 College World Series. He is the first player to have his baseball uniform retired at UT…’cause Hook ’em!\n\n18.) Felicia Day\n\nHer hair is kinda burnt orange. And, she’s probably every gamer’s fantasy due to her Internet stardom (on top of playing “Vi” on TV’s Buffy the Vampire Slayer). She graduated from Texas in 2000, double majoring in mathematics and musical performance. Seriously. That hair."
