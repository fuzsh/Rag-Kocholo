A vote on that has been delayed until next week to give the Dell Inc. board more time to collect the votes needed to approval the deal. Here's a brief biography of Michael Dell:\n\nNAME: Michael S. Dell.\n\nCURRENT TITLE: Founder, chairman, CEO, Dell Inc.\n\nAGE: 48.\n\nBORN: February 1965 to an orthodontist and a stockbroker.\n\nEDUCATION: Attended the University of Texas and started a computer business in his dormitory room. Dropped out in 1984 to focus on building the company by emphasizing direct sales to customers rather than going through retail middlemen.\n\nCAREER: Made his first $1,000 by selling stamps at age 12, and sold newspaper subscriptions for the now-defunct Houston Post. Founded PC's Limited, now known as Dell, in 1984 at age 19. In 1992, Dell became the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company when it debuts on the list. He stepped down as CEO in 2004 and resumed that role in 2007.\n\nPHILANTHROPY: With his wife, he formed the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on children's issues."
