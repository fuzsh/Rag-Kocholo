        "text": "P&Q: What are some key elements in your teaching of leadership? What types of options does your school offer that deepens student experience with leadership and makes them more competitive in the marketplace?\n\nMabley: “At Texas McCombs, our approach to teaching leadership is multifaceted and embedded throughout our program, combining rigorous academic coursework with experiential learning opportunities. The curriculum is designed to instill in students strategic and future-ready leadership skills required for today’s dynamic business landscape. With a focus on developing critical thinking, cognitive agility, emotional intelligence, technology proficiency, ethical decision-making, global awareness, collaboration, and a mindset of continuous learning.\n\nWhile these skills are embedded throughout our program, four key courses where we focus on leadership include Leading People and Organizations, Creating and Managing Human Capital, Leading with Cognitive Agility, and Leading Innovation and Change. The leadership courses at Texas McCombs offer a comprehensive understanding of leadership dynamics and strategies essential for success in today’s business environment. Leading People and Organizations provides insights into employee and leader behavior, emphasizing factors such as motivation, communication, and organizational culture. Creating and Managing Human Capital introduces the concept of people analytics, emphasizing data-driven approaches – akin to what “Moneyball” did for baseball – to managing various HR functions by replacing intuition and rules of thumb with data, analysis, and quantifiable recommendations. Leading with Cognitive Agility focuses on developing mental flexibility skills through modules on creative problem-solving and adaptive thinking. Lastly, Leading Innovation and Change explores the crucial role of innovation and change leadership, covering topics such as fostering a culture of innovation and managing implementation processes. Through a combination of theoretical frameworks, real-world case studies, and interactive sessions with industry experts, students gain practical skills and insights to lead effectively in dynamic organizational settings.\n\nAt Texas McCombs, leadership is not just taught; it’s lived and breathed through experiential learning opportunities woven into our flagship Texas McCombs+ program and Center for Leadership and Ethics. Going beyond traditional classroom settings, our program immerses students in hands-on experiences such as consulting projects and global opportunities, fostering adaptability and resilience in diverse environments. Moreover, our vibrant community of student organizations further amplifies leadership development, offering numerous roles from club presidents to leaders of initiatives driving positive change. Through these avenues, students actively engage in shaping their MBA experience, honing their leadership competencies, and preparing to lead with impact in dynamic business landscapes. Additionally, we regularly host renowned leadership speakers who come to campus to share insights and experiences, enriching our students’ understanding and practice of effective leadership.”\n\nP&Q: Two years ago, P&Q asked you to share how you’ve integrated AI, STEM, analytics, and digital disruption into your programming. Since then, what types of enhancements have you made in these areas?\n\nMabley: “Over the past two years, Texas McCombs has made significant strides in integrating AI, STEM, analytics, and digital disruption into our programming, aligning with the University of Texas at Austin’s ambitious Year of AI initiative. This dedicated effort highlights our commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements and fostering a dynamic learning environment.\n\nThe Year of AI initiative serves as a catalyst for our commitment, providing a platform for collaborative research and education. Faculty members across disciplines engage in cutting-edge research projects, translating their findings into impactful classroom experiences. Our students benefit not only from the theoretical foundations but also from practical applications derived from ongoing research, preparing them to address real-world challenges.\n\nOne key aspect of our advancements is reflected in the strategic expansion of faculty hiring, not only within McCombs but also in collaboration with other college departments. This interdisciplinary approach ensures a holistic and comprehensive understanding of AI’s impact on business and society.\n\nFurthermore, our active involvement with the Year of AI initiative allows us to leverage resources, industry partnerships, and collaborative opportunities that enrich our curriculum. In addition to our academic endeavors, the University of Texas at Austin will showcase its expertise on AI and innovation at SXSW, providing a unique platform to demonstrate the university’s impact across various industries and functions.\n\nBy participating in events like SXSW, we extend the reach of our educational initiatives, emphasizing UT-Austin’s role as a leader in AI and innovation. This comprehensive approach underscores our commitment to providing cutting-edge education, empowering our students to thrive in a technology-driven business environment.”\n\nP&Q: How many courses outside the business school can MBAs take during your program? To what extent has your business school embraced coursework from other schools and departments at your university?\n\nMabley: “MBAs can take up to two graduate level courses outside of the business school, providing opportunities to enhance their expertise across disciplines. Examples of popular cross-disciplinary electives include courses in architecture/urban planning and real estate, design thinking, entertainment and media, law, public policy, mechanical engineering, nutrition entrepreneurship, healthcare, marketing and advertising, and energy.\n\nOur program takes pride in welcoming graduate students from other top-ranked programs within the university. This collaborative approach fosters a unique and dynamic learning environment, where students engage with peers from various disciplines, gaining a broader perspective on complex business challenges. A key differentiator is the number of significant partnerships the school has established with other top colleges at UT through our MBA dual degrees. These partnerships, exemplified by programs with the Dell Medical School, LBJ School of Public Affairs, School of Advertising and Public Relations and the Law School, enable our students to pursue dual degrees that seamlessly integrate business education with specialized knowledge from other fields.\n\nMcCombs has also embraced innovative partnerships that integrate coursework from other university departments. A prime example is the recently launched Nexxus Project – a unique collaboration between Dell Medical School, McCombs, and the College of Pharmacy. This experiential program connects motivated graduate students to gain hands-on bioscience product development experience. Participants form interdisciplinary teams to evaluate and advance a healthcare innovation, culminating in a pitch presentation to the Nexxus Project Advisory Board. The teams also benefit from a two-week apprenticeship with an industry partner.\n\nThrough both traditional cross-listed electives and partnerships like Nexxus, we take advantage of the breadth and depth of our university to provide our MBAs with interdisciplinary education that equips them to lead across sectors and domains.”\n\nP&Q: What is your biggest student-run event of the year and what does it reflect about your school?\n\nMabley: “The Texas McCombs MBA program takes pride in hosting one of its signature events each fall – the Annual International Night. This is a spectacular showcase of the international diversity that defines our close-knit community and stands as a testament to the global reach of both the Texas McCombs MBA and the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nInternational Night serves as a vibrant celebration where students from a multitude of nationalities come together to share their unique cultural heritage through traditional cuisines, performances, and interactive displays. This event not only underscores the unique backgrounds within the Texas McCombs MBA program but also reflects the broader international community at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nOur commitment to global perspectives is exemplified by the rich tapestry of cultures represented within the MBA program and the university. International Night is a microcosm of this diversity, offering an immersive experience that goes beyond borders and creates a global mindset among our students.\n\nIn summary, International Night is a living representation of our commitment to fostering a global perspective and preparing business leaders who are not only adept in their fields but also culturally fluent and globally aware.”"
