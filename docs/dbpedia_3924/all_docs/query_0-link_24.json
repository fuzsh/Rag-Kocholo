        "text": "Fine art photographer Keith Dotson returned to his old hometown of Austin to capture this collection of urban landscape photographs featuring magnificent trees\n\nFine art photographer Keith Dotson is delighted to announce a new collection of B&W photographs of beautiful trees found across the vast landscape of the University of Texas at Austin campus.\n\nAccording to Keith, being on campus felt like a homecoming, \"Even though I didn't graduate from UT, I grew up not far from Austin and UT feels like my alma mater because I came here so often for school events. I attended journalism camps here in high school. I stayed in Jester Hall while attending the legendary Texas Boys State at the state Capitol building. I remember the excitement of walking across campus and down the drag in the late 70s, and early 80s.\"\n\nThe main campus of UT Austin covers more than 350 acres and features approximately 4,700 trees*. The university has expressed that it values the diversity of trees across the campus. UT Austin was recognized as a Tree Campus USA by the Arbor Day Foundation for more than a decade.\n\nNotable alums of the University of Texas at Austin include Matthew McConaughey, Farrah Fawcett, Owen Wilson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Walter Cronkite, Laura Bush, Jayne Mansfield, Janis Joplin, Michael Dell, Kevin Durant, Wes Anderson, Bill Moyers, and countless others from across business, athletics, and entertainment.\n\nFine art prints are available\n\nAvailable as fine art prints on baryta surface fiber-based photo paper in sizes from small to very large, the photographs are great as single prints are part of a themed grouping.\n\nBlack and white photographs of the trees of the University of Texas at Austin\n\nBelow are a few select images from the collection.\n\nClick here to see the entire collection.\n\nBig Trees on the Campus of UT Austin - Black and White Photograph by Keith Dotson.
