        "text": "Stories You May Like\n\nUniversity’s ‘Alma Mater’ has tunefully connected Cornellians for a century and a half\n\nBy Joe Wilensky\n\nRobert Shapiro ’04 first heard the “Alma Mater” played by the Cornell Chimes after he arrived on the Hill as an undergrad. But the song didn’t take on a particular resonance until his junior year, when he was majoring in music and joined the Glee Club, singing the bass line nearly every week.\n\n“That same semester, I got season hockey tickets, and what struck me is how versatile the ‘Alma Mater’ was,” he recalls. “It could be sung lyrically at Sage Chapel—and raucously at Lynah Rink.”\n\nThe Big Red anthem is sung at nearly every official University event. It’s a staple in the Glee Club and Chorus repertoire; has brought alumni together for decades in swaying harmony at Reunion and around the world; is played at halftimes and between periods at sports events by the Big Red Pep Band and others; and concludes every midday Cornell Chimes concert.\n\nThe song—which dates back a century and a half, to just a couple of years after classes began on the Hill—is identified with Cornell as closely as McGraw Tower or the Ezra Cornell statue. Its lyrics contain several iconic Big Red phrases, including “Far above Cayuga’s waters,” “lift the chorus,” and “glorious to view.”\n\nThe song is likely the most famous alma mater in America, and it continues to bind Cornellians across the generations and miles.\n\nMichael Slon ’92\n\nCornell was the first university to use the tune—adapted from a popular 19th-century ballad—for its alma mater. (The term, Latin for “bountiful mother” or “nourishing mother,” can mean both the institution from which one has graduated and that school’s song.) Cornell’s has been sung as part of a virtual global Sesquicentennial celebration, played on kazoos at the Sy Katz ’31 Parade in NYC, parodied, and even reimagined in a hip-hop version.\n\n“The song is likely the most famous alma mater in America, and it continues to bind Cornellians across the generations and miles,” says Michael Slon ’92, a professor and the director of choral music at the University of Virginia who authored Songs From the Hill, a history of the Cornell Glee Club. “As a scholar of this music, you find there are a lot of similarities between school songs, including the themes and the sources for tunes. But there is something absolutely unique and powerful when it’s your alma mater.”\n\nOrigins in roommates’ duets\n\nThe story of the “Alma Mater” begins in 1870 with two undergrads: Archibald Weeks 1872—a bass singer and a clarinetist in the University orchestra—and Wilmot Smith 1874, a tenor. They often sang duets in their shared room on North Tioga Street; one of the most popular songs in the country at the time was “Annie Lisle,” a mournful ballad composed in 1857 by H.S. Thompson.\n\nWeeks was also a skater and oarsman who spent a lot of time on Cayuga Lake and the inlet, “from which the University buildings could be plainly seen outlined against the sky,” he recalled late in life. He described how, with the “Annie Lisle” melody in his head, “the view of the college buildings as I frequented the lake suggested the words ‘far above Cayuga’s waters.’”\n\nThe view of the college buildings as I frequented the lake suggested the words ‘far above Cayuga’s waters.’\n\nArchibald Weeks 1872\n\nIn a letter to the University librarian, Weeks described how he and Smith wrote the “Alma Mater”:\n\n“The blending of our voice—he tenor, I, bass—pleased us exceedingly in the music of ‘Annie Lisle.’ I proposed that we adapt a college song to the music and suggested the first two lines of the first verse; he responded with the third and fourth, I with the fifth and sixth, and he with the seventh and eighth. The chorus was the result of mutual suggestion.”\n\nThe song’s popularity among students quickly grew. Tweaks to three lines of the lyrics (including replacing “ever free and true” with “glorious to view”) were likely made a few years later by Colin Urquhart 1876; changes in the structure—such as moving the chorus up into the middle of what was the first verse, splitting it into two verses, and then repeating the chorus—also occurred prior to 1900.\n\nIn pop culture, and through generations\n\nWhile Cornell was the first to use an adaptation of “Annie Lisle” for its alma mater, high schools and universities around the world—including those in Indiana, Missouri, Georgia, North Carolina, and even Beirut—have since followed suit, employing their own lyrics.\n\nFor thousands of Cornellians, of course, the quintessential Big Red song represents a lifelong connection to the University, serves as a vessel for Cornell spirit, and continues to echo through subsequent generations. Shapiro, for one, sang it “as a lullaby to my daughter when she was a newborn, along with the ‘Evening Song.’”\n\nCurrent chimesmaster Jenna Mertz ’23 recalls first hearing the “Alma Mater” during Orientation Week, when she climbed McGraw Tower to watch a concert. “I was amazed by how difficult it looked and how skillfully they performed it,” she says. “At the time, the song was just a song, and Cornell was just school. As I’ve progressed through my time here, Cornell has become my home, and the ‘Alma Mater’ has become an embodiment of the sense of family I feel here. It connects me to Cornell in a way that nothing else does.”\n\nThe original ‘Alma Mater’ verse and chorus by Weeks and Smith\n\nThe full version contains six verses—but for the past 125 years, traditionally only the first has been sung, split into two verses that alternate with the repeated chorus.\n\nWeeks himself expressed surprise years later that “the first verse, which had been floating around from mouth to mouth,” had been split into two and performed as the full song, “as it was only introductory in the way of locating the subject and there was no termination or proper ending or climax to it whatsoever.” He did ultimately revise the remaining verses (see below) for a preface to the first edition of the Songs of Cornell, published in 1900.\n\n“The last verse is intended as a toast,” Weeks noted in a 1917 note to the Cornell Era, “and can be sung accompanied by any appropriate action.”\n\nThe Cornell ‘Alma Mater’\n\nVerse one\n\nFar above Cayuga’s waters,\n\nWith its waves of blue,\n\nStands our noble Alma Mater,\n\nGlorious to view.\n\nChorus\n\nLift the chorus, speed it onward,\n\nLoud her praises tell;\n\nHail to thee, our Alma Mater!\n\nHail, all hail, Cornell!\n\nVerse two\n\nStories You May Like\n\nFar above the busy humming\n\nOf the bustling town,\n\nReared against the arch of heaven,\n\nLooks she proudly down.\n\n(Chorus repeats)\n\nThe rest of the verses:\n\nVerse three\n\nSentry-like o’er lake and valley,\n\nTowers her regal form,\n\nWatch and ward forever keeping,\n\nBraving time and storm.\n\nSo through clouds of doubt and darkness\n\nGleams her beacon light,\n\nFault and error clear revealing,\n\nBlazing forth the right.\n\nVerse four\n\nTo the glory of her founder\n\nRise her stately walls;\n\nMay her sons pay equal tribute\n\nWhere’er duty calls.\n\nWhen the moments swiftly fleeting,\n\nAges roll between,\n\nMany yet unborn shall hail her\n\nAlma Mater, Queen!\n\nVerse five\n\nIn the music of the waters,\n\nAs they glide along,\n\nIn the murmur of the breezes\n\nWith their whispered song;\n\nIn the tuneful chorus blending\n\nWith each pealing bell,\n\nOne refrain seems oft repeated,\n\n“Hail, all hail, Cornell!”\n\nVerse six\n\nHere, by flood and foaming torrent,\n\nGorge and rocky dell,\n\nPledge we faith and homage ever\n\nTo our loved Cornell.\n\nMay time ne’er efface the memory\n\nOf her natal day,\n\nAnd her name and fame be honored,\n\nFar and wide, alway!\n\nTop image: The sheet music to Cornell's “Alma Mater” as it appears in an early copy of Cornell Songs.
