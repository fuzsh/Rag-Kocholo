This month more than 1000 Australians voted The Castle’s Darryl Kerrigan as the Aussie battler that most represents them as a nation. But giving him a run(s) for his money would have to be portaloo installer Kenny Smyth, who plumbs even greater depths of fair-dinkumness — not to mention humility and hilarity — in this award-winning mockumentary that was partly inspired by the director and star’s uncle. As Variety said of the 2006 release, which spawned a short-lived TV spin-off, Kenny’s World, “funny enough to give scatology a good name”. Its Blu-ray roll-out is to be applauded, for not only the superior presentation but also being flushed with new extras, including a film-makers’ commentary (in addition to the original in-character commentary by Shane Jacobson, whose latest vehicle is co-hosting Top Gear Australia).
