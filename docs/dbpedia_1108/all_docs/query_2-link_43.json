        "text": "Renowned Australian music promoter and record label founder Michael Gudinski has died.\n\nGudinski died suddenly overnight in Melbourne, his company Mushroom Group confirmed.\n\nThe 68-year-old signed Kylie Minogue in 1987 and worked with some of the biggest names in music.\n\n\"The much-loved Australian music legend died peacefully in his sleep at his home in Melbourne, Australia,\" Mushroom Group said in a statement.\n\n\"Michael Gudinski was a key figure in shaping the Australian music industry.\n\n\"He founded the Mushroom Group in 1972 at just 20 years old, which flourished into Australia's largest independent entertainment group covering touring, record labels, publishing, merchandising, booking agencies, film and television production and creative services.\n\n\"Some of Australia's most iconic albums have been released under one of his Mushroom Group record labels.\n\n\"His touring company Frontier Touring is Australia's leading promoter, touring the biggest names in global music since its inception in 1979.\n\n\"A larger-than-life figure, Michael was widely respected for his unwavering passion for all music – in particular Australian music.\"\n\nToday Extra host and performer David Campbell said his father, legendary rocker Jimmy Barnes, was \"crushed\" at the news.\n\n\"I don't think we would have an Australian music scene, as strong as it is in this country, without someone like Michael Gudinski,\" Campbell said.\n\nNine entertainment editor Richard Wilkins paid tribute to Gudinski's support for the local industry.\n\n\"He leaves such a legacy,\" Wilkins said.\n\n\"You know that song, 'Built the city on rock 'n' roll'.\n\n\"That's the song... he loved Melbourne. Melbourne loved him.\n\n\"He did so much over recent times during COVID to put those shows on.\"\n\nGudinski started Mushroom Records, which became Australia's biggest independent label, and Mushroom Music Publishing, in the 1970s.\n\nHe had international success with acts including Peter Andre and Garbage.\n\nHe promoted concerts by touring superstars and went on to work with some of the world's biggest names from Elton John to Dolly Parton.\n\nHe later sold the record arm but kept Mushroom Group.\n\nHe won multiple industry awards and was given a Member of the Order of Australia medal in 2006 for services to the entertainment industry.\n\nLast year he arranged the Music From the Home Front TV concert with stars including Barnes.\n\n\"It speaks to the man he was that of his countless illustrious career achievements these projects, that supported the industry he loved, were ones he was particularly proud of,\" Mushroom Group said.\n\n\"Michael was renowned for his loyalty and dedication. His ability to achieve the unachievable against unsurmountable (sic) odds was proven time and again and spoke to his absolute passion for his career and life.\n\n\"Michael's family loved him immensely and Michael in turn adored his wife Sue, son Matt and partner Cara, daughter Kate and husband Andrew and their children Nina-Rose and Lulu.\n\n\"They meant everything to him, and he was immensely proud of them.\n\n\"Michael often referred to his 200+ staff as the Mushroom Family, with many having clocked decades in his employment.\n\n\"Michael's legacy will live on through his family and the enormously successful Mushroom Group – an enduring embodiment of decades of passion and determination from an incredible man.\"\n\nJust last month, Minogue called him a \"legend of the Australian music industry\" in an Instagram post.\n\nAustralian entertainment industry figures paid tribute to Gudinksi after news of his death broke.\n\nJimmy Barnes, in a series of tweets, wrote: \"Today the heart of Australian music was ripped out. I felt it, my family felt it, the music business felt it , the world felt it. Michael Gudinski was not only that heart but he was my friend.\n\n\"He stood with me through my darkest moments and my most joyous days.\n\n\"Michael was the rock I reached for when life tried to wash me away. He never closed his door or his heart to me and my family. But I wasn't the only one who felt like Michael was there for me.\n\n\"He was there for everyone that needed him. The music business turned, grew and moved forward in Australia because of Michael.\n\n\"He was a force of nature, a giant of a man.\"\n\nActor Russell Crowe said on Twitter: \"I'm going to miss him deeply.\"\n\nSinger Marcia Hines and INXS singer Jon Stevens both tweeted: \"Thank you for the music\", with an image of the initials MG on a black background.\n\nOpposition Leader Anthony Albanese said on Twitter they were both at a Midnight Oil concert just on Thursday in Sydney.\n\n\"It's hard to think of anyone who did more for Australian music than Michael,\" he said.\n\nAmerican rocker, Bruce Springsteen said he'd \"never met a better promoter\".\n\n\"He will be remembered by artists, including this one, from all over the world, every time they step foot on Australian soil,\" he said in a statement.\n\nBritish pop singer, Ed Sheeran, posted a poignant photo of himself with Gundinski against a sunset.\n\nHe wrote: \"I'll miss you, mate\".\n\nHugh Marks, CEO of Nine, which publishes this website, said in a statement he was \"deeply saddened and shocked\" at Gudinski's death.\n\n\"A titan of the Australian music and entertainment scene, he forged a ground-breaking path and leaves an incredible legacy,\" he said.\n\n\"So many of us at Nine have worked closely with him over many years, most recently through the pandemic.\n\n\"Joining forces with Michael to produce Music From the Home Front and Sounds Better Together concerts, his love, support and commitment to local musicians was centre stage.\n\n\"A force for good, for artists and for his industry, one of the truly creative people I know, we will all really miss him.\""
