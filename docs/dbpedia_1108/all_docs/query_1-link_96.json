A total of sixteen English-language volumes will be published in this series, organized according to chronology and geography. The series documents the horrific historical events embodied by the terms Holocaust and Shoah. This English-language edition reproduces all the materials in the German edition but has been adapted for an English-speaking readership. Apart from those originally written in English, all documents have been translated from the language of the original source. The foreword to the first volume of the series detailed the criteria for the selection of the documents. These criteria can be summarized as follows. First, the sources used for this edition are written documents and, occasionally, transcribed audio materials, dating from the period of National Socialist rule between 1933 and 1945. The decision was taken not to include memoirs, reports, and judicial documents produced in the period after 1945; however, the footnotes make extensive reference to such retrospective testimonies and historical accounts. Second, the documents shed light on the actions and reactions of people with differing backgrounds and convictions and in different places, and indicate their intentions as well as the frequently limited options available to them. The volumes include a variety of document types such as official correspondence, private letters, diary entries, newspaper articles, and the reports of foreign observers. The documents within each volume are arranged chronologically. This second volume in the series contains documents on the disenfranchisement and expropriation of the Jews in Germany after 1 January 1938 and in Austria from the Anschluss of March 1938 until the beginning of the Second World War on 1 September 1939. The documentation ranges from legislation on the Aryanization of the German economy to the narrative of a Jewish prisoner about his experiences in a concentration camp. The notes of a young girl describing her fear of the looming November pogroms appear alongside the account of a Jewish aid organization on the growing number of refugees, and the speech in which Hitler makes reference to the annihilation of the Jews in Europe. Events and developments are thus presented from multiple perspectives. The series has been generously funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as a long-term humanities project. The English edition, which is also DFG funded, is a joint project with the Yad Vashem International Institute for Holocaust Research. In addition to the sponsors, the editors are most grateful to the large number of archivists, public officials, historians, and private individuals who have lent assistance to the project. They have provided the editors with advice and comments on sources and with information for the annotations, including biographical details of the persons featured in the documents. Todd Brown, Alex J. Kay, Kathleen Luft, Jennifer E. Neuheiser, and Nicola Varns translated the German-language documents for this second Englishlanguage volume in the series. Carol Sykes translated the French and Spanish-language documents. The Italian-language document was translated by Alex J. Kay, and the Dutch-language document by David Lee. Merle Read provided copy-editing services. Ingo Loose assisted with the documents containing Hebrew words and expressions.\n\n8\n\nForeword to the English Edition\n\nPeter Palm and Giles Bennett created and advised on the map in this volume. Alicia Brudney, Joseph Dunlop, Nora Huberty, Priska Komaromi, Ashley Kirspel, Benedict Oldfield, Barbara Uchdorf, Ana Lena Werner, and Max Zeterberg contributed to this volume as student assistants. Johannes Gamm was responsible for database management. The following people contributed to the original German volume as student assistants: Romina Becker, Giles Bennett, Natascha Butzke, Florian Danecke, Vera Dost, Ivonne Meybohm, Miriam Schelp, and Remigius Stachowiak. Andrea Löw and Gudrun Schroeter contributed in their capacity as research fellows. Despite all the care taken, occasional inaccuracies cannot be entirely avoided in such a source collection. We would be grateful for any notifications to this effect. They will be taken into account for future publications. The address of the editorial board is: Institut für Zeitgeschichte München–Berlin, Edition ‘Judenverfolgung’, Finckensteinallee 85/ 87, 12 205 Berlin, Germany. Berlin/Munich/Freiburg/Klagenfurt, April 2018\n\nEditorial Preface This primary source collection on the persecution and murder of the European Jews should be cited using the abbreviation PMJ. This citation style is also used in the work itself where there are cross references between the individual volumes. The documents are consecutively numbered, beginning anew with each volume. Accordingly, ‘PMJ 1/200’ refers to document number 200 in the first volume of this edition. The individual documents are presented as follows: title (in bold type), header, document, footnotes. The titles have been formulated by the editor(s) of the respective volume and provide information on the date of origin of the document, its core message, author, and recipient(s). The header, placed underneath the title, is part of the document itself. It specifies the type of source (letter, draft law, minutes, and so on), the name of the author, the place of origin, the file reference (where applicable), remarks indicating confidential or classified status, and other special features of the document. The location of the ministries or other central agencies in Berlin at the time, for instance the Reich Security Main Office or the Chancellery of the Führer, is not cited. The header also contains details about the addressee and, where applicable, the date of the receipt stamp, and it concludes with the date of origin and reference to the stage of processing of the source, for instance ‘draft’, ‘carbon copy’, or ‘copy’. The header is followed by the document text. Salutations and valedictions are printed, though signatures are only included once, in the header. Instances of emphasis by the author in the original document are retained. Irrespective of the type of emphasis used in the original source (for example, underlined, spaced, bold, capitalized, or italicized), they always appear in italics in the printed version. Where necessary, additional particulars on the document are to be found in the footnotes. In order to enhance readability, letters and words are added in square brackets where they are missing in the original due to obvious mistakes, or where the meaning would otherwise be unclear in the translation. There is a list of abbreviations at the back of the volume. Uncommon abbreviations, primarily from private correspondence, are expanded in a footnote at the first mention in a given document. Handwritten additions in typewritten originals have been adopted by the editors without further indication insofar as they are formal corrections and most probably inserted by the author. If the additions significantly alter the content – either by mitigating or radicalizing it – this is mentioned in the footnotes, and, if known, the author of the addition(s) is given. As a rule, the documents are reproduced here in full. Only in exceptional cases, where individual documents are very long, is the document abridged. Such editing is indicated by an ellipsis in square brackets; the contents of the omitted text are outlined in a footnote. One such exceptional case is the diary of Luise Solmitz, which has survived in both a handwritten version and a typewritten version compiled by Luise Solmitz herself after 1945. Since the handwritten version is very difficult to read and contains lengthy entries that are of limited historical interest, excerpts are documented in the presented volume in accordance with the typescript. However, the first entry that\n\n10\n\nEditorial Preface\n\nis included in this volume, from 27 January 1938, is reproduced in its entirety from the handwritten version to give a representative example of the diary. The italicized sections indicate passages that are only found in the handwritten version of the diary. The sections in roman type are from the typewritten version. The author occasionally added retrospective annotations to both the manuscript and the typescript; these are marked with curly brackets: {}. Undated monthly or annual reports are dated to the end of the month or year that they appear. Only in a few exceptional cases is a deviation made from the chronological organization of the documents: in this volume in the case of the life stories of Jewish émigrés written in 1939/1940 for a competition organized by Harvard University. These descriptive texts, which were written soon after the period covered but nonetheless retrospectively, are classified in some cases according to the date of the events portrayed rather than the date of origin. Where there is any uncertainty regarding the date of the documents or whether they constitute originals or copies, reference is made in the footnotes. The first footnote for each document, which is linked to the title, contains the location of the source and, insofar as it denotes an archive, the reference number, as well as the folio number(s) if available. Reference to copies of archival documents in research institutions and in the German Federal Archives in Berlin are always made if the original held at the location first mentioned was not consulted there. In the case of printed sources, for instance newspaper articles or legislative texts, this footnote contains standard bibliographical information. If the source has already been published in English in a document collection on National Socialism or on the persecution of the Jews, reference is made to its first publication, alongside the original location of the source. The next footnote explains the origins of the document and, where appropriate, mentions related discussions, the specific role of authors and recipients, and activities accompanying or immediately following its genesis. Subsequent footnotes provide additional information related to the theme of the document and the persons relevant to the content. They refer to other – published or unpublished – sources that contribute to historical contextualization. The footnotes also point out individual features of the documents, for instance handwritten notes in the margin, underlining, or deletions, whether by the author or the recipient(s). Annotations and instructions for submission are referred to in the footnotes where the editors consider them to contain significant information. Where possible, the locations of the treaties, laws, and decrees cited in the source text are provided in the footnotes, while other documents are given with their archival reference number. If these details could not be ascertained, this is also noted. Where biographical information is available on the senders and recipients of the documents, this is provided in the footnotes. The same applies to persons mentioned in the text if they play an active role in the events described. As a general rule, this information is given in the footnote inserted after the first mention of the name in question in the volume. Biographical information on a particular person can thus be retrieved easily via the index. The short biographies are based on data found in reference works, scholarly literature, or the Central Database of Shoah Victims’ Names established and run by Yad Vashem. In many cases, the information was retrieved by consulting personnel files and\n\nEditorial Preface\n\n11\n\nindexes, municipal and company archives, registry offices, restitution and denazification files, or specialists in the field. Indexes and files on persons from the Nazi era held in archives were also used, primarily those of the former Berlin Document Center, the Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic (Bundesbeauftragte für die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik), and the Central Office of the Judicial Authorities of the Federal States for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes (Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen zur Aufklärung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen) in Ludwigsburg, the last of these now stored in the German Federal Archives. Despite every effort, it has not always been possible to obtain complete biographical information. In such cases, the footnote in question contains only verified facts such as the year of birth. Where a person could not be identified, there is no footnote reference. Biographical footnotes are not added in the case of extremely well-known individuals such as Adolf Hitler or Joseph Goebbels. As a rule, in the titles, footnotes, and introduction inverted commas are not placed around terms that were commonplace in National Socialist Germany, such as Führer, Jewish Council, or Aryanization, but German-language terms expressing ideological concepts of race such as Mischling are placed in italics. In line with the circumstances of the time, the terms Jew and Jewish are also used for people who did not regard themselves as Jewish but were defined as such on the basis of racial legislation and thus subjected to persecution. References in the documents to the ‘Gestapo’, an acronym of the German GEheime STAatsPOlizei, and to the ‘State Police’ denote one and the same institution: the Secret State Police. The glossary contains concise descriptions of key terms and concepts that are repeated on multiple occasions or are related to the events and developments described in the volume. All primary and secondary sources consulted are listed in the footnotes and bibliography. Where English-language versions of these sources are available, these are included. If a document has already been published in English translation but has been retranslated for this volume, this is indicated in a footnote. The index includes all names referred to in the volume and all places significant to the content of the respective documents. It also contains organizations and institutions, as well as terms and concepts relevant to the volume. Note on the translation British English is used in all translations into English. Where a document was originally written in British or American English, the spelling, grammar, and punctuation of the original have been retained, with silent correction of minor typographical or grammatical errors and insertions in square brackets to clarify the meaning if necessary. The spelling, grammar, and punctuation of the translated documents broadly conform to the guidelines in New Hart’s Rules: The Oxford Style Guide (2014). Accordingly, the ending -ize rather than -ise is preferred throughout. SS, Wehrmacht, and certain other ranks are given in the original German, as are titles where there is no standard equivalent in English or where there may be confusion with contemporary usage. A table of military and police ranks is included as an appendix,\n\n12\n\nEditorial Preface\n\nalong with English-language equivalents of these terms and an indication of their position in the National Socialist hierarchy. In addition, administrative ranks and other terms commonly used in German in scholarly literature on the period are presented in German in this volume and explained in the glossary. All laws and institutions are translated into English in the documents; the German titles of laws can be found in the index. In the introduction and footnotes, foreignlanguage terms and expressions are added in brackets after the translation where this is considered important for understanding or context. If a word or phrase appears in German in a non-German document, the German is retained in the translated text and its meaning explained in a footnote or, if necessary, the glossary. The original spelling of foreign organizations is retained in the footnotes. The titles of published works not in the English language are not translated unless the work in question is of contextual or substantial relevance. In order to avoid confusion between British and American English, dates are spelt out in the order day, month, and year. Foreign proper names are not italicized. Thus, names of institutions, organizations, and places are written in roman type in the footnotes, but legislation and conceptual terms are in italics. In the titles, footnotes, and translated documents, place names are written according to the contemporary (English) name or the name commonly used in scholarly literature on the period. This also applies to places that have since been renamed, so, for example, ‘Danzig’ not ‘Gdańsk’. Diacritical marks in languages such as Czech and Polish are retained, with the exception of the names of the extermination camps in Eastern Europe, where they have been removed in order to emphasize that these camps were established by the German National Socialist regime. Hebrew and Yiddish terms are described in the footnotes along with any other words requiring explanation.\n\nIntroduction This volume documents the persecution of the Jews living in the German Reich during the twenty-month period between January 1938 and 31 August 1939. Within this short timespan, the German Reich annexed Austria in March 1938 and the Sudetenland, the border region of the Bohemian basin with a majority German population, in October of the same year. In March 1939 the Wehrmacht occupied Prague, and on 1 September it invaded Poland, thus unleashing the Second World War. In the months that passed between the Anschluss and the invasion of Poland, and in a development closely linked to the preparations for war, the National Socialist leadership imposed a state of emergency on the German Jews. Civil servants, government ministers, Party functionaries, and neighbours increased discrimination to the point of terror, intensified economic disadvantages to the level of expropriation, and created a climate of desperation through the heightened pressure to emigrate. They forced tens of thousands of Jews with just a few Reichsmarks in their pockets across the border and drove hundreds to suicide. In the pogroms of 9–10 November 1938, what Joseph Goebbels termed ‘the anger of the people’ was manifested by tens of thousands of SA men (Storm Troopers) wreaking havoc. Hundreds of thousands stood by and watched. That night, almost all the synagogues in Germany were destroyed, and in the following days, more than 25,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps, where they were held for weeks, humiliated and tormented, and several hundred were murdered. The November pogroms and the subsequent political decisions regarding anti-Jewish policy are the main focus of this volume. Other central themes include the persecution of 190,000 Austrian Jews following the Anschluss by Germany, as well as the measures that partly expropriated the assets of the persecuted and partly brought them under state control for the purpose of future expropriation. Finally, this volume documents the forcible expulsion of the Jews from Germany. The expansion of the National Socialist state, the pogroms, and Aryanization transformed forced emigration into a chaotic mass exodus. The effects jeopardized Jewish existence across large parts of Europe. The persecution of the Czech Jews, who came under German rule on 14 and 15 March 1939 and subsequently lived in the Reich Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, will be documented in the third volume of this edition. Though Danzig was not part of the Reich before the invasion of Poland but rather a Free City under the control of the League of Nations, the situation of Danzig’s Jews is also dealt with in Volume 2, because the Danzig Senate, dominated by National Socialists since summer 1933, enforced numerous anti-Jewish measures based on German policies. In the Memel Territory, which had been part of Lithuania since 1924, antisemitism began to proliferate with German support, beginning in the mid 1930s, long before the Memel Territory was returned to the Reich on 23 March 1939 as a result of serious threats from the Nazi leadership in Berlin.\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Situation of German Jews in Early 1938 At the end of 1937, around 400,000 Jews were still living in Germany; 130,000 had emigrated in the preceding five years. Most Jews lived in large cities, 140,000 in Berlin alone. Occupational bans, boycotts, and the emigration of the younger generations had greatly altered the social structure: by this time, one in two German Jews was over the age of fifty, with one in four dependent on welfare. While there had been 8,000 Jewish doctors at the beginning of the 1930s, by 1937 only 3,300 remained. People who had once been affluent were forced to move into smaller homes and sell their family’s valuables.1 According to the results of the population census of May 1939, barely 16 per cent of German Jews were still employed (in contrast to 48 per cent in 1933), and more than 70 per cent of all Jews over the age of 14 were by now categorized as being economically independent but without occupation.2 Contact between Jews and non-Jews became rare. Often both groups avoided each other to prevent awkwardness. Almost all associations had excluded their Jewish members. Signs denying entry to Jews were posted at the entrance to many towns and villages and in parks, bathing resorts and restaurants. As literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki recalled, ‘there were also restaurants where the management preferred to dispense with such signs at the entrance, and instead empty cups were set down in front of those Jews who nonetheless dared to enter these establishments, sometimes with a slip of paper with the words “Jews out”’. Non-Jews who continued to maintain contact with Jewish acquaintances had to expect animosity. Many Jewish pupils had already left the state schools before they were officially banned from attending them after the pogroms of 1938 (Docs. 16, 46). Either they could no longer endure the antisemitic taunts and spiteful remarks of their Aryan fellow pupils and teachers or their parents could no longer afford the school fees, which were neither reduced nor waived for Jews, unlike Aryan pupils. According to estimates, in May 1938 only around a quarter of all Jewish primary school-pupils still attended state schools.3 Until the November pogroms, Jews were not generally barred from theatres, concert halls, and cinemas, but in some places, including Leipzig with its large Jewish Herbert A. Strauss, ‘Jewish Emigration from Germany: Nazi Policies and Jewish Responses’, Leo Baeck Institute Year Book, vol. 25 (1980), pp. 313–361, here pp. 326 and 341–342, and vol. 26 (1981), pp. 343–409; Hazel Rosenstrauch (ed.), Aus Nachbarn wurden Juden: Ausgrenzung und Selbstbehauptung 1933–1942 (Berlin: Transit, 1988), p. 70. On Jewish poverty, also see David Kramer, ‘Jewish Welfare Work under the Impact of Pauperisation’, in Arnold Paucker (ed.), Die Juden im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland / The Jews in Nazi Germany, 1933–1943 (Tübingen: Mohr, 1986), pp. 173–188; Salomon Adler-Rudel, Jüdische Selbsthilfe unter dem Naziregime 1933–1939: Im Spiegel der Berichte der Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland (Tübingen: Mohr, 1974), pp. 158–165. In Hamburg, the share of recipients among the Jews in the winter of 1938–1939 was 37 per cent: Uwe Lohalm, Fürsorge und Verfolgung: Öffentliche Wohlfahrtsverwaltung und nationalsozialistische Judenpolitik in Hamburg 1933 bis 1942 (Hamburg: Ergebnisse, 1998), p. 49. 2 Berufslose Selbstständige; a category including those living on their own assets and those in receipt of various pensions and benefits. On the results of the population census, see Peter Longerich, Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews, new edn, trans. Shaun Whiteside (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010 [German edn, 1998]), p. 127, and Joseph Walk, Jüdische Schule und Erziehung im Dritten Reich (Frankfurt am Main: A. Hain, 1991), pp. 214–215. 3 Marcel Reich-Ranicki, Mein Leben (Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, 1999), p. 69, quotation p. 156; Marion A. Kaplan, Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 38; Adler-Rudel, Jüdische Selbsthilfe, p. 28. 1\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\ncommunity, they were prohibited considerably earlier from taking part in cultural events.4 In addition to social exclusion, it was above all the emigration of numerous acquaintances or family members that intensified the isolation of those remaining in Germany. Michael Blumenthal, who grew up in Berlin and later became US Secretary of the Treasury, reports that in his family hardly any mention was made of emigration until 1937, but there was indeed talk of the daunting situation of those who had emigrated: ‘by early 1938 my parents could no longer avoid the truth. Their isolation from normal German life was nearly total, the degradations and the economic squeeze increased, and there was no longer any mistaking the ominous trend.’ By mid 1938, they were ‘under the gun’. With a heavy heart, they sold their business for a fraction of its actual worth to a former employee and ultimately emigrated to Shanghai. Victor Klemperer, who stayed in Germany, speculated at the time about his prospects after the end of the Third Reich: ‘Probably I would only then face the very greatest loneliness. Because I could never again trust anyone in Germany, never again feel myself uninhibitedly to be German.’5\n\nPreparation for War and Persecution of the Jews As a vague future project, conquest of ‘Lebensraum (living space) in the East’ was at the centre of National Socialist ideology from an early stage, but it was not until November 1937 that Hitler began to outline a firm strategy for achieving this objective. Due to the guarantees for Poland and Czechoslovakia, Germany’s eastward expansion could easily have led to war with Britain and France. For this reason, Hitler’s foreign-policy advisor Joachim von Ribbentrop, then German ambassador in London, had tried in the summer of 1937 to approach the goal of expansion towards the East by taking the diplomatic route. The German idea was that the British Empire was to remain inviolate for the time being, and as a quid pro quo the Reich would be given free rein in continental Europe, including expansion to the East. The British interlocutors rejected this idea. However, they did indicate their willingness to consider the demands concerning Austria, the Sudetenland, and Danzig. They continued to follow their course of appeasement, which pursued the objective of integrating Germany, with limited concessions, into a renewed European framework for lasting peace. In a complementary move, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt made it clear in his so-called Quarantine Speech of 5 October 1937 that the United States would not stand aside and tolerate Germany’s expansionist efforts and, in the event of war, would side with the British.6\n\nMarion A.

However, he was not willing to abandon the pursuit of his goals in exchange for British neutrality. On 5 November 1937, Hitler called together the leadership of the Wehrmacht, Minister of War Werner von Blomberg, Commander-inChief of the Air Force Hermann Göring, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Konstantin von Neurath for a secret meeting, at which he informed them of the possibility of war against Britain and France. As his war objective, Hitler cited the ‘solution to the problem of lack of space’. He outlined various plans for the incorporation of Czechoslovakia and Austria into the German Reich as initial steps on the road to establishing Germany’s position as a world power. This, he said, would ‘signify [a] gain of foodstuffs for five to six million people’, on condition that one million people would be forcibly resettled from Austria and two million from Czechoslovakia. The second step, the push towards the East in the direction of the Soviet Union, was to follow sometime between 1943 and 1945, once the German Wehrmacht was sufficiently rearmed and – after a victorious war in the West – battle-seasoned.7 In the subsequent discussion, Neurath, Blomberg, and Commander-in-Chief of the Army Baron Werner von Fritsch raised various objections. As a result, all three men were removed from office in the following months. In early 1938, Hitler did away with the post of minister of war and took personal command of the Wehrmacht. He placed the compliant Wilhelm Keitel at the head of the newly created High Command of the Wehrmacht, named Walther von Brauchitsch commander-in-chief of the army, and appointed Ribbentrop minister of foreign affairs. In addition, he dismissed twelve of the highest-ranking army and air force generals, replacing them with younger careerists, and staffed fifty-one other leadership positions in the Wehrmacht with new men.8 At the end of 1937, Hitler had removed Hjalmar Schacht from his post as minister of economics after Schacht had expressed increasingly forthright reservations about the extreme level of national debt resulting from the rapid arms build-up. After an interregnum with Göring in charge, Goebbels’s confidant Walther Funk was promoted to the position of minister of economics. One year later, Funk took over – also from Schacht and for the same reason – the additional post of Reichsbank president. The economic boom in the Reich after 1933 was based on dubious financial policies. In fact, labour, raw materials, and foreign exchange were all in short supply. The concentration of all construction resources on expanding the Siegfried Line fortifications along Germany’s western frontier and developing other military projects brought both residential and motorway construction almost to a standstill. The focusing of all production on war led to shortages in consumer goods, particularly in the supply of butter and meat. At the same time, full employment, overtime, and concealed wage hikes had fuelled Hitler’s remarks were written down by Colonel Friedrich Hoßbach: The Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal, Nuremberg, 14 November 1945 – 1 October 1946, vol. 25 (Nuremberg: Secretariat of the Tribunal, 1947), doc. 386-PS, pp. 402–413; Bradley Smith, ‘Die Überlieferung der Hoßbach-Niederschrift im Lichte neuer Quellen’, Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte, vol. 38 (1990), pp. 329–336; Gerhard L.

In response to this dilemma, the government resorted to measures such as pay freezes, compulsory labour service, and propaganda promising a bright future. In addition, it intensified the harassment of Jews with a view to pursuing Aryanization. In the main, however, Hitler succeeded in using his high-risk foreign-policy gamble, the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland, to obscure the domestic political crisis.9 The main problem of the German economy was the shortage of foreign currency. To prepare for war, important raw materials for arms production had to be imported and the Reich grain reserves envisaged by the Four-Year Plan had to be increased to the point where, in the event of war, they would constitute a reliable safeguard against the anticipated British naval blockade. As his speech at the aforementioned secret meeting on 5 November 1937 indicates, Hitler took the question of wartime food supply very seriously. In his view, the Reich had lost the First World War primarily because of the British naval blockade of food. Hunger had then led to mass protests in Germany and thus prompted the ‘stab in the back’ that civilians on the home front inflicted on the combat front, ‘undefeated on the battlefield’. In the coming war, too, only about 80 per cent of the German population’s food requirements could be supplied by the domestic agricultural sector. The remainder had to be stockpiled or taken away from others.10 In the early years of National Socialist rule, the economic boom and rearmament had been ensured by means of a financial policy involving so-called Mefo bills, a special system of financing through deferred payment devised by Hjalmar Schacht. Twelve million Reichsmarks of Mefo bills were in circulation by early 1938 and were issued in the name of a dummy company, the Metallurgical Research Corporation (Mefo). In early 1938, when the first bills were due, there was a risk that payment could not be honoured. New financial tricks were thus required – this time in the face of Schacht’s opposition. The possibility of financing the arms build-up over the long term and placing corresponding government bonds in the domestic capital market did not exist, because in 1938 most cash-rich Germans were not willing to voluntarily lend money to the bankrupt National Socialist state. In times of extreme national debt, the Reichsbank even had to buy up Reich bonds on the Berlin Stock Exchange – in July 1938 alone, in the amount of 465 million Reichsmarks – to prevent a stock market slump that would have exposed to the world the domestic loss of confidence in the Third Reich.11 Dietrich Eichholtz, ‘Rüstungskonjunktur und Rüstungskrise: Bemerkungen zu materiellen und finanziellen Problemen der wirtschaftlichen Kriegsvorbereitung’, in Werner Röhr, Brigitte Berlekamp, and Karl Heinz Roth (eds.), Der Krieg vor dem Krieg: Politik und Ökonomik der ‘friedlichen’ Aggressionen Deutschlands 1938/39 (Hamburg: VSA, 2001), pp. 98–117, here p. 104; Adam Tooze, The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy (London: Allen Lane, 2006), pp. 255–258. 10 Götz Aly and Susanne Heim, Architects of Annihilation: Auschwitz and the Logic of Destruction, trans.

During the preceding years, Jewish businessmen had been ruined or forced to sell their companies, but for foreign and domestic economic reasons those responsible were still hesitant to prohibit the Jews from engaging in all business activity. In 1938 that changed. In the spring of 1938, tax reductions for people with children and various social benefit payments, such as marriage and maternity benefits, were cancelled for Jews.12 On 1 March, the Reich Ministry of Economics definitively prohibited the awarding of public contracts to Jewish firms. From 1 April 1938, the Law on the Legal Status of the Jewish Religious Communities deprived the Jewish communities of the status of corporations under public law (Doc. 23). This had serious financial implications, as the communities now no longer had the same tax advantages that were granted to Christian religious communities. Henceforth they had to pay taxes on the communities’ properties – synagogues, cemeteries, and charitable organizations. At the same time, the communities’ income sharply decreased as a result of the pauperization of their members, while the expenditure for social welfare constantly climbed owing to the exclusion of Jews from public welfare. In addition, this law stripped the communities of the right to impose their own taxes. This arbitrary state measure caused horror among those who worked as employees or volunteers in the communities. They interpreted it as a sign that ‘the final hour of German Jewry had come’.13 In July 1938 the Law on the Amendment of the Commercial Code was enacted.14 It banned Jews from the real estate business and property administration, as well as the fairground trade and peddling. Many formerly self-employed businessmen and laid-off blue- and white-collar workers had sought refuge precisely in these occupations and thus aggravated non-Jewish competitors. With the Fourth Regulation to the Reich Citizenship Law, Jewish physicians lost their licence to practise medicine with effect from 30 September 1938 (Doc. 76).15 A few were allowed to continue working as ‘practitioners for the sick’ (Krankenbehandler) but could provide medical care only to Jewish patients. In Berlin, of the 1,623 Jewish doctors still practising in the summer of 1938, 426 received this disparaging occupational designation. Two months later, something similar befell Jewish lawyers.

First, if the Jews were to remain compliant, they must ‘still [have] something to lose’. Second, their forced migration was to be accelerated by stripping them, little by little, of the tangible necessities of life.17 In the summer months of 1938, the labelling of Jewish businesses in various cities of the Reich provided the impetus for violent attacks on Jews. Mostly it was members of the Storm Troopers (SA) or the Nazi Party (NSDAP) who threatened Jewish shopkeepers, verbally abused or denounced non-Jewish patrons, and thus contributed to the polarization of everyday life. The local authorities occasionally reacted to the antisemitic sentiment stirred up in this way by issuing anti-Jewish rules that were applicable in a particular area, even before the enactment of corresponding regulations that were uniform throughout the Reich. Standardized identifying marks for Jewish shops had already been devised by that time, but their introduction was postponed for the time being upon Hitler’s intervention.18 The National Socialist activists therefore limited their actions initially to smearing the shops of Jews with paint to identify them as such. In Berlin, however, Jewish shopkeepers had to put their name in letters 25 centimetres high on the display windows at eye level and to all intents and purposes mark their own premises as Jewish operations (Doc. 120). The SS Security Service (SD) reported that ‘the operations against Jewish shops’ had ‘in many cases advanced the process of the Aryanization of the Jewish businesses’ and ‘the idea to emigrate and the will for emigration have been significantly strengthened’.19 The most important regulation to terminate German Jews’ economic activities and bring about their subsequent dispossession had been drawn up in Austria immediately after the Anschluss, before the end of March 1938. At Göring’s urging, it was introduced throughout the Reich on 26 April 1938. It stated that Jews (and, where applicable, their non-Jewish spouses) had to report their assets in detail to the relevant tax authority if the total value exceeded 5,000 Reichsmarks (Doc. 29).20 The official at the Reich Ministry\n\n16 17\n\n18\n\n19 20\n\nBarkai, From Boycott, pp. 121–122; Fifth Regulation to the Reich Citizenship Law, 27 Sept. 1938, Reichsgesetzblatt, 1938, I, pp. 1403–1406.

(By way of comparison, the Reich’s regular revenues amounted to around 17 billion Reichsmarks in the fiscal year 1938.) The property of non-Jewish spouses and possessions in Germany belonging to Jews of foreign citizenship were regarded as ‘unassailable’, at least for the time being.21 However, foreign Jews now had to obtain official permission for purchases and leases, or risk substantial penalties. As a result, foreigners too fell within the scope of German racial legislation. It is significant that the Regulation on the Registration of Jewish Assets issued on 26 April gave Plenipotentiary for the Four-Year Plan Göring the power to determine how the ‘assets subject to the registration requirement would be utilized’. In plain terms, this meant that the German Jews would be forced by the state to invest all their available assets in Reich war bonds. They were not formally dispossessed but rather deprived of the power to control their property. Göring explained the procedure as follows: ‘The Jew is excluded from the economy and assigns his assets to the state. He is compensated in return. The compensation is noted in the debt register, and it earns interest at a set rate.’ The Jews, ‘pensioned off ’, were to live off this interest (Doc. 146). ‘For only then’, Göring stated elsewhere, ‘is it possible to carry out the Führer’s arms programme.’22 It soon became apparent how closely interrelated the seizure of Jewish assets was with the national debt and the foreign exchange shortage, which obstructed the preparations for war. Six days before the Jews were required to hand in their declarations of assets on 31 July 1938, Göring ordered the tax offices to examine these forms ‘with the greatest expedition’ in the search for foreign securities. Then the owners were forced to offer these securities to the Reichsbank for purchase. As a result, many millions of US dollars, British pounds sterling, and Swiss francs flowed into the German war chest in autumn 1938. In the case of the foreign exchange handover as well, the property of the affected Jews was not formally expropriated. They received the officially determined ‘equivalent value’ in the Reichsmark currency, which had become internationally worthless.23 From the perspective of those who were pressing ahead with the economic disenfranchisement of the Jews, Aryanization accomplished three objectives: first, it made possible immediate or future expropriation for the benefit of the German state; second, it served the interests of Aryan medium-sized companies and small tradesmen by limiting their Jewish business competition; third, isolation, humiliation, and exclusion were intended to make life unbearable for Jews in Germany and force them to emigrate. The goal of all these measures was the rapid pauperization of the Jewish population, yet this very pauperization interfered with the other aim of anti-Jewish policy: mass\n\nSecret Decree III Jd. 29/38 of the Reich Ministry of Economics, 25 July 1938, cited in A.

Those Jews who still owned a certain amount of assets had the best chances of emigrating, while those who were destitute, in whose expulsion the institutions of persecution had a particular interest, ran the risk of having to remain in Germany. The German government solved its self-created conflict between the objectives of expropriation and expulsion in its own fashion: it combined expropriation with selective and systematic terror.\n\nThe Concentration Camp System After Heinrich Himmler had become chief of the German police in June 1936, he initiated the construction of a new system of concentration camps. By summer 1937, he had closed the protective custody camps (Schutzhaftlager) used in the early years of National Socialist rule. Only Dachau concentration camp near Munich remained in place, and he had it substantially enlarged. In 1936 he had the Sachsenhausen concentration camp built in Oranienburg, near Berlin, describing it as a ‘completely new, modern and contemporary concentration camp, which can be expanded at any time’.24 This was the first in a series of camps of a new type, which were designed for a considerably larger volume of prisoners. In 1938 the Inspectorate of the Concentration Camps moved to Oranienburg. From there it administered all the concentration camps as well as the SS Death’s Head Units, which Himmler vastly reinforced and reorganized, transforming them from guard forces into militarily and ideologically trained units. In 1937 and 1938 additional camps were opened in Buchenwald near Weimar and Flossenbürg in eastern Bavaria. A few months after the Anschluss, the first concentration camp on Austrian territory, in Mauthausen near Linz, followed,25 and in May 1939 the women’s concentration camp in Ravensbrück was added. Though the SS initially used the concentration camps primarily to terrorize and intimidate domestic political opponents, this function was pushed into the background with the consolidation of National Socialist dominance. From 1936 the Gestapo, together with the Criminal Police, targeted so-called asocials (Asoziale), professional criminals and repeat offenders, people whose work habits and social behaviour did not conform to expected norms. In 1936 and 1937 the Gestapo, with the cooperation of the Criminal Police, sent more than 3,000 beggars, homeless people, prostitutes, and repeat offenders to the concentration camps.26 Himmler’s Decree on Preventive Measures by the Police to Combat Crime, issued on 14 December 1937, provided a cloak of legality for the arrests\n\nCited in Karin Orth, Das System der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager: Eine politische Organisationsgeschichte (Hamburg: Hamburger Edition, 1999), p. 36. 25 Florian Freund and Bertrand Perz, ‘Mauthausen – Stammlager’, in Wolfgang Benz and Barbara Distel (eds.), Der Ort des Terrors: Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager, vol. 4 (Munich: Beck, 2006), pp. 293–346; Michel Fabréguet, Camp de concentration national-socialiste en Autriche rattachée (1938–1945) (Paris: H.

After the employment offices had reported persons who were ‘unwilling to work’ to the Gestapo, Gestapo officials arrested between 1,500 and 2,000 persons in the last week of April 1938 and transferred them to Buchenwald concentration camp.27 The next mass arrests followed in June and were primarily directed against the homeless, beggars, and those suspected of procurement. This time the Criminal Police, aided and provided with lists by the employment and welfare offices, made the arrests. On the orders of Reinhard Heydrich, at least 200 men who were deemed to be asocials were to be taken into preventive custody in each Criminal Police regional headquarters district (Docs. 31, 88). The number of those actually arrested plainly exceeded the imposed minimum: in total, around 10,000 persons were taken to Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, and Dachau. In both April and June, care was taken to ensure that those arrested were fit for work. The victims of the ‘June Operation’ also included 1,500 Jews who had criminal records or were known to the police because of minor offences, often from years earlier.28 In the first few days of the operation, the grounds for the arrests were still completely unclear. No one knew the criteria according to which unsuspecting individuals were suddenly taken away by the police or where they were taken, and the lack of information led to widespread anxiety. It particularly affected the family members and friends of those Jews who were held for weeks in isolation in the Sachsenhausen camp, with no contact with the outside world. In Buchenwald concentration camp, the detainees were at least allowed to give their family members a sign of life after two weeks.29 Those who were newly incarcerated had to perform extremely strenuous forced labour, which even robust men could not keep up for long.30 In Buchenwald, where 7,850 persons, including around 1,250 Jews, were imprisoned after the ‘June Operation’, an average of six to eight prisoners per day are said to have died, either as a result of ill-treatment or general exhaustion or because they fell into despair and threw themselves against the electrified barbed-wire fence of the camp.\n\nKlaus Drobisch and Günther Wieland, System der NS-Konzentrationslager 1933–1939 (Berlin: Akademie, 1993), pp. 284–286; Wolfgang Ayaß, ‘Asoziale’ im Nationalsozialismus (Stuttgart: KlettCotta, 1995), pp. 140–147.

During those weeks, it was reported from Buchenwald: A Jew, while carrying stones, had taken hold of a stone that weighed around forty pounds. After this he was shouted at, told to just put the thing down and look for a bigger stone. As the Jew was walking away, the guard picked up the smaller stone and hurled it with all his might at the Jew; it struck the Jew on the back of the neck, and he died on the spot. In other ways too, prisoners continually die from the direct consequences of abuse. For example, in July one of the Jewish prisoners died from a double fracture of the renal pelvis, caused by being kicked.\n\nPrisoners who showed signs of exhaustion had to expect the heaviest camp penalties for ‘insubordination’. Among the most brutal punishments, inflicted on Jewish prisoners in particular, was the ‘gallows’: the man selected for torture had his hands tied together behind his back and was then strung up from a tree branch until he lost consciousness.31 In the period between November 1936 and the beginning of November 1938, the number of concentration camp prisoners increased fivefold, to 24,000. While predominantly so-called work-shy (arbeitsscheu) individuals and career criminals were imprisoned in Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen, in the summer of 1938, 4,155 of the 5,500 prisoners in Dachau were sent there for political reasons. The vast majority were Austrians.32 The development of the concentration camps into centres for forced labour was intended to act as a general deterrent and to improve work ethic across the board. This development coincided with the construction projects associated with the plans for a colossal reshaping of Berlin and other cities.33 In Sachsenhausen and its subcamp Neuengamme, the SS set up a brickworks. Himmler and Oswald Pohl, head of the SS Economic Administration, selected a quarry as the site for the Mauthausen camp, and quarries were also chosen as the locations for Flossenbürg concentration camp and Groß-Rosen concentration camp. The site for the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in Alsace was presumably selected on the basis of a suggestion by Albert Speer, whose attention was attracted by the granite deposits there during a tour of inspection in 1940.

Accordingly, the SD men who were in charge of the ‘Jewish question’ were at first concerned primarily with the surveillance of Jewish organizations and individuals. In the early stage of its activity, the SD had been repeatedly reconfigured. From 1936, SD Office II (Domestic) contained Central Department II/1, which tracked the activities of ‘ideological adversaries’ of National Socialism. Subordinate to it was Main Department II/11, which kept the churches and Jews under surveillance. Department II 111 investigated the Freemasons, Department II 112 the German Jews, and Department II 113 ‘denominational political trends’, in particular political Catholicism. Department II 112, soon termed the Department for Jewish Affairs, was subdivided into the sections ‘Assimilationists’ (II 1121), ‘Orthodox and Charitable Jews’ (II 1122), and ‘Zionists’ (II 1123). While the leadership of Department II 112 changed several times between 1935 and 1938, Adolf Eichmann, who had worked in the SD Main Office since 1934, remained in charge of the Zionist affairs section throughout. This ensured the continuity of the SD’s role in the persecution of the Jews.35 Beginning in autumn 1937, Herbert Hagen ran the SD’s Department for Jewish Affairs. Alongside Eichmann, the department was staffed by Dieter Wisliceny and Theodor Dannecker. Gathered together in the same organization, therefore, were the four men who substantially shaped the SD’s anti-Jewish policies in the occupied and allied countries over the next seven years, including the practices of deportation and destruction. They not only observed but also developed concepts for the speediest possible dissimilation and expulsion of the Jews. During the period preceding the start of the Second World War, this resulted, on the one hand, in promoting Zionism and lending support to efforts to emigrate and, on the other hand, in repressing the strong assimilationist forces present in German Jewry. Under Hagen’s management, Section II 112 laid claim to a ‘certain intellectual leadership’. His employees submitted comments on the anti-Jewish measures that were devised by the ministerial bureaucracy. With growing assertiveness, they also intervened with other authorities, as in the case of the ‘Guidelines for Dealing with Jews and Jewish Matters’, issued in July 1938 by Count von Helldorf, Berlin’s chief of police. In the document, von Helldorf enumerated the legal means by which Jews in Berlin could be discriminated against and intimidated (Doc. 68). His stated objective was ‘to compel the Jews to emigrate, not simply to harass them haphazardly with no prospect of achieving this outcome’. The directive was preceded by a lengthy discussion initiated by the power-\n\n35\n\nOn the organizational structure and development of the Jewish policies of the SD and Eichmann’s role, see Klaus Drobisch, ‘Die Judenreferate des Geheimen Staatspolizeiamtes und des Sicherheitsdienstes der SS 1933 bis 1939’, Jahrbuch für Antisemitismusforschung, vol. 2 (1992), pp. 230–254; Michael Wildt (ed.), Die Judenpolitik des SD 1935 bis 1938: Eine Dokumentation (Munich: Oldenbourg, 1995); Hans Safrian, Eichmann’s Men, new edn, trans.

The SD officials successfully rejected Goebbels’s expulsion scheme because it was aimed solely at the Reich capital and would deny the Jews further possibilities to earn a living, but without improving their prospects of emigration. Increasingly, the SD’s specialists for Jewish affairs also claimed executive powers, which until then had been the preserve of the Gestapo Central Office (Gestapa). They summoned the representatives of Jewish organizations to report on activities and instructed them to expedite the emigration of the Jews or to make Jewish forced labourers available (Doc. 295). At the insistence of the SD, all Jews who were foreign nationals were removed not only from top positions but also from ordinary employment in Jewish organizations.36 At times, confusion arose over the priority of Jewish emigration, as when the Reich Foreign Office advocated curtailing emigration to Palestine because it regarded the founding of a Jewish state, now within reach, as a danger. On another occasion in spring 1938, Himmler briefly took the position that ‘Germany [should] not let go of the Jews, its most valuable collateral’, in other words, should keep them as hostages.37 Hitler too hinted at the possibility of hostage-taking when he announced in his speech to the Reichstag at the end of January 1939: if the international Jewish financiers within and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, the outcome will not be the Bolshevization of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but rather the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe. (Doc. 248)38\n\nAll in all, over the course of 1938 the SD’s specialists for Jewish affairs succeeded in placing the push for emigration at the centre of the government’s anti-Jewish policy, thereby avoiding the feared stagnation of the Jewish exodus. The Anschluss of Austria offered a welcome opportunity to display initiative. Two days after the entry of German soldiers, Eichmann and Hagen travelled to Vienna. There, Eichmann ran the Central Office for Jewish Emigration (Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung), which the SD had called for as early as 1937.39 (Its workings are described below, pp. 40–41.) It functioned so efficiently that after only a few months it became the model for the Reich Central Agency for Jewish Emigration (Reichszentrale für jüdische Auswanderung) in Berlin and later for the central offices in Prague and Amsterdam.40 On 24 January 1939, Göring assigned the leadership of the Reich Central Agency to Heydrich, the chief of the Security Police (Doc. 243), and thus helped Heydrich’s SS and police organization attain a dominant position in Jewish policy.

In Berlin, Eichmann had not played a pre-eminent role on the SD staff. With his transfer to Vienna, a new stage in his career began. It was here that he asserted his claim that the SD or the Central Office for Jewish Emigration, as opposed to the Vienna Gestapo, should have the final say in all matters of Jewish policy.41 While the SD had still assisted the Gestapo in the Old Reich and advised it regarding anti-Jewish policy, after the Anschluss of Austria Eichmann and his colleagues were presented with an opportunity to take control themselves. In Berlin they had been generators of ideas for Jewish policy, but in Vienna they became executors of such policy.42 Most Jews were less afraid of the SD, which, as an intelligence service, operated more in the background, than of the Gestapo. The Gestapo’s officials searched apartments, conducted raids on Jewish institutions, issued instructions to Jewish representatives, and took individuals into ‘protective custody’. The Gestapo was the central institution of state terror, and the Jews, regarded by the National Socialist authorities as the embodiment of the public enemy, had more to fear than all other Germans.43 The precursor of the Gestapo was the Political Police in the Weimar Republic, and Gestapo officials came predominantly from the regular police service, and only rarely from ideologically influenced Nazi special formations. After the National Socialist assumption of power, there had been no extensive purge of the police force, but at the leadership level there were numerous personnel reshuffles. At first the Political Police in Prussia were still under the authority of the Regierungspräsidenten (district governors). From spring 1934 it answered exclusively and directly to the Prussian Minister President, Göring. The number of personnel grew quickly: in 1934, around 2,000 police belonged to the Gestapo, in 1938, around 7,000, and in 1944, 31,000.44 Though it had been the\n\nIn summer 1939, Eichmann demanded that the head of the Israelite Religious Community of Vienna (IKG), Josef Löwenherz, ensure that all applications by Jewish organizations were submitted first to the Central Office for Jewish Emigration; the Gestapo took Löwenherz to task on that account. After a tug of war lasting several days, the power struggle ended in compromise: applications dealing with emigration were to be addressed to the Central Office; the Gestapo had decision-making power regarding the authorization of prayer events and organizational matters: See Josef Israel Löwenherz, Vollständiger Bericht von Dr. Löwenherz über die Tätigkeit Eichmanns und Brunners in Wien–Prag–Berlin, ed.

In the understanding of Werner Best, who, as Heydrich’s deputy, repeatedly wrote about the relationship between police practice and the National Socialist programme, the Gestapo was supposed to monitor the ‘political health of the German racial corpus’ and to use all possible means to combat any ‘symptoms of disease’ in it. It was from this mandate that the Gestapo derived its concept of acting in a preventive way that was, to the greatest possible extent, free of legal constraints and supervisory authorities. This range of action included the imposition of ‘protective custody’, the infliction of torture, and, when considered necessary, murder.45 In June 1936, when Heinrich Himmler was named chief of the German Police, he transferred the leadership of the Main Office of the Security Police to Reinhard Heydrich, who was already running the Gestapo, and thus made him the chief executive of the Criminal Police as well. In addition to the Criminal Police, the Gestapo could draw on the support of other police authorities to which it was authorized to issue directives. When there were large arrest operations, the gendarmerie, urban police, or municipal police frequently acted on behalf of the Gestapo. Both the Polish Jews deported in October 1938 and those persons arrested during the November pogroms were usually marched off by officials of the Order Police, who did not always perform their task with great zeal. In addition to the ordinary police prisons, the Gestapo had its own ‘in-house prisons’ in larger cities. It could also put prisoners into the work education camps (Arbeitserziehungslager), which were under its control. In the concentration camps, which were administered separately within the SS organization, the Gestapo men established the rule of terror by means of the Political Departments. Despite its strong position in the National Socialist power structure, the Gestapo was capable of uninterrupted surveillance only to a limited extent. This was due, first, to the scope of its duties, which ranged from the surveillance of communists and Catholic activists to the persecution of homosexuals and the disciplining of millions of forced labourers during the war. Second, the Gestapo faced the challenge of procuring information. It depended on paid undercover informants and volunteer or casual informers. More than half of all the investigation proceedings initiated by the Gestapo were traceable to the latter, and they often soon proved unfounded. Anyone who had once attracted the attention of the Gestapo, even if the original suspicion proved incorrect, had to expect that his or her private life would be scrutinized in the greatest detail and that relatives, friends, and colleagues would be interrogated. The outcome was often ‘protective custody’ for an indefinite period until the matter was settled.46 In autumn 1939, the Jewish policies of the SD and the Gestapo were finally combined in the newly established Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) under the leadership of Reinhard Heydrich, who until then had been the chief of the Security Police.\n\n45 46\n\nHerbert, Best, pp. 163–180.

Their situation differed from that of the German Jews in two major respects: their share of the population was around four times as large as in the Old Reich (2.83 per cent and 0.76 per cent, respectively),47 and they were considerably poorer on average. The number of Jews had increased rapidly with industrialization and the growth of the city of Vienna. In 1870, 40,000 Jews lived there, in 1890, around 120,000 and in 1920, approximately 200,000, yet their share of the population remained relatively constant at just under 9 per cent.48 During the 1848 Revolution, the Jewish intelligentsia had taken the side of the liberal middle class and fought for universal civil rights.49 Well into the 1850s, ‘commerce provided virtually the only career open to Viennese Jews unwilling to convert to Christianity’,50 but this occupational pattern gradually changed as legal and social barriers fell. In the period between emancipation in 1867 and the year 1910, some tens of thousands of Jews moved to Vienna from the eastern borderlands of the Habsburg Monarchy, specifically from Galicia and Bukovina. The majority of the immigrants were very poor and Orthodox in their approach to Judaism. For the most part, even after moving to Vienna they retained their cultural identity and the style of dress and life characteristic of the shtetl.51 Some of them, however, made remarkable progress in their working lives in the Vienna of the so-called Gründerzeit, the period of industrial and urban expansion in the second half of the nineteenth century: from small trader to family-owned manufacturing firm to industrialist, from ‘rag-seller Jew’ to textile manufacturer. Other new arrivals from all parts of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy now surged into the liberal professions, which had long been off limits to Jews. They became doctors and lawyers, stockbrokers, journalists. Like the Jews in Berlin, Warsaw, or Budapest, the Viennese Jews, in their pronounced desire for education, differed from the Christian majority population. In 1912, one in three Viennese grammar school (Gymnasium) pupils was a Jew, three times more than would have been commensurate with the Jewish share of the population. Around 1900, whereas only 5.3 per cent of the Christians in a given age group attended university (excluding the discipline of theology), the corresponding figure among the Jews was 24.5 per cent. In Vienna and at the German University in Prague, they constituted almost one third of the students.52 47\n\n48\n\n49\n\n50 51 52\n\nThe Jüdisches Lexikon, published from 1927, gives much higher figures.

The Wednesday Psychological Society that gathered around Sigmund Freud, and had many Jews among its members, attained international renown, as did the Vienna Circle, which brought together philosophers and social scientists such as Otto Neurath, Rudolf Goldscheid, Hans Hahn, and Philipp Frank. Numerous Jewish intellectuals found their political home in one of the socialist circles and among the theoreticians of Austro-Marxism, such as Rudolf Hilferding and Otto Bauer. Or they became involved in the social reform movements that championed women’s rights, pacifism or improved public education. Hans Kelsen developed his ‘pure theory of law’ in Vienna; Arnold Schönberg, the twelve-tone technique of composition. In the interwar period, Stefan Zweig regularly invited fellow writers such as Robert Musil, Joseph Roth, and Franz Werfel to his apartment in Vienna for discussions. Jews were decisive in developing private cultural patronage, though this involvement brought some of them to the brink of ruin, including Fritz Warndörfer, the son of a textile manufacturer and the backer of the Wiener Werkstätte design collective. Because of its many Jewish patrons, the Vienna Secession art movement, with which Gustav Klimt, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Ernst Stöhr, and others were associated, was characterized as a goût juif, a ‘Jewish taste’.53 Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Austrian antisemitism, based on earlier forms influenced by religious considerations, became a mass movement. Journalists interpreted the stock exchange crash of 1873 and the subsequent crisis as ‘requital’ for the emancipation of the Jews and polemicized against the alleged robbing of the Christians by Jewish speculators.54 In 1878 the first Viennese student fraternity excluded its Jewish members because, even if baptized, they were not to be regarded as Germans. Theodor Herzl left the duelling fraternity Albia after the students passed a resolution in 1880 stating that henceforth no Jews should be accepted as members. ‘Those who were members already’, Herzl reports in an autobiographical sketch, ‘were kindly permitted to remain part of the fraternity. I said farewell to these noble youths.’55 Antisemitism spread rapidly throughout the clubs and associations. In April 1908, for example, the Lower Austrian Gymnastics Association celebrated the twentieth anniversary of its ‘deJewification’ (Entjudung) with a ‘festive gymnastics display’. In reaction to the discrimination, Jews established associations of their own. For example, in 1883 Jewish university students founded the duelling fraternity Kadimah, whose members were mostly Zionists, in order to defend Jewish honour, if necessary, in duels. The emergence of the antisemitic Christian Social Association (Christlich-Sozialer Verein) at the end of the 1880s offered a political home to many Austrian antisemites. The leading light of this association, which soon became a political party, was Karl Lueger (1844–1910), later mayor of Vienna. The son of a school caretaker and disabled war veteran, Lueger succeeded in obtaining a doctorate in law. Before he switched to politics, Beller, Vienna and the Jews, pp. 14–32.

He contended successfully for the position of mayor of Vienna as a tribune of the people, someone who was familiar with the social adversity that existed in the rapidly growing metropolis. He championed the majority of the city’s inhabitants who lived in poverty and was known for making witty remarks, being plain-spoken, endorsing a patriarchal social Catholicism, and delivering unreservedly anti-Jewish speeches. ‘The influence on the masses’, he asserted in 1899: in our country, is in the hands of the Jews, the greatest part of the press is in their hands, by far the greatest part of all capital, especially high finance, is in Jewish hands, and the Jews practise a kind of terrorism here that is the worst imaginable. For us in Austria, therefore, it is a matter of liberating Christian people from the ascendancy of Jewry.56\n\nLueger’s adversary Georg Ritter von Schönerer (1842–1921) was of a similar political ilk. He too had begun his political career as a liberal in 1875 but shifted his allegiance a few years later to the German nationalist movement. He too adopted the role of populist antisemite. He advocated a racially-based hatred of Jews and found approval particularly among Viennese students. As an anti-Catholic and Bismarck admirer who favoured the idea of Greater Germany, however, he was unable to establish an enduring political movement in the Austria of that time. Lueger, in contrast, emerged as a staunch Austrian, whose antisemitism was built not on racial categories but rather on Christian and social anger against the ‘Christ killers’ and ‘money Jews’. Lueger became a successful Austrian politician and modernizer, and he defined Vienna’s politics as mayor from 1897 until his death in 1910. After an election loss in 1907, Schönerer withdrew to his country estate and died in 1921. With their differing approaches, both were among the role models of the young Adolf Hitler, then a resident of Vienna.57 Alongside the Christian Social Party, founded in 1891, the Social Democrats were the second great political power in Austria in the late nineteenth century. They too opposed liberalism and, to that end, occasionally allied themselves with the Christian Social Party. Though antisemitic agitation in Austria was the work primarily of the political right, antiJewish tones could be heard now and then in the Social Democrats’ critique of capitalism, too, such as when Social Democrat publications referred to the ‘friendly relations’ between ‘rabid antisemites’ and ‘bank Jews’ and made use of the cliché of the ‘stock exchange Jew’. At times the impoverished Ostjuden (‘Eastern Jews’) also came to the attention of the Social Democrats’ Arbeiter-Zeitung, which characterized them as a ‘quaint apparition in a long, dirty, black silk coat with tails of animals on a velvet cap’.58 Joseph Roth summed it Cited in Hamann, Hitlers Wien, p. 411.

For members of the Christian Social Party, they are Jews. For German nationalists, they are Semites. For Social Democrats, they are non-productive elements.’59 From the perspective of the Social Democrats, the political Zionists and the Orthodox Jews who had emigrated from Galicia were relics of bygone times. The Austrian Jews made a stand against the rampant antisemitism. The strongest force of Jewish self-defence was the so-called integrationists, who banded together in 1886 to form the Austrian-Israelite Union (OIU). Like the Central Association of German Citizens of the Jewish Faith (CV) in Germany, they espoused an awareness of Jewish identity and the right of Jews to defend themselves against antisemitic attacks. At the same time, they tried to bind the Jewish population to a ‘genuine Austrian patriotism’.60 In many associations, notably in the Israelite Religious Community of Vienna (IKG), the Austrian-Israelite Union competed with the Zionists and other Jewish nationalists for the role of opinion leader. While the Zionists made the case for founding a Jewish state in Palestine, the diaspora nationalists regarded the demand for national Jewish autonomy within Austria as the appropriate response to antisemitism. With the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 that established the AustroHungarian Dual Monarchy, Hungarians gained a large measure of autonomy in the resulting multinational state. Contrary to expectations, this development did not alleviate ethnic conflicts. The Czechs, Poles, Romanians, Croatians, and Germans now really began the struggle for greater independence, initially with the support of the Jews living in the respective regions. Because the individual nationalist movements intensified mutual hostility and simultaneously became ever more antisemitic, the increasingly isolated Jews finally championed a united, strong Austria more decisively than any of the other minorities. As the historian Werner Cahnman reasoned, the Jews were ‘the only Austrians in Austria’.61 After the First World War, the Republic of Austria rose from the ruins of the Habsburg Empire. The new republic comprised only one eighth of the territory once ruled by the Dual Monarchy. The multinational state of Austria-Hungary had numbered 53 million inhabitants; the First Austrian Republic had barely 7 million. The majority of the citizens were German Austrians, and they were convinced that their greatly scaleddown country was not economically viable and that the Treaty of Saint-Germain from 1919 was intolerable. As in Germany, pronounced revisionist tendencies developed as a consequence of defeat in the First World War. In addition, economic hardship increased the dissatisfaction: hunger in the large cities, a dearth of heating fuel, a housing shortage, overcrowded hospitals, an inoperative infrastructure, hundreds of thousands of unemployed people, and tens of thousands of refugees.62 In addition, the Spanish flu had also swept through Austria in the winter of 1918–1919 and claimed thousands of victims.

In Vienna, Jakob Reumann became the first Social Democratic mayor to control the fate of the city. Despite the substantial successes that ‘Red Vienna’ soon achieved in the socio-political sphere, the social tensions, and with them a form of antisemitism directed specifically against the Ostjuden, continued to have an effect. In September 1921, the Wiener Morgenzeitung characterized the atmosphere: Since the collapse, the good people of Austria have condensed everything into the little word ‘Ostjude’. It is a wondrous expression, which alleviates every pain and takes away every shame. […] Complaints over the rising cost of bread, and the falling morals of women, over bad railway transportation, the lack of coal, the unruliness of school children and the watering down of milk find their solution: out with the Ostjuden!63\n\nThe Christian Social Party, whose prominent member Anton Jerzabek was also the head of the League of Anti-Semites (Antisemitenbund) used greatly exaggerated numerical data to justify its demand for deportation of the Ostjuden. Occasionally such proposals also found a sympathetic ear among the Social Democrats. The housing space thus freed up was expected to benefit homeless Viennese families.64 However vehement, Austrian antisemitism, as the historian Peter Pulzer emphasizes, was primarily demagogic and verbally radical. Yet it was not backed up by a politically practicable concept. This situation changed with the rise of the Austrian National Socialists. They incorporated into their propaganda of national revolution the old prejudices against Jews, which had always been kept alive in Austria, and in this way they poisoned the political climate: ‘Whatever was unwelcome merely had to be labelled as Jewish. Liberalism thus became “Jewish liberalism”, the newspapers the “Jewish press” and the First Republic the “Jewish Republic”.’65 In 1933 the Austrian National Socialists also saw themselves on the brink of seizing power. Their offensive struck the Jews at a moment of social and political weakness. During the period from 1923 to 1934, the Jewish population of Vienna had shrunk by just under one seventh, because the number of births had sharply declined, and many members had emigrated or withdrawn from the religious community.66 In 1932 the Austrian-Israelite Union, eager for integration, had lost its supremacy within the Israelite Religious Community of Vienna to the Zionists, who now assumed important positions in the Jewish institutions. At the university, a stronghold of antisemitism, Zionist student organizations enjoyed an increasing influx of new members and fought\n\n63 64 65 66\n\nWiener Morgenzeitung, 21 Sept. 1921, p. 1, cited in Pauley, From Prejudice to Persecution, p. 80.

In 1933 Federal Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß dissolved the parliament and continued to govern by emergency decree. He declared Austria a ‘corporate state’ (Ständestaat) and banned all political parties, with the exception of the Fatherland Front, in which the Christian Social Party members had joined together with various paramilitary groups. The Austrian Jews were sympathetic towards the Dollfuß regime, especially as it appeared to offer them protection against German expansionist efforts and Austrian ambitions for union with Germany. Dollfuß had banned the Austrian counterpart to the NSDAP along with all the other political parties and he rejected union with Germany. After his assassination in 1934, appreciative obituaries appeared in Jewish newspapers.69 Like Dollfuß, his successor Kurt Schuschnigg emphasized his rejection of antisemitism and reaffirmed that Jews in Austria were due the same rights as all other citizens. In 1934 he banned the antisemitic newspaper Der Stürmer. That same year, several representatives of the Austrian Jews were appointed to important federal and regional offices.70 In 1937 Schuschnigg prevented the Salzburg regional government from prohibiting kosher slaughter. Nonetheless, antisemitism distinctly intensified in Austria in the mid 1930s. The Antisemitic League developed an active propaganda campaign, and with increasing frequency Jews had to expect that they would be turned away as guests in Austrian resorts and rejected as tenants by antisemitic landlords. From time to time, the authorities intervened and prohibited the discrimination. But even in the staffing of public-sector entities, there were cases where applicants had to prove their ‘Aryan origin’ or present a baptismal certificate.71 Apart from a few sizeable enterprises, Jewish businessmen often owned small trading houses, shops, or small firms or worked as independent tailors, cobblers, or goldsmiths.72 Among university graduates in Vienna, they represented more than 60 per cent of lawyers and around 50 per cent of doctors.73 After domestic rioting in February 1932, however, many doctors who were Social Democrats, the vast majority of them Jews, were dismissed from Viennese hospitals. In other occupational categories too, dismissals increased markedly. By 1937, among the 22,600 employees of the City of Vienna, only\n\n67\n\n68 69 70\n\n71 72\n\n73\n\nWerner Cahnman, ‘Materialien zur politischen Lage der Juden in Österreich und in Ungarn’, in Werner Cahnman, Deutsche Juden: Ihre Geschichte und Soziologie (Münster: Westfälisches Dampfboot, 2005), pp. 32–49, esp. pp. 33–34.

In addition, the absorption of Jewish refugees from Germany placed new demands on the welfare institutions of the Religious Community. Werner Cahnman summed it up in 1938: Just how bad the economic situation of the Jewish population is in the neighbourhoods most densely settled by Jews, the inner city, Leopoldstadt, Brigittenau and Alsergrund, can be seen solely from the fact that the buildings in these districts of Vienna have around 20 per cent more occupants than the overall average. Renting out rooms and beds is one of the strongest sources of income for the Jews there. […] The bitterest poverty of many thus exists alongside the greatest wealth of a few, while the broad class of the moderately affluent is destroyed.76\n\nThe Anschluss of Austria The idea of union between Germany and German-Austria can be traced back to the revolutionaries of 1848, who embraced linguistic nationalism. Their dreams of a Greater Germany came to nought in 1849 because of the perseverance of the dynasties and ultimately because of Bismarck’s ‘Lesser German’ solution, which excluded Austria. The prospect of a German Empire that would stretch from Bolzano to Flensburg and from Klagenfurt to Liège thus receded into the distance. For reasons of power politics, the Peace Treaty of Saint-Germain, which had been imposed on Austria after the end of the First World War, expressly prohibited union with Germany. The ban conferred new popularity on the Greater German idea of unification. In the interwar period, German and Austrian interests in unification differed sharply. Since 1918, Austria had been cut "
