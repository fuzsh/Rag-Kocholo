But it's the proper description of Xavier Giannoli's The Singer, a film of mood and nuance that explores character without a great deal of dramatic action. Gerard Depardieu gives one of his finest performances as Alain, a fiftysomething, overweight provincial chanteur in the old-fashioned style of Jean Sablon and Charles Trenet.\n\nPerforming with his four-piece band in the dance halls, small nightclubs and hotels of Vichy, Clermont Ferrand and smaller towns of central France, he's never had a national or international reputation. Managed by his ex-wife, once his stage partner, he lives alone in an old farmhouse. 'I'm not as rich as Elton John,' Alain quips, but he earns a decent living in a job he loves.\n\nOne night, he meets the 30-year-old Marion (Cecile de France, one of the most entrancing actresses at work today), a divorcee with a young son, and they have a one-night stand. She works in real estate with an old friend of his (Mathieu Amalric), a successful estate agent, who may be her lover, and Alain uses the excuse of looking for a house to keep seeing her. However, she subscribes to the third of Nelson Algren's three famous life rules - never go to bed with someone whose troubles are worse than your own.\n\nThe heavy-smoking Alain has trouble with his vocal cords and gets a final shot at the big time, but doesn't really confront either of those Kiplingesque impostors, triumph and disaster. This is a generous, emotionally truthful, quietly wise film, wistful and bittersweet in adult ways, a Gallic Disque Bleu equivalent to the Hollywood Marlboro Lite The Fabulous Baker Boys. No one is likely to leave the cinema until Depardieu has finished the cheerfully elegiac title song, 'Quand j'etais chanteur', which ends the picture, though not everyone will like the music as much as I do.\n\nNeil Jordan made his name 25 years ago with the impressive debut Angel, in which Stephen Rea plays a jazz musician on a violent revenge trip around a nightmarish Ulster after witnessing terrorists commit a double murder.\n\nIn his latest film, The Brave One, he revisits the same theme in New York, where Erica Bain (Jodie Foster), a radio celebrant of Manhattan life, discovers the worm in the Big Apple when she's badly injured and her doctor fiance is kicked to death in Central Park on the eve of their marriage.\n\nThe gun she acquires becomes an autonomous extension of her personality as she sets about taking on, and taking out, various lowlifes, an untouchable, sadistic big-time gangster and her fiance's killers. She also strikes up a relationship with an NYPD detective (Terrence Howard), not unlike that between Rea and the RUC homicide men, though more romantic. This well-made film is the thinking woman's Death Wish, a somewhat double-edged compliment perhaps, but not every movie heroine quotes from DH Lawrence (Studies in Classic American Literature) and Emily Dickinson ('Because I could not stop for Death').\n\nBest known in this country for his crime trilogy set in Grenoble, Lucas Belvaux has turned his attention to the rust-belt Belgian town of Liege with The Right of the Weakest. In a sort of criminal The Full Monty, redundant steel workers decide to rip off their former employers rather than rip off their clothes. Like The Brave One, it's a case of desperate times calling for desperate measures and what begins as a caper ends as a tragedy. A forceful, persuasive piece, if overlong.\n\nFrom America comes a pair of Oedipal comedies - nearly identical in structure - one terrible, the other highly amusing. In the dire Hot Rod, a pathetic, young, would-be stuntman dotes on his loving mother (Sissy Spacek), is determined to defeat his fierce, unappreciative stepfather (Ian McShane) and wants to emulate his late father (supposedly Evel Knievel's test rider).\n\nIn the good one, Mr Woodcock, the young author (Seann William Scott) of a successful self-help book called Letting Go: Getting Past Your Past, returns to his Nebraskan home town only to discover that his beloved, highly sexed mother (Susan Sarandon) is about to marry. Her intended is the bullying high-school coach (Billy Bob Thornton) who made the lad's adolescence a nightmare. Only near-lethal violence can settle this old score. This is comedy of embarrassment at its best and Thornton works yet another splendid variation on his brutal slob persona.\n\nA third comedy of high-school life, Rocket Science, centres on a stammering New Jersey teenager attempting to overcome his impediment and impress girls by becoming a debating champion. It's a rather typical example of American independent cinema's fascination with nerds and eccentrics and something of a disappointment as the first fiction movie by the documentarist who made Spellbound\n\nKenny is a very funny Australian comedy that purports to be a documentary about the life of a plump, wisecracking Melbourne plumber (Shane Jacobson) working for a firm that installs portable lavatories at alfresco social events such as church gatherings, fairgrounds and (the big occasion of the year) the racecourse where the Melbourne Cup is run. It works as well as any of Christopher Guest's cod-documentaries and is even funnier than The Specialist, Charles Sale's classic monologue by a Midwestern privy-builder, one of the biggest bestsellers of the interwar years and once to be found in every middle-class lavatory, or 'smallest room' as they were called.\n\nFinally, two films set in the 1960s that should never have been inflicted on the public. Mrs Ratcliffe's Revolution is an inept British comedy, a sort of 'Carry on Comrades' or 'Up the Stasi', about a dedicated Yorkshire communist taking his family to settle in East Germany in 1968.\n\nJulie Taymor's Across the Universe is a kitschy musical using Beatles songs to recreate the rebellious spirit of the decade through the relationship between a young Liverpool docker (inevitably named Jude), who goes to find his long-lost GI father in America and becomes friends with an Ivy League drop-out and his beautiful, politically active sister. Hair was bad enough, but this is a load of dandruff."
