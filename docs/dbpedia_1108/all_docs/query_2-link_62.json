Renowned as one of Australia’s best party bands, The Chantoozies - Tottie Goldsmith, Ally Fowler and Eve von Bibra – will entertain with their originals, crowd favourites and dance floor anthems, making for a two very special evenings of smooth sounds and brilliant boogying. If you’re looking for a party, then make sure these dates are in your diary!rnFor a band who originally came together for a one-off show, The Chantoozies certainly made a massive impact on the Aussie music scene in the 1980s and 1990s. They kicked off their career with a residency at the renowned Melbourne Underground nightclub and it wasn’t long before a record deal with Mushroom Records followed. With hits like Kiss And Tell, Wanna Be Up, Love the One You’re With and He’s Gonna Step On You, the band’s music became a soundtrack to that era. Their original material achieved platinum and gold sales and they toured with some of the biggest names in the business, including Billy Joel, Boom Crash Opera, Hoodoo Gurus and Daryl Braithwaite to name a few.rnAfter taking time out to pursue their individual careers, the girls reunited in 2006 to pay tribute to the record company that gave them their start. After The 25 Years Of Mushroom Music arena show at the MCG, they hit the road with Molly Meldrum for the national Countdown Spectacular tour, supported Rick Astley on his Australian tour and played to packed houses throughout the country. Since then they’ve kept touring and audiences can be assured that every evening in the company of The Chantoozies is a party!rnThe last couple of years have seen the effervescent musicians release new material, with two new singles that were extremely well received by the Australian public. They also toured with 80s icon Rick Astley, as well as Bananarama and Wang Chung, and have clocked up numerous headline gig dates around the country. There is no doubt The Chantoozies special blend of pop and rock is still as relevant today as it was when they performed their first show.The last couple of times The Chantoozies performed at The Reef Hotel Casino, the house was packed to the rafters. They got the dancefloor pumping on Australia day a few years back, and helped the Casino celebrate a massive two decade milestone in true party fashion. Who knows what is in store this time around – get your party outfits on and get ready for a massive night of fun! The Chantoozies are coming to town.rnDon’t miss the chance to party with The Chantoozies as they head to BAR36 this November.The Chantoozies perform at BAR36 at The Reef Hotel Casino on Friday 1st and Saturday 2nd November 2019 from 9pm nightly. Entertainment continues til late with The Nightshift on Friday night and The Tall Poppies on"
