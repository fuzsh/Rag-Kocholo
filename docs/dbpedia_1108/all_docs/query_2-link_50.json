        "text": "by Audi Victoria Week Media on 29 Oct 2009\n\nWendy Matthews will perform at Audi Victoria Week 2010 SW\n\nThe first line up has been revealed for the 2010 event with some big names in the mix…\n\nWendy Matthews, Daryl Braithwaite and 80’s rock icons in Absolutely 80’s are just a few of the names that have been revealed in the first of a long line up of entertainers set to grace the stages at Audi Victoria Week.\n\nCanadian born Wendy Matthews well known for her hits including ‘The Day You Went Away’ and ‘(I Don’t Want To Be With) Nobody But You’ will perform on Saturday 23rd on the Geelong Advertiser main stage. Wendy has won seven ARIAS, which is an all time record.\n\nThe 80’s were a tragic period, bad hair, bad clothing but musically there are some daggy songs that are well worth reliving. ‘Absolutely 80’s’ will provide a trip down memory lane, including Brian Mannix of the Uncanny X-Men, Scott Carne of Kids in the Kitchen, Sean Kelly of Models and Eve Von Bibra from the Chantoozies will unite to play their classic hits. The Absolutely 80’s showcase will feature on the Geelong Advertiser main stage on Sunday 24th.\n\nWho hasn’t sung along to Daryl Braithwaite’s classic ‘The Horses’? An anthem which appeals to all ages, you’d be hard pressed to find someone who doesn’t know the words. Daryl's initial success came with Sherbet, which produced twenty national Top 40 singles, including 'Howzat'. Get set for a sing along on Monday 25th on the Geelong Advertiser main stage on Geelong’s waterfront during Audi Victoria Week.\n\nThe entertainment program will commence from 3pm on Saturday, Sunday and Monday and from 11am on Tuesday (Australia Day). The impressive Bay FM Fireworks Spectacular will be held on Monday night following Daryl’s performance.\n\nKeep checking www.victoriaweek.com for further announcements.\n\nIf you want to link to this article then please use this URL: www.sail-world.com/62134"
