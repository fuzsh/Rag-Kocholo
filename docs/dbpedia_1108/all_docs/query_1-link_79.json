This book examines the causes and mechanisms of its survival and the ways in which it was read and interpreted from antiquity through the sixteenth century. The history of these intersecting and interrelated themes of transmission and reception is not unlike the plot of the Golden Ass—full of adventures, chance meetings, mistaken identity, opportunism, and narrow escapes. It is inextricably linked with the reception of Apuleius himself; his reputation as a philosopher, together with perceptions of the personality or “image” he projected in his works, shaped later interpretations of the Golden Ass and contributed to its survival. I began to think about the Golden Ass quite by chance over twenty years ago when I came upon a little manuscript bound into a Renaissance edition of Catullus. Its text, irresistibly entitled Lepida fabula de adulterio (A Charming Tale of Adultery), turned out to be an obscene sixteenth-century pastiche of the adultery stories in book 9 of the Golden Ass. Unaccountably inspired by this deplorable work (which will not appear elsewhere in this volume), I agreed to write the article on Apuleius for the Catalogus Translationum et Commentariorum and started to collect material on Apuleius’ manuscripts and interpretations. But other projects intervened, and I made little progress. An invitation from the Department of Classics at Oberlin College to deliver the Martin Classical Lectures provided me with the stimulus and opportunity to work on Apuleius in earnest. I thought that it might be fun to talk about the reception of the Golden Ass. And indeed it was. Following the fortunes of Apuleius and his novel has turned out to be even more rewarding than I imagined. The reception of the Golden Ass is wonderfully diverse, including literary, critical, and artistic interpretation in a variety of periods and genres. Its fortunes both intersect with and illuminate each of the major events in the transmission of classical literature, providing us with the opportunity to observe the novel at each step in the series: the transition from roll to codex, transcription in a monastic scriptorium, rediscovery at the beginning of the Renaissance, the transition from manuscript to print, university teaching, and ﬁnally the appearance of the translated book as a commercial product. This book is based on the four Charles Beebe Martin Classical Lectures I presented at Oberlin College in the spring of 2000. I called the lectures\n\n01_Gaisser_Prelims_p00i-pxvi.indd xi\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:10 PM\n\nxii\n\n•\n\nPreface\n\n“Transformations of Apuleius,” but my present title is intended to be more descriptive and at least slightly more precise. I have expanded the original four lectures to seven chapters to ﬁll in lacunae in the original presentation. I have also devoted even more attention to the visual reception of Apuleius and the Golden Ass than I did in the lectures, since the numerous artistic representations in paintings, manuscripts, and printed books have much to say about the interpretations and mind-set of their makers. Without them the story of the fortunes of Apuleius and his novel would be one-sided and incomplete. All quotations from Latin and other languages have been translated; the translations, unless otherwise noted, are my own. Some portions of my discussions of Fulgentius, Boccaccio, and Beroaldo have appeared in earlier versions: “Teaching Classics in the Renaissance: Two Case Histories” (Presidential Address to the American Philological Association: TAPA, 2001); “Allegorizing Apuleius: Fulgentius, Boccaccio, Beroaldo, and the Chain of Receptions” (Acta Conventus Neo-Latini Cantabrigiensis, 2003); “Reading Apuleius with Filippo Beroaldo” (in Being There Together: Essays in Honor of Michael C. J. Putnam on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday, 2003); “Filippo Beroaldo on Apuleius: Bringing Antiquity to Life” (in On Renaissance Commentaries, 2005); “Apuleius in Florence: From Boccaccio to Lorenzo de’ Medici” (in Classica et Beneventana: Essays Presented to Virginia Brown on the Occasion of Her 65th Birthday, 2007). The happiest part of completing any long project is the opportunity to thank all those who made it possible. My greatest thanks must go to the Charles Beebe Martin Lecture Fund and to the Department of Classics at Oberlin College for their invitation, their hospitality, their splendid collegiality, and their patience in waiting for this book. More than they know, Nate Greenberg, Jim Helm, and Tom Van Nortwick inﬂuenced this ﬁnal product. I am also grateful both to the National Endowment for the Humanities and to Bryn Mawr College for their support. Anyone who ventures into the waters of reception is soon out of her depth and needs the help of friends who know the shoals and currents of foreign times and places. I have beneﬁted from the generosity of many who helped me navigate strange waters from late antiquity to sixteenthcentury Germany and France and places in between. They include Oliver Nicholson, Benjamin Todd Lee, Carol Kaske, James John, Frank Coulson, Danuta Shanzer, Greg Hays, Ann Kuttner, Erika Simon, Francis Newton, Michael Maas, John Duffy, Marianne Pade, Bruce Swann, Patricia Osmond, Craig Kallendorf, Stella Revard, David Marsh, Lawrence Buck, Anna Grotans, Walther Ludwig, Philip Ford, and Ann Moss. My Bryn Mawr colleagues have assisted me in countless ways; in particular\n\n01_Gaisser_Prelims_p00i-pxvi.indd xii\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:10 PM\n\nPreface\n\n•\n\nxiii\n\nI want to thank Pat McPherson, Alice Donohue, Dale Kinney, Darby Scott, David Cast, Nancy Dersoﬁ, Peter Koelle, and Roberta Ricci. I have been helped time and again by many librarians, but especially Robert Babcock of the Beinecke Library and John Pollack of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library of the University of Pennsylvania, as well as Anne Slater, Andrew Patterson, Charles Burke, Eric Pumroy, Marianne Hansen, Camilla MacKay, and Elliott Shore of the Bryn Mawr College Library. And ﬁnally, I owe special thanks to Helen North, Nico and Kezia Knauer, James O’Donnell, Virginia Brown, and James Hankins for the gift of their learning and friendship.

He claimed to cultivate both philosophy and the nine Muses (Fl. 20.6), and the diversity of his writings is so great that one can almost believe him.1 Most of what we know about his life comes from Apuleius himself, particularly from comments in the Florida (excerpts from his epideictic orations) and the Apology, or De Magia (On Magic), in which he defends himself against a charge of practicing magic.2 He was born in North Africa, probably in Madauros (modern Mdaourouch in Algeria), in the mid-120s AD. After his early education in Carthage, he spent several years studying in Athens, drinking deeply, as he says, of the cups of the Muses: “the cup of poetry, made with artiﬁce, the clear cup of geometry, the sweet cup of music, the dry one of dialectic, and the one of which a person can never have enough—the nectarlike cup of all philosophy.”3 In this period he probably traveled elsewhere in the Greek east, almost surely to Samos and perhaps to Phrygia as well.4 He then moved on to 1 In addition to the Golden Ass, Apuleius’ extant works include erotic poetry, forensic and epideictic oratory, and philosophical orations and treatises. For detailed accounts of his oeuvre, including fragmentary and lost works, see Hijmans, “Apuleius, Philosophus Platonicus,” 398, 408–12; Harrison, Apuleius, 10–38. For the title of the novel, see n. 130 below. For Apuleius as a Platonist, see Gersh, Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism 1: 215–328. 2 For Apuleius’ biography, see especially Harrison, Apuleius, 1–10. I cite the Apology and Florida from the text of Vallette: Apulée: Apologie, Florides. For the Apology, see also Hunink, Apuleius: Pro se de magia. For the Florida, see La Rocca, Il ﬁlosofo e la città; Lee, Apuleius’ Florida. For translations, see Harrison, ed., Apuleius’ Rhetorical Works. 3 “[Ego et alias creterras Athenis bibi:] poeticae commentam, geometriae limpidam, musicae dulcem, dialecticae austerulam, iam vero universae philosophiae inexplebilem scilicet nectaream.” Fl. 20.4. 4 He reports having seen a statue of Bathyllus on Samos (Fl. 15.6) and a mountain in Phrygia that emitted poisonous gases (Mun. 327). For the latter, see Hijmans, “Apuleius,\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 1\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:43 PM\n\n2\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nRome.5 We ﬁnd him back in North Africa in the mid-150s, and well into the best-known and most notorious event in his life: the marriage and subsequent charge of magic documented in the Apology. According to the Apology, around 155 or 156 Apuleius came to the town of Oea (modern Tripoli) and married a wealthy widow named Pudentilla, the mother of Sicinius Pontianus, an old friend from his student days in Athens. He did so at his friend’s request, to save her estate from the relatives of her late husband. The marriage did not sit well with Pudentilla’s former in-laws, and in late 158 or early 159 Apuleius was brought to trial on a charge of magic. Speciﬁcally, it seems, he was accused of using magic to induce Pudentilla to fall in love with him. The charge was serious, since sorcery was potentially a capital offense.6 Apuleius spoke in his own defense and with evident success, for a few years later he was giving orations in Carthage, where—by his own account, at least—he was a prominent and popular ﬁgure. We hear nothing of him after the late 160s.7 Apuleius was a quintessential product of his time, for both were bicultural, prosperous, nostalgic for the classical past, and enamored of display. The predominant cultural phenomenon of the age was the movement called the Second Sophistic, whose distinguishing feature was what we might describe as oratory for entertainment.8 Its practitioners, Philosophus Platonicus,” 429–30. On the basis of two inscriptions from the late second or early third century discovered at Petri, near Corinth, Kritzas has suggested that he might also have visited Corinth (“Δύο επιγράμματα από το Πετρί NεμέαϚ”; and see the discussion by Jennifer Tobin in Bryn Mawr Classical Review 97.5.10). The inscriptions celebrate a woman named Salvia, a Thessalian married to a Corinthian, and Kritzas speculates that Apuleius perhaps became acquainted with Salvia and her family on a visit to Corinth and used her name and history in describing the background of Lucius in the Golden Ass: Lucius was from Corinth (Met. 1.22.4; 2.12.3), and his mother, Salvia, was from Thessaly (Met. 2.2). But Salvia was not an unusual name, and the parallel between the historical and ﬁctional Thessalian women may well be only a coincidence. 5 Fl. 17.4. In an interesting and speculative discussion, Coarelli (“Apuleio a Ostia?”) argues that Apuleius spent several years (ca. 145–52) in Rome and was the proprietor of the “House of Apuleius” in Ostia. The house is so called from the name “L. Apulei Marcelli” found on two water pipes near the house (p. 27 n. 2). See also Beck, “Apuleius the Novelist.” Harrison calls the identiﬁcation “interesting but ultimately unconvincing” (Apuleius, 1). 6 See Bradley, “Law, Magic, and Culture,” 207. 7 But Harrison would date the Metamorphoses in the 170s (Apuleius, 250–51). Arguments have also been made for dating De Mundo and De Platone after 177; for discussion and earlier bibliography, see Lee, Apuleius’ Florida, 9–11. 8 See Sandy, The Greek World of Apuleius, and Anderson, The Second Sophistic, both with further bibliography. For “the cult of learning” and the craze for classical culture, see also Zanker, The Mask of Socrates, esp. 198–266.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 2\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:44 PM\n\nApuleius: A Celebrity and His Image\n\n•\n\n3\n\nthe sophists, were—or aspired to be—celebrities. The more successful ones were highly paid, achieved fame well beyond their native cities, and attracted large numbers of followers. Sometimes they attained public ofﬁce or positions of high status and inﬂuence.9 Their activities included displaying and purveying classical (but primarily Greek) culture, self-promotion, and playing to the local pride of the cities and regions they spoke in. Above all, however, they professed an attachment to philosophy—or rather to their own brand of philosophy, which Apuleius deﬁnes as “a royal science devised to promote the art of speaking as much as the art of living.”10 The sophistic movement grew out of the ancient educational system, which was largely based on rhetorical training. Many of the sophists were teachers of the rhetorical art, and many in their audiences had been brought up in it. Listeners who had spent their school days practicing rhetorical exercises enjoyed and savored virtuoso oratorical performances. They could recognize a speaker’s techniques and tricks and many of his themes, and they could criticize the ﬁne points of his strategy and delivery. But the sophists’ orations were also entertaining and accessible enough to appeal to those with little education, who would have been in the vast majority in every audience.11 The extent and success of the movement were fostered by the relative ease of travel throughout the Greco-Roman world and by the bilingualism—or at least biculturism— of its educated inhabitants. Sophists practiced their ostentatious art all over the empire; and although the cultural basis of the movement was Greek, it also had room for Hellenized Romans like Apuleius.12 The chief subject of every sophist was himself—or rather his ostensible self, the self that he wished his public to see. (I say “he” advisedly, for the sophists were all male.) The sophist’s self-presentation extended to every aspect of his appearance: both on- and offstage he suited his clothes, coiffure, gestures, mannerisms, voice, and possessions to his role.13 9 But rhetoric seems to have provided prominence and reputation rather than social mobility, since most sophists came from elite families; see Bowie, “The Importance of Sophists.” 10 “Disciplinam regalem tam ad bene dicendum quam ad bene vivendum repertam.” Fl. 7.10. 11 For the mixed nature of Apuleius’ audience, see Bradley, “Apuleius and Carthage.” Bradley points out that the theater in Carthage Apuleius describes in Fl. 18.3–5 had a capacity of about eleven thousand, of whom only a small portion would have been highly educated (19). See also Sandy, The Greek World of Apuleius, 83. 12 For Apuleius as a sophist, see Sandy, The Greek World of Apuleius. For Apuleius as a Roman or Latin sophist, see Harrison, Apuleius. 13 For the self-presentation of both philosophers and sophists, see Hahn, Der Philosoph und die Gesellschaft, 33–53. See also Gleason, Making Men; Zanker, The Mask of Socrates, 217–47.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 3\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:44 PM\n\n4\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nHe created the role, however, with words, in the ﬁrst-person utterance of his orations. This verbal image of the sophist is best seen as a special case of what happens when any writer uses the ﬁrst person. By using the word I the author creates a persona, a mask or character whose identity, emotions, and experiences are presented as autobiographical, whether they are real or imaginary. Whatever its degree of reality, the ﬁrst person invites us to elide the persona with the writer, to identify the mask with the man or woman behind it, or—to put it another way—to conﬂate the puppet with the person pulling the strings. The effect is necessarily increased when authors read or perform their own works before an audience, as they did so often in antiquity. When orators spoke in law courts or declaimed in theaters or poets gave readings to audiences large or small, they brought to life the characters of their own creation, making the “I,” or “ego,” of their scripts into credible likenesses of themselves. Ancient writers fully exploited the persona—sometimes hiding behind it completely, sometimes lifting it for a moment to create a play between their real and ﬁctional selves. Orators and politicians tended to stay in character, holding up to the world the self they had so carefully fashioned.14 Poets were more willing both to acknowledge the existence of the mask and to advertise its distance from reality, as Catullus does in the notorious lines from poem 16.15 Nam castum esse decet pium poetam ipsum, versiculos nihil necesse est, ... vos, quod milia multa basiorum legistis, male me marem putastis? (Cat. 16.5–6, 12–13) It’s ﬁtting for the upright poet himself to be free of ﬁlth, but there’s no need for his verses to be so. ... Because you read about many thousands of kisses, Did you think I wasn’t much of a man? 14 For self-fashioning as a ﬁeld of inquiry, see Greenblatt, Renaissance Self-Fashioning. For Roman self-fashioning, see the following, all with earlier bibliography: Leach, “The Politics of Self-Presentation”; Gleason, Making Men; Dugan, “How to Make (and Break) a Cicero.” 15 Apuleius himself quotes Cat. 16.5–6 as a defense of his own erotic verses (Apol. 11.1–2). Catullus’ words are less transparent than they appear. He does not say “My verses may be naughty, but I am chaste.” Rather, by abandoning the ﬁrst person and using the slippery decet (“it’s ﬁtting”) instead of an indicative, he presents only a general statement of propriety that leaves his own character unrevealed. See Gaisser, Catullus and His Renaissance Readers, 210–11.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 4\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:44 PM\n\nApuleius: A Celebrity and His Image\n\n•\n\n5\n\nThe sophists, like the poets, liked to play with the mask. They did so ostentatiously, in full view of their audience, for their personae were— quite literally—their stock in trade, the material of their celebrity. Apuleius, sophist par excellence, teases his public with two principal personae: the “I” of his orations and philosophical works and the “I” of his novel the Golden Ass. Like Catullus and other poets, he sometimes takes off his mask (or pretends to), hinting that the persona he has displayed might not be his “real” self; but he can also replace one mask with another, confusing and blurring the identities he has placed before us. This chapter is concerned with Apuleius and his fortunes in antiquity, especially with the creation and development of his “image”—a term that I will be using in all of its possible senses, including the one we have in mind when we talk about the carefully constructed image of a public ﬁgure or a commercial product. We will consider how Apuleius professes to see himself, the image or persona he presents to his public, and the images (both literary and artistic) made of him by others.\n\nCreating an Image Like his fellow sophists, Apuleius presented his image chieﬂy through his orations. We see his constructed self most extensively in the Apology and Florida, but it also peeks out tantalizingly from time to time in the Golden Ass. The Apology presents itself as the speech that Apuleius actually delivered before the court, but it seems likely that he revised and perhaps even rewrote it after the fact. This point is controversial, but the speech in its present form would be a risky defense: it shows too much detailed knowledge of magic and magical terminology, is too arrogant, and treats the charges too lightly.16 It has been argued that the presiding judge, Claudius Maximus, was highly educated and philosophically minded, and thus could be relied on to be sympathetic to a fellow intellectual facing a trumped-up charge.17 Nonetheless, there was still a chance that Apuleius’ cleverness could backﬁre, and that even a sympathetic judge could ﬁnd the levity he displays in the Apology offensive and impertinent enough to convict him. Matters would have been quite different, 16 The point is well made by Gaide, “Apulée de Madaure.” For the arguments on both sides with earlier bibliography, see Hijmans, “Apuleius Orator,” 1715–19; Hunink, ed., Apuleius of Madauros, Pro se de magia 1:25–7. 17 Bradley (“Law, Magic, and Culture,” 215–19) emphasizes his afﬁnities with Apuleius. But the serious Maximus described by Bradley, with his moral virtues and “qualities of consistency and balanced character” (216), seems to have little in common with the persona of Apuleius in the Apology.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 5\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:45 PM\n\n6\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nhowever, after the trial and its successful conclusion. Then the triumphant Apuleius would have been free to indulge himself, rewriting his speech as a brilliant and wickedly funny pseudodefense.18 If this assessment is correct, the persona that Apuleius presents in the Apology is one step removed from the one he revealed at his trial—a ﬁction of a ﬁction. At the same time, however, it is consistent with the persona he presents in the various excerpts from epideictic orations preserved in the Florida: self-absorbed, conﬁdent, intellectual, and constantly on display. In both the Florida and the Apology we see Apuleius as a man who likes to talk about himself but does not do so carelessly or merely to impart autobiographical detail. Almost every word is designed to present him to his hearers (or perhaps readers, in the case of the Apology) in a particular, and highly ﬂattering, light. Like a spotlight in a modern theater, the beam he directs on himself changes its color and intensity and direction, but it always shows the persona of Apuleius center stage— and from his best side. That does not mean, however, that it always shows him clearly, for Apuleius manipulates light and shadow so adroitly that sometimes we cannot be sure of what we have seen, or even of what we were supposed to see. These doubtful or ambiguous aspects of Apuleius’ identity are important, for they are precisely the ones that posterity would ﬁnd most intriguing. We shall consider them presently, but ﬁrst let us look at the parts of his image that are clearly revealed. The ﬁgure onstage is above all a philosopher, speciﬁcally “Apuleius the Platonic philosopher of Madauros,” as he was known both in antiquity and to posterity.19 But it is important to note that Apuleius uses the word philosopher with a special meaning, one he has given it himself. 18 Cf. Gaide, “Apulée de Madaure,” 231: “Apulée aura considérablement revu et augmenté son discours, pour se venger à fond de toutes les médisances dont il avait été l’objet, pour transformer insolemment son apologie en un De Magia qui est souvent un ‘Pro Magia’, et pour se faire applaudir.” 19 The second- or third-century base of a lost statue, almost certainly of Apuleius, is inscribed “to the Platonic philosopher”; see p. 13. The author of Peri Hermeneias treats the phrase as a synonym for Apuleius: “Licet autem eadem vi manente utramvis partem in plura verba protendere, ut si pro Apuleio dicas philosophum Platonicum Madaurensem, item pro disserendo dicas eum uti oratione” (Peri Hermeneias 267). (The work, although ascribed to Apuleius very early in the tradition, should probably not be attributed to him; for the arguments, see Hijmans, “Apuleius, Philosophus Platonicus,” 408–11; Klibansky and Regen, Die Handschriften, 18–23.) Augustine calls him “Apuleius Afer Platonicus nobilis” (Civ. 8.12), “Apuleius Platonicus Madaurensis” (Civ. 8.14), and “philosophus Platonicus” (Civ. 8.19); see Hagendahl, Augustine and the Latin Classics 1:18–19. The title also appears in the oldest manuscripts of both branches of the manuscript tradition. In the eleventh-century manuscript Florence, Biblioteca Laurenziana 68.2 (called F), the phrase “Apulei Platonici Madaurensis” appears in the explicit of the Apology (fols. 125v–126r). (The folio is illustrated in Pecere, “Esemplari con subscriptiones e tradizione dei testi latini,” plates 3a–b.) In the early ninth-century manuscript Brussels, Bibliothèque Royale Albert Ier 10054–10056, “Apulei Platonici Madaurensis” appears in the incipit of\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 6\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:45 PM\n\nApuleius: A Celebrity and His Image\n\n•\n\n7\n\nLike an artist making a self-portrait by looking into a mirror, he has redrawn the image of the philosopher to match his own features and activities. In this new usage it is not so much that Apuleius is described by the word philosopher as that the word philosopher is deﬁned as “Apuleius.” This new philosopher is a celebrity. Crowds ﬂock to his performances— in greater numbers than have ever assembled to hear a philosopher, as we learn in Florida 9. “Indeed, even my talent, however small,” he says in Florida 17, “has long been so well known to the public for what it is that it requires no new commendation.”20 In Florida 9 he asserts that his extraordinary fame has created almost impossibly high expectations in his audience: “Who among you would forgive me a single solecism? Who would grant me one syllable barbarously pronounced? . . . And yet you pardon these things in others easily and very justly.”21 Naturally his works are equally famous. In the Apology he reminds the court of his celebrated speech praising the god Aesculapius and calls on his hearers to recite its opening lines. “Do you hear all the people supplying them?” he asks the judge. Someone in the audience even has a copy of the book, which Apuleius asks to have read out in evidence.22 But fame is not all he has to offer. Our philosopher claims other merits, which appear to their best advantage in comparison with the qualities of others—whether beasts, men, other philosophers, or even gods. Birdsong, for example, as he tells his audience in Florida 13, is limited in both time and repertoire, for each species sings a particular strain and only at a single time of day. “Philosophy did not bestow utterance like that on me. . . . Rather, the thought and utterance of the philosopher are continual—august to hear, useful to understand, and tuneful in every key.”23 In Florida 9 Apuleius compares himself in versatility to the old Athenian sophist Hippias. Hippias, he says, was famous for having made every item of his apparel—including not only his clothes and sandals but even his ring, oil bottle, and strigil. Apuleius, by contrast, boasts of versatility not as a craftsman but as a writer,\n\nDe deo Socratis (fol. 2r), and “Apulei Platonici Philosophi Madaurensis” in the explicit (fol. 16v). See Munk Olsen, L’Étude des auteurs classiques latins aux Xieet Xiie siècles 1:13; Klibansky and Regen, Die Handschriften, 60–62. 20 “Nam et quantulumcumque ingenium meum iam pridem pro captu suo hominibus notius est, quam ut indigeat novae commendationis.” Fl. 17.2. 21 “Quis enim vestrum mihi unum soloecismum ignoverit? quis vel unam syllabam barbare pronuntiatam donaverit? . . . Quae tamen aliis facile et sane meritissimo ignoscitis.” Fl. 9.7. 22 “Audisne, Maxime, multos suggerentis? Immo, ecce etiam liber offertur.” Apol. 55.12. 23 “Non enim mihi philosophia id genus orationem largita est. . . . Sed enim philosophi ratio et oratio tempore iugis est et auditu venerabilis et intellectu utilis et modo omnicana.” Fl. 13.1 and 3.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 7\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:45 PM\n\n8\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nclaiming to have composed not only poetry of every kind but also riddles, histories, orations, and dialogues—and all in both Greek and Latin (Fl. 9.15–29). In Florida 20 he claims to have surpassed even the great philosophers of the past in the variety if not in the quality of his compositions.24 In appearance, too, he compares himself with others, aligning physical beauty and philosophic sophistication on one side against ugliness and boorish ignorance on the other. In such matching of outer and inner qualities Apuleius is very much a man of his age, for although even Homer practiced the art of physiognomy (which we might deﬁne as believing that one can tell a book by its cover), the association of physical features with qualities of character reached its height as a fullblown pseudoscience under the Second Sophistic.25 In the Apology Apuleius uses the argument from physiognomy to overturn the prevailing picture of the philosopher and reshape it in his own image. He claims that his adversaries opened their case by describing him pejoratively as “ ‘a handsome philosopher’ (and horror of horrors!) ‘eloquent in both Greek and Latin.’ ”26 A strange criticism, we might think. Their argument, however, was that his speaking ability and appearance identiﬁed him as a sophist and belied his claim to be a philosopher. Philosophy and oratory were traditionally deemed incompatible; and although the distinction between them in practice had largely broken down by this time, the “rhetoric of rivalry”27 between the two callings remained. Sophists could and did profess philosophy, and philosophers orated; but they cultivated separate images—the philosopher as a bearded sage, the sophist as a smartly dressed dandy.28 Apuleius’ accusers had the traditional distinctions ﬁrmly in mind, evidently claiming that as a 24 “Canit enim Empedocles carmina, Plato dialogos, Socrates hymnos, Epicharmus modos, Xenophon historias, Crates satiras: Apuleius vester haec omnia novemque Musas pari studio colit, maiore scilicet voluntate quam facultate.” Fl. 20.5–6. 25 For Homer’s association of appearance and character, see especially Il. 2.211–64, where the ugliness of Thersites reﬂects his low social class and tendency to quarrel with his betters. For physiognomy in the Second Sophistic, see Evans, “The Study of Physiognomy in the Second Century A.D.”; Gleason, Making Men, esp. 55–81. For Apuleius, see Opeku, “Physiognomy in Apuleius.” 26 “ ‘Accusamus apud te philosophum formonsum et tam Graece quam Latine’ pro nefas! ‘disertissimum.’ ” Apol. 4.1. 27 The expression is Gleason’s (Making Men, 131). 28 See the important discussion of Hahn, Der Philosoph und die Gesellschaft, 46–53. For the sophist’s appearance, see also Zanker, The Mask of Socrates, 243. Both Hahn (51) and Zanker (235) cite Philostratus’ account of the philosopher Aristokles (VS 567), whose conversion to rhetoric as a follower of Herodes Atticus was accompanied by changes in his grooming, friends, and recreations. But Hahn places Apuleius, along with Favorinus and Maximus of Tyre, in a gray area of sophistic/philosophical polymathy and performance (53).\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 8\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:45 PM\n\nApuleius: A Celebrity and His Image\n\n•\n\n9\n\nsophist (for that is the point of the word eloquent) Apuleius was ipso facto not a philosopher. Their argument about appearance is more interesting. The epithet “handsome philosopher” is intended as a contradiction in terms exposing Apuleius as a hypocrite. For in this period, as Zanker observes, “if a man wanted to be acknowledged publicly as a philosopher, . . . the one thing he could not appear was handsome.”29 Contemporary busts and statues of philosophers show them as men well past their ﬁrst youth, wrinkled in thought, with careless or disordered hair and the distinguishing feature of the so-called philosopher’s beard.30 Literary accounts present the same picture.31 Apuleius responds to his opponents by trying, with transparent insincerity, to convince the court that he is not good-looking—long hours of study have worn him down, and his hair is a mess.32 But his real argument lies elsewhere. He implicitly rejects the contemporary picture of the philosopher and refutes the charge of hypocrisy, using the physiognomical connection between appearance and character to make the phrase “handsome philosopher” not a contradiction in terms but rather a selfevident proposition. Both Pythagoras and Zeno were good-looking, he tells the court, and so were many other philosophers, “who enhanced the grace of their bodies with the integrity of their character.”33 By contrast, Apuleius’ accuser Sicinius Aemilianus embodies the opposite qualities. According to Apuleius, he is an ignorant rustic—uncouth, wicked, and correspondingly hideous to look at, for he is as ugly as the tragic mask of Thyestes or the hideous boatman Charon.34 He no doubt also had a 29\n\nZanker, The Mask of Socrates, 235. For the description, see ibid., 217–47 and ﬁgs. 129, 133, 143. For the “philosopher’s beard,” see 220, 229. 31 See Hahn, Der Philosoph und die Gesellschaft, 33–45. 32 Apol. 4.10. Apuleius’ protestations are intentionally unconvincing. I do not agree with Zanker’s argument (The Mask of Socrates, 234) that he tried to present an unkempt or disheveled appearance in court. At Apol. 92.5 he casually describes himself as “iuvenem neque corpore neque animo neque fortuna paenitendum.” 33 “Itemque multos philosophos ab ore honestissimos memoriae prodi, qui gratiam corporis morum honestamentis ornaverint.” Apol. 4.9. Most of the philosophers in Apuleius are good looking. The hunchback Cynic Crates of Florida 14 is a notable exception. 34 Rustic and uncouth: “Agrestis quidem semper et barbarus” (Apol. 10.6). Wicked: “At ego non mirer, si boni consulis me de isto distortissimo vultu tuo dicere, de moribus tuis multo truculentioribus reticere” (Apol. 16.8). Like Thyestes: “Quamquam teterrimum os tuum minimum a Thyesta tragico demutet” (Apol. 16.7). Hunink (Apuleius . . . de Magia) observes ad loc.: “The ugly mask of the horriﬁed Thyestes is a theatrical element with clearly negative associations; it is ﬁrmly put on Aemilianus’ face.” Like Charon: The nickname not only attacks Aemilianus’ ugliness (“ob oris et animi diritatem”; Apol. 56.7) but insinuates that he is a murderer: “Neque enim diu est, cum te crebrae mortes propinquorum immeritis hereditatibus fulserunt, unde tibi potius quam ob istam teterrimam faciem Charon nomen est” (Apol. 23.7). 30\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 9\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:45 PM\n\n10\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nbeard, if not a philosophical one, if the comparisons with Thyestes and Charon are anything to go by. The mask of Thyestes was probably bearded, and Apuleius could have counted on his audience to remember Vergil’s famous description of Charon in Aeneid 6: . . . appallingly ﬁlthy he is, with a bush of unkempt White beard upon his chin, with eyes like jets of ﬁre; And a dirty cloak draggles down, knotted about his shoulders.35 In Florida 3 Apuleius transposes the alliance of beauty and wisdom against ugliness and ignorance into the world of myth, using as his protagonists Apollo and Marsyas. He tells how the rustic Marsyas entered into a musical competition with Apollo: “a monster [contending] with a beautiful youth, a rustic personage with a learned one, an animal with a god.”36 Minerva and the Muses stood by, ostensibly as judges, but they had really come to mock Marsyas’ lack of culture and punish his stupidity. Marsyas, unaware that he was an object of derision, began not by playing his ﬂute (his sole talent) but by babbling foolishly like the barbarian he was. He ﬁrst praised himself, as Apuleius says, “because his hair was pulled back and he had a ragged beard and shaggy chest, because his art was ﬂute playing and he was lacking in wealth.”37 Then he went on to attack Apollo for the opposite qualities—for his beautiful long hair, fair beardless cheeks and smooth body, and for his manifold talents and opulent wealth. The Muses laughed at his accusations and left the defeated Marsyas ﬂayed alive and with his naked ﬂesh torn to pieces. The selection ends: “But Apollo was ashamed of such a paltry victory.”38 The contest of Apollo and Marsyas is an unmistakable allusion to the dispute between Apuleius and his accusers in the Apology.39 Neither the date nor the audience of Florida 3 is known, but the excerpts in the Florida whose dates and audiences can be determined all belong to the 35 Aen. 6.299–301. The translation is by C. Day Lewis. Apuleius also compares Aemilianus to Mezentius, another bearded character from Vergil (Apol. 56.7; cf. Aen. 10.838). 36 “Teter cum decoro, agrestis cum erudito, belua cum deo.” Fl. 3.6. 37 “Quod erat et coma relicinus et barba squalidus et pectore hirsutus et arte tibicen et fortuna egenus.” Fl. 3.8. For the argument that Apuleius is applying the rules of physiognomy in his description of Marsyas, see Opeku, “Physiognomy in Apuleius,” 472–73. 38 “Enimvero Apollinem tam humilis victoriae puditum est.” Fl. 3.14. 39 Hunink calls the similarity between the two contests “a fascinating parallel” (Apuleius . . . de Magia, 21). The parallel was noted as early as 1820 in Bayle’s Dictionary: “Au reste, il me semble (je n’ose néanmoins l’afﬁrmer) qu’Apulée avait en vue son procès, lorsqu’il décrivit dans l’une de ses harangues celui d’Apollon et de Marsyas.” Dictionnaire historique et critique (Paris, 1820), 2:212. For a different view, see La Rocca, Il ﬁlosofo e la città, 144–52, who also identiﬁes Apollo with Apuleius but sees Marsyas as one of Apuleius’ philosophical rivals.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 10\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:45 PM\n\nApuleius: A Celebrity and His Image\n\n•\n\n11\n\nperiod 160–69 and were delivered to the Carthaginians.40 That is, they were delivered both several years after Apuleius’ trial for magic and in the cultural capital of North Africa. Florida 3 no doubt has the same date and place. It refers, not very subtly, to the success of the Apology, for the story of Apollo and Marsyas as Apuleius presents it is a virtual allegory of his triumph over his boorish small-town opponents. Marsyas’ ugliness and ignorance are like those of Apuleius’ accusers, and his complaints of Apollo’s beauty and talent certainly recall their accusation that Apuleius was “a handsome philosopher and eloquent in both Greek and Latin.” Minerva and the Muses have their counterpart in the learned and distinguished judge Claudius Maximus, whom Apuleius compliments so often in the Apology. The parallels are clear enough, and Apuleius need not labor them. He does not spell out the likeness between himself and Apollo but leaves the audience to infer that he, like the god, was a little embarrassed by his easy victory. In Florida 3, then, Apuleius is keeping his victory alive in the minds of his audience and making sure that they remember it in a particular way—as the virtually foreordained triumph of divine beauty and talent over subhuman barbarity. To put it another way, Apuleius is promoting and controlling his image. But an image is not always an intangible abstraction. Physical likenesses and portraits are equally important— both to keep a sophist’s features in the public eye and to reﬂect them back to his own.\n\nSelf-Reflection Apuleius treats this second purpose—that of seeing his own image—in a famous passage in the Apology. His enemies have charged that he possesses a mirror, no doubt both to accuse him of vanity and to hint that he has used it in nefarious magical practices, but primarily to suggest that the possession of a mirror, like being good-looking, is incompatible with philosophy.41 This charge, like that of being a handsome philosopher, is phrased as an obvious oxymoron: “The philosopher has a mirror. The philosopher possesses a mirror.”42 40 For the dating, which is based on internal evidence in Fl. 9, 16, and 17, see Vallette, Apulée: Apologie, Florides, xxvi–xxviii; Hijmans, “Apuleius Orator,” 1723–25. Harrison suggests that Fl. 16 might be dated as late as the early 170s (Apuleius, 116). Fl. 9, 16, 17, 18, and 20 are explicitly addressed to the Carthaginians. 41 Mirrors were associated primarily with women, and their use by men was suspect; see McCarty, “The Shape of the Mirror,” 167–168. For mirrors in magic, see Hunink, Apuleius . . . de Magia, 57–58. 42 “Habet speculum philosophus, possidet speculum philosophus.” Apol. 13.5.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 11\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:46 PM\n\n12\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nApuleius handily refutes the contradiction; indeed, to hear him tell it, every philosopher needs a mirror for both ethical and scientiﬁc purposes. But he directs most of his argument in a different direction, praising the power of the mirror to reﬂect the features of its owner, and comparing mirror images with likenesses presented by statues or paintings. “Don’t you know that there is nothing a man would rather look at than his own form?”43 he asks the court. Statues can certainly fulﬁll this function, and that is one reason that a city rewards a deserving man with a statue of himself to look at (Apol. 14.2). But for his own contemplation Apuleius prefers a mirror. The image in a mirror is portable and can be gazed at whenever one likes. The reﬂection has the color and motion and vitality lacking in artiﬁcial likenesses and shows a man exactly as he is at a given moment, reﬂecting every movement and change in expression. The image in a painting or statue, by contrast, is ﬁxed in time and space and conveys but a single expression, so that from the moment of its completion it is unlike its subject. Apuleius has no objection to statues—on the contrary.44 But he does like to look into the mirror, not only for the immediacy and accuracy and availability of its image but because he creates and controls it. He can create or dissolve the image at will simply by bringing the mirror to his face or moving it away. He can change it with a smile or a frown or twist of the head. But his connection with it is even more intimate than we might expect. From his survey of scientiﬁc and philosophical explanations of the mirror we learn that a reﬂection may be a thin mask of atoms emanating from the subject’s body and bounced back to his eyes from the mirror’s surface, or perhaps a creation of the ﬁery efﬂuence from his eyes as it mingles with air or light.45 That is, in whatever explanation one chooses, a person’s reﬂection is, quite literally, a part of himself. Thus, the image in the mirror is doubly appealing, both for its symbiotic relation with its subject and because it is under his control to an extent inconceivable with other likenesses. (Only Alexander the Great, Apuleius observes, was able to ensure that his image came down to posterity as he wished. He did so by allowing only the three greatest artists of his age to portray him and deterring the others with the fear of death.)46 But if artiﬁcial likenesses have the disadvantage of being 43\n\n“An tu ignoras nihil esse aspectabilius homini nato quam formam suam?” Apol. 14.2.

The philosopher who wants to keep his face and fame before the public needs something more substantial and permanent. He wants statues, and preferably as many as possible. Many statues and busts of philosophers survive from antiquity.47 Cities erected statues to honor and lay claim to famous men; philosophers and sophists in turn sought and desired them. The practice was so common that philosophers had a standard form of giving thanks to the cities that erected statues in their honor, as Apuleius tells us (Fl. 16.29). The presence or absence or (heaven forbid!) the removal of a statue measured a sophist’s current reputation as well as his chances of future fame or oblivion. In Hadrian’s reign the famous sophist Favorinus made a passionate speech to the Corinthians when they took down his statue.48 A generation later Apuleius delivered and published an oration lobbying for a statue in Oea over the objections of his detractors, who were no doubt still angry over his marriage and victory in the Apology. We have the story from Augustine; unfortunately the speech itself is no longer extant.49 Did Apuleius persuade the citizens of Oea? We will probably never know. But there is evidence that other statues were erected to him. A statue base found in Madauros (without the statue) is dedicated by his fellow citizens “To the Platonic Philosopher.”50 Although the name is lacking, Apuleius is the obvious candidate. In Florida 16 Apuleius thanks the citizens of Carthage for voting him one statue, hints that they should put up a second, and states that he had statues in other cities as well.51 47 See Richter, The Portraits of the Greeks 3:282–89; Schefold, Die Bildnisse der antiken Dichter, Redner und Denker. But Zanker argues that many of the statues are portraits of laymen subscribing to “the cult of learning” who have had themselves depicted as philosophers (The Mask of Socrates, 210–66). 48 Favorinus’ statues were pulled down in both Corinth and Athens—perhaps because he had fallen out of favor with Hadrian. His speech to the Corinthians is discussed by Gleason, Making Men, 3–20. 49 “An forte ista [i.e., the trappings of worldly success] ut philosophus voluntate contempsit, qui sacerdos provinciae pro magno fuit, ut munera ederet venatoresque vestiret et pro statua sibi apud Oeenses locanda, ex qua civitate habebat uxorem, adversus contradictionem quorundam civium litigaret? Quod posteros ne lateret, eiusdem litis orationem scriptam memoriae commendavit.” Augustine, Ep. 138.19. 50 “[Ph]ilosopho [Pl]atonico [Ma]daurenses cives ornament[o] suo. D(ecreto) d(ecurionum), p(ecunia) [p(ublica)].” Gsell, ed., Inscriptions latines de l’Algerie 1:2115. But this statue seems not to have been a lasting memorial, for the base was reused in the middle of the fourth century for a dedication to one of the sons of Constantine. Its reverse is inscribed “D(omino) n(ostro), divi C[ons]tanti[ni] Maxim[i ﬁl(io)] . . .” (Gsell, 1:4010). 51 See Lee, Apuleius’ Florida, 145–48; Fl. 16.1 and 36–48 with Lee’s commentary ad loc. It was not uncommon for a philosopher to have several statues in one city: there were at least seventeen statues of Herodes Atticus in Athens. See Richter, The Portraits of the Greeks 3:286.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 13\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:46 PM\n\n14\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nOne statue even found its way to Constantinople, for Christodorus, writing in the ﬁfth century AD, tells us that there was a statue of Apuleius in the Baths of Zeuxippos.52 Here is how he describes it: “And Apuleius was reverent as he considered the ineffable rites of the intellectual Latin Muse. He was a man whom the Italian Siren brought up to be an initiate of arcane wisdom.”53 In keeping with good physiognomical principles, statues and other portraits were judged for their ability to convey their subject’s inner nature and not merely his physical appearance. The images of Alexander the Great, Apuleius tells us, all revealed “the same ﬁerce warrior’s vigor, the same noble nature, the same youthful beauty, and the same attractive high forehead.”54 We can guess some of the qualities that Apuleius would have wanted posterity to see in his own statues: for example, beauty, eloquence, and, above all, philosophical wisdom. Christodorus adds another that he surely would have welcomed, for he characterizes the Apuleius in Constantinople as “an initiate of arcane wisdom.” His language recalls Apuleius’ claim in the Apology to have been initiated in several mystery cults; but it is also metaphorical, since literary education was frequently described as a “mystery,” into which only the elect were “initiated.”55\n\nRole-Playing So far we have been looking at Apuleius’ persona as a handsome celebrity philosopher, a character that he has clearly revealed—or perhaps one should say unambiguously advertised. But there are also places where the picture is less clear, and where Apuleius has deliberately created doubt about who and what he is, raising and leaving open two separate but intersecting questions about his identity. First, is he a magician? Second, what is his relation to Lucius, the hero of the Golden Ass? 52\n\nFor a good discussion, see Scarcia, Latina Siren, 13–18. ϰαὶ νοερηˆϚ ἄφϑεγϰτα ΛατινίδοϚ ὄργια MούσηϚ / ἃζετο παπταίνων ᾽AπολήϊοϚ, ὅντινα μύστην / AὐσονὶϚ ἀρρήτου σοφίηϚ ἐϑρέψατο ∑ειρήν.

In the Apology Apuleius opens his defense on the charge of magic with the question “How do you deﬁne ‘magician’?”56 He suggests a deﬁnition himself with a digression on the “magicians,” or magi, of the Persians—priests who are so venerated that they are entrusted with the education of future kings. Their magic, if that is what he is accused of, is both pleasing to the gods and so highly prized that few are allowed to learn its secrets (Apol. 25.9–26.3). But perhaps, he suggests, his adversaries have in mind the common deﬁnition, that a magician is someone who through communication with the gods can accomplish whatever he wills by the mysterious power of his incantations. In that case, he professes amazement at his opponents’ audacity, for surely anyone who believed that he had such superhuman powers would be afraid to accuse him (Apol. 26.6–9). If both modern readers and Apuleius’ real (or supposed) audience in the courtroom are confused by now, that is what he intends. He continues to blow smoke, and the fog grows thicker and thicker as he explains how he will defend himself: I won’t deny any of the things they claim I have done, whether the charges are true or false, but I will proceed as if they were true, so that this great assembly, which has come to hear the case from near and far, can understand that neither a true charge nor a false allegation can be made against philosophers that they would not be prepared to defend even if they could deny it—such is their conﬁdence in their innocence. First then, I will refute their arguments and prove that they have nothing to do with magic. Then, I will show—even assuming that I was the greatest magician in the world—that there has been neither cause nor opportunity for them to catch me in some act of black magic.57 Apuleius’ language is deliberately murky and convoluted, but his line of defense is simple enough: he admits the various actions he has been charged with (such things as buying ﬁsh, having a slave with a tendency 56 “Quae quidem omnis Aemiliano fuit in isto uno destinata, me magum esse, et ideo mihi libet quaerere ab eruditissimis eius advocatis quid sit magus.” Apol. 25.8. 57 “Atque ego omnia obiecta, seu vera seu falsa sunt, non negabo, sed perinde atque si facta sint fatebor, ut omnis ista multitudo, quae plurima undique ad audiendum convenit, aperte intellegat nihil in philosophos non modo vere dici, sed ne falso quidem posse conﬁngi, quod non ex innocentiae ﬁducia, quamvis liceat negare, tamen potius habeant defendere. Primum igitur argumenta eorum convincam ac refutabo nihil ea ad magian pertinere; dein etsi maxime magus forem, tamen ostendam neque causam ullam neque occasionem fuisse, ut me in aliquo maleﬁcio experirentur.” Apol. 28.2–4.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 15\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:46 PM\n\n16\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nto fainting spells, keeping secret objects under a linen cloth, and owning a black ebony statue of Mercury), argues that they are all related either to his activities as a scientiﬁc philosopher or to his practice of religious mysteries, and maintains that even if the objects in question did have magical uses, he is not necessarily a magician on that account. In each case he teases his audience with his expert knowledge of magic—slyly dropping technical terminology, daring his adversaries to give away their own illicit knowledge by challenging him, and even uttering strings of words that sound like magical curses.58 Then he backs away in a show of innocence. A single example will sufﬁce: the case of the ebony statue that the prosecution described as a hideous skeleton made for the practice of magic.59 Apuleius shows the court his beautiful little statuette, denies that it is anything but an object of religious devotion, and expatiates on its charms. But in fact the statue is of Mercury (Greek Hermes), the god of magic and escort of the dead to Hades. Although Apuleius does not openly acknowledge Mercury’s connection with magic, he clearly conﬁrms it in his attack on Aemilianus—a magical curse if ever there was one: In payment for this lie, Aemilianus, may this god [Mercury] who goes between the lords of heaven and hell bestow on you the hatred of both, and may he always send phantoms of the dead to meet you, and heap up before your eyes every ghost, spectre, spirit, ﬁend, all apparitions that walk by night, all dread dwellers in the tomb, all terrors of the sepulchre—although by age and character you are close enough to them already.60 Yet almost before these bloodcurdling words have sunk in, Apuleius takes off the mask of the magician and becomes the very picture of an innocent philosopher, piously claiming: “But we of the family of Plato 58 See Hunink, Apuleius . . . de Magia, esp. 97–98, 145, 162–63 and ad 31.9, 35.6, 43.2, 44.9, 45.2, 54.2, 64.8. For Apuleius’ “curses,” see Apol. 38.7, 64.1–2, 90.6, and Hunink ad loc. 59 Apol. 61–64.2. See Hunink, Apuleius . . . de Magia, ad loc.; Abt, Die Apologie des Apuleius, 296–303. 60 “At tibi, Aemiliane, pro isto mendacio duit deus iste superum et inferum commeator utrorumque deorum malam gratiam semperque obvias species mortuorum, quicquid umbrarum est usquam, quicquid lemurum, quicquid manium, quicquid larvarum, oculis tuis oggerat, omnia noctium occursacula, omnia bustorum formidamina, omnia sepulcrorum terriculamenta, a quibus tamen aevo et merito haud longe abes.” Apol. 64.1–2.

Philosopher? Or a bit of both? Apuleius satisﬁed the court of his innocence, but in the Apology he leaves a whiff of magic in the air, suggesting more than a passing acquaintance with the dark arts and adding a frisson of danger to his image. Perhaps that is all he intended, but the scent of sulphur was strong enough to convince later generations of his magical powers, especially when they considered the role of magic in the Golden Ass, whose hero and ﬁrst-person narrator readers from late antiquity to the twentieth century almost universally identiﬁed in varying degrees with Apuleius himself. The identiﬁcation of Apuleius with his hero Lucius was largely a natural consequence of using a ﬁrst-person narrator: the “I” of a novel, like the “I” of an oration or poem, invites an autobiographical reading. But Apuleius exploits this effect and plays with it, creating in Lucius a character whose features both differ from and resemble those of his own persona. The differences are great enough to prevent us from eliding Lucius with Apuleius; the resemblances are great enough to encourage the identiﬁcation (and as we shall see presently, one detail positively requires it). From the beginning of the novel Apuleius depicts a hero fundamentally different from himself. Lucius is a Greek from Corinth and a relation of the famous Plutarch,62 whereas Apuleius is a Roman from North Africa. Lucius is credulous and foolish, both as a man and as an ass; Apuleius presents himself as a sophisticated man of the world. Lucius bungles his efforts at magic—or has them bungled for him, when Fotis gives him the wrong ointment (Met. 3.24). The Apuleius we see in the Apology may or may not be an actual magician; he could never be an incompetent one. But Lucius also resembles Apuleius.63 Both men are peripatetic provincial intellectuals of good family. Both have an interest in magic. Both are eloquent orators in both Greek and Latin. Both have ties to Platonic philosophy: Apuleius is an avowed Platonist, and Lucius is related to Plutarch and Sextus, both Middle Platonic philosophers. Perhaps most important, both are initiated more than once into mystery cults, and Lucius’ conversion to Isis is told so powerfully that it has often been taken to reﬂect Apuleius’ own religious experience.64 61 “Ceterum Platonica familia nihil novimus nisi festum et laetum et sollemne et superum et caeleste.” Apol. 64.3. 62 Corinth: Met. 1.22.4, 2.12.3. Plutarch: Met. 1.2.1. For the text of the Metamorphoses, I cite the text of Robertson: Apulée: Les Métamorphoses. 63 See Harrison, Apuleius, 217–18. 64 E.g., by Nock, Conversion, 138–55; Grifﬁths, in Apuleius of Madauros: The Isis Book, 3–7.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 17\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:47 PM\n\n18\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nThese resemblances in themselves, however, are not enough to identify Lucius with Apuleius. Lucius’ experiences need not even be derived or adapted from those of Apuleius.65 In the social and intellectual world of the second century, there must have been many young men not unlike Lucius—aspiring sophists at the beginning of their careers, traveling the world, dabbling in religion and philosophy (and perhaps magic), and eager for sexual and other adventures. If Apuleius had been such a youth, so were many others. It is important to remember, too, that ultimately the ﬁgure of Lucius has its origin in the lost Greek Metamorphoses by “Lucius of Patrae,” from which the plots of both Apuleius’ Metamorphoses and the Onos of Pseudo-Lucian were derived.66 To some extent, however, it is naive to seek Lucius’ identity and relation to Apuleius. He is Apuleius’ creature if not entirely his creation, a persona like that of the magician in the Apology, which the author may assume or set down at will. In the Metamorphoses, too, just as in the Apology and Florida, Apuleius’ real aim is self-display.67 The object is not to identify the “real Apuleius” (or the “real Lucius,” for that matter) but to dazzle the reader by assuming multiple and contradictory personae.68 Not only Lucius’ transformation to an ass and eventual recovery of his human form, but also the changes and confusions in the identities of author, narrator, and other speakers, justify the title Metamorphoses.69 Apuleius draws attention to his impersonations in the Metamorphoses in two famous passages, strategically placed at the beginning and end of the novel. In each he presents the question of his own identity vis-à-vis that of his speaker as a conspicuous and unsolvable problem. In the ﬁrst passage he gives us too few clues to arrive at an answer; in the second the clue leads to an impossible contradiction. The proem (Met. 1.1) explicitly raises the question of the speaker’s identity.70 “Quis ille?” (Who is this?), the speaker asks, and then proceeds 65\n\nPace Harrison, Apuleius, 218. See Mason, “Greek and Latin Versions of the Ass-Story,” with earlier bibliography. Lucius of Patrae was probably the name of the ﬁrst-person narrator of the Greek Metamorphoses, wrongly identiﬁed with the author by the ninth-century patriarch Photios (our only source for the work). See Mason, 1669–71; Winkler, Auctor & Actor, 255. 67 Harrison reaches much the same conclusion: “The problem for a self-promoting sophistic intellectual in writing ﬁctional narrative is that of how to keep the spotlight on himself when not talking about himself. . . . The . . . complex presentation of narrative voice . . . is precisely the kind of strategy which draws attention to the existence and virtuoso status of the work’s author.” Apuleius, 232–33. 68 See especially van der Paardt, “The Unmasked ‘I.’ ” 69 Cf. Winkler, Auctor & Actor, 200: “The entire AA is a playful game of multiple identities.” 70 There is a large bibliography on the prologue. For a starting point, see Kahane and Laird, eds., A Companion to the Prologue of Apuleius’ Metamorphoses. 66\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 18\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:47 PM\n\nApuleius: A Celebrity and His Image\n\n•\n\n19\n\nto describe himself—unhelpfully—as a Greek of Attic, Corinthian, and Spartan stock who has learned Latin in Rome with great difﬁculty and begs pardon for any faults in the language with which he will tell his “Greekish tale” (fabulam Graecanicam). The description ﬁts neither the North African Apuleius nor the Greek Lucius (whose Latin seems perfectly adequate for his career in the Roman law courts at the end of the novel).71 Other answers have been proposed (the speaker is an actor outside the story, like the prologus in Plautine comedy, or perhaps even the book itself, etc.);72 but in fact Apuleius has given us no way to decide. The unidentiﬁable speaker is another of Apuleius’ personae, made deliberately mysterious and intriguing in order to announce and advertise the writer’s protean powers at the opening of his novel. The important detail is the question itself (“quis ille?”): Apuleius is the speaker; what part is he playing now? Near the end of the novel (Met. 11.27) Apuleius ostentatiously forces the reader to confront the problem of his relation to his hero.73 The puzzle is laid out in a vision, which Lucius says was related to him by a priest of Osiris named Asinius Marcellus. (The name is signiﬁcant, as he points out unnecessarily.)74 Asinius says that Osiris himself had urged Lucius’ initiation into his rites: For the previous night, while he was arranging garlands for the great god, he thought he heard from his mouth (with which he pronounces each one’s destiny) that a man from Madauros was being sent to him, a very poor one. He should at once prepare his initiation rites for him; for by his providence the glory of learning was in store for the man and a great reward for himself.75 The subject of the prophecy must be our hero, the Greek Lucius, but as the “man from Madauros” he can be only Apuleius, the North African author. The paradox is a red herring wrapped up in indirect statement, 71\n\nMet. 11.28.6. The point is made by Harrison (Apuleius, 228). For the prologus answer, see Smith, “The Narrative Voice in Apuleius’ Metamorphoses,” and the supporting arguments of Winkler, Auctor & Actor, 200–203. For the book answer, see Harrison, “The Speaking Book.” 73 For other, less conspicuous references to Apuleius at Met 2.12 and 4.32, see van der Paardt, “The Unmasked ‘I,’ ” 105. 74 “Reformationis meae alienum nomen.” Met. 11.27.7. Since minime is a supplement by Robertson, the modern reader is left to decide whether the name Asinius is or is not appropriate to Lucius’ reformation. 75 “Nam sibi visus est quiete proxima, dum magno deo coronas exaptaret, de eius ore, quo singulorum fata dictat, audisse mitti sibi Madaurensem, sed admodum pauperem, cui statim sua sacra deberet ministrare; nam et illi studiorum gloriam et ipsi grande compendium sua comparari providentia.” Met. 11. 27.9. (I print Hanson’s text here. F reads “exaptat et,” printed by both Helm and Robertson, who follow it with a lacuna.) 72\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 19\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:47 PM\n\n20\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nand it smells appropriately ﬁshy.76 Apuleius holds on to it just long enough to put on the mask of Lucius, or perhaps to let Lucius put on the mask of Apuleius, giving the reader a ﬁnal reminder of his powers as an impersonator.77\n\nLasting Impressions Apuleius’ role-playing in the Apology and the Golden Ass superimposed the overlapping images of magician and alter ego of Lucius on his basic persona of philosopher and celebrity. It would be interesting to know how his public reacted to this complex and carefully constructed personality. Unfortunately, the sources are silent: Apuleius is not mentioned by name by any of his contemporaries or by anyone else until the beginning of the fourth century, nearly 150 years after his death.78 Nevertheless, there are some hints that his works were being read in North Africa in the late second and third centuries. A second-century papyrus seems to illustrate the story of Cupid and Psyche, and it has been argued that Tertullian and Arnobius may have been inﬂuenced by the philosophical works.79 Moreover, according to the author of the Historia Augusta, Apuleius was also known to the African emperors Clodius Albinus (d. 197) and Septimius Severus (d. 211). In the Life of Albinus Severus attacks Albinus in a letter to the Roman senate; among his complaints is that Albinus is an enthusiastic reader of Apuleius. Severus says: “It was even more irritating that many of you thought that he deserved to be praised as a man of letters, when he was busying himself with old wives’ nonsense and growing senile among literary triﬂes and the Carthaginian Milesian tales of his friend Apuleius.”80 But unfortunately 76 Harrison (Apuleius, 231) points out “the extraordinarily ambiguous use of pronouns, possessive adjectives, and indirect speech” in the passage: “Here, if anywhere, is a context where identities might become confused and misinterpreted.” 77 See van der Paardt (“The Unmasked ‘I,’ ” 106): “What does the author of an ‘I’novel do? He dons . . . a mask, he becomes someone else: Apuleius of Madauros becomes Lucius of Corinth! . . . [The great god Osiris performs] the last, deﬁnitive metamorphosis: he changes the narrator into what he used to be, the author!” 78 Apuleius is ﬁrst mentioned in Lactantius, Div. inst. 5.3.7. See the next section. 79 The papyrus (PSI VIII 919) shows Psyche (with her lamp?) beside a reclining Cupid. It seems to have been a cartoon for a textile or fresco. See Coppolla, “PSI VIII.919,” 85–87, plate 2; Bassi, “Amore e Psyche”; Cavallo et al., eds., Scrivere libri e documenti nel mondo antico, 2 (color plate), 231–32. For Tertullian and Arnobius, see Moreschini, Apuleio e il Platonismo, 219–40. (But Moreschini’s parallels between Tertullian and Apuleius have been rejected by Barnes; see his Tertullian, 256–58). 80 “Maior fuit dolor, quod illum pro litterato laudandum plerique duxistis, cum ille neniis quibusdam anilibus occupatus inter Milesias Punicas Apulei sui et ludicra litteraria consenesceret.” HA. Alb. 12.12. (Albinus also seems to have written Milesian tales himself;\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 20\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:47 PM\n\nApuleius: A Celebrity and His Image\n\n•\n\n21\n\nthis gratifyingly circumstantial reference is inconclusive. Perhaps Albinus really was wasting his time with Apuleius’ stories and was criticized for it by Severus, but there is no way to be sure that the story antedates the late fourth century, usually taken to be the time of composition of the Historia Augusta. Even without ﬁrm testimonia, however, we can still infer that Apuleius did make an impression on his immediate posterity and that his efforts to create and manage his image had largely succeeded, for the persona that emerges in the fourth century bears a strong resemblance to the one we saw in the second—although with his features more sharply delineated, as if his second- and third-century audience had silently accepted, consolidated, and embellished the picture that he had presented to them. The late antique Apuleius is still a philosopher, still a celebrity in his native North Africa, and now unquestionably both a famous magician and the alter ego of Lucius. He has also acquired some new features while we weren’t looking, for he is now a ﬁgure in both Christian and pagan polemic and Constantinian art. In these new theaters of operation he shares the stage with more important actors, appearing with Apollonius of Tyana in the former and Vergil in the latter. The late-antique persona of Apuleius, however, is by no means consistent or stable, for it varies with the eye (and the purposes) of the beholder, and it changes over time. The dominant facets of his personality are always the magician and the philosopher, but in different proportions and with different emphases from one age to another. In the rest of this chapter we will consider the reception of Apuleius’ image in three periods: the fourth century and ﬁrst decade of the ﬁfth (Lactantius to Jerome), the second and third decades of the ﬁfth century (Augustine), and the early Middle Ages.\n\nDivided Self? In the period from Lactantius to Jerome, Apuleius is still both magician and philosopher, but with one interesting exception he is no longer both at once. We might almost say that for most of the century he has a split personality: he is a magician in Christian and pagan polemic and a philosopher in Constantinian art. Although he was being read (as subscriptions in our oldest manuscript of the Apology, Metamorphoses, see HA Alb. 11.8.) The term “Milesian tales,” derived from the racy Milesiaca of Aristides of Miletus (ca. 100 BC), seems originally to have referred to short, obscene stories but was later used almost as a generic term for ﬁction. Apuleius describes the style of the Golden Ass as “sermone . . .

Neither can be taken as a portrait of the “real” Apuleius, but, as we shall see, each seems to be inspired by his writings. Apuleius appears ﬁrst as a magician. Our source is a fellow North African, the Christian apologist Lactantius, who mentions him brieﬂy in his Divine Institutes somewhere between 305 and 313.82 Lactantius, a sufferer in Diocletian’s Great Persecution of the Christians, is arguing against the pagan Hierocles, who is usually identiﬁed as one of the prime movers of the persecution.83 In his now lost polemical work To the Christians, Hierocles had claimed that Apollonius of Tyana performed wonders even greater than the miracles attributed to Christ.84 Now Lactantius professes to be amazed that he had not named Apuleius as well: “It’s a wonder that Hierocles overlooked Apuleius,” he exclaims, “for people like to talk about his many marvels, too.”85 Apollonius of Tyana, whom Hierocles had deemed so superior to Christ, was a ﬁrst-century neo-Pythagorean and holy man famous as a wonderworker.86 His asceticism, wisdom, miraculous cures, and resurrection 81 For the subscriptions in the archetype of the text of the Apology, Metamorphoses, and Florida, see chapter 2. 82 The dates 304–312 are given by Barnes, “Porphyry Against the Christians: Date and the Attribution of Fragments,” 439. In Constantine and Eusebius, 291 n. 96, Barnes ﬁxes the date at 308–9. In a personal communication, Oliver Nicholson more conservatively dates the work between 305 and 313. For a modern translation, see Lactantius, Divine Institutes, trans. Bowen and Garnsey. 83 We know too little about the life and movements of Lactantius (ca. 250–325). For convenient accounts, see Lactantius, De Mortibus Persecutorum, ed. Creed, xxv–xxix; Bowen and Garnsey, trans., in Lactantius, Divine Institutes, 1–6. He was teaching rhetoric in Nicomedia in Bithynia in 303 when the Great Persecution began (Div. inst. 5.2.2) and lost his position. He apparently left Nicomedia and wrote and published the ﬁrst edition of the Divinae institutiones in the western part of the empire, either in Gaul or in his native Africa. (Barnes, in Constantine and Eusebius, 291 n. 96, argues for North Africa.) For Hierocles, see Barnes, “Sossianus Hierocles.” 84 Forrat believes that Hierocles wrote his tract while he was serving as vicarius, well before the beginning of the persecution in 303, implying a date sometime in the late 290s (Eusebius, Contre Hiéroclès, 11–20). Barnes dates the tract to around 303 (“Sossianus Hierocles”). 85 The section reads as follows (the italicized words are translated in the text): “Idem [i.e., Hierocles] cum facta eius [i.e., Christi] mirabilia destrueret nec tamen negaret, voluit ostendere ‘Apollonium vel paria vel etiam maiora fecisse.’ Mirum quod Apuleium praetermisit, cuius solent multa et mira memorari” Div. inst. 5.3.7. 86 See Philostratus, The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, trans, Jones. For later accounts, see Speyer, “Zum Bild des Apollonius von Tyana”; Bowie, “Apollonius of Tyana”; Forrat, in Eusebius, Contre Hiéroclès, 29–55.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 22\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:47 PM\n\nApuleius: A Celebrity and His Image\n\n•\n\n23\n\nfrom the dead made him a natural rival to Christ in anti-Christian polemics. Perhaps best of all from the pagan point of view was the story that he had escaped the wrath of the emperor Domitian by disappearing into thin air, thus showing himself a better magician than Christ, whose encounter with Roman authority had ended so differently.87 It is impossible to be sure when Apollonius made his ﬁrst appearance in religious polemic. The difﬁculty arises because our only evidence for the pagan side comes from the refutations of Christian apologists, who were always partisan and sometimes had only indirect or hearsay access to the work of their pagan opponents. Perhaps Hierocles was the ﬁrst to invoke Apollonius, as Eusebius claimed in his polemic Against Hierocles around 311–12.88 Or perhaps the famous pagan apologist Porphyry had invoked him a few years earlier in his work Against the Christians.89 The important point for us is that at the end of the third century Apollonius had the prestige and qualiﬁcations to be presented as a match for Christ and the apostles and that at least one pagan apologist (Hierocles) took advantage of the fact. But Hierocles did not mention Apuleius, and it is likely that no one else did either until Lactantius invoked his name in the Divine Institutes. Apuleius’ fame was no match for that of Apollonius, and he had no biographer like Philostratus to preserve his memory. But he was known in North Africa, and Lactantius brings him into the debate, invoking him not as a writer but as a personality and ﬁgure of the popular imagination. Perhaps Lactantius had read some of Apuleius’ works (although we cannot be sure of it); but in the Divine Institutes he is clearly recalling North African tales and oral tradition. Apuleius himself 87 Philostratus, Vita Apoll. 8.5. See also Lactantius, Div. inst. 5.3.9, and Eusebius, Contra Hier. 38, both evidently quoting Hierocles. 88 Contra Hier. 1.2: “Only he [Hierocles], among all those who have ever written against us, has produced a formal contrast and comparison of Apollonius with our savior” (Jones, trans., Eusebius’s Reply to Hierocles, in Philostratus, Apollonius of Tyana, 157). For the date, see Forrat, in Eusebius, Contre Hiéroclès, 25; Barnes argues for ca. 303 (“Sossianus Hierocles”). 89 Porphyry’s work is dated between 270 and 303. For a date of ca. 271–72, see Croke, “The Era of Porphyry’s Anti-Christian Polemic.” Barnes favors a date of around or after 300: “Porphyry Against the Christians”; “Scholarship or Propaganda?” Fragments 4, 46, 60, and 63 of Porphyry mention Apollonius (fragments 4 and 46 also mention Apuleius); but all these fragments date from the late fourth or ﬁfth century, and only fragment 4 is now considered authentic (see the discussion of Jerome later in this section). Fragments 60 and 63 belong to a group of texts from the fourth- or ﬁfth-century apologist Makarius of Magnesia that most modern scholars consider wrongly attributed to Porphyry; see Barnes, “Porphyry Against the Christians,” 428–30; Meredith, “Porphyry and Julian Against the Christians,” 1126–28. Benoit relegates these fragments, as well as fragment 46 (from Augustine, Ep. 102.32; see below), to the general stock of anti-Christian polemics (“Le ‘Contra Christianos’ de Porphyre”).\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 23\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:47 PM\n\n24\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\ncannot have been Lactantius’ source, since he claims no marvelous or supernatural accomplishments in any of his works. After Lactantius the linking of Apuleius and Apollonius became a ﬁxture in Christian polemic. Jerome, writing a hundred years later, at the beginning of the ﬁfth century, again mentions the pair as magicians.90 He is refuting Porphyry, who had evidently argued that Christian claims were based primarily on miracles and that the apostles worked their wonders for the sake of gain. Someone might say, “They did all this for money.” For this is what Porphyry says: “The poor and uneducated men, since they had nothing, worked some wonders with magic arts. But it is no great thing to perform wonders. The magicians in Egypt also performed wonders against Moses. Apollonius performed wonders, and so did Apuleius: in fact, they performed boundless wonders.” I grant you, Porphyry, that they performed wonders with their magic arts in order to get money from silly rich women whom they had seduced. For this is what you say.91 The passage is interesting on several counts: as a contribution to the fragments of Porphyry’s lost Against the Christians, as an example of Jerome’s polemical method, and as evidence for the late-antique knowledge of Apuleius. Jerome’s quotation of Porphyry (listed as fragment 4 of Against the Christians) begins with the words “The poor and uneducated men” and concludes three sentences later with the clause “in fact, they performed boundless wonders.”92 This is the only unquestionably authentic fragment of Porphyry that mentions Apollonius and Apuleius. The authenticity of the fragment as a whole, however, does not guarantee the authenticity of everything in it. Barnes claims that Jerome knew Porphyry only indirectly.93 But it is just as likely that he was using or remembering 90\n\nFor the date, see Jay, “Jérôme à Bethléem,” 377–78. “Dicat aliquis: Hoc totum lucri causa fecerunt. Hoc enim dicit Porphyrius: Homines rusticani et pauperes, quoniam nihil habebant, magicis artibus operati sunt quaedam signa. Non est autem grande facere signa. Nam fecerunt signa et in Aegypto magi contra Moysen. Fecit et Apollonius, fecit et Apuleius: et inﬁnita signa fecerunt. Concedo tibi, Porphyri, magicis artibus signa fecerunt, ut divitias acciperent a divitibus mulierculis, quas induxerant: hoc enim tu dicis” Jerome, Tractatus de Psalmo lxxxi, 225–32. 92 “Homini rusticani et pauperes . . . inﬁnita signa fecerunt.” See Meredith, “Porphyry and Julian Against the Christians,” 1130 n. 16. The standard edition of the fragments is still that of Harnack, “Porphyrius ‘Gegen die Christen.’ ” Harnack (pp. 46–47) treats the words “divitias . . . induxerant” as a quotation, as if from Porphyry. 93 Barnes, “Scholarship or Propaganda?” 54. Barnes also argues (53) that Porphyry’s Contra Christianos was suppressed by Constantine and asserts: “It is extremely hard to ﬁnd authors writing after 325 who report the contents of the work at ﬁrst hand.” 91\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 24\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:48 PM\n\nApuleius: A Celebrity and His Image\n\n•\n\n25\n\nan interpolated text, for it would be surprising if some changes had not crept into it during the intervening century of religious polemic. Jerome was also capable of adding touches of his own if it suited his satirical purposes, as the name of Apuleius does here. With the reference to Apuleius’ use of magic to achieve his mercenary marriage, Jerome manages not only to make a last-minute riposte to Porphyry’s slur on the supposed venality of the apostles (and to trump it) but also to allude to the allegation made by Porphyry’s detractors that he, too, had married a rich elderly widow for her money.94 It is important to note, however, that Jerome’s citation of Apuleius as a magician is different in kind from that of Lactantius. Even if he is invoking only Apuleius’ image, the image is at least one clearly related to his works and not merely a piece of apocryphal ﬂotsam. Jerome knows about the Apology even if he has not read it—or at least he knows enough to be familiar with its charge that Apuleius won his rich wife by sorcery. If he also knows the fact that Apuleius claimed to be innocent, his satirical nature and polemical purposes are such that he happily overlooks it. Apuleius appears as a philosopher very soon after he is ﬁrst mentioned as a magician, in the early decades of the fourth century. The evidence this time is both artistic and literary, and the context is Constantinian. Apuleius has been identiﬁed on a painted ceiling in Trier, and he had a bronze statue in the Baths of Zeuxippos at Constantinople, as we have seen. In both cases Vergil is part of the program. Trier was one of Constantine’s capital cities. In the early fourth century it housed some of the imperial family, including the emperor’s son Crispus, and perhaps Crispus’ tutor Lactantius as well. The last point is unveriﬁable, since we do not know the date or locale of Lactantius’ service.95 It is tantalizing because of the suggestion that Lactantius might have had a part in determining the program of the ceiling, which probably belonged to a reception room in an imperial residence.96 The room was constructed after 315 and demolished in 326, when work began on the foundations of Trier Cathedral.97 At that time the ceiling collapsed, and the pieces fell down more or less in place, a happy 94 The story appears in a fragment of the Theosophia of Aristokritos (ﬁfth century) quoted by Buresch, Klaros, 124. See Harnack, “Porphyry ‘Gegen die Christen,’ ” 40–41 (Zeugnis xxvi b). Harnack (p. 4) argues that it is derived from Eusebius’ work against Porphyry. 95 Lactantius’ service probably began before 317, when Crispus was appointed Caesar. See Creed, in Lactantius, De mortibus persecutorum, xxvii. 96 Simon, Die konstantinischen Deckengemälde in Trier, 19. 97 See Weber, Constantinische Deckengemälde; Simon, Die konstantinischen Deckengemälde.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 25\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:48 PM\n\n26\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\ncircumstance that has permitted a nearly complete reconstruction (see plate 1).98 The rectangular painting is divided into ﬁfteen panels—three on the short sides and ﬁve on the long. Seven panels showing busts of male and female ﬁgures alternate checkerboard fashion with eight panels showing pairs of putti or Erotes with different attributes. The putti appear on each of the four corners, in the centers of the long sides and on either side of the central bust in the middle row. Three of the busts represent elderly men (apparently poets or philosophers); the other four seem to be either portraits or personiﬁed virtues. There are no inscriptions to identify the ﬁgures in any of the panels. Several interpretations of the ceiling’s program have been proposed, but the most convincing is that of Erika Simon, who has identiﬁed the three “philosophers” as Vergil, Apuleius, and Heraclitus, one of the “portraits” as Apollo, and the others as personiﬁed virtues associated with Constantine’s wife, Fausta.99 Simon dates the painting not long after 315 and reads its message as predominantly solar and imperial rather than overtly Christian (although she notes that the panels of putti around the central bust are arranged in a cruciform pattern). The essential part of her argument for the present discussion is her identiﬁcation of the elderly men on the two short sides as Vergil and Apuleius. Each is identiﬁed by the attributes of the putti juxtaposed with his portrait. The putti around the image of Vergil have attributes appropriate to the Fourth Eclogue, which prophesies a new golden age of Apollo: the horn of plenty; a standing vessel, perhaps for wine; and a whip and charioteer’s cloak evoking Apollo, the charioteer of the sun.100 The corresponding bust at the other end is marked as a philosopher by his cloak and beard. The paired ﬁgures above him are not the same putti as in the other panels, but rather Cupid and Psyche from the Golden Ass (see plate 2). The philosopher, therefore, can only be Apuleius (see plate 3). The panel of Cupid and Psyche illustrates a particular moment in the story, as Simon has deduced from the ﬂat box or tray in Psyche’s hand.101 It is the object of her last labor: the box of beauty that she was to fetch from Proserpina in Hades and present—unopened— to Venus. But she violated the taboo. When she opened the box, she was immediately engulfed in a Stygian sleep, in which she would have remained if Cupid had not awakened her with a painless touch of his arrow (Met. 6.21.3). The panel shows Psyche and Cupid just after 98 For color illustrations of the reconstructed ceiling, see Weber, Constantinische Deckengemälde, and Simon, Die konstantinischen Deckengemälde. 99 Simon, Die konstantinischen Deckengemälde, 19–37. 100 The images are also appropriate to the prophetic passages in the Aeneid anticipating the reign of Augustus. See Rodgers, “Constantine’s Pagan Vision.” 101 Simon, Die konstantinischen Deckengemälde, 20–21.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 26\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:48 PM\n\nApuleius: A Celebrity and His Image\n\n•\n\n27\n\nher awakening and their joyous reunion. She is about to complete her task, after which she will be taken to Olympus and receive the gift of immortality. Simon has seen that the image of Cupid and Psyche identiﬁes the philosopher in the adjacent panel as Apuleius, but we can also turn the argument around to say that Apuleius’ character as a philosopher is linked to Cupid and Psyche. We can infer both that the author of the ceiling’s program has derived his conception of Apuleius as a philosopher from the novel and, conversely, that he sees the story of Cupid and Psyche as important and serious. The panel represents not merely the happy ending of a romance but an event of philosophical and religious signiﬁcance. Its meaning is clear enough: Psyche (“Soul”)—though undeserving, as her box reminds us—has been saved by Love and will soon achieve eternal happiness. This message, like Vergil’s prophecy of a new golden age, is not necessarily Christian but still consistent with Christian ideas—a nice compromise for a Constantinian work so soon after the emperor’s famous conversion in 312. Psyche’s presence on the ceiling in Trier, like her appearance on the second-century papyrus, is precious evidence of early interest in Apuleius’ story. The image in Trier, however, is more informative, for its context and placement also allow us to infer the artist’s interpretation and to see it as an important anticipation of later allegorical treatments, like those of Martianus Capella and Fulgentius to be examined in the next chapter. About a decade or so after the painting in Trier, Apuleius appeared in another Constantinian installation. His statue was placed in a large collection of sculpture arrayed in the Baths of Zeuxippos in Constantinople for the dedication of the city in 330 AD.102 Our source is the late ﬁfthcentury Byzantine poet Christodorus, who describes eighty-one statues in the baths.103 Although Christodorus lists many Greek poets, historians, and philosophers in his ecphrasis, he names only two Roman writers: Apuleius and Vergil.104 The program of the statues has not been satisfactorily explained, and perhaps Christodorus, writing 150 years after the fact, did not understand it himself. The points that matter for our purposes, however, are Apuleius’ depiction as a philosopher and the fact that he and Vergil are the only Roman writers whose statues we 102 For Christodorus’ description of the statue, see p. 14. For the baths and their program, see, with earlier bibliography, Bassett, “Historiae custos” and The Urban Image of Late Antique Constantinople, 51–57, 160–85. 103 Christodorus’ ecphrasis as we have it is probably incomplete: it lacks both preface and conclusion, and it is conceivable that descriptions of some statues have dropped out. See Bassett, “Historiae custos,” 495. 104 Apuleius: Anth. Pal 2.303–5; Vergil: Anth. Pal 2.414–16.\n\n02_Gaisser_Ch01_p001-p039.indd 27\n\n10/8/2007 4:23:48 PM\n\n28\n\n•\n\nChapter 1\n\nknow appeared in the collection. The singling out of Apuleius and Vergil, so soon after the installation of the ceiling in Trier, suggests that the designer of the program was associating them in a similar way, or at the very least that he was recalling their appearance in Trier. Christodorus himself, however, does not treat the two statues as a pair, and there is no evidence that they appeared next to each other.105 Apuleius makes his last appearance in the visual arts of antiquity at the end of the fourth century. This imaginary portrait, on a Roman contorniate, or circus medal, is the only surviving ancient image accompanied by an identifying inscription (see plate 4).106 The contorniate shows Apuleius in proﬁle as a beautiful beardless youth, wide-eyed, and with shoulder-length curls held neatly in place by a ﬁllet. The depiction was surely inspired by passages in the Florida and Apology. The ﬁllet alludes to the priesthood he mentions in Florida 16, while the artfully casual coiffure recalls both the beautiful long hair criticized by his opponents in the Apology and the ﬂowing locks of his alter ego Apollo in Florida 3.107 The portrait surely would have been more to Apuleius’ taste than those in Trier and Constantinople, for it is one he might have commissioned himself: “Apuleius the Platonic philosopher as Apollo.” But of course Apuleius did not commission the portrait. The contorniate is a product of the complex social, intellectual, and religious world of late fourth-century Rome, and its iconography was selected by a fourth-century designer or patron to reﬂect contemporary interests. The image is by no means a generic portrait. It is not only unlike the previous representations of Apuleius that we know about (the bearded philosopher shown on the Trier ceiling and probably in his various statues as well), but also without parallel among the hundreds of real and imaginary portraits on the contorniates. No doubt one of the designer’s motives for choosing Apuleius’ verbal self-portait as his model in preference to the existing material representations and conventional philosopher portraits was that he knew Apuleius’ text and wanted to advertise it. In the 390s Apuleius was of some interest in Rome, as we shall see in the next chapter. But he may have had something else in mind as 105 The two descriptions are handled differently, and they are separated by over a hundred lines. 106 There are two copies of the medal.
