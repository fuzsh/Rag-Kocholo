        "text": "\"I WOULD love to be able to say, 'I plumb toilets', and have someone say, 'Now that's something I've always wanted to do'.\"\n\nSo says Kenny Smyth (Shane Jacobson), an irrepressible knight in shining dungarees from Melbourne-based Splashdown, a company responsible for supplying and maintaining Portaloos at major festivals and events.\n\nOverweight, unlucky in love, and burdened with a slight speech impediment, Kenny is the unlikely hero of Clayton Jacobson's big-hearted mockumentary, which was a smash hit in Australia.\n\nWith cameras tracking his every movement, Kenny introduces us to his colleagues at the company with the motto \"We're number one with your number two's\".\n\nWith an endless supply of similarly charming maxims about waste management such as \"There's a smell in here that's gonna outlast religion\", Kenny contends with rudeness from the general public and his own father, Billy.\n\nA trip to the International Pumper and Cleaner Expo in Nashville sparks a potential romance with air hostess Jackie (Eve Von Bibra), and a possible business venture.\n\nThe stylistic conceit of a fly-on-the-wall expose is forgotten during the scenes of the film in America, when Kenny stops addressing the camera and focuses his attentions instead on the lovely Jackie.\n\nBy then, we're good friends with the eponymous everyman, whose larger than life personality leaves very little room for the other characters to get a word in edgeways.\n\nThe script, by Jacobson brothers Shane and Clayton, is littered with belly laughs. A big man in a small film, Kenny deserves to be flushed with success.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nKNIGHT IN SHINING DUNGAREES: Shane Jacobson as Kenny Smyth."
