That being subjective, we have erred on the side of inclusiveness.\n\nIf someone isn't on the list who should be it's just an oversight and they will be added upon request. Any assistance with improving the completeness of this list is appreciated.\n\nIf a name appears to be missing, check that you are looking up the surname the person had whilst at Era, as name changes are common.\n\nFor corrections and additions contact Guy West\n\nYou can also contact Guy to be sent a comprehensive Era database in Excel format."
