        "text": "Systems and Networking Ph.D. Qualifier Exam\n\nSpring 2006\n\nExamining Faculty\n\nGodmar Back (exam chair)\n\nKirk Cameron\n\nDenis Gracanin\n\nExamination Format\n\nWritten Questions\n\nEach year, the Systems/Networking faculty publishes a reading list of 10 – 15 papers in the second half of Fall semester and a list of integrative research questions during the winter break. The deadline for students to provide written answers to the research questions is usually within first few weeks of Spring semester. The goal of the written exam is to evaluate the student’s ability to creatively integrate content from the constituent systems research areas.\n\nWritten Questions from 2006.\n\nSee Past Exams.\n\nOral Exam\n\nThe written exam will be followed by an oral exam, where the student is expected to defend his/her solutions. Unless specifically requested, the student is not expected to make a formal presentation. In the oral exams, faculty may ask questions about any paper in the reading list to assess the student’s understanding of the subject. Oral exams will be scheduled individually for each student.\n\nAssessment\n\nAfter the oral examination, the examining faculty will determine the student's score for the examination process. The score is between 0 – 3 points, depending on the student's performance on both the written and oral components. These points may be applied toward the total score of 6 points necessary to qualify for the Ph.D. The assessment criteria, as defined by GPC, are as follows:\n\n3: Excellent performance, beyond that normally expected or required for a PhD student.\n\n2: Performance appropriate for PhD-level work. Prime factors for assessment include being able to distinguish good work from poor work, and explain why; being able to synthesize the body of work into an assessment of the state-of-the-art on a problem (as indicated by the collection of papers); being able to identify open problems and suggest future work.\n\n1: While the student adequately understands the content of the work, the student is deficient in one or more of the factors listed for assessment under score value of 2. A score of 1 is the minimum necessary for an MS-level pass.\n\n0: Student's performance is such that the committee considers the student unable to do PhD-level work in Computer Science.\n\nReading List\n\nK.
