        "text": "Vowels\n\n[edit]\n\nSwedish is notorious for its extra vowel sounds, giving Swedish nine (!) different vowels. Most are pronounced differently than English, and some don't even have a true English equivalent; some may be close, but sound like a combination of two vowel sounds. This can be very confusing, but you probably won't hear enough Swedish to know the difference, as they can be very slight. If you don't get it exactly, you may still be understood. All vowels can be pronounced short or long which means that Swedish has 17 different vowel sounds (short e and short ä is the same).\n\nPlease note: in Swedish 'Y' is a vowel and not a consonant. Å, Ä and Ö are letters in their own right, in the end of the alphabet past Z.\n\na\n\nlike 'a' in \"father.\"\n\ne\n\nshort: like 'e' in \"bed\" or \"pen.\" long: like 'ey' in \"hey,\" but longer. Can sometimes sound slightly like \"Ay-uh;\" because the Swedish pronunciation is longer. E's are usually pronounced at the end of a word, such as in \"kaffe\" (pronounced kaff-eh, meaning coffee), unlike English where e's at the end of a word are usually silent.\n\ni\n\nshort: like 'i' in \"India\" long: like 'i' in \"machine.\" Fairly straightforward.\n\no\n\nlike 'u' in \"put,\" but not exactly. It's somewhere between that and the 'o' in \"broken\" in actuality.\n\nu\n\nlike 'ou' in \"you.\"\n\ny\n\nlike 'y' in \"Nitroglycerin.\" This is one of the harder ones to learn. Easiest way is to round your lips (important) and say \"bee.\" It may sound closer to an English short 'i' sound to some people.\n\nå\n\nlike 'au' in \"Paul\" generally speaking. Similar to å in Danish.\n\nä\n\nidentical to the ä in German (sounds like an \"e\" as in \"bet\". Pronounced with more bass if preceding r. Corresponds to æ in Danish and Norwegian.\n\nö\n\nSame as in German. Pronounced with more bass if preceding r. Corresponds to ø in Danish and Norwegian.\n\nThe pronunciation of u and y varies quite a lot between regions; all native speakers make a clear distinction, although the u of somebody may be close to y of somebody else.\n\nConsonants\n\n[edit]\n\nConsonants are closer to English, but some combinations can be downright tricky, i.e. 'sj' in \"sjutton.\" Some pronunciations depend on the vowel following it, and so the vowels are divided into \"soft\" and \"hard\" vowels. A, o, u, and å are the hard vowels, and e, i, y, ä, and ö are the soft vowels. There are also some combinations of letters treated as a group for the purpose of pronunciation (e.g. ch, ng, sch, sj, tj).\n\nb\n\nlike 'b' in \"bed\"\n\nc\n\nlike 'c' in \"cat\", sometimes 's' like the first c in circus; a 'ch' combination is sometimes pronounced like English 'sh', but pronounced like a 'k' in the word och.\n\nd\n\nlike 'd' in \"dog\"\n\nf\n\nlike 'f' in \"for\"\n\ng\n\nlike 'g' in \"go\", when preceding a hard vowel, like 'y' in \"yellow\" when preceding a soft vowel or after an 'r'. A 'gn' pronunciation is pronounced like an English 'g', except for when it follows a vowel, in which case it is pronounced 'ng+n.'\n\nh\n\nlike 'h' in \"help\". A superfluous silent 'h' is common in names (e.g. Elisabet and Elisabeth are pronounced the same).\n\nj\n\nlike 'y' in \"yell,\" and if there is a d, g, or h before a 'j' then that letter is silent.\n\nk\n\nlike 'k' in \"king\" before a hard vowel, like 'sh' before a soft one. 'Kj' is pronounced 'sh' as well\n\nl\n\nlike 'l' in \"love,\" but 'lj' is pronounced like a 'y'\n\nm\n\nlike 'm' in \"mother\"\n\nn\n\nlike 'n' in \"nice\", like 'ng' in \"song\" when preceding k\n\nng\n\nnot a letter; like 'ng' in \"song\"\n\np\n\nlike 'p' in \"pig\"\n\nq\n\nlike 'q' in \"quest\" (with \"u\", almost always)\n\nr\n\nLike a Scottish or Spanish 'r': trilled with the tip of your tongue at the roof of your mouth. S in 'Rs' is pronounced 'sh'.\n\ns\n\nlike 'ss' in \"hiss,\" but 'skj' and 'stj' are pronounced 'sh.' 'Sj' is hard for non-native speakers – try rounding your lips and saying \"hwoo\" to get the gist of it. 'Sk' is also pronounced this way before soft vowels.\n\nt\n\nlike 't' in \"top\"\n\ntj\n\nnot a letter; like 'ssy' in \"kiss you\"\n\nv\n\nlike 'v' in \"victory\"\n\nw\n\nlike 'v' in \"victor,\" but w's in Swedish are uncommon.\n\nx\n\nlike 'cks' in \"kicks\", like 'ehcks' at beginning of a word.\n\nz\n\nlike 's' in \"saw\"\n\nPlaces\n\n[edit]\n\nIf going to Sweden, especially if going to any other place than Stockholm, probably the most important thing you should know in Swedish is the name of the place you are going to. Most people speak very good, fluent English, but are oblivious about the English pronunciation of the town/city you may want to visit – and this may cause significant issues at train stations, airports or bus stations since many places have pronunciations that are very different from what an English speaker would expect when looking at the written name.\n\nGothenburg\n\nGöteborg (YOO-te-bore-eh) with the 'te' as in Television or ten. Some may understand the English pronunciation, but don't take that for granted.\n\nUmeå\n\n(YOU-meh-oh, or YOU-meh in the northern accent that is spoken close to Umeå). Note that neither pronunciation here is a really close approximation of the actual way a Swede will pronounce, but the å sound really has no correspondent in most standard English accents. Do not pronounce it Oo-mej-aah, as nobody will understand you, and you will be asked to show on the map)\n\nLuleå\n\n(Lyu-leh-oh). Lyu sounds close to how some dialects of English would read the lu in luminous, or to the way others would read the lew in lewd. If you find this hard, try to pronounce Skellefteå (Huell-eff-teh-oh or Shell-eff-teh-oh). Note that the u and the second h in the first pronunciation are nearly unsounded.\n\nVäxjö\n\n(Vac h'oh), as if the two would be different words. The oh sound is close to the French eau, so don't stress the o in 'ho' though (as you would do in ho-ho-ho). Don't pronounce it as Vaks-joe, since no one will have any clue what that is.\n\nKöping\n\n(is pronounced almost like English 'shopping'). There are many köpings in Sweden (Norrköping, Nyköping, Köping, Söderköping), and in all, the köping part is pronounced identically. Nyköping (the small Ryanair airport for Stockholm, also known as Skavsta) is pronounced Ne-Shopping, with the Ne as in Nemo.\n\nÖland\n\n(eu-land) and\n\nÅland\n\n(O'-land), two rather large islands off the Eastern coast of Sweden. For an English speaker, their pronunciation can sound very, very similar. A confusion between the two can easily be a disaster (Åland is in Finland), so if in doubt over the exact pronunciation, either write them down, or refer to something that would distinguish them (their biggest cities, Åland to be the 'Finnish island' or the 'Ferry island', Öland the 'Swedish island' or the 'Island with the bridge'), so that you don't accidentally end up in the wrong place.\n\nGötaland\n\n(Yottalaand) and\n\nGotland\n\n(Got laand or even 'Got land', as it would sound in English). Again two very different places, this time both in Sweden, not looking very different in spelling, but pronounced in a very different fashion.\n\nÅre\n\n- Oh-reh, not Ah-reh.\n\nMany other places are pronounced in rather simpler, less tongue twisting fashions. Stockholm, Kiruna, Malmö sound in Swedish very much like they do English. If taking the train or plane to Copenhagen, remember the Swedish spelling is Köpenhamn, and is pronounced Shop-en-hamn. As most train stations do not have public announcements or information boards in English, this may be useful. Similarly, in Sweden, Helsinki is always referred to as Helsingfors (Helsing-forsh), and all roadsigns and announcements within Sweden use this term. If you want to take the ferry to Turku in Finland, remember the Swedes call the city Åbo (a close pronunciation being Oh-boh). And if going to Norway, Oslo is pronounced in a fashion rather close to the one in English.\n\nTime\n\n[edit]\n\nnow\n\nnu (noo)\n\nlater\n\nsenare (seenareh)\n\nbefore\n\nföre (fureh)\n\nmorning\n\nmorgon (mohrgon)\n\nafternoon\n\neftermiddag (ehftermeedag)\n\nevening\n\nkväll (kvehll)\n\nnight\n\nnatt (nat)\n\nClock time\n\n[edit]\n\nAM and PM are not used in Swedish, but either the 24-hour clock or a 12-hour clock with AM or PM inferred from the context. Sometimes informal expressions are used to clarify: klockan två i natt (at two o'clock tonight), tre på eftermiddagen (three in the afternoon), nio på morgonen (nine in the morning).\n\nIn writing, the 24-hour clock is used exclusively.\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nVad är klockan?

Instead, the half hours expressed are halves of the coming hour, so 1:30 becomes \"half two\".\n\n1:30 pm\n\nHalv två (hahlv tvoo)\n\nDuration\n\n[edit]\n\n_____ minute/minutes (ago)\n\n_____ minut/minuter (sedan) (meenoot/meenootar (sahdahn))\n\n_____ hour/hours (ago)\n\n_____ timme/timmar (sedan) (teemah/teemahr (sahdahn))\n\n_____ day/days (ago)\n\n_____ dag/dagar (sedan) (daag/daagahr (sahdahn))\n\n_____ week/weeks (ago)\n\n_____ vecka/veckor (sedan) (vacka/vackor (sahdahn))\n\n_____ month/months (ago)\n\n_____ månad/månader (sedan) (moonad/moonadar (sahdahn))\n\n_____ year/years (ago)\n\n_____ år/år (sedan) (ohr/ohr (sahdahn))\n\nDays\n\n[edit]\n\ntoday\n\nidag (ee dahg)\n\ntonight\n\ninatt (ee nat)\n\nyesterday\n\nigår (ee goor)\n\nyesternight\n\nigår natt (ee goor nat)\n\nthe day before yesterday\n\ni förrgår (ee fur goor)\n\ntomorrow\n\nimorgon (ee moor goon)\n\nthe day after tomorrow\n\ni övermorgon (ee uh vahr moorgoon)\n\nthis week\n\ndenna vecka (dehn a vecka)\n\nlast week\n\nförra veckan (fur a veckan)\n\nnext week\n\nnästa vecka (nesta vecka)\n\nPlease note that the first day of the week in Sweden is Monday, not Sunday.\n\nMonday\n\nmåndag (moon daag)\n\nTuesday\n\ntisdag (Tees daag)\n\nWednesday\n\nonsdag (oons daag)\n\nThursday\n\ntorsdag (toosh daag)\n\nFriday\n\nfredag (fraah daag)\n\nSaturday\n\nlördag (lur daag)\n\nSunday\n\nsöndag (Sun daag)\n\nMonths\n\n[edit]\n\nJanuary\n\njanuari (yaan oo ah ree)\n\nFebruary\n\nfebruari (fab roo ah ree)\n\nMarch\n\nmars (maas)\n\nApril\n\napril (aa preel)\n\nMay\n\nmaj (my)\n\nJune\n\njuni (yoo nee)\n\nJuly\n\njuli (yoo lee)\n\nAugust\n\naugusti (ao goo stee)\n\nSeptember\n\nseptember (sap tam bahr)\n\nOctober\n\noktober (ohk too bahr)\n\nNovember\n\nnovember (noo vam baar)\n\nDecember\n\ndecember (dah sam baar)"
