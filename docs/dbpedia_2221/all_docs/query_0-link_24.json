        "text": "Rearing of Swedish, Norwegian, and Norwegian Sami children.\n\nPubMed\n\nLarsson, E; Ogaard, B; Lindsten, R\n\n1993-12-01\n\nA total of 362 3-yr-old Swedish, Norwegian, and Norwegian Sami (Lapp) children were examined, and their parents were asked about their children's present and previous sucking habits and how long they had been breast-fed and bottle-fed. They were also asked what the children's age was when porridge or purÃ©ed food or food with a soft chewing resistance was introduced, and when more ordinary foods such as well-diced meat and potatoes were introduced. The study revealed that breast-feeding has increased greatly both in prevalence and in duration in Sweden during the last decades. Despite this, Swedish children were breast-fed for a significantly shorter time than Norwegian children. The longest breast-feeding times were noted for Sami children. Swedish children were bottle-fed two to three times longer than Norwegian children. Sucking habits were correlated to breast-feeding only for Sami children.\n\nSuicidal expressions in young Swedish Sami, a cross-sectional study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOmma, Lotta; Sandlund, Mikael; Jacobsson, Lars\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjectives To investigate the experience of suicidal expressions (death wishes, life weariness, ideation, plans and attempts) in young Swedish Sami, their attitudes toward suicide (ATTS), and experience of suicidal expressions and completed suicide in significant others and to compare with Swedes in general. Methods A cross-sectional study comprising 516 Swedish Sami, 18â28 years of age together with an age and geographically matched reference group (n=218). Parts of the ATTS questionnaire have been used to cover different aspects of the suicidal complex. Data were analysed with regard to gender, occupation, counties and experience of negative societal treatment due to Sami background. Results Both young Sami and young Swedes reported suicidal ideation, life weariness, and death wishes in a high degree (30â50%), but it was more common among the Sami. Having had plans to commit suicide showed a significant gender difference only in the Sami. The prevalence of suicide attempts did not differ significantly between Sami and Swedes. Subgroups of the Sami reported a higher degree of suicidal behaviour, Sami women and reindeer herders reported a 3, 5-fold higher odds of suicide attempts and a 2-fold higher odds having had plans committing suicide. Sami living in Vasterbotten/Jamtland/Vasternorrland and Sami with experience of ethnicity related bad treatment 2-fold higher odds of suicidal plans compared to those living in other counties. Conclusion An increased occurrence of suicidal ideation/death wishes/life weariness in young Sami compared to young majority Swedes was found, but not an increased prevalence of suicide attempts and positive attitudes together with an increased awareness to handle suicide problems could be a contributing factor. Severe circumstances and experience of ethnicity-related bad treatment seems to contribute to increased levels of suicidal plans and attempts in subgroups of Sami. PMID:23346555\n\nA traditional Sami diet score as a determinant of mortality in a general northern Swedish population.\n\nPubMed\n\nNilsson, Lena Maria; Winkvist, Anna; Brustad, Magritt; Jansson, Jan-HÃ¥kan; Johansson, Ingegerd; Lenner, Per; Lindahl, Bernt; Van Guelpen, Bethany\n\n2012-05-04\n\nTo examine the relationship between \"traditional Sami\" dietary pattern and mortality in a general northern Swedish population. Population-based cohort study. We examined 77,319 subjects from the VÃ¤sterbotten Intervention Program (VIP) cohort. A traditional Sami diet score was constructed by adding 1 point for intake above the median level of red meat, fatty fish, total fat, berries and boiled coffee, and 1 point for intake below the median of vegetables, bread and fibre. Hazard ratios (HR) for mortality were calculated by Cox regression. Increasing traditional Sami diet scores were associated with slightly elevated all-cause mortality in men [Multivariate HR per 1-point increase in score 1.04 (95% CI 1.01-1.07), p=0.018], but not for women [Multivariate HR 1.03 (95% CI 0.99-1.07), p=0.130]. This increased risk was approximately equally attributable to cardiovascular disease and cancer, though somewhat more apparent for cardiovascular disease mortality in men free from diabetes, hypertension and obesity at baseline [Multivariate HR 1.10 (95% CI 1.01-1.20), p=0.023]. A weak increased all-cause mortality was observed in men with higher traditional Sami diet scores. However, due to the complexity in defining a \"traditional Sami\" diet, and the limitations of our questionnaire for this purpose, the study should be considered exploratory, a first attempt to relate a \"traditional Sami\" dietary pattern to health endpoints. Further investigation of cohorts with more detailed information on dietary and lifestyle items relevant for traditional Sami culture is warranted.\n\nLifestyle, Genetics, and Disease in Sami\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRoss, Alastair B.; Johansson, Ã sa; Ingman, Max; Gyllensten, Ulf\n\n2006-01-01\n\nAim To present a summary of the lifestyle, genetic origin, diet, and disease in the population of Sami, indigenous people of northern Fennoscandia. Method A survey of the available scientific literature and preliminary results from our own study of the Swedish Sami population. Results The Sami probably have a heterogeneous genetic origin, with a major contribution of continental or Eastern European tribes and a smaller contribution from Asia. The traditional Sami diet, high in animal products, persists in Sami groups still involved with reindeer herding, but others have adopted a diet typical of Western cultures. Early reports indicated a lower prevalence of heart disease and most cancers, except stomach cancer. Recent studies have not found a lower risk of heart disease, but have consistently shown an overall reduced cancer risk. Sami have been reported to share some specific health-related genetic polymorphisms with other European populations, but none that would explain the observed differences in disease risk. Conclusion The genetic structure of the Sami population makes it suitable for studies of the genetic and environmental factors influencing the development of common diseases. The difference in incidence of heart disease between studies may reflect the ongoing transition from a traditional to a more Westernized lifestyle. The ability to compare population segments with different lifestyles, combined with the genetic structure of the population, creates unusual possibilities for studies of the genetic and environmental factors involved in the development of common disease.

To explore the experiences and perceptions of climate change among Swedish reindeer herding Sami. In-depth interviews with 14 Swedish reindeer herding Sami were performed, with purposive sampling. The interviews focused on the herders experiences of climate change, observed consequences and thoughts about this. The interviews were analysed using content analysis. One core theme emerged from the interviews: facing the limit of resilience. Swedish reindeer-herding Sami perceive climate change as yet another stressor in their daily struggle. They have experienced severe and more rapidly shifting, unstable weather with associated changes in vegetation and alterations in the freeze-thaw cycle, all of which affect reindeer herding. The forecasts about climate change from authorities and scientists have contributed to stress and anxiety. Other societal developments have lead to decreased flexibility that obstructs adaptation. Some adaptive strategies are discordant with the traditional life of reindeer herding, and there is a fear among the Sami of being the last generation practising traditional reindeer herding. The study illustrates the vulnerable situation of the reindeer herders and that climate change impact may have serious consequences for the trade and their overall way of life. Decision makers on all levels, both in Sweden and internationally, need improved insights into these complex issues to be able to make adequate decisions about adaptive climate change strategies.\n\nFacing the limit of resilience: perceptions of climate change among reindeer herding Sami in Sweden\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFurberg, Maria; EvengÃ¥rd, Birgitta; Nilsson, Maria\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground The Arctic area is a part of the globe where the increase in global temperature has had the earliest noticeable effect and indigenous peoples, including the Swedish reindeer herding Sami, are amongst the first to be affected by these changes.

G.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe Standard Assembly-Line Manufacturing Industry Simulation (SAMIS) program was originally developed to model a hypothetical U. S. industry which manufactures silicon solar modules for use in electricity generation. The SAMIS program has now been generalized to the extent that it should be useful for simulating many different production-line manufacturing industries and companies. The most important capability of SAMIS is its ability to \"simulate\" an industry based on a model developed by the user with the aid of the SAMIS program. The results of the simulation are a set of financial reports which detail the requirements, including quantities and cost, of the companies and processes which comprise the industry. SAMIS provides a fair, consistent, and reliable means of comparing manufacturing processes being developed by numerous independent efforts. It can also be used to assess the industry-wide impact of changes in financial parameters, such as cost of resources and services, inflation rates, interest rates, tax policies, and required return on equity. Because of the large amount of data needed to describe an industry, a major portion of SAMIS is dedicated to data entry and maintenance. This activity in SAMIS is referred to as model management. Model management requires a significant amount of interaction through a system of \"prompts\" which make it possible for persons not familiar with computers, or the SAMIS program, to provide all of the data necessary to perform a simulation. SAMIS is written in TURBO PASCAL (version 2.0 required for compilation) and requires 10 meg of hard disk space, an 8087 coprocessor, and an IBM color graphics monitor. Executables and source code are provided. SAMIS was originally developed in 1978; the IBM PC version was developed in 1985. Release 6.1 was made available in 1986, and includes the PC-IPEG program.\n\nEthnic identity negotiation among Sami youth living in a majority Sami community in Norway\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNystad, Kristine; Spein, Anna Rita; Balto, Asta Mitkija; Ingstad, Benedicte\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Background: This study was part of the international research project âCircumpolar Indigenous Pathways to Adulthoodâ (CIPA). Objectives: To explore ethnic identity negotiation, an unexplored theme, among indigenous North Sami youth living in a majority Sami community context in Arctic Norway. Methods: A qualitative design was followed using open-ended, in-depth interviews conducted in 2010 with 22 Sami adolescents aged 13â19Â years, all reporting Sami self-identification. Grounded theory, narrative analysis, theories of ethnic identity and ecological perspectives on resilience were applied in order to identify the themes. Findings: All 22 youth reported being open about either their Sami background (86%) and/or ethnic pride (55%). Ethnic pride was reported more often among females (68%) than males (27%). However, a minority of youth (14%) with multi-ethnic parentage, poor Sami language skills, not having been born or raised in the community and with a lack of reindeer husbandry affiliation experienced exclusion by community members as not being affirmed as Sami, and therefore reported stressors like anger, resignation, rejection of their Sami origins and poor well-being. Sami language was most often considered as important for communication (73%), but was also associated with the perception of what it meant to be a Sami (32%) and âtraditionsâ (23%). Conclusion: Ethnic pride seemed to be strong among youth in this majority Sami context. Denial of recognition by oneâs own ethnic group did not negatively influence ethnic pride or openness about onesâ ethnic background, but was related to youth experience of intra-ethnic discrimination and poorer well-being. As Sami language was found to be a strong ethnic identity marker, effective language programmes for Norwegian-speaking Sami and newcomers should be provided. Language skills and competence would serve as an inclusive factor and improve studentsâ well-being and health.

There is, however, limited knowledge about how clinicians deal with this in clinical practice. This study explores how clinicians deal with language-appropriate care with Sami-speaking patients in specialist mental health services. This study aims to explore how clinicians identify and respond to Sami patients' language data, as well as how they experience provision of therapy to Sami-speaking patients in outpatient mental health clinics in Sami language administrative districts. Data were collected using qualitative method, through individual interviews with 20 therapists working in outpatient mental health clinics serving Sami populations in northern Norway. A thematic analysis inspired by systematic text reduction was employed. Two themes were identified: (a) identification of Sami patients' language data and (b) experiences with provision of therapy to Sami-speaking patients. Findings indicate that clinicians are not aware of patients' language needs prior to admission and that they deal with identification of language data and offer of language-appropriate care ad hoc when patients arrive. Sami-speaking participants reported always offering language choice and found more profound understanding of patients' experiences when Sami language was used. Whatever language Sami-speaking patients may choose, they are found to switch between languages during therapy. Most non-Sami-speaking participants reported offering Sami-speaking services, but the patients chose to speak Norwegian. However, a few of the participants maintained language awareness and could identify language needs despite a patient's refusal to speak Sami in therapy. Finally, some non-Sami-speaking participants were satisfied if they understood what the patients were saying. They left it to patients to address language problems, only to discover patients\n\nEmotional, physical and sexual violence among Sami and non-Sami populations in Norway: The SAMINOR 2 questionnaire study.\n\nPubMed\n\nEriksen, Astrid M A; Hansen, Ketil Lenert; Javo, Cecilie; Schei, Berit\n\n2015-08-01\n\nTo assess the prevalence and investigate ethnic differences of emotional, physical and sexual violence among a population of both Sami and non-Sami in Norway. Our study was based on the SAMINOR 2 study, a population-based survey on health and living conditions in multiethnic areas with both Sami and non-Sami populations in Central and Northern Norway. Our study includes a total of 11,296 participants: 2197 (19.4%) Sami respondents and 9099 (80.6 %) non-Sami respondents. Almost half of the Sami female respondents and one-third of the non-Sami female respondents reported any violence (any lifetime experience of violence). Sami women were more likely to report emotional, physical and sexual violence than non-Sami women. More than one-third of the Sami men compared with less than a quarter of non-Sami men reported having experienced any violence in their life. Sami men were more likely to report emotional and physical violence than non-Sami men. However, ethnicity was not significantly different regarding sexual violence experienced among men. Violence was typically reported to have occurred in childhood. Sami participants were more likely to report having experienced violence in the past 12 months. For all types of violence, the perpetrator was typically known to the victim. Regardless of gender, Sami respondents were more likely to report interpersonal violence. The prevalence of any violence was substantial in both ethnic groups and for both genders; it was highest among Sami women.

This article, the first to be drawn from our research, compares these changes between Sami and non-Sami, South and North Sami. Study design. Longitudinal individual based data from computerized records ofthe Glillivare, UndersÃ¥ker and Frostviken parishes, divided into 2 40-year periods: 1776-1815 and 1856-1895. The main source material used for the present study was a set of data files from the Demographic Data Base (DDB) at UmeÃ¥ University, the largest historical database in Europe. A Sami cohort was created by indicators of ethnicity in the parish registers, and was later extended with automatic linkages to children and parents. Sami mortality rates show great fluctuations during the period 1776-1815, almost always peaking at a higher rate than in the rest of Sweden. The non-Sami group had lower mortality rates compared with both Sweden as a whole and the Sami in the parish. Between 1856 and 1895, the non-Sami experienced a very small reduction in their mortality rates and the Sami experienced overall improvement in their health status. Significant differences in age-specific mortality appear when the South and North Sami are compared, showing that the South Sami had far lower child mortality rates. The Sami population's health status improved during the nineteenth century. This indicates that they had advanced in the epidemiologic transition model. A corresponding change is not found for the non-Sami group.\n\nEthnic difference in the prevalence of angina pectoris in Sami and non-Sami populations: the SAMINOR study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEliassen, Bent-Martin; Graff-Iversen, Sidsel; Melhus, Marita; LÃ¸chen, Maja-Lisa; Broderstad, Ann Ragnhild\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective To assess the population burden of angina pectoris symptoms (APS), self-reported angina and a combination of these, and explore potential ethnic disparity in their patterns. If differences in APS were found between Sami and non-Sami populations, we aimed at evaluating the role of established cardiovascular risk factors as mediating factors. Design Cross-sectional population-based study. Methods A health survey was conducted in 2003â2004 in areas with Sami and non-Sami populations (SAMINOR). The response rate was 60.9%. The total number for the subsequent analysis was 15,206 men and women aged 36â79 years (born 1925â1968). Information concerning lifestyle was collected by 2 self-administrated questionnaires, and clinical examinations provided data on waist circumference, blood pressure and lipid levels. Results This study revealed an excess of APS, self-reported angina and a combination of these in Sami relative to non-Sami women and men. After controlling for age, the odds ratio (OR) for APS was 1.42 (p<0.001) in Sami women and 1.62 (p<0.001) for men. When including relevant biomarkers and conventional risk factors, little change was observed. When also controlling for moderate alcohol consumption and leisure-time physical activity, the OR in women was reduced to 1.24 (p=0.06). Little change was observed in men. Conclusion This study revealed an excess of APS, self-reported angina and a combination of these in Sami women and men relative to non-Sami women and men. Established risk factors explained little or none of the ethnic variation in APS. In women, however, less moderate alcohol consumption and leisure-time physical activity in Sami may explain the entire ethnic difference. PMID:24422205\n\nThe influence of religious factors on drinking behavior among young indigenous Sami and non-Sami peers in northern Norway.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpein, Anna Rita; Melhus, Marita; Kristiansen, Roald E; Kvernmo, Siv E\n\n2011-12-01\n\nIt has been hypothesized that Laestadianism has contributed to the less drinking observed among indigenous Sami. This paper further investigates the bivariate protective influence of Sami ethnicity on youth drinking behavior using logistic regressions. We simultaneously controlled for the influence of religious revival movements (Laestadianism or evangelic) and religious importance (being personally Christian), in addition to socio-demographics and parental factors. Cross-sectional data from the 1994/95 North Norwegian Youth Study including 2,950 (675 Sami) 15-19Â year-old high school students (RR: 85%) was used. Sami ethnicity was statistically significant for two out of six alcohol outcome measures, after adjustment for religiosity and other covariates, indicating less current drinking and party drinking. Religiousness was associated with higher youth and parental abstinence across ethnicities. Generally, stronger protective influences on drinking behavior were found for religious importance (being personally Christian) than religious affiliation (Laestadianism). The non-significance between Sami and non-Sami drinking may partly be explained by ethnic differences in religiosity, but also socio-demographics (e.g., residing in the Sami Highland) and parental factors (e.g., abstinence) contributed to such a result. Laestadianism`s profound impact on Sami culture, and its strong anti-alcohol norms may have contributed to a religious-socio-cultural context of abstinence.\n\nThe confidence in health care and social services in northern Sweden--a comparison between reindeer-herding Sami and the non-Sami majority population.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaerga, Laila; SjÃ¶lander, Per; Jacobsson, Lars; Edin-Liljegren, Anette\n\n2012-08-01\n\nTo investigate the confidence in primary health care, psychiatry and social services among the reindeer-herding Sami and the non-Sami population of northern Sweden. A semi-randomized, cross-sectional study design comprising 325 reindeer-herding Sami (171 men, 154 women) and a control population of 1,437 non-Sami (684 men, 753 women). A questionnaire on the confidence in primary health care, psychiatry, social services, and work colleagues was distributed to members of reindeer-herding families through the Sami communities and to the control population through the post. The relative risk for poor confidence was analyzed by calculating odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals adjusted for age and level of education. The confidence in primary health care and psychiatry was significantly lower among the reindeer-herding Sami compared with the control group. No differences were found between men and women in the reindeer-herding Sami population. In both the reindeer-herding Sami and the control population, younger people (â¤ 48 years) reported significantly lower confidence in primary health care than older individuals (>48 years). A conceivable reason for the poor confidence in health care organizations reported by the reindeer-herding Sami is that they experience health care staff as poorly informed about reindeer husbandry and Sami culture, resulting in unsuitable or unrealistic treatment suggestions. The findings suggest that the poor confidence constitutes a significant obstacle of the reindeer-herding Sami to fully benefit from public health care services.\n\nPrevalence of self-reported stomach symptoms after consuming milk among indigenous Sami and non-Sami in Northern- and Mid-Norway - the SAMINOR study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHansen, Ketil Lenert; Brustad, Magritt; Johnsen, Knut\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe main purpose of this work was to identify the prevalence of self-reported stomach symptoms after consuming milk among Sami and non-Sami adults. A cross-sectional population-based study (the SAMINOR study). Data were collected by self-administrated questionnaires. SAMINOR is a population-based study of health and living conditions conducted in 24 municipalities in Northern Norway during 2003 and 2004. The present study included 15,546 individuals aged between 36 and 79, whose ethnicity was categorized as Sami (33.4%), Kven (7.3%) and Norwegian majority population (57.2%). Sami respondents had a higher prevalence of self-reported stomach symptoms after consuming milk than the Norwegian majority population. The reporting was highest among Sami females (27.1%). Consumption of milk and dairy products (yoghurt and cheese) was high among all the ethnic groups. However, significantly more Sami than non-Sami never (or rarely) consume milk or cheese, and individuals who reported stomach symptoms after consuming milk had an significant lower intake of dairy products than those not reporting stomach symptoms after consuming dairy products. Sami reported general abdominal pain more often than the majority population. The adjusted models show a significant effect of Sami ethnicity in both men and women on self-reported stomach symptoms after consuming milk. In females, the odds ratio (OR)=1.77 (p=0.001) and in males OR=1.64 (p=0.001). Our study shows that the Sami population reported more stomach symptoms after consuming milk, suggesting a higher prevalence of milk intolerance among the Sami population than the Norwegian majority population.\n\nImperatives for \"Right\" Educational Choices in Swedish Educational Policy\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPuaca, Goran\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe present article is based on a critical semiotic investigation of the Swedish Long-Term Survey on economic development. It aims to examine how recent Swedish policy trends bring specific economic, political and social processes together to form a system of meaning for both motivation and regulation over individuals' educational choices.

E.; Beck, J.; Spalding, R.; Dickson, A. G.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nSpectrophotometric methods are routinely used to make high-precision pH measurements in oceanographic studies. The SAMI-pH sensor incorporates this technique into an autonomous, in situ sensor capable of extended deployments with minimal instrument drift. The SAMI-pH operates by mixing seawater with an indicator dye (metacresol purple) and measuring pH by absorbance. Laboratory studies have found that the SAMI-pH has an accuracy of 0.0017 Â± 0.0007 pH units. Additionally, two SAMIs deployed for 22 days in coastal waters had a mean difference of +0.0042, and there was no drift evident during the deployment. The SAMI-pH has recently been re-designed with funding from the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The new SAMI-pH design replaces the tungsten lamp with LEDs, decreasing power consumption. The SAMI-pH can now make more than 2,300 measurements in a single deployment, i.e. run for 290 days sampling every 3 hours. The design is also much more compact, allowing for easier deployment. Additionally, the SAMI-pH can now be deployed with a certified reference material (CRM), allowing for in situ data verification. The CRM, produced by Dr. Andrew Dickson (Scripps), is a tris seawater buffer that has a pH that is accurately known over the range of seawater temperatures. The new SAMI-pH has been tested extensively in the lab, with consistent high accuracy and precision. Field based studies have also yielded very good results. The SAMI-pH was deployed for three months at the MBARI M0 mooring. Data collected were used with salinity derived alkalinity to calculate in situ pCO2, which initially had a mean difference of 2.0 Â± 0.4 Î¼atm, as compared to an infrared CO2 sensor mounted on the buoy. During this time aragonite saturation states varied from 1.8-3.7, and calcite saturation states varied from 2.9-5.8. Data collected by a SAMI-pH and SAMI-CO2 on the NH-10 mooring off the Oregon Coast gave similar results. The SAMI-pH was deployed on a drifter for 1 month in the\n\nChildhood violence and adult chronic pain among indigenous Sami and non-Sami populations in Norway: a SAMINOR 2 questionnaire study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEriksen, Astrid M. A.; Schei, Berit; Hansen, Ketil Lenert; SÃ¸rlie, Tore; Fleten, Nils; Javo, Cecilie\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Internationally, studies have shown that childhood violence is associated with chronic pain in adulthood. However, to date, this relationship has not been examined in any indigenous population. Objective The main objectives of this study were to investigate the association between childhood violence and reported chronic pain, number of pain sites and the intensity of pain in adulthood in indigenous Sami and non-Sami adults, and to explore ethnic differences. Design The study is based on the SAMINOR 2 questionnaire study, a larger population-based, cross-sectional survey on health and living conditions in multiethnic areas with both Sami and non-Sami populations in Mid- and Northern Norway. Our study includes a total of 11,130 adult participants: 2,167 Sami respondents (19.5%) and 8,963 non-Sami respondents (80.5%). Chronic pain was estimated by reported pain located in various parts of the body. Childhood violence was measured by reported exposure of emotional, physical and/or sexual violence. Results Childhood violence was associated with adult chronic pain in several pain sites of the body regardless of ethnicity and gender. Childhood violence was also associated with increased number of chronic pain sites and higher pain intensity compared to those not exposed to childhood violence. However, among Sami men, this association was only significant for pain located in chest, hips/legs and back, and non-significant for increased number of chronic pain sites (adjusted model), and higher pain intensity. Conclusion Respondents exposed to childhood violence reported more chronic pain in several parts of the body, increased number of chronic pain sites and more intense pain in adulthood than respondents reporting no childhood violence. However, among Sami men, this association was weaker and also not significant for increased number of chronic pain sites and higher pain intensity.

D.; Joyce, G.\n\n2001-05-01\n\nIn the past decade, the Open Source Model for software development has gained popularity and has had numerous major achievements: emacs, Linux, the Gimp, and Python, to name a few. The basic idea is to provide the source code of the model or application, a tutorial on its use, and a feedback mechanism with the community so that the model can be tested, improved, and archived. Given the success of the Open Source Model, we believe it may prove valuable in the development of scientific research codes. With this in mind, we are `Open Sourcing' the low to mid-latitude ionospheric model that has recently been developed at the Naval Research Laboratory: SAMI2 (Sami2 is Another Model of the Ionosphere). The model is comprehensive and uses modern numerical techniques. The structure and design of SAMI2 make it relatively easy to understand and modify: the numerical algorithms are simple and direct, and the code is reasonably well-written. Furthermore, SAMI2 is designed to run on personal computers; prohibitive computational resources are not necessary, thereby making the model accessible and usable by virtually all researchers. For these reasons, SAMI2 is an excellent candidate to explore and test the open source modeling paradigm in space physics research. We will discuss various topics associated with this project.

There is, however, limited knowledge about how clinicians deal with this in clinical practice. This study explores how clinicians deal with language-appropriate care with Sami-speaking patients in specialist mental health services. Objectives This study aims to explore how clinicians identify and respond to Sami patientsâ language data, as well as how they experience provision of therapy to Sami-speaking patients in outpatient mental health clinics in Sami language administrative districts. Method Data were collected using qualitative method, through individual interviews with 20 therapists working in outpatient mental health clinics serving Sami populations in northern Norway. A thematic analysis inspired by systematic text reduction was employed. Findings Two themes were identified: (a) identification of Sami patientsâ language data and (b) experiences with provision of therapy to Sami-speaking patients. Conclusion Findings indicate that clinicians are not aware of patientsâ language needs prior to admission and that they deal with identification of language data and offer of language-appropriate care ad hoc when patients arrive. Sami-speaking participants reported always offering language choice and found more profound understanding of patientsâ experiences when Sami language was used. Whatever language Sami-speaking patients may choose, they are found to switch between languages during therapy. Most non-Sami-speaking participants reported offering Sami-speaking services, but the patients chose to speak Norwegian. However, a few of the participants maintained language awareness and could identify language needs despite a patient's refusal to speak Sami in therapy. Finally, some non-Sami-speaking participants were satisfied if they understood what the patients were saying. They left it to patients\n\nThe Sami School System in Norway and International Cooperation.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTodal, Jon\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIn Norway, a separate curriculum for primary and lower secondary schools has been introduced in indigenous Sami areas, and some jurisdiction over the school system has been transferred to the Sami Parliament.

Interviews from nine older Sami women and four middle-aged Roma women were analyzed using grounded theory with the following categories identified: contributing to well-being (with the subcategories belonging to a healthy family, being spiritual, cultural norms as health promoting, and having had a life of one's own); and contributing to lack of well-being (with the subcategories living subordinate to the dominant society, living in a hierarchical family, and living in the shadow of tuberculosis.).\n\nStructural patterns in Swedish health policy: a 30-year perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaltman, Richard B\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThis perspective reviews key institutional and organizational patterns in Swedish health care over the last 30 years, probing the roots of several complicated policy questions that concern present-day Swedish decision-makers. It explores in particular the ongoing structural tension between stability, on the one hand, and the necessary levels of innovation and dynamism demanded by the current period of major clinical, technological, economic, social and supranational (EU) change. Where useful, the article compares Swedish developments with those in the other three European Nordic countries as well as other northern European health systems. Sweden's health sector evolution can provide valuable insight for other countries into the complexity involved in re-thinking tradeoffs between policies that emphasize stability as against those that encourage innovation in health sector governance and provision.\n\nDepression and anxiety in the reindeer-herding Sami population of Sweden.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaiser, Niclas; SjÃ¶lander, Per; Liljegren, Annette Edin; Jacobsson, Lars; Renberg, Ellinor Salander\n\n2010-09-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate symptoms and predicting factors of depression and anxiety among reindeer-herding Sami in Sweden. A total of 319 reindeer-herding Sami (168 men, 151 women) were compared with urban and rural reference populations comprising 1,393 persons (662 men, 731 women). A cross-sectional questionnaire study on mental health, which included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data were analysed with regard to population, gender, age group, education and work-related stress. The Sami population disclosed higher mean values for both depression and anxiety than the reference groups, with Sami men reporting the highest rates. Work-related stress was associated with anxiety and depression in the Sami group. By comparing Sami men and women with reference groups of men and women living in urban and rural areas in northern Sweden, this study identified that reindeer-herding Sami men require special attention with regard to mental health problems.\n\nSAMI: Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph pipeline\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAllen, J.

J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe present the Early Data Release of the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey. The SAMI Galaxy Survey is an ongoing integral field spectroscopic survey of Ë3400 low-redshift (z < 0.12) galaxies, covering galaxies in the field and in groups within the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey regions, and a sample of galaxies in clusters. In the Early Data Release, we publicly release the fully calibrated data cubes for a representative selection of 107 galaxies drawn from the GAMA regions, along with information about these galaxies from the GAMA catalogues. All data cubes for the Early Data Release galaxies can be downloaded individually or as a set from the SAMI Galaxy Survey website. In this paper we also assess the quality of the pipeline used to reduce the SAMI data, giving metrics that quantify its performance at all stages in processing the raw data into calibrated data cubes. The pipeline gives excellent results throughout, with typical sky subtraction residuals in the continuum of 0.9-1.2 per cent, a relative flux calibration uncertainty of 4.1 per cent (systematic) plus 4.3 per cent (statistical), and atmospheric dispersion removed with an accuracy of 0.09 arcsec, less than a fifth of a spaxel.\n\nSensibility: A New Focus in Sami Health Care Education\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNymo, Randi\n\n2007-01-01\n\nColonialism has had significant bodily impacts on Indigenous peoples through medicine.

The main study was designed to examine and understand the everyday life, transitions between life stages and democratic participation of Norwegian Sami people experiencing disability. Hence, the purpose of this article is to increase the understanding of possible ethical and methodological issues in research within this field. The article describes and discusses ethical and methodological issues that arose when conducting our study and identifies some strategies for addressing issues like these. The ethical and methodological issues addressed in the article are based on a qualitative study among indigenous Norwegian Sami people experiencing disability. The data in this study were collected through 31 semi-structured in-depth interviews with altogether 24 Sami people experiencing disability and 13 next of kin of Sami people experiencing disability (8 mothers, 2 fathers, 2 sister and 1 guardian). The researchers identified 4 main areas of ethical and methodological issues. We present these issues chronologically as they emerged in the research process: 1) concept of knowledge when designing the study, 2) gaining access, 3) data collection and 4) analysis and accountability. The knowledge generated from this study has the potential to benefit future health research, specifically of Norwegian Sami people experiencing disability, as well as health research concerning indigenous people in general, providing scientific-based insight into important ethical and methodological issues in research with indigenous people experiencing disability.\n\nConcurrent adversities and suicide attempts among Sami and non-Sami adolescents: the Norwegian Arctic Adolescent Study (NAAHS).\n\nPubMed\n\nReigstad, BjÃ¸rn; Kvernmo, Siv\n\n2017-08-01\n\nLittle is known about connections between adolescent suicide attempts (SA) and concurrent adversities. In a cross-sectional study, the authors wanted to investigate prevalences, additive effects of adversities, family and peer relations, gender, divorce and poverty, and ethnic differences between Sami and non-Sami youth. In an adolescent community population encompassing 4881 adolescents of 15-16 years of age, youth with and without self-reports of attempted suicide the last year were compared on 12 concurrent adversities, on scales assessing family and peer functioning, and on sociodemographic variables. The prevalence of attempted suicide the last year was 5.3%, and more girls (8.8%) than boys (1.8%). All 12 concurrent adversities were strongly related to SA. The suicide attempters reported two and a half times as many adversities as non-attempters. A strong multiple additive relationship was found. Multivariately, among boys, the strongest risk factors were suicide among friends (ORâ=â9.4), and suicide in the family or in the neighbourhood (ORâ=â4.8). Among girls, sexual abuse (ORâ=â5.2) and parent mental problems (ORâ=â4.6) were strongest related to SA. Suicide attempters reported more divorce and poverty, more conflicts with parents, and less family support and involvement. Totally, Sami youth reported more SA and more concurrent adversities than non-Sami peers. Adolescent suicide attempters are heavily burdened with concurrent adversities. Clinicians should be aware of gender differences in risk factors, and should ask about abuse and suicide or attempts among relatives and peers. A family perspective in clinical work is needed.\n\nMammographic screening in Sami speaking municipalities and a control group. Are early outcome measures influenced by ethnicity?\n\nPubMed\n\nNorum, Jan; Hofvind, Solveig; Nieder, Carsten; Schnell, Edrun Andrea; Broderstad, Ann Ragnhild\n\n2012-04-16\n\nFemale citizens of Sami (the indigenous people of Norway) municipalities in northern Norway have a low risk of breast cancer. The objective of this study was to describe the attendance rate and outcome of the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) in the Sami-speaking municipalities and a control group. A retrospective registry-based study. The 8 municipalities included in the administration area of the Sami language law (Sami) were matched with a control group of 11 municipalities (non-Sami). Population data were accessed from Statistics Norway. Data regarding invitations and outcome in the NBCSP during the period 2001-2010 was derived from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). The NBCSP targets women aged 50-69 years. Rates and percentages were compared using chi-square test with a p-value<0.05 as statistical significant. The attendance rate in the NBCSP was 78% in the Sami and 75% in the non-Sami population (p< 0.01). The recall rates were 2.4 and 3.3% in the Sami and non-Sami population, respectively (p<0.01). The rate of invasive screen detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group (p=0.14). The percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP among the Sami (67%) was lower compared with the non-Sami population (86%, p=0.06). Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.\n\nHealth service use in indigenous Sami and non-indigenous youth in North Norway: A population based survey\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTuri, Anne Lene; Bals, Margrethe; Skre, Ingunn B; Kvernmo, Siv\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground This is the first population based study exploring health service use and ethno-cultural factors in indigenous Sami and non-Sami youth in North Norway. The first aim of the present study was to compare the frequency of health service use between Sami adolescents and their non-indigenous peers. The second aim was to explore the relationships between health service use and ethno-cultural factors, such as ethnic context, Sami self-identification, perceived discrimination and Sami language competence. Finally, we wanted to explore the relationship between use of health services and emotional and behavioural problems. Method The Norwegian Arctic Adolescent Health Study was conducted among 10th graders (15-16 years old) in junior high schools in North Norway. The sample consisted of 4,449 adolescents, of whom 450 (10.1%) were indigenous Sami and 3,999 (89.9%) were non-Sami. Results Sami and non-Sami youth used all health services with equal frequency. However, several ethno-cultural factors were found to influence health service use. Sami youth in more assimilated ethnic contexts used general practitioners more than non-Sami youth. Youth with Sami self-identification had a higher probability of using the school health service compared with other youth. Ethnic barriers to health service use were also identified. Sami speaking youth with a high degree of perceived discrimination had lower probability of using school health services than non-Sami speaking youth. Sami youth with conduct problems were less likely than non-Sami to use psychologist/psychiatrist. The present study demonstrated a relationship between health need and actual health service use. Conclusion Culture-specific factors influenced the help-seeking process in indigenous youth; some factors acted as barriers against health service use and other factors increased the probability of health service use.

It can image cut-off surfaces corresponding to frequencies in the range 10-34.5GHz; these surfaces are typically in the plasma edge. SAMI operates in two modes: either imaging thermal emission from the plasma (often modified by its interaction with the plasma edge e.g. via BXO mode conversion) or ``active probing'' i.e. injecting a broad beam at the plasma surface and imaging the reflected/back-scattered signal. SAMI was successfully pioneered on the Mega-Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. SAMI has now been installed and commissioned on the National Spherical Torus Experiment Upgrade (NSTX-U) at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The firmware has been upgraded to include real-time digital filtering, which enables continuous acquisition of the Doppler back-scattered active probing data. In this poster we shall present SAMI's analysis of the plasma edge on NSTX-U including measurements of the edge pitch angle on NSTX-U using SAMI's unique 2-D Doppler-backscattering capability.\n\nEthical and methodological issues in research with Sami experiencing disability.\n\nPubMed\n\nMelbÃ¸e, Line; Hansen, Ketil Lenert; Johnsen, BjÃ¸rn-Eirik; Fedreheim, Gunn Elin; Dinesen, Tone; Minde, Gunn-Tove; Rustad, Marit\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground A study of disability among the indigenous Sami people in Norway presented a number of ethical and methodological challenges rarely addressed in the literature.

A cohort of 19 801 people of Sami origin was followed for cancer incidence over the period 1970-1997 by the Norwegian Cancer Registry. Among the Sami 1340 cases of cancer were observed versus 1658.2 expected, based on a regional reference population. For both sexes a significantly decreased incidence of colon cancer was observed. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for men was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.71) and for women 0.62 (95% CI 0.43-0.85). Low SIRs were observed for lung cancer: 0.63 (95% CI 0.51-0.77) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.37-0.91), for men and women, respectively. Men of Sami ancestry had a decreased risk of prostate cancer: SIR 0.57 (95% CI 0.45-0.71). Among women 127 cases of breast cancer were observed versus 149.6 expected. A relatively high physical activity and a diet rich in fish may in part explain the low cancer incidence. Some Sami were exposed to radioactivity as a result of their diet based on reindeer products. Adverse effects on their cancer incidence were not observed.\n\nSami Education in Finland\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKeskitalo, Pigga; Maatta, Kaarina; Uusiautti, Satu\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this article is, first, to describe Sami children's education and its status in the Finnish education system and, secondly, to contemplate its development in Finland.

Design Cross-sectional data were collected from âWell-being among Youth in Greenlandâ (WBYG) and âThe Norwegian Arctic Adolescent Health Studyâ (NAAHS), conducted during 2003â2005 and comprising 10th and 11th graders, 378 Inuit and 350 Sami. Methods SRH was assessed by one single item, using a 4-point and 5-point scale for NAAHS and WBYG, respectively. Logistic regressions were performed separately for each indigenous group using a dichotomous measure with âvery goodâ (NAAHS) and âvery good/goodâ (WBYG) as reference categories. We simultaneously controlled for various socio-demographics, risk correlates (drinking, smoking, violence and suicidal behaviour) and protective correlates (physical activity, well-being in school, number of close friends and adolescentâparent relationship). Results A majority of both Inuit (62%) and Sami (89%) youth reported âgoodâ or âvery goodâ SRH. The proportion of âpoor/fair/not so goodâ SRH was three times higher among Inuit than Sami (38% vs. 11%, pâ¤0.001). Significantly more Inuit females than males reported âpoor/fairâ SRH (44% vs. 29%, pâ¤0.05), while no gender differences occurred among Sami (12% vs. 9%, pâ¤0.08). In both indigenous groups, suicidal thoughts (risk) and physical activity (protective) were associated with poor and good SRH, respectively. Conclusions In accordance with other studies of indigenous adolescents, suicidal thoughts were strongly associated with poorer SRH among Sami and Inuit. The InuitâSami differences in SRH could partly be due to higher âriskâ and lower âprotectiveâ correlates among Inuit than Sami. The positive impact of physical activity on SRH needs to be targeted in future intervention programs.

ANCOVA results showed that parental permissiveness was higher in the Sami group. Moreover, the effect of ethnicity was different for boys and girls (mothers' reports). Co-sleeping and self-regulation of food and sleep were commonly practiced in the Sami, but not in the Norwegian families. Sami children were more socially independent than their Norwegian peers. Indirect or internal types of control were used more by Sami parents, and they were less tolerant of child aggression, in the form of temper tantrums and displays of jealousy. These patterns are similar to those found in other indigenous cultures in the circumpolar region. The results are discussed with reference to the Individualism-Collectivism dimension. The study challenges the Individualism-Collectivism construct for apparently confounding the individualism common in European liberalism with the individual autonomy commonly encountered among hunting-gathering peoples.\n\nSafety Management Information Statistics (SAMIS) - 1993 Annual Report\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n1995-05-01\n\nThe 1993 Safety Management Information Statistics (SAMIS) report, now in its fourth year of publication, is a compilation and analysis of transit accident and casualty statistics uniformly collected from approximately 400 transit agencies throughout ...\n\nThe international biological program/human adaptability studies among the Skolt Sami in Finland (1966-1970).\n\nPubMed\n\nForsius, Henrik; Eriksson, Aldur W; Fellman, Johan\n\n2012-04-16\n\nThe population is increasingly lighter pigmented moving in a northward direction in Europe until reaching the Arctic Circle, where the Samis (Lapps) are clearly more pigmented.

A comparison between Swedish and Norwegian-Sami children.\n\nPubMed\n\nLarsson, E\n\n1998-01-01\n\n1-18 months old Norwegian-Sami girls from Karasjok/Katokeino were compared with girls from FalkÃ¶ping in Sweden. All Karasjok/Kautokeino children were breastfed, usually until 1 year of age. Only a few developed a dummy- or fingersucking habit. They started eating porridge at 4-5 months of age. At about half a year of age they were fed dark, hard chewing bread to gnaw at. Cut and pulped adult food was introduced during the end of the first year of life. In almost all cases the children had dried reindeer meat to gnaw at. They were mostly fed by spoon and drank from a cup. The FalkÃ¶ping girls, on the other hand, were not so often breastfed and for a shorter time. They usually became dummysuckers. The FalkÃ¶ping girls got almost all their nutrition during the first one or two years by sucking or eating food with little chewing resistance. The differences in sucking and chewing behavior could influence on the transversal development of the jaws.\n\nDiscursive Mechanisms and Human Agency in Language Policy Formation: Negotiating Bilingualism and Parallel Language Use at a Swedish University\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKÃ¤llkvist, Marie; Hult, Francis M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn the wake of the enactment of Sweden's Language Act in 2009 and in the face of the growing presence of English, Swedish universities have been called upon by the Swedish Higher Education Authority to craft their own language policy documents.

Distinct from other European populations in culture and language, they are generally deemed to be remote from the Caucasian lineage. In order to ascertain whether the Sami are genetically linked to Asiatic Mongoloids, we investigated serological markers of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. Particle agglutination tests for serum HTLV-I antibody were performed for 400 Sami living in Finnmark, the northernmost county of Norway, and in 380 Caucasians (or Norse) in the same region, using serum samples collected for the purpose of studying cardiovascular disease among Northland people in 1974-75. One sample from a Sami showed a tentatively positive reaction, and 4 sera from Sami and 4 from Norse individuals exhibited non-specific agglutination. However, none of the 9 sera showed a positive result in western blotting for HTLV-I proteins, namely, gp46, p53, p24, and p19. Since HTLV-I is distributed most prevalently among northern and southwestern Japanese in Asia and Andeans in South America, the absence of HTLV-I in the Sami might suggest their genetic remoteness from these ethnic groups.\n\nSafety Management Information Statistics (SAMIS) - 1992 Annual Report\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n1994-06-01\n\nThis SAMIS 1992 annual report, now in its third year of publication, is a compilation and analysis of mass transit accident and casualty statistics reported by 600 transit systems in the United States under the FTA Section 15 reporting system.

There is evidence that variability in riboswitch properties allows tuning of expression for genes involved in different stages of biosynthetic pathways by mechanisms that are not currently understood. Here, we explore the mechanism for tuning of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-I riboswitch folding. Most SAM-I riboswitches function at the transcriptional level by sensing the cognate ligand SAM. SAM-I riboswitches orchestrate the biosynthetic pathways of cysteine, methionine, SAM, and so forth. We use base-pair probability predictions to examine the secondary-structure folding landscape of several SAM-I riboswitch sequences. We predict different folding behaviors for different SAM-I riboswitch sequences. We identify several \"decoy\" base-pairing interactions involving 5' riboswitch residues that can compete with the formation of a P1 helix, a component of the ligand-bound \"transcription OFF\" state, in the absence of SAM. We hypothesize that blockage of these interactions through SAM contacts contributes to stabilization of the OFF state in the presence of ligand. We also probe folding patterns for a SAM-I riboswitch RNA using constructs with different 3' truncation points experimentally. Folding was monitored through fluorescence, susceptibility to base-catalyzed cleavage, nuclear magnetic resonance, and indirectly through SAM binding. We identify key decision windows at which SAM can affect the folding pathway towards the OFF state. The presence of decoy conformations and differential sensitivities to SAM at different transcript lengths is crucial for SAM-I riboswitches to modulate gene expression in the context of global cellular metabolism.

We present the throughput of the SAMI system, the science basis and specifications for the target selection, the survey observation plan and the combined properties of the selected galaxies. The survey includes four volume-limited galaxy samples based on cuts in a proxy for stellar mass, along with low-stellar-mass dwarf galaxies all selected from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. The GAMA regions were selected because of the vast array of ancillary data available, including ultraviolet through to radio bands. These fields are on the celestial equator at 9, 12 and 14.5 h, and cover a total of 144 deg2 (in GAMA-I). Higher density environments are also included with the addition of eight clusters. The clusters have spectroscopy from 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and photometry in regions covered by the SDSS and/or VLT Survey Telescope/ATLAS. The aim is to cover a broad range in stellar mass and environment, and therefore the primary survey targets cover redshifts 0.004 < z < 0.095, magnitudes rpet < 19.4, stellar masses 107-1012 Mâ, and environments from isolated field galaxies through groups to clusters of Ë1015 Mâ.\n\nThe SAMI Galaxy Survey: cubism and covariance, putting round pegs into square holes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSharp, R.; Allen, J.

We demonstrate the subcritical sampling of the seeing and incomplete fill factor for the integral field bundles results in only a 10 per cent degradation in the final image resolution recovered. We also implement a new methodology for tracking covariance between elements of the resulting data cubes which retains 90 per cent of the covariance information while incurring only a modest increase in the survey data volume.\n\nGlobal Flows in Local Language Planning: Articulating Parallel Language Use in Swedish University Policies\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHult, Francis M.; KÃ¤llkvist, Marie\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn this paper, the language policies of three Swedish universities are examined as instances of language planning in local contexts. Although Sweden has the national Language Act of 2009 (SFS 2009:600) as well as a general Higher Education Ordinance (SFS 1993:100; SFS 2014:1096), language planning for higher education is left to the purview ofâ¦\n\nTransit safety & security statistics & analysis 2003 annual report (formerly SAMIS)\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThe Transit Safety & Security Statistics & Analysis 2003 Annual Report (formerly SAMIS) is a compilation and analysis of mass transit accident, casualty, and crime statistics reported under the Federal Transit Administrations (FTAs) National Tr...\n\nTransit safety & security statistics & analysis 2002 annual report (formerly SAMIS)\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2004-12-01\n\nThe Transit Safety & Security Statistics & Analysis 2002 Annual Report (formerly SAMIS) is a compilation and analysis of mass transit accident, casualty, and crime statistics reported under the Federal Transit Administrations (FTAs) National Tr...\n\nEnvironmental Management at Swedish Universities\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nArvidsson, Karin\n\n2004-01-01\n\nSince 1996, all Swedish public authorities, which includes most universities, have been made responsibl"
