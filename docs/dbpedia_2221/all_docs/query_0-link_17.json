        "text": "2.1 A Varied Landscape…\n\nSweden is a small country of just over 10 million inhabitants. For at least 15 years, around 400,000 students annually have studied at Sweden’s 48 higher education institutions.Footnote 20 For a student aspiring to enter the teaching profession, 25 Swedish higher education institutions offered 431 programme options in the fall semester of 2021.Footnote 21 Between 10,000 and 14,000 students annually navigate these options and apply to become educated for teaching through these programmes.Footnote 22\n\nTeachers in Sweden are educated within the framework of regular higher education, which means that most Swedish universities and university colleges provide one or more teacher education programmes. Two important consequences follow from this fact: first, no educational institutions focus exclusively on educating teachers; second, teacher education in Sweden is delivered in educational institutions with varied profiles. Some teacher programmes are offered in highly specialized educational institutions, but that specialization is on areas other than teaching, for example technically or artistically oriented institutions, while other teacher programmes are provided in general educational institutions like comprehensive universities and university colleges. Some programmes are offered in institutions with more than 40,000 students, and others in institutions with fewer than a thousand students. As these institutions differ so significantly in size, focus and tradition, they likely also differ in academic capacity. As a consequence of this varied landscape, Swedish teacher education programmes have different contexts and conditions; for example, not all teacher programmes are delivered in institutions with the right to provide postgraduate education.Footnote 23\n\nAgainst this varied background, there is reason to question whether it is even possible to speak of a Swedish model of teacher education. However, this chapter aims to describe both the commonalities and differences in how teachers are educated in Sweden and the challenges these efforts face.\n\n2.2 … but a Common Educational Structure\n\nThe way teachers have been educated in Sweden has varied greatly over time. Since 2011, teachers have been prepared for Swedish schools at all levels in one of four different programmes, each with its own degree:\n\npreschool teacher degree,\n\nprimary teacher’s degree (with three different orientations: teaching in preschool class and grades 1–3, in grades 4–6 and in leisure time centres),Footnote 24\n\nsubject teacher’s degree (with a specialization in teaching in either grades 7–9 or upper secondary school) andFootnote 25\n\na vocational teacher’s degree.Footnote 26\n\n2.2.1 The Legacy: Old Models Influences Novelties\n\nEvery model of teacher preparation is inevitably shaped by both older traditions and ideas and ambitions about the future, and Sweden’s current model is no exception. The introduction of the comprehensive school model (grades 1–9) in 1962 was not accompanied by any teacher education reforms designed for that novel school model. Indeed, reform arrived only in 1988, with the implementation of a teacher education model that was better suited to the structure of the comprehensive school and aligned with a school system that was less divided.\n\nSeparate programmes for teaching in primary level and middle level schools was abandoned in the reform of 1988. Teacher education for compulsory school became divided into two programs, one for teaching younger children (grades 1–7) and the other for teaching older children (grades 4–9). When the school system was reformed from 6 years of mandatory studies into a 9-year comprehensive school model by parliamentary decisions in 1950 and 1962, as noted above, no new teacher education model for the “new” lower secondary grades (7–9) was launched. That lack was partly solved with the 1988 reform but was based on the primary teacher education tradition rather than the subject-specific teacher education tradition used in upper secondary; nor did it include a constructive combination of the two approaches. Whether it would have been more appropriate to prepare teachers for these grades based on the secondary education tradition is a matter of debate, but such a model was indeed introduced much later, in 2011. Before then, students qualified for teaching grades 7–9 by not fulfilling required periods of study for upper secondary teaching, i.e. by reduced length of study in each subject.Footnote 27\n\nIn 2001, the structure of the entire teacher education field was fundamentally reformed by merging what had been eight teacher degrees into a single teacher’s degree.Footnote 28 This in-depth reform was intended to strengthen professionalization by building on a common degree and by combining the establishment of a (common) professional knowledge base with both extensive profiling opportunities and common requirements for a degree project of such a level that everyone, including preschool teachers, would be qualified for doctoral-level studies. The reform did not intend to establish a single educational programme for all prospective teachers; rather, the idea was to combine some common content with increased diversification. While all new teachers would have the same degree, their diplomas would indicate the grades they were prepared to teach, the subjects they had studied and any other specializations.\n\nThe current model, established in 2011 with four different degrees and alternative orientations, constituted again a profound change compared to prior reforms, which sought to strengthen the teacher’s identity and ultimately the teaching profession through the establishment of a single degree. As with the medical profession, for example, the single degree both offered a common identity and foundational education for the profession and entailed requirements for specialization. By contrast, the 2011 reform emphasized different degrees for different types of schools, primarily related to the age of the students. A simplified trajectory of the reform is as follows:\n\n1980s: A number of different programmes and degrees were offered.\n\n1990s: The number of degree programmes and degrees was reduced in favour of a clear model of teacher education for the 9-year comprehensive school model.Footnote 29\n\n2000s: A single degree was established for preschool, elementary and upper secondary schools, including vocational subjects. However, the one-degree model did not aim to offer an identical educational programme for all student teachers; rather, the reform sought to establish a teacher identity with a strong individual profile by giving students a virtually limitless choice of courses.\n\n2010s and currently: The model organizes teacher education into four separate degrees, two of which have two or three orientations.Footnote 30\n\n2.2.2 Structural Models in Change\n\nTeacher education degrees can be obtained in Sweden in both first and second cycle studies, to use the Bologna terminology.Footnote 31 These programmes comprise a maximum of 330 ECTS (the European Credit Transfer System in which a year of full-time studies renders 60 credits, or 11 semesters of full-time studies) and a minimum 90 ECTS when a student already has conducted required studies or have appropriate work experience.Footnote 32 The foundational structure for these programmes are displayed in Table 4.1.\n\nThe two most recent reforms share a design with a common area of study in educational science for all students, but these reforms are profoundly different in their orientation. The previous programme model was basically divided into three study areas: a general field of education, an educational area and an area of specialization. In simplified terms, the general field of education consisted of central areas of knowledge (such as educational theories) and “interdisciplinary subject studies”, the educational area largely corresponded to subject studies and other traditional teacher education studies such as studies in teaching and learning language and mathematics for prospective teachers for the lowest grades, and specialization studies could involve drama, information and communication technologies and alternative pedagogies, subjects that might offer alternative insights into and perspectives on the more traditional areas of study. The assumption was that the many options offered would inspire students to craft their study profiles according to their interests and their understanding of what competence would be needed in schools in the future, enabling them to be clearer on how they would like to contribute.Footnote 33\n\nThis model, with its three study areas, was itself an attempt to break with the traditional design of subject studies, pedagogical studies and practice. The model was very decentralized; it was up to each institution to decide which studies would be included in each area and offered students enormous possibilities to shape their degree profiles. This feature, however, was likely also the model’s Achilles’s heel. The variation between programmes in different educational institutions became significant over time, and the absence of requirement on students to in advance announce their priorities and the freedom to chose their subjects for secondary teaching caused difficulties for school districts. For them, it was easier to organize schools if, for example, all math teachers also were teachers in physics or at least science, not history or art. Demands were made for more uniform programmes; thus, two foundational understandings came into conflict. Simply put, the 2001 educational reform was designed to develop schools by providing them with novel types of teachers, but that form of governance clearly conflicted with the desire of many school districts and school owners to be provided with teachers who would fit easily into their current models rather than advancing their practice by adapting to individual teachers profiles.\n\nAs shown above, Swedish teacher education is a varied landscape. The most common programme form comprises traditional campus studies, with the teaching provided at a geographical location that students attend, although new forms of teaching have emerged. Traditional programmes consist of the parts mentioned above and programmes correspond to the basic notion of university education; namely, to offer predetermined study paths to young people who want to qualify for a professional career. Stated differently, these programmes are excellent for those who, before starting their higher education studies, already know that they want to become teachers. However, others also desire to become teachers, often after having obtained other degrees or undertaken other professional activities. For them and those students who, during their studies at other programmes, realize that what they really want is to become teachers, other programmes are required, programmes that use these students’ prior studies and achievements. These programmes are usually termed “short programmes” in the Swedish context but should not be understood as “quick” options or studies that are alternative in the sense that they offer entrance into the teaching profession without the same level of qualifications. They are called “short programmes” because they consist entirely of the unique set of classes in educational science and an internship that are not available within other programmes. A short programme does not offer a different degree; what is different is the organization of studies.\n\nThe prerequisite for being admitted to a short programme is that the applicant has pursued studies within the frame of other programmes or through the system of independent courses. For example, in his or her undergraduate studies, an engineer would have taken several mathematics classes, and graduates from a biology programme would have gained extensive knowledge of what’s taught in the school subject biology; however, these types of prospective teachers are not qualified to teach in schools because they do not have a teaching degree. For these types of students, the short programme supplements their previous studies with classes in the core educational sciences and a practice-based internship. Thus, short programmes last only three semesters (90 ECTS).\n\nThis model has a particular history. After World War II, it was not widely advertised and was used as a rare and low-status exception that could be used by, for example, unemployed academics. However, this was once the main and in fact only avenue into subject-specific teaching, a model that was formalized in the early 1900s but which, in parallel with the reorganization of higher education studies, went from being based on studies in individual subjects into programmes designed to stretch over 3–5 years, as we have today, a change that put the former model in a bad light. The argument, which remains valid, was that you could better prepare a student teacher during a 5-year programme offering a specific sequence of learning events mixing different studies in a model focused on acquiring the professional competence required to be successful in the classroom than what was possible to achieve in a much shorter period of studies. So, the history is that the formerly primary model fell out of use and was replaced by the modern comprehensive programme model; in the last two decades, however, the old model has slowly been reintroduced and is now understood as a model that has as much merit as any other.Footnote 34\n\nThe preceding section has provided a picture of the common structures as expressed in the national regulations. As we have seen, there are more than 400 educational options for a prospective teacher, which means that most institutions offer several variants of the same programme. The explanation for this variety is that all programmes can be provided in different forms, at different speeds and with variable requirements in terms of both previous studies and previous professional experience; they can also account for simultaneous employment in schools and studying teacher education.\n\nHistorically, there has been a diversity in the ways to pursue teacher education studies. There have long been both formal and informal opportunities for different paces of study. In addition to traditional campus-based programmes, opportunities for distance studies have been available in teacher education programmes, as with other programmes. These have traditionally been of three different types:\n\nEducation is delivered at a location other than the institution’s campus (most Swedish institutions are single-campus institutions) and provided by visiting teachers; these may be more accurately referred to as off-campus programmes.\n\nEducation is provided as a distance programme, based on studies of literature and/or through various digital media, and students only travel to the institution’s physical campus for certain occasions. Alternatively, education is available in digital form but linked to the many different learning centres that have been established in many small municipalities without institutions for tertiary education.\n\nEducation is completely provided and examined via the internet.\n\nIn recent years, two more variants of teacher education have emerged. These apply partly to short programmes and partly to what are known as practice-integrated programmes: school-based programmes that mirror the American concept of teacher residency programmes, but with the difference that “interns” are employed for part-time teaching as a kind of substitute teacher under supervision.Footnote 35 These teacher residencies are organized so that schools employ student teachers part time as they continue their studies.Footnote 36 The driving force behind these programmes is the widespread teacher shortage and the effort to open new paths to the teaching profession. However, the model can also be viewed in light of the relatively large percentage of teachers who are employed in schools but lack a teacher’s degree and thus cannot obtain a teacher’s credentials and permanent employment.Footnote 37\n\nIt is important to clarify that what is discussed here is simply a different form of study; in the end, students receive the same degree, and the degree requirements are identical. The opportunity to undergo this type of abbreviated teacher education has always existed in practice for subject teachers but has rarely been a formalized opportunity for other teacher degrees. The increased importance of this model is reflected by the fact that approximately one-third of subject teachers now earn their degrees through these programmes.Footnote 38 Like other teacher programmes, these supplementary courses are offered through different forms of distribution and with slightly different profiles. For example, a special model has a higher rate of study (125%) for people with a research degree (either a 2-year licentiate or a 4-year doctorate).Footnote 39 These students also receive an educational grant that serves as a salary during their studies. Special education provisions also exist for teachers with foreign degrees.Footnote 40\n\nTeach for Sweden is another example of the variety in the Swedish teacher education landscape, though it has more in common with other Swedish forms of teacher education than its international counterparts. Like other short programmes, it offers people who have already obtained subject knowledge supplementary teacher education. While the initiative is identical to other programmes in that it has the same degree requirements and formal education is provided in regular higher education institutions, it differs in other aspects. Students undergo a specific selection process before admission, and the programme has a strong focus on leadership. Students are only placed in schools in disadvantaged areas with socio-economic challenges and are employed throughout their studies.Footnote 41\n\nThe demands of these programmes and what we know about the complexity of becoming a teacher raise the question of whether education provided in these varied forms can maintain not only the same level but also a high-quality level, given how they differ in student profile, time for instruction and traditional interaction between teachers and students. Those posing this question often assume that traditional campus programmes offer the highest quality, but it may be the case that interaction with and among students can be equivalent or even more frequent in online models than in traditional ones.Footnote 42 Paradoxically, these student teachers receive the lowest amount of teacher-led instruction in all of Swedish higher education, at an average of 8 h per week.Footnote 43\n\nIn summary, teacher education in Sweden is a multifaceted system that is conducted in substantially varying forms and types of educational institutions, with fundamentally different approaches to professional practice and with diverse funding and study conditions for students. From a critical perspective, it is reasonable to wonder about the possibility of maintaining equal levels of high quality in all aspects of the teacher education landscape. From another perspective, it is possible to interpret the situation as an expression of a process in which traditional forms of teacher education are under renegotiation to better meet current and future demands and the increased expectations of society and individuals.\n\n2.3 Programme Funding and Funding for Studies in Teacher Education\n\nIn Sweden, higher education is free for students; no tuition fees are charged. The general rules that apply to higher education also apply to teacher education. Students are entitled to special loans through a publicly funded national programme. Sweden has offered such student loans in one form or another since 1919. The purpose of such loans has always been to prevent those born disadvantaged from being excluded from higher education. The modern and more general provision that makes a significant part of this support a subsidy rather than a loan has been in place since the 1960s.Footnote 44 Student loans and subsidies are intended to cover the costs of living and housing, textbooks and so on.Footnote 45 Students with student loans have the right, to a certain extent, to work while they study to earn additional income or obtain valuable experience that will improve their opportunities in the permanent labour market.\n\nStudents receive their loans in the form of monthly allowances during their studies, with regular checks of credits earned to ensure that each student is proceeding according to plan. If a student fails to make the required progress, the student loan will be withdrawn.Footnote 46 These loans are to be paid back over a 25-year period that starts after graduation. One-third of the amount of support consists of the subsidy, which does not need to be repaid, and the interest rate on the loan is very low (0.05% in 2021).Footnote 47 It has been suggested that a significant amount of the loan be forgiven for graduates who agree to teach in in rural areas, which face severe teachers recruitment challenges. However, no such model has yet been nationally approved.\n\nStudent teachers in the current model for residency programmes who work as teachers during their internships receive a monthly salary in addition to what is provided as a loan. This form of integrated models with, for example, half-time work and half-time studies are fairly recent and not yet established as a national model. Rather, they have emerged as local initiatives, with only a very small proportion of the country’s student teachers registered. However, this model may become more important due to the current severe teacher shortage because of their appeal to persons with other professional careers behind them.\n\nMost of Sweden’s higher education institutions are public. Since the 1990s, education has been financed using a per capita model combined with specified cost allowances for areas of study. In practice, these institutions operate with divided funding systems for research, education and capital needs. There are currently 16 defined educational areas such as the humanities and social sciences, artistic fields and teaching. All courses offered are locally assigned to one of the various areas; through this classification, the financial bases for the education are determined. The lowest funding level applies to the humanities and social sciences (approximately SEK 53,000 in total). Natural science and medicine receive a higher level of funding of approximately SEK 86,000 and SEK 145,000, respectively. Teacher education receives approximately SEK 80,000. However, not all studies in a teacher education programme receive this funding level; for example, 210 ECTS in a 5-year programme for secondary teaching comprise subject studies and could be in the humanities or social sciences, which receive the lowest funding. The higher level of funding for teacher education only applies to educational sciences. There is also specific funding for student teacher internships (SEK 110,000), a percentage of which is used to compensate school districts for their support and supervision. Overall, one has to consider that the funding model is complicated and offers widely different conditions for different study programmes.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the per capita funding of education is divided into two parts. One part is obtained for a student who is registered for the programme in a given year, and the other part is based on how many ECTS that student earned during the year. In practice, this means that higher education institutions are encouraged to accept as many students as possible and that revenues decline in the event of decreased throughput. The model has also been criticized for providing incentives for lower quality by rewarding throughput. A strong programme rests on high quality-teaching, of which funding levels are an important precondition, but it also rests on extensive collaboration with schools and on research.\n\n2.4 Different Conditions in Different Institutions\n\nThe model for how higher education is funded initially appears to grant equal conditions for all institutions, but that is not at always the case in reality. A central aspect of high-quality education in academia is a strong connection between education and research. Consequently, Sweden’s Higher Education Act requires institutions to maintain a “close connection between research and education”.Footnote 48 Research is, as noted above, financed separately from how pedagogical activities and does not use an equality-based model. Universities receive more extensive research funding than university colleges, older universities receive more funding than newer ones, institutions with particular profiles receives more funding than other and so on; taken together, this means that the same category of educational programme (e.g., a programme for primary school teachers) has different prerequisites that depend on the institution offering the programme. The model for distribution of research funding is primarily historical but does consider some quality indicators on the margins.Footnote 49\n\nTeacher education is provided within different institutional categories, and since they receive very different proportions of research funding, the conditions for students vary greatly. Naturally, other conditions are also important, but this is arguably more than a marginal example of different prerequisites for these programmes; in fact, it is a crucial factor in the quality of higher education programmes in general. Table 4.2 aims to indicate how varied the local possibilities are to anchor educational programs in research are by presenting an overview of some examples of differences in this respect between an old university, a university inaugurated 1965, one designated a university in 1999 and a university college.\n\nThe pattern is clear. Institutions of the same category as University College Dalarna has significantly less resources for providing its students with the type of enriching instruction that is based on an intense connection between research and learning opportunities that draws upon a deliberately programmatic design that gives the student extensive experiences of and insights into knowledge production and use. This is particularly important as teacher education programmes in general are proportionally larger in these type of institutions.\n\nIt must be noted that the Swedish higher education system has no mechanism to control the crucial link between research and education other than the general regulations stipulated in in the Higher Education Act.Footnote 50 As a consequence, there is a wide variety between institutions in how this is realized, and it also varies within institutions, depending on how they prioritize academic vs. professional in their funding models for research. In fact, there are no systematic reviews of how the size of research funding is linked to the teacher education field and to what degree teacher programmes are located within active research environments. These difficulties relate to the fact that teacher education and aligned educational sciences in Swedish higher education institutions usually is not located within separate organizational units. Therefore, this type of research is conducted within a variety of academic units and contexts.Footnote 51 A recent governmental inquiry also confirmed that there is a lack of information regarding investments in educational science research and that it is very difficult to establish such information.Footnote 52 But let’s look at some indications.\n\nA national evaluation of the teacher education programmes in 2005 found “established research related to teacher education” in four universities and “relatively extensive resources” for third cycle studies related to teacher education in an additional four institutions.Footnote 53 The review evaluated 25 institutions. The 2008 evaluation found that the situation had improved; for example, research grants in this area at Uppsala University increased by over 60% compared with 2004. At the same time, the grant comprised only 0.65% of that university’s total research resources.Footnote 54 One study found that in two relatively large universities (institutions with extensive research funding), teacher education accounted for 8–10% of all degrees offered in 2012–2014, while that area was estimated to receive about 3.5% of research resources, indicating that neither national, nor local distribution of research resources did not appear to take into account the need for teacher education to be conducted in highly research-oriented environments.Footnote 55\n\nIn summary, the conditions for and quality of teacher education programme vary widely in Sweden’s higher education system. However, there has been some governmental support of relevant research during the last decades.Footnote 56 While this is clearly an improvement, the effort began from a very low level, so it is hard to foresee a significant increase of equality in the conditions between teacher education and other academic areas or between teacher education at different institutions. This change must be understood also in the context of deteriorating organisational autonomy for the teacher education sphere within Swedish higher education institutions (see Sect. 4.2).\n\n2.5 The Many Reforms\n\nIt is difficult to understand the current model for teacher education, its strengths and weaknesses and thus the debates about it without a historical context. The briefest examination of modern Swedish society will reveal that education and teacher education are almost always on the reform agenda. The most recent example is from 2018. The election that September became followed by a rare process before a new administration took power. Usually, a new government is in place within a week or two after an election, but this did not occur until the beginning of 2019. The key obstacles turned out to be a rather detailed agreement (in 73 bullet points) between the parties from the previous administration, which ran from 2014 to 2018, and two liberal parties.Footnote 57 The agreement contained a number of reforms in the educational field, including reform of teacher education. A ministerial report was published and sent out for a public hearing in early 2021. We do not yet know where this process will end but, in accordance with the agreement, it will most likely result in the fourth teacher education reform in just over three decades and in the seventh reform that fundamentally changes Sweden’s national framework for teacher education since World War Two (Table 4.3).\n\nSince the Second World War, two major comprehensive university reforms have also profoundly impacted teacher education. The first was implemented at the end of the 1970s and came to have the greatest importance for teacher education by upgrading most post-secondary education to the university level. The old teacher seminars were discontinued, and the ongoing development and establishment of new, academically strong and research-based higher teacher education institutions designated for teacher education, that began in the 1950s was terminated in favour of a general merger of teacher education into existing higher education institutions. The basic motives for the reform were to increase accessibility, especially for students from families without academic traditions, to expand higher education programme offerings and to contribute to the democratization of higher education.Footnote 58 One consequence of this reform was that the more practice-based and skills-oriented teacher training based on the notion of professional training akin to the apprentice model (and located in teacher seminars) lost ground. Another way to put it is that it was boosted by the closer contact with the academic teacher education tradition in the universities, which was based on the scientific study of learning.\n\nPrior to this reform, these traditions had also been in dialogue with each other, but they were now supposed to exist within the frame of a single organization. Today’s debates on teacher education issues are largely a continuing negotiation of the issues raised by this merger, which is now more than four decades in the past.Footnote 59 The reform of 2022 have not been announced as a reform, neither have it been prepared as a reform (which usually include a significant work by an governmental inquiry). It is only announced as a governmental initiative to raise quality of teacher education programs, establishing more attractive entry routes into teaching, raised entry requirements and improved governance.Footnote 60 The reform addresses heavily the problematic teacher shortage in Sweden but not much is said about how the reform reduces the required period of studies and how the new model for validation of prior studies in fact might reduce the requirements of academic qualification within the subjects that prospective teacher intend to teach.\n\nReforms aiming at countering teacher shortage more or less by default risk to negatively impact strategies for raised teacher quality. Swedish teacher education reform of 2022 appears to be a typical example of that. We have tough to take into account that the most challenging initiatives in that respect are conditioned within a 5 year period of experimentation. It might be the caste that this model will become permanent but it is of course also possible that it will be terminated within 5 years as the teacher shortage are diminishing according to predictions. It is though a rather remarkable move to launch such an experimentation. Sweden also have a significant shortage of physicians, but no voices is heard about alternative routes into medicine and shortening of programs to ease that problem. Probably we are witnessing a turning point in teacher education policy with the launch of the reform of 2022. Not only in these respects but also that sense that despite a decade of policy on increased autonomy for higher education institutions, this reform articulate need of and entail a more detailed governance of content in teacher education programs.Footnote 61\n\n2.6 Politics and Policy: The Relation Between Schools, Teacher Education and Educational Equity\n\nThe general political consensus around the introduction of the comprehensive school model was not strong and did consequently not last. The debate about the strengths and weaknesses of that model has naturally included questions about how teachers are educated; while that debate is too vast to fully analyse here, it has had a profound impact on teacher education reforms.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the far-reaching decentralization and marketization of Swedish schools in the early 1990s led to teacher education becoming increasingly important for national equity. On December 8, 1989, a parliamentary decision transferred the responsibility for comprehensive schools from the national government to municipalities. On this occasion the Minister of Education and future Prime minister, Göran Persson, argued for the reform and highlighted, in response to the criticism that it would cause high levels of inequality, five factors that would guarantee educational equality and equity.Footnote 62 After only a few years, only two of those factors remained – the national curriculum and the national teacher education model. However, a few years after that, the curriculum was dramatically reduced in both volume and specificity and reinforced the prevailing decentralization trend by leaving greater space for principals and teachers to make decisions and take actions independently, which also increased the importance of teacher education for equality and equity in education.\n\nAs the above description makes clear, Swedish teacher education is now housed in higher education institutions, and academia operates within a profound sense of autonomy. These institutions, despite being publicly funded and theoretically answerable to government, are notoriously hard to direct, so it has proven difficult to create and implement these programmes in a manner that supports equality in Swedish schools, given the wide variety of conditions. A national evaluation of all teacher education programmes in 2005 concluded that the model chosen for teacher preparation had created high levels of programme variation in both content and form.Footnote 63 The reform of 2011 aimed to reduce that variation, but Swedish teacher education is still a varied landscape. This observation should be taken into account with the assessment that the school system, through decentralization and marketization, has evolved from standardized and uniform into a state of “programmatic variation” which adds to the complexity.Footnote 64\n\n2.7 Autonomous Higher Education Institutions Conducting Nationally Regulated Programmes: A Problematic Context?\n\nTeacher education exists in the context of tension between institutional autonomy and national regulation.\n\nAlthough each higher education institution has substantial autonomy on how to design, organize and operate academic programmes, the national Higher Education Ordinance regulates the degrees that they can award. General programmes like Bachelor of Arts or Master of Science are regulated in terms of quantitative requirements – how many ECTS a given degree entails – and by a core of nationally stipulated learning outcomes.Footnote 65 However, programmes leading to professional degrees, especially teacher education programmes, have an extensive set of national regulations on numerous aspects: content, form, length of studies, combination of subjects and learning outcomes.Footnote 66 The reform of 2022 takes this a step further by establishing a particular legislative regulation separate from The Higher Education Act and The Higher Education Ordinance, a move that diverge from the amplified governmental discourse during last years on the importance of autonomy for higher education institutions.Footnote 67\n\nThese national regulations are more extensive for teacher education programmes than other programmes. They also stipulate how many weeks should be spent on internships in schools and that 1 year (60 ECTS) is dedicated to “core education subjects” and their content. This detailed national regulation of teacher preparation has to be understood in the context of teacher education remaining one of the few traditional instruments for the national government to direct school development in a very decentralized school model.\n\nIn principle, national regulations are not supposed to specify the content of study programmes, with the exceptions described above. Content is to be locally determined, using plans established in each educational institution and each programme, and in their associated curricula. However, content and to some degree forms of implementation are regulated through the learning objectives associated with each degree. These objectives are divided into three categories, as shown with examples in Table 4.4.\n\nIn one sense, teacher education programmes are regulated like other programmes; and in theory, local institutions can add objectives, but that rarely occurs in teacher education. What stands out compared to other programmes are the more extensive quantitative and qualitative requirements for obtaining a degree, which may help explain why only some institutions have developed local objectives. The aspect that most clearly distinguishes the directive for teacher education from other programmes involves the very specific content directives regarding the year of study in core education subjects, which the regulations stipulate must include the following:\n\nhistory of the school system, its organization and conditions, along with core educational values including fundamental democratic values and human rights\n\nsyllabus theory and didactics\n\ntheory of knowledge and research methodology\n\ninterdisciplinary studies in development and learning, including studies in cognitive science, and special needs education\n\nsocial relationships, conflict management and leadership\n\nassessment and grading, and\n\nevaluation and development processes.Footnote 68\n\nThis regulation does not mean that there have to be seven different courses or that this content should be grouped into a general area of studies taken by all student teachers in the same manner. On the contrary, it is to be read as a specification of content; it is also made clear that these studies should be adapted to future professional practice.Footnote 69 At the same time, the directives are vague enough that it is possible to interpret them as implying that these studies should be different from others and thus specifically intended for teachers. However, national teacher education policy have increasingly become detailed in its governance. The requirement launched in 2022 (mentioned above) that all programs should comprise studies in cognitive science is a recent example of that. The government has also announced their intention to establish a national model for monitoring the exact number of hours of instruction in teacher education programs, a rather remarkable example of detailed directives.Footnote 70\n\nOther examples of the more explicit national governance of these programmes are the detailed regulations regarding which subjects can be combined into a degree.Footnote 71 This is a striking contrast to the prior model in which it was up to each student to choose school subjects. As there has not been extensive debate on this change, it might be perceived as minor, but it is striking from the perspective of educating professionals that future members of the teaching profession are not granted this right to plan their careers. A last example involves grading. Generally, each institution decide on a grading system for its programmes, but that freedom is restricted for teacher education programmes.Footnote 72 This trajectory continues in a ministerial report in early 2021 that outlines proposals for future reforms of teacher education.Footnote 73 The articulated intention of the document is to address issues of teacher quality and the teacher shortage; despite the fact that institutional autonomy is emphasized, the document proposes detailed national regulation of content, among other areas, about which more detail appears below.\n\nThese examples show how national governance does not really accord with institutional self-perceptions of autonomy or with the national government’s articulated but partly ostensible support of the idea of autonomous academic institutions. The rhetoric on institutional autonomy that has paradoxically grown in during recent years in the form of national higher education reforms signalling increased autonomy.Footnote 74 Teacher education is thus struggling to some extent with its localization in academia. Put differently and perhaps more accurately, the organs of the national government and academic institutions are all struggling with how to handle teacher education as both a professional and an academic programme.Footnote 75\n\nBefore looking into todays challenges, let’s take a look at some problem areas of a general and profound nature, less colored by contemporary culture and politics.\n\n3.1 Critique and Critical Notions: How Can We Understand the Current Situation?\n\n3.1.1 A Picture of the Criticism\n\nTeacher education is a frequently debated topic. Over the last decade, the Swedish phrase that translates to “teacher education” has appeared in daily newspapers more than a thousand times annually, which indicates indicating not only the level of debate but also its persistent nature.Footnote 76 The criticisms of teacher education usually involve the following aspects:\n\nThe quality is low, as is the throughput.\n\nThere is a lack of balance between theory and practice.\n\nThe components of programmes do not align.\n\nThere is an insufficient and focus on the practice of teaching that appears too late in the programmes.\n\nThere is too little focus on classroom management and the teacher’s role as leader and inspirer.\n\nProgrammes are unable to develop future teachers’ ability to individualize their teaching to meet their students’ needs.\n\nProgrammes are reluctant to prepare students for parental cooperation and other tasks outside the classroom.\n\nTeacher education programmes are isolated from other academic programmes, professions and potentially enriching environments.\n\nInstitutions fail to identify students that are ill suited for the teaching profession and do not force such students to leave the programme.\n\nThe rules that govern how students combine different subjects in their degrees are dysfunctional.\n\nThe recognition and validation of other studies adopt too narrow a view, leading to bottlenecks in terms of entering the profession).\n\nThe continuity in these critiques is nothing short of remarkable. The Swedish government assigned in 1946 a school commission with a driving ambition to reform education in Sweden; its members soon realized that this effort also required reforming teacher preparation and studied what was wrong with such programmes at that time. The above is a summary of criticisms that appeared in their work in the 1940s, but these themes can also be found in today’s debate.Footnote 77\n\nNot only is there a consistency in this criticism, there is also a stunning continuity in the proposed solutions to educational shortcomings. When it comes to teachers, there has to be improvement in “recruitment and the possibility of better selection, better substantive education in teacher training institutions, on-the-job training of younger teachers by more experienced ones”; of course, there has to be a raise in pay and an increase in status and “prestige of the teaching profession”. We discuss these same propositions today and, although they are put on the table as new, they have a long history in Sweden and elsewhere. The quotes in this paragraph are from an influential report that appeared after the Sputnik crisis in the late 1950s in the United States, but they are still voiced today in the Swedish debate.Footnote 78\n\nIt is striking to consider how many times questions regarding teacher education have been inquired since the beginning of the post-war redesign of the educational system in Sweden and how many reforms have taken place, but the same criticism recurs again and again, as if we are marching in circles and revisiting eternal problems and dilemmas.Footnote 79 If there were simple solutions to educational problems, this would not be happening. But because the challenges in that field are more close to dilemmas than readily solvable problems, they persist because they “are messy, complicated, and conflict-filled situations that require undesirable choices between competing, highly prized values that cannot be simultaneously of fully satisfied”.Footnote 80 Much of the criticism depicts an endeavour that is standing still rather than moving forward, but at the same time teachers and principals testify about change, change and more change. A well-informed mind might be able to paint a more nuanced picture by describing how these dilemmas could be balanced, rather than “solved”, which simply is not likely to happen because so many educational issues are about human differences, relationships, and contextual factors.\n\n3.1.2 Ambitions and Conditions for Realization\n\nWe have seen above the high level of national reform efforts in Swedish teacher education, and the recurrent criticisms may lead to the conclusion that we are dealing with a problem without solutions. However, it may be the case that reforms have focused on problem solving when it would have been more appropriate to devise strategies that focus on dilemmas and how to balance their competing perspectives. Why? Because teacher education as an endeavour exists amid other activities and their main priorities. This is a consequence of the fact that a limited understanding sees teacher education as programmes preparing individuals for a certain task and of no value in itself; in other words, its only value is related to its importance for the education of others.Footnote 81 At the heart of designing teacher education programmes, there is thus a conflict between prioritizing what is best for schools and their pupils and other priorities. The situation in schools, societal and individual educational ambitions and the like sets the primary frame for what are usually perceived as problems in teacher education, but how ambitions will be realized depends on the priorities of higher education institutions and their school districts partners.\n\nThe very mission of schools contains seeds of some of the challenges that teacher education programmes have faced. What should be the core elements of educating children and youth? Subject knowledge and skills? Or is education about something more, something that also includes personal development, identities, socialization and acquisition of democratic values? And what about the forms for instruction – should there be one-way transmission of information, student-centred dialogue, problem-based inquiries, or what?\n\nFrequently, the discussion becomes a tug-of-war between poles that can clash with the mission of education and the foundational insight that systematic acquisition of knowledge and skills only rarely occurs without a broader development of the individual, as we all change in relation to what we learn. Put differently, individual development in this respect is largely about internalizing knowledge and mastering capabilities, and this acquisition process relates to values, understanding life, society, identity and what it means to be a human in this world.Footnote 82\n\nMost teachers have found that teaching involves both explaining and describing phenomena and consciously shaping representations and processes to suit the learner, on the one hand, and motivating and interesting learners so that they not only becomes open and receptive but actually internalize knowledge into personal “knowing” and form insights in a meaningful manner, so that knowledge is not only accessible but “lives” in people’s consciousness and becomes an integral part of their personal identity and how they perceive the world, and by that becomes a resource for agency and action.\n\nThese multiple ambitions define schools as complex undertakings that face major challenges that are likely to be even greater for those who seek to educate teachers. On one hand, the challenges involve general conditions for school education as such and partly the cross-border nature of the teaching profession itself. The above description of the purpose of school education indicates that it has several functions. It should help qualify individuals for professional life, but it must also lay the foundations for their active lives as citizens and must in addition also contribute to the socialization of individuals so that they can work and live together and be able to develop a democratic society. Furthermore, education should offer all students an opportunity to develop their personality and understand themselves, enabling them to nurture their dreams and handle their lives accordingly.Footnote 83 Finally, as Aristotle argued, the aim of the constitution, the shared effort to create a life together, is happiness; education is the central activity in that effort as it turns human beings into citizens.Footnote 84\n\nAs challenging as education is in itself, it occurs in different contexts and against an unknown future, which is a challenge of enormous magnitude. Linda Darling-Hammond describes it well: “Thus, the new mission of schools is to prepare students to work in jobs that do not exist, to create ideas and solutions for products and problems that have not yet been identified, using technologies that have not yet been invented”.Footnote 85 It is no surprise that there are so many understandings of education and thus what is most essential in teacher education, as the different ambitions stretch from limited to daunting, from individual to collective and from reproducing what is known to transformative abilities oriented towards an unknown and unknowable future. But what do these debates reflect?\n\n3.1.3 The Illusion of Simplicity\n\nEducating students for an unfamiliar tomorrow is obviously difficult, and for those who will educate schoolteachers, even more challenges are added. In The Trouble with Ed Schools, David Labaree notes two particular difficulties in American teacher education. The first is that “teaching is an enormously difficult job that looks easy”.Footnote 86 One consequence of the fact that teaching, to an untrained eye, may look simple in its execution is that those responsible for crafting education policy have likely underestimated the need for firm structures that advance teachers’ instructional abilities; another is an underdeveloped professional language and an insufficient professional knowledge base.\n\nThe lack of support for advancing teaching capabilities is easily identifiable from a historical perspective, not the least from the fact that society has periodically expanded school education, whether from a 6-year mandatory model into a 9-years model or otherwise, without ensuring that when these measures are implemented, well-educated teachers are on hand to fulfil the lofty ambitions of policy. Another example is the common absence of any systematic initiative for teachers’ career-long development.Footnote 87 Yet another is the prevalence of the extensive use of inadequately educated teacher substitutes, in stark contrast to the practices in comparable professions of direct relevance to the general public and regulated by the government.\n\nThe second difficulty that Labaree discusses is not about the seemingly simplistic nature of teaching but its complexity, its high degree of difficulty: “The general rule of teaching is that general rules do not help very much”.Footnote 88 Early efforts in Sweden to build an academic foundation for the professional practice tended to simplify educational and psychological reasoning, in stark contrast to the teaching experience. In addition, and as a consequence of tendencies towards the trivialization of professional tasks, many efforts were invested in finding the “one” method for instruction rather than enhancing teachers’ competence to autonomously make decisions about using a variety of instructional strategies and models based on what the content, students and context require, in essence, this development signals a tension between professionalization and de-professionalization. On a general level, it took until the 1990s before more subject-specific research on teaching and learning, mirroring the pedagogical content knowledge approach that emerged in United States, become a more widely used research orientation in Sweden.\n\n3.1.4 General Methods but Teaching Is About Specific Activities, Individual Students and Teachers\n\nThe dilemma regarding aspects of general and specific orientation of teachers professional knowledge has several dimensions as it involves issues regarding variation in content, subjects, school forms and the like, on the one hand, and human differences on the other. Students and teachers are individuals with shifting priorities, capacities, approaches and motivations. The challenge is even more daunting as the standard procedure in education is collective, and these types of differences can cause difficult dynamics in interaction, exchange and receptiveness.\n\nThere has historically been a tension in teacher education between whether a focus on general pedagogical studies or more specific ones are preferable. These positions highly oversimplify the foundational question about the knowledge and competence needed to be capable of systematically helping another person to acquire certain insights and capabilities. As touched on above, both content and humans vary, which shapes opportunities for teaching and learning, a long-established mainstream observation in educational research.Footnote 89 However, depending on circumstances, like for example a gap between what a person knows and the knowledge that the same person is expected to acquire, both general and specific strategies might be applicable. It could also be the case that a specific approach might be more useful in designing an instructional activity but less so for analysing the outcome of a sequence of instruction. The way forward for teacher education in this respect appears to be about deepening insights into the different variations and their relation to certain aspects of functionality rather than deciding what is “right” or “wrong”; those insights must be accompanied by attention to the fact that teachers must be allowed to act according to general insights in diverse patterns and thus be deeply anchored in themselves and their personality.Footnote 90\n\nIn a study of what teachers really do when they teach it is described that:\n\n“They portray curriculum content in a way that renders it comprehensible to naive minds,\n\nfor students who are not necessarily interested in learning,\n\nwhose grasp of the content is not readily visible to the teacher,\n\nand who are restless and easily distracted;\n\nin a way that satisfies the teachers’ personal needs.”Footnote 91\n\nWhat is added here is that on top of the student dimensions of instructional challenges, there is also a monumental challenge faced by a teacher educator – to help all prospective teachers find their way to teach, teaching must not only be appropriate to every situation as to content and learner but also in harmony with the teacher’s personality. The rationale is not only to avoid too much discrepancy between what the teacher says and does and what he or she “is” for the students, but also and above all to maximize synergy, where teachers’ actions, being and attitude support the totality of ambitions, societal and individual, that characterize the school as an institution.\n\nThis kind of challenging totality that every teacher has to shoulder, this holistic notion of teaching and its importance for successful teaching too often appear missing from the picture, perhaps because it is a daunting challenge and a perspective that can be difficult to digest. However, it may be the case that this phenomenon relates to the level of difficulty in the sense that it has hampered research and consequently the development of a professional language, despite the fact that its importance is widely accepted among students, parents, teachers and principals. Educating teachers is a profound challenge in itself, and any aspiration to educate teachers must address the following foundational questions:\n\nWhat should be the objectives of the programmes?\n\nWho can be educated into teaching and who should become a teacher?\n\nWhat should teachers study?\n\nWhen should the various content be studied and in what order?\n\nWho could and should educate new teachers?\n\nWhere should teachers be educated? In what settings and under what circumstances?\n\nHow should the programmes interact and collaborate with schools and the profession?Footnote 92\n\nFundamentally, it is about having a well-developed answer to the question of what characterizes the most favourable situation for a person to acquire the knowledge and competencies needed by a successful teacher. This leads to another set of questions that complements the preceding list:\n\nWhat kind of experiences do children need to grow and learn and develop the confidence and competence they need to succeed in life?\n\nWhat kind of knowledge do teachers need to facilitate these experiences for children and youth?\n\nWhat kinds of experiences must teachers have to develop these kinds of knowledge?Footnote 93\n\n3.1.5 Teaching as an Epistemological Challenge\n\nThe situation is a bit paradoxical. On the one hand, reflecting on three central aspects introduced above, it appears not to be particularly difficult to establish and operate a teacher education programme. On the other, historical experience and the previously outlined difficulties lead to the opposite conclusion. It appears as if the endeavour to educate teachers branches into a series of difficult challenges for the various actors involved. To achieve success at the system level, it appears necessary that all challenges be met insightfully and with explicit and strong ambitions. The following points appear to be the crucial challenges:\n\nteacher education as a societal task\n\nteacher education as a collaborative task for the school system and for individual schools\n\nteacher education as a professional task for higher education institutions\n\nteacher education as a task for particular organizations in these institutions, each with its own legacy\n\nteacher education as task for individual teacher educators\n\nteacher education as a task for the teaching profession and individual schoolteachers\n\nteacher education as a study programme for prospective teachers.\n\nEach bullet point translates into an extensive field of sub-questions, many of which have been discussed at length in the literature. But in addition to these points and those above, there is a perspective on the body of professional knowledge and competence that appears to have been at least partly overlooked. If we can conclude that content, context and people all vary, then we can understand something about the profound challenges teachers face in their daily work. However, we have to expand this perspective as the enactment of teaching also occurs at the intersection between epistemology and the foundational purposes of education.\n\nA brief discussion might depart from Aristotle and his epistemological distinctions of “qualities through which the mind achieves truth” that translates into capacities like “art or technical skill, scientific knowledge, prudence, wisdom and intelligence”.Footnote 94 In a more simplified version in the educational literature, his notions boil down distinctions between to “know that” (episteme), to “know how” (techne) and to “know why” (phronesis), but we need to add dimensions that Aristotle’s wider view appears to have included or at least pointed towards. We can think about this in terms of bildung, (the capacities to take an overview, make connections, synthesize and identify implications, etc.), generative abilities, envisioning and creativity. A teacher needs to possess all these qualities and be simultaneously aware of them and the fact the task at hand in every moment in the classroom is to further all pupils’ development in all these aspects while at the same time enact the main function of education: qualification for working life and for an active life in society, together with socialization and subjectification. This enactment also has to be purposeful for all students on every occasion, meaning that when responding to one student’s question, the teacher has to consider how his or her response can be conducive to all students learning and towards developing all of Aristotle’s qualities – and hence fulfilling the extensive purposes with education. This aspect of complexity is usually overlooked, which is surprising given that it is consequential for education in the form that exists in most societies today. A tentative explanation for why these dimensions is seldom foregrounded is that the educational literature prioritizes reducing complexity to make these issues more accessible for prospective teachers.\n\nThis dimension adds extensively to the difficulty that inherently comes with designing teacher education programmes. Due to societal changes and the growing body of research, it appears necessary – on every occasion and in every context – to revisit and renegotiate the approach to these persistent questions about how best to educate teachers. The preceding discussion has suggested why this renegotiation is both necessary and difficult. Society is changing, as are the role of schools and teaching assignments, but the conditions for higher education itself are also changing. On an individual level, each person’s choice of path in life is part of a larger shift between generations, values ​​and understandings of the individual and society. The trajectory of how values in Sweden are changing is certainly not unique, but it is highly distinctive in its individualism and secularism.Footnote 95\n\nAt bottom, the entire area of ​​teacher education is a mix of challenges characterized by adaptation and change to meet new trends, the retention of both basic knowledge and competences necessary for teaching and the foundational academic approach and the ability to renew knowledge and insights through a scientific system based on an independent, creative and critical attitudes. The next section shifts the focus from these overarching questions to more concrete aspects of the challenges faced by contemporary Swedish teacher education.\n\n3.2 Problems and Challenges in and for Today’s Teacher Education Programmes\n\nCriticisms of contemporary Swedish teacher education are best understood from the perspective of the perpetual need to revisit and renegotiate how society shoulders the task of educating teachers. As such, it ought to be a deliberation that involves practitioners, researchers, schools (not to forget pupils and their parents), higher education and politicians. However, the debate appears to have become, to a significant extent, a political battleground, with proposals emerging that reflect the political needs for visibility rather than a sincere desire to improve education. There is presently a discussion about the content of these programmes. In simplified terms, the criticism consists partly of a discussion about removing certain study areas in favour of, say, teaching about modern cognitive science, brain research and digital tools, and a discussion that seeks to highlight content in education that could help address current societal problems, such as sustainable development. The former can at least partly illustrate how content issues tends to become zero-sum games, and the latter how societal problems and dilemmas that are hard to solve or at least sufficiently rebalance can easily become educationalized.Footnote 96 In Sweden, teacher education since 1990 has been continuously evaluated by national government agencies We start this section by looking into these reports.\n\n3.2.1 Quality in Terms of Programmes: Evaluations, Politics and Reforms\n\nIn recent years, all teacher education programmes have been evaluated by the Swedish Higher Education Authority.Footnote 97 Outcomes are either approved, indicating they are of high quality, or failed. In the latter case, there is a 1-year process for improvement that involves submitting a revised report and follow-up processes. If the second evaluation also indicates insufficient quality, the programme is terminated.Footnote 98 Recent findings are as follows:\n\nOf 19 preschool teacher education programmes, 11 were approved.Footnote 99\n\nOf 48 primary school teacher education programmes, 24 were approved.Footnote 100\n\nOf 102 secondary teacher education (subject-specific) programmes, 58 were approved.Footnote 101\n\nOf 10 vocational teacher education programmes, 4 were approved.Footnote 102\n\nThe criticism of a programme can vary, along with the evaluation methods applied and the context in which the review takes place. Swedish teacher education programmes had prior to this last round been evaluated 2005 and 2008; in addition, in 2010 all institutions were forced to undergo an accreditation process.Footnote 103 This section begins with a review of those outcomes. In 2005, the evaluation included a follow-up of the 2001 reform.Footnote 104 Criticism was directed at that time at the quality of the programmes in terms of organization, teacher competence and the degree to which they were research-based. The clear impression was conveyed that the programmes were highly varied and thus failed to achieve equality. For example, some higher education institutions clearly had established research that related to their programmes, while others to a high degree lacked such support for their programmes and some institutions devoted significant resources to research, whereas others did not.Footnote 105\n\nIt is not surprising that a reform featuring flexibility and freedom of choice could result in a situation in which students in parallel programmes at different institutions received highly varied educations and thus demonstrated highly varied competence as teachers in the end, which is a problem from a school-oriented equality perspective. Additionally, problems regarding progression were noted in most programmes and appeared to the evaluators as fragmented, which, in combination with unclear or minimal exit requirements, had a negative impact on the programmes.Footnote 106\n\nThe evaluation results were widely circulated in the media, a process that was ignited by the minister in charge of higher education and research, the social democrat Leif Pagrotsky, who published a debate article under the heading “I do not accept the low demands on student teachers”, in which he extensively criticized these programmes.Footnote 107 Soon after, similarly intense criticism came from the rest of the political spectrum. The municipality of Stockholm had long had a local politician heavily engaged in educational issues, Jan Björklund of the Liberal Party. His political energy was largely focused on frequent and extensive criticism of schooling and teacher education in Sweden.Footnote 108 Together with his party leadership, he soon published a debate article that not only articulated sharp criticism but also argued for discontinuing responsible institutions.\n\nThe article put forward the necessity of making teacher education a responsibility of higher education generally rather than particular institutions.Footnote 109 A reform had already been implemented in the 1970s, so that approach was perceived by many educators to be based on either a misunderstanding or a conscious political strategy for visibility or other tactical priorities. However, as Sweden still had one institution that only educated teachers, the Stockholm Institute of Education, the argument was valid in that municipality, in contrast to the national situation. The intensity of the debate has to be understood in the light of increased political tensions between the social democratic government in place since 1994 and the growing aspirations of liberal-conservative opposition parties to win the elections in 2006, an ambition for which they formed an alliance in 2004. That alliance did win the 2006 elections, with Björklund soon becoming minister for education.Footnote 110\n\nAcademic leaders in charge of teacher education aspired to give their view of the situation but were denied access to the same debate forum. They chose to purchase a full-page advertisement with the same layout as the debate forum to publish their response, which reveals the intensity of the debate. Their message was that a biased, unbalanced and unilateral debate risked “lowering the status and quality of teacher education”.Footnote 111 It is difficult to avoid interpreting the intense debate as an expression of the politicization of the view on schools and thus teacher education, along with the tension between outside and inside perspectives.\n\nIn light of the shortcomings found in the evaluation, follow-up studies appeared in November 2006, which argued that one in four students who had pursued a teacher’s degree should actually have failed.Footnote 112 The harshness of the debate was not in accordance with what the evaluation had proposed. Despite being profoundly critical, the evaluation did not propose any terminations of accreditation or anything that dramatic. Instead, a report for each institution was presented that offered transparent and balanced recommendations and advice. In addition, a series of special investigations was published that drew attention to weaknesses in the national framework for these programmes.Footnote 113\n\nIn December 2006, the new government announced, again in a debate article, that it intended to discontinue the Stockholm Institute of Education, that it was the government policy that higher education institutions that did not respond appropriately to the evaluation criticisms should lose their accreditation and that a government inquiry regarding a full reform of teacher education would be established.Footnote 114 In spring 2007, the two ministers from the Liberal Party at the Department for Education, again in a debate article, presented a major reform package of teacher programmes, and the national inquiry into a new teacher education model was announced in summer 2007.Footnote 115\n\nAll in all, the process clearly revealed a high degree of political engagement in the issue, and the process did not follow the traditional dialogue-based model; instead, a series of decisions were made that signalled a strong determination to impose change from the top down. The inquiry that had led to the teacher education model that would now be discontinued had been conducted by a parliamentary committee.Footnote 116 The purpose of such an inquiry is usually to emphasize the importance of an issue and to reach a political agreement that includes most of the parties in parliament to secure long-term stability. When the new inquiry was launched, a radically different model was chosen, featuring a single chair, a secretariat and a group of experts.Footnote 117 In this model, the experts were more of a group that were consulted during the process rather than a group playing a decisive role.\n\nThe evaluation had made clear that it was the responsibility of criticized institutions to take action and that a new evaluation was planned to study their expected progress. The sequence of political initiatives and events is somewhat surprising, as the government obviously did not wait for the outcome of that evaluation before taking actions that would completely overhaul the model, an initiative that appears to have been predetermined and hence without a foundation in the follow-up evaluation.Footnote 118 In retrospect and from the perspective of contemporary problems with teacher education and the high level of continuity in the criticisms of these programmes, the episode is an example of these programmes’ vulnerability to political governance. On the one hand, it is self-evident that politics has a role in setting directives for endeavours of such vital societal importance as teacher education and that policies must ensure quality in such programmes. On the other, politicians are not experts and may cause more problems than they solve if they act without a strong, independent foundation of information. There are risks in not taking action, but it might be even riskier to implement profound change in a badly designed form and in a manner that does not nurture long-term improvement.\n\nThe evaluation presented in spring 2008 showed significant improvements, but the problems with too few teacher educators with PhDs remained in many places. Institutions had taken action to reduce flexibility and thereby established more standardized pathways in the criticized programmes; however, the problem of weak subject-specific educational studies remained. The evaluators also found deficiencies in compulsory elements and the general progression in studies. Problems of excessive variation remained to some extent, and the programmes still revealed features of fragmentation. For example, the study found that in one university, education was provided without a stable staff; 160 teachers were involved in the programmes, but the average proportion of their work for those programmes was only 10%, a situation that was perceived as insufficient to ensure continuity and coherence.Footnote 119 In total, 10 of 26 institutions had at least one programme that was not approved.Footnote 120\n\nIn December 2008 came the report from the governmental inquiry on teacher education reform and in February 2010, the government presented the bill Best in Class: A New Teacher Education and already in April the bill was passed by the parliament.Footnote 121 The new programmes were expected to admit their first students in 2011, before which they all had to receive accreditation, as one consequence of the reform was the introduction of new degrees which rendered all previous accreditations formally obsolete. This decision has to be understood in the context of the political debates and the government’s desire to reduce the number of institutions offering teaching degrees.\n\nAfter a 10-year reform period, the 2019–2021 evaluations found essentially the same problems as had been depicted in previous evaluations.Footnote 122 The programmes’ design, implementation and results were according to these evaluations failing.Footnote 123 The landscape is shifting and the team of experts asserted that their impression was that teacher education programmes are operated by “hard-working and ambitious teachers”; they reported encountering “many good examples”.Footnote 124 However, a review of all the institution-specific assessments indicates that variation remains within certain areas. As stated above, there are deficiencies in progression, coherence and assessment, but the expert group also points towards the importance of ensuring students’ learning, which we have to understand as referring to the continuation of insufficient examination.Footnote 125\n\nIn previous evaluations, the scientific and research basis of the programmes was shown to have clear deficiencies, which remains despite the improvement found in 2008 of the allocation of research resources in several higher education institutions.Footnote 126 In the latest round of evaluation, it was found that resources in terms of teacher educators with relevant PhDs were deficient in several institutions; there were also examples of programmes with overly fragmented teaching staff, which the assessment group believed to have a negative impact on education.\n\nA well-developed scientific environment appears to be a necessary but insufficient condition for high-quality education in a scientific sense. Successful researchers tend to have very little teaching time in the programmes, and a key challenge is to remedy this and connect teachers (from within these institutions and from schools) to these programmes in a way that ensures sufficient continuity and allows them to serve as sense-makers for the students, bridging theory and practice in the context of professional formation. Another key challenge appears to be recruiting the most experienced and advanced schoolteachers to serve part time in these programmes.\n\nThus, in one sense, history repeated itself. The previous teacher education reform was initiated before the results of the ongoing evaluation were clear, and the same thing happened in 2019. For those with the criticism of the 1946 School Commission in mind, it is worth considering what lies in the remarkably similar criticism of teacher education programmes. Obviously, these programmes have been profoundly reformed several times, yet several of the same issues persist. And recently the history of Swedish teacher education started a new chapter.\n\nThe Swedish parliamentary elections in September 2018 failed to produce a clear winner, and it took until January 2019 for a new government to be established. This was done through an agreement between the parties in power during the previous term (the Social Democrats and the Swedish Green Party) and two liberal parties (the Centre Party and the Liberal Party). The programme they agreed on for the mandate period included a reform of teacher education. It is most likely a clear indication of how politicized education is in Sweden, that issues like bans on the use of cell phones and application of the grading system in schools together with regulations of the number of instruction hours and content in teacher education programmes are part of political negotiations.\n\nAn early 2021 ministerial report suggested, in accordance with the agreement that helped establish a government after the election, a series of propositions under the heading of enhanced quality and an increased number of teachers.Footnote 127 The report, an outcome of the political agreement mentioned above, addressed teacher quality and teacher shortage issues but, according to the responses voiced in the open consultation process, the proposals failed in that effort.Footnote 128 A substantial strand of criticism focused on increased levels of detailed top-down governance as the report entails some formal propositions regarding the legislation and due to a proposals that require changes in the core content of these programmes. Several institutions reacted negatively to the notion that the political level engaged in discussions of content – let alone determine content – in these programmes. Another strand of criticism expressed profound concern over the fact that the report proposed a reduction of the number of semesters and credits required for the alternative route into teaching from three (90 ECTS) to two semesters (60 ECTS). A third strand of criticism pointed to the fact that the ambition to simplify the validation of prior knowledge and experience will result in lowered entrance requirements. In December 2021 governmental decisions was settled on all of those proposals and some came into effect already in January 2022, other will be implemented during in fall 2022 and during 2023.Footnote 129\n\nWe have above traced the outcome of the last two decades of evaluations, which on the one hand offers a picture of shortcomings in these programmes but on the other hand reveals both the continuation in critique and how that might lack a more sincere ambition to pay attention to outcome from evaluations. We have also briefly outlined the contours of political involvement in governing teacher education as an illustration of, or rather an indication of the conditions for, the local operation and advancement of these programmes. This issue is taken up again in the final section of this chapter, but some aspects of the teacher education programmes are discussed first.\n\n3.2.2 Quality in Terms of Students: Recruitment and Attractiveness of Programmes\n\nIs teacher education an attractive choice for a young person today? Is teacher education an attractive choice for a career changer, for someone with a higher education degree and extensive experience? Are enough students attracted to the profession – and are the right students attracted? Application patterns have been used to discuss teacher quality and the teacher shortage, which has recently become a central concern in Sweden. Media have depicted catastrophically low interest in the teaching profession by highlighting that a larger cohort of young individuals in Sweden applied for participation in Paradise Hotel, a famous television show on youth, relationships and sex, than for a teacher education programme.Footnote 130 The story goes that more than 10,000 applied for admittance to Paradise Hotel, a higher number than applications to teacher education. In, the same years as this story surfaced, 45,007 applications was submitted to teacher education programs in Sweden and among them, over 34,000 was qualified applicants and over 26,000 applicants had teacher education as their first choice.Footnote 131 Stories like this, despite being untrue, tend to stick, as “everyone knows” that no one wants to become teachers. This story aligns to a medialized picture of teacher educations as flawed programs and to the prevalent teacher shortage. It is true that there is a teacher shortage but that’s not the same thing as nobody wants to become teacher, shortage it is due to high demands.\n\nThe actual situation is that teacher education is the largest educational field in quantitative terms throughout Swedish higher education. In autumn 2020, over 42,000 people applied for a teacher education programme. Almost as many people applied for an engineering degree, and about half as many applied for degrees in nursing or social work, the other large professional programmes.Footnote 132 Of the applicants for the teacher education programmes in the autumn term of 2020, 33,000 were found qualified and 24,000 applicants had a teacher education programme as their first priority. The number of applicants has grown over the last decade but with some variations during the period, more than 18,000 people were admitted in fall 2020.Footnote 133 During fall 2019 and spring 2020, close to 10,000 students graduated.Footnote 134 Seven of ten students are women, a proportion that has been fairly stable in recent years.Footnote 135\n\nThe large number of applicants indicates broad interest in becoming a teacher. However, if the total number of applicants is compared with the number who applied for teacher education as their first priority, it is clear that teacher education is frequently seen as a secondary choice.Footnote 136 Of all the applicants to teacher education programmes, only over half applied for them as their first choice. The fact that the figures significantly have been improved since 2011 (+76%) have not yet washed away the mark as a second option program (Table 4.5).Footnote 137\n\nWithout other evidence, care should be taken in interpreting the fact that close to half of those applying for teacher education programmes did not make teaching their first choice. At the same time, that could be an indicator of how applicants view the attractiveness not only of working in schools and the teaching profession but also of teacher education as such. The attractiveness of teacher education will likely be determined not primarily by particular programmes but by perceptions of the professional role and school activities. The Swedish case shows a trend over time that students with stronger academic qualifications tend to favour programmes other than those oriented towards teaching.Footnote 138 It is also true that the profession’s so-called auto-reproduction is declining; fewer children of teachers are choosing to become teachers, which may indicate that the profession and/or the school as a workplace have declining appeal.Footnote 139 But other explanations may apply as well. Furthermore, there has been an increase in the proportion of students with a working-class background, and this proportion is larger in teacher education programmes than in higher education in general; about half the students in teacher education programmes have parents without any higher education themselves.Footnote 140 The notion of the trajectory is dual. On the one hand, it can be perceived that the teacher education field is exemplary in the sense that the programmes contribute to widening participation and to reducing social divisions in higher education. On the other, it cannot be ruled out that this development can also be understood as an expression of the declining prestige and appeal of teacher education programmes and the teaching profession.\n\n3.2.3 Do Teacher Programmes Have the Wrong Students?\n\nThe Swedish debate about teacher education programmes has, in addition to discussing the number of students, also addresses the quality of the students that do apply. Who can become a good teacher? What is a good student teacher? What are the characteristics of students with the best opportunities to develop into highly capable teachers? Questions of this type are not a particularly Swedish phenomena, but they relate in an important way to the question of whether it is really possible to be educated to become a teacher, which seems to be the underlying premise, an assumption that leans towards the idea that teaching involves qualities with which one is born rather than acquired through education.\n\nThe unique teaching qualities that some people obviously possess sometimes lead to the notion that teaching is all about innate talent. That this is not the case is quite clear from the fact that no human being is born with insights into either atomic physics or the history of antiquity, both areas that are included in school curricula; thus, a person must be educated in these fields to be able to teach them. As in other professions, there is also essential knowledge, both theoretical and practical, on how to practice the teaching profession. Just as we are not born with deep insights into theoretical physics, nobody takes their first breath with the extensive psychological, sociological and pedagogical theoretical insights that facilitate teaching and learning. In addition, the fact that individuals have different capacities to absorb theoretical insights indicates that deliberate education is important. However, the issue is more complicated, as premises are more likely to be orientated around ideas of teaching as a kind of performance technique rather than an deliberate execution of educational insights in a way that results in students’ development of knowledge.\n\nIt must be noted that the whole educational system is based on the idea that it is possible to learn new things and strengthen weak abilities and that this is best done through different methods which is usually referred to as teaching. Why central teaching abilities should be exempted from that indisputable fact is unclear. As in every other area of study, students vary in their personal qualities and prior knowledge, and some will fail and never obtain a degree, in teacher education as in other areas of study. The fact that individuals are different and have various levels of innate talents and abilities has already been noted in this chapter, but discussions about teacher education sometimes also become a question of whether the right individuals become teachers. The idea that educational shortcomings in schools mainly relate to teacher education having the wrong students is rather problematic. Of course, students with higher entry levels in some respects are to certain extent an advantage for a programme, but as a general model, the interpretation that teacher education admits the wrong students must be rejected. It is difficult to avoid the parallel in which schoolteachers explain low outcome levels in their schools by the quality of their pupils rather than their own teaching and how schools do – and do not – support struggling individuals.\n\n3.2.3.1 Student Teachers’ Grades\n\nThe Swedish press has recently reported that those who apply for teacher education programmes have poor secondary education qualifications. The daily morning newspaper with the largest circulation published an article entitled “Almost anyone can become a teacher”, which began as follows: “The status of teacher education is at its nadir. It is so easy to get into education that it is enough to write the entrance test without reading the questions”.Footnote 141\n\nThe article claims that just about “anyone” can enter these programmes. It is not easy to decide why so few journalists bother to check whether this is true: can one really get into a teacher programme without any qualifications whatsoever? The answer is of course negative. In order to be admitted to teacher education programmes, certain requirements must be met. According to the authority responsible for admission to higher education in Sweden (The Swedish Council for Higher Education), “for teacher education, the special eligibility requirements are often higher than the requirements for traditionally highly regarded education programmes”.Footnote 142 The claim that anyone can enter teacher education programmes is simply not correct; the requirements for admission are so high that many applicants are screened out, which reduces the competition among the remaining applicants and the number of “qualified” applicants appears artificially low. According to the admissions authority, it is impossible to say anything about teacher quality based on the results on entrance tests and it is therefore easy to get an inaccurate picture of the admitted students. Instead, it is something of a Catch-22: “the requirement for results on the entrance test is low due to the limited competition and due to the high requirements for special eligibility.”Footnote 143\n\nThus, a student cannot be admitted to a teacher education programme without having adequate grades in specified courses in secondary education that have been nationally identified as a guarantee of maintaining an “adequate level of requirements” for prospective teachers.Footnote 144 The entrance test, as an optional and alternative process, for gaining eligibility differs from the use of secondary school grades. Normally, student grades are translated to a numerical value between 0 and 20. According to a study, in the autumn term of 2015, the average grades of entering students in the various teacher education programmes were as follows:\n\nSubject teacher (secondary education) = 14.6\n\nVocational teacher = 14.2\n\nPrimary school teacher = 14.1\n\nPreschool teacher = 13.9Footnote 145\n\nThe figures above can be compared with the average values ​​for those beginning the programmes for physicians and psychologists (approximately 18), civil engineers and dentists (approximately 17) and nurses (15). The grading system has six steps and 15 represents a “C” on a scale where A (20p) is at top and F (0p) represents failing (Accordingly, there are grades E and D below C). On the one hand, an average of 14 are low but as on the other hand the number of students is high it is easy to make a misinterpretation about the number of well qualified applicants. The National Union of Teachers in Sweden, one of two teacher unions in the country, conducted an analysis and found that a higher number of students with top grades were admitted to teacher programmes than to programmes for prospective physicians, that is regarded as the most difficult to be admitted to.Footnote 146\n\nThe image of applicant qualifications is thus fragmented. The preceding section presented the media image that anyone can be accepted for teacher education, a view that has been shown to be inaccurate. On the one hand, the actual grade values ​​indicate that many applicants for teacher programmes have rather strong qualifications (for example, almost 20% of subject teacher programme entrants had grades above 17). At the same time, few beginners in the preschool teacher education had this level of qualification (only 6%). For comparison, those with a minimum grade of 17 generally constitute 30% of incoming higher education students.Footnote 147 On the other hand, the fact that the average grade of beginners in the teacher programmes is below 15 means that half of the students, despite the admission requirements, can be considered to hold insufficient levels of academic preparation. But that observation is far from the picture put forward in media that anyone can be admitted and that it is possible to qualify by completing entrance exams without reading the questions.\n\nThere is a certain logic in the argument that students’ entry-level scores are a problem, as it seems reasonable to assume that if students were at a higher level on entry, they might be at a higher level on graduation or at least have an easier time meeting the graduation requirements. Thus, the idea of improving teacher quality by recruiting stronger students is easy to understand but critically reflecting on the idea of solving educational problems by improving the quality of incoming students shows that it conflicts in a deep sense with a serious educational approach. Within an educational context, it is more appropriate to primarily explore how programmes and teaching could be redesigned into models that more powerfully accelerate student learning. It is profoundly alien to the very heart of the educational endeavour to first and foremost blame students for shortcomings in learning, as it is up to organizations, their leadership and their teachers to determine how they have to change to enable students to become successful.Footnote 148\n\nHowever, in this context, it is worth considering that studies indicate that new teachers’ cognitive and social abilities in Sweden have decreased over time. Grönqvist and Vlachos have demonstrated this shift, reporting a rapid and steep decline of entering teachers’ cognitive abilities from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.Footnote 149 The overall effect of teachers’ ability on their students’ academic outcomes was though surprisingly small; in fact it had a “negligible impact on average student achievement”.Footnote 150 In a comparative study of 30 countries’ school systems, Hanushek et al. (2018) found significantly stronger general links between teachers’ cognitive abilities and their pupils’ achievements.Footnote 151 Notably, this study showed that Swedish teachers’ abilities were actually slightly above the average in the 30 countries studied. However, Grönqvist and Vlachos reported another important finding; namely, that teachers with stronger social abilities showed a greater capability to reduce the gap between low- and high-performing students’ academic outcomes, while teachers, or at least male teachers, with stronger cognitive abilities tended to work in the opposite direction. So, students’ qualities do matter but not to the degree often assumed, neither in assumed way. Rather they can affect outcomes in surprising ways; finally, from a comparative perspective, Sweden’s educational problems do not appear to primarily be an issue of teachers’ cognitive abilities.\n\nIn summary, it is clearly the case that teacher education programmes do not attract the academically strongest candidates but within this group, the largest student body in academia, there are a large number of exceptional students. As stated above, the broader socioeconomic background profile of the students has also changed. The fact that future teachers are not recruited from the upper socioeconomic level of society is not necessarily an educational problem but may well be a political and social problem, if it is a problem at all: welcoming first-generation higher education students is hardly a negative attribute. The great challenge is to organize teachers’ education so that it prepares student teachers well, regardless of their backgrounds or previous qualifications, so that when they graduate, they can all teach at high levels. Then, for the purpose of teaching excellence, teachers’ continuing education must realize the idea of ​​lifelong learning in a structure that works for teachers. However, there are signs that teacher education programmes do have operational problems, to which we turn next.\n\n3.2.3.2 Dropouts from Teacher Education Programmes\n\nTeacher education programmes have also come for criticism due to the number of dropouts. From time to time, dropout rates have generated some alarmist headlines in the media like “Sky-high dropout from teacher education”.Footnote 152 In one newspaper, an interviewed student described how “everyone just dropped [out]. Lastly, we were only around five people attending”.Footnote 153 The picture that emerges is of programmes in crisis, which is often linked to the situation in schools. This section therefore takes a closer look at the teacher programme dropout situation and teachers leaving schools and the teaching profession.\n\nOn average, in Sweden about 20% of students leaves the 10 largest professional programmes before their second year. Medical students have the highest survival rates, with only 8% dro"
