Despite slight morphological differences between the nominal species, and the near-absence of differences in nuclear 18SrRNA (18S) and histone 3 (H3) loci, mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) confirmed species distinctness of all but V. mamillatus. The latter should be synonymised with V. contectus. The comparison of COI-based phylogeny with the earlier, allozyme- and morphology-based, phylogenies suggests that V. contectus and V. viviparus are the most distantly related, in the DNA tree V. acerosus is closer to V. contectus, while in the allozyme and morphology-based tree – to V. viviparus.\n\nREFERENCES(42)\n\nCITATIONS(6):"
