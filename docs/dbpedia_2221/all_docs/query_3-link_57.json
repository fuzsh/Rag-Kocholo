        "text": "Origin\n\nThe Finnish language (Finnish: suomi, suomen kieli) belongs to the Finno-Ugric language group, which split off from the other Uralic languages around 2000 to 3000 years ago.\n\nThe historical development of Finnish begins with its separation from Proto-Uralic, the common original language that also forms the basis for Hungarian and Estonian. The first written record of Finnish dates back to the 16th century, when the Reformation promoted the translation of religious texts into the vernacular languages. The translation of the Bible by the bishop and reformer Mikael Agricola in 1548 is considered the foundation stone of the modern Finnish written language and standardization.\n\nIn the 19th century, Finnish experienced a heyday as part of the national revival movement, which aimed to establish Finnish as a cultural language against the dominant Swedish. During this period, grammar and vocabulary were standardized. The literature produced during this phase still forms an important part of Finnish culture today.\n\nFinnish is characterized by its agglutinative structure, which means that the grammatical function of words is determined by the addition of affixes. It has an extensive system of cases, whereby nouns can take up to 15 different case endings. These structural features make Finnish particularly complex among European languages, but reflect its Uralic origins."
