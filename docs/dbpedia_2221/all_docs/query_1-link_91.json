        "text": "The Council for Educational Development at the Faculty of Science and Technology offers a free two-part course on ethics in science and engineering education for everyone with basic pedagogical education and / or solid teaching experience.\n\nIn the first part of the course, corresponding to one week of full-time studies, the basics of ethics as well as ethics in disciplines within Science and Technology are discussed. In the second part of the course, corresponding to one week of full-time studies, participants carry out a project that aims to integrate ethics into, for example, a teaching element in a course, an educational program, or a subject area. The project is presented orally as well as in a written report. The course is based on ethical theory and research literature in ethics, and related areas.\n\nCourse facts"
