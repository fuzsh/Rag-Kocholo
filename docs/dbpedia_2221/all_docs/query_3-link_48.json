        "text": "If you are asked to name the Scandinavian languages, the answer you will come up with is probably Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish, mainly because these three languages as well as countries are located on the Scandinavian Peninsula. However, only Swedish and Norwegian from the two belong to the North Germanic language family.\n\nThe third Scandinavian language is Danish because it is from the same language family and is similar to the other two (more similar to Norwegian than Swedish, but the reason will be explained below), and it is common for people from all three countries to be able to read and understand, to an extent, the other two languages without too much difficulty.\n\nThe Nordic languages, on the other hand, are spoken in the Nordic region and are the mentioned Scandinavian languages in addition to Icelandic, Faroese, Finnish, and Greenlandic. All these territories were once part of the Kalmar Union that lasted till 1523. They are all current members of the Nordic Council and, except for Greenland, feature the Nordic cross on their flags.\n\nDanish and Norwegian are very similar when it comes to vocabulary, which is due to Norway once being under Danish rule. The biggest difference lies in the spelling and pronunciation of words, as they are often the same and the meaning is almost the same as well, the spelling is just slightly different. While written Danish and Norwegian are similar, written Swedish contains words that the speakers of the other two languages can only understand if they already know them.\n\nRegarding pronunciation, American linguist Einar Haugen has famously said of the Scandinavian languages: ‘Norwegian is Danish spoken in Swedish’. This topic itself would require an additional article, but let’s move on this time.\n\nTo show why these three languages may seem similar, here are five commonly used phrases in each language below:\n\nMost European languages belong to the large Indo-European family of languages. Within the Indo-European family, there is a subfamily of closely related languages, called the North Germanic family, which includes all the Scandinavian languages. These North Germanic languages have an ancestor named Common Scandinavian.\n\nDuring the Viking period, Common Scandinavian was split into two parts. Facing the Atlantic Ocean were the West Scandinavian dialects, sometimes called Old Norse, where by the 12th century Old Norwegian dialect can be distinguished, and facing the Baltic Sea were the East Scandinavian dialects where after 1250 Old Swedish and Old Danish can be found.\n\nIt is important to note that, during the Viking period, the Old Scandinavian dialects did not have sharp boundaries. For example, Old Norwegian had characteristics from Old Swedish and vice versa. Major changes to Old Norwegian occurred when Norway came under the rule of the Danes and it ceased to exist as a written standard, but Old Danish and Old Swedish were greatly influenced by Middle Low German during the period of Hanseatic League.\n\nThe Danish and Swedish languages as we know them today originate from about the middle 16th century. Because of the Danish rule in Norway until the early 20th century, the written language was contemporary Danish. When the rule ended, this mixture of Danish and Norwegian was codified in a standard language that has two divisions. One is called Bokmål or ‘book language’, which is currently the standard of most Norwegian schools, while the other one is called Nynorsk or ‘new Norwegian’, which is basically a reconstruction of what the Old Norwegian might have been with much less outside influence.\n\nYes, Scandinavian languages are expensive when it comes to translation. This is mainly because of the high living standard in Scandinavian countries. They have, among other things, free education, free healthcare, and generous and guaranteed pension payments for retirees.\n\nAll of this is, of course, owing to taxes. Based on OECD data, the 2018 percentage of tax revenue of GDP was 44.9% in Denmark, 43.9% in Sweden, and 39.0% in Norway. That same year, personal income tax was 24.5% in Denmark, 22.4% in Sweden, and 20.0% in Norway.\n\nHowever, 2019 top statutory personal income tax rates were 57.2% in Sweden, 55.9% in Denmark, and 38.2% in Norway. If you take a look at the percentage taken from one’s income in Scandinavia, it should become clear as to why many professionals of all fields, including translation, ask for high rates.\n\nWhen talking about Scandinavian languages, we think of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark; Finnish is not a Scandinavian language because of different language families. The history of these languages is linked both in geographic and linguistic terms. As a result of one being conquered by the other, in the case of Norway and Denmark, some are linked more closely, thus sharing a range of similarities.\n\nConsidering that the purchasing power in Scandinavia is far greater than elsewhere in the world, despite high taxes, it is a favorable market for many companies.
