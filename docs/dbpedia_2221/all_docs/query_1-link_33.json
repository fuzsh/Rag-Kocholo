So thank you everyone, friends & family who called me, let me messages, wrote me social media or use any other means to contact me. It means I am still alive and you are too! 39e: an age when finally : - [ ] I donâ€™t care what men think about me. (I never cared much about what women thought about meâ€¦) - [ ] I feel I fully stepped into the age of the wise women with a dog: If he does not growl I will do it. - [ ] I enjoy my own company more than of others (can also be a byproduct of covid) - [ ] I know things that I known I forgot a long time ago I also enter the age of the heart ðŸ’œ: working on my own body/emotions/mind coherence as well as with my clients. The world is in chaos but inside is calm. It took me a while. I still face some decisions this year, I hope I will be wise enough to go into the direction of my heart and ignore the noises around. I hope to see everyone soon and hug and have a good laugh!"
