Finnish and Swedish are official languages and several additional languages, such as Inari, Northern, and Skolt Samí, hold special status. These languages have been spoken in Finland for centuries. Finland was part of Sweden for more than 600 years—all government and military business was conducted in Swedish—until Finland was lost to Russia in 1809.\n\nIt was widely believed that the two cultures, Finnish speaking and Swedish speaking, developed separately and peacefully with Swedish speakers living on the coast and Finnish speakers living inland. However, recent archeological evidence suggests that Swedish-speakers moved to coastal areas of Finland, likely beginning around 13th century, and settled among the Finnish speakers. The Finnish speakers did not move away, abandoning the coast to the Swedes. Instead, archeological evidence suggests that the Swedish language was adopted in these coastal communities by the Finnish speakers.\n\nSwedish Finns, or Finlandssvenskar as they refer to themselves, are part of a language minority with a distinct culture. Today in Finland they comprise 5.2% of its population and live in four areas—Ostrobothnia, Åboland, Åland, and Nyland. The Swedish spoken in Finland is mutually intelligible with the Swedish spoken in Sweden and has many distinct dialects with unique words and phrasing.\n\nDuring the period of the Great Migration many Swedish Finns emigrated to new countries. Emigration was far heavier in Ostrobothnia and Åland than in Åboland and Nyland, which were more industrialized and had more employment opportunities. Some communities lost over ten percent of their population to emigration.\n\nWhy “Swedish Finns?”\n\nPeople often challenge the phrasing of Swedish Finn. Here are the reasons we use this term:\n\nThe earliest Swedish Finn organizations used the the term Swedish Finnish such as Svensk-Finsk Nykterhetsförbundet av Amerika, the Swedish Finnish Baptist Mission, and Svensk-Finska Arbetareklubben i Seattle. Some Swedish Finn emigrants referred to themselves as Swedes but calling ourselves Swedes is inaccurate and leaves out the best part of the story. In Finland today, the Swedish speakers refer to themselves as Finlandssvenskar or Finland’s Swedes. This phrasing works well in Swedish but is awkward and clumsy in English. In the end we had to choose a name and we chose to follow the lead of our emigrant ancestors and use Swedish Finn. You can rest assured that we will never tell you what you should call yourself.\n\nWhere were the Swedish Finn settlements in North America?\n\nBritish Columbia\n\nNew Westminster, Rossland, Vancouver\n\nCalifornia\n\nBakersfield, Berkeley, Crescent City, Eureka, Fresno, Fort Bragg, Los Angeles, Reedley, San Francisco\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville, Telluride\n\nConnecticut\n\nBranford, Bridgeport, New Haven\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Worth, West Palm Beach\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago, Rockford, Waukegan\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston, Fitchburg, Gardener, North Chelmsford, Norwood, Quincy, Worcester\n\nMichigan\n\nAmassa, Baraga, Bessemer, Crystal Falls, Calumet, Detroit, Dollar Bay, Escanaba, Gladstone, Hancock, Iron Mountain, Felch, Ironwood, Manistique, Munising, Muskegon*, Negaunee, Norway, Otonagon, Ramsay, Sault Ste.
