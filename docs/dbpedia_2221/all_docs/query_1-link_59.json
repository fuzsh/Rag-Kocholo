        "text": "HST image of the face-on debris disk in the G2 dwarf, HD 107146 Planet formation occurs in circumstellar disks around young stars. Most of the gaseous content of those disks dissipates in less than 10 million years, leaving dusty debris disks that are detectable through reflect light at near-infrared and, to a lesser extent, optical wavelengths. The structure of those disks is affected by massive bodies (i.e. planets and asteroids), which, through dynamical interactions and resonances, can produce rings and asymmetries. Analysis of the rangle of morphological structure in these systems provides insight into the distribution of properties of planetary systems. HST currently provides almost the only means of achieving the high-contrast required for the detection of scattered light from these disks in the presence of the bright parent stars. While many such systems have been observed, only a relatively small number of disks have been imaged successfully at visual or near-infrared wavelengths. The present SNAPSHOT program aims to expand the sample by targetting sources within nearby star-forming regions that have past Spitzer observations that indicate a significant infra-red excess, suggesting the presence of a circumstellar disk.The Advanced Camera for Surveys will be used to obtain images in the V and I-bands (F606W and F814W filter), providing high resolution data that can be analysed for direct evidence of disks or companions. Hubble ultraviolet image of auroral activity near Jupiter's north magnetic pole Planetary aurorae are stimulated by the influx of charged particles from the Sun, which travel along magnetic field lines and funnel into the atmosphere near the magnetic poles. Aurorae therefore require that a planet has both a substantial atmosphere and a magnetic field. They are a common phenomenon on Earth, sometimes visible at magnetic latitudes more than 40 degrees from the pole, and have also been seen on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Jovian auroral activity is also affected by the Galilean satellites, which generate electric currents that can produce bright auroral spots (see figure), and, in some cases, have their own auroral storms. Hubble has monitored activity for more than two decades now, with a dedicated campaign during the International Heliosphysical Year (2007/2008) using the Advanced Camera for Surveys Solar Blind Channel. In 2011, NASA launched the JUpiter Near-polar Orbiter (JUNO) which will provide the first in situ measurements of Jupiter's magnetic field and polar magnetosphere since the Galileo satellite which actively monitored Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. Juno arrived at Jupiter on July 4th 2016 and entered a 53-day orbit. Hubble is obtaining a series of far-UV images using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). Those data complement the on-board instrumentation by providing global maps of auroral activity. Simulations of a nearby dwarf galaxy, a nearby giant galaxy and a distant giant galaxy; note that the last is similar in angular size to the dwarf, but has a much smoother brightness distribution (simulations from Ned Wright's ABC of distances The determination of the cosmic distance ccale remains one of the major goals of cosmological programs in the early 21st century. Achieving this goal requires reliable distance indicators. Type Ia supernovae have come to serve in that role at moderate to high redshifts, but the zeropoint of that scale still depends on local calibrators where more traditional distance indicators still play a major role. While observing programs continue to pursue conventional primary distance indicators (such as RR Lyraes and Cepheids) and secondary distance indicators (such as the RGB tip and the Tully-Fisher relation), attention is also being given to the method of surface brightness fluctuations. This method rests primarily on the hypothesis that the stellar populations in most galaxies have similar colour-magnitude diagrams. Thus, the total luminosity of the galaxy is generated by similar stars - mainly red giants. In a nearby low-luminosity galaxy, most of the light comes from a relatively small number of giant branch stars; consequently, that galaxy has a \"grainier\" appearance than a distant high-luminosity galaxy of the same apparent magnitude. The degree of granularity can therefore serve as a distance indicator. The present program will use the IR channel of Wide-Field Camera 3 (F110W filter) to observe 20 galaxies that have hosted type Ia supernovae, with the goal testing the consistency of the SN Ia luminosities in these relatively nearby systems."
