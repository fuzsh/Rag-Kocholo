        "text": "It’s my Birthday!🥳 And what could be a greater gift than being featured in a BOOK recently?😳 It’s a true honor to be one of the Faces of Luxembourg by LuXembourg - Let's Make It Happen and the project team including Beryl Koltz, Rick Tonizzo, Damien Roseren, Frédérique Buck + many more. Thank you! 📖The feature highlights a beautiful journey of so many different things: Not just my positive and creative spirit (some call me ”Happy go Lucky” and Peter Pan..) but also learning through tough challenges. It’s all definitely an outcome of passion and enjoying hard work but also being surrounded by my friends, family and network - special mention to University of Luxembourg Incubator and Entrepreneurship Programme and the Rethink your Clothes team. I’m so grateful to everyone for making my entrepreneurial endeavor possible. Thank you.🙏 .. OUR CHOICE as featured in the book is on an exciting path (more updates to come..). You’ll find our sneakers at Rue Genistre in #Luxembourg city with Letz Refashion and of course - always online at www.ourchoice.eco 👟 🇱🇺 If you're curious about the Faces of Luxembourg campaign and want to read all the full stories, the book is available at the Official LuXembourg Collection through several shops around the country and online: https://lnkd.in/dDCqpuA9. That said, I wish all of my network a summer full of rest, kindness and love ❤️ Yours truly, Flip cred for snapshots: Amanda Biver #circulareconomy #facesofluxembourg #entrepreneurship #sneakers\n\nHonestly - do you let others define how successful you are? Stop it. Success comes on your terms. Last week, I had the great pleasure of giving my workshop with insights on how to activate networking and entrepreneurial strategies to achieve the success YOU want - all according to your own personal values and happiness 🚀 I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the St George's International School, Luxembourg ASBL, Anne-Marie M. the organization and of course.. The students!!! Getting honest feedback from 14-16 year olds on the topic is something I truly appreciate and I find it incredibly meaningful to be able to spread some knowledge to the next generation of professionals in our #community. ...As we navigate the holiday season, I also want to extend warm wishes from myself and OUR CHOICE to our network. May these festive moments be filled with joy, reflection, and a sense of purpose. In 2024, I wish each of you a year of growth, and aligning your path of success with your personal values. Happy holidays and a happy New Year to all 💫🎄 Best, Filip #entrepreneurship #success #networking #education #Luxembourg\n\nEver let your emotions go shopping with your wallet?💸 (I've got a confession to make😅) I've been on \"shopping trips\" (with suitcases🤣) buying designer gear, then wearing the stuff once or twice, then tossing it.. Do I feel bad about it? Not anymore. I've accepted, learned, and decided on actions to do better. 🎭 So isn't shopping with emotion bad at the end of the day? No. Quite on the contrary -- It's natural and good if we aim for QUALITY pieces instead of fast fashion. If we aim for pieces we can LOVE❤️ for many years, emotions can be a strong, driving force in achieving a circular economy together. That is, if we outsmart and instead work with the evolutionary and cultural boundaries of our existence. ➡️ Last week I got to share more on this topic at the \"Plan your Purchase\"👗, a Plaidons Responsable event in collaboration with the Rethink your Clothes-team together with sustainable fashion consumption & ethics researcher Katia Dayan Vladimirova. I couldn't be more grateful for the feedback and love in the room PLUS #community learning going on in the room. THANK YOU everyone who attended! Anyone curious to dive deeper? That's what I'm here for! Shoot me a message AND check out coming events with Plaidons Responsable -- I hope to see you at the next one!👋 #fashionpsychology #psychology #fashion #circulareconomy #luxembourg OUR CHOICE\n\n\"Why did you choose the University of Luxembourg?\" ..is a question I've received a TON of times. So once and for all, and take it from Mikael Da Silva, Tahereh Pazouki, Ph.D, Antony Martini and myself: it's a great platform to kickstart any career you may want for your future ✅🚀 As members of the University of Luxembourg Alumni Network 🇱🇺 we all had the opportunity to present to and answer some brilliant questions about our career paths (Yes, I did share my story and brought some OUR CHOICE sneakers👟) from Luxembourgish and Greater Region high school student last week. ... My reflection more than \"oh it was great\"? Here it goes! When I saw how the younger generation is even more value-driven and focused on how to center their time around not just internships and professional activities, but extra-curricular activities to build resilience and health -- I'm even more proud to call myself an alumnus. Why? Because I know from my own experience that there are incredible professionals and associations working to support students around topics such as #mentalhealth, #lgbtq+ rights and many others. Studying can be A LOT, but in #Luxembourg there's a young, vibrant community that invites the students to shape not just a functional but enjoyable and stimulating setting for everyone. Also, where in the world would you be able to meet peers from 140+ nations in a day?!🌎 That said... I don't think studying at Uni.lu is \"just\" for younger people. I'd recommend you all to check out and get involved at any age, as I believe there's something for just everyone in the sphere of the Luxembourgish campuses. I'll def. see you around with Andy Adams, Liza Shliakhova Saad Shakeel and my friends from the Alumni crew! Thanks for another great event guys!! 🙏 #UniversityOfLuxembourg #community #career #entrepreneurship #alumniengagement\n\nTRICK QUESTION ALERT: What are two things that a traditional Swedish wedding, a stroll by the sea in Greece and an after work event in Luxembourg have got in common?🤯 One of the first sentences I phrased about my fashion start-up OUR CHOICE 👟turned out to be one of the most foundational ones. It was something I said without even thinking, off the top of my head... You know the kind of things you think and don't even realize it before you've said it out loud?😁 I blurted it out while having my third cup of coffee with a friend, browsing through fashion e-commerce sites with pop-ups and promotional codes all over: \"WHERE IS THE LOVE?💔 We need to return to a personal relationship with fashion items!\" ❌ Since then, it's been clear to me that I am NOT in the sneaker industry and I definitely don't want you to buy more sneakers. I am in the lifestyle industry and I want you to buy less but BETTER so that you can save money, time, have a sustainable IMPACT and to be honest.. Look a ton better! ...Because really, what are two things that a traditional Swedish wedding, a stroll by the sea in Greece and an after work in Luxembourg have got in common? The right answer is (drumroll): YOU and a pair of classic, comfortable and long lasting SNEAKERS that you can wear to all of the mentioned (and more) of the separate occasions and feel great in. ✅ A personal relationship with ONE pair of sneakers (or any quality fashion item) means that.. Not only can you grow to love and cherish your product over years and years (long lasting - remember?), but together you shape memories at different events and settings throughout your life, in style. See? Lifestyle! Here's where the LOVE in fashion is ❤️ and now that I shared my most significant (so far..) blurt: 📣 I'm excited to share that I'm part of the Circular Economy Expert duo speaking at the Plaidons Responsable After Work event \"Plan Your Purchase\" on the topic of smart wardrobe choices geared towards sustainable and conscious decision-making with Katia Dayan Vladimirova, senior lecturer and researcher at Université de Genève ♻️ ➡️ Join us for a discussion and after work drinks on November 8th🗓️, right before the 💀\"Black Friday\"💀 consumerism holiday. I dare promise, and you have my word, that the outcome of this event will save you more money than any Black Friday sale ever did 🤑💰 👉 Attending is FREE and you can register right here: https://lnkd.in/d53k7YF2 -- I hope to see you there!🇱🇺👋 #lifestyle #circulareconomy #circularfashion #community #entrepreneurship #blackfriday Rethink your Clothes Ana Luisa Teixeira Hannah Lam Elisabeth Adams\n\n”If people think you’re crazy, you’re probably onto something big”🕺💃 Last week I met bright young leaders at One Young World AND some amazing partnering companies.. Of those, Junk Kouture particularly stood out to me as the platform embodies a community of creativity and circular economy practices for 12-19 year olds globally 🌍 By upcycling - the craziest, coolest designs come to life 💥 and I was fortunate enough to see the stunning piece to our right when meeting Rory Kelly (behind the camera) together with Ebba Johansson from sponsoring partner Deloitte. I’ve not just been called crazy a few times myself but I’ve been privileged enough to be able to realize my own crazy idea (hint: crispy OUR CHOICE sneakers👟😁) It’s an incredible and fun experience that I recommend to everyone but importantly.. I believe that the realization of crazy ideas is an absolute prerequisite for a circular economy to happen. Congratulations to the team at Junk Kouture for being onto something big and scaling exactly that for the youth. And congratulations to all of us who got to enjoy your videos and designs over the #OYW23 week! ♻️🚀 #entrepreneurship #circulareconomy #sustainability #upcycling #iamflipwest"
