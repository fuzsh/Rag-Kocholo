My Swedish isnt hot, but i can probably make do or translate it. I have found very little information that i can use. I have also contacted the air defense attache at the embassy in hopes that perhaps they have some information. The proposal deals with loking the Swedish Air Force and domestic Swedish military aircraft production with regards to the neutral policy during the Cold War.",

        "text": "Thanks for the links, I am writing the museum to see if they have further info. The problem is i have to find \"scholarly\" info, ie published books, theses or journal articles to use, but the background info from the websites is very helpful!

I've played a little with the Danish public library \"search engine\". It also looks into research and special libraries. As here the Danish Air Force Library, which has the best collection of aviation books in Denmark. (And also catalouges magazine articles). I was a little surprised that so little was published on the subject - anyway - here goes:\n\nSwedish armed forces face up to the changing threat\n\nJoris Janssen Lok\n\nI: Jane's International Defense Review. - P. 43 - 49. - 1350-6226\n\nEmne: Flyvevåben ; Forsvar ; Sverige\n\nAn article on the Swedish armed forces, which soon wil have to take a step forward in technology as the emphasis swiches from classical defence to counter-rerroism.\n\nFlygvapnet 1926-2001\n\nRaymond Andersson, Kurt Karlsson, Anders Linnér\n\n2001. 144 p., illustreret\n\nForlag: s.n.\n\nSprog: Svensk\n\nEmne: Flytyper ; Organisation ; Materiel ; Opgaver ; Personel ; Historie ; Flyvevåben ; Sverige\n\nBeskriver Det svenske Flyvevåben i a.a. 75- års jubilæet\n\n(Swedish, 75 year anniversary)\n\nJaktpilot 1942 : upplevelser och tankar\n\nUlf J.

I have ordered one of those books through my uni library but i will try to get ahold of some of those others from online databases, thank you very much!!!\n\nThere really is suprisingly little published on the topic, which is good and bad, at least for me. It is good as I must prove in my proposal that the research will fill a much needed gap and has not been hashed over a million times, obviuosly not the case here! Its bad as there is little to start work with. Hopefully after the first year I'll get grant money to live in Sweden for a year or so to do some \"hands on\" research both in the archives and with the Swedish military. But in the meantime I'm fairly sure i can get this proposal written. I'll post it when its done, see what you guys think.\n\nA PhD student at Kings College in London has been looking at the Danish, Swiss and Swedish air forces in a compartive study and has had great success working with the respective forces, good news:)\n\nAgain, thank you everyone!\n\nPS www.gripen.com has a great sales video if anyone is interested, kinda funny CGI stuff in part of it;)\n\nNew\n\nAs a professional translator living in Sweden and a member of the SFF I may be able to help you if you get stuck on Swedish text. I can easily check for material that may be of assistance in the various libraries in Gothenburg too. MikeJ and myself are also discussing another trip to the RSwAF Museum in Linköping, this time to try to gain access to their restoration workshop (is anyone else interested in a trip?). Although that is a slightly different aim, if we do arrange such a trip you may wish to come along to talk to the Museum staff about your project. Last time we drove over from Gothenburg to Linköping and just one overnight stay was required by Mike. Using Ryanair kept his costs down.\n\nNew\n\nOoooh - thread carefully now - \"Burger\" (with the Swedish - Finnish “thing”). Now Denmark knew how to handle such a relationship - Christian the 2’nd and Stockholm and .... hmmm. ;) I’m digressing.\n\nAs someone (Bill Gunston, I’m sure!) pointed out. The Swedes could simply not afford failures on the British scale.\n\nDraken: Did the Lightning “job” with half the no. of engines.\n\nThey had vast experience in steam turbines and almost had an axial jet ready,“STAL”, flown under a Lancaster?, but it was cancelled. Sweden instead procedeed with the Avon.\n\nIn a fascinating feature in Air Enthusiast recently details of Swedish ELINT flights were revealed. Despite stated neutrality Sweden was clearly “blocking” the USSR and secretly cooperated with the “West”.\n\nGoing to the lenght of: “Should we develop nuclear weapons. And aircraft to carry them - eastbound?”\n\nWith the possible news of finding the Catalina that searched for the recovered ELINT C-47, here is a picture from a treasured book of mine: “Högt över Sverige” (ISBN 91-7486-462-9) full of breathtaking pictures. It is just a b&w snapshot from the German freighter, that rescued the shotdown crew. But have you otherwise noticed the quality of photography from SAAB (and the Swedish Air force) for many, many years. (Hasselblad and all that “jazz” - deeply envious me!)\n\nBest regards\n\nNew\n\nHoly Cow! you guys are great! Papa Lima, I will get back to in detail shortly. I will be in Europe all winter (scored a job as a ski instructor at the AFRC in Garmisch) so I could definelty make a few trips to Sweden on Ryanair or Easy Jet.\n\nWhen i was living in Stockholm i read an interesting article (in English) about new documents that are coming to light concerning Swedens cooperation with the West. There was quite a bit of training done with the Swedish Rangers and the British SBS on the east coast. Also all disperesed Swedish airfields (ie the entire roadway system!) is built to NATO specs, they switched to 5.56 round for small arms about the same time NATO did etc, they were some other points also, I'll have to find the article. Also, one of my profs used to be an ASW officer in the Swedish military for thirty years and took part in the famous hunt of the Whiskey class Soviet boats in the early 80's. When i asked him about joint exercises he told, though they \"supposedly\" trained with both NATO and Warsaw Pact countries, he remebers only one occasion where an exercise was conducted with the Soviets. He remeber literally hundreds with NATO forces. Evidently the Norwegian and Swedish Air Forces also worked in concert heavily, passing off Soviet aircraft to each other, as well as ships to the Danes.\n\nI am on my way to the library right now (two hours away) but will get back to everyone shortly. Thanks to everybody again! very much appreaicted!!!!!\n\nBTW great pics of the Tunnans! keep them coming! On a side note, while writing my thesis recently i discovered that the design utilized in the Tunnans engine placement is called the Rudet design, the only other aircraft to share this design is the MiG-9 Fargo. just a little trivia for ya!\n\nNew\n\nSweden did quite a lot of research into nuclear weapons. Saab actually had a design provisionally called Saab A36, which was a nuclear-capable bomber. The A36 (thankfully) wasn't proceeded with, as the Government decided against developing nuclear weapons.\n\nMore on the development of the Swedish R & D into Nuclear and Chemical weapons can be found in the book \"Svenska förintelsevapen, utvecklingen av kemiska och nukleära stridsmedel 1928-1970\" (Swedish Weapons of Mass Destruction The development of chemical and nuclear weapons 1928-1970), by Wilhelm Agrell. The ISBN code is 91-89442-49-0. The book was published in 2002 and is recommended. Don't know if there's an English edition, though.\n\nAnd Papa Lima, the DC-3 incident occured in June 1952. The DC-3 Fv 79001 which was lost has been recovered, while the Canso Fv 47002 has been located, but not recovered.\n\nRegards,\n\nJan\n\nNew"
