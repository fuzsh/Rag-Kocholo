        "meta_description": "Abstract. Snow conditions in the Northern Hemisphere are rapidly changing, and information on snow depth is critical for decision-making and other societal needs. Uncrewed or unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) can offer data resolutions of a few centimeters at a catchment-scale and thus provide a low-cost solution to bridge the gap between sparse manual probing and low-resolution satellite data. In this study, we present a series of snow depth measurements using different UAS platforms throughout the winter in the Finnish subarctic site Pallas, which has a heterogeneous landscape. We discuss the different platforms, the methods utilized, difficulties working in the harsh northern environment, and the UAS snow depth results compared to in situ measurements. Generally, all UASs produced spatially representative estimates of snow depth in open areas after reliable georeferencing by using the structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry technique. However, significant differences were observed in the accuracies produced by the different UASs compared to manual snow depth measurements, with overall root mean square errors (RMSEs) varying between 13.0 and 25.2âcm, depending on the UAS. Additionally, a reduction in accuracy was observed when moving from an open mire area to forest-covered areas. We demonstrate the potential of low-cost UASs to efficiently map snow surface conditions, and we give some recommendations on UAS platform selection and operation in a harsh subarctic environment with variable canopy cover.",

We study the spatiotemporal variability in snow depth and snow processes in a subarctic, boreal landscape using drones. We identified multiple theoretically known snow processes and interactions between snow and vegetation. The results highlight the applicability of the drones to be used for a detailed study of snow depth in multiple land cover types and snow–vegetation interactions.\n\nMire edge is not a marginal thing: Assessing the factors behind the formation, vegetation succession, and carbon balance of a subarctic fen margin\n\nTeemu Juselius-RajamÃ¤ki, Sanna Piilo, Susanna Salminen-Paatero, Emilia Tuomaala, Tarmo Virtanen, Atte Korhola, Anna Autio, Hannu Marttila, Pertti Ala-Aho, Annalea Lohila, and Minna VÃ¤liranta\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2102,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2102, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe vegetation can be used to infer the potential climate feedback of peatlands. New studies have shown recent expansion of peatlands but their plant community succession of has not been studied. Although generally described as dry bog-types, our results show that peatland margins in a subarctic fen initiated as wet fen with high methane emissions and shifted to dryer peatland types only after dryer post Little Ice Age climate. Thus, they have acted as a carbon source for most of their history.\n\nCitizen Science Applications for Water Quality Monitoring. A Review\n\nUmer Saleem, Ali Torabi Haghighi, BjÃ¶rn KlÃ¶ve, and Mourad Oussalah\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1170,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1170, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper discusses the impact of citizen science and remote sensing on water quality monitoring. It explores applications combining citizen science with tools like microwave and optical systems, assessing parameters and techniques via apps such as EyeOnWater and HydroColor. It highlights the transformative potential in addressing water quality research gaps.\n\nAdvances in Image-Based Estimation of Snow Hydrology Parameters: A Systematic Literature Review\n\nGetnet Demil, Ali Torabi Haghighi, BjÃ¶rn KlÃ¶ve, and Mourad Oussalah\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1158,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1158, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis review explores using advanced image-based methods to estimate snow parameters for water resource management. Deep learning and satellite imagery improve accuracy in predicting snowmelt and depth. Challenges like data availability persist; addressing them requires novel deep learning architectures and better data synchronization. Integration of image-based approaches can revolutionize snow hydrology modeling and environmental management.\n\nLandcover succession for recently drained lakes in permafrost on the Yamal peninsula, Western Siberia\n\nClemens von Baeckmann, Annett Bartsch, Helena Bergstedt, Aleksandra Efimova, Barbara Widhalm, Dorothee Ehrich, Timo Kumpula, Alexander Sokolov, and Svetlana Abdulmanova\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-699,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-699, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLakes are common features in Arctic permafrost areas. Landcover change following their drainage needs to be monitored since it has implications for ecology and the carbon cycle. Satellite data are key in this context. We compared a common vegetation index approach with a novel landcover monitoring scheme. Landcover information provides specifically information on wetland features. We also showed that the bioclimatic gradients play a significant role after drainage within the first 10 years.\n\nMulti-scale soil moisture data and process-based modeling reveal the importance of lateral groundwater flow in a subarctic catchment\n\nJari-Pekka Nousu, Kersti LeppÃ¤, Hannu Marttila, Pertti Ala-aho, Giulia Mazzotti, Terhikki Manninen, Mika Korkiakoski, Mika Aurela, Annalea Lohila, and Samuli Launiainen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-81,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-81, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript under review for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used hydrological models, field measurements and satellite-based data to study the soil moisture dynamics in a subarctic catchment. The role of groundwater was studied with different ways to model the groundwater dynamics, and via comparisons to the observational data. The choice of groundwater model was shown to have a strong impact, and representation of lateral flow was important to capture wet soil conditions. Our results provide insights for ecohydrological studies in boreal regions.\n\nSeasonal and interannual dissolved organic carbon transport process dynamics in a subarctic headwater catchment revealed by high-resolution measurements\n\nDanny Croghan, Pertti Ala-Aho, Jeffrey Welker, Kaisa-Riikka Mustonen, Kieran Khamis, David M. Hannah, Jussi Vuorenmaa, BjÃ¸rn KlÃ¸ve, and Hannu Marttila\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1055–1070, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1055-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1055-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from land into streams is changing due to climate change. We used a multi-year dataset of DOC and predictors of DOC in a subarctic stream to find out how transport of DOC varied between seasons and between years. We found that the way DOC is transported varied strongly seasonally, but year-to-year differences were less apparent. We conclude that the mechanisms of transport show a higher degree of interannual consistency than previously thought.\n\nModeling snowpack dynamics and surface energy budget in boreal and subarctic peatlands and forests\n\nJari-Pekka Nousu, Matthieu Lafaysse, Giulia Mazzotti, Pertti Ala-aho, Hannu Marttila, Bertrand Cluzet, Mika Aurela, Annalea Lohila, Pasi Kolari, Aaron Boone, Mathieu Fructus, and Samuli Launiainen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 231–263, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-231-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-231-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe snowpack has a major impact on the land surface energy budget. Accurate simulation of the snowpack energy budget is difficult, and studies that evaluate models against energy budget observations are rare. We compared predictions from well-known models with observations of energy budgets, snow depths and soil temperatures in Finland. Our study identified contrasting strengths and limitations for the models. These results can be used for choosing the right models depending on the use cases.\n\nMeasuring the spatiotemporal variability in snow depth in subarctic environments using UASs â Part 2: Snow processes and snowâcanopy interactions\n\nLeo-Juhani MeriÃ¶, Anssi Rauhala, Pertti Ala-aho, Anton Kuzmin, Pasi Korpelainen, Timo Kumpula, BjÃ¸rn KlÃ¸ve, and Hannu Marttila\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4363–4380, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4363-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4363-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInformation on seasonal snow cover is essential in understanding snow processes and operational forecasting. We study the spatiotemporal variability in snow depth and snow processes in a subarctic, boreal landscape using drones. We identified multiple theoretically known snow processes and interactions between snow and vegetation. The results highlight the applicability of the drones to be used for a detailed study of snow depth in multiple land cover types and snow–vegetation interactions.\n\nSnowmelt-mediated isotopic homogenization of shallow till soil\n\nFilip Muhic, Pertti Ala-Aho, Matthias Sprenger, BjÃ¶rn KlÃ¶ve, and Hannu Marttila\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-884,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-884, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnowmelt event governs the hydrological cycle of sub-arctic areas. In this study, we conducted a tracer experiment on a forested hilltop in Lapland, to identify how high-volume infiltration events modify the soil water storage. We found that a strong tracer signal remained in deeper soil layers after the experiment and over the winter, but it got fully displaced during the snowmelt. We propose a conceptual infiltration model that explains how the snowmelt homogenizes the soil water storage.\n\nPermafrost degradation at two monitored palsa mires in north-west Finland\n\nMariana Verdonen, Alexander StÃ¶rmer, Eliisa Lotsari, Pasi Korpelainen, Benjamin Burkhard, Alfred Colpaert, and Timo Kumpula\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1803–1819, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1803-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1803-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study revealed a stable and even decreasing thickness of thaw depth in peat mounds with perennially frozen cores, despite overall rapid permafrost degradation within 14 years. This means that measuring the thickness of the thawed layer – a commonly used method – is alone insufficient to assess the permafrost conditions in subarctic peatlands. The study showed that climate change is the main driver of these permafrost featuresâ decay, but its effect depends on the peatlandâs local conditions.\n\nUnderstanding variability in root zone storage capacity in boreal regions\n\nTanja de Boer-Euser, Leo-Juhani MeriÃ¶, and Hannu Marttila\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 125–138, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-125-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-125-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe root zone storage capacity (Sr) of the vegetation is an important hydrological parameter. This study used a relatively new method based on climate data to estimate Sr values in boreal regions, instead of using soil data. The study shows that the climate-derived Sr values are not only linked to climate, but can also be directly linked to vegetation characteristics, and that the (non-)coincidence of snow melt and potential evaporation can have a large influence on the derived Sr values.\n\nMonitoring Groundwater Storage Depletion Using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Data in the Semi-Arid Catchments\n\nNizar Abou Zaki, Ali Torabi Haghighi, Pekka M. Rossi, Mohammad J. Tourian, and BjÃ¸rn Klove\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2018-471,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2018-471, 2018\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGroundwater is considered a main source of fresh water in semi-arid climatic zones, especially for agricultural usage. This study compares in-situ groundwater volume variation measurements with GRACE derived water mass data. The study concludes the possibility of using GRACE data to monitor groundwater depletion in catchments that lack measured data. GRACE data can here help in drawing general conclusions for integrated water resources management, and sustainable usage of this resources.\n\nUsing isotopes to constrain water flux and age estimates in snow-influenced catchments using the STARR (Spatially distributed Tracer-Aided RainfallâRunoff) model\n\nPertti Ala-aho, Doerthe Tetzlaff, James P. McNamara, Hjalmar Laudon, and Chris Soulsby\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 5089–5110, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5089-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5089-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used the Spatially Distributed Tracer-Aided Rainfall-Runoff model (STARR) to simulate streamflows, stable water isotope ratios, snowpack dynamics, and water ages in three snow-influenced experimental catchments with exceptionally long and rich datasets. Our simulations reproduced the hydrological observations in all three catchments, suggested contrasting stream water age distributions between catchments, and demonstrated the importance of snow isotope processes in tracer-aided modelling.\n\nEstimation of temporal and spatial variations in groundwater recharge in unconfined sand aquifers using Scots pine inventories\n\nP. Ala-aho, P. M. Rossi, and B. KlÃ¸ve\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 1961–1976, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-1961-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-1961-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a novel simulation method for estimating spatially distributed and transient groundwater recharge in unconfined sandy aquifers. The approach uses field data for the most important parameters affecting groundwater recharge and accounts for parameter uncertainty. The results show that tree canopy cover is the most important factor in controlling groundwater recharge at our study area. Tree canopy is thinned by forestry, which may lead to a significant increase of groundwater recharge.\n\nQuantifying groundwater dependence of a sub-polar lake cluster in Finland using an isotope mass balance approach\n\nE. Isokangas, K. Rozanski, P. M. Rossi, A.-K. Ronkanen, and B. KlÃ¸ve\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 1247–1262, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-1247-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-1247-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn iterative isotope mass balance approach was used to quantify the groundwater dependence of 67 kettle lakes and ponds. A quantitative measure for the dependence of a lake on groundwater (G index) introduced in this study revealed generally large groundwater dependency among the lakes. The isotope mass balance approach proved to be especially useful when the groundwater reliance of lakes situated in a relatively small area with similar climatic conditions needs to be determined.\n\nA decision analysis framework for stakeholder involvement and learning in groundwater management\n\nT. P. Karjalainen, P. M. Rossi, P. Ala-aho, R. Eskelinen, K. Reinikainen, B. KlÃ¸ve, M. Pulido-Velazquez, and H. Yang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Herbert, Mark S. Raleigh, and Eric E. Small\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3495–3512, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3495-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3495-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAutomated stations measure snow properties at a single point but are frequently used to validate data that represent much larger areas. We use lidar snow depth data to see how often the mean snow depth surrounding a snow station is within 10 cm of the snow station depth at different scales. We found snow stations overrepresent the area-mean snow depth in ~ 50 % of cases, but the direction of bias at a site is temporally consistent, suggesting a site could be calibrated to the surrounding area.\n\nTower-based C-band radar measurements of an alpine snowpack\n\nIsis Brangers, Hans-Peter Marshall, Gabrielle De Lannoy, Devon Dunmire, Christian MÃ¤tzler, and Hans Lievens\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 3177–3193, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3177-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-3177-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo better understand the interactions between C-band radar waves and snow, a tower-based experiment was set up in the Idaho Rocky Mountains. The reflections were collected in the time domain to measure the backscatter profile from the various snowpack and ground surface layers. The results demonstrate that C-band radar is sensitive to seasonal patterns in snow accumulation but that changes in microstructure, stratigraphy and snow wetness may complicate satellite-based snow depth retrievals.\n\nMapping surface hoar from near-infrared texture in a laboratory\n\nJames Dillon, Christopher Donahue, Evan Schehrer, Karl Birkeland, and Kevin Hammonds\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2557–2582, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2557-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2557-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurface hoar crystals are snow grains that form when vapor deposits on a snow surface. They create a weak layer in the snowpack that can cause large avalanches to occur. Thus, determining when and where surface hoar forms is a lifesaving matter. Here, we developed a means of mapping surface hoar using remote-sensing technologies. We found that surface hoar displayed heightened texture, hence the variability of brightness. Using this, we created surface hoar maps with an accuracy upwards of 95 %.\n\nThermal infrared shadow-hiding in GOES-R ABI imagery: snow and forest temperature observations from the SnowEx 2020 Grand Mesa field campaign\n\nSteven J. Pestana, C. Chris Chickadel, and Jessica D. Lundquist\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2257–2276, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2257-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2257-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compared infrared images taken by GOES-R satellites of an area with snow and forests against surface temperature measurements taken on the ground, from an aircraft, and by another satellite. We found that GOES-R measured warmer temperatures than the other measurements, especially in areas with more forest and when the Sun was behind the satellite. From this work, we learned that the position of the Sun and surface features such as trees that can cast shadows impact GOES-R infrared images.\n\nTemperature-dominated spatiotemporal variability in snow phenology on the Tibetan Plateau from 2002 to 2022\n\nJiahui Xu, Yao Tang, Linxin Dong, Shujie Wang, Bailang Yu, Jianping Wu, Zhaojun Zheng, and Yan Huang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1817–1834, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1817-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1817-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding snow phenology (SP) and its possible feedback are important. We reveal spatiotemporal heterogeneous SP on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the mediating effects from meteorological, topographic, and environmental factors on it. The direct effects of meteorology on SP are much greater than the indirect effects. Topography indirectly effects SP, while vegetation directly effects SP. This study contributes to understanding past global warming and predicting future trends on the TP.\n\nSnow water equivalent retrieved from X- and dual Ku-band scatterometer measurements at SodankylÃ¤ using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method\n\nJinmei Pan, Michael Durand, Juha Lemmetyinen, Desheng Liu, and Jiancheng Shi\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1561–1578, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1561-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1561-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed an algorithm to estimate snow mass using X- and dual Ku-band radar, and tested it in a ground-based experiment. The algorithm, the Bayesian-based Algorithm for SWE Estimation (BASE) using active microwaves, achieved an RMSE of 30 mm for snow water equivalent. These results demonstrate the potential of radar, a highly promising sensor, to map snow mass at high spatial resolution.\n\nRetrieval of airborne Ku-Band SAR Using Forward Radiative Transfer Modeling to Estimate Snow Water Equivalent: The Trail Valley Creek 2018/19 Snow Experiment\n\nBenoit Montpetit, Joshua King, Julien Meloche, Chris Derksen, Paul Siqueira, J.

Using multiple radar sensors, we can decouple the soil from the snow contribution. We then retrieve the \"microwave snow grain size\" to characterize the interaction between the snow mass and the radar signal. This work supports future satellite mission development to retrieve snow mass information such as the future Canadian Terrestrial Snow Mass Mission.\n\nBayesian physicalâstatistical retrieval of snow water equivalent and snow depth from X- and Ku-band synthetic aperture radar â demonstration using airborne SnowSAr in SnowEx'17\n\nSiddharth Singh, Michael Durand, Edward Kim, and Ana P.

The water stored in it is measured by the snow water equivalent (SWE), the amount of water released after completely melting. We demonstrate a Bayesian physical–statistical framework to estimate SWE from airborne X- and Ku-band synthetic aperture radar backscatter measurements constrained by physical snow hydrology and radar models. We explored spatial resolutions and vertical structures that agree well with ground observations.\n\nSnow water equivalent retrieval over Idaho â Part 1: Using Sentinel-1 repeat-pass interferometry\n\nShadi Oveisgharan, Robert Zinke, Zachary Hoppinen, and Hans Peter Marshall\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 559–574, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-559-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-559-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe seasonal snowpack provides water resources to billions of people worldwide. Large-scale mapping of snow water equivalent (SWE) with high resolution is critical for many scientific and economics fields. In this work we used the radar remote sensing interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to estimate the SWE change between 2 d. The error in the estimated SWE change is less than 2 cm for in situ stations. Additionally, the retrieved SWE using InSAR is correlated with lidar snow depth.\n\nEvaluating L-band InSAR Snow Water Equivalent Retrievals with Repeat Ground-Penetrating Radar and Terrestrial Lidar Surveys in Northern Colorado\n\nRandall Bonnell, Daniel McGrath, Jack Tarricone, Hans-Peter Marshall, Ella Bump, Caroline Duncan, Stephanie Kampf, Yunling Lou, Alex Olsen-Mikitowicz, Megan Sears, Keith Williams, Lucas Zeller, and Yang Zheng\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-236,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-236, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow provides water for billions of people, but the amount of snow is difficult to detect remotely. During the 2020 and 2021 winters, a radar was flown over mountains in Colorado, USA to measure the amount of snow on the ground, while our team collected ground observations to test the radar technique’s capabilities. The technique yielded accurate measurements of the snowpack that had good correlation with ground measurements, making it a promising application for the upcoming NISAR satellite.\n\nPassive microwave remote-sensing-based high-resolution snow depth mapping for Western Himalayan zones using multifactor modeling approach\n\nDhiraj Kumar Singh, Srinivasarao Tanniru, Kamal Kant Singh, Harendra Singh Negi, and RAAJ Ramsankaran\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 451–474, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-451-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-451-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn situ techniques for snow depth (SD) measurement are not adequate to represent the spatiotemporal variability in SD in the Western Himalayan region. Therefore, this study focuses on the high-resolution mapping of daily snow depth in the Indian Western Himalayan region using passive microwave remote-sensing-based algorithms. Overall, the proposed multifactor SD models demonstrated substantial improvement compared to the operational products. However, there is a scope for further improvement.\n\nRetrieval of snow water equivalent from dual-frequency radar measurements: using time series to overcome the need for accurate a priori information\n\nMichael Durand, Joel T. Johnson, Jack Dechow, Leung Tsang, Firoz Borah, and Edward J. Kim\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 139–152, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-139-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeasonal snow accumulates each winter, storing water to release later in the year and modulating both water and energy cycles, but the amount of seasonal snow is one of the most poorly measured components of the global water cycle. Satellite concepts to monitor snow accumulation have been proposed but not selected. This paper shows that snow accumulation can be measured using radar, and that (contrary to previous studies) does not require highly accurate information about snow microstructure.\n\nSnow accumulation, albedo and melt patterns following road construction on permafrost, InuvikâTuktoyaktuk Highway, Canada\n\nJennika Hammar, Inge GrÃ¼nberg, Steven V. Kokelj, Jurjen van der Sluijs, and Julia Boike\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5357–5372, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5357-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5357-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRoads on permafrost have significant environmental effects. This study assessed the Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk Highway (ITH) in Canada and its impact on snow accumulation, albedo and snowmelt timing. Our findings revealed that snow accumulation increased by up to 36 m from the road, 12-day earlier snowmelt within 100 m due to reduced albedo, and altered snowmelt patterns in seemingly undisturbed areas. Remote sensing aids in understanding road impacts on permafrost.\n\nMeasuring the spatiotemporal variability in snow depth in subarctic environments using UASs â Part 2: Snow processes and snowâcanopy interactions\n\nLeo-Juhani MeriÃ¶, Anssi Rauhala, Pertti Ala-aho, Anton Kuzmin, Pasi Korpelainen, Timo Kumpula, BjÃ¸rn KlÃ¸ve, and Hannu Marttila\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4363–4380, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4363-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4363-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInformation on seasonal snow cover is essential in understanding snow processes and operational forecasting. We study the spatiotemporal variability in snow depth and snow processes in a subarctic, boreal landscape using drones. We identified multiple theoretically known snow processes and interactions between snow and vegetation. The results highlight the applicability of the drones to be used for a detailed study of snow depth in multiple land cover types and snow–vegetation interactions.\n\nEvaluating Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer (SMRT) model emissivities with 89 to 243 GHz observations of Arctic tundra snow\n\nKirsty Wivell, Stuart Fox, Melody Sandells, Chawn Harlow, Richard Essery, and Nick Rutter\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4325–4341, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4325-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4325-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite microwave observations improve weather forecasts, but to use these observations in the Arctic, snow emission must be known. This study uses airborne and in situ snow observations to validate emissivity simulations for two- and three-layer snowpacks at key frequencies for weather prediction. We assess the impact of thickness, grain size and density in key snow layers, which will help inform development of physical snow models that provide snow profile input to emissivity simulations.\n\nEvaluating the utility of active microwave observations as a snow mission concept using observing system simulation experiments\n\nEunsang Cho, Carrie M. Vuyovich, Sujay V. Kumar, Melissa L. Wrzesien, and Rhae Sung Kim\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3915–3931, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3915-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3915-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs a future snow mission concept, active microwave sensors have the potential to measure snow water equivalent (SWE) in deep snowpack and forested environments. We used a modeling and data assimilation approach (a so-called observing system simulation experiment) to quantify the usefulness of active microwave-based SWE retrievals over western Colorado. We found that active microwave sensors with a mature retrieval algorithm can improve SWE simulations by about 20 % in the mountainous domain.\n\nEvaluation of snow depth retrievals from ICESat-2 using airborne laser-scanning data\n\nCÃ©sar Deschamps-Berger, Simon Gascoin, David Shean, Hannah Besso, Ambroise Guiot, and Juan Ignacio LÃ³pez-Moreno\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2779–2792, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2779-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2779-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe estimation of the snow depth in mountains is hard, despite the importance of the snowpack for human societies and ecosystems. We measured the snow depth in mountains by comparing the elevation of points measured with snow from the high-precision altimetric satellite ICESat-2 to the elevation without snow from various sources. Snow depths derived only from ICESat-2 were too sparse, but using external airborne/satellite products results in spatially richer and sufficiently precise snow depths.\n\nHow do tradeoffs in satellite spatial and temporal resolution impact snow water equivalent reconstruction?\n\nEdward H. Bair, Jeff Dozier, Karl Rittger, Timbo Stillinger, William Kleiber, and Robert E. Davis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2629–2643, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2629-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2629-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo test the title question, three snow cover products were used in a snow model. Contrary to previous work, higher-spatial-resolution snow cover products only improved the model accuracy marginally. Conclusions are as follows: (1) snow cover and albedo from moderate-resolution sensors continue to provide accurate forcings and (2) finer spatial and temporal resolutions are the future for Earth observations, but existing moderate-resolution sensors still offer value.\n\nExploring the use of multi-source high-resolution satellite data for snow water equivalent reconstruction over mountainous catchments\n\nValentina Premier, Carlo Marin, Giacomo Bertoldi, Riccardo Barella, Claudia Notarnicola, and Lorenzo Bruzzone\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2387–2407, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2387-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2387-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe large amount of information regularly acquired by satellites can provide important information about SWE. We explore the use of multi-source satellite data, in situ observations, and a degree-day model to reconstruct daily SWE at 25 m. The results show spatial patterns that are consistent with the topographical features as well as with a reference product. Being able to also reproduce interannual variability, the method has great potential for hydrological and ecological applications.\n\nEstimating snow accumulation and ablation with L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)\n\nJack Tarricone, Ryan W. Webb, Hans-Peter Marshall, Anne W. Nolin, and Franz J. Meyer\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1997–2019, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1997-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1997-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMountain snowmelt provides water for billions of people across the globe. Despite its importance, we cannot currently measure the amount of water in mountain snowpacks from satellites. In this research, we test the ability of an experimental snow remote sensing technique from an airplane in preparation for the same sensor being launched on a future NASA satellite. We found that the method worked better than expected for estimating important snowpack properties.\n\nSimulation of Arctic snow microwave emission in surface-sensitive atmosphere channels\n\nMelody Sandells, Nick Rutter, Kirsty Wivell, Richard Essery, Stuart Fox, Chawn Harlow, Ghislain Picard, Alexandre Roy, Alain Royer, and Peter Toose\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-696,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-696, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite microwave observations are used for weather forecasting. In Arctic regions this is complicated by natural emission from the snow. By simulating airborne observations from in situ measurements of snow, this study shows how snow properties affect the signal within the atmosphere. Fresh snowfall between flights changed the airborne measurements. Good knowledge of snow layering and structure can be used to account for the effects of snow, and could unlock these data to improve forecasts.\n\nSnowmelt characterization from optical and synthetic-aperture radar observations in the La Joie Basin, British Columbia\n\nSara E. Darychuk, Joseph M. Shea, Brian Menounos, Anna Chesnokova, Georg Jost, and Frank Weber\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1457–1473, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1457-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1457-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and optical observations to map snowmelt timing and duration on the watershed scale. We found that Sentinel-1 SAR time series can be used to approximate snowmelt onset over diverse terrain and land cover types, and we present a low-cost workflow for SAR processing over large, mountainous regions. Our approach provides spatially distributed observations of the snowpack necessary for model calibration and can be used to monitor snowmelt in ungauged basins.\n\nTopographic and vegetation controls of the spatial distribution of snow depth in agro-forested environments by UAV lidar\n\nVasana Dharmadasa, Christophe Kinnard, and Michel BaraÃ«r\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1225–1246, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1225-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1225-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study highlights the successful usage of UAV lidar to monitor small-scale snow depth distribution. Our results show that underlying topography and wind redistribution of snow along forest edges govern the snow depth variability at agro-forested sites, while forest structure variability dominates snow depth variability in the coniferous environment. This emphasizes the importance of including and better representing these processes in physically based models for accurate snowpack estimates.\n\nTemporal stability of long-term satellite and reanalysis products to monitor snow cover trends\n\nRuben Urraca and Nadine Gobron\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 1023–1052, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1023-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-1023-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluate the fitness of some of the longest satellite (NOAA CDR, 1966–2020) and reanalysis (ERA5, 1950–2020; ERA5-Land, 1950–2020) products currently available to monitor the Northern Hemisphere snow cover trends using 527 stations as the reference. We found different artificial trends and stepwise discontinuities in all the products that hinder the accurate monitoring of snow trends, at least without bias correction. The study also provides updates on the snow cover trends during 1950–2020.\n\nTowards long-term records of rain-on-snow events across the Arctic from satellite data\n\nAnnett Bartsch, Helena Bergstedt, Georg Pointner, Xaver Muri, Kimmo Rautiainen, Leena LeppÃ¤nen, Kyle Joly, Aleksandr Sokolov, Pavel Orekhov, Dorothee Ehrich, and Eeva Mariatta Soininen\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 889–915, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-889-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-889-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRain-on-snow (ROS) events occur across many regions of the terrestrial Arctic in mid-winter. In extreme cases ice layers form which affect wildlife, vegetation and soils beyond the duration of the event. The fusion of multiple types of microwave satellite observations is suggested for the creation of a climate data record. Retrieval is most robust in the tundra biome, where records can be used to identify extremes and the results can be applied to impact studies at regional scale.\n\nImplementing spatially and temporally varying snow densities into the GlobSnow snow water equivalent retrieval\n\nPinja VenÃ¤lÃ¤inen, Kari Luojus, Colleen Mortimer, Juha Lemmetyinen, Jouni Pulliainen, Matias Takala, Mikko Moisander, and Lina Zschenderlein\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 719–736, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-719-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-719-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow water equivalent (SWE) is a valuable characteristic of snow cover. In this research, we improve the radiometer-based GlobSnow SWE retrieval methodology by implementing spatially and temporally varying snow densities into the retrieval procedure. In addition to improving the accuracy of SWE retrieval, varying snow densities were found to improve the magnitude and seasonal evolution of the Northern Hemisphere snow mass estimate compared to the baseline product.\n\nEvaluation of E3SM land model snow simulations over the western United States\n\nDalei Hao, Gautam Bisht, Karl Rittger, Timbo Stillinger, Edward Bair, Yu Gu, and L. Ruby Leung\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 673–697, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-673-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-673-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe comprehensively evaluated the snow simulations in E3SM land model over the western United States in terms of spatial patterns, temporal correlations, interannual variabilities, elevation gradients, and change with forest cover of snow properties and snow phenology. Our study underscores the need for diagnosing model biases and improving the model representations of snow properties and snow phenology in mountainous areas for more credible simulation and future projection of mountain snowpack.\n\nLandsat, MODIS, and VIIRS snow cover mapping algorithm performance as validated by airborne lidar datasets\n\nTimbo Stillinger, Karl Rittger, Mark S. Raleigh, Alex Michell, Robert E. Davis, and Edward H. Bair\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 567–590, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-567-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-567-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding global snow cover is critical for comprehending climate change and its impacts on the lives of billions of people. Satellites are the best way to monitor global snow cover, yet snow varies at a finer spatial resolution than most satellite images. We assessed subpixel snow mapping methods across a spectrum of conditions using airborne lidar. Spectral-unmixing methods outperformed older operational methods and are ready to to advance snow cover mapping at the global scale.\n\nSnow stratigraphy observations from Operation IceBridge surveys in Alaska using S and C band airborne ultra-wideband FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous wave) radar\n\nJilu Li, Fernando Rodriguez-Morales, Xavier Fettweis, Oluwanisola Ibikunle, Carl Leuschen, John Paden, Daniel Gomez-Garcia, and Emily Arnold\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 175–193, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-175-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-175-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlaskan glaciers' loss of ice mass contributes significantly to ocean surface rise. It is important to know how deeply and how much snow accumulates on these glaciers to comprehend and analyze the glacial mass loss process. We reported the observed seasonal snow depth distribution from our radar data taken in Alaska in 2018 and 2021, developed a method to estimate the annual snow accumulation rate at Mt. Wrangell caldera, and identified transition zones from wet-snow zones to ablation zones.\n\nBrief communication: A continuous formulation of microwave scattering from fresh snow to bubbly ice from first principles\n\nGhislain Picard, Henning LÃ¶we, and Christian MÃ¤tzler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3861–3866, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3861-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3861-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMicrowave satellite observations used to monitor the cryosphere require radiative transfer models for their interpretation. These models represent how microwaves are scattered by snow and ice. However no existing theory is suitable for all types of snow and ice found on Earth. We adapted a recently published generic scattering theory to snow and show how it may improve the representation of snows with intermediate densities (~500 kg/m3) and/or with coarse grains at high microwave frequencies.\n\nReview article: Global monitoring of snow water equivalent using high-frequency radar remote sensing\n\nLeung Tsang, Michael Durand, Chris Derksen, Ana P. Barros, Do-Hyuk Kang, Hans Lievens, Hans-Peter Marshall, Jiyue Zhu, Joel Johnson, Joshua King, Juha Lemmetyinen, Melody Sandells, Nick Rutter, Paul Siqueira, Anne Nolin, Batu Osmanoglu, Carrie Vuyovich, Edward Kim, Drew Taylor, Ioanna Merkouriadi, Ludovic Brucker, Mahdi Navari, Marie Dumont, Richard Kelly, Rhae Sung Kim, Tien-Hao Liao, Firoz Borah, and Xiaolan Xu\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3531–3573, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3531-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3531-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow water equivalent (SWE) is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles but is poorly observed globally. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements at X- and Ku-band can address this gap. This review serves to inform the broad snow research, monitoring, and application communities about the progress made in recent decades to move towards a new satellite mission capable of addressing the needs of the geoscience researchers and users.\n\nAutomated avalanche mapping from SPOT 6/7 satellite imagery with deep learning: results, evaluation, potential and limitations\n\nElisabeth D. Hafner, Patrick Barton, Rodrigo Caye Daudt, Jan Dirk Wegner, Konrad Schindler, and Yves BÃ¼hler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3517–3530, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3517-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3517-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKnowing where avalanches occur is very important information for several disciplines, for example avalanche warning, hazard zonation and risk management. Satellite imagery can provide such data systematically over large regions. In our work we propose a machine learning model to automate the time-consuming manual mapping. Additionally, we investigate expert agreement for manual avalanche mapping, showing that our network is equally as good as the experts in identifying avalanches.\n\nPotential of X-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar co-polar phase difference for arctic snow depth estimation\n\nJoÃ«lle Voglimacci-Stephanopoli, Anna Wendleder, Hugues Lantuit, Alexandre Langlois, Samuel Stettner, Andreas Schmitt, Jean-Pierre Dedieu, Achim Roth, and Alain Royer\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2163–2181, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2163-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2163-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in the state of the snowpack in the context of observed global warming must be considered to improve our understanding of the processes within the cryosphere. This study aims to characterize an arctic snowpack using the TerraSAR-X satellite. Using a high-spatial-resolution vegetation classification, we were able to quantify the variability in snow depth, as well as the topographic soil wetness index, which provided a better understanding of the electromagnetic wave–ground interaction.\n\nSnow water equivalent change mapping from slope-correlated synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) phase variations\n\nJayson Eppler, Bernhard Rabus, and Peter Morse\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1497–1521, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1497-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1497-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a new method for mapping changes in the snow water equivalent (SWE) of dry snow based on differences between time-repeated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. It correlates phase differences with variations in the topographic slope which allows the method to work without any \"reference\" targets within the imaged area and without having to numerically unwrap the spatial phase maps. This overcomes the key challenges faced in using SAR interferometry for SWE change mapping.\n\nSentinel-1 time series for mapping snow cover depletion and timing of snowmelt in Arctic periglacial environments: case study from Zackenberg and Kobbefjord, Greenland\n\nSebastian Buchelt, Kirstine Skov, Kerstin KrÃ¸ier Rasmussen, and Tobias Ullmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 625–646, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-625-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-625-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we present a threshold and a derivative approach using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar time series to capture the small-scale heterogeneity of snow cover (SC) and snowmelt. Thereby, we can identify start of runoff and end of SC as well as perennial snow and SC extent during melt with high spatiotemporal resolution. Hence, our approach could support monitoring of distribution patterns and hydrological cascading effects of SC from the catchment scale to pan-Arctic observations.\n\nSentinel-1 snow depth retrieval at sub-kilometer resolution over the European Alps\n\nHans Lievens, Isis Brangers, Hans-Peter Marshall, Tobias Jonas, Marc Olefs, and GabriÃ«lle De Lannoy\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 159–177, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-159-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-159-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow depth observations at high spatial resolution from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission are presented over the European Alps. The novel observations can improve our knowledge of seasonal snow mass in areas with complex topography, where satellite-based estimates are currently lacking, and benefit a number of applications including water resource management, flood forecasting, and numerical weather prediction.\n\nCharacterizing tundra snow sub-pixel variability to improve brightness temperature estimation in satellite SWE retrievals\n\nJulien Meloche, Alexandre Langlois, Nick Rutter, Alain Royer, Josh King, Branden Walker, Philip Marsh, and Evan J. Wilcox\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 87–101, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-87-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-87-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo estimate snow water equivalent from space, model predictions of the satellite measurement (brightness temperature in our case) have to be used. These models allow us to estimate snow properties from the brightness temperature by inverting the model. To improve SWE estimate, we proposed incorporating the variability of snow in these model as it has not been taken into account yet. A new parameter (coefficient of variation) is proposed because it improved simulation of brightness temperature.\n\nMapping liquid water content in snow at the millimeter scale: an intercomparison of mixed-phase optical property models using hyperspectral imaging and in situ measurements\n\nChristopher Donahue, S. McKenzie Skiles, and Kevin Hammonds\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 43–59, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-43-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-43-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe amount of water within a snowpack is important information for predicting snowmelt and wet-snow avalanches. From within a controlled laboratory, the optimal method for measuring liquid water content (LWC) at the snow surface or along a snow pit profile using near-infrared imagery was determined. As snow samples melted, multiple models to represent wet-snow reflectance were assessed against a more established LWC instrument. The best model represents snow as separate spheres of ice and water.\n\nBrief communication: Evaluation of the snow cover detection in the Copernicus High Resolution Snow & Ice Monitoring Service\n\nZacharie Barrou Dumont, Simon Gascoin, Olivier Hagolle, MichaÃ«l Ablain, RÃ©mi Jugier, Germain Salgues, Florence Marti, Aurore Dupuis, Marie Dumont, and Samuel Morin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 4975–4980, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4975-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4975-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSince 2020, the Copernicus High Resolution Snow & Ice Monitoring Service has distributed snow cover maps at 20 m resolution over Europe in near-real time. These products are derived from the Sentinel-2 Earth observation mission, with a revisit time of 5 d or less (cloud-permitting). Here we show the good accuracy of the snow detection over a wide range of regions in Europe, except in dense forest regions where the snow cover is hidden by the trees.\n\nEvaluation of snow extent time series derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer global area coverage data (1982â2018) in the Hindu Kush Himalayas\n\nXiaodan Wu, Kathrin Naegeli, Valentina Premier, Carlo Marin, Dujuan Ma, Jingping Wang, and Stefan Wunderle\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 4261–4279, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4261-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4261-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe performed a comprehensive accuracy assessment of an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer global area coverage snow-cover extent time series dataset for the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. The sensor-to-sensor consistency, the accuracy related to snow depth, elevations, land-cover types, slope, and aspects, and topographical variability were also explored. Our analysis shows an overall accuracy of 94 % in comparison with in situ station data, which is the same with MOD10A1 V006.\n\nDeriving Arctic 2 m air temperatures over snow and ice from satellite surface temperature measurements\n\nPia Nielsen-Englyst, Jacob L. HÃ¸yer, Kristine S. Madsen, Rasmus T. Tonboe, Gorm DybkjÃ¦r, and Sotirios Skarpalezos\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3035–3057, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3035-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3035-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Arctic region is responding heavily to climate change, and yet, the air temperature of Arctic ice-covered areas is heavily under-sampled when it comes to in situ measurements. This paper presents a method for estimating daily mean 2 m air temperatures (T2m) in the Arctic from satellite observations of skin temperature, providing spatially detailed observations of the Arctic. The satellite-derived T2m product covers clear-sky snow and ice surfaces in the Arctic for the period 2000–2009.\n\nImpact of dynamic snow density on GlobSnow snow water equivalent retrieval accuracy\n\nPinja VenÃ¤lÃ¤inen, Kari Luojus, Juha Lemmetyinen, Jouni Pulliainen, Mikko Moisander, and Matias Takala\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2969–2981, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2969-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2969-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInformation about snow water equivalent (SWE) is needed in many applications, including climate model evaluation and forecasting fresh water availability. Space-borne radiometer observations combined with ground snow depth measurements can be used to make global estimates of SWE. In this study, we investigate the possibility of using sparse snow density measurement in satellite-based SWE retrieval and show that using the snow density information in post-processing improves SWE estimations.\n\nThe retrieval of snow properties from SLSTR Sentinel-3 â Part 1: Method description and sensitivity study\n\nLinlu Mei, Vladimir Rozanov, Christine Pohl, Marco Vountas, and John P.

This is Part 2 of two companion papers and shows the results and validation. The paper performs the new retrieval algorithm on the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument and compares the retrieved snow properties with ground-based measurements, aircraft measurements and other satellite products.\n\nTree canopy and snow depth relationships at fine scales with terrestrial laser scanning\n\nAhmad Hojatimalekshah, Zachary Uhlmann, Nancy F. Glenn, Christopher A. Hiemstra, Christopher J. Tennant, Jake D. Graham, Lucas Spaete, Arthur Gelvin, Hans-Peter Marshall, James P. McNamara, and Josh Enterkine\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2187–2209, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2187-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2187-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe the relationships between snow depth, vegetation canopy, and local-scale processes during the snow accumulation period using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). In addition to topography and wind, our findings suggest the importance of fine-scale tree structure, species type, and distributions on snow depth. Snow depth increases from the canopy edge toward the open areas, but wind and topographic controls may affect this trend. TLS data are complementary to wide-area lidar surveys.\n\nSnow depth mapping with unpiloted aerial system lidar observations: a case study in Durham, New Hampshire, United States\n\nJennifer M. Jacobs, Adam G. Hunsaker, Franklin B. Sullivan, Michael Palace, Elizabeth A. Burakowski, Christina Herrick, and Eunsang Cho\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1485–1500, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1485-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1485-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis pilot study describes a proof of concept for using lidar on an unpiloted aerial vehicle to map shallow snowpack (< 20 cm) depth in open terrain and forests. The 1 m2 resolution snow depth map, generated by subtracting snow-off from snow-on lidar-derived digital terrain models, consistently had 0.5 to 1 cm precision in the field, with a considerable reduction in accuracy in the forest. Performance depends on the point cloud density and the ground surface variability and vegetation.\n\nMapping avalanches with satellites â evaluation of performance and completeness\n\nElisabeth D. Hafner, Frank Techel, Silvan Leinss, and Yves BÃ¼hler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 983–1004, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-983-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-983-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellites prove to be very valuable for documentation of large-scale avalanche periods. To test reliability and completeness, which has not been satisfactorily verified before, we attempt a full validation of avalanches mapped from two optical sensors and one radar sensor. Our results demonstrate the reliability of high-spatial-resolution optical data for avalanche mapping, the suitability of radar for mapping of larger avalanches and the unsuitability of medium-spatial-resolution optical data.\n\nEstimating fractional snow cover from passive microwave brightness temperature data using MODIS snow cover product over North America\n\nXiongxin Xiao, Shunlin Liang, Tao He, Daiqiang Wu, Congyuan Pei, and Jianya Gong\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 835–861, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-835-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-835-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDaily time series and full space-covered sub-pixel snow cover area data are urgently needed for climate and reanalysis studies. Due to the fact that observations from optical satellite sensors are affected by clouds, this study attempts to capture dynamic characteristics of snow cover at a fine spatiotemporal resolution (daily; 6.25 km) accurately by using passive microwave data. We demonstrate the potential to use the passive microwave and the MODIS data to map the fractional snow cover area.\n\nSnow depth time series retrieval by time-lapse photography: Finnish and Italian case studies\n\nMarco Bongio, Ali Nadir Arslan, Cemal Melih Tanis, and Carlo De Michele\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 369–387, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-369-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-369-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe capability of time-lapse photography to retrieve snow depth time series was tested. We demonstrated that this method can be efficiently used in three different case studies: two in the Italian Alps and one in a forested region of Finland, with an accuracy comparable to the most common methods such as ultrasonic sensors or manual measurements. We hope that this simple method based only on a camera and a graduated stake can enable snow depth measurements in dangerous and inaccessible sites.\n\nIntercomparison of photogrammetric platforms for spatially continuous snow depth mapping\n\nLucie A. Eberhard, Pascal Sirguey, Aubrey Miller, Mauro Marty, Konrad Schindler, Andreas Stoffel, and Yves BÃ¼hler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 69–94, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-69-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-69-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn spring 2018 in the alpine Dischma valley (Switzerland), we tested different industrial photogrammetric platforms for snow depth mapping. These platforms were high-resolution satellites, an airplane, unmanned aerial systems and a terrestrial system. Therefore, this study gives a general overview of the accuracy and precision of the different photogrammetric platforms available in space and on earth and their use for snow depth mapping.\n\nCited articles\n\nAdams, M.
