        "text": "This problem cannot be removed from context and social/historical nuance\n\nIt can depend, among other things on whether people are immigrants, or whether they are descendants of a landowning class of foreigners e.g. the Anglo Irish. (I have never heard anyone talk about the Irish English.) However the Polish Germans could presumably either be Poles who happen to live in Germany, but could also be part of the residue of landowning Germans who remain east of the Oder-Neisse Line in modern-day Poland. Similarly the Sudeten Germans in the Czech Republic. Naming is governed largely by historical convention, I would say.\n\nDo people say Irish Americans or the American Irish?\n\nThat too, seems to me as though it may depend on context. If, for example, I am giving a talk about hyphenated Americans, I would almost certainly say Irish Americans, African Americans, Italian Americans etc. But if I was speaking about, let's say, the Irish diaspora, I might talk about the American Irish, the Australian Irish, the UK Irish, the London Irish, the Liverpool Irish etc. (there are societies and sports teams named London Irish, London Scottish and London Welsh) So there is no certainty here.\n\nI don't know much about the circumstances of the Swedish families who live in Finland. But no doubt these sorts of issues could affect the way they are described, within a Scandinavian context, which may be quite different to that of the Anglosphere.\n\nMy advice would be to look to local nomenclature, and to use that.\n\nNeither is very apt, I feel.\n\nThere is no accepted term in English for this group of people, only a rather varied array of proposed terminology, including:\n\nFinland-Swede / Finland-Swedish\n\nFinland Swede / Finland Swedish\n\nFenno-Swede / Fenno-Swedish\n\nSwedish-speaking population of Finland / [no attributive form]\n\nSwedish-speaking Finns / [no attributive form]\n\nFinnish Swedes / Finnish Swedish (?)\n\nSwedes of Finland / [no attributive form]\n\n(I have never seen Swedish Finns before. It sounds rather like the reverse, i.e., the Finnish minority in Sweden—although, to be fair, the parallel Swedo-Finnish is given as a possible attributive form in the Wikipedia article linked to above. I’ve never seen that in actual use, either, though.)\n\nOf these, Fenno-Swedish and Finland Swedish are the only two terms with any currency used for the dialect of Swedish spoken by this group of speakers.\n\nFor the group themselves, however, you can basically take your pick. On English versions of [insert adjective of choice here] websites, I have most commonly seen Finland-Swede / Finland-Swedish and Fenno-Swede / Fenno-Swedish used, but this is purely anecdotal and from memory—I have no statistics whatsoever to back it up.\n\nOn a more personal level, Finland-Swede / Finland-Swedish gets my vote for being the direct translation of finlandssvensk, the term used in (Fenno-)Swedish by the group themselves. It is the term that, to me, comes closest to having the same ring to it as the Swedish word, describing Swedes/Swedish that just happens to be from Finland, rather than dually describing the group/language as being simultaneously Swedish and Finnish in identity.\n\nAs you suspected, the general American pattern is to use the nation of ethnic origin as the adjective, and the current nationality as the noun it modifies. Thus, we have Italian American, Nigerian American and so forth. So an American would generally call these people Swedish Finns.\n\nThis is probably related to the fact that the American philosophical expectation is that immigrants here will take American nationality as their new primary identity (and the ideal that they should be thereafter be treated as any other Americans).\n\nAs Americans we treat the idea of maintaining a primary identity separate from nationality with suspicion. (With that said, a reasonably cosmopolitan American would probably use whatever terminology a particular non-American group preferred.)\n\nThis question really has no clear answer to it since there is a a lot more to it than just the Swedish speaking population in Finland. The same problem exist in Sweden, also within the Swedish language.\n\nDifferent groups of people:\n\nNative Swedish speaking minority in Finland\n\nNative Finnish speaking minority in Sweden (there are actually quite a few of them, though they are often forgotten). Finnish is actually an official minority language in Sweden.\n\nFinnish speaking immigrants in Sweden, that have learned Swedish\n\nSwedish- & Finnish speaking kids to Finnish immigrants who has a cultural mix of Finland and Sweden.\n\nSwedish immigrants in Finland.\n\nFinnish immigrants in Sweden speaking only Finnish\n\nSwedish speaking Finns that have moved to Sweden.\n\nIt's a bilingual and nationalistic mess :) So whatever you call any of these groups, there will be misunderstandings. This lingual problem is a daily issue in Sweden and a constant subject of misunderstandings. And you cant do it one way in Finland and a different way in Sweden since daily business and culture are entwined in a way that its more like a unit than two separate contexts.\n\nSince Swedish and Finish culture are entwined with one another and Finland during long periods of history belonging to Sweden and large people moving back and fourth between the two countries for hundreds of years, the two countries and two peoples have very complicated relationships. So, how you refer to these groups can sometimes have quite an emotional value. Sometimes it can be a minefield, when speaking to the \"wrong person\", but most people in Sweden a Finland have a very natural and relaxed attitude about it. It´s mostly a constant subject of friendly bantering.\n\nFirst of all: This is a highly sensitive political and sociological issue in Finland, so thread lightly whichever terminology you choose.\n\nKeep in mind that there is also a Finnish minority in Sweden. Swedish Finn or Sweden-Finn would denote a Swedish citizen speaking Finnish, while Finland-Swede would be the term for the group you refer to.\n\nIn Swedish there is also a difference in terminology between the Finnish-speaking ethnic group, which would be called Finnar (\"Finns\"), and the nationality of all Finnish citizens, who would be called Finländare (\"Finlandian\"). Many Finland-Swedes have no problem being called Finländare but would enjoy being called a Finn about as much as a Scotsman would enjoy being called English."
