        "text": "About the language\n\nVill du tala svenska?\n\nSwedish is a Scandinavian language like Danish and Norwegian, and is also very similar to English and German. The Swedish alphabet is like the English one, but it has three extra letters – å, ä, and ö.\n\nSwedes love to use English words. Here are some English words and their Swedish equivalent. Have a go at matching them – it shouldn’t be too hard!\n\nEnglish: Email, job, exercise, booking, website Swedish: Jobb, websajt, mejl, motion, bokning\n\nBut it’s not always as easy as it looks! Now for something a little more difficult!\n\nMatching Exercise\n\nWant to speak a bit of Swedish?\n\nHere are a few words to get you started.\n\nWe’ve divided some of them into two groups: things you’d say to friends, and slightly more formal expressions.\n\nEnglish Swedish Informal Formal Hi! Tjena! Hej! How are you? Hur är läget? Hur mår du? I’m fine, thanks Bra, tack! Thank you Tackar! Tack så mycket What’s your name? Vad heter du? My name is … Jag heter … Bye! Vi ses! Hej då!\n\nHere’s a list of numbers one to ten, as well. You can see how similar they are to English:\n\nRead them while you listen.\n\nSwedish English Ett One Två Two Tre Three Fyra Four Fem Five Sex Six Sju Seven Åtta Eight Nio Nine Tio Ten\n\nThe days, too, are pretty much the same. Read them while you listen.\n\nSwedish English Måndag Monday Tisdag Tuesday Onsdag Wednesday Torsdag Thursday Fredag Friday Lördag Saturday Söndag Sunday\n\nLördag, the Swedish word for Saturday, means ‘washing day’ in old Swedish, as Saturday was the day which people used to wash themselves after the working week and before church on Sunday!\n\nSwedish is spoken not only in Sweden\n\nYou might not know this, but Swedish is actually the second official language of Finland. In fact…\n\n5.6% of Finland’s population speak Swedish as their mother tongue\n\nMost Swedish speakers live near the West coast or the capital of Finland, Helsinki (Helsingfors in Swedish)\n\nIn Helsinki and some other parts of Finland all the traffic signs are in both Finnish and Swedish\n\nEvery Finn learns Swedish at school\n\nThe island of Åland, a Finnish province, is situated in the Baltic between Finland and Sweden – people only speak Swedish there\n\nA student of Swedish can also choose to go and spend time studying in Finland, at Åbo Akademi, Finland’s Swedish university\n\nSwedish also opens doors to the whole of Scandinavia. Learning Swedish gives you easy access to learning both Danish and Norwegian, which are very close to Swedish. In terms of working life, many Nordic conferences use Swedish as the common language.\n\nFamous Swedish speaking Finns include Tove Jansson (the creator of the Moomin characters), Edith Södergran (poet) and Bo Carpelan (writer)."
