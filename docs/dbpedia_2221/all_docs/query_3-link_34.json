        "text": "Hey Christian, I think I might be able to help a bit because Korean, like Finnish is agglutinative and has more inflections than other languages I’ve seen. I’ve taken the Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK) practice tests (past ones) on my own, and I score around 65-75/100 on the reading and around 50-60/100 on the listening when I take it. Unfortunately, I can’t really check out the writing sections because I don’t know specifically how they would grade them. These tests supposedly correspond closely to the European framework, but the results that I have received would put me at a solid B2 in listening and closer to a C1 level in reading. I would imagine my writing score to be very low because I never do any formal writing, but I can communicate with friends over text without issues most of the time. If my word count is anything to go by, I’d assume that the known word count for a B2 level of communication would be quite high in Finnish as well. I don’t know how the number of Korean inflections compares to Finnish, but it seems much much higher than the number of inflections present in something like Japanese (very similar structures and language to Korean). Korean doesn’t inflect based on person (I’d imagine that Finish does?), but there are many many inflections for lowering or raising speech based on who is speaking and/or whom is being spoken to. Most of these don’t come up in 99% of everyday life, but they’re common in novels and tv programs (mostly historical ones and formal broadcasts). I am currently attending classes in Korea, and I can tell you that it is quite difficult to follow academic speech, and it’s certainly above me! For now… Unfortunately, I still have lots of trouble with more simple novels as well. I am doing Harry Potter currently, and the number of unknown words is higher than what would be comfortable for me to read without LingQ/dictionary dependence. Also, I still find forms of words like “good” that I haven’t run into yet on Lingq… so maybe that speaks to the high number of inflections in the language? hahaha There are forms of words that I’ve probably heard, read, or used hundreds of times that I just haven’t run into yet on LingQ. I imagine at 60,000 you will feel very comfortable in Finnish or another agglutinative language, but you’ll still be able to improve tons! Best of luck\n\nGotcha. Yeah I think I started taking iTalki Finnish lessons after 3-4 months of LingQ. I find it quite different to speak and to read since the spoken language differs quite a bit from the written language. But LingQ definitely has helped with speaking since I understand so much more! But the choice to start speaking can happen at any time whether you choose to do it earlier or later. But when you do, don’t be frustrated if you feel it’s different. It takes some getting used to just speaking the language. They use different cases and conjugations and things are a bit simplified and shortened as well as word choices are different.\n\nFinnish is not a minor language in Sweden and the languages are completely different so there’s not much of an advantage other than a few loan words here and there from Swedish and some similar expressions (not that many but there are some). Swedish is one of the official languages in Finland though but only about 5% speak Swedish there. How come you are learning Finnish?\n\nI want to live in Finland. The initial reason was cleaner air, but I have come to like the FInnish country and culture. It will still be about 2 and a half years (that is when I retire). By then I hope to speak Finnish understandably and also understand their Finnish.\n\nYou say Finnish is not a minor language in Sweden, but I remember reading that a small percentage of Swedes speak Finnish, and I also may have read about “acknowledging” the language. Will let you know if I find it.\n\nEDIT: I found the youtube video that mentions Finnish in Sweden as a minority language called “Meänkieli”. It is in The Finnish Language - YouTube at around 4:15 or such. Not sure whether this was where I first heard of it. And I realize it may not be officially recognized in Sweden. Just fyi."
