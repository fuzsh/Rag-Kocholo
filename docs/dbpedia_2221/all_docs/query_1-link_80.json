Introduction\n\nThe Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest Internet protocols and is currently specified in [RFC5905]. Since its original implementation, standardization, and deployment, a number of vulnerabilities have been found both in the NTP specification and in some of its implementations [NTP-VULN]. Some of these vulnerabilities allow for blind/off-path attacks, where an attacker can send forged packets to one or both NTP peers to achieve Denial of Service (DoS), time shifts, or other undesirable outcomes. Many of these attacks require the attacker to guess or know at least a target NTP association, typically identified by the tuple {srcaddr, srcport, dstaddr, dstport, keyid} (see Section 9.1 of [RFC5905]). Some of these parameters may be known or easily guessed.¶\n\nNTP can operate in several modes. Some of these modes rely on the ability of nodes to receive unsolicited packets and therefore require the use of the NTP well-known port (123). However, for modes where the use of a well-known port is not required, employing the NTP well-known port unnecessarily facilitates the ability of attackers to perform blind/off-path attacks (since knowledge of the port numbers is typically required for such attacks). A recent study [NIST-NTP] that analyzes the port numbers employed by NTP clients suggests that numerous NTP clients employ the NTP well-known port as their local port, or select predictable ephemeral port numbers, thus unnecessarily facilitating the ability of attackers to perform blind/off-path attacks against NTP.¶\n\nBCP 156 [RFC6056] already recommends the randomization of transport-protocol ephemeral ports. This document aligns NTP with the recommendation in BCP 156 [RFC6056] by formally updating [RFC5905] such that port randomization is employed for those NTP modes for which the use of the NTP well-known port is not needed.¶\n\n6. Security Considerations\n\nThe security implications of predictable numeric identifiers [PEARG-NUMERIC-IDS] (and of predictable transport-protocol port numbers [RFC6056] in particular) have been known for a long time now. However, the NTP specification has traditionally followed a pattern of employing common settings even when not strictly necessary, which at times has resulted in negative security and privacy implications (see, e.g., [NTP-DATA-MINIMIZATION]). The use of the NTP well-known port (123) for the srcport and dstport variables is not required for all operating modes. Such unnecessary usage comes at the expense of reducing the amount of work required for an attacker to successfully perform blind/off-path attacks against NTP. Therefore, this document formally updates [RFC5905], recommending the use of transport-protocol port randomization when use of the NTP well-known port is not required.¶\n\nThis issue has been assigned CVE-2019-11331 [VULN-REPORT] in the U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD).¶"
