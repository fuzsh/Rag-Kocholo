        "text": "Theories of party politics often make strong assumptions about the relationship between parties’ behavior and the preferences of intraparty actors. For example, scholars frequently assume that parties act as if they are unitary actors, and that the party leader represents the median preferences of the party’s membership. Despite substantial theoretical development and a number of detailed case studies, few cross-national analyses of intraparty politics consider the role of intraparty preferences.Footnote 1 This absence is striking. Intraparty politics and party preferences hold implications for a large range of political processes such as election campaigns, legislative politics and coalition governance.Footnote 2\n\nBuilding on these studies, we develop a theory of intraparty preferences and party leader selection by considering experiences in government and intraparty electoral rules. Broadly, we theorize that a party’s electoral context influences its internal preference diversity. We then argue that candidates’ statements of preferences influence their intraparty electoral success. Candidates who express preferences closer to the party’s ideological center attract more votes than more extreme candidates.\n\nTo empirically test hypotheses from our theory, we create a new dataset of intraparty actor preferences from their statements at party national congresses. By focusing on speeches at intraparty meetings, we begin to break open the black box of intraparty politics. Despite evidence that parties act as if they are internally divided in parliament, few studies seek to directly, quantitatively analyze actors’ preferences outside this arena.Footnote 3 Historically, intraparty actors’ preferences have proven complicated to measure. Limited data has created a major hurdle in testing theories of intraparty politics. Like recent research studying political documents,Footnote 4 we overcome this hurdle by using automated text analysis to measure the relative location of intraparty actors’ statements of preferences by analyzing their speeches at parties’ congresses. We apply the scaling method WORDFISH Footnote 5 to estimate actors’ ideological positions and the distance between actors within the party. This method allows us to compare actors’ relative statements of preferences across multiple political settings. We then use these estimates to study the relationship between intraparty disagreement and experiences in government and elections. In a second analysis, we predict party leadership elections at national congresses using the relative location of speakers’ preferences.\n\nThe results of our analysis are consistent with an explanation of intraparty politics that is focused on the party’s internal rules and electoral context. Likewise, the results indicate that our measures provide meaningful estimates of the location of intraparty actors’ preferences that can be adapted to fit numerous research goals. More broadly, we find evidence of a complex relationship between parties’ electoral performance, experiences in government and intraparty division.\n\nIn the following section, we discuss previous studies of intraparty politics and leadership selection before considering previous approaches to studying actors’ preferences. We then describe the role of party congresses in political party behavior and outline our empirically testable hypotheses that predict two dependent variables: intraparty division and party leadership selection. Following a discussion of our data collection and approach, we illustrate differences in parties’ disagreement over time and show how the positions of individual party actors are linked to leadership selections at the parties’ national congresses. The results from both sets of analyses provide important insights into the study of political party behavior and offer a new approach to help scholars understand and measure intraparty actors’ statements of preferences."
