        "text": "Rulers\n\nIndex Fa-Fl\n\nFabbri, Fabio (b. Oct. 15, 1933, Ciano d'Enza [now Canossa], Reggio Emilia province, Italy - d. Jan. 4, 2024), defense minister of Italy (1993-94). He was also minister without portfolio (regional affairs 1982-83; coordination of European Community policy 1986-87).\n\nFabela (Alfaro), Isidro (b. June 29, 1882, Atlacomulco, México state, Mexico - d. Aug. 12, 1964, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico), governor of México (1942-45). He was also Mexican minister to Argentina and Brazil (1916-18) and Paraguay and Uruguay (1917-18).\n\nFaber, Joseph (b. Oct. 15, 1862, Luxembourg, Luxembourg - d. Oct. 10, 1933, Luxembourg, Luxembourg), Luxembourg politician. He was minister of agriculture, commerce, industry, and labour (1917-18).\n\nFabiano\n\nFabiano, Emmanuel, foreign minister of Malawi (2017-19). He was also minister of education, science, and technology (2014-17).\n\nFabião, Carlos (Soares Alberto Idães) (b. Dec. 9, 1930, Lisbon, Portugal - d. April 2, 2006, Lisbon), governor of Portuguese Guinea (1974).\n\nFabien-Jean-Louis, Marie-Denise (b. Feb. 14, 1944, Gonaïves, Haiti), foreign minister of Haiti (1991).\n\nFabini (Bianchi), Juan P(edro) (b. Nov. 6, 1876, Montevideo, Uruguay - d. Oct. 3, 1962), chairman of the National Council of Administration of Uruguay (1931-33). He was also mayor of Montevideo (1943-47).\n\nFabiny, Teofil (b. Oct. 11, 1822, Pest [now part of Budapest], Hungary - d. March 4, 1908, Budapest), justice minister of Hungary (1886-89).\n\nFabinyi, Tihamér (b. Aug. 7, 1890, Hisnyóvíz, Hungary [now Chyzné, Slovakia] - d. June 11, 1953, Boston, Mass.), finance minister of Hungary (1935-38). He was also minister of commerce (1932-35) and director of the Hungarian General Credit Bank (1938-44).\n\nFabius\n\nFabius, Laurent (b. Aug. 20, 1946, Paris, France), prime minister of France (1984-86). A member of the Conseil d'État (1973-81), he was elected first deputy mayor of Grand-Quevilly in Seine-Maritime in 1977, and deputy in the National Assembly for Seine-Maritime in 1978. His membership in the Socialist Party (PS) dated from 1974. He rapidly rose to become one of François Mitterrand's most trusted economic advisers, as well as his principal private secretary when, as a member of the PS national secretariat from 1979, he became its press officer. He managed Mitterrand's presidential campaign in 1981 and was appointed minister-delegate for the budget in Pierre Mauroy's first government and then minister of industry and research in 1983. He was also president of the Regional Council of Haute-Normandie in 1981-82. At the beginning of 1984 his responsibilities were elevated to those of a superminister for industrial restructuring, in which capacity he was given the job of saving the Lorraine steel industry. Mitterrand chose Fabius to succeed Mauroy as premier (at 37, France's youngest up to that time) in July 1984. He served until he was defeated in a 1986 election. As National Assembly president in 1988-92, the suave Fabius led the biggest faction in the fractious party, fighting a bitter 1990 power struggle with Lionel Jospin and Michel Rocard which severely weakened the left. He was first secretary of the PS in 1992-93. Then his career was overshadowed by a scandal over AIDS-tainted blood transfusions while he was premier in 1985; he was acquitted of manslaughter and negligence charges in 1999. He was again president of the National Assembly in 1997-2000 and economy, finance, and industry minister in 2000-02. In 2006 he was a candidate in the Socialist primary for the 2007 presidential election, but came third. In 2012-16 he was foreign minister; in 2016 he became president of the Constitutional Council.\n\nFabra (Part), Alberto (b. April 6, 1964, Castellón de la Plana, Valencia, Spain), president of the Generalitat of Valencia (2011-15).\n\nFabre, Jean-Luc (Michel) (b. June 12, 1949, Aix-en-Provence, France), prefect of Guadeloupe (2009-11). He was also prefect of the French départements of Creuse (2009) and Indre-et-Loire (2011).\n\nFabre, Joseph Evariste (b. June 17, 1861, Montmeyan, Var, France - d. 19...), interim administrator of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon (1913-14).\n\nFabre, Louis (b. Oct. 5, 1885, Nouméa, New Caledonia - d. March 15, 1936), interim governor of Réunion (1932-34).\n\nFabre, Robert (b. Dec. 21, 1915, Villefranche-de-Rouergue, Aveyron, France - d. Dec. 23, 2006, Villefranche-de-Rouergue), French politician. He was founder and president (1972-78) of the Movement of the Left Radicals (MRG) and one of the three leading figures in the alliance of Socialists, Communists, and Radicals in the 1970s, though the least prominent. His hostility to the nationalization programme of Communist leader Georges Marchais led to the divorce between the Communists and the Socialist Party of François Mitterrand. In 1981 he backed Mitterrand's successful presidential bid. He was a deputy in the National Assembly from 1962 to 1981 and for 30 years (1953-83) was mayor of Villefranche-de-Rouergue, a small town in the centre west.\n\nFabres (Ríos), José Francisco (d. Aug. 25, 1930), finance minister (1896) and war and navy minister (1906-07) of Chile.\n\nFabrizzi, Fabio (b. Jan. 12, 1868 - d. Aug. 20, 1941, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), prefect of Alto Acre (1910).\n\nFabry, Jean (b. June 6, 1876, Villefranche-de-Rouergue, Aveyron, France - d. June 1, 1968, Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France), French war minister (1934, 1935-36). He was also minister of colonies (1924).\n\nFabvre, Jean Jacques Louis (b. Dec. 31, 1800, Saint-Jean-d'Angély, Charente-Inférieure [now Charente-Maritime], France - d. 1864, Brest, Finistère, France), provisional governor of Guadeloupe (1849).\n\nFacchinetti, Cipriano (b. Jan. 13, 1889, Campobasso, Italy - d. Feb. 18, 1952, Rome, Italy), war minister (1946-47) and defense minister (1947-48) of Italy.\n\nFacio\n\nFacio Segreda, Gonzalo J(usto) (b. March 28, 1918, San José, Costa Rica - d. Jan. 24, 2018, Escazú, Costa Rica), foreign minister of Costa Rica (1970-76, 1977-78). He was also president of the Legislative Assembly (1953-56) and ambassador to the United States (1956-58, 1962-66, 1990-94), Canada (1962-66), and Mexico (1998-2001).\n\nFack, Robbert (b. Jan. 1, 1917, Amsterdam, Netherlands - d. June 17, 2010, England), Dutch diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1970-74) and ambassador to the United Kingdom (1976-81).\n\nFacta\n\nFacta, Luigi (b. Nov. 16, 1861, Pinerolo, Piedmont, Italy - d. Nov. 5, 1930, Pinerolo), prime minister of Italy (1922). He entered the Chamber as Liberal deputy for Pinerolo in 1892. He was undersecretary of justice and then of the interior in Giovanni Giolitti's coalition cabinet of 1903-05. He became finance minister in the cabinet of Luigi Luzzatti of 1910-11 and in that of Giolitti of 1911-14. At the outbreak of World War I, he stood for Italian neutrality, like Giolitti, but he was afterwards proud of having given a son to his country. During the first six months of 1919 he was minister of justice under Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, and he was once more finance minister in the last Giolitti ministry in 1920-21. Facta formed his own cabinet in February 1922 but was defeated by an anti-Fascist coalition in July for not taking sufficiently strong action against Benito Mussolini's Fascists. No other politician was willing, however, to form a cabinet in a country so dangerously racked by industrial and socialist agitation and by Fascist terrorism, so King Vittorio Emanuele III asked Facta to form a second ministry. Heading a divided cabinet and lacking personal courage, he failed to take decisive action when the Fascists marched on Rome (October 28), even though the chief of staff and the military commandant of Rome were prepared to quell the impending insurrection. Pressured by Liberal leaders, Facta at the last moment proposed to proclaim a state of siege and order the army to protect the government. The king, however, refused to sign the decree, in order to avoid civil war. Facta was forced to resign in favour of Mussolini. He made no open opposition to Fascism, and Mussolini nominated him as senator in 1924.\n\nFadahunsi, Sir Joseph Odeleye (b. 1901, Ilesha [now in Osun state], Nigeria - d. May 12, 1986, Ilesha), governor of Western Region, Nigeria (1962-66); knighted 1963.\n\nFadden\n\nFadden, Sir Arthur William (b. April 13, 1895, Ingham, Queensland - d. April 21, 1973, Brisbane), prime minister of Australia (1941). In 1932 he agreed to stand as Country Party candidate for the seat of Kennedy at the elections to the Queensland Legislative Assembly. He was elected and became a severe critic of the Labor government. He entered the federal House of Representatives in 1936. In 1940, to resolve a deadlock between Sir Earle Page, John McEwen, and Archie Cameron, Fadden was elected acting leader of the Country Party. In 1941, he was confirmed as leader, having proved his ability to lead and humour men of considerable ability and ambition. As a member of the cabinet he held the position of minister for air and civil aviation (1940) and of treasurer (1940-41). Upon the resignation of Robert Gordon Menzies in 1941, Fadden served for 40 days as prime minister before his government was defeated and Labor took office. He served as leader of the opposition until 1943, when he was succeeded by Menzies. In 1949 Menzies became prime minister again and at once appointed Fadden treasurer and deputy prime minister. Fadden was knighted in 1951 and retired from politics in 1958. During his two periods as treasurer he introduced eleven budgets, the last nine consecutive ones charting Australia through a period of unprecedented growth, when he managed to combat with fair success the dangers first of worldwide inflation and then of an American recession.

He was chairman (1920-23) of the barbers' union before becoming a Social Democratic member of parliament in 1930 and served as minister for social affairs from 1937 to 1943. As leader of the Social Democrats, he was prime minister from 1948 to 1950, despite Communist opposition and accusations by the Soviet Union that he intended to undermine the Finnish-Soviet pact by taking Finland into NATO. During his second term, in 1956-57, he visited the Soviet Union, and relations appeared to have improved. After a period out of office he was reelected in August 1958 to head a coalition government against opposition from the Communists, who had become the largest party in parliament. In December 1958 he was forced to resign after the recall of the Soviet ambassador. Fagerholm was a candidate for the presidency in 1956, but he was narrowly defeated by Urho Kekkonen.

He was named minister of education in 1953 and established a system of public elementary and secondary education. In 1962 he was made minister of the interior and, in 1967, second deputy premier as well. In 1975 his half-brother Khalid, upon acceding the throne, named him crown prince. As an active administrator, he was virtual ruler during Khalid's reign (1975-82). He was a consistent advocate of modernization and established a corps of Western-trained technicians to oversee industrial diversification. He was also the principal architect of Saudi Arabian foreign policy in the 1970s and '80s that sought to counterbalance Soviet influence in the Middle East by providing financial aid to moderate states, notably Egypt. In a highly publicized 1977 trip he met with U.S. president Jimmy Carter to discuss peace in the Middle East and the Palestinian problem. He opposed the Camp David Accords (1978) between Israel and Egypt, and in 1980 he called for a jihad (holy war) against Israel following its annexation of East Jerusalem. In 1981, however, he announced an eight-point plan for a Middle East peace settlement that implied recognition of Israel's right to live within secure boundaries; the plan failed to gain Arab endorsement. In 1990, after Iraq's invasion of neighbouring Kuwait, Fahd reversed a long-standing policy and invited Western and Arab forces to deploy in Saudi Arabia in support of the Saudi defense forces. He suffered a stroke in 1995, and thereafter Crown Prince Abdullah assumed a de facto regency.\n\nFahd ibn Badr (ibn Abdul Aziz Al Saud), Saudi prince; grandson of Abdul Aziz.

During that trip, Sadat addressed the Israeli parliament and launched talks between Egypt and the Jewish state that led to the first peace treaty between an Arab state and Israel in 1979.\n\nN.

He spent three undistinguished years, from 1843 to 1846, in Algeria. In 1847 he was posted to Guadeloupe, where his reserved and prickly temperament and his strong Republican sympathies alienated both the colonists and his fellow officers, and he was recalled. He returned to Algeria in 1849 and assumed his first independent command; his work now won commendation, and after further service in Kabylie he was made chevalier of the Legion of Honour. In 1852 he was transferred to Senegal as deputy director of engineers. Two years later, he was promoted to the rank of major and appointed governor of Senegal. He encouraged experimental farming, founded Dakar, and built Médina on the upper Sénégal River as a base for further expansion inland. When he reassumed the governorship in 1863, after another tour of duty in Algeria, his principal objective was the extension of French power eastward. He left Senegal in 1865 and returned again to Algeria. Recalled to France after the outbreak of the Franco-German War, he was appointed commander in chief of the Army of the North in December 1870. In 1871 the three northern départements of Pas-de-Calais, Somme, and Nord all elected him to the National Assembly with overwhelming majorities, but he resigned almost immediately because of the assembly's anti-Republican proceedings. He was defeated in the senatorial elections of 1876 but was elected Republican senator for the Nord in 1879 and held the seat until 1888. As a final recognition of his services, he was made grand chancellor of the Legion of Honour in 1880.\n\nFaik, Nasir Ahmad, Afghan diplomat.

Her political career began in the 1940s when she was elected to the Hamilton city council, where she served for five years. Elected to the House of Commons on May 15, 1950, as a Progressive Conservative for the riding of Hamilton West, she was reelected in 1953, 1957, and 1958. Between 1950 and 1953 she was the only female MP. She introduced private member's bills for equal pay for work of equal value. She averaged 150 speeches a year in the House of Commons, focusing on housing, income tax, unemployment insurance, the post office, and the status of women. On formation of the Conservative government on June 21, 1957, she was sworn to the privy council and appointed secretary of state. On May 12, 1958, she was named minister for citizenship and immigration - the first woman appointed to the Canadian cabinet. During absences of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker from Ottawa she was acting prime minister, again the first woman to attain such a distinction. This happened despite a certain degree of animosity between the two. Fairclough summed it up in her 1995 autobiography Saturday's Child: Memoirs of Canada's First Female Cabinet Minister: \"John Diefenbaker did not like me.\" Diefenbaker didn't like her stances on some issues and she had never supported his leadership bid. She was named postmaster general in 1962 and was defeated in the 1963 election.

Active within the Centre Party (formerly the Agrarian Party) from his youth, he became its leader in 1971. He rapidly transformed and enlarged it by adopting a pro-environment and antinuclear platform that had considerable appeal. First elected to the Riksdag (parliament) in 1958, he lost his seat in 1964 but regained it in 1967. He served on several standing committees of the Riksdag and was a deputy member of the Nordic Council.

June 22, 1931, Loupillon, near Mézin), president of France (1906-13). He began his public career as town councillor at Nérac (1868), and in 1876 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for that town. Fallières stood staunchly for republicanism; he was one of the famous \"363\" who signed the May 18, 1877, protest against the dissolution decreed by Pres. Patrice Mac-Mahon and voted against the \"seize mai\" cabinet of Albert, duc de Broglie, on June 19, 1877. After holding a minor office in Jules Ferry's cabinet (1880-81), he attained cabinet rank in 1882 under Eugène Duclerc, and soon gave evidence of the strong hand which made him many enemies. He held the portfolios of interior (1882-83, 1887), worship (1882-83, 1890-92), public instruction and fine arts (1883-85, 1889-90), foreign affairs (interim, 1883), and justice (1887-88, 1890-92). On Jan. 29, 1883, he became premier. He resigned only three weeks later, however, after the Senate rejected his proposed compromise on the expulsion of royalist pretenders. He was elected to the Senate in June 1890 and became its president (1899-1906) before he was elected president of the republic with 449 votes against 371 for his nearest rival, Paul Doumer. As president he shed his partisan zeal; he confirmed the constitutional limitations of his office and at the same time exercised an influence that left it free of any charge of picturesque uselessness. He contributed to the consolidation of relations with the future allies of France, both by discreet advice to his ministers and through the series of visits he paid to foreign countries. He visited England in May 1908 and a little later joined King Edward and the Russian emperor at Reval; he received the latter at Cherbourg in 1909.\n\nFallin, Mary (Copeland), née Mary Newt Copeland (b.

After that, he became an adviser of the Hubei government and then the president's office. He started his career as a magistrate in Xinjiang province in 1917, being mayor of Aksu and then Dihua. In the 1920s, he was named the director of the Bureau of Military Affairs in Xinjiang, thus getting the chance to control some of Gov. Yang Zengxin's army.

He was elected to the Italian Constituent Assembly in 1946. In 1947-50 he was minister of labour and social security. After having served as minister of agriculture (1951-53) and of the interior (1953-54), he formed his own cabinet in January 1954; it fell at the end of the month. In July 1954 he was elected secretary-general of the Christian Democrat party, whose left wing he led. His party's victory in the 1958 elections allowed him to form another cabinet. As both premier and foreign minister, he visited many foreign capitals and gained Italy's election to the UN Security Council (Oct. 8, 1958). Attacked by the right wing of the Christian Democrat party, his government fell on Jan. 26, 1959, and on February 1 he resigned as party head. He returned as premier (1960-63) after widespread public reaction against increasing neofascist activity, and in 1962 he reshuffled his cabinet toward the left. He was foreign minister (1965, 1966-68) and president of the UN General Assembly (1965-66). He campaigned unsuccessfully for the national presidency in 1971 but did hold the office as caretaker in 1978 after the resignation of Giovanni Leone. In March 1972 he was appointed a life senator, one of five provided for in the constitution. In 1973-75, he was again Christian Democrat secretary-general. In 1974-75 he campaigned vigorously against the legalization of divorce, declaring that it could lead to lesbian marriages and affairs \"in which your wife could run away with your maid.\" His crusade failed and Italians approved divorce in a referendum. He was also president of the Senate (1968-73, 1976-82, 1985-87) and finally again interior minister (1987-88) and budget minister (1988-89).\n\nFang Benren (b. 1880, Huanggang, Hubei, China - d. Feb. 15, 1951, Tianjin, China), military governor of Jiangxi (1924-26) and chairman of the government of Hubei (1929). A graduate of the Beijing College of Commanders, he started his military career in the Jiangxi provincial army. He was named commander of the 11th Army as well as a member of the military committee of the National Government in 1926. He was also a member of the Military Senate. He stayed out of public life since World War II.\n\nFang Shengtao (b. Aug. 15, 1885, Fuzhou, Fujian, China - d. July 1, 1934, Shanghai, China), governor (1926-27) and chairman of the government (1930-32) of Fujian. He, like most revolutionary activists, joined the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance when abroad in Japan. He revolted in Sichuan province in 1911. After the founding of the republic, he became an army commander of a brigade and then of a division. He was also a commander of Sun Yat-sen's generalissimo residence garrison as well as commander-in-chief of the Fujian Revolutionary Army and chief of staff of the Guangdong Revolutionary Headquarters.

As a veteran of the Long March (1934-35), he was given various administrative posts in Communist-controlled regions. After the Communists came to power in 1949, he served as vice-governor of Fujian before being named vice-minister of finance in 1953. In 1956 he was sent to North Vietnam as foreign aid liaison and in the early 1960s was a vice-chairman of the State Planning Commission and director of an economic commission dealing with foreign countries. In 1971, having survived the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, he was once again called upon to handle China's economic relations with other nations, this time as minister. Fang's elevation to the Politburo in 1977 foreshadowed his 1978 appointment as vice-premier and head of the State Science and Technology Commission. During the January 1979 visit of Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping to the U.S., Fang negotiated important scientific and educational exchanges. He also concluded similar agreements with France, West Germany, and other countries. Though not trained as a scientist, Fang clearly understood the importance of both technology and basic research and impressed Western scientists with the range and depth of his comprehension. Fang, who was also president of China's Academy of Sciences, was named administrator of China's program to modernize its science and technology in 1979. He believed China could rival the West by the year 2000 if its Four Modernizations were well planned and carried out in progressive stages.\n\nFang Zhenwu (b.

He was commander of the 3rd Army, and later of the 4th Army Group, as well as commander of Jinan garrison before receiving the post in Anhui province. As a consequence of his dissatisfaction with Chiang Kai-shek, he was later detained and removed from office in October 1929. He was an organizer of the Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army (Chahar Army), being its commander of the North Route, fighting against Japanese invaders in the east of Chahar. However, forced by Chiang Kai-shek, who still wished to reach an agreement with Japan and to devote himself to the war against the Communist Party and its Red Army, he had to move to Hong Kong. He moved out as the Japanese occupied Hong Kong in 1941, but was assassinated by Kuomintang secret agents on his way back to Guangdong with crowds of refugees.\n\nFani, Cesare (b.

He was leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (2006-09, 2010-16). A member of the European Parliament from 1999, he used his seat famously to disparage European Union institutions and leaders, his central aim being the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU (\"Brexit\"). Under his leadership UKIP became a sufficient threat to the Conservative Party (which itself included many Euroskeptics) that Prime Minister David Cameron in 2013 pledged to hold a referendum on EU membership after the next election, leading to the actual decision in 2016 by a 52%-48% majority to leave. Saying \"my political ambition has been achieved,\" Farage then resigned as party leader. In 2018 he left UKIP, saying the party was now unrecognizable because of the \"fixation\" with anti-Muslim policies of leader Gerard Batten. In February 2019, with the Brexit process in difficulties, he supported the formation of a new \"Brexit Party,\" and became its leader in March, the same month British withdrawal originally was supposed to happen. But deadlock in Parliament necessitated a delay and thus British participation in the May elections to the European Parliament. In these Farage's party won 31% of the vote in Great Britain as Brexit supporters took the opportunity to express their discontent. After Boris Johnson succeeded Theresa May as prime minister and called new elections for December, Farage, after initially taking a combative stance, decided that his party would not contest Conservative-held seats, to avoid splitting the Leave vote; the party then crashed in the polls and ultimately did not win any seat. The party was renamed Reform UK in January 2021. He stepped down as leader in March 2021, but returned to the position in June 2024 and led it to become the third-strongest party in terms of votes (14%) in the parliamentary elections in July; he was one of 5 Reform MPs elected.\n\nFarah, Abdulrahim Abby (b.

May 2, 2007, Kabul, Afghanistan), prime minister of Afghanistan (1992). He was prime minister for just over a month as the civil war erupted between the commanders of groups that had recently overthrown the Communist government.

June 9, 1976, New York City), U.S. politician. In Stony Point, near his native town, he served as township clerk for three terms (1912-19). His marked political abilities caused him to rise in the Democratic Party ranks, and in 1918, in reward for campaign services that year, he was appointed by Gov. Alfred E. Smith to the post of warden of the port of New York, a job that was abolished the next year. During the 1920s, he served as chairman of the Rockland County Democratic Committee. He served one term in the legislature (1923-24). In 1928 he became secretary of the New York State Democratic Committee and organized Franklin D. Roosevelt's successful gubernatorial campaign. He ran Roosevelt's reelection campaign in 1930, the year he also became chairman of the state committee. Convinced that Roosevelt could win the party's presidential nomination in 1932, Farley travelled the country in his behalf. At the convention, he arranged the deal whereby John N. Garner of Texas received the vice-presidential nomination in return for support of Roosevelt by the Texas and California delegations. As the newly appointed chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Farley directed the 1932 campaign and was rewarded with a cabinet appointment as postmaster general. He repeated his masterful campaign direction in 1936, but a rift between Farley and Roosevelt gradually developed. In 1940 Farley resigned from the cabinet and, because of his opposition to Roosevelt's third-term bid, allowed his own name to go before the convention that year. In 1944, as chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee, he again opposed Roosevelt's reelection bid. Farley then dropped out of politics.\n\nFarmer\n\nFarmer, John J., Jr. (b.

He was ambassador to Sweden (also non-resident ambassador to Norway, Denmark, and Finland) in the early 1950s. In 1955, he was appointed ambassador to West Germany and in 1956, ambassador to the U.S.S.R. (also non-resident ambassador to Poland). In 1958, Syria and Egypt merged to form the United Arab Republic (U.A.R.) and he became U.A.R. ambassador to Brazil, holding office until Syria separated again in 1961.

May 11, 1933, Bronx, New York City), leader of the Nation of Islam (1978- ). In 1955 he converted from the Episcopal Church to the Nation of Islam, also called Black Muslims, the unorthodox form of Islam led by Elijah Muhammad. He rose quickly in the movement, recording an original song \"A White Man's Heaven is a Black Man's Hell,\" and writing two plays that were performed in mosques. He assisted Malcolm X at his mosque in Boston, became minister there when Malcolm moved to New York City, and, when Malcolm converted to Sunni Islam, Farrakhan denounced and replaced him as minister of Mosque Number Seven in Harlem, New York City. After Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, his son W.D. Muhammad succeeded him as the principal imam, or leader, of the Nation of Islam and altered the organization's course by gradually integrating the estimated 50,000-member Nation into the orthodox Muslim community. In 1978, however, Farrakhan formed his own sect, which he again called the Nation of Islam and which continued or revived features of its predecessor. He preached the inherent wickedness of whites, particularly Jews; blamed the U.S. government for what he claimed was a conspiracy to destroy black people with AIDS and addictive drugs; and, beginning in the late 1980s, cultivated a relationship with the Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi. In 1995, he rose to the height of his influence as the most prominent organizer of the \"Million Man March\" of African-American men in Washington, D.C. At the gathering, several hundred thousand participants affirmed African-American unity and pledged dedication to family values.\n\nFarrar, Frank (Leroy) (b. April 2, 1929, Britton, S.D. - d.

Oct. 31, 1980, Buenos Aires), Argentine politician. He was an army general who became minister of war and then vice-president under Gen. Pedro Pablo Ramírez. When the latter resigned under pressure, Farrell became president of Argentina. In that capacity (1944-46), he took a historic step when, under pressure from the U.S., he declared war on Germany and Japan during World War II. On June 4, 1946, Juan D. Perón, Farrell's labour minister, was elected president and Farrell retired from public life.\n\nFarrell, Norm, New Zealand diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1968-69) and ambassador to South Vietnam and the Khmer Republic (1974-75).\n\nFarrelly\n\nFarrelly, Alexander A(nthony) (b. Dec. 29, 1923, Frederiksted, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands - d. Sept. 10, 2002, Arlington, Va., U.S.), governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands (1987-95). He was a Caribbean specialist at the United Nations, returned to the territory in 1962 to become an assistant U.S. attorney, and was named a judge of the Municipal Court of the Virgin Islands in 1965 by Gov. Ralph Paiewonsky. In 1966, he was invited by the Unity Democrats to run on their senatorial slate. Running as an at-large candidate for the 7th Legislature, he amassed 7,324 votes, at the time the most ever received by an elected official in the territory. He was returned to the 8th Legislature as a Democratic senator representing St. Thomas-St. John. He was the Democratic candidate in the first election of a Virgin Islands governor, in 1970, losing to Republican Melvin H. Evans. Four years later, he ran again, losing in the runoff to Independent Citizens Movement candidate Cyril E. King. He was elected a Democratic national committeeman for the Virgin Islands in 1976, a position he held until 1998. In 1986 he became the first Democrat to be elected governor. He spearheaded the effort to purchase The West Indian Co. from Danish interests that had owned it from the days before the territory was acquired by the United States from Denmark. The acquisition gave the Virgin Islands control of the cruise ship dock in Havensight and provided future chief executives with a new official residence, on Denmark Hill. His final days in office were mired in controversy as he issued several controversial pardons, including one for Raphael Joseph, one of the men serving multiple life terms in mainland prisons for the 1972 murder of eight people in the \"Fountain Valley massacre\" on St. Croix.\n\nFarrington, Wallace R(ider) (b. May 3, 1871, Orono, Maine - d. Oct. 6, 1933, Honolulu, Hawaii), governor of Hawaii (1921-29).\n\nFarrugia, Michael, home affairs and national security minister of Malta (2017-20).

Feb. 11, 1920, Cairo, Egypt - d. March 18, 1965, Rome, Italy), king of Egypt (1936-52). Faruq, the son and successor of King Fuad I, continued his father's rivalry with the popular-based Wafd party, with which he clashed over many issues, including administrative functions, appointments, and even the form used for his coronation. He was largely able to keep the Wafd out of power. After the outbreak of World War II, Faruq tried to maintain neutrality, despite the presence of British troops in Egypt, but in 1942 the British forced him to name as prime minister the Wafd leader Mustafa an-Nahhas Pasha, who was sympathetic to their interests. In October 1944 an-Nahhas negotiated the Alexandria Protocol, a step toward the creation of a league of Arab states. Faruq wanted to place himself at the head of this movement, and he dismissed an-Nahhas, who had lost the support of the British. Egyptian nationalism suffered from a shattering defeat at the hands of the newly created state of Israel (1948) and from the failure to terminate British military occupation of Egypt. The military defeat especially enraged many Egyptian army officers, who saw Faruq's corruption and incompetence as being largely the cause of it. His activities became intolerable in 1952, and the Free Officers, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, overthrew his regime in July and forced him to abdicate. He was succeeded by his infant son, Fuad II, but less than a year later Egypt became a republic.\n\nFaruque (Khan), Ghulam (b.

Dec. 14, 1994, Conway, Ark.), governor of Arkansas (1955-67). He was a southern populist who supported New Deal policies. After his election as governor, he appointed six black men to the Democratic State Committee, a move that triggered a charge during his 1956 reelection campaign that he was \"soft\" on racism. In 1957 - after the entire Arkansas legislature signed the Southern Manifesto, which attacked the Supreme Court's desegregation law as \"naked judicial power\" - Faubus determined that his political survival depended on stopping desegregation. He called out the Arkansas National Guard to \"prevent violence\" by blocking the access of nine black students to Little Rock Central High School; his action was countered by Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who mobilized 1,200 U.S. Army paratroopers to usher the students into the school.

He was premier for 40 days in 1952 and for 11 months in 1955-56. Then came the collapse of the Fourth Republic and de Gaulle's rise to power in 1958. At first excluded by de Gaulle, he served in the Senate from 1959 to 1966. From 1962 he was given delicate and important missions abroad (he negotiated French diplomatic recognition of China in 1964) and in 1966 was made minister of agriculture. Appointed minister of education after the student rebellion in May-June 1968, he transformed the university system within a year. De Gaulle's resignation in 1969 meant a second downfall for Faure, whose reforms were not approved by Pres. Georges Pompidou. However, he became minister of social affairs (1972-73) and president of the National Assembly (1973-78). He was a member of the European Parliament in 1979-81. He refused a post in Pres. François Mitterrand's cabinet in 1981. Besides various political and social works, he wrote detective novels under the pseudonym Edgar Sanday.\n\nF. Faure\n\nFaure, (François) Félix (b. Jan. 30, 1841, Paris, France - d. Feb. 16, 1899, Paris), president of France (1895-99). He was elected deputy mayor of Le Havre, and in 1881 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies from the Seine-Inférieure (modern Seine-Maritime) département. He took a seat with the republican followers of Léon Gambetta. After serving as minister of marine (1894-95), Faure became president of France. His victory was unexpected; it came as a rebuff to the political left and its candidate, Henri Brisson. As president he approved the French conquest of Madagascar and exchanged visits with Russian Emperor Nikolay II in 1896 and 1897. The Fashoda conflict, an unsuccessful confrontation with Great Britain in the Sudan (1898), helped to undermine Faure's popularity, but the real dominating issue during his presidency was the Dreyfus Affair. Faure was opposed to reopening the case of Alfred Dreyfus, an army captain falsely accused of treason, and Faure's position encouraged agitation from both the left and the right. He died suddenly, and his funeral was the scene of a confrontation between pro- and anti-Dreyfus groups.\n\nFaure, Maurice (Louis Émile), dit Maurice-Faure (b. Jan. 7, 1850, Saillans, Drôme, France - d. Dec. 8, 1919, Saillans), French politician. He was president of the Radical Party (1903-04) and minister of education (1910-11).\n\nFaure, Maurice (b.

Sept. 19, 1900, Cairo, Egypt - d. June 12, 1981, Cairo), Egyptian politician. He joined the diplomatic service and served in various posts before his appointment as consul general in Jerusalem (1941-44). He became Egyptian representative at the UN in 1947 and ambassador to Britain in 1952. After the 1952 revolution his linguistic skills and diplomatic experience were invaluable to the new regime; he was foreign minister under Pres. Gamal Abdel Nasser from 1952, first of Egypt, then, after the union with Syria, of the United Arab Republic. Fawzi remained a diplomat rather than a politician, and his appointment as Pres. Anwar as-Sadat's prime minister (1970-72) was seen as a compromise, stressing the civilian bias of the new leadership. He stayed on as vice-president of Egypt until his retirement in 1974.\n\nFawzi, Muhammad (b. 1915 - d. Feb. 16, 2000, Masr al-Jidida, Egypt), Egyptian politician. A 1936 graduate of Egypt's military academy, Fawzi first saw war in 1948 when Egypt fought the newly declared state of Israel. He commanded an artillery unit, and was wounded when a mine exploded under his vehicle. Egypt's Pres. Gamal Abdel Nasser named Fawzi commander of the army after the 1967 war, in which Israeli forces captured the Sinai peninsula from Egypt and secured a ceasefire from the Arab armies in just six days. Fawzi's No. 1 task was to rebuild and restore confidence in the shattered army. The next year, Nasser appointed Fawzi to the cabinet as defense minister, and he supervised the so-called war of attrition against Israeli forces along the Suez Canal. In 1971 Nasser's successor, Pres. Anwar as-Sadat, fired and arrested Fawzi, accusing him of taking part in a coup plot. Sadat later pardoned Fawzi. He joined the opposition Arab Nasserite Democratic Party and became a member of its political bureau.\n\nFaxe, Arvid Gustaf (b. Aug. 18, 1799, Karlskrona, Blekinge, Sweden - d.

He was also minister of transport, innovation, and technology (2007-08) and chairman of the Social Democratic Party (2008-16).\n\nFayolle, Philippe Athanase Hélène (b. April 22, 1772, Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe - d. 18...), commandant and administrator of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon (1819-25).\n\nFayose, (Peter) Ayo(dele) (b. Nov. 15, 1960, Ibadan [now in Oyo state], Nigeria), governor of Ekiti (2003-06, 2014-18). He was removed from office in 2006 after being declared guilty of corruption. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission accused him of diverting $100,000 to a personal account in the U.S. and he was also accused of receiving kickbacks on a poultry project embarked upon by his state government.\n\nFaysal\n\nFaysal (ibn Abdul Aziz Al Faysal Al Saud), Faysal also spelled Faisal, Feisal, or Feisul (b. 1906, Riyadh [now in Saudi Arabia] - d. March 25, 1975, Riyadh), king of Saudi Arabia (1964-75). He was a son of King Abdul Aziz and a brother of King Saud. He was appointed foreign minister and viceroy of Hejaz in 1926 after his father conquered that province, in which lies the holy city of Mecca. In 1934 he led a victorious campaign against Yemen. He represented Saudi Arabia at the United Nations Conference of 1945 and was later ambassador to the UN General Assembly. After Saud's accession in 1953, Faysal became crown prince and foreign minister. In 1958, during an economic crisis, Saud gave him full executive powers. He resigned in 1960 but returned in 1962, and in March 1964 he assumed all powers as viceroy, becoming king in November 1964, after Saud was deposed by religious leaders, senior members of the ruling family, and the Council of Ministers. Domestically, Faysal was much more active than his predecessors in economic and educational programs. Although he supported Yemeni royalist forces in their unsuccessful resistance to republicanism, he joined the Arab states in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. Though in failing health, he remained active in his office until he was shot to death by his nephew Prince Faysal ibn Musad Abdul Aziz. King Faysal was succeeded by his brother Crown Prince Khalid.\n\nFaysal I\n\nFaysal I, in full Faysal ibn Hussein al-Hashimi, Faysal also spelled Faisal (b. May 20, 1885, Mecca - d. Sept. 8, 1933, Bern), king of Iraq (1921-33). He was the son of Hussein ibn Ali, king of the Hejaz from 1916 to 1924. World War I provided an opportunity for rebellion for many Arab leaders who had come to resent Ottoman rule, and when in 1916 the Arab revolt was declared, Faysal played an important part in the military campaigns against the Ottomans. An Arab military force occupied Damascus in September 1918, and he was declared head of government (and in March 1920 king) of Syria in accord with his understanding that Arab support for British military ambitions would be rewarded by British support for the creation of an Arab state consisting of most of Syria. When he went to Paris in 1919 to participate in the peace conference, however, he became clearly aware of French determination to establish a sphere of influence in Lebanon and Syria. When France found reason to invade Faysal's kingdom and occupy Damascus (July 1920), he was forced into exile, eventually going to London at the invitation of the British government. Meanwhile, Britain had established a sphere of influence in Iraq. To ease resistance to British rule, Britain decided in March 1921 to sponsor Faysal as king of an Iraqi government with which Britain would conclude a treaty providing for eventual independence. Faysal accepted the plan and was enthusiastically welcomed in Iraq, where he was crowned in August 1921. As a Pan-Arab leader he had no specific political roots in Iraq, deriving his authority by moderating various conflicting elements. He negotiated with Britain a series of treaties culminating in 1930 with a treaty that enabled Iraq to achieve complete independence by 1932.\n\nFaysal II\n\nFaysal II, in full Faysal ibn Ghazi al-Hashimi, Faysal also spelled Faisal (b. May 2, 1935, Baghdad, Iraq - d. July 14, 1958, Baghdad), king of Iraq (1939-58). He was the son of King Ghazi I, who on April 4, 1939, died in a motorcar accident. In April 1941, at the time of Rashid Ali's rebellion, he was smuggled out of the country by the Queen Mother Aliyah. He was educated in England, at Harrow. His maternal uncle Abdul Ilah, the regent, who was largely responsible for his upbringing and training, was his sole guardian since the death of the queen mother in 1950. On May 2, 1953, having attained his majority, King Faysal II was enthroned at Baghdad. Until the union of Egypt and Syria in February 1958, Faysal and his cousin Hussein of Jordan, who both belonged to the 41st generation of the Hashemite family, were rivals for the leadership of the clan. The issue was decided on February 14 when Faysal became the head of the Arab Federation uniting Iraq and Jordan. When on July 14, 1958, a revolution broke out in Baghdad, Faysal died as an army unit tried to arrest him. He was allegedly shot when the palace guard resisted.\n\nFaysal ibn Abdullah (ibn Muhammad Al Saud) (b. May 13, 1950, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia), Saudi prince; son-in-law of King Abdullah. He was minister of education (2009-13).\n\nFaysal ibn Bandar (ibn Abdul Aziz Al Saud) (b. 1943, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia), Saudi prince; grandson of Abdul Aziz. He has been governor of al-Qassim (1992-2015) and Riyadh (2015- ).\n\nFaysal ibn F.\n\nFaysal ibn Farhan (ibn Abdullah Al Saud) (b. Nov. 1, 1974, Frankfurt am Main, West Germany), foreign minister of Saudi Arabia (2019- ). He was also ambassador to Germany (2019).\n\nFaysal ibn Khalid (ibn Abdul Aziz Al Saud) (b. 1954), Saudi prince; son of Khalid; grandson of Abdul Aziz.

He was named governor of Mohéli in March 2001. In November 2001, while on his way to Rabat via Cairo to attend a meeting of French-speaking mayors, he was the victim of mistaken identity. The Egyptian intelligence services mistook him for Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, a Comoran terrorist with links to al-Qaeda, who featured on the FBI's most wanted list. The Egyptians handed him to FBI agents at the American embassy, who proceeded to interrogate him. He was released the following morning after a traveling companion had sounded the alarm and the Americans had ascertained his true identity from the French embassy in Moroni. His incumbent position as island governor and the backing of Pres. Azali Assoumani helped him beat his rival, Mohamed Hassanaly, in the second round of the elections for the presidency of Mohéli on April 7, 2002, although Hassanaly had won more votes in the first round. In 2007 he was defeated by Mohamed Ali Said. In 2010 he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of the Comoros. In 2016 he was again elected to the island leadership (although the title had reverted to governor), defeating Hadidja Aboubacar.\n\nFazy, (Georges Philippe) Henri (b. Jan. 31, 1842, Bern, Switzerland - d. Dec. 22, 1920, Geneva, Switzerland), president of the Council of State of Genève (1901-02, 1903-04, 1905-06, 1907-08, 1909-10, 1911-12, 1913-14, 1915-16, 1917-18); distant cousin of James Fazy.\n\nFazy, James, byname of Jean-Jacob Fazy (b.

Aug. 15, 1927 - d. Oct. 17, 1995), foreign minister of the Kazakh S.S.R. (1973-76). He was also Soviet ambassador to Mali (1976-83) and Morocco (1983-90).\n\nFearey, Robert A(ppleton) (b.

Aug. 1, 1877, Guayaquil, Ecuador), foreign minister of Ecuador (1830).\n\nL. Febres C.\n\nFebres Cordero (Ribadeneyra), León (Esteban Francisco [added at baptism:] de las Mercedes), Ribadeneyra also spelled Rivadeneira (b. March 9, 1931, Guayaquil, Ecuador - d. Dec. 15, 2008, Guayaquil), president of Ecuador (1984-88); great-grandson of Esteban Febres Cordero. In 1965 he started his political career as president of Guayaquil's Federation of Industry and also as president of the Association of Latin-American Industrialists. A member of the National Constituent Assembly of 1966, he then served as senator until 1970. During the country's transition back to democracy in the late 1970s, Febres Cordero joined the Social Christian Party and was elected to Congress in 1979. In opposition, he became an outspoken critic of the reformist social programs of the Roldós and Hurtado administrations and assumed the leadership of the National Reconstruction Front at the 1984 presidential election. After two rounds, Febres Cordero narrowly defeated his social democrat opponent, Rodrigo Borja, with 52% of the vote. The victory of his six-party conservative coalition largely represented the triumph of the populous coastal city of Guayaquil and its powerful businesses. Febres Cordero stood for free market policies and believed that the country's recovery lay in bolstering private economic activity. His appeal, however, seemed to reflect Ecuador's tradition of personalist politics rather than popular support for conservative policies. Unlike his predecessor, Febres Cordero did not enjoy a congressional majority. He survived politically despite an earthquake that crippled oil exports for six months, a leftist insurgency, two military rebellions, and a kidnapping by renegade paratroopers who killed three of his bodyguards (he was released 11 hours later after being roughed up). He applied an iron fist to virtually eliminate the urban, Cuban-inspired guerrilla group Alfaro Vive. After leaving the presidency, he dominated the Congress and served as mayor of Guayaquil (1992-20"
