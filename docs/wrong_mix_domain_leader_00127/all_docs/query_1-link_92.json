        "text": "By Ryan Heath | Tips to [email protected] | To read on your desktop click here\n\nCARS — AGREEMENT ON TOXIC EMISSIONS: Technocrats who gathered to agree limits on toxic emissions from cars — including the now famous Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) at the center of the Volkswagen scandal — entered a meeting sharply divided Wednesday. Then all of them but the Netherlands agreed to a new system that is far from the tough line the European Commission wanted. Their compromise allows vehicles to carry on emitting more than twice the agreed pollution limits. MEPs and NGOs were predictably outraged. Greenpeace says the deal is “effectively rewarding the cheaters.” I hear Germany, France and U.K., with the consent of the Commission, pressed the other countries. Whatever the case, experts and journalists aren’t buying the spin, and there are certain to be more questions.\n\nMIGRATION BY THE NUMBERS: For all the European Commission’s efforts, including daily coordination meetings, the numbers show there’s a large gap between the plans and reality of dealing with the migrant crisis.\n\n268,000 — migrants have arrived to the island of Lesbos alone in 2015\n\n86 — the number of refugees so far relocated under a September plan agreed by leaders\n\n90,000 plus — number of migrants that have entered Slovenia in last 11 days\n\n400 — number of police leaders said they’d send to Slovenia “within a week” to help them cope\n\n30 — officers that are “on the way”\n\n13 — officers actually helping deal with the situation\n\nFRONTEX BORDER AGENCY ACCUSED OF NEGLIGENCE IN LESBOS: El Mundo reports that Spanish volunteers helping rescue sinking migrants off the coast of Lesbos went unaided by Frontex, the EU’s border agency. According the report, guards did nothing more than throw ropes overboard, and Greek ambulances on the beach lacked even the necessary oxygen supplies to save the lives of some of the rescued. The volunteers praised Greek and Turkish fishermen for helping. http://bit.ly/1PXMLKW\n\nGERMANY — IT’S THE FIGHT OF MERKEL’S LIFE, BUT DON’T WRITE HER OFF: Angela Merkel faces real dissatisfaction, but no serious challenger. Bavaria’s Horst Seehofer does not really want her head, and if Merkel can control the numbers of refugees a little, most Germans will be happy to bank the goodwill the world showered on them for opening their borders. Florian Eder has more: http://politi.co/1GNyv5l. Meanwhile, far-right groups are asking public prosecutors to charge Merkel with treason: http://bit.ly/1MwSfMY\n\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS — MOGHERINI’S GOOD YEAR ASSESSED: Tim King sketches a star whose biggest test — handling Turkey — is yet to come. “The EU has moved on from the scars, both emotional and institutional, inflicted by Catherine Ashton, [Federica] Mogherini’s predecessor as foreign policy chief. … Staff inside the institutions now testify to a much improved relationship” between Mogherini and Donald Tusk. “Of most importance is that Mogherini and Timmermans, two of the key players in improving relations between the EEAS and the Commission, give each other room to operate. Both are polyglot social democrat ex-foreign ministers, for whom Europe and foreign policy have been twin obsessions.” http://politi.co/1MwSasT\n\nTURKEY ELECTION PREVIEW: The final poll before Sunday’s election puts the ruling AKP Party at 47 percent, up four points from previous polls, and in the zone to achieve the parliamentary majority it lost in June. The center-left CHP is set for 25 percent, the nationalist MHP around 15 percent, and the liberal pro-Kurdish HDP around 13 percent. http://reut.rs/1RD0llb\n\nMEET THE MOST IMPORTANT WOMAN IN TURKEY: Figen Yuksekdağ, co-chair of the party (HDP) which unexpectedly robbed the Justice and Development Party (AKP) of its ruling majority in June, tries in vain to keep President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan honest. Alev Scott profiles Yuksekdağ for POLITICO as she leads the charge into her most important battle yet. Meanwhile, Erdoğan says Obama’s campaign team is behind HDP’s rise, and the Guardian asks whether Yukesekdağ’s co-leader, and leading liberal voice, can pull Turkey back from the brink of war: http://bit.ly/1GzQyvX\n\n**A message from Google: There’s nothing serious about the fun, addictive mobile game “Best Fiends,” which has been downloaded a million times. However, its developer, Finland’s Seriously, grew impressively fast thanks to Android: https://goo.gl/TJD0eY **\n\nMOLDOVA — GOVERNMENT DISMISSED BY PARLIAMENT: The pro-EU government in Europe’s poorest country is voted out by Parliament over a banking scandal, explains Ginger Hervey. http://politi.co/1P0gPWY\n\nBELARUS — MOST EU SANCTIONS SUSPENDED: The release of political prisoners triggers a rethink of measures against 170 people, including President Alexander Lukashenko, and an asset freeze applying to three Belarusian companies. http://politi.co/1Gz4rKO\n\nCHINA, JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA HOLD SUMMIT ON SUNDAY: On the agenda, confronting their pasts, establishing a regular pattern of relations, and speeding up a three-way free trade agreement. http://s.nikkei.com/1Wm8cEZ\n\nDEMOGRAPHICS — CHINA MOVES TO TWO-CHILD POLICY: http://reut.rs/1ScALEk\n\nDEMOGRAPHICS — UK ON COURSE TO BE BIGGEST EU POPULATION: The U.K. is set to overtake France and grow to nearly 75 million by 2030, and could bypass Germany by 2047 at latest. http://bit.ly/1P8RMiW\n\nBY THE NUMBERS: 1,000 — the number of euros Yanis Varoufakis earned for each minute of his recent RAI television interview in Italy (not including the first-class plane ticket.) 59 — the number of weeks it would take him to withdraw all the cash from Greek ATMs under capital control rules. http://politi.co/1RgkihD\n\nSAKHAROV PRIZE FOR FREEDOM TO RAIF BADAWI — IMPRISONED SAUDI BLOGGER: Badawi was awarded the prize, beating out former Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov and Venezuelan opposition groups. Several of the European Parliament’s political parties seemed as interested in claiming credit for jointly nominating Badawi as in saluting his win. http://bbc.in/1P96yWX\n\nICYMI — MEET THE CZECH DONALD TRUMP: Or is that the eastern Berlusconi? Andrej Babiš is a billionaire, media mogul, chairman of his own political party, deputy prime minister and finance minister. He’s also popular, trusted by 64 percent of people in a poll released earlier this month. Benjamin Cunningham has the profile. http://politi.co/1MW59hS\n\nFANTASY BREXIT: Think Fantasy Football applied to EU summits. Steven Blockmans and Stefani Weiss for the Bertelsmann Foundation and CEPS (Center for European Policy Studies) gathered 14 think-tankers to “slip into the role of their respective heads of state or government and negotiate with the U.K. on what is thus far known to be the British demands,” says Weiss. Treaty change is a non-starter, because Cameron is out of time. “Cameron thus might have to become much more realistic as well as constructive,” says Weiss. “It seems advisable that he changes his role from sole demander to a leading reformer and makes himself the spearhead of an all-out treaty reform. Getting the other member states to agree on a date for a European Convention seems more convincing than legally non-binding declarations” on ever-closer union, for example. http://bit.ly/1PWMLuG\n\nREALITY BREXIT — LUXEMBOURG AND FRANKFURT GET READY TO DIVIDE THE SPOILS: If the U.K. leaves there are two financial centers with access to 10 million workers ready to step in to claim the mantle of EU banking capital, Bloomberg reports. http://bv.ms/1Wme0yx\n\nREALITY BREXIT — HOW NOT TO DO A TV INTERVIEW ON THE SUBJECT: Former Europe minister Owen Paterson struggles to answer questions put to him by BBC’s Newsnight http://bit.ly/1ScFRAG\n\nTRADE AND BREXIT — NEW ZEALAND PLACES AN EACH-WAY BET: Responding to a question I posed about whether New Zealand would prioritize a free trade agreement with the EU over a bilateral deal with the U.K., Prime Minister John Key said: “It is for the U.K. to decide [on whether to leave EU] but we would want to preserve both. We would need to find a way through.”\n\nCLIMATE CORNER: French Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius set benchmarks for a successful COP21, in a speech to MEPs. “First you have to reach an agreement, legally binding, and have to produce an effective limit on global warming by 2100, limited to 2 degrees,” said the chairman of the COP21 conference. The second benchmark is to agree on a five-year revision clause that makes countries ramp up their emissions cuts over time. The third key to success is to have a legally binding agreement. The issue of setting a global price on carbon emissions won’t be tackled at COP21. http://politi.co/1LZy6d2\n\nCLIMATE — THE UNION OF SINKING ISLANDS: Kalina Oroschakoff writes on how the EU is nurturing a strategic alliance with a group of small islands scattered around the world’s oceans to push for its climate change deal at the Paris summit. http://politi.co/1KJuda1\n\nPOLAND KICKS THE KYOTO PROTOCOL AND BRUISES ITSELF: Sara Stefanini reports that Poland’s president may have issued the most expensive policy veto in Polish history. Poland has been an enormous beneficiary of the Kyoto climate protocol, but that didn’t stop President Andrzej Duda vetoing an extension of the 1997 pact, and in doing so stopping the EU from signing on.\n\nKyoto’s design benefits Poland to such an extent it has the world’s third-largest stash of surplus emissions allowances. Sales of these allowances have so far raised €186.6 million. That comes to a stop if Duda sticks to his veto. If he goes further and tries to overturn Poland’s existing climate commitments that come through its EU membership, he’s also putting €4.8 billion in EU funds for energy infrastructure upgrades at risk. http://politi.co/1LEoUgb\n\nFRANCE BEMUSED AS AMERICANS AMUSED BY THE 35-HOUR WEEK: The French ambassador to the U.S. was quick and funny in his reaction to Jeb Bush mocking French labor law during a Republican presidential primary debate. He pointed out that the French work longer than Germans and have better family support than American workers (such as maternity leave):http://bit.ly/1M0qF5l\n\nWONK CORNER: The most recent, most downloaded reports from wonk.eu with a 4-star rating or higher:\n\n1) Erik Akse’s report on “Working with the Commission’s REFIT” (Regulatory Fitness and Performance program) http://bit.ly/1RfQrWC\n\n2) GE Energy on the Digital Energy Transformation http://bit.ly/1HethKG\n\n3) Briefing on the Shareholder Rights Directive by Paige Morrow, head of Brussels operations at Frank Bold, together with academic partners http://bit.ly/1KIofGH\n\nCOSMOPOLITAN BRUSSELS: After Dubai, Brussels is the city with the highest percentage of residents born abroad. More than six in ten residents of Brussels were born abroad according to the World Migration Report 2015, published by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The rankings are: 1) Dubai, 83 percent. 2) Brussels, 62 percent. 3) Toronto, 46 percent. 4) Sydney and Auckland, both at 39 percent. http://bit.ly/1Rg9iRF\n\nSOCIALISTS IN LEBANON: A conference and four-hour visit to a refugee camp in Beirut takes place Saturday between European socialists and Arab partners. Sergei Stanishev, Walid Jumblatt, Diederik Samsom, Gianni Pittella, Nabeel Shaath, Yvette Cooper, and reps from UNHCR, UNICEF, among others will be there.\n\nSPOTTED: Commission Vice President Kristalina Georgieva flying Easyjet from Strasbourg to London.\n\nELECTED — PAUL RYAN IS THE NEW SPEAKER OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. The man last seen, by many Europeans, as Mitt Romney’s vice presidential candidate in the 2012 U.S. election is now the most powerful leader on Capitol Hill. http://nyti.ms/1ObAanS\n\nAPPOINTED: Edit Herczog, former social democrat MEP and Hungarian national MP, is joining the International Advisory Council of the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. Herczog is a specialist in finance, budget and transparency issues.\n\nWILL CORPORATE EUROPE OBSERVATORY COMPLAIN? The transparency NGO seems to have a problem with most appointments former EU office-holders take, including Viviane Reding serving on a philanthropic foundation board, and José Manuel Barroso giving speeches and supporting the Madrid Opera. What will they make of a transparency advocate daring to take up new paid employment?\n\nLONDON COFFEE/CAFÉ TIP: Gail Orton (with my strong agreement) endorses Monmouth Coffee company with outlets on Monmouth Street (Seven Dials neighborhood behind Covent Garden), Borough Market and Bermondsey. http://bit.ly/1LFeGMx\n\nJUST FOR FUN: How to win over 65,000 fanatical football fans with simple good humor. VIDEO http://bit.ly/1P7WcGT h/t Helena O’Rourke Potocki.\n\nBIRTHDAYS: Zoran Milanović, Croatia’s Prime Minister.\n\nTHANKS to Anca Gurzu, Bill Nichols, Craig Winneker and Emmet Livingstone.\n\n**A message from Google: As one million gamers have found out, Best Fiends is seriously fun. With content development in icy Finland and marketing handled from the LA sunshine, mobile game builder Seriously is a truly international success story. While they take care of the high production values and Hollywood movie look and feel of their games, Google does a great job of getting players their fix. “Android has a fantastic global reach,” says Andrew Stalbow, Seriously Co-Founder and CEO. “It’s helping us build the next generation of entertainment brands on mobile and challenge the big guys.” He adds the average American spends an hour a day playing games on their smartphone or tablet — meaning this content-hungry market is just a swipe away for European developers: https://goo.gl/TJD0eY **"
