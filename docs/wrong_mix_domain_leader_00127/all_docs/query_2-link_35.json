The surveys point to discontent with high unemployment and with France's declining influence in Europe.\n\nEducation Minister Francois Fillon said Chirac had been convincing in the debate and that it was a tough examination.\n\n\"It was much harder for the president than a debate with journalists,\" Fillon told Reuters.\n\nAll 25 EU members must ratify the constitution -- by referendum or parliamentary vote -- for it to take effect.\n\nFour nations -- Lithuania, Hungary, Slovenia and Italy -- have already ratified the constitution. A vote in Greece's parliament due to take place on Friday was delayed until Tuesday.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
