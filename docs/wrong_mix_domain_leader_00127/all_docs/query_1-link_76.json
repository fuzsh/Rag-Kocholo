        "text": "Effective policy cooperation on the strong foundation of evidence-based best practice and multilateral dialogue is essential and the 2024 OECD Ministerial Council Meeting is an opportunity to engage in high-level discussions among Members and non-Members on the issues critical to today’s international community.\n\nThe theme for the 2024 MCM on “Leading Global Discussions with Objective and Reliable Approaches towards Sustainable and Inclusive Growth” comprises three overarching pillars:\n\n• A Diverse, Inclusive, and Likeminded OECD: Strengthening the Outreach of our Work.\n\n• An Economic Order based on the Shared Values: Firmly Maintaining Free and Fair Trade and Enhancing Economic Resilience.\n\n• Co-creating a Better Future: Addressing Emerging Challenges at Global Scale.\n\nThe 2024 MCM will further leverage the strengths of the OECD to support policymakers around the world to develop sound and well-coordinated policy responses to each of the structural shifts in front of us, grounded in our shared values of democracy, the protection of human rights, the rule of law and market-based economic principles. A renewed commitment to strong and effective multilateralism, with the OECD at the centre of global cooperation, will help promote global efforts to co-create better policies for better lives and a better future."
