        "text": "On May 10, 1940, the German offensive put an end to the âdrÃ´le de guerreâ (âphony warâ) that had begun in September 1939, an eight-month period during which France had entered the conflict but was not waging war. Until then, the French military High Command had chosen a defensive strategy; the Blitzkrieg (âlightning warâ) carried out by the Wehrmacht, or German army, demonstrated the failure of that option. On May 15, the French front was breached, and after the German attacks on the regions of the Somme (June 7) and Aisne (June 10), French defeat was complete. On June 10, the government left , which the German troops entered on the 14th. One week later, they were in the city of Bordeaux. The French debacle was massive. More than 90,000 soldiers died in combat, 200,000 were wounded and 1,850,000 taken prisoner. At least 8 million panic-stricken people took to the roads in an exodus toward the South that revealed âthe huge scale of this event, which one could not describe in its entirety,â as well as âthe fragility of social structures and the magnitude of the crisis the nation was going through.â âMarshall PÃ©tain, whom the majority of the French perceived as a last resort and the only solution for survival, imposed the political choice of an armistice on this stranded country.â (P. Laborie, p. 591 in Dictionnaire historique de la RÃ©sistance by FranÃ§ois Marcot, Bruno Leroux and Christine Levisse-TouzÃ© (eds.), : Editions Robert Laffont, 2006) It was signed with Germany on June 22 in the CompiÃ¨gne forest, in the clearing of Rethondes, and with Italy on June 24. In this way, and not through surrender and continuation of the struggle in another form, the Vichy regime was imposed. Collaboration with Germany came with it. Officially, the Vichy regime was created on July 10, 1940, when both chambers of the French parliament voted to give full powers to Marshall PÃ©tain. The new French head of State then controlled all instruments of government, both in the executive and the legislative branches.\n\nFrance occupied zones 1940-1944\n\nBut the Armistice had other immediate consequences: the partial occupation of French territory and its division into several zones placed under the control of different political authorities (cf. maps). Germany occupied three-fifths of mainland France: the areas with the most economic potential and the Atlantic and Northern coasts. The MilitÃ¤rbefehlshaber in Frankreich (MBF) (the German Military Command in France) was set up in to administer this âoccupied zone.â Otto von StÃ¼lpnagel took control of it in October 1940. The French government was established in Vichy, in the âfree zoneâ; a âfront line,â which became a âligne de dÃ©marcationâ (a demarcation or boundary line) separated these two âNorthâ and âSouthâ zones. The armistice signed with Italy led to a minor reduction of the size of the free zone under total control of the Vichy regime, as about 15 French communes (districts) â mainly in the region of Alpes-Maritimes â were administered by Italy.\n\nDefeat and occupation divided the country still more, carving it up (E. Alary, 2003: 17-37). Before the armistice was even signed, the two dÃ©partements (French geographical and administrative units) of the Nord and the Pas-de-Calais were added to the Military Command for Belgium and Northern France, based in Brussels (MilitÃ¤rbefehlshaber in Belgien und Nordfrankreich, MBB), and run by General von Falkenhausen. The June 22 armistice did not alter these dividing lines, which remained the same throughout the war.\n\nIt did not mention the de facto annexation of the three dÃ©partements of Alsace and Moselle by Germany, which was taking place at the time, either; this was made official in October 1940. By June 20, Hitler had already named two Gauleiters (governors) for the civilian administration of these territories. Alsace was merged with Baden to form the Gau Oberrhein region, run by Robert Wagner; as for Moselle, it was associated to the regions of Saarland and Pfalz (Palatinate), and together they formed the Gau Westmark region, under Josef BÃ¼rckelâs control. French borders disappeared as the old boundaries of the Frankfurt Treaty of May 1871 were reinstated, and a German Customs service set up along them. The deportation convoys heading to Metz officially entered the German Reich at NovÃ©ant â Neuburg an der Mosel â on the border of annexed Moselle.\n\nAnother consequence of the defeat was that the German authorities maintained a âzone interditeâ (âforbidden zoneâ) which they had created in summer 1940 in the North and East of the country, in order to prevent the return of displaced persons that had left during the exodus; it extended through 17 dÃ©partements, all the way to the Swiss border. The perimeter of this zone was guarded until December 1941. Starting in April 1941, a forbidden coastal zone was created in the occupied area, all along the shoreline from the Basses-PyrÃ©nÃ©es to the Nord, due to its strategic importance.\n\nFinally, a significant new territorial change took place: the invasion of the southern zone on November 11, 1942 resulted in the occupation of all of French territory; the region east of the RhÃ´ne river valley and Corsica were left under control of Mussoliniâs armed forces until the proclamation of the Italian armistice in September 1943. However, in the territories newly occupied by the Germans, the MBFâs authority was not immediately extended, in order to preserve the illusion of a sovereign Vichy government. These areas were qualified a âmilitary operations zone,â and placed under the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief of the western front. To administrate them, he named a representative in Vichy, who was supposed to liaise with the French government, and a Commander of the military region of southern France, in order to administrate this sector according to the same directives issued to the Military Commander in the northern zone. In fact, the MBFâs services informally confirmed the rulings of the only military court set up in the southern zone (G. Eismann, 2007: 157).\n\nThis territorial fragmentation had essential political consequences, since it resulted in the creation of different occupation systems to administer areas that were part of France in 1939. There were two German military administrations (in the northern zone, run by the Command in , and in the areas attached to the Brussels Command), a German Commander of armed forces in the southern zone after November 1942 (and an Italian Commander for the relevant occupied area), and two civilian administrations of the Reich for Alsace and Moselle. In these different zones, the Occupation was not managed identically; hence, neither was the persecution policy or the manner in which repression was run. The consequences of the evolution of the military conflict also differed in these zones. Therefore, this chronology does not include the histories of repression and persecution in the two dÃ©partements administered by the German military Command in Brussels (E. Dejonghe, Y. Le Maner, 1999; L. Thiery, 2007), or in the three others annexed in effect to the Reich (P. Rigoulot, 1998 ; C. Neveu, 2007). However, we shall briefly summarize the nature and effect of such policies in these particular areas â which historians have not yet finished documenting to this day.\n\nIn Alsace and Moselle, the new German authorities implemented a clear Germanization and Nazification policy from the start, aiming to incorporate these territories into the Reich permanently. This was to ensure that the annexation would become firmly rooted. Hence, they began with a vast political purge operation, characterized by a massive exodus of tens of thousands of people deemed âundesirableâ â Jews, âFranÃ§ais de lâintÃ©rieur,â i.e. Frenchmen from other parts of the country, etc. (P. Rigoulot, 1998). The racial laws in force in the Reich were soon applied, targeting the Jews of Alsace and Moselle. As regards repression, resistance to the annexation appeared immediately; later on, two German measures constituted turning-points. The first was the establishment of the Reicharbeitsdienst, or RAD, service (obligatory labor service for German youth, which was actually the beginning of their military training) in spring 1941 for young Alsatians; the second was obligatory military service in the German army, instated in August 1942. Draft dodgers became more and more numerous; repression was unleashed. In addition to trials before civilian and military courts and many cases of detainment or deportation to the prisons of the different Gaus (FMD, 2004, part 2), the Nazi authorities used policies specific to this zone, such as transferring entire French families into the Reich. Statistics have yet to be compiled, but tens of thousands of people were affected by one or the other of these policies (C. Neveu, 2007).\n\nIn Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Oberfeldkommandantur (âHigh Field Commandâ) 670 was the local authority representative of the MBB. As in the occupied zone, the military administration had police and judicial powers: it made arrests and tried people in its courts. The Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA (Headquarters of the Reich Security Services, the Nazi police service) had local representatives there, but they had to work under the MBBâs authority (L. Thiery, 2007). This situation did not change until the departure of General von Falkenhausen, which led to the appointment of a Gauleiter, but not until July 19, 1944. Hence, victims of legal judicial repression were the majority; this was substantiated by the fact that nearly 70% of the 5,200 persons deported from Nord-Pas-de-Calais were initially sent to prison in the Reich, not to a concentration camp. The situation was quite different from areas under the MBFâs control (FMD, 2004; L. Thiery, 2007). However, two particular convoys marked the history of repression in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The first, carrying miners arrested during the May-June 1941 strikes, resulted in the arrival and registration of 244 French deportees in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, by the end of July 1941 (L. Thiery, 2006). The second corresponded to the evacuation of the metropolitan area of Lille on September 1, 1944, which led to the deportation of almost 900 people on the âLoos Trainâ (âTrain de Loosâ) (Y. Le Maner, 2003). Also, approximately 500 persons were sentenced to death, or taken hostage and shot in reprisal killings, by the Germans (the Vichy authorities executed less than 10 individuals in this way). Furthermore, there were about 650 Jewish victims of the Nazi persecution policy in Nord-Pas-de-Calais, as a result of the European âFinal Solutionâ program. Most of them were foreigners arrested during the mass round-up of September 11, 1942, and transferred to Mechelen, the âBelgian Drancyâ (Drancy was also a mass transit camp for prisoners on the way to death camps). They were deported to Auschwitz four days later on convoy X (the Nazi authorities in Belgium used roman numerals to number convoys; see Maxime Steinbergâs various works on persecution in Belgium). Finally, a distinctive characteristic of this zone was that arrested Gypsies were subsequently deported to Auschwitz; this was not the case in areas controlled by the MBF. Thus, over 150 people apprehended in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and detained at Mechelen, were deported from there on January 15, 1944 (FMD, 2004).\n\nThe chronology presented hereafter is centered on repression (which struck people because of what they had done, or supposedly had done), and persecution (targeting people because of their identity) in the northern zone, occupied since June 1940, and in the southern zone, which was âfreeâ until the German troops took it over on November 11, 1942.\n\nThree types of protagonists played an essential part in the events: the various German authorities, the Vichy government, and the victims they âtargeted,â of course. Though the objectives of the various repressors and persecutors seem convergent overall, they were not always united in their decision-making, and the policies they implemented differed. Even the instruments they used often varied, especially as the impact of events and the evolution of the war â especially on the military level â mattered increasingly.\n\nThe military command (MBF) was the main executive and decision-making protagonist in the northern occupied zone until the summer of 1942. It opted for âsurveillance administration,â as the presence of the French Vichy authorities allowed the MBF to put them in charge of most day-to-day tasks, including repression. This was due to the fact that the MBFâs objectives were rather more pragmatic than ideological: it was essentially focused on the security of the occupying troops, and on allowing efficient economic exploitation of France. As it had to âenforce the law,â and therefore, to repress people (G. Eismann, 2005), it had its Feldgendarmerie (a German military police unit) on the ground, as well as the Geheime Feldpolizei or GFP (âSecret Field Police,â a secret police force), which was in charge of conducting important investigations. Persons arrested had to appear before military tribunals, which had been set up in each dÃ©partement. Those that were found guilty served their sentence in France, or were deported to a prison in the Reich; some were sentenced to death and shot.\n\nThe French branch of the Abwehr (the German intelligence service), another military actor, was directly responsible to the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), the Wehrmacht High Command. The Abwehr carried out sizeable operations in the occupied zone, making large-scale arrests when its investigations allowed it to detect organized Resistance groups. Finally, there were also Wehrmacht troops in France throughout the war, of course; in the run-up to the Allied landing in Normandy, and after this took place, their repressive role became essential.\n\nIn order to ensure the success of the occupation, these military protagonists were subject to the judgment and supervision of the highest authorities of the Reich, in Berlin â military, of course (the OKW followed MBF policy), but especially political. In fact, as Hitler carefully observed the situation in France, the leaders of the diplomatic services and the Nazi police forces endeavored to impose their own points of view. This gave rise to the establishment of other German authorities in the occupied zone, the foremost being those of the Reichâs Foreign Ministry.\n\nVon Ribbentrop, the German Foreign Minister was represented in France by Otto Abetz, the German ambassador in . âIn contact with the Vichy authorities,â Abetz âdeveloped anti-Semitic and anti-Communist political views, and was particularly noted for his trust in collaboration with the French State, especially with Laval, and to a lesser extent with Darlan.â (D. Peschanski, 2006, Dictionnaire historique de la RÃ©sistance, p. 22; B. Lambauer, 2001)\n\nMost of all, Himmler sent his men to the occupied zone as soon as it had been captured. Quite soon, the gradually increasing ascendancy of the Nazi police services had to be taken into account. Their ideological objectives were a decisive element from the start, since in spite of the attribution of executive power to the MBF in 1940, a branch of the Sipo-SD (Sicherheitspolizei und Sicherheitsdienst, the SS intelligence service and State security police, which were combined into the RSHA), with about forty men, was set up in France directly after it was occupied in summer 1940. The Sipo-SD branch began implementing its âpolitical programâ at once; its main concern was targeting the âenemies of the Reich,â essentially Communists, freemasons and Jews. Hence, it closely observed the application of the Armistice clause requiring the French government to turn in German opponents of Nazism residing in France. The activism of the head of the Jewish Affairs department within the Sipo-SD commando in France, SS Lieutenant Theo Dannecker, soon became especially noticeable (he was replaced by another determined anti-Semite, Heinz RÃ¶thke, in summer 1942).\n\nThese events allow us to observe the coexistence of different German authorities, and to emphasize the necessity of clarifying the political and administrative origins of decisions. Thus, âon September 20, 1940, Heydrich [Himmlerâs deputy, the second-in-command of the Nazi police and head of the RSHA] asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Reich to make the Sipo-SD in France primarily responsible for anti-Jewish action, due to its exceptional experience in this field.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 17. Quotations from Klarsfeldâs works are taken from the re-edited versions of many of them in La Shoah en France, 2001.) This request was âgranted by the High Command of the Army in a secret decree dated October 4, 1940.â Thus, from then on, the MBF âsometimes directly managed police operations against Jews when they served as reprisal measures, but its main duty was economic aryanization through the confiscation of Jewish goods, in partnership with the French authorities. Orders from the Military Command determined the progress of anti-Jewish action, but beforehand they were essentially prepared and developed by the Sipo-SD and the German embassy.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 17)\n\nThe leader of this Sipo-SD Kommando (Command) in France, which was theoretically under the MBFâs responsibility and supposed to inform the latter of its undertakings, was Helmut Knochen. He was a young member of the SS, close to Heydrich, who already had an brilliant career in the RSHA intelligence services when he arrived in in the summer of 1940. He combined organizational talent with a pragmatic understanding of the situation in France. A March 9, 1942 decree from the FÃ¼hrer, gave the Sipo-SD control of the main repressive powers in France. Knochen was aware of how small his staff was, and how much more efficient his police services were when they allowed their French counterparts maximum autonomy of action, so as soon as the Sipo-SDâs new powers were effective, on June 1, 1942, he opted for reinforced collaboration with the Vichy authorities.\n\nBeyond its effectiveness in terms of repression, this approach also allowed him to meet the objectives that Eichmannâs services in Berlin had assigned him, in the implementation of the âFinal Solutionâ of the âJewish Question,â this time without bringing the MBF into play. Indeed, with the beginning of anti-German armed struggle, and the hostage crisis â which eventually led to a clash between the Military Commandâs policy and that which Hitler wished, in spite of the repressive resolve they shared â the latter named a HÃ¶herer SS und PolizeifÃ¼hrer, or HSSPF (High leader of the SS and the police) in France, in March 1942, named Karl Oberg. He settled in at the end of May, with Helmut Knochen as his deputy and main assistant; Knochen was officially the Befehlshaber der Sipo und des SD or BdS (Head of the Sipo-SD) in France. From that day on, in practice, most decision-making powers in the field of repression rested with the Nazi police, and not with the MBF. The policy of deportation of the Jews of France was essentially â though not exclusively â carried out after this decisive turning-point.\n\nThis change in the hierarchical structure of the different German authorities in France made the Vichy governmentâs decisive position even more essential. Ever since the armistice had been decided on, the new French government had sought a form of collaboration with the Germans that would enable it to succeed in implementing its political and ideological program â the âNational Revolutionâ (R. Paxton, 1973). Throughout the war, the Vichy establishment counted on peace and Germanyâs victory. When the more pragmatic Pierre Laval became Prime Minister, he made this quest for efficiency an absolute priority. Thus, in the fields of repression and persecution, collaboration meant the convergence of Vichy and German interests â especially police interests â against shared enemies. Laval was running the risk of having the French State sanction and participate in the success of an exclusively Nazi program, simply in order to maintain the illusion of French sovereignty being respected throughout the country, even in the occupied zone. The Vichy Stateâs role in the deportation of the Jews of France was the most dramatic example of this (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-1985; the French literature on Vichy is profuse, see bibliography). It was also in danger of increasing radicalization, which led to its becoming a police State, with Darnand, leader of the Milice (a French paramilitary, extreme-right militia which frequently acted as an auxiliary to the Gestapo) in charge of all law enforcement forces. For the first time, they were combined with the gendarmerie (a military corps of policemen) and the penitentiary administration within the vast Interior Ministry, where the Milice men took hierarchical positions involving more and more authority. The Vichy State was evolving, but only toward a higher degree of radicalization; this did not constitute a change in its nature (D. Peschanski, âVichy un et pluriel,â 2004). Repression and persecution benefited from most of the French State apparatus, which had been made even more efficient by the efforts made to centralize it within an authoritarian State. These included the creation of prÃ©fets de region (civil servants representing the State in each region, who had executive powers), the nationalization of police forces and the creation of the position of Police Superintendent, the establishment of tribunaux dâexception (military courts), the use of administrative detention, etc. (see D. Peschanski, 1997, 2004; D. Peschanski, J.-M. BerliÃ¨re, 2000; A. Bancaud, 2002; and others). In , the role of the PrÃ©fecture de police (whose powers were hardly altered under the Vichy regime), and especially that of its Brigades spÃ©ciales des Renseignements gÃ©nÃ©raux (âGeneral Intelligence Special Brigadesâ), is a prime example of this efficiency in the field of the struggle against Communists (J.-M. BerliÃ¨re, 2001; J.-M. BerliÃ¨re, F. Liaigre, 2004).\n\nThus, in spite of this variety of protagonists, who designed different policies and processes of repression and persecution, the choice of their targets, and eventually of their victims, was more a matter of consensus than of conflict. This did not evolve in any significant way during the occupation, either on the German or on the French side. The images of the Jew, the Communist and the âterrorist/franc-tireur (FreischÃ¤rlerei)â (actually guerrilla fighters/snipers) were clearly dominant; that of the âGaullistâ was probably more significant for the occupying forces than for the French government. However, the evolution of the war and the upsurge of the Resistance radicalized the foundation of this initial struggle even further.\n\nHistorians have already highlighted the absence of fundamental disagreements on the definition of the enemy, and the preeminence of the image of the âJudeo-Bolshevikâ enemy in the analysis of German protagonists â Gestapo policemen as well as military men from the MBF (see A. Meyer, 2002; G. Eismann, 2005, and others). Ideology was obviously crucial in the anti-Semitic policy carried out in France (against a Jewish population estimated at just over 300,000 in summer 1940), but it also played an essential role in orienting repression, especially since in both fields, the Vichy regime had the same enemies as the Germans.\n\nThus, âthe dynamics of exclusion were at the core of the French State,â âthey were inseparable. This was linked to a particular interpretation of the [1940] defeat, which was not explained as the result of military blunders, or even of short-term policies, but rather of the decay of the Republic [the nature of the French political system], which had necessarily led to the downfall of the country and, therefore, to its defeat. This decay, this decadence was due to a plot from the âanti-Franceâ forces, in PÃ©tainâs own words (from August 1940). These forces were designated as Communists, Jews, foreigners, and freemasons. Henceforth, in order to rebuild the country it was no use fighting against the occupying forces, since defeat was a mere symptom of the problem, not its cause. The main priority had to be regenerating French society from the inside by excluding âimpureâ elements from it, which were considered responsible for defeat, and by rallying its âpureâ elements around traditional values, like work, the family, the homeland, order and piety.â (D. Peschanski, âVichy un et pluriel,â 2004). Hence, the French Stateâs anti-Jewish policy was launched immediately, and anti-Communist repression began before the PCF (French Communist Party) even began armed struggle against the occupation. Another consequence of this analysis was the radical struggle against Gaullist âdissidenceâ (for instance, General De Gaulle was sentenced to death in absentia). However, at that point, âthere was no attempt to break entirely with the Vichysto-rÃ©sistants, those partisans of Resistance who considered their active patriotic commitment against the occupying forces was compatible with respect for Marshall PÃ©tain and the legitimacy of all or part of the national Revolution.â (D. Peschanski, 2006, Dictionnaire historique de la RÃ©sistance, pp. 23-24).\n\nThe German authorities â and particularly the Sipo-SD after the southern zone was occupied â were aware of the limited nature of the Vichy authoritiesâ commitment, whereas in contrast, they themselves were fully engaged in the struggle against the Resistance, in which the Gestapo was obviously a prominent protagonist, along with the Abwehr, which was especially involved in countering British intelligence networks. Hence, they soon complained of lack of enthusiasm in this fight on the part of some of the French police forces, at least in the struggle against non-Communist Resistance.\n\nThough research on the âFinal Solutionâ of the âJewish questionâ is more complete, analysis of some of the policies behind repression and persecution in occupied France is still insufficient, especially as regards the history of repression and its victims. In such circumstances, what can one say of the outcome of these policies, of the victims â except in the dÃ©partements attached to the Brussels Military Command and those annexed to Germany (for these specific cases, see the works of L. Thiery and C. Neveu, 2007)?\n\nThe key works to refer to on the subject are those of S. Klarsfeld, who has provided a statistical table of Jewish victims in his conclusions, as well as the Livre-MÃ©morial compiled by the Foundation for the Remembrance of Deportation (Fondation pour la MÃ©moire de la DÃ©portation, or FMD) as regards persons arrested due to repressive measures, and F. Marcotâs 2006 overview article, in the Dictionnaire historique de la RÃ©sistance, pp. 774-775.\n\nRepression and persecution policies differed, in spite of undeniable links between them in the early stages of the âFinal Solutionâ of the âJewish questionâ in France (which will be discussed as we review the first mass round-ups of 1941 in ) that are perfectly illustrated by the âJudeo-Bolshevikâ enemy concept. Hence, their outcomes varied also, especially inasmuch as they reveal the many processes followed from the victimsâ arrest to the moment they were put to death, after trial and/or deportation, or not, in the implementation of either one of these policies.\n\nThough over three-quarters of French Jews were fortunately still alive when the occupation ended, over 74,000 of them had been deported from occupied France (excepting the Nord-Pas de Calais), mostly to the Auschwitz and Sobibor camps; 58.8% of them were gassed upon arrival and only 3.5% of them returned (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001). Less than 1,000 of them were deported on convoys comprising a majority of persons arrested due to repression measures. To that total, we must add estimated numbers of Jews who died in French internment camps (3,000 according to S. Klarsfeld) and in massacres on French territory (probably 1,000 according to the same author, especially at the end of the German occupation, at Saint-Genis-Laval and Bron, on August 20 and 21 respectively).\n\nThe persecution policy did not lead to the deportation of Gypsies from France, except for a few dozens of them on the January 24, 1943 convoy to Sachsenhausen. Denis Peschanski estimates that approximately 3,000 Gypsies were detained in the Vichy government camps during the occupation (D. Peschanski, 2004: 377).\n\nThe first victims of repression policy were the persons shot after being sentenced to death by German military courts; recent research has determined that around 2,500 people were executed following a death sentence issued in the areas under MBF authority or in the southern zone (J.-P. Besse, Th. Pouty, 2006; G. Eismann, 2005). The âsections spÃ©cialesâ (âSpecial Sections,â i.e. French military courts in charge of trying Communists and anarchists) took about a dozen lives. In addition, 735 hostages were executed from September 1941 to October 1943 in the framework of SÃ¼hnemassnahmen (âexpiation measures,â i.e. reprisal measures) decided by the German authorities, and 200 people were put to death after judgment by courts-martial set up by the Vichy regime in 1944.\n\nStarting in 1940-1941, and especially from 1943, deportation gradually became the German authoritiesâ main instrument for the repression of acts of opposition. In both the northern and southern zones, between 1940 and 1944, a total of over 60,300 people were deported to Nazi concentration camps and prisons in the Reich ; at least 42% of them died there (according to the most recent data from the FMDâs Livre-MÃ©morial, 2004).\n\nFinally, the perspective of an Allied landing and of the subsequent end to the occupation of France led the German troops to commit atrocities against maquisards (Resistance guerrilla fighters) and civilians: P. Lieb (2007) estimates the number of victims of the âstruggle against gangsâ at 15,000.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1945, a total of at least 116,000 people were killed â either shot, in massacres or after being deported from France â due to the persecution and repression policies carried out in the northern and southern zones.\n\nCharts representing the numbers of persons executed by firing squad and deported from occupied France (excluding the zone administered from Brussels and the annexed zone). Please bear in mind that the scales of magnitude involved are not identical.\n\nPersonns executed by firing squad after au death sentence (July 1940 - August 1944)\n\nJewish personns deported in the \"Final Solution\" convoys (March 1942 - August 1944)\n\nHostages executed through reprisal measures (September 1941 - October 1942)\n\nPersonns arrested due to repression measures\n\nand deported to concentration camps or prisons in the Reich (August 1940 - November 1944)\n\nWe will consider five main steps of this heavy toll paid by France in terms of human life, its evolution, as well as the different processes that explain it.\n\nThus, this article is an attempt to summarize these events based on a chronology, which is quite limited by the deficiencies and the imbalance of the existing historiography. Each event described is followed by one to three stars, according to our degree of knowledge of it. However, in the case of occupied France, one rarely has little or no information on an event, especially in comparison with other cases of mass violence, in other places and/or in other periods. Thus, in most cases we have indicated two or three stars; for the purposes of this article, the difference between these two options is essentially linked to our knowledge of the mechanisms of events, rather than to memories of them, which are often considerable. Once again, the overall distribution of these stars indicates the need for finer knowledge of the repressive processes at work, more than of the sequence of events in the âFinal Solution.â\n\nJune 1940 â summer 1941: judicial repression and the first anti-Jewish measures\n\nThe first year of the occupation has often been described as quiet; in fact, it was characterized by the German authoritiesâ introduction of the first repression policies. The groundwork of the anti-Jewish policy was also quickly laid, both on the German and the French sides.\n\nThough the MBF intended to let the French authorities do most of the repression work â this was the foundation of its âsurveillance administrationâ â it immediately proved implacable in imposing and enforcing its policy of âlaw enforcement and security,â especially faced with action directly affecting the occupying power (A. Meyer, 2002; G. Eismann, 2005). Indeed, the situation reports of MBF services mentioned increasing hostility within the French population, in spite of the prevalence of âattentismeâ (fence-straddling or âwait-and-see attitude), which was still considered the majority position (see MBF reports and synopses of the French prÃ©fetsâ reports at www.ihtp.cnrs.fr). Hence, strict repressive measures were quickly put into place in order to keep the peace and enforce the law in an area considered strategic for the rest of the war, both economically (France had huge resources) and militarily (in view of the invasion of Great Britain).\n\nFrom the end of 1940, the MBF made use of administrative internment measures (especially in the fort of Romainville; Th. Fontaine, 2007) and of collective reprisal measures â these were essentially financial penalties, hostage executions were not carried out as planned (R. Delacor, 2000). However, most of its repressive system rested upon its military courts, that is, a judicial policy âwith a legal faceâ (G. Eismann, 2005). Yet âduring the first few months of the occupation, judicial repression of everything considered dangerous for the security of the occupying power, or harmful to the Wehrmachtâs image, became stricter step by step.â (G. Eismann, 2007:135) Soon, Gaullist movements were targeted, as well as individual attempts to depart to England; the French police forces, on the other hand, were essentially repressing Communists at the time â before the âPCFâs [French Communist Party] engagement in the Resistance, and then in armed struggleâ took place (D. Peschanski, Dictionnaire historique de la RÃ©sistance, p. 23). All in all, from June 1940 to the end of July 1941, just over 160 death sentences were issued by these military courts, one quarter of which were carried out. Almost a hundred of the detainees thus tried were deported to the Reich, to serve their sentence in prison (FMD, Livre-MÃ©morial, 2004).\n\nMost of the anti-Jewish legislation was passed during the first year of occupation. On one hand, âwithout any pressure from the Germans,â the Vichy government showed âits anti-Jewish racismâ (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001:18). The segregation of the Jews began, as well as the âaryanizationâ of their property, i.e. its confiscation and transfer to non-Jews (J-M. Dreyfus, 2003). On the other hand, Dannecker, who headed the anti-Jewish department of the Sipo-SD, developed his policy for the initial internment of thousands of Jews from the occupied zone, mostly with the MBF and Ambassador Abetzâs agreement. The first mass round-up took place as early as May 1941 in .\n\nJuly 4, 1940: German penal law officially became applicable in occupied French territory. âArticle 161 of the German Military Code [specified] that any act harmful to the security of the occupying troops, as well as any violation of a decree from the FÃ¼hrer or his representative, [was] a reprehensible act which [had to] be punished just as though it had been committed on the territory of the Reich.â (G. Eismann, 2006, in Dictionnaire historique de la RÃ©sistance, pp. 782-784) On the same day, Etienne Achavanne was shot in Rouen after a military court sentenced him to death for cutting a telephone wire. But the first person to be shot in the occupied zone that we know of today was probably Auguste Gras, who was sentenced to death on June 4, in the dÃ©partement of Aisne, by the military court of a Wehrmacht unit, and shot the next day Y. Le Maner, E. Dejonghe, 1999:187). The first person to be shot in was Jacques Bonsergent, who was executed on December 23, after he was arrested for his anti-German attitude (J.-P. Besse, Th. Pouty, 2006:138-139). **\n\nAugust 6, 1940: Two individuals arrested in the Manche region and judged by the court-martial of a Wehrmacht infantry division in the Saint-LÃ´ area were deported to the Cologne prison, in Germany. They were the first two persons to be deported from the occupied zone; they had been arrested due to repression measures (according to the most recent research, FMD, Livre-MÃ©morial, 2004, vol.1: 249). *\n\nAugust 27, 1940: The 1939 statutory order (dÃ©cret-loi) which had made racist verbal abuse an offense, also known as the Marchandeau law, was abolished. On July 22, the Vichy government had promulgated a law annulling the naturalization of foreigners (C. Andrieu, 2000). ***\n\nSeptember 12, 1940: âThe German Military Command in France took measures to legitimize taking and executing hostages in the occupied zone.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1979:19) Local notables then became the German authoritiesâ first targets. ***\n\nSeptember 27, 1940: In the occupied zone, a German decree set out an administrative definition of âJewsâ (on a religious basis) and initiated a population census. The Nazi anti-Jewish policy was established; its objectives were the exclusion of Jews and the confiscation of their property (particularly through the October 18 decree). ***\n\nOctober 3, 1940: The Vichy government adopted the Statut des Juifs (âStatute on Jews,â discriminatory legislation against French Jews), the definition of which was based on ârace.â The next day, another law allowed the internment of foreigners of Jewish âraceâ in âspecial campsâ or in âforced residence.â In addition, for administrative internment, Vichy also used statutory orders (dÃ©crets-loi) issued under the Third Republic (especially those dated November 12, 1938 and November 18, 1939; D. Peschanski, 2004). âThis absolute âsuspect lawâ was the core of the repression and persecution mechanisms of the French State in the southern zone.â (D. Peschanski, 2006, Dictionnaire historique de la RÃ©sistance, p. 25) ***\n\nOctober 1940: In the occupied zone, many Communist activists were arrested by the Vichy police (J.-P. AzÃ©ma/A. Prost/J-P. Rioux, 1986). ***\n\nNovember 11, 1940: The first sizeable demonstration in , attended by as many as 5,600 people on the Place de lâEtoile, was suppressed by the French police, which arrested around 1,000 people (D. Tartakowski, Dictionnaire historique de la RÃ©sistance, 2006: 601-602). ***\n\nMay 13-26, 1941: On the rue Saint-Dominique, in , the trial of several members of the Nemrod intelligence network began before the Gross (Greater ) court; it was one of the first trials of a resistance group. All of the accused were condemned to death, though only three were eventually shot: Maurice Barlier, Jean Doornick and HonorÃ© dâEstienne dâOrves (J-P. Besse, Th. Pouty, 2006: 140). **\n\nMay 14, 1941: The first of the three biggest mass round-ups of Jews of the year 1941 was carried out by the French police in , upon a request from the German occupying authorities. 3,700 Jews, both French and foreign, were arrested and sent to two camps in the dÃ©partement of Loiret: Beaune-la-Rolande and Pithiviers (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001). ***\n\nJune 2, 1941: The Vichy authorities also carried out a census of the Jews and their property, in both zones. The records thus produced allowed later arrests to be made. On July 22, 1941, a French law modeled on the previous German one initiated economic âaryanizationâ (R. Poznanski, 1994). ***\n\nSummer 1941 â autumn 1942: the radicalization of repression, characterized by the hostage issue and the implementation of the âFinal Solutionâ in occupied France\n\nAfter the invasion of the USSR and the PCFâs decision to engage in armed struggle against the occupier, the MBF became increasingly demanding in terms of security. This tendency had begun previously, before the series of attacks against its soldiers: it had started radicalizing its judicial repression policy as early as spring 1941 (G. Eismann, 2007:141). In spite of genuine achievements on the part of the French police, and its obvious efficiency in the fight against Communism (J.-M. BerliÃ¨re, 2001; J.-M. BerliÃ¨re, F. Liaigre, 2004), the MBF led its âsurveillanceâ administration past a distinct turning-point in the level of repression. Police action was markedly increased, and the âPortoâ operation, which lasted from October to December 1941, generated hundreds of arrests, mainly among âGaullistâ groups (FMD, Livre-MÃ©morial, 2004, pp. 316-317). Military tribunals became ever more severe, giving out more death and prison sentences, followed by sentences to deportation to the Reich prisons, especially from summer 1941; at least 1,500 persons were deported from July 1941 to the end of November 1942 (FMD, Livre-MÃ©morial, 2004). The MBF courts condemned nearly 500 people to death between August 1941 and May 1942; three-quarters of these sentences of carried out, compared to only a quarter of them during the preceding period (G. Eismann, 2007: 141-142).\n\nIn December 1941, Hitler deemed this judicial action insufficiently severe and dissuasive, yet he asked the OKW to announce the Nacht und Nebel or NN (âNight and Fogâ) decree, which forced military judges in the occupied territories to condemn persons accused of certain acts to death within a week of their arrest (J. de la MartiniÃ¨re, 1989). Alternatively, they had to give up the case to a civilian or military court in the Reich, in which case the persons indicted had to be deported straightaway, before judgment. In order to reinforce the intimidation effect, the decree specified that these persons would disappear in âthe night and the fog,â and that no answer should be made to their familiesâ requests for information. The first deportations of NN prisoners from to the special camp of Hinzert, near the Cologne court, which could judge the accused persons for which the MBF was competent, took place in May 1942 after a second, decisive ordinance for the implementation of the decree was published in mid-April 1942. By late November 1942, a little over 650 NN detainees had been deported from to the Hinzert camp (FMD, Livre-MÃ©morial, 2004; G. QuesnÃ©e, 2004).\n\nBut as attacks against its soldiers and premises were increasing, the MBD launched collective reprisal measures, proceeding to execute hostages and justifying this before the French population. In autumn 1941, a âHostage Codeâ recapitulated and articulated the rules which were supposed to govern the shootings and the choice of victims. This period was an opportunity for the German authorities to radicalize their repressive policy anew. But as early as December 1941, as Hitler deemed the number of hostages shot to be insufficient, the MBF also asked Berlin to also authorize massive reprisal deportation operations, considered more dissuasive (S. Klarsfeld, 1979; C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000; R. Delacor, 2000; A. Meyer, 2002; J.-M. BerliÃ¨re, F. Liaigre, 2004; G. Eismann, 2005).\n\nThough the Communists were the first to be put on the hostage list, Jews were soon added to the catalog of potential victims, especially as of autumn 1941: thus, the German authorities, military or otherwise, were aiming for the âJudeo-Bolshevik enemyâ (S. Klarsfeld, 1979; U. Herbert, 1998; C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000; A. Meyer, 2002; J.-M. BerliÃ¨re, F. Liaigre, 2004). This was borne out by the execution of 95 hostages on December 15, 1941: though three-quarters of the victims were close to Communist circles, over half of them were Jewish. This ideological definition of the hostages to be shot broke with the more traditional one which had previously been in force in occupied France, which targeted the notables of French society.\n\nFrom then on, this choice in the designation of the most important enemy was agreed upon by the military, the police and the diplomatic authorities (respectively the MBF and the OKW in Berlin, the Sipo-SD, and the German embassy in ). This opened the door to instrumentalization of this retaliation policy by the Jewish Affairs department, which led to âreprisalâ deportations. Its representative in , Dannecker, did not pass up this opportunity to launch the âfinal solution of the Jewish questionâ for occupied France, which the RHSA had been preparing (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001). On March 4, 1942, during a meeting in Berlin of the heads of Jewish Affairs departments in France, Belgium and Holland with Eichmann, Dannecker proposed the figure of 5,000 deportees, in addition to the 1,000 whose departure was already planned for the end of March (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 44). This was an ambitious program, whereas the âactual implementation of the principles decided uponâ during the Wannsee conference of January 20, 1942, was supposed to be âvery slow,â as Eichmann had clearly told his representatives. Nothing had âportended an acceleration of the deportations [of Jews] in the year 1942,â and âit was only upon Danneckerâs insistence and his contention that this was necessary in France, that Eichmann consented to suggest to Heydrich that 5,000 Jews be deported from there during the year 1942, whereas no deportation program was being proposed for Belgium or for Holland in the near future.â (F. Brayard, 2004: 109)\n\nIn fact, at the Wannsee inter-ministerial conference, Heydrich had explained to the different protagonists of the âfinal solutionâ that the latter had become a âState policy,â and on the subject of the âappropriate treatmentâ for the Jews that might survive the process, he had endorsed the ânow genocidal character of the Nazi project.â (F. Brayard, 2004: 400, 406). Since mid-August of the previous year, the Einsatzgruppen (\"task forces\" or \"intervention groups,\" which were in fact paramilitary groups formed by Heinrich Himmler and operated by the SS) had executed over 450,000 Jews in the USSR (G. Bensoussan, 1996: 48). But the process presented at Wannsee was also meant to be long, as the âfinal solutionâ could not be initiated immediately âto its full extentâ and âin its ultimate form.â (F. Brayard, 2004: 405) The Jews, beginning with those from the Reich and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (the protectorate Nazi Germany established in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, in what is today the Czech Republic), were first supposed to be transplanted to transit ghettos, then transported further East, to lands that had not yet been conquered at the time of the conference. There, they were to be separated according to gender, and used as forced labor, in a second phase that could âperfectly be assimilated to an âextermination through workâ policy, before the expression had even been invented.â (F. Brayard, 2004: 418) The genocide discussed at Wannsee was complex and gradual, and not exempt from various forms of experimentation, and was supposed to occur initially by way of the terrible conditions the Jews would be forced to live in, and then though murder of the most resistant ones. At the end of January 1942, Himmler began a vast deportation program of 150,000 Jewish workers. During the March 4 meeting mentioned above, Eichmann indicated to Dannecker that the deportees selected for this âhad to be Jewish men under forty-five years of age, fit for labor.â (F. Brayard, 2004, pp. 416-417) But Dannecker was also to meet the MBFâs deportation criteria, and in the guise of a reprisal policy, he obtained authorization to prioritize the departure of Jewish hostages to Auschwitz as early as March 27 and June 5, 1942 (respectively convoys 1 and 2). âThus, though some of the German authorities in France considered deportation as part of the repression policy, to the RSHA, it was an element of both the âfinal solutionâ and Himmlerâs attempt to build up a gigantic industrial complex using Jewish labor.â (F. Brayard, 2004: 417) Therefore, as regards deportation, the repression policy and the âfinal solutionâ overlapped at the time in occupied France (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001; M. Steinberg, Annales E.S.C., 1993; C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000).\n\nBut this instrumentalization or collusion of interests did not prevent these two policies from evolving differently. In December 1941, the MBF had announced reprisal deportations, which were meticulously prepared as of April 1942: thus, the July 6, 1942 convoy left CompiÃ¨gne carrying 1,175 men, essentially Communists and members of the ConfÃ©dÃ©ration gÃ©nÃ©rale du travail or CGT (âGeneral Confederation of Labor,â a French confederation of trade unions) (C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000). Meanwhile, as the Sipo-SD took over the repression policy in June 1942, Danneckerwas able to carry on with his agenda by gradually emancipating himself from the criteria for hostage selection defined until then by the MBF. Though convoys 3, 4 and 5, which left in June, were still in the framework of a retaliation policy, their composition departed more and more from the definition of the âdeportable Jewish hostageâ: women and persons âunfitâ for work, such as the elderly, were part of them (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001; C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000). Dannecker was essentially seeking to complete the program he had announced in March 1942 in Berlin. However, as to the future, Heydrich had not âgiven any indication that the deportation of Jews from France could be accelerated in months to come,â when he had come to in May (F. Brayard, 2004: 417).\n\nHowever, starting in April 1942, in a context aggravated by military losses, which limited their options, the Nazi leadership decided to abandon the âarrangements defined in Wannseeâ and to shift âfrom a political project of extinction to a program of murderâ and immediate and total extermination, with a distinct acceleration in May-June 1942 (F. Brayard, 2004: 436). In the case of France, the selection of victims directly upon their arrival in Auschwitz began with convoy number 7 of July 19; the deportees that were not chosen for labor were gassed immediately.\n\nOn June 11, 1942, another key meeting took place in Berlin, in the premises of Eichmannâs Jewish Affairs department. He had summoned his representatives in France, Belgium and Holland again. This meeting was intended to quickly get the extermination of the Jews of Western Europe underway, by planning a quick death for most people thus deported. As of summer 1942, the heads of Jewish Affairs in these three countries sent convoys off from the transit camps of Drancy in France, Malines in Belgium and Westerbork in Holland, though their methods sometimes differed a great deal.\n\nStill, to begin with, Eichmann opted during the June 11 meeting to draw on the deportation program of 150,000 Jewish workers decided by Himmler in January, though he allowed an additional contingent of victims that were unfit for work to be deported along with the workers. In France, Dannecker worked out the processes for this, as the department he belonged to had just taken over the administration of repression and police matters in the occupied zone. In fact, the hostage issue had affected many different protagonists, since each decision had given rise to many discussions between the various German repressive organizations and with the French authorities, at the highest hierarchical levels. A crisis finally broke out between the military Commander for occupied France, Otto von StÃ¼lpnagel, and Berlin; StÃ¼lpnagel was replaced in February 1942 and on March 9, Hitler decided to appoint a HSSPF (High leader of the SS and the police) within the MBF, Karl Oberg, and to put him in charge of repression â and also, therefore, of the âhostage policyâ â from then on. Oberg took up his post at the end of May. Along with his deputy, Helmut Knochen, he revived the policy of collaboration with the French police: the âOberg-Bousquetâ agreement adopted in late July and presented on August 8 âformalized the close collaboration of [German and French] police forces in the field of repression.â (D. Peschanski, 2004: 321-332) The Sipo-SDâs staff was limited in size and faced with an increase in Resistance activity, as it was trying to achieve relative efficiency in the field of repression, the stakes were high. While constantly trying to meet this primary requirement of security, which also guaranteed effective exploitation of French economic resources, Oberg and Knochen also obtained the Vichy administrationâs collaboration in the arrest and deportation of the Jews of France, during the negotiations; the French authorities agreed to hand over the foreign and stateless Jews, who were considered undesirable. âIn order to launch the decisive phase of mass deportation, the German authorities adapted the anti-Jewish system to the arrangements in force in the society from which they were eliminating Jewsâ: thus, Maxime Steinberg underlined the âxenophobic startâ of this deportation program decided in June 1942 (M. Steinberg, 1993: 585-586). He also reminded that âFrench reticence toward the deportation of Jewish French citizens had yet another repercussion, the outcome of which on deportation policies from all of Western Europe, was much graver. It allowed [the Germans] to overcome the obstacle of the labor criterion, which was still impeding the âfinal solutionâ in the West in July 1942.â Actually, Laval âoffered the SS officers compensation so that they could still receive the same number of persons originally planned,â proposing to include Jewish children under the age of 16. âOn June 11, in the Headquarters of the Reich Security Services [RSHA], only Jews aged 16 to 40 had been considered for labor in Auschwitzâ (M. Steinberg, 1993), though 10% of the deportees on each convoy could be persons unfit for work. âThus, Himmler had identified these deportations with labor.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 69) Accordingly, 12.2% of the persons deported on the nine convoys that had left Drancy between July 19 and August 3 were gassed directly upon arrival because they were unfit for work; this proportion was consistent with the authorized ratio. But at the end of August 1942, the âobstacle of âlaborâ was removed: the regulatory telegram from the Jewish Affairs department in , informing the various Berlin authorities of the departure of convoy number 19 on August 14, specified that âfor the first time, there were childrenâ [under 12 years of age].â (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001: 731; M. Steinberg, 1993)\n\nAfter the June 11 meeting, Danneckerâs unrealistic plan (for the deportation of 100,000 Jews) was revised by Knochen, with Eichmann; the target figure was lowered to 40,000 (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 75). Thus, the âfinal solutionâ deportation program was carried out, even though in fact, the heads of the Nazi police in France did not consider it a priority; they were essentially concerned with meeting their political and security objectives. 38 convoys of Jews headed from France to Auschwitz between mid-July and mid-November 1942 (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001).\n\nInitially, the HSSPFâs takeover of repression did not lead to any change in the hostage policy. However, several executions were carried out at the same time, in order to increase their intimidating impact on French public opinion, and to leave the German and French police forces enough time to locate the culprits. 88 hostages were shot on August 11, 1942 and 116 others on September 21. But these reprisal killings did not put a stop to the attacks against the occupation forces. The population did not approve of them, and furthermore, they were in danger of hindering the requisition of workers planned by the new French law of September 4, 1942; the Reich needed these workers ever more urgently. Hence, the execution planned for October 15 was postponed, then suspended, indicating that the âhostage policyâ had been put on hold (S. Klarsfeld, 1979; S. Choumoff, 1982; Th. Fontaine, 2007).\n\nThus, in a few months, from June to September 1942, the Sipo-SD in power in occupied France took over the administration of several pre-existing projects and altered them. While the MBFâs military courts continued their clampdown (nearly 460 death sentences were handed out following acts of resistance from June 1942 to January 1943, 80% of which were carried out; see G. Eismann, 2007: 152), the Sipo-SD first ensured the completion of the âfinal solutionâ program by deporting about 37,000 Jews from France from mid-July to mid-November 1942. This did not lead to any conflict with the Vichy administration: in September, as the pool of Jews to be deported was running out and RÃ¶thke asked for large numbers of French Jews to be rounded up, Knochen explained to Eichmann that he did not wish to run the risk of âgrave political consequences.â So doing, he obtained Himmlerâs approval on this position: âfor this reason, it will be impossible to evacuate large contingents of Jews,â he concluded (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 195). Lessons were also learned from the hostage crisis, and the Sipo-SDâs repression policy took a turn that led to the recurrent organization of mass deportations that were âpreventiveâ and systematic in character. It was at the end of the year 1942, rather than in June 1942 when the Sipo-SD took over, that there was a real turning point in the German authoritiesâ repressive policies in occupied France. The occupation of the free zone, starting in November 1942, increased the impact of this change still further: from then on, repression and persecution could develop throughout the entire French territory, taking a heavier toll in human lives.\n\nJune 22, 1941: The day of the attack on the Soviet Union, preventive measures were taken against Communist activists in the occupied countries. In France, the Aktion Theodorich operation led to the arrest and internment of nearly 1,300 people in the Royallieu camp, near CompiÃ¨gne. This camp, which was administered by the MBF, was reserved for the detention of âactive enemiesâ of the Reich from then on (C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000:59). ***\n\nAugust 20, 1941: The second operation of mass arrest of Jews took place between August 20 and 23. It was decided by the German military authorities in retaliation for acts against the occupying power. It was âsuggested by Dannecker who was carrying out his program of creation of special camps in the occupied zone, and of filling them with Jews. The ian municipal police was responsible for the implementation of this measure, with the assistance of Feldgendames.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 28) Over 4,200 Jews (men, including 1,500 Frenchmen) were arrested and taken to the new Drancy camp, in the suburbs (R. Poznanski, 1994: 321-330). ***\n\nAugust 21, 1941: Pierre Georges, who was later known as Colonel Fabien, killed a German midshipman named Moser at the BarbÃ¨s metro station in . The military administration immediately announced that French citizens detained for the Germans would be considered hostages, and therefore liable to be shot (D. Peschanski, in Dictionnaire historique de la RÃ©sistance, 2006: 607-608; J-M. BerliÃ¨re, F. Liaigre, 2004). ***\n\nAugust 22, 1941: Under pressure from the German authorities and upon their request, the Vichy government created a special judicial authority to judge âanti-national acts,â especially âCommunist and anarchistâ activity. This law was essentially directed against Communists and was backdated to August 14, so that these special courts would have retroactive jurisdiction. Accordingly, as early as August 27, a âSpecial Sectionâ of the Appellate Court of condemned Emile Bastard, AndrÃ© BrÃ©chet and Abraham Trzebucki to death; they were guillotined the next day. The November 18, 1942 and June 5, 1943 laws broadened the range of persons targeted by these Special Sections, notably to perpetrators of acts of resistance (A. Bancaud, 2002). ***\n\nSeptember 6, 1941: The MBF had the first three French hostages shot after Sergeant Ernst Hoffmann was lightly wounded by gunshot on September 3, 1941 (S. Klarsfeld, 1979). ***\n\nSeptember 7, 1941: The Vichy authorities, who had committed themselves to the execution of six Communists after the first anti-German attacks, promulgated a new law in order to create a State Tribunal for the judgment of all acts against âthe peopleâs security,â with no possibility of an appeal. On September 13, Jean Catelas, the parliamentary representative of the town of Amiens, as well as Adolphe Guyot and Jacques Woog, were condemned to death, and guillotined on September 24 (A. Bancaud, 2002). ***\n\nSeptember 16, 1941: The MBF had 10 hostages executed in retaliation for the September 6, 10 and 12 attacks against Wehrmacht soldiers. Hitler deemed this insufficiently severe, and after a meeting with the main military and police leaders of the Reich in Berlin on August 30, he asked General Field Marshall Wilhelm Keitel for a repressive decree. This decree was signed on September 16 and it concerned the âSeditious Communist movements in the occupied territories.â It required the execution of 50 to 100 Communists in reprisal for the killing of one German soldier, and asked military courts to sentence the perpetrators of acts of resistance to death (S. Klarsfeld, 1979; C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000). ***\n\nSeptember 20, 1941: After an attack four days earlier against a Wehrmacht captain in , the MBF had 12 hostages executed. In order to successfully implement his law enforcement policy, Otto von StÃ¼lpnagel chose not to apply the FÃ¼hrerâs harsh orders systematically (S. Klarsfeld, 1979; C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000; G. Eismann, 2005). ***\n\nSeptember 28, 1941: Von StÃ¼lpnagel edicted a long decree, known as the âHostage Code,â which unified and completed the different arrangements made by the MBF in the field of reprisal killings (C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000; G. Eismann, 2005). ***\n\nSeptember 20 â October 20, 1941: âMore acts of sabotage and attacks took place, but no one was killed among the occupying forces. No hostages were executed. However, the Germans made multiple arrests of persons suspected of âanti-German propaganda,â mostly Communists: between October 6 and 10, 1,600 people were taken into custody in , with help from the French police. Similar operations took place between October 19 and 21 in several dÃ©partements of the occupied zone.â (C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000: 86-87) ***\n\nOctober 20-24, 1941: On the morning of October 20, Lieutenant-Colonel Hotz, the Feldkommandant (German military commander) of the city of Nantes, was shot. The next day, a military administration adviser, Hans Reimers, was killed in Bordeaux. In retaliation for Holzâs death, the German authorities proceeded to executed 48 hostages, essentially from the ChÃ¢teaubriant camp, on October 22; for Reimers, they had 50 more hostages shot at Souges, near Bordeaux (C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000; J-M. BerliÃ¨re, F. Liaigre, 2004; G. Eismann, 2005) ***\n\nNovember 28 â December 5, 1941: While the attacks and acts of sabotage against the occupying power over the previous month had claimed no lives, this time, three German soldiers were killed and five others wounded in the explosion of a ian bar (J-M. BerliÃ¨re, F. Liaigre, 2004). Two days later, a soldier was shot in the streets of Brest. In retaliation, âon December 5, in a telegram to Berlin, Otto von StÃ¼lpnagel suggested the execution of 100 hostages, demanding a 1 billion Franc fine from the Jews of , and the internment, followed by the deportation of 1,000 Jews and 500 young Communists to Eastern Europe.â (C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000: 104) Accordingly, the MBFâs staff organized a mass round-up of ian Jews and counted the Communists in custody (G. Eismann, 2005). ***\n\nDecember 7, 1941: The FÃ¼hrer was still displeased with the repression policy being carried out in the West, and upon his request, Keitel promulgated the Nacht und Nebel decree, which was the logical continuation of the preceding edict, that of September 16. When military courts could not swiftly hand out death sentences to persons that had committed certain acts, and have them executed promptly, they were to be deported in total secrecy, in order to intimidate the French population further (K. Jonca, A. Konieczny, 1981; J. de la MartiniÃ¨re, 1989). **\n\nDecember 10, 1941: The first three persons arrested during the vast operation âPortoâ were deported to the prisons of DÃ¼sseldorf and Essen in Germany, where their cases were to be investigated. This was the first big convoy of persons under investigation who had not been judged yet, sent to Germany. 89 other deportees left France five days later, for the same destination (FMD, Livre-MÃ©morial, 2004, vol. 1: 316-317). *\n\nDecember 12, 1941: The third mass round-up of Jews was carried out in the context of collective reprisal measures taken by the MBF on December 5. 743 Jews, of which almost all were French and many from well-to-do backgrounds, were arrested in by Feldgendarmes and members of the Sipo-SD, assisted by French policemen. 300 detainees selected from Drancy and who had been arrested in August were added to the first contingent in order to reach the predetermined target of 1,000 âdeportableâ Jews. During the night from December 12 to 13, they were taken to the CompiÃ¨gne camp (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001; in addition, see J.-J. Bernardâs testimony in Le Camp de la mort lente, which was re-published in 2005). ***\n\nDecember 15, 1941: 95 hostages, most of which were Communists, were shot according to the planned reprisal measures; over 50 of them were Jews from the Drancy camp. The others were taken from the Romainville fort, the CompiÃ¨gne and ChÃ¢teaubriant camps, and the prisons of Fresnes, Fontevrault and La SantÃ©. Among them were Gabriel PÃ©ri, the former parliamentarian for the town of Argenteuil and editor of the Communist newspaper LâHumanitÃ©, and Lucien Sampaix, the former secretary-general of LâHumanitÃ© (S. Klarsfeld, 1979; C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000; G. Eismann, 2005). ***\n\nDecember 24-27, 1941: MÃ¼ller, the head of the Gestapo (the Nazi Secret State Police) in the Reich, warned the Sipo-SD staff on December 24 and the MBF on December 27 âthat it [was] quite inappropriate to house Jews and French Communists in the same eastbound transit ghetto.â (C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000: 113) Rail transportation was also lacking. The reprisal deportations planned and announced by the MBF were then postponed. Therefore, the 1,000 Jews interned in CompiÃ¨gne remained in one part of the camp, isolated in very harsh conditions, suffering from hunger and exposure, which killed several of them (for instance, see J.-J. Bernardâs testimony in Le Camp de la mort lente, which was re-published in 2005). On December 30, 1941, a decree made CompiÃ¨gne a âGerman police detention camp.â ***\n\nJanuary-February 1942: As the difference of opinion grew between the MBF and Berlin regarding management of the hostage crisis, it led to the departure of Otto von StÃ¼lpnagel, who was replaced by his cousin Karl-Heinrich von StÃ¼lpnagel. After further attacks against German soldiers (9 in January, 45 in February) the executions continued. 46 new hostages were shot in March (S. Klarsfeld, 1979). ***\n\nFebruary 19, 1942: In Riom, the trial of the Third Republic, the Popular Front and the June 1940 defeat began before the members of the Vichy administration who were promoting it. âThe former PrÃ©sidents du Conseil [heads of government] Edouard Daladier and LÃ©on Blum, as well as Guy de la Chambre, Air Force minister from 1938 to 1940, General Gamelin, who had been Army Chief of Staff from 1935, and Robert Jacomet, the former Secretary General of the National Defense ministry, all appeared in court.â The speeches for their defense sounded like an indictment of the Vichy governmentâs position. Hitler himself called for the suspension of the trial; this request was granted on April 11, 1942 (G. Morin, in Dictionnaire historique de la RÃ©sistance, 2006: 610-611). ***\n\nMarch 4, 1942: The âpublicizedâ trial of some young Communist francs-tireurs (Resistance guerrilla fighters) from the 11th arrondissement (district) of began in the French parliament building, before a German military court; seven of them were sentenced to death on March 9. On April 15 and 16, in the Maison de la Chimie, the MBF organized a second trial of this âspectacularâ type, intended to stigmatize âantisocial killersâ; 23 members of the PCFâs Special Organization and âYouth Battalionsâ were shot on April 17, 1942, at the Mont-ValÃ©rien (E. Alary, 2000; A. Meyer, 2002: 103-122; J.-M. BerliÃ¨re, F. Liaigre, 2004). ***\n\nMarch 9, 1942: Hitler decided to appoint a High leader of the SS and the police (HSSPF) within the MBFâs jurisdiction. Karl Oberg, who was chosen in April, became Himmlerâs personal representative in France; more significantly, the âexpiation measuresâ became his responsibility. ***\n\nMarch 27, 1942: Deportation convoy number 1, the first carrying Jews away from France, left from CompiÃ¨gne and was composed of third-class passenger cars. The detachment of German soldiers escorting the convoy was commanded by Dannecker in person. Upon its arrival, 1,112 deportees were registered. Part of them had been arrested during the August 20, 1941 mass round-up in , and others during that of December 12. They were Jewish hostages, fit for labor, whose deportation had been planned by the MBF in December 1941, in retaliation for attacks against the occupation forces. Thus, the first convoy of the âfinal solutionâ was also the first reprisal deportation from the occupied zone. Nearly 92% of the deportees from that train died before the end of August 1942, due to the extreme conditions in Auschwitz (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 47). ***\n\nApril 16, 1942: The Maastricht-Cherbourg train was derailed near Moult-Argences, in the Calvados region; 28 German sailors on leave were killed and 19 others wounded. Hitler ordered exceptional executions and the deportation of 1,000 Communists. A few days earlier, after another series of attacks, he had already decided to systematically supplement the hostage executions with reprisal deportations of Communists, Jews and âanti-social elements.â On April 30, 24 hostages were shot following the Moult attack. But the next night, the Maastricht-Cherbourg train was derailed a second time; 10 German soldiers were killed and 22 more wounded. On May 9, 28 hostages were shot and 80 others from the region of Calvados were deported on the July 6, 1942 convoy. Preparations for this reprisal convoy had started as of April 20 (C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000). ***\n\nApril 18, 1942: Laval returned to power as a result of pressure from German diplomats, who sought to revive the Collaboration policy. In addition to his key role as head of the executive â PÃ©tain having retreated into the background â Laval was also Minister of the Interior, of Information and of Foreign Affairs. From then on, his role consisted in striving to ensure that France would have an important place [une place de choix] by Germanyâs side, in a new Europe struggling against Communism (R. Paxton, 1973-2003). ***\n\nMay 28, 1942: In accordance with the December 1941 decree, the first convoy composed only of Nacht und Nebel detainees (43 men and 9 women) was organized from the occupied zone and left the Gare de lâEst, in . The men were taken to the special camp of Hinzert, near the Cologne court, and the women to Aachen [Aix-la-Chapelle]. They were all supposed to appear before a German court (J. de La MartiniÃ¨re, 1981; FMD, Livre-MÃ©morial, 2004, vol. 1: 370-371). **\n\nMay 29, 1942: The 8th German decree on the subject of anti-Jewish measures was promulgated. It required Jews over six years of age to wear a yellow star in public. It came into force on June 7 (A. Kaspi, 1991; R. Poznanski, 1994). ***\n\nJune 1, 1942: Oberg, who had arrived in in early May, accompanied by Heydrich in person, officially took up his post. ***\n\nJune 5, 1942: The departure of convoy number 2 deporting Jews from France was decided upon in early May in Berlin; the telegram from the RSHAâs department in charge of deportations, notifying Knochen of this, specified that the train would âdeport Communists, Jews and anti-social elements to the East, in retaliation.â (C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000: 138) Dannecker, who had successfully pushed for the Jews to be deported first, composed a list of 1,000 men aged 18 to 54, most of whom were Polish and had been arrested during the May 14 and August 20, 1941 round-up operations, then transferred from Drancy, Beaune-la-Rolande and Pithiviers to CompiÃ¨gne, as hostages around late April or early May. Some of them were unfit for work, which was not compatible with the decrees on hostages. Nearly 80% of the deportees from this convoy died in Auschwitz in ten weeks (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001; G. Eismann, 2005). ***\n\nJune 11, 1942: Eichmann held a meeting of his representatives for Jewish Affairs in France, Belgium and Holland. The systematic deportation program of all the Jews of Europe began at a quick pace. Dannecker suggested a contingent of 100,000 French Jews; when he returned to , it was revised down to around 40,000 by Knochen (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001; F. Brayard, 2004). ***\n\nJune 22, 25 and 28, 1942: The reprisal deportation measures decided by Hitler were upheld by the Sipo-SD, who was now in charge of the repression policy in the occupied zone. As for Dannecker, he was still trying to carry out his program of evacuation of the ian Jews arrested in 1941. Once again, three convoys of 3,000 Jews each, organized in June 1942, departed toward Auschwitz on a retaliatory basis. However, as the MBF was no longer in charge of the process, this time the convoys were organized directly from the internment camps of Drancy on June 22, Pithiviers on June 25 and Beaune-la-Rolande on June 28. The military administrationâs instructions for the constitution of reprisal convoys were no longer a constraint for Dannecker; hence, the deportees selected included women for the first time (66 of them on June 22). 80% of the deportees of the June 22 convoy, which included 430 French citizens, died within seven and a half weeks. Respectively 45% and 30% of the Jews of the two following convoys died in seven weeks. Preparations for the reprisal convoy, composed of Communist hostages, and which had been announced in December 1941, were finished at the end of June (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001; C. Cardon-Hamet, 1997-2000). ***\n\nJuly 2, 1942: During a decisive conference held in with Bousquet, Oberg and Knochen, in view of the Franco-German policing agreements, the Secretary-General of police and Vichy government representative suggested not arresting French Jews, but promised to assist â along with the French police, therefore â in the arrest of foreign Jews âeverywhereâ, i.e. including in the free zone. The nationality criterion became key South of the demarcation line, partly as a result of this Vichy agreement. In fact, on July 2, Bousquet promised to deliver 10,000 foreign Jews interned in the free zone and to arrest 20,000 others in the area (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001). ***\n\nJuly 6, 1942: The Communist hostages, whose deportation had been considered since December 1941 and prepared for since April 1942, were taken away. This was the first mass convoy of deportees arrested owing to a repression measure that left from the occupied zone. It probably included about 1,175 persons who boarded the train to Auschwitz in the CompiÃ¨gne station; about half of them were quickly sent to work in the building sites of the Birkenau camp. After about nine months, only 160 of them were left alive due to the terrible conditions in Auschwitz (C. Cardon-Hamet, 2005). ***\n\nJuly 10, 1942: Oberg promulgated a decree extending the designation of hostages to the family members of âterrorists on the run.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1979) ***\n\nJuly 16-17, 1942: The biggest mass round-up of Jews in France, known as the ârafle du Vel dâHivâ â took place in the area; the targets were foreign Jews. Other similar operations were carried out in the occupied zone, near the cities of Dijon and OrlÃ©ans, for instance. The French police carried out these round-ups. Though the Germans had been counting on the arrest of over 27,000 people, âonlyâ 13,152 were actually detained (according to the definitive tally established by the Prefecture of Police; see S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 136), including over 4,000 children. The French police representatives were trying to avoid the Germansâ falling back on the arrest of French Jews; faced with the âunsatisfactoryâ result of the July 16-17 round-up, they helped the Germans to meet the target numbers of Jews to be deported that had been agreed on in the July 2 accords, by pushing for the deportation of children. This had two advantages: it avoided both the extra internment problems linked to the detention of children and, theoretically, having to separate families. In the meantime, after the round-up, the women and children were sent to the VÃ©lodrome dâhiver, a sports ground in the 15th arrondissement of , where they stayed for several days before they were transferred to transit camps in the dÃ©partement of Loiret (LÃ©vy-Tillard, 1967; S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001; M. Rajsfus, 2002). ***\n\nJuly 17, 1942: Dannecker obtained permission to organize a new convoy from the Pithiviers camp to Auschwitz. Though the literature (especially M. Steinberg and C. Cardon-Hamet) associated this with the deportation program of 6,000 Jews decided in March 1942, the code of this 6th convoy (DA-901-1) indicates that it may have been the first of the new deportation program initiated by the June 11 meeting. In Berlin, the Ministry of Transportation had authorized its implementation from July 13 (S. Klarsfeld, 2001). **\n\nJuly 19, 1942: Another convoy left the Le Bourget train station (near ) in the direction of Auschwitz; it was composed of around 1,000 Jews. These were still mostly persons rounded up in 1941 in the area. For the first time 375 Jews from France, âprobably the oldestâ (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001: 540), were gassed immediately upon their arrival at Auschwitz, after being selected. ***\n\nJuly 20, 1942: Deportation convoy number 8 left Angers, France in the direction of Auschwitz. It was the only convoy to be maintained of all those that Dannecker had initially planned from French provincial towns, before the Oberg-Bousquet agreements on French and foreign Jews. A little over 800 Jews were deported on it, including 200 French citizens who had just been rounded up by the Commander of the Sipo-SD in Angers, in violation of the agreements (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001). ***\n\nJuly 22, 1942: 996 Jews, including 385 women, were sent from Drancy to Auschwitz. This was deportation convoy number 9, and the first one to be composed of persons arrested during the July 16-17 round-ups in . They were all registered upon arrival. The same day, the cardinals and bishops of France met in , under Cardinal Suhard, and broke the silence they had kept till then by signing a document denouncing âthe massive arrests of Israelites.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 139) ***\n\nJuly 31, 1942: The 13th convoy of Jews left Pithiviers. âIt was the first convoy from the Loiret camps that included fathers and mothers arrested during the VÃ©lodrome dâHiver round-up.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001: 626) Of the 1,052 Jews deported, there were 147 mothers accompanied by their children (139) aged 15 to 20, but who âhad to leave their children under 15 years of age behind. The gendarmes had to beat the mothers in order to separate them from these small children and lock them in the rail cars.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 147) The next convoy, number 14, which left Pithiviers on August 3, was almost entirely made up to women (982 out of the 1,034 deportees) who had been separated from their children; 452 of them were gassed directly upon their arrival in Auschwitz. The others may have seen their children arrive three weeks later (between August 17 and 31, in seven convoys) and be sent straight to the Birkenau gas chambers (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 149-150). ***\n\nAugust 7, 1942: Convoy number 16 left Pithiviers, heading to Auschwitz. This was the last of the series of convoys essentially composed of the adult Jews arrested in on July 16 and 17. This last convoy essentially held women, as well as 258 children aged 13 to 15. Three quarters of the members of this convoy were gassed immediately upon arrival, including the children (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001). ***\n\nAugust 10, 1942: Convoy number 17 left Drancy in the direction of Auschwitz, carrying approximately 1,000 Jews, almost all German citizens; over half were women. âThis was the first convoy of deportees from the free zone, who had been turned over to the Nazis by the Vichy authorities,â in accordance with the Bousquet-Oberg accords. They had been sent âfrom the Gurs camp, where many German Jews had been interned in October 1940,â to Drancy on August 6. Three quarters of them were gassed directly upon arrival in Auschwitz (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001: 699). Throughout the month of August, convoy after convoy left the non-occupied zone, heading to Drancy (E. Conan, 1991). ***\n\nAugust 11, 1942: After members of the Main-dâÅuvre immigrÃ©e or MOI (Immigrant Labor Force) threw two grenades at members of the Luftwaffe (German air force), at the Jean Bouin stadium in on August 5, killing 8 of them in the deadliest anti-German attack carried out in occupied , the Sipo-SD had 88 hostages executed at the Mont-ValÃ©rien fort, near (S. Klarsfeld, 1979; J.-M. BerliÃ¨re, F. Liaigre, 2007). ***\n\nAugust 14, 1942: On convoy number 19, which took 1,015 Jews from Drancy to Auschwitz, most of which were Germans in transit from four French camps in the free zone (les Milles, Recebedou, NoÃ© and Rivesaltes), the regulation telex from the Jewish Affairs Department indicated that âfor the first time, there are childrenâ (i.e. children under 12 years of age; see S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001). ***\n\nAugust 17-31, 1942: A series of seven Drancy-Auschwitz convoys deported the children arrested during the July 1942 round-up en masse, together with adults they did not know. In convoy number 20 of August 17, there were 530 children under 16, including 339 under 10; some were only two years old. The following convoy, on August 19, included 373 children under 13; two days later, 544 children under 14 were deported on the next train, convoy number 22, including 11 infants under two years of age. On the August 24 convoy, there were 465 children under the age of 12, including 131 that were less than six years old (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001). ***\n\nAugust 26, 1942: In three days, the French police arrested over 6,500 Jews in the free zone (this was less that what the Jewish Affairs Department had expected) and quickly transferred them to Drancy. The French populationâs reaction was very negative; in response to such strong emotion, on August 30, the bishop of Montauban, Monsignor ThÃ©as, had a strongly-worded letter against the deportation read in every church of the diocese. Counting the Jews from camps in the free zone turned over to the Nazis in August, the Vichy authorities supplied the Germans with nearly 10,000 Jews âin under a month,â essentially foreigners (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 174; P. Laborie, 1993; R. Poznanski, 1994: 401-419). ***\n\nOn the same day, a new convoy, number 24, left Drancy en route to Auschwitz. It was âthe first of a long series of convoys that lasted until the end of the year 1942, the deportees of which were sorted twice. The first selection generally took place near Kosel, in the vicinity of Auschwitz: the Germans took most of the able-bodied male deportees off the trains and put them to work in camps such as Blechammer, Johannisdorf, Kochanowitz, Oderberg, Gogolin, Ottmuth, etc. The SS in had probably informed the SS general inspectors in charge of the camps that the Vichy authorities were sending them convoys that included large, valuable contingents of young workers, which would have led the Berlin authorities to temporarily send this work force to camps where it could probably be useful. Survivors of this category, from France and Belgium, were gathered by the Germans in Blechammer in late March 1944, this time, they were registered in Auschwitz.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001: 879-880) ***\n\nAugust 30, 1942: From this point on, the Sipo-SD gathered the hostages from the area by at the fort of Romainville, which did not hold more than 200 prisoners after that (Th. Fontaine, 2005, 2007). ***\n\nSeptember 2, 1942: Laval met with Oberg in ; though he made a commitment to turn over the remaining stateless Jews, he asked the German authorities not to make any further, new demands on him in terms of anti-Jewish policy. For that point on, the reactions of public opinion mattered (P. Laborie, 1990 and 1992). The Nazi police authorities accepted this request in order to ensure that their political collaboration with the French government, which was still considered a priority, would remain harmonious. At the Jewish Affairs department, RÃ¶thke had to find other ways to implement the enormous deportation program he was considering for September-October (with a target of around 52,000 deportees). As early as September 16, after he received authorization to arrest them, RÃ¶thke organized the deportation of the Latvian, Bulgarian, Yugoslav and Dutch Jews arrested two days previously in , on convoy number 33. On September 23, he launched another massive deportation of French Jews (at least 540 people) on convoy number 36, in disregard of the agreements with the Vichy authorities. On the 24th, with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairsâs approval, RÃ¶thke and the French police organized a mass round-up of nearly 800 Romanian Jews and their children, who were French citizens. They were deported on convoys numbers 37 and 38, respectively on September 25 and 28; most of them were gassed at Birkenau just a few days after their arrest (S. Klarsfeld, 1978-2001). ***\n\nSeptember 21, 1942: In retaliation for various attacks that had taken place since mid-August, including one outside the Rex cinema theater (three German soldiers were killed), the Sipo-SD had 46 hostages executed at the Mont-ValÃ©rien fort, and 70 others simultaneously at Souges, near Bordeaux (S. Choumoff, 1982; Th. Fontaine, 2005, 2007; J.-M. BerliÃ¨re, F. Liaigre, 2007). On the same day, over 500 French Jews, who had been categorized as âof undetermined nationalityâ by the Jewish Affairs department, were deported on convoy number 35, which left Pithiviers in the direction of Auschwitz. ***\n\nSeptember 25, 1942: Knochen refused a mass round-up of French Jews that the Jewish Affairs department had contemplated organizing in order to compose the convoys planned for October. This position, which preserved the established political relationship of collaboration with Vichy was confirmed by a telex from Himmler to Oberg. The deportation program for October was canceled, and on September 30, 1942, convoy 39 left the station of Le Bourget-Drancy, heading to Auschwitz with âonlyâ 211 deportees on board. The contingent of Jews available for deportation was no longer sufficient, but for âprestige reasons,â RÃ¶thke had still decided to have the convoy leave. It was essentially made up of elderly people over 55 years of age, from Belgium and Holland; 56 were selected for labor upon arrival, and the others were gassed (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001). ***\n\nOctober 9-10, 1942: The different Kommandos (units) of the Sipo-SD in the regions of provincial French carried out operations to arrest the foreign Jews who were now part of the groups to be deported (Bulgarians, Yugoslavs, Belgians, etc.). Almost 2,000 people were then on hand for transfer to Drancy, where 600 Jews were also available. Convoys were immediately planned for November (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001). ***\n\nOctober 19, 1942: On October 15, the II Pol section of the Sipo-SD suggested having 114 detainees shot in retaliation for different anti-German attacks that had taken place since September 21 (one German was killed at the Gare de lâEst train station, and another at the Maillot-Palace), the date of the last reprisal execution. But on the 19th, this execution was suspended for political and timing reasons (S. Klarsfeld, 1979). The main point was not to impede the recruitment of laborers for work in Germany. In fact, an August 22, 1942 directive had already set off the implementation of a recruitment plan called âSauckel,â after the man in charge of recruitment in the territories occupied by the Reich. But most of all, the Vichy government, which was opposed to mass executions, had promulgated a law âfor the use and orientation of the labor forceâ on September 4, 1942 (B. Garnier/J. Quellien/F. Passera, 2003). ***\n\nNovember 4-11, 1942: The deportation of the Jews of France began again. The Jews arrested outside of the capital in October were carried away on two convoys, numbers 4 and 6. The Greek Jews, whose arrest had just been authorized, were rounded up on November 5, then deported on the 9th and the 11th, in two new convoys to Auschwitz. After this, Knochen warned Eichmann than the deportations would have to be halted until February 1943 (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001). ***\n\nNovember 11, 1942: The free zone was occupied by the German army in retaliation for the Anglo-American landing in North Africa three days earlier. Italian troops quickly took control of the Alpine dÃ©partements. Sipo-SD Kommandos were established in this new German âoperation zone.â The Vichy government had less and less latitude to act autonomously. ***\n\nDecember 1942 â August 1943: as massive deportation began to be used as a repressive measure, the âfinal solutionâ convoys continued to leave France\n\nThe year 1942 ended with a pause in massive executions of hostages. But this decision did not settle the issue of what was to become of these people. The Sipo-SD elected to deport them to concentration camps as SchutzhÃ¤ftlinge (âsecurity detainees,â i.e. extra-judicial political prisoners), but in a specific manner, by using the guarantee of secrecy that the Nacht und Nebel (NN) decree offered. Since it did not intend to have these people tried, it was actually taking advantage of the NN label to secretly send thousands of detainees to concentration camps in the Reich, as of March 1943 (Th. Fontaine, 2007). Nevertheless, NN prisoners due to be tried before a Reich court continued to be deported to the special camp of Hinzert until September 1943. Finally, the deportation to Reich prisons of persons who had already been found guilt by a military court bore witness to the fact that judicial repression by the MBF was as severe as ever (FMD, 2004 ; G. Eismann, 2005).\n\nBy the end of 1942, the Sipo-SD was also officially assured that it could put suspects in administrative detention without necessarily using the usual procedure, which was still in force, that of a trial before a military court (Eismann, 2007: 149). Faced with overcrowding of the internment locations available, as well as with the risk involved in maintaining large groups of prisoners behind German lines in the event a second front were opened, interning ever greater numbers of prisoners in occupied France became both an impracticable and an undesirable option. Hence, most people arrested were destined to be deported from France as Schutzhaft prisoners.\n\nBut this repressive choice was also linked to the turning point the Nazi concentration system had gone through in the spring of 1942. âAs of 1942, the Nazis understood that contrarily to what they had planned, the war would last a long time, and that they would have to wage it in a situation of demographic and economic inferiority.â (Y. Le Maner, 2005: 127) From that point on, the concentration camp detainees had to work for the Reichâs war economy (many examples of this are to be found in M. Fabreguet, 1999; R. Steegmann, 2005; B. Streibel, 2005). The occupied zones became manpower reserves, at a period when the vast majority of Germans had been called up to the front. A December 14, 1942 decree from Himmler, asking the various police forces in the Reich and the occupied territories to send 35,000 âdetainees fit for workâ to the camps (initially by February 1943, but later by June), led to the departure for 6 convoys from France between January and June 1943, deporting a total of nearly 7,000 people (Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal, Nuremberg, 1949; FMD, 2004; E. Rimbot, 2006).\n\nOver the same period, the deportation of the Jews of France resumed, after a phase during which no convoys had been organized, from mid-November to early February 1943. However, the recommencement of deportation was seriously âhindered by the resolutely pro-Jewish attitude of the Italian authorities, as well as the reluctance of the Vichy government, without whose cooperation the mass arrests were impossible.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 209) The Italians now occupied eight dÃ©partements of the southern zone of France, and precisely at this point, it appeared that their difference of opinion with the German authorities, as well as with the Vichy government, on the âJewish issue,â was considerable. Thus, thousands of Jews fled from the areas occupied by the Germans to the Italian zone, temporarily finding shelter there. In addition, RÃ¶thkeâs other means for obtaining the arrest of Jews, which was the de-naturalization law under consideration, which would have made thousands of French Jews âdeportableâ (by stripping them of their French nationality) was constantly being put off by the Vichy authorities, who were now attentive to public opinion and to the unmistakable criticism from the Catholic Church hierarchy (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001; A. Cohen, 1993). Yet consistently with their initial political line, Oberg and Knochen were still loath to sacrifice their priority of keeping order in France â and, therefore, their necessary collaboration with the Laval government â in order to move the âJewish issueâ forward in an extremist direction, which the French government would refuse. On February 12, 1943, Knochen sent a note to MÃ¼ller, the head of the Gestapo throughout the Reich, in which he again opposed the deportation of the French Jews. He reminded MÃ¼ller of the âcomplex realities of the political context of the Jewish issue in France.â (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001: 228) In July, when it became obvious that the Vichy authorities did not intend to proceed to massively strip French Jews of their citizenship, Knochen restrained his Jewish Affairs Department once again, as it was attempting to organize a mass round-up of French Jews using only German police forces. During the first semester of 1943, this Department continued to arrest foreign and APATRIDE Jews, especially in , thanks to the help of French police forces; it also asked the provincial Sipo-SD Kommandos to send them as many such persons as possible. In addition, some Jews were also arrested in the context of reprisal operations which, thus, extended beyond the year 1941.\n\nJanuary 13, 1943: Upon the German authoritiesâ request, prefect Parmentier ordered mass arrests of French Jews in Normandy, implementing new reprisal measures following the murder of a Wehrmacht officer in the Rouen train station the day before. On January 16, 222 people were thus transferred to Drancy, including 170 French citizens (S. Klarsfeld, 1983-2001). ***\n\nJanuary 22-27, 1943: Upon Himmlerâs request, the Germans carried out a vast military/policing operation to destroy the Vieux Port neighborhood of the French city of Marseilles. Its entire population was âfiltered.â Hundreds of people were arrested and transferred to the CompiÃ¨gne camp, in view of their deportation; among them were around 800 Jews (C. Oppetit, 1993; Ryan, 1996; A. Meyer, 2002: 143-158). ***\n\nJanuary 15-28, 1943: In Nantes, in a trial known as that of âthe 42 [accused]â (âles 42â), the military court of Feldkommandantur 518 sentenced 37 persons from the local Francs-tireurs partisans FranÃ§ais or FTPF, (the \"Partisan irregular riflemen,\" Resistance fighting formations created by the PCF) to death; most of them had been arrested since summer 1942 by the French authorities. They were treated as âcriminals,â as the German judges focused on elements such as the murder of the French juge dâinstruction (committing magistrate) initially in charge of the case against them, in the middle of the Palais de Justice (courthouse) (F. Liaigre, 2007; see also S. Defoisâ forthcoming paper âLe ProcÃ¨s des 42, Nantes, janvier 1943. Propagande et criminalisation de la rÃ©sistance communiste,â given at the Fondation de la Maison des Sciences de lâHomme seminar entitled Autour des guerres mondiales. Ordre civil et ordre militaire : les limites de la justice militaire, 1914-1955). In terms of the number of death sentences served, this was probably the deadliest trial of the whole of the Occupation. **\n\nJanuary 24, 1943: Over 1,500 men and 230 women were taken from CompiÃ¨gne into the German Reich, on the second mass convoy of deportees arrested in the framework of repressive measures to leave the occupied zone; the first had left on July 6, 1942. The rail cars of the convoy were separated at Halle, once it was past the German border. The men were sent to the Sachsenhausen camp, near Berlin, where most of them were put to work in the Heinkel factory Kommando (unit of workers), for the German war effort (E. Rimbot, 2006). The women, including Danielle Casanova and Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier (two famous French Communist activists and members of the Resistance), were sent to Auschwitz, where the conditions were terrible, partly due to a typhoid fever epidemic. By April 10, only 70 of them were still alive. The persons put on the convoy at CompiÃ¨gne were mostly Communists, and many of them had been arrested in the context of the hostage policy. But at least as far as the men were concerned, this convoy was also linked to the deportation policy determined by Himmlerâs December 1942 decree for the supply of camps with slave labor. This was probably why the Germans forced a few dozen Gypsies onto the train; they were the only ones deported from the occupied zone (C. Delbo, 1965; D. Peschanski, 2004; FMD, 2004; Th. Fontaine, 2005; E. Rimbot, 2006). **\n\nFebruary 9-13, 1943: The interruption of the deportation of the Jews of France had lasted about three months. But then three convoys were planned in early February. The first, number 46 (t"
