        "text": "“It’s the type of band that keeps people on the floor all night,\n\n… only to demand one encore after another.”\n\nSaddle Up…this band’s name cannot be any more descriptive in the style of music it represents.\n\nSaddle Up’s become the hottest, high-energy country rock band in Pittsburgh’s 7-county region. Examples of high status gigs include performing at the Pittsburgh Steelers Training Camp, headlining county fairs and sharing the stage with country stars Craig Morgan, Brett Eldredge, Chris Cagle, Travis Tritt, and Brad Paisley.\n\nIt all began with front man and lead singer Mike Garris, and his quest to find the perfect combination of professional musicians for the band. Mike’s passion, dedication and determination to find the best of the best lead him to drummer Jim Spillar, rhythm guitarist Gary Hill, lead guitarist Jay Pfeifer, bassiest Bob Lunieski, and Jay Casper on keys.\n\nThese 5 individuals create a unique style of country with rock-like edge. Music lovers from both country and rock n’ roll genres enjoy and appreciate the sounds of Saddle Up.\n\nTight, dynamic, and punchy bass and drums; blazing guitar riffs; in-your-face rhythm guitars with dual melodies … and an entertaining front man who knows how to embrace and work a crowd. This rocking country sensation has created a loyal following wherever they play. People of all ages just can’t seem to get enough of the band.\n\nAnd when it comes to fan appreciation – its fans are a top priority for Saddle Up. It’s evident during every performance as well as in its daily communication and promotions across social media.\n\nWhether it’s a corporate event, casino event, headlining a county fair, raising thousands of dollars for a charity, or sharing the stage with a national artist, Saddle up provides the highest and most energetic country rock show that people of all ages can enjoy."
