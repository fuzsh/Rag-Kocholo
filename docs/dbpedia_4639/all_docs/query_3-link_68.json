        "text": "Mercer County, PA, home to a variety of amazing sites and adventures, is also the hometown of celebrities such as rock musician Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.\n\nFrom Mercer County to Leading a Rock Revolution\n\nTrent Reznor was born in 1965 in Mercer, PA. He is known worldwide as the founder of Nine Inch Nails, where he performs as the lead vocalist, principal songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist.\n\nHe founded the band in 1988 and was the sole member until 2016 when Atticus Rose, an English musician and frequent collaborator of Reznor’s, became a permanent member. Many argue that Reznor, a two-time Grammy winner, helped lay the groundwork for the industrial rock revolution, making him a music icon in the genre.\n\nReznor is a 1983 Mercer High graduate and studied computer engineering at Allegheny College. His alma mater honored him by inducting him into their alumni hall of fame.\n\nHe has also produced several albums for Marilyn Manson and the soundtrack for the movies “Natural Born Killers” and “Lost Highway.” He is also known for producing the scores to movies such as “The Social Network,” “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,” and “Gone Girl.”\n\nNine Inch Nail fans can visit Trent Reznor’s hometown and see where the Rockstar grew up while enjoying the adventure and charm of Mercer County.
