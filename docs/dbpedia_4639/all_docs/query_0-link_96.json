        "text": "Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Laurel Region is excited to announce the return of THE CLARKS for their annual benefit concert!\n\nWith Special Guests Gene The Werewolf\n\nEarly on, The Clarks were once described as a bunch of out-of-tune country hicks. The band took irreverent offense to the comments, saying they were never country hicks. Eleven studio albums and a couple of guitar tuners later, The Clarks have struck again with Madly in Love At The End Of The World, a lively ride down a rural lane, laced with love, mourning, and questions about where it all goes from here.\n\nTickets: $28-50\n\nProceeds benefit Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Laurel Region\n\nLearn more at bbbslr.org or find them on Facebook!"
