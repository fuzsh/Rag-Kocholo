We book shows under our name throughout the year and also were given a venue by the city at which we host benefit shows quarterly. If bands are coming through but it doesn't line up with our events, we can do a live performance, interview, and video shoot at my studio (or a local rooftop!), which airs on our local NPR affiliate 88.1 WDIY. This is a great way to get new artists coming through town and leaving with content as well as mingling with some of the local bands here. This is all free of course, my studio is commercial but these sessions are done just for the sake of DIY.
