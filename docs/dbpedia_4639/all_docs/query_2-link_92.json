Detailed information is available at this link!\n\nhttps://www.avalochfarmmusic.org/pittsburgh-new-music-ensemble\n\nWe will be digging deep into the art of interpretation and learning how to study deeply, working on all aspects of rehearsing and musical leadership, and working directly with the incredible composer Ivette Herryman Rodríguez, with whom we are collaborating to help put together a national consortium for a new work written specifically for younger string musicians to be premiered by the participants back in their home communities!\n\nAvaloch will be an amazing place to do some GREAT work together. They will provide full room and board, including 3 meals a day provided by Avaloch’s incredible professional chefs Lacey Tokash and Sean Gravel! For our inaugural 2024 launch, we are offering the incredible first year tuition price of only $750 per person for the courses for the whole week! Room and board will be an additional $1080 per person.\n\nWe will start taking deposits to hold your space starting on March 1. We can only accept 25 participants for this incredible and unique opportunity! The remainder of the balance for tuition, and the room and board fees will be due on May 1 .\n\nArrive anytime on June 17 (dinner provided), and depart on June 23 (breakfast provided).\n\nTo hold your space for our retreat please click here on the link below submit your non-refundable $500 deposit. Select the appropriate amount, and also make a note in the available field that you are making the payment toward the Herertic’s Guide retreat!
