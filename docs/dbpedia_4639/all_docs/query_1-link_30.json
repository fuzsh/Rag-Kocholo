        "text": "A stage where students shine\n\nYork College offers options for bachelor's- and master's-level degree programs that support students in matching their passions with a future career path. Opportunities for hands-on experience in live performance, production, management, marketing, and more give Spartans an inside look at the music and entertainment industries — and with a wide variety of public performances happening every semester, students in these programs are able to give back to the community through vibrant cultural events.\n\nPerformance Ensembles and Opportunities\n\nThere's no shortage of opportunities for York students who want to hone their craft and practice their skills as a performer. From performance ensembles offering course credit to community groups, you'll have the opportunity to get on stage and work with fellow creatives.\n\nCommunity Orchestra\n\nThe York College Community Orchestra is comprised of members of the YCP student body, as well as musicians from the community. This ensemble performs twice a year in the Waldner Performing Arts Center (WPAC). The group's repertoire ranges from major symphonic works to lighter classics.\n\nGroove Ensemble\n\nThe Groove Ensemble performs an eclectic repertoire from around the world. Recent concerts have included arrangements of Indonesian and African music, along with pieces by Steve Reich, Bob Marley, Jeff Beck, and Led Zeppelin. The ensemble's instrumentation is similarly eclectic, encompassing all sorts of percussive objects — not only drums and mallet instruments, but also silverware, buckets, and the human body.\n\nJazz Ensemble\n\nThe Jazz Ensemble is an auditioned, student-based group that performs repertoire from jazz's greatest composers, including Count Basie, Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, and many others. The ensemble balances big band arrangements with solo improvisations.\n\nOpera and Musical Theatre Workshop\n\n‌Opera/Musical Theatre Workshop is a performance-based ensemble that is open to any major. The fall semester is a non-auditioned class with open enrollment to all students. It provides a workshop environment, dedicated to developing individual skills associated with auditioning and performing on stage.\n\nThe spring semester is dedicated to a fully produced musical production in the Waldner Performing Arts Center. Auditions are traditionally held in November for the following spring.\n\nRock Band\n\nThis experiential learning class is dedicated to performing standard repertoire of the classic rock and pop genres. Students are expected to learn a number of standard cover songs to perform for an audience, with one section acting as a cover band that performs classic rock and pop throughout the local community. The second section functions as a \"tribute band,\" paying tribute to a different group or artist every semester. Past examples include Pink Floyd, the Beatles, and Black Sabbath.\n\nVoca Bella\n\nVoca Bella is York College's all-women's vocal ensemble. While some singing experience is expected, it is not required. The group is dedicated to the study and performance of treble choral literature from many traditions and style periods. Voca Bella performs regularly on campus and in the surrounding area.\n\nWind Symphony\n\nThe Wind Symphony is a concert band open to experienced instrumentalists who desire to develop a higher degree of musicianship and to master performance skills. Music majors with a wind instrument as their primary applied area of study participate in this ensemble every semester until completing their degree. The ensemble is also open to non-music majors.\n\nYCPrep Community Music School\n\nBecome the best \"total musician\" you can be at the YCPrep Community Music School. Our professional faculty and state-of-the-art facilities offer students of all ages and abilities the opportunity to develop their musical potential to its highest level.\n\nYork College Chorale\n\nThe Chorale is comprised of dedicated student singers, and the group maintains a rigorous weekly rehearsal schedule. The group's repertoire ranges from the great classics to contemporary folk song settings, and often includes joint performances with instrumental ensembles. The Chorale performs both on- and off-campus and is open to all students with a serious interest in choral music.\n\nYork Music Group\n\nYork Music Group serves as a hub for music production, recording, and entertainment business experience for York College students and the campus community. Facilities and services include state-of-the-art studios, a student-led record label, the Music Industry Student Association, and more.\n\nUpcoming Events and Performances\n\nMeet the Faculty\n\nView All Faculty\n\nErin C. Lippard, D.M.A.\n\nSchool of the Arts, Communication and Global Studies\n\nMatthew Inkster, D.Mus (Performance)\n\nChair, Performing and Visual Arts\n\nSchool of the Arts, Communication and Global Studies\n\nKenneth M.
