        "text": "Dennis Doyle\n\nDennis Doyle is a Celtic harpist who has been featured at the Pittsburgh Irish Fest for over twenty years. His delightful program of traditional Irish harp music, stories, songs, bits of history and jokes have been performed all over North America, Japan and Ireland. Teachers and musicians run in his family which originally hails from County Wicklow, Ireland.\n\nDennis has produced over ten recordings and has two published books on Celtic and liturgical music. The most recent recording is Swift River. In addition to playing on the show stages, he also helps organize and perform in the festival liturgy each year.\n\nThough based in California, Dennis has deep personal roots in Fayette County, Pennsylvania where his grandfather William Doyle worked the mines around Uniontown. His own father, Mark Doyle, was born in Connellsville before the post-war family exodus to Los Angeles in 1949.\n\nhttp://english.glendale.cc.ca.us/doyle.a.html\n\nGaelic Storm\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a band just coming into their own after 20 years of success, but that’s exactly what makes a true anomaly. This multi-national, Celtic juggernaut grows stronger with each live performance, and as you can imagine, after two decades and over 2000 shows, it is a true force to be reckoned with. With their latest release, Go Climb a Tree, their music has never sounded more representative of themselves as musicians and as live performers.\n\nThe band attributes their continued success to their fanatic audience, and it’s a well-diversified crowd for sure. The country-music folks adore the storytelling, the bluegrass-heads love the instrumentals, Celtic fans love their devotion to tradition, and the rockers simply relish the passion they play their instruments with. Each band member, in their own way, expresses a deep gratitude for their fans, but it’s best summed up in the words of Patrick Murphy: “The fans are the ones that have given us this life. We’re here for them.”\n\nOn Go Climb a Tree, co-founders of Gaelic Storm, Steve Twigger and Patrick Murphy, along with longtime friend and co-writer Steve Wehmever, are again at the helm of song-writing duties. The album has everything—party drinking songs (“The Beer Song”), patriotic anthems (“Green, White and Orange”), beautiful folk songs (“Monday Morning Girl”), spritely instrumentals “”The Night of Tomfoolery”), perfectly poppy songs (“Shine On”), and even a raucous pirate song (“Shanghai Kelly”). When speaking of the overall concept of the album, Patrick Murphy gives some insight: “With all the craziness and division in the world, we wanted to make an album about ‘contemplative escapism.’ Go Climb a Tree certainly isn’t about dropping out of the conversation, it’s just about taking a short hiatus to recharge the batteries before you take on the world again.”\n\nGaelic Storm takes a true blue-collar, hard-nose approach to touring, consistently traveling the US and internationally over 200 days a year, forging a unique path in the Celtic music world. “You have to see us live. We are the true working-mans’ band,” says Ryan Lacey, who joined the lineup in 2003. “We still, and most likely always will, tour most of the year, and that’s how we constantly hone our craft.”\n\nThe dedication to live shows date all the way back to the mid-1990s, when Gaelic Storm kicked off its career as a pub band in Santa Monica, California. Due to their discovery at the pub, by the end of the decade, the musicians had appeared in the blockbuster film Titanic (where they performed “Irish Party in Third Class”). This laid the groundwork for a career that would eventually find them topping the Billboard World Chart six times, making appearances at mainstream music festivals, and regularly headlining the largest Irish Festivals across the country, all the while gaining a reputation as a genre-bending Irish rock band, whose songs mix Celtic traditions with something uniquely creative.\n\nLooking to the future, Gaelic Storm is excited about what lies ahead. In 2022, they were excited to welcome Natalya Kay, an incredible fiddler hailing from Western Massachusetts, but living now in Music City, Nashville, TN. Natalya’s energy and presence on stage has been a force to be reckoned with.\n\nhttps://www.gaelicstorm.com/\n\nScreaming Orphans\n\nScreaming Orphans, an all-sister band from Bundoran, Co. Donegal, Ireland, are one of the most sought-after Celtic bands with a powerful, award-winning sound combining their original melodic pop songs with a unique take on traditional Irish music and song. The band first came to prominence when Sinéad O’Connor asked them to tour with her as her back up vocalists and opening act.\n\nThe band is renowned for their trademark spine-tingling four-part harmony which led them to many collaborations with artists such as Sinéad O’Connor, Joni Mitchell, The Chieftains, Baaba Maal, the Afro Celt Sound system, Eileen Ivers and Martin Furey.\n\nScreaming Orphans’ 2019 pop album, Life in a Carnival, produced by internationally distinguished producer John Reynolds, charted No. 24 in the iTunes Pop Music charts (U.S.), No. 7 in the Billboard World Albums charts, No. 1 in the iTunes Singer/Songwriter charts (IE), and No. 3 in the overall iTunes music charts (IE). The new album follows 2017’s critically acclaimed folk album Taproom which also charted at the top of iTunes and Billboard charts and was voted Folk/Pop/Rock Album of The Year.\n\nAs of this year, the band has released 14 albums of both original pop and Folk/Irish music.\n\nhttp://www.screamingorphans.com\n\nSean Patrick Regan\n\nSean Patrick Regan is a third-generation piper.
