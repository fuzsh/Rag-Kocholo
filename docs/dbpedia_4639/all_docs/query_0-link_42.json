        "text": "Music\n\nFriday, July 12 — Main Stage\n\n8 to 9:30 pm — Washington Symphony Orchestra\n\nSaturday, July 13 — Main Stage\n\nDaytime performances:\n\nMVAA Fife & Drum Band unit will not only be in the history march at noon, but they will take the main stage at 12:30 pm on Saturday, July 13th to kick off our music lineup! Mon Valley Academy for the Arts, Inc.\n\nFaire May Music's three members, Zac Gordon, Jariel Henthorn, and Jacob Coughlan, collaborate to bring old-world music to the modern world. You will hear anything from banjos to bagpipes, jaw harps and beyond. The band loves to play music in the genres of Appalachian, Irish, Scottish, Italian, Bluegrass, Early American, and Appalachian. In addition to our usual concerts, Faire May also specializes in historical music from the 18th, and 19th centuries. The band is able to accurately demonstrate music from America's past while also authentically portraying garb from the colonial and Victorian Eras. Faire May goes on stage at 1:30 pm.\n\nWhiskey Drinks are a seasoned group of musicians who blend jam, bluegrass, and folk genres in their unique musical cocktail. They push musical boundaries with a bold mix of original, traditional, and cover songs, giving a great reason to toast another round. The Whiskey Drinks will perform at 3 pm on July 13th.\n\nEvening performances:\n\nJoe Mattzie will entertain the crowd at 7 pm before the Main Act begins at 8 pm. Joe is an award-winning songwriter as well as an accomplished guitarist and singer. Growing up in Pittsburgh PA, Joe began playing music at the age of five and has surrounded himself with acoustic music styles his whole life.\n\nThe Clarks are the 2024 headliner. Early on, The Clarks were once described as a bunch of out of tune country hicks. The band took irreverent offense to the comments, saying they were never country hicks. Eleven studio albums and a couple of guitar tuners later, The Clarks have struck again with Madly In Love At The End Of The World, a lively ride down a rural lane, laced with love, mourning, and questions about where it all goes from here. The band recorded the eleven song album in a converted A-frame church, which helped highlight a series of warm, rock and Alt-Country tunes.\n\nWith a highlight reel that includes the Late Show with David Letterman, The Simpsons, and others, The Clarks are enjoying their stage time together now more than ever. “It’s one big extended family,” says guitarist Rob James. “Dave’s son Noah plays on this album, and with us live, so saying that isn’t just a metaphor, it’s fact!” Singing and playing the songs of Madly In Love At The End Of The World has rekindled a fire in The Clarks’ sometimes broken, sometimes mended hearts.\n\nThe Clarks are:\n\nGreg Joseph: Bass Guitar, Vocals\n\nScott Blasey: Lead Vocals, Electric & Acoustic Guitars\n\nRobert James: Electric & Acoustic Guitars, Vocals\n\nDavid Minarik, Jr.: Drums, Vocals.\n\nStreet Theater\n\nSaturday, July 13 — Main Street\n\nThe historical theatre troupe will be performing six acts right on Main Street, past Strawberry Alley, closer to the Bradford House."
