        "text": "The University of Pennsylvania Band\n\nThe Penn Band was founded in 1897 and ever since has been one of the University’s most progressive student-led traditions. The organization is a part of the Department of Athletics at the University of Pennsylvania; like most of the other 60+ performing arts groups on the Penn Campus, the Penn Band has no affiliation with any academic department and is sponsored by University Life. The organization today is almost 120 members-strong and stands among the largest and most active student-led organizations on-campus, rehearsing and performing upwards of 100+ times during the academic year and serving as the guardians of All Things Red and Blue."
