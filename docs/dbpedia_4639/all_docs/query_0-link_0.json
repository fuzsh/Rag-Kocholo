        "text": "It is not a secret that composing or playing music is a tough way to make a living. According to Rolling Stone, artists keep only 12% of the revenue generated from music from the collective of streaming, concerts, radio play, CD/album sales and advertising. Moreover, the Wall Street Journal reports that for concerts, the top 1% of artists generate 60% of overall revenue, leaving only a small slice of the pie for the other 99%. Artists also face unfavorable revenue structures from streaming while the presence of YouTube and other social media “sharing” sites make it difficult for most artists to capitalize on the intellectual property that is their music.\n\nGiven all of the above obstacles and the fact that the overall music industry revenues have declined by about half of its peak size, it is rare to hear about working bands staying together and making a living over a period of decades. However, Pittsburgh based rockers The Clarks are illustrative of how it is possible for a band to make it with the help of following sound marketing practices and having a customer orientation. Of course, outstanding talent is a prerequisite, but as the videos linked to this article illustrate, the Clarks have four world-class musicians in the band (any readers who enjoy rock, pop, country, or combinations thereof are encouraged to play the videos).\n\nFormed at Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1986, the Clarks, consisting of Scott Blasey on vocal/guitars, Greg Joseph on bass, Rob James on lead guitar and David Minarik, Jr. on drums, are now in their 33rd year of putting out albums and touring. No doubt, the band has had major accomplishments, including: appearing on Late Night With David Letterman; having their cover of \"A Wonderful World\" licensed for the opening episode of a season of the Simpsons; playing as the featured band at the NHL’s Winter Classic; headlining festivals drawing into the tens of thousands of people; and playing on bills with several high profile acts. Collectively, the band has sold more than 500,000 albums in its career and has now reached over 10 million Spotify plays in addition to having a very high volume of YouTube views.\n\nWhile the band has arguably has achieved more regional than national recognition, they are legendary in Pittsburgh. To some of us, given how good the music is, it is difficult to understand why they did not hit it even bigger. Yet, the Clarks are clearly a success story. Frontman Blasey cites togetherness and passion for the music as major factors in the band’s longevity. “We love each other and we love what we do. We’re proud of the music we’ve created together and we still enjoy playing it live,” he says, ”We’re grateful to be able to do this for a living. And we’ve never reached a high enough level of financial success that we could afford to stop.”\n\nWhile the talent and togetherness factors are no doubt key drivers of success, sound marketing practices have also played a role. Managed by Wharton School graduate Rishon Blumberg of Brick Wall Management, the group is very consumer-oriented and clearly values its fans. Bassist Joseph notes that Brick Wall has encouraged the band to be forward-thinking and creative.\n\nLooking out for consumers: One creative marketing strategy Joseph cites is the use of a fan ticket service that allows us to, “charge a lower service fee than Ticketmaster so fans pay less to see the band and also offer fans the option of buying bunded merchandise with the ticket at a discount,” adding that “this also allows us to get contact information for fans so we can market directly to them.” In the case of cds, the band autographs them for pick up at the show. The band also offers promotions for better seating at relatively modest prices, including allowing access to sound checks or the ability to meet the band. Joseph describes the band’s philosophy toward ticket prices by saying: \"We are very conscious of what we charge fans. We don't want to gouge people because we're in this for the long haul, not the quick buck.”\n\nKeeping concerts fresh: The Clarks are also committed to creating unique musical events, including participating in themed festivals, featuring unique artist pairings, or having holiday celebrations. Blumberg stresses the importance of playing festivals, “It is generally the case that most bands are well-advised today to create a broader event atmosphere around some shows. Going to places with like-minded music fans can attract new fans.” As a result, the Clarks play at least three big events in a year. They have also partnered with breweries and a winery for sponsorships.\n\nUnique product offerings: The band helps to maximize sales by offering unique and interesting musical offerings between studio offerings. In terms of its shows, because of their strong regional appeal, Joseph says that they require promoters to stick to strict radius clauses in marketing so one show does not cannibalize another. He says, “We announce shows in a strategic way to help ensure that one show does not adversely affect another show,” and notes that they will play nearby cities like Cleveland and Akron at separate times of the year to avoid cannibalization.\n\nRotating merchandise offerings: Another interesting strategy the Clarks engage in is to change up rotate merchandise offerings. Joseph observes that after ticket sales, merchandise sales are the band's next highest source of revenue. He says that while some haven encouraged the band to stick with their original logo they have found better success in switching it up. In addition, they like to rotate product offerings – beyond classics such as t-shirts they have had success selling unique items such as shot glasses and Christmas ornaments. While marketing texts suggest that very high equity global brands should be cautious with logo changes, the band's longevity and the need from fresh offerings make this sound strategy.\n\nA little sizzle with the steak: Brick Wall Management also helps the band to produce unique videos, using 360-degree video for dvds and finding unique visual ways to present the band. They also use show.co to work with Spotify. Blumberg notes that consumers can pre-save an album to their library which is a benefit to the band when the album goes live because knowing there are fans out there Spotify adds it to additional playlists. As a result of Blumberg’s advice, the band ran a successful contest to incentivize people to pre-save the latest Clarks album.\n\nIn sum, the band has been able to make it by putting out great music and marketing it well."
