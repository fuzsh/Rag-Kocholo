        "text": "Almost all famous musical artists started out as local artists. It begins as one voice, one instrument, a chord, a melody, a song, and it explodes from there. The WYEP Reimagination Project, now in its tenth year, works to put the best high school-aged talent on the fast track to learning the process of recording, marketing, social media, distribution, radio, streaming, touring, and more. This year’s artists are already incredibly talented. When paired with highly credited local producers, the results are profound. Take a listen to the entire album-hear the future of Western PA’s music scene……and beyond.\n\n-Greg Joseph, Executive Producer, WYEP’s Reimagination Project\n\nEli Wynn – “Shades On My Nightstand”\n\nProduced, Recorded, and Mixed by Sean McDonald\n\nRed Medicine Recording Studio, (Swissvale) Pittsburgh, PA\n\nEli Wynn: Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Electric Guitar, Bass, Keyboards\n\nSean McDonald: Drums, Percussion, Programming, Additional Guitars\n\nUgly sunglasses collecting dust on a piece of bedroom furniture. The sun’s rays hitting a windshield just right.\n\nSuch are examples of the poetic eye for detail that informs the songwriting of Eli Wynn.\n\nHaving begun piano lessons at the age of 4, Wynn is a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist versed on guitar, alto and tenor saxophone, and most recently, upright bass.\n\nNext year, Wynn will study music composition at Temple University.\n\n“I lean on indie and acoustic sounds, but I love to jump around and use a variety of flavors from all over, like punk, jazz, R&B, and escape room,” Wynn said.\n\nWynn’s favorite part of “Shades on My Nightstand” is a surprise switch-up in the first verse.\n\nInitially demoing the single with voice and piano teacher, Chloe Weicz, who helped develop its structure, “I think this is the first song I have written that really showcases my sporadic listening habits,” says Wynn, who cites Sufjan Stevens, Theo Katzman, St. Vincent and Flying Lotus among the artists he admires most.\n\nThe Marigolds – “My Rosary”\n\nProduced, Recorded, and Mixed by Dana Cannone\n\nThe Church Recording Studio, (Overbrook) Pittsburgh, PA\n\nAbby Buzzard: Lead Vocals, Rhythm Guitar\n\nCassie Prentiss: Backup Vocals, Drums\n\nVanessa Prentiss: Lead Guitar\n\nMagdelena Rubenstein: Bass Guitar\n\nThe Marigolds are a band inspired by The Bard.\n\nThe lyric “broken and bleeding in the nunnery,” from the Marigolds’ new indie-pop/rock song “My Rosary,” references William Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.”\n\n“We are lovers of all the arts and work to combine our many influences into our music,” bassist Magdelena Rubenstein said.\n\nA truly collaborative quartet, where every band member contributes to the songwriting, lead guitarist Vanessa Prentiss and drummer/backup vocalist Cassie Prentiss also proudly draw influence from their father, bassist Jesse Prentiss, who has played with a host of popular Pittsburgh acts, such as Jon Bindley, Paul Luc and Mark Dignam.\n\n“We always had musical instruments around the house to experiment with,” Cassie said.\n\nThe Prentiss sisters were performing with their first group at Black Forge Coffee when they initially connected with Rubenstein and her likewise musically inclined friend Abby Buzzard, now the lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist for The Marigolds.\n\nA few months later, the four of them forged a group that keeps evolving.\n\nShakespeare taught us all the world’s a stage. The Marigolds stand poised to rock it.\n\nNnenna – “Tomorrow Never Comes”\n\nProduced by Tracey Whorton\n\nRecorded and Mixed by Dana Cannone\n\nThe Church Recording Studio, (Overbrook) Pittsburgh, PA\n\nNnenna: Lead/Harmony Vocals, Piano, Rhodes Piano, Wurlitzer\n\nDana Cannone: Bass\n\nTracey Whorton: Beat Production\n\nNnenna has sung for thousands of spectators and been signed by a professional modeling agency, but as indicated in the original song “Tomorrow Never Comes,” is eager to achieve bigger, more exciting feats.\n\n“My song is basically saying how life is staying in one place. There’s nothing going on and time couldn’t go any slower,” Nnenna said. “Every time I think things are about to get better the time just ends up getting farther away.”\n\nThough, satisfying musical accomplishments are surely right around the corner for Nnenna, judging by the talent demonstrated on the singer’s solo-written song.\n\nInfluenced since fifth grade by Mariah Carey — “I’ve always pushed myself to be able to do her littles runs and high notes” — Nnenna said this most recent studio experience was awesome.\n\n“The amount of equipment is unbelievable, and the quality is very good. I had a lot of fun working in the studio and my producer has been amazing,” Nnenna said.\n\nReluctant to be confined to any specific genre, Nnenna said, “I try to keep my style a variety of different styles so that they don’t sound the same and then hopefully there’s a song for everyone to like. This song, in particular, I was going for a jazzier feel. I wanted it to feel slow and vibey. When I first got into music, I was pretty much obsessed with R&B, so I try to incorporate that in all my music somehow.”\n\nHaving sung “God Bless America” at a 2022 Pittsburgh Pirates game, Nnenna, who is half-Nigerian adds, “I have an extreme love for afrobeat and rhythm.”\n\nMallory Bozovich – “Memory Behind Me”\n\nProduced, Recorded, and Mixed by Dana Cannone\n\nThe Church Recording Studio, (Overbrook) Pittsburgh, PA\n\nMallory Bozovich: Lead/Harmony Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Piano, Synthesizer\n\nDana Cannone: Bass\n\nTracey Whorton: Percussion\n\nIf you dwell in the past, you’ll restrict your emotional growth and hinder the chance to achieve your goals. That’s the important message keenly delivered by “Memory Behind Me” by Mallory Bozovich.\n\n“The first verse details the early stage(s) of a heartbreak, and how even though it hurts, you have to look at reality, and dwelling on the relationship isn’t the way to go,” Bozovich said. “As you move into the chorus, it relays the message of potential ways someone could learn to let go. Just spontaneously taking a drive could be all you need to relax your mind and feel better about the situation. It shows how sometimes you don’t need to have a plan in order to continue your journey and be successful.\n\n“My favorite lyrics would be toward the end of the chorus when it says, ‘I’ll be back, God only knows when, so don’t feel the need to come looking / If you ever get to wonderin’ where I’ll be, it’s with my name in lights and your memory behind me.'”\n\nThe idea, lyrics, melody and music were all Bozovich’s own work, with producer Dana Cannone supplying suggestions for the final sound and feel of the country-pop track.\n\n“It has been a great pleasure working with Dana! It intrigued me how he was able to take everything I had done, and only use small bits and pieces or snippets to create the much larger, cohesive, final project.”\n\nHaving once opened a show for Pittsburgh blues/soul legend Billy Price, Bozovich started piano lessons in second grade, learned to play flute in fourth grade, and by seventh grade had picked up the basics of ukulele and guitar. After a year or so of learning during the pandemic lockdown, Bozovich started to play at open mic events that soon evolved into larger gigs.\n\n“I booked my first full-length show at 13 years of age and haven’t stopped since then.”\n\nClaire Wahl – “Plastic Cologne”\n\nProduced by Anne Celedonia\n\nRecorded and Mixed by Alex Herd\n\nAllegheny City Sound, (Lawrenceville) Pittsburgh, PA\n\nClaire Wahl: Lead/Harmony Vocals, Piano\n\nAlex Herd: Bass\n\nBrandon Lehman: Electric Guitar\n\nJoey Waslousky: Drums\n\nFew things beat feeling carefree and frivolous, at least on the surface. Though a desire for deeper meaning, passion and jurisdiction in life also can bring fulfillment. The “you” in the song is more representative of that existential happiness and a version of herself rather than an actual person.\n\nClaire Wahl wrote about the contrast between those two feelings in “Plastic Cologne,” a song publicly debuted at an open mic a few days afterward.\n\nThe open mic’s host, Wahl’s teacher Jacquelynn Ware, helped organize the artist’s thoughts and tweak the lyrics.\n\n“My producer, Anne Celedonia, brought my ideas from just playing piano and vocals into a complete idea that is fully brought to life,” Wahl said. “Working in the studio was a great experience and creative exercise. The production is just as creative as the writing process, and it was fun to figure out how different pieces and ideas fit together in the studio.”\n\nA singer-songwriter influenced by folk, rock, indie and jazz — and artists like\n\nRegina Spektor, Houndmouth, Oasis and Hozier — Wahl also enjoys writing piano compositions inspired by film music.\n\nNadia – “Sound of Love”\n\nProduced by Saige Smith\n\nRecorded and Mixed by Amos Levy\n\nYMCA Lighthouse Studio, (Homewood), Pittsburgh, PA\n\nNadia Commodore: Lead/Harmony Vocals\n\nHowie Alexander: Keyboards\n\nTerry Levels: Drums\n\nAmos Levy: Beat Production\n\nWitnessing an NPR Tiny Desk performance by pop-R&B singer Yebba inspired Nadia to try a new songwriting technique. “There was a part in her performance where she layered her vocals so elegantly and I wanted to see if I could do the same,” Nadia said.\n\nMission accomplished on “Sound of Love,” Nadia’s hook-laden song helmed by producer Saige Smith.\n\n“I knew from our very first Zoom meeting, when Saige mentioned Alina Baraz as one of the artists she listens to, that we’d work well together,” Nadia said. “When I say, ‘I’m thinking more of a softer dreamy vibe for that part,’ she knows exactly what I mean and how to get there. When she has an idea for a melody, I can take it and articulate it in a way that meets both of our standards.”\n\nAn eclectic artist who gravitates toward neo-soul and jazz, Nadia says her favorite lyric in this song, “I’m feeling lost in this old love we never found,” perfectly describes the experience of something not being what you expected it to be.\n\nNadia explains, “Because I’m so young, most of the things I write about are things I’ve never experienced. Songwriting really requires me to tap into a creative side of myself and find feelings that aren’t entirely real to get the sound I need for the songs I’m working on.”\n\nKing Jewels – “Time of Tribulation”\n\nProduced by Armstead Brown\n\nRecorded and Mixed by Amos Levy\n\nYMCA Lighthouse Studio, (Homewood), Pittsburgh, PA\n\nKing Jewels: Lyrics/Vocals\n\nArmstead Brown: Beat and Music Production\n\nDavid Gardner: Trumpet\n\nTransitional times yield profound songwriting.\n\nKing Jewels certainly relates. The hip-hop artist drew from the upcoming experience of college and the death of his mother almost a year ago to compose a song about spiritual and intellectual growth.\n\n“I’ve gone from making music just to sound cool to trying to make a difference as I’ve realized the impact that media — music, film, social media — has on people and especially children and teenagers,” King Jewels, said.\n\n“Never second guess your essence, because it’s perfect,” says one of the standout lines in “Time of Tribulation.”\n\nGoing from the comfortable setting of a home studio to a professional studio took some adjustments.\n\n“It was hard for me to get comfortable at first and sort of hard for me to be vulnerable around new people but I’ve come along,” King Jewels, the artist name for Julian Lynch, said.\n\n“My sound is a mix of old-school hip-hop influence with new-school flows, too. There’s an element of spirituality and education. All the while trying my best to make it appeal to as many people as I can to get the messages across.”\n\nA recording artist since age 14, with enough athletic ability to slam dunk a basketball, King Jewels has seen childhood hoops friends get shot, be put in jail, and become felons.\n\n“It has opened my eyes that what we have been told is cool and what we have been told is normal, is absolutely atrocious. Growing up in the neighborhoods I have, most of the kids didn’t have consistent father figures, so we had to go out and figure out what it meant to be a man ourselves,” he said. “I’ve struggled my whole life to put my pride to the side, but I’ve grown to realize this life is about so much more than what it’s made out to be.”\n\nLeta Carlene & Lizzie Chey – “I Don’t Want Anybody Else”\n\nProduced by Melina Bowser\n\nRecorded and Mixed by Dana Cannone\n\nThe Church Recording Studio, (Overbrook) Pittsburgh, PA\n\nLeta Carlene: Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Bass\n\nLizzie Chey: Vocals, Keyboards\n\nTracey Whorton: Drums\n\nIdentical twins Leta Carlene and Lizzie Chey were making music together before they could talk. Their unique understanding of each other, call it “twin telepathy,” offers a special songwriting perspective. Though anyone who’s been through a breakup can relate to the sisters’ “I Don’t Want Anybody Else.”\n\nLeta wrote the words from personal experience, channeling personal emotions. Lizzie helped shape the folk-pop song’s laid-back sound and tight harmonies. Feelings abound, as the song bravely expresses vulnerability with lines like “When it gets hard, just want to run into your arms, safe in your arms.”\n\nTheir home has a small studio, though recording at a prestigious studio, The Church Recording Studio, offered a different experience. They enjoyed getting feedback from professionals, and seeing the song evolve into more than they could’ve done on their own.\n\nSuperstar Taylor Swift’s songwriting made an impact, though the twins say their hugest influence was their father, who passed away last year.\n\n“Our dad was a music teacher and he loved teaching us about music,” Leta said. “He started teaching us to harmonize with each other before we turned 2. His love of music lives on through us!”\n\nNolan Michael – “Couldn’t Be Me”\n\nProduced and Mixed by Dana Cannone\n\nRecorded by Dana Cannone and Nolan Michael\n\nThe Church Recording Studio, (Overbrook) Pittsburgh, PA\n\nNolan Michael: Lead/Harmony Vocals, Synth Bass, Synth, Drum Programming\n\nSomewhere between a formal relationship and a casual encounter lies “situationships,” a realm explored lyrically and with a playful tone by Nolan Michael’s “Couldn’t Be Me.”\n\n“This song is about when someone wants something from you, but you are not willing to give it to them. Intentions can easily be different in a ‘situationship,’ and the song reflects that,” Michael said.\n\nThe opening line, “Is this too pop for you?” inspired by an acquaintance who doesn’t like pop music, sets up the song’s tongue-in-cheek bridge with a purposely over-the-top synth-pop sound.\n\n“I love adding a little sarcasm to my music; it reflects who I am and the tone of my work,” Michael said.\n\nWorking in a studio was nerve-wracking initially, Michael said.\n\n“I usually produce songs with my own equipment at home, but once I got comfortable, I loved everything about my studio time. Singing in the vocal booth and hearing the song all come together with the help of a producer was amazing. The setting was so inspiring and a perfect place to create music.”\n\nHe sang along with Taylor Swift songs since the age of 2, before being able to speak in full sentences. Michael released a debut EP at age 13, and regularly studies current events in search of ways to advocate for societal change.\n\n“I want to inspire people the way that music inspires me,” Michael said.\n\nJack Rau – “Light Method”\n\nProduced by Jack Rau and DJ Shoe\n\nMixed by DJ Shoe YMCA Lighthouse Studio, (Homewood), Pittsburgh, PA\n\nJack Rau: Beats and Music Production\n\n“We wanted to produce a soundscape with a modern kick,” Jack Rau says about “Light Method.”\n\nWith an inspirational nod to Aphex Twin’s “Xtal,” Rau aimed for “an ethereal beat” relating to his deep appreciation for how different emotions can be conjured by electronic dance music.\n\n“I remember listening to Skrillex on my iPod Shuffle when I was still in elementary school and from then have listened to so much more and started to develop a certain ear for EDM,” Rau said. “I want to listen to more and understand more genres of music so I can continue to experiment.\n\nRecording in a studio was a fresh experience.\n\n“It created a sense of focus and space for new ideas,” Rau said.\n\nAryana Kapree – “Fly”\n\nWritten by Aryana Kapree and INEZ\n\nProduced, Recorded and Mixed by INEZ\n\nVocal Production: Virgil Richmond\n\nThe Church Recording Studio, (Overbrook) Pittsburgh, PA\n\nAryana Kapree: Lead/Harmony Vocals\n\nINEZ: Beat and Music Production\n\nAn aspiring screen actress, trained dancer and musical theatre student at Westinghouse Arts Academy, 16-year-old Aryana Kapree recorded “Fly” under the guidance of one of Pittsburgh’s most acclaimed musical artists.\n\n“My producer, INEZ, helped out a lot with the reconstruction of the chorus, which really brought the project full circle in relation to the beat,” Kapree said. “It all feels much more connected now.”\n\nWorking together at the esteemed Church Recording Studio in Overbrook, INEZ, the 2020 WYEP Artist of The Year, imparted professional wisdom beyond the craft of song structure.\n\n“She’s taken this opportunity to really show me the ropes and educate me in any way she can, about music but also just about life in general,” Kapree said.\n\nA Las Vegas native, who moved to Pittsburgh when just 2 weeks old, Kapree said “Fly” was inspired by, “The moment you see somebody for the first time and although you don’t know anything about them yet, you are immediately intrigued by their presence, and how everything has a time and place within space.”\n\nArtists who’ve inspired Kapree include J. Cole, Nicki Minaj, Michael Jackson and Marina from Marina & The Diamonds.\n\nRaised by an aunt, who also has a wonderful singing voice, Kapree’s father was ingrained in the West Coast music scene, until being sentenced to jail just before he signed a major record deal.\n\n“This story and the talent I heard in his music is what inspires me to take my skills and work ethic all the way and form a career out of it,” Kapree said. “With my positive attitude and knowledge of spirituality in which I live by, I trust God’s plan and the process.”\n\ndrifting – “Like You Always Do”\n\nProduced by drifting\n\nCo-Produced by Ryan Tedder\n\nRecorded by drifting\n\nMixed by drifting and Ryan Tedder\n\nChalfant Sound Studio, (East Pittsburgh), Chalfant, PA\n\ndrifting: Vocals, Bass, Drum Programs and Music Production\n\nA windy, dreary evening ignited the creative spark for drifting to write the New Wave-pop song “Like You Always Do.”\n\ndrifting, draws inspiration from artists like Paramore, The 1975, Phoebe Bridgers and Porter Robinson.\n\n“An atmospheric approach to pop songwriting, often with an ear for catchy melodies, but never being afraid to shake things up. I’m always trying to make my songs evoke an atmosphere, as if every song lives in a real place,” drifting explains. “I combine influences of ’80s pop, ambient music, shoegaze, indie, EDM, and more.”\n\nHaving sung, played bass, and produced and programmed all the synths, drums and extra layers himself, drifting benefited from the studio experience.\n\n“My producer, Ryan Tedder, helped a lot in polishing the song, taking the individual tracks and diving into them with me, showing me how he would spice the track up and possibly add new transitions and melodies.”\n\ndrifting started producing at age 11, dovetailing off a brother and friends’ efforts to create a videogame.\n\n“They started messing around with music software for it, and that’s how I got my start. Making very amateur beats and sending them back and forth with one of his friends,” drifting said. “I wasn’t good at the time, but it felt natural, and over time I fell in love with producing and writing music.”\n\nEverest Gray – “Outsiders View”\n\nProduced, Recorded, and Mixed by Rick Witkowski\n\nStudio L, Weirton, WV\n\nEverest Gray: Lead/Harmony Vocals, Acoustic Guitar\n\nRick Witkowski: Electric Guitars, Bass, Synth, Drum Assembly\n\nEverest Gray describes her music as “salty indie-girl rock” with a backbeat of irony, underpinnings of satire, and a heartfelt ’90s mixtape vibe.\n\nIt’s an intriguing mix as heard on “Outsiders View,” a song borne from the fear of losing a best friend. Sensing that friendship growing distant and unfamiliar, “I started to imagine and worry about what it would be like if we became strangers,” Gray said.\n\nGray tweaked the lyrics as those initial worries proved true.\n\n“Now we pass each other in the halls at school without so much as a hello, or even a smile. I didn’t realize it was actually happening until she was out of my life and my fears came true. I had no idea why, and never asked. I just accepted it. I think that gave this song the emotionality it needed.”\n\nThe lyrics and melody bear shades of sadness, anger, fear and melancholy.\n\n“My favorite part of the song is the bridge, because it was originally intended to be hopeful, and now singing it is almost sarcastic or mocking,” Gray said. “The meaning has shifted especially there, and I think that’s really cool.”\n\nGray’s favorite line: “And you might be the stupidest person I’ve ever related to.”\n\nNot her original pick for a single, Gray relented when her producer fell in love with the melody.\n\n“I went home that night and immediately wrote a new chorus with the melody we came up with,” Gray, who also plays guitar on the track, said. “After all his help simplifying and making my song catchier, I was able to write a chorus on my own that we both love.”\n\nGray gained a valuable lesson in collaboration.\n\n“I tend to write songs with tons and tons of lyrics and complicated structures, while Rick focuses less on lyrics and mostly on the hooks, and how to get there faster,” Gray said. “I tend to overcomplicate things. This caused a little bit of tension at first because we had different goals with the song. I was more than a little reluctant to make changes – what can I say, I like my lyrics! – but soon this dichotomy allowed us to complement each other. We had fun working together and even though we sometimes got distracted talking about some music thing completely unrelated to my song, we still managed to accomplish a ton.”\n\nA songwriter since fourth grade, Gray wrote and performed an original musical last year called “The Canary in the Coalmine.”"
