        "text": "Paul Bryan leads a distinguished career as educator, performer, and administrator. He is a graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music and Temple University where he studied trombone with Glenn Dodson and Eric Carlson and conducting with David Hayes, Arthur Chodoroff, and Lawrence Wagner.\n\nActive as both conductor and teacher, Paul currently serves as Director and Conductor of Bravo Brass—the PYO Music Institute brass ensemble, Music Director of the Philadelphia Wind Symphony, and Music Director of the Symphony in C Summer Camp. He teaches supplementary conducting and pedagogy at Curtis and has also served as Head Conductor of the Young Artist Summer Program at Curtis Summerfest. During the 2022-23 school year, Paul will serve as a faculty member at West Chest University’s Wells School of Music and at Temple University’s Boyer College of Music and Dance. He will also direct the University of Pennsylvania Wind Ensemble.\n\nDescribed by composer Eric Ewazen as a “stunning” interpreter producing performances with “riveting momentum and heartfelt lyricism,” Paul has led concerts with numerous groups—from the wind and brass ensembles of the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia to Boyz II Men.\n\nSought after for his ability to train instrumentalists, Paul pushes his groups to take risks and “to make music as opposed to just playing it.” Past positions have included Conductor of the Drexel University Orchestra, Conductor of the Philadelphia All-City High School Concert Band, and appearances with the ensembles of the New York Summer Music Festival, Play On Philly, and numerous honor groups in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nPaul has served as an administrator at the Curtis Institute of Music since 1993. As Dean from 2013-2022, Paul provided leadership for all elements of the educational experience—all academic departments, admissions, student services, financial assistance, and the library—and expanded an already exceptional faculty to include notable performers and teachers such as Yefim Bronfman, Michelle Cann, Nick DiBerardino, Gary Hoffman, Jonathan Bailey Holland, Amy Beth Kirsten, Craig Knox, Steven Mackey, Anthony McGill, Midori, Eric Millstein, Katherine Needleman, Eric Owens, Philippe Tondre, and the Imani Winds."
