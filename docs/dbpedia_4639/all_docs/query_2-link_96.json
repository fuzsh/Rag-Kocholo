        "text": "The Vindys have built a rock-solid word of mouth reputation over the past decade, captivating audiences with their unique blend of rock, soul, and pop.\n\nThe Youngstown, Ohio-based band is led by the powerhouse vocalist and songwriter Jackie Popovec, who The Canton Repository cited \"…uncannily evokes Amy Winehouse on the more retro songs while going full-tilt rock 'n' roll on the harder, moodier numbers.\" Rounding out the band is John Anthony on lead guitar and Rick Deak on rhythm guitar. The expanded line-up includes Owen Davis on drums, Brendan Burke on bass, Nathan Anthony on keyboards, Kyle O'Donnell on trumpet, Brian Mayle on trombone, and Garret Kuchmaner on saxophone. The winning combination of these talented musicians has earned the band high praise: Music Connection Magazine describes them as \"The Vindys have everything going for them: a super-powerful voice, a searing guitar, and a fantastic rhythm section topped with a horn section. It is rock and roll at its finest.\"\n\nThe band is comprised of seasoned musicians from the Dana School of Music at Youngstown State University, who create compelling song arrangements with Popovec as the primary songwriter. The band members' diverse experiences and savvy skills contribute to the depth and maturity of their intricate yet relatable music. Passionate about representing Youngstown's thriving music scene, their name pays homage to their roots by drawing influence from Youngstown's daily newspaper, The Vindicator. Brad Savage, program director of Ohio's The Summit 91.3 FM, explains, \"To me, they truly embody Youngstown and northeast Ohio. They possess depth and substance and are instantly likable. Their songs get stuck in your head after one listen.\"\n\nThe Vindys have reached a tipping point in their career, having generated excitement with their dynamic performances at hundreds of venues and festivals--including WonderStruck, Three Rivers Arts Festival, LaurelLive, Winnetka Music Festival, and Summerfest, where the band won the first day of the Emerging Artist Series. They have also shared the stage with such artists as ZZ Top, Pat Benatar, Heart's Ann Wilson, Drive by Truckers, Donnie Iris and the Cruisers, and Hunter Hayes, to name a few. The Vindy's anthemic-style song \"Are You Ready\" was widely used in campaigns for several sports franchises, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, Penguins, and Pirates, and ESPN commercials for the 2023 ACC Softball Tournaments. Their latest music video, \"Bugs,\" the title track from their sophomore album, was screened at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival in New York alongside artists like The Black Keys and Lizzo.\n\nThe Vindys album, Bugs, received critical acclaim and has been described as \"...a record showcasing a maturing, versatile band whose musical palette encompasses everything from gritty classic rock to vintage jazz to refined pop.\" by the Canton Repository. WKSU (NPR) called it \"…a 10-track rock 'n' roll triumph that fuses the group's vintage jazz aesthetic with a more straightforward blues-rock sound.\" Ear To the Ground stated, \"…The Vindys are one of the tightest and talented acts on the national stage. The rockers have long produced soulful and exquisite tracks, but with their latest album, they prove to be a magnetic force of sonic mastery.\n\nThere comes a time in all great bands' lives when there is a thriving sense that new achievements are on the horizon, and the group's music is gathering a whole new audience as it spreads nationwide. That time is now for The Vindys."
