        "text": "Country Day School\n\nCountry Day School students are actively engaged in singing and making music. During the twice-a-week classes in the music room, the children can be heard singing enthusiastically, keeping the beat with their hands, feet or instruments, learning new ways to use their voices, and developing the confidence to sing and perform in front of a larger group.\n\nJunior School\n\nJunior School students learn to understand, participate in and enjoy the art of music as a lifelong activity. They develop skills in memory, discovery, self-expression, observation, concentration and risk-taking. All students have general music classes in grades PK-5 as well as instrumental music classes in grades 2-5, beginning with recorder and moving to woodwind, brass and percussion instruments. Grade-level and school-wide concerts and performances throughout the year give students the chance to share their musical talents and become comfortable performing for an audience.\n\nMiddle School\n\nThe Middle School music curriculum emphasizes individual growth. The study of the creative process and self-expression in music fosters self-confidence and develops an appreciation of the historical and cultural aspects of music. All students take music classes every year, choosing either a large ensemble class (Concert Band, Chorus, String/Keyboard Ensemble) or General Music class (music appreciation for non-performers). Students also have the option to audition for smaller, more advanced ensembles (Jazz Band, Core Choir, Select Strings). Ensembles perform at two school-wide concerts each year, as well as a number of smaller school events.\n\nSenior School"
