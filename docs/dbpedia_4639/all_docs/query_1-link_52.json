        "text": "Marching Band\n\nRich in tradition, the Golden Eagle Marching Band is a corp-style marching band performing diverse styles of music and challenging contemporary drill. With participation from students across campus, the group rehearses in the fall and has a five-day camp before the semester begins. The repertoire ranges from classics and contemporary to traditional fight songs. The band appears at all home football games, leads the Autumn Leaf Festival Parade, has been featured at numerous professional football games and high school band competitions, and is an annual participant in the Collegiate Marching Band Festival of Allentown.\n\nMembership\n\nThe Clarion University Golden Eagle Marching Band is open to all students within the university. Most students who have participated in an average high school marching band for four years have the skills to be accepted into the marching band. In addition to musical, spinning and twirling skills, students must have a positive attitude and good people skills. Joining the marching band is considered to be one of the best orientation activities for new students.\n\nTo join, students must register for the class during their scheduled orientation day. The course number is MUSA 136 (marching band), which counts toward a personal performance credit.\n\nYou must also attend a pre-season training camp, which typically starts on the Sunday, eight days before the fall semester begins. Band members move into their assigned university housing on the first day of pre-season training.\n\nThose who register and attend band camp and successfully complete the marching band season receive a $300 scholarship and have the opportunity for other scholarships.\n\nColor guard and majorettes must audition in April or late June. All color guard, majorettes including the Golden Girl, and percussionists are required to attend a three-day mini camp in early August.\n\nNeed an instrument?\n\nTo request a musical Instrument, please complete and submit the Online Instrument Checkout Request Form.\n\nNeed a music locker?\n\nTo request permission to use a Clarion University Department of Music locker to store your personal instrument, please complete and submit the Online Locker Request Form.\n\nFollow us on our Golden Eagles Facebook Page!\n\nLearn About Our Benefits\n\nCommitment\n\nIt doesn't cost much and it doesn't take as much time as you might think to be part of the marching band.\n\nIt costs approximately $70 for band clothing. The marching band class meets during the fall semester from 4 to 5:50 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Each section has a rehearsal once a week for approximately one hour.\n\nThe marching band performs at five home games and the annual Collegiate Marching Band Festival in Allentown.\n\nThere are no marching band competitions to attend since there is no competitive circuit for university marching bands.\n\nHistory\n\nWalter Hart, a successful public school teacher, organized the Golden Eagle Marching Band in 1941. The band lasted only a year before disbanding because of the outbreak of World War II. With the student population growing after the war, Hart reorganized the band in 1947 with 28 members. Hart continued as band director until 1958 when William McDonald was added to the music department staff.\n\nMcDonald continued in the position until 1960 when Dr. James Bruno succeeded him. Bruno relinquished his band duties after one year, when rising enrollment forced him to devote his time to heading the music department.\n\nDr. Stanley Michalski Jr. was hired in 1961 and directed the band for 31 years until his retirement in 1992. Michalski was succeeded by Susan Cresap, who led the GEMB for one year. Stephen Johnson, Ph.D. led the band for two years, and Jeffrey Macomber, Ph.D. led the band in 1995. Casey C. Teske, Ph.D. took charge of the band from 1996 until 2001, and Lawrence Wells, Ph.D. led the band from 2002 until 2003. Hubert Toney Jr., Ph.D. led the band from 2004 through 2013.\n\nSince 2014, Dr. Casey C. Teske has again been serving as director of university bands and orchestra.\n\nSymphonic Band"
