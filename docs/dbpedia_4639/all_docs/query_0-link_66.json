        "text": "The 2024 Summer Concert Series will close out with the 24th Annual Allegheny County Music Festival (ACMF). The show will start at 5:30 pm with Valleyview, followed by Sweat at 6:30 pm.\n\nThis year, the event will feature two-time Tony Award-winner Michael Cerveris singing the songs of David Bowie backed by a Pittsburgh All-Star band with special guests Scott Blasey and Rob James of the Clarks. Michael Cerveris and the All-Star Band will take the stage at 7:30 pm.\n\nA $20 per vehicle requested donation supports requests made through the county Department of Human Services or the Juvenile Section of the Family Division of the Court of Common Pleas. Since 2000, the County Music Festival has raised nearly $550,000.\n\nLearn more about the ACMF\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nA two-time Tony Award and GRAMMY® Award winner and lapsed son of the South, Michael was raised in West Virginia. These days he splits his time between a NYC apartment and his home in New Orleans. He first picked up a guitar at age 11 and figured out how to play it along the way Starting with his junior high rock band, Ukiah, his early musical outings were notable more for their volume than any discernible musicality. But by sheer grit (or lack of self awareness), Michael happily misspent years touring, playing, and singing with the likes of Bob Mould, Pete Townshend, Frank Black, Teenage Fanclub, The Breeders, Stone Temple Pilots and many others on stages ranging from CBGBs, Sin E, Mercury Lounge, Bowery Ballroom, and Irving Plaza to Lincoln Center, The Kennedy Center, New Orleans Jazz Fest, Tipitina's, Preservation Hall, and Carnegie Hall.\n\nHis day job as an actor landed him on Broadway 10 times including The Who's Tommy, Fun Home, Sweeney Todd and Assassins, in films with Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, James Gandolfini, and John C Reilly (sadly not all in the same film), and on the tv series The Gilded Age, Mindhunter, The Plot Against America, Fringe, Gotham, The Tick, Mosaic, The Good Wife, and Tremé. His New Orleans based Americana band, LOOSE CATTLE, are regulars at Jazz Fest, French Quarter Fest, and clubs throughout New Orleans and the Gulf South. The band recently signed to Muscle Shoals' Single Lock Records to release their next album, Someone's Monster (with guest appearances by Lucinda Williams and Patterson Hood of the Drive By Truckers), in late October 2024.\n\nAlso he once shook David Bowie's hand.\n\nVisit the artist's website\n\nWhen\n\nLocation"
