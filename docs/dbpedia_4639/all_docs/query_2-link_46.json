        "text": "We open our season with hits from your favorite blockbuster movies, featuring, of course, the music of John Williams, Danny Elfman and other great cinematic composers. Thrill to the glorious sound of the brass in Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Jaws, Batman, as well as classics, such as Gone with the Wind. The ‘Burgh is featured in Pittsburgh the Movie, played live to video-clips all shot right here in the Steel City.\n\nBroadway and Brass: It just makes sense! Hear your River City Brass bring to life hits from shows such as The Music Man, Mary Poppins, The King and I, Fiddler on the Roof, Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang, featuring the RCB’s star soloists. You’ll be sure to leave these concerts feeling uplifted by the wonderful music of such a storied musical genre.\n\nEmbrace the spirit of Christmas with this seasonal fan favorite! Featuring your holiday favorites, as well as Duke Ellington’s rendition of “The Nutcracker”, arranged with help from famous Pittsburgher, Billy Strayhorn. Bring the whole family along for this holiday tradition you won’t want to miss!\n\nBack by popular demand, the River City Brass brings your Celtic favorites to life, along with some connections too! Featuring selections such as How to Train Your Dragon, Play That Country Tuba, Cathcart, Amazing Grace, My Heart will Go, and of course, Danny Boy. The RCB will be joined once more by the Pipes & Drums of Carnegie Mellon University and dancers from the Bell School of Irish Dance. Traditional Highland Dress optional.\n\nThe pop music of the 60’s and 70’s forms, for many of us, the soundtrack to our lives, so if you remember the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, or remember them from your parent’s car radio, then this is the show for you. Experience your River City Brass in hits by Earth Wind and Fire, Sir Elton John, Lionel Richie, Queen and, of course, Liverpool’s Fab Four, Paul, John, George and Ringo. Flared pants and psychedelic T-shirts optional.\n\nWe will close our season by celebrating the music of the Great Big Bands and their leaders. Selections will include hits from the bands of Glenn Miller, Stan Kenton, Count Basie, as well as some of your favorite big band music from elsewhere. Don’t miss our season closer when we go out with a big band brass bang!"
