Some call it Electro, some call it Hip Hop, some call it Old School, some call it Rap, but he calls it \"Dance Music\". Egyptian Lover makes music to make you Dance.\n\nHe started out as a DJ in 1978-79 and became the headlining DJ for Uncle Jam's Army in 1982. He has been in the music business all his life. His first time in the studio he recorded the \"Breakin' & Entering\" soundtrack. A true \"Electro\" recording and the first of its kind.\n\nGetting his style from Kraftwerk and enjoying the 808 Drum Machine, programming it like a mad man, he loved beats and no one was making records with just beats back then. You could only get a (bonus beat) at the end of a song on a 12\" single. So He made his own. After that He went into the studio with Uncle Jam's Army and recorded \"Yes, Yes, Yes\" with beats that sound like that \"Breakin' & Entering\" soundtrack and then \"Dial-a-Freak\" one of his all time favourites.\n\nThe Egyptian Lover wrote all the lyrics, he said \"it was easy\". Because he was making rap tapes for people at his High School (James Monroe in the San Fernando Valley in California) he was doing pretty good for himself as he was selling many many tapes. The Egyptian Lover became a local celebrity.\n\nWhen asked about his experiences he stated, \"It was so much fun in the studio I had to go back and record some more. I booked the studio time and grabbed my notebook of raps and went to the studio to record my solo project \"Beast Beats\". My mother and sister read the title of my song and said, \"You better not make that song, Don't play with the Devil\". So I went to the studio and changed my mind and programmed the beat to \"Egypt Egypt\".\n\nHe did not think this song was going to be a big hit, he had just wanted a song to play at the dances when he was DJing. He wanted a song that said his name in it (he admits, ‘I was kinda vain’).\n\nThe Egyptian Lover continued to explain what happened when he started making the beat for Egypt Egypt, “I did the music the way I had mixed other music as a D.J., arranged the song like a mega mix of all the songs I had mixed at the dances and took out my notebook of raps and put together a song. It was all pieces that was mixed together. When the song was completed... I took the tape to the local Radio Station KDAY and they loved it”.\n\nAfter this initial success he was spurred on and went back to the studio and recorded \"And My Beat Goes Boom\", \"What is a D.J. if He Can't Scratch?\" and \"The Ultimate Scratch\".\n\nWhen prompted to let us know what changes this brought to his life he continued, “I did not know what I was in for. I started doing concerts and having more fun than I ever dreamed. I have been all over the United States and thanks to all of my fans on the internet, I have now been all over the World, I am still doing shows and keeping the party HOT!!! I love my job. Thank you!\"\n\nBLACK RAVE CULTURE\n\nBorn from the essence, Black Rave Culture lifts up the torch and begins to walk forward spreading the message of Black Rave. Amal, James Bangura, and DJ Nativesun, hailing from the District of Columbia, come together to bring you a new sound, the sound of their city.\n\nWILD YAKS\n\nWild Yaks play an ecstatic fusion of punk rock and big-city folk reinforced with passionate vocals (often delivered in unison by the full membership). The band was formed in the fall of 2007 in Brooklyn, New York by singer/guitarist Rob Bryn and drummer/vocalist Martin Cartagena. While many players have made their way through the Yaks’ over the years, today’s lineup is Jose Aybar (bass), Patsy Carroll (guitar), Giovanni Kincade (Farfisa), Matt Walsh (guitar), plus Cartagena and Bryn. The Yaks’ discography also includes the EP 10 Ships (Don’t die yet, 2009), and full-length albums Million Years (2012), Rejoice! God Loves Wild Yaks (2015), and Great Admirer (2019). The band’s music has been featured in numerous television shows and films, most notably their live performance in an episode of Law and Order SVU. They are hard at work writing new songs in Rockaway Beach and preparing for a summer of charged performances and communal magic\n\nMARKED FOR DEATH\n\nAggressive experimental jazz quartet, Marked For Death, emerged from Brooklyn, New York, in 2022 as a space for the daring group to unleash its pent-up, avant-garde tendencies. Under the direction of saxophone/flautist, Walter Fancourt, who urged the band to “channel the feelings of a steamy alley-way, like the movie set of an ‘80s thriller,” the group–rounded out by bassist Seth Barden, drummer Joseph Daniel Yount, and guitarist Eric Burns–immediately sparked, bringing flare and fury to Fancourt’s explosive compositions. Having collaborated musically for two decades through projects such as acclaimed afrofunk ensemble Super Yamba Band, the musicians leverage a telepathic chemistry that enables aggressive risk taking and rule breaking. The result is a sound that’s steeped in the realms of experimental jazz, ‘60s film noir, and prog metal; a sound that invites listeners on an immersive musical journey where boundaries are blurred and the extraordinary is the norm.\n\nJELLYFISH\n\nJELLYFISH is Ricky Mawzlin and Stephanie Tsong, a DJ duo/collective from Pittsburgh (USA). They welcome dancers to a sweaty dance floor blanketed in neon + fog with sets that morph between italo, house, melodic techno, disco, electro, and beyond. Since 2017 they’ve DJ’d and hosted parties throughout Pittsburgh. They’ve also played such cities as NYC, San Francisco, Detroit, Boston, Philadelphia, and countries like Taiwan, Japan, Mexico and Colombia. Jellyfish strives to create a (very) queer, FUN atmosphere where ALL are welcome on the dance floor. Now let’s dance.\n\nWORLD 2\n\nWorld 2 is a power psych band from Pittsburgh\n\nBLINDER\n\nBlinder is a shoegaze/punk band from Pittsburgh\n\nWILD ONION\n\nThe onion family is the figurative key to the celestial door of cuisine. Music is like lasagne, there are multiple layers to this shit. There are no rules in cooking, there are no rules in Wild Onion. Wild Onion is not a science."
