        "text": "Jerry Onesi, Jim Hayden and Bob Mascia, three longtime friends performing in the southwest Pennsylvania music scene for decades, came together and formed the Allies in 2015. Together with guitarist Jimmy Metz they began entertaining fans at Community Events, Casinos and Taverns as well as Private Parties and Weddings with a variety of classic tunes spanning the rock era. Since the sudden and sad passing of Jim Hayden we are carrying on with keyboard ace and vocalist Mark Lehosit. See the link below for some song videos of Jim from years past. We would like to thank everybody who came to the memorial for Jim on August 28th 2022 at Hutchinson Sportsman Club, Hopwood PA. A special thanks to all the musicians who played in Jimmie’s memory. We are available to perform anywhere in the SW Pennsylvania, N Central WV, and Western MD area and beyond. No matter the occasion, the band’s classic rock set list will get you out on the dance floor dancing or you can just sit back and be entertained listening to your favorite electric and acoustic rock songs performed to perfection.\n\nYou can follow the Allies Band on Facebook too!\n\nwww.facebook.com/thealliesband."
