        "text": "The Music of Pennsylvania dates from the pre-colonial-era through the 21st century, and Pennsylvania has been the birthplace for some of the most prominent musicians of their respective eras and the introduction of entire new genres of music to the nation and world.\n\nThe Philly sound of the 1970s is soul music that includes notable Pennsylvania performers Gamble and Huff, The O'Jays, The Stylistics, Teddy Pendergrass, Harold Melvin, and The Delfonics, jazz legends like Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, and John Coltrane. Philadelphia gave to the musical world diverse singers, such as Marian Anderson, Mario Lanza, Solomon Burke, Chubby Checker, Dee Dee Sharp, and the trio performing as The Golden Boys, Frankie Avalon, Bobby Rydell, and Fabian Forte, who grew up together in the same Philly neighborhood. Philadelphia was also the birthplace of American Bandstand, and the home of Cameo-Parkway Records and the famed Philadelphia Orchestra.\n\nThe tradition of Pennsylvania's history with music pre-dates the American Revolution. Philadelphia became especially renowned for musical development and was the home of the esteemed Alexander Reinagle, John Christopher Moller, Rayner Taylor, and Susannah Haswell Rowson. Reinagle became the most influential figure in Philadelphia's musical life, organizing a number of concerts, organizations and musical events. Francis Hopkinson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was a notable composer of the period. One of his compositions, \"My Days Have Been So Wondrous Free\", is well-remembered as the first art song from the United States (though this is disputed); it is, however, lacking in originality and innovation to set it apart from European compositions.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the 19th century, Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania became the birthplace of Stephen Foster, easily the most popular American songwriter of the century.\n\nThere were several concert bands that formed in the 19th century during the rise in popularity of community bands. Two examples are the Allentown Band of Allentown and The Emigsville Band of Emigsville.\n\nPennsylvania musicians and groups include:\n\nP!nk, who is from Doylestown, had four #1 Hot 100 hits, including \"Raise Your Glass\" in 2010.\n\nRock band CKY is from West Chester.\n\nHard rock band Breaking Benjamin are based out of Wilkes-Barre.\n\nMetalcore band Motionless in White is from Scranton.\n\nCountry and pop sensation Taylor Swift is from Wyomissing.\n\nGrammy-winning hard rock band Halestorm formed in Red Lion.\n\nThe War on Drugs is an indie-rock band from Philadelphia.\n\nSinger-songwriter Christina Perri is from Philadelphia. Her older brother, Nick Perri, is a lead guitarist formerly of Shinedown and Philly-based hard rock act Silvertide, and currently plays in SINAI.\n\nAlthough Justin Guarini was born in Georgia, he spent most of his life in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

Associated with the heartland rock subgenre and with artists like Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, John Mellencamp, and Tom Petty, the Houserockers were regarded by many as both grittier and more kinetic. Although commercial success eluded the group, leader Joe Grushecky and the later incarnation of the band remain popular regional artists. In the Houserockers' wake came a number of other Pittsburgh area bands, including Norman Nardini and the Tigers, whose minor hit \"If You Don't Love Me (Someone Will)\" put the band briefly on the pop map.

While the Quakers had few musical traditions, Protestant churches made extensive use of music in worship. J. F. Peter emerged from the Moravian tradition. Conrad Beissel, founder of the Ephrata Cloister, innovated his own system of harmonic theory. Lutherans Johann Sebastian Bach, Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel, and C. F. W. Walther were propagated all over colonial-era Pennsylvania, and especially in present-day Bethlehem, which was the first Lutheran settlement in colonial America and remains a center of Lutheran musical traditions into the 21st century.\n\nMain article: Ephrata Cloister\n\nThe Ephrata Cloister (Community of the Solitary) was founded in what is now Lancaster County on the Cocalico River in 1720. This was a group of Seventh Day Baptists led by Peter Miller and Conrad Beissel, who believed in using music as an integral part of worship.[7] Beissel codified the Ephrata Cloister's unique tradition in his Beissel's Dissertation on Harmony; here, he divided notes into two types. These were masters, or notes belonging to the common chord, and servants, or all other notes. Accented syllables in Beissel's works always fell on master notes, leaving servant notes for unaccented syllables. The Ephrata Cloister's hymnbook was large, consisting of more than 1,000 hymns, many of which were accompanied by instruments including the violin. Many of these hymns were published in the 1740s and 1750s.\n\nMain article: Harmony Society\n\nIn 1803 and 1804, a group of Christian pietists led by George Rapp arrived from Württemberg, Germany, settled in Harmony, Pennsylvania, and formed the Harmony Society in 1805. The group lived communally, were pacifistic, advocated celibacy, and music was a big part of their lives. The Harmonites (or Harmonists) wrote their own music and even had an orchestra. The Society lasted until 1906, but their final settlement, Old Economy Village in present-day Ambridge, Pennsylvania contains archives with sheet music that is still performed at special community events.\n\nMain article: Lutheranism\n\nJustus Falckner was the first Lutheran pastor ordained in the United States. He was ordained during 1703 as a minister of the Church of Sweden in the Gloria Dei Church. He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on November 24. Falckner wrote hymns such as Rise, Ye Children of Salvation (German: Auf! ihr Christen, Christi Glieder) which he composed while a student at the University of Halle in 1697. Falckner's published works include Grondlycke Onderricht which first appeared in New York during 1708. Falckner evidently believed that music was a very important element of missionary work, writing to Germany to ask for an organ, which he said would attract more Native American converts.\n\nMain article: Mennonite\n\nThe Mennonites, followers of Menno Simons, settled in Germantown after emigrating from the German Palatinate and Switzerland between 1683 and 1748. They were led by Willem Rittinghuysen, grandfather of astronomer and mathematician David Rittenhouse. The Mennonites used a hymnbook from Schaffhausen, reprinted in the present-day Germantown section of Philadelphia in 1742 as Der Ausbund Das ist etliche schöne christliche Lieder.\n\nMain article: Moravian music\n\nFounded in 1457, the Moravian Church originally spread across Moravia, Poland, and Bohemia before persecution forced the remaining faithful to Saxony, where they lived under the protection of Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. Zinzendorf wrote hymns, and led the Moravians to America, where they began missionary work in Georgia but with little success. They moved on to Pennsylvania, and founded the town of Bethlehem on the banks of the Lehigh River. A group then left for Salem, North Carolina in present-day Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n\nBoth in Salem and Bethlehem, Moravians continued to use music in their ceremonies. Instruments included organs and trombones, and voices were usually in choirs. Players generally played on rooftops for most any occasion, ensuring that they could be heard for great distances. A legend has arisen claiming that a group of Native American warriors approached a Moravian settlement during the French and Indian War, but left after hearing a trombone choir because they believed it to be the voice of their Great Spirit. Moravians were devoted to missionary work, especially among African slaves and Native Americans; in 1763, they published a collection of hymns in the Delaware language.\n\nMoravians also had a tradition of secular art music that included the famed composer Johann Friedrich Peter, who was a German born in Holland who emigrated to Bethlehem in 1770. He brought with him copies of compositions by Joseph Haydn, Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach, Johann Stamitz and C. F. Abel. After living in Bethlehem for a time, Peter moved to Salem, where he founded the Collegium Musicum (in 1786) and collected hundreds of symphonies, anthems and oratorios. It was during this period that Peter also composed a number of well-respected instrumental pieces for two violins, two violas and a cello; he also composed sacred anthems like \"It Is a Precious Thing\" and arias like \"The Lord Is in His Holy Temple\".\n\nThe Moravian Church continued to produce a number of renowned composers into the 19th century, including John Antes, Johann Christian Bechler, David Moritz Michael, Jeremiah Dencke, Johannes Herbst, and others. Herbst was also a noted collector, whose archives, left to the Salem church after his death, were made public in 1977; these included more than 11,000 pages of content. Salem has gradually become the center for Moravian musical innovation, partially due to the presence of the Moravian Music Foundation.\n\nMain article: Pietism\n\nIn 1694, Johannes Kelpius brought a group of German Pietists to the banks of the Wissahickon Creek. These became known as the Hermits or Mystics of the Wissahickon; an 1871 map of Wissahickon Creek notes a Kelpius spring and Hermits Glen. Kelpius was a musician, and he and his followers brought with them instruments that became an integral part of church life. Kelpius was also a composer, and is sometimes called the first Pennsylvanian composer, based on his unproven authorship of several hymns in The Lamenting Voice of the Hidden Love. It is likely that he wrote the text, though the tunes are mostly based on German songs; the English translations in the collection are attributed to Christopher Witt, an Englishman who immigrated and joined the mystics, also building them a pipe organ, said to be the first privately owned organ in North America.\n\nEarly Indianist movement composers from Pennsylvania included Arthur Nevin from Edegeworth and Charles Wakefield Cadman from Johnstown.\n\nEarly composers from Pennsylvania included Samuel Barber, who was born in West Chester, and David Ludwig, who was born in Bucks County.\n\nExperimental music composer Maryanne Amacher was born in Kane.\n\nMusic portal\n\nPennsylvania portal"
