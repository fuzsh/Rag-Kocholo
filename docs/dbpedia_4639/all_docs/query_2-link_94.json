Also known as The Boss and frequently touring as Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, Bruce Springsteen is most widely known for his brand of heartland American rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered around his life in native New Jersey. This run will take Bruce to over 30 cities across the US. Don't miss your chance to see this icon of American rock live on stage once again!\n\nShe's back! The Grammy award-winning singer Billie Eilish is hitting the road. Eilish first turned musical ears when the song she wrote with her talented brother went viral in 2015. \"Ocean Eyes\" was just a taste of things to come and heralded a bold, out-of-the-box pop persona that mixes avant-garde fashion and a tough-as-nails swagger, all tied up with an incredibly expressive voice.\n\nIt's that time of year! On November 1, 1994, Mariah Carey changed the holidays as we know them by dropping the super festive anthem 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' from her iconic Merry Christmas album. Immediately racing to the top of music charts the world over, the bop has since become as standard every December as twinkle lights and candy canes, selling over 16 million copies. Join the undisputed Queen of Christmas (sorry, Mrs Claus) for a very special tour, Mariah Carey's Christmas Time!\n\nCatch the elegant marvels displayed by the stunning Cirque Musica. Backed full symphony orchestra, expect to hear your favorite holiday hits alongside the breathtaking magic of cirque! This festive season sees Cirque Musica back on the road with their Holiday Spectacular, a concert experience filled to the brim with festive fun and entertainment for all the family to enjoy.\n\nAdmit it; you loved Justin Timberlake as a member of pop-powerhouse NSYNC. Now, as a solo performer, Justin Timberlake has hit it big with songs like Cry Me a River, Like I Love You, Mirrors and many more! The prince of pop has announced his first tour since 2019's The Man of The Woods tour! Following the launch of his upcoming album, 'Everything I Thought It Was,' on March 15, the vocal sensation will embark on the Forget Tomorrow world tour.\n\nJoin Harry Potter as he enters his fifth year at Hogwarts in this live to film concert, backed by a full orchestra playing Nicolas Hooper's magical score as the adventure plays out on a huge screen. So grab your cloaks and brooms and prepare for the Boy Who Lived's most epic adventure yet presented in unforgettable style."
