We eagerly look forward to welcoming you back!”\n\n“My wife wanted a memorable birthday, she was throwing a Lisa frank themed party. I was at a loss for what to add till I found the band’s web page.\n\nThey were prompt courteous and professional during the whole experience.\n\nThey dealt with my bulldog trying to intimidate the bass drum, and when Lieutenant realized he wasn’t going to win. They took his effort to run off with the mic inside. They set up quietly, asked the right questions and prompted a setup I never thought of. That setup ended up being great allowing for the party and my neighbors to enjoy the band.\n\nThey set up the sound and music levels so as to be heard throughout the house and backyard but not loud enough to prevent socializing while in the next room.\n\nI can’t express the professionalism and how easy they made hiring them was. 10 out of 10 will hire again”\n\n“Saw them tonight at the Science Center and my 5 year old requested Spice Girls and Christina Aguilera which they rocked out too! Thanks so much for making her happy! You guys were awesome to watch and can't wait to see you again!”"
