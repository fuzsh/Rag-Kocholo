        "text": "When you think of Pennsylvania, you might not automatically think of music superstardom. But our state has more than its fair share of acclaimed and popular performers, ranging in genres from hip-hop to big band. A few of them are even nominated for Grammy Awards, and can be found at tonight's ceremony.\n\nTake a look at 27 of the biggest names in music that call Pennsylvania home!\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nHall & Oates\n\nDaryl Hall and John Oates both are Philly natives, and their meeting would lead to six number one hits on the Billboard 100 list.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nTodd Rundgren\n\nLong before Adele sang \"Hello, it's me,\" Todd Rundgren was born in the Philadelphia area. His album \"Something/Anything\" made the Rolling Stone list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nChris Kirkpatrick of 'NSync\n\nKirkpatrick nearly made the cut for the Backstreet Boys, but the Clarion, Pa. native went on to team up with Timberlake and company instead.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nFrankie Avalon\n\nForget 'NSync for 'nsecond, though, because one of the original teen heartthrob singers, Frankie Avalon, was originally from Philadelphia. Guess all those beach movies took place in Jersey?\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nChubby Checker\n\nThough Ernest Evans was born in South Carolina, he was raised in South Philly and earned the nickname Chubby Checker while performing impressions of other singers, including Fats Domino, around the neighborhood.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nJim Croce\n\nCroce hailed from South Philadelphia, and one of his early jobs as a musician was a regular gig at a steakhouse in Lima, Pa.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nThe Dorsey Brothers\n\nTommy and Jimmy Dorsey were both born around Shenandoah, Pa. The brothers were successful both together and as solo acts in the jazz and big band era.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nEve\n\nEve Jihan Jeffers-Cooper began performing as part of a singing group in a Philadelphia high school talent show. \"Attitude rude? That's the Philly in I / Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life\" indeed.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nPerry Como\n\nPerry Como once had the ambition to become the best barber in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. He went on to become one of the most famous crooners ever, which is almost as good.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nBeanie Sigel and Freeway\n\nBoth Beanie Sigel (whose stage name is taken from Sigel Street in Philly) and Freeway came up from the Philadelphia rap scene, and caught the attention of Roc-A-Fella Records mogul Jay Z.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nDJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince\n\nOf course we all remember that Will Smith is from West Philadelphia, born and raised. But still, sometimes it's easy to forget that he was a radio-friendly rapper along with fellow Philly native DJ Jazzy Jeff.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\n.+\n\nWhile both Ed Kowalczyk now tours and performs separately from the rest of the group, he and bassist Patrick Dahlheimer and drummer Chad Gracey all originally hail from York.\n\nMORE: 'Lightning Crashes' turns 20: Live's Ed Kowalczyk, Chad Gracey share memories of York band's hit\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nPatti LaBelle\n\nThe Godmother of Soul hails from Philadelphia, and before hitting it big as a solo act, was also the lead singer in Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nPoison\n\nWith Brett Michaels from Butler and Bobby Dall and Rikki Rockett from Mechanicsburg, Poison may be one of the most Pennsylvania rock bands out there. Take that as you will.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nWiz Khalifa\n\nIf Wiz Khalifa's anthem to the colors of the Steelers wasn't enough to tip you off, we can confirm the rapper is from Pittsburgh.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nPink and Christina Aguilera\n\nBoth Pink (from Doylestown) and Aguilera (who was raised outside of Pittsburgh) probably deserve their own slide. But since they are together in this cover of a Patti LaBelle song, it seemed a mistake to enjoy the Keystone State reunion.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nTay-Tay has long had that girl-next-door vibe, but to a few residents of Reading, Wyomissing and other small Pennsylvania towns, she was quite literally just that.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nNine Inch Nails\n\nSpeaking of segues, here's a song by Nine Inch Nails. Trent Reznor was born in New Castle and grew up in Mercer. Aside from shared Pennsylvania roots, I wonder if he and Taylor Swift have literally anything else in common.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nThe Roots\n\nAnd when it comes to Pennsylvania roots, you've got two great choices for bands. ?uestlove and Black Thought started out in Philly and now serve as Jimmy Fallon's late-night house band.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nRusted Root\n\nFrom the other side of the state, there's Pittsburgh-based Rusted Root. Is there any song that has been featured in more commercials than \"Send Me On My Way\"?\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nHenry Mancini\n\nYou might not recognize Mancini's name right away, but you're almost sure to recognize his music - he did the score for numerous films, including many directed by Blake Edwards. Mancini was born in Ohio but raised outside of Pittsburgh.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nJoan Jett\n\nWhether she was performing with The Runaways or The Blackhearts, it's clear that Joan Jett loves rock and roll. She was raised in Wynnewood, outside of Philadelphia.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nBoyz II Men\n\nIf you couldn't guess from the title and content of one of their biggest hits, the R&B group Boyz II Men is actually from the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nTrain\n\nWhile the group Train formed in San Fransisco, lead singer Patrick Monahan is from Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\nMORE: Train's lead singer Pat Monahan on Hershey memories, going mainstream and trying to recreate 'Drops of Jupiter'\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nThe Bloodhound Gang\n\nIf you only think of King of Prussia because of the awesome mall, you can also add \"hometown of The Bloodhound Gang\" to its list of accomplishments. (Has anyone done a mash-up with this and \"Closer\"? Let's look into that, people.)\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nBillie Holiday\n\nLady Day was born in Philadelphia, and while faced struggles with drugs and abuse, she was one of the most groundbreaking jazz singers of her era.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nBreaking Benjamin\n\nBenjamin Burnley was raised in Selinsgrove and moved to Wilkes-Barre, where he and Jeremy Hummel founded Breaking Benjamin.\n\nBreaking Benjamin earns first number one album on Billboard 200 charts\n\nIn this Aug. 16, 2015, file photo, Wiz Khalifa accepts the choice R&B/hip-hop song award for \"See You Again\" at the Teen Choice Awards at the Galen Center in Los Angeles. Pittsburgh police say rapper Wiz Khalifa has been cited for urinating in public.\n\nSean Adams | sadams@pennlive.com\n\nWho did we miss?\n\nWho's your favorite on our list of homegrown music heroes?
