        "text": "PITTSBURGH – Dreams keep coming true for Charles Wesley Godwin & The Allegheny High.\n\nJust wait until this Saturday, when that rapid-rising country band hears the hometown cheers from what's likely to be a sold-out Stage AE.\n\nGodwin hails from Morgantown, W.Va., his band features five Beaver County musicians and a sixth member from Pittsburgh, and they're headliners now, continuing an upward trajectory.\n\n\"In January 2022, we played for 150 people at Club Cafe (in Pittsburgh), now one year later we'll be playing for 2,500 people,\" guitarist Al Torrence said. \"That's a testimony to how much the music has spread, and a testimony to what hard work can do in a year if you keep grinding and playing a lot.\"\n\nSaturday's show originally was scheduled for the 380-capacity Thunderbird Music Hall in Lawrenceville, but tickets sold so quickly, promoters moved the show to the six-times larger Stage AE, where as of Wednesday night only a handful of tickets remained.\n\n\"If you don't have your tickets yet, go online soon and buy them because it's close to selling out,\" said Torrence, adding that the band's allotment of free tickets went so fast, his mom and dad had to buy their own.\n\nPeople are eager to see Godwin, praised by Americana Highways for his \"rootsy, gritty, bona fide Americana music with lyrics that ring true,\" and The Allegheny High, whose Beaver County musicians Torrence, Max Somerville (keys), Eric Dull (guitar), Nate Catanzarite (bass), and Joe Pinchotti (drums), with Pittsburgh's Read Conolly (pedal steel) have revved up audiences from The Ryman Auditorium in Nashville to The Warfield in San Francisco to Pier 17 in New York City.\n\nMore:My Favorite Guitar: Al Torrence shares the story of his favorite instrument\n\nA few days ago, the famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado announced a May 9 show starring Shane Smith & The Saints, with Godwin and his band second-billed ahead of 2023 two-time Grammy Award nominee Molly Tuttle.\n\nGodwin and the guys were supposed to play Red Rocks this past November opening for red-hot country star Zach Bryan, but a snowstorm wiped out that opportunity.\n\nTake a gander at Godwin's last three Pittsburgh area shows to see how far he and the band have come:\n\n⋅Oct. 27, 2021, warming a sold-out audience of 1,400 at the Roxian Theatre for the emerging Bryan.\n\n⋅Jan. 3, 2022, headlining a sold-out Club Cafe.\n\n⋅Sept. 19, 2022, Rejoined with Bryan on the road, and playing a warmup set at a sold-out Stage AE outdoors, punctuating with a well-received cover of John Denver's \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" that got 5,500 people singing along.\n\nSaturday's Stage AE indoor show will feature a few tracks from a new album the band finished this week in Nashville.\n\nTorrence describes the new material as \"like the classic songs Charles writes,\" but with \"leaps forward\" musically.\n\n\"There's some heavier stuff and some lighter stuff,\" Torrence said, with the ultimate aim of powerful dynamics. \"It's more of a journey.\"\n\nEarlier albums were recorded in Torrence's Music Garden Studio in New Brighton, the former Jeree Records, where Beaver Valley rock star Donnie Iris cut his immortal \"Ah! Leah!\" in 1980.\n\nRecording this time in a larger Nashville studio allowed Godwin and the Allegheny High a new, more organic approach.\n\n\"We tracked it live, and with the bigger studio we could all play at the same time, and play off each other more than before,\" Torrence said.\n\n\"We're going to start implementing new songs into the set, but we don't want to give them away too quickly,\" Torrence said. \"There are songs on there we believe could do well on country radio\" including one with a '90s throwback feel.\n\nGodwin has been teasing lyrics from the yet officially unnamed album on his Twitter page, where 22,400 followers await his posts.\n\nThe Twitter updates keep coming, like news late Wednesday afternoon that Godwin and the Allegheny High (a name taken from his song \"Over Yonder\") will open Alabama and Florida shows for outlaw country star Cody Jinks.\n\nAmazon Music proclaimed Godwin as a 2023 Breakthrough Artist to Watch.\n\nIt all adds up to the kind of acclaim that dreams are made of.\n\nScott Tady is entertainment editor at The Times and easy to reach at stady@timesonline.com."
