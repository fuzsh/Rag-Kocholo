        "text": "Pittsburgh Community Broadcasting Corporation, the non-profit parent organization of 90.5 WESA and 91.3 WYEP, have just announced the musicians selected for their innovative new Artists in Residence program. Over 260 Pittsburgh-area artists applied in July. Fifteen musicians from the Southwestern Pennsylvania region will create musical compositions to be featured in the stations’ on-air and online content. The chosen artists will be showcased on both station’s websites, WYEP.ORG and WESA.FM, and their compositions will be heard by listeners across our region’s airwaves.\n\n“Listeners have heard music created by past Artists in Residence on both WYEP and WESA, from WESA's 'Voting Matters' coverage to the 'CityGuide' segment on both WESA and WYEP,” revealed Mike Sauter, Vice President of Broadcasting at Pittsburgh Community Broadcasting Corporation (PCBC). “For this cohort, we were able to include more artists in the program—five more than last time. It was tough not be able to include even more artists due to the high quality of applicants. But we're very proud of the group selected this year. As a whole they represent various styles of music, and as individuals they are all multifaceted in their creativity,” shared Sauter.\n\nThe artists will write, arrange, perform, and record original instrumental compositions that will be used as show themes, transitional music beds, and in other settings in WYEP's and WESA's on-air, digital, and video content. PCBC developed the Artists in Residence program to help support the diversity of talent that is a vital component in Pittsburgh’s musical ecosystem.\n\nThis program is supported by a grant from the Hillman Foundation to foster arts and culture in the Pittsburgh region.\n\nf3ralcat\n\nf3ralcat is an artist, composer and producer who yearns for a paradigm shift away from the superficial sexualization that exists today for saxophone. His band, Feralcat and the Wild, is a prog-rock/emo/fusion band where his sweeping saxophone melodies carry overtop driving distorted guitars and synthesizers in music that is meant for mosh pits, not for jazz clubs. As a solo producer (stylized \"f3ralcat\"), his music lends jazz sensibilities to more eclectic sounds in lo-fi, synth-wave and video game soundtracks.\n\nIn addition to his own characteristic work as an artist, he has performed as a sideman with neo-soul singer Sierra Sellers, Afro-Latin jazz fusion band Hugo Cruz y Caminos, and the eco-socialist avant-garde ensemble Afro Yaqui Music Collective. f3ralcat has been featured in local publications/magazines, including Visit Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh City Paper, Pittsburgh Current, Made in PGH and Very Local Pittsburgh.\n\nJuliAnne Wright\n\nJuliAnne Wright is a singer/songwriter/producer based in the South Hills. A public school music teacher for 16 years, she re-started her performance career after a brush with brain surgery reawakened old dreams, and fostered a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nSince 2012, she can be found playing live in the Pittsburgh area (most frequently at the weekly AcoustiCafe open stage) or holed up in her basement studio, producing multi-genre tracks for her pop/groove alter-ego \"Huuli\" and other solo and collaborative projects.\n\nJuliAnne was a finalist at WYEP's singer songwriter contest in 2016, released her debut album \"The Ups and Downs\" in October 2022, and contributed a track to the collaborative album \"Femme Frequencies\" (as 'Huuli') released August 2023. Outside of performing, JuliAnne is also a songwriter/producer, with nine original songs signed to licensing agencies, and one tune landing in an international Dove ad in 2021.
