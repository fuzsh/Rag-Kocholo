        "text": "\"This-That & The Other Thing\" has been entertaining western PA for the past thirteen years! With \"This-That & The Other Thing\" you get the best of all worlds; three lead vocalists, both male and female, super three part harmony, solid, danceable music and a compact three piece band that has the power to play outdoor festivals and at the same time fit in to small venues where space is at a premium. We also provide an \"unplugged\" acoustic version of the band for occasions that call for that. Michelle plays bass, Tony plays guitar, and Vince plays drums. Check out our extensive song list that is filled with an incredible variety of classic rock favorites, mostly from the 60's and 70's, but is also sprinkled with more contemporary hits as well as a few country favorites! You won't find another band in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area that can perform the variety that we can.\n\nâ€‹"
