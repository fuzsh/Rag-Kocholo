        "text": "Operational project\n\nSmall-scale interventions can transform streetscapes into safe, walkable spaces for pedestrians. The seasonal StreetSeat is an effective way to calm traffic, increase visibility, and maximize the utility of sidewalk area.\n\nPurpose\n\nCreate a seasonal outdoor seating opportunity\n\nImprove the public realm\n\nEnhance pedestrian safety\n\nCreate an attractive setting for eating, reading, meeting friends, or taking a rest\n\nLocation\n\nThe StreetSeat is located on the active commercial corridor of 5th Avenue at St. Mark’s Place, near Barclays Center and Flatbush Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn\n\nContext\n\nWith proximity to mass transit connections and major destinations such as Barclays Center, 5th Avenue in Park Slope buzzes with pedestrian activity\n\nThe active corridor includes many retail and restaurant options, but lacks adequate public space to host vibrant street life\n\nProject Origination\n\nDOT’s Public Space Unit worked with the 5th Avenue Park Slope BID and a local business, who applied to install this StreetSeat\n\nPlanning and Design\n\nAfter the community partner submitted a plan, DOT visited the site to assess the potential for design intervention\n\nPartners and DOT collaborated to present to the Brooklyn Community Board 6, and gathered support from the adjacent businesses and the community at large\n\nImplementation\n\nDOT installed ‘No Standing Anytime’ signs, wheel stop bars, flexible delineators, and a parking stripe\n\nThe partner hired a fabricator to build the StreetSeat structure out of cedar wood and a contractor to install it\n\nTo ensure physical accessibility, the StreetSeat rests on a platform to make it level with the curb and sidewalk\n\nThe partner maintains the structure and surrounding plantings as part of the legal project maintenance agreement\n\nDOT conducts periodic inspections, and the partner conducts surveys to garner valuable public input\n\nResults\n\nThe StreetSeat project repurposed one parking space into an asset for hundreds of pedestrians daily\n\nWith new seating, the 5th Avenue corridor benefits from more active street life, additional greenery, and open views\n\nSales increased after the Street Seat was installed\n\n5th Avenue and St. Marks Avenue, Brooklyn"
