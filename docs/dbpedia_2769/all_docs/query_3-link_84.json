        "text": "150 Fifth Avenue was originally built in 1888 in Manhattan’s Flatiron District of New York. The 11-story property underwent a major modernization and building-wide renovation, now occupying 227,500 SF of space. A two-story expansion atop the west and east ends of the property was completed using terra cotta piers. The result created a unique work space with landscaped roof terraces and decks. The open, collaborative and efficient floor plans were created by infilling existing openings and eliminating certain walls. The expanded and renovated lobby creates an improved tenant and visitor experience."
