        "text": "Things to do in New York\n\nAbout New York\n\nIs there any city quite like New York City? One of the most popular vacation and travel destinations in the world, this bustling city is chock-full of attractions, events, sights and things to do - it’s impossible to do it all at once!\n\nTouring New York City may seem daunting, because the city is so different from many other cities like Buffalo, Philadelphia, or Washington, D.C. But the experience doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Choose a few places to visit in New York and proceed from there - let yourself be swept up in the noise, bustle and ever-moving current of this great city.\n\nPlaces of interest in New York\n\nNYC is known for its skyline, and you can barely take a step in the city without seeing some of its most iconic sights.\n\nIt’s impossible to miss Central Park when you’re in NYC. It’s not the biggest park in the city - in fact, it’s only the fifth-largest, but it is the most-visited urban park in the United States and the most-filmed location in the entire world. The park is located between the Upper West and Upper East Sides of Manhattan and stretches for 2.5 miles from north to south, and 0.5 miles from east to west. Within its grounds you’ll find miles of lush walking, running and cycling trails, as well as green meadows, boating rentals and, in the winter, an ice rink.\n\nAnother iconic sight in New York is Times Square, known for its bright lights and billboards. It’s one of the most buzzing areas in the city, full of shops, restaurants and street performers - and it’s just a stone’s throw from the theaters on Broadway.\n\nThe Empire State Building, although not the tallest building on the NYC skyline, is unique for its Art Deco design and incredible views over the city. The 120-story building was built in 1930-1931 and is currently the seventh-tallest skyscraper in New York. Visit its observation decks to gaze down at the city below - but if you want great views of the Empire State Building itself, you should instead scale the heights of the Top of the Rock, in the Rockefeller Center.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty is one of the most recognizable attractions in New York - although the statue’s proper title is Liberty Enlightening the World. Built by Gustave Eiffel, of Eiffel Tower fame, it was a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, and it stands as a symbol of the freedom of the USA. It’s located on Liberty Island, and visits to see the statue are often combined with a trip to Ellis Island, where you can discover the fascinating history of immigrants arriving in the US. Ellis Island was once the busiest immigration processing station in the USA, with nearly 12 million immigrants arriving there between 1892 and 1954.\n\nJust three minutes away from the One World Trade Center, the highest building in New York, is the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. This poignant museum is a tribute to those lost in the 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers and although it’ll be a somber visit, it’s well worth spending a few hours there.\n\nNew York’s culture and history\n\nThe many neighborhoods and boroughs each have their own feel, vibe and flavor, and each has its own New York attractions.\n\nTake a stroll through Greenwich Village, once the home of the 1960’s counter-culture and today packed full of Bohemian bars, cool restaurants, and comedy clubs. The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village was the site of the 1969 Stonewall Riots, widely considered to be the catalyst for the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the USA. There are still many LGBT-friendly bars in the area, and you’ll see rainbow flags dotted around the area, showcasing its diversity and inclusivity.\n\nChelsea has been a haven for culture for decades, attracting artists and museums. Explore the district, popping into the various galleries, boutiques and cafes lining the pavements, or take it all in from the High Line, a 1.45-mile-long public park that’s elevated on a former railroad.\n\nYou might have come to New York to see a show - and you’ll be spoiled for choice if that’s the case. Broadway in Manhattan is lined with theaters where you can catch an array of highly acclaimed shows, from The Lion King to Hamilton.\n\nAreas surrounding New York\n\nYou could come here a hundred times and never run out of things to do in New York. But if you fancy exploring what’s around the city, you could head across the Hudson River to New Jersey. Hoboken has incredible views of the Manhattan skyline and is the birthplace of Frank Sinatra - you can even visit a museum there dedicated to him.\n\nSlightly further afield is picturesque Ithaca in New York state. The home of Cornell University, the city is also famous for its beautiful gorges and waterfalls, as well as its collection of quirky boutiques.\n\nJust a few hours on a coach and you could be running up the Rocky steps in Philadelphia, or a half-day journey in the other direction and you could explore the highlights of New England, like Boston, which are particularly beautiful in the fall.\n\nBuses to New York\n\nFind the most affordable buses to New York\n\nWith FlixBus, it’s easy to travel to New York, as 175 rides are available starting from only $10.99 depending on the departure city, date and time.

Booking in advance with our app guarantees the lowest fares, and you get your ticket digitally in the app, so you don't have to print your ticket before hopping onboard, sitting back, relaxing and enjoying a comfortable ride to New York!\n\nWhy traveling to New York with FlixBus\n\nYou can get to New York from 175 different cities, and when it’s time to move on, there are as many connections from New York to other destinations. No matter the journey, bus travel is always a better and more sustainable choice than other means of transportation (on a person/km basis, traveling by bus is more environmental-friendly than driving, flying and, in certain countries, even going by train).
