        "text": "Fifth Avenueâs 30-foot-wide snowflake chandelier is the grandest in the world.\n\nBack 50 feet above our heads and brighter than ever, the Fifth Avenue Association and the Stonbely Family Foundation celebrated the lighting of the snowflake on Dec 3rd.\n\nWith stores like Cartier, Dior, and Rolex drawing attention on social media and bringing large crowds from their eye-catching holiday lights and decor, the pressure was on for this yearâs snowflake.\n\nAfter going through serious renovations, 16,500 crystals encompass the snowflake alongside more than 600 new high intensity full color LED lights.\n\nBig name companies like Tiffany & Co., Gucci, The Plaza, Bergdorf Goodman, Christine M.J Oliver, A Fairmont Managed Hotel, and more recently joined the fun as contributors to hang the snowflake.\n\nâA symbol of tradition! We love it!â commented the Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenueâs post showing the snowflake on Instagram.\n\nThe snowflake will also be the centerpiece for the Gift of Fifth Holiday Open Streets, closing down 11 blocks taking place on Dec. 10th and 17th from from noon to 6 p.m.\n\nAn iconic symbol since 1984, the Snowflake has been in the background of millions of photographs and a staple of New Yorkâs holiday decorations. Although, in the heat of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, the snowflake did not make an appearance.\n\nâThe best is yet to come! Plans are underway to resume the highly successful Snowflake Ball next year, which raised more than $65 million for the worldâs children,â said George Stonbely, Chair of The Stonbely Family Foundation, George Stonbely in a press release.\n\nIn 2001, the Snowflake was rededicated to UNICEF which serves the worldâs children. It has since moved to a new non-profitâThe Fifth Avenue Snowflake for Humanityâwith a mission to raise funds for humanitarian and arts organizations.\n\nMarie Boster, president of The Fifth Avenue Association called the snowflake Saks avenuesâ ânorth star.â\n\nâWe look to the snowflakeâs brightness, uniqueness, and splendorâjust like the iconic avenueâto let us know the holiday season is here,â she said."
