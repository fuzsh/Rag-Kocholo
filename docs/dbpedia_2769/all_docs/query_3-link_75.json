        "text": "At the center of Manhattan, 100-104 is central to all of New York's established and evolving neighborhoods. As a commuter hub, Union Square boasts more subway lines than both the World Trade Center or Grand Central Terminal and is easily accessible via Brooklyn, Queens, New Jersey and Westchester. And while most office buildings yearn for one neighboring park, 100-104 has three: Union Square Park, Washington Square Park, and Madison Square Park. When it comes to location, 100-104 Fifth has it all squared up."
