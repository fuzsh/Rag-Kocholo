        "text": "The High Line • The High Line is a recent addition to the major attractions of New York City. It is a public park built on a historic freight rail line elevated above the streets on Manhattan’s West Side. It runs from the Hudson Yards by the waterfront at West 34th Street to Gansevoort Street in the Meatpacking District, meandering through the neighborhood of artists and galleries in Chelsea. This unique setting has become one of the most enjoyed public spaces in the city, by both locals and visitors. It is also a fantastic open air art gallery with installations by some of the best-known contemporary artists in the world. Once you are on the High Line, take your time to stroll along and enjoy the ever changing city views, the art installations and the people watching. Midway through the line, you will have the opportunity to go down in an elevator on 23rd Street. This will put in the middle of Chelsea. We recommended spending time in this great neighborhood, home to scores of art galleries, boutiques and cafes; you are in the very heart of the art world of New York. A fitting end to this day is a visit of the new Whitney Museum, designed by the renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano.\n\nBrooklyn Bridge, DUMBO, Brooklyn Heights • Cross the mile-long Brooklyn Bridge, an icon in New York City for over 125 years. Thread upon this feat of modern engineering and immerse yourself in 360-degree views of the Manhattan Skyline, New York Harbor, and the Manhattan Bridge. Continue to Brooklyn Heights, one of New York’s first suburbs. It is an elegant neighborhood of beautiful brownstones and a vibrant scene of cafes and boutiques. An easy stroll leads to the famed promenade for the best views of Manhattan and New York Harbor. From the promenade, head to the DUMBO district (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass). Once a distressed neighborhood of small industrial plants, it is today an attractive destination for artists and creative types. The neighborhood’s unique urban landscape is partially the result of being below the two bridges: Brooklyn and Manhattan.\n\nGrand Central • This is the Beaux-Arts building known as the Grand Central Terminal. Some tour books describe the station as, “For over 100 years, this building has been a testament to the ingenuity and ambition of a great city. Its history is a story of immense wealth, great engineering, a few accidents, a planned sabotage and one terrific ceiling.” Explore the historic halls and platforms, perhaps grab a bite to eat at the famous Oyster Bar nestled among the tile arches in the terminal.\n\nConey Island and Brighton Beach • Though both beaches are at the southern edge of Brooklyn, Coney Island and the neighborhood of Brighton Beach feel a world apart. Coney Island is the oldest amusement park in the US with some rides as vintage as 90-years old (like the Coney Island Cyclone est. 1927), but it is the people on the boardwalk and the side attractions that really make this area a great destination for enjoying the street scenery. Taste the history of New York at Grimaldi’s, which has been serving pizza from its brick-oven for over 100 years and, of course, Nathan’s Famous Polish hot-dog. Brighton Beach is one of the most ethnic neighborhoods of New York with a strong Russian influence. Also called Little Odessa, a reference to the Ukrainian city from which many of its residents hail, the neighborhood is known for its tight-knit, Russian-speaking community. Visit the colorful shops, food emporiums and restaurants (much of their signage in Cyrillic) that line Brighton Beach Avenue beneath the rumble of the elevated subway lines.\n\nHudson River • Visitors to New York in the fall should not miss the chance to drive up the Hudson River Valley to experience the foliage that is ablaze in autumn colors, shimmering against the backdrop of New England. Give yourself plenty of time to drive at a leisurely pace and stop along the way. Feel free to branch out from the main highway 9 and follow the smaller rural roads closer to the river. This is a region of small towns and villages, many dating back to the original settlements of Colonial times. Plan to stop at the small village of Sleepy Hollow. You can walk around its charming main street, Beeckman Avenue, and purchase some local food for a riverfront picnic at Kingsland Point. Visit the famed Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Although you might not encounter ghosts or headless horsemen, enjoy a stroll among the tombstones and mausoleums of some of the most famous and wealthiest New Yorkers such as Rockefeller, Astor and Chrysler. The small town of Beacon is the site of the Dia Beacon Museum. Housed in the old Nabisco factory, the indoor/outdoor installations are world-class. Stop at the old Dutch farming village, Nyak for some refreshments before the last stretch back to New York.\n\nHamptons and Long Island • Summer visitors who want to cleanse after spending a few days in the heart of New York should dive into the blue waters of the Hamptons. Pamper yourself at an oceanfront spa, with aromatherapy treatments and facials. Take a sunset stroll adjacent to soothing breaking waves and find yourself at the Montauk Point Lighthouse and Museum; this is America’s oldest lighthouse, erected while George Washington was president in 1792. Deep Hollow Ranch offers horseback riding for all experience levels. This journey down the superb coastline includes historical fun facts and refreshing sea views. Excite your taste buds by enjoying a succulent lobster at one of many local seafood shacks."
