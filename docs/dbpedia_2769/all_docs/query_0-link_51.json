        "text": "All about luggage storage in NYC\n\nTo put it simply, New York City needs no introduction. America’s largest city offers some of the most recognizable landmarks and cultural institutions in the world being a true metropolis. There is a vast cultural, historic, culinary, and architectural landscape that can't be fully experienced in a few days. Ask anyone who's moved to New York, and they'll likely tell you that even a few years isn't enough time to see everything.\n\nWhy choose Bounce to store luggage in New York?\n\nDepending on your travel itinerary, you'll likely reach New York City at either LaGuardia Airport or Penn Station. Because it might not make sense to head directly to the hotel to drop your bags off, a luggage storage service like Bounce can be extremely helpful in the instances where you want to sightsee but need a place to store the bags.\n\nYour stuff is safe at one of our 279 convenient luggage storage options in New York\n\nSecure luggage storage: Bounce fully vets each luggage storage location to make sure they meet strict quality standards.\n\nComprehensive protection: We also include Bounce Shield protection for up to $10,000. So travelers can't enjoy a piece of mind when storing their belongings with bounce.\n\nSupport local businesses: Bounce partners with local shops and businesses to provide travelers with the best possible locations. They’re staffed by locals who can also act as a resource for tips and recommendations, which is particularly useful when exploring NYC’s many neighborhoods.\n\nMake the most of your time in New York for $6.60/day\n\nEvery borough is covered: Our luggage storage facilities are everywhere. There are certainly luggage storage services that stick to obvious areas like Manhattan. But Bounce wants to offer our customers the most convenient locations possible, so you'll find secure and reliable storage spots in every single New York City borough.\n\nFlat rate pricing: With us, you'll never need to worry about rushing back to get your bags. The prices are quoted up front and you can extend the time as needed.\n\nDiscover the magic of New York with no hidden fees or size limits\n\nA flexible way to store luggage: Luggage lockers at train stations or attractions tend to have limitations regarding item size and storage duration. Bounce does away with all that, as the storage facility is a local business and not just a box in the corner of a transportation facility. This makes Bounce especially useful for travelers with golf bags, surfboards, and other specialty items.\n\nNo time limit: You can book for several days at a time, making it easy to incorporate Bounce into your travel plans.\n\nNo hiding: Our pricing model aims to make the user experience as simple as possible, with a flat rate for storing a bag for a 24-hour period, while also offering flexible terms like free cancellation.\n\nPopular places for bag storage in New York City\n\nWith our flagship partner at 519 8th ave and 279 other locations to choose from, you'll never be stuck with your stuff near train stations or popular landmarks.\n\nMain transportation Hubs in New York\n\nLuggage storage at Penn Station\n\nPenn Station is the busiest transit facility in the Western Hemisphere, with hundreds of thousands of passengers passing through its historic halls each day. It’s located beneath Madison Square Garden and near some of the busiest parts of NYC, which makes luggage storage highly important for travelers. That’s why Bounce has plenty of storage spots nearby!\n\nLuggage storage at Grand Central Terminal\n\nThis Midtown Manhattan terminal located at 42nd Street and Park Avenue is a key hub for the commuter rail network in the New York metropolitan area. If you're traveling into New York by bus, you'll greatly benefit from Bounce's locations near Grand Central Terminal.\n\nLuggage storage at the Port Authority Bus Terminal\n\nQuite literally the busiest bus station in the world, the Port Authority bus terminal is where almost a quarter of a million travelers pass through on their way to and from regional destinations. It’s situated in Midtown Manhattan on Eighth Avenue between 40th Street and 42nd Street. If you’re bussing into NYC and want to get your sightseeing started, there are Bounce locations nearby that are easy to pop into.\n\nMain hotspots in NYC\n\nWe are very strategic about where we look for partner locations, and customer convenience is a huge factor in where luggage storage locations are set up. Here are a few of the most common:\n\nLuggage storage in Central Park\n\nProbably the most famous park in the world, this massive European-inspired green space in the middle of Manhattan continues to thrive despite the concrete jungle of skyscrapers growing around it. With over 800 acres of gardens, groves of trees, spacious lawns, and a lake, you’ll want to drop the bags off at a nearby luggage storage spot before heading into the park.\n\nLuggage storage in Times Square\n\nOne of the most recognizable places in the US, this intersection at the junction of Broadway, Seventh Avenue, and 42nd Street features iconic neon signs and advertisements. You can pop in here during a sightseeing trek through Manhattan, and there are frequent events held here, too. Because it's such a busy place, you’ll want to drop the bags off at a Bounce location before exploring (and taking a selfie).\n\nBounce’s New York luggage storage locations include convenient ones near the city’s top transportation hubs, and plenty of subway stops throughout the Big Apple.\n\nHow to stow your bags in New York City with Bounce\n\nStoring luggage is an easy way to make traveling around the city easier. Waiting for a train but want to maximize sightseeing? We can help. Have to check out of your Airbnb early? We can help with that, too.\n\nEasy booking: We offer a handy, mobile luggage storage app and website that makes it simple to find luggage storage facilities through the intuitive search function. You can then book in a few clicks.\n\nFast check-in: With detailed information from the app, you can find the storage facility and simply show your confirmation to the friendly and helpful attendant\n\nBe on your way: After a brief and simple (unless you want to ask this local a few questions about the neighborhood) interaction, you can head out and start exploring New York City."
