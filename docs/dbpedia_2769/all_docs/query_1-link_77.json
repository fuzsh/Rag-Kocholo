        "text": "NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- Marchers chanted for the release of hostages in Gaza on Sunday at a New York City parade for Israel that drew thousands of people under heightened security.\n\nThe parade came almost eight months after the unprecedented Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, the deadliest in Israel's history. The parade in the past was dubbed \"Celebrate Israel,\" but organizers said the exuberant atmosphere would be paused this year given the war and Israeli hostages still being held in captivity, as well as outbursts of antisemitism worldwide.\n\n\"Especially this year, after Oct. 7, it's especially important to have this show of unity,\" said Rena Orman, a Bronx native who took part in the parade as part of Mothers Against College Antisemitism. \"Everybody wants hostages back. Everyone wants this to end. No one is cheering for this. Everyone wants peace.\"\n\nThe parade, now called \"Israel Day on Fifth\" because of the route along Fifth Avenue from 57th Street to 74th Street in Manhattan, focused on solidarity, strength and resilience.\n\n\"This is not a mood of confetti and music,\" CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council Mark Treyger said. \"This is more of a mood of unwavering, ironclad solidarity with hostages to bring them home, and also our unwavering love and pride in our Jewish identity.\"\n\nThe parade, which is in its 59th year, drew thousands of participants, including Israeli dignitaries, celebrities and some of the hostages' families.\n\nThere was never a thought of cancelling the parade this year, Treyger said, despite what he termed an astronomical rise in antisemitism.\n\n\"This is a moment that we have to meet,\" he said.\n\nBut there was significant security.\n\nNew York Police Department officials said Friday they plan to implement measures typically used for high-profile events such as New Year's Eve and July 4. That includes drones, K-9 units, bike patrols, fencing and barriers and designated entry points for spectators all along the parade route.\n\nBackpacks, large bags and coolers were prohibited. Spectators had to pass through metal detectors.\n\nCity officials stressed Friday there were no specific or credible threats to either the parade or the city and any protestors have the right to demonstrate so long as its done peacefully.\n\n\"We're not going to allow any unlawfulness and any disruption of any celebration of one's heritage in this city,\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said at a security briefing.\n\nPolice did not report any parade-related arrests by late Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe parade represented the first large-scale Jewish event in the city since the war started, although there have been roughly 2,800 protests in the city, with about 1,300 of them related to the conflict, the Democrat said.\n\nIsrael faces growing international criticism for its strategy of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in the besieged territory have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nOrganizers said this year spectators won't experience the music, bands, and the traditional mirth. The message of the parade will be \"Bring Them Home,\" referring to the hostages held by Hamas, nearly eight months after Hamas' attack on Israel.\n\nAccording to New York City's Office of the Mayor, there have been nearly 2,800 protests across the city since Oct. 7, with almost 1,300 demonstrations related to the war in the Middle East.\n\nThis year's parade carried an additional concern that scuffles could erupt between protesters and spectators, either during the parade or as they disperse afterward.\n\nNYC Police Commissioner Edward Caban urged those attending this weekend's parade to remain vigilant.\n\n\"The eyes and ears of New York play a vital role in protecting our city. So, if you see something that doesn't feel right, please let a cop know,\" Caban said.\n\nWIth information from The Associated Press\n\nALSO READ | NYPD warning thieves targeting Central Park visitors in Zelle scam\n\n----------\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* More New York City news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News"
