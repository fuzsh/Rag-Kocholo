        "text": "What to do in the New York City?\n\nThere’s simply no place like the Big Apple. Home to more than eight million people from every corner of the world, it the global center for luxury travel, business, finance, the arts, entertainment, sports, fashion and politics. Explore the sights and sounds of this international metropolis from your exquisite accommodations at Sofitel New York — an ideal luxury location in the midst of it all — perfect for your business travel or vacation stay.\n\nSofitel New York offers a convenient and luxurious location in midtown Manhattan within walking distance of many of the city’s world-class attractions including:\n\nAmerican Museum of Natural History:\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History is a New York icon. Packed with exhibitions representing people and animals throughout the ages, the museum also has a planetarium and a digital 3D and 2D theater, as well as special visiting exhibitions and plenty of places to eat and shop. The dinosaur wing is a must-see, and if you have time, lie down under the life-size model of a blue whale in the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life.\n\nApollo Theater\n\nHarlem’s acclaimed Apollo Theater is important not only because it honors and promotes the contributions of black performers but also because it is a living example of progress: the building was originally a burlesque theater. The theater shut down in 1933 after future New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia launched an anti-burlesque campaign. Reopened under new management in 1934, the Apollo began to direct programming toward Harlem’s burgeoning African-American community.\n\nBarclays Center\n\nBarclays Center is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The arena is home to the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association, and the arena also hosts concerts, conventions and other sporting and entertainment events.\n\nBroadway Shows\n\nNo visit to the cultural capital of the world is complete without experiencing the thrill of a Broadway show. Just a short walk from Manhattan’s Great White Way in the heart of the Theater District, Sofitel New York – a model of drama and sophistication in its own right – provides easy access to Broadway’s top performing artists, longest running musicals and the hottest new shows 24/7. After all, it is the city that never sleeps.\n\nBronx Zoo Wildlife Conservation Society\n\nThe Bronx Zoo of the Wildlife Conservation Society is the premier place to study and appreciate the world’s many creatures. Home to more than 6,000 animals, the zoo spans 265 acres that re-create the diverse natural habitats of its numerous residents. Open year-round, it’s a great experience in any season. During the winter, be sure to stop by Tiger Mountain or Himalayan Highlands to see big cats enjoying the chilly outdoors—then head to World of Reptiles or JungleWorld for a warm up with tropical wildlife. (Some exhibits and attractions are seasonal. Go to BronxZoo.com to plan your visit in advance.).\n\nBrookfield Place\n\nBrookfield Place is the height of luxury shopping, dining and cultural arts in downtown Manhattan. The complex is positioned just south of Tribeca along the Hudson River waterfront and home to international fashion houses including Hermès, Bottega Veneta and Burberry, and contemporary brands such as Paul Smith, Theory, Michael Kors, Vince and Lululemon.

Starr Bonsai Museum. The blossoming of Brooklyn Botanic Garden’s 200 cherry trees is a New York City rite of spring and not to be missed.\n\nBrooklyn Bridge\n\nStretching across the East River, the iconic Brooklyn Bridge opened up back in 1883 to carry traffic (nonautomotive at the time) between Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. One of the most recognizable parts of the New York City skyline, the bridge has been featured in movies and on television shows, and is a real piece of New York City history. A stroll across the elevated pedestrian walkway provides a true New York City experience. The Manhattan-side entrance is at Park Row and Centre Street, across from City Hall Park, east of City Hall; over on the Brooklyn side, enter at Cadman Plaza East or where Boerum Place meets Tillary Street.\n\nBrooklyn Flea\n\nBrooklyn Heights and Brooklyn Promenade\n\nBrooklyn Museum\n\nIf you’re looking for diversity, the Brooklyn Museum is the place to go. It houses a huge permanent collection categorized by culture, as well as visiting exhibitions from a wide variety of geographic locations and time periods.

As of 2018, the Chrysler is the eighth-tallest building in the city, tied with The New York Times Building.\n\nColumbus Circle\n\nColumbus Circle is a traffic circle and heavily trafficked intersection in the New York City borough of Manhattan, located at the intersection of Eighth Avenue, Broadway, Central Park South (West 59th Street), and Central Park West, at the southwest corner of Central Park. The circle is the point from which official highway distances from New York City are measured. The circle is named after the monument of Christopher Columbus in the center, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The name is also used for the neighborhood that surrounds the circle for a few blocks in each direction. To the southwest of the circle lies Hell’s Kitchen (also known as “Clinton”), to the southeast is the Theater District, and to the north is the Upper West Side.\n\nConey Island Cyclone\n\nTheConey Island Cyclone (better known as simply the Cyclone) is a historic wooden roller coaster in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York City.

Upon completion in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city at 20 floors high and one of only two “skyscrapers” north of 14th Street – the other being the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, one block east. The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street – where the building’s 87-foot (27 m) back end is located – with East 23rd Street grazing the triangle’s northern (uptown) peak. As with numerous other wedge-shaped buildings, the name “Flatiron” derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron.\n\nFlushing Meadows–Corona Park\n\nFlushing Meadows–Corona Park, often referred to as Flushing Meadows Park, or simply Flushing Meadows, is a public park in the northern part of Queens, New York City. It contains the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, the current venue for the US Open tennis tournament; Citi Field, the home of the New York Mets baseball team; the New York Hall of Science; the Queens Museum of Art; the Queens Theatre in the Park; the Queens Zoo; and the New York State Pavilion.

It is part of the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The National Park Service administers a small portion of the north of the island as the Governors Island National Monument, while the Trust for Governors Island operates the remaining 150 acres, including 52 historic buildings. Today, Governors Island is a popular seasonal destination open to the public between May and September with a 43-acre public park completed between 2012 and 2016, free arts and cultural events, and recreational activities. The island is accessed by ferries from Brooklyn and Manhattan.\n\nThe Lenape of the Manhattan region referred to the island as Paggank (“nut island”), likely after the island’s plentiful hickory, oak, and chestnut trees; the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block called it Noten Eylant, a translation, and this was borrowed into English as Nutten Island. The island’s current name, made official in 1784, stems from the British colonial era, when the colonial assembly reserved the island for the exclusive use of New York’s royal governors.\n\nGrand Central Terminal\n\nMajestic Beaux-Arts landmark.

Some tourists miss out on visiting the statue because it’s only accessible by boat, set on a government-run island in the middle of New York Harbor, but it’s easy to work into your trip with some advance planning. The monument welcomed generations of immigrants to the United States as they passed through nearby Ellis Island, the nation’s main entry station between 1892 and 1924 (it eventually closed in 1954). Its American Family Immigration History Center contains millions of passenger arrival records and hundreds of ship pictures from the time; anyone whose family arrived in America this way, or who has just a passing interest in the nation’s immigrant history, will find the museum an excellent bonus to a statue trip—or a reason to visit in its own right.\n\nTheatre District\n\nNew York City’s Theatre District is an area in Midtown Manhattan where most Broadway theaters are located, as well as many other theaters, movie theaters, restaurants, hotels, and other places of entertainment.

Pass beneath the Washington Arch—the giant structure marking the park’s Fifth Avenue entrance on the north side—and you’ll see the energy that makes the place so special. NYU students congregate around a central fountain; sunbathers lie on the lawn; musicians sit on benches strumming guitars; and canines run gleefully amok in two dog runs. The park’s black-brick paths and vintage-style streetlights lend it a 19th-century feel, as does a majestic bronze statue of Garibaldi.\n\nWhitney Museum of American Art\n\nThe Whitney Museum of American Art is the world’s leading museum of 20th-century and contemporary art of the United States. Focusing particularly on works by living artists, the Whitney is celebrated for presenting important exhibitions and for its renowned collection, which comprises over 21,000 works by more than 3,000 artists. With a history of exhibiting the most promising and influential artists and provoking intense debate, the Whitney Biennial, the museum’s signature exhibition, has become the most important survey of the state of contemporary art in the United States.\n\nYankee Stadium\n\nYankee Stadium, home to the 27-time World Series champion New York Yankees, was built in 2009 across the street from the old stadium.
