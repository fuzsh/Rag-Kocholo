        "text": "The part of 5th Avenue that runs through Midtown Manhattan between 49th Street and 60th Street is lined with famous designer boutiques and shops; in fact, 5th Avenue shopping is often ranked as one of the priciest retail experiences in the world. The “most expensive street in the world” label is something that changes from year to year depending on the economy, but 5th Avenue shops often claim the title for this illustrious street.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, 5th Avenue had the most expensive retail shops based on cost per square foot. Forbes ranked 5th Avenue as the most expensive street in the world in 2008, and the uber-rich have considered the penthouses on this street as the most sought-after in the city.\n\nWhy Is 5th Avenue So Famous?\n\nThe 5th Avenue shopping may be notoriously expensive, but the street has other claims to fame, too. There are so many world-famous businesses, museums, luxury apartments, and historical landmarks that the American Planning Association named it one of the greatest places in America in 2012.\n\nWhat Are the Famous 5th Avenue New York Stores?\n\nSome of the famous clothing stores on 5th Avenue in NYC include Lord & Taylor, Armani, Bergdorf Goodman, Henri Bendel, Cartier, Ferragamo, Gucci, and the ever-popular American Girl Place. Other 5th Avenue shops like Free People, Ermenegildo Zegna, Saks Fifth Avenue, and St. John Boutique also draw crowds, along with stores that don’t specialize in clothing like Apple.\n\nWhat Is There to Do on 5th Avenue?\n\nThere is more to this neighborhood than 5th Avenue shopping. NYC tourists can also visit 5th Avenue to explore the Jewish Museum, Rockefeller Center, the American Irish Historical Society, and St. Patrick’s Cathedral. There’s great dining on 5th Avenue alongside plenty of other landmarks and attractions to explore for those who aren’t shopaholics."
