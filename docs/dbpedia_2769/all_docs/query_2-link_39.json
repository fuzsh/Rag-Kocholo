        "text": "“The crucial factor for transportation in this region is the interdependence of city and suburb – interdependence today, the even greater interdependence tomorrow.” – Metropolitan Transportation – A Program for Action, 1968\n\n“Even while Walt Whitman was romanticizing the Brooklyn Ferry, daring minds were planning permanent linkages between thriving Manhattan and the growing communities of Long Island.” – Threshold to the Seventies, 1972\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) was chartered on April 24, 1834, railroads had been in existence for only nine years and Long Island was sparsely populated. Today, America’s oldest railroad still operating under its original name is also the busiest commuter railroad in North America. In the 1830s, Long Island’s 70,000 residents were mostly concentrated in Brooklyn and Queens, the island’s western end. The LIRR became inextricably linked to the development of Long Island and the surrounding metropolitan area. Direct service from Long Island to Manhattan’s west side began with the opening of Pennsylvania Station in 1910. Today, the four counties on Long Island are home to 7.88 million people – one-third of the entire population of New York State – and the LIRR is a vital link in the regional transportation network.\n\nThe opening of Grand Central Madison is one of the most seismic shifts in New York transportation history, allowing LIRR trains to provide service directly to Manhattan’s east side. The terminal itself is only one aspect of potentially the largest transit improvement project ever in the northeastern United States, East Side Access, which encompasses building miles of new track, reconfiguring and updating rail yards in New York City and Long Island, modernizing infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels, and the hiring of thousands of new employees.\n\nGrand beginnings\n\nIn 1837, as rail travel was beginning to take root and re-define the American landscape, The New York and Harlem Railroad (NY&HRR) built the first rail structure on the Grand Central site, a car maintenance barn. The New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad (NYNY&H), chartered in 1849, used the NY&HRR tracks for service between Wakefield in The Bronx and Manhattan. The Hudson River Railroad operated on the west side of Manhattan and had a depot in Madison Square. Although railroads expanded travel beyond the confines of Manhattan, steam locomotives and their concomitant noise and dirt caused consternation amongst Manhattan residents, who pressured the city to curtail their use. Eventually, steam locomotives were prohibited from traveling south of 42nd street, which encouraged the NY&HRR to buy more real estate around their car barn and expand their facilities.\n\n1960s: The Program for Action sets the stage\n\nLong Island Rail Road (LIRR) service has terminated at Pennsylvania Station since 1910. Although plans to bring LIRR service into a second terminal on Manhattan’s East side have existed for more than a century, the possibilities for the project’s scope and impact beyond New York City and Long Island were not fully conceptualized until the 1960s.\n\nIn 1964, a new Federal law called the Urban Mass Transportation Act provided matching funds for large-scale transportation improvements. In response to this, the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (which had been chartered in 1965 to take over the operations of the LIRR) published a report in early 1968 entitled “Metropolitan Transportation – A Program for Action”, a multi-year, multi-billion dollar plan to improve transportation in the New York City area. This report was the blueprint for using the Federal money, and later that year New York City received $25 million of an anticipated total of $254 million. This was the first major federal investment in New York’s subways, and the MCTA dropped the “commuter” in March of that year, becoming the MTA.\n\n1990s – 2000s: Modernizing a 188-year-old lifeline\n\nThough the 63rd Street Tunnel is the means through which Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) service is delivered to Grand Central Madison, it is only a small part of the massive East Side Access project. The project aims to ease crowding at Pennsylvania Station as well as on Queens subway lines, reduce traffic congestion, modernize rail infrastructure, attract new ridership to public transportation, and strengthen intermodal connections. In short, it will modernize the 188-year-old railroad with the most significant work to its infrastructure in more than a century.\n\nIn 1992, the MTA completed a study underscoring the fact that Pennsylvania Station’s physical constraints precluded it from accepting the increase in service the growing ridership of the LIRR demanded, and the plans to build a new terminal on the East side of Manhattan began anew. In 1998 the decision was made to plan and complete the project, and construction began in 2001.\n\nBefore construction of Grand Central Madison could begin in earnest, numerous other smaller projects on Long Island (as well as The Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan) had to be planned or completed. These included the purchase of new rolling stock for both the LIRR and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, improvements to Pennsylvania Station such as the Moynihan Train Hall and concourse, lengthening platforms, expansion and improvements to LIRR storage yards and maintenance shops, and adding a third track to the LIRR Main Line.\n\nManhattan: New caverns\n\nAlthough construction methods and equipment have become more efficient over the years, digging a rail tunnel still takes a lot of time and money. To connect the 63rd Street Tunnel to the new terminal at Grand Central, two 22-foot Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) excavated approximately 25,000 linear feet of tubes under Manhattan. This work began in 2007 and ended in March 2013. The Manhattan tunnels weren’t alone: four new tunnels were excavated under the Sunnyside Yard and Harold Interlocking in Queens.\n\nManhattan: Building a new terminal\n\nGrand Central Madison, at 700,000 square feet, is the largest mined underground rail station in the United States and has parts as deep as 180 feet below street level. When the East Side Access project was first proposed, a terminal at Third Avenue and 48th Street was considered, but in the 1970s it was decided that Grand Central Terminal would be a better location for LIRR service.\n\nLong Island: The Main Line gets a third track\n\nThe 95-mile Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) Main Line runs from Long Island City in Queens to Greenport in Long Island. Five branches of the railroad split from the Main Line, including the Port Washington, Port Jefferson, and Oyster Bay.\n\nThe LIRR Expansion Project took 4 years to lay more than 10 miles of railroad track between Floral Park and Hicksville. This work included eliminating grade crossings, adding parking structures, and building pedestrian crossings over trackways. Groundbreaking was in September 2018 and the project was completed in October 2022.\n\nThe LIRR Expansion Project is part of a larger group of modernization projects the LIRR has undertaken in recent years to improve infrastructure all over its service area in preparation for East Side Access and the new terminal at Grand Central Madison.\n\nQueens: A new platform for Jamaica Station\n\nGrand future\n\nOnce Grand Central Madison is open, customers can get to Long Island from both the East and West sides of Manhattan. Customers going to Pennsylvania Station have been enjoying the new Moynihan Train Hall since 2021. The opening of Grand Central Madison marks the beginning of a new era in rail travel and sets the stage for even more improvements in the future."
