        "text": "The company will increase the number of standalone locations of its personal shopping and styling suites, bringing the total to 20 by the end of 2024\n\nNEW YORK, June 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Saks Fifth Avenue is expanding its luxury personal shopping and styling service, The Fifth Avenue Club, bringing the total number of standalone locations to 20 by the end of 2024. Driven by positive customer response to existing locations, the expansion comes one year after the launch of its Fifth Avenue Club concept of private standalone suites in hotels and resorts across the U.S. The newest Fifth Avenue Club location opened this week in Austin, TX, and additional openings are scheduled throughout the summer in Fort Worth, TX, St. Petersburg, FL and Rancho Santa Fe, CA, building on recent openings in Savannah, GA, Denver, CO and Minneapolis, MN.\n\n\"The success of our standalone Fifth Avenue Club suites illustrates that luxury clients are increasingly seeking one-on-one fashion expertise tailored just for them,\" said Larry Bruce, President, Saks Fifth Avenue stores. \"Since the introduction of this concept last year, we are proud to have cultivated a new, engaged client base and a skilled stylist team that delivers one-of-a-kind personal shopping and styling tailored to the unique lifestyles of our customers within each community. We look forward to continued expansion of the highly personalized service and the expertly curated luxury assortment that Saks is known for to even more clients across the U.S.\"\n\nEXPANSION AT A GLANCE\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue leveraged insights from existing customers to identify high-potential markets to expand the Fifth Avenue Club to new locations. The service continues to drive high client engagement, and women's ready-to-wear is the leading category amongst visitors to the suites.\n\nThe openings also further Saks Fifth Avenue's continued partnership with leading luxury resort operator Marriott International and its portfolio of luxury brands including The Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis Hotels & Resorts, where nearly half of the locations are located. Auberge Resorts Collection is the key partner in the Fifth Avenue Club's expansion into Texas with the openings in Austin and Fort Worth. The upcoming opening at the Rancho Valencia in Rancho Santa Fe, CA marks the first location within a Relais & Chateaux property.\n\nABOUT THE FIFTH AVENUE CLUB\n\nThe standalone Fifth Avenue Club suites are an extension of the brand's existing Fifth Avenue Clubs, which are located within Saks Fifth Avenue stores. All Fifth Avenue Club locations offer personal shopping and styling appointments, in addition to special events and trunk shows.\n\nThe Fifth Avenue Club recruits skilled personal stylists in local communities to provide clients with expert styling services based on each client's specific needs and preferences, from clothing and accessories to shoes and fine jewelry.\n\nThrough the Fifth Avenue Club, clients are invited to connect with a stylist for a consultation to discuss style preferences, wardrobe needs, sizing and designer preferences. Following the consultation, the stylist utilizes inventory from the full breadth of the Saks Fifth Avenue luxury ecosystem, including both Saks.com and Saks Fifth Avenue stores, when curating merchandise for private Fifth Avenue Club appointments.\n\nFor additional information about the Fifth Avenue Club, including details about upcoming events and how to book an appointment, please visit saks.com/fifth-avenue-club.\n\nFIFTH AVENUE CLUB LOCATIONS\n\nThe complete list of standalone Fifth Avenue Club locations includes:\n\nAustin, TX - Commodore Perry Estate, Auberge Resorts Collection\n\nCharleston, SC - The Dewberry\n\nDeer Valley, UT - The St. Regis Deer Valley\n\nDenver, CO - Hotel Clio, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Denver Cherry Creek\n\nFort Worth, TX - Bowie House, Auberge Resorts Collection **opening Summer 2024\n\nHonolulu, HI - The Ritz-Carlton Residences, Waikiki Beach\n\nLaguna Beach, CA - The Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel\n\nMinneapolis, MN - JW Marriott Minneapolis Mall of America\n\nNapa Valley, CA - Stanly Ranch, Auberge Resorts Collection\n\nNashville, TN - Conrad Nashville\n\nOrlando, FL - The Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes\n\nPalo Alto, CA - Rosewood Sand Hill\n\nRancho Santa Fe, CA - Rancho Valencia Resort & Spa **opening Summer 2024\n\nSavannah, GA - Hotel Bardo\n\nSt. Petersburg, FL - The Vinoy Resort & Golf Club **opening Summer 2024\n\nASSETS\n\nClick here to access Fifth Avenue Club imagery (courtesy of Saks Fifth Avenue)\n\nABOUT SAKS FIFTH AVENUE\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue is the leading name in luxury shopping.
