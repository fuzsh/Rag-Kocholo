        "text": "Fifth Avenue will be closed in both directions to traffic and pedestrians at the Burden Street intersection until May 10 for a city construction project.\n\nTraffic will be redirected down Carney Street for eastbound traffic and down Alward Street for westbound traffic.\n\nThe city is asking people to exercise caution in and around the work zone and pay attention to signage and directions from the construction crew.\n\nUsing alternate routes during construction is recommended.\n\nThe project will replace a valve on the 500mm (20 inch) transmission water main, repairing the sanitary sewer main and removing the concrete valve chamber located in the intersection.\n\nValves are used to control and isolate the flow of water through pipes. The valve in the chamber on Fifth Avenue is broken and the city needs to reestablish control along this transmission water main.\n\nThe valve is essential for control further down the transmission main and other water mains branching off in the area.\n\nThe work could affect water pressure in the area while work is underway but there are no full water outages expected for any residents or businesses.\n\nResidents in the immediate area may notice dirty water going through the watermain during this type of maintenance work, which is normal as sediment is stirred up.\n\nResidents experiencing dirty water can run cold water only through an unfiltered tap such as a bathtub or outside faucet until water clears up.\n\nThe budget allocated for this work is $400,000 funded through the Water Distribution System Renewal budget."
