        "text": "Location: Mid-Park at 74th Street, west of Bethesda Terrace\n\nOne of the most iconic landmarks of Central Park, Bow Bridge is a perfect photo-taking spot.\n\nBow Bridge is one of the most iconic and photographed features of Central Park. Built in 1862, this Victorian-era bridge spans 60 feet across Central Park Lake and connects Cherry Hill and the Ramble.\n\nKnown as a romantic meeting point both in real life and reel life, Bow Bridge offers a picturesque location to stop and enjoy a moment overlooking the row boats as they glide gently along the Lake. It's a popular place for a wedding proposal, a first-date kiss, or a stunning shot of the Fifth Avenue skyline. It has provided a magnificent setting for films such as Manhattan, The Way We Were, and Keeping the Faith.\n\nBow Bridge gets its name from its graceful arc shape which resembles that of an archer's bow. It was designed by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould with Classical Greek refinement, incorporating elements of Gothic, Neo-Classical, and Renaissance design.\n\nIt is the oldest cast-iron bridge in Central Park (also one of the only) and the second-oldest cast-iron bridge in the United States. Displayed along the top outer edges are eight cast-iron replicas of planting urns that originally adorned the bridge in the early 1900s. Through historical restoration using images and what was believed to be one original urn, the 3.5-foot-high cast iron urns were reproduced and reinstalled at their original locations.\n\nThe bridge's walkway was previously constructed from a wood called ipe (a.k.a Brazilian Walnut), which turned a deep red color when wet. In January of 2024, the deck was replaced with new wood that is harder and more durable for the massive amount of foot traffic that the bridge receives."
