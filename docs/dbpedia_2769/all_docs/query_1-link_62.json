        "text": "Thousands of runners will take to the cityâs streets this coming weekend, each with their own personal reason for running 26.2 miles. Very few events can capture the cityâs collective attention, but the TCS New York City Marathon â which twists and turns through all five boroughs â is one of them. Whether youâre looking to avoid the commotion or take in the spectacle, hereâs what to know ahead of the big race in the Big Apple.\n\nWhen does the marathon take place?\n\nThe TCS New York City Marathon typically takes place on the first Sunday of November every year.
