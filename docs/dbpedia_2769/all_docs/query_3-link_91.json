        "text": "We’re making history in New York State once again. Our third branded and licensed dispensary is opening its doors on Wednesday, May 8th, at 9 a.m. Join us for a new adventure in the heart of Manhattan.\n\nEasy travels await. We’re right between Radio City Music Hall and Grand Central\n\nFind us at 587 Fifth Avenue, a prime destination for entertainment, fashion, and tourism. Our dispensary is located next door to H&M’s flagship store and across the street from Lululemon and Sephora.\n\nWe’re right on the edge of the Diamond District between E 47th and E 48th streets. Getting to us is easy: our dispensary is located one avenue from the B/D/F/M line and across the street from the 5th Ave/W 48th St bus stop, serviced by multiple MTA lines. From the east, you can catch the 4/5/6, 7, or S lines from Grand Central Terminal and enjoy a pleasant stroll up the famed Fifth Avenue on the way to our dispensary.\n\nCo-founder Arana Hankin-Biggers exclaims, “It’s an incredible honor for us to partner and bring legal adult-use cannabis to one of the most iconic blocks in New York City. We are equally proud that across our three branded dispensaries we have been able to employ more than 200 people, providing good-paying jobs, benefits, and opportunities for advancement in this exciting, burgeoning industry.”\n\nThe Travel Agency’s third CAURD partnership in New York City\n\nWe’re continuing our commitment to supporting community and social equity in the cannabis industry with our partnership with CAURD licensee Chris T. Concannon, the founder of Terrapin Greens LLC.\n\n“Being located on the most iconic shopping corridor, we hope to further destigmatize the consumption of cannabis, while communicating to the world that cannabis can be synonymous with luxury,” Concannon said.\n\nConcannon’s path to licensure reflects the transformative power of cannabis legalization. He was arrested for cannabis possession in his early 20s and later became a serial entrepreneur. Concannon is the founder and owner of a successful family business in the financial printing industry that has been operating for nearly 30 years.\n\n“Our vision for The Travel Agency is to deliver a unique and elevated cannabis experience to New Yorkers, and through our partnerships with CAURD licensees we’ve also been able to deliver on this promise at scale and support social equity,” says co-founder Paul Yau.\n\nAn impressive legal dispensary that transports you to new places\n\nNew Yorkers can expect the same premium experience that has made The Travel Agency branded dispensaries a favorite – superior and captivating design, the best-curated selection of top-quality cannabis products covering all categories from local and national brands, and the state’s most knowledgeable budtenders, that are trained to provide personalized service.\n\nThe 3,300-square-foot immersive space is designed by award-winning firm Leong Leong. This is a continuation of our commitment to excellence through design and experience — excellence that has received several prestigious Clio Awards for retail design, brand design, and public relations.\n\nVisit The Travel Agency on Manhattan’s famed Fifth Avenue\n\nThe Fifth Avenue location joins our flagship in Union Square and our downtown Brooklyn store. We welcome you to every dispensary seven days a week. Hundreds of products are available at every location, as well as order-ahead convenience and delivery throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, and select Queens neighborhoods. Payments via debit card or cash are accepted.\n\nThe Travel Agency — Fifth Avenue will welcome visitors seven days a week at 587 Fifth Avenue. We’re open from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and 9 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday. We’ll see you soon."
