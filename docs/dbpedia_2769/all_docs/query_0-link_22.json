        "text": "Check outages\n\nThe default settings for this page display elevators only, stations with outages only, and all (ADA and non-ADA) elevators/stations.\n\nSome elevators and escalators in the New York City Transit system are managed and maintained by a third party, such as real estate developers. These have an X in their ID number. Since we donâ€™t maintain these, back-in-service times for them are default estimates. We will update this page when the elevator or escalator returns to service.\n\nReport an outage\n\nWe have two forms for reporting elevator or escalator outages: a subway station-specific form, and our customer feedback form (for LIRR and Metro-North station outages). Please include the date and time you found the outage, the station, and the equipment number. You can find the elevator number above elevator doors. The escalator number is on a panel by the handrail.\n\nReport an outage at a subway station.\n\nReport an outage at LIRR or Metro-North stations."
