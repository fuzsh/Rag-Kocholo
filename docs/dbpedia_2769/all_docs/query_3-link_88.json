        "text": "Centrally located between Union Square and Madison Square Park, 114 Fifth Avenue is in the heart of Fifth Avenue’s shopping district surrounded by vibrant shops, luxury hotels, and popular restaurants and falls within the Ladies’ Mile Historic District. STUDIOS was selected by L&L Holding Company to revitalize the outdated interiors of the 18 story structure as well as transform the rooftop to take advantage of expansive views of Manhattan.\n\nTurning the dark and out-dated lobby into a light and airy entrance that tenants use daily was an obvious decision. Equipped with state of the art turnstiles and large-format marbled walls, the lobby has completely transformed the experience as one walks through the tall herculite double doors to the newly refinished stainless steel elevators. Light illuminates throughout the space as cove lights line the walls above the ceiling, indirectly hitting every white surface to instantly brighten the space.\n\nThe project scope includes the re-design of the building lobbies, completely new mechanical system with rooftop cooling towers, new building generator, a new building management office, new building core mechanical equipment rooms and restrooms at each floor, a rooftop tenant amenity space, and “white-box” tenant floor design as a marketing support.\n\nSTUDIOS has also completed work for nearly all of the building tenants including Mashable, First Look, AKQA, and Gawker."
