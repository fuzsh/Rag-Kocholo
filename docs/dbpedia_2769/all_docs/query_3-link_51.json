        "text": "Construction is now complete at 122 Fifth Avenue, where Bromley Companies has invested more than $100 million to renovate the 11-story office building. Led by STUDIOS Architecture, the building now offers 300,000 square feet of modern office space, a rooftop terrace and pavilion, and a collection of amenity spaces.\n\nThe new amenities include bike storage, showers, a locker room, and a small coffee shop. Exterior improvements include restoration of the building’s historic façade, arched windows, and metal cornice.\n\n“122 Fifth Avenue has been a part of Bromley’s portfolio for nearly five decades and it’s incredible to see our vision for the reimagined space come to life,” said Nicholas Haines, CEO of Bromley Companies. “The Union Square district is flourishing and with the completion of our modern, fully amenitized office space, the neighborhood will only continue to grow as a highly desirable location for office workers, businesses, and patrons. It’s the perfect time to open our doors to office tenants and see the excitement and activity generated by the new rooftop pavilion.”\n\nLocated in the Ladies Mile Historic District, 122 Fifth Avenue was completed around 1900 by Robert Maynicke, an architect credited as a pioneer of modern loft-style buildings. Bromley Companies acquired 122 Fifth Avenue in 1979, marking the company’s first purchase in New York City.\n\nThe Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) approved the developer’s proposals to transform the building in March 2021.\n\n“The transformative restoration, renovation, and expansion of 122 Fifth is reflective of a shared commitment to and care for the urban fabric of this neighborhood,” said David Burns, principal at STUDIOS Architecture, whose team oversaw strategy, planning, architecture, design, and an extensive LPC review process for the project. “It was essential, for both Bromley and STUDIOS, that we completed the block in a way that is simultaneously contemporary, contextually relevant, and historically sensitive. Collectively driven by that intent, the rebirth of 122 Fifth prominently re-establishes its enduring sense of place within Union Square’s excitement.”"
