The association was conceptualized by James Reese Europe and became a cultural reference point for jazz from the 1920s to the 1950s.\n\nNAMA purchased the brownstone, which once served as a rehearsal space and boarding house for musicians such as Jelly Roll Morton, John Coltrane, and Max Roach among others.\n\nPast notable NAMA members include Buster Bailey (clarinetist), Eubie Blake (pianist), Charlie Parker (saxophonist), William Marion Cook (composer, conductor), Rafael Escudero (tubist, bassist), James Reese Europe and Henry Minton (saxophonist and founder of Minton’s Playhouse) among others.\n\nTo learn more, and keep up to date on NAMA events, see:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NAMA19041905/\n\nCar-Free Party and Bicycle Ride"
