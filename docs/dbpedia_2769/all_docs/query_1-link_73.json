        "text": "Brooklyn Bridge, New York (must see)\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge is a suspension bridge crossing the East River from Brooklyn to Manhattan in New York City. Since its construction, the bridge has become an icon of New York City, an outstanding architectural effort that is still admired across the world. The Brooklyn Bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972.\n\nThere had been proposals for a bridge connecting Brooklyn to Manhattan as early as the beginning of the 19th century. The Brooklyn Bridge was designed by civil engineer John Augustus Roebling. His son, Washington Roebling, was the chief engineer of the project. Construction began in 1869 and was completed in 1883. The bridge’s opening day, May 24, 1883, was marked by much celebration and was attended by the President of the United States Chester Alan Arthur.\n\nThe bridge is an early steel-wire suspension bridge. It has a cable-stayed suspension design fitted with vertical and diagonal suspender cables. Its huge stone towers have Neo-Gothic pointed arches. Clearance for shipping on the river is provided by viaducts with long approaches that raise the bridge well above the surface.\n\nThe main span between towers is almost 2,000 feet long. The bridge stretches and contracts up to 16 inches with temperature changes. Navigation clearance is 127 feet above high water. The spans are held up by six trusses parallel to the roadway. The trusses are carried by suspender ropes hanging from the four main cables.\n\nA distinctive feature of the Brooklyn Bridge is an elevated promenade 18 feet above the automobile lanes. The promenade has a white line down the middle to separate cyclists from walkers. A stroll across the elevated pedestrian walkway provides a true New York City experience.\n\nNew York's Central Park Walking Tour\n\nArguably the most famous public park in the world today, Central Park has been called the lungs of New York City – literally “central”, it is where Manhattanites go to get a sense of space and air. Plan for at least half a day to wander along its many pathways, take a rowboat on the water, enjoy the landscaping and the numerous man-made wonders, spend some time at the zoo or bring a pair of... view more\n\nTour Duration: 3 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 4.6 Km or 2.9 Miles"
