        "text": "New York City’s iconic Fifth Avenue is known for many things: world-class museums, luxury shopping, Gilded Age mansions, and famous real estate, along with other attractions, line the 6.2-mile passageway. Still, among its more appealing qualities, it’s often extremely congested and difficult to navigate—which is why New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, wants to give the stretch of the street between 42nd and 59th Street a major makeover. Reimagined as a pedestrian-first public space, Adams announced on December 18 that the city would be expanding sidewalks, increasing green spaces, and providing safer spaces for cyclists and those on scooters.\n\n“Fifth Avenue is an iconic corridor and an engine of our Midtown economy. But it is also an unmissable opportunity to show the city and the country how world-class public space can help create vibrant central business districts,” Mayor Adams said in a statement. “New York isn’t coming back, New York is back. But New Yorkers don’t sit on our hands—we will continue to bring everyone to the table, come up with innovative ideas together, and make our city safer, fairer, and more prosperous.”\n\nThe plan would mainly affect the portion of Fifth Avenue between Bryant Park and Central Park, a stretch most known for high-end shopping and luxury real estate, and comes on the heels of multiple “open street” Sundays, where the road was closed to cars to facilitate shopping and other pedestrian friendly activities during the holiday season. The initiative is part of Adams’ New New York action plan, which includes goals to reimagine 24/7 commercial districts in the city.\n\n“Reimagining and rebuilding our streets and public spaces is the most effective path toward neighborhood recovery, economic recovery, and long-term sustainability,” Maria Torres-Springer, deputy mayor for economic and workforce development, said in a statement. “Building on the success of our Fifth Avenue Open Street, we will deliver a world-class boulevard connecting Central Park to Bryant Park and take a critical step towards a ‘New New York’ and a better, bolder city.”\n\nStill, when plans were announced, many New Yorkers were less than thrilled by the idea. Manhattan’s Borough President, Mark Levine, shared a tweet about the news, to which many expressed frustration and disappointment. In renderings shared by Levine, cars were limited to a single lane, which many believed would add additional congestion to the area. On the other hand, some saw the announcement as a positive goal to promote more public transportation and room for New Yorkers without cars (in 2018, only about 22% of households in Manhattan had a car).\n\nNonetheless, though plans were announced, specific design decisions have yet to be finalized. In the press release about the reimagined Fifth Avenue, the city said it would be selecting a design firm in 2023. Local stakeholders will also convene as a part of a steering group to influence specific changes."
