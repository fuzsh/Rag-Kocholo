        "text": "kpf designs fifth avenue’s tallest residential tower\n\nStanding tall in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, the Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF)-designed residential tower at 520 Fifth Avenue is set to become a new landmark for the New York skyline. Developed by Rabina, a renowned New York-based real estate firm, the 1,000-foot (305-meter) tower can be recognized at once by its facade wrapped in arches, paying homage to the city’s long architectural heritage — including Beaux-Arts icons like the New York Public Library and Grand Central Terminal — all through a fresh, modern lens. The glazed terracotta arches frame expansive ten-foot by ten-foot glass windows, while tiered terraces spiral up the tower.\n\nKPF has unveiled new images of the skyscraper‘s luxury interiors designed by Charles & Co. as residential sales have officially launched.\n\nvisualizations © Binyan Studios\n\nluxury interiors by charles & co.\n\nStepping inside the KPF-designed 520 Fifth Avenue, residents are greeted by a 24-hour attended lobby featuring a custom arched mosaic floor and elegant reeded walnut walls. The interiors throughout the building have been curated by Charles & Co. From residences to amenities and the private club, the spaces evoke a contemporary reading of timeless New York style.\n\n‘Our aim for a project of this caliber was to design residential spaces that evoke a unique atmosphere, while naturally reflecting the ethos and function of the entire building,’ says Vicky Charles, founder of Charles & Co. ‘We drew inspiration from 520 Fifth’s iconic surrounding environment to capture the glamour of NYC’s past with infusions of contemporary sensibilities. The interiors at 520 Fifth are both welcoming and glamorous, defying traditional expectations for a home in the sky of New York City.’\n\nresidences open onto gardened outdoor space as tiered terraces spiral up the tower\n\nThe light-filled residences at 520 Fifth Avenue open broadly out toward the city through KPF’s expansive arched windows. With high ceilings, ranging from ten feet to over fourteen feet, the spaces are curated with wide-plank white oak floors, adding warmth to the lofty rooms. Kitchens feature top-of-the-line appliances, ribbed walnut islands, and quartzite slab countertops and backsplashes. Meanwhile, bathrooms offer a spa-like experience with marble countertops, herringbone marble flooring, and polished nickel fixtures. One- to four-bedroom homes occupy the tower’s top forty stories, providing residences of all sizes access to the building’s highest floors with views across both the East River and the Hudson and beyond. The 88th floor houses a residents-only amenity floor, featuring a glass-walled solarium, lounge, dining room, library, and game room.\n\nFifth Avenue’s tallest residential tower is backdropped by the Empire State Building\n\n‘Our design for 520 Fifth Avenue places residential and office space above a club function within a 1,000-foot-tall tower,‘ explains James von Klemperer, KPF President and Design Principal. ‘The building steps back following the zoning envelope, echoing Hugh Ferris’ architectural visions of 1920’s New York. The massing is further articulated by arched window modules inspired by neighborhood landmarks… These arches convey a sense of warmth well suited to the welcoming character of spaces within the building.’\n\nthe lobby is accessed through a double-height entry portico"
