        "text": "122 Fifth Avenue Achieves LEED Gold Certification In Union Square, Manhattan\n\nThe Bromley Companies announced that 122 Fifth Avenue has been awarded LEED Gold Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. The 11-story office building in Union Square, Manhattan yields 300,000 square feet of retail and office space and was recently renovated by STUDIOS Architecture. The property has an L-shaped massing with frontage on both Fifth Avenue and West 17th Street.\n\nAmenities at 122 Fifth Avenue include bike storage, private locker rooms, and rooftop terraces. The building is also targeting a Fitwel certification in addition to its LEED Gold Certification.\n\nA key contributor to 122 Fifth’s energy efficiency is Nantum AI, an artificial intelligence software that automates building systems based on real-time occupancy data, minimizing power consumption.\n\n“122 Fifth was redesigned to improve tenant experience and sustainability,” said Nicholas Haines, CEO of Bromley Companies. “Our Nantum AI platform enables real-time calculations of energy, costs, and carbon emissions reduction.”\n\nLEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is a globally recognized rating system for green buildings. In the U.S., buildings account for nearly 40 percent of national CO2 emissions. LEED-certified buildings, however, have 34 percent lower CO2 emissions and consume less energy and water.\n\nThe closest subways from 122 Fifth Avenue are the F and M trains at the 23rd Street station. Beyond that, the 4, 5, 6, L, N, Q, R, and W trains are accessible from the 14th Street-Union Square station.\n\nSubscribe to YIMBY’s daily e-mail\n\nFollow YIMBYgram for real-time photo updates\n\nLike YIMBY on Facebook\n\nFollow YIMBY’s Twitter for the latest in YIMBYnews\n\n."
