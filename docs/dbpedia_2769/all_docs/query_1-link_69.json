        "text": "Whatever it is you're into, you'll find there's more to do in New York than you'll have time.\n\nCheck out the views from the top of the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, or One World Observatory. Take yourself on a museum crawl, starting at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on the northeastern edge of Central Park. Then, make your way north several blocks to the Guggenheim Museum and eventually to the Museum of the City of New York, one of the best places to learn about the Big Apple's history.\n\nGo to Chinatown for dim sum and to Little Italy for cannoli. Head to a jazz club in Harlem, check out the independent artist galleries that dot Chelsea, shop along Fifth Avenue, and pay a visit to the Statue of Liberty.\n\nYou could spend an entire day in Central Park alone, checking out its zoo, carousel, lakes, and ice rink. A number of gardens and meadows make for excellent people-watching and host impromptu musical performances on nice days. Traveling in the summer? Make sure to check the schedule for Shakespeare in the Park.\n\nPrefer sports, movies, and live music? See the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, the New York Mets at Citi Field, or the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Track down sites from your favorite movies and TV shows. Seinfeld, Sex and the City, \"When Harry Met Sally,\" \"Sleepless in Seattle,\" \"Serendipity,\" and \"Home Alone 2\" are just a small fraction of what's been filmed here.\n\nNew York is a city filled with attractions, but some of its most interesting experiences are sure to be the ones you accidentally stumble upon on the way to somewhere else. Whatever it is you're looking for, you can find it in New York. Check off your packing list, and remember: Just don't try to do everything in one trip.\n\nTime Zone\n\nEastern Standard Time\n\nBest Time to Go\n\nNew York is a city that's always celebrating something, and summer is one of the best times to visit. Outdoor concert season is in full swing. Free movies and theatrical performances fill the city's parks, street vendors are everywhere, and street fairs abound. But subway platforms can get steamy, lines can get long, and temperatures can soar among the city's high-rises. If this sounds like misery, visit between Thanksgiving and the New Year, when temperatures are cooler and department store windows are decked out for the holidays. During this time, Manhattan's three major outdoor ice rinks are open, a giant Christmas tree marks Rockefeller Center, and holiday light shows are more elaborate than anything you could ever imagine.\n\nThings to Know\n\nNew York is a city made up of five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Most tourist attractions are in Manhattan, with a few scattered across Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx.\n\nDriving in Manhattan is unnecessary. The city has an extensive public transit system, making it easy to get just about anywhere by subway, bus, cab, and foot. Uber and Lyft are plentiful, while parking can be both a miserable and expensive experience. Meanwhile, the subway is open 24/7.\n\nNew York is a city that moves fast. Step aside to look at your phone, and remember to stand on the right side of the escalator so hurried commuters can walk on the left.\n\nTimes Square characters can be pushy. Tipping is at your discretion.\n\nHow to Get Around\n\nTrains: The New York City subway is one of the most extensive public transit systems in the world. It connects Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, and runs on Staten Island. Each ride costs $2.75. A seven-day pass is available for $33 and covers both trains and buses.\n\nBuses: A network of buses offers easy access to the rare spots not served by nearby train stations and to New York's LaGuardia Airport. Individual bus rides cost $2.75. Seven-day transit passes cost $33 and cover trains and buses. While buses can be convenient, traffic can sometimes make them easy to outwalk.\n\nFerries: One of the best ways to hop among New York's boroughs in good weather is a ferry. Ferries connect Queens, the western coast of Brooklyn, the eastern side of Manhattan, and Staten Island. Rides are $2.75 each. Subway and bus passes aren't accepted on New York ferries. The Staten Island Ferry is free.\n\nTaxis: Cabs are all over Manhattan, but a little harder to find in parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Green cabs offer service in northern Manhattan and the outer boroughs. To hail a cab, look for one that has its light on and raise your arm. All New York cabs are metered and required to accept credit cards.\n\nRideshare: Uber and Lyft are all over New York and offer similar pricing. Rideshare can be the best way to travel in parts of Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nBest Hotels\n\nThe Plaza\n\nAddress: 768 5th Ave., New York, NY 10019\n\nPhone: (212) 759-3000\n\nBook Now\n\nIf money is no object and you can afford to check into the best New York City hotels — or always dreamt of sleeping in a castle — this is the property for you.

Now, once again, the cornerstone of Downtown Brooklyn's restaurant scene, Gage & Tollner gives plenty of nods to its history, through both the food and largely Gilded Age-inspired design.

Its restaurants are small, lines can be long, and reservations aren't an option. But don't worry — this ramen is worth the wait. Totto is known for using a rich, chicken-based broth instead of a more traditional pork-based version, and for serving up some of the best noodles in Manhattan. There are now three Totto Ramen locations in Midtown Manhattan. The 52nd Street location is the original.\n\nMarea\n\nAddress: 240 Central Park S., New York, NY 10019\n\nPhone: (212) 582-5100\n\nWebsite\n\nMarea is one of the city's top seafood restaurants. This high-end spot at the edge of Central Park has earned two Michelin stars and the 2010 James Beard Award for best new restaurant. Chef Michael White gets his inspiration from coastal Italy — don't miss the branzino, Adriatic seafood soup, or the stuffed calamari. Can't decide? Opt for a multi-course prix-fixe menu or a chef's tasting menu.\n\nCi Siamo\n\nAddress: 385 9th Ave., New York, NY, 10001\n\nPhone: (212) 219-6559\n\nWebsite\n\nThe newest restaurant from famed New York City restaurateur Danny Meyer, Ci Siamo, which translates to \"here we are\" or \"we've finally arrived,\" brings a bit of Italian flair to Hudson Yards on the west side. With plush leather and velvet seating, plus subtle midcentury modern decor touches, the interior of the restaurant is meant to evoke the comfortable feeling of dining in someone's home. Chef Hillary Sterling even has a custom-built grill to accommodate various temperatures at once, as she cooks up selections like wood-fired whole trout.\n\nH&H Bagels\n\nAddress: Multiple Locations\n\nWebsite\n\nYou can't visit New York without eating an iconic NYC bagel. But why not eat that bagel where Seinfeld's Kramer used to work? H&H was once the largest bagel maker in New York and one of the largest bagel manufacturers in the world, making an estimated 80,000 rounds per day. Nowadays, its two locations feed New Yorkers on the Upper East and Upper West Sides of Manhattan.\n\nBonnie's\n\nAddress: 398 Manhattan Ave., Brooklyn, NY, 11211\n\nPhone: (914) 875-3709\n\nWebsite\n\nNamed after chef Calvin Eng's mom, Bonnie's, in Brooklyn, is self-described as Cantonese American cuisine, with a varied menu that includes nods to some of Eng's favorite food memories, including glazed pork served on a sesame milk bun, mimicking a high-end McRib sandwich. The popular Williamsburg restaurant is closed on Mondays and offers reservations from Tuesday to Sunday, though they leave a few tables and seats at the bar open for walk-ins.\n\nDominique Ansel\n\nAddress: 189 Spring St., New York, NY 10012\n\nPhone: (212) 219-2773\n\nWebsite\n\nThis Soho bakery is perhaps best known for creating the cronut, a magical blend of croissant and donut in new flavors revealed each month. But Dominique Ansel offers so much more. Among the treats not to miss: torched-to-order frozen s'mores with a vanilla ice cream center covered in chocolate wafer crisps and honey marshmallows.\n\nDowling's\n\nAddress: 35 E. 76th St., New York, NY, 10021\n\nPhone: (212) 744-1600\n\nWebsite\n\nThis new, fine art-covered restaurant located within The Carlyle, A Rosewood Hotel is under the guidance of executive chef Sylvain Delpique — previously of 21 Club — with a menu nearly as timeless as New York itself. The throwback favorites, including wedge salad, shrimp cocktail, and steak, are sure to be crowd favorites, though there are distinctly modern sections of the menu, too. Jackets are recommended for dinner service, though if you prefer to dine sans sport coat, Dowling's does an impressive lunch service complete with mini-martinis.\n\nSAGA\n\nAddress: 70 Pine St., New York, NY, 10005\n\nPhone: (212) 339-3963\n\nWebsite\n\nPerched atop the 63rd floor of a landmark Art Deco tower, SAGA offers a modern European tasting menu from acclaimed duo James Kent and Jeff Katz, known for building their careers at top New York City institutions like Eleven Madison Park and Del Posto. At this modern fine-dining spot, reservations are hard to grab; lucky diners who do snag one will need to prepay the full nonrefundable menu price of $245 each, with a minimum reservation for two.\n\nSerendipity III\n\nAddress: 225 E 60th St., New York, NY 10022\n\nPhone: (212) 838-3531\n\nWebsite\n\nThis is a place guaranteed to satisfy your sweet tooth. The legendary sweet shop and general store opened in 1954 and has since become a go-to for celebrities like Marilyn Monroe, Andy Warhol, Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, Cher, and Beyonce.

The restaurant has made appearances in the movies \"Serendipity,\" \"One Fine Day,\" and \"Trust the Man.\"\n\nXi'an Famous Foods\n\nAddress: Multiple Locations\n\nWebsite\n\nWith several locations across New York, this chain of family-run restaurants specializes in authentic western Chinese food. The company's CEO was born in Xi'an, one of China's oldest cities.
