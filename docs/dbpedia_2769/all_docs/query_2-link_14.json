        "text": "Helping people cross bridges! (Literally)\n\nThis is great for anyone interested in getting their steps while walking across bridges and learning about the history of bridges and the surrounding area. We will also meet some military heroes along the way and more.\n\nI've walked across all the Manhattan bridges and would like to share that experience as we explore the Harlem River Bridges with its surrounding area and see how things are connected and enjoy amazing views of the Harlem River. One example of a bridge walking tour: we start from the Third Avenue bridge then back over the Madison Avenue Bridge to the 145th Street Bridge and finally zig zag over the Macombs Dam Bridge from the Bronx back into Manhattan.\n\nThere will be a fee which will help cover hosting / event fees."
