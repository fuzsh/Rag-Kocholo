In this guide, we will walk you through the five boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island.\n\nNYC by the Borough\n\nManhattan: The Heart of The Big Apple\n\nManhattan, often regarded as the heart of New York City, may be the most iconic island in the country.
