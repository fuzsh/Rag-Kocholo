        "text": "Good morning. It’s Friday. Today we’ll find out how one kind of snowflake was overhauled and why it has been 655 days — and counting — since a substantial amount of another kind of snowflake was seen in Central Park.\n\nThis newsletter is about a snowflake that has had a little cosmetic work done.\n\nIt’s not a snowflake that dances down from the sky, shimmering like a diamond in the pale wintry light, only to melt after morphing into grimy slush. This snowflake shimmers from 50 feet up. It is the giant illuminated snowflake that floats over the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street.\n\n“It needed to be refreshed,” said George Stonbely, the advertising entrepreneur who oversees the snowflake.\n\nSo its 16,500 crystal light fixtures were cleaned. More than 600 double-sided miniature LEDs were installed, tripling the number on the side branches. The halogen lights around the steel-and-chrome core were replaced with projection LEDs. And the core was polished.\n\n“It’s still the same beautiful shape and structure that it was when it was designed in the early 2000s,” Stonbely said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
