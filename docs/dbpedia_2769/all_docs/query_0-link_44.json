        "text": "The weather finally broke, and it has cooled down to a pleasant 87 degrees. Thank God because it was a nice day in the City walk around and visit the Flatiron District without sweating like crazy. The last few walks I have done in the neighborhood have been in the mid 90’s and that got to be too much.\n\nI had spent the morning working in Social Services at the Soup Kitchen, helping people with things like getting clothes, writing out haircut vouchers and getting them toiletries. It is a lot of running around but the best part was that I really felt that I was helping people in need. The weather cooperated, and it was so nice to be outside enjoying the sunshine. It was a productive afternoon.\n\nAfter I finished lunch, I was off to walk the Avenues of the Flatiron District. I have to admit that this has been one of the harder neighborhoods to research because there are so many amazing buildings to view, and the architecture is so detailed that it takes time to look up at all the ornamentation on the buildings. As I said in my previous blog on the borders of the neighborhood, these companies built these buildings to impress and last forever.\n\nI started the walk at the intersection of Broadway, Fifth Avenue and West 25th Street at the General Worth Memorial, a distinct triangle park right across the street from Madison Square Park. This is the Memorial to and burial site of General William Jenkins Worth.\n\nWilliam Jenkins Worth was a native New Yorker (Hudson, NY) and decorated Army officer who had served our country in the Battles of 1812, The Second Seminole War and the Mexican American War. His series of campaigns shaped this Country to where it is today. He died working for the Department of Texas in 1849 (Wiki).\n\nArmy General William Jenkins Worth\n\nThe General’s remains are buried under the monument at Worth Square at the corner of Fifth Avenue, Broadway and East 24th and 25th Street. General Worth was interned here in November of 1857 on the anniversary of the British leaving the colonies (NYCParks.org).\n\nThe Worth Monument between East 24th and East 25th Street at Broadway and Fifth Avenue\n\nThe Worth Monument was designed by artist James Goodwin Batterson, whose main profession was one of the founders of the Travelers Insurance Company in Hartford, CT and helped design the Library of Congress Building in Washington DC. He had immersed himself in his father’s quarrying and stone importing business early in his career and traveled extensively to Europe and Egypt for the job. He designed this monument in 1857 (Wiki).\n\nArtist and Designer James Goodwin Batterson\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_G._Batterson\n\nTurning the corner at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue is Madison Square Park, named after our fourth President of the United States, James Madison. This well landscaped park is the gathering place of the residents of NoMAD and has a wonderful playground that has been busy the whole time I have spent in the neighborhood.\n\nMadison Square Park is an interesting little oasis from all the traffic and office space. It has an interesting history since it was designated a public space in 1686 by British Royal Governor Thomas Dongan. It has served as a potter’s field, an arsenal and a home for delinquents. In 1847, the space was leveled, landscaped and enclosed as a park. It became part of the New York Park system in 1870. There are many historical figures featured in the park (NYCParks.org). The park today is a major meeting spot for residents and tourists alike with a dog track and the original Shake Shack restaurant.\n\nMadison Square Park in the Spring when I was walking the length of Broadway\n\nhttps://madisonsquarepark.org/\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/madison-square-park\n\nWhen I walked into the park to take a break, it must have been the busiest section of the neighborhood between the playground and the original Shake Shack that were serving food to a crowd clung to their cellphones.\n\nAnother sculpture that is in Madison Square Park is the statue of William Henry Stewart, the former Governor of New York State, US Senator and Secretary of State during the Civil War. He also negotiated the Alaskan Purchase in 1867.\n\nGovernor William Henry Stewart statue in Madison Square Park\n\nGovernor William Henry Sewart, who negotiated the Alaskan Purchase “Sewart’s Folly”\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Seward#:~:text=William%20Henry%20Seward%20(May%2016,as%20a%20United%20States%20Senator.\n\nThe statue was designed by artist Randolph Rogers an American born sculptor who studied in Italy. He was a Neoclassical artist known for his famous historical commissions.\n\nArtist Randolph Rogers\n\nhttps://www.shsart.org/randolph-rogers\n\nMadison Square Park is noted for its beautiful plantings, shaded paths and for being home to the first Shake Shack, a Danny Meyers restaurant and popular upscale fast-food restaurant.\n\nThe very first Shake Shack is in Madison Square Park\n\nhttps://www.shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park/\n\nAs you look down further on the square, you will see the Flatiron Building one of the most famous and most photographed buildings in New York City. The building was designed by Daniel Burnham as a Renaissance Palazzo with Beaux-Arts style. The original name for the building was the “Fuller Building” for the Company. The name “Flatiron” comes from a cast iron clothes iron from the turn of the last century. (Wiki)\n\nThe ‘Flatiron’ Building at 175 Fifth Avenue at 23rd Street\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatiron_Building\n\nAs you pass the Flatiron Building and continue the walk south between 23rd and 14th Streets, take a look up to admire the buildings that once help make up the “Ladies Shopping Mile”, once the most fashionable neighborhood after the Civil War for shopping, hotels and entertainment (See my blog in MywalkinManhattan.com “Walking the Ladies Shopping Mile”).\n\nMy Christmas Blog on “Victorian Christmas in New York City”: Day One Hundred and Twenty-Eight:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/8117\n\nThe buildings that line Broadway from the Flatiron Building until you get to Bowling Green Park at the tip of Manhattan are some of the most beautiful and detailed examples of Victorian architecture and were built between 1870 to about 1915. You really need to put the cellphone down and look up when walking south on both sides or you might miss the details of these buildings.\n\n907 Broadway-The Warren Building\n\nhttps://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/bushwick/907-broadway/83372\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-1891-warren-building-nos-903-907.html\n\nThe Warren Building is another example of turn on the last century elegance. Designed by Stanford White of McKim, Mead & White in 1896, the building was designed in the Neo-Renaissance style (Daytonian).\n\nOne of the most elegant buildings on this part of Broadway is the former “Lord & Taylor” building at 901 Broadway. The building was constructed for the department store in 1870 and was the main store until 1914. Really take time to look at the detail work of the store and step inside. The Mansard Roof is an amazing touch. In 2022, it is now a restaurant on the lower level.\n\n901 Broadway “Lord & Taylor” building from 1870-1914\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/former-lord-taylor-building\n\nI walked back through Madison Square Park after my walk down Broadway and there were two small jazz concerts that were going on at opposite side of the park. Two three person combos were entertaining people by the fountain and near Shake Shack and on a sunny after there was a pretty big crowd enjoying the park and listening to the music.\n\nWalking down Fifth Avenue was interesting on both sides as you will notice how ornate the buildings are as you travel from West 25th to West 20th Street leading me to believe how important of a shopping and business district this once must have been. Here and there from the Flatiron Building you can see all the elegant and ornate buildings that line the Avenue.\n\nI started my walk south down Fifth Avenue and here and there you need to look up and admire the details of the buildings. On the corner of Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street is 186 Fifth Avenue, which was built for the Western Union Telegraph Company in 1883.\n\n186 Fifth Avenue-The Western Union Telegraph Company Building\n\nhttps://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/flatiron-union-square/186-fifth-avenue/39081\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-1883-western-union-building-186.html\n\nThe building was designed by architect Henry J. Hardenberger in the Queen Anne style with its details being in brick and terra cotta (Daytonian in Manhattan). The building just finished a restoration, and you can see the details by the windows and dormers.\n\nAt 170 Fifth Avenue and West 22nd Street, you can see the beauty and elegance of the Beaux Art details of the former Sohmer Piano building. The building was built between 1897-88 and designed by architect Robert Maynicke for the owners of the Sohmer Piano Company for their showrooms and offices. The company was known for its introduction of the baby grand piano (Wiki/Daytonian in Manhattan).\n\n170 Fifth Avenue-The Sohmer Piano Building\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sohmer_Piano_Building\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/06/1898-sohmer-piano-co-building-170-fifth.html\n\nAt 166 Fifth Avenue, the building has almost a confectionary look of a wedding cake. This commercial building was constructed in 1900 by the architectural firm of the Parfitt Brothers in the Northern Renaissance Revival style with all sorts of embellishments around the windows and doors with an elaborate roof design. In the beginning it housed art galleries and upscale retailers until the area became manufacturing at the turn of the last century. It has made a full swing again as a luxury retailer building on street level (Daytonian in Manhattan/Streeteasy/LoopNet.com).\n\n166 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/07/parfitt-brothers-no-166-fifth-avenue.html\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/166-5-avenue-new_york\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/166-Fifth-Ave-New-York-NY/25113417/\n\nOn the corner of West 21st Street and Fifth Avenue is 162 Fifth Avenue, another impressive building with interesting details. This office building was built in 1930 and is still used for commercial purposes.\n\n162 Fifth Avenue and West 21st Street\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/162-5-avenue-new_york\n\nhttps://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/united-states/properties/for-lease/retail/ny/new-york/162-fifth-avenue/s120974483s120974559-l\n\nAt the edge of the neighborhood standing guard in the Flatiron District is 156 Fifth Avenue, the Presbyterian Building. This building has an interesting past being built for the Presbyterian Church for offices for missionary work when the neighborhood housed many religious institutions (Daytonian in Manhattan/LoopNet.com).\n\n156 Fifth Avenue and West 20th Street\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/02/presbyterian-building-156-fifth-avenue.html\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/156-Fifth-Ave-New-York-NY/14050649/\n\nIt was designed by architect James B. Baker in the French Gothic style, and you have to admire the roof for its unique details.\n\nThe detail in the entrance of the building\n\nAs I rounded the corner of the neighborhood at West 20th Street another building caught my eye at 150 Fifth Avenue, the former Methodist Book Concern. The building was built between 1888-90 and designed by architect Edward Hale Kendall in the Romanesque Revival style. It had originally held the offices, printing and a chapel for the church. This was the section of Fifth Avenue that housed many religious offices and headquarters (Wiki).\n\n150 Fifth Avenue-The Methodist Book Concern\n\nhttps://www.150fifthave.com/\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/02/methodist-book-concern-150-5th-avenue.html\n\nWalking north back up Fifth Avenue is 141 Fifth Avenue another confection of architecture. This gorgeous building was built in 1897 by architect Robert Maynicke, who had also designed Sohmer Piano Building at 170 Fifth Avenue, in the Beaux Arts style for the Merchant Bank of New York (Flatironnomade.nyc/fsiarchitecture.com).\n\n141 Fifth Avenue-The Merchants Bank of New York Building\n\nhttp://www.fsi-architecture.com/building-renovations/141-fifth-avenue-new-york-ny\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/141-fifth-avenue-new_york\n\nThis impressive bank has recently been converted to luxury apartments with a current one sold at over three million dollars.\n\nThe entrance to 141 Fifth Avenue\n\nI made my way back up Fifth Avenue and admired all these buildings once again. Each has their own style and design and since the time of their construction continue to live on in different forms for various companies. Since many were built at the turn of the last century it also proved to me how well constructed and designed these buildings are and how desirable they are in the marketplace as you will not see this construction again. These were made to last and give this section of Manhattan its unique appearance and its own sense of character.\n\nThe Flatiron District from Fifth Avenue and East 23rd Street\n\nThe beauty of the Flatiron District at night\n\nI found myself hungry again and took the subway back down to Chinatown to visit many of the takeout places and bakeries that were on my list to visit. I have been building up my blog, DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com and wanted to see how many of them had stayed open post pandemic. Many of these little ‘hole in the wall’ restaurants are going strong as Chinatown is continuing to come back to life.\n\nMy blog “DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/\n\nI started my walk in Chinatown at China North Dumpling at 27A Essex Street across from Seward Park for some fried dumplings and spring rolls. For ten large fried dumplings that were really juicy and well cooked, four spring rolls and a Coke it was $7.00. Everything was so well made, and you can watch from the counter the ladies making the fresh dumplings right in front of you. The place is real bare bones, but the food and the service are amazing. Try to eat at the counter and watch everything get prepared.\n\nChina North Dumpling at 27A Essex Street located in the Lower East Side\n\nhttp://www.china-north-dumpling.com/\n\nThe Dumplings at China North Dumpling are made right in front of you\n\nIn needed something sweet after all the fried foods so I headed back to Yue Lai Bakery at 137 East Broadway to look for a baked pork bun. They had none left at that time of the day, but they were having a special on their baked goods three for $2.00 and I picked out a Coconut Bun, a Cream filled Bun and a Plain Bun.\n\nThey bagged it all up for me and I walked over to Sewart Park across the street and sat on the benches and ate them one by one. The Cream and Plain buns were really good and very sweet, and everything was so soft and well baked. I ended up sharing the Coconut Bun with the little birds in the park who surrounded me looking for a handout.\n\nYue Lai Bakery at 137 East Broadway\n\nhttps://www.menupix.com/nyc/restaurants/250454930/Yue-Lai-Bakery-New-York-NY\n\nThe buns at Yue Lai Bakery are delicious\n\nAfter a nice rest in the park and enjoying the sunshine and watching families play with their kids, I found myself still hungry. So, I walked down Hester Street from the park and made my way to King Dumpling this time for some steamed Pork and Chive Dumplings. For ten dumplings and a Coke it was only $5.00. The Steamed Pork & Chive Dumplings were excellent and again were freshly made right in front of us. They are large and well-cooked and burst with juiciness when you bite into them.\n\nKing Dumpling at 74 Hester Street\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Chinese-Restaurant/King-Dumplings-358670851431724/\n\nhttps://www.menupix.com/nyc/restaurants/31859492/King-Dumplings-New-York-NY\n\nSteamed Dumplings at King Dumplings are also made right in front of you\n\nThe place was packed with customers and people getting takeout. It is amazing to me how many people write about both King Dumpling and China North Dumpling and I had never really noticed them before. I saw them on a Fung Brothers “Cheap Chinatown Eats” video and then wanted to try them.\n\nMy last stop on the eating tour because even after twenty dumplings, four spring rolls, three pastries and three Cokes, I was still hungry and needed that baked pork bun. I found it at Happy Star Bakery at 160 East Broadway and it was just $1.75. Not the $3.50 in Midtown as I recently found at Dim Sum Sam in the Theater District. It was soft and chewy and filled with the most amazing, chopped pork and baked into a sweet dough. I barely made it out the door and I was finished with it.\n\nHappy Star Bakery at 160 East Broadway\n\nhttps://zmenu.com/happy-star-bakery-corp-new-york-online-menu/\n\nThe roast pork buns are amazing\n\nAfter all the munching on snacks throughout the afternoon, I needed a good walk so I double backed and walked around the Twin Bridges section of the neighborhood walking down Henry, Madison, Rutgers and Clinton Streets around the public housing projects looking at all the small businesses that still catered to the people in the projects.\n\nIt is really a funny section of the City in that in-between the cut rate stores, and discount pizzerias are tiny gourmet restaurants, coffee bars and art galleries. It is really a case of extremes all over this section of the neighborhood and shows that both Twin Bridges and Chinatown south are going through a change in both residents and the businesses that cater to them.\n\nWith Little Italy slowly fading away (down to just four blocks now from forty at the turn of the last century), I can see the same changes happening in Chinatown as well. It is just another sign of Manhattan going through a metamorphosis.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what I will find when I reach this section of Manhattan in the near future.\n\nPlaces to Eat:\n\nChina North Dumpling\n\n27A Essex Street\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\nhttp://www.china-north-dumpling.com/\n\nOpen: Sunday-Saturday 9:00am-11:00pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d7608410-Reviews-China_North_Dumpling-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/2981\n\nYue Lai Bakery\n\n137 East Broadway\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\n(917) 257-2263\n\nhttps://www.menupix.com/nyc/restaurants/250454930/Yue-Lai-Bakery-New-York-NY\n\nOpen: Sunday-Saturday 6:00am-7:30pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d24850332-Reviews-Yue_Lai_Bakery-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/2996\n\nKing Dumpling\n\n74 Hester Street\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\n(917) 251-1249\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Chinese-Restaurant/King-Dumplings-358670851431724/\n\nhttps://www.restaurantji.com/ny/new-york/king-dumpling-/\n\nOpen: Sunday-Thursday 9:00am-10:00pm/Friday 9:00am-9:00pm/Saturday 9:00am-10:00pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d17726251-Reviews-King_Dumpling-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/2988\n\nHappy Star Bakery\n\n160 East Broadway\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\n(212) 608-8899\n\nhttps://zmenu.com/happy-star-bakery-corp-new-york-online-menu/\n\nOpen: Sunday 6:30am-7:00pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/diningonashoestringinnyc.wordpress.com/3043\n\nPlaces to Visit:\n\nMadison Square Park\n\n11 Madison Avenue\n\nNew York, NY 10010\n\n(212) 520-7600\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/madisonsquarepark/\n\nhttps://madisonsquarepark.org/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/madisonsquarepark\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d501513-Reviews-Madison_Square_Park-New_York_City_New_York.html\n\nMy review on VisitingaMuseum.com:\n\nSeward Park\n\nCanal and Essex Streets\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\n(212) 639-9675\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/seward-park/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seward_Park_(Manhattan)\n\nOpen: Sunday-Saturday 7:00am-10:00pm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nRead my other blogs on walking the Flatiron District:\n\nDay Two Hundred and Forty-Four: Walking the Avenues of the Flatiron District:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/25776\n\nDay Two Hundred and Forty-Two: Walking the Borders of the Flatiron District:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/24726\n\nDay Two Hundred and Forty-Seven: Walking the Streets of the Flatiron District:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/25874\n\nReading Blogs on NoMAD, Rose Hill, and Kips Bay:\n\nPlease read my other blog on walking the Avenues and Streets of NoMAD/Rose Hill:\n\nDay One Hundred & Ninety: Walking the Streets and Avenues of NoMAD/Rose Hill:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/16776\n\nPlease read my other blog on walking the Borders of NoMAD/Rose Hill:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/16580\n\nPlease enjoy my blog on ‘Walking the Borders of Kips Bay’ on MywalkinManhattan.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/15049\n\nPlease enjoy my blog on ‘Walking the Streets of Kips Bay’ on MywalkinManhattan.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/15954\n\nPlease enjoy my blog on “Walking the Avenues of Kips Bay” on MywalkinManhattan.com:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/15820\n\nThe Flatiron District along the Fifth Avenue Corridor"
