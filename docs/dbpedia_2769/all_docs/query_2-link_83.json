        "meta_description": "The fan favorite known as our Bridge Route returns for the fourth consecutive year! \n\nMeetup- New York City Hall at 6:15AM \n\nUse this time to use the bathroom at Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts and stretch out and do some strides. \n\nAs you can see, two bridges have been removed. Listening to feedback, traffic in Harlem and The Bronx can easily disrupt a good flow, so we've simplified the Long Run. Once you've reached 86th Street and 1st Avenue, make a LEFT TURN and run to 5th Avenue and make a right turn to 90th Street to enter Engineers Gate. \n\nBRIDLE TEMPO- Here, you can take advantage of soft surfaces and really finish strong. You will have already reached over 11 high quality miles. Each extra loop is around 1.65 Miles. You can even finish close to Half Marathon and 10K pace and close out another successful destination run. \n\nPlease RSVP at your earliest convenience and familiarize yourself with the route! \n\nPOST RUN PARTY @ URBAN ATHLETICS- UA has graciously invited us to crash their store at 90th Street and Madison Avenue! The address is 1291 Madison Ave\n\nThe nature of this run has a lot of bridges very early in the run with plenty of turns. Inside of the first 4 miles, you will have already put the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridge under your belt. \n\nIf you can, please see if you can arrange any bikers willing to carry bags and take plenty of pictures and host water stations. See you on June 22nd!",
