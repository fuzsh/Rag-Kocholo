These transformations allow for a range of activities that promote economic development, support schools, facilitate pedestrian and bike mobility, and provide new ways for New Yorkers to enjoy cultural programming and build community.\n\nNYC DOT works with a diverse set of partners to implement Open Streets citywide, including:\n\nFormal or informal community-based organizations (such as block associations, business improvement districts, civic groups, non-profits, etc.)\n\nEducational institutions (such as schools (pre-K to 12), colleges, or universities)\n\nGroups of businesses (merchant groups, neighboring entities, etc.)\n\nHouses of worship\n\nNYC DOT’s Public Realm Programming effort helps bring engaging activities to public spaces throughout the city. All activities are free and open to New Yorkers of all ages and abilities.\n\nThe Public Space Equity Program (PSEP) addresses the needs of public spaces in under-resourced neighborhoods where community-based partner organizations need support in maintaining a high-quality public space.\n\nOpen Streets Rules\n\nIn 2024, NYC DOT adopted rules to codify the Open Streets application process and program requirements, as well as clarify criteria for eligible open streets partners and corridors and establish a regulatory framework for how the program will be managed and operated. Review Open Streets Rules\n\nLearn More & Apply\n\nThe 2024 Open Streets application is now open!\n\nIn 2024, both new and returning partners must apply to manage an Open Street in their community. Returning partners can complete a streamlined application by providing their 2023 application ID. New partners must submit a full application.\n\nApplication:\n\nApplications are now being accepted on a rolling basis until fall 2024. Each application requires a minimum of 90 days of review before NYC DOT approves or rejects an application.\n\nQuestions or concerns? Not sure where to start? Contact us online to schedule a meeting with a member of the Open Streets team before applying.\n\nPlease contact us online if you need assistance applying in another language.\n\nTypes of Open Streets\n\nThere are three types of Open Streets:\n\nLimited Local Access\n\nStreet designated for pedestrian and cyclist use and enjoyment, during a specified set of hours and days each week, where local vehicle access is permitted, such as for parking, collecting or dropping off passengers, making deliveries and loading, Access-A-Ride vehicle access, or emergency vehicle access. Drivers are advised to drive 5 MPH.\n\nFull Closure\n\nStreet that is temporarily closed to vehicles to allow for a range of car-free activities that support local businesses, community organizations, and schools, to create a space for the public to gather. Emergency access and an emergency lane must be clear at all times for emergency vehicle access.\n\nFull Closure: Schools\n\nStreet that is temporarily closed to vehicles to support schools for drop-off and pick-up operations, recess, and outdoor learning.\n\nLocations & Hours\n\nOpen Streets hours are subject to change and may include setup and breakdown time. Updated map coming soon. Please review the location tables below for the most up to date Open Streets.\n\nOpen Street locations available for download on NYC Open Data\n\nPlease note: there may be a delay in updates to the
