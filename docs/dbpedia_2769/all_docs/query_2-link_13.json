        "text": "Only 2,011 more to go ...\n\nThe University Heights Bridge\n\nSpans Manhattan to the Bronx crossing the Harlem River.\n\nFrom 207th Street in Inwood to West Fordham Road in University Heights.\n\nBefore the current bridge was erected, a wooden footbridge known as the 'Fordham Footbridge' crossed the the same point of the then shallow, Harlem River. This bridge was removed in 1895 when the Harlem River Ship Channel was dug and the northern stretch of the river became navigable by ships.\n\nReplacing the bridge turned out to be a bit more complicated than expected. The New York City Department of Bridges favored a newfangled lift bridge, but the city wouldn't pay for it and opted for a cheaper 'swing' style. The Broadway Bridge was due for replacement as part of the opening up of the river, and so they decided to reuse the center span of the Broadway Bridge in the new University Heights Bridge.\n\nAlfred P. Boller, who designed the Madison Avenue, 145th Street and Macombs Dam swing bridges, designed the New University Heights Bridge as well, and work began in November 1903.\n\nThe old Broadway Bridge span was floated down the river and lifted onto the new center pier in June 1906.\n\nThe University Heights Bridge opened to traffic on January 8, 1908.\n\nBeginning in 1989, the NYCDOT undertook a $35 million project to rebuild the bridge. A new swing span was barged to the site and hoisted into place, and new electrical and mechanical controls were installed. The renovation was completed in 1992.\n\nThe swing mechanism below the center span of the current bridge.\n\nView from the span looking South down the Harlem River towards the Alexander Hamilton Bridge.\n\nThe similarity to the Macombs Dam Bridge is most obvious in the aesthetic of the bridge, most prominently in the little decorative gazebos and frivolous decorative elements that adorn both bridges.\n\nBut the University Heights Bridge suffers in comparison due to it's location.\n\nFrom 10th Avenue on one end to the entrance of the Major Deegan Expressway on the other, according to the DOT, the bridge carries 45,000 vehicles per day (as of 2007?).\n\nCrossing on foot or by bicycle is done only via the sidewalk and the approach on the Bronx side is especially hazardous due to traffic.\n\nThe University Heights bridge celebrated it's 100th birthday in 2008 with little fanfare although it is one of only ten bridges in New York City to have been granted landmark status.\n\nThe University Heights Bridge circa 1933\n\nFrom the collection of the NYPL\n\nType of bridge: Swing\n\nConstruction started: November 18, 1903\n\nOpened to traffic: January 8, 1908\n\nLength of main span: 267 feet\n\nLength of two channels: 100 feet\n\nTotal length of bridge and approaches: 1,566 feet\n\nWidth of bridge: 50 feet\n\nWidth of roadway: 33 feet, 6 inches\n\nNumber of traffic lanes: 2 lanes\n\nClearance at center above mean high water: 25 feet\n\nFoundation type: Caisson\n\nCost of original structure: $1,200,000\n\nBridge facts from NYC Roads.com\n\nView Larger Map\n\nOnly 2,012 more to go ...\n\nThe Grand Street Bridge\n\nSpans - Brooklyn to Queens over the East Branch of the Newtown Creek (Possibly AKA the English Kills?)\n\nFrom Gardner Avenue in Brooklyn to 47th Street in Queens\n\nGrand Street is a two-lane local City street in Queens and Kings Counties. Grand Street runs northeast and extends from the Brooklyn Queens Expressway in Brooklyn to Queens Boulevard in Queens.\n\nThe road is known as Grand Street west of the bridge and Grand Avenue east of the bridge.\n\nThe Grand Street Bridge is a 69.2m long swing type bridge with a steel truss superstructure.\n\nThe general appearance of the bridge remains the same as when it was opened in 1903. The bridge provides a channel with a horizontal clearance of 17.7m and a vertical clearance, in the closed position, of 3.0m at Median High Water and 4.6m at Median Low Water.\n\nThe bridge structure carries a two-lane two-way vehicular roadway with sidewalks on either side. The roadway width on the bridge is 6.0m and the sidewalks are 1.8m wide. The height restriction is 4.1m.\n\nThe approach roadways are wider than the bridge roadway. For example, the width of Grand Avenue at the east approach to the bridge (near 47th Street) is 15.11m.\n\nBridge facts from NYC DOT\n\nThe Grand Street Bridge is one of five (need to fact check this as of 07/08) bridges which connect Brooklyn to Queens across the Newtown Creek and it's branches, Maspeth Creek and The English Kills.\n\nThose Bridges are:\n\nThe Pulaski Bridge\n\nThe Greenpoint Avenue/JJ Byrne Memorial Bridge\n\nThe Kosciuszko Bridge\n\nThe Grand Street Bridge\n\nand the Metropolitan Avenue Bridge\n\n\"The Newtown Creek is a murky estuary that runs 3 1/2 industrialized miles along the border of Greenpoint, Brooklyn and Maspeth, Queens. Once a site of mansions, then a mecca for shipbuilders, the creek is now a toxic dumping ground that bubbles up raw sewage every time it rains. Newtown Creek has been given the lowest possible cleanliness rating by both New York City and New York State. The Riverkeeper, wrote of the creek:\n\n\"It fails to meet even the most basic goals of the 1972 Clean Water Act. Nearly the entire stretch of the creek is heavily industrialized, there is virtually no public access, and water dependent industries have stagnated. A boat trip up the creek is a journey into the heart of darkness, with the backdrop of the Manhattan skyline as a reminder of its real world locale.\"\n\npbs.org\n\nPedestrian and Bicycle Access:\n\nThere is a pedestrian pathway on this bridge, but I don't recommend cycling on it.\n\nMost cyclists merge into traffic and cross the metal grating because the Brooklyn side of the path is a completely demolished, uneven dirt path and stairs.\n\nRandom Bridge Factoids:\n\nThe Grand Street Bridge looks very similar in character and design to the Carroll Street Bridge which was completed in 1889. Unfortunately, this bridge hasn't received as much love over the years and it shows.\n\nThe Newtown Creek has a long history of tragedy:\n\n* January 1894: At least four workers dredging the creek died after a flimsy foot bridge they were standing upon collapsed.\n\n* July 1894: Two boys, apparently brothers, drowned after they evidently got caught in the “ooze and slime” at the bottom of the creek, which is composed of soft sediment.\n\n* January 1896: A Polish priest of the Roman Catholic Church fell into the creek and drowned.\n\n* June 1910: A boy, roughly age 12, drowned in the creek at the foot of Ten Eyck Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. His clothing was found nearby.\n\n* February 1928: A 29-year-old worker was killed when a 325-ton draw span was moved upstream to make way for a new bridge.\n\n* January 1934: Two men drowned after their car plunged into the creek from the Penny Bridge, linking Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and Long Island City, Queens.\n\n* November 1942: A 28-year-old diver drowned in the creek off Review Avenue in Long Island City “when his diving helmet became detached in an undetermined manner while he was searching for a link in an oil pipe crossing the creek,” The Times reported.\n\nNYTimes\n\nJanuary 26, 1896, New York Times\n\n\"The unguarded condition of Newtown Creek at the Grand Street Bridge, was responsible for another drowning accident early yesterday morning. The victim was a tall, heavily built man, who, from papers found in his pockets, is supposed to be the Rev.

The bridge connects Smith Street and Second Avenue over the Gowanus Canal and is the first canal crossing north of the Gowanus Bay.\n\n\"The bridge is comprised of two bridges, each consisting of one bascule span with each span carrying four lanes of one-way traffic (one northbound and one southbound) and a pedestrian sidewalk.

The Hamilton Avenue Bridge is one of the two remaining structures of this type.\"\n\nSource: Hardesty & Hanover LLP September 13, 2007\n\nThe Bridge is currently undergoing reconstruction.\n\nThe reconstruction will replace the entire bridge in two stages. Completion is scheduled for January 2009.\n\nOn June 28, 2008 at 12:01 am the entire southbound bridge will be taken out of service. The current 4-lane northbound bridge will be converted to 2 lanes northbound and 2 lanes southbound to facilitate the replacement of the southbound bridge.\n\nThe Hamilton Avenue Bridge has a vertical clearance of 19 feet at\n\nmean high water, and 23 feet at mean low water in the closed position.\n\nThe existing drawbridge operating regulations require the bridge to open on signal at all times.\n\nWant to get the bridge open?\n\nDrawbridge Operation Regulations; Gowanus Canal, Brooklyn, NY\n\nAGENCY: Coast Guard, DHS.\n\nThe draw of the Hamilton Avenue Bridge, mile 1.2, shall open on\n\nsignal after at least a four-hour advance notice is given by calling\n\n(201) 400-5243.

It was big enough to carry vehicles and a proposal is now on the table to revisit the idea. Due to increased security in post - 9/11 NYC, water traffic is often re-routed away from the United Nations to the East Channel of the river. The passing ships require that the Roosevelt Island drawbridge be raised, cutting the island off to vehicles.\n\nIn an article published Feb, 4 1909, the New York Times reported that 235 people had applied for permission to be the first to jump off the soon to be completed bridge.

It is one of very few toll bridge in NYC, and carries four motor traffic lanes and a (free) 5’ wide foot/cyclepath on the western edge.\n\nBuilt under the auspices of the Marine Parkway Authority in 1937, the bridge was designed by Aymar Embury II, who was also the architect of the Bronx-Whitestone and Triborough Bridges. In 1978, the bridge was renamed for Gil Hodges, the former first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Hodges retained his relationships in Brooklyn after the team moved to Los Angeles, later played for the New York Mets, and then managed them from 1968 until his death in 1972. We do love our baseball in NYC.\n\nIn 1938, the bridge’s first full year of operation, 1.9 million vehicles crossed the bridge; in 2006, 7.8 million did. The vertical lift was raised 157 times in 2006 to allow vessels to pass through the Rockaway Inlet. The center span is 540 feet long and is only 55 feet above the water but can be lifted up to a height of 150' feet above the water. When it opened, the bridge had the longest vertical lift span in the world; it is still the longest vertical lift span for vehicular traffic in North America.\n\nBridge Information from MTA info\n\nBoth ends of the bridge today are within the Gateway National Recreation Area connecting Floyd Bennett Field and Jacob Riis Park. Bridge traffic surges by more than 50 percent during the summer as city dwellers make their way to the beach.\n\nSeen in the distance from the Shore Parkway\n\nThe M.T.A. offered this historical tidbit in a news release commemorating the Bridge’s 70th Anniversary:\n\nThe morning of July 3, 1937, marked the grand opening of the new Marine Parkway Memorial Bridge. With the sun shining and the N.Y.P.D. Police Band ready to play, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, Robert Moses, head of the Marine Parkway Authority and city Parks Commissioner and other officials, were getting ready to embark in a 500-car motorcade to christen the bridge.\n\nThere was excitement in the air as the band tuned up from its designated place on the bridge’s elevated lift span and invited guests got into cars on the Brooklyn side of the bridge along Flatbush Avenue for the inaugural ride across the span.\n\nBut the first vehicle to cross the bridge did not belong to the mayor or master builder Robert Moses, who helped make the bridge a reality. About 15 minutes before the ceremonies were scheduled to start, the first vehicles to cross the span were three engine companies from Brooklyn; summoned to help put out a five-alarm fire that destroyed two blocks of wooden concession stands along the Rockaway Beach Boardwalk.\n\nEven before its official opening, the bridge proved it was an asset to the community. Mayor La Guardia pointed out that if the bridge wasn’t there, it would have taken the Brooklyn fire companies precious minutes to travel to the old Cross Bay Bridge, four miles to the east.\n\nThe Police Band, which scrambled off the lowered lift before the fire trucks screamed across the bridge, resumed their post and the ceremony went on as planned. A gun salute from nearby Fort Tilden announced the beginning of the event, which included a fireboat pumping streams of water into the air and a flyover by nine Martin bomber planes from nearby Mitchel Field.\n\nToday, during the anniversary celebration, a Rockaway Point Volunteer Fire Department truck led the motorcade, the authority said, “in a nod to history.”\n\nQuoted from the NY Times\n\nView of Coney Island with the Verrazano Narrows Bridge in the distance from the center span of the bridge.\n\nToll info Effective March 16, 2008\n\nCash $2.50\n\nToken $1.67\n\nE-Zpass $1.55\n\nRockaway Resident Token $1.40\n\nRockaway Resident E-Zpass $1.03\n\nToll Information from MTA info\n\nType of bridge: Vertical lift-span\n\nConstruction started: June 1, 1936\n\nOpened to traffic: July 3, 1937\n\nLength of main lift-truss span: 540 feet\n\nLength of side truss spans: 540 feet\n\nTotal length of bridge and approaches: 4,022 feet\n\nNumber of traffic lanes: 4 lanes\n\nClearance at lift span above mean high water: 55 feet\n\nClearance at lift span in raised position: 150 feet\n\nSteel used in through truss spans and towers: 7,600 tons\n\nSteel used in deck truss spans: 3,800 tons\n\nConcrete used in truss piers: 24,000 cubic yards\n\nConcrete used in deck truss spans: 23,000 cubic yards\n\nCost of original structure: $12,170,000\n\nBridge Statistics from NYCRoads\n\nView Larger Map\n\nChanging New York: Photographs by Berenice Abbott, 1935-1938\n\nFrom the NYPL Digitial Collection\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge as seen by Berenice Abbott in 1936.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge photographed from Water Street in 2008\n\n\"Photographer Berenice Abbott proposed Changing New York, her grand project to document New York City, to the Federal Art Project (FAP) in 1935. The FAP was a Depression-era government program for unemployed artists and workers in related fields such as advertising, graphic design, illustration, photofinishing, and publishing. A changing staff of more than a dozen participated as darkroom printers, field assistants, researchers and clerks on this and other photographic efforts. Abbott's efforts resulted in a book in 1939, in advance of the World's Fair in Flushing Meadow NY, with 97 illustrations and text by Abbott's fellow WPA employee (and life companion), art critic Elizabeth McCausland (1899-1965). At the project's conclusion, the FAP distributed complete sets of Abbott's final 302 images to high schools, libraries and other public institutions in the metropolitan area, plus the State Library in Albany.\n\nAbbott was born and raised in Ohio where she endured an erratic family life. In 1918, after two semesters at Ohio State University, she left to join friends associated with the Provincetown Players, in Greenwich Village. There she met Djuna Barnes, Kenneth Burke, Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Little Review editors Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap, and other influential modernists. From 1919-1921, while studying sculpture, Abbott supported herself as an artist's model, posing for photographers Nikolas Muray and Man Ray. She also met Marcel Duchamp, and participated in Dadaist publications.\n\nAbbott moved to Paris in 1921, where she continued to study sculpture (and in Berlin), and to support herself by modeling. During 1923-1926, she worked as Man Ray's darkroom assistant (he had also relocated to Paris) and tried portrait photography at his suggestion. Abbott's first solo exhibition, in 1926, launched her career. In 1928 she rescued and began to promote Eugène Atget's photographic work, calling his thirty years of Parisian streetscapes and related studies \"realism unadorned. \"\n\nIn 1929 Abbott took a new artistic direction to tackle the scope (if not the scale) of Atget's achievement in New York City. During 1929-38, she photographed urban material culture and the built environment of New York, documenting the old before it was torn down and recording new construction. From 1934-58, she also taught photography at the New School. During 1935-39, Abbott worked as a \"supervisor\" for the Federal Art Project to create Changing New York (her free-lance work and New School teaching commitment made her ineligible for unemployment relief) .\n\n1970 saw Abbott's first major retrospective exhibition, at the Museum of Modern Art. Her first retrospective portfolio appeared in 1976, and she received the International Center of Photography's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989. She died at home in Monson, Maine in December 1991.\"\n\nQuoted from The NYPL Digital Gallery\n\nFor a non bridge specific view of Abbott's work, see both the original, Berenice Abbott: Changing New York and Douglas Lefevre's New York Changing: Revisiting Berenice Abbott's New York\n\nOnly 2,016 more to go...\n\nLooking towards Brooklyn from the East River\n\nSpans - Manhattan-Brooklyn, East River\n\nDelancey Street, LES to Broadway, Williamsburg Brooklyn.\n\nConstruction on the bridge began in 1896, and the bridge opened on December 19, 1903. Leffert L. Buck was chief engineer and Henry Hornbostel was architect. It was the second bridge to span the East River in NYC and at the time it was constructed, it set the record for the longest suspension bridge span on Earth which it took from it's neighbor, the Brooklyn Bridge, which had held the title for 17 years.\n\nWrapping Cables on the Williamsburg Bridge - From the NYPL Collection\n\n\"It is an unconventional structure, as suspension bridges go; though the main span hangs from cables in the usual manner, the side spans leading to the approaches are cantilevered, drawing no support from the cables above. The main span of the bridge is 1600 feet (488 m) long. The entire bridge is 7308 feet (2227 m) long between cable anchor terminals, and the deck is 118 feet (36 m) wide. The height at the center of the bridge is 135 feet (41 m) and each tower is 335 feet (102 m); these measurements taken from the river's surface at high water mark.\n\nThis bridge and the Manhattan Bridge are the only suspension bridges in New York City that still carry both automobile and rail traffic. In addition to this two-track rail line, connecting the New York City Subway's BMT Nassau Street Line and BMT Jamaica Line, there were once two sets of trolley tracks.\"\n\nwikipedia\n\n\"For a brief period, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) ran passenger service along an elevated extension across the Williamsburg Bridge into Manhattan. The LIRR spur split from the existing Atlantic Avenue line northwest onto the Broadway elevated line (today's J, M and Z subway lines), crossed the Williamsburg Bridge, and continued south to Chambers Street.\n\nThe bridge not only served the traffic needs of a growing population, but also greatly affected migration patterns of ethnic groups. Before the bridge opened, first- and second-generation Irish and German settlers (who called the enclave \"Kleine Deutschland\") lived in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. When it opened, an influx of Jewish settlers from the overcrowded Lower East Side crossed the \"Jews' Bridge\" into Williamsburg. In turn, long-time residents moved out to Queens.\n\nAs early as 1964, The New York World-Telegram and Sun reported that the bridge had fallen in such a state of disrepair that rust rained down on pedestrians. The only fresh paint was the graffiti scrawled in by vandals. During the 1970's, the pedestrian walkways were closed after a maintenance worker was mugged while doing his job.\"\n\nnyc roads.com\n\nIn the 1980's, the Bridge was in terrible condition after years of neglect and the City's near bankruptcy during the 1970's. It was closed completely for emergency repair work and for many years following was under constant renovation which impacted traffic in one direction or the other. Trains were re-routed and followed a strict speed limit when crossing the bridge. In 1999 service halted entirely to allow repairs on the center lanes of the bridge which carry train traffic.\n\n\"The Williamsburg Bridge is one of the major crossings of the East River, carrying approximately 140,000 motorists, 92,000 subway/bus riders, 600 bikers and 500 pedestrians between the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn and serving some of the busiest arteries in New York City.\"\n\nNYCDOT\n\nView of the Pedestrian and Bike Pathway Entrance on Delancey Street in Manhattan.\n\n\"The new footpath/bikeway has one common access point for pedestrians and cyclists in Manhattan at Clinton Street, which leads to a crossover before the main span of the bridge to enable people to access either the north or south paths. The north path is open to both pedestrians and bicyclists and leads to an access point at Washington Park in Brooklyn. The south path is dedicated to pedestrians an leads to an access point at Bedford Avenue. Completion of the new north walkway also means that, for the first time ever, the bridge is accessible to wheelchair users and meets the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\"\n\nNYCDOT\n\nOne of my favorite little NY hidden gems is the fact that the pedestrian and bike paths end at Roebling Street on the Brooklyn side. That would be the street named after John A. Roebling, civil engineer and designer of the Brooklyn Bridge, which the Williamsburg Bridge superseded as the world's longest suspension bridge of it's time.\n\nType of bridge: Suspension\n\nConstruction started: November 7, 1896\n\nOpened to traffic: December 19, 1903\n\nLength of main span: 1,600 feet\n\nLength of side spans: 300 feet\n\nLength, anchorage to anchorage: 2,200 feet\n\nTotal length of bridge and approaches: 7,308 feet\n\nNumber of traffic lanes: 8 lanes\n\nNumber of subway tracks: 2 tracks\n\nHeight of towers above mean high water: 310 feet\n\nClearance at center above mean high water: 135 feet\n\nNumber of cables: 4 cables\n\nLength of each of four cables: 2,985 feet\n\nDiameter of each cable: 18¾ inches\n\nTotal length of wires: 17,500 miles\n\nWeight of cables and suspenders: 4,344 tons\n\nStructural material: Steel\n\nTower material: Steel\n\nDeck material: Steel\n\nCost of original structure: $24,200,000\n\nBridge statistics from nyc roads.com\n\nView Larger Map\n\nOnly 2,017 more to go...\n\nSpans - The Gowanus Canal, Brooklyn\n\nAccording to the DOT,\n\n\"The Union Street Bridge is a double leaf Scherzer rolling lift bascule supporting Union Street over the Gowanus Canal in the borough of Brooklyn.\"\n\nThe Union Street Bridge is the northernmost of five bridges which cross the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn.
