Barabbas

Stagione 1

Based on the Nobel Prize winning novel by PÃ¤r Lagerkvist, Barabbas is a miniseries that explores the epic story of the ultimate biblical sinner. Barabbas, the great robber, brigand and freedom-fighter is compelled to ponder the meaning of redemption for the rest of his life after he is spared from crucifixion when Pilate manipulates the crowd into pardoning him, rather than Jesus Christ.
