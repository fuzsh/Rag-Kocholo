In the Jamesian novel, Wells charged, “you will find no people with defined poli¬ tical opinions, no people with religious opinions, none with clear partisanships or with lusts or whims, none definitely up to any specific impersonal thing.” Wells con¬ cluded: “It is leviathan retrieving pebbles.” James was desperately wounded. He was at the close of his great span of illumination — it was less than a year before his death — and he was being set aside as useless, “a church lit but without a congregation.” Replying to Wells, he defended himself on the question of the utility of art. Literature, he asserted, is “for use”: “I regard it as relevant in a degree that leaves everything behind.” There followed the famously characteristic Jamesian credo, by now long familiar to us. “It is art,” he wrote, “that makes life, makes interest, makes importance ... I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process.” And though he was speaking explicitly of the novel’s purpose as “the extension of life, which is the novel’s great gift,” there\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nis evidence enough that he would not have excluded the lit¬ erary essay, of which he was equal master, from art’s force and beauty. Thus, what Henry James knew. To which Wells retorted: “I had rather be a journalist, that is the essence of it.” In the quarrel between Wells and James, James’s view has been overtaken by times and habits far less elevated in their literary motives (and motifs) than his own, and by radical changes in the aims of education and in the impulses that drive the common culture. What James knew was the nobility of art — if, for him, the novel and the literary essay were not splendors just short of divine, then they were, any¬ how, divining rods, with the capacity to quiver over the springs of discovered life. What Wells knew was some¬ thing else—the future; us; what we are now. He welcomed the germinating hour of technology’s fecundity, and flou¬ rished in it. James, we recall, switched from pen and ink to the typewriter,\n\nnot because he was attracted\n\nto\n\nmachines—he was not — but because he suffered from writer’s cramp. He never learned to type himself; instead, he dictated to a typist—a technological regression, in a way, to the preliterate oral; or else an ascendance to the dominant priestly single voice. Wells, by contrast, was magnetized by the machine-world. Imagine him our con¬ temporary: his study is mobbed by computer, printer, modem, e-mail, voice-mail, photocopier, fax, cable—the congeries and confluence of gadgets and conveniences that feed what the most up-to-date colleges advertise as “com¬ munications skills.” The truth of our little age is this: nowadays no one gives a damn about what Henry James knew. I dare to say our “little’’ age not to denigrate (or not only to denigrate), but because we squat now over the remnant embers of the last\n\nIntroduction\n\ndiminishing decade of the dying twentieth century, pos¬ sibly the rottenest of all centuries, and good riddance to it (despite modernism at the start and moonwalking near the middle). The victories over mass murder and mass delu¬ sion, West and East, are hardly permanent. “Never again” is a pointless slogan: old atrocities are models (they give permission) for new ones. The worst reproduces itself; the best is singular. Tyrants, it seems, can be spewed out by the dozens, and their atrocities by the thousands, as by a copy machine; but Kafka, tyranny’s symbolist, is like a finger¬ print, or like handwriting, not duplicatable. This is what Henry James knew: that civilization is not bred out of machines, whether the machines are tanks or missiles, or whether they are laser copiers. Civilization, like art its handmaid (read: hand-made), is custom-built. Let this not be mistaken for any sort of languorous preRaphaelite detachment from science or technology, or, heaven forfend, as a complaint against progress and its re¬ liefs. Gratitude for anaesthesia and angioplasty and air travel, and for faxes and computers and frozen food and the flush toilet and all the rest! Gratitude, in truth, for Mr. Gradgrind and the Facts, and for those who devise the Facts—especially when those facts ease the purely utilitar¬ ian side of life. What distinguishes the data of medicine and science is precisely that they can be duplicated: an experi¬ ment that cannot be repeated will be discarded as an unreliable fluke, or, worse, as a likely forgery. In the realm of science, what is collective has authority. It is the same with journalism: if two reporters witness an incident, and the two accounts differ, one must be wrong, or must at least promote distrust. A unique view, uncorroborated, is with¬ out value. Wells, in discrediting James, was in pursuit of public and collective discriminations, as opposed to the 3\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\npurely idiosyncratic; he was after consensus-witnessing, both in science and society, and a more recognizable record, perhaps, even of lust and whim. Defined political and re¬ ligious opinions, clear partisanships, persons definitely up to some specific impersonal thing. Defined, definite, specific — how, what, when, where: the journalist’s catalogue and catechism. Naming generates categories and headings, and categories and headings offer shortcuts — like looking something up in the encyclopedia, where knowledge, abbreviated, has already been codified and collected. James’s way, longer and slower, is for know¬ ledge to be detected, inferred, individually, laboriously, scrupulously, mazily —knowledge that might not be found in any encyclopedia. “I had rather be a journalist, that is the essence of it” — hark, the cry of the common culture. Inference and detec¬ tion (accretion heading toward revelation) be damned. What this has meant, for literature, is the eclipse of the essay in favor of the “article” —that shabby, team-driven, ugly, truncated, undeveloped, speedy, breezy, cheap, im¬ patient thing. A while ago, coming once again on Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Virginibus Puerisque” — an essay not short, wholly odd, no other like it, custom-made, solicit¬ ing the brightness of full attention in order to release its mocking charms—I tried to think of a single periodical today that might be willing to grant print to this sort of construction. Not even “judicious cutting,” as editors like to say, would save Stevenson now. Of course there may be an instantly appropriate objection to so mildewed an obser¬ vation. Stevenson is decidedly uncontemporary — the tone is all wrong, and surely we are entitled to our own sounds? Yes, the nineteenth century deserves to be read — but re¬ member, while reading, that it is dead. 4\n\nIntroduction\n\nAll right. But what of the “clear partisanship” of a book review encountered only this morning, in a leading journal dedicated to reviews? “Five books, however rich and absorbing, are a hefty number for the reader to digest,” the reviewer declares, commenting on Leon Edel’s multi¬ volume biography of Henry James: “a little amateur sleuthing some years ago suggested to me that the number of people who bought Mr. Edel’s quintet bore little relation to the number who succeeded in battling their way through them. ” (Amateur sleuthing may be professional gall. “Suc¬ ceeded in battling,” good God! Is there a paragraph in Edel’s devoted work, acclaimed as magisterial by two gen¬ erations, that does not seduce and illuminate?) Edel, however, is not under review; he is only a point of contrast. The book in actual question,\n\na fresh biography of\n\nJames — in one volume — is, among other merits, praised for being admirably “short.” It is “attention span” that is victor, even for people who claim to be serious readers. And writers may give themselves out as a not dissimilar sample. Now and then you will hear a writer (even one who does not define herself as a journalist) speak of her task as “communication,” as if the meticulous making of a sen¬ tence, or the feverish uncovering of an idea, or the sting of a visionary jolt delivered by what used to be called the Muse, were no more artful than a ten-minute telephone conversa¬ tion. Literature may “communicate” (a redundancy, even a tautology), but its enduring force, well past the routine of facile sending and receiving, is in the consummation, as James tells us, of life, interest, importance. Leviathan rises to kick away the pebble of journalism. Yet the pebble, it seems, is mightier than leviathan. The ten-minute article is here, and it has, by and large, displaced the essay. The essay is gradual and patient. The article is 5\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nquick, restless, and brief. The essay reflects on its pre¬ decessors, and spirals organically out of a context, like a green twig from a living branch. The article rushes on, amnesiac, despising the meditative, reveling in gossip and polemics, a courtier of the moment. Essays, like articles, can distort and lie, but because essays are under the eye of history, it is a little harder to swindle the reader. Articles swindle almost by nature, because superficiality is a swin¬ dle. Pessimists suppose that none of this is any longer reversible. That the literary essay survives in this or that academic periodical, or in a handful of tiny quarterlies, is scarcely to the point. It has left the common culture. Some doubt whether there is a common culture now at all, whether it is right to imagine that “the West” retains any resonance of worthy meaning; or even that it should. To claim commonality is, paradoxically, to be written off as elitist. Politically, through exploration, exploitation, and contempt, the West has spread elitism and exclusion; but it has also spread an idea of democratic inclusiveness so powerful—all of humanity is made in the image of the One Creator—that it serves to knock the politics of contempt off its feet all over the world. The round earth, like an hour¬ glass, is turned upside down these days, spilling variegated populations-in-motion into static homogeneous popula¬ tions, south into north, east into west; the village mentality, with its comfortable reliance on the familiar, is eroded by the polychrome and polyglot. America, vessel of migrations, began it. Grumbling, Europe catches up. While the kaleidoscope rattles and spins, and tribe assaults tribe, no one can predict how all this will shake itself out; but the village mentality is certainly dead. The jet plane cooked its goose.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nBetween the last paragraph and this one, I took a quick trip to Paris. This is not the sort of thing a hermitlike scribbler usually does; generally it is a little daunting for me to walk the three short blocks to Main Street. But the rareness of such a plummeting from one society into another, perhaps because one’s attention becomes preternaturally height¬ ened, somehow illumines the notion of commonality. I crossed an ocean in an airplane and found, on the opposite shore, almost exactly what I left behind: the same congeries of concerns. The same writers were being talked about, the same world news (starvation, feuding, bombing) was being deplored; only the language was different. So there really is a “West” —something we mostly forget as we live our mostly Main Street lives. Suppose, then, the language were not different but the same? And if “commonality” requires more persuasive evidence than a transoceanic flight, there is, after all, the question (the answer, rather) of English — setting aside Shaw s quip about America and Britain being separated by a common language. The mother-tongue, as the sweet phrase has it, is a poet’s first and most lasting home, his ineradicable patrio¬ tism.* In my teens I read Katherine Mansfield: what did a New York-born Jewish girl whose family had fled the boot of the Russian Czar have in common with a woman born in New Zealand forty years earlier? And what did this * I know a European writer of genius, in love with his language, whose bad luck it was to have been born just in time to suffer two consecutive tyrannies. It is a won¬ der that this writer lived past childhood. At the age of five, under Hitler, he was torn from his home and shipped to a concentration camp. Having survived that, he was spiritually and intellectually crushed by the extremes of Communist rule, including a mindless and vicious censorship. Currently, after the fall of the dicta¬ tor, and having emigrated to America, he is being vilified in the press of his native land for having exposed one of its national heroes as a programmatic antisemite. After so much brutalization by the country of his birth, it would be difficult to ex¬ pect him to identify himself as a patriot. But that is what he is. He is a patriot of his mother-tongue, and daily feels the estrangement of exile. Propatna dulce mon!\n\n7\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nwoman of the farthest reaches of the South Pacific have in common with an island off the continent of Europe? How rapidly the riddle is undone: Keats and Shelley and Cole¬ ridge\n\nand\n\nWordsworth,\n\nto\n\nbegin\n\nwith.\n\nThe\n\ngreat\n\ntree-trunk of English literature ... no, that grand image ought to give way to something homelier. Call it the drawstring of English letters, which packs us all into the same sack, at the bottom of which—as we tumble around all mixed up down there, North Americans, Australians, Nigerians, South Africans, Jamaicans, numbers of Indians, and on and on—lies a hillock of gold. The gold is the idea (old-fashioned, even archaic, per¬ haps extinct) of belles-lettres. Some will name it false gold, since English, as language and as literature, came to the Caribbean, and to New York, and to all those other places, as the spoor of empire. (Spooky thought: if not for the Czar of All the Russias, and if not for mad King George III, and if not for their anachronistic confluence, I would not now be, as I am, on my knees before the English poets. Also: no native cadences of Hawthorne, Melville, Emerson, Thoreau, Dickinson, Faulkner, Mark Twain, Cather!) The Shropshire Lad for a while bestrode the world, and was wel¬ come nowhere. But Milton and Mill and Swift and George Eliot and E. M. Forster came along as stowaways — “Areopagitica,” and “The Vindication of the Rights of Women,” and “A Modest Proposal,” and Daniel Deronda and A Pas¬ sage to India. These hardly stand for the arrogance of parochialism\n\nand it is just this engagement with belles-\n\nlettres that allows parochialism to open its arms, so that the inevitable accompaniment of belles-lettres is a sense of in¬ debtedness.\n\nIt takes a great deal of history to produce a\n\nlittle literature,\n\nJames noted: everything that informs\n\nbelles-lettres is in that remark, and also everything that 8\n\nIntroduction\n\nmilitates against the dismissal of either the term or the con¬ cept. If I began these reflections in curmudgeonly resentment of the virtual annihilation of what Henry James knew—of the demise of the literary essay—it is only to press for its rescue and reclamation. Poetry and the novel will continue to go their own way, and we can be reasonably confident that they will take care of themselves. But the literary essay needs and merits defense: defense and more—celebrants, revivification through performance. One way or another, the literary essay is connected to the self-conscious progres¬ sion of a culture, whereas the essay’s flashy successor—the article, or “piece” —is in every instance a pusher of Now, a shaker-off of whatever requires study or patience, or what used to be called, without prejudice, ambition. The essayist’s ambition is no more and no less than that aware¬ ness\n\nof\n\nindebtedness\n\nI\n\nspoke\n\nof\n\na\n\nmoment\n\nago—indebtedness to history, scholarship, literature, the acutest nuances of language. Is this what is meant by “elitism ”? Perhaps. I think of it as work, if work is construed (as it ought to be) as “the pas¬ sion of exactitude and sublimity.\n\nThe latter phrase I\n\nborrow from a young essayist in London — my daughters age exactly—who, because of a driven Parnassian ardor and because he is still in his twenties, has, I trust, the future of belles-lettres secreted in his fountain pen. In the newest lit¬ erary generation, the one most assailed by the journalist s credo of Now, it is a thing worth marveling at: this deter¬ mination to subdue, with exactitude and sublimity, the passionless trivia of our time.\n\n9\n\nT. S. Eliot at ioi “The Man Who Suffers and the Mind Which Creates”\n\nThomas Stearns eliot,\n\npoet and preeminent modernist,\n\nwas born one hundred and one years ago. His centennial in 1988 was suitably marked by commemorative reporting, literary celebrations in New York and London, and the publication of a couple of lavishly reviewed volumes: a new biography and a collection of the poet’s youthful letters. Probably not much more could have been done to distinguish\n\nthe occasion; still,\n\nthere was something\n\nsubdued and bloodless, even superannuated, about these memorial stirrings. They had the quality of a slightly tedious reunion of aging alumni, mostly spiritless by now, spurred to animation by old exultation recollected in tranquility. The only really fresh excitement took place in London,\n\nwhere\n\nrepresentatives of the usually docile\n\ncommunity of British Jews,\n\nincluding at least one\n\nprominent publisher, condemned Eliot for antisemitism and protested the public fuss. Elsewhere, the moment passed modestly, hardly noticed at all by the bookish young — who, whether absorbed by recondite theorizing in the 10\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101\n\nacademy, or scampering after newfangled writing careers, have long had their wagons hitched to other stars. In the early seventies it was still possible to uncover, here and there, a tenacious English department offering a vesti¬ gial graduate seminar given over to the study of Eliot. But by the close of the eighties, only “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” appears to have survived the indifference of the schools — two or three pages in the anthologies, a fleeting assignment for high school seniors and college freshmen. “Prufrock,” and “Prufrock” alone, is what the latest generations know — barely know: not “The Hollow Men,” not “La Figlia che Piange,” not “Ash Wednesday,” not even “The Waste Land.” Never “Four Quartets.” And the mammoth prophetic presence of T. S. Eliot himself— that immortal sovereign rock — the latest generations do not know at all. To anyone who was an undergraduate in the forties and fifties (and possibly even into the first years of the sixties), all that is inconceivable — as if a part of the horizon had crumbled away. When, four decades ago, in a literary period that resembled eternity, T. S. Eliot won the Nobel Prize for literature, he seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary fixed in the firma¬ ment like the sun and the moon — or like the New Criticism itself, the vanished movement Eliot once magisterially dominated. It was a time that, for the literary young, mixed authority with innovation: authority was innova¬ tion,\n\nan idea that reads now,\n\nin the wake of the\n\nanti-establishment sixties, like the simplest contradiction. But modernism then was an absolute ruler — it had no effec¬ tive intellectual competition and had routed all its predecessors; and it was modernism that famously carried the “new.” ii\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nThe new—as embodied in Eliot — was difficult, pre¬ occupied by parody and pastiche, exactingly allusive and complex, saturated in manifold ironies and inflections, composed of “layers,” and pointedly inaccessible to any¬ body expecting run-of-the-mill coherence. The doors to Eliot’s poetry were not easily opened. His lines and themes were not readily understood. But the young who flung themselves through those portals were lured by unfamiliar enchantments and bound by pleasurable ribbons of ennui. “April is the cruel-lest month,” Eliot’s voice, with its sepulchral cadences, came spiralling out of 78 r.p.m. phonographs, “breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land, mix¬ ing / Memory and desire ...” That toney British accent — flat,\n\nprecise,\n\nsteady,\n\nunemotive,\n\nsurprisingly\n\nhigh-\n\npitched, bleakly passive — coiled through awed English departments and worshipful dormitories, rooms where the walls had pin-up Picassos, and Pound and Eliot and Ulysses and Proust shouldered one another higgledy-piggledy in the rapt late-adolescent breast. The voice was, like the poet himself, nearly sacerdotal, impersonal, winding and wind¬ ing across the country’s campuses like a spool of blank robotic woe. “Shantih shantih shantih,” “not with a bang but a whimper,” “an old man in a dry month,” “I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled” —these were the devout chants of the literarily passionate in the forties and fifties, who in their own first verses piously copied Eliot’s tone: its restraint, gravity, mystery; its invasive remoteness and im¬ mobilized disjointed despair. There was rapture in that despair. Wordsworth’s nostal¬ gic cry over the start of the French Revolution —“Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, / But to be young was very heaven!” — belongs no doubt to every new generation; youth’s heaven lies in its quitting, or sometimes spiting, 12\n\nT. 5. Eliot at 101 the past, with or without a historical crisis. And though Eliot’s impress — the bliss he evoked—had little to do with political rupture, it was revolutionary enough in its own way. The young who gave homage to Eliot were engaged in a self-contradictory double maneuver: they were willingly authoritarian even as they jubilantly rebelled. On the one hand, taking on the puzzlements of modernism, they were out to tear down the Wordsworthian tradition itself, and on the other they were ready to fall on their knees to a god. A god, moreover, who despised free-thinking, democracy, and secularism: the very conditions of anti-authoritarianism. How T. S. Eliot became that god—or, to put it less extravagantly, how he became a commanding literary figure who had no successful rivals and whose formulations were in fact revered —is almost as mysterious a proposition as how, in the flash of half a lifetime, an immutable majesty was dismantled, an immutable glory dissipated. It is almost impossible nowadays to imagine such authority accruing to a poet. No writer today — Nobel winner or no — holds it or can hold it. The four present American Nobel laureates in literature —Czeslaw Milosz, Saul Bellow, Isaac Bashevis Singer, and Joseph Brodsky (three of whom, though citizens of long standing, do not write primarily in English) —are much honored, but they are not looked to for manifestos or pronouncements, and their comments are not studied as if by a haruspex. They are as far from being cultu¬ ral dictators as they are from filling football stadiums. Eliot did once fill a football stadium. On April 30, 1956, fourteen thousand people came to hear him lecture on The Frontiers of Criticism” at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis. By then he was solidly confirmed as “the Pope of Russell Square,” as his London admirer Mary Trevelyan 13\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nbegan to call him in 1949. It was a far-reaching papacy, effective even among students in the American Midwest; but if the young flocked to genuflect before the papal throne, it was not they who had enthroned Eliot, nor their teachers. In the Age of Criticism (as the donnish “little” magazines of the time dubbed the forties and fifties), Eliot was ceded power, and accorded veneration, by critics who were themselves minor luminaries. “He has a very penetrat¬ ing influence, perhaps not unlike an east wind,” wrote William Empson, one of whose titles, Seven Types of Ambi¬ guity, became an academic catchphrase alongside Eliot’s famous “objective correlative.” R. P. Blackmur said of “Prufrock” that its “obscurity is like that of the womb”; Eliot’s critical essays, he claimed, bear a “vital relation” to Aristotle’s Poetics. Hugh Kenner’s comparison is with still another monument: “Eliot’s work, as he once noted of Shakespeare, is in important respects one continuous poem,” and for Kenner the shape of Eliot’s own monument turns out to be “the Arch which stands when the last marcher has left, and endures when the last centurion or sergeant-major is dust.” F. R. Leavis, declaring Eliot “among the greatest poets of the English language,” re¬ marked that “to have gone seriously into the poetry is to have had a quickening insight into the nature of thought and language.” And in Eliot’s hands, F. O. Matthiessen ex¬ plained, the use of the symbol can “create the illusion that it is giving expression to the very mystery of life.” These evocations of wind, womb, thought and language, the dust of the ages, the very mystery of life, not to mention the ghosts of Aristotle and Shakespeare: not since Dr. John¬ son has a man of letters writing in English been received with so much adulation, or seemed so formidable—almost a marvel of nature itself—within his own society.\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101\n\nNevertheless there was an occasional dissenter. As early as 1929, Edmund Wilson was complaining that he couldn’t stomach Eliot’s celebrated conversion to “classicism, royal¬ ism, and Anglo-Catholicism. ” While granting that Eliot’s essays “will be read by everybody interested in literature,” that Eliot “has now become the most important literary critic in the English-speaking world,” and finally that “one can find no figure of comparable authority,” it was exactly the force of this influence that made Wilson “fear that we must give up hope.” For Wilson, the argument of Eliot’s followers “that, because our society at the present time is badly off without religion, we should make an heroic effort to swallow medieval theology, seems . . . utterly futile as well as fundamentally dishonest.” Twenty-five years later, when the American intellectual center had completed its shift from freelance literary work like Wilson’s—and Eliot’s_ to the near-uniformity of university English departments, almost no one in those departments would dare to think such unfastidious thoughts about Eliot out loud. A glaze of orthodoxy (not too different from the pre¬ occupation with deconstructive theory currently orthodox in English departments) settled over academe. Given the normal eagerness of succeeding literary generations to examine new sets of entrails, it was inevitable that so un¬ broken a dedication would in time falter and decline. But until that happened, decades on, Eliot studies were an unopposable ocean; an unstoppable torrent; a lava of libraries. It may be embarrassing for us now to look back at that nearly universal obeisance to an autocratic, inhibited, depressed, rather narrow-minded and considerably bigoted fake Englishman —especially if we are old enough (as I surely am) to have been part of the wave of adoration. In his person, if not in his poetry, Eliot was, after all, false coin¬ age. Born in St. Louis, he became indistinguishable 15\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\n(though not to shrewd native English eyes), in his dress, his manners, his loyalties, from a proper British Tory. Scion of undoctrinaire rationalist New England Unitarianism (his grandfather had moved from Boston to Missouri to found Washington University),\n\nhe was possessed\n\nby guilty\n\nnotions of sinfulness and martyrdom and by the monkish disciplines of asceticism, which he pursued in the unlikely embrace of the established English church. No doubt Eliot’s extreme self-alterations should not be dismissed as ordinary humbug, particularly not on the religious side; there is a difference between impersonation and conversion. Still, self-alteration so unalloyed suggests a hatred of the original design. And certainly Eliot condemned the opti¬ mism of democratic American meliorism; certainly he despised Unitarianism, centered less on personal salvation than on the social good; certainly he had contempt for Jews as marginal if not inimical to his notions of Christian com¬ munity. But most of all, he came to loathe himself, a hollow man in a twilight kingdom. In my undergraduate years, between seventeen and twenty-one, and long after as well, I had no inkling of any of this. The overt flaws —the handful of insults in the poetry—I swallowed down without protest. No one I knew protested —at any rate, no professor ever did. If Eliot included lines like “The rats are underneath the piles. / The jew {sic} is underneath the lot,” if he had his Bleistein, “Chicago Semite Viennese,” stare “from the protozoic slime” while elsewhere “The jew squats on the windowsill, the owner” and “Rachel nee Rabinovitch / Tears at the grapes with murderous paws”—well, that, sadly, was the way of the world and to be expected, even in the most resplendent poet of the age. The sting of those phrases —the shock that sickened —passed, and the reader’s heart pressed on to be stirred by other lines.\n\n16\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 What was Eliot to me? He was not the crack about “Money in furs,” or “Spawned in some estaminet in Antwerp.” No, Eliot was “The Lady is withdrawn / In a white gown, to contemplation, in a white gown” and “Then spoke the thunder / DA / Datta: what have we given?” and “After¬ noon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose”; he was incantation, mournfulness, elegance; he was liquescence, he was staccato, he was quickstep and oar, the hushed moan and the sudden clap. He was lyric shudder and roseburst. He was, in brief, poetry incarnate; and poetry was what one lived for. And he was something else beside. He was, to say it quickly, absolute art: high art, when art was at its most serious and elitist. The knowledge of that particular splen¬ dor-priestly, sacral, a golden cape for the initiate—has by now ebbed out of the world, and many do not regret it. Lit¬ erary high art turned its back on egalitarianism and prized what is nowadays scorned as “the canon : that body of anciently esteemed texts, most of them difficult and aris¬ tocratic in origin, which has been designated Western culture.\n\nModernism — and\n\nEliot — teased\n\nthe\n\ncanon,\n\nbruised it, and even sought to astonish it by mocking and fragmenting it, and also by introducing Eastern infusions, such as Eliot’s phrases from the Upanishads in\n\nThe Waste\n\nLand” and Pound’s Chinese imitations. But all these shatterings, dislocations, and idiosyncratic juxtapositions of the old literary legacies were never intended to abolish the honor in which they were held, and only confirmed their centrality. Undoing the canon is the work of a later time of our own, in fact, when universal assent to a central cultu¬ ral standard is almost everywhere decried. For the moderns, and\n\nfor\n\nagreed-on\n\nEliot\n\nespecially,\n\nthe\n\ndenial\n\nof permanently\n\nmasterworks — what Matthew Arnold,\n\n17\n\nin a\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\ncurrency now obsolete beyond imagining, called “touch¬ stones”— would have been unthinkable. What one learned from Eliot, whose poetry skittered toward disintegration, was the power of consolidation: the understanding that literature could genuinely reign. One learned also that a poem could actually be pene¬ trated to its marrow — which was not quite the same as comprehending its meaning. In shunting aside or giving up certain goals of ordinary reading, the New Criticism in¬ stalled Eliot as both teacher and subject. For instance, following Eliot, the New Criticism would not allow a poem to be read in the light of either biography or psychology. The poem was to be regarded as a thing-in-itself; nothing environmental or causal, including its own maker, was per¬ mitted to illuminate or explain it. In that sense it was as impersonal as a jar or any other shapely artifact that must be judged purely by its externals. This objective approach to a poem, deriving from Eliot’s celebrated “objective correla¬ tive” formulation, did not dismiss emotion; rather, it kept it at a distance, and precluded any speculation about the poet s own life, or any other likely influence on the poem. “The progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a con¬ tinual extinction of personality,” Eliot wrote in his landmark essay,\n\nTradition and the Individual Talent.”\n\nEmotion . . . has its life in the poem and not in the history of the poet.” And, most memorably: “The more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates. ” This was a theory designed to prevent old-fashioned attempts to read private events into the lines on the page. Artistic inevitability, Eliot instructed, “lies in this complete adequacy of the ex¬ ternal to the emotion” and suggested a series of externals that might supply the “exact equivalence” of any particular 18\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 emotion: “a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events.” Such correlatives — or “objective equivalences” — provided, he insisted, the “only way of expressing emotion in the form of art.” The New Criticism took him at his word, and declined to admit any other way. Not that the aesthetic scheme behind Eliot’s formulation was altogether new. Henry James, too, had demanded —“Dramatize, drama¬ tize!”—that the work of art resist construing itself in public. When Eliot, in offering his objective correlative, stopped to speak of the “donnees of the problem”— donnee was one of James’s pet Gallicisms —he was tipping off his source. No literary figure among James’s contemporaries had paid any attention to this modernist dictum, often not even James himself. Emerging in far more abstruse lan¬ guage from Eliot, it became a papal bull. He was thirty-five at the time. The method used in digging out the objective correlative had a Gallic name of its own: explication de texte. The slough¬ ing off of what the New Criticism considered to be extraneous had the effect of freeing the poem utterly— free¬ ing it for the otherwise undistracted mind of the reader, who was released from “psychology’\n\nand similar blind\n\nalleys in order to master the poem’s components. The New Criticism held the view that a poem could indeed be mastered: this was an act of trust, as it were, between poem and reader. The poem could be relied on to yield itself up to the reader — if the reader, on the other side of the bargain, would agree to a minutely close\n\nexplication,\n\nphrase: a process far more meticulous than\n\nphrase by\n\ninterpretation\n\nor the search for any identifiable meaning or definitive com¬ mentary. The search was rather for architecture and texture —or call it resonance and intricacy, the responsive webwork between the words. Explication de texte, as practiced by\n\nI9\n\nWHAT\n\nHENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nthe New Critics and their graduate-student disciples, was something like watching an ant maneuver a bit of leaf. One notes first the fine veins in the leaf, then the light speckled along the veins, then the tiny glimmers charging off the ant’s various surfaces, the movements of the ant’s legs and other body parts, the lifting and balancing of the leaf, all the while scrupulously aware that ant and leaf, though separate structures, become — when linked in this way — a freshly imagined structure. A generation or more was initiated into this concentrated scrutiny of a poem’s structure and movement. High art in literature —which had earlier been approached through the impressionistic “appreciations” that commonly passed for critical reading before the New Criticism took hold —was seen to be indivisible from explication de texte. And though the reverence for high art that characterized the Eliot era is now antiquated — or dead — the close reading that was the hallmark of the New Critics has survived, and remains the sine qua non of all schools of literary theory. Currently it is even being applied to popular culture; hamburger adver¬ tisements and television sitcoms can be serious objects of up-to-date critical examination. Eliot was hugely attracted to popular culture as an innovative ingredient of pastiche_ “Sweeney Agonistes,” an unfinished verse drama, is sat¬ urated in it. But for Eliot and the New Critics, popular culture or “low taste” contributed to a literary technique; it would scarcely have served as a literary subject, or “text,” in its own right. Elitism ruled. Art was expected to be stren¬ uous, hard-earned, knotty. Eliot explicitly said so, and the New Critics faithfully concurred. “It is not a permanent necessity that poets should be interested in philosophy,” Eliot wrote (though he himself had been a graduate student in philosophy at Harvard and Oxford, and had completed a 20\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101\n\nthesis on F. H. Bradley, the British idealist). “We can only say that it appears likely that poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be difficult. Our civilization compre¬ hends great variety and complexity, and this variety and complexity, playing upon a refined sensibility, must pro¬ duce various and complex results. The poet must become more and more comprehensive, more allusive, more in¬ direct, in order to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning.” He had another requirement as well, and that was a re¬ ceptiveness to history. Complexity could be present only when historical consciousness prevailed. He favored history over novelty, and tradition over invention. While praising William Blake for “a remarkable and original sense of lan¬ guage and the music of language, and a gift of hallucinated vision,” Eliot faulted him for his departures from the his¬ torical mainstream. “What his genius required, and what it sadly lacked, was a framework of accepted and traditional ideas which would have prevented him from indulging in a philosophy of his own.” And he concluded,\n\nThe con¬\n\ncentration resulting from a framework of mythology and theology and philosophy is one of the reasons why Dante is a classic, and Blake only a poet of genius.\n\nGenius was not\n\nenough for Eliot. A poet, he said in Tradition and the In¬ dividual Talent” needs to be\n\ndirected by the past.\n\nThe\n\nhistorical sense “compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in his bones, but with the feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a simulta¬ neous existence and composes a simultaneous order. A grand view; a view of grandeur; high art defined: so high that even the sublime Blake fails to meet its measure. It is all immensely elevated and noble — and, given the way 21\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nmany literary academics and critics think now, rare and alien. Aristocratic ideas of this kind, which some might call Eurocentric and obscurantist, no longer engage most liter¬ ary intellectuals; nor did they, sixty years ago, engage Edmund Wilson. But they were dominant for decades, and in the reign of Eliot they were law. Like other postulates, they brought good news and bad news; and we know that my good news may well be your bad news. Probably the only legacy of the Eliot era that everyone can affirm as enduringly valuable is the passionate, yet also disinterested, dissection of the text, a nuanced skill that no critical reader, taking whatever ideological stand, can do without. This ex¬ ception aside, the rest is all disagreement. As I see it, what appeared important to me at twenty-one is still important; in some respects I admit to being arrested in the Age of Eliot, a permanent member of it, unregenerate. The etiola¬ tion of high art seems to me to be a major loss. I continue to suppose that some texts are worthier than other texts. The same with the diminishment of history and tradition: not to incorporate into an educable mind the origins and unifying principles of one’s own civilization strikes me as a kind of cultural autolobotomy. Nor am I ready to relinquish Eliot’s stunning declaration that the reason we know so much more than the dead writers knew is that “they are that which we know.” As for that powerful central body of touchstone works, the discredited “canon,” and Eliot’s strong role in shaping it for his own and the following gen¬ eration, it remains clear to me—as Susan Sontag remarked at the 1986 International PEN Convention —that literary genius is not an equal opportunity employer; I would not wish to drop Homer or Jane Austen or Kafka to make room for an Aleutian Islander of lesser gifts, however unrepre¬ sented her group may be on the college reading list. 22\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 In today’s lexicon these are no doubt “conservative” notions, for which Eliot’s influence can be at least partly blamed or—depending on your viewpoint—credited. In Eliot himself they have a darker side—the bad news. And the bad news is very bad. The gravity of high art led Eliot to envision a controlling and exclusionary society that could, presumably, supply the conditions to produce that art. These doctrinal tendencies, expressed in 1939 in a little book called The Idea of A Christian Society, took Eliot —on the eve of Nazi Germany’s ascendancy over Europe — to the very lip of shutting out, through “radical changes,” anyone he might consider ineligible for his “Community of Chris¬ tians.” Lamenting “the intolerable position of those who try to lead a Christian life in a non-Christian world,” he was indifferent to the position of those who would try to thrive as a cultural minority within his contemplated Utopia. (This denigration of tolerance was hardly fresh. He had argued in a lecture six years before that he “had no objection to being called a bigot.”) In the same volume, replying to a certain Miss Bower, who had frowned on “one of the main tenets of the Nazi creed —the relegation of women to the sphere of the kitchen, the children, and the church,” Eliot protested “the implication that what is Nazi is wrong, and need not be discussed on its own merits.” Nine years after¬ ward, when the fight against Germany was won, he published Notes Toward the Definition of Culture, again pro¬ posing the hegemony of a common religious culture. Here he wrote — at a time when Hitler’s ovens were just cooled and the shock of the Final Solution just dawning\n\nthat\n\n“the scattering of Jews amongst peoples holding the Chris¬ tian faith may have been unfortunate both for these peoples and for the Jews themselves,” because “the effect may have been to strengthen the illusion that there can be culture 23\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nwithout religion.” An extraordinary postwar comment. And in an Appendix, “The Unity of European Culture,” a radio lecture broadcast to Germany in 1946, one year after the Reich was dismantled, with Europe in upheaval, the death-camps exposed, and displaced persons everywhere, he made no mention at all of the German atrocities. The only reference to “barbarism” was hypothetical, a worried projection into a potentially barren future: “If Christianity goes, the whole of our culture goes,” as if the best of Euro¬ pean\n\ncivilization\n\n(including\n\nthe\n\nmerciful\n\ntenets\n\nof\n\nChristianity) had not already been pulverized to ash throughout the previous decade. So much for where high art and traditional culture landed Eliot. There is bad news, as it happens, even in the objective correlative. What was once accepted as an austere principle of poetics is suddenly decipherable as no more than a device to shield the poet from the raw shame of confession. Eliot is now unveiled as a confessional poet above all — one who was driven to confess, who did confess, whose subject was sin and guilt (his own), but who had no heart for the act of dis¬ closure. That severe law of the impersonality of the poem — the masking technique purported to displace emotion from its crude source in the poet’s real-life experience to its heightened incarnation in “a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events” — turns out to be motivated by something less august and more timorous than pure literary theory or a devotion to symbol. In the name of the objective correla¬ tive, Eliot had found a way to describe the wound without the embarrassment of divulging who held the knife. This was a conception far less immaculate than the practitioners of the New Criticism ever supposed; for thirty years or more Eliot’s close readers remained innocent of—or discreet about — Eliot’s private life. Perhaps some of them imagined that, like the other pope, he had none. 24\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 The assault on the masking power of the objective corre¬ lative— the breach in Eliot’s protective wall — came about in the ordinary way: the biographies began. They began because time, which dissolves everything, at last dissolved awe. Although the number of critical examinations of Eliot, both book-length and in periodicals, is beyond counting, and although there are a handful of memoirs by people who were acquainted with him, the first true bio¬ graphy did not appear until a dozen years after his death. In 1977 Lyndall Gordon published Eliot’s Early Years, an accomplished and informative study taking Eliot past his failed first marriage and through the composition of “The Waste Land.” Infiltrated by the familiar worshipfulness, the book is a tentative hybrid, part dense critical scrutiny and part cautious narrative — self-conscious about the latter, as if permission has not quite been granted by the author to herself. The constraints of awe are still there. Nevertheless the poetry is advanced in the light of Eliot’s personal religious development, and these first illumina¬ tions are potent. In 1984 a second biography arrived, covering the life entire; by now awe has been fully dis¬ patched. Peter Ackroyd’s T. S. Eliot: A Life is thorough, bold, and relaxed about its boldness—even now and then a little acid. Not a debunking job by any means, but admir¬ ably straightforward. The effect is to bring Eliot down to recognizably human scale — disorienting to a reader trained to Eliot-adulation and ignorant until now of the nightmare of Eliot’s youthful marriage and its devastating evolution. Four years on, Eliot’s centenary saw the publication of Eliot’s New Life, Lyndall Gordon’s concluding volume, con¬ taining augmented portraits — in the nature of discoveries —of two women Ackroyd had touched on much less in¬ tensively; each had expected Eliot to marry her after the 25\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\ndeath of his wife in a mental institution. Eliot was callous to both. Eleven years following her first study, Gordon’s man¬ ner continues respectful and her matter comprehensive, but the diffidence of the narrative chapters is gone. Eliot has acquired fallibility, and Gordon is not afraid to startle her¬ self, or the long, encrusted history of deferential Eliot scholarship. Volume Two is daring, strong, and psycho¬ logically brilliant. Finally, 1988 also marked the issuance of a fat book of letters, The Letters of T. S. Eliot, Vol. 1:1898-\n\n1922, from childhood to age thirty-five (with more to come), edited by Eliot’s widow, Valerie Eliot, whom he married when she was thirty and he sixty-eight. “The man who suffers and the mind which creates” — these inseparables, sundered long ago by Eliot himself, can now be surgically united.\n\nIf Eliot hid his private terrors behind the hedge of his poetry, the course of literary history took no notice of it. Adoration, fame, and the Nobel Prize came to him neither in spite of nor because of what he left out; his craft was in the way he left it out. And he had always been reticent; he had always hidden himself. It can even be argued that he went to live in England in order to hide from his mother and father. His mother, Charlotte Stearns Eliot, was a frustrated poet who wrote religious verse and worked for the civic good.\n\nHis father, Henry Ware Eliot, was an affluent\n\nbusinessman who ran a St. Louis brick-manufacturing com¬ pany. Like any entrepreneur, he liked to see results. His father s father, an intellectual admired by Dickens, was good at results —though not the conventional kind. He had left the family seat in blueblood Boston to take the en¬ lightenment of Unitarianism to the American West; while 26\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 he was at it he established a university. Both of Eliot’s parents were strong-willed. Both expected him to make a success of himself. Both tended to diminish his indepen¬ dence. Not that they wanted his success on any terms but his own —it was early understood that this youngest of six siblings (four sisters, one of whom was nineteen years older, and a brother almost a decade his senior) was unusually gifted. He was the sort of introspective child who is photo¬ graphed playing the piano or reading a book or watching his girl cousins at croquet (while himself wearing a broadbrimmed straw hat and a frilly dress, unremarkable garb for upper-class nineteenth-century male tots).\n\nHis mother\n\nwrote to the headmaster of his prep school to ensure that he would not be allowed to participate in sports. She wrote again to warn against the dangers of swimming in quarry ponds. She praised Eliot’s schoolboy verse as better than her own, and guaranteed his unease. “I knew what her verses meant to her. We did not discuss the matter further,\n\nhe\n\nadmitted long afterward. At his Harvard commencement in 1910, the same year as the composition of Portrait of a Lady” and a year before “Prufrock,” he delivered the fare¬ well ode in a style that may have been a secret parody of his mother’s: “For the hour that is left us Fair Harvard, with thee, / Ere we face the importunate years ...” His mother was sympathetic to his ambitions as a poet\n\ntoo sym¬\n\npathetic: it was almost as if his ambitions were hers, or vice-versa. His father took a brisk view of Eliot’s graduate studies in philosophy: they were the ticket to a Harvard professorship, a recognizably respectable career. But Eliot would not stay put. To the bewilderment of his parents — the thought of it gave his mother a\n\nchill —he\n\nran off to Paris, partly to catch the atmosphere of Jules Laforgue, a French poet who had begun to influence him,\n\n27\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nand partly to sink into Europe. In Paris he was briefly attracted to Henri Bergson, whose lectures on philosophy he attended at the College de France, but then he came upon Charles Maurras; Maurras’ ideas — “classique, catholique,\n\nmonarchique\"— stuck to him for life,\n\nand were\n\ntransmuted in 1928 into his own “classicist, royalist, Anglo-Catholic.” In 1910 the word “fascist” was not yet in fashion, but that is exactly what Maurras was: later on he joined the pro-Nazi Vichy regime, and went to jail for it after World War II. None of this dented Eliot’s enduring admiration; Hommage a Charles Maurras was written as late as 1948. When Eliot first encountered him, Maurras was the founder of an anti-democratic organization called Action Frangaise, which specialized in student riots and open assaults on free-thinkers and Jews. Eliot, an onlooker on one of these occasions, did not shrink from the violence. (Ackroyd notes that he “liked boxing matches also.”) After Paris he obediently returned to Harvard for three diligent years, doing some undergraduate teaching and working on his doctoral degree. One of his courses was with Bertrand Russell, visiting from England. Russell saw Eliot at twenty-five as a silent young dandy, impeccably turned out, but a stick without\n\nvigour or life—or enthusiasm.”\n\n(Only a year later, in England, the diffident dandy —by then a new husband — would move with his bride right into Russell’s tiny flat.) During the remainder of the Harvard period, Eliot embarked on Sanskrit, read Hindu and Budd¬ hist sacred texts, and tunneled into the investigations that would culminate in his dissertation. Experience and the Objects of Knowledge in the Philosophy of F. H, Bradley. Screened by this busy academic program, he was also writ¬ ing\n\npoetry.\n\nWhen\n\nHarvard\n\noffered\n\nhim\n\na\n\ntraveling\n\nscholarship, he set off for Europe, and never again came 28\n\nT. S. Eliot at\n\n101\n\nback to live in the country of his birth. It was the beginning of the impersonations that were to become transformations. He had intended an extensive tour of the Continent, but, in August of 1914, when war broke out, he retreated to England and enrolled at Oxford, ostensibly to continue his studies in philosophy. Oxford seemed an obvious way station for a young man headed for a professorial career, and his parents, shuttling between St. Louis and their comfort¬ able New England summer house, ineradicably American in their habits and point of view, could not have judged otherwise, or suspected a permanent transatlantic removal. But what Eliot was really after was London: the literary life of London, in the manner of Henry James’s illustrious con¬ quest of it three decades before. He was quiet, deceptively passive, always reserved, on the watch for opportunity. He met Ezra Pound almost immediately. Pound, a fellow ex¬ patriate, was three years older and had come to London five years earlier. He had already published five volumes of poetry. He was idiosyncratic, noisy, cranky, aggressive, re¬ petitively and tediously humorous as well as perilously unpredictable, and he kept an eye out for ways to position himself at the center of whatever maelstrom was current or could be readily invented. By the time he and Eliot dis¬ covered each other, Pound had been through Imagism and was boosting Vorticism; he wanted to shepherd move¬ ments, organize souls, administer lives. He read a handful of Eliot’s Harvard poems, including “Portrait of a Lady” and “Prufrock,” and instantly anointed him as the real thing. To Harriet Monroe in Chicago, the editor of Poetry, then the most distinguished — and coveted — American journal of its kind, he trumpeted Eliot as the author of “the best poem I have yet had or seen from an American,\n\nand\n\ninsisted that she publish “Prufrock.” He swept around 29\n\nWHAT\n\nHENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nLondon introducing his new protege and finding outlets for his poems in periodicals with names like Others and BLAST (a Vorticist effort printed on flamingo-pink paper and fea¬ turing eccentric typography). Eliot felt encouraged enough by these successes to aban¬ don both Oxford and Harvard, and took a job teaching in a boy’s secondary school to support the poet he was now hear¬ tened\n\nto\n\nbecome.\n\nHis\n\nmother,\n\nappalled\n\nby\n\nsuch\n\nrecklessness, directed her shock not at Eliot but at his former teacher, Bertrand Russell (much as she had gone to the headmaster behind the teen-age Eliot’s back to protest the risks of the quarry pond): “I hope Tom will be able to carry out his purpose of coming on in May to take his degree. The Ph.D. is becoming in America . . . almost an essential condition for an Academic position and promotion therein. The male teachers in our secondary schools are as a rule inferior to the women teachers, and they have little social position or distinction. I hope Tom will not under¬ take such work another year—it is like putting Pegasus in harness.” Eliot’s father, storming behind the scenes, was less impressed by Pegasus. The appeal to Russell con¬ cluded,\n\nAs for The BLAST,’ Mr. Eliot remarked when he\n\nsaw a copy he did not know there were enough lunatics in the world to support such a magazine.” Home, in short, was seething. Within an inch of his degree, the compliant son was suddenly growing prodigal. A bombardment of cables and letters followed. Even the war conspired against the prodigal’s return; though Pound was already preparing to fill Eliot’s luggage with masses of Vorticist material for a projected show in New York, the danger of German U-boats made a journey by sea unsafe. Russell cabled Eliot’s father not to urge him to sit for his exams “UNLESS IMMEDIATE DEGREE IS WORTH\n\n30\n\nT. S. Eliot at\n\n101\n\nRISKING LIFE.” ‘‘I was not greatly pleased with the language of Prof. Russell’s telegram,” Eliot’s father com¬ plained in a letter to Harvard. “Mrs. Eliot and I will use every effort to induce my son to take his examinations later. Doubtless his decision was much influenced by Prof. Russell.” Clearly the maternal plea to Russell had back¬ fired. Meanwhile Harvard itself, in the person of James H. Woods, Eliot’s mentor in the philosophy department, was importuning him; Woods was tireless in offering an appointment. Eliot turned him down. Three years on, the family campaign to lure him home was unabated: the big¬ gest gun of all was brought out—Charles W.\n\nEliot,\n\neminent educational reformer, recently President of Har¬ vard, architect of the “five-foot shelf’ of indispensable classics, and Eliot’s grandfather s third cousin once re¬ moved. “I conceive that you have a real claim on my attention and interest,” he assured his wayward young rela¬ tive. It is, nevertheless, quite unintelligible to me how you or any other young American scholar can forego the privilege of living in the genuine American atmos¬ phere—a bright atmosphere of freedom and hope. I have never lived long in England—about six months in all —but I have never got used to the manners and customs of any class in English society, high, middle, or low. After a stay of two weeks or two months in England it has been delightful for me to escape . . .\n\nThen, too, I have never been able to understand how any American man of letters can forego the privilege of being of use primarily to Americans of the present and future generations, as Emerson, Bryant, Lowell, and\n\n31\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nWhittier were. Literature seems to me highly climatic and national . . .You mention in your letter the name of Henry James. I knew his father well, and his brother William very well; and I had some conversation with Henry at different times during his life. I have a vivid remembrance of a talk with him during his last visit to America. It seemed to me all along that his English residence for so many years contributed neither to the happy development of his art nor to his personal happi¬ ness. . . . My last word is that if you wish to speak through your work to people of the “finest New England spirit” you had better not live much longer in the English atmosphere. The New England spirit has been nur¬ tured in the American atmosphere. What Eliot thought—three years before the publication of “The Waste Land” — of this tribal lecture, and particu¬ larly of its recommendation that he aspire to the mantle of the author of “Thanatopsis,” one may cheerfully imagine. In any case it was too late, and had long been too late. The campaign was lost before the first parental shot. Eliot’s tie to England was past revocation. While still at Oxford he was introduced to Vivien Haigh-Wood, a high-spirited, high-strung, artistic young woman, the daughter of a culti¬ vated upper-class family; her father painted landscapes and portraits. Eliot, shy and apparently not yet relieved of his virginity, was attracted to her rather theatrical personality. Bertrand Russell sensed in her something brasher, perhaps rasher, than mere vivaciousness —he judged her light, vul¬ gar, and adventurous. Eliot married her only weeks after they met. The marriage, he knew, was the seal on his deter¬ mination to stay in England, the seal his parents could not 32\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 break and against which they would be helpless. After the honeymoon,\n\nRussell\n\n(through pure chance Eliot\n\nhad\n\nbumped into him on a London street) took the new couple in for six months, from July to Christmas —he had a closetsize spare room — and helped them out financially in other ways. He also launched Eliot as a reviewer by putting him in touch with the literary editor of the New Statesman, for whom Eliot now began to write intensively. Probably Russell’s most useful service was his arranging for Eliot to be welcomed into the intellectual and literary circle around Lady Ottoline Morrell at Garsington, her country estate. Though invitations went to leading artists and writers, Garsington was not simply a salon: the Morrells were prin¬ cipled pacifists who provided farm work during the war for conscientious objectors. Here Eliot found Aldous Huxley, D. H. Lawrence, Lytton Strachey, Katherine Mansfield, the painter Mark Gertler, Clive Bell, and, eventually, Leonard and Virginia Woolf. Lady Ottoline complained at first that Eliot had no spontaneity, that he barely moved his lips when he spoke, and that his voice was “mandarin.” But Russell had carried him —in his arms, as it were —into the inmost eye of the most sophisticated whorl of contemporary English letters. The American newcomer who had left Har¬ vard on a student fellowship in 1914 was already, by the middle of 1915, at the core of the London literary milieu he had dreamed of. And with so many models around him, he was working on disposing of whatever remnants of St. Louis remained lodged in his mouth, and perfecting the manner and accent of a high-born Englishman. (If he was grateful to Russell for this happy early initiation into precisely the society he coveted, by\n\n1931 — in\n\nThoughts After Lam¬\n\nbeth,” an essay on the idea ofa national English church was sneering, in italics, at Russell s\n\n33\n\nhe\n\ngospel of happiness. )\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nMeanwhile his parents required placating. A bright young man in his twenties had gone abroad to augment his studies; it was natural for him to come home within a reasonable time to get started on real life and his profession. Instead, he had made a precipitate marriage, intended to spend the rest of his days in a foreign country, and was teaching French and arithmetic in the equivalent of an American junior high school. Not surprisingly, the brick manufacturer and his piously versifying wife could not infer the sublime vocation of a poet from these evidences. Eliot hoped to persuade them. The marriage to Vivien took place on June 26, 1915; on June 28 Ezra Pound wrote a very long letter to Eliot’s father. It was one of Eliot’s mother’s own devices —that of the surrogate pleader. As his mother had asked Russell to intervene with Eliot to return him to Har¬ vard, so now Eliot was enlisting Pound to argue for London. The letter included much information about Pound s own situation, which could not have been re¬ assuring, since—as Pound himself remarked — it was unlikely that the elder Eliot had ever heard of him. But he sweetened the case with respectable references to Edgar Lee Masters and Robert Browning, and was careful to add that Robert Frost, another American in London, had “done a book of New England eclogues.\n\nTo the heartbroken father\n\nwho had looked forward to a distinguished university career for his son, Pound said, “I am now much better off than if I had kept my professorship in Indiana” — empty comfort, considering it was Fair Harvard that was being mourned; what Pound had relinquished was Wabash College in a place called Crawfordsville. What could it have meant to Eliot s father that this twenty-nine-year-old contributor to the lunatic BLAST boasted of having “engineered a new school of verse now known in England, France and 34\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 America,” and insisted that “when I make a criticism of your son’s work it is not an amateur criticism”? “As to his coming to London,” Pound contended, anything else is a waste of time and energy. No one in London cares a hang what is written in America. After getting an American audience a man has to begin all over again here if he plans for an international hearing . . . The situation has been very well summed up in the sentence: “Henry James stayed in Paris and read Tur¬ genev and Flaubert, Mr. Howells returned to America and read Henry James. ” . . . At any rate ifT.S.E. is set on a literary career, this is the place to begin it and any other start would be very bad economy. “I might add,” he concluded, “that a literary man’s income depends very much on how rigidly he insists on doing exactly what he himself wants to do. It depends on his con¬ nection, which he makes himself. It depends on the number of feuds that he takes on for the sake of his aesthetic beliefs. T.S.E. does not seem to be so pugnacious as I am and his course should be smoother and swifter. The prediction held. The two-year eruption that was Vorticism waned, and so did Pound s local star, he moved on to Paris — leaving London, as it would turn out, in Eliot’s possession. Pound’s letter to the elder Eliot was not all bluster: he may have been a deft self-promoter, but he was also a promoter of literary ideas, and in Eliot’s work he saw those ideas made flesh. The exuberance that sent Pound bustling through London to place Eliot here and there was the enthusiasm of an inventor whose thingamajig is just beginning to work in the world at large, in the break¬ through spirit of Alexander Graham Bell’s “Mr. Watson, 35\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\ncome here.” In Pound’s mind Eliot was Pound’s invention. Certainly the excisions he demanded in “The Waste Land” radically “modernized” it in the direction of the objective correlative by keeping in the symbols and chopping out context and narrative, maneuvering the poem toward greater obliqueness and opacity. He also maneuvered Eliot. A determined literary man must go after his own “con¬ nection,” he had advised Eliot’s father, but the boisterous Pound served the reticent Eliot in a network of useful con¬ nections that Eliot would not have been likely to make on his own —including John Quinn, a New York literary philanthropist who became his (unpaid) agent in America and shored him up from time to time with generous money contributions. Eliot was dependent on Pound’s approval, or for a long while behaved as if he was. It was Pound who dominated the friendship, periodically shooting out instructions, in¬ formation, scalawag counsel and pontification. “I value his verse far higher than that of any other living poet,” Eliot told John Quinn in 1918. Gradually, over a span of years, there was a reversal of authority and power. Eliot rose and Pound sank. Under the pressure of his marriage (Vivien never held a job of any kind, nor could she have, even if it had been expected of her), Eliot ascended in the pragmatic world as well. He gave up teaching secondary school —it re¬ quired him to supervise sports —and tried evening adult extension-course\n\nlecturing.\n\nThe preparation\n\nwas\n\nall-\n\nconsuming and the remuneration paltry. Finally he recog¬ nized—he was, after all, his father’s son —that this was no way to earn a living. A friend of Vivien’s family recom¬ mended him to Lloyds Bank, where he turned out to be very good at the work —he had a position in the foreign depart¬ ment—and was regularly praised and advanced. Eventually 36\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 he joined Faber & Gwyer, the London publishing house (later Faber & Faber) and remained associated with it until the end of his life. And then it was Pound who came to Eliot with his manuscripts. Eliot published them, but his re¬ sponses, which had once treated Pound’s antics with answering foolery, became heavily businesslike and im¬ patient. As founder and editor of a literary journal Vivien had named The Criterion, Eliot went on commissioning pieces from Pound, though he frequently attempted to im¬ pose coherence and discipline; occasionally he would reject something outright. In 1922 Pound had asserted that “Eliot’s Waste Land is I think the justification of the ‘move¬ ment,’ of our modern experiment, since 1900,” but by 1930 he was taunting Eliot for having “arrived at the supreme Eminence among English critics largely through disguising himself as a corpse.” Admiration had cooled on both sides. Still, Eliot’s loyalty remained fundamentally steadfast, even when he understood that Pound may have been approaching lunacy. After the Second World War, when Pound was a patient in St. Elizabeth’s Federal Hospi¬ tal for the Insane in Washington, D.C. — the United States government’s alternative to jailing him for treason\n\nEliot\n\nsigned petitions for his release and made sure to see him on visits to America. Eliot never publicly commented on the reason for Pound’s incarceration: Pound had supported the Axis and had actively aided the enemy. On Italian radio, in Mussolini’s employ, he had broadcast twice-weekly attacks on Roosevelt, Churchill, and the Jews (whom he vilified in the style of Goebbels). Though in the long run the friendship altered and atten¬ uated— especially as Eliot grew more implicated in his Christian commitment and Pound in his self-proclaimed paganism —Eliot learned much from Pound. 37\n\nHe had\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nalready learned from Laforgue the technique of the iron¬ ically illuminated persona. The tone of youthful ennui, and the ageless though precocious recoil from the world of phenomena, were Eliot’s own. To these qualities of nega¬ tion Pound added others: indirection, fragmentation, suggestibility, the force of piebald and zigzag juxtaposition — what we have long recognized as the signs of modernism, that famous alchemy of less becoming more. But even as he was tearing down the conventional frame of art. Pound was instructing Eliot in how to frame a career: not that Eliot really needed Pound in either sphere. Poets and critics may fabricate “movements,” but no one can invent the Zeit¬ geist, and it was the Zeitgeist that was promulgating modernism. Eliot may well have been headed there with or without Pound at the helm. That Pound considered Eliot a creature of his own manufacture — that he did in fact tinker with the design — hardly signifies, given that Eliot’s art was anyhow likely to fall into the rumbling imperatives of its own time. As for Eliot’s advancement into greater and greater reputation, even pushy Pound could not push a miracle into being. Still, it was evident early on that Pound s dictates were in full operation. “Now I am going to ask you to do something for me,” Eliot informs his brother Henry in 1915, in case you are in Boston or New York this summer. These are suggestions of Ezra Pound’s, who has a very shrewd head, and has taken a very great interest in my prospects. There will be people to be seen in Boston and New York, editors with whom I might have some chance ... As you are likeliest to be in Boston, the first thing is the Atlantic Monthly. Now Pound con¬ siders it important, whenever possible, to secure 38\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 introductions to editors from people of better social position than themselves,\n\nand he goes on to propose that Isabella Stewart Gardner, an influential blueblood connection of his, be dragooned into sending a note to the editor of the Atlantic on Eliot’s behalf. A few days later he is writing to Mrs. Gardner herself, announcing the imminent arrival of his brother, “in order that he may get your advice.” To Henry he admits he has only a handful of poems to show, including “some rather second rate things,” but anyhow he asks him to try for an opening at Harper’s, Century, Bookman, and the New Repub¬ lic. “Nothing needs to be done in Chicago, I believe.” Thus, Pound’s training in chutzpah. Yet much of it was native to Eliot, picked up at the parental knee. Not for nothing was he the offspring of a mother who was a model of the epistolary maneuver, or of a father who demanded in¬ stant success. He had been reared, in any event, as one of the lords of creation in a conscious American aristocracy that believed in its superior birthright —a Midwestern en¬ clave of what Cousin Charles Eliot had called\n\nthe finest\n\nNew England spirit.” In the alien precincts of London, where his credentials were unknown or immaterial, the top could not be so easily guaranteed; it would have to be cajoled, manipulated, seduced, dared, commanded, now and then dodged; it would have to be pressed hard, and cunningly. All this Eliot saw for himself, and rapidly. Re¬ serve shored up cunning. It scarcely required Pound to teach him how to calculate the main chance, or how to scheme to impose his importance. He was actually better at it than Pound, because infinitely silkier. Whereas Pound had one voice to assault the barricades with — a cantanker¬ ous blast in nutty frontiersman spelling ( You jess set and\n\n39\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nhev a quiet draw at youh cawn-kob”) that was likely to annoy, and was intended to shake you up — Eliot had dozens of voices. His early letters — where he is sedulously on the make—are a ventriloquist’s handbook. To Mrs. Gardner he purrs as one should to a prominent patroness of the arts, with friendly dignity, in a courteously apprecia¬ tive tone, avoiding the appearance of pursuit. Addressing the irascibly playful Pound, he is irascibly playful, and falls into identical orthographical jokiness. To his benefactor John Quinn he is punctiliously — though never humbly — grateful, recording the state of his literary barometer with a precision owed to the chairman of the board; nor does he ever fail to ask after Quinn’s health. To his father he writes about money, to his mother about underwear and over¬ coats. Before both of them, anxiety and dutifulness prevail; he is eager to justify himself and to tot up his triumphs. He means to show them how right he was in choosing a London life; he is not a disappointment after all. “I am staying in the bank, he reports (he had been offered an editorship on a literary journal) — this alone will please his father, but there is much more: As it is, I occupy rather a privileged position. I am out of the intrigues and personal hatreds of journalism, and everyone respects me for working in a bank. My social position is quite as good as it would be as editor of a paper. I only write what I want to—now —and everyone knows that anything I do write is good. I can influence London opinion and English literature in a better way. I am known to be disinterested. Even through the Egoist I am getting to be looked up to by people who are far better known to the general public than I. There is a small and select public which regards 40\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 me as the best living critic, as well as the best living poet, in England. I shall of course write for the Ath.\n\n\\The Athenaeum] and keep my finger in it. I am much in sympathy with the editor, who is one of my most cor¬ dial admirers. With that and the Egoist and a young quarterly review which I am interested in, and which is glad to take anything I will give, I can have more than enough power to satisfy me. I really think that I have far more influence on English letters than any other American has ever had, unless it be Henry James. I know a great many people, but there are many more who would like to know me, and I can remain isolated and detached. All this sounds very conceited, but I am sure it is true, and as there is no outsider from whom you would hear it, and America really knows very little of what goes on in London, I must say it myself. Because it will give you pleasure if you believe it, and it will help to explain my point of view. This was surely the voice of a small boy making his case to his skeptical parents: it will give you pleasure if you believe it. He was thirty years old. The self-assurance—or call it, as others did, the arrogance —was genuine, and before his father and mother he was unashamed of speaking of the necessity of power. Such an aspiration was axiomatic among Eliots. What he had set himself to attain was the absolute pinnacle —a place inhabited by no one else, where he could “remain isolated and detached.” Fate would give him his wish exactly and with a vengeance, though not quite yet. If he was puffing London to St. Louis, and representing him¬ self there as “the best living critic, as well as the best living poet, in England,” two months later he was telling Lytton\n\n4i\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nStrachey that he regarded “London with disdain,” and divided “mankind into supermen, termites, and wireworms. I am sojourning among the termites.” In all this there is a wonder and an enigma: the prodigy of Eliot’s rocketlike climb from termite to superman. London (and New York and Boston) was swarming with young men on a course no different from Eliot’s. He was not the only one with a hotly ambitious pen and an appetite for cultivat¬ ing highly-placed people who might be useful to him. John Middleton Murry and Wyndham Lewis, for example, both of whom were in Eliot’s immediate circle, were equally striving and polished, and though we still know their names, we know them more in the nature of footnotes than as the main text. All three were engaged in the same sort of essayistic empire-building in the little magazines, and at the same time. Lewis published Eliot in BLAST, Murry published him in the Athenaeum, and later Eliot, when he was editing the Criterion, published Lewis. Yet Eliot very quickly overshadowed the others. The disparity, it can be argued, was that Eliot was primarily a poet; or that Eliot’s talent was more robust. But even if we believe, as most of us do, that genius of its own force will sooner or later leap commandingly out (Melville’s and Dickinson’s redemption from obscurity being our sacred paradigms), the riddle stands: why, for Eliot, so soon? His termite days were a brevity, a breath; he was superman in an instant. What was it that singled Eliot out to put him in the lead so astoundingly early? That he ferociously willed it means nothing. Nearly all beginning writers have a will for extreme fame; will, no matter how resilient, is usually no more efficacious in the marketplace than daydream. If there is any answer to such questions —and there may not be-it may lie hidden in one of Eliot’s most well42\n\nT. 5. Eliot at 101 appointed impersonations:\n\nthe voice he employed as\n\nessayist. That charm of intimacy and the easy giving of secrets that we like to associate with essayists — Montaigne, Lamb, Hazlitt, George Orwell, Virginia Woolf when the mood struck her—was not Eliot’s. As in what is called the “familiar” essay, Eliot frequently said “I” — but it was an “I” set in ice cut from the celestial vault: uninsistent yet in¬ contestable, serenely sovereign. It seemed to take its power from erudition, and in part it did; but really it took it from some proud inner figuration or incarnation —as if Literature itself had been summoned to speak in its own voice: I am not considering whether the language of Dante or Shakespeare is superior, for I cannot admit the question: I readily affirm that the differences are such as make Dante easier for a foreigner. Dante’s advan¬ tages are not due to greater genius, but to the fact that he wrote when Europe was still more or less one. And even had Chaucer or Villon been exact contemporaries of Dante, they would still have been farther, linguisti¬ cally as well as geographically, from the center of Europe than Dante. Who could talk back to that? Such sentences appear to derive from a source of knowledge —a congeries of assump¬ tions— indistinguishable from majesty. In short, Eliot would not permit himself to be ignored, because it was not “himself” he was representing, but the very flower of Euro¬ pean civilization.\n\nAnd there may have been another\n\nelement contributing to the ready acceptance of his authority: as a foreigner, he was drawn to synthesizing and summarizing in a way that insiders, who take their context for granted, never do. He saw principles where the natives 43\n\nWHAT\n\nHENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nsaw only phenomena. Besides, he had a clear model for focused ascent: Henry James. Knowing what he meant to become, he was immune to distraction or wrong turnings. “It is the final perfection,\n\nthe consummation of an\n\nAmerican,” Eliot (in one of his most autobiographical dicta) wrote of James, “to become, not an Englishman, but a European — something which no born European, no per¬ son of any European nationality, can become.” So much for the larger trajectory. He had mapped out an unimpeded ideal destination. In the lesser geography of private life, however, there was an unforeseen impediment. Henry James had never married; Eliot had married Vivien. In\n\n1915\n\nshe was twenty-seven, slender, lively, very pretty,\n\nwith a wave in her hair and a pleasant mouth and chin. By I9I9> Virginia Woolf was describing her as “a washed out, elderly and worn looking little woman.” She complained of illness from the very first, but otherwise there were few im¬ mediate hints of the devastation to come. She was absorbed in Eliot’s career. He brought his newest work to her for criticism; she read proofs; she assisted in preparing the Cri¬ terion. She also did some writing of her own —short stories,\n\nand prose sketches that Eliot admired and published in the Criterion. She had energy enough at the start: there were ex¬\n\ncursions, dinners, visits to Garsington, dance halls, dance lessons, theater, opera; even a flirtation with Bertrand Russell that turned into a one-night stand. (“Hellish and loathsome,” Russell called it.) A month after the wedding she told Russell that she had married Eliot because she thought she could “stimulate” him, but that it could not be done. She began to suffer from headaches, colitis, neural¬ gia, insomnia. “She is a person who lives on a knife edge,” Russell said. Eliot himself often woke at night feeling sick. He was plagued by colds, flu, bronchial problems; he 44\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101\n\nsmoked too much and he consistently drank too much, though he held it well. Retreating from Vivien, he threw himself into the work at the bank and into developing his literary reputation. Vivien had nowhere to go but into re¬ sentment, ill-will, hysteria. In the mornings the bed linens were frequently bloody — she menstruated excessively, and became obsessed with washing the sheets. She washed them herself even when they stayed in hotels. Morphine was pre¬ scribed for her various symptoms; also bromides and ether (she swabbed her whole body with ether, so that she reeked of it), and mercilessly bizarre diets—a German doctor com¬ bined starvation with the injection of animal glands. She collapsed into one nervous illness after another. Eliot re¬ peatedly sent her to the country to recuperate while he remained in town. WTen his mother, now an elderly widow, and one of his sisters came on a visit from America, Vivien was absent, and Eliot was obliged to manage the complications of hospitality on his own. Anxiety over Vivien crept into all his business and social correspondence, “my wife has been very ill”; “she is all right when she is lying down, but immediately she gets up is very faint , “wretched today—another bad night”; “Have you ever been in such incessant and extreme pain that you felt your sanity going, and that you no longer knew reality from delusion? That’s the way she is. The doctors have never seen so bad a case, and hold out no definite hope, and have so far done her no good.\n\nMeanwhile she is in screaming\n\nagony ...” She brought out in him all his responsibility, vigilance, conscientiousness, troubled concern; in brief, his virtue. Her condition bewildered him; nothing in his experience, and certainly nothing in his upbringing, had equipped him for it; her manifold sicknesses were unpredictable, and so 45\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nwas she. Her sanity was in fact going. Daily she made him consider and reconsider his conduct toward her, and her ironic, clever, assaultive, always embarrassing responses ran tumbling over his caution. He dreaded dinner parties in her company, and went alone or not at all. It became known that Eliot was ashamed of his wife. But he was also ashamed of his life. Little by little he attempted to live it without Vivien, or despite Vivien, or in the few loopholes left him by Vivien. She was in and out of sanitoria in England, France, and Switzerland; it was a relief to have her away. What had once been frightened solicitude was gradually transmuted into horror, and horror into self-preservation, and self-preservation into callousness, and callousness into a kind of moral brutality. She felt how, emotionally and spiritually, he was abandoning her to her ordeal. However imploringly she sought his attention, he was determined to shut her out; the more he shut her out, the more wildly, dramatically, and desperately she tried to recapture him. He was now a man hunted —and haunted —by a mad wife. He saw himself transmogrified into one of the hollow men of his own imagining, that scarecrow figure stuck together out of “rat’s coat, crowskin, crossed staves”: The eyes are not here There are no eyes here In this valley of dying stars In this hollow valley This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms He carried this Golgothan self-portrait with him every¬ where; his lost kingdoms were in the stony looks he gave to the world. Virginia Woolf was struck by “the grim marble face . . . mouth twisted and shut; not a single line free and 46\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101\n\neasy; all caught, pressed, inhibited.” “Humiliation is the worst thing in life,” he told her. Vivien had humiliated him. Torment and victimization — she of him, and heofher — had degraded him. Bouts of drink depleted him. At times his behavior was as strange as hers: he took to wearing pale green face powder, as if impersonating the sickly cast of death. Virginia Woolf thought he painted his lips. In 1933, after eighteen years of accelerating domestic misery, he finally broke loose: he went to America for a series of angry lectures (published later as After Strange Gods: A Primer of Modem Heresy) in which he attacked Pound, D. H. Lawrence, liberalism, and “free-thinking Jews,” complain¬ ing that the United States had been “invaded by foreign races” who had “adulterated” its population. In London, meanwhile, a remorseful Vivien was refurbishing the flat for his homecoming; she even offered to join him overseas. In the black mood of his lectures her letter shocked him into a quick cruel plan. Writing from America, he directed his London solicitors to prepare separation documents and to deliver them to Vivien in his absence. When he arrived back in England, the deed was done. Vivien in disbelief continued to wait for him in the reupholstered flat. He moved instead into the shabby guest rooms of the parish house of St. Stephen’s, an Anglican congregation with a high-church bent. There, subdued and alone among celi¬ bate priests, he spent the next half-dozen years in penance, suffering the very isolation and detachment he had once prized as the influential poet’s reward. Yet Vivien was in pursuit. Though he kept his lodgings secret from\n\nher,\n\nwith\n\nfearful\n\nsingle-mindedness she\n\nattempted to hunt him down, turning up wherever there might be a chance of confronting him, hoping to cajole or argue or threaten him into resuming with her. He con¬ trived to escape her time after time. By now he had left the 47\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nbank for Faber; she would burst into the editorial offices without warning, weeping and pleading to be allowed to talk to him. One of the staff would give some excuse and Eliot would find a way of sneaking out of the building with¬ out detection. She carried a knife in her purse — it was her customary flamboyance — to alarm him; but it was a theater knife, made of rubber. She sent Christmas cards in the name of “Mr. and Mrs. T. S. Eliot,” as if they were still to¬ gether, and she advertised in The Times for him to return. She called herself sometimes Tiresias, and sometimes Daisy Miller, after the doomed Jamesian heroine. In a caricature of what she imagined would please him, she joined the newly formed British Union of Fascists. One day she actually caught him; she went up to him after a lecture, handed him books to sign as if they were strangers, and begged him to go home with her. He hid his recoil behind a polite How do you do? When she got wind of a scheme to commit her to a mental hospital, she fled briefly to Paris. In j938 she was permanently institutionalized, whether by her mother or her brother, or by Eliot himself, no one knows; but Eliot had to have been consulted, at the very least. When her brother visited her in\n\n1946,\n\na year before\n\nher death, he reported that she seemed as sane as he was. She had tried on one occasion to run away; she was captured and brought back. She died in the asylum a decade after her commitment. Eliot never once went to see her. Out of this brutalizing history of grieving and loss, of misalliance, misfortune, frantic confusion, and recurrent panic, Eliot drew the formulation of his dream of horror— that waste land where ... I Tiresias have foresuffered all . . . and walked among the lowest of the dead 48\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 Here is no water but only rock . . . If there were only water amongst the rock Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit . . . blood shaking my heart The awful daring of a moment’s surrender Which an age of prudence can never retract By this, and this only, we have existed Which is not to be found in our obituaries Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor In our empty rooms He might have regarded his marriage and its trials as a regrettable accident of fallible youth — the awful daring of a moment’s surrender — compounded by his initial sense of duty and loyalty. But he was shattered beyond such real¬ ism, and finally even beyond stoicism. He felt he had gazed too long on the Furies. The fiery brand he had plucked out of his private inferno seemed not to have been ignited in the ordinary world; it blackened him metaphysically, and had little to do with fractured expectations or the social difficul¬ ties of mental illness. What he knew himself to be was a sinner. The wretchedness he had endured was sin. Vivien had been abused — by doctors and their scattershot treat¬ ments, and by regimens Eliot could not have prevented. The truth was she had been drugged for years. And he had abused her himself, perhaps more horribly, by the with¬ drawal of simple human sympathy. It was she who had smothered his emotional faculties, but reciprocal humilia¬ tion had not earned reciprocal destinies. Vivien was confined. He was freed to increase his fame. Nevertheless 49\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nas if to compensate her — he lived like a man imprisoned; like a penitent; like a flagellant. He was consumed by ideas of sin and salvation, by self-loathing. The scourge that was Vivien had driven him to conversion: he entered Christian¬ ity seriously and desperately, like a soul literally in danger of damnation, or as though he believed he was already halfdamned. The religiosity he undertook was a kind of brood¬ ing medieval monkishness: ascetic,\n\nturned altogether\n\ninward, to the sinful self. Its work was the work of personal redemption. In “Ash Wednesday” he exposed the startingpoint, the beginning of abnegation and confession: Because these wings are no longer wings to fly But merely vans to beat the air The air which is now thoroughly small and dry Smaller and dryer than the will Teach us to care and not to care Teach us to sit still. And in a way he did learn to sit still. He was celibate. He was diligent and attentive in his office life while conducting an orderly if lonely domestic routine. He was at Mass every morning, and frequently went on retreat. During the night blitz of London in 1939, he served for a time as an air raid warden, often staying up till dawn. Then, to escape the ex¬ hausting bombings, like so many others he turned to commuting from the far suburbs, where he became the pay¬ ing guest of a family of gentlewomen. In 1945, at the war’s end, he made another unusual household arrangement, one that also had its spiritual side: he moved in with John Hay¬ ward, a gregarious wit and bookish extrovert whom disease had locked in a wheelchair. Eliot performed the necessary small personal tasks for his companion, wheeled him to the\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 park on pleasant afternoons, and stood vigilantly behind his chair at the parties Hayward liked to preside over — Eliot reserved and silent under the burden of his secret wounds and his eminence, Hayward boisterous, funny, and monarchically at ease. In the evenings, behind the shut door of the darkest room at the back of the flat, Eliot recited the rosary, ate his supper from a tray, and limited himself to a single game of patience. This odd couple lived together for eleven years, until Eliot suddenly married his young secretary, Valerie Fletcher. She offered him the intelligent adoration of an infatuated reader who had been enchanted by his poetry and his fame since her teens; she had come to Faber & Faber with no other motive than to be near him. Vivien had died in 1947; the marriage to Valerie took place in 1957. After the long discipline of penance, he opened himself to capacious love for the first time. As he had known himself for a sinner, so now he knew himself for a happy man. But the old reflex of recoil — and abandonment — appeared to have survived after all. From youth he had com¬ bined ingrained loyalty with the contrary habit of casting off the people who seemed likely to impede his freedom. He had fled over an ocean to separate himself from his demand¬ ing parents — though it was his lot ultimately to mimic them. He was absorbed by religion like his mother, and ended by writing, as she did, devotional poetry. Like his father, he was now a well-established businessman, indis¬ pensable to his firm and its most influential officer. (It developed that he copied his father even in trivia. The elder Eliot was given to playful doodlings of cats. The son whose knack for cartooning exceeded the fathers\n\nwrote\n\nclever cat verses. These, in the form of the long-running Broadway musical, are nearly the whole sum of Eliot s cur¬ rent American renown: if today’s undergraduates take\n\nWHAT HENRY JAMES\n\nKNEW\n\nspontaneous note of Eliot at all, it will be “Cats” on their tape cassettes, not “The Waste Land.”) Still, despite these evolving reversions, it was the lasting force of his re¬ pudiations that stung: his scorn for the family heritage of New England Unitarianism, his acquisition in 1927 of British citizenship. He had thrown off both the liberal faith of his fathers — he termed it a heresy — and their native pride of patriotism. He had shown early that he could sever what no longer suited. The selfless interval with John Hay¬ ward was cut off overnight: there is a story that Eliot called a taxi, told Hayward he was going off to be married, and walked out. After so prolonged a friendship—and a depen¬ dence—Hayward\n\nfelt\n\ncruelly\n\nabandoned.\n\nHe\n\nnever\n\nrecovered his spirit. Eliot was repeatedly capable of such calculated abruptness. His abandonment of Vivien —the acknowledged sin of his soul, the flaming pit of his exile and suffering —was echoed in less theological tones in his careless dismissal of Emily Hale and Mary Trevelyan, the wounded women whose loving attachment he had wel¬ comed for years. When Vivien died, each one —Emily Hale in America and Mary Trevelyan close at hand in London — believed that Eliot would now marry her. Miss Hale —as she was to her students —was a con¬ nection of the New England cousins; Eliot had known her since her girlhood. Their correspondence, with its webwork of common associations and sensibilities, flourished decade after decade —she was a gifted teacher of drama at various women’s colleges and private schools for girls, with a modest but vivid acting talent of her own. Eliot’s trips to America always included long renewing visits with her, and she in turn traveled to England over a series of summer vacations to be with him. One of their excursions was to the lavish silent gardens of Burnt Norton, the unoccupied 52\n\nT. S. Eliot at 101 country mansion of an earl. (That single afternoon of sun¬ light and roses was transformed by “a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,” into the transcendent incantations of “Burnt Norton,” the first of the “Quartets.”) In America she waited, in tranquil patience and steady exultation, for the marriage that was never to come: generations of her students were informed of her friendship with the greatest of living poets. Eliot found in her, at a distance, unbodied love, half-elusive nostalgia, the fragility of an ideal. When she threatened, at Vivien’s death, to become a real-life en¬ cumbrance, he diluted their intimacy; but when he married Valerie Fletcher he sloughed Emily off altogether—rapidly and brutally. Stunned and demoralized —they had been friends for fifty years — she gave up teaching and spiralled into a breakdown. She spent the rest of her life in the hope that her importance to Eliot would not go unrecognized. Her enormous collection of his letters (more than a thou¬ sand)\n\nshe\n\ndonated\n\nto\n\nPrinceton\n\nUniversity,\n\nand —\n\nEliot-haunted and Eliot-haunting — she asked him to re¬ turn hers. He did not reply; he had apparently destroyed them. The “man I loved,” she wrote to Princeton, “I think, did not respond as he should have to my long trust, friend¬ ship and love.” She stipulated that the Princeton repository not be opened until 2019; she looked to her vindication then. Having been patient so long, she was willing to be patient even beyond the grave. Eliot may have bestowed his infirm old age on Miss Fletcher, but the future would see that he had loved"
