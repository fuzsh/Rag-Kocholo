        "text": "Successful anglo-american entrepreneurs and the american dream. A narrative analysis\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKeijzer, Marian; LiÃ±Ã¡n, Francisco (Coordinador); GuzmÃ¡n Cuevas, JoaquÃ­n J. (Coordinador)\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSome of the most successful entrepreneurs in the Anglo-American world have written their autobiographies. A narrative analysis of these autobiographies reveal the influence of the American Dream on their life and on the way they tell their lifestories. An emphasis on moral correctness as well as on working hard, perseverance and discipline justifies the success of the narrators. The American Myth seems to be a reality â at least for white, Anglo-American, male entrepreneur...\n\nA longitudinal experimental study comparing the effectiveness of happiness-enhancing strategies in Anglo Americans and Asian Americans.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBoehm, Julia K; Lyubomirsky, Sonja; Sheldon, Kennon M\n\n2011-11-01\n\nGrowing evidence suggests that well-being interventions can be effective. However, it is unclear whether happiness-increasing practices are equally effective for individuals from different cultural backgrounds. To investigate this question, Anglo Americans and predominantly foreign-born Asian Americans were randomly assigned to express optimism, convey gratitude, or list their past experiences (control group). Multilevel analyses indicated that participants in the optimism and gratitude conditions reported enhanced life satisfaction relative to those in the control condition. However, Anglo Americans in the treatment conditions demonstrated larger increases in life satisfaction relative to Asian Americans, while both cultural groups in the control condition showed the least improvement. These results are consistent with the idea that the value individualist cultures place on self-improvement and personal agency bolsters the efforts of Anglo Americans to become more satisfied, whereas collectivist cultures' de-emphasis of self-focus and individual goals interferes with the efforts of Asian Americans to pursue enhanced well-being.\n\nWhat Every Librarian Should Know About Proposed Changes in Cataloging Rules: A Brief Overview\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEdgar, Neal L.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nA discussion of Anglo-American Cataloging Rules includes history, revisions, recent changes, decision-makers and disagreements, and the question of how standardization and the needs of automation will affect the usefulness of the catalog for the library's users.

The most common mechanism of transmission is sexual intercourse. Although there are several hypotheses, the exact origin of the disease remains unknown. Newly published evidence suggests that the hypothesis supporting the theory of the American origin of the disease is the valid one. Among 1500 analyzed pathographies of composers and musicians, data on ten Anglo-American composers and jazz musicians having suffered from neurosyphilis (tertiary stage of the disease) were extracted for this report. In this group of Anglo-American composers and musicians, most of them died from progressive paralysis while still in the creative phase of life. Additionally, diagnoses of eleven other famous neurosyphilitic composers, as well as basic biographic data on ten less known composers that died from neurosyphilis-progressive paralysis are also briefly mentioned. In conclusion, neurosyphilis can cause serious neurological damage, as well as permanent disability or death, preventing further work and skill improvement.\n\nThe Globalization of Qualitative Research: Challenging Anglo-American Domination and Local Hegemonic Discourse\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPing-Chun Hsiung\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Over the past decades, scholarly interest has led to publications on the practices and development of qualitative research (QR in countries outside of the Anglo-American core. Much of the writing is descriptive, providing an overview of the QR path and development in a particular country. Recently, qualitative researchers in the periphery have begun to articulate a collective professional identity in relation to the Anglo-American core by questioning both the dominance of the Anglo-American core and the current divide between QR in the core and the periphery. To date, insufficient effort has been made to develop this collective professional identity in order to overcome Anglo-American domination in the periphery and to indigenize QR. In this article, I propose a globally-informed, locally-situated analytical framework as a means of developing a globalized QR (GQR. I argue that qualitative scholars in the periphery must simultaneously confront Anglo-American domination and local hegemonic discourses. I discuss what scholars in the core and periphery can do to lead to a shift in the current division of labor that sees scholarship in the core producing theory and methods while those in the periphery consume and reproduce it. More attention needs to be paid to the indigenization of QR in the periphery.

The cultural categories nervios and 'nerves', as applied by Mexican-American and Anglo-American relatives to family members diagnosed with schizophrenia, are examined. While Mexican-Americans tended to consider nervios an appropriate interpretation of the problem, Anglo-Americans explicitly dismissed the parallel English term 'nerves'. Anglo-American relatives were likely to consider the problem as 'mental' in nature, often with specific reference to psychiatric diagnostic labels such as 'schizophrenia'. Although variations in conceptions appear related to both ethnicity and socioeconomic status, significant cultural differences were observed independent of socioeconomic status. These results raise questions concerning contemporary anthropological views that psychosis is conceptualized in substantially similar ways cross-culturally, and underscore the need for more contextualized understanding of the meaning and application of indigenous concepts of mental disorder. The paper concludes with a discussion of psychocultural meanings associated with ethnopsychiatric labels for schizophrenia and their importance for the social and moral status of patients and their kin.\n\nAnglo-American views of Gavrilo Princip\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarkovich Slobodan G.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper deals with Western (Anglo-American views on the Sarajevo assassination/attentat and Gavrilo Princip. Articles on the assassination and Princip in two leading quality dailies (The Times and The New York Times have particularly been analysed as well as the views of leading historians and journalists who covered the subject including: R. G. D. Laffan, R. W. Seton-Watson, Winston Churchill, Sidney Fay, Bernadotte Schmitt, Rebecca West, A. J. P. Taylor, Vladimir Dedijer, Christopher Clark and Tim Butcher. In the West, the original general condemnation of the assassination and its main culprits was challenged when Rebecca West published her famous travelogue on Yugoslavia in 1941. Another Brit, the remarkable historian A. J. P. Taylor, had a much more positive view on the Sarajevo conspirators and blamed Germany and Austria-Hungary for the outbreak of the Great War. A turning point in Anglo-American perceptions was the publication of Vladimir Dedijerâs monumental book The Road to Sarajevo (1966, which humanised the main conspirators, a process initiated by R. West. Dedijerâs book was translated from English into all major Western languages and had an immediate impact on the understanding of the Sarajevo assassination. The rise of national antagonisms in Bosnia gradually alienated Princip from Bosnian Muslims and Croats, a process that began in the 1980s and was completed during the wars of the Yugoslav succession. Although all available sources clearly show that Princip, an ethnic Serb, gradually developed a broader Serbo-Croat and Yugoslav identity, he was ethnified and seen exclusively as a Serb by Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks and Western journalists in the 1990s. In the past century imagining Princip in Serbia and the West involved a whole spectrum of views. In interwar Anglo-American perceptions he was a fanatic and lunatic. He became humanised by Rebecca West (1941, A. J. P. Taylor showed understanding for his act (1956, he was fully\n\nAllocentric and Idiocentric Self-Description and Academic Achievement among Mexican American and Anglo American Adolescents.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDabul, Amy J.; And Others\n\n1995-01-01\n\nPosits a distinction between cultures motivated by individualistic value systems (idiocentric) and collectivistic value systems (allocentric).

Found that, even after controlling for number of siblings and birth order, statistically significant differences in such behavior remained between the two groups.â¦\n\nProfiling vocabulary in psychology journal abstracts: A comparison between Iranian and Anglo-American journals\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIsâhaaq Akbarian\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Lexical profiling has yielded fruitful results for language description and pedagogy (Liu, 2014, and particularly highlighted the significance of academic vocabulary for EFL learners in this process. This investigation, likewise, attempts to comparatively profile the vocabulary, more particularly the academic vocabulary, in the âabstractâ section of scholarly articles in Iranian and Anglo-American refereed journals in psychology. Iranian journals under study publish articles in Persian but also include an English abstract whereas the latter publish papers in English. For this purpose, a corpus (consisting of 307,126 words, with two sub-corpora of almost similar size and characteristics, was collected from Iranian and Anglo-American journals and analyzed through the software Range. The analyses conducted show a coverage of over 15 percent and the use of over 500 words of the Academic Word List (AWL in both Iranian and Anglo-American sub-corpora. However, there are variations in academic and nonacademic vocabulary use in abstracts across the two sub-corpora above. Most of the academic words used belong to the beginning AWL sub-lists. Pedagogical implications are made for reading and writing, particularly in EAP contexts.\n\nCultural Differences in Korean- and Anglo-American Preschoolers' Social Interaction and Play Behaviors.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFarver, Jo Ann M.; And Others\n\n1995-01-01\n\nCompared Korean American and Anglo-American preschoolers' social and play behavior to determine the influence of culture on early development and to understand how culture shapes and organizes the environment in which children's social and play activities take place.

Some company veterans insisted that deaths were inevitable at such a large mining company, given the dangerous nature of the business. Carroll fundamentally rejected that assumption. She undertook a tour of operations in Australia, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, and South Africa. The platinum business in South Africa had the worst track record in terms of safety, and Carroll was troubled by her conversations with its local managers. Immediately after her visit, another worker died. That was it. She ordered the world's largest platinum mine, which employed 30,000 people, to be shut down immediately. Intensive retraining began, and 3,000 leaders and 12,000 line managers, supervisors, and frontline employees have been through the program since 2008. Carroll also initiated the Tripartite Alliance, a collaboration with the South African Department of Mineral Resources and the National Union of Mineworkers, to study global best practices in safety and make recommendations. By 2011 she had reduced fatalities at Anglo American by 62% and had cut time lost owing to injuries by half.\n\nEducational Leadership and Culture in China: Dichotomies between Chinese and Anglo-American Leadership Traditions?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLaw, Wing-Wah\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis article explores the extent to which Chinese school leaders espouse dichotomous or integrated Chinese and Anglo-American leadership and management preferences.

A Democratic-Deliberative Answer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMorales-GÃ¡lvez Sergi\n\n2016-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Should English be promoted as a worldwide lingua franca for justice-related reasons? Philippe Van Parijs answers affirmatively in order to promote global distributive justice. In contrast, I argue that a rapid expansion of English could lead to one undesirable consequence that ought to be prevented: the globalization of an Anglo-American life-world that impoverishes democratic-deliberative debates. Inspired by John Stuart Mill, I will defend the idea that the more dominant the Anglo-American life-world is, the less diversity of life-worlds and, therefore, the less diversity of substantial voices in the global democratic-deliberative process there will be. It might be that more voices could be heard (because of the lingua franca, but with less substantial diversity of opinions. In that sense, the life-worlds (and language as an access key to them have an instrumental value that enables plurality and better deliberative discussion. For that reason, I contend that there is a pro tanto reason to prevent the expansion of English as a lingua franca.\n\nThe Image of War Correspondents in Anglo-American Fiction. Journalism Monographs Number Ninety-Seven.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGood, Howard\n\nThe work of war correspondents involves violence, danger, and drama; and what they endure to get a story is often as interesting as the actual news itself.

It continued to bask in the glow of the pre-World War I Nobel prize awarded jointly in 1912 to Victor Grignard and Paul Sabatier. In addition, the influence of the two mandarins then in power, Charles PrÃ©vost at the Sorbonne and Albert Kirrmann, a Dean in Strasbourg who would be called upon as vice-director at the Ãcole normale supÃ©rieure in Paris, saw to it that the only theory of organic reactions, admissible in the classroom and in the laboratory, was PrÃ©vost's. As Mary Jo Nye has shown, a wall was erected against penetration of the ideas of the British school of Ingold and Hughes. Mechanistic chemistry, as was being vigorously studied by the contemporary Anglo-American physical organic chemists, was 'persona non grata' in France. Publication by Bianca Tchoubar, in 1960, of \"Les mÃ©canismes rÃ©actionnels en chimie organique\" opened a breach. The irony was for Dr. Tchoubar, a militant member of the Communist Party and a lady of fierce opinions, to have become a propagandist for the Anglo-American school of mechanistic studies. Truth for her overruled political propaganda. Her little book was revolutionary in the French context of the times. Together with the GECO (Groupe d'Ã©tude de chimie organique) summer conferences pioneered by Guy Ourisson after his return from Harvard, it ushered in the new ideas. This historical essay, based on an in-depth study of Tchoubar's book, will include a portrait of this remarkable woman scientist. It will delve at some length into the renewal of French science initiated by De Gaulle's government after his return to power in 1958. The tension in the French scientific establishment of the sixties reflected two opposed versions of nationalism, the one conservative, Malthusian, inner-directed, the other forward-looking, eager for the recovery of national status, seeing a strong French science as a means for asserting national\n\nMutual brokerage and womenâs participation in nineteenth-century Anglo-American abolitionist movements\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nWalsh-Russo, Cecelia Catherine\n\n2017-01-01\n\nan international network of abolitionist actors tied to one another through previous fora for discussion and debate. Mutual brokerage is perhaps most clearly seen within the example of female abolitionists during the nineteenth-century abolition campaigns. Women brought to the Anglo-American abolitionism the co...... of the movement were channels through which ideas flowed. Instead of a one-directional flow with brokers as translators bringing new tactics from one locale to another, the channels were characterized by the absence of earlier âoriginatorsâ and later âadoptersâ â traditional categories assigned to actors within...\n\nCultural variation in the motivational standards of self-enhancement and self-criticism among bicultural Asian American and Anglo American students.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZusho, Akane\n\n2008-10-01\n\nRecent work on biculturalism has made theoretical and methodological inroads into our understanding of the relation of cultural processes with psychological functioning. Through the use of cultural priming methodologies, investigators have demonstrated that biculturals, or individuals who have experienced and identify with more than one culture, can switch between various \"cultural frames of reference\" in response to corresponding social cues (Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-Martinez, 2000). Drawing on this work on the cognitive implications of biculturalism, the purpose of the present study was to examine the assumption that independent and interdependent self-construals are associated with the motivational standards of self-enhancement and self-criticism, respectively. More specifically, the effects of differential primes of self on ratings of self-enhancement were investigated in a sample of bicultural Asian American (N = 42) and Anglo American (N = 60) college students; overall, more similarities than differences were noted between the two groups. It was hypothesized that Anglo American students would display marked tendencies toward self-enhancement. However, this hypothesis was not supported. Nevertheless, consistent prime effects were observed for a selected number of ratings related to academic virtues, with those who received an independent-self prime often exhibiting greater self-enhancing tendencies than those who received an interdependent-self prime. For example, participants in the independent-self condition reported on average significantly higher ratings for self-discipline and initiative, as well as the degree to which they perceived themselves to be hard working. Implications for the work on self-representations, motivation, and acculturation are discussed.\n\nParamedic versus emergency physician emergency medical service: role of the anaesthesiologist and the European versus the Anglo-American concept\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nTimmermann, Arnd; Russo, Sebastian G.; Hollmann, Markus W.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPurpose of review Much controversy exists about who can provide the best medical care for critically ill patients in the prehospital setting.

Specifically, the study describes the psychometric properties of a newly developed 7-item machismo measure, compares levels of machismo and self-esteem for a sample of Anglo, black and Mexican-American males, and examines both main and interaction effects of machismo, self-esteem and education as predictors of alcohol use in these racial/ethnic subgroups. Logistic regression analyses document interaction between race/ethnicity, machismo, self-esteem and education, which calls into question the presumed importance of machismo as a cultural element causing heavy drinking patterns among Mexican-American males.\n\nJohnston R.J. & Sidaway J.D., eds., Geography and geographers, Anglo-American human geography since 1945\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nVandeburie, Julien\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis well-known book is in its sixth edition and focuses on Anglo-American geographers, with a historical/thematic point of view.

It uses concepts within embodied cognition to speculate on how historians can write a history of sensation. Bodies are actively engaged in the linguistic processes and social interactions that constitute painful sensations. Language is engaged in a dialogue with physiological bodies and social environments. And culture collaborates in the creation of physiological bodies and metaphorical systems.\n\nIncreasingly heterogeneous ages at first birth by education in Southern-European and Anglo-American family-policy regimes: A seven-country comparison\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRendall, Michael; Aracil, Encarnacion; Bagavos, Christos; Couet, Christine; DeRose, Alessandra; DiGiulio, Paola; Lappegard, Trude; Robert-BobÃ©e, Isabelle; RÃ¸nsen, Marit; Smallwood, Steve; Verropoulou, Georgia\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFamily-policy regimes unfavourable to combining employment with motherhood have been claimed to increase socio-economic differentials in fertility as combining employment and motherhood has become more normative. This claim has to date been explored mainly in reference to âliberalâ Anglo-American regimes. Comparing education differentials in age at first birth among native-born women of 1950s and 1960s birth cohorts in seven countries representing three regime types, we find persistence in early first births among low-educated women not only in Britain and the United States but also in Greece, Italy, and Spain. Shifts towards later first births, however, were more extreme in Southern Europe and involved to some extent women at all education levels. The educationally-heterogeneous changes in age patterns of first births seen in the Southern European and Anglo-American family-policy regimes contrast with educationally-homogeneous changes across birth cohorts seen in the studyâs two âuniversalisticâ countries, Norway and France.

In the United States, populist pressure has resulted in a community protection approach exemplified by sex offender registration, community notification, and civil commitment of violent sexual predators. Although the United Kingdom and Canada have followed, albeit more cautiously, the American trend to adopt exclusionist community protection measures, these countries have significant community-based restorative justice initiatives, such as Circles of Support and Accountability. Although sex offender crises have recently occurred in continental Europe, a long-standing tradition of the medicalization of deviance, along with the existence of social structural buffers against the influence of victim-driven populist penal movements, has thus far limited the spread of formal community protection responses.\n\nEDITORIAL Re-fighting the 2nd Anglo-Boer War: historians in the ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\neconomic and political cost to South Africa was greater than the statistics immediately indicate: at least ... battles and foreign wars, the British casualties of the Anglo-Boer War became ...

In juxtaposing African Americans' often glowing discussions of European tolerance with the actual white resistance the black champion faced in Britain, including the Home Office's eventual prohibition of the match, the article explores the period's transnational discourses of race and citizenship. Indeed, as white sportsmen on both sides of the Atlantic joined together in their search for a \"White Hope\" to unseat Johnson, the boxing ring became an important cultural arena for interracial debates over the political and social divisions between white citizens and nonwhite subjects. Although African Americans had high hopes for their hero's European sojourn, the British backlash against the Johnson-Wells match underscored the fact that their local experiences of racial oppression were just one facet of a much broader global problem. At the same time, the proposed prizefight also made the specter of interracial conflict in the colonies all the more tangible in the British capital, provoking public discussions about the merits of U.S. racial segregation, along with the need for white Anglo-Saxon solidarity around the world. Thus, this article not only exposes the underlying connections between American Jim Crow and the racialized fault lines of British imperialism, but it also traces the \"tense and tender ties\" linking U.S. and African American history with the new imperial history and postcolonial studies.\n\nTemperament and Young Children with Visual Impairments: Perceptions of Anglo and Latino Parents\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDote-Kwan, Jamie; Chen, Deborah\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis study examined the temperamental characteristics of 18 toddlers with visual impairments as reported by their Anglo and Latino (Mexican American) parents.

Data for analysis were taken from a survey of the world psychiatric journals indexed in Index Medicus 1999 (IM), the alphabetical list used by PubMed, and from the mean impact factor (IF) values of the journals. Approximately 80% of international psychiatric literature available on PubMed is published in Anglo-Saxon countries, especially in the USA (59.8% of the total). The widespread use of the English language (94.9% of all the journals) further stresses the dominance of the Anglo-Saxon cultural model, as do the mean IF values of Anglo-Saxon journals compared to non-Anglo-Saxon publications (3.252 vs. 1.693; P=0.0079). The under-representation of non-Anglo-Saxon cultural models on PubMed plays a negative role for bringing about a truly multicultural literature in psychiatry.\n\nUse of culture care theory with Anglo- and African American elders in a long-term care setting.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMcFarland, M R\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to discover the care expressions, practices, and patterns of elderly Anglo- and African American elders. The domain of inquiry was the cultural care of elderly residents within the environmental context of a long-term care institution. The ethnonursing qualitative research method was used to conduct the study which was conceptualized within Leininger's theory of culture care diversity and universality. Four major themes were discovered: (a) Residents expressed and lived generic care to maintain their preadmission lifeways; (b) The nursing staff provided aspects of professional care to support satisfying lifeways for residents; (c) Institutional care patterns and expressions were viewed as a continuing life experience but with major differences between the apartment section and nursing home units; and (d) An institutional culture of the retirement home was discovered which reflected unique lifeways and shared care and health expressions and practices. These themes substantiated the culture care theory and revealed new modes of care for the elderly in an institutional setting.\n\nDental treatment in Anglo-Saxon England.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAnderson, T\n\n2004-09-11\n\nAnglo-Saxon medical literature suggests that care of the teeth was largely limited to non-invasive treatment. Cures, mainly for toothache, were based on herbal remedies, charms and amulets. Herbal potions also treated oral problems as diverse as caries and facial deformities. However, surgical intervention for cleft lip is mentioned in the later documents. Skeletal evidence confirms that cleft lip and palate was definitely known to the Anglo-Saxons. A possible dentist's grave has been identified.\n\nThe influence of Anglo-American theoretical models on the evolution of the nursing discipline in Spain.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRodrigo, Olga; CaÃ¯s, Jordi; Monforte-Royo, Cristina\n\n2017-07-01\n\nIn Spain, the introduction of the new Diploma in Nursing in 1977 saw the role of nurses shifting from that of medical assistants with technical skills to being independent members of the healthcare team with specific responsibility for providing professional nursing care. Here, we analyse the evolution of the nursing profession in Spain following the transfer of nurse education to universities, doing so through interviews with the first generation of academic tutors. This was a qualitative study using the method of analytic induction and based on the principles of grounded theory. Participants were selected by means of theoretical sampling and then underwent in-depth interviews. Steps were taken to ensure the credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability of data. The main conclusion of the analysis is that there is a gap between a theoretical framework borrowed from the Anglo-American context and a nursing practice that, in Spain, has traditionally prioritised the application of technical procedures, a role akin to that of a medical assistant. It is argued that a key factor underlying the way in which nursing in Spain has evolved in recent decades is the lack of conceptual clarity regarding what the role of the professional nurse might actually entail in practice.

[Anglo Ferrous Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, RJ (Brazil)\n\n2009-07-01\n\nThe objective of this paper is to present an overview of the long distance iron ore slurry pipeline from Anglo Ferrous Brazil. Anglo Ferrous Brazil is a company of Anglo American plc that is one of the world's largest mining and natural resource company. Minas-Rio is a world class iron ore project which has been developed in Brazil aiming to produce 26.6 million tons per year of concentrate. The mine, concentrator and pump station 1 will be located in Conceicao do Mato Dentro, Minas Gerais state, and the terminal station will be located at Acu Port in Sao Joao da Barra, Rio de Janeiro state. The long distance iron ore slurry pipeline will be one of major differentials of Minas-Rio Project and its useful life was initially estimated in 20 years. The slurry pipeline has a total length of 525 kilometers and will be constructed from predominately 26 inches external diameter API 5L X70 pipes. From kilometer 314 to kilometer 480, 24 inches pipe will be installed to prevent slack flow downstream pump station 2. The pump station 1 is designed to provide the hydraulic head necessary to transport the concentrate iron ore slurry with 8 positive displacement pumps to pump station 2. The pump station 2, located 240 kilometers downstream pump station 1, is designed to operate with 10 positive displacement pumps. The valve station will be located at kilometer 347 and will be used to break the static head between pump station 2 and the terminal station during a slurry pipeline shutdown.

Steyn\n\n2010-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Representations of the Boer in French youth literature duringthe Anglo Boer War Representations of the âotherâ or alterity are to a large extent influenced by the historical context of the onlooker. When this historical context changes, it often happens that the representation of the âotherâ is adapted accordingly. This article provides a short overview of the way in which French representations of the Boers in youth novels written before the Anglo-Boer War differ from youth novels about the war. Before the war the Boer is described as a Dutch descendant living in utmost, almost barbaric, simplicity. When the Anglo- Boer War breaks out, the Boer becomes an alter ego for the French who indirectly continue the French struggle against the British. This article discusses the way in which the French adapt their representation of the Boers in order for young French readers to identify with the Boers.\n\nCOMPARATIVE STUDY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ANGLO-SAXON AND ROMANIAN ACCOUNTING\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNicolae ECOBICI\n\n2010-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The two accounting systems, the French and Anglo-Saxon, tend to harmonize.

It is therefore important to define the normal geometric nasal parameters of a given race, so as to detect the abnormal nose. We present acoustic rhinometric data, with height-adjusted figures, examining the nasal minimum cross-sectional area (MCA), the distance to the nostril from the MCA, and the MCA between 0-6 cm. These data show no significant differences between Indian and Anglo-Saxon noses.\n\nEvidence for an apartheid-like social structure in early Anglo-Saxon England.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nThomas, Mark G; Stumpf, Michael P H; HÃ¤rke, Heinrich\n\n2006-10-22\n\nThe role of migration in the Anglo-Saxon transition in England remains controversial. Archaeological and historical evidence is inconclusive, but current estimates of the contribution of migrants to the English population range from less than 10000 to as many as 200000. In contrast, recent studies based on Y-chromosome variation posit a considerably higher contribution to the modern English gene pool (50-100%). Historical evidence suggests that following the Anglo-Saxon transition, people of indigenous ethnicity were at an economic and legal disadvantage compared to those having Anglo-Saxon ethnicity. It is likely that such a disadvantage would lead to differential reproductive success. We examine the effect of differential reproductive success, coupled with limited intermarriage between distinct ethnic groups, on the spread of genetic variants. Computer simulations indicate that a social structure limiting intermarriage between indigenous Britons and an initially small Anglo-Saxon immigrant population provide a plausible explanation of the high degree of Continental male-line ancestry in England.\n\nAerobic fitness of Anglo-Saxon and Indian students.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHardy, C P; Eston, R G\n\n1985-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the aerobic fitness of two groups of male college students: 32 Anglo-Saxon males (age range 16-18 years) with 27 Indian males, born in England, (age range 16-23 years), none of whom was highly active in any particular sport. Maximal oxygen uptake was estimated by submaximal test on a cycle ergometer and percent body fat was assessed by skinfold calipers. The Anglo-Saxon group had higher absolute and relative maximal oxygen consumption values and higher body weight. There was no difference in percent fat between the two groups. Strength data were also provided for descriptive purposes.\n\nAnglo-American Credit Scoring and Consumer Debt in the Subprime Mortgage Crisis of 2007 as Models for Other Countries?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nThomas Fay Ruddy\n\n2010-08-01\n\nFull Text Available The system of credit scoring has been built up in recent times on the basis of a compromise struck between individuality and surveillance in ways that boosted consumption through consumer debt. This paper considers the role of credit scoring in the recent financial crisis, concluding that even if credit scoring had worked as intended under its own terms, the practice would not have been enough to limit the defaulting of mortgage borrowers under conditions of falling house prices. The broader economic problem is the crippling amount of consumer debt involved; hence the paper places credit scoring in the larger explanatory framework of consumer debt and, more generally, consumerism in its more problematic form. The sorting accomplished by credit scoring is open to abuses in the marketplace, unless it is tempered by the application of guardrails by a regulatory authority. As cultures beyond the Anglo-American sphere adopt this practice, guardrails like those applied to credit scoring in America are needed; as even the current U.S. Administration has acknowledged, the existing guardrails will have to be complemented by stricter social standards. The paper provides a derivation of the theoretical background on credit scoring as surveillance, and includes a literature survey.\n\nDEVELOPMENT AND WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ANGLO NUBIAN GOAT\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAngelika Stemmer\n\n2009-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The present study describes the formation of the Anglo Nubian breed in Britain and follows up the original transfer of the founder breeds to Britain in the 19th century. An overview on the worldwide spread of the Anglo Nubian from Britain to the USA and Canada, later to Africa and Asia as well as Latin America is given. Information was compiled through project reports, literature, statistical records where available and accessible and interviews with experts. It is concluded that the Anglo Nubian is an example of a breed developed by combining genetic resources from different parts of the world joining performance and adaptation to tropical conditions. The breed spread to all continents. Apart from being kept as purebreds, it is more often used in crossbreeding programmes in different regions of the world. The value of this genetic resource has been recognized a long time ago, but there seem to be no efforts to counteract the danger of loosing it by excessive use in uncontrolled crossbreeding.\n\nThe Anglo-Iranian oil dispute\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFerrier, R.W.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThis paper traces the history of the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute. It is short-sighted to consider the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute just as a contest between Musaddiq and the AIOC: it is of wider and greater significance. The dispute illustrates a transitional phase in the difficult process of the adjustment of relations between industrialized and less developed societies for the exploitation of raw materials. Oil was already becoming a political and economic factor at the end of the Qajar period and became important during the reign of Riza Shah with his emphasis on a national program of modernization. After more attention had been focused on it during the second world war it was inevitable that it would increase in influence. The issues of the oil dispute referred back to the concessional controversies of the late nineteenth century in tobacco, mining, communications, utilities, banking even gambling, with their political and social implications; and they referred forward to the issues of the sovereignty of national resources, the transfer of technology and economic growth in relation to the standard of living. These are aspects of the North-South debate, which have yet to be satisfactorily resolved\n\nFrom national allegory to cosmopolitanism: Transformations in contemporary Anglo-Indian and Turkish novels\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nDoÄangÃ¼n, S.A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this study, I explore the transformation of contemporary Turkish and Anglo-Indian novels from national allegories to sites of multiple belongings by way of a comparative analysis.

It remains an open question how these events affected the genetic composition of the current British population. Here, we present whole-genome sequences from 10 individuals excavated close to Cambridge in the East of England, ranging from the late Iron Age to the middle Anglo-Saxon period. By analysing shared rare variants with hundreds of modern samples from Britain and Europe, we estimate that on average the contemporary East English population derives 38% of its ancestry from Anglo-Saxon migrations. We gain further insight with a new method, rarecoal, which infers population history and identifies fine-scale genetic ancestry from rare variants. Using rarecoal we find that the Anglo-Saxon samples are closely related to modern Dutch and Danish populations, while the Iron Age samples share ancestors with multiple Northern European populations including Britain.\n\n12th National Cataloguing Conference.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTan, Janine; Olston, Julie; Dearman, Rosemary; Hay, Ros; Butler, Gabrielle; Giopoulos, Jenny; Moloney, Julie; Pearce, Fran\n\n1997-01-01\n\nSummarizes issues raised at the 1997 national cataloging conference of the Australian Library and Information Association.

However, this has not benefited from direct analyses of ancient genomes. Here we report nine ancient genomes (â¼ 1 Ã) of individuals from northern Britain: seven from a Roman era York cemetery, bookended by earlier Iron-Age and later Anglo-Saxon burials. Six of the Roman genomes show affinity with modern British Celtic populations, particularly Welsh, but significantly diverge from populations from Yorkshire and other eastern English samples. They also show similarity with the earlier Iron-Age genome, suggesting population continuity, but differ from the later Anglo-Saxon genome. This pattern concords with profound impact of migrations in the Anglo-Saxon period. Strikingly, one Roman skeleton shows a clear signal of exogenous origin, with affinities pointing towards the Middle East, confirming the cosmopolitan character of the Empire, even at its northernmost fringes.\n\nLupines, manganese, and devil-sickness: an Anglo-Saxon medical response to epilepsy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDendle, P\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe most frequently prescribed herb for \"devil-sickness\" in the vernacular medical books from Anglo-Saxon England, the lupine, is exceptionally high in manganese. Since manganese depletion has been linked with recurring seizures in both clinical and experimental studies, it is possible that lupine administration responded to the particular pathophysiology of epilepsy. Lupine is not prescribed for seizures in classical Mediterranean medical sources, implying that the Northern European peoples (if not the Anglo-Saxons themselves) discovered whatever anticonvulsive properties the herb may exhibit.\n\nLeveraging Strength: The Pillars of American Grand Strategy in World War II\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2011-01-01\n\nyearning for peaceâand doing so in a single, one-page package âwas a particular genius of American wartime advertisers.

The labour market policies in the United Kingdom were different depending on the historical and political period; however, the Anglo-Saxon model is characterized mainly by high flexibility but low security.

Previous pharmacological studies of medicinal plants mentioned in Anglo-Saxon medical texts suggested that some were effective and led to the identification and isolation of natural compounds. For example, matricin from yarrow Achillea millefolium L., is a proprionic acid analogue that yields chamazulene carboxylic acid with cyclooxygenase-2 activity similar to that of ibuprofen. As we discuss here, multidisciplinary projects could further explore historical texts to discover additional plant metabolites with potential pharmacological applications.

There are less than a dozen iron smelting sites known. This is a distinct contrast to the wealth of evidence of iron smelting during the Roman period. Should we believe that the Anglo-Saxon world......-west Europe emphasises how marginal they were in society, along with their goods.

In order to understand the dynamic role of iron in Anglo Saxon society, we must review the negative evidence...... of iron smelting, and the evidence for smithing. This should be considered with reference to the literary evidence available to us in the context of the Migration period in northwest Europe. Iron production in early Anglo-Saxon England should also be sought after using archaeological prospection...\n\nThe role of the men's hall in the development of the Anglo-Saxon superego.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEarl, J W\n\n1983-05-01\n\nThis paper is a historical study of ritual space--a bit of psychoanalytic anthropology applied to a particular case, the evolution of the men's hall among the early Anglo-Saxons. I focus particularly on the ritual functions of poetry in the hall, the same poetry which is our major evidence regarding the hall, especially the epic Beowulf. I define the hall as a cultural institution, and redefine the native poetic tradition in relation to the hall's varied ritual life, with which the poetry is so occupied. Though my argument is focused on the hall, it includes a framework of theoretical concerns. Early Anglo-Saxon culture is of anthropological interest chiefly because of its rapid and dramatic emergence from Germanic tribal prehistory into a leading role in the civilization of Christian Europe. The conquest of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries, and their conversion soon afterward, is a case history of the transformations of a tribal society suddenly introduced to the special forces of civilization and the higher religions that control them. The Anglo-Saxons are fascinating in this regard because of the fortuitous developments that prepared for this transformation and made it so successful.\n\nImplicit Race/Ethnic Prejudice in Mexican Americans\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGarza, Christelle Fabiola; Gasquoine, Philip Gerard\n\n2013-01-01\n\nImplicit race/ethnic prejudice was assessed using Spanish- and English-language versions of an Implicit Association Test that used Hispanic/Anglo first names and pleasant/unpleasant words as stimuli.

The Network Company Model: An Anglo-Saxon Innovation or just a Re-invention?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOlivier de Gromard\n\n2009-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Since the early 1980s, the network company has become more widespread as it is considered the most appropriate organisational structure in a global economy. It is commonly agreed that this type of organisation is an Anglo-Saxon model. The aim of this article is to give some insights into this current opinion, through two complementary analyses: the first one investigates the link between the innovative boost in Anglo-Saxon countries and the creation of the network company model; the second one considers the role of traditional Chinese capitalism in the exceptional economic success of Hong Kong under British sovereignty.\n\nThe Beowulf manuscript reconsidered: Reading Beowulf in late Anglo-Saxon England\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nL. Viljoen\n\n2003-08-01\n\nFull Text Available This article defines a hypothetical late Anglo-Saxon audience: a multi-layered Christian community with competing ideologies, dialects and mythologies. It discusses how that audience might have received the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf. The immediate textual context of the poem constitutes an intertextual microcosm for Beowulf. The five texts in the codex provide interesting clues to the common concerns, conflicts and interests of its audience. The organizing principle for the grouping of this disparate mixture of Christian and secular texts with Beowulf was not a sense of canonicity or the collating of monuments with an aesthetic autonomy from cultural conditions or social production. They were part of the so-called âpopular cultureâ and provide one key to the âmeaningsâ that interested the late Anglo-Saxon audience, who would delight in the poet=s alliteration, rhythms, word-play, irony and understatement, descriptions, aphorisms and evocation of loss and transience. The poem provided cultural, historical and spiritual data and evoked a debate about pertinent moral issues. The monsters, for instance, are symbolic of problems of identity construction and establish a polarity between âusâ and the âOtherâ, but at the same time question such binary thinking. Finally, the poem works towards an audience identity whose values emerge from the struggle within the poem and therefore also encompass the monstrous, the potentially disruptive, the darkness within B that which the poem attempts to repress.\n\nHeritage-Language Literacy Practices: A Case Study of Three Japanese American Families\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHashimoto, Kumi; Lee, Jin Sook\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis article documents the heritage-language (HL) literacy practices of three Japanese American families residing in a predominantly Anglo and Latino community.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Baseline data from the observational Fremantle Diabetes Study collected from 1993 to 1996 (phase I) and from 2008 to 2011 (phase II) were analyzed. Patients characterized as Aboriginal or Anglo-Celt by self-report and supporting data underwent comprehensive assessment, including questionnaires, examination, and biochemical testing in a single laboratory. Generalized linear modeling with age/sex adjustment was used to examine differences in changes in variables in the two groups between phases I and II. RESULTS The indigenous participants were younger at entry and at diabetes diagnosis than the Anglo-Celt participants in both phases. They were also less likely to be educated beyond primary level and were more likely to be smokers. HbA1c decreased in both groups over time (Aboriginal median 9.6% [interquartile range 7.8â10.7%] to 8.4% [6.6â10.6%] vs. Anglo-Celt median 7.1% [6.2â8.4%] to 6.7% [6.2â7.5%]), but the gap persisted (P = 0.65 for difference between phases I and II by ethnic group). Aboriginal patients were more likely to have microvascular disease in both phases. The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial index â¤0.90 or lower-extremity amputation) increased in Aboriginal but decreased in Anglo-Celt participants (15.8â29.7 vs. 30.7â21.5%; P = 0.055). CONCLUSIONS Diabetes management has improved for Aboriginal and Anglo-Celt Australian patients, but disparities in cardiovascular risk factors and complications persist.

G.\n\n2010-07-01\n\nIn 1879 Benjamin Apthorp Gould published in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the Uranometria Argentina catalog of 7756 stars south of declination +10 degrees. This included all those stars he considered magnitude 7 or brighter and some fainter stars which are close companions to brighter stars or to each other and have combined magnitude 7 or brighter. Star positions are in 1875 coordinates, and constellation boundaries also in 1875 coordinates were defined within the aforementioned declination range. With only a few small changes these were incorporated into the boundaries adopted by the IAU in 1930 and subsequently universally accepted. In terms of accurate photoelectric magnitude measurements the Uranometria Argentina is nearly complete to magnitude 6.5 in its declination range. In each constellation the individual stars considered to be magnitude 7 and brighter were numbered in sequence of increasing right ascension in 1875 coordinates, except that in a few cases this sequence was somewhat adjusted so that stars close together could be listed on adjacent lines of text. The numbering system is analogous to that in the Flamsteed Catalogus Brittanicus and now widely used. Star numbers from the Uranometria Argentina rarely appear in the 21st century despite the potential utility of their use. They were included in the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac until 1978, and in the FK5 catalog until 1999, always with the letter G following the number in the Uranometria Argentina catalog. This serves to distinguish Flamsteed numbers with no following letters from Gould numbers, and is utilized in this presentation and recommended for general use. The file catalog.dat includes every star in the original Uranometria Argentina. In the original the constellations were presented in sequence of increasing distance from the south pole and numbered accordingly. For the convenience of 21st century astronomers the constellations are presented here by alphabetical sequence in\n\nA Fragmentary Archive: Migratory Feelings in Early Anglo-Saxon Women's Letters.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWatt, Diane\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe letters by Anglo-Saxon women in the Boniface correspondence are connected by cultural practices and emotions centered on the conversion mission that functioned to maintain connections between the Anglo-Saxon diaspora. A striking recurring focus of these letters is on loss and isolation, which connects them to the Old English elegies. Many of the letters describe the writers' traumatic experiences that result from the death or absence of kin. These are women who endured the trauma of being left behind when others migrated overseas or who, in traveling away from their homeland, found themselves isolated in an alien environment, displaced in time as well as space. This article offers an analysis of the letters, focusing on the queer temporalities they explore, the queer emotions they evoke, and the queer kinships that they forge. It argues that the women's letters represent fragments of an early queer archive of migratory feelings.\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: URAT Parallax Catalog (UPC) (Finch+, 2016)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFinch, C. T.; Zacharias, N.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe URAT Parallax Catalog (UPC) consists of 112177 parallaxes. The catalog utilizes all Northern Hemisphere epoch data from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) Robotic Astrometric Telescope (URAT). This data includes all individual exposures from April 2012 to June 2015 giving a larger epoch baseline for determining parallaxes over the 2-year span of the First USNO Robotic Astrometric Telescope Catalog (URAT1) (Zacharias et al., 2015, Cat. I/329) published data. The URAT parallax pipeline is custom code that utilizes routines from (Jao, C.-W., 2004, PhD thesis Georgia Stat), the JPL DE405 ephemeris and Green's parallax factor (Green, R.M., 1985, Spherical Astronomy) for determining parallaxes from a weighted least-squares reduction. The relative parallaxes have been corrected to absolute by using the distance color relation described in (Finch et. al, 2014, Cat. J/AJ/148/119) to determine a mean distance of all UCAC4 reference stars (R=8-16 mag) used in the astrometric reductions. Presented here are all significant parallaxes from the URAT Northern Hemisphere epoch data comprising of 2 groups: a) URAT parallax results for stars with prior published parallax, and b) first time trigonometric parallaxes as obtained from URAT data of stars without prior published parallax. Note, more stringent selection criteria have been applied to the second group than the first in order to keep the rate of false detections low. For specific information about the astrometric reductions please see 'The First U.S. Naval Observatory Robotic Astrometric Telescope Catalog' published paper (Zacharias et al., 2015AJ....150..101Z, Cat. I/329). For complete details regarding the parallax pipeline please see 'Parallax Results From URAT Epoch Data' (Finch and Zacharias, 2016, AJ, in press). This catalog gives all positions on the ICRS at Epoch J2014.0; it covers the magnitude range 6.56 to 16.93 in the URAT band-pass, with an average parallax precision of 4.3mas for stars having no known\n\nLearning Style Preferences of Asian American (Chinese, Filipino, Korean, and Vietnamese) Students in Secondary Schools.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPark, Clara C.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nInvestigates for perceptual learning style preferences (auditory, visual, kinesthetic, and tactile) and preferences for group and individual leaning of Chinese, Filipino, Korean, and Vietnamese secondary education students.

For each source, the CSC provides positions and multi-band fluxes, as well as derived spatial, spectral, and temporal source properties. Full-field and source region data products are also available, including images, photon event lists, light curves, and spectra. The Chandra X-ray Center CSC website (http://cxc.harvard.edu/csc/) is the place to visit for high-level descriptions of each source property and data product included in the catalog, along with other useful information, such as step-by-step catalog tutorials, answers to FAQs, and a thorough summary of the catalog statistical characterization. Eight categories of detailed catalog documents may be accessed from the navigation bar on most of the 50+ CSC pages; these categories are: About the Catalog, Creating the Catalog, Using the Catalog, Catalog Columns, Column Descriptions, Documents, Conferences, and Useful Links. There are also prominent links to CSCview, the CSC data access GUI, and related help documentation, as well as a tutorial for using the new CSC/Google Earth interface. Catalog source properties are presented in seven scientific categories, within two table views: the Master Source and Source Observations tables. Each X-ray source has one ``master source'' entry and one or more ``source observation'' entries, the details of which are documented on the CSC ``Catalog Columns'' pages. The master source properties represent the best estimates of the properties of a source; these are extensively described on the following pages of the website: Position and Position Errors, Source Flags, Source Extent and Errors, Source Fluxes, Source Significance, Spectral Properties, and Source Variability. The eight tutorials (``threads'') available on the website serve as a collective guide for accessing, understanding, and manipulating the source properties and data products provided by the catalog.\n\nUsing MSD prevention for cultural change in mining: Queensland Government/Anglo Coal Industry partnership.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTilbury, Trudy; Sanderson, Liz\n\n2012-01-01\n\nQueensland Mining has a strong focus on safety performance, but risk management of health, including Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) continues to have a lower priority. The reliance on individual screening of workers and lower level approaches such as manual handling training is part of the coal mining 'culture'. Initiatives such as the New South Wales and Queensland Mining joint project to develop good practice guidance for mining has allowed for a more consistent message on participatory ergonomics and prevention of MSD. An evidence based practice approach, including the introduction of participatory ergonomics and safe design principles, was proposed to Anglo American Coal operations in Queensland. The project consisted of a skills analysis of current health personnel, design of a facilitated participatory ergonomics training program, site visits to identify good practice and champions, and a graduated mentoring program for health personnel. Early results demonstrate a number of sites are benefiting from site taskforces with a focus on positive performance outcomes.\n\nThe Online Catalog Revolution.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKilgour, Frederick G.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nA review of library technological development and card catalog innovations of the past century and a half precedes a discussion of online public access catalog development.

The catalog is based on observations taken on more than 6000 visits (telescope pointings) of ACS/WFC and more than 25000 visits of WFPC2. The catalog is obtained by cross matching by position in the sky all Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) Source Extractor source lists for these instruments. The source lists describe properties of source detections within a visit. The calculations are performed on a SQL Server database system. First we collect overlapping images into groups, e.g., Eta Car, and determine nearby (approximately matching) pairs of sources from different images within each group. We then apply a novel algorithm for improving the cross matching of pairs of sources by adjusting the astrometry of the images. Next, we combine pairwise matches into maximal sets of possible multi-source matches. We apply a greedy Bayesian method to split the maximal matches into more reliable matches. We test the accuracy of the matches by comparing the fluxes of the matched sources. The result is a set of information that ties together multiple observations of the same object. A byproduct of the catalog is greatly improved relative astrometry for many of the HST images. We also provide information on nondetections that can be used to determine dropouts. With the catalog, for the first time, one can carry out time domain, multi-wavelength studies across a large set of HST data. The catalog is publicly available. Much more can be done to expand the catalog capabilities.\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: Mira stars discovered in LAMOST DR4 (Yao+, 2017)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYao, Y.; Liu, C.; Deng, L.; de Grijs, R.; Matsunaga, N.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nBy the end of 2016 March, the wide-field Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR4 catalog had accumulated 7681185 spectra (R=1800), of which 6898298 were of stars.

Venter\n\n2000-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Prominent motifs in a selection of sermons delivered before, during and immediately after the Anglo-Boer War This article investigates a selection (160 of sermons delivered before, during and after the Anglo-Boer war and published afterwards. The aim of the investigation is to indicate (possible repetitive motifs used in these sermons. The initial hypothesis taken was that the motif of freedom probably would have functioned prominently within the context of the war. The investigation of the 160 selected sermons, however, proved that although the motif of freedom indeed occurs, it is applied in the broad Biblical sense of being liberated from sin. Freedom in God is stressed and not primarily freedom from British oppression. Several other motifs also function prominently in these sermons â motifs like redemption in Christ, hope, comfort in hardship and peace with God in Jesus Christ.
