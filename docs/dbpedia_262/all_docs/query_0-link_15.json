Let's make it a great year!\n\nFind your bus route here:\n\nBus Route Finder for the 24-25 SY:\n\nhttps://www.pfisd.net/Page/4920\n\n2024-2025 Schedules\n\nPlease plan to check Skyward on Tuesday morning, before reporting to your first class. First period teachers will give students a paper copy of their schedule.\n\nSchedule changes can be requested Thursday, August 15 and Friday, August 16 only, via a QR code that will be posted in the hallway beginning Thursday.\n\nAttendance Reminders\n\nSpeaking of attendance - Showing up for the educational day has a big impact on a student’s academic success starting in kindergarten and continuing through high school. Even as children grow older and more independent, families play an important role in making sure students get to school safely every day and understand why attendance is so important for success in school and in life. We understand some absences can be unavoidable due to health issues or extenuating circumstances. We also know that when students miss too much school, regardless of the reason, it can cause them to fall behind academically. Your child is less likely to succeed if he or she is chronically absent—which means missing 15 or more days over the course of an entire school year.\n\nResearch shows:\n\nChildren chronically absent in kindergarten and 1st grade are much less likely to read at grade level by the end of 3rd grade.\n\nBy 6th grade, chronic absence is a proven early warning sign for students at risk for dropping out of school.\n\nBy 9th grade good attendance can predict graduation rates even better than 8th grade test scores.\n\nHere are a few practical tips to help support regular attendance:\n\nMake sure your children keep a regular bedtime and establish a morning routine.\n\nLay out clothes and pack backpacks the night before.\n\nEnsure your students go to school every day unless they are truly sick Avoid scheduling vacations or doctor’s appointments when school is in session.\n\nTalk to teachers and counselors for advice if your children feel anxious about going to school.\n\nDevelop back up plans for getting to school if something comes up. Call on a family member, neighbor, or another parent to take your child to school.\n\nSTUDENT IDs\n\nStudents are expected to wear their ID cards on a lanyard when they are on campus or at a school event as part of the PfSD & Campus policy for safety purposes. Students will have an opportunity to receive a new Student ID during the first week of school free of charge. Returning students are encouraged to use their student ID from last year if they have it. Starting August 19th, students will be charged $2 for a permanent ID and $1 for a temporary ID. Additional administrative penalties will occur starting August 19th for students that continue to receive temporary IDs and not in compliance. Please see the additional information using the link below, and remind your child to wear their IDs everyday, thank you.\n\nPHS ID Badge Policy\n\nCHROMEBOOKS\n\nChromebooks will be checked out to students during their ELA classes on Monday 8/19 and Tuesday 8/19. *Timeline is dependent upon device arrival and may be altered based on delivery date.\n\nStudents and Parents must sign the district required RESPONSIBILITY AGREEMENT. Please be on the lookout for this information as we near the end of the first week of school.\n\nIf a student never returned a chromebook, the device is listed as “Missing” and they cannot check out a new one until they have replaced or purchased the missing item.\n\nNP4H8 10 YEAR ACCOMPLISHMENT!\n\nPflugerville High School has earned designation as a No Place 4 Hate campus for the 2023-2024 school year. To earn this designation, the campus held student-led initiatives to decrease hate speech and bullying on campus. During the Fall semester, the clubs and teams across campus participated in Kindness Month. In the Spring, the students led a Strong Women Lift Other Women Up campaign during Women’s History Month. Staff and Students also proudly wear their NP4H8 tshirts. This is the 10th consecutive year PHS has earned the designation.

Meet our dedicated educators, discover how you can support your child's success, tour the building, and help us foster a vibrant school community. Join us for an amazing start to the school year. All 9th-12th Grade Pfamilies are invited!\n\nThis event provides an excellent opportunity to meet our Teachers, and School Staff. Our Meet the Teacher event is a chance for parents and students to explore the school and get acquainted with their classrooms and teachers. Mark your calendars and join us for an insightful tour.\n\nParents and Students will have an opportunity to:\n\nMeet with their assigned Teachers, Administrators, and additional Staff\n\nWalk the halls with their students and explore the campus\n\nConnect with College and Career advisors to talk about FAFSA and things pertaining to the Class of 2025.\n\nLearn about our various clubs and programs and all that PHS has to offer!\n\nFreshman Orientation-Class of 2028\n\nCalling all parents and students of the PHS Class of 2028 to join us for our Freshman Orientation on August 9, 2024.\n\nWe understand that transitioning to high school can be both exciting and overwhelming. This session is tailored specifically for parents of incoming freshmen. We will address any questions or concerns you may have and provide insights to help your child thrive in high school.\n\nImportant Logistics:\n\nTo ensure a smooth drop off and pick up, we ask students to arrive at the side of the building (near the Fine Arts Center/on the Golden Chick Side of the building) at entrance 5 or 6 (please see image below). For parents who are interested in attending our Parent session in the PAC, we invite you to drop off your student and park in the east parking lot.\n\nParent Sessions will begin and end according to the schedule based on your student’s last name. Students will be brought to the PAC to attend the last 15 minutes of the informational session and to reunite with their parents/guardians.\n\nFor those parents/guardians that cannot attend the parent session, your student will be released from the PAC for pick up at the end of their designated time.\n\nStudents do not need to bring anything with them. We will have student and staff leaders to help receive them at drop off, organize them into groups, guide them around the building, and conclude with a brief talk with the principal prior to exiting by the PAC at the pick up location.\n\nHow Does a High School Bell Schedule Work?\n\nUnlike middle school, high school is on a “block schedule”. A block schedule means we have “A Day” and “B Day”, which divides their 8 classes into two days (A day = 1st thru 4th period, B day = 5th thru 8th period).\n\nThe first day of school is an A day, then a B day, then the next week starts A, B,… you get the pattern. Any time we have a holiday or a weekend the pattern is just paused and continued again when we return. Meaning if a week ends with an A day, Monday is a B day. If a week ends with a B day, Monday is an A day. NOTE: The only exception is at the end of the semester (December). We start the 2nd semester in January on an A Day.\n\nBelow is a copy of our 2024-2025 ACE Bell Schedule:\n\nPHS Bell Schedule 2024-2025 (with ACE)\n\n1st/5th (90 minutes)\n\n9:00 - 10:30\n\n2nd/6th (90 minutes)\n\n1st Lunch 10:35 - 11:05\n\nClass 10:35 - 11:20\n\nClass 10:35 - 12:05\n\nClass 11:05-12:35\n\n2nd Lunch 11:20 - 11:50\n\nLunch (30 minutes)\n\nClass 11:50 - 12:35\n\n3rd Lunch 12:05 - 12:35\n\n3rd/7th (90 minutes)\n\n12:40 - 2:10\n\nACE (25 minutes)\n\n2:15 - 2:40\n\n4th/8th (90 minutes)\n\n2:45 - 4:15\n\nWhat is the ACE?\n\nACE is a specific class assigned to every student. Every 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade student will have an ACE. This class meets EVERY DAY Monday thru Friday (with the exception of the first day of school, pep rally days, testing days, and other “special” days). It is exempt from the A/B day rotation.\n\nAt the start of school, this class will serve as a homeroom/advisory where we share important school expectations, traditions, celebrations, and more. It is also a great place for students to ask questions and get help with campus logistics and expectations.\n\nEventually, it will transition (in task, not location/logistics) into a daily class period that supports students with intervention, enrichment, social emotional, study hall, and important announcements.\n\nSENIORS NOTE: later in the year there will be opportunities for seniors to be exempt from ACE by meeting certain school determined criteria. Please be on the lookout for more information regarding what these requirements are, how a student can become eligible, when it will begin, and what it means to be exempt from ACE. Until that time, all students are required to attend their assigned ACE every day, like any other class.\n\nWHEN CAN I SEE MY SCHEDULE?\n\nWelcome to the 2024-2025 School year from your PHS Counselors!

For a total of…\n\n42 whole blood donations &\n\n2 double red donations!\n\nThank you so much for hosting your blood drive!!\n\nOut of the 46 units collected = up to 132 lives will be saved from your blood drive!!

While I email these every month (and weekly to the ELA teacher), these emails can get caught in spam filters or old email addresses. The good news is that you have access to these accounts. Visit the Library’s website under the Services tab on the PHS website or just click here:https://bit.ly/PHSfines\n\nIf your student has a fine, but you didn’t receive an email notice, please check that your student’s Contact info is correct (changes in Skyward do not always transfer over).\n\nPlease note, that if the lost book is returned—the fine will be deleted!!! PHS can process books from other PfISD campuses for you.\n\nA Note about ID cards. State Law requires secondary students to visibly display their ID while on campus. It is PHS policy to issue a Temporary Paper ID when a student does not have a plastic ID. The charge for this appears on the Library fines as “Temporary IDs”.\n\nLauralee Owen\n\nPflugerville HS Librarian\n\nTLA Maverick Committee\n\n512-594-0571\n\nLibrary Website\n\nSPIRIT WEEK NEXT WEEK IN HONOR OF MS.
