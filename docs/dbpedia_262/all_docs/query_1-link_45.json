        "text": "BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is decreasing in most countries. While socioeconomic development is the main factor to which this decline has been attributed, enormous differences among countries and within regions are still observed, with the main contributing factors remaining elusive. This study describes the geographic distribution of gastric cancer mortality at a municipal level in Spain, from 1994-2003. METHODS: Smoothed relative risks of stomach cancer mortality were obtained, using the Besag-York-Molliè autoregressive spatial model. Maps depicting relative risk (RR) estimates and posterior probabilities of RR being greater than 1 were plotted. RESULTS: From 1994-2003, 62184 gastric cancer deaths were registered in Spain (7 percent of all deaths due to malignant tumors). The geographic pattern was similar for both sexes. RRs displayed a south-north and coast-inland gradient, with lower risks being observed in Andalusia, the Mediterranean coastline, the Balearic and Canary Islands ...\n\nDeath rates from lung cancer in men are higher in Andalusia than in other Spanish regions. This study describes lung cancer mortality rates and their trends in Andalusia from 1975 through 2008. Data on lung cancer mortality were obtained from the Death Registry of Andalusia. For each gender, age group-specific and standardized (overall and truncated) rates were calculated by the direct method using the world standard population. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify points where a significant change in trends occurred. In men, short-term trends for age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) declined significantly from 2004 through 2008 for each age group P P"
