        "text": "SECTION: A. EVALUATION AND SELECTION OF MEDICINES\n\n#11\n\nOff-label use of rituximab in patients with different types of nephropathies in a tertiary hospital: A retrospective study\n\nCarla Sans Pola, Antònia Agustí Escasany1,2,3, Josep Àngel Bosch Gil1,2, Irene Agraz Pamplona1, Carmen Alerany Pardo1 and Immaculada Danés Carreras1,2,3\n\n1Vall d'Hebron Hospital Universitari, Barcelona, Spain; 2Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; 3Vall d'Hebron Institut de Recerca, Barcelona, Spain\n\nObjective: Off-label use of rituximab is commonly requested for patients with resistant nephropathies. The outcomes and tolerability of rituximab in adult patients with nephropathy treated at our hospital (from 2013 to 2018) were described.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Response was classified as complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or no response (NR) according to the KDIGO criteria.\n\nResults: A total of 89 requests were received for 61 patients during the study period. Median age was 58 years (45.9% female). Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN) (n = 30) was the most frequent indication, followed by minimal change disease (MCD) (n = 15) and secondary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) (n = 12). Three patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) were included. After most treatment cycles in MN, a CR or PR was observed; median proteinuria levels significantly decreased for these patients (6000 mg/24 h (IQR 3584–10,300) vs. 1468.8 (IQR 500–4604.25), p < 0.01). In MPGN, no response was documented after 46.7% of rituximab cycles. A CR or PR was described with the majority of rituximab cycles in MCD, with a significant decrease in proteinuria (6000 mg/24 h (IQR 4007–11,426) vs. 196.8 (IQR 100–1300), p = 0.013). No cycles produced a response in FSGS. Mean CD19+ B-cell decreased in all types of nephropathy (10.44% vs. 0.29%, p < 0.0001). Eleven patients presented infusion-related reactions, and 17 presented infectious complications.\n\nConclusions: The majority of patients with MN and MCD had complete or partial responses; however, neither MPGN nor FSGS had encouraging results. These results were published in: J. Clin. Med. 2021, 10, 4941. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10214941\n\n#12\n\nReal-world observational study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with baricitinib or tofacitinib in a tertiary hospital\n\nElena Guillen Benitez, Mònica Sabaté Gallego, Elena Ballarin Alins, Esther Espartal Lopez, Maria Lopez Lasanta, Montserrat Bosch Ferrer, Nuria Artilagas Boixareu, Carmen Alerany Pardo and Immaculada Danés Carreras\n\nHospital Universitario Vall d'Hebrón, Barcelona, Spain\n\nObjective: To describe, in clinical practice, the use and line of treatment of two JAK inhibitors in patients from Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (VHUH) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) included at the Register of Patients and Treatments (RPT).\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Our study included patients who started treatment with baricitinib or tofacitinib for RA between September 2017 (commercialization date) and November 2019. Data were extracted from patients' medical records and RPT. A descriptive analysis was performed with REDCap and SPSS software.\n\nResults: Out of 58 patients, 39 met inclusion criteria. The median time of follow-up was 302 days (IQR: 91–502). Most were women (89.7%), with a median age of 56 years (IQR: 29–72), disease duration of 15 years (IQR: 20–8) and 79.5% had one or more comorbidities. Twenty-three patients (59%) had high disease activity (DAS-28 score) at baseline, 15 (38.5%) moderate and one (2.5%) low. Twenty-eight patients were prescribed tofacitinib, 7 baricitinib and 4 received both sequentially. All patients had previously received at least one conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD), including methotrexate in all cases, and 31 (79.5%) at least one biological DMARD (bDMARD), mainly etanercept (23). In 15 patients (36%) disease activity improved at the end of the study period. Treatment was withdrawn in nine patients: five due to lack of efficacy, two to toxicity (one case of abdominal pain and pustules and another case of anaemia) and two because of surgery. Eleven adverse events were observed in 5 patients who had received tofacitinib, mostly gastrointestinal and skin disorders. None was severe or life-threatening.\n\nConclusions: All patients treated with JAK inhibitors had previously received csDMARD, including methotrexate and four out of five at least one bDMARD. Although disease activity improved in less than half of the patients, our study included patients with more advanced disease than those included in clinical trials. Adverse effects were rare and mostly mild.\n\n#22\n\nOff-label use of tocilizumab in a tertiary hospital\n\nEmilie Anderssen Nordahl1, Montserrat Bosch Ferrer1, Cristina Hortalà Bas2, Antònia Agustí Escasany1, Carme Alerany Pardo3, Maria Villar Casares4 and Immaculada Danés Carreras1\n\n1Clinical Pharmacology Service, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain; 2Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; 3Pharmacy Service, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain; 4Internal Medicine Service, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain\n\nObjective: To describe the indications and clinical evidence for which off-label tocilizumab was requested and assess the clinical response of the patients at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (VHUH).\n\nMaterial and/or methods: In this retrospective study, patients whose physicians requested the off-label use of tocilizumab between 2015 and 2020 at VHUH were included. Information on the patient's demographic and clinical characteristics, diseases and outcomes were extracted from patients' medical records. Evidence for the efficacy of tocilizumab in each disease was reviewed. A descriptive analysis was performed (RStudio v.1.3.1093).\n\nResults: A total of 51 patients were included. The median age was 50.1 years (IQR 37–63); 66.7% were female. They had received a median of 2 previous treatments (IQR 1–3) for the target disease and maintained a median of 2 concomitant treatments (IQR 0–2). Lack of response to previous treatments was the main reason for off-label use (82.4%). Tocilizumab was requested for 17 diseases grouped into ophthalmic pathologies (14), vasculitis (12), rejection related diseases (12), arthritis (2), secondary amyloidosis (3), idiopathic autoimmune disorders (5) and miscellaneous (3). In 42 cases (82.4%) the level of evidence of tocilizumab efficacy was high (clinical trials/cohort studies). The short-term outcome (3 months) showed some response in 56.8% of patients, with a complete response in 23 (45.1%); 12 (23.5%) were non-assessable. At 6 months, a complete response was observed in 25 patients (49.0%). The best outcomes were described in patients with vasculitis and ophthalmic pathologies. Adverse effects were reported in 11.8% of patients.\n\nConclusions: Off-label tocilizumab was mainly requested for ophthalmic, vasculitis and rejection related diseases, mainly due to the lack of clinical response to previous treatments. Observed outcomes in addition to published studies can be helpful for future decisions, especially in patients with vasculitis and ophthalmic pathologies, where a better response was observed.\n\n#32\n\nTrends in out-of-hospital anticoagulation in Spain: 2012 to 2021\n\nAntonio Gómez Outes, Ana Téllez Torres, Celia Xiomara Bonkanka Tabares, Maria José Aguilella Vizcaino, Ana Martín Leal and Ma Luisa Suárez Gea\n\nAgencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS), Madrid, Spain\n\nObjective: To describe the trends in use and costs of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) [vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC)] in Spain over the last 10 years.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Drug use data were extracted from the “Observatorio del Uso de Medicamentos” (https://www.aemps.gob.es) and were expressed as the defined daily doses (DDD) per 1.000 inhabitants and day (DHD). Patients exposed to OAT were calculated using DHD and population registry data from the National Institute of Statistics (https://www.ine.es). Costs of anticoagulation were based on exposed patients and cost per DDD calculated from public prices (retail price plus VAT, 2021) reported in the “Nomenclator” database of the Spanish Ministry of Health (https://www.mscbs.gob.es).\n\nResults: The overall rate of oral anticoagulation use increased by 2.2-fold times over the last 10 years [6.967 DHD in 2012 vs. 15.595 DHD in 2021]. The relative rate of VKA use decreased by 13.4% (6.528 DHD in 2012 vs. 5.653 DHD in 2021) but the relative rate of DOAC prescriptions increased by 23-fold (0.439 DHD in 2012 vs. 9.942 DHD in 2021). This corresponds to a 2.2-fold increase in patients on OAT [from 329 297 patients in 2012 (308.548 patients on VKA and 20.749 patients on DOAC) to 738 340 patients in 2021 (267.639 patients on VKA and 470 701 patients on DOAC)]. Looking at temporal trends, during 2019 DOAC surpassed VKA as the anticoagulants of choice. In 2021, DOAC accounted for 64% of OAT use while VKA accounted only for 36% of use. The anticoagulant pharmacy costs increased by 12-fold, from 44.62 million euros in 2012 (VKA 21.67 million vs. DOAC 22.95 million) to 535.35 in 2021 (VKA 18.87 million vs. DOAC 516.48 million).\n\nConclusions: The use and pharmacy costs of OAT have increased substantially over the last 10 years, and the DOAC are currently the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulants in Spain.\n\n#36\n\nMontelukast and COVID-19-related complications in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection: A population-based observational study\n\nFrancisco Mera Cordero1, Sara Bonet Monné2, Jesus Almeda Ortega1, Sara Contreras-Martos1, Dan Ouchi3, Maria Giner-Soriano3,4, Rosa Morros Pedrós3 and Betlem Salvador Gonzalez1\n\n1Unitat de Suport a la Recerca Costa de Ponent, Fundació Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atenció Primària de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Cornellà, Spain; 2Servei d'Atenció Primària Baix Llobregat Centre, Institut Català de la Salut, Cornellà, Spain; 3Fundació Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atenció Primària de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain; 4Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra (Cerdanyola del Vallès), Spain\n\nObjective: We explore the association between montelukast use and the risk of developing COVID-19 complications in people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Study based on electronic health records from the SIDIAP database, which includes 5,835,000 people in Catalonia (80% of total population). In a cohort of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (diagnosis registry, positive PCR and/or a serologic test or non-confirmed diagnosis or test along with a record of hospitalization, pneumonia and/or death related to COVID-19), we identified people on montelukast treatment (an active prescription or a prescription ending 90 days before the index date) (confirmed or suspected Covid register) from March to June 2020 (exposed group). The non-exposed to montelukast cohort was built by pairing cases in a 1:4 ratio based on gender and age at the time of infection. We obtained socioeconomic risk factors and active comorbidities in the two previous years, and concomitant drugs. The COVID-19-related severe events analysed were hospitalization, pneumonia, death or any of the previous outcomes. For each outcome, we fitted a conditional logistic regression model to estimate the odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval (OR; CI95%) associated with montelukast use. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee IDIAPJGol.\n\nResults: During the study period, there were 183 (6.67%) hospitalizations in the exposed group and 554 (6.09%) in the non-exposed group, 40 (1.46%) and 176 (1.93%) pneumonias, 85 (3.1%) and 429 (4.72%) deaths and 258 (9.40%) and 996 (10.95%) of any of the outcomes, respectively. The corresponding multivariable ORs were 0.92 (CI95% 0.70–1.21) for hospitalization, 0.67 (0.44–1.00) for pneumonia, 0.79 (0.60–1.031) for death and 0.79 (0.63–0.99) for any of the outcomes.\n\nConclusions: The results suggest that montelukast use could decrease the risk of complications in people with COVID-19.\n\n#76\n\nAntidepressants use in children and adolescents in Catalonia from 2008 to 2016. A cohort study from a primary care Catalonian database\n\nAna Garcia Sangenis1, A Inhoa Gomez Lumbreras1,2,3, Cristina Vedia Urgell4,1,2, Oriol Prat Vallverdú1 and Rosa Morros Pedrós1,2,4\n\n1Fundació Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atenció Primària de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain; 2Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Spain; 3College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacotherapy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA; 4Institut Català de la Salut, Barcelona, Spain\n\nObjective: To describe the incidence and use patterns of <18 years old antidepressant initiators in Catalonia.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Design: Population-based cohort study of children <18 years old in Catalonia from 2008 to 2016. Data source: SIDIAP, 80% of the Catalonia's population containing information on diagnoses and drugs. Cohort: initial users less than 18 years of any antidepressant drug (ATC group N06A) during the study period. Incident users are defined as having at least 1 antidepressant invoice without having any other antidepressant invoice the year before.\n\nResults: During the studied period, 25.727 children initiated an antidepressant treatment. The antidepressants use increases with age. Of the total antidepressants users, 6% corresponds to children in the 0–5 years old group, 20% in the 6–11, 25% in the 12–14 and 49% in the 15–17 years old group. Boys have a higher consumption in the age group 6–12 (63%) and girls in the 15–17 group (62%) but overall in ages is balanced (53% of the initiators were girls).\n\nTreatment duration shows no difference regarding sex, being shorter in the <6 years old group (mean 1.5 months, SD 2.3) than in the ≥6 years old groups (mean 7.5 months, SD 10.7). The 82% of the <6 year old children had only 1 invoice and 44% of the ≥6 years old.\n\nFluoxetine is the most used drug (31%) followed by sertraline (21%).\n\nFifty-two percent of the cohort received a concomitant treatment with another psychotropic drug while taking antidepressants, and 18% started another psychotropic treatment in the 6 months after the end of the antidepressant treatment. The most frequently concomitant treatments were anxiolytics and sedatives (N05B and N05C) and antipsychotics (N05A).\n\nConclusions: Antidepressants are used mostly in teenagers. Fluoxetine is the most used drug. There is high dropout rate after the first month of treatment. Anxiolytics and antipsychotics are the most used psychotropic concomitant treatments.\n\n#81\n\n“Study of the use of flumazenil in the patient with benzodiazepine overdose”\n\nAlejandro Francisco Jiménez Ortega1, Leonor Laredo Velasco1,2, Sergio Mosquera Ferrer1, Laura Galán Caballero1, Daniel Lozano Martín1, Oliver Astasio González1, Teresa Iglesias Hernángómez1, Lourdes Cabrera García1,2, Mar García Arenillas1,2 and Emilio Vargas Castrillón1,2\n\n1Servicio de Farmacología Clínica, Hospital Clínico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain; 2Depto. de Farmacología y Toxicología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain\n\nObjective: To quantify appropriate flumazenil prescriptions at the emergency department from 2019 to 2021 in the setting of benzodiazepine overdose and to assess the characteristics of the patients receiving flumazenil.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: A study was conducted including subjects aged 16 years and older. We consulted the emergency department database during the study period and selected a subset of patients with diagnosis of benzodiazepine overdose. The data were extracted from the electronic medical records using the emergency department application (SISU) and stored in an anonymized EXCEL database, on which statistical analyses was performed.\n\nResults: During the study period a subset of 30 patients were eligible for the study, as they were coded with a diagnosis of benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil was administered to 12 patients (40%). This is a high proportion compared to previous studies that set that proportion at around 6%. According to the prescription criteria, 66.7% of flumazenil prescriptions (eight patients) were considered not well indicated (inadequate prescriptions where those which deviated from the flumazenil SPC). This rate is higher than another published work, which found that 38% of prescriptions were not appropriate. The 33.3% (four patients) received 2 mg or more, this being the dose level at which re-evaluation of the patient is needed and flumazenil is only administered if resedation occurs. Concomitant alcohol intake was recorded in four patients who received flumazenil (two patients belonged to the inappropriate prescription group), which could lead to an increase of the risk of seizures following flumazenil administration.\n\nConclusions: In conclusion, we found a high proportion of prescriptions in which the patient may not benefit from the drug coupled with situations that could increase adverse drug reactions. It is necessary to implement an algorithm in emergency departments, maximizing therapeutic benefit while minimizing risks.\n\n#87\n\nComparative safety and effectiveness of tocilizumab, corticosteroids and combined therapy in SARS-COV2 infection\n\nIván Mazón Maraña1, Beatriz Alonso Gómez2, Andrea Bautista Blázquez2, David Valencia López2, Diana Zulema Cuellar Gómez2, Gorka Gaztelumendi Martín2, Ana Llorente Cantalapiedra2, Álvaro Cadenas Manceñido2, Lucía Lavin Alconero1, Celia González Samperio1, María Ángeles Pena Pardo2, Noelia Vega Gil2, Maria Ángeles Cos Cossio2, M. Blanca Sánchez Santiago2 and María Del Mar García Saiz2\n\n1Instituto de investigación sanitaria Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander, Spain; 2Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain\n\nObjective: Tocilizumab (T) and corticosteroids (C) were two of the drugs used to stop the hyperinflammatory state of critically ill patients at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study is to make a comparison of the efficacy and safety between the two drugs and the combination of both.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: All patients with SARS-COV2 infection from our centre during the first wave of the pandemic who had been treated with T, C or a combination of both (CT) were selected from the IDI-REM-2020-01 COVID-19 Registry (NCT04347278). A descriptive study was carried out with an assessment of survival, mean stay (MS) in Intensive care unit (ICU) and risk of co-infection for these treatments.\n\nResults: Of 86 patients (54 men/32 women), 29 received T (33.7%), 37 C (43.1%) and 20 TC (23.2%). Median age was 66 ± 14 years, increasing in C (71 ± 15) and decreasing in T (60 ± 12) and TC (67 ± 13). The 48.9% of the patients with T and TC were admitted to the ICU compared to 8.1% of the patients with C, data related to age criteria. The median MS in the ICU decreased in the CT group at 7(±4) days compared to the T group (15 ± 3). There was no difference between the three therapies for general hospitalization MS (21 ± 5.5 to 23 ± 5.3). The 55.2% of the patients treated with T and 30% treated with CT had co-infection compared to 21.6% of the patients treated with C. Finally, a Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed, verifying a trend to have a longer survival in patients treated with T and CT, compared to C, although without statistical significance (χ2: 0.161) by sample size.\n\nConclusions: CT appears to be more effective than T and C in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. These results support the limited literature; however, more powered studies will be required to evaluate these results.\n\n#88\n\nAssessing anticholinergic burden in community-dwelling older people\n\nEncarnación Blanco Reina1,2, Rafael Del Pino Castaño3, Lorena Aguilar Cano4, Mª. Rosa García Merino5, Inmaculada Bellido Estévez6,2 and Ricardo Ocaña Riola7,8\n\n1F. Medicina, Universidad de Málaga, Málaga, Spain; 2IBIMA, Málaga, Spain; 3Distrito AP Serranía, SAS, Málaga, Spain; 4Servicio Rehabilitación, Hospital Regional Universitario de Málaga, SAS, Málaga, Spain; 5Distrito AP Málaga-Guadalhorce, SAS, Málaga, Spain; 6F. medicina, Universidad de Málaga, Málaga, Spain; 7Escuela Andaluza de Salud Pública, Granada, Spain; 8Instituto de Investigación Biosanitaria ibs. GRANADA, Granada, Spain\n\nObjective: Anticholinergic burden, the cumulative effect of anticholinergic medications, is associated with adverse outcomes in older people. The aims of this study were to assess the anticholinergic burden in community-dwelling older people, as well as to characterize the profile of drugs involved.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: We performed a cross-sectional study. The participants met the following inclusion criteria: aged 65 years or more, registered in the database of the Spanish NHS and belonging to the outpatient setting. All participants provided informed consent to take part in the study. Patients were recruited at 12 primary healthcare centres by using stratified random sampling. Sociodemographic, clinical functional (and comprehensive drug therapy data were compiled). Data were obtained for the medication prescribed (indication, dosage and duration of treatment during the last 3 months or more). Anticholinergic drug exposure was measured by the Drug Burden Index (DBI).\n\nResults: We included a total of 582 patients, with a mean age of 73.1 years. Each patient presented 7.8 diagnoses on average. The most prevalent chronic conditions were bone and joint disorders (75.3%), hypertension (70.9%) and dyslipidaemia (51.7%). Some form of psychopathology (mainly anxiety and/or depression) was present in 36% of the patient. Each patient consumed on average 6.8 drugs, resulting in a polymedication prevalence of 68.6%. A total of n = 3626 prescriptions have been analysed. The patients received an average of 1.28 (±1.3; range 0–7) anticholinergic drugs. The 58.1% of the patients receive anticholinergic drugs (36.6% moderate and 21.5% high risk). The ATC groups most involved were N and C, and the drugs most associated were amitriptyline, hydroxyzine, trimipramine, tolterodine, paroxetine and quetiapine.\n\nConclusions: The use of drugs with a high anticholinergic burden is frequent. Taking into account its association with delirium and functional and cognitive impairment, it would be necessary to be concerned about this risk and to evaluate the treatment's appropriateness.\n\nSECTION: B.

EudraCT Number: 2020-005026-28.\n\nResults: 127 hospitalized patients, diagnosed with acute-phase SARS-CoV-2 infection and non-critical RF, were recruited between January and August 2021. The mean age was 59.5 years and 66.14% were male. The 93.70% were in stage 5 disease according to WHO criteria and 6.30% in stage 4. There were 55 serious adverse events (SAEs) (32 patients, 78% men) and 7 of them (12.7%) were considered serious adverse reactions (SARs), all of them expected. Six patients died (three in the methylprednisolone group). Of these seven SARs, two (28.5%) belonged to the methylprednisolone group, all in men (mean age 67.5 years) and none resulted in death. The classification by organ and system (SOC) of the registered 55 AEs and SAEs, was as follows: 5 vascular disorders cases (methylprednisolone arm: 2), 21 respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders cases (methylprednisolone arm: 12), 2 gastrointestinal disorders cases (methylprednisolone arm: 0), 1 nervous system disorders case (methylprednisolone arm), 26 infections and infestations cases (methylprednisolone arm: 13) and 1 cardiac disorders case no related with methylprednisolone. For the seven adverse reactions reported, the classification by SOC was as follows: one infections and infestations case and one gastrointestinal disorders case no related with methylprednisolone and five vascular disorders cases (methylprednisolone arm: 2).\n\nConclusions: Based on the results obtained, there is no evidence of safety risks associated with high-dose methylprednisolone bolus versus intermediate-dose dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 with non-critical respiratory failure.\n\n#7\n\nImpact during SARS-COV-2 pandemic in a regional pharmacovigilance centre\n\nIgnacio García Giménez1, Natalia Ramos Pardillo2, Nieves Merino Kolly3 and Mercedes Ruiz Pérez3\n\n1Servicio de Farmacia. Hospital Juan Ramón Jiménez, Huelva, Spain; 2Servicio de Farmacología Clínica. Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío, Sevilla, Spain; 3Centro Andaluz de Farmacovigilancia, Sevilla, Spain\n\nObjective: To analyse the impact of a pandemic on the number and profile of notifications received at a pharmacovigilance centre.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: An observational and retrospective study was performed. Data collected from FEDRA database (SAR spanish database) from the first semester of the years 2019, 2020 and 2021: number and severity of reports, profile of reporter (physician, pharmacist, nurse, citizen, other), age and sex of the patient, SOC (System Organ Class) classification of SAR reported, ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) (2nd level) classification of the drug associated with SAR reported.\n\nResults:\n\nNumber of notifications [2019][2020][2021]: [395]; [295]; [3295]. Percent increase in 2021 compared with [2019] [2020]: [734%][1016%].\n\nSevere notifications [2019][2020][2021]: [184]; [181]; [979]. Percent increase in 2021 compared with [2019] [2020]: [432%][441%].\n\nProfile of reporter [2019][2020][2021]: Physician: [145][128][854]; Pharmacist: [136][56][200]; Nurse:[6][8][425]; Citizen:[87][70][1631]; Others:[41][41][280]. Percent increase in 2021 compared with [2019] [2020]: Nurse [6983%][5212%], Citizen [1774%][2230%].\n\nMedian age in years [2019][2020][2021]: [56 (1–92)], [55 (1–91)], [43 (1–98)].\n\nSex of patients (n) [2019][2020][2021]: [female (212)], [female (156)], [female (2466)].\n\n3 most reported SOC (n): 2019: Gastrointestinal disorders (104), General disorders and administration site conditions (100), Nervous system disorders (91); 2020: Nervous system disorders (78), General disorders and administration site conditions (72), Gastrointestinal disorders (67); 2021: General disorders and administration site conditions (3293), Nervous system disorders (1800), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (1218).\n\n3 most reported ATC subgroups: 2019: J01 (43), L04 (32), C10/B01/L01 (28); 2020: L01 (40), A10 (32), B01 (28); 2021: J07 (3335), L01 (43), L04 (37).\n\nConclusions: The number of SAR reported has risen, especially those reported by citizens, maybe due to an increase of the population's interest in the medication (J07: vaccines) they were receiving because of the media coverage of the pandemic. A quality health education provided to the population could lead to a better quantification of the possible risks associated with the use of medication.\n\n#15\n\nLate adverse events in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma after CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy\n\nLina Camacho Arteaga1, Lina María Leguízamo Martínez1, Francesca Filippi Arriaga1, Gloria Iacoboni Garcia-Calvo1, Carla Alonso Martínez1, Xavier Vidal Guitart1, Lucia López Corral2, Estefania Pérez López2, Mi Kwon3, Rebeca Bailén Almorox3, Rafael Hernani Morales4, Manuel Guerreiro5, Maria Pilar Maiquez Asuero6, Pere Barba Suñol1 and Antónia Agustí Escasany1\n\n1Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain; 2Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; 3Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañon, Madrid, Spain; 4Hospital Clínico Universitario, Valencia, Spain; 5Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain; 6Hospital Virgen del Rocío, Sevilla, Spain\n\nObjective: To describe the occurrence of selected late AEs in adult patients treated with CD19 CAR-T cells for the approved indications in the real-word setting.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: An observational, multicentre study of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma treated with tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) was carried out in six Spanish hospitals from September 2018 and November 2021. Adults (>18 years) who had survived at least 3 months after infusion and had not received any additional treatment for their disease were included. Baseline characteristics, the distribution of AEs by age and disease status, and the incidence rate of AEs were analysed.\n\nResults: A total of 78 patients were included, 53 treated with axi-cel and 25 with tisa-cel, with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 55 (71%), followed by transformed follicular lymphoma 14 (18%). The median follow-up was 9.1 months (range 3–24). At the data cutoff, 62 (79.5%) continued in the study, 5 (6.4%) completed the maximum follow-up and 8 (10.3%) were withdrawn due to disease progression. The most frequent AEs were neutropenia (n = 34, 2.01 per-1000 p-d), hypogammaglobulinemia (n = 35, 1.91 per-1000 p-d), infections (n = 19, 0.85 per-1000 p-d), dermatological complications (n = 5, 0.21 per-1000 p-d) and cardiac events (n = 4, 0.16 per-1000 p-d). Thrombocytopenia was more frequent in patients older than 65 years of age (p = 0.040). There were no statistical differences in the frequency of AEs according to the response to the previous treatment.\n\nConclusions: The most frequent late AEs after CAR T-cell therapy were neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Thrombocytopenia was more frequent in patients older than 65 years.\n\n#21\n\nAnalysis and establishment of improvement lines in under-reporting of adverse drug reactions at Virgen Del Rocío Hospital (Seville)\n\nCarmen María Jiménez Martín1, Inmaculada Alonso Araujo2, Natalia Ramos Pardillo1, Elena Pérez López1 and Antonio Cervera Barajas3\n\n1Unidad de Gestión Clínica de Farmacología Clínica, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain; 2Enfermera. Secretaria Comisión de Seguridad Clínica, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain; 3Enfermero. Unidad de Calidad, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain\n\nObjective: To enhance the reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Identify and analyse the causes of under-reporting of ADRs. To establish improvement lines based on the analysis carried out.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: A six questions survey with a drop-down list of multiple-choice answers was divulged among the hospital's healthcare workers (HCWs): Do you know the pharmacovigilance reporting system?, Do you know the yellow card for reporting ADR?, Have you ever reported an ADR?, How often do you report ADR?, Do you think it is compulsory to report ADR?. There is, generally very low reporting by HCWs, if this is your case, why do you think this is due to?\n\nResults: A total of 250 professionals from 38 medical units participated; the highest participation was nursing (55%), followed by physicians (26%) and healthcare assistant (19%). Twenty-two percent were residents, the most frequent from the medical area (76%). Seventy-two percent were aware of the pharmacovigilance system, 65% were aware of the yellow card. However, only 30% had reported. Physicians were the most aware of the system and had reported the most, followed by nurses, with a statistically significant difference. Ninety-three percent were aware that it is mandatory, with no significant differences between the different professionals. The most frequent reasons for underreporting were lack of information (52%), lack of training (44%), lack of time (26%) and difficulty of access (12%). In view of the results, an online training session was held by the clinical pharmacology unit in which 180 professionals participated and it was implemented for notification a web-link in the intranet's hospital.\n\nConclusions: Pharmacovigilance activities and training of hospital's healthcare workers in therapeutics and clinical pharmacology are among the most relevant initiatives to improve safety in the use of medicines and thus ensure safer patient care.\n\n#23\n\nPharmacovigilance of CAR-T therapy at Virgen del Rocío University Hospital\n\nElena María Pérez López1, Pilar Maiquez Asuero1, Ana Melcón De Dios2, Jorge Navarro Roldán1, Luis Miguel Calderón López1, Juan Luis Reguera Ortega1 and Jaime Torelló Iserte1\n\n1Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío, Sevilla, Spain; 2Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain\n\nObjective: (1) To evaluate the safety profile of CAR-T drugs under real world clinical practice. (2) To describe the characteristics of the reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Prospective systematic supervision of ADRs found in the cohort of patients treated with CAR-T drugs carried out by the Clinical Pharmacology Service and identified through the Hospital Subcommittee of innovative medicines CAR-T. Reporting of suspected ADRs to the Andalusian Pharmacovigilance Center. ADRs were coding according to MedDRA classification and imputability criteria according to the modified Karch-Lasagna algorithm.\n\nResults: ADRs have been reported in 58 (62%) of the 93 patients treated, being 98% of them serious ADRs cases (2% fatal; 10% life-threatening). Median age = 51 years (range: 4–74); 60% men. Latency period: median = 3 days; IQR: 2–5; ≤4 days (73%). The drugs involved were axicabtagene ciloleucel (n = 31) and tisagenlecleucel (n = 27). Within the 244 ADRs reported in the 58 patients (mean = 4.2 ADR/patient), the main ones were: disorders of the immune system (24%), nervous system (19%), blood (15%), general/local reactions on site of administration (10%) and psychiatric (9%); being the most frequent preferred terms (PT): cytokine release syndrome, neutropenia, pyrexia, neurotoxicity/neurotoxicity syndrome associated with immune effector cells, thrombocytopenia and hypotension. Among the most frequent PT, it is worth highlighting a higher proportion of neutropenia associated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (58%) than with tisagenlecleucel (22%); RR = 2.6 (1.2–5.6).\n\nConclusions: Results show that the safety profile of CAR-T drugs used under real world clinical practice in our hospital is consistent with that known in clinical trials, being also similar for both drugs. However, it has been found that axicabtagene ciloleucel would be associated more often to neutropenia.\n\n#24\n\nAdherence to the recommendations of the pregnancy prevention program for valproate\n\nCristina Aguilera Martin1,2,3, Maria Paula Avila Garcia4, Eduard Diogène Fadini1,2,3 and Antònia Agustí Escasany1,2,3\n\n1Clinical Pharmacology Service, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Vall d'Hebron Barcelona Hospital Campus, Barcelona, Spain; 2Department of Pharmacology, Therapeutics and Toxicology, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra-Barcelona, Spain; 3Immunomediated Diseases and Innovative Therapies Group, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain; 4Department of Pharmacology, Fundación universitaria de ciencias de la salud (FUCS), Bogota, Colombia\n\nObjective: To analyse whether the recommendations of the Pregnancy Prevention Program for valproate (PPEV) issued by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products are met.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Women from 11 to 55 years with a valproate prescription from June 2018 to June 2019 were selected. Data were obtained from the Community Medication Plan of patients treated at a tertiary hospital and patients' medical records. Those with menopause, hysterectomy, or sterility/infertility were excluded. The main variable was the percentage of patients who had all the PPEV measures implemented.\n\nResults: Seventy-five out of 88 patients with a valproate prescription were included (median age of 27 years) (IQR: 17–43). The main indications were the treatment of seizures (57, 76%) and psychiatric disorders (11, 14.7%). In no case were all the PPEV measures implemented. Valproate was prescribed only when no alternatives were available in 47 (62.8%) patients. The risks of valproate were reported to 28 (37.3%) patients. Only 45 patients (60%) were annually assessed by the specialist. Eighteen out of 63 patients (28.6%) with menarche were informed of the need for effective contraception. A pregnancy test was performed before and during treatment in only 3 (4.8%) and 4 (6.3%) patients, respectively, and 11 (17.5%) signed the informed consent. In only one out of two patients who manifested gestational desire, was valproate treatment removed and, in another case an unscheduled pregnancy occurred that resulted in a healthy newborn.\n\nConclusions: Valproate is still prescribed in women of childbearing age as a first-line drug. There is little information in medical records about the risks from valproate and the need for contraception. Although 60% of patients have at least an annual follow-up, few pregnancy tests are performed and the informed consent is rarely signed. The evaluation of the implementation of PPEV recommendations suggests that additional measures are necessary.\n\n#29\n\nResults in rheumatology of the EPAS-FAMEB study: Post-authorization study to evaluate the safety of biological DMARDs\n\nSamuel Hidalgo Rios1, Natalia Ramos Pardillo1, Jaime Torelló Iserte1, Carmen María Jiménez Martín1, Pilar Maiquez Asuero1 and Pura Clara Aguilera Cros2\n\n1Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio. Farmacología Clínica, Sevilla, Spain; 2Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio. Cirugía Ortopédica, Traumatología y Reumatología, Sevilla, Spain\n\nObjective: To determine the incidence, nature and seriousness of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) which under real conditions of use, cause withdrawal for safety reasons, during the first 12–24 months after initiation of biological DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs used in Rheumatology.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Retrospective cohorts study at Virgen del Rocío University Hospital. We carried out a systematic review of digital medical records of patients who throughout 2018 initiated treatment with biological or synthetic DMARDs and who were not continuing with same treatment in the last quarter of 2019. Suspected ADRs were reported to the Andalusian Pharmacovigilance Center. ADRs were coded according to MedDRA classification and the modified Karch-Lasagna algorithm was applied for the imputability criteria. Results are corresponding to the use of these drugs in Rheumatology.\n\nResults: The median age of the 82 patients with rheumatological indications was 52 years, and 79% were women. The main indications were rheumatoid arthritis (59%), psoriatic arthritis (15%) and ankylosing spondylitis (13%). Of the 14 medications prescribed for rheumatological indications, the most frequently identified were baricitinib, rituximab and sarilumab in RA, secukinumab in PAs; secukinumab and tofacitinib in AS. A 12% off-label use was observed. Twenty-three percent of the withdrawals were due to safety reasons and 21% due to lack of efficacy. Thirty-seven ADRs were detected in 22 patients. The most important ADRs were infectious (n = 9) and immunologic (n = 5). The most frequently implicated drugs were rituximab (n = 12) and tofacitinib, sarilumab and secukinumab with four cases each.\n\nConclusions: The proportion of withdrawals due to ADR and the nature and incidence of ADRs are consistent with those found in clinical trials and/or observational studies carried out with this type of drugs.\n\n#30\n\nRates of brain bleed and clinical worse in anticoagulated or anti-aggregated patients with mild head injury: High safety\n\nJuan José Martínez Rivas1, Fernando Rodriguez Lucas1, Gemma Planells1 and Denis Corrales2\n\n1Hospital de Granollers, Granollers, Spain; 2Hospital de granollers, Granollers, Spain\n\nObjective: Mild head injury (MHI) is one of the most common reasons to visit emergency rooms; however, the handling of said injury is controversial. Our objective was to evaluate the rate of cerebral haemorrhage (HIC) and clinical worsening in the first 3 months after MHI in patients without treatment compared to those treated with anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively over 3 years from all MHI treated or not with antiplatelet or anticoagulated, evaluated in our emergency room. All cases, a 3-month follow-up was performed. Low-impact trauma, without loss of consciousness, and a Glasgow scale score ≥13 at admission was defined as MHI. The presence of intracranial haemorrhage was assessed with a cranial CT at admission, 24 h and 3 months after the event. We consider a symptomatic ICH to be one with clinical worsening.\n\nResults: We evaluated 897 patients with a mean age of 73.2 ± 19.92 years, 50.6% women, 96.3% was 15 points of Glasgow score. Thirty percent were being treated with antiplatelet agents (25% ASA, 5% clopidogrel, 0.1% Ticagrelol), 30% with anticoagulants agents (24% Acenocumarol, 5% Apixaban, 1%Rivaroxaban, 0.3% Dabigatran and Edoxaban respectively) and 40% of the remaining population without drugs. Cerebral haemorrhage was detected in 97 patients of the total population, 95 were detected at admission, 1 in the first 24 h and 1 patient between the first 24 h and 3 month after the MHI. Table 1. The 50% of ICH did not receive any drugs, 27% AAS, 14% Acenocumarol, 5% Clopidogrel and 4% Apixaban. No patient without HIC on admission suffered subsequent haemorrhage or neurological deterioration, regardless of the initial Glasgow or INR.\n\nConclusions: The data suggest that MHI patients without visible IHC can be safely discharged without an observation period, regardless of whether or not they receive treatment with anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.\n\n#31\n\nPneumonia associated with SARS-COV2 infection in vaccinated patients\n\nConsuelo María Rodríguez Jiménez1,2, Carlos Boada Fernández Del Campo1, Carmen Velazquez Perélló1, Patricia Rodríguez Fortúnez3, Jaime Leonardo Rolingson Landaeta1, Fernando Hidalgo Figuerola1, Candelaria Grillo1 and Emilo Sanz Álvarez1,2\n\n1Hospital Universitario de Canarias, La Laguna, Spain; 2Departamento de Medicina Física y Farmacología, Universidad de La Laguna, La Laguna, Spain; 3Hospital Universitario de Canarias. UICEC, La Laguna, Spain\n\nObjective: To describe the elapsed time between vaccination against SARS-COV2 and development of COVID19 pneumonia. To analyse the relation between COVID19 pneumonia and the time between doses as well as with patient profile.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study of patients diagnosed with COVID19 pneumonia and correctly vaccinated who have been notified to SEFV-h. The search for cases was carried out using the FEDRA 3 application between January and September 2021.\n\nResults: 99 cases of pneumonia in correctly vaccinated patients were identified; of these, 75 were vaccinated with Comirnaty, 12 with Janssen, 9 with Vaxzevria and 3 with Spikevax. Fifty-seven percent of pneumonias occurred 60 to 129 days after vaccination with a maximum ranging from 90 to 99 days (median 96). For analysis of the time between doses, the 87 cases that required two doses to complete vaccination schedule were considered. Nine of them had more than 2 months between doses, while 78 had less than 1 month (in 54% of the 87 cases 21 days had passed). There was no apparent association with the frequency of developing pneumonia. Thirty-seven percent were women and 60% men. To assess age, the cases were distributed by decade. Thus, the age group >79 had the highest number of cases (52), while the groups 60–69 and 70–79 comprised 18 cases each. The least cases were in the remaining groups: 8 (50–59), 2 (40–49) and 1 (30–39). There was none in the lower age groups.\n\nConclusions: The data indicate that most cases of vaccine failure with severe disease occur 3 months after vaccination. Compared to pre-vaccination data collected from other sources, a decrease in severe cases was observed, with unchanged patient profile in terms of age and sex.\n\n#33\n\nSuspected adverse reactions to drugs used to treat COVID-19: A descriptive study\n\nDolores Rodriguez Cumplido, Pilar Ordoñez Rufat, Roser Llop Rius, Sebastian Videla Ces, Aurema Otero Gonzalez, Thiago Carnaval, Natalia Pallarès Fontanet, Esther Garcia Lerma and Pilar Hereu Boher\n\nHospital Universitari de Bellvitge, Barcelona, Spain\n\nObjective: To describe the suspected adverse reactions (SADRs) associated with drugs used to treat COVID-19.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: This is an observational, retrospective study of SADRs identified by the Bellvitge Hospital Pharmacovigilance Program (PFVHUB). All patients admitted and treated with specific drugs for COVID-19, from 10 to 28 March 2020 were included. Data were collected regarding patients' characteristics, medications and suspected ADRs. Information was obtained from clinical records.\n\nResults: A total of 760 patients were included, out of which 95 (12.5%) presented 105 SADRs, being 176 drugs implicated. The mean age was 65 years old and 470 (62%) were men. From a total of 677 (89%) patients with pneumonia, 251 (37%) were considered severe. There were 161 (21.2%) deaths. The medication administered was: hydroxychloroquine (737 [97%]), ritonavir/lopinavir combination (542 [71%]), beta-Interferon (196 [25.8%]), tocilizumab (114 [15%]) and remdesivir (9 [1.2%]). The most frequent SADRs were: diarrhoea (55 [52.4%]), QT lengthening (18 [17%]), hepatitis (7 [6.7%]), nausea (5 [4.7%]) and acute renal failure (3 [2.8%]). Regarding the 95 patients with suspected ADRs, median age was 61.5 years and 54 (57.4%) were men; 89 (94%) had pneumonia; and 24 (27%) cases were severe. There was no case of SADR-related death. In 65 cases (63%) the drug was withdrawn. Recovery was achieved in 97 (92.4%) cases, with a median duration until recovery of 4 days (IQR 2–7). According to the causality algorithm of the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System, causality was deemed probable for 139 (79%) of the drugs involved.\n\nConclusions: SADRs correspond to the known risk profile of the drugs used. Although the majority of cases recovered in approximately 4 days, more than half of the cases required the medication to be withdrawn.\n\n#34\n\nSuspected adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines in a university hospital: A descriptive analysis\n\nDolores Rodriguez Cumplido, Pilar Ordoñez Rufat, Roser Llop Rius, Sebastian Videla Ces, Aurema Otero Gonzalez, Thiago Carnaval and Pilar Hereu Boher\n\nHospital Universitari de Bellvitge, Barcelona, Spain\n\nObjective: To describe the COVID-19 vaccine-related suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) reported to the Catalan Pharmacovigilance Center (CFVC) by the Bellvitge Hospital Pharmacovigilance Program (PFVHUB).\n\nMaterial and/or methods: This is an observational, retrospective study of suspected ADRs not stated in the Summary of Product Characteristics at the time of authorization and reported between January and October 2021. Suspected ADRs, both in healthcare professionals or their patients, were identified through spontaneous notifications made by these professionals themselves. Information was collected on patients' characteristics, adverse events, type of vaccine administered, severity, outcome and degree of accountability.\n\nResults: In total, 920 suspected ADRs were reported (894 in healthcare professionals and 26 in patients). Of these, 42 suspected ADRs among professionals were reported to the CFVC and 24 among patients. The mean age was 46.6 years, 70% were in women and 7 cases had COVID-19 previously. In 56% of the cases, the suspected ADR occurred after the first dose and in 5 cases it happened once again after the second dose. In 55 (83%) cases, the administered vaccine was Comirnaty®. The most frequent suspected ADRs were herpes zoster and simplex, oral fungal infection, paresthesia, pruritic rash, urticaria, myocarditis/pericarditis, thrombosis, cytolytic hepatitis, facial paralysis, flu-like syndrome, vertigo and thoracoepigastric vein phlebitis. In 88% of the cases, the median duration of the ADR until recovery was of 7 days (IQR 2–15). According to the causality algorithm of the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System, causality was probable or possible in 89% of the cases.\n\nConclusions: Suspected ADRs identified by means of the PFVHUB have contributed to improve the knowledge regarding the toxicity profile of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n#35\n\nNSAIDs, analgesics and antiplatelet drugs and kidney function decline: A case control study\n\nSara Bonet Monné1, Betlem Salvador Gonzalez2, María José Pérez Sáez3, Cristina Vedia Urgell4, Julio Pascual Santos5, José Miguel Baena Díez6, Oriol Cunillera Puertolás7, Jordi Rodríguez Ruiz8 and Rosa Morros Pedrós8\n\n1Servei Atenció Primària Baix Llobregat Centre, Institut Català de la Salut, Barcelona, Spain; 2Unitat de Suport a la Recerca, Direcció d'Atenció Primària Costa de Ponent, Institut Català de la Salut, Cornellà, Spain; 3Institución Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain; 4Institut Català de la Salut, Badalona, Spain; 5Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain; 6CAP la Marina, Institut Català de la Salut, Barcelona, Spain; 7Unitat de Suport a la Recerca, Direcció d'Atenció Primària Costa de Ponent, Institut Català de la Salut, Cornellà, España, Barcelona, Spain; 8Fundació Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atenció Pirmària de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain\n\nObjective: We aim to explore the association between NSAIDs consumption (non-selective or COX-2), SYSADOA, analgesics and antiplatelet drugs, and kidney function decline by estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR).\n\nMaterial and/or methods: We use SIDIAP database including 274 primary care teams in Catalonia (5,835,000 patients). A patient was a case, if had an eGFR value ≤45 ml/min/1.63 m2 in the period 2010–2015 with a previous eGFR value ≥60, and no eGFR ≥60 afterwards. Controls had an eGFR ≥60 with no previous eGFR <60. Five controls were selected for each case, matched by sex, age, Index Date, Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. The Odds Ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals (OR; 95%CI) of worsening eGFR was estimated adjusting with logistic regression models for drugs groups, by consumption (low, medium or high), measured in DDD.\n\nResults: There were n = 18 905 cases and n = 94 456 controls. Mean age was 77 years, 59% were women. The 89.6% cases and 78.1% controls had hypertension, and 55.5% and 37.3% diabetes mellitus, respectively. The multivariate adjusted model showed a decreasing risk for eGFR decline for NSAIDs (0.92;0.88–0.97), SYSADOA (0.87;0.83–0.91) and acetaminophen (0.84;0.79–0.89), and an increased risk for metamizole (1.07;1.03–1.12), and antiplatelet drugs (1.07;1.03–1.11). Within the groups, the reduced risk in AINEs was limited to propionic acid derivatives (PAD) (0.92; 0.88–0.96), whereas an increased risk was observed for high doses both in acetic acid derivatives (AAD) (1.09;1.03–1.15) and Coxibs (1.19;1.08–1.30). Medium and high use of major opioids conferred a coincident risk (1.15;1.03–1.29). The increased risk was maintained for ASS alone or combined, and triflusal. Triflusal showed risk at medium (1.23; 1.02–1.48) and high use (1.68;1.40–2.01).\n\nConclusions: PAD seem safer than AAD and COX-2 on eGFR. Further studies are necessary to confirm the worsening effect observed for metamizole, major opioids and antiplatelet agents (triflusal, and AAS). As limitation, we cannot rule out a possible confounding bias associated with drug indication.\n\n#38\n\nManagement of acetaminophen poisoning in the emergency room of a tertiary care hospital in Spain\n\nAntonio Francisco Caballero Bermejo1, Aránzazu Sancho López1, Almudena Ramírez García1, Raquel García Hernández2, Philippe Calpe Delgado2, Jordi Puiguriguer Ferrando3 and Concepción Payares Herrera1\n\n1Clinical Pharmacology Department, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda.

Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro-Segovia de Arana., Madrid, Spain; 3Clinical Toxicology Unit. Emergency Department, Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Palma, Spain\n\nObjective: Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic medicine around the world. Even though the overall mortality rate due to acute APAP overdose is less than 0.5%, this disorder is currently the leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF) worldwide. Early recognition and treatment of patients with APAP poisoning are essential to minimize their morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to identify areas of improvement in the management of acetaminophen poisoning in a tertiary hospital.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: A retrospective review of all cases of APAP poisoning presenting to the Emergency Department of Hospital Puerta de Hierro (2015–2021) was conducted. The focus of the review was the quality of the management of APAP poisoning, according to CALITOX criteria. Key results are presented (e.g., regarding the timing of APAP serum concentration measurement (>4 h), conduct/timing of gastrointestinal decontamination (within 3 h after ingestion) and adequacy of NAC prescription).\n\nResults: Twenty-six cases were identified. Median age was 24 years (IQR, 18.9–47.5). Most patients (19, 73.1%) were female. Twenty-two (84.6%) cases were related to suicide attempts. Twenty (76.9%) patients required inpatient hospitalization. Liver toxicity was documented for 5 (19.2%) patients; 2 (7.7%) of them underwent liver transplantation. None of the patients died. Acetaminophen serum levels were obtained within the recommended window in 20 (76, 9%) cases. Gastrointestinal decontamination was performed in 12 patients, in most of them (9, 75%) within the 3 h post-ingestion window. Serum levels of APAP were obtained prior to the recommended 4 h post-intake window in 6/10 patients (60%) with early arrival post-intake. In 13 patients, NAC was administered prior to the measurement of APAP concentration (well indicated in 11 patients, 84.7%).\n\nConclusions: Overall, acetaminophen overdose is managed adequately in our hospital. Some areas of improvement were identified, which could be solved by implementing a multidisciplinary, therapeutic, management protocol.\n\n#39\n\nThe influence of the COVID19 pandemic in the patterns of acute poisoning presenting to an emergency department in Spain\n\nAntonio Francisco Caballero Bermejo1, Belén Ruiz Antorán1, Almudena Ramírez García1, Catalina Homar Amengual2, Concepción Payares Herrera1, Aránzazu Sancho López1 and Jordi Puiguriguer Ferrando2\n\n1Clinical Pharmacology Department, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda. Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro-Segovia de Arana, Madrid, Spain; 2Clinical Toxicology Unit. Emergency Department, Hospital Universitario Son Espases, Palma, Spain\n\nObjective: COVID-19 has left no healthcare system untouched. Adjustments to accommodate COVID-19 pandemic needs resulted in widespread deferment of non-COVID19 scheduled healthcare activities, added to a general patient's reluctance to visit healthcare settings.\n\nThis study is aimed to analyse retrospectively demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with acute poisoning attended at the Emergency Department (ED) in three different pandemic periods of time.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: We carried out an observational and retrospective study in which we included all the patients who visited the Emergency Department at Hospital Son Espases due to acute poisoning during three different periods of time from June to July in 2019 (pre pandemic), same period in 2020 (right after the strict confinement in Spain) and in 2021 (post-pandemic). This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Balearic Islands.\n\nResults: All cases of acute poisoning were included (n = 1182). Patients with acute poisoning presenting to the ED decreased significantly during the pandemic (2019: 1.9%, 2020: 1.5%; p < 0.01). The ratio male/female and the mean age of the patients increased during the pandemic (2 vs. 1.4, p = 0.02, and 31.4 vs. 41.3 years, p < 0.001, respectively). The roll of poisoning in suicide attempts increased substantially during the pandemic (2019: 8.71%, 2020: 21%; p < 0.01), mostly driven by the increase in poisoning due to commercially available drugs (2019: 14.20%; 2020: 28.76%, p < 0.01), while recreational drug poisoning decreased (2019: 76.1%, 2020: 62%; p < 0.01), while in 2021, figures tended to return to prior patterns.\n\nConclusions: This study found significant changes in some clinical patterns in patients attending the ED due to acute poisoning in the context of COVID19, in line with the already described impact of the pandemic in other areas of the healthcare system.\n\n#41\n\nEstudio de pacientes con reacción adversa por vacunas anti-COVID-19 en El Área sanitaria De Santiago De Compostela\n\nLaura Romero Sánchez, Andrea Otero Alonso, Maria González Rivas, Virginia Rodríguez Vázquez and Margarita Armisén Gil\n\nServicio de Alergia. Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain\n\nObjective: La vacunación anti-COVID-19 ha incrementado las consultas de Alergología, por reacciones adversas tras su administración. Sociedades científicas, EAACI y SEAIC, han emitido recomendaciones de vacunación para pacientes alérgicos. Actualmente, sólo está contraindicada la vacunación con alergia a algún componente.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Entre enero y mayo 2021 valoramos pacientes con reacción adversa tras vacuna anti-COVID-19. Un grupo control incluía pacientes en estudio de alergia a fármacos, vacunas (antigripal) y anafilaxia de diferentes etiologías.\n\nSe realizaron pruebas cutáneas en prick con excipientes de la vacuna implicada: para Pfizer-BioNTech Polietilenglicol (PEG) 400, 3350 y 4000; para Moderna PEGs y Trometamol; y para AstraZeneca Polisorbato 80. En reacciones no inmediatas añadimos pruebas epicutáneas.\n\nEl mismo estudio se realizó en grupo control, teniendo en cuenta las indicaciones de vacuna vigentes para cada grupo de población.\n\nResults: La tabla adjunta contiene los datos de 22 pacientes que presentaron reacciones no anafilácticas tras la vacunación. Obtuvimos 1 resultado positivo (prick PEG 3350 y 4000): mujer, sin antecedentes alergológicos, con reacción local y sistémica tipo urticaria 7 días después de la 1° dosis (Moderna). Se recomendó no administrar 2° dosis. En 16 pacientes restantes con reacción tras las 1° dosis, se recomendó administrar la 2°. En 4 pacientes se reprodujo una reacción similar a la dosis previa. En 56 pacientes del grupo control encontramos 2 resultados positivos; ambos eran pacientes en estudio de alergia a fármacos: uno con prick positivo para PEG 3350 y otro con una prueba epicutánea positiva para Trometamol. Salvo en estos pacientes, al resto se les permitió la vacunación y actualmente la han recibido el 57% con buena tolerancia.\n\nConclusions: En el grupo analizado, se diagnosticó alergia a excipientes de la vacuna en 1 paciente, y otros 4 (18% del total) reprodujeron la clínica tras la 2a dosis, sin poder atribuirlo a un mecanismo alérgico.\n\n#47\n\nSevere hypophosphatemia after ferric carboxymaltose intravenous treatment: Case series\n\nMelani Nuñez Montero1, Eva Montane Esteva1,2, Olga Hladun Alvaro1, Yolanda Jimenez Capel3, Clara Joaquin Ortiz4, Analía Ramos Rodas4, Anna Morales Triado5, Ana Sancho Cerro6, Silvia Martínez Couselo6 and Helena Guardiola Ponti7\n\n1Clinical Pharmacology Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Badalona, Spain; 2Pharmacology, Therapeutics and Toxicology Department, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Spain; 3Anesthesiology Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Badalona, Spain; 4Endocrinology Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Badalona, Spain; 5Pharmacy Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Badalona, Spain; 6Biochemistry Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Badalona, Spain; 7Internal Medicine Department, Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, Badalona, Spain\n\nObjective: To describe the characteristics of patients with severe hypophosphatemia (HP) after intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and how risk factors may contribute.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: We selected spontaneously reported cases of hypophosphatemia in patients with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) treated with FCM before surgery. Patients were included if HP was severe (phosphate level ≤1 mg/dl). We considered risk factors the length of treatment, high doses, advanced age, previous kidney disease, low phosphate, ferritin and transferrin saturation baseline levels.\n\nResults: We retrospectively analysed four patients with a mean age of 61 years old (range 53–67). All patients presented IDA due to a gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasia. Renal function was preserved and the phosphate baseline levels were normal. Total FCM amount administered per patient was 2 g (in two patients), 2.5 g and 3.5 g. All patients presented severe HP and two of them life threatening HP (<1 mg/dl), whose lowest level of phosphate detected was 0.6 g/dl. Time to onset HP varied between 3 and 24 days, and the time to reach nadir level ranged between 13 days and 1 month. None of them reported clear signs or symptoms. All patients needed intravenous phosphate supplementation treatment to recover, and normal phosphate levels were reached after 7 days to 2 months. In one case surgery had to be postponed until phosphate levels were within the normal range. Two cases presented at least one of the risk factors mentioned before. Two cases had positive rechallenge.\n\nConclusions: Notwithstanding that hypophosphatemia is a frequent and well-known adverse effect related to intravenous iron, it is otherwise still underecognized. Data of these cases showed that patients even without risk factors presented severe hypophosphatemia after few doses of FCM, which could carry out relevant consequences; thus, physicians should be aware to detect and treat them properly.\n\n#49\n\nSerious infections in patients treated with immunossuppressive biologic agents\n\nEva Montané Esteva1,2, Olga Hladun Alvaro1, Melani Núñez Montero1, Ana Maria Barriocanal Barriocanal3, Ana Pilar Pérez Acevedo4, Gloria Cardona Peitx5, Maria Esteve Pardo6, Beatriz Blanco Rojas7, Julia Valera Paloma7 and Luisa Pedro-Botet Montoya8\n\n1Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain; 2Department of Pharmacology, Therapeutics and Toxicology, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Spain; 3Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona, Spain; 4Department of Clinical Pharmacology.

Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Spain\n\nObjective: To assess the evolution over a 4-year period of the rate of admissions for infections among patients hospitalized on immunosuppressive biologic agents (IBA) and to describe the characteristics of patients with these infections.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients on IBA identified through the hospital admission diagnosis list between 2017 and 2020 was performed. The patients were included if infection was the reason for hospital admission. Data of the number of patients on IBA were collected for the same period of time.\n\nResults: During the study period, the proportion of admissions due to infections in patients on IBA decreased a 65% (from 20% in 2017 to 7% in 2020), while the number of patients under IBA increased a 48% (from 884 patients in 2017 to 1308 in 2020). A total of 78 severe infections were identified in 56 patients on IBA (hospital readmission range 2–5). The median age of cases was 66 years old (range 5–82), and 64.1% were women. Rheumatologic disease was present in 56 cases (71.8%), rheumatoid arthritis in 39%. The most frequent site of infection was respiratory (46.2%), and 12 (15.4%) cases were bacteriemia. Thirty-four (43.6%) cases were caused by bacteria (GNB in 58.8%), and 16 (20.5%) were not microbiologically confirmed. The most frequently involved drug was infliximab (21.8%). Concomitant immunosuppressive drugs were present in 52 cases (66.6%), glucocorticosteroids in 73.1% of them. Mortality was 3.8% (three cases).\n\nConclusions: In the last 4 years, although the number of patients on IBA has increased by 50%, the proportion of admissions for infections in these patients has been more than halved. These results could be explained by the implemented actions of a multidisciplinary team focused on improving the safety such as vaccination or latent infection screening.\n\n#53\n\nEffect of bisphosphonate withdrawal: Follow-up of a cohort of patients\n\nCristina Vedia Urgell1,2, Juan Antonio Garcia Vicente1,2, Roser Vallès Fernández3, Guillem Pera Blanco4, Cristina Morales Navajas5, Alicia Franzi Sisó6, Javier Luis Sevilla Merino7 and Rafael Azagra Ledesma3\n\n1Servei Atenció Primaria Barcelonès Nord i Maresme.

Source: Primary health care records (ECAP) of Catalan Health Institute (North Metropolitan Primary Health Care). Inclusion: women on bisphosphonates (2012–2014) without previous treatment; annual package dispensed ≥80% of the treatment. Exclusion: secondary osteoporosis. Follow-up: 2015–2017. Variables: osteoporotic fractures, age, densitometry, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcoholism, adverse effects. Two cohorts are formed: Short treatment (ST) 3 years and long treatment (LT) 4–6 years. Baseline comparison: chi square (categorical variables) or t-test (continuous). The case was maintained in the cohort until the first fracture. Risk of fracture (Cox regression, adjusted).\n\nResults: Cohorts: ST 689 patients, LT 1009 patients. Mean age 75 years. In ST, more smokers (6% vs. 3%; p = 0.009) and more alcoholism (17% vs. 11%; p = 0.01). No differences in BMI (only 694 registered patients) and densitometry (only 37 patients). Fractures: n = 34: 5 (0.7%) in ST and 29 (2.9%) in LT (p = 0.002). Hazard Ratio adjusted for age in ST: 4.0 (95% CI: 1.6–10.4, p = 0.004). The 38.2% (13) occurred in the first year of follow-up, 26.5% (9) the second and 35.3% (12) the third. Location: forearm (29.4%), vertebrae (17.6%), femur (12%) and humerus (11.7%). Average number of package/year of bisphosphonates: 11.9 in 2012–2014 decreasing in follow-up (8 in 2015, 4.8 in 2016, 3.1 in 2017). Patients with fractures were significantly more adherent to the treatment (85% vs. 59% p = 0.002). Adverse effects: Atrial fibrillation 0.9% in ST and 1.1% in LT; p = 0.656.\n\nConclusions: Treatment with bisphosphonates in primary prevention for more than 3 years does not seem to reduce the risk of fracture, but it should be taken into account that the record of densitometries is very low and adherence to follow-up also decreases.\n\n#54\n\nDrug-related deaths in a tertiary hospital: Comparison between cases detected with different pharmacovigilance strategies\n\nAna Lucía Arellano Andrino1,2, Pau Alcubilla Prats1, Magí Farré Albadalejo3,2 and Eva Montané Esteva3,2\n\n1Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Servicio de Farmacología Clínica, Barcelona, Spain; 2Departamento de Farmacología, Terapéutica y Toxicología, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; 3Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Servicio de Farmacología Clínica, Badalona, Spain\n\nObjective: To compare the characteristics of drug-related deaths (DRD) detected with different pharmacovigilance methods.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: We retrospectively analysed spontaneous reported DRD cases from the hospital's pharmacovigilance program registry. The registry includes both adverse drug reactions (ADRs) spontaneously reported (SR) by health professionals and active surveillance (AS) carried out by clinical pharmacologists. The SR cases included were those with a fatal outcome from the registry from January 2009 to December 2018. For the AS study, we selected potential DRD cases from the hospital's mortality registry of the year 2015 if the patient's death diagnosis potentially oriented to a death caused by a drug. Both studies are already published.\n\nResults: The SR study reported more type B reactions (28.8% vs. 0%), more hospital-acquired DRD (31.5% vs. 8.2%), higher number of concomitant drugs (9 vs. 7), and more drugs started within the week before the ADR (31.5% vs. 11%) than the AS study. In both studies, DRDs were more commonly observed in male patients over 65 years old, also haemorrhagic and infection reactions were the most frequent. However, the SR study identified hepatobiliary, pulmonary and allergic reactions, while the AS study did not (5.4%, 9.6%, 8.2% vs. 0%, respectively). The SR study identified drugs in the J category (anti-infectives) (9.8% vs. 0%), and A category (antidiabetics and proton pump inhibitors) (7.3% vs. 0%) that the AS study did not. When comparing the causality assessment and preventability criteria, no significant differences were found. But almost half of the DRDs were preventable, in both strategies.\n\nConclusions: This study suggests that different pharmacovigilance methods can be complementary to increase the level of information, and thus, be able to increase the safety of drugs for in-hospital patients. The combination of several methods should be mandatory to detect, assess, understand and design strategies to prevent ADRs to ensure patient safety.\n\n#55\n\nCharacteristics of drug safety alerts issued by the Spanish medicines agency\n\nEva Montané Esteva1,2 and Javier Santesmases Ejarque3,4\n\n1Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain; 2Department of Pharmacology, Therapeutics and Toxicology, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Spain; 3Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain; 4Department of Medicine, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Spain\n\nObjective: To describe the characteristics and regulatory actions generated by the safety alerts issued by the Spanish Medicines Agency (AEMPS) and the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System over a 7-year period.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: A retrospective analysis of drug safety alerts published in the web page of AEMPS from January 2013 to December 2019 was conducted. Alerts not drug-related and warning addressed to patients were excluded. Collection study variables was conducted by two researchers independently, and consensus was reached when discrepancies were present.\n\nResults: During the study period 126 safety alerts issued, 12 of which were excluded because were not related to drugs or were specifically addressed to patients, and 22 of which were also excluded as had similar information to previous alerts. A total of 92 alerts were included, reporting 130 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and involving 84 drugs. The most frequent scientific information source used to support safety alerts were spontaneous reporting (32.6%). Alerts were addressed specifically to children in 4.3%. The ADRs were serious in 85.9% of alerts. The most frequent ADRs were hepatitis (seven alerts) and congenital malformations (five alerts), and the most frequent drug class involved were antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (23%). A 26% of involved drugs were “under additional monitoring.” Regulatory actions induced changes of product characteristics in 44.6% of alerts and triggered eight market withdrawn medications with unfavourable benefit–risk ratio.\n\nConclusions: Despite all the limitations, spontaneous reporting was the most frequent scientific information source on which alerts were based, thus supporting that it is an essential tool for drug and patient safety. Drugs “under additional monitoring” were frequently implicated in alerts due to their unknown safety profile. As a result of the alert, almost half of the drug data sheets underwent changes in product information and one in 10 alerts resulted in the withdrawal of the drug.\n\n#57\n\nAdverse drug reactions in paediatric surgery: A prospective study\n\nCarla Pérez Ingidua1,2, Ana Belén Rivas Paterna1,3, Leonor Laredo Velasco2,4, Antonio Portolés Pérez1,2,4, Ana Ascaso Del Río2,1, Natalia Rodríguez Galán2 and Emilio Vargas Castrillón1,2,3,4\n\n1Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria del Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain; 2Servicio de Farmacología Clínica del Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain; 3Departamento de Enfermería, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; 4Departamento de Farmacología y Toxicología, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain\n\nObjective: To assess the incidence of ADRs that occurred in Clínico San Carlos Hospital between September 2019 and October 2021, as well as the causality, severity and preventability of such reactions.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: An observational, descriptive and prospective study was performed. A total of 158 operated paediatric patients (between 1 and 16 years) were included. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize and analyse the demographic characteristics of the subjects and the ADRs. The approval of Clínico San Carlos Ethical Committee was obtained.\n\nResults: An incidence of 33.5% (N = 48) ADRs was observed between September 2019 and October 2021. The average number of drugs administered in patients with an ADR was 8.8 (SD:2.5). The proportion of patients with at least one ADR was 26.6% (N = 42), and the most frequently ADRs were vascular (25%; N = 12) and gastrointestinal (25%; N = 12). The main drugs involved were Sevoflurane (52.1%; N = 25) and Fentanyl (45.8%; N = 22).\n\nAccording to the Venulet Criteria, 75% (N = 36) of the reactions were considered mild intensity, 22.9% (N = 11) moderate intensity and 2.1% (N = 1) severe intensity. However, according to the Criteria of the SEFV (Sistema Español de Farmacovigilancia), 97.9% (N = 47) of the ADRs were considered non-serious and 2.1% (N = 1) considered of serious intensity.\n\nThe causality of the ADRs according to the Method of Naranjo et al showed 77.1% (N = 37) of the ADRs had a “likely” causality score and 20.8% (N = 10) “possible” causality. Using the method of Karch–Lasagna modified, 47.9% (N = 23) were considered “likely,” 43.8% (N = 21) as “possible,” 2.1% (N = 1) as “conditional/non classified” and 4.2% (N = 2) as “definitive.”\n\nAccording to the Hallas et al. Method to analyse the preventability of the ADRs, 45 (93.8%) were considered “not preventable” and 3 (6.3%) as “probably preventable.”\n\nConclusions: The results showed a high incidence of ADRs in paediatric surgery who must to be addressed, also some of these ADRs were potentially preventable.\n\n#60\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine safety\n\nKristopher Amaro Hosey, María Angeles Quijada Manuitt and Rosa Antoniajoan Árbos\n\nHospital de Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain\n\nObjective: To assess the adverse reactions (AR) reported to COVID-19 vaccines and their characteristics.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: An observational study of reported AR to COVID-19 vaccines over a 4 months period in 2021 was carried out. A descriptive analysis of age, gender, COVID-19 vaccines types and AR was performed.\n\nResults: A total of 590 suspected AR cases were reported, corresponding to 394 users. Mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of patients was 42.8 (12.1) years and 349 (88.6%) were women. One hundred and three users (26.1%) had previously documented SARS-CoV2 infection.\n\nOf the 590 AR suspected cases to vaccines, 273 (46.3%) were reported after the first dose (Pfizer = 220 [80.6%], Moderna = 52 [19.0%] and AstraZeneca = 1 [0.4%]). The remaining 316 (53.6%) AR suspected cases occurred after the second dose (Pfizer = 289 [91.5%] and Moderna = 27 [8.5%]). One case reported (0.1%) did not include vaccine type and was therefore excluded from analysis.\n\nRegarding severity 4.8% were serious:the most frequently were respiratory disorders (dyspnoea = 8, pneumonia = 1), nervous system (neuralgia = 2 and paraesthesia = 2 and vertigo = 1) and cardiac (angina = 2 and pericarditis = 1). Only two AR caused hospital admission, and the rest were considered clinically relevant. Severe ARs were reported to the Pharmacovigilance system. No thrombosis cases were reported in our sample. General disorders, nervous system and musculoskeletal represented globally the most common AR; injection site pain, headache and fatigue for the first dose, and fever, myalgia and arthralgia and fatigue in relation to the second dose.\n\nConclusions: Most AR cases reported were considered non-serious and less than 5% were considered serious. Vaccines safety profile observed is consistent as described in clinical trials, and no safey signals such as thrombosis cases were reported in our sample.\n\n#63\n\nCalcineurin inhibitors and the adverse consequences of their use: A descriptive study in lung transplant recipients\n\nRita Nogueiras Álvarez1, Víctor Manuel Mora Cuesta2, María Ángeles De Cos Cossío3, José Manuel Cifrián Martínez2, David Iturbe Fernández2, Sandra Tello Mena2 and María Del Mar García Sáiz3\n\n1Médico especialista en Farmacología Clínica, Estudiante de doctorado de la Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain; 2Médico especialista en Neumología, Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV), Santander, Spain; 3Médico especialista en Farmacología Clínica, Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV), Santander, Spain\n\nObjective: To evaluate the development of cardiovascular and renal toxicity, following the prescription of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) drugs as maintenance immunosuppression in lung transplant (LTx) recipients.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Review of patients receiving a LTx between 01/01/2015 and 08/12/2018. We studied 165 patients. They were divided into two groups according to the CNI drug prescribed: cyclosporine (CsA)_11 patients_ or tacrolimus (Tac)_154 patients. We evaluated the de novo occurrence of arterial hypertension (AHT), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypercholesterolemia and impaired renal function after initiation of immunosuppressive therapy with CNI. In addition, the time to development of each of these events was assessed.\n\nResults: Within the group on CsA: 72.7% recipients developed AHT, 54.5% dyslipidaemia and no DM; while in the group with Tac: 26.6% developed AHT, 26.6% DM and 49.4% dyslipidaemia. As for renal function, deterioration was documented in 90.9% of recipients treated with CsA and in 74.7% of recipients treated with Tac. The time to onset for AHT and dyslipidaemia was longer in patients on CsA versus Tac treatment, while deterioration of renal function appeared earlier in recipients treated with CsA. The development of DM was only identified within the group on Tac treatment and the median time was 150 (31.5–378) days post-transplantation.\n\nConclusions: In this review of 165 LTx recipients on CNI treatment, a higher incidence of developing AHT (p = 0.003), dyslipidaemia (p = 0.492) and impaired renal function (p = 0.038) was observed within the cyclosporine-treated group, while the development of DM was only documented in tacrolimus recipients. AHT and dyslipidaemia were identified earlier in the group under Tac treatment, while renal function impairment appeared earlier in the CsA group. These events, widely described in other types of transplantation, are also confirmed in LTx recipients.\n\n#64\n\nAutoimmune inflammatory myopathies related to statin therapy Miopatías Inflamatorias Autoinmunes Relacionadas con el Tratamiento con Estatinas\n\nEsther Salgueiro Vázquez, Jon Valencia Martínez, Laura Vázquez Martínez and Miriam Revuelta De Guzmán Ministral\n\nUniversidad de Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain\n\nObjective: AIM: The muscle toxicity of statins is well known. Nonetheless, there is very little evidence about autoimmune inflammatory myopathies induced by these drugs. The aim of our study was to analyse the main characteristics of the cases of dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) associated with statin treatment published in the medical literature, in order to increase a deeper understanding of these disorders and to improve their medical control.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: METHODS: PubMed was searched for all reports related to stantin induced DM and PM, published until 31 December 2020. A descriptive analysis was made of the main characteristics of the patients, their medication, the developed myositis, and the treatment received and its outcome.\n\nResults: RESULTS: 29 DM cases and 27 PM cases were analysed. It was more frequent in women than in men, except for those under 50 years of age in the case of DM. All statins except pitavastatin have been associated with some of these cases, which suggests a possible class effect. As expected, almost all the cases had muscle weakness. Among the DM cases, more than half developed some of the Gottron pathognomonic manifestations. Almost all patients achieved very high levels of creatine kinase. Both the withdrawal of the statin and the introduction of aggressive immunosuppressive treatment, based mainly on corticosteroids, were essential in most cases, with a good clinical response in general.\n\nConclusions: CONCLUSION: The severity of these conditions highlights the importance of early diagnosis and initiation of treatment for adequate patient control.\n\n#67\n\nDescriptive analysis of menstrual alterations reported to the Spanish pharmacovigilance system (SEFV as acronym of its name in Spanish) after vaccination against COVID-19\n\nPaloma Díaz Pérez1, Eduardo Fernández Quintana2, Marcelino García Sánchez-Colomer2 and Emilio José Sanz Álvarez1\n\n1Servicio de Farmacología Clínica, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Canarias, San Cristóbal De La Laguna, Spain; 2Centro Autonómico de Farmacovigilancia de Canarias, San Cristóbal De La Laguna, Spain\n\nObjective:\n\nTo describe the most reported menstrual alterations to the SEFV in relation to vaccination against COVID-19.\n\nTo stratify cases by age, type of vaccine and reporter.\n\nTo collect the latencies of adverse events.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Review of the notifications uploaded to the FEDRA database with the following search criteria: the suspected drug is a vaccine against COVID-19, the adverse drug reaction (ADR) is part of the Meddra HLGT “alterations of menstrual flow” and the upload date is between the date of authorisation of the first vaccine (22/12/20) and the cut-off date established by protocol (3/11/2021). Also, those cases corresponding to Canary Islands have been selected for a detailed analysis.\n\nResults: There are 2275 notifications in Spain that meet the search criteria. The SEFV is the source of 98% of the notifications, being the pharmaceutical industry the source of the 2% left. In Canary Islands, there have been 80 notifications that meet the criteria. Of these, 87.5% come from female users (patients). The average age is 36 years. The most reported menstrual disorders were “intermenstrual bleeding,” “menstrual disorder” and “irregular menstruation.” The latencies described have a mean of 12.5 days with a median of 6 days and a mode of 3 days, appearing after the first dose in most cases.\n\nConclusions: Most of the reports are from female users. Coding is complex due to the difficulty of the terms, which complicates data analysis. Reported reactions are diverse, being the most frequent terms non-specific. Menstrual disturbances interfere with daily life, are under-reported and under-diagnosed.\n\n#74\n\nDetection of adverse drug reactions in hospitalized patients through laboratory alerts: Hyponatremia and rhabdomyolysis\n\nGina Mejía Abril, Mónica Valdés Garicano, Diana Campodónico, Raúl Parra Garcés and Francisco Abad Santos\n\nHospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain\n\nObjective: The present work pretends to evaluate the performance of laboratory signals as a method of detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs), using the examples of hyponatremia and rhabdomyolysis, and to describe the main drugs involved and patient characteristics.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: A retrospective descriptive observational study was carried out, including patients admitted at Hospital Universitario de La Princesa during a 6-month period (1 July to 31 December 2019). Patients with altered laboratory parameters corresponding to the signs of “rhabdomyolysis” (>5 times the upper limit of normal: 1000 U/L for men and 900 U/L for women) and “hyponatremia” (<116 mEq/L) were detected. In cases where ADR was suspected, causality assessment was performed using the algorithm of the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System (SEFV). Suspected ADR detected were reported to the SEFV.\n\nResults: One hundred eighty patients were studied for the “rhabdomyolysis” signal, of which 6 were found to have an ADR (3.3%), estimating the sensitivity of the test at 60%, a specificity greater than 97%, and a positive predictive value greater than 41%. Twenty-eight patients were studied for the “hyponatremia” signal, and 11 patients were found to have an ADR (39.28%), with a sensitivity of 76.92%, a specificity of 93.33% and a positive predictive value of 88.19%. In none of the cases there was a relationship found between the alteration of the measured analytical value and the probability of presenting an ADR.\n\nConclusions: A pharmacovigilance program based on automated laboratory signals is an effective method to detect ADR. The study of the laboratory signal “hyponatremia” is more efficient than that of the signal “rhabdomyolysis” as it detects 12 times more patients with ADR.\n\n#80\n\nSex differences in adverse events in chronic pain: An exploratory observational study\n\nAndrés López Ramal1, Alicia López Tébar2, Fernanda Jiménez Moreno2, Jordi Barrachina Bernabéu1, Mónica Escorial García1, Beatriz Orts Jorquera3, César Margarit Ferri2 and Ana María Peiró Peiró1,2,3\n\n1Miguel Hernández University, Elche, Spain; 2Pain Unit, Alicante University General Hospital, Alicante, Spain; 3Clinical Pharmacology, Alicante University General Hospital, Alicante, Spain\n\nObjective: Opioids are used to treat severe pain, although their safety profile is controversial due to the adverse events (AEs) that seems different between males and females. Our aim was to analyse the influence of sex over AEs detection in our pain population.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: An 18-month retrospective observational study was developed collecting data from telephone calls of Pain Unit ambulatory patients at Alicante University General Hospital. Calls related to any potential AE due to analgesic therapy were recorded by nursing. Research team analysed the number, type of AE, affected system according to the Medical Dictionary for regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and potential causative drug. Data were analysed by sex.\n\nResults: A total of 72 patients (71% female) reported 93 AEs. Gastrointestinal system affectation predominated in both sexes (women: 46% [30/65] vs. men: 36% [10/28], p = 0.373), with constipation as the most common AE in women (30% vs. 10%, p = 0.401) and nausea in men (27% vs. 50%, p = 0.246). Besides, gastrointestinal AEs were more related to opioid use in women than men (69% vs. 33%, p = 0.165). The second most frequently affected system was the neurological (20/93, 22%), due to dizziness as most prevalent AE (9/20, 45%) and mostly related to opioid use (58%). Here, a significant difference was observed in drowsiness (6/20, 30%) between women and men (8% vs. 63%, p = 0.018). Rate of adverse drug reaction (ADR) notification was low.\n\nConclusions: The number of AEs detected was similar between sexes, although a different tolerability pattern was showed. Women evidenced a higher sensitivity to constipation associated with opioid use and men more drowsiness. It is necessary to understand how sex and gender impacts the AEs reporting and the issue of ADR under-reporting from doctors.\n\n#82\n\nHaematological alterations in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: Drugs involved in its aetiology\n\nDavid Valencia López1, Diana Zulema Cuellar Gomez1, Iván Mazón Maraña2, Celia Gonzalez Samperio2, Andrea Bautista Blazquez1, Beatriz Alonso Gomez1, Gorka Gaztelumendi Martin1, Ana Llorente Cantalapiedra1, Álvaro Cadenas Manceñido1, Lucía Lavin Alconero2, María Del Mar Garcia Saiz1, Noelia Vega Gil1, Maria Ángeles Cos Cossio1, M. Blanca Sanchez Santiago1 and Maria Angeles Pena Pardo1\n\n1Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain; 2Instituto de investigación sanitaria Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander, Spain\n\nObjective: To explore the role of the drugs used to treat COVID-19 in the haematological alterations identified in patients hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Post-authorization observational study of 245 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection hospitalized and treated between March and April 2020 in five hospital centres in the Cantabria region. To be included in this study, complete information on the treatment used and periodic haematological examinations must be available. The data was taken from the COVID-19 Registry (NCT04347278).\n\nResults: One hundred forty-five of 245 patients (59.2%) presented haematological alterations during the acute process of infection. Leukopenia-lymphopenia appeared in 64% of the cases with alterations in the blood count and 42% presented thrombopenia. In 80% of the cases, this alteration resolved as soon as the clinical evolution of the patient improved. The following drugs were used to treat this infection: hydroxychloroquine (97.9%), lopinavir-ritonavir (82%), interferon beta-1b (7.7%), tocilizumab (20.4%) and anakinra (3,3%). The additional treatments used were enoxaparin (87.3%), methylprednisolone (23.6%), as well as antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals in patients with coinfections. A compatible temporal relationship was identified between the administration of tocilizumab and the appearance of leukopenia or worsening of pre-existing leukopenia in 40% of patients, with leukocyte recovery being observed 72 h after discontinuation of the drug. No temporal relationship was observed when other drugs were used. Regarding thrombopenia, the use of linezolid was causally involved in 8% of the patients, showing resolution in 60% of the cases when the drug was discontinued.\n\nConclusions: Patients infected by COVID-19 can develop leukopenia-lymphopenia and thrombopenia in relation to infection by the virus itself. Tocilizumab in case of leukocyte involvement and linezolid in case of platelet decline have been shown to play a role in these haematological alterations.\n\n#83\n\nThe usefulness of proactive monitoring in hospitalized patients receiving vancomycin\n\nJuan B. Raffo Nogueira, Jose Manuel Dodero Anillo, Samuel Hidalgo Rios and Maria Jose Pedrosa Martinez\n\nHospital Universitario de Puerto Real, Puerto Real, Spain\n\nObjective: Determine the usefulness and effectiveness of proactive monitoring of trough Vancomycin levels by a Clinical Pharmacology Department.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: Observational retrospective study, over a 6 months period, in a level II hospital by reviewing the clinical records of hospitalized patients receiving Vancomycin during their admission.\n\nResults: Ninety-eight patients were treated with Vancomycin during this time, 80 of them intravenously (IV) and 18 orally(O). Sixty-four of them were following parental treatment and met monitoring criteria, of whom 33(51%) had measurement levels requested by their corresponding department. Dose adjustments were needed in 20(60%) of the monitored patients, of which 18(90%) were taken into account: 16(80%) achieved the therapeutic range and 2(10%) required a treatment change. The other 2(10%) rule out the treatment immediately after the first trough level results.\n\nThe following are the most proactive departments to request the monitoring reports when the criteria was met: Nefrology(100%), Cardiology(66%), Neumonology(66%), Intensive Care(66%), Gastroenterology(63%), Internal Medicine(60%), Surgery(60%), Oncology(50%), Infectious diseases(40%), Haematology (25%) and Traumatology (16%).\n\nWe observed the absence of monitoring Vancomycin levels when administered orally notwithstanding the scientific evidence of its systematic absorption and its growing use in clinical practice.\n\nConclusions: The 48% of the patients that had monitoring criteria were not monitored, possibly due to the lack of knowledge of the importance of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Vancomycin and its narrow therapeutic range by the physicians.\n\nIn 88% of the patients in whom the dose adjustment recommendations made by the Department of Clinical Pharmacology were followed, the therapeutic target was reached.\n\nA multidisciplinary approach in the patients receiving drugs with a narrow therapeutic range is needed in order to obtain better results in terms of efficacy and safety.\n\nSECTION: C.

Each patient's medication will be checked and their metabolism. Possible pharmacogenetic biomarkers will be analysed using PharmaGKB database and the Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines. An analysis of the consults will be carried out, selecting those who are related to problems of efficacy or pharmacological toxicity, leaving the rest of the consults in a subgroup, of which only the patient's medication will be taken to provide data on the prevalence of patients with interactions.\n\nResults: We have found that, of the total amount of patients (n = 42), there are a 47.61% of them that have saturated metabolic pathways, and there are too a 64.28% of patients with medication that have indication for pharmacogenetic analysis. Sixteen of 25 patients that consult for efficacy or toxicity have saturated metabolic pathways (64%) that result in a lack of efficacy of the metabolic activity in the same way that a pharmacogenetic mutation would work.\n\nConclusions: Between 47% and 64% of patients benefited from the therapeutic consultation as they were interacting with Drugs at the P450 cytochrome level. In addition, having genetic mutations have similar clinical relevance at that point. It will be important to approach interactions on patients with this point of view, looking for personalized and precision medicine, and this affair can be helped by clinical pharmacologist, giving a global visión of the clinical impact of the correct drug prescription.\n\n#27\n\n“Influence of Pharmacogenetic factors in the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in a paediatric population”\n\nAndrea Guzmán De Antonio1, Paula Conesa García1, Lucía Díaz García1, Lucía Martínez De Soto1, Mikel Urroz Elizalde1, Alejandro Zarauza Santoveña2, Alberto M. Borobia Pérez1 and Antonio J. Carcas Sansuán1\n\n1Clinical Pharmacology Department, IdiPAZ, La Paz University Hospital, School of Medicine, Autonomous University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain; 2Paediatric Nephrology Department, La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain\n\nObjective: Tacrolimus (TCR) is a widely immunosuppressant drug used to prevent the rejection of kidney transplant. Drug dosing and its efficacy and safety are affected by its narrow therapeutic range and its wide inter and intrapatient pharmacokinetic variability. This variability is largely produced by polymorphisms in genes coding proteins involved in drug metabolism, having a direct impact on the bioavailability of TCR. CYP3A5 is the major gene involved in the variability of TCR levels. We evaluate the effect of other important genes involved in TCR metabolism and contributing to TCR dosing prediction.\n\nMaterial and/or methods: The present study includes data from two previous studies: a single-centre, open-label study of TCR treatment conversion from Prograf to Advagraf and a unicentric retrospective cross-sectional study, both including paediatric population of stable renal-transplanted patients undergoing treatment with TCR. We assessed the relationship of the Area Under the Curve (AUC0-24 h) and pharmacogenetic variables adding or not clinical variables (age, haemoglobin, albumin, glomerular function analysis).\n\nResults: In the univariate analysis, we found that CYP3A5-rs776746, CYP3A4-rs2740574, CYP3A4-rs35599367 and CYP3A7-rs2257401 were the only SNPs that yielded a significant p value (p < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, nearly 50% of the variability in TCR disposition (R2) is exp"
