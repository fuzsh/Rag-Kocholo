        "text": "This paper presents the construction and estimation of a deprivation index based on Principal Component Analysis for Ecuadorean economy. The PCA analysis is applied on the material deprivation view to observe the material living condition of Ecuador. Two databases are used for the goal; census of population and surveys of households for different periods. This approach allows to analyze to different disaggregate levels the deprivation in Ecuador, starting from province (the highest available) to the lower level of city blocks. Results indicates that Andean region and rural areas present the lowest level of deprivation, while the rural and Andean region have a highest level of deprivation level. At a lower level, Guayaquil, the largest city, presents the highest level of deprivation compared with the other important cities of Ecuador as the capital, Quito, and Cuenca. This are important hints to improve quality of life in terms of material deprivation.\n\nThe present article reviews poverty studies in Spanish Autonomous Communities using a new methodological approach. One of the main concerns in those studies is poverty concentration in specific Spanish Autonomous Communities. This can be the result of a bias due to use a unique national poverty line, since the circumstances of every family unit, specifically if it is poor or not, could be different depending on the Region it inhabited. In order to test this assertion we estimate a CHAID algorithm and CATPCA. The main conclusion of this analysis is that Spanish poverty is strongly influenced by regional differences. To correct this effect we define as Spanish poor households those that are, at the same time, under the national and regional poverty line. We call this group Real poverty. Finally, we calculate ten poverty indexes for this real poor population. The results show that it is no possible to categorize Spanish Autonomous Communities depending on poverty indexes, since they do not configure a specific distribution of those regions. On the contrary, every index establishes its own regional ordering. Therefore, we should introduce regional adjustments in data and focus in household characteristics –size, type, age, level of education…- to explain Spanish poverty. The information comes from the Spanish Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) in 2008.\n\nThis baseline cross-sectional analysis from data acquired in a sub-sample of the PREDIMED-Plus study participants aimed to evaluate the relation between the Composite Socioeconomic Index (CSI) and lifestyle (diet and physical activity). This study involved 1512 participants (759 (52.2%) women) between 55 and 80 years with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome assigned to 137 primary healthcare centers in Catalonia, Spain. CSI and lifestyle (diet and physical activity) were assessed. Multiple linear regression or multinomial regression were applied to the data. Cluster analysis was performed to identify dietary patterns. The multiple linear regression model showed that a high deprivation index was related to a higher consumption of refined cereals (11.98 g/d, p-value = 0.001) and potatoes (6.68 g/d, p-value = 0.001), and to a lower consumption of fruits (−17.52 g/d, p-value = 0.036), and coffee and tea (−8.03 g/d, p-value = 0.013). Two a posteriori dietary patterns were identifie...\n\nThe Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007 (IMD 2007) is a measure of multiple deprivation at the small area level. The model of multiple deprivation which underpins the IMD 2007 is the same as that which underpinned its predecessor – the IMD 2004 (Noble et al., 2004) and is based on the idea of distinct dimensions of deprivation which can be recognised and measured separately. These are experienced by individuals living in an area. People may be counted as deprived in one or more of the domains, depending on the number of types of deprivation that they experience. The overall IMD is conceptualised as a weighted area level aggregation of these specifi c dimensions of deprivation. This chapter, which draws from the ID 2004 Report, elaborates on the model of multiple deprivation that has been used and addresses issues relating to it.\n\nCurrently, the demographic vacuum and poor development suffered by most areas of Spain are some of the most worrying issues from a territorial point of view, which is why this study is necessary. In this paper, the objective is to create a Development Index with which to study the different realities of rural and urban spaces through demographic and socioeconomic variables of the Spanish municipalities. Principal Component Analysis is carried out, with whose results the index has been prepared. This is then explored with a Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis. The results show that most developed Spanish municipalities and most of the population are concentrated in coastal areas and in the main cities of the country. In opposition, there are interior rural areas with less developed municipalities at risk of disappearance due to their increasing ages and levels of depopulation. Thus, in this paper, new variables and methods are used in the study of the social and economic diversity of ru..."
