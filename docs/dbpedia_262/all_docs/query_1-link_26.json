        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThere are several reasons why paediatric medicine development has been largely neglected for a long time (e.g., protection from clinical research for ethical reasons, economic considerations related to investigation, and complexity of age subgroups). Currently, there is broad consensus that childhood deserve access to medicines that have been specially researched and developed for them.1-3\n\nDespite this, the development and testing of paediatric medicines has been far from satisfactory and the need for clinical trials has frequently been underscored,2, 3 especially for neonates and infants, which are the most vulnerable age groups.1 Consequently, paediatricians must rely on their own experience and extrapolation to prescribe rather than on the results of robust clinical research.2 Moreover, medicines are often not available in a suitable pharmaceutical form and paediatricians must turn to medicines authorised for adults or children with different age ranges and adapt dosing and pharmaceutical form.4 This off-label use of medicines comes with the risk of ineffectiveness and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in children.1, 2, 5\n\nDespite the attempt of international harmonisation in paediatric drug development and authorization, each regulatory body in the world has its own complex pathway, which is also subject to local regulation and subsequent barriers. This fact has often been controversial in many countries like the United States (US) or the European Union (EU), due to the increasing need of moving forward faster in paediatric drug regulation from the perspective of clinical practice and real-world evidence.6\n\nVery few studies, such as Suarez-Castañón et al.,7 have analysed the evidence of use for off-label medicines in primary health care setting. According to studies conducted in the EU member states, there is a large variation in off-label prevalence and no clear patterns were identified.1 A recent systematic literature review addressed unlicensed and off-label prescription of drugs to children in primary health care,8 which included six studies conducted between 2000 and 2016, indicated that the incidence of off-label use varied from 29.5% to 51.7% of total drugs prescribed (prospective analysis). The prevalence of off-label drugs ranged from 31.7% to 93.5% in relation to the total number of drugs prescribed (retrospective analysis). The studies included patients from Brazil, France, Malta, Scotland and The Netherlands.\n\nA novel joint policy statement, recently published in Europe, aimed to fill the gap between medicines licensed for paediatric use (regulatory authorisation) and real-world evidence in neonates, infants, children, and adolescents. Its purpose is to offer guidance for health care professionals on when and how to prescribe off-label medicines to children and to provide recommendations for future European policy.9 Thus, the main objectives of this study were first to provide information about the off-label rate of all drug prescriptions in neonates and infants up to 1 year in Spain, and secondly to analyse the time trends in off-label medicines prescription under current practice in this age group according to different clinical evidence sources (national, UK, non-EU).\n\n2 METHODS\n\n2.1 Study design and setting\n\nA 5-year (from 2015 to 2019) exploratory observational study about off-label prescription in neonates and infants (0–1 year) at primary health care in Spain.\n\nThe average births per year in Spain during the study period was close to 400 000. Neonates and infants up to 1 year accounted for 2% of the total population in the country.10\n\nThe primary health care workforce in Spain is organised around a multidisciplinary team, with a gatekeeping function which provides free access to prevention and promotion of health, acute and chronic care, home care and community care activities. The core of the team is made up of general practitioners (GPs), who are family and community medicine specialists, paediatricians, nurses, auxiliary nurses, social workers, dentists and administrative staff.\n\nPaediatricians are responsible for the health of children below 15 years old, while patients over the age of 15 are seen by GPs.11\n\nThe latest available data (year 2018) indicate that 13 129 primary care centres were registered in Spain to serve 46.7 million people. 65 148 health care professionals were allocated (of which 6506 were paediatricians). Data collection showed an annual average of 4.89 consultations to paediatricians per patient.12 The health care system in Spain follows a Beveridge model (National Health System), which is characterised by providing universal access to population. Other countries that share the same model are Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Sweden and United Kingdom (UK). In the EU countries, the predominant mode of provision in primary health care is private except in Greece, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Spain. The organisation in primary health care in Spain is based on groups of GPs and other health professionals, as in Finland, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, The Netherlands and UK.12\n\n2.2 Inclusion criteria\n\nAll prescriptions issued by paediatricians in neonates and infants (0–1 year) in primary health care (outpatients). Due to the high number of prescriptions (per year >5 000 000) expected for this age group according to preliminary results, it was decided not to broaden the paediatric population under study,13 such as infants and young children (1–4 years), children (5–11 years) and adolescents (12–15 years).14\n\n2.3 Exclusion criteria\n\nAll prescriptions issued for neonates and infants up to 1 year at hospitals (inpatients). Prescriptions from GPs, nurses and other professionals different from paediatricians in primary health care. Repeated prescriptions from specialists were excluded too.\n\n2.4 Data sources\n\nStudy data collection included the prescription records from a private database (complete national scope) sorted by months of age and drug (branded name, active substance, strength, package and dosage form). The database did not provide information about the type of prescription (paper format or electronic) and the number of patients (neither aggregated nor by age group). Since it was not linked to medical records, both first and repeated prescriptions were considered but undifferentiated.15\n\nThe Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), the legal document approved as part of the marketing authorisation of each medicine, was the primary source to determine off-label prescriptions.16 Additional data sources were used for further analysis: Pediamécum (a Spanish documentary database of active substances used in Paediatrics),17 British National Formulary (BNF),18 DailyMed19 and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).20 These sources were visited at different points in time, accordingly to each year of study.\n\n2.5 Variables\n\nVariables collected were quantitative: demographic (months of age; gender could not be derived from the dataset) and resource use (number of total prescriptions; number and percentage of off-label prescriptions and evidence-based; number and percentage of off-label over-the-counter [OTC] drugs prescribed), as well as qualitative: active substances and therapeutic groups (name and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) code21), dosage forms and sections of the SmPC where information about authorised age of use was identified (pharmacokinetic properties, special warnings, therapeutic indications, posology and method of administration, pharmaceutical form and/or contraindications).\n\nA prescription is the form used to prescribe a medicine. According to the Spanish regulation, one single prescription could be used to prescribe several packages of the same medicine in specific situations (i.e., insulins and some systemic antibiotics).\n\nThe age grouping of study was neonates and infants up to 1 year.14 In addition, four subgroups of age were established (0–2 months, 3–5 months, 6–8 months and 9–11 months) to carry out a sub-analysis about general results on prescription rate according to months of age.\n\nIn the present study, off-label drugs were defined as those that were not authorised for this age group according to the information on the SmPC.16 Otherwise, they were on-label.\n\nOff-label prescriptions were subsequently classified as evidence-based and clinically unjustified (not evidence-based), according to the additional data sources listed for data analysis. Sources like Pediamécum,17 BNF18 and DailyMed19 include updated evidence of real clinical practice and the FDA labelling20 may provide different information than the European or Spanish SmPC.16 In summary, these additional sources may include variations from the SmPC information depending on age. In case any of them pointed out information for use in less than one-year old children, the drug was therefore considered off-label on a regulatory basis but evidence-based according to current clinical practice.\n\nThe inclusion of the American source, DailyMed, was relevant since sometimes the same medicines have different indications depending on the geographical location and the medicines agency involved, thereby leaving the door open for off-label use in case of discrepancies between territories.\n\nOTC drugs are usually aimed for mild symptoms and self-care. Although they are medicines dispensed directly to a consumer without the need of a prescription from a GP in Spain, they may appear in prescriptions as a reminder to the patient.\n\n2.6 Data analysis\n\nTotal number of prescriptions were studied according to labelling, evidence of use in real clinical practice and drug characterisation. A descriptive statistical analysis of the data was carried out. Quantitative variables were published as means and percentages. Percentages were also calculated for characterisation of drugs mostly prescribed off-label. Supplementary Table SS1 includes a structured definition of each outcome measure and the corresponding calculation methodology.\n\nThe assessment of off-label prescription justified by clinical practice or evidence-based off-label prescription was carried out by two researchers independently; conflicts were resolved through discussion and consensus or consultation with a third reviewer. The screening in the databases or formularies followed this funnel: SmPC (national source; Spain) > Pediamécum (national source; Spain) > BNF (European source; UK) > DailyMed (international, non-European source; USA). So that, if clinical justification for a certain off-label use was identified in Pediamécum and/or BNF, DailyMed was no longer consulted. BNF was revised to double-check the information obtained from Pediamécum or in case the information at Pediamécum was absent or incomplete. In case neither Pediamécum nor BNF incorporated clinical justification for a certain off-label use, DailyMed was then consulted. If none of the three sources contained results, off-label prescribing was assessed as clinically unjustified.\n\nA statistical analysis comparing the number of prescriptions across neonates and infants was carried out by groups and subgroups of age. First, it was assessed whether each group and subgroup followed a normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test). If so, ANOVA and Tukey tests were performed to confirm statistical differences between subgroups (p < 0.05).\n\nAccording to the preliminary analysis conducted by months of age during the first 2 years of the study (2015 and 2016), a single drug could be on-label for a specific month of age, but off-label for another; and in the same way, it could be an off-label prescription justified by clinical practice for a specific month of age, but not evidence-based for another.13"
