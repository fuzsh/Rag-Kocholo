The suite of Patient Reported Experiences and Outcomes of Safety in Primary Care (PREOS-PC) tools are a notable exception to the scarcity of patient-reported patient safety measures. Full evaluation of their performance has only been attempted for the English version, thereby limiting its international applicability.\n\nObjectives\n\nTo assess the psychometric performance of the Spanish and Catalan versions of the PREOS-PC-Compact.\n\nMethods\n\nCross-sectional validation study. We used Classical Test Theory methods to examine scale score distribution, internal consistency, and construct validity; and Item Response Theory (IRT) methods to further explore construct validity.\n\nResults\n\n3287 patients completed the Spanish version, and 1007 the Catalan version. Similar results were obtained for both versions. Confirmatory Factor Analysis supported a single construct for each scale. The correlations between PREOS-PC-Compact scales and known group analysis suggested adequate construct validity (inconclusive for known groups at the provider level). All four multi-item scales demonstrated adequate internal consistency reliability (α > 0.7), which was only confirmed for test-retest reliability for ‘Practice activation.’ A sample between 60–90 patients per practice was estimated sufficient to produce scores with reliability > 0.7 for all scales except for harm scales. IRT models showed disordered thresholds for ‘Practice activation’ and ‘Harm burden’ but showed excellent fit after reducing the response categories.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Spanish and Catalan versions of the PREOS-PC-Compact are broadly valid and reliable tools to measure patient safety in Spanish primary care centres; confirmation of lower-than-expected test-rest reliability merits further examination .\n\nKeywords: Health care evaluation mechanisms, observational study, patient safety, patient reported outcomes, primary health care\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports that approximately 20%–25% of individuals receiving primary and ambulatory care suffer harm, resulting in a direct cost of about 2.5% of total health expenditure due to additional tests, treatments, and healthcare [1]. In Spain, around 3 million adverse events occur in the Primary Care Centres (PCC) [2], resulting in costs of up to 1000 million Euros per year [3]. Consequently, patient safety (defined as ‘the prevention of errors and adverse effects to patients associated with healthcare’) has become a significant focus for primary care systems worldwide [4].\n\nThe lack of appropriate measurement tools impedes efforts to enhance patient safety [5]. Available tools rely on healthcare providers’ information, such as safety culture questionnaires or voluntary reporting of safety events by health professionals, while patient-reported tools are scarce. However, over the last decade, patient participation in incident prevention and harm reduction has gained momentum [6]. Patients, as care recipients, often spot different safety incidents and outcomes than staff, being motivated to report errors [7]. This engagement yields positive results in preventing adverse events and increasing awareness of safety risks [6,8–10]. Indeed, patient-reported data drives successful innovative interventions for safer health systems [11–13].\n\nThe Patient-Reported Experiences and Outcomes of Safety in Primary Care (PREOS-PC) questionnaire is an innovative patient-centred tool used to measure patient safety in primary care settings [14]. This tool was initially developed in England using a multistage process that involved an expert panel and was informed by two systematic reviews [15,16], four focus groups, and 18 cognitive interviews [14]. A subsequent validation study involving 45 PCCs provided evidence of the questionnaire’s validity and reliability [14]. The original version of the questionnaire contained 61 items and was suitable for research purposes, successfully measuring and evaluating patient safety in PCCs in the UK [17]. Two shorter questionnaire versions were subsequently developed: PREOS-PC-Compact (29 items) and PREOS-PC screen (6 items). PREOS-PC-Compact balances high psychometric standards (high reliability and validity) and reduces administrative and patient burden. This could simplify its adoption and utilisation for standard patient safety monitoring in primary care [18,19].\n\nPREOS-PC-Compact was cross-culturally adapted for its use in Spain as part of SinergiAPS (‘Sinergias entre profesionales y pacientes para una Atención Primaria Segura’/Synergizing providers and patients for Safer Primary Care) [13], an intervention aimed at improving patient safety in PCCs through the provision of patient feedback. PREOS-PC-Compact (described in detail in Methods and ) is available in Spanish and Catalan. Data from a pilot study involving 493 patients in 10 PCCs in Spain offered incipient evidence supporting the validity and reliability of the Spanish PREOS-PC-Compact [20]. A separate study provided evidence of sensitivity to change in PREOS-PC-Compact scale scores (substantially decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic scores [21]). However, the available evidence regarding the psychometric properties of the Spanish PREOS-PC-Compact is still limited, as it mainly stems from data from a pilot study and many properties have not yet been analysed. Additional evidence (based on larger samples) is needed to confirm the observed findings further and to examine additional psychometric properties, such as construct validity. Up to date, the psychometric properties of the Catalan version remain unexplored.\n\nTable 1.\n\nDomainPREOS-PC-compactConstructRating itemsOpen-ended itemsPractice activation (what does the PCC do to create a safe environment and to ensure safety)Practice activation41Patient activation (how pro-active are patients in ensuring safe healthcare delivery)Patient activation21Patient experiences of safety problems (safety errors)Types of safety problems experiencedb121Outcomes of patient safety (harm)Harm severity (health domain-specific harm)31Harm burden (health and personal care, and financial needs)3Overall perceptions of patient safety (how safe do patients rate their PCC)Overall rating of patient safetyc10Overall6 constructs254\n\nThis study aims to analyse the psychometric properties of the Spanish and Catalan versions of the PREOS-PC-Compact.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design\n\nCross-sectional validation study using data collected as part of SinergiAPS, a randomised clinical trial evaluating a patient feedback intervention to improve patient safety. The SinergiAPS intervention has been described in detail elsewhere [13]. In brief, centres allocated to the intervention arm were fed back information regarding patients’ experiences of safety (collected through the PREOS-PC-Compact questionnaire) and were instructed to plan safety improvement actions based on it.\n\nData collection\n\nBaseline data collection took place between November 2019 and January 2020. The PREOS-PC-Compact questionnaire was administered to 4,555 patients from 59 PCCs (at least 75 per centre) in Mallorca, Barcelona, and Tarragona (Spain). After excluding questionnaires completed in English (n = 27), those indicating no visits to the PCCs during the last year (n = 89), and with missing sociodemographic characteristics (n = 145), we analysed 4294 questionnaires. The characteristics of the participating PCC are detailed in Supplementary Material 1. In each PCC, we sequentially invited all patients in the waiting room to complete the self-administrated PREOS-PC-Compact. Patients were given the option to choose between the Spanish or Catalan version. The questionnaire aimed to gather their perceptions, experiences, and outcomes regarding healthcare safety received from their PCCs over the past 12 months. Additionally, patients were requested to provide sociodemographic and clinical information. For patients under 18, we invited them if they were accompanied by an adult caregiver, who would complete the questionnaire on their behalf. In addition, we provided patients with the opportunity to administer the questionnaire personally. The total number of questionnaires included in this study in each PCC in each language is available in Supplementary Material 2.\n\nBaseline characteristics of the participating PCCs were extracted from electronic health records by information technology specialists from the Balearic Islands’ Health Service and the Catalan Institute of Health (see acknowledgements). The information extracted included: the number of registered patients, proportion of female patients, proportion of patients aged > 65, number of Primary Care providers, patients’ clinical complexity (GMA [22]), PCC rurality index [23], and rate of avoidable hospital admissions in the previous twelve months [24]. In addition, all Primary Care professionals participating in the SinergiAPS trial were requested to complete the Spanish or Catalan versions of the Medical Office Survey on Patient Safety Culture (MOSPSC) [25,26], a measure of healthcare professionals’ perceptions of the PCC’s safety climate.\n\nPREOS-PC-Compact\n\nPREOS-PC-Compact contains 29 items organised into five domains ( ): centre activation (how the PCC works towards establishing a safe environment and ensuring the safety of its patients − 4 items-scale and an open question); patient activation (how actively do patients ensure safe healthcare? − 2 items scale and an open question); patient experiences of safety problems (safety errors − 12 items not conceived to be combined in a scale, and an open question); outcomes of patient safety (harm – two scales of 3 items each, evaluating severity and burden respectively, and an open question); and overall perception of safety (1 item).\n\nTo determine the scale scores, we utilised all available responses without any imputation and expressed them as a percentage of the maximum score across all available items in the scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, indicating the higher the score, the greater the safety. In cases where 50% or more of the items in a scale had missing or non-applicable responses, we considered the scale score as missing. The Spanish and Catalan questionnaires and the details about computing the scale scores are available in Supplementary Material 3.\n\nThe cross-cultural adaptation process of PREOS-PC-Compact into Spanish involved setting up a panel of 6 national experts in patient safety from different backgrounds, including PHC doctors, academics, and managers, to determine its content validity. This was followed by translation and back-translation of the questionnaire, cognitive testing with eight patients, and a pilot study with 10 PCCs and 500 patients [20]. The Catalan version was adapted similarly, including questionnaire forward and back translation from English and cognitive debriefing with patients. More details are available in the Supplementary Material 4.\n\nPsychometric properties\n\nAcceptability of items\n\nWe evaluated the number and patterns of missing data as a proxy for the acceptability of items [27].\n\nFloor and ceiling effect\n\nWe analysed the proportion of responses that fell in the minimum and maximum categories for each item in each scale to assess floor and ceiling effects. We established a threshold of 80% or more of the responses falling into the maximum or minimum category, respectively [28].\n\nReliability\n\nWe evaluated internal consistency by examining inter-item correlations (with coefficients ≥0.3 indicating good consistency) [29] and Cronbach’s α (α ≥ 0.7 [30] indicating good reliability). We assessed test-retest reliability using one-way random effects intra-class correlations (ICC) (with ICC of at least 0.7 [31] indicating good test-retest reliability), utilising data from a subset of patients who completed the PREOS-PC-Compact twice in the same language version, approximately two weeks apart.\n\nStructural and construct validity\n\nTo assess structural validity, we independently conducted a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on each multi-item scale with more than 2 items, that is, ‘Practice Activation,’ ‘Harm Severity’ and ‘Harm Burden’ with each item loading only on the corresponding scale without restrictions to correlate with the rest of the items on the scale and excluding the observations with missing values. We examined goodness-of-fit statistics, including the Satorra-Bentler Chi-squared statistic, comparative fit index (CFI), and standardised root-mean residual (SRMR). For model evaluation, we followed Hu and Bentler’s recommendation, using a combinational rule of CFI > 0.95 and SRMR < 0.09 [32]. We also evaluated construct validity (known-group [33]) by (1) testing pre-specified patient safety differences (at the patient level – according to patients’ gender, age, number of visits, and clinical complexity) by bivariate linear regression analysis; (2) examining the correlation between practice level patient safety scores and PCCs characteristics (mean number of patients per doctor, clinical complexity (GMA), the proportion of patients aged 65 or over, safety climate score (MOSPSC), and avoidable hospital admissions), and (3) examining the correlations amongst the PREOS-PC-Compact scales. All the a priori hypothesised relationships are available at Supplementary Material 5.\n\nPractice-level precision and discrimination between PCCs\n\nTo evaluate how effectively each scale measures safety at the PCC level, we computed the standard error of a PCC mean score to measure the precision of measurement. A standard error of 5 points on the 0–100 scale indicates strong precision [28]. Additionally, we utilised the between-practice ICC coefficient to compute the reliability coefficient, which measures the ability to discriminate between PCCs [28].\n\nReliability of PCC mean=nper prectice×SD2of PCC effectnper prectice×SD2oPCC effect+SD2within PCC\n\nWe estimated the sample size required to achieve reliable discrimination (at the 0.7 level) between PCC scores based on the between-practice ICC coefficient [28].\n\nResponses needed for0.7reliability=0.7×SD2within PCC0.3×SD2of PCC effect\n\nOne parameter item response Theory (IRT) models\n\nWe used IRT models [34] to analyse data from participants who responded to all items in each scale. We evaluated the unidimensionality assumption by conducting a post-hoc principal components analysis (PCA) on the item residuals and the local independence by examining correlations between item residuals. We considered assumptions satisfied if the first eigenvalue of the PCA was ≤2, and residual correlations were ≤0.40 [35]. We reported the fit of each item to the scale according to the IRT model using the infit mean square statistic, where values between 0.50 and 1.50 were considered productive for measurement [36]. Additionally, we used person-item maps [37] to inspect item difficulties and the spread of the response category threshold for each model. Items with the same difficulty parameters are indicative of redundant information. Thresholds are the specific positions that separate response categories, ensuring equal chances of selection for each response (determined at the median probability point).\n\nWe conducted analyses using Stata\\SE version 15.1, except the IRT models, which we constructed using the eRm package for R version 4.1.0.\n\nEthical approval was granted by the Balearic Islands Ethics Committee (CEI IB 3686/18) and by IDIAP-Jordi Gol Research Ethics Committee (CEIC-IJG 19/116-P, 24/07/2019).\n\nResults\n\nCharacteristics of the participating patients\n\nOf the 4294 respondents, 3287 completed the Spanish PREOS-PC-Compact version and 1007 the Catalan PREOS-PC-Compact version ( ). Among those completing the Spanish version, 2127 (64.71%) were female, with a mean age of 51.83 years (SD = 18.53). Most respondents were from Spain (2813; 85.58%) and without a university degree (1949; 59.29%). Around half (1778, 54.09%) reported multiple long-term conditions and 60.69% (1995) reported a ‘very good’/’good’ health status. Patients completing the Catalan version were more likely to be aged 65, retired, from Spain and with university studies.\n\nTable 2.\n\nSpanish versionCatalan versionTotal respondents32871007Sex Male1160 (35%)376 (37%) Female2127 (65%)631(63%)Age* Mean (SD); [range]51.83 (18.53); [1–97]53.43 (19.29); [1–95] < 1874 (2%)26 (3%) 18–29360 (11%)103 (10%) 30–44739 (22%)205 (20%) 45–641192 (36%)326 (32%) ≥ 65922 (28%)347 (34%)Country of origin* Spain2813 (85%)971 (96%) EU countries123 (4%)12 (1%) Non-EU countries351 (11%)24 (2%)Educational level* No qualifications777 (24%)232 (23%) Non-university studies1949 (59%)568 (56%) Degree, degree equivalent and above561 (17%)207 (21%)Visits to their primary care centre during the last 12 months 1–51844 (56%)569 (56%) 6–10786 (24%)258 (26%) >10657 (20%)180 (18%)Employment situation* Working1647 (50%)468 (46%) Retired1043 (32%)362 (36%) Other (unemployed, student)597 (18%)177 (18%)Health status Very good/ Good1995 (61%)643 (64%) Fair /Bad /Very bad1292 (39%)364 (36%)Number of long-term conditions Mean (SD); [range]2.19 (2.11); [0–16]2.09 (2.03); [0–11] 0862 (26%)280 (28%) 1647 (20%)202 (20%) 2–31002 (30%)293 (29%) >3776 (24%)232 (23%)\n\nPsychometric properties\n\nThe psychometric characteristics of the Spanish and Catalan versions are presented in and .\n\nTable 3.\n\nN/A – “Don’t know” responses %Min category response %Max category response %Alpha if item deletedFactor loading from the CFA (95% CI)aItemsCategoriesSpaCatSpaCatSpaCatSpaCatSpaCatPractice Activation (unidimensional)GP available when needed?

The Catalan version presented similar acceptability, showing a median item N/A response rate of 1.99% (interquartile range 1.69%–2.73%). In both versions the items showing less acceptability pertained to the ‘Patient activation’ construct, with an N/A response rate higher than 8% for both items.\n\nFloor and ceiling effect\n\nIn both versions, we observed a ceiling effect for the item ‘GP took patient’s concerns seriously?’ (80% of patients reported ‘Always’); and for all the items in the scales ‘harm severity’ and ‘harm burden’ (more than 90% of patients reported ‘not at all’ for all the items). Accordingly, we observed a ceiling effect for both harm scales, with 89.81% and 88.51% of respondents with the highest possible scores in the Spanish version and 97.26% and 97.39% of respondents achieving the highest possible scores in the Catalan version ( ).\n\nReliability\n\nThe four multi-item scales, the Spanish version demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach’s α, 0.71–0.85) and adequate homogeneity (inter-item correlations, 0.37–0.74) ( ). The test-retest was performed on a sub-sample of 55 patients of the 386 who initially consented (retest response rate 14.2%). The test-retest ICC was above the 0.70 standard only for the ‘Practice activation’ scale.\n\nThe Catalan version showed lower reliability features, with three scales presenting suboptimal internal consistency (‘Practice Activation’ (α = 0.67), ‘Harm severity’ (α = 0.69) and ‘Harm burden’ (α = 0.62)). We could not explore test-retest ICC for the Catalan version due to insufficient sample size.\n\nStructural and construct validity\n\nThe CFA on ‘Practice Activation,’ ‘Harm Severity’ and ‘Harm Burden’ scales provided evidence for high structural validity in both versions ( ). The models met Hu and Bentler’s criteria, suggesting adequate goodness-of-fit, although they failed to meet the Chis-squared Satorra–Bentler scaled statistic (data available in Supplementary Material 6). The Spanish version presented moderately high internal consistency coefficients while the Catalan version presented suboptimal consistency coefficients for some scales. In both cases, the results of the CFA indicated that each scale measures a singular construct and that the items can be aggregated to generate summary scores.\n\nWhereas the results from the patient-level known group analyses generally supported the construct validity of the scales from the Spanish version, the results from the practice-level analyses were largely inconclusive. In the Catalan version most of the hypothesised differences between groups of patients or PCC characteristics did not reach statistical significance ( ).\n\nTable 5.\n\nHarm severity (Impact on health)Harm burden (Impact on personal care, and financial needs) Patient characteristics, β (95% CI) a Spa (n = 3287) Cat (n = 1007) Spa (n = 3287) Cat (n = 1007) Gender Male1111 Female−0.631 (−1.545; 0.176)−0.935 (−2.214; 0.216)−1.029 (−1.870 − 0.143)*−0.826 (−1.907; 0.214)Age0.059 (0.037; 0.081)â± 0.022 (−0.007; 0.051)0.055 (0.034; 0.078)â± 0.026 (−0.005; 0.056)Visits to the PCC/year 1–51111 6–10−0.715 (−1.658; 0.225)*−2.403 (−3.984; −0.912)*−1.335 (−2.417; −0.350)*−0.864 (−2.161; 0.320) >10−2.837 (−4.199; −1.520)*−3.791 (−6.246; −1.718)*−2.450 (−3.736; −1.219)*−3.907 (−5.992; −1.800)*Discordant multimorbidity No1111 Yes−1.297 (−2.280; −0.447)*−2.262 (−3.627; −0.907)*−1.174 (−2.058; −0.276)*−1.051 (−2.283; 0.121) PCC characteristics, r (95% CI)b Spa (n = 59) Cat (n = 43) Spa (n = 59) Cat (n = 43) Quota of assigned patients per doctor−0.386 (−0.584; −0.1480)*−0.130 (−0.453; 0.180)−0.141 (−0.391; 0.153)−0.107 (−0.440; 0.210)PCC proportion of patients aged >650.292 (0.027; 0.522)â± 0.166 (−0.147; 0.486)0.088 (−0.203; 0.354)0.033 (−0.287; 0.337)Patient complexity index (GMA)c0.003 (−0.338; 0.331)0.003 (−0.332; 0.342)−0.067 (−0.388; 0.250)−0.067 (−0.394; 0.238)Patient safety culture (MOSPSC, SIPS)0.047 (−0.237; 0.297)0.001 (−0.281; 0.310)0.049 (−0.215; 0.310)0.092 (−0.217; 0.395)Avoidable hospitalisations0.276 (−0.003; 0.533)â± 0.048 (−0.276; 0.421)−0.052 (−0.349; 0.216)0.028 (v0.310; 0.313)\n\nThe correlations between PREOS-PC-Compact scales in the Spanish version ( ) suggested an adequate construct validity of the scales, being in line with our pre-specified hypothesis (e.g. strong positive correlation between ‘Harm severity’ and ‘Harm burden’ (r = 0.54); but not a significant correlation between ‘Patient activation’ and ‘Overall rating’).\n\nTable 6.\n\nSpanish123451.

PCC mean scores demonstrated high precision for all the scales, with standard errors ranging from 1.63 (‘Harm Burden’) to 5.07 (‘Patient activation’), being just above the predefined limit for the scale of ‘Patient activation.’\n\nThe between-practices reliability coefficients were < 0.70 except for ‘Practice activation’ (0.73). This indicates that a sample size of 60–90 patients per PCC would be adequate to generate well-discriminating scores (reliability ≥ 0.7) for all scales except the harm scales (severity and burden), for which larger samples (172 and 258, respectively) would be necessary.\n\nFor the Catalan version the between-practices reliability for ‘Practice activation’ was of 0.76. However, the rest of the coefficient were lower than 0.70 (especially for both harm scales), indicating that, with the available sample (about 23 questionnaires per PCC), the PCC mean score does not discriminate well between PCCs regarding patient perceptions of safety. A sample size of 16–46 patients per PCC would be adequate to generate well-discriminating scores for most scales while for the harm scales (severity and burden) larger samples would be necessary (419 and 1275, respectively).\n\nOne parameter IRT models\n\nThe unidimensionality and local independence assumptions were met in each model (goodness of fit indices are available at Supplementary Material 6). Results from the IRT models showed that all items had infit mean square statistics considered productive for measurement (Supplementary Material 7A,B). The item difficulty estimates ranged from −0.75 (b1_p2) to 1.12 (b1_p4) in the Spanish version, and from −0.79 (b1_p2) to 0.88 (b5_p6) for the Catalan version, without items with similar difficulty parameters. Regarding response category thresholds, in both versions all items from ‘Patient activation’ and ‘Harm severity’ had properly ordered response categories. However, in ‘Practice activation’ three items had disordered category thresholds (b1_p2, b1_p3 and b1_p4) and in ‘Harm burden,’ one item had disordered category thresholds (b5_p7). Disordered thresholds could indicate response options are not well-calibrated. Item Characteristic Curves and person-item maps are available in Supplementary Material 7A,B).\n\nReduction of scales\n\nBased on IRT results, we rescored all items from the ‘Practice activation’ and ‘Harm burden’ scales (those with disordered thresholds) in both language versions. We combined the response options, leaving both in three response categories: the current extreme categories and a central one that combines the adjacent response options. The psychometric characteristics of the modified ‘Practice activation’ and ‘Harm burden’ scales and their items are presented in Supplementary Material 8. For both versions, the two showed scales were unidimensional, productive for measurements and presented a similar structural validity to the original one. The modified ‘Practice activation’ scale’s internal consistency was just below adequate for both versions (α = 0.677 [Spanish] and α = 0.671 [Catalan]). Results from the IRT models for both modified scales showed that all items had properly ordered response categories. According to these results, reducing the response items of these scales seems appropriate.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMain findings\n\nIn this study, we conducted a detailed psychometric evaluation of the Spanish and Catalan versions of the PREOS-PC-Compact questionnaire. The results support the acceptability of both versions. They also support their reliability, validity, and internal consistency.\n\nComparison with existing literature\n\nAs far as we know, the PREOS-PC is currently the only validated questionnaire available in Spanish and Catalan to assess patient safety in primary care from patients’ perspectives. While other questionnaires exist in different languages, such as the Primary Care Patient Measure of Safety questionnaire or the ASK-ME-questionnaire [38,39], they primarily focus on contributory factors to safety incidents rather than actual experiences of safety events and harm.\n\nOur Classical Test Theory results are consistent with our previous exploratory study involving 493 patients [20], confirming the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. Moreover, when comparing the Spanish and Catalan versions with the original English PREOS-PC-Compact [19], we observed similar psychometric properties. Some of the CFA coefficients in the Spanish version were marginally higher than the English one (indicating better performance), except for the ‘Practice Activation’ scale, which was lower in the Spanish version (with values below 0.6 for the first two items).\n\nImplications\n\nThe PREOS-PC-Compact questionnaire discriminates among various user groups and types of primary care centres, making it a valuable tool for monitoring patient safety in different contexts. However, it’s important to consider the minimum sample size necessary to ensure precision and discrimination, particularly for scales measuring less frequent events like harm.\n\nWe did not find relevant differences between the Spanish and Catalan versions (which may be explained by the proximity between the two languages and the shared cultural context in Spain) supports the combined use of both versions in Catalan-speaking regions of Spain.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nThis study benefits from several methodological strengths, including a large dataset of completed questionnaires in both languages, allowing for thorough analyses. Additionally, combining Classical Test Theory with IRT models represents a state-of-the-art psychometric evaluation. Moreover, we explored various features, including comparing psychometric properties in different languages.\n\nHowever, certain limitations should be acknowledged. First, we could not obtain precise data regarding the response rate at the questionnaire level (as it was not accurately recorded). Our previous study shows that the response rate to PREOS-PC-Compact administered in PCCs is around 77% [20]. Sometimes, response bias is unlikely to introduce major systematic biases in psychometric studies [40]. However, future research should examine the characteristics of non-respondents. Second, the PREOS-PC aims to capture the experiences of all groups attending the PCC, including children. In our sample, 2.5% of the questionnaires correspond to under 18 patients. Consequently, some of these questionnaires may have been answered on behalf of someone else. Third, concerning the CFA, the three models fail to meet the Chis-squared Satorra–Bentler scaled statistic. Fourth, we observed skewed score distributions for some items and scales. Skew is common in questionnaires evaluating patients’ perspectives on medical care and does not necessarily limit the ability to reliably distinguish PCCs and patient subgroups with substantial sample sizes such as ours. Fifth, we addressed missing data by list-wise deletion for consistency with the methodology used in previous studies evaluating the psychometric performance of the PREOS-PC questionnaire [19,20] (thus allowing comparability across studies). Given the low proportion of missing data in this study (7.6% on the scale with the highest proportion), we feel that it is unlikely that having used alternative approaches (such as multiple imputation or full-information maximum likelihood) would have yielded substantially different results. Finally, the small sample of patients who completed the questionnaire after two weeks reduced our ability to analyse the test-retest reliability.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study suggests that the Spanish and Catalan versions of the PREOS-PC-Compact are valid and reliable tools to measure the level of patient safety in PCCS accurately from the patients’ perspective. Further refinements could help optimise and strengthen its measurement properties.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplemental Material:\n\nClick here for additional data file.(5.0M, docx)\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Mr. Jerónimo Fiol Renaudin for his support in data management–related tasks.
