SUMMARY The former Torremolinos School for Orphans of Railway Workers in the province of Malaga in Spain (1933/1935 is a work of architecture that has been widely referenced in publications, registers and heritage legislation, declared an Asset of Cultural Interest, and awarded maximum protection as a monument. However, to date, no monographic study based on an architectural assessment of the project has been carried out, moving beyond educational or formal descriptions of the building. The article presents this type of hybrid socio-educational architecture in its historical context for the first time, focusing on the work of Francisco Alonso Martos, the architect behind all the projects that comprise a network of Schools for Orphans of Railway Workers (SORs.

Phytoplankton analyses showed the presence of different species producers of marine biotoxins, dominating Ostreopsis cf. ovata in the followed immediately days to the communication of 39 clinical cases of people that required health cares. The risks of the toxins produced by microalgae must be taken into account in the health networks surveillance for recreational waters. This study suggests the possibility to review the actions of the public health services from Public Administration, to the light of the increasing information on episodic harmful algal blooms.

J.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nResonant frequencies of the new recreational external eastern dock of the harbour of Malaga (Spain), have been analyzed with a Biuniqueness numerical model. The computational area includes an important part of the Malagueta beach, placed in front of the mouth of the future dock, and considered as a possible generation source of infra gravity energy. In order to determined all possible oscillations modes of the sheltered area, a previous simulation with a colour spectrum with equal energy into 25s - 1 to 350s - 1 frequency range, was carried out. the analysis of the response spectra gotten in the control points showed an important application at 70s - 1. the simulation with monochromatic wave of 70s period pointed out a second transversal oscillation mode among the Malagueta beach and the inner quay of the new dock. Additional numerical running using measured data coming from Malaga Spanish buoy network, placed near of the harbour, leads similar amplifications in the range of 70s 1 -80s - 1 close to that obtained theoretically.

At present, 247 families and 8.110 taxa, distributed in angiosperms (93.97%), ferns and fern allies (4.89%) and gymnosperms (1.14%), constitute the MGC-Cormof collection. The families and genera best represented in the collection are Compositae, Leguminosae, Gramineae, Labiatae, Caryophyllaceae, Teucrium, Silene, Asplenium, Linaria and Quercus. Most of the specimens are from the Western Mediterranean Region, fundamentally Southern Spain (Andalusia: 82% of specimens) and Northern Morocco (2.17%). Approximately, 63% of the specimens are georeferenced. The identification of the specimens in the collection has been carried out by the plant biology department at the University of Malaga and plus 40% of the specimens has been reviewed by experts. The MGC-Cormof dataset has been revised by DarwinTest v3.2 tool (Ortega-Maqueda and Pando 2008) before being published in GBIF.

The values of genetically significant dose, somatically significant dose and damage are presented. The determinations refer to the population of Malaga and calculate the values of the dose-area product, dose in organs and effective doses. At first glance, these complex explorations seem to provide dose rates which are much higher than those for simple examinations. However, our values demonstrate the contrary. The numbers contrast with the values obtained from simple examinations by the population. Although the reasons are multifactorial, the root cause is the average age of the patients which undergo interventional vascular radiology: they are much older than patients who undergo simple explorations\n\nNatural and Artificial Radioactivity in Drinking Water in Malaga, Spain\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDuenas, C.; Fernandez, M.C.; Gordo, E.; Canete, S.; Perez, M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWater has a vast importance for numerous human activities, so that securing supplies of drinking water of a standard quality is becoming more and more difficult.

A.; Mudarra, M.; Andreo, B.; De la Torre, B.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTracer concentration data from field experiments conducted in several carbonate aquifers (Malaga province, southern Spain) were analyzed following a dual approach based on the graphical evaluation method (GEM) and solute transport modeling to decipher flow mechanisms in karst systems at regional scale. The results show that conduit system geometry and flow conditions are the principal factors influencing tracer migration through the examined karst flow routes. Solute transport is mainly controlled by longitudinal advection and dispersion throughout the conduit length, but also by flow partitioning between mobile and immobile fluid phases, while the matrix diffusion process appears to be less relevant. The simulation of tracer breakthrough curves (BTCs) suggests that diffuse and concentrated flow through the unsaturated zone can have equivalent transport properties under extreme recharge, with high flow velocities and efficient mixing due to the high hydraulic gradients generated. Tracer mobilization within the saturated zone under low flow conditions mainly depends on the hydrodynamics (rather than on the karst conduit development), which promote a lower longitudinal advection and retardation in the tracer migration, resulting in a marked tailing effect of BTCs. The analytical advection-dispersion equation better approximates the effective flow velocity and longitudinal dispersion estimations provided by the GEM, while the non-equilibrium transport model achieves a better adjustment of most asymmetric and long-tailed BTCs. The assessment of karst underground flow properties from tracing tests at regional scale can aid design of groundwater management and protection strategies, particularly in large hydrogeological systems (i.e. transboundary carbonate aquifers) and/or in poorly investigated ones.\n\nHydraulic heroes: the ironies of utopian hydraulism and its politics of autonomy in the Guadalhorce Valley, Spain\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nBoelens, R.A.; Post Uiterweer, N.C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis paper focuses on the Guadalhorce Valley, Malaga Province, Spain, where a rich farmer-managed irrigation tradition has flourished since Arab times.

The samples were recovered in the Roman Theatre of Malaga (Spain. A thorough analysis including stereomicroscopy, elemental analysis by WDXRF, mineralogical analysis by XRPD coupled with the Rietveld method, and SEM, has been carried out. Highly diluted fused glass beads probed to be enough for the X-ray fluorescence analyses, minimizing the damage to the samples. For selected samples, in addition to the classical use of the Rietveld method, the G-factor external-standard approach has been employed to get full quantitative crystalline and amorphous phase analysis. The analytical results allow proposing a local regional provenance for the main part of the samples, being a relevant data for several artifacts, not contextualized due to stratigraphic alterations in the site. In addition, some relevant samples, for instance a theatrical mask fragment (TRC005, are likely foreign. The overall amorphous is not negligible in phase quantification, accounting for up to 50 wt %. Technologically, all terra-cotta samples are similar, made of calcareous clays, fired at ~700-950 ÂºC.Se han estudiado 22 terracotas figuradas feno-pÃºnicas y romanas, de alto valor arqueolÃ³gico y patrimonial.

We describe the characteristics of an outbreak of the CRF19_cpx variant among treatment-naÃ¯ve patients in southern Spain. The study was undertaken at the Virgen de la Victoria Hospital, a reference centre for the analysis of HIV-1 genotype in Malaga (Spain). Subtyping was performed through REGA v3.0 and the relationship of our CRF19_cpx sequences, among themselves and regarding other reference sequences from the same variant, was defined by phylogenetic analysis. We used PhyML program to perform a reconstruction of the phylogeny by Maximum Likelihood method as well as further confirmation of the transmission clusters by Bayesian inference. Additionally, we collected demographic, clinical and immunovirological data. Between 2011 and 2016, we detected 57 treatment-naÃ¯ve patients with the CRF19_cpx variant. Of these, 55 conformed a very well-defined transmission cluster, phylogenetically close to CRF19_cpx sequences from the United Kingdom. The origin of this subtype in Malaga was dated between 2007 and 2010. Over 50% of the patients presented the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor G190A resistance mutation. This variant was mostly represented by young adult Spanish men who had sex with men. Almost half of them were recent seroconverters, though a similar percentage was diagnosed at a late state of HIV infection. Five cases of AIDS and one non-AIDS defined death occurred during follow-up. The majority of patients treated with first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) responded. We report the largest HIV-1 CRF19_cpx cohort of treatment-naÃ¯ve patients outside Cuba, almost all emerging as an outbreak in the South of Spain. Half the cases had the G190A resistance mutation. Unlike previous studies, the variant from Malaga seems less pathogenic, with few AIDS events and an excellent response to ART.\n\nEmergence as an outbreak of the HIV-1 CRF19_cpx variant in treatment-naÃ¯ve patients in southern Spain.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCarmen M GonzÃ¡lez-Domenech\n\nFull Text Available CRF19_cpx is a complex circulating recombination form (CRF of HIV-1.

A Case Study in the City of Malaga, Spain\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRosa-JimÃ©nez, Carlos; Nebot, Nuria; GarcÃ­a Moreno, Alberto; JosÃ© MÃ¡rquez Ballesteros, MarÃ­a\n\n2017-10-01\n\nA vertical slum is defined as a socially vulnerable community in a building, with serious problems of functionality, safety and habitability. It is related to an important level of physical degradation, and a precarious socioeconomic situation of its occupants. Their inability to create a real community for proper and mandatory maintenance increases the physical deterioration of the building. The abandonment of the original owners of the houses can cause a system of illegal occupation and illegal activities, and vice versa. In many cases, the new occupants are primarily interested in maintaining the building in a state of precariousness in order to avoid any attempt of renovation by administrations. These security and habitability problems often extend outside the building and they affect a whole community of neighbours within the neighbourhood who feel threatened and insecure, causing their rejection and a strong social segregation in the area. This article wants to show some of the results from a research work developed on a case study of vertical slum in the city of Malaga, in Spain. In this context of marginality previously described, the research project explores different alternatives for the renovation of a building, its vulnerable community and the neighbourhood in which it is inserted. The project establishes four major objectives: (a) a physical renovation of the building, (b) social transformation in a disadvantaged environment, (c) functional evolution-from a residential model to a new hybrid model with a mixed supply of social services, and (d) the incorporation of new parameters of environmental sustainability that improve the energetic behaviour of the building (transforming it into a building of almost zero consumption). The research closes with a series of strategies and results for the case study. However, the main contribution of the work is related to the research methodology that has been developed. This is structured according to the four\n\nNetworks and Selection in International Migration to Spain\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNeubecker, Nina; Smolka, Marcel; Steinbacher, Anne\n\nThis paper provides new evidence on migrant networks as determinants of the scale and skill structure of migration, using aggregate data from a recent migration boom to Spain.

The conference, formally titled, 'International Conference on the Radiological Protection of Patients in Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Radiotherapy', is being organized by the IAEA, hosted by the Government of Spain and co-sponsored by the European Commission, the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization. Medical applications of ionizing radiation are accepted world-wide as essential tools for keeping or restoring human health. However, they also represent by far the largest man-made source of radiation exposure. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) estimates that diagnostic medical applications of radiation account for about 95% of the exposure to radiation from man-made sources of radiation and about 12% of total exposure, which includes the exposures received from natural sources. More than 900 participants from 80 countries are expected to attend the conference. They cover a broad spectrum of expertise, including radiologists, nuclear medicine specialists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists, technologists/radiographers, radiological protection officers, equipment manufacturers, experts who develop standards for radiological equipment, hospital administrators and public health officials and representatives of professional societies. In addition, a number of patients who have undergone radiation treatment will represent patients' interests and a patient will chair one of the round table debates. The conclusions of the Conference will be incorporated into the IAEA's programme of work in the field of radiation safety and will be reported to the IAEA General Conference at its next meeting in September 2001\n\nInterfacial Effects and Organization of Inorganic-Organic Composite Solids.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1998-05-20\n\nalkoxide are examined by liquid state 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance)NMR) spectroscopy.

This associationism has resulted in attempts to create a social network and space for intercultural communication at a national level between Hispanic-Japanese families and Japanese residents in Spain. The research is based on numerical data and narrative data, however Japanese narratives from the quarterly association bulletins provide the main source of information. By using the narrative analysis method in the form of questions we have been able to study the writings in order to explore issues such as: their transcultural experiences, their processes of adapting to life in Spain, the evolution of their identity, their interpretation of the social reality around them and the passing on of their social and cultural heritage to their children, among others. The study of the Tanpopo association has demonstrated a close-knit and relaxed transcultural and female space for intraethnic communication. It reveals a joint strategy of emotional and instrumental support to overcome the isolation, the loss of social networks and the geographical separation from their own cultural region, resulting from the immigration through marriage of Japanese women living in Spain.\n\nMalaga Comun\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBarinaga, Ester\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe case is about the choice of governance structures for a community currency in the impoverished South of Spain that aims to alleviate the economic hardships brought by the economic crisis.

An example of a high relief Mediterranean karst\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPardo-Iguzquiza, E.; Duran, J. J.; Robledo-Ardila, P.; Luque-Espinar, J. A.; Martos-Rosillo, S.; Guardiola-Albert, C.; Pedrera, A.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe aim of this work is the stochastic simulation of a network of karst conduits in a high relief karst system. The simulation completes the existing cave mapping provided by speleological exploration and connects the recharge area with the discharge at the karst springs. The Sierra de las Nieves karst system is a high relief Mediterranean karst that has allowed the development of a system of large conduits and caves. The system follows the typical pattern of an alpine karst system with two characteristic zones where the development of the caves is different. The first zone, with a mean altitude of 1 750 m a.s.l., the Hoyas del Pilar and Torrecilla, is the area with highest altitude where recharge takes place and where the entrance potholes to the system are located. In this zone the cave system has a development mainly along the vertical (with 1,000 m of vertical development along a few hundreds of metres of horizontal development) with large shafts and narrow and steep meanders, until the local base level is reached at 700 m a.s.l. In the second zone, the system has a quasi-horizontal development with 300 m of altitude difference for 7 km in the horizontal until the base level of the system at the Rio Grande Spring (450 m a.s.l.). The transition between both zones is dominated by the presence of sumps where the conduits have vertical ondulations. The connectivity between the entrance and the resurgence has been demonstrated, in the past, by tracer tests. The system of super caves has been made possible because of the favourable conjunction of lithological, structural, geomorphological, hydrogeological and climatic factors. Geomorphic indices are introduced to describe the three-dimensional karst networks so the known network can be completed (i.e. simulated), taking into account statistical and probabilistic criteria. The simulated system can be used for the mathematical flow simulation of the karst system.

This study is an attempt to identify possible differences in different settings, among teachers who had launched an innovation project, and others who had not. For that purpose, a questionnaire was distributed among the faculty of the University of Malaga. The sample consisted of 112 teachers, 29 of whom had undertaken projects of innovation. The results show that significant differences exist between the two groups of teachers in relation to pupils, other teachers, resources, and use of aids and educational programming. The paper concludes with a profile of innovative teachers and some reflections on the importance of innovation and its role in the educational reforms currently taking place.\n\nAssessment of the National Park network of mainland Spain by the Insecurity Index of vertebrate species.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEstrada, Alba; Real, Raimundo\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe evaluation of protected area networks on their capacity to preserve species distributions is a key topic in conservation biology. There are different types of protected areas, with National Parks those with highest level of protection. National Parks can be declared attending to many ecological features that include the presence of certain animal species. Here, we selected 37 vertebrate species that were highlighted as having relevant natural value for at least one of the 10 National Parks of mainland Spain. We modelled species distributions with the favourability function, and applied the Insecurity Index to detect the degree of protection of favourable areas for each species. Two metrics of Insecurity Index were defined for each species: the Insecurity Index in each of the cells, and the Overall Insecurity Index of a species. The former allows the identification of insecure areas for each species that can be used to establish spatial conservation priorities. The latter gives a value of Insecurity for each species, which we used to calculate the Representativeness of favourable areas for the species in the network. As expected, due to the limited extension of the National Park network, all species have high values of Insecurity; i.e., just a narrow proportion of their favourable areas are covered by a National Park. However, the majority of species favourable areas are well represented in the network, i.e., the percentage of favourable areas covered by the National Park network is higher than the percentage of mainland Spain covered by the network (result also supported by a randomization approach). Even if a reserve network only covers a low percentage of a country, the Overall Insecurity Index allows an objective assessment of its capacity to represent species. Beyond the results presented here, the Insecurity Index has the potential to be extrapolated to other areas and to cover a wide range of species.\n\nImpact of erosion in the taluses of subtropical orchard terraces\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nDuran Zuazo, V.H.; Ruiz, J.A.; Raya, A.M.; Tarifa, D.F.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe coast of the provinces of Granada and Malaga (SE Spain) are economically important areas for the subtropical fruit cultivation.

Moreover, asymptotic closed form expressions are provided to validate our work at high power regime. In addition, all the presented analytical results are illustrated using a selected set of numerical results.

In order to overcome the analytical difficulties of the proposed composite channel model, we employed the mixture Gamma (MG) distribution. The proposed model shows a high accurate and tractable approximation just by adjusting some parameters. More specifically, we derived new closed-form expression for average bit error rate employing rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation in term of MG distribution and generalized power series of the Meijer\\\\'s G- function. The closed-form has been validated numerically and asymptotically at high signal to noise ratio.\n\nPerformance analysis of subcarrier intensity modulation using rectangular QAM over Malaga turbulence channels with integer and non-integerÎ²\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nAlheadary, Wael G.\n\n2016-10-13\n\nIn this paper, we derive the performances of optical wireless communication system utilizing adaptive subcarrier intensity modulation over the Malaga turbulent channel. More specifically, analytical closed-form solutions and asymptotic results are derived for average bit error rate, achievable spectral efficiency, outage probability, and ergodic capacity by utilizing series expansion identity of modified Bessel function. Our asymptotic and analytical results based on series solutions with finite numbers highly matched to the numerical results. By exploiting the inherent nature of fading channel, the proposed adaptive scheme enhances the spectral efficiency without additional transmit power while satisfying the required bit error rate criterion.

Its develop started in the 1960s of the XXth century at the same time as other regions in Mediterranean Europe. Since then, this area has become a holiday touristic centre for different countries and regions from Europe (United Kingdom, Escandinavia, Germany, Netherlands, Russia, etc.). Likewise, Costa del Sol has been characterised by a constant grow of the residence tourism rendering in an extreme increment of urban areas, especially in those municipalities located in the coast. This expansiÃ³n of urban Ã¡reas was carried out against rural and natural vegetated areas. The region is characterised by very montanious topography, predominant impermeable rocks (shales, schists and peridotites) and abundant rainfalls from October to May, especially, in the western area (where a climatic gradient is observed from humid to dry conditions). All of these features, joined a very spread and intense occupation by urban, infrastructures and touristic land uses, renders in a very high vulnerability to fires and their consequences. As fire removes vegetation cover and accelerate water erosion, local relief and climatic conditions induce to extreme high risk of soil loss and floodings. During the last 40 years, in the study area, the number of fires increased as weell as the affected area, following the similar trend for the rest of Spain and other Mediterranean countries. This situation increases the exposition to fire risk for more than one-million of people, which become at least two-millions during the summer months when fire conditions are expected.\n\nSoil Properties Database of Spanish Soils.

A.; Prabu, K.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThere is an immense demand for high bandwidth and high data rate systems, which is fulfilled by wireless optical communication or free space optics (FSO). Hence FSO gained a pivotal role in research which has a added advantage of both cost-effective and licence free huge bandwidth. Unfortunately the optical signal in free space suffers from irradiance and phase fluctuations due to atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors which deteriorates the signal and degrades the performance of communication system over longer distance which is undesirable. In this paper, we have considered polarization shift keying (POLSK) system applied with wavelength and time diversity technique over Malaga(M)distribution to mitigate turbulence induced fading. We derived closed form mathematical expressions for estimating the systems outage probability and average bit error rate (BER). Ultimately from the results we can infer that wavelength and time diversity schemes enhances these systems performance.\n\nResults of the radiological environmental monitoring network in Cantabria, Spain\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSoto, J.; Rodenas, C.; Gomez, J.; Quindos, L.S.; Fernandez, P.L.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe Medical Physics Department in the University of Cantabria, Spain as member belonging to the radiological environmental Monitoring Network has been carried out a series of measures about radioactive elements in air, rain water and soil.

P.; LÃ³pez, L.; GarcÃ­a-Ortega, E.; NafrÃ­a, D. A.; SÃ¡nchez, J. L.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nIn the region of Castile-Leon, in the northwest of Spain, the study of weather risks is extremely complex because of the topography, the large land area of the region and the variety of climatic features involved. Therefore, as far as the calibration and validation of the necessary tools for the identification and nowcasting of these risks are concerned, one of the most important difficulties is the lack of observed data. The same problem arises, for example, in the analysis of particularly relevant case studies. It was hence deemed necessary to create an INTEGRATED METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATION NETWORK FOR CASTILE-LEON. The aim of this network is to integrate within one single platform all the ground truth data available. These data enable us to detect a number of weather risks in real time. The various data sources should include the networks from the weather stations run by different public institutions - national and regional ones (AEMET, Junta de Castilla y LeÃ³n, Universities, etc.) -, as well as the stations run by voluntary observers. The platform will contain real or cuasi-real time data from the ground weather stations, but it will also have applications to enable voluntary observers to indicate the presence or absence of certain meteors (snow, hail) or even provide detailed information about them (hailstone size, graupel, etc.). The data managed by this network have a high scientific potential, as they may be used for a number of different purposes: calibration and validation of remote sensing tools, assimilation of observation data from numerical models, study of extreme weather events, etc. An additional aim of the network is the drawing of maps of weather risks in real time. These maps are of great importance for the people involved in risk management in each region, as well as for the general public. Finally, one of the first applications developed has been the creation of observation maps in real time. These applications have been constructed using NCL\n\nEvaluation of Bayesian Networks in Participatory Water Resources Management, Upper Guadiana Basin, Spain\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPedro Zorrilla\n\n2010-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Stakeholder participation is becoming increasingly important in water resources management. In participatory processes, stakeholders contribute by putting forward their own perspective, and they benefit by enhancing their understanding of the factors involved in decision making. A diversity of modeling tools can be used to facilitate participatory processes. Bayesian networks are well suited to this task for a variety of reasons, including their ability to structure discussions and visual appeal. This research focuses on developing and testing a set of evaluation criteria for public participation. The advantages and limitations of these criteria are discussed in the light of a specific participatory modeling initiative. Modeling work was conducted in the Upper Guadiana Basin in central Spain, where uncontrolled groundwater extraction is responsible for wetland degradation and conflicts between farmers, water authorities, and environmentalists. Finding adequate solutions to the problem is urgent because the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive requires all aquatic ecosystems to be in a \"good ecological state\" within a relatively short time frame. Stakeholder evaluation highlights the potential of Bayesian networks to support public participation processes.\n\nSAR interferometry monitoring of subsidence in a detritic basin related to water depletion in the underlying confined carbonate aquifer (Torremolinos, southern Spain).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRuiz-ConstÃ¡n, A; Ruiz-Armenteros, A M; Martos-Rosillo, S; Galindo-ZaldÃ­var, J; Lazecky, M; GarcÃ­a, M; Sousa, J J; Sanz de Galdeano, C; Delgado-Blasco, J M; JimÃ©nez-GavilÃ¡n, P; Caro-Cuenca, M; Luque-Espinar, J A\n\n2018-04-30\n\nThis research underlines the need to improve water management policies for areas linked to confined karstic aquifers subjected to intensive exploitation, and to develop additional efforts towards monitoring their subsidence evolution. We analyze subsidence related to intensive use of groundwater in a confined karstic aquifer, through the use of the InSAR technique, by the southern coast of Spain (Costa del Sol). Carbonates are overlain by an unconfined detritic aquifer with interlayered high transmissivity rocks, in connection with the Mediterranean Sea, where the water level is rather stable. Despite this, an accumulated deformation in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction greater than -100â¯mm was observed by means of the ERS-1/2 (1992-2000) and Envisat (2003-2009) satellite SAR sensors. During this period, the Costa del Sol experienced a major population increase due to the expansion of the tourism industry, with the consequent increase in groundwater exploitation. The maximum LOS displacement rates recorded during both time spans are respectively -6â¯mm/yr and -11â¯mm/yr, respectively. During the entire period, there was an accumulated descent of the confined water level of 140â¯m, and several fluctuations of more than 80â¯m correlating with the subsidence trend observed for the whole area. Main sedimentary depocenters (up to 800â¯m), revealed by gravity prospecting, partly coincide with areas of subsidence maxima; yet ground deformation is also influenced by other factors, the main ones being the fine-grained facies distribution and rapid urbanization due to high touristic pressure.

An appropriate estimation of streamflow in advance is necessary to anticipate measures to mitigate the impacts and risks related to drought conditions. This study analyzes the prediction of future streamflow of nineteen subbasins in the Alto-Genil basin in Granada (Southeast of Spain). Some of these basin streamflow have an important component of snowmelt due to part of the system is located in Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, the highest mountain of continental Spain. Streamflow prediction models have been calibrated using time series of historical natural streamflows. The available streamflow measurements have been downloaded from several public data sources. These original data have been preprocessed to turn them to the original natural regime, removing the anthropic effects. The missing values in the adopted horizon period to calibrate the prediction models have been estimated by using a Temez hydrological balance model, approaching the snowmelt processes with a hybrid degree day method. In the experimentation, ARIMA models are used as baseline method, and recurrent neural networks ELMAN and nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR) to test if the prediction accuracy can be improved. After performing the multiple experiments with these models, non-parametric statistical tests are applied to select the best of these techniques. In the experiments carried out with ARIMA, it is concluded that ARIMA models are not adequate in this case study due to the existence of a nonlinear component that cannot be modeled. Secondly, ELMAN and NAR neural networks with multi-start training is performed with each network structure to deal with the local optimum problem, since in neural network training there is a very strong dependence on the initial weights of the network. The obtained results suggest that both neural networks are efficient for the short\n\nSocial Networks and the flow of people : The effects of computer-mediated communication on mobility of young people from a rural area in Spain\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGomez Corrochano, Daniel\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis research examines how social networking fosters the mobility of young people in a rural Spain.

A study of prevalence among pregnant women in Malaga (Spain).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBlasco-Alonso, Marta; GonzÃ¡lez-Mesa, Ernesto; GÃ¡lvez Montes, Milagros; Lozano Bravo, Isabel; Merino GaldÃ³n, Federico; Cuenca Campos, Francisco; MarÃ­n Schiaffino, Gema; PÃ©rez Torres, Sergio; Herrera Peral, JosÃ©; Bellido EstÃ©vez, Inmaculada\n\n2015-06-17\n\nThe prevalence of substance abuse in women who become pregnant is similar to that of the general population, resulting in a high fetal exposure rate during the most vulnerable period regarding neurodevelopment and organogenesis. The present study was intended to assess the level of prenatal exposure to tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs in the city of MÃ¡laga (Spain). It was designed as a cross-sectional study, and based on the anonymous self-reports of participants. A total of 451 pregnant women were recruited in the first, second or third trimester. The prevalence in each of the quarters respectively was 21.2%, 18.5% and 13.3% for smoking, 40.7%, 23.1% and 17.1% for alcohol and 4.8%, 1.9% and 1.2% for cannabis. We also found that a higher educational level was associated with a lower consumption of tobacco (RR 0.659 [0.537-0.810] p<0.0001) and greater exposure to alcohol (RR 1.87 [1.30-2.69] p<0.0007). These results, particularly in regard to alcohol intake, are sufficiently alarming to alert obstetric care providers about the need to implement preventive measures.\n\n[Networks of experiences on community health as an information system in health promotion: lessons learned in Aragon (Spain)].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGÃ¡llego-DiÃ©guez, Javier; Aliaga TraÃ­n, Pilar; BenedÃ© Azagra, Carmen BelÃ©n; Bueno Franco, Manuel; Ferrer Gracia, Elisa; IpiÃ©ns Sarrate, JosÃ© RamÃ³n; MuÃ±oz Nadal, Pilar; Plumed Parrilla, Manuela; Vilches Urrutia, BegoÃ±a\n\n2016-11-01\n\nNetworks of community health experiences promote interaction and knowledge management in health promotion among their participants. These networks integrate both professionals and social agents who work directly on the ground in small environments, with defined objectives and inclusion criteria and voluntary participation. In this article, networks in Aragon (Spain) are reviewed in order to analyse their role as an information system. The Health Promotion Projects Network of Aragon (Red Aragonesa de Proyectos de PromociÃ³n de la Salud, RAPPS) was launched in 1996 and currently includes 73 projects. The average duration of projects is 12.7 years. RAPPS interdisciplinary teams involve 701 people, of which 89.6% are professionals and 10.6% are social agents. The Aragon Health Promoting Schools Network (Red Aragonesa de Escuelas Promotoras de Salud, RAEPS) integrates 134 schools (24.9% of Aragon). The schools teams involve 829 teachers and members of the school community, students (35.2%), families (26.2%) and primary care health professionals (9.8%). Experiences Networks boost citizen participation, have an influence in changing social determinants and contribute to the formulation of plans and regional strategies. Networks can provide indicators for a health promotion information and monitoring system on: capacity building services in the territory, identifying assets and models of good practice, cross-sectoral and equity initiatives. Experiences Networks represent an opportunity to create a health promotion information system, systematising available information and establishing quality criteria for initiatives.

The objective of this study was to present the current situation of cancer incidence in Spain. The Spanish Network of Cancer Registries (REDECAN) estimated the numbers of new cancer cases occurred in Spain in 2015 by applying the incidence-mortality ratios method. In the calculus, incidence data from population-based cancer registries and mortality data of all Spain were used. In 2015, nearly a quarter of a million new invasive cancer cases were diagnosed in Spain, almost 149,000 in men (60.0%) and 99,000 in women. Globally, the five most common cancers were those of colon-rectum, prostate, lung, breast and urinary bladder. By gender, the four most common cancers in men were those of prostate (22.4%), colon-rectum (16.6%), lung (15.1%) and urinary bladder (11.7%). In women, the most common ones were those of breast (28.0%), colon-rectum (16.9%), corpus uteri (6.2%) and lung (6.0%). In recent years, cancer incidence in men seems to have stabilized due to the fact that the decrease in tobacco-related cancers compensates for the increase in other types of cancer like those of colon and prostate. In women, despite the stabilization of breast cancer incidence, increased incidence is due, above all, to the rise of colorectal and tobacco-related cancers. To reduce these incident cancer cases, improvement of smoking control policies and extension of colorectal cancer screening should be the two priorities in cancer prevention for the next years.\n\nBusiness network and new distribution methods: the spread of franchises in Spain\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGÃ¡mir Orueta, AgustÃ­n; MÃ©ndez GutiÃ©rrez del Valle, Ricardo\n\n1999-01-01\n\nSummary: Over the last few years, the phenomenon of the franchise as a new way of doing business has been undergoing a notable increase in Spain, with year on year growth rates of around 40%.

Spain), Cannabis sativa L. (marihuana) pollen was detected from May to September 1991-1996, always sporadically and usually during the afternoons. Sampling was by two volumetric spore traps set up in Malaga and Estepona, two coastal towns approximately 90 km apart. A study of the days when this pollen was recorded points to the movement of air masses from North Africa to southern Spain. Furthermore, the isentropic air trajectories calculated for these days reinforce the possibility of the pollen originating in marihuana plantations in northern Morocco (Rif). This study demonstrates the application of aerobiology to the control of the source, quantity and phenology of the crop.\n\nNephrology around Europe: organization models and management strategies: Spain.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nde Francisco, Angel L M; PiÃ±era, Celestino\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe main aim of this report is to present a picture of the current organization of nephrology in Spain. The Spanish health system offers almost universal coverage, a wide variety of services and a high-quality network of hospitals and primary care centers. Spain has a specialized health care training system that is highly developed, highly regulated, with the capacity to provide high-quality training in 54 different specialties. Nephrology is basically a hospital-based specialty. There are no private dialysis patients in Spain. Hemodialysis centers are 40% public, 15% private and 45% run by companies. The National Health System covers 95% of the population, and there is no cost to patients for treatment of renal disease (dialysis and transplant). We observed a clear decrease of nephrology in residents' election rankings, with position 29 out of 47 specialties in 2007. Some of the reasons for this are the complexity of the subject, no clear information at the university, reduction of professional posts and a very good public service with minimal private practice. In Spain, a model of organization for transplantation was adopted based on a decentralized transplant coordinating network. For cadaveric donors, it compares favorably with rates in other Western countries. Living donor transplantation is very low in Spain--just 10% of total renal transplantation activity. New programs due to financial constraints need to include reduced dialysis costs, greater cost-effectiveness of prescriptions, better handling of ethical issues related to the need for using a clinical score of chronic kidney disease patients to make decisions about conservative or renal replacement therapy and an action plan for improvement of organ donation and transplantation. Recovery of skills (acute kidney injury, biopsies, vascular access, etc.), research and advances in autonomous activities (imaging, surgical and medical vascular training, etc.) are some of the future educational paths needed in\n\nAnalysis of patient organizations' needs and ICT use--The APTIC project in Spain to develop an online collaborative social network.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHernÃ¡ndez-Encuentra, EulÃ lia; GÃ³mez-ZÃºÃ±iga, Beni; GuillamÃ³n, NoemÃ­; BoixadÃ³s, MercÃ¨; Armayones, Manuel\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this first part of the APTIC (Patient Organisations and ICT) project is to design and run an online collaborative social network for paediatric patient organizations (PPOs). To analyse the needs of PPOs in Spain to identify opportunities to improve health services through the use of ICT. A convenience sample of staff from 35 PPOs (54.68% response rate) participated in a structured online survey and three focus groups (12 PPOs). Paediatric patient organizations' major needs are to provide accredited and managed information, increase personal support and assistance and promote joint commitment to health care. Moreover, PPOs believe in the Internet's potential to meet their needs and support their activities. Basic limitations to using the Internet are lack of knowledge and resources. The discussion of the data includes key elements of designing an online collaborative social network and reflections on health services provided.

The need to integrate a higher level of renewable resources to achieve the objectives set by the EU (the famous 20â20â20), flattening the load curve, the imminent arrival of electric vehicles, and the possibility of actively controlling all devices connected to a grid, are some examples of these new challenges. In order to maintain the stability of the distribution network, all medium-voltage lines in the city of Malaga (Spain) have been analyzed and modeled over the past five years, to optimize electric-vehicle charging with the use of available energy during the night valley using pricing signal, control of the electric vehicle charging manager and signals from the Distribution Company, with regard to grid availability (vehicle-charging posts) and available energy. The project has developed new management, control and integration systems for all elements of consumption, production and energy storage over the distribution network. All deployment within the SmartCity MÃ¡laga Project of ENDESA includes smartmeters for all customers and new automation and communication systems over the grid connected by a broadband Power Line Communication network\n\nCriminal Justice Systems in Europe.

W.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA hydrological model (YWB, yearly water balance) has been developed to model the daily rainfall-runoff relationship of the 202 km2 Teba river catchment, located in semi-arid south-eastern Spain. The period of available data (1976-1993) includes some very rainy years with intensive storms (responsible for flooding parts of the town of Malaga) and also some very dry years.The YWB model is in essence a simple tank model in which the catchment is subdivided into a limited number of meaningful hydrological units. Instead of generating per unit surface runoff resulting from infiltration excess, runoff has been made the result of storage excess. Actual evapotranspiration is obtained by means of curves, included in the software, representing the relationship between the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration as a function of soil moisture content for three soil texture classes.The total runoff generated is split between base flow and surface runoff according to a given baseflow index. The two components are routed separately and subsequently joined. A large number of sequential years can be processed, and the results of each year are summarized by a water balance table and a daily based rainfall runoff time series. An attempt has been made to restrict the amount of input data to the minimum.Interactive manual calibration is advocated in order to allow better incorporation of field evidence and the experience of the model user. Field observations allowed for an approximate calibration at the hydrological unit level.\n\nRegulatory strategies for selected Member States (Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, the UK)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNieuwenhout, F.D.J.; Jansen, J.C.; Van der Welle, A.J.

However, despite the direct relationship between economic and environmental management, few land-use plans consider the latter aspect, and city managers delegate the responsibility for environmental impacts to state legislation and private initiatives. This myopic search for competitiveness has meant that a holistic view of environmental issues is often not integrated into municipal decision-making processes. Therefore, this study's objective was to determine the relevant direct and indirect relationships of land management and budgetary procedures of municipalities with overall production levels of hazardous waste. To this end, a primary tourist region, MÃ¡laga, was examined in terms of how this waste's environmental impacts can affect the region's vital tourism sector. This research used principal component analysis, regression by ordinary least squares, cluster analysis in two stages and a means test to compare the data for the Province of Malaga's subregions. The results confirm a positive relationship between municipal expenditure and waste production and highlight the environmental benefits of land use involving environmentally non-aggressive crops. The results also reveal a negative relationship between waste production and financial assets and a direct relationship between unproductive land and the production of hazardous waste. The findings also highlight the necessity of raising awareness about the need for collaboration between different agents, especially in the development of inter-municipal strategies.\n\nSpain\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZoppo, C.E.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThis paper reports on nuclear export activities in Spain, as elsewhere, which occur in a political, economic, and technological context. The factors operating the process are not always explicitly related in the public and the private sectors, nor between these sectors, by the relevant decision makers. A redefinition of Spain's policies in the nuclear sector has been going on since at least 1984, when a new energy plan was legislated by the newly elected Socialist government. It would be accurate to suggest that this process remains dynamic and not fully completed for policy purposes. This condition has resulted from the fact that Spain underwent a crucial political regime change from dictatorship to parliamentary democracy about a decade ago, with the transition to democracy only recently consolidated. Moreover, no policy in regard to nuclear nonproliferation existed during the Franco regime. Instead, Spain's official position was to maintain the right to preserve a nuclear option for national defense. However, this option was not developed into a concerted program to develop a nuclear military capability\n\nMicroplastic sampling in the Mediterranean Sea\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBiginagwa, Fares; Sosthenes, Bahati; Syberg, Kristian\n\nThe extent of microplastic pollution in the Southwestern Mediterranean Sea is not yet known, although on Northwestern part has been previously studied.

Thus, it is possible to study risk scenarios based on events that may trigger cascading failures within a power system. The usefulness of graph theory techniques has been validated on previous works of the authors, and may be applied in analysis of the vulnerability of different power electric networks. A case study for vulnerability analysis is carried out through methodologies that allow comparison on random error and deliberate attack tolerance evaluation in transmission electric systems from countries like Colombia and Spain. Such vulnerability assessment methodology takes into account the current conditions of the power networks (base case), as well as the impact of expansion plans into infrastructures as defined by their governments. Consequently, the authors show the advantage on the use of graph theory based techniques for vulnerability analysis of electrical power systems\n\nThe European Nuclear Society Young Generation Network: Five years of networking experience\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMeskens, Gaston\n\n2000-01-01\n\nIn 1995, Mr Jan Runermark (Sweden), aware of a need for an exchange of knowledge from the older to the younger generation, came up with the idea of starting a European Nuclear Society Young Generation Network. A first network was formed with Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Finland, Germany and Belgium. The ENSYGN is now affiliated to the European Nuclear Society and brings together young students and professionals from 21 member countries Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, and United Kingdom, The ENSYGN Core group meets (at least) twice a year and elects its own chair and co chair for a term of two years. The ENSYGN chair has a seat in the ENS Steering Committee and in the ENS Board. The ENSYGN works closely together with other young generation networks from the US, Australia, Japan and South America.

This methodology is based on a neural network system [Lippmann, R.P., 1987. An introduction to computing with neural nets. IEEE ASSP Magazine, 4-22] called Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) [Haykin, S., 1994. Neural Networks. A Comprehensive Foundation. Macmillan Publishing Company; Hornik, K., Stinchcombe, M., White, H., 1989. Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators. Neural Networks, 2(5), 359-366]. To obtain a solar radiation map it is necessary to know the solar radiation of many points spread wide across the zone of the map where it is going to be drawn. For most of the locations all over the world the records of these data (solar radiation in whatever scale, daily or hourly values) are non-existent. Only very few locations have the privilege of having good meteorological stations where records of solar radiation have being registered. But even in those locations with historical records of solar data, the quality of these solar series is not as good as it should be for most purposes. In addition, to draw solar radiation maps the number of points on the maps (real sites) that it is necessary to work with makes this problem difficult to solve. Nevertheless, with the application of the methodology proposed in this paper, this problem has been solved and solar radiation maps have been obtained for a small region of Spain: Jaen province, a southern province of Spain between parallels 38{sup o}25' N and 37{sup o}25' N, and meridians 4{sup o}10' W and 2{sup o}10' W, and for a larger region: Andalucia, the most southern region of Spain situated between parallels 38{sup o}40' N and 36{sup o}00' N, and meridians 7{sup o}30' W and 1{sup o}40' W.

The country currently operates nine nuclear reactors totalling over 7,100 MWe of capacity and accounting for more than a third of Spain's electricity generation. Yet four reactors at advanced stages of construction remain mothballed due to a government-imposed moratorium, and a fire at one reactor in 1989 led to its premature closure and to a revival of anti-nuclear sentiment in the country. In the new national energy plan, Spain opted to continue the moratorium and rely upon conservation measures, additional natural gas imports, and electricity imports to meet expected demand. The current nuclear facilities will continue to operate, and the government will continue to pursue advanced reactor research, and expansion of the country's domestic uranium industry. Spain's integration into the European Community also is affecting the country's energy plans, prompting consolidation within the Spanish electricity sector in order to be more competitive in Europe\n\nLarge-scale integration of renewable and distributed generation of electricity in Spain: Current situation and future needs\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCossent, Rafael; GÃ³mez, TomÃ¡s; Olmos, Luis\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSimilar to other European countries, mechanisms for the promotion of electricity generation from renewable energy sources (RESs) and combined heat and power (CHP) production have caused a significant growth in distributed generation (DG) in Spain. Low DG/RES penetration levels do not have a major impact on electricity systems. However, several problems arise as DG shares increase. Smarter distribution grids are deemed necessary to facilitate DG/RES integration. This involves modifying the way distribution networks are currently planned and operated. Furthermore, DG and demand should also adopt a more active role. This paper reviews the current situation of DG/RES in Spain including penetration rates, support payments for DG/RES, level of market integration, economic regulation of Distribution System Operators (DSOs), smart metering implementation, grid operation and planning, and incentives for DSO innovation. This paper identifies several improvements that could be made to the treatment of DG/RES. Key aspects of an efficient DG/RES integration are identified and several regulatory changes specific to the Spanish situation are recommended. - Highlights: âº Substantial DG/RES penetration levels are foreseen for the coming years in Spain. âº Integrating such amount of DG/RES in electricity markets and networks is challenging. âº We review key regulatory aspects that may affect DG/RES integration in Spain. âº Several recommendations aimed at easing DG/RES integration in Spain are provided. âº Market integration and the transition towards smarter grids are deemed key issues.\n\nRegulation of electricity distribution in Spain.

In the second part, this paper reviews the current situation of electricity distribution regulation in Spain highlighting its main shortcomings. Finally, some guidelines for the design of a new remuneration model for each distribution company are proposed. This new regulatory model will increase efficiency, promoting the required investment for improving quality of supply and reducing energy losses. This model is based on two new regulatory tools: regulatory accounting and network reference models. (Author) 15 refs\n\nNetworks and Collaboration in"
