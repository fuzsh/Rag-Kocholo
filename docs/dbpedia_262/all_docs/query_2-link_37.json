        "text": "Spanish football manager (born 1982)\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is Iraola and the second or maternal family name is Sagarna.\n\nAndoni Iraola Sagarna (Basque pronunciation: [andoni iɾa.ola s̺aɣarna], Spanish: [anˈdoni iɾaˈola saˈɣaɾna]; born 22 June 1982) is a Spanish professional football manager and former player who is the current manager of Premier League club AFC Bournemouth.\n\nUtilised primarily as a right-back through his career, he was highly combative and possessed good passing skills. He spent the vast majority of his professional career with Athletic Bilbao,[2] appearing in 510 competitive matches over 12 seasons.[3]\n\nIraola began managing in 2018, being in charge of Rayo Vallecano for three years. In 2023, he was appointed as manager of Premier League club Bournemouth.\n\nPlaying career\n\n[edit]\n\nClub\n\n[edit]\n\nAthletic Bilbao\n\n[edit]\n\nIraola was born in Usurbil, Gipuzkoa.[4] He played as a youth for Antiguoko,[5] alongside teammates such as Mikel Arteta, Xabi Alonso, Mikel Alonso and Aritz Aduriz.[6] A product of Athletic Bilbao's youth system at Lezama, he made his debut with the first team in the 2003–04 season, becoming first-choice while often taking penalties and free kicks.[7][8][9] On 30 August 2003, he made his first La Liga appearance, starting in a 1–0 home loss against Barcelona,[10] and his five goals in 30 appearances helped the team to qualify for the UEFA Cup.[1]\n\nDuring his 12 seasons, Iraola never played fewer than 30 league matches, scoring in all but one league campaign – like former club legend Aitor Larrazábal, who played as a left-back[3][11]– while also helping the Basque side to finish second in three Copa del Rey tournaments and the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League. On 28 January 2007, he netted twice in a 2–0 away win over neighbours Real Sociedad, who were finally relegated; Athletic narrowly avoided the drop, ranking in 17th position.[12] He played his first cup final in 2009, a 4–1 loss to Barcelona at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia,[13] and three years later helped them to finish runners-up in both the domestic cup[14] and the Europa League.[15]\n\n2012–13 marked the first year where Iraola failed to find the net in the league, but he continued to be the side's first-choice in his position as he featured in 35 games. His only goal of the season came on 24 August 2012 in a 6–0 home rout of HJK in the playoff round of the UEFA Europa League (9–3 on aggregate).[16]\n\nIraola renewed his contract with the club on 4 December 2013, keeping him at the San Mamés until 30 June 2015.[17] In the 24th minute of his last league appearance against Villarreal in May 2015, Aritz Aduriz offered him the taking of a penalty kick but he declined, so the former converted it instead; the two players then combined for Iraola to score from open play four minutes later.[18] He captained the team in his last match, the 2015 Copa del Rey final which was lost 3–1 to Barcelona.[19]\n\nNew York City FC\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 16 June 2015, aged 33, Iraola moved abroad for the first time in his career, signing for Major League Soccer club New York City FC.[20][21] He made his debut against Toronto FC at the Yankee Stadium on 12 July, playing the entirety of a 4–4 draw.[22]\n\nIraola announced his retirement on 17 November 2016.[23][24]\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 20 August 2008, Iraola was called by new Spain coach Vicente del Bosque for a friendly with Denmark, alongside teammate Fernando Amorebieta.[25] He entered the pitch in the final 15 minutes of the 3–0 away victory, coming in as a substitute for Sergio Ramos.[26]\n\nOn 29 March 2011, after nearly one and a half years without playing for the national team, Iraola started in a 3–1 defeat of Lithuania in Kaunas for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifiers.[27] He was due to make the cut for the final squad, but injury forced him out in favour of Atlético Madrid's Juanfran.[28]\n\nIraola played on the Basque representative side for a full decade, having debuted late on in a 2–1 win over Uruguay on 27 December 2003.[29][30]\n\nCoaching career\n\n[edit]\n\nAEK Larnaca\n\n[edit]\n\nIraola was appointed manager of Cypriot club AEK Larnaca on 18 June 2018, succeeding his compatriot Imanol Idiakez.[31] He was sacked the following 14 January,[32] after nearly two months without winning a single match.[33]\n\nMirandés\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 10 July 2019, Iraola replaced the departed Borja Jiménez at the helm of Mirandés, newly promoted to Segunda División.[34] He took the team to the semi-finals of the Spanish Cup for the second time in their 92-year history, notably disposing of top-tier sides Celta, Sevilla and Villarreal.[35] On 21 July 2020, he left the club as his contract expired.[36]\n\nRayo Vallecano\n\n[edit]\n\nIraola remained in the second division in August 2020, taking over from Paco Jémez at Rayo Vallecano.[37] On 6 July 2021, after achieving promotion in the playoffs, he extended his contract until 2022.[38] The following season, he again led a club to the last four of the national cup; it was the second time Rayo had achieved this, the first occasion coming 40 years earlier.[39]\n\nIn February 2023, Iraola was approached by Leeds United of the Premier League, but was not given permission to leave the Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas.[40] He left at the end of the campaign, having turned down a renewal offer.[41]\n\nAFC Bournemouth\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 19 June 2023, Iraola was appointed manager of AFC Bournemouth on a two-year deal.[42] His first match in charge was a 1–1 home draw with West Ham United on 12 August, in which Dominic Solanke scored a late equaliser.[43] He achieved his first win in the tenth league round, beating Burnley 2–1 with goals from Antoine Semenyo and Philip Billing.[44]\n\nIraola extended his contract with the club on 13 May 2024, until 2026.[45] His Cherries team finished the season with a best-ever 48 points, in 12th place.[46]\n\nManagerial style\n\n[edit]\n\nIraola favours a 4–3–3/4–3–2–1 formation with a focus on quick ball recoveries. With quick wingers, tireless midfield runners and a defensive midfielder who tends to drop deep when building from the back when the full-backs push forward, his main emphasis is on catching the opposition off guard.[47]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nClub\n\n[edit]\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition[48][49][50] Club Season League National cup[a] Continental Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Basconia 2000–01 Tercera División 35 4 – – – 35 4 Bilbao Athletic 2001–02 Segunda División 38 5 – – – 38 5 2002–03 Segunda División 37 10 – – – 37 10 Total 75 15 – – – 75 15 Athletic Bilbao 2003–04 La Liga 30 5 1 0 – – 31 5 2004–05 La Liga 34 4 7 1 8[b] 1 – 49 6 2005–06 La Liga 38 3 4 0 – – 42 3 2006–07 La Liga 35 5 2 0 – – 37 5 2007–08 La Liga 36 1 5 1 – – 41 2 2008–09 La Liga 33 6 8 0 – – 41 6 2009–10 La Liga 37 2 2 0 11[c] 0 2[d] 0 52 2 2010–11 La Liga 37 4 4 0 – – 41 4 2011–12 La Liga 35 1 9 0 15[c] 0 – 59 1 2012–13 La Liga 35 0 1 0 7[c] 1 – 43 1 2013–14 La Liga 34 1 6 0 0 0 – 40 1 2014–15 La Liga 22 1 6 0 5[c] 1 – 33 2 Total 406 33 56 2 46 3 2 0 510 38 New York City FC 2015 Major League Soccer 9 0 0 0 – – 9 0 2016 Major League Soccer 29 0 0 0 – 2[e] 0 31 0 Total 38 0 0 0 – 2 0 40 0 Career total 554 52 56 2 46 3 4 0 660 57\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[51] National team Year Apps Goals Spain 2008 2 0 2009 2 0 2011 3 0 Total 7 0\n\nManagerial statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of match played 19 May 2024\n\nManagerial record by team and tenure Team From To Record Ref.
