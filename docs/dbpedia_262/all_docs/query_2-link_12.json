        "text": "The town's name takes its name from the presence in the municipal area of a watercourse. In the province of Oristano, Riola Sardo is located on the Sinai Peninsula, in a large plain, surrounded on three sides by the Rio Mare Foghe. Near the village there are several areas of natural interest, while near the coast, worth of a visit are the cliffs of Roia of Su Cantaru and those of Su Cuccuru Mannu.\n\nThe archaeological remains preserved, attest the presence of a settlement since the Nuragic Ages, while Punic traces attest to the conquest of the area by the troops of Carthage. The centre was built in the present location for the presence of the river, which was an obstacle to enemy attacks and at the same time a defense for the inhabitants. The area was later colonized by the Romans and then became part of the Parish of Campidano Maggiore. Around year 450 A. D. the territories were conquered by the Vandals and later the Byzantines until in the late Middle Ages it was proclaimed Villa. During the Spanish domination, the town experienced a difficult period because of famines and epidemics that decimated the population. Even after a period of recovery and development, Riola Sardo submitted a new era of depopulation, due to the frequent pirate raids, who were not hindered even by the several watchtowers built along the coast in the meantime. In the XVIII century it became a fief under the domain of the Marquis D'Arcais.\n\nAttractions:\n\n- the Church of Santa Corona, now reduced to ruins. The exact date of construction is unknown, but documents attest its existence in the XII century and recently has been linked by some scholars to the Templar Knights. Even though the building was restored in the XVII century, it was abandoned in the XX century and at present remain only parts of the nave, including a decorative element that was added at a later date of its original construction;\n\n- the Parish Church of San Martino, which was built in the XVI century on the remains of an earlier building. It is preceded by a staircase and features three naves and several portal entrances. The bell tower, which flanks the church, dates back to the XVII century. Inside are preserved a XVIII century wooden crucifix, a XIX century wooden choir and the precious fonts;\n\n- the Nuraghe of Civas and Predi Madau;\n\n- the XVIII century Paper House."
