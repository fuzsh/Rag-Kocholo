        "text": "Herpes zoster surveillance using electronic databases in the Valencian Community (Spain)\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Epidemiologic data of Herpes Zoster (HZ) disease in Spain are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess the epidemiology of HZ in the Valencian Community (Spain), using outpatient and hospital electronic health databases. Methods Data from 2007 to 2010 was collected from computerized health databases of a population of around 5 million inhabitants. Diagnoses were recorded by physicians using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). A sample of medical records under different criteria was reviewed by a general practitioner, to assess the reliability of codification. Results The average annual incidence of HZ was 4.60 per 1000 persons-year (PY) for all ages (95% CI: 4.57-4.63), is more frequent in women [5.32/1000PY (95% CI: 5.28-5.37)] and is strongly age-related, with a peak incidence at 70-79 years. A total of 7.16/1000 cases of HZ required hospitalization. Conclusions Electronic health database used in the Valencian Community is a reliable electronic surveillance tool for HZ disease and will be useful to define trends in disease burden before and after HZ vaccine introduction.

The aim of this study to analyze the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a meningitis outbreak detected in Health Department 11 of the Valencian Community (Spain). The study was performed in children hospitalized between November and December 2006 with meningitis symptoms, CSF pleocytosis, and negative CSF bacteriological culture. An epidemiological survey was conducted among cases and family members. Virus detection and phylogenetic analysis were performed with molecular biology techniques. The outbreak affected at least 44 children, with a mean age (standard deviation) of 5.5 years (2.9). The average hospital stay was 3.1 days and outcome was favorable in all cases. In 24 patients the CSF specimen sufficed for viral detection by PCR; enteroviruses ultimately serotyped as echovirus 30 were detected in 12 of them (50%). This serotype has been recently found in other parts of our country. Detection of echovirus 30 in CSF and the epidemiological presentation of cases enabled determination of the etiology of the outbreak. This finding coincided in time with other outbreaks of echovirus 30 in Spain, a fact that may explain the epidemic situation in the Valencian Community during 2006. Establishment of a national surveillance network for monitoring systemic enterovirus infection would provide data on the circulation patterns and identify new emerging serotypes.\n\nAssessment of the Microbiological Quality of Groundwater in Three Regions of the Valencian Community (Spain)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLlopis-GonzÃ¡lez, AgustÃ­n; SÃ¡nchez, Adriana L.; Requena, Pedro MartÃ­; SuÃ¡rez-Varela, MarÃ­a Morales\n\n2014-01-01\n\nUrban groundwater development was traditionally constrained by concerns about its quality. This study was conducted in the regions of La Ribera Alta and Ribera Baja and La Plana de Requena-Utiel of the Valencian Community (Valencia, Spain) where population density, demand for drinking water and agricultural activities are high. Groundwater bodies (GWBs) are regarded as management areas within each territory, and were used to establish protection policies. This study analyzed eleven GWBs. We used two databases with microbiological measurements from 154 wells over a 7-year period (2004â2011), risk factors and groundwater information. Wells were grouped according to frequency of microbiological contamination using E. coli measurements, category <1, or wells with low-frequency microbiological contamination and high-frequency wells or category 1â100, according to World Health Organization (WHO) quality criteria of drinking water. Of all wells, 18.12% showed high-frequency microbiological contamination with a majority distribution in the Ribera Alta region (26.98%, p < 0.001). No significant differences were found between the two risk categories for flow, static level, well depth and distance from population centres. This paper reveals that the vulnerability classes established by the Geological and Mining Institute of Spain (IGME) do not match the microbiological results, and that only eight wells with high-frequency contamination coincide with the high vulnerability areas.

In total c. 40 million trees, mainly of sweet orange and mandarin grafted on sour orange rootstocks, declined due to CTV. Large-scale surveys in different municipalities of the VC indicated that the disease spread very fast. Incidence increased from 11% in 1989 to 53% in 1998. Toxoptera aurantii and Aphis spiraecola (inefficient aphid vectors of CTV) predominated before 1985-87. Since then the relatively efficient vector Aphis gossypii has become dominant and induced an epidemic that has been modelled. The large number of A.gossypii that visited each clementine tree (estimated to exceed 97000 per year) explained the difference between the temporal pattern of spread of CTV in clementine which followed the Gompertz model and that in sweet orange (logistic model). The susceptibility of the different citrus species to CTV infection by aphids seems to depend on the number of young, succulent shoots produced. The epidemiological data allowed specific recommendations to be made to growers in order to facilitate a change to a modern citrus industry based on the use of selected varieties grafted on tristeza-tolerant rootstocks produced within a certification scheme. This has been done already in almost 90% of the VC citrus-growing area. The tristeza problem has been solved unless more aggressive isolates are introduced and become prevalent.\n\n[Public health service prescriptions of vaccines not included in systematic vaccination programs in Valencian community, Spain, during the period 2004-2009].\n\nPubMed\n\nRuiz Palacio, Ana; Pastor Villalba, Eliseo; MartÃ­n Ivorra, Rosa; Alguacil Ramos, Ana MarÃ­a; Portero Alonso, Antonio; Lluch Rodrigo, JosÃ© Antonio\n\n2011-06-01\n\nIn the context of the policies of rational use of medicine, and in order to achieve an efficient management of the vaccinations programs, we expect to know the number of packings and cost of prescribed vaccines not included in the vaccination programs of Valencian Community and its departments during 2009 and to analyze its evolution since 2004, focusing on an analysis of Heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children under two years old.

Gestor de PrestaciÃ³n FarmacÃ©utica (GAIA) and Sistema InformaciÃ³n Poblacional (SIP). In 2009 prescribed vaccines on official national health system prescription forms that are not included in vaccination programs, supposed a cost of 683.445,71 â¬ corresponding to 17.353 packings (87% of the total prescribed vaccines). Heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine generated 72% of the total cost of vaccines not included in the vaccination programs. The trend from 2004 to 2009 shows an increase in expenditure of 735.334 â¬ (24,66%) in 2005 from which there takes place a marked and gradual decrease that reaches 1.562.650,67 â¬ (-228.64%). The cost by departments of prescriptions per 1000 children under two years old of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ranges between 17.377 and 324 â¬. The declining trend of prescriptions, mainly of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, continues during 2009. A great interdepartmental variability is observed, nevertheless, in rates of prescription that should be corrected.\n\nInformed participation in the Valencian Community Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme from a gender perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nMolina-BarcelÃ³, Ana; PeirÃ³-PÃ©rez, Rosana; Vanaclocha, Mercedes; VallÃ©s, Guillermo; Guaita, Laura; Salas, Dolores\n\nTo examine the factors that influence informed participation in a Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme (CRCSP) from a gender perspective. Cross-sectional telephone survey directed to men and women invited to participate (2009-2010) in the Valencian Community CRCSP (Spain). 785 subjects. participation in CRCSP and being informed. Bivariate and multivariate analysis using logistic regression models (95% confidence interval [95%CI], p <0.05). Being a woman (odds ratio [OR]: 1.52; 95%CI: 1.06-2.19), receiving information from a general practitioner (OR: 1.64; 95%CI: 1.05-2.55) and being informed (OR: 1.54; 95%CI: 1.08-2.21) are related to participation. Men are more likely to participate if they live with a partner (OR: 6.26; 95%CI: 1.82-21.49); and are more informed if they have family responsibilities (OR: 2.53; 95%CI: 1.39-4.63). Information about CRCSP, involving primary health care professionals and including specific actions directed at men and at women, could contribute to improve informed participation with a gender equity perspective.

Twenty-four samples of potato crisps and 15 samples of snack foods were analyzed. The results were compared with those from the Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Authority. The mean (SD) acrylamide level in the Valencian Community was 916 (656) microg/kg in potato crisps and 262 (346) microg/kg in snack foods. Significant differences were found in the 3 populations compared. Acrylamide levels in potato crisps in the Valencian Community were the highest. There was wide variation in acrylamide content for the same type of product. Further investigation into methods of sampling and analysis and steps to reduce acrylamide levels are required.\n\n[Characteristics of communication systems of suspected occupational disease in the Autonomous Communities, Spain].\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a GÃ³mez, Montserrat; Urbaneja ArrÃºe, FÃ©lix; GarcÃ­a LÃ³pez, Vega; Estaban Buedo, ValentÃ­n; RodrÃ­guez SuÃ¡rez, ValentÃ­n; Miralles MartÃ­nez-Portillo, Lourdes; GonzÃ¡lez GarcÃ­a, Isabel; Egea Garcia, Josefa; Corraliza Infanzon, Emma; RamÃ­rez Salvador, Laura; Briz BlÃ¡zquez, Santiago; Armengol Rosell, Ricard; Cisnal Gredilla, JosÃ© MarÃ­a; Correa RodrÃ­guez, Juan Francisco; Coto FernÃ¡ndez, Juan Carlos; DÃ­az Peral, MÂª Rosario; Elvira Espinosa, Mercedes; FernÃ¡ndez FernÃ¡ndez, IÃ±igo; GarcÃ­a-Ramos Alonso, Eduardo; MartÃ­nez Arguisuelas, Nieves; Rivas PÃ©rez, Ana Isabel\n\n2017-03-17\n\nThere are several initiatives to develop systems for the notification of suspected occupational disease (OD) in different autonomous communities. The objective was to describe the status of development and characteristics of these systems implemented by the health authorities. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on the existence of systems for the information and surveillance of suspected OD, their legal framework, responsible institution and availability of information. A specific meeting was held and a survey was designed and sent to all autonomous communities and autonomous cities (AACC). Information was collected on the existence of a regulatory standard, assigned human resources, notifiers, coverage and number of suspected OD received, processed and recognized. 18 of 19 AACC responded. 10 have developed a suspected OD notification system, 3 of them supported by specific autonomic law. The notifiers were physicians of the public health services, physicians of the occupational health services and, in 2 cases, medical inspectors. 7 AACC had specific software to support the system. The OD recognition rate of suspected cases was 53% in the Basque Country; 41% in Castilla-La Mancha; 36% in Murcia; 32.6% in the Valencian Community and 31% in La Rioja. The study has revealed an heterogeneous development of suspected OD reporting systems in Spain. Although the trend is positive, only 55% of the AACC have some type of development and 39% have specific software supporting it. Therefore unequal OD recognition rates have been obtained depending on the territory.\n\nUpdated distribution of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Spain: new findings in the mainland Spanish Levante, 2013.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlarcÃ³n-Elbal, Pedro MarÃ­a; Estrella, Sarah Delacour; Arrondo, Ignacio Ruiz; Collantes, Francisco; Iniesta, Juan Antonio Delgado; Morales-Bueno, JosÃ©; SÃ¡nchez-LÃ³pez, Pedro Francisco; Amela, Carmen; Sierra-Moros, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; Molina, Ricardo; Lucientes, Javier\n\n2014-09-09\n\nIn 2004, Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse, 1894) was observed for the first time in Catalonia, northeastern Spain.

This study aimed to assess Salmonella carriage by turtles in pet stores and in private ownership to inform the public of the potential health risk, enabling informed choices around pet selection. During the period between September and October 2013, 24 pet stores and 96 private owners were sampled in the Valencian Region (Eastern Spain). Salmonella identification procedure was based on ISO 6579: 2002 recommendations (Annex D). Salmonella strains were serotyped in accordance with Kauffman-White-Le-Minor technique. The rate of isolation of Salmonella was very high from pet store samples (75.0%âÂ±â8.8%) and moderate for private owners (29.0%âÂ±â4.6%). Serotyping revealed 18 different serotypes among two Salmonella enterica subspecies: S. enterica subsp. enterica and S. enterica subsp. diarizonae. Most frequently isolated serotypes were Salmonella Typhimurium (39.5%, 17/43) and Salmonella Pomona (9.3%, 4/43). Serotypes identified have previously been reported in turtles, and child Salmonella infections associate with pet turtle exposure. The present study clearly demonstrates that turtles in pet stores, as well as in private owners, could be a direct or indirect source of a high risk of human Salmonella infections. In addition, pet stores should advise their customers of the potential risks associated with reptile ownership.\n\n[Adverse reactions to human papillomavirus vaccine in the Valencian Community (2007-2011)].\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrÃ­guez-GalÃ¡n, M A; PÃ©rez-Vilar, S; DÃ­ez-Domingo, J; Tuells, J; Gomar-Fayos, J; Morales-Olivas, F; Pastor-Villalba, E\n\n2014-11-01\n\nIn 2009, two cases of seizures in adolescents following quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (qHPV) administration, generated important media attention, and adversely affected public trust in this vaccine. Our objectives were to describe suspected adverse reactions (SARs) reported to the Pharmacovigilance Centre in the Valencian Community (PCVC) after administration of HPV vaccine, and to compare reporting rates of syncope and seizures following this vaccine with those of other vaccines administered to girls aged 13-15 years. Descriptive study of SARs reported following this vaccine to the PCVC between 2007 and 2011. The clinical symptoms most frequently reported were dizziness, headache, and syncope. Reporting rates of syncope or loss of consciousness and seizures with qHPV vaccine were 17 and 3.2 per 100,000 doses administered, respectively, and 15 and 1.6 for syncope or loss of consciousness and syncopal seizures occurred on the day of vaccination. The reporting rates of syncope or loss of consciousness and seizures were 6.4 and 0.4, for the other vaccines. Consistent with the media attention generated, and with results from other studies, the reporting rates of syncope or loss of consciousness and seizures were higher for the HPV vaccine than for other vaccines given in adolescence. Nevertheless, the overall information obtained on SARs following the qHPV vaccine suggests a good safety profile. Copyright Â© 2013 AsociaciÃ³n EspaÃ±ola de PediatrÃ­a. Published by Elsevier Espana.

Population-based study using health databases. Valencian Community (Spain). All girls and women aged 14-19years who were registered in the Valencian Community between January 2009 and December 2014 (n=279,787). Incident cases of genital warts were defined as the first activation of diagnosis code ICD-9-CM 078.11 (Condyloma acuminatum) in primary care and outpatient clinics during the study period. There were 612 cases of genital warts. The overall incidence rate was 75.8/100,000 person-years (95% CrI 69.7-81.8). There was a decrease in genital warts when female candidates to be vaccinated with quadrivalent HPV vaccine reached the age of 18 (in 2012), compared to previous years. Incidence of genital warts in unvaccinated women and those who received the bivalent vaccine was higher than in girls and women who received the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. The effectiveness of a three-dose regimen of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was 77% (95 CrI: 66-85%), whereas that of a single dose was 61% (95 CrI: 20-87%). No effectiveness was seen with a full vaccination course with the bivalent HPV vaccine. Three doses of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine were effective against genital warts in our population. Moreover, with low vaccine coverage the incidence of genital warts decreased only in the vaccinated. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Descriptive and analytical study on a population of specialist nurse members of with the Valencian Primary Nurse Society. Measured with anonymous self-administered questionnaire on activities implemented and turnaround time in the training period. The questionnaire was conducted and reviewed based on the training programme of the specialty. Sixteen of the 41 specialists responded. The four year groups of nurses who had finished their training were represented as well as seven national teaching units. The results show high heterogeneity in the activities developed in the training. The average rotation in public health is 7.07 weeks, with range of 0 to 16 weeks. The mean number of educational sessions is 2.69 in the two years. The average number of research projects is 1.19. The result shows a specialisation process with training gaps in the skills of research and public health that could be remedied. Some practitioners claim that they finish their specialisation without undertaking research activities or completing the minimum proposed shifts. There is no process of improvement in the four year groups studied. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

J.\n\n2011-11-01\n\nIn the last decade, the development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has imply a significant change in the traditional distance learning and specifically in e-learning. The new tools developed are consolidating the online learning modality at the university level all over the world and in all disciplines.In this study, we present the case of the Master of Astronomy and Astrophysics which is running from 2010 in the Valencian International University (http://www.viu.es). Unlike other more consolidated distance universities in Spain, the teaching method which has opted in this case includes an element of presence via webcam. This method could be considered as a kind of blended learning, combining the advantages of traditional e-learning with the humanity of personal and direct contact with the students.The results of participation in the master beyond the initial expectations with 37 students enrolled, of which approximately 80% were Spanish and the other 20% were mostly from Latin American countries. The feedback provided by students in the first months of teaching appreciates favorably the presence component, while casting doubt on the usefulness of certain tools traditionally used in the field of e-learning.\n\nEpidemiology and cost of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia among patients treated in primary care centres in the valencian community of Spain\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Data on the epidemiology and costs related to herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in Spain are scarce; therefore, studies are needed to evaluate the epidemiological and economic impact of HZ and its most common complication, PHN. The present study aimed to estimate the clinical and economic burden of HZ and PHN in Valencia (Spain). Methods We prospectively analyzed the burden of HZ and PHN and their attributable costs in patients from 25 general practices in the Autonomous Community of Valencia serving 36,030 persons aged > 14 years. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of HZ who attended these centers between December 1st 2006 and November 30th 2007 were asked to participate. Patients included were followed for 1 year. Results Of the 130 cases of HZ followed up, continued pain was experienced by 47.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 35.6-56.7%) at 1 month after rash onset, by 14.5% (95% CI = 7.8-1.2%) at 3 months, by 9.0% (95% CI = 3.7-14.3%) at 6 months, and by 5.9% (95% CI = 1.5-10.3%) at 12 months. The percentage of patients with PHN increased with age, from 21.4% (95% CI = 8.3-40) in patients < 50 years to 59.2% (95% CI = 44.4-74) in patients â¥ 70 years. The estimated total cost for the 130 HZ cases during the follow-up period was â¬49,160 ($67,349). Mean cost per patient was â¬378 (range 53-2,830) ($517, range 73-3,877). Conclusions This study shows that PHN is a relatively common complication of HZ and that both conditions combined give rise to a significant clinical and economic burden for patients and providers.

In the Valencian Community (Mediterranean coast of Spain), it is especially important because agriculture and forest biomass exploitation are two of the main economic activities in the region. More than 44% of the total area is under agriculture and 52% is forested. The frequently arid or semi-arid climate with rainfall concentrated in few events, usually in the autumn and spring, scarcity of vegetation cover, and eroded and shallow soils in several areas lead to soil degradation processes. These processes, mainly water erosion and salinization, can be intense in many locations within the Valencian Community. Evaluation of soil degradation on a regional scale is important because degradation is incompatible with sustainable development. Policy makers involved in land use planning require tools to evaluate soil degradation so they can go on to develop measures aimed at protecting and conserving soils. In this study, a methodology to evaluate physical, chemical and biological soil degradation in a GIS-based approach was developed for the Valencian Community on a 1/200,000 scale. The information used in this study was obtained from two different sources: (i) a soil survey with more than 850 soil profiles sampled within the Valencian Community, and (ii) the environmental information implemented in the Geo-scientific map of the Valencian Community digitised on an Arc/Info GIS. Maps of physical, chemical and biological soil degradation in the Valencian Community on a 1/200,000 scale were obtained using the methodology devised. These maps can be used to make a cost-effective evaluation of soil degradation on a regional scale. Around 29% of the area corresponding to the Valencian Community is affected by high to very high physical soil degradation, 36% by high to very high biological degradation, and 6% by high to very high chemical degradation. It is, therefore, necessary to draw up legislation and to\n\n[Direct hospitalization costs associated with chronic Hepatitis C in the Valencian Community in 2013].\n\nPubMed\n\nBarrachina MartÃ­nez, Isabel; Giner DurÃ¡n, Remedios; Vivas-Consuelo, David; LÃ³pez Rodado, Antonio; Maldonado Segura, JosÃ© Alberto\n\n2018-04-23\n\nHospital costs associated with Chronic Hepatitis C (HCC) arise in the final stages of the disease.

The costs were considered according to the rates established for the DRG (Diagnosis related group) associated with the episodes with diagnosis of hepatitis C. The average survival of patients since the onset of the decom- pensation of their cirrhosis was estimated by a Markov model, according to the probabilities of evolution of the disease existing in Literatura. There were 4,486 hospital episodes, 1,108 due to complications of HCC, which generated 6,713 stays, readmission rate of 28.2% and mortality of 10.2%. The hospital cost amounted to 8,788,593EUR: 3,306,333EUR corresponded to Cirrhosis (5,273EUR/patient); 1,060,521EUR to Carcinoma (6,350EUR/ patient) and 2,962,873EUR to transplantation (70,544EUR/paciente. Comorbidity was 1,458,866EUR. These costs are maintai- ned for an average of 4 years once the cirrhosis decompensation begins. Cirrhosis due to HCC generates a very high hospitalization's costs. The methodology used in the estimation of these costs from the DRG can be very useful to evaluate the trend and economic impact of this disease.\n\nTransformational leadership in the local police in Spain: a leader-follower distance approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nÃlvarez, Octavio; Lila, Marisol; TomÃ¡s, InÃ©s; Castillo, Isabel\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBased on the transformational leadership theory (Bass, 1985), the aim of the present study was to analyze the differences in leadership styles according to the various leading ranks and the organizational follower-leader distance reported by a representative sample of 975 local police members (828 male and 147 female) from Valencian Community (Spain). Results showed differences by rank (p < .01), and by rank distance (p < .05). The general intendents showed the most optimal profile of leadership in all the variables examined (transformational-leadership behaviors, transactional-leadership behaviors, laissez-faire behaviors, satisfaction with the leader, extra effort by follower, and perceived leadership effectiveness). By contrast, the least optimal profiles were presented by intendents. Finally, the maximum distance (five ranks) generally yielded the most optimal profiles, whereas the 3-rank distance generally produced the least optimal profiles for all variables examined. Outcomes and practical implications for the workforce dimensioning are also discussed.\n\nX-ray fluorescence analysis of yellow pigments in altarpieces by Valencian artists of the XV and XVI centuries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFerrero, J. L.; RoldÃ¡n, C.; Ardid, M.; Navarro, E.\n\n1999-02-01\n\nXRF analysis has allowed a quick and precise detection and identification of the inorganic elements that compose the yellow pigments in altarpieces of the XV and XVI centuries painted by the Valencian artists Miguel AlcaÃ±iz, Vicente Macip, Juan de Juanes, Hernando YÃ¡Ã±ez de la Almedina and Hernando Llanos. The analyses have been carried out with an XRF portable system that consists of a tube of X-rays and detectors of Si(Li) and cadmium zinc telluride. This system has enabled a non-aggressive and non-destructive analysis of many pieces at the Museo de Bellas Artes of Valencia (Spain). Among the yellow pigments we have identified a pigment composed by lead and tin oxides named lead-tin yellow (Pb 2SnO 4), frequently used in European paintings from the XIV century until the first half of the XVIII century. This fact demonstrates the influence of elements and pictorial techniques from Europe to the region of Valencia.\n\nAdjustment Problems in the Family and School Contexts, Attitude towards Authority, and Violent Behavior at School in Adolescence\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOchoa, Gonzalo Musitu; Lopez, Estefania Estevez; Emler, Nicholas P.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis study analyzed the role of different but interrelated variables in the family and school contexts in relation to problems of violent behavior at school during adolescence.

Floro; Fornos PÃ©rez, JosÃ© Antonio\n\nOnly one study evaluated the scientific activity in community pharmacies in Spain, and it was restricted to articles published in just two journals. Objective To assess the scientific activity in community pharmacies in Spain through a bibliometric analysis of the original papers published during the years 1995-2005. Methods IPA, MEDLINE, CSIC database and the journals Seguimiento FarmacoterapÃ©utico y Pharmaceutical Care EspaÃ±a were used as data sources. Production indicators, consumption indicators and the impact factor (IF) as a repercussion index were analyzed. Results 122 articles were included in the review. The articles were published in 12 journals, 78.7% of them in Pharmaceutical Care EspaÃ±a and Seguimiento FarmacoterapÃ©utico. The mean number of authors per article was 4.2 (SD=2.1). The transitivity index was 71.3%. The total number of references cited in the articles was 2110. The mean number of references per article was 17.3 SD=9.3. The value of the insularity index was 57.6%. Self citation was 6.8% and the Price index was 66.5%. No impact factor was available for 6 journals. Conclusions Publication of articles on community pharmacy-based research in Spain has undergone an important increase in the last 5 years. The existence of authors who publish very few studies, the high insularity index and the lack of randomized, controlled trials may be considered as negative indicators in community pharmacy-based research in Spain.

The height data of 82,039 conscripts constitute the principal source for this analysis. The study area comprises the current Valencian region, located in central Mediterranean Spain. During the period under study, the average height of conscripts increased by 7.5cm, while the coefficient of variation decreased by 0.6 between the 1870s and 1930 indicating that height inequality declined, although it increased by 0.2 among the cohorts born during the period of Francoist regime. Our results show that, in the long run, the height and biological well-being of the populations conscripted in Mediterranean Spain were determined by socioeconomic status and environmental contexts: that there was a close correlation among education, occupation, income, and stature. Literate conscripts were always taller than illiterate ones (by nearly 1cm), and agricultural workers, with fewer economic resources, were significantly shorter (by 3.6cm) than highly qualified non-manual workers.

However, there are still major obstacles to full development, some of them linked to gender. It is therefore important to analyse the historical background of this situation in Spain in order to gain a better understanding of the many problems and shortcomings that still persist in Community Nursing today. Community nurses contributed to the development of Public Health in contemporary Spain, starting in the 1920s and culminating in the Second Republic. However, the Franco regime brought a halt to the process of professionalisation. By analysing the public conflict between visiting female nurses and practicantes (professional male medical auxiliary technicians) during the Second Republic and throughout the Franco regime, we examine the impact of gender on the development of nursing in Spain as one of the conditioning factors, and how it continues to influence the structuring of competencies and the distribution of responsibilities and power in this field.

Evidence from the UK and Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nLluch, Maria; Kanavos, Panos\n\n2010-05-01\n\nIn this paper, we focus on regulatory restrictions on Community Pharmacies and whether these have an impact on efficiency, access and equity and thus in the delivery of services community pharmacists provide to patients. Primary data collection through semi-structured interviews and secondary data collection through literature review have been used with a particular focus on Spain (a country where Community Pharmacy is strictly regulated) and the UK (a country where Community Pharmacy is considered liberalised by EU standards). The findings indicate that improved pharmacy operational efficiency is the result of appropriate incentive structures, ownership liberalisation and OTC price freedom as is the case in the UK. Equity and access seem to be better achieved by establishing geographic, demographic or needs-based criteria to open new pharmacies (as is the case in Spain). In sum, there are useful lessons for both countries: the UK could look into the policies applied in Spain that increase access and equity whilst Spain could adopt some of the policies from the UK to increase efficiency in the system.

During the last century, the export of ValÃ¨ncia's oranges contributed to a high income in Spain albeit during the last decade the revenues for the small farmers were short (Bono, 2010). The orange agricultural specialization in ValÃ¨ncia begun at the end of the eighteenth century in the town of Carcaixent, close to the XÃºquer river, where the first commercial orange groves were planted. This was due to the climatic conditions (no frosts) and the traditional flood irrigation systems. The orange trade was not important until the second half of the nineteenth century, due to a combination of factors: i) the increasing demand of oranges from the United Kingdom, first, and then from Germany, France and other north-european industrialized countries; ii) the highly productive capacity of the Valencian soil thanks to its mild weather and irrigated fields; iii) the open mindedness of Valencian farmers towards innovation; and, iv) the developemnt of a railways network which made it possible to bring the oranges into the shipment ports (Bono, 2010; Piqueras, 2012). The Valencian orange trade knew its peak during the period 1925-1930 but later it experienced an economic crisis because of wars (both in Spain and Europe) and did not recover until the 1960's (Piqueras, 1999; Bono, 2010). After Spain's EEC (European Economic Community) membership (1986) and the creation of EU (1993) Valencian citrus sector grew: new orange groves were planted, new commercial varieties (especially mandarins) were promoted, and exports increased. Nevertheless, nowadays Valencian orange sector suffers from a structural problem: the small farm size and the lack of a good commercial network of distribution. But in spite of the current crisis, the orange groves' impact on landscape is still huge in Valencia, since it creates a thick forest of orange trees stretching not only the floodplains but also\n\nEducating for Difference in a Romany Community in Spain: An Exercise in Integration\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFernandez, Oscar\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe marginalization of the Romany community in Spain, as elsewhere in the world, has its roots in a centuries-old history of ethnic segregation. In response, the Romany community has come to feel intimidated and rejected. This has led to the establishment of communities on the outskirts of cities, generally with very poor living standards.

DESIGN: Mortality in the Valencian Community was assessed between 1975 and 1990. The classifications of Holland and Charlton, used to assess avoidable causes of death, were compared. Holland's classification was then used to divide avoidable mortality into two groups--medical care indicators (MCI), which show the effectiveness of health care, and national health policy indicators (NHPI), which show the status of primary prevention. Comparisons were made with rates, group rates, and population rates. Trends and indices were also studied. SETTING: Valencia, Spain, 1975-90. RESULTS: During the study period, avoidable morality (only assessed by MCI) fell 63%, whereas the remainder of the mortality (non-MCI causes, that is all the non-avoidable causes together with the NHPI group) fell by 17%. If it is assumed that the mortality due to non-MCI causes indicates the overall effect of the environmental, social, nutritional, and genetic influences, then the difference between this and the MCI group would take us nearer the actual effect of the intervention of the health system. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that in this community, the health system has been responsible for approximately 47% of the total reduction in mortality from avoidable causes in the period studied.

I.; VerdÃº, G.; Salas, M. D.; Cuevas, M. D.\n\n2005-02-01\n\nThe authors report on a method to calculate radiological risks, applicable to breast screening programs and other controlled medical exposures to ionizing radiation. In particular, it has been applied to make a risk assessment in the Valencian Breast Cancer Early Detection Program (VBCEDP) in Spain. This method is based on a parametric approach, through Markov processes, of hazard functions for radio-induced breast cancer incidence and mortality, with mean glandular breast dose, attained age and age-at-exposure as covariates. Excess relative risk functions of breast cancer mortality have been obtained from two different case-control studies exposed to ionizing radiation, with different follow-up time: the Canadian Fluoroscopy Cohort Study (1950-1987) and the Life Span Study (1950-1985 and 1950-1990), whereas relative risk functions for incidence have been obtained from the Life Span Study (1958-1993), the Massachusetts tuberculosis cohorts (1926-1985 and 1970-1985), the New York post-partum mastitis patients (1930-1981) and the Swedish benign breast disease cohort (1958-1987). Relative risks from these cohorts have been transported to the target population undergoing screening in the Valencian Community, a region in Spain with about four and a half million inhabitants. The SCREENRISK software has been developed to estimate radiological detriments in breast screening. Some hypotheses corresponding to different screening conditions have been considered in order to estimate the total risk associated with a woman who takes part in all screening rounds. In the case of the VBCEDP, the total radio-induced risk probability for fatal breast cancer is in a range between [5 Ã 10-6, 6 Ã 10-4] versus the natural rate of dying from breast cancer in the Valencian Community which is 9.2 Ã 10-3. The results show that these indicators could be included in quality control tests and could be adequate for making comparisons between several screening programs.\n\nA study of the differences in the request of glycated hemoglobin in primary care in Spain: A global, significant, and potentially dangerous under-request.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalinas, Maria; LÃ³pez-GarrigÃ³s, Maite; Uris, JoaquÃ­n; Leiva-Salinas, Carlos\n\n2014-08-01\n\nThe study was performed to compare the variability and appropriateness in the request of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in primary care in Spain. 76 Spanish laboratories from diverse regions across Spain filled out the number of HbA1c tests requested by general practitioners (GPs) during the year 2012. Every patient seen at the different primary care centers was included in the study. Each participating laboratory was required to provide organizational data. The number of HbA1c requests per 1000 inhabitants was calculated and compared between regions. To investigate whether HbA1c was appropriately requested to manage and to diagnose Diabetes Mellitus (DM), the number of necessary HbA1c was calculated, according to the disease prevalence in Spain (6.9%) and the guidelines regarding DM management and diagnosis. 17679195 patients were included in the study. A total of 1544551 HbA1c tests were ordered. No significant difference in the number of HbA1c requests per 1000 inhabitants was seen according to hospital setting (rural, urban or rural-urban). No significant differences were noticed between 3 Spanish regions, except the Valencian Community that presented higher values. Regarding the request appropriateness, 3280183 additional tests would have been necessary to manage diabetic patients and to diagnose new patients with the disease. There was a high variability regarding the request of HbA1c; the test was under-requested in all the participating health departments. This emphasizes the need to accomplish interventions to improve an appropriate use. Copyright Â© 2014.

The objective of this study was to know the coverage of vaccination against seasonal influenza in health professionals in two health departments of the Valencian Community (Torrevieja and Elx- Crevillent), in the seasons 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14. TA cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out to determine the coverage of influenza vaccination through the Nominal Vaccine Registry (NVR) of the Conselleria de Sanitat de la Generalitat Valenciana. The services with the highest risk of contagion were detected through requests for PCR analysis in patients suspected of influenza during the 2013-14 season. A total of 2035 health professionals were surveyed who achieved an average vaccination coverage of 27.2% in the 2013-14 season, showing an upward trend from the 2011-12 season. Significant differences were observed between professional categories and, practitioners presented the lowest coverage. A total of 192 PCR requests were recorded in both departments. The services which concentrate a greater number of requests were: Internal Medicine (n = 100), urgency service (n = 37), intensive care unit (n = 25) and Pediatrics ( n=154); The influenza vaccination coverage of these services in the 2013-14 seasons was 27.0%, 32.3%, 34.3% and 25.3%, respectively. Although they show an upward trend, vaccination coverage is low in health care personnel. Nurses are the best vaccinated. It would be appropriate to implement immunization strategies aimed specifically at services that, because of their activity, pose a greater risk to the patient.\n\nSulfate-reducing bacteria are common members of bacterial communities in Altamira Cave (Spain).\n\nPubMed\n\nPortillo, M Carmen; Gonzalez, Juan M\n\n2009-01-15\n\nThe conservation of paleolithic paintings such as those in Altamira Cave (Spain) is a primary objective. Recent molecular studies have shown the existence of unknown microbial communities in this cave including anaerobic microorganisms on cave walls. Herein, we analyzed an anaerobic microbial group, the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), from Altamira Cave with potential negative effects on painting conservation. In the present work, the communities of bacteria and SRB were studied through PCR-DGGE analysis. Data suggest that SRB communities represent a significant, highly diverse bacterial group in Altamira Cave. These findings represent a first report on this physiological group on caves with paleolithic paintings and their potential biodegradation consequences. Expanding our knowledge on microbial communities in Altamira Cave is a priority to design appropriate conservation strategies.\n\nGenetic susceptibility to Gilbert's syndrome in a valencian population; efficacy of the fasting test.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorres, A K; EscartÃ­n, N; MonzÃ³, C; GuzmÃ¡n, C; Ferrer, I; GonzÃ¡lez-MuÃ±oz, C; PeÃ±a, P; MonzÃ³, V; Marcaida, G; RodrÃ­guez-LÃ³pez, R\n\nTo describe the populational distribution of the UGT1A1*28 variant (genetic variant code rs8175347) located in the promotor of the UGT gene and correlate its genotypes with the results of the fasting test, as well as its relationship with the biochemical disorder of Gilbert's syndrome (GS) in a Valencian population. We studied the prevalence of the genotypes (TA) 6/6 (TA) 6/7 and (TA) 7/7 of the deleterious variant rs8175347 in 144 patients with hyperbilirubinemia, 38 of whom had previously undergone the fasting test to diagnose GS, and in 150 control patients. By analysing the genomic region of the TATA box of the UGT1A1 gene promotor using Sanger sequencing, we established the correlation between the rs8175347 genotypes and the fasting test results and with the patients' biochemical disorders. The rate of heterozygosity of allele (TA) 7 in the control population was 32% and increased to 87.59% among the patients with suspected GS. The rate of genotype TA 7/7 was 81.94% among the patients with hyperbilirubinemia, compared with 11.33% in the control patients. The fasting test showed a 15.79% rate of false negatives and a 5.26% rate of false positives. The high frequency of allele (TA) 7 among the Valencian control population, almost double the 5% reported for European control patients, confirms the high rate of GS reported in the Spanish population, without observing significant differences between the geographical ends of the country. The efficacy and reliability of the fasting test for the diagnosis of GS is questionable. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U. and Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de Medicina Interna (SEMI).

Observational, prospective study including patients â¥65years-old hospitalized due to a first OHF in: Andalusia, Catalonia, Valencian Community, Galicia, Madrid and the Basque Country. HRU related to OHF, quality of life and patient autonomy were collected, and HRU-associated costs were estimated. Four hundred and eighty-seven patients (mean age: 83.1years, 77% women) were included, with demographic characteristics that were similar across the Regions. Mean hospital stay was longest in Madrid and Galicia (women/men: 15.0/18.6 and 16.9/12.6days, respectively) and shortest in Andalusia and the Valencian Community (8.2/7.2 and 8.4/9.4days). There were more rehabilitation sessions and formal home care days in Catalonia and Madrid (women/men: 16/21 and 17/29 sessions; 19/20 and 30/27days) and fewer in Andalusia and Galicia (4/1 and 3/0 sessions; 3/1 and 1/0days). Mean HRU costs were higher in Madrid and lower in Andalusia (women/men: 12,321â¬/12,297â¬ and 7,031â¬/6,115â¬, respectively). OHF place a large burden on Spanish Regional Health Systems, including high economic costs. We found notable differences in mean costs across the Regions, mainly caused by the differential length of the first hospital stay and the outpatient care in subsequent months. These differences may be associated with differences in surgical delay. A national consensus on the management of OHF is desirable; moreover, agreeing common guidelines could have major socio-economic and healthcare benefits. Copyright Â© 2018 SECOT.

Multivariate linear regression analyses results showed that informal community support is positively related to social integration whereas insecurity is negatively related. The statistical relationship between discrimination and social integration disappears once levels of informal community support are taken into account. A better understanding of the factors that either promote or inhibit the social integration progress of immigrant population is important to orientate public policies and intervention programs that contribute to the adaptation of this population to the host society.\n\nExtension of the Job Demands-Resources model in the prediction of burnout and engagement among teachers over time.\n\nPubMed\n\nLorente Prieto, Laura; Salanova Soria, Marisa; MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez, Isabel; Schaufeli, Wilmar\n\n2008-08-01\n\nOur purpose was to extend the Job Demand-Resources Model (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004) by including personal resources, job demands and job resources to predict burnout (exhaustion, cynicism, depersonalization) and work engagement (vigour and dedication). The sample comprised 274 teachers from 23 secondary schools of the Valencian Community (Spain). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses have revealed: (1) the predictor effect of quantitative overload on exhaustion and dedication at T2, (2) role conflict on cynicism and (3) role ambiguity on dedication. Lastly, the mediating role of burnout and engagement at T2.

They perceived that men usually make decisions about sex and pregnancy and recognised a poor or inadequate use of contraceptive methods in planning their pregnancies. Women reported that it was not necessary to go as soon and as frequently for health examinations during pregnancy as the midwives suggested. The main barriers identified to health-care services were linked to insecure or illegal employment status, inflexible appointment timetables for prenatal checkups and sometimes to ignorance about how public services worked. empowering immigrant women is essential to having a long-term positive effect on their reproductive health. Antenatal care providers should be trained to build maternity care that is culturally sensitive and responds better to the health needs of different pregnant women and their newborns.

The following variables were used: mammography, frequency of mammography performance and the reason for the realization, as well as sociodemographic variables. Social class was obtained from the last occupation of the main family supporter. A logistic regression analysis was performed with sociodemographic variables. The prevalence of mammography has been increasing from 2006 to 2014, and also for the reason that the participants had received a letter, they were telephoned or offered in their Health Center to undergo this test. There are significant differences in the performance of mammography in the different autonomous communities. Performing mammography has increased significantly from 2006 to 2014, although there are still differences between autonomous communities, with Ceuta and Melilla being the least percentage of performed mammography. The factors that are related to greater performed mammography are: higher educational level, higher social class, married civil status, Spanish nationality and age.

We analyzed non-fatal injuries of a mechanical nature or those due to overexertion taking place in manufacturing or construction companies during the workday and requiring sick leave. The relative risk was adjusted for sex, age and contract type in each autonomous community using standardized injury causes for occupational injury, employing Spanish rates as a reference and stratifying by duration of leave (less than 16 days and more than 15 days). For the different types of accidents analyzed, the adjusted relative risk of occupational injury was heterogeneously distributed across the autonomous communities. Murcia, Navarre, the Balearic Islands and the Basque Country were generally found to be amongst the communities with the most elevated risks, while Castilla-LeÃ³n and Extremadura were those with the lowest risks of occupational injury. The heterogeneity of occupational injury rates across autonomous communities persisted after selecting a series of specific accident types and adjusting for sex, age and contract type. Therefore, in addition to continued analysis of work conditions to explain this variation, other socioeconomic factors should be taken into account when comparing occupational injury rates among autonomous communities.\n\n[Nuclear medicine in Spain: high technology 2013].\n\nPubMed\n\nSoriano CastrejÃ³n, A M; Prats Rivera, E; Alonso Farto, J C; Vallejo Casas, J A; Rodriguez Gasen, A; Setoain Perego, J; Arbizu Lostao, J\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis article details the high technology equipment in Spain obtained through a survey sent to the three main provider companies of equipment installed in Spain.

It aims at determining which agronomical or environmental factors associated to the olive orchards are the main drivers of the PPNs community structure and diversity. Classical morphological and morphometric identification methods were used to determine the frequency and densities of PPNs. Thirteen families, 34 genera and 77 species of PPNs were identified. The highest diversity was found in Helicotylenchus genus, with six species previously reported in Spain and with H. oleae being a first report. Neodolichorhynchus microphasmis and Diptenchus sp., Diphtherophora sp., and Discotylenchus sp., usually considered fungal feeders, were also reported for the first time associated to olive rhizosphere. PPNs abundance ranged from 66 to 16,288 individuals/500-cm3 of soil with Helicotylenchus digonicus being the most prevalent species, followed by Filenchus sp., Merlinius brevidens and Xiphinema pachtaicum. Nematode abundance and diversity indexes were influenced by olive cultivar, and orchard and soil management practices; while olive variety and soil texture were the main factors driving PPN community composition. Soil physicochemical properties and climatic characteristics most strongly associated to the PPN community composition included pH, sand content and exchangeable K, and maximum and minimum average temperature of the sampled locations. Our data suggests that there is a high diversity of PPNs associated to olive in Southern Spain that can exert different damage to olive roots depending on the olive variety and their abundance. Further analysis to determine the resistance levels of most common olive varieties to the prevalent PPNs in Spain will help to choose the most appropriate ones for the establishment of new plantations. This choice will take into consideration the specific\n\nTeaching astronomy and astrophysics at the Valencian International University (VIU): Application and use of Virtual Observatory tools\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDiago, P.

We used national hospital discharge data to select all hospital admissions for CAP as primary diagnosis. We analyzed incidence, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, pathogens, length of hospital stay (LOHS), in-hospital mortality (IHM) and readmission. We identified 959,465 admissions for CAP. Incidence rates of CAP increased significantly over time (from 142.4 in 2004 to 163.87 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013). Time trend analyses showed significant increases in the number of comorbidities and the use of CAT of thorax, red cell transfusion, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and readmissions (all p values<0.05). S. pneumoniae was the most frequent causative agent, but its isolation decreased over time. Overall median of LOHS was 7days and it did not change significantly during the study period. Time trend analyses also showed significant decreases in mortality during admission for CAP. Factor associated with higher IHM included: older age, higher CCI, S. aureus isolated, use of red cell transfusion or mechanical ventilation and readmission. The incidence and mortality of CAP have changed in Spain from 2004 to 2013. Although there was an increased incidence of hospitalization for this disease over time, we saw a significant reduction in IHM. Copyright Â© 2016 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

The objective of this study was to compare the incidences for both fatal and non-fatal injuries in foreign workers to that of Spanish workers in 2005, by autonomous community and economic activity. injury data came from the accident registry of the ministry of labor and social issues, and denominators were taken from available social security affiliation statistics from general and coal mining social security system. Incidence indices for fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries for foreign and spanish workers were calculated. In addition, relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by autonomous community and economic activity, using spanish workers as the reference group. Overall, relative risk for occupational injury in foreign workers in 2005 was superior to base risk for both fatal (1.34; 95% CI: 1.11-1.62) and non-fatal injury (1.13; 95% CI: 1.13-1.14), though there were important differences by autonomous community and activity sectors. Compared with Spanish workers, risk for occupational injury was higher for foreign workers in industrial activities, while it was lower in construction, commerce and restaurants and hotels. By autonomous community, AragÃ³n and Catalonia showed the highest risks for foreign workers. A higher risk for occupational injury among foreign workers is confirmed, and may be higher than that observed. The differences in risk among economic activities and autonomous communities require more detailed analysis.\n\nAnalysis of the diagnostic pathway and delay in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the Valencian Community.\n\nPubMed\n\nVÃ¡zquez-Costa, J F; MartÃ­nez-Molina, M; FernÃ¡ndez-Polo, M; FornÃ©s-Ferrer, V; Frasquet-Carrera, M; Sevilla-MantecÃ³n, T\n\n2018-06-11\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an insidious, clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease associated with a diagnostic delay of approximately 12 months. No study conducted to date has analysed the diagnostic pathway in Spain. We gathered data on variables related to the diagnostic pathway and delay for patients diagnosed with ALS between October 2013 and July 2017. The study included 143 patients with ALS (57% men; 68% spinal onset). Patients were diagnosed in public centres in 86% of cases and in private centres in 14%.The mean diagnostic delay was 13.1 months (median 11.7). Patients were examined by neurologists a mean time of 7.9 months after symptom onset, with diagnosis being made 5.2 months later. Half of all patients underwent unnecessary diagnostic tests and multiple electrophysiological studies before diagnosis was established. Diagnostic delay was longer in cases of spinal onset (P = .008) due to onset of the disease in the lower limbs. No differences were found between the public and private healthcare systems (P = .897). The diagnostic delay in ALS in Spain is similar to that of neighboring countries and seems to depend on disease-related factors, not on the healthcare system. Patients with lower-limb onset ALS constitute the greatest diagnostic challenge. Misdiagnosis is frequent, and partly attributable to an incorrect approach or erroneous interpretation of electrophysiological studies. Specific training programmes for neurologists and general neurophysiologists and early referral to reference centers may help to reduce diagnostic delay.

This paper presents the overall description, methodology, sample characteristics and reliability of the measures used. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in a representative sample of 1106 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and over in Spain. The sample was obtained by a geodemographically-based proportional multistage stratified sampling. A home-based questionnaire included validated scales and questions about sociodemographic characteristics, global QoL, health, family and social networks, financial means and retirement, leisure and social participation, residential environment, and satisfaction with those issues. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted. Cronbach's Î± coefficients were used to assess internal consistency of the scales. This nationally representative survey furnishes information about global QoL, health-related QoL, resources availability, living conditions, and satisfaction with the assessed aspects, including life domains most valued by this group. In general, community-dwelling older adults reported positive assessments of health, living conditions, and high levels of satisfaction with the different aspects of QoL. The reliability of the measures in this population was good. This survey provides comprehensive and useful information, based on the view of older people themselves, with potential to contribute to health and social policies towards promoting active aging. The database is available for in-depth comparisons.\n\nShort-term meso-scale variability of mesozooplankton communities in a coastal upwelling system (NW Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoura, Ãlvaro; Ãlvarez-Salgado, XosÃ© A.; GonzÃ¡lez, Ãngel F.; Gregori, MarÃ­a; RosÃ³n, Gabriel; Guerra, Ãngel\n\n2013-02-01\n\nThe short-term, meso-scale variability of the mesozooplankton community present in the coastal upwelling system of the RÃ­a de Vigo (NW Spain) has been analysed. Three well-defined communities were identified: coastal, frontal and oceanic, according to their holoplankton-meroplankton ratio, richness, and total abundance. These communities changed from summer to autumn due to a shift from downwelling to upwelling-favourable conditions coupled with taxa dependent changes in life strategies. Relationships between the resemblance matrix of mesozooplankton and the resemblance matrices of meteorologic, hydrographic and community-derived biotic variables were determined with distance-based linear models (DistLM, 18 variables), showing an increasing amount of explained variability of 6%, 16.1% and 54.5%, respectively. A simplified model revealed that the variability found in the resemblance matrix of mesozooplankton was mainly described by the holoplankton-meroplankton ratio, the total abundance, the influence of lunar cycles, the upwelling index and the richness; altogether accounting for 64% of the total variability. The largest variability of the mesozooplankton resemblance matrix (39.6%) is accounted by the holoplankton-meroplankton ratio, a simple index that describes appropriately the coastal-ocean gradient. The communities described herein kept their integrity in the studied upwelling and downwelling episodes in spite of the highly advective environment off the RÃ­a de Vigo, presumably due to behavioural changes in the vertical position of the zooplankton.\n\nEffects of the community engagement of migrants on their well-being: The case of Moroccan leaders in southern Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nTaurini, Elena; Paloma, Virginia; GarcÃ­a-RamÃ­rez, Manuel; Marzana, Daniela; Marta, Elena\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCommunity engagement of migrants has been identified as an important element in developing both individual well-being and cohesive multicultural receiving communities. Through 10 in-depth interviews, this study explores the profile of Moroccan migrant leaders in community organizations in the receiving context (south of Spain) and the reasons for which they engage. Moreover, it analyzes the relationship established between community engagement and their well-being. The results show that migrants commit for both intrinsic (e.g., support their compatriots) and extrinsic (e.g., increase their social connection) reasons. Their social action has a positive influence on their well-being because it activates the following paths: (1) improvement of bicultural competences; (2) development of social relationships with receiving members; (3) strengthening of social bonds with compatriots; (4) increase of abilities in dealing with unjust social conditions in the new environment; and (5) decrease of prejudice towards their own cultural group.\n\nThe State of the Art of Group Psychotherapy in Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartinez-Taboada, Cristina; Amutio, Alberto; Elgorriaga, Edurne; Arnoso, Ainara\n\n2015-10-01\n\n(1) What is the history and the theoretical orientation of group therapy in Spain?

(6) How are group-related issues important within the social background of Spain? and (7) What does group work hold for the future? Although not even a century has passed since the birth of this discipline, there have already been many events associated with the management of power and knowledge, the development of a sense of community, and the evolution of the political and social life of our country. Group therapy training is still evolving and is properly supported and accredited by prestigious institutions. In the 2013 Symposium of the Spanish Society of Group Psychotherapy and Group Techniques (SEPTG), the need for joint group theories and techniques within the profession's activities was clearly highlighted. Further, the enthusiasm of group psychotherapists to open themselves to specific social perspectives (health, education, community prevention, organizations) is a way of encouraging society to untangle conscious and unconscious knots that are created in social interaction.\n\nSpain to Join ESO\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2006-02-01\n\nToday, during a ceremony in Madrid, an agreement was signed by the Spanish Minister of Education and Science, Mrs. MarÃ­a JesÃºs San Segundo, and the ESO Director General, Dr. Catherine Cesarsky, affirming their commitment to securing Spanish membership of ESO. ESO PR Photo 05a/06 ESO PR Photo 05a/06 Signature Event in Madrid Following approval by the Spanish Council of Ministers and the ratification by the Spanish Parliament of the ESO Convention and the associated protocols, Spain intends to become ESO's 12th member state on 1 July 2006. \"Since long Spain was aware that entering ESO was a logical decision and it was even necessary for a country like Spain because Spain is ranked 8th in astrophysical research\", said Mrs. MarÃ­a JesÃºs San Segundo. \"The large scientific installations are not only necessary for research in different fields but are also partners and customers for hi-tech companies, helping to increase the funding of R&D.\" \"Spanish Astronomy has made tremendous strides forward and we are delighted to welcome Spain as a new member of ESO. We very much look forward to working together with our excellent Spanish colleagues,\" said Dr. Cesarsky. \"For ESO, the Spanish accession means that we can draw on the scientific and technological competences, some of them unique in Europe, that have been developed in Spain and, of course, for Europe the Spanish membership of ESO is an important milestone in the construction of the European Research Area.\" ESO PR Photo 05b/06 ESO PR Photo 05b/06 Signature Event in Madrid Indeed, Spain is an important member of the European astronomical community and has developed impressively over the last three decades, reaching maturity with major contributions in virtually all subjects of astronomy.

Spain's average birth rate was 2.86 in 1970, 2.21 in 1980, and 1.21 in 1994. According to Eurostat, Spain's average birth rate in 1995 was 1.18, while the European Community's was 1.43. Although all the countries of the European Community have birth rates below 2.1, Spain's is 44% below this minimum rate needed to achieve generation replacement. In 1994 and 1997, in 5 northern communities, including the Basque country and Galicia, the birth rate was less than 1.0. The lowest birth rate (0.76 in 1997) was in the northern region of Asturias. Although southern autonomous regions have higher birth rates (between 1.21 and 1.44 for 1997) than northern ones, these are also decreasing (from 3.36 in 1970 to 1.29 in 1997 in Andalusia). Credit for the rapid decrease is given to improved quality of life and education, increased contraceptive usage, and social change. Employment of women has increased, and unemployed sons are remaining at home for longer periods. The most important reasons are 1) the increased number of single people and 2) the increased average age of women having their first child. The latter increase began in 1988. Most Spanish women now have their first child between the ages of 30 and 39 years. The average age was 28 years in 1975; in 1995, it was 30 years. Women from the northern autonomous regions have the highest average age at first birth (Basque women, 31.2 years in 1995). The pattern of fecundity in Spain is different from other countries in Europe. In Spain, the decrease started in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Until the 1980s, Spain had one of the highest birth rates in Europe. This was followed by a decrease in the 1990s. However, in 1997, there were 3000 more births than in 1996.

The purpose of this article is to present the new nursing education framework in Spain: A brief history together with its recent reform and developments. Since nursing education was integrated into the university level in 1977, the only academic recognition for such an education in Spain was the three year diploma degree. Nurses had to move into other disciplines in order to achieve academic growth or advance their nursing studies abroad. Currently and in compliance with the Bologna declaration for the Higher European Education Area, nursing education in Spain is being transformed into a program which recognizes bachelor, master and doctoral degrees in this field. In January 2005, the Spanish Government published the guidelines for the undergraduate, master's and doctoral levels, and finally, last October 2007, it established the regulations for the official university education. The current nursing specialties in Spain include family and community health nursing, midwifery, mental health nursing, geriatric nursing, health work nursing, medical care nursing and pediatric nursing. This new nursing education structure is expected to improve health care as well as nursing reliability and autonomy.\n\nMolecular characterization of total and metabolically active bacterial communities of \"white colonizations\" in the Altamira Cave, Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nPortillo, M Carmen; Saiz-Jimenez, Cesareo; Gonzalez, Juan M\n\n2009-01-01\n\nCaves with paleolithic paintings are influenced by bacterial development. Altamira Cave (Spain) contains some of the most famous paintings from the Paleolithic era. An assessment of the composition of bacterial communities that have colonized this cave represents a first step in understanding and potentially controlling their proliferation. In this study, areas showing colonization with uncolored microorganisms, referred to as \"white colonizations\", were analyzed. Microorganisms present in these colonizations were studied using DNA analysis, and those showing significant metabolic activity were detected in RNA-based RNA analysis. Bacterial community fingerprints were obtained both from DNA and RNA analyses, indicating differences between the microorganisms present and metabolically active in these white colonizations. Metabolically active microorganisms represented only a fraction of the total bacterial community present in the colonizations. 16S rRNA gene libraries were used to identify the major representative members of the studied communities. Proteobacteria constituted the most frequently found division both among metabolically active microorganisms (from RNA-based analysis) and those present in the community (from DNA analysis). Results suggest the existence of a huge variety of taxa in white colonizations of the Altamira Cave which represent a potential risk for the conservation of the cave and its paintings.\n\n[Self-rated health and educational level in Spain: trends by autonomous communities and gender (2001-2012)].\n\nPubMed\n\nAguilar-Palacio, Isabel; Carrera-Lasfuentes, Patricia; Rabanaque, M JosÃ©\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo identify the trend in self-rated health in Spain by autonomous communities (AC) in the period 2001-2012, as well as differences by gender and age, and the influence of educational level. A cross sectional study was carried out using data from the National Health Surveys from 2001 to 2011-12 and the 2009 European Survey. A descriptive analysis was conducted that included gender, age, educational level, and the AC of residence. Logistic regression analyses were developed to explore the temporal trend and the association between educational level and self-rated health. The predictive capacity of the model was calculated using the C statistic. The prevalence of low self-rated health was higher in women with low educational level. Self-rated health improved in women with high educational level (2001:18.6% vs. 2012:14.6%). The highest prevalence of low self-rated health was observed in Andalusia, the Canary Islands, Galicia and Murcia, with differences by gender. Low educational level was associated with low self-rated health in most AC, with good predictive capacity. In all AC except Asturias, low self-rated health was more frequent in women than in men. In Spain, the prevalence of self-rated health showed no variations in the period analyzed and improved in the Balearic Islands, Catalonia, and Madrid. The prevalence of self-rated health in Spain differed by AC. Although health was unchanged during the period considered, inequalities were found in its temporal trend by educational level and gender, which could lead to an increase in health inequalities in women according educational level.

However, since no study has assessed cardiovascular risk scores as associated factors, we carried out a study to quantify diagnostic inertia in dyslipidaemia and to determine if cardiovascular risk scores are associated with this inertia. In the Valencian Community (Spain), a preventive programme (cardiovascular, gynaecologic and vaccination) was started in 2003 inviting persons aged â¥40 years to undergo a health check-up at their health centre. This cross-sectional study examined persons with no known dyslipidaemia seen during the first six months of the programme (n = 16, 905) but whose total cholesterol (TC) was â¥5.17 mmol/L. Diagnostic inertia was defined as lack of follow-up to confirm/discard the dyslipidaemia diagnosis. Other variables included in the analysis were gender, history of cardiovascular risk factors/cardiovascular disease, counselling (diet/exercise), body mass index (BMI), age, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipids. TC was grouped as â¥/<6.20 mmol/L. In patients without cardiovascular disease and <75/â¤65 years (n = 15, 778/13, 597), the REGICOR (REgistre GIronÃ­ del COr)/SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation) cardiovascular risk functions were used to classify risk (high/low). Inertia was quantified and the adjusted odds ratios calculated from multivariate models. In the overall sample, the rate of diagnostic inertia was 52% (95% CI [51.2-52.7]); associated factors were TC â¥ 6.20 mmol/L, high or \"not measured\" BMI, hypertension, smoking and higher values of fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure and TC. In the REGICOR sample, the rate of diagnostic inertia was 51.9% (95% CI [51.1-52.7]); associated factors were REGICOR high and high or \"not measured\" BMI.

This cross-sectional study examined persons with no known dyslipidaemia seen during the first six months of the programme (n = 16, 905) but whose total cholesterol (TC) was â¥5.17 mmol/L. Diagnostic inertia was defined as lack of follow-up to confirm/discard the dyslipidaemia diagnosis. Other variables included in the analysis were gender, history of cardiovascular risk factors/cardiovascular disease, counselling (diet/exercise), body mass index (BMI), age, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipids. TC was grouped as â¥/<6.20 mmol/L. In patients without cardiovascular disease and <75/â¤65 years (n = 15, 778/13, 597), the REGICOR (REgistre GIronÃ­ del COr)/SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation) cardiovascular risk functions were used to classify risk (high/low). Inertia was quantified and the adjusted odds ratios calculated from multivariate models. In the overall sample, the rate of diagnostic inertia was 52% (95% CI [51.2â52.7]); associated factors were TC â¥ 6.20 mmol/L, high or ânot measuredâ BMI, hypertension, smoking and higher values of fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure and TC. In the REGICOR sample, the rate of diagnostic inertia was 51.9% (95% CI [51.1â52.7]); associated factors were REGICOR high and high or ânot measuredâ BMI. In the SCORE sample the rate of diagnostic inertia\n\nInnovation or 'Inventions'? The conflict between latent assumptions in marine aquaculture and local fishery.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez-Novo, Rodrigo; Lizcano, EmmÃ¡nuel; Herrera-Racionero, Paloma; Miret-Pastor, LluÃ­s\n\n2018-02-01\n\nRecent European policy highlights the need to promote local fishery and aquaculture by means of innovation and joint participation in fishery management as one of the keys to achieve the sustainability of our seas. However, the implicit assumptions held by the actors in the two main groups involved - innovators (scientists, businessmen and administration managers) and local fishermen - can complicate, perhaps even render impossible, mutual understanding and co-operation. A qualitative analysis of interviews with members of both groups in the Valencian Community (Spain) reveals those latent assumptions and their impact on the respective practices. The analysis shows that the innovation narrative in which one group is based and the inventions narrative used by the other one are rooted in two dramatically different, or even antagonistic, collective worldviews. Any environmental policy that implies these groups should take into account these strong discords.\n\nAssessing residential building values in Spain for risk analyses - application to the landslide hazard in the Autonomous Community of Valencia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCantarino, I.; Torrijo, F. J.; Palencia, S.; Gielen, E.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThis paper proposes a method of valuing the stock of residential buildings in Spain as the first step in assessing possible damage caused to them by natural hazards. For the purposes of the study we had access to the SIOSE (the Spanish Land Use and Cover Information System), a high-resolution land-use model, as well as to a report on the financial valuations of this type of building throughout Spain. Using dasymetric disaggregation processes and GIS techniques we developed a geolocalized method of obtaining this information, which was the exposure variable in the general risk assessment formula. Then, with the application over a hazard map, the risk value can be easily obtained. An example of its application is given in a case study that assesses the risk of a landslide in the entire 23 200 km2 of the Valencia Autonomous Community (NUT2), the results of which are analysed by municipal areas (LAU2) for the years 2005 and 2009.\n\nAssessing residential buildings value in Spain for risk analyses.
