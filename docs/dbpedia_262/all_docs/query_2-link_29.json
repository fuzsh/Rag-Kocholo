        "text": "Introduction\n\nSpain is a decentralised country in which the Autonomous Communities have the powers to administer and manage certain public services, including health. However, this has not always been the case. To understand the current situation, it is necessary to go back to 1977, the year in which the Ministry of Health and Social Security was created. Months later, by Royal Decree-Law 36/1978, a Social Security Management Entity was created, the National Health Institute, abbreviated as INSALUD, in charge of providing healthcare.1\n\nDuring the process of political and economic change that took place at that time, the Spanish Transition, the approval of the Constitution in 1978 brought changes related to the decentralisation of powers, including in the area of health. Specifically, Article 43 recognises the right to health protection and Article 148.1.21 recognises health as a competence that can be assumed by the Autonomous Communities, leaving only the State with exclusive competence in external health and the general coordination of health (Article 149.1.16).\n\nThe constitution of the communities is carried out at different paces, so there are some that assume the functions and services carried out by INSALUD sooner than others, the process of transfer begins in 1981 and ends at the end of 2001. Thus, first, Catalonia (1981), Andalusia (1984), the Basque Country (1984), the Valencian Community (1987), Galicia (1990), the Community of Navarre (1990) and the Canary Islands (1994) received the competencies.\n\nMeanwhile, Aragon, the Principality of Asturias, the Balearic Islands, Cantabria, Castile-La Mancha, Castile and Leon, Extremadura, La Rioja, the Community of Madrid and the Region of Murcia were under State administration through INSALUD, until they received the transfer of competences. After a long process, at the end of 2001, these last 10 Autonomous Regions received the transfers and by the following year were already administering and managing healthcare in their territory. Thus, INSALUD was liquidated and converted into a smaller entity, the Instituto Nacional de Gestión Sanitaria, abbreviated as INGESA,2 which would continue to administer and manage healthcare in the Autonomous Cities of Ceuta and Melilla.\n\nTherefore, to summarise, our country currently has the National Health System, which brings together the public health networks of the 17 Autonomous Regions, and INGESA, the state administrator and manager of the Autonomous Cities.\n\nEach Autonomous Community carries out the planning, administration and management of the health services in its territory, following the guidelines set out in the LGS (General Health Act), but with variability in terms of the portfolio of services for its citizens, while respecting the basic levels cited in Law 14/1986, LGS. The autonomous communities’ highest health management body is the Regional Ministry of Health, which is responsible for setting up a Health Service (from the point of view of both the service provider and the service funder), made up of outpatient centres (primary healthcare centres) and hospitals that provide the services planned in the autonomous community’s service portfolio. Each Autonomous Community divides the territory into Health Areas, which are the Basic Geographical and Functional Units of healthcare, each health area being autonomous and able to establish its own specific health plans and adapt resources to the needs of the population concerned. These health areas, provided for in the LGS, are created to cover approximately 200 000 inhabitants, with at least one Tertiary Hospital Centre and different Health Centres, approximately one for every 20 000 inhabitants.\n\nThe universal nature of our public healthcare system necessarily means that it is not linked to citizens’ ability to pay, unlike other types of contributory benefits offered by the Social Security System, which are directly affected by the social contributions made by the system’s potential beneficiaries. Consequently, as healthcare is treated as a unremarkable benefit of the social security system, its main source of financing is the transfers made by the corresponding public administrations (State, Autonomous Communities or Local Corporations), which come mainly from public sector tax revenues.\n\nThe decentralisation of the health system carried out in Spain is not an isolated event; other countries such as Italy, the UK, Portugal, the Philippines, etc, have also done so.3 4 These types of reforms have given rise to a debate in the literature about who plays a better role in managing healthcare: the state or the territories that make it up? In other words, in terms of the welfare and efficiency of the population, what is more favourable: a centralised or decentralised healthcare system?.\n\nNumerous studies3–6 discuss the direct consequences that accompany health decentralisation, as well as its advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe mere definition of the concept of decentralisation generates different positions and approaches that often complicate rather than facilitate the analysis7 8 defines decentralisation as ‘the transfer of planning, management and collection responsibilities and allocation of resources from the central government and its agencies to territorial units’ as well as Delegation as the transfer of decision-making and administrative power—including financial responsibilities —over public functions to autonomous organisations.9 10 It is the latter concept that best fits the decentralisation process that has taken place in the Spanish national health system.\n\nPrivatisation, on the other hand, would be the policy of having services provided by businesses, community groups, co-operatives, private voluntary associations, individuals, small informal enterprises and other non-governmental organisations. For this author, privatisation ranges from leaving the provision of goods and services entirely to economic competition to ‘partnerships’ between public agencies and private enterprises.11\n\nDecentralisation is generally considered to improve efficiency in healthcare and influence healthcare by bringing governance closer to the population, allowing for feedback.5 It also fosters competition between territories that try to stand out and proceed in the best possible way, most of the time leading to increased spending, which is often accompanied by improved health outcomes.3 12 In that sense, it should take in account that, although Tiebout13 argued in his famous article that citizens ‘vote with their feet’ and choose the jurisdiction that offers them the best range of services, it is debatable whether citizen mobility is as typical in Europe as it is in the USA.14 While mobility enhances the benefits of decentralisation, it is not entirely dependent on it. Even in the absence of mobility, the efficient provision of a local public good is determined by the condition that the sum of marginal costs of substitution equals marginal costs, and this condition tends to vary across territories.15\n\nHowever, when decision-makers increase spending, this can result in increased costs due to: duplication of inputs, where two neighbouring regions may share similar services; diseconomies of scale or even moral hazard, as they expect their debts to be covered by the central government.3\n\nThe aim of the study was to answer whether the central government has been more efficient than the regional governments or vice versa. Likewise, through the analysis of the data, the aim was to shed light on whether decentralisation has had a positive impact on the efficiency of the hospital sector or not.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe are aware that it is difficult in this area to compare the results found with other studies due to the fact that DEA can give different results when the inputs and outputs used are not the same. Moreover, we have used global data from the health sector—in order to be able to draw conclusions, not only in the public sector (NHS), but also in the private sector and jointly, on the effects of decentralisation in the Spanish health sector—while in many other studies, a specific selection of hospitals has been carried out.32–34\n\nAs far as the public sector is concerned, our results show that most of the Autonomous Regions that were the last to receive health transfers improved their efficiency levels to their highest values between 2007 and 2012. However, if we consider the comparison of these regions as a whole, the highest figures are found in 2012. We believe that this behaviour is possible due to the positive impact of the incorporation of new management models and changes in the organisational structure of those Autonomous Regions that received the transfer of competences at the end of 2001, coinciding with the authors Granado Cabello and Vega Hidalgo.32 However, other authors such as Sbert and Gómez Vicens34 do not agree with this explanation, as they believe that, after the transfers, there is a period of adaptation that leads to an increase in costs and resources that are detrimental to productivity levels.\n\nThat said, it should be stressed that the introduction of these changes does not fully explain the increase in efficiency in the Autonomous Regions studied, as there are other socioeconomic factors that may influence efficiency. It is also necessary to question why, as we have seen, some regions do not improve as much as others. Despite the fact that, following decentralisation, the efficiency of the NHS improves in general—in its entirety if we compare all the Autonomous Regions as a whole—those territories that are less efficient may be due to factors such as ageing, geographical dispersion, wealth or the public spending policies of each region, among other variables. In this sense, we agree with Pérez-Romero, Ortega-Díaz, Ocaña-Riola and Martín-Martín.33\n\nDespite these differences, it should be stressed that after the transfer of competences in the public health sector, there has been a positive impact which has led to a reduction in the gap between the most efficient and least efficient Autonomous Regions in Spain. Over the 15 years observed, the gap between Autonomous Regions has narrowed by approximately 40%. In view of this improvement, however, we would like to focus on two aspects relating to the private sector and waiting lists.\n\nOn the one hand, the data provided by the Ministry show that over the years, following the transfers, public provision has not only become more efficient, but has also increased with respect to private provision, even in regions where the private sector is very efficient. The case of the Community of Madrid stands out, which, despite the strong presence of the private sector, has increasingly increased the supply of public services. On the other hand, there is also the case of La Rioja, a territory in which the Private Sector is very efficient and yet the importance of public activities is increasing. In other words, we find that the evolution of public activity is increasing, except in the case of the Balearic Islands, where its weight is increasing in relation to the private sector. This can also be seen in the decrease in spending on concerts in a large part of the Autonomous Regions, as indicated by IDIS.35\n\nTherefore, we can say that the transfers have boosted the public sector even in those Autonomous Regions with a strong presence of private activity, even if this is efficient. We believe that this trend may have a negative impact on citizens in the future because, with a permanent increase in health spending, not only in Spain but in other countries as well—derived from demographic factors, such as ageing, which affects Western Europe in particular, as pointed out by Jakovljevic et al,36 or cultural factors such as the desire for greater welfare—the public health system may be limited by the need for a larger budget and greater flexibility. Authors such as Kosycarz et al,37 propose a similar approach to improving public hospitals in Poland through public–private partnerships.\n\nMoreover, these results can be explained by the behaviour of which, in most of the regions, the private sector has a negative influence on the data as a whole (it dragged down the positive results achieved by the Public Sector), because efficiency levels are lower than before devolution, contrary to the results of public hospitals alone. This inefficiency in some Autonomous Regions is probably due to the fact that the private sector in these regions was not market developed and depended to a greater extent on INSALUD (National Institute for Health—the public manager under the Ministry of Health of the Central Government, prior to the devolution). The Balearic Islands stand out for having the highest efficiency during the whole period considered, possibly due to their previous experience, as before the transfer of the competences, Balearic Islands already had a significant weight of the private sector in the healthcare system. Its case could be compared with that of Catalonia, both of which are similar in terms of the significant weight of the private sector in healthcare, which had already been reflected for many years.38\n\nIn that sense, Kruse et al,39 in a study of five European countries, present evidence that public hospitals have at least the same level of efficiency or more than private hospitals. Likewise, in a comparative study by Comendeiro-Maaløe et al40 of the performance of a private hospital in Spain and a private hospital licensed as a regional health service, the private hospital generally did not perform better than the public hospitals, although it did excel in some areas. However, according to Lucifora,41 managers of public hospitals often perform worse than managers of private hospitals. In the same sense, Perez-Romero et al.33\n\nAll of this is directly related to the problem of waiting lists. In particular, there are two cases in which the Autonomous Regions with the highest waiting list figures should increase their productivity by improving the management of their public sector, that is, Extremadura, Castile-La Mancha and Aragon. In the cases of the Region of Murcia or Cantabria, where their public sector is very efficient, they should consider the possibility that their private sector, which is being underutilised, could, according to article 66 of Law 14/1986, of 25 April, General Health,42 link private hospitals to the planning of the public sector, without them losing their ownership, thus alleviating waiting lists, as also argued by IDIS.35 Another possibility in this case could be to increase public resources in the face of such good management to reduce waiting lists.\n\nThose ACs with lower levels of efficiency, as explained above, are probably not making efficient use of their resources and could offer greater capacity or, in other words, not have such high waiting times.\n\nA case in point is Ceuta and Melilla which, after the creation of INGESA (Management Institute under the Ministry of Health of the Spanish Central Government), managed to improve their efficiency by 62.12%—probably due to the fact that they only have to manage the autonomous cities and, as there are not a greater number of territories, they can better focus on the needs of the autonomous cities—but if we make a relative comparison, they are below the rest of the Autonomous Regions. In this sense of a low level of efficiency of INGESA hospitals, there is evidence of saturation, lack of resources in relation to the population to be attended and waiting times, as stated in the study by Artundo Purroy.43\n\nConcerning the methodology used in this study, various approaches have been taken in the national and international literature to identify explanatory factors for technical efficiency and productivity.44 Most studies compare efficiency figures between groups of units and explain them by linear regression. For example, in Iran, variability in efficiency in public hospitals was analysed by applying a multigroup DEA (Rezaee and Karimdadi, 2015) and correlation coefficients are frequently used in Spain to explore the relationship between efficiency and other factors.45–48\n\nPerez-Romero et al49 combine multilevel regression models to explain the efficiency of hospitals in the Spanish public network, this being one of the main methodological innovations provided by this study of Analysis of technical efficiency in the hospitals of the Spanish National Health System.\n\nLinked to the above, a traditional linear regression model useful for estimating the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It is based on correlations and is therefore useful for estimating the variance of an independent variable explained by dependent variables. It is not causal and cannot provide researchers with information about a specific individual. It is parametric and cannot be generalised to results at the extremes of the distribution. Is prone to bias due to omitted variables, multicollinearity and autoregression, although there are tests and extensions to increase robustness.50\n\nOn the other side, a non-parametric benchmarking method for analysing the efficiency of product production at a given input level. Provides a highly individualised benchmark for each individual in the group. Benchmarks are based only on existing input and output data for ‘equivalents’ or other individuals in the same population. May include multiple dependent variables or outcomes simultaneously. Can be combined with other methods to reduce limitations and improve own results. Can be used with a model-fitting approach to determine which input or dependent variable to focus on to achieve the greatest expected benefit for each individual. Sensitive to omitted variables and measurement error. There are methods to address these issues, but they are not as reliable as other methods. They are limited to the individual or population analysed, so the results cannot be generalised to other populations without subsequent analyses using other methods.50\n\nAnother methodological issue to consider is the difference between DEA and SFA. DEA is the most commonly used method in mathematical programming to estimate production frontiers. Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) is the most representative method used in econometrics to estimate production frontiers.51 DEA is recognised as a powerful tool for efficiency analysis and benchmarking, and its estimates are used in a wide range of industries and activities, including healthcare.52 53 The main difference between DEA and SFA is that DEA is usually used to examine the relative efficiency of individual studies. SFA is used to examine absolute efficiency and the relationship between the determinants of input and output (cost) efficiency. Therefore, SFA is often used to assess the efficiency of for profit organisations. The DEA method measures the efficiency of public subjects by using the observed best performance compared with all subjects.54\n\nWe are aware that this study presents the methodological limitations of DEA, derived from its deterministic character, which has been confronted with the testing of various models.47 The limitations of the DEA methodology are that it does not measure error, it does not measure the relative differences between efficient suppliers, the use of many input and output variables is often considered flawed and that homogeneity in the units used is required.55 56"
