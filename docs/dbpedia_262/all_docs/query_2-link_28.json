        "text": "ABSTRACT Certainly all architecture is a reflection of the man on himself and on its way to being in the world, and therefore a cultural fact with obvious implications in the minds of individuals and societies. For this reason, each society can be recognized by its architecture. But societies change and architecture also. The idea that times change dragging everything in its path is a typically romantic idea linked to feelings of fatalism and destination that has difficult arrangement in the Christian conception of the world. And however, invoking 'Zeitgeist', to the spirit of the times, has been a constant in the justification of religious architecture of the 20th century. The Constitution Apostolic 'Sacrosanctum Concilium' proposed the appropriate framework for «adapt better to the needs of our time the institutions that are subject to change -the architecture, for example- (…) and thus our voices join the admirable concert great men sang the Catholic faith in past centuries» (§ 1 and 123). The problem for religious architecture arises when thinking currents change too fast or are less than free. Because religious architecture, more than any other, has a symbolic dimension, alludes to belief and in the limit to a dogma. Thus, we could ask us: how to harmonize the various cultural trends with permanent elements of Catholic dogma without distorting the cult buildings? It seems that this is what you want to analyze in this Congress. Certainly the problem is complex, because it encompasses many disciplines and its ramifications we would too far. With this communication we will only try to explain what has happened in Spain during the 20th century. Explain how the desire to create a new canon that conform to the spirit of the times in the field of religious architecture, often collided with stubborn physical reality a strongly determined by geography and climate, territory and stubborn psychological and cultural reality of its inhabitants. To do this we will support some examples that will enable us to refer to so many topics that filled the debate: the intense debate on the construction of the space in the 20th century Spain.\n\nThe text presented by Eduardo Delgado-Orusco and Esteban Fernández-Cobián in this column is the result of a thought highlighted on the occasion of the international congress ‘A Living Presence. Extending and Transforming the Tradition of Catholic Sacred Architecture’ held last April at the School of Architecture of the Catholic University di Washington. The publication of the congress proceedings is expected for next March. The authors present, in preview on the Abitare site, the essential aspects of their research on Spanish religious architecture during the twentieth century, inspecting the role of dogmas in relation with the spirit of the times, the inclination to surrealism typical of the Iberian context, as well as the main currents running through modernity and touching contemporaneity of the sacred architecture. Among the conclusions, we find the denounciation of a dangerous return to nostalgia and to the forms of the past that, in this field, especially in the North American context, sounds like a warning. The risk is that the appeal is missed both by the scientific and the planning community. We think it our duty to make an attempt at preventing this to happen."
