        "text": "We did this experience with our two adult children. The hosts were wonderful, funny, knowledgeable and great teachers. The setting was brilliant and the transport from the meeting point to their wonderful location was a great touch. We have made Paella many times before at home but now we will definitely do it very differently. Would highly recommend this excursion and the hosts\n\nThis was a highlight of our time in Valencia. Rafa and his sons made it feel like this was the only class of the week. Great hospitality, great food, and overall just a great experience with a wonderful family and other guests.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had a marvelous culinary experience. At first, we were not sure if it was legit because Rafa and Javier had to pick us up in a \"white van\". Once we arrived at the meeting point, it was obvious that it was indeed a real organized activity. We had fun with a dozen of other participants in Rafa's lovely yard. The group was divided in three and we were able to taste three different paella. We did not leave hungry, believe me! I highly recommend!\n\nRafa and his colleagues were absolutely amazing hosts and cooks. Upon arrival to a beautiful home 30 minutes outside of Valencia, we were welcomed by drinks and a beautiful set up for learning to make paella. The entire experience was fantastic and I would highly recommend this excursion. We learned to make great paella and had a true feast.\n\nWow, Wow, Wow!!! What an amazing day! I highly recommend this class for anyone considering taking a Paella cooking class in the Valencia area. Rafa and Javier’s team was excellent from pick up to drop off. We started off making Sangria, because of course the first step in Paella making is making the Sangria! All our Paella’s turned out fantastic! We met lots of lovely people- and two couples were celebrating their anniversary the day of our cooking class- of course we had to toast them multiple times!! I was there with my teen daughter and she loved it! When we thought we were finished, as we were all very full. Deserts came out, which is a traditional sponge with desert wine and fresh watermelon from the area. The surrounding is superb and relaxing. I highly recommend.\n\nRafa and Javier’s team was excellent from pick up to drop off. I thought we are only doing a Paella cooking but we were surprised that we also made Sangria prior to cooking. Later, after cooking we enjoyed the Sangria together with our Paella. When we thought we were finished, as we are all full. Deserts came out, which is a traditional sponge with desert wine and fresh watermelon. The whole family is so welcoming and made us feel at home in the whole duration of our activity. The surrounding is superb and relaxing. Would definitely recommend this activity to anyone visiting Valencia.\n\nThere were a couple of paella cooking classes I considered booking, but this was the only one out of the city at a farmhouse near the rice fields where they use the rice in the paella. Rafael was welcoming and funny and Javier did a great job translating. I enjoyed learning about the original recipe for paella and how and when it is eaten. It was delicious and such a fun experience. I’d highly recommend this experience.\n\nRafa and his outstanding assistants made our time learning the secrets of making paella incredible. It was wonderful to be put in the countryside and see the actual rice fields. Rafa is not only a great chef but a good teacher and kind person. The afternoon exceeded our expectations and we made was delicious. This is a well planned hands on class. Javier was a great translator for Rafa.\n\nMy wife and I went for the Authentic Paella Cooking Class May 10, and and everything exceeded our expectations, from pick up in Valencia to being dropped off again. We started by being offered something to drink, after which we made Sangria before it was on the 1st step of Pealla preparation, when it was over we were served lovely snacks while the Pealla simmered on the fire. Then we started again and had the most fantastic Pealla made, which we ate in the most lovely surroundings. All in all, a fantastic experience together with some incredibly hospitable people who know how to create just the right setting for a good dining experience. The best recommendations from Britt and Peder.\n\nThis is, by far, the most essential activity if you come to Valencia! Not only does paella taste amazing, but it is a totally immersive experience where you learn about the culture, history, and have an incredibly good time. Rafa and everyone who was part of the day was incredible and made this a memorable, once in a lifetime experience, and it was the highlight of my stay in Valencia\n\nMaria was an enthusiastic and knowledgeable guide. The paella and sangria were first rare and we came away confident that we can make them in the most authentic and traditional ways. We would recommend this class very highly.\n\nI took the cooking class with my husband and brother-in-law. It exceeded all expectations. Maria was engaging, knowledgeable, energetic and passionate. She shared so many interesting facts about Spain and about Valencia. We were lucky to travel in the car with her to and from the home where classes were had. The food was excellent and I learned a lot about making paella. The hosts went out of their way to make us feel \"part of the family\" and we all arrived home so glad we had signed up for this amazing experience. I would recommend this adventure to anyone."
