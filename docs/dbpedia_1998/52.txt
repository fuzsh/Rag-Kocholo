In honor of Independence Day, the daily newspaper "Yediot Ahronoth" published a special issue in which an article about people who work in the depths of the earth was published. (04.25.2023)

And who are the stars in the first photo in the article?

A team of researchers from the Hebrew University, from three different disciplines, who are (among other things) engaged in research inside caves!

Interviewed for the article were Dr. Efrat Gabish Regev, director of the arachnid collection; Shalmi Aharon, doctoral student at the arachnid collection and director of the national plant collection (the herbarium); Boaz Langford, doctoral student in the department of geology and researcher at Malham (the Center for Cave Research); and Mika Ullman, PhD student in the Department of Archaeology.
