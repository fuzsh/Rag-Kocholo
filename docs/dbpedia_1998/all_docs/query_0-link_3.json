We have all seen this happen: we need an article which has been published not long ago, and we discover that no one has a copy of the paper. The National Library receives and preserves all the daily newspapers published in Israel. We invite you to read yesterday's newspaper using our new Press Website. A huge variety of scanned newspapers is accessible to the public."
