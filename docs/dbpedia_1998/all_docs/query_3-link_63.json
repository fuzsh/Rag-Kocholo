        "text": "Israeli occupation forces today acknowledged the death of a soldier, in addition to the serious injury of four others, including two officers, in ground battles in the south and north of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn this context, the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth revealed that the actual number of wounded soldiers in Gaza is much higher than the numbers the army is admitting under the \"permitted to publish\" clause, as reported by hospitals.\n\nThe military correspondent of Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, Yossi Yehoshua, stated that there is a \"long and painful list\" that includes hundreds of soldiers with serious injuries, alongside a larger number of soldiers who sustained moderate and light injuries.\n\nYehoshua pointed out that the \"harsh scenes\" in rehabilitation centers tell a story unknown to Israelis, as the soldiers entering the battle are arriving at hospitals with severe limb injuries, head injuries, and injuries resulting in loss of vision.\n\nHe stressed the importance of urging the public to request comprehensive information to evaluate the extent of the significant damage.\n\nIn this context, the Israeli journalist confirmed that the Israeli occupation's Security Ministry, as well as the rehabilitation and injuries sections in the army, are not prepared to deal with the repercussions that may result from a war of this magnitude.\n\nRead next: IOF: More than 5,000 soldiers assessed as wounded since Oct. 7\n\nIsraeli military forcing hospitals to cover losses: Israeli media\n\nIn light of the recent acknowledgements, it is important to remember that Israeli media reported, on December 8, that the Israeli military spokesperson has imposed new restrictions related to reporting on casualties in the war, including barring hospitals from announcing the arrival of wounded or dead personnel unless permitted by the army.\n\nThe aim is to control the timing of information release at times convenient for the military, Israeli media reported.\n\nHospital spokespersons are now required to \"present the content of their statement to the military spokesperson's representative permanently stationed in the hospital for quick approval before publication.\""
