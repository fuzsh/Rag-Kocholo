        "text": "1.\n\nPrime Minister, Mr Peres has stated that you were personally involved in the ongoing peace negotiations in the Middle East. Could you please tell something about that involvement? Would you give an example of helping to overcome a difficult problem? It is true that only thanks to your intervention did the King of Jordan and the Foreign Minister of Israel agree to a draft for an international conference?\n\nAnswer\n\nYou will perhaps recall the couplet—\n\n“Man may hold all sorts of posts\n\nIf he will only hold his tongue”\n\nIt's very true of politics. All I will say is that I believe that an international conference is the only practical way forward to a peaceful settlement and I shall continue to do what I can to encourage progress towards it.\n\n2.\n\nCould you tell something of your dealings with the Soviets on that topic? Directly and through the offices of Secretary Shultz who was in London on his way from Jerusalem to Moscow?\n\nAnswer\n\nI have discussed these issues with General Secretary Gorbachev and Sir Geoffrey Howe has been through them with the Soviet Foreign Minister. We have used these discussions not only to put the case for an international conference as a framework for discussions between the parties, but to press the right of Jewish people to emigrate from the Soviet Union.\n\n3.\n\nYour Foreign Secretary described early this month the international conference as a non-starter before the US and Israeli elections. What can one do in 1988? [end p1]\n\nAnswer\n\nAn international conference is not something which you leap into. It will of course take time to prepare. The most important thing is to have a clear objective and to use the time available to ensure that when a conference meets, it has the best possible chance of success.\n\n4.\n\nDo you see an agreement in what is left of the eighties?\n\nAnswer\n\nOf course. Time is not on anybody's side, least of all Israel's. Indeed, it has been said that Israel is sitting on a demographic time-bomb. The tenth anniversary of President Sadat 's historic visit to Jerusalem should inspire us all to fresh efforts.\n\n5.\n\nSir Geoffrey Howe has just returned from Jordan and the Arab Summit was just concluded there. Do you have anything new from Amman to share with Mr Peres? Actually is there much you can deal with at your second meeting of the year under the present circumstances?\n\nAnswer\n\nSir Geoffrey Howe discussed with King Hussein the way forward towards an international peace conference and assured him of Britain's full support for this. They also discussed the Iran/Iraq war and the situation in the Gulf. With a statesman of King Hussein 's experience and courage, one always learns something new. Since then, he has chaired a successful Arab Summit. I shall be taking all these matters forward with Mr Peres whom I have always found refreshingly original and inventive in his approach to problems. [end p2]\n\n6.\n\nPrevious Prime Ministers were friendlier to Israel when out of office. You are the exception, a friend in Downing Street. Any explanation, why the difference?\n\n7.\n\nI remember reading in an influential newspaper here that your party did consider looking for an alternative constituency for you as you were not seen as a friend of Israel in the first year or two in your first term as Prime Minister. Now Israel is in love with the Iron Lady. What happened?\n\n8.\n\nWas the change a result of a change of Israeli attitudes with Mr Peres taking over from the Likud? Did the PLO, by breaking faith with you, help change your view of the situation? Or did your view change at all?\n\nAnswer\n\nLet me take your next three questions together. I have always been a great admirer of Israel's achievements. They are remarkable, indeed you have probably achieved more than any other country in a comparable time. That stems from Israel's greatest asset, the resourcefulness and dedication of its people. As you know, I have visited Israel many times: privately, as Secretary of State for Education, and more recently as Prime Minister. I have many friends there. My constituency, Finchley, is twinned with Ramat Gan. So my friendship with Israel goes back a long way and you are well of course if you are trying to suggest that there has been some sudden change in my attitude.\n\nMy visit to Israel as Prime Minister was an unforgettable experience and underlined Britain's commitment to a stable and peaceful future for the Israeli people. But friendship does not mean much unless it also allows frank speaking. And after all Israelis themselves are hardly famed for their reticence! Of course I am a friend of Israel and proud to be so—as also of many Arab governments and peoples. But where I think you are wrong or failing to grasp opportunities, I shall say so. [end p3]\n\n9.\n\nWill peace eventually be attained with, or in spite of, the PLO?\n\nAnswer\n\nAny settlement must be based on two fundamental principles; Israel's right to a secure existence; and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. I have always made clear that the PLO cannot expect to play a full part in negotiations until they accept UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, renounce violence and accept Israel's right to exist. That was the basis on which I offered to see two moderate members of the PLO following my visit to Jordan in 1985. Unfortunately, having first said that they did accept these points, they subsequently faltered and no meeting took place.\n\n10.\n\nDo you sincerely believe that the UK or the UK within the EEC can do anything the US cannot do better alone? If so, what?\n\nAnswer\n\nThe US has, of course, the most important role to play. But it is not an exclusive one. I can think of nothing less helpful than if the US came to be seen as Israel's lawyer and the Soviet Union as the friend of the Arabs. Indeed, it worries me when some of Israel's policies seem to be having that result. That is why I think Britain and the EC can also have a useful role, as a third party if you like, not bound by US or Soviet policies—although of course in practice we work closely with the US. [end p4]\n\n11.\n\nSome might say that you and Mr Peres are dreamers, while Prime Minister Shamir deals in the World of Real Politik. Would they be wrong?\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Long-term Israeli security can be achieved only through peace with all her neighbours. It is those who believe otherwise who are out of touch with reality.\n\n12.\n\nHow much of your friendship to and understanding of Israel is the result of a personal chemistry between you and Mr Peres? Should one expect a cooling off of relations if you have to deal with somebody else?\n\nAnswer\n\nI have known Mr Peres for many years and always admired him. I look forward to talking to him whenever there is a chance. But relations between Britain and Israel are very broadly based and do not depend on any particular personal relationship. And obviously we do business—gladly—with whoever are Israel's elected leaders.\n\n13.\n\nThe number of Jewish members of your Cabinet is out of proportion to their number in the population. Is it because they are more able, trying harder, or because you, Prime Minister, have a personal rapport with them?\n\nAnswer\n\nAll members of my Cabinet are appointed on merit."
