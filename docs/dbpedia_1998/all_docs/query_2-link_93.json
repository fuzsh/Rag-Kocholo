Uri Shenhar\n\non behalf of the First Respondent\n\nAdv. Itamar Gelbfish\n\non behalf of the Second Respondent\n\nJudgment\n\nJudge U. Vogelman\n\n1.The Respondent, a therapist by profession, was arrested on suspicion of committing an indecent act on the Applicant in MCA (Criminal) 8239/12 (hereinafter – the “Applicant”), a minor born in 2006, while he was treating her. The Magistrate Court extended his arrest by two days and granted an order prohibiting publication of any details of the case (hereinafter, “gag order”). Immediately after the arrest, a minor story was published on an Internet news site that reviewed the main suspicions without mentioning the Respondent’s name. The story was removed immediately after the gag order was granted. On completion of the investigation against the Respondent, the Prosecution decided not to prosecute due to lack of sufficient evidence. The Applicant filed an appeal against this decision with the State Attorney. At the same time, the Applicant filed a petition with the Magistrate Court to remove the blanket gag order so that details of the case would be published without the Respondent’s name or any other identifying detail. On April 4, 2012 the Magistrate Court (His Honor Judge T. Uziel) granted the Applicant’s application. The Respondent filed an appeal against this decision. On the filing of the appeal, the District Court (His Honor Judge Z. Kapach) decided to stay implementation of the Magistrate Court’s decision until otherwise decided, and from time to time granted continuances finding that the question whether or not the Respondent would be indicted was material to its decision. In the meantime, the Applicant’s appeal against the decision not to prosecute t was allowed, and the investigation was reopened; a supplemental investigation took place and the Respondent was questioned again. Ultimately the District Attorney once again decided to close the case due to lack of sufficient evidence. The Applicant’s appeal of the second decision is still pending before the State Attorney. On October 25, 2012 the Appellants in this case—a media company and a reporter who works for it—filed an application with the District Court to join the Respondent’s appeal against the decision to allow publication, and expressed their support for the Applicant’s position.\n\n2.On November 6, 2011 the lower court heard the appeal by the Respondent (who was referred to as “appellant”). His appeal was heard together with the Appellants’ application to join the proceedings. The Court reiterated the considerations outlined in the case law for granting a gag on a suspect’s name or investigation detail pursuant to section 70(e1)(1) of the Courts Act [Consolidated Version], 5744-1984 (hereinafter, the “Courts Act” or the “Act”), and held that in the circumstances of this case the scale tips in favor of prohibiting publication of all the case’s details. The Court emphasized that since according to the investigation and prosecution authorities there was insufficient evidence to prosecute, there was no public interest in exposing an incident that might not even occurred. The lower court also held that publicizing the incident as an example in an article written to draw attention to signs of distress displayed by children undergoing therapy, such as the Applicant, does not justify publication since an article can be prepared without detailing a concrete incident; and that the argument that publication might result in the filing of additional complaints where the State has not applied to allow publication for such purpose must be rejected. The Court added that there was concern that the motive of the Applicant’s family was revenge against the Respondent and that, in view of the serious nature of the accusations against the Respondent, there was no doubt that grave and irreversible harm would be caused him if his identity was revealed. Finally the Court held as follows:\n\n“We are living in the age of the Internet. The physical town square has long since disappeared, and has been replaced by a virtual square. If publication of the incident, the occurrence of which is itself in doubt, is permitted, connecting the Appellant to the incident would be easy, as the appellant works in a limited professional circle and because there are many ways to directly or indirectly circumvent the gag order prohibiting publication of a name. This can be done through anonymous comments (talkbacks), forums, Facebook, Twitter and more.\n\nAfter hearing what the minor’s family has to say about the Appellant, as aforesaid, my concern, which I harbored from the outset, that his name will be linked to the incident in roundabout ways, has grown” (pages 7-8 of the judgment) [emphasis in the original].\n\nThe proceedings before us are about this decision.\n\nThe parties’ arguments\n\n3.The Appellants argue that the District Court was not authorized to grant a gag order prohibiting publication of all the details relating to the incident. According to them, section 70(e1)(1) of the Courts Act authorizes the Court to prohibit publication of a suspect’s name or of another investigation detail, but not both together; and in any event it does not authorize the Court to impose a gag order on the details of the entire case. It was also argued that the Court erred in disregarding the potential harm to the Respondent that would result from publishing details of the incident without identifying details; and it erred in allowing all details to be published since the case was closed, as well as in determining that the public has no interest in publishing the incident’s details. The Appellants add that the gag order goes against the principle of public hearings and proceedings and the public’s right to know; that the motive for publication should not have been considered; and that even in the Internet age, publication of legitimate information should not be prevented solely because of the theoretical concern that privileged information would be exposed on-line.\n\nThe Applicant’s arguments mostly overlap with the Appellants’ arguments. The Applicant adds that the Court erred in determining there was concern that the family would expose the Respondent’s name on the Internet in a roundabout way. According to her, had her family wished to do this, it would have done so while the Respondent was under arrest since at that time the arrest was published as a story on the Internet, without his name.\n\nThe State—which was not a party to the proceedings in the lower courts—joined the proceedings before us, and it supports the position of the Appellants and the Applicant.\n\n4.The Respondent objects to publication. First of all, he argues that the Appellants filed an appeal with this Court when they should have filed an application for leave to appeal; and that their appeal should be dismissed for this reason alone. With regard to the application for leave to appeal filed by the Applicant,, the Respondent argued that the appeal does not establish cause for granting leave to appeal to this Court as a “third round.” Substantively, the Respondent argued that the Appellants and the Applicant concealed from this Court the fact that the Applicant’s father serves in a managerial position in the First Appellant, and these proceedings are thus tainted by a lack of good faith; that the Applicant’s parents wish to misuse the investigation material, which was sent to them for their review solely for the purpose of filing an appeal, by publishing its contents in a newspaper; and that the motive of the Applicant’s parents for publication is an attempt to exert pressure on the Prosecution to allow the appeal and thereby prejudice the Respondent. The Respondent further argues that the harm he will suffer as a result of the publication is grave. According to him, the circles close to the case who have general knowledge will be able to identify him in publications about it. The publication would make the case the “talk of the town” amongst his professional community, which would want to know which male therapist is involved, and since there are few male therapists his name would shortly be leaked to the general public, or at the very least to the public interested in therapy such as he offers.\n\nDiscussion and Decision\n\n5.We will first comment on the legislative framework relevant to our discussion. Though currently the District Attorney’s position is that there is insufficient evidence to substantiate reasonable prospects of a conviction and therefore the Respondent should not be indicted, an appeal is pending against this decision. The two courts before us, as well as the litigants and the State, have all assumed section 70(e1) of the Courts Act, which refers to a “suspect” as defined in section 70(e2) of the Act as “someone against whom a criminal investigation has been commenced” applies. I accept this assumption because in appeal proceedings there is de novo review of the matter by the entity in charge of the administrative authority which made the decision. Within the boundary of this review, the entity hearing the appeal steps into the shoes of the entity which gave the decision subject to the appeal and exercises wide and independent discretion in its stead. Accordingly, even though we should keep in mind for the purpose of these proceedings that a decision by the District Attorney not to prosecute the Respondent because of insufficient evidence still stands, so long as the administrative proceedings have not reached a final decision; there is no impediment to seeing the Respondent as “someone against whom a criminal investigation has been commenced” and to trying his case according to the said legislative framework. I therefore do not address the conditions for a gag order regarding the details of an investigation against after a decision not to prosecute and the objection proceedings against that decision exhausted.\n\nThe procedural level: the media’s appeal—by right or with leave?\n\n6.The Appellants appealed against the District Court’s judgment. Were they entitled to do so, or does their appeal require application for leave? On January 18, 2012 the Courts Act (Amendment No. 69), 5772-2012, Book of Laws 122, came into force, which addressed gag orders on investigations and legal proceedings. The beginning of section 70(e1)(1), together with sections 70A(a) and (b) of the Act, provide that a Magistrate Court may prohibit publishing the name of a suspect that has yet to be indicted, or of any other investigation detail, as long as the conditions below are met. As a rule, the Court will impose a gag order under this section pursuant to a suspect’s application (hereinafter, “application for a gag order”). Once the Magistrate Court has imposed a gag order, anyone wishing it be revoked, including the media, may submit an application to the same Court (section 70C(a) of the Act) (hereinafter, “revocation application”). The Respondents in the revocation application will be the suspects, along with any person who was a party to the application for a gag order (section 70B(a)(2) of the Act). Section 70D of the Act regulates appeals against the Magistrate Court’s decision on an application for a gag order or revocation application: there is a right to appeal against either to the District Court, with one judge presiding (sections 70D(a)(1) and (3) of the Act); a judgment on appeal against such decisions may be appealed with leave to the Supreme court, which will hear it before a single judge (section 70D(b) of the Act). Section 70E of the Act authorizes the Minister of Justice, with the Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee’s approval, to regulate applications for a gag order or publication, as well as the procedures for appeals and applications for leave to appeal against decisions on such applications. As of this judgment, the sub-legislature has yet to regulate.\n\n1.Thus, the proper way to revoke a gag order granted under section 70(e1)(1) of the Act is to submit an application with the Magistrats Court that granted the order. However, what is the proper procedure where the Magistrate Court has revoked the order, an appeal against the revocation is pending before the District Court, and a third party, including the media, which was not a party to the original revocation application wishes to argue regarding the order’s revocation? In my view, the third party should submit a joinder application with the District Court in the pending appeal against the Magistrate Court’s decision, as was done in this case. To be sure, the matter in the District Court is a first appeal. Another second appeal with this Court is a “third round” in the entire proceeding, and therefore leave [to appeal] must be granted (compare: MCA (Civil) 4511/05, Bat Yam Municipality v. Ganei Yafit Building & Investment Co. Ltd (July 17, 2005); ALA (Civil) 3385/08, Market Place Systems Ltd v. Teletel Communication Channels Ltd, paragraph 12 (September 25, 2008)). The same result is warranted under the framework that existed before the Amendment to the Act (see ALA (Criminal) 2741/96, Galanti v. State of Israel (April 17, 1996); MCA (Criminal) 424/06, Amar v. Channel 10 News Ltd (February 2, 2006)). Accordingly, contemplating whether the Amendment to the Act applies in our case (here, it should be noted that the first decision of the Magistrates Court,which placed a gag order on the details of the entire case, was given before the Amendment came into force) is unnecessary.\n\n2.It emerges then that the Appellants filed an appeal without having the right to do so. The question therefore arises how one should treat this appeal: can it be converted into an application for leave to appeal, or should it be dismissed for having been submitted without a right to do so? The answer to this question might be influenced by another: since no regulations have been promulgated with regard to the procedure, should this appeal be governed by the Civil Procedure Rules, 5744-1984, or by the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act [Consolidated Version], 5742-1982? Insofar as the appeal is heard as a civil proceeding, the rule is that the appeal cannot be converted into an application for leave to appeal (see, for example, Civ.App. 8154/03, Altori v. Arieh Israel Car Insurance Co. Ltd, paragraph 8 (August 15, 2005); Civ. App. 4540/04, Matach – Educational Technology Center v. Orbuch (September 14, 2006); however, see Civ.App. 2201/07, Choninsky v. Atlantis Multimedia Ltd, paragraph 14 (February 2, 2009)). Insofar as the appeal is heard as a criminal proceeding, the question whether it may be converted into an application for leave to appeal has yet to be clearly answered in our case law.\n\nSince in this case the Applicant filed an application for leave to appeal and since in any event we believe the matter’s importance justifies considering the application as though there was notice of appeal so that the issue will be determined on merits, we also saw no need to decide these questions, and we will leave them for future consideration.\n\n3.To conclude the procedural issues, we would emphasize that though the Applicant’s application for leave to appeal was considered by a panel of three, only one justice of this Court need rule on an appeal against a judgment of the District Court regarding the Magistrate Court’s decision to impose or revoke a gag order (section 70D(b) of the Courts Law)).\n\nWe now turn to discuss the appeal on its merits.\n\nA gag order prohibiting publication of a suspect’s name or other investigation details\n\n4.The issue of a gag order prohibiting publication of identifying details of crime suspects calls for balancing opposing basic principles and constitutional rights. On the one hand, there is the fundamental principle of public hearings and proceedings, a principle enshrined in section 3 of the Basic Law: The Judiciary, and in section 68 of the Courts Act. This principle dictates that as a rule, the details of judicial proceedings, as well as the identity of the litigants, shall be available to the public. This principle is consistent with the broad view that freedom of expression and the public’s right to know are basic principles in a democratic regime, designed to guarantee transparency and serving as a check on the integrity and adequacy of proceedings, so as to strengthen the public’s confidence in the judicial system (MCA (Criminal) 5759/04, Turgeman v. State of Israel, PD 58 (6) 658, 662-664 (2004) (hereinafter, “in re Turgeman”); MCA (Criminal) 5153/04, John Doe v. Yedioth Ahronoth, PD 58 (6) 933, 938 (2004); MCA (Criminal) 1071/10, John Doe v. State of Israel, paragraphs 6-9 (February 25, 2010); MCA (Criminal) 1770/10, John Doe v. State of Israel, paragraph 6 (March 5, 2010)). On the other hand, there are the rights to dignity, reputation and privacy; these too are basic rights in our system and are enshrined in sections 2, 4 and 7 of the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Freedom (MCA (Criminal) 1659/11, Stenger v. State of Israel, paragraph 6 (April 26, 2011); Civ.App. 1697/11, A. Gutman Architects Ltd v. Vardi, paragraph 12 (January 23, 2013) (hereinafter, “in re Vardi”); Civ.App. 751/10, John Doe v. Dayan-Orbach, paragraphs 75-79 of the judgment of Deputy President E. Rivlin, paragraphs 3-4 of the judgment of Justice Y. Amit (February 8, 2012) (hereinafter, “in re Dayan”)). A derivative of liberty rights is that unless prosecuted and convicted, everyone is presumed innocent (MCA (Criminal) 8698/05, Azulai v. State of Israel, PD 60 (3) 168, 174 (2005)). There is no doubt that identifying a person as a crime suspect affects his reputation and privacy and might cause great and irreversible harm. “The publication of a suspect’s name during a criminal investigation, and before an indictment, might be extremely injurious, especially if at the end of the day the investigation concludes without an indictment. The negative image that sticks to a person once his name is published as a crime suspect might last a lifetime, even if at the end of the day the investigation did mature into prosecution” (the words of Justice Ayelet Procatzia in MCA (Criminal) 1071/10, paragraph 8; see also in re Turgeman, on page 670; Civ.App. 214/89, Avneri v. Shapira, PD 43 (3) 856-957 (1989); Yuval Karniel – “Publication of Suspects’ Names – Freedom of Expression versus a Person’s Reputation”, Human and Civil Rights in Israel – page 392 (Tali Ben-Gal et al Editors, 1992)).\n\n5.The legislature instructed on the appropriate balance to strike between these opposing rights, holding that the principle of public hearings and proceedings and the public’s right to know are the rule, and that they shall yield to the need to protect a suspect’s reputation and privacy when exceptional circumstances exist (MCA (Criminal) 1071/10, paragraph 9; in re Turgeman, on page 663). Section 70(e1)(1) of the Courts Act, which details one of the circumstances, provides:\n\nThe court may prohibit publishing of the name of a suspect who has yet to be indicted or other investigation details if it believes that publication might cause the suspect grave harm and that preventing that harm is preferable to the public interest in publication; if the court imposes a gag order prohibiting publication of the name of a suspect who has yet to be indicted, the order shall expire upon the suspect’s indictment, unless the court has determined otherwise.\n\n7.This section confers on the court discretion to prevent identification of a person who is suspected of criminal offences when the interest in protecting his reputation outweighs freedom of expression and the public interest in knowing. A court shall prohibit publication when two aggregate conditions are met. First, the suspect must show the publication might result in “grave harm” to the suspect. It should be emphasized that “ordinary harm” to the suspect is insufficient for the section’s protection to apply. “Publication that is not exceptionally harmful does not trigger the exception” (MCA (Criminal) 1071/10, paragraph 9; see also Civ.App. 2430/06, Yedioth Ahronoth Ltd v. Goldberg (June 4, 2006)). Regarding the question whether a publication might cause “grave harm,” a court will consider, inter alia, the following factors: the suspect’s personal circumstances, his physical and mental state, the nature of the suspect’s occupation and whether it involves contact with people, whether the suspect is a public figure (in which case the harm that publication would cause is greater), whether the suspect has small children who will be harmed by the publication, thereby increasing harm to the suspect, whether the suspect has a relevant criminal history (in which case the harm is diminished), the type and gravity of the offence, and the weight of the evidence gathered in the investigation (in re Turgeman, on pages 670-671).\n\nThe second condition is that preventing grave harm to the suspect should outweigh the public interest in publication. There are two levels to this public interest: the general and the particular. The general level concerns the fundamental principles of freedom of expression, public hearings and proceedings and the public’s right to know. According to (former) Justice M. Cheshin: “This aspect of public interest in publication requires neither proof nor argument. It is self-evident, a starting point for the journey of interpretation. It is a conclusive presumption—let us say, an axiom—that the public has an interest in the publication of court proceedings; court proceedings are in and of themselves interesting to the public and this interest exists in all proceedings” (in re Turgeman, on page 667). In order to determine the extent of the public interest in publication on the particular level – the Court will consider, inter alia, the nature of the acts that the suspect is suspected of committing; the extent to which the publication of the suspect’s name or details of the case might put the public on guard and influence its conduct (and satisfaction of a mere need for gossip does not fall within the scope thereof); whether a public figure is implicated, in which case the public has a greater interest in the case, if the publication can advance the investigation and uncover the truth (for example, if the publication might encourage other victims to come forward), the weight of the evidence gathered against the suspect, the anticipated date of indictment, and the extent to which details of the case were published prior to submitting an application for a gag order (ibid, on pages 667-668).\n\nIn my view, the two conditions listed in section 70(e1)(1) are inter-related and there is a reciprocal between them: the greater the public interest in publication, the more the applicant-suspect will be required to prove that the harm to him, both in terms of likelihood and in terms of extent, is greater. Once a likelihood of “grave harm” and its extent are proven to be very great, a greater public interest is necessary to dismiss the application for a gag order.\n\nPreventing the suspect’s identification\n\n6.As discussed above, the purpose of section 70(e1) of the Act is to prevent the result of grave harm to a person identified as a crime suspect. The section authorizes a Court to reach this purpose in two alternative ways: one is by imposing a gag order prohibiting publication of the suspect’s name. This prevents identification if, as a result, a reasonable person is unable to connect the published information to a specific person (in re Vardi, paragraph 18). However, this will not prevent identification if the publication includes other details that make it possible to identify the suspect (ibid, paragraph 21; Civ.App. 8345/08, Ben Natan v. Bakhri, paragraph 34 (July 27,2011)). Accordingly, the legislature expressly defined: “a suspect’s name . . . including any other detail that might identify the suspect” (section 70(e2) of the Act). Hence, insofar as a court finds that the suspect’s identification can only be prevented by imposing a gag order on publishing details of the whole case, it may do so. The second way to reach the section’s purpose is to impose a gag order against publishing other investigation details, without prohibiting publication of the suspect’s name. This is intended for situations in which publication of the suspect’s name together with certain investigation details would not cause the suspect grave harm, but the publication of a specific detail—for example, suspicion of committing a particular offence among several offences—might cause the suspect grave harm.\n\n7.“Another detail that might identify the suspect” is a detail that passes the “de-anonymization” test. According to this test, “if anyone has key details enabling them to perform ‘reverse engineering’, i.e. to attribute the published information to a particular person, these details must be considered to be identifying information” (in re Vardi, paragraph 22). The information that might lead to identification of a suspect can be divided into two types. One is information that could enable identifying an anonymous suspect. This means information that includes public, distinguishable and unique characteristics that make it possible for a reasonable person made aware of the case’s details for the first time through the publication to identify the suspect involved. The publication of such information might have similar consequences to publishing the actual name. A second type is information that could enable identification of a well-known suspect. This means information that enables a specific person, who has prior knowledge of the suspect or the case, to connect the publication to that information, and identify the suspect. The type of identifying detail, the first or second type, has implications for the extent of the harm the publication could cause the suspect. The premise is that publication that enables any person to identify the suspect (publication of the first type) might cause greater harm than publication that enables identification of the suspect by a more limited number of people (publication of the second type). However, this is only a starting point.\n\nA gag order, the Internet and everything in between\n\n8.The Internet has generated extensive changes in our world. Alongside its many advantages, the Internet poses significant legal challenges. There is no denying that the anonymity characterizing cyberspace somewhat facilitates the commission of torts, and sometimes the commission of criminal offences as well. Against this background, there are those who argue that the digital age has eroded the efficacy of gag orders; after all, the ways to violate it are many and simple. According to this approach, the reason for granting gag orders that permit publication of cases’ details without publishing the suspect’s name has weakened, because the order may be easily violated and the suspect’s identity would become common knowledge. This position must be rejected. The premise is that a court order is not merely a recommendation. Every person is obligated to strictly comply with an order—any order. Public order requires that court orders be complied with, and public interest mandates that the public should know that a court order is followed effectively and that court proceedings were not in vain (ALA (Civil) 3888/04, Sharvat v. Sharvat, PD 59 (4) 49, 58 (2005); the words of His Honor Judge S. Joubran in HCJ 8707/10, Hess v. Minister of Defense (February 3, 2011)).\n\n9.We are not blind to virtual reality and the difficulties of enforcing the law in cyberspace. As is known, there are sometimes real technological challenges to identifying a wrongdoer operating in the shadow of the Internet, especially when that same wrongdoer makes intentional efforts to avoid detection (ALA (Civil) 4447/07, Mor v. Barak E.T.C. (1995) International Telecommunication Services Ltd, paragraph 10 of the opinion of Deputy President E. Rivlin (March 25, 2010) (hereinafter, “in re Mor”)). However, even given this, the concern that gag orders will be routinely violated should not be exaggerated. Contrary to widespread opinion, freedom of expression on the Internet is not absolute. Although the cyber community engages in many and varied activities, such as chat rooms and forums, blogs and content sites, users’ attention is focused primarily on central content providers. As a rule, these providers supervise the content published on their platforms. Moreover, communities that operate under the auspices of official content providers have trained managers who actually serve as regulators and make sure, inter alia, that the content complies with legal requirements. In fact, members of the community themselves might also act as regulators for the purpose of maintaining order. These are all important self-regulatory mechanisms, which might help ensure gag orders are followed on the Internet (see and compare: Karine Barzilai-Nahon and Gad Barzilai, “Actual and Imagined Freedom of Expression on the Internet: On the Abolishment and Rebirth of Censorship”, Quiet, Speaking! 483, 485, 491-497 (Michael Birnhack, Editor, 2006)).\n\nOne should not overlook that when a case is earth-shattering or expected to have a particularly wide impact that extends beyond the borders of the State, it is possible that in the Internet age an order will not prevent information about the affair from quickly becoming common knowledge. Accordingly, in those exceptional cases a different position might be necessary. Since, and as detailed below, this case is not one of those cases there is no need for me to lay down hard and fast rules about this category. The discussion below will not refer to it, and it shall remain open for future consideration.\n\n10.In addition to the self-regulatory mechanisms on the Internet detailed above, there are State law enforcement mechanisms. Law enforcement authorities must make a constant effort to keep up with technological developments so that offenders can be brought to justice, for which purpose they may use the tools the legislature has put at their disposal. We live in a law-abiding country and violating a court order has consequences in the real world. Thus, violating a gag order might carry various sanctions: anyone harmed by the violation may recover from the wrongdoer for breach of a statutory duty under section 63 of the Torts Ordinance [New Version]; the order’s violation might constitute a criminal offence under section 70(f) of the Courts Act; and violation can be considered contempt of court under section 6 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, a section that authorizes a court to compel one to comply with an order through a fine or arrest.\n\n11.Indeed, one should not overlook the fact that publication of the details of an investigation in which there is public interest, even in general terms and without noting the suspect’s name, will garner greater and faster exposure than in the past. Deputy President E. Rivlin addressed this as follows:\n\n“The Internet is the new “town square” where everything is shared. The new medium – cyberspace – is everywhere and is open to all. The tools it offers, including ‘chat rooms’, e-mail, surfing the World Wide Web (browsing) and social networks – make it possible to obtain and pass on information, ‘listen in’ on others’ opinions and voice one’s own. It is therefore a quintessential democratic means to advance the principle of equality and protect against government intrusion on freedom of speech through legislation. The keyboard is available to every writer, and tapping a ‘mouse’ takes the written word to all four corners of the Earth. The public does not need, as it did in the past, a platform provided by others . . . [a]ny member of the public may and can create a ‘newspaper’ of his or her own and say his or her piece in a blog” (in re Mor, paragraph 14; see also Asaf Harduf, “Online Crime” 134-135 (2010)).\n\nThe more interesting a case is and theof more individuals’ interests that may be impacted, the more reasonable it is to assume that a wider public will discuss it online. In the case of a publication that attributes to a person an offence that involves particular revulsion and disgust, the publication might rumors about the identity of those involved and raise suspicions against specific people.\n\n12.We would again mention that an important and central characteristic of publication on the Internet is the possibility of anonymity. “The distinctiveness of talkbacks is in their anonymity, in the fact that they are posted in response to articles written by others and in the use of available platforms for voicing individual opinions. Involved therefore is an accessible and instant way [of communicating] that is free of geographical borders and frequently free of filtering and editing, not to mention—also anonymous” (in re Mor, ibid). It is undisputed that in today’s reality a person wishing to publish something online and remain anonymous may do so without any real difficulty, and that there are many people who exploit this anonymity and break the law under the assumption that it will be impossible to identify them and bring them to justice (See and compare: in re Mor, paragraphs 10-17; Civ.App. 9183/09, The Football Association Premier League Limited v. Peloni (May 13, 2012); the explanatory notes on the Draft Exposing the Identity of a Publisher of Online Content Act, 5772-2012, Government Bills 1376; Michael Birnhack “Exposure of Anonymous Online Browsers”, “Laws” on 51 (2010); Michael Birnhack, “Private Space – The Right to Privacy between Law and Technology” 299-300 (5771); Amal Jabarin and Yitzhak Cohen, “Importance of the Identity of Anonymous Internet Users – Institutional Viewpoint,” Law Research 28 7, 8-10 (2012)). Although the premise is that the online press in Israel, as well as anyone notified of a gag order, will comply with the order, one should not overlook the fact that there are many Internet sites—including blogs, social networks and forums—that do not employ routine supervision, in real time, of everything published on them. Given this reality, it indeed is impossible to guarantee that a suspect’s identity will not be exposed on the Internet. Although it is possible to retroactively remove a prohibited publication published in Israel on the application of the suspect to the site after the fact, until the publication is removed from the site it might garner varying degrees of exposure.\n\n13.In sum, the exposure of an investigation with potential for public interest, together with the possibility of anonymously publishing information on the Internet, increases the concern that the suspect’s identity will be revealed despite a gag order. The greater the interest to the public, the greater the likelihood of the suspect’s identity being revealed and that the suspect will be caused “grave harm” as a result. That said, assessing this likelihood involves a great degree of uncertainty. Inter alia, it is difficult to assess whether the suspect’s name would indeed be leaked on the Internet and, as discussed, the presumption is that this would not necessarily happen. Factors to be considered are the period of time that would be required for a name to be removed, the extent and pace of exposure until removal, and the expected harm to the suspect (i.e. the likelihood that the suspect’s identity is exposed coupled with the harm that might be caused if the identity is exposed).\n\n14.When considering whether or not to prohibit publication of additional details, should a court take into account, inter alia, the possibility that a gag order will be violated, to the extent of imposing a gag order on the details of the entire case? In my view, this question should be answered in the affirmative. The object of section 70(e1)(1) of the Act is to enable a court to properly balance opposing interests—freedom of expression and the public’s right to know, and protecting the suspects’ reputation, privacy and presumption of innocence. An a priori finding that one should not include in the balancing equation the possibility that a gag order will be infringed—even when proved that this is a real possibility—will undermine the purpose of the section and the court’s role in its realization. In my opinion, it is incumbent on the Court to also consider the likelihood that publishing the details of a case under investigation even without mentioning the suspect’s name would lead to the suspect’s identification and cause “grave harm.” This likelihood and the consequent harm expectancy will in any event be considered on the merits and according to the circumstances, although one can point to, without exhaustion, the following guiding considerations: the extent of the interest the case might generate, the extent of the impact and exposure resulting from this interest, possible motivations of those who know the suspect’s identity to reveal it and whether the suspect has specified a concrete person with such motivation, and possible motivations of those who do not know the suspect’s identity to learn it.\n\n15.To be sure, in the circumstances described above, it cannot be presumed that the identity of the person whose name and any identifying detail has been prohibited for publication will be exposed. Vague arguments regarding possible future violation of a gag order are not a good reason for refusing to grant the order to begin with. As emphasized, the argument that possible future violation of a gag order makes granting it superfluous must fail because the practical implications of accepting such an argument are that granting the order is futile, and that those applying for orders must cease making applications to the court—even if there their application is with merit. Possibility of infringement does not justify rejecting applications for orders where prohibition is warranted. If this is done in a democracy— “freedom and anarchy will become synonymous” (compare: Crim.App. 126/62, Dissenchick v. The Attorney-General, PD 17 169, 179 (1963)).\n\nThe premise is therefore that an order will be followed and that it is sufficient to prevent identification. A suspect applying to prevent publication of additional details to the point of a blanket gag order covering the details of the entire case must show that in their specific circumstances, there is a real concern—that is, not a vague concern—that the order will be infringed, that the publication will result in identification, that the identification will cause “grave harm”, and that the public interest in preventing this harm outweighs the public interest in publication.\n\nFrom the general to the particular\n\n16.The Magistrate Court set aside the blanket gag order that was initially imposed on the entire case, and instead granted a gag order prohibiting publication of the suspect’s name, place of residence, the location of his clinic, and any other detail that might result in his identification. In doing so the Magistrate Court assumed that publication of any of these details might result in identification of the Respondent, that he would be caused grave harm as a result, and that preventing the harm outweighs the public interest in publication. The Applicant and the Appellants did not object to this decision, and rightly so. In my opinion, the circumstances of the case fulfill the conditions tipping the scale in favor of prohibiting the Respondent’s identification. With regard to the first condition, there is no doubt that publishing the Respondent’s name would have caused him “grave harm.” “The disgrace that follows sexual offences against minors is very powerful, and it is one of the lowest offences that carry such disgrace” (in re Turgeman, on page 672). The potential harm to the Respondent’s reputation and to his privacy should he be identified is significant and obvious. This harm is intensified in light of the Respondent’s occupation and the harm that publication would cause to his livelihood. The Respondent has children who are not aware of the suspicions against him and the publication would also harm them thus increase the harm to him. The Respondent has no criminal history. Currently, the District Attorney believes there is insufficient evidence to establish reasonable prospects of a conviction and that the Respondent should not be prosecuted, even though this decision is subject to appeal before the State Attorney and thus is not final (and it should be emphasized that we are not expressing any position regarding the appeal’s prospects).\n\nAs to the second condition, concerning the public interest in publication, here too, the scales tip in favor of preventing the revealing of Respondent’s identity, as opposed to imposing a blanket gag order on the entire case. Although the act that the Respondent is suspected of committing is indeed serious, at this stage, the Prosecution believes that the weight of the evidence against him is not sufficient to warrant prosecution. The State did not argue that the publication of his name might encourage additional complaints against him. It did not try to suspend his license and he is continuing to work in his field. Nor was it argued that the publication of the Respondent’s name would advance the investigation and discovery of the truth. The Respondent is not a public figure. In these circumstances, the main argument for publishing details of the case is freedom of expression, public hearings and proceedings and the public’s right to know, as well as the public as a check on the investigating authority and the Prosecution. For such purposes, publishing the name is not essential.\n\n17.Should a blanket gag order have been imposed on the details of the entire case? The premise is that the Respondent’s identity should not be exposed. In order to prohibit publishing additional details—to the point of imposing a blanket gag order (as ordered by the District Court)—the Respondent should have shown that had publication of other details not been prohibited, he would be occasioned “grave harm”; and that the interest in protecting his reputation and privacy in the circumstances of the case takes precedence over the public interest in knowing the details of the affair. I will now turn to review these conditions.\n\nDid the Respondent meet his burden to show he would be caused “grave harm”? It is undisputed that since publishing the Respondent’s name (including any identifying detail) falls under the gag order, the likelihood that a reasonable person who is not acquainted with the Respondent would link him to the crimes of which he is suspected and identify him is inherently diminished. The likelihood that he will be caused “grave harm” is therefore considerably low. However, the Magistrate Court’s gag order does not eliminate the possibility of identifying the Respondent. The Respondent argues there is a real concern his name would be leaked on the Internet or that the rumor mill would point to him and cause him “grave harm.” As noted above, there is an inherent difficulty in predicting how matters will develop and one cannot avoid an assessment that is based on life experience, logic and common sense, with assistance from the guiding considerations delineated above.\n\n18.Given the nature of the case—suspicion that a therapist who treats young children committed sexual offenses on a patient—it is reasonable to assume that its publication will generate interest among parents whose children are treated by a male therapist. It is possible that parents who learn of the case will try and find out who is involved and to make sure that the person treating their child is not the Respondent. It is also possible that therapists—who are not necessarily aware that a gag order has been granted—will be interested in who is involved; and hence the publication will garner exposure and create an impact. This discourse will somewhat increase the likelihood Respondent will be identified or suspected. It should also be noted that the District Court expressed concern that the Applicant’s family will expose the Respondent’s identity “in roundabout ways.”\n\n19.Even though one cannot rule out the possibility that the Respondent’s identity will be revealed despite a gag order prohibiting the publication of his identity, it appears that the expectancy of grave harm that might be caused to the Respondent is low. I will clarify. Firstly, I am aware that the District Court believed that the statements of the Applicant’s family vis-à-vis the Respondent increase the concern “that his name will, in roundabout ways, be linked to the event.” However, I believe that this finding is insufficient to establish a real concern that the order would be violated. The reality is that until now the family has not violated the order, directly or indirectly. Secondly, the Respondent’s arrest and the nature of the suspicions against him were published in mainstream media for a short period of time until they were removed, but his identity, he agrees, remained confidential, and the publication did not result in the “violating” publications he fears. This shows that this case is not one of those “special and exceptional” cases I discussed above, and attests to the proper weight that should be given to concerns regarding violations of the order and harm expectancy. Thirdly and primarily, while a gag order prohibiting publication of any identifying detail stands, without identifying publication by any credible media outlet these publications would amount to nothing more than rumors or suspicions, even if there were violating “leaks.” It goes without saying that the harm that might be caused as a result is infinitely less than the harm caused by an identifying publication in the central media in the absence of a gag order.\n\n20.Against the expectancy of grave harm, which is not high, one should weigh the public interest in publication. This balance leads to the conclusion that publication of the case’s details should be permitted, without the Respondent’s name or any detail that could lead to his identification. We discussed above the importance of public hearings and proceedings and the public’s right to know generally, and there is no need to repeat this. On the level of the particular, the following should be considered:\n\nFirstly, publishing the suspicions against the Respondent and the symptoms that the Applicant displayed might increase parents’ awareness and vigilance about the type of harm that the Respondent is suspected of causing, draw parents’ and other therapeutic bodies’ attention to signs of distress minors display, and encourage parents to take reasonable precautions. Such publication might even facilitate public discussion on the issue. It is important and appropriate to respect the public’s right to know and to give the public the power to choose whether and how to respond.\n\nSecondly, there is no need to elaborate on the fact that media scrutiny is a cornerstones of any democracy and that enforcement authorities are not immune to this, including in this case. In such context and as a matter of principle, timing should also factor. As a rule, one should aspire to enable the press to publish in real time concrete information about newsworthy cases on the public agenda, since “the democratic system of governance is sustained, and even dependent on a free flow of information about the central subjects influencing public life and private life” (HCJ 1/81, Shiran v. The Broadcasting Authority, PD 35 (3) 365, 378 (1981)).\n\n8.To be sure, when considering the weight of the public interest one must consider that a decision to prosecute has yet to be made and that the District Attorney’s position is that there is insufficient evidence to do so. This information somewhat reduces public interest in publication, although it does not eliminate it (compare: Crim.App. (Tel Aviv District) 989/79, Borochov v. Yafet, DJ 5743 (B) 521 (1983); Uri Shenhar, The Law of Defamation 243 (1997); Eitan Levontin “The Authority to Limit the Publication of Suspects’ Names”, “Mishpatim” 30 249, 253-255 (5760); Raphael Bashan “The Journalist and the Public, Interview with the President of the Israel Press Council, Mr. Yitzhak Olshan”, Journalists’ Yearbook 7, 11 (5726)). One should also take into account that a decision on the State Attorney’s appeal is still pending, such that this result might change (of course without taking a stand). Accordingly, though the public interest is intertwined, inter alia, with the question whether the Respondent did in fact commit the acts of which he is suspected, the status of decisions regarding possible prosecution does not lead to the conclusion that at this time this case is of no interest to the public.\n\nBefore closing it should be emphasized that all this does not amount to taking any stand on the question of the proper balance should the Applicant’s appeal be dismissed, and the decision not to prosecute the Respondent becomes final.\n\nConclusion\n\n21.From all the above, I believe that when balancing between the expectancy of “grave harm” that might be caused to the Respondent from a limited publication, which is, as clarified, not high, and the public interest in publication, publication of the case should be permitted, while omitting the name of the Respondent and any identifying detail. I therefore propose to my colleagues that the appeal be upheld and that the Magistrate Court’s order be reinstated.\n\n___________________\n\nJudge Y. Amit\n\nI agree with the judgment of my colleague Justice U. Vogelman, and would briefly add and remark as follows.\n\n1.As noted by my colleague at the beginning of his remarks (paragraph 5 of his judgment), the parties assumed that the Respondent qualifies as a “suspect” under section 70(e2) of the Courts Act [Consolidated Version], 5744-1984 (hereinafter, “the Courts Act”) as “someone against whom a criminal investigation has been commenced.” Ex facie, it seems that section 70(e) refers to a “suspect” before a decision regarding prosecution is made, as emerges from the provision that a gag order will expire “on the filing of charges.” However, the Respondent in this case is not the usual “suspect” to whom the section refers; his status is that of a “former suspect” in that the investigation into his actions has been completed, a decision not to prosecute has been made, an appeal against the decision has been dismissed, and an appeal before the State Attorney against that decision is still pending. Nonetheless, since the parties referred to the Respondent as a “suspect” and since section 70(e) is the section most applicable to this case, I see no impediment to treating that section as the relevant statutory framework. In any event, and as noted by my colleague, this decision does not relate to the state of affairs after exhaustion of appeal proceedings against the decision to end the investigation without prosecution.\n\n2.Section 68(b)(5) of the Courts Act authorizes a court to hold a closed and confidential hearing “in order to protect the interest of someone complaining or who has been accused of a sexual offence ” and section 70(a) of the Act provides that “a person shall not publish any information about a discussion that took place in a closed hearing without the court’s permission.” Hence, the Respondent is wondering how it is possible that had he been prosecuted and his status was that of “defendant,” the court would have been authorized to hold a closed hearing and grant a gag order, but the court has no authority to grant such order to protect a suspect, let alone a “former suspect.”\n\nTo this I would reply that the question is not one of authority but one of discretion. A closed hearing is not the final word and cannot be considered an “automatic” gag order; rather, a court must find that the conditions for a full or partial gag order exist (Civ.App. 2800/97, Lifson v. Gahel, PD 43 (3) 714 (1999); HCJ 6005/93, Eliash v Judge Shmuel Tzur, PD 49 (1) 159 (1995); ALA (Civil) 3007/02, Yoav Yitzhak V. Moses, PD 56 (6) 592 (2002); MCA (Criminal) 8698/05, Azulai v. State of Israel (October 19, 2005)).\n\n3.I do not deny that the likelihood the Respondent’s identity will be exposed is considerable. His family and close friends are aware of the case and, as argued, it should be assumed that the publication would create a “buzz” about his work in therapy. Neither do I make light of the Respondent’s argument that the investigation and brief arrest were traumatic for him, and that the mere fact of publication will exacerbate his emotional injuries.\n\nAdditionally, I found it hard to see the great public interest in the case (the use of the word “case” relates to the proceedings in their entirety and does not derogate from the Respondent’s argument that so far as he is concerned there was no offence to create a case to begin with). Regrettably, sexual offences garner almost daily reports in the media, sometimes even sensationalist coverage at the beginning of news edition and in bold newspaper headings, such that I doubt publication of this case would increase public awareness and vigilance. I also wonder how the public might be disadvantaged if publication is delayed until the State Attorney’s decision on the Applicant’s appeal, if only to alleviate the Respondent’s concern that the publication is designed to pressure the Prosecution.\n\n4.Nonetheless, I believe publication should be permitted within the limits the Magistrate Court has established, such as being motivated by the following.\n\nFirstly, the Respondent’s case has already been reviewed and considered by two mechanisms, and both decided there was no room to prosecute. Actually, given his current status of “former suspect,” someone who enjoys a somewhat “greater” presumption of innocence, the harm that might be caused because of the publication is less than that which would be caused to an ordinary “suspect,” whose case has only been brought before a court, for example, in the process of requesting an arrest warrant.\n\nSecondly, the argument that as long as the appeal is pending with the State Attorney there is no case, and in any event there is no public interest, should be rejected. The public has an interest in reviewing reasons for the investigation and prosecution authorities’ decisions, and the public’s right to know does not necessarily depend on the result these authorities reach.\n\nIn essence, non-publication of identifying or other details should be distinguished from non-publication of the case’s existence itself. The Respondent referred to the matter of The News Company (Crim.App. 11793/05, The Israeli News Company Ltd v. State of Israel (April 5, 2006)), but that case also involved the blurring of identifying details only, and not a gag order on the entire matter, despite the concern that blurring would be ineffective in the complainant’s close circle. The legislation and the case law primarily deal with publishing identifying details of a suspect, an accused or complainant of sexual offences. Thus, section 70A of the Courts Act deals with an “application regarding publication of a suspect’s name” and section 70B deals with “parties to an application regarding publication of a suspect’s name.” The Draft Courts Act (Amendment No. 31) (Prohibition of Publication), 5761-2001, DL 496, states it aims to expand the Court’s authority [and] “. . . prohibit publication of a suspect’s name, even where [the court] found the publication could cause the suspect grave harm, while balancing the suspect’s interest against the public interest in publication [.]”\n\nTo be sure, the emphasis is on publishing identifying details about the suspect, as opposed to publishing the existence of the case or the proceedings. Thus, in In re Turgeman, in the context of a gag order prohibiting publication of a suspect’s name, Justice Cheshin left the question “what is the fate of a gag order where it has been decided not to prosecute John Doe” undecided. A blanket gag order prohibiting publication of the fact that the events even occurred constitutes a case in the shadows. This result is difficult to accept both considering normative outcomes for the public’s right to know and considering the practical possibility of losing information in the bustling Internet world.\n\nAnd from another angle: ordinarily, when the police and the courts are not involved, there is no impediment to the media in publishing news about one’s claim that they or their relative was a victim of a sexual offence. It is difficult to accept that the Respondent should find himself in a “better” position than any other person merely because investigation and arrest proceedings were instituted against him, by a gag order prohibiting publication of news about the very existence of the proceedings.\n\n5.Against this background, I concur with the outcome of my colleague.\n\n___________________\n\nJustice E. Hayut\n\nI concur with the opinion of my colleague Justice U. Vogelman and her outcome. Nonetheless, I wish to make several comments.\n\n1.As noted by my colleagues, the parties’ premise was that the Respondent is still presumed a “suspect” as defined in section 70(e2) of the Courts Act [Consolidated Version], 5744-1984 (hereinafter, “Courts Act” or the “Act”) and that section 70(e1)(1), which authorizes the court to grant a gag order against publishing the name of a suspect who has yet to be prosecuted, or of another investigation detail applies. This was indeed the focus of the decisions in the appeal and consequently of the parties’ arguments. And rightfully so, as my colleague Justice U. Vogelman clarifies, since at this stage an appeal is still pending. Nonetheless, the Respondent’s status is closer to that of a “former suspect” (subject to the decision on the pending appeal). Hence, the question: what is the fate of someone who was presumed a “suspect” after a decision not to prosecute was made and the appeal proceedings were exhausted? In such a case, is a court still authorized, under section 70(e1)(1), to issue a gag order in respect to the Respondent and, under such circumstances, what is the status of a gag order granted while he was still a suspect? This issue was not raised and thus was not clarified in the decisions and submissions before us. Hence, I will not elaborate on this and will settle for mere preliminary thoughts.\n\n2.The end of section 70(e1)(1) of the Courts Act provides that if a court grants a gag order against publishing the name of a suspect who has yet to be prosecuted “the gag order will expire upon the suspect’s prosecution.” A possible interpretation of this provision is that “from the positive follows the negative” and therefore when a decision is made not to prosecute a suspect and the investigation is closed, the gag order remains in force. This approach is consistent prima facie with the view that once a decision not to prosecute is made, the former suspect’s interest in protecting his reputation grows stronger, because, unlike a suspect who enjoys a strong presumption of innocence during the investigation stage, we are now dealing with someone whom law enforcement authorities have already decided should not be prosecuted. Accordingly, it can be said that once the investigation into a suspect has been closed, the balance between the public interest in public hearings and proceedings and the private interest of the former suspect whose details shall not be published shifts toward the private interest (for comparison regarding shifting the balance where there was prosecution: MCA (Criminal) 10731/08, Mitzkin v. State of Israel, paragraph 17 (January 4, 2009)). And indeed, in this context one cannot dismiss the approach that retroactive publication of a criminal investigation that ended might also harm the reputation of the former suspect and establish his negative reputation in the eyes of those who believe that “where there is smoke there is fire” (see and compare: MCA (Criminal) 1071/10, Moshe v. State of Israel, paragraph 8 (February 25, 2010); MCA (Criminal) 5759/04, Turgeman v. State of Israel, Piskei Din [Judgments] 58 (6) 658, 570 (2004)).\n\n3.On the other hand, a gag order prohibiting publication is the exception to the rule regarding public hearings and proceedings and precedent instructs that exceptions are only permitted under circumstances expressly listed in the Act (see MCA (Criminal) 8698/05, Azulai v. State of Israel, PD 60 (3) 168, 174 (2005)). Accordingly, and in the absence of express authorization to the Court under the Act to prohibit publication of the name or investigation details concerning a former suspect, there is merit to the argument that a gag order granted during investigation under section 70(e1)(1) of the Act expires not only upon prosecution (according to the end of the section), but also when a decision not to prosecute is made and the investigation closed. Then the general rule is restored and the principle of public hearings and proceedings applies in full. That publication after a decision not to prosecute alleviates harm to the former suspect’s reputation because it is accompanied, naturally, by publishing the decision against prosecution supports this view (see Eitan Levontin “On the Authority to Limit Publication of Suspects’ Names”, Mishpatim 30, 249, 313-314 (5760)). In other words, contrary to publishing details about a suspect in the course of a criminal investigation where the suspect generally has limited tools to combat published suspicions, the mere decision not to prosecute provides the former suspect with a significant tool to protect his reputation from negative impact resulting from publication of an investigation that has ended. Since the gravity of potential harm to a former suspect’s reputation diminishes as a result of publication, the balance shifts toward the public interest in maintaining pubic hearings and proceedings and publication about an investigation and its details once closed should not be prevented. It goes without saying that according to this approach, the former suspect is still able to object by bringing defamation suits against any publication of distorted, partial, or misleading information about the investigation (see ibid).\n\nThus, this issue cuts both ways and though my opinion sways in favor of the second approach, I am not required to decide here and the statements that I have made in a nutshell do not exhaust the issue.\n\n___________________\n\nDecided in accordance with the judgment of Justice U. Vogelman.\n\nGiven today, February 24, 2013.\n\nHCJ 258/07\n\nMK Zahava Galon\n\nv.\n\nGovernment Commission of Investigation for Examining the Events of the 2006 War in Lebanon\n\nThe Supreme Court sitting as the High Court of Justice\n\n[6 February 2007]\n\nBefore President D. Beinisch, Vice-President E. Rivlin\n\nand Justice A. Procaccia\n\nPetition to the Supreme Court sitting as the High Court of Justice.\n\nFacts: The government set up a commission of investigation to examine what happened in the war in Lebanon in 2006. The commission decided to hold all of its proceedings in camera and not to publish any transcripts of the proceedings, on the ground that they were privileged for the reason of state security. This decision was challenged by the petitioner, who argued that the proceedings should only be held in camera if holding them in public would give rise to a near certainty of serious harm to state security, and that transcripts of those parts of the proceedings that did not satisfy this test should be published. The commission argued that it could not know in advance whether testimonies would contain privileged matters or not. It also argued that publishing the transcripts would require considerable work given the need to exclude matters that were privileged and proposed to do so only after presenting its final report, since to do so earlier would delay the preparation of the report.\n\nHeld: Most of the testimonies had already been heard by the commission when the petition was filed. Therefore, the question of hearing those testimonies in public was no longer relevant. The commission did not dispute that it was subject to the rule of publicity, according to which holding proceedings in public is the rule whereas holding them in camera is the exception. The presumption should therefore be that the commission would conduct itself accordingly, and would examine whether all or some of the testimonies that might be heard at a later stage could be heard in public. With regard to the publication of the transcripts of the commission’s hearings, the court held that the commission should publish those parts of the transcripts that were not privileged within a reasonable time, before the final report was presented to the government. Subject to these guidelines, the petition was denied.\n\nPetition denied.\n\nLegislation cited:\n\nAdministrative Courts Law, 5752-1992, s. 25, 25(b)(1).\n\nBasic Law: Administration of Justice, s. 3.\n\nCourts Law [Consolidated Version], 5744-1984, ss. 68, 68(a), 68(d)(1), 68(d)(2).\n\nCommissions of Inquiry Law, 5729-1968, ss. 1, 9-11, 14, 15, 18, 18(a), 20, 20(a), 20(c), 22, 23, 27(a), 27(b).\n\nFreedom of Information Law, 5758-1998, ss. 1, 9(a)(1).\n\nGovernment Law, 5761-2001, ss. 8A, 8A(a), 8A(c).\n\nIsraeli Supreme Court cases cited:\n\n[1] HCJ 6728/06 Omets v.

Beinisch\n\nThe Government Commission of Investigation for Examining the Events surrounding the 2006 Lebanon War has until now conducted its proceedings and heard all the testimonies in camera. The transcripts of the Commission’s proceedings have not been published. The Commission’s position is that only after the final report is presented to the government will it decide whether to publish those parts of the transcript that may be disclosed without harming the security of the state or other protected interests. The petition before us is directed at the commission’s position.\n\nThe main facts and the sequence of events\n\n1. On 12 July 2006, following terrorist operations carried out by the Hezbollah organization, in which eight IDF soldiers were killed and two others were kidnapped to Lebanon, fighting began in the north and this continued until 14 August 2006 when a ceasefire came into effect in accordance with decision no. 1701 of the Security Council of the United Nations (hereafter: ‘the Second Lebanon War’ or ‘the war’).\n\nOn 17 September 2006 the Government of Israel decided to authorize the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence to appoint a government commission of investigation under s. 8A of the Government Law, 5761-2001 (hereafter: ‘the Government Law’), to examine the conduct of the political and defence establishments during the war. It was decided that the president emeritus of the Tel-Aviv-Jaffa District Court, Judge E. Winograd, would chair the commission (hereafter: ‘the Winograd Commission’ or ‘the Commission’). In the letter of appointment the Commission was authorized to determine findings and reach conclusions as to the readiness and conduct of the political and security establishment ‘with regard to all the aspects of the war in the north.’ The Commission was also authorized to recommended, in so far as it saw fit, ‘any improvement for the future decision-making processes of the political echelon and the heads of the security establishment, including the materials and advice given to the aforesaid authorities.’ The letter of appointment further determined that the Prime Minister and members of the cabinet, civil servants, IDF and security establishment personnel would appear before the Commission at its request and would provide any information and documents that they would be asked to present. The Commission was given powers of a commission of inquiry under ss. 9 to 11 and 27(a) of the Commissions of Inquiry Law, 5729-1968 (hereafter: ‘the Commissions of Inquiry Law’ or ‘the law’). With regard to the publicity of the Commission’s work, the government determined in its decision — and an identical stipulation was also included in the commission’s letter of appointment — the following:\n\n‘F. The commission shall present its report or reports to the prime minister and the Minister of Defence and they will bring them before the government. The report or reports of the commission shall be published; the commission may determine guidelines with regard to publication of the reports in accordance with the principles in section 20 of the Commissions of Inquiry Law, 5729-1968.\n\nG. The commission shall determine its procedure and its work schedule. The commission’s sessions shall be public or closed to the public as the commission shall decide.\n\nNo public proceedings shall take place when this may endanger the security of the state or its foreign relations or when there is any other lawful reason that prohibits this.’\n\n2. On 30 November 2006 an expanded panel of this Court denied by a majority two petitions directed in principle against the Government’s decision to establish a government commission of investigation rather than to order the establishment of a state commission of inquiry in order to examine the conduct of the political and security establishments during the war (HCJ 6728/06 Omets v. Prime Minister [1]). An application to hold a further hearing on the subject of the aforesaid petitions was also denied (HCJFH 10030/06 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Prime Minister [2]).\n\nThe Winograd Commission began to hear testimony on 4 October 2006 and since then has heard dozens of witnesses. All the witnesses were heard in camera. On 29 November 2006 — approximately two months after the Commission began to hear the testimonies — the petitioner, MK Zahava Gal-On, submitted a request to Judge Winograd that the Commission should open its sessions to media coverage and publish the transcripts of the testimonies, with the exception of the parts whose publication would almost certainly cause serious harm to the security of the state. On 30 November 2006 Judge Winograd replied to the petitioner’s request as follows:\n\n‘You are doubtless aware of the fact that most of the subjects in the commission’s deliberations include state secrets. Until now, although the testimonies of the witnesses also included matters that are not classified, the vast majority was classified, and therefore the disclosure of the testimonies to the general public has not been possible.\n\nWe are aware of the issue of “the public’s right to know,” and we consider this right in every case against the security of the state and the need to protect its secrets, which in our opinion — and I am convinced that this is your opinion also — should take precedence.\n\nIn the government decision that appointed the commission it is stated that the sessions of the commission shall be public or closed to the public, as the commission shall decide. In any case where it is possible, the session will be public…’\n\nIt should be noted that on 3 December 2006 — several days after judgment was given denying the petitions against the establishment of the Winograd Commission (Omets v. Prime Minister [1]) — the commission made a statement to the media. This statement said, inter alia, that —\n\n‘The commission will continue its work in an attempt to examine what it had been asked to examine and to provide a quick, thorough and appropriate response to the many issues before it. Naturally most of the testimonies and sessions will be classified. In so far as it will be possible without harming the security of the state, sessions and testimonies will be held in public.’\n\n3. On 9 January 2007 — more than five weeks after Judge Winograd’s reply — the petitioner filed the petition before us. In the petition, the petitioner requested this Court to order the Winograd Commission (1) to hold its sessions and the hearing of the testimonies before it in public and, (2) to publish the transcripts of its deliberations at the end of each session, except when ‘there is a near certainty of real, serious and grave harm to the security of the state.’ On 17 January 2007 this Court, per Justice Levy, issued an order nisi to the respondent to reply to the petition, and the application for an interim order was denied. Justice Levy added in his decision that —\n\n‘It seems to me that the commission would do well if, until this court decides the petition, it limits itself to hearing testimonies that need to be heard in camera for reasons of state security or that may be privileged by virtue of an order prohibiting publication, in accordance with the principles that have been laid down and explained in case law…’\n\nWhen the petition was filed, the Winograd Commission was close to completing the stage of hearing the preliminary testimonies before publishing an interim report. After it finishes hearing these testimonies, the Commission intends to present an interim report to the government that will contain an open part that will be published and a privileged part that will not be. Counsel for the state told us that the Commission cannot definitively say the date on which the interim report will be presented but emphasized that we are not speaking of many months, but rather of a relatively early date.\n\nThe arguments of the parties\n\n4. In the petition and also in her pleadings before us, counsel for the petitioner, Advocate D. Holz-Lechner, discussed the centrality of the public’s right to know and the importance of this principle in the democratic process and in safeguarding basic rights. According to her, the proceedings before the Winograd Commission concerning the conduct of the political and defence establishments during the Second Lebanon War is of great public importance since the matter concerns human lives and public security. She argued that the public is entitled to as much information as possible with regard to the acts, omissions, achievements, and failures that accompanied fighting in which the public suffered injuries and losses on both the battlefront and on the home front. The petitioner further argued that the public’s right to know is only overridden when there is an almost certain likelihood that a disclosure of the information will cause severe, grave, and serious damage to the security of the state. According to the petitioner, from Judge Winograd’s reply on 30 November 2006 and from the statement to the media published on 3 December 2006, it can be seen that the Commission is of the opinion that the security of the state takes precedence over the public’s right to know. According to the petitioner in forming this opinion the Commission did not give proper consideration to the degree of probability that a security risk will occur and did not specifically examinethe extent of the harm involved in publishing the proceedings for each individual testimony. According to her argument, the fact that all the testimonies until now have been heard by the Commission in camera undermines the force of the principle of the publicity of hearings and the public’s right to know, and makes this violation a sweeping, arbitrary, and disproportionate one.\n\nAccording to the petitioner’s approach, the Commission is not entitled to decide that its proceedings will be held in camera whenever there is any concern relating to state security. Rather, in each session and with respect to each testimony the Commission should examine the extent of the harm to state security while also considering the likelihood that such harm will occur. The argument is that a proper implementation of these rules will lead to the conclusion that most of the Commission’s proceedings will be open to the public and that the transcripts of the Commission’s sessions and of the testimonies given before it will be published as close as possible to the date on which they were given. The petitioner further argued that in matters concerning the publicity of the Commission’s proceedings and the publication of the transcripts of its proceedings, the powers of the Commission that were determined in the government decision and the letter of appointment should be interpreted in the spirit of ss. 18 and 20 of the Commissions of Inquiry Law. It was also argued that the anticipated publication of the non-classified parts in the interim report and the final report of the Winograd Commission does not compensate for the disproportionate violation of the public’s right to know, since the report presents a processed version of the information and the conclusions draw from it. By contrast, publication of the testimonies that are heard by the Commission before it presents its report to the government will allow the public to form its own impression, with a maximum degree of transparency, of the way in which the commission came to its conclusions. Publication as aforesaid will also encourage public debate and reveal additional information that was not brought before the Commission and that may be relevant to the matters being examined by it.\n\nIn reply, counsel for the state, Advocate A. Helman, argued that the order nisi should be cancelled and that the petition should be denied. In his reply, he said that ‘the respondent accepts that in this case the criteria for the publicity of the respondent’s proceedings are similar, in principle, to those of a state commission of inquiry.’ In the hearing before us, counsel for the state agreed that the general norm that is applicable in this matter is derived from the principle of publicity of proceedings and the public’s right to know. But he argued that this norm is not absolute and should be balanced against competing interests. In this regard, counsel for the state indicated two main reasons why the proceedings of the Winograd Commission have until now been held in camera and the transcripts of its sessions have not been published. The main reason is the public interest of protecting the security of the state. According to this argument —\n\n‘… the commission became aware at the beginning of its work that all the testimonies that are being heard by it also include very classified and sensitive material — to a greater or lesser degree — which is a consequence of the subject being examined by the commission, the identities of the persons and officials who are summoned to testify before it and the matters that the commission is seeking to investigate and on which it wishes to confront the witnesses. In these circumstances, the commission is of the opinion that there is no practical possibility of determining ab initio that a certain testimony will not include classified material, whether in the course of the witness’s statement or in his reply to questions that the witness will be asked during his testimony’ (para. 12 of the state’s reply).\n\nCounsel for the state confirmed in his pleadings that the testimony of witnesses who appear before the commission ‘also includes matters that are not of a classified nature.’ He However, he claimed that there is an inherent difficulty in distinguishing in advance between the parts whose disclosure is permitted and the parts whose disclosure is prohibited, and therefore it is necessary to hear the testimonies in their entirety in camera. For this reason, the Commission has until now not held a session that was open to the public.\n\nWith regard to the balancing test between the public’s right to know and the security of the state, counsel for the state argued that where it concerns the question of the publicity of the Winograd Commission hearings, the strict test of ‘near certainty’ to which counsel for the petitioner referred in her pleadings does not apply. The proper test is one of publicity ‘that may endanger the security of the state’ as stated in the Commission’s letter of appointment. Notwithstanding, it was argued that even if the strict test as claimed by the petitioner does apply in the matter before us, there is an almost certain danger that publication of ‘the vast majority of the testimonies’ will result in serious harm to the security of the state. This is because of the nature of the matters being investigated by the Commission and the identity of the persons being interrogated by it, and because of the sensitivity inherent in the fact that the Commission is supposed to address in its recommendations the lessons that should be learned for the future. Counsel for the state emphasized in his arguments that the way in which Israel conducted the war and the lessons that should be learned for the future as a result of the manner in which the fighting was carried out, are matters that if disclosed to the public, will very seriously harm the ability of the State of Israel to fight the next war in the best possible manner, and will thus seriously endanger the security of the state.\n\nThe second reason for holding the proceedings of the Commission in camera concerns the public interest in having the work of the Winograd Commission carried out efficiently, quickly, and properly, so that the Commission can recommend to the government as soon as possible the lessons and improvements that should be implemented. This issue was raised by counsel for the state, as he put it, ‘beyond what is strictly necessary.’ According to him, the hearing of the testimonies in public will significantly prejudice the ability of the witnesses to testify freely, openly, and frankly before the Commission with regard to the conduct of their superior officers and comrades-at-arms. Moreover, hearing the testimonies in public will significantly harm the proper management of the investigation since the witnesses will be able to prepare themselves for the testimony in a manner that will make it difficult for the Commission to arrive at the truth. Counsel for the state further argued that opening the proceedings to the public would make it necessary to stop the investigation whenever the reply of a witness to a question, or the question itself, concerns a classified matter, and that this would disrupt and prolong the investigations. With regard to the publication of the transcripts of the Commission’s sessions at the end of each day of the proceedings, it was argued that if the Commission needs to consider which parts of the transcript may be published on a daily basis, it would slow down the Commission’s work and impair its efficiency. It was also argued that publication of the transcripts of the testimony before the Commission would require the relevant security personnel to review them, and that these people may be subordinate to some of persons being investigated by the Commission. For these reasons, it was argued that the proper time for making the security examination of the transcripts of the testimonies that the Commission is considering is only after the Commission presents its final report to the government.\n\nIn view of all the reasons set out above, counsel for the state argued that we should not intervene in the Commission’s position that, as a rule, its proceedings take place in camera, and that the transcripts of these sessions are not to be at this time According to counsel for the state, this position is reasonable in view of the manner in which two former state commissions of inquiry conducted themselves when they investigated events that occurred during a time of war. These were the Agranat Commission of Inquiry regarding the Yom Kippur War, where all of the proceedings were held in camera in accordance with a government decision, and the Kahn Commission of Inquiry regarding the Beirut Refugee Camps, where most of the sessions were also conducted in camera. According to the state’s approach, the harm to the public’s right to know in this case is proportional in view of the fact that the Commission will make parts of the interim report available to the public, and the fact that the final report will be presented to the government, and in view of the fact that after the final report is presented to the government the Commission will decide whether to publish those parts of the transcripts that do not involve any harm to the security of the state, its foreign relations, or other protected interests. Counsel for the state further stated that publication of parts of testimonies before the Commission’s report is published will not significantly further the public’s right to know since such testimonies alone are likely to present a partial and distorted picture. In view of all this, counsel for the state argued that the Commission’s position is reasonable and the court should not intervene in it.\n\nDeliberation\n\nThe principle of the publicity of proceedings and its application to the Winograd Commission\n\n5. Section 8A of the Government Law, by virtue of which the Winograd Commission was appointed, determines the powers of the government commission of investigation. This section does not address the question of the publicity of the proceedings before such a commission of investigation. Notwithstanding, the issue was expressly addressed in the letter of appointment that the Winograd Commission received from the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence in accordance with the government’s decision of 17 September 2006. As I said above, paragraph G of the letter of appointment provides that:\n\n‘The commission’s session shall be public or closed to the public as the commission shall decide. No public proceedings shall take place when this may endanger the security of the state or its foreign relations or when there is any other lawful reason that prohibits this.’\n\nIt follows from this that the Government left the question of the publicity of the Winograd Commission’s proceedings to the discretion of the Commission, although it saw fit to emphasize that no public proceedings should take place when doing so might endanger the security of the state or another protected interest.\n\nDefining the character of the Winograd Commission as a body is complex. It is a public authority that was set up by law by the executive branch and it exercises quasi-judicial powers; the Commission’s character as an administrative body and its quasi-judicial powers are characteristics that affect the norms that apply to it. There is no doubt that the discretion given to the Commission on the subject of the publicity of its proceedings is not absolute. None of the parties before us disputes that the Commission as a public authority is liable to exercise its discretion reasonably, after considering all of the relevant factors and giving proper weight to each of them in accordance with the basic principles of our legal system. As we shall clarify later, since the Commission is a body that has been given quasi-judicial powers, the commission should give considerable weight to the principle of the publicity of proceedings when it decides whether to hold the sessions at which it hears evidence in camera. As a public authority it should also give considerable weight to the general norm of the duty of disclosing information in its possession, when there is no legal reason to prevent its disclosure.\n\n6. This Court has on many occasions in the past discussed the elevated status and the great importance of the principle of the publicity of proceedings that take place before it. What has been said in case law with regard to the publicity of proceedings is also pertinent with regard to proceedings that are taking place before a body with quasi-judicial powers, such as the Winograd Commission. The premise is that the publicity of the proceedings contributes to improving the quality of the decision that is made at the end of the process. The assumption is that the critical eye of the public may ‘eliminate any possibility that the judicial process may be influenced by bias and prejudice’ (CrimA 152/51 Tripos v. Attorney-General [3], at p. 23). In addition, the publicity of proceedings in a judicial proceeding or a quasi-judicial proceeding contributes to a strengthening of public confidence in public authorities, in general, and in the body that is hearing the matter, in particular. By means of the publicity of the proceedings, justice is not only done but is also seen to be done, and this prevents the impression that the law is administered in secret and according to hidden criteria (see the remarks of Justice Arbel in HCJ 11793/05 Israel News Co. Ltd v. State of Israel [4], at paras. 13-15 of her opinion and all of the references cited there; see also LCrimA 5877/99 Yanos v. State of Israel [5], at pp. 109-112).\n\nThe principle of the publicity of proceedings is also based on the public’s right to know and the duty of disclosure that governs a public authority. The public’s right to receive information concerning the manner in which public authorities operate allows them to be subjected to public scrutiny.— a scrutiny that is one of the cornerstones of democracy. This reasoning has found expression in the Freedom of Information Law, 5758-1998 (hereafter: ‘the Freedom of Information Law’), which gives every citizen and resident a right to receive information from a public authority, subject to the exceptions and reservations listed in the law. To this, we should add that the realization of the public’s right to know by disclosing to the public the manner in which the public authority operates allows the public to determine its agenda and helps individuals in society decide their positions by means of an open discussion of the problems and by a free exchange of opinions on the basis of the information that is published (on the public’s right to know, see AAA 9135/03 Council for Higher Education v. HaAretz Newspaper Publishing [6], at paras. 8-9 of the opinion of Justice Hayut; AAA 6013/04 Ministry of Transport v. Israel News Co. Ltd [7], at para. 12 of the opinion of Justice Rivlin).\n\nIt has been said in the case law of this Court that the principle of the publicity of proceedings has two aspects: one is that the hearing is held in open court, so that every member of the public is entitled to be present; the other is the permission to publish the content of the proceedings as part of the public’s right to know. It has also been said that today the main importance of the principle of the publicity of proceedings lies in the second aspect which concerns the possibility of publishing the fact that the proceedings are being held and the content of the proceedings, and thereby bring these to the attention of the public as a whole (see Yanos v. State of Israel [5], at p. 112).\n\n7. The centrality of the principle of the publicity of proceedings in our legal system has received express recognition in legislation and has even been enshrined in a Basic Law. Section 3 of the Basic Law: Judiciary and s. 68(a) of the Courts Law [Consolidated Version], 5744-1984 (hereafter: the Courts Law) provide the rule that ‘The court shall hear cases publicly.’ This principle has also been determined with regard to commissions of inquiry. Thus s. 18(a) of the Commissions of Inquiry Law provides that ‘A commission of inquiry shall hold public hearings…’. It should immediately be said that this is not a strict rule, and that the provisions of the aforesaid laws contain exceptions to the principle of the publicity of proceedings, which we shall address later.\n\nAs we have said, the Government Law, by virtue of which the Winograd Commission was established, is silent with regard to the publicity of the proceedings before a government commission of investigation. Prima facie a question may arise as to whether the rule concerning the publicity of proceedings applies to the proceedings of every commission of investigation that is appointed under the Government Law, or whether we should not speak of a strict rule since the matter requires the consideration of each individual commission in accordance with its circumstances. We do not need to decide this question in the circumstances of the case before us because the Winograd Commission is not an ‘ordinary’ government commission of investigation. In Omets v. Prime Minister [1] this court discussed how, in view of the character and scope of the issues that the Winograd Commission was authorized to examine, the government saw fit in the letter of appointment to give the commission additional mandates and powers that are not listed in the Government Law. This was done in order to allow the commission to investigate in depth an issue of national significance and importance, namely the fighting that took place in Lebanon. The commission was given, inter alia given some of the main powers of a state commission of inquiry under ss. 9-11 of the Commissions of Inquiry Law — the powers to summon witnesses and to compel them to testify or to produce documents. The Commission is also governed by ss. 14 and 22 of the Commissions of Inquiry Law by virtue of the provisions of s. 8A(c) of the Government Law, with regard to the status of those testimonies. In Omets v. Prime Minister [1] the state also agreed that the Winograd Commission should be subject to a similar arrangement to the one provided in s. 15 of the Commission of Inquiry Law that gives anyone who may be harmed by the Commission’s conclusions the right to state their case. and in practice the representative of the state declared that the Commission was competent to issue ‘warning letters’ and to make recommendations with regard to specific persons like a state commission of inquiry. In practice, it is possible to interpret the position of the state in Omets v. Prime Minister [1] as that the Winograd Commission is similar in character to a state commission of inquiry, differing only in terms of the party that appointed it.\n\nSection 18 of the Commissions of Inquiry Law, which provides the rule that the proceedings of a state commission of inquiry should be held in public, does not apply directly to the Winograd Commission. But in its pleadings before us, the government agreed that the criteria concerning the publicity of the proceedings of the Winograd Commission are essentially similar to those of a state commission of inquiry, in view of the special character and the scope of powers of commission under discussion (see para. 31 of the respondent’s reply). Indeed, the Winograd Commission is considering issues of paramount public importance and interest. All of these factors affect the weight of the principle that the proceedings should be held in public and that the public has a right to know about the commission’s proceedings. Therefore, it is proper that the general principle concerning the publicity of the proceedings, which is also enshrined in s. 18 of the Commissions of Inquiry Law, should govern the Winograd Commission. It would appear that the Commission has indeed taken the aforesaid principle into account. In Judge Winograd’s letter to the petitioner of 30 November 2006, he says that ‘In any case where it is possible, the session will be public.’ The statement to the media on 3 December 2006 also says that ‘In so far as it will be possible without harming the security of the state, sessions and testimonies will be held in public.’ Therefore the premise for the continuation of our deliberations is that, in so far as possible and in the absence of any impediment for reasons of the security of the state, the proceedings of the Winograd Commission should be held in public.\n\nThe principle of the publicity of proceedings versus the security of the state\n\n8. The principle that proceedings should be held in public, like the basic rights that underlie it, is not absolute. There are cases where it needs to yield to conflicting rights and interests. Under s. 3 of the Basic Law: Judiciary, it is possible to violate the principle that judicial proceedings should be conducted in public only by virtue of an express provision of statute or by means of an order of the court that is made in accordance with statute. Section 68 of the Courts Law and ss. 18, 20 and 23 of the Commissions of Inquiry Law list the exceptions that allow all or some of the proceedings in a certain matter to be held in camera or subject to a prohibition against publication. Inter alia, it is provided that an order may be made to this effect if it is required ‘in order to protect the security of the state.’ It should be stated that even s. 9(a)(1) of the Freedom of Information Law provides that a public authority shall not provide information ‘whose disclosure gives rise to a concern that the security of the state will be harmed…’. As we have said, these provisions of statute do not apply directly to the Winograd Commission. But even the petitioner does not dispute that the exception with regard to protecting the security of the state applies to the Commission’s proceedings, and that in appropriate circumstances it is capable of justifying the holding of sessions in camera and of justifying the prohibition against publication of the content of the matters brought before the commission.\n\nThe two values under discu"
