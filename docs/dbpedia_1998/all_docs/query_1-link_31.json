        "text": "On this fourth day of the war, we have taken some time to review the headlines and the ledes/teasers of prominent opinion pieces and analyses from leading Israeli online news portals since the war began.\n\nWe want to provide our readers with insights into the ongoing war situation and the perspectives of influential voices within Israel, shedding light on the evolving dynamics in Israel and the region.\n\nYnet is one of the most visited Hebrew-language news portal. It began in 2000 as an online edition of the Yedioth Ahronoth daily newspaper. The news portal attracts approximately 10 million visitors monthly.\n\nIt appears that the conditions for an emergency government has been formed, more than 72 hours after the surprise attack. (View Hebrew article)\n\nby Moran Azoulay - journalist and television presenter, political and parliamentary correspondent\n\nA meeting between the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu[ and the leader of the National Unity party [former Defense Minister Benny Gantz], regarding the establishment of the emergency government is planned for today, following the coalition leaders' meeting.\n\nWill other parties join?\n\nGlobes is the only Hebrew-language economic news portal that provides up-to-date information and analyses on the Israeli and international financial markets. It was founded in 1983 as Israel's first economic daily newspaper and launched its online edition in 1995. The news portal attracts approximately 3 million visitors monthly.\n\nFears in the Markets: An Energy Crisis, Regional War, and the Tarpe of Normalization with Saudi Arabia (View Hebrew article)\n\nby Assaf Uni - correspondent from Israel and Germany for Israeli and international media outlets\n\nAnalysts agree that Hamas' attack is an Iranian attempt to disrupt the triangular deal between the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Israel. The troubling question in the global markets is whether the fighting will escalate to a regional conflict, how the U.S. will respond, and how the confrontation will change the Middle East.\n\nThe IDF's Procurement Budget Stands at Billions of Shekels. Where Is the Money Going? (View Hebrew article) by Idan Eretz - publicist, social activist, journalist, and economic blogger\n\nThe Ministry of Defense allocates 36 billion shekels [$9.1 billion] annually for equipment and procurement. While soldiers report shortages in equipment, Brigadier General Ram Amichai contends that the truly concerning issue is the scarcity of heavy assets like tanks: 'What you don't budget for in the past - simply won't be there.'\n\nIsrael Hayom is a right-wing, conservative news portal which is also distributed as a free daily newspaper. It was founded in 2007 and has been a supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his policies. The news portal attracts approximately 2.5 million visitors monthly.\n\nThe days of position are over (View Hebrew article)\n\nby Koby Arieli\n\nWe need to tell the government and the security leadership: unlike in the past, you are required to provide answers. You need to explain your responses to the public's 'need.' We no longer rely solely on your judgment with unwavering trust.\n\nWe won't hand it over on a silver platter (View Hebrew article)\n\nby Dr. Ron Breiman - scientist, academic, and columnist\n\nIt is forbidden for Israel to endanger its soldiers to topple Hamas and hand over control to their partners in the phased plan, Abu Mazen. Such use of the IDF is unacceptable and immoral unethical.\n\n\"Silently encouraging from the sidelines (View Hebrew article) by Eyal Zisser - professor of history at Tel Aviv University\n\nIsrael had gained the respect of the Arab world with its unwavering stance and impressive military and intelligence demonstration against Iran and its enemies. All of this crumbled on Saturday morning.\"\n\nMaariv is a Hebrew-language Israeli daily newspaper and news portal that was founded in 1948. It is the second-largest newspaper in Israel. The Maariv news portal attracts more than 2 million visitors monthly.\n\nAmid the Threats: The Address Was on the Wall - Written in Fire (View Hebrew article)\n\nby Ran Edelist - an Israeli journalist and author\n\nIn light of the weakness of the cabinet and especially the Prime Minister, they negotiate with strengthening players like Gantz and call it 'unity.' The military rank must take control and decide on a ground incursion only when all the forces are organized within them and between them and their supporting environment.\n\nHaaretz is a Hebrew and English-language liberal news portal. It was founded in 1918. The news portal attracts approximately 4.5 million visitors monthly.\n\nDo not dare to enter Gaza in the current situation (View Hebrew article)\n\nby Uri Mishgav - journalist, columnist, lecturer, teacher, and filmmaker\n\nEarly in the morning, I received a message from my teacher and mentor, Major General (Res.) David Ivri, one of the senior commanders of the Israeli Air Force and also the former Deputy Chief of Staff and founder of the Israeli Air Force. 'In my estimation, we are acting according to the Iranian plan,' Ivri wrote. 'The recent painful event will lead Israel to react by entering Gaza, and then when we are deeply entangled, Hezbollah and ISIS will start. Gaza is the trap we are entering, according to the Iranian plan. Gaza is not an existential threat, and it can be dealt with from the air and through economic pressure. If we enter Gaza, the trap could pose an existential threat.'"
