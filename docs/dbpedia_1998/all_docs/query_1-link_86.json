        "text": "Israel's longest-running TV news programme came to an emotional end on Tuesday, hours after its staff were told of their network's sudden closure.\n\nPresenters of Mabat LaHadashot (A Glance At The News) on Channel One complained of being denied a dignified farewell after 49 years on air.\n\nAn earlier show's presenter choked back tears after learning of the news.\n\nThe cancellations came as parliament approved the closure of the state-run Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA).\n\nIt will be replaced with a new, smaller entity known as Kan on Monday.\n\nThe IBA was established in 1948 and held a monopoly on TV and radio broadcasts in the country until the 1990s. Like the BBC, it was funded mainly by licence fees.\n\nIn 2014, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government announced that the IBA would be replaced with a new public broadcaster that would be less costly.\n\nOpponents expressed concern that Mr Netanyahu, who has accused IBA journalists of being overly critical of his right-wing coalition, wanted to control the media.\n\nThe setting up of Kan was delayed repeatedly and almost abandoned in March.\n\nMr Netanyahu reportedly wanted it scrapped because he was concerned that two officials appointed to senior positions in the new broadcaster were left-leaning. However, the leader of another party in his coalition, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, insisted on pressing ahead.\n\nThe dispute, which almost led to an early general election being called, was resolved after it was agreed that the two officials would not oversee news.\n\nAlthough they were aware that Kan was scheduled to launch next week, IBA employees had not expected TV and radio broadcasts to cease on Tuesday night."
