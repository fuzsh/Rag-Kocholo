THOMAS SANGSTER’s (Simon) television debut was in the BBC Film The Adventures of Station Jim, playing alongside Prunella Scales, George Cole and Frank Finley. The telefilm was a delightful story about a runaway orphan finding sanctuary on a steam railway. This was followed by a lead role in the Showtime Original film Bobbie's Girl, in which he was cast alongside Jonathan Silverman, Bernadette Peters and Rachel Ward.

Immediately after, he was whisked off to Vancouver to take the lead in The Miracle of the Cards, the telefilm version of the true story of Craig Shergold, who was diagnosed with cancer at age 10 and recovered with the help of an anonymous benefactor and enough get-well cards to enter him into the Guinness Book of World Records.

Thomas then appeared in the BBC’s Emmy and BAFTA award-winning adaptation of Clive King’s wonderful story, Stig of the Dump. It tells the tale of Barney and his friendship with a caveman named Stig. Thomas received glowing reviews as Barney, all wide-eyed wonder and innocent adventurer.

He next appeared in the action telefeature Daddy, which gave him the opportunity to work alongside Klaus Maria Brandauer. This was Sangster’s first thriller and he loved all the action scenes, explosions, shoot-outs and car chases. His performance won him the Best Actor in a Miniseries award at the 2003 Monte Carlo Film Festival.

Love, Actually was Sangster’s first international feature film, in which he played Liam Neeson’s son, and for which he received a Satellite Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a musical or comedy. His training for Love, Actually involved learning how to play the drums, perform cartwheels and (most challenging of all) have his first screen kiss.

Thomas has since filmed a new BBC TV series called Feather Boy.

Angela Lansbury (Aunt Adelaide) has enjoyed a career without precedent. Her professional career spans more than half a century, during which she has flourished, first as a star of motion pictures, then as a four-time Tony Award-winning Broadway musical star and most recently as the star of Murder, She Wrote, the longest running detective drama series in the history of television.

Angela Brigid Lansbury was born in London on October 16, 1925. Her father, Edgar Isaac Lansbury, was a timber merchant. Her mother, Moyna Macgill, was a popular actress. At age 10, Lansbury saw John Gielgud as Hamlet at the Old Vic and vowed that someday she would become an actress. She attended the Webber-Douglas School of Dramatic Art in London.

In 1940, in order to escape the London Blitz, Moyna Macgill evacuated 14-year-old Lansbury and her younger twin brothers, Edgar and Bruce, to the United States. The family lived in Putnum County for a year, during which time Lansbury commuted to the Feagin School of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan. She received her first professional job at age 16 when she performed a cabaret act in Montreal.

Eventually the family relocated in Los Angeles where 17-year-old Lansbury landed a seven-year contract at MGM after director George Cukor cast her as Nancy, the menacing maid, in Gaslight. Her cunning performance won her a 1944 Academy Award® nomination for Best Supporting Actress. The following year she received a second nomination, again for Best Supporting Actress, for her portrayal of the doomed Sybil Vane in The Picture of Dorian Gray. That poignant role earned her a Golden Globe Award.

Lansbury has appeared in 44 motion pictures to date. They include such classics as National Velvet, The Harvey Girls, Frank Capra’s State of the Union, Cecil B. DeMille’s Samson and Delilah, The Court Jester, The Long Hot Summer, The Manchurian Candidate (for which she received a second Golden Globe Award, the National Board of Review Award and her third Academy Award® nomination), The World of Henry Orient and Death on the Nile (a second National Board of Review Award). In 1991, she was the voice of Mrs. Potts in the Disney animated feature Beauty and the Beast, and in 1997, she was the voice of the Grand Duchess Marie in the animated movie Anastasia.

The actress made her Broadway debut in 1957 when she starred as Bert Lahr’s wife in the French farce, Hotel Paradiso. In 1960 she returned to Broadway as Joan Plowright’s mother in the season's most acclaimed drama, A Taste of Honey by Shelagh Delaney.

In 1964, she starred on Broadway in her first musical. Anyone Can Whistle closed after only nine performances, but Lansbury returned to New York in triumph in 1966 as Mame. She played the role for two years on Broadway and later to sold-out audiences in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Mame earned Lansbury the first of her unprecedented four Tony Awards for Best Actress in a Musical. She received the others as the Madwoman of Chaillot in Dear World (1968), as Mama Rose in the 1974 revival of Gypsy and as Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd (1979). In 1978, she starred as Mrs. Anna for a limited engagement of The King and I.

Concurrent with her musical ventures, Lansbury continued to act in serious dramas. In 1971, she returned to London to appear in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Edward Albee’s All Over. In 1975, again in London, she played Gertrude to Albert Finney's Hamlet in the National Theatre production. In 1976, she acted in two Albee one-act plays, Counting the Ways and Listening, at the Hartford Stage Company.

She was to find her largest audience on television. Although Lansbury had acted in live dramas during the golden age of television in the 1950s in such shows as Robert Montgomery Presents and Lux Video Theatre, when she starred as Mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney in the 1982 miniseries Little Gloria...Happy at Last, she had not acted on television in 17 years. She followed that Emmy-nominated performance with roles in the miniseries Lace and A Christmas Story: The Gift of Love.

From 1984-1996 she starred as Jessica Fletcher, mystery-writing amateur sleuth, on Murder, She Wrote. In 1992, Lansbury added to her responsibilities by becoming the series’ executive producer.

During the past decade she has also found time to star in the made for television motion pictures, Mrs 'Arris Goes to Paris, Shootdown, The Love She Sought and the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation The Shell Seekers. She developed a video and co-wrote a book, both titled Positive Moves, about fitness and well-being.

After Murder, She Wrote concluded its 12-season run in May 1996, Lansbury returned to her theatrical roots by starring in Mrs. Santa Claus, the first original musical for television in four decades.

In 1997, Lansbury appeared in South by Southwest, the first of a series of two-hour Murder, She Wrote movies for CBS. In 1998, she completed The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax, which also aired on CBS. In spring of 2000, Lansbury completed the second of the Murder, She Wrote movies, A Story to Die For. In 2002, the third Murder, She Wrote movie, The Celtic Riddle, was aired.

She has been unstinting of her time with scores of civic involvements, ranging from the American Red Cross to the Salvation Army and Habitat for Humanity. As a member of the amfAR National Council, her energies in the war against AIDS have raised several millions of dollars.

In 1982, she was inducted into the Theatre Hall of Fame. In 1990, she received an honorary doctorate in humanities from Boston University. In 1992, she received the Silver Mask for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. In 1994, she was named a Commander of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. In 1996, she was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame, and she also starred in CBS’s Mrs. Santa Claus. In 1997, she was given a Lifetime Achievement award from the Screen Actors Guild. She has been nominated for 16 Emmy Awards (12 for Murder, She Wrote). She has won six Golden Globe Awards (four for Murder, She Wrote) and has been nominated for an additional eight. In September 1997, President Clinton presented her with the National Medal of the Arts. In November 1999, Meadows School of the Arts at Texas’s Southern Methodist University presented Lansbury with their Lifetime Achievement Award. In December of 2000, Lansbury was the recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor in Washington, D.C.
