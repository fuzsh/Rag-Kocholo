For the unrelated 2006 film, see In the Name of the Father (2006 film).\n\nIn the Name of the FatherDirected byJim SheridanScreenplay by\n\nTerry George\n\nJim Sheridan\n\nBased onProved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four\n\n1991 book\n\nby Gerry ConlonProduced byJim SheridanStarringCinematographyPeter BiziouEdited byGerry HamblingMusic byTrevor Jones\n\nProduction\n\ncompany\n\nHell's Kitchen Films\n\nDistributed byUniversal Pictures (through United International Pictures)\n\nRelease dates\n\nRunning time\n\n133 minutesCountries\n\nIreland\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nLanguageEnglishBudget$13 millionBox office$65.8 million[1]\n\nIn the Name of the Father is a 1993 biographical crime drama film co-written and directed by Jim Sheridan. It is based on the true story of the Guildford Four, four people falsely convicted of the 1974 Guildford pub bombings that killed four off-duty British soldiers and a civilian.[2] The screenplay was adapted by Terry George and Jim Sheridan from the 1990 autobiography Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four by Gerry Conlon.[3]\n\nThe film grossed $65 million at the box office and received overwhelmingly positive reviews. It was nominated for seven Oscars at the 66th Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Daniel Day-Lewis), Best Supporting Actor (Pete Postlethwaite), Best Supporting Actress (Emma Thompson), Best Director, and Best Picture.\n\nIn Belfast, Gerry Conlon is mistaken as an IRA sniper by British security forces and pursued until a riot breaks out. Gerry is sent to London by his father Giuseppe to dissuade an IRA reprisal against him.\n\nOne evening, Gerry burgles a prostitute's flat and steals £700. While he is taking drugs in a park with his friend Paul Hill, alongside homeless Irishman Charlie Burke, an explosion in Guildford occurs, killing four off-duty soldiers plus a civilian as well as injuring many others. Returning to Belfast sometime later, Gerry is captured by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary and arrested on terrorism charges.\n\nGerry is flown to England, where he and his friend Paul together with two others are dubbed the Guildford Four and are subjected to police torture as part of their interrogation.\n\nGerry maintains his innocence, but signs a confession after the police threaten to kill his father, who is later arrested along with other members of the Conlon family, later dubbed the Maguire Seven. At his trial, although Gerry's defence points out numerous inconsistencies in the police investigation, he, along with the rest of the Guildford Four, is sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nDuring their time in prison Gerry and Giuseppe are approached by new inmate Joe McAndrew, who informs them that he was the real perpetrator of the bombing and had confessed this to the police. The police, in order to save face, withheld this new information.\n\nThough Gerry warms to Joe, his opinion changes when Joe sets a hated prison guard on fire during a riot. Giuseppe later dies in custody, leaving Gerry to take over his father's campaign for justice.\n\nGiuseppe's lawyer Gareth Peirce, who had been investigating the case on Giuseppe's behalf, discovers vital evidence related to Gerry's original alibi with a note attached that reads: \"Not to be shown to the defence.\" Through a statement made by Charlie Burke, at a court appeal, it totally exonerates Gerry and the rest.\n\nThe film ends with the current activities of the wrongly accused being given, and also by stating that the police who investigated the case were never prosecuted for any wrongdoing. The real perpetrators of the Guildford Bombing have not been charged with the crime.\n\nModel, now actress, Saffron Burrows made her feature film debut in the film, as Gerry Conlon's free love-interest at a commune/squat in London at the time of the bombings.\n\nTo prepare for the role of Gerry Conlon, Day-Lewis lost over 23 kilograms (50 lb) in weight. To gain an insight into Conlon's thoughts and feelings at the time, Day-Lewis also spent three days and nights in a jail cell. He was prevented from sleeping by a group of thugs, who would bang on the door every ten minutes with tin cups through the night, then he was interrogated by three different teams of real Special Branch officers for nine hours. He would also insist that crew members throw cold water at him and verbally abuse him. He also kept his Belfast accent on and off set.\n\nDay-Lewis has stated in an interview that he went through all this because otherwise \"How could I understand how an innocent man could sign that confession and destroy his own life.\"[4][5]\n\nThe film received very positive reviews from most critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 94% based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The site's consensus states: \"Impassioned and meticulously observed, In the Name of the Father mines rousing drama from a factual miscarriage of justice, aided by scorching performances and director Jim Sheridan's humanist focus.\"[6] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 84 out of 100 based on 16 reviews indicating \"universal acclaim\".[7] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[8]\n\nThe film was the second highest-grossing ever in Ireland (behind Jurassic Park), and the highest-grossing Irish film, beating the record set by The Commitments in 1991, with a gross of IR£2.91 million ($4.5 million).[9][10]\n\n2nd – James Berardinelli, ReelViews[11]\n\nTop 10 (not ranked) – Dennis King, Tulsa World[12]\n\nHonorable mention – Dan Craft, The Pantagraph[13]\n\nAward Category Subject Result Australian Film Institute Awards Best Foreign Film Jim Sheridan Nominated Academy Awards Best Picture Nominated Best Director Nominated Best Adapted Screenplay Nominated Terry George Nominated Best Actor Daniel Day-Lewis Nominated Best Supporting Actor Pete Postlethwaite Nominated Best Supporting Actress Emma Thompson Nominated Best Film Editing Gerry Hambling Nominated ACE Eddie Best Edited Feature Film – Dramatic Nominated British Academy Film Awards Best Adapted Screenplay Jim Sheridan Nominated Terry George Nominated Best Actor Daniel Day-Lewis Nominated Berlin International Film Festival Golden Bear[14] Jim Sheridan Won BSFC Award Best Actor Daniel Day-Lewis Won DFWFCA Award Best Film Nominated David di Donatello Awards Best Foreign Actor Daniel Day-Lewis Nominated Best Foreign Film Jim Sheridan Won European Film Award European Film of the Year Nominated Evening Standard British Film Award Best Film Jim Sheridan Won Golden Globe Awards Best Motion Picture – Drama Nominated Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama Daniel Day-Lewis Nominated Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture Emma Thompson Nominated Best Original Song\n\n(\"You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart\") Bono Nominated Gavin Friday Nominated Maurice Seezer Nominated Humanitas Prize Feature Film Category Terry George Nominated Jim Sheridan Nominated Nastro d'Argento European Silver Ribbon Nominated Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards Best Supporting Actress Emma Thompson Won LAFCA Award Best Actor Daniel Day-Lewis 2nd place NBR Award Top Ten Films Won NSFC Award Best Actor Daniel Day-Lewis 2nd place NYFCC Award Best Actor 3rd place PGA Award Best Theatrical Motion Picture Jim Sheridan Nominated PFS Award Exposé Won Human Rights Nominated Peace Nominated WGA Award Best Adapted Screenplay Jim Sheridan Nominated Terry George Nominated\n\nUpon its release, the film proved controversial for some historical inaccuracies and for fictionalising parts of the story. Jim Sheridan was forced to defend his choices. In 2003, he stated: \"I was accused of lying in In the Name of the Father, but the real lie was saying it was a film about the Guildford Four when really it was about a non-violent parent.\"[15] In the film Gerry and his father Giuseppe (in the closing credits, the name is misspelled \"Guiseppe\") share a cell, but this never took place; they were usually kept in separate prisons. The real perpetrators of the Guildford pub bombings were the IRA's Balcombe Street Gang, who admitted to the Guildford and Woolwich bombings during their trials, rather than the fictional character of Joe McAndrew. The courtroom scenes featuring Gareth Peirce were also heavily criticised as clearly straying from recorded events and established English legal practices since, as a solicitor and not a barrister, she would not have been able to appear in court at the time. Furthermore, Peirce did not represent Giuseppe Conlon. Investigative journalist David Pallister wrote: \"The myriad absurdities in the court scenes, straight out of LA Law, are inexcusable.\"[16]\n\nIn a 1994 radio interview, Anne Maguire, a member of The Maguire Seven who, along with her husband, brother and two young sons, went to prison because of the false confessions of her nephew Gerry Conlon and Paul Hill, revealed her lingering anger and bitterness at the pair for wrongly incriminating them, as well as her dismay at the film for, in her view, depicting Conlon as a hero. (She and her family were all officially exonerated by the British government in 1991.) She also criticised director Jim Sheridan for, as she claims, never reaching out to her or her family for their side of the story, and sharply castigated the film for alleged inaccuracies, including a scene showing Conlon and Hill visiting her prior to their arrests, as she adamantly maintains that Hill never once set foot in her home -- a key point in her defense at trial.[17]\n\nThe soundtrack of the film includes the song \"You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart\", performed by Sinéad O'Connor and written by Bono, Gavin Friday, and Maurice Seezer. The soundtrack also includes \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" performed by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. However, the Bob Dylan Song \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was not included on the album due to licensing restrictions.\n\nThe soundtrack featured these songs:\n\nBono and Gavin Friday - \"In the Name of the Father\" (5:42)\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience - \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" (5:09)\n\nBono and Gavin Friday - \"Billy Boola\" (3:45)\n\nThe Kinks - \"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\" (3:00)\n\nTrevor Jones - \"Interrogation\" (7:11)\n\nBob Marley and the Wailers - \"Is This Love\" (3:51)\n\nTrevor Jones - \"Walking the Circle\" (4:42)\n\nThin Lizzy - \"Whiskey in the Jar\" (5:44)\n\nTrevor Jones - \"Passage of Time\" (5:52)\n\nSinéad O'Connor - \"You Made Me the Thief of Your Heart\" (6:21)\n\nSouth Lotts, Dublin, Ireland (used for opening Belfast scenes)\n\nSheriff Street, Dublin, Ireland (Sheriff Street flats complex (now demolished) used for riot scene)\n\nKilmainham Gaol, Dublin, Ireland (as Park Royal Prison)\n\nLiverpool, England (used for many London scenes)\n\nBirmingham Six\n\nList of films featuring hallucinogens"
