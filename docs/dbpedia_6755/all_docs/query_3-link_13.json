        "text": "My daughter Sophia and I have somewhat of an addiction to bad Hallmark movies. Luckily for us, there’s not one but two whole channels devoted to playing them year round. There are Halloween and fall-themes, generic romantic ones, and of course, Christmas love stories. Now, having said that, I will admit, probably about 97% of our viewing is so we can poke fun at it. I mean, they’re fun to set a mood, but the tropes are always the same. Straight woman can’t find love with straight man of same race, because she’s either a “career woman” that never had time for love, or has to to back to her home town to help take over a family business that’s failing, or about to be bought out by a big, mean, business man (who also happens to be single and her same race). Every now and then the main characters will already be in a relationship, but it’s all wrong, and the right person is just waiting for them back home…\n\nSo while I’m sure there are folks that take these movies very seriously, we are not those people. However that does not mean we aren’t hopeless romantics! One of my favorite movies is Love Actually, and I was thrilled when Sophia finally watched it a few years back and also fell in love. We also share a love for Moulin Rouge, so we aren’t scrooges I promise. Having been exposed to both really good and really bad romantic movies, we had high hopes for Last Christmas given the cast and story behind its creation. We were not disappointed.\n\nThe premise behind Last Christmas is taking George Michael’s famous Wham! song of the same name, and creating an entire movie around it. Sounds like a short movie, right? But really, that was just the impetus. The idea for this movie came about 10 years ago, and George Michael was approached and actually liked the idea, insisting on Emma Thompson’s involvement. They met several times and went over story ideas before his untimely death on Christmas day in 2016. It took a long time to get the story right, with Emma Thompson and Greg Wise writing treatments together. The development grew and evolved from there to what is sure to become an instant classic. Last Christmas has all the side character development and charm of Love Actually, where you actually care about the people on the screen and are glad you get to know a little more about them. It has all the important messaging of It’s a Wonderful Life (the inspiration for the director’s desire to make a classic Christmas movie) without being heavy handed or feeling like the audience is manipulated.\n\nKate used to feel special, but got sick and now that she’s better, her life is a shambles. She works in a Christmas shop and auditions as a singer/actress on the side. Suddenly Tom appears and things start to “look up.” He helps her realize that life is about more than just trying to make yourself happy, it’s about helping others be happy too. I won’t reveal more than that, but the story does have a twist, which Sophia and I both guessed, but it didn’t make it any less powerful.\n\nThe rest of the film is full of beautiful London scenes and quirky characters, along with some real world issues to confront as well. George Michael’s compelling music is woven throughout, acting like another character in the story, a literal chorus with a message to share. It’s truly a multi-level gift, the movie itself, the wonderful acting and story, and the music; reborn for a new audience to enjoy and appreciate. (And older audiences, as I instantly wanted to download the soundtrack on my way home, but settled for my George Michael playlist).\n\nLast Christmas also normalized a lot of hot button issues (that frankly shouldn’t be hot button issues in 2019), like mixed race couples, same-sex couples, immigration, homelessness, and our preconceptions. It was great to see a movie come out and not attempt to capitalize or divide based on those issues, but rather just be a mirror to real life and the many people that live in it.\n\nI cannot wait to see this movie again, and to be able to watch it every year as I do with Love Actually. Until then, I will remain inspired by the many messages of love, self-reflection, selflessness, helping others, and I’ll remember to Look Up.\n\nLast Christmas opens everywhere Friday, November 8th – Go see it!\n\nYou can get the soundtrack on Friday too:\n\n*As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases\n\nDisclaimer: I was invited to a screening of Last Christmas at no cost, but as always, my thoughts and opinions are my own.\n\nSaving Mr. Banks has warmed the hearts of most who have seen it in theatres, and now it’s available on Blu Ray and DVD. I had not previously written about Saving Mr. Banks, mostly because I had very mixed feelings about it. Taking away the idea that this was “based on facts” or historically true, it was a beautiful movie. The problems come in when you think Tom Hanks on screen is Walt Disney…and that’s simply not the case.\n\nThere are certainly parts of the movie based on ideas or issues encountered during the acquisition and screenwriting process, but many of the things portrayed tend to twist the truth for the story that Saving Mr. Banks wants to tell. If you go into the film thinking it’s just an interesting story, funny in parts, then it is enjoyable.\n\nThe music, the Richard Sherman parts, and even most of the flashback scenes, were lovely. Emma Thompson’s acting was very fun to watch, even if what little I know about the real P.L. Travers made it seem completely unbelievable. Paul Giamatti as the limo driver was another fun subplot, completely made up for the film, but well done nonetheless. Thinking about Walt Disney saying “Get on the damn horse, Pam!” makes a Walt Disney fan’s skin crawl…and that’s one of several moments where I just have to think it’s a fictional film about people that sometimes resemble Walt Disney and those who made Mary Poppins come to life on film. And again, it was enjoyable for me, but I don’t look at it as factual or the way things happened. That said, I’m happy to own it on dvd and be able to watch it again because the music alone and funny parts are great. Here are the bonus features you’ll find on the Blu-ray:\n\n· The Walt Disney Studios: From Poppins to Present (Blu-ray & Digital HD) – Join Director John Lee Hancock on a tour of the Disney Studios lot, reflect on studio life during the making ofMary Poppins, and discover how Walt’s creative spirit still flourishes today.\n\n· Let’s Go Fly a Kite (Blu-ray & Digital HD) – Cast and crew sing break out in a rousing, heartfelt tribute to Composer Richard Sherman on the last day of filming.\n\n· Deleted Scenes\n\nStargaze (Blu-ray & Digital HD) – A picture on Walt’s desk leads to a flashback of Pamela’s childhood.\n\nNanny Song (Blu-ray, DVD & Digital HD) – The Sherman Brothers perform a song for Pamela that she is less than thrilled with.\n\nPam Leaves (Blu-ray & Digital HD) – After yet another disagreement with Walt, Pamela leaves his office and heads for the airport.\n\n*Digital HD bonus offerings vary by digital retailer\n\nDisclaimer: I was sent a complimentary copy of Saving Mr. Banks for the purposes of review. My opinions are my own. Retail link is an affiliate link, which takes you to Amazon.com but any purchases send a small amount back to Zannaland. Thanks for reading!\n\nI cannot properly put into words how excited I am for Saving Mr. Banks. I have been saying, wishing, hoping for years that a movie about the behind-the-scenes-history of the Walt Disney Company. I have been fascinated since I was a small child with the man himself, Walt Disney, and since learning more and more as I grew up (well, physically anyway, mentally I’m probably still about 11 when it comes to Disney), I yearned for more and more knowledge about how things were done back then. It is rare that an empire is built who’s beginnings intrigue us so. I’m sure the first years of Coca-cola and Pepsi, and certainly Apple are interesting as well, but Walt Disney’s singular determination and devotion to making people happy and his never-ending drive to create new and never-been-experienced things is just a part of what makes him so well-loved.\n\nSince no one is tackling his complete life story in movie-form, Saving Mr. Banks is the next best thing and when I first heard of its production, I believe tiny hearts formed in my eyes. I will admit I was a bit skeptical about Tom Hanks being able to step outside himself and become Walt Disney, and after seeing the trailer below, I kind of feel the same way, but I am still okay with it as I love Tom Hanks as he is. So if anyone was to portray the beloved Uncle Walt, I feel it is him. And after seeing Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak as the Sherman brothers, I am head over heels in love. Emma Thompson of course does an amazing job of the not-so-jolly P.L. Travers and I think is another perfect fit. Let’s watch the trailer below and let me know in the comments what you think!\n\nTrailer: Saving Mr. Banks on Disney Video\n\nThoughts? Here are some more official photos released from the movie studio as well. It was fun to hear that many of the extras cast in the film are actual Disneyland cast members. A lovely touch. More than just excitement for the actors and the film itself, the story of Saving Mr. Banks seems to be a wonderfully heartwarming look at the inner workings of P.L. Travers resistance and final agreement to give over the rights for Mary Poppins. It’s such a wonderful look behind the scenes at a film beloved by all. It’s hard to imagine it almost never was, and knowing that only because of Walt Disney’s persistence and creativity in persuasion do we have such a classic, is a wonderful monument to the man he was. Saving Mr. Banks is set to release on December 20, 2013. See you at the movies!\n\nWhen I first heard rumors of a film being made based on the arduous twenty-year attempt of Walt Disney to obtain the film rights and subsequently produce the Mary Poppins story, I didn’t want to get my hopes up. It is a well-known bit of history that author P.L. Travers was not too keen on signing over her rights, and quite picky about filming and production. Now that this rumor is a reality, I am beyond excited and thrilled!\n\nWhile I have always had an extreme interest in all things Disney, it’s really only been since I was an adult, and really the past few years, that I developed a love of anything Disney history-related. After attending several Disney D23 fan events and hearing original Imagineers and animators speak, I have longed for a behind-the-scenes story of the Walt Disney Company’s early history and the personalities that made it what it was.\n\nI will still hope for that Walt Disney bio pic, but understand with the restraints on the company today, we may never get an accurate film with all the juicy details Disney nerds live for. The next best thing would be a film covering a certain aspect of company history, and Saving Mr. Banks seems to fit that bill. Tom Hanks will be a perfect Walt Disney and I cannot wait to see how he does Uncle Walt justice. The film is shooting in Los Angeles and at the actual locations of much of the original history, which also makes me ridiculously excited.\n\nHere is the official press release detailing the production and those behind it:\n\nTwo-time Academy Award®-winner Tom Hanks (“Philadelphia,” “Forrest Gump”) will essay the role of the legendary Disney (the first time the entrepreneur has ever been depicted in a dramatic film) alongside fellow double Oscar®-winner Emma Thompson (“Howard’s End,” “Sense and Sensibility”) in the role of the prickly novelist. Before actually signing away the book’s rights, Travers’ demands for contractual script and character control circumvent not only Disney’s vision for the film adaptation, but also those of the creative team of screenwriter Don DaGradi and sibling composers Richard and Robert Sherman, whose original score and song (Chim-Chim-Cher-ee) would go on to win Oscars® at the 1965 ceremonies (the film won five awards of its thirteen nominations).\n\nWhen Travers travels from London to Hollywood in 1961 to finally discuss Disney’s desire to bring her beloved character to the motion picture screen (a quest he began in the 1940s as a promise to his two daughters), Disney meets a prim, uncompromising sexagenarian not only suspect of the impresario’s concept for the film, but a woman struggling with her own past. During her stay in California, Travers’ reflects back on her childhood in 1906 Australia, a trying time for her family which not only molded her aspirations to write, but one that also inspired the characters in her 1934 book.\n\nNone more so than the one person whom she loved and admired more than any other—her caring father, Travers Goff, a tormented banker who, before his untimely death that same year, instills the youngster with both affection and enlightenment (and would be the muse for the story’s patriarch, Mr. Banks, the sole character that the famous nanny comes to aide). While reluctant to grant Disney the film rights, Travers comes to realize that the acclaimed Hollywood storyteller has his own motives for wanting to make the film—which, like the author, hints at the relationship he shared with his own father in the early 20th Century Midwest.\n\nColin Farrell (“Minority Report,” “Total Recall”) co-stars as Travers’ doting dad, Goff, along with British actress Ruth Wilson (the forthcoming films “The Lone Ranger” and “Anna Karenina”) as his long-suffering wife, Margaret; Oscar® and Emmy® nominee Rachel Griffiths (“Six Feet Under,” “Hilary and Jackie,” “The Rookie”) as Margaret’s sister, Aunt Ellie (who inspired the title character of Travers’ novel); and a screen newcomer—11-year-old Aussie native Annie Buckley as the young, blossoming writer, nicknamed “Ginty” in the flashback sequences.\n\nThe cast also includes Emmy® winner Bradley Whitford (“The West Wing,” “The Cabin in the Woods”) as screenwriter Don DaGradi; Jason Schwartzman (“Rushmore,” “Moonrise Kingdom”) and B.J. Novak (“NBC’s “The Office,” “Inglourious Basterds”) as the songwriting Sherman Brothers (Richard and Robert, respectively); Oscar® nominee and Emmy winner Paul Giamatti (“Sideways,” “Cinderella Man,” HBO’s “John Adams”) as Ralph, the kindly limousine driver who escorts Travers during her two-week stay in Hollywood; and multi-Emmy winner Kathy Baker (“Picket Fences,” “Edward Scissorhands”) as Tommie, one of Disney’s trusted studio associates.\n\n“Saving Mr. Banks” will be directed by John Lee Hancock (“The Blind Side,” “The Rookie”) based on a screenplay by Kelly Marcel (creator of FOX-TV’s “Terra Nova”), from a story by Sue Smith (“Brides of Christ,” “Bastard Boys”) and Kelly Marcel. The film is being produced by Alison Owen of Ruby Films (the Oscar®-nominated “Elizabeth,” HBO’s Emmy®-winning “Temple Grandin”), Ian Collie of Essential Media (the Aussie TV documentary “The Shadow of Mary Poppins,” DirecTV’s “Rake”) and longtime Hancock collaborator Philip Steuer (“The Rookie,” “The Chronicles of Narnia” trilogy). The film’s executive producers are Ruby Films’ Paul Trijbits (“Lay the Favorite,” “Jane Eyre”), Hopscotch Features’ Andrew Mason (“The Matrix” trilogy, “Dark City”) and Troy Lum (“Mao’s Last Dancer,” “I, Frankenstein”) and BBC Films’ Christine Langan (Oscar® nominee for “The Queen,” “We Need to Talk About Kevin”).\n\nHancock’s filmmaking team includes a trio of artists with whom he worked on his 2009 Best Picture Oscar® nominee, “The Blind Side”—two-time Oscar® nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (“How The Grinch Stole Christmas,” “Apollo 13”), Emmy®-winning costume designer Daniel Orlandi (HBO’s “Game Change,” “Frost/Nixon”) and film editor Mark Livolsi, A.C.E. (“Wedding Crashers” “The Devil Wears Prada”). Hancock also reunites with Academy Award®-nominated cinematographer John Schwartzman (“Seabiscuit,” “Pearl Harbor”), with whom he first worked on his inspiring 2002 sports drama, “The Rookie.”\n\n“Saving Mr. Banks” will film entirely in the Los Angeles area, with key locations to include Disneyland in Anaheim and the Disney Studios in Burbank. Filming will conclude around Thanksgiving, 2012, with no specific 2013 release date yet set.\n\nWhat do you think of Saving Mr. Banks? Will you be first in line with a spoonful of sugar when it’s released?"
