        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nStarring Emma Thomson and Hugh Jackman, Three Bags Full has been penned by Craig Mazin, the creator of last year’s huge success, The Last Of Us.\n\nHere’s a project that comes from the mind behind The Last Of Us and Chernobyl, two of the most celebrated TV shows of the last few years. Screenwriter and creator Craig Mazin has built himself a reputation for delivering quality on the small screen, and he’s also penned a ‘weird’ Pirates Of The Caribbean script that producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems very taken with. But it seems that for his latest project, Mazin is headed to pastures new. Pastures filled with sheep.\n\nThanks to The Hollywood Reporter, it has been revealed that Mazin has penned the script for Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Movie. Amazon MGM is baaaaa-cking the project (sorry) and no less than Emma Thompson and Hugh Jackman have signed up to star. Minions director Kyle Balda will direct.\n\nNicholas Braun, Nicholas Galitzine (who’s also about to play He-Man), Molly Gordon, and Hong Chau, Tosin Cole, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, Conleth Hill and Mandeep Dhillon are also set for the feature.\n\nAll you really want, though, is the synopsis. So here’s the synopsis:\n\nThree Bags Full is a live-action comedy about a shepherd (Jackman) who dies under mysterious circumstances, leaving his flock of sheep to solve the case. The synopsis for the film adds: “The local cop Tim Derry (Braun), on the other hand, has never solved a serious crime in his life, so the sheep conclude they will have to solve it themselves, even if it means leaving their meadow for the first time and facing the fact that the human world isn’t as simple as it appears in books.”\n\nAnybody familiar with TV’s Succession will have no doubt fallen victim to the comedic charms of Nicholas Braun (he played the terminally awkward Greg Hirsch) so it’s great to see him get a chance to share some screen time with Thompson and Jackman, an opportunity that could elevate his standing further. The only disappointment is that we don’t know who Thompson is playing. Time will tell.\n\nPrincipal photography has already started, with Amazon said to be planning an exclusive worldwide theatrical release, dating the film for the 20th February, 2026. We will definitely bring you more on this one as we hear it."
