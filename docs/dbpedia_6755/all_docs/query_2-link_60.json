        "text": "Actress Born April 15, 1959 in Paddington, England, United Kingdom\n\nEmma Thompson was born into a theatrical family â both of her parents were actors, and her younger sister, Sophie, also became an actress.\n\nThompsonâs career got its start during her college years as a literature major at the University of Cambridge. There she joined the university theatrical club, the Footlights, alongside fellow students Tony Slattery, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, with whom she had a brief romance.\n\nShe signed with an agent before she graduated in 1980 and was soon appearing on stage on Londonâs West End. By 1983, she was showing up regularly on various BBC and ITV television productions, including the sketch comedy show âAlfrescoâ and a notable guest shot on the hit series âThe Young Onesâ alongside Laurie and Fry.\n\nIn 1987 she costarred with Kenneth Branagh in the hit BBC series âFortunes of War.â The two began dating and were married in 1989. Around this same time, Thompsonâs career moved from television to film, where she starred in the comedy âThe Tall Guyâ with Jeff Goldblum and alongside Branagh in his film version of âHenry V.â They costarred again in the American sleeper hit âDead Againâ in 1991.\n\nThe next year, Thompson won her first Oscar for her performance in the drama âHowards End.â She also received Oscar nominations for âThe Remains of the Dayâ and âIn the Name of the Father.â In 1996, she was nominated for best actress and won an Oscar for best adapted screenplay for her adaptation of âSense and Sensibility,â making her the only person in Academy Award history to win awards for both writing and acting.\n\nThompson and Branagh divorced in 1995. She later married actor Greg Wise in 2003 and together the couple adopted a Rwandan orphan.\n\nThompsonâs recent work has involved a recurring character, Sybil Trelawney, in the \"Harry Potter\" films, and starring as Nanny McPhee in two films about the character. Sheâs also an active member of Greenpeace."
