The plot is a barely connected bunch of scenes, action sequences are hinted at but unrealised. The worst adaptation of Hugh Lofting’s stories to date: all this talent wasted in a…\n\nLast Christmas\n\n2019\n\nUK / US\n\n1h 43min\n\n12A\n\nDirected by: Paul Feig\n\nCast: Emilia Clarke, Henry Golding, Emma Thompson, Michelle Yeoh\n\nUK release: 15 November 2019\n\nKate (Clarke) is a Yugoslavian immigrant whose life is going downhill until she meets the mysterious bike-riding Tom (Golding), who seems too good to be true. Thompson and Kimmings’ script is a saccharine romantic fantasy and George Michael’s music isn’t always incorporated effectively, but its heart is in the right place.\n\nLate Night\n\n2019\n\nUS\n\n1h 42min\n\n15\n\nDirected by: Nisha Ganatra\n\nCast: Emma Thompson, Mindy Kaling, John Lithgow\n\nUK release: 7 June 2019\n\nKatherine (Thompson) is a seasoned talk show host who, when forced to hire new writing staff, takes on former chemical plant employee Molly (Kaling). Kaling’s script is peppy, good-natured and has a good grasp of the issues, and Thompson has her best role in years. Piquant and winning.\n\nMissing Link\n\n2019\n\nUS\n\n1h 35min\n\nPG\n\nDirected by: Chris Butler\n\nCast: Hugh Jackman, Zoe Saldana, Zach Galifianakis, Timothy Olyphant, Emma Thompson\n\nUK release: 5 April 2019\n\nSir Lionel Frost (voiced by Jackman) travels to the Pacific Northwest to find the sasquatch, and finds Mr Link (Galifianakis), who wants to travel to the Himalayas to meet his yeti relatives. It looks beautiful, the action sequences are impressive and the story and voice acting are fun. A charming family adventure.\n\nMen in Black: International\n\n2019\n\nUS\n\nDirected by: F. Gary Gray\n\nCast: Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, Rebecca Ferguson, Kumail Nanjiani, Rafe Spall, Les Twins, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson\n\nMolly (T. Thompson) is a wannabe MIB agent who’s given a chance by Agent O (E. Thompson) and teamed up with golden boy Agent H (Hemsworth). It’s not so much that it’s bad, more that the franchise wasn’t much to begin with: here, a CGI-heavy story relies far too much on Hemsworth’s insouciant charm. A high-budget non-event.\n\nJohnny English Strikes Again\n\n2018\n\nUK / France\n\n1h 28min\n\nPG\n\nDirected by: David Kerr\n\nCast: Rowan Atkinson, Olga Kurylenko, Ben Miller, Emma Thompson\n\nUK release: 5 October 2018\n\nJohnny English (Atkinson) is called back into action after a cyberattack reveals the identities of British secret agents. The cast are game, but the dialogue lacks snap and the direction and editing are atrocious. The lack of laughs are all the more infuriating because it’s easy to see how it could have been funnier.\n\nThe Children Act\n\n2017\n\nUSA\n\n1h 45min\n\n15\n\nDirected by: Richard Eyre\n\nCast: Emma Thompson, Stanley Tucci, Fionn Whitehead\n\nUK release: 24 August 2018\n\nFiona (Thompson) is a High Court judge who finds herself becoming involved with a Jehovah’s Witness teenager (Whitehead) who refuses a blood transfusion for his leukaemia. Heavy-handed adaptation by McEwan of his own novel; not entirely convincing but Eyre brings out fine performances.\n\nBeauty and the Beast\n\n2017\n\nUS\n\n2h 9min\n\nPG\n\nDirected by: Bill Condon\n\nCast: Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, Emma Thompson, Luke Evans, Ewan McGregor, Josh Gad\n\nUK release: 17 March 2017\n\nBelle (Watson) is forced to live with a Beast (Stevens) in this live-action retelling of the 1991 blockbuster. Watson is winsome but feisty, Evans as Gaston is splendid of voice and hilariously odious, McGregor brings much joie de vivre to ‘Be Our Guest’, and it’s an enchantingly realised delight.\n\nAlone in Berlin\n\n2016\n\n1h 43min\n\n12A\n\nDirected by: Vincent Perez\n\nCast: Emma Thompson, Daniel Brühl, Brendan Gleeson\n\nBerlin, 1940. Working class couple Otto and Anna Quangel receive the news that their only son has lost his life in the battlefield and decide to resist the Nazi regime in their very own way. Soon the Gestapo is hunting 'the threat'.\n\nAlone in Berlin: Live from the Imperial War Museum\n\n2016\n\n1h 43min\n\n12A\n\nDirected by: Vincent Perez\n\nCast: Emma Thompson, Daniel Brühl, Brendan Gleeson\n\nBroadcast live from the Imperial War Museum audiences can enjoy a a preview of the film Alone in Berlin, followed by a view of the museum's most famous exhibits from Nazi Germany and a discussion exploring the realities of political protest from Germany during World War II through to present day.\n\nThe Legend of Barney Thomson\n\n2015\n\nUK / Canada\n\n1h 30min\n\n15\n\nDirected by: Robert Carlyle\n\nCast: Robert Carlyle, Emma Thompson, Ray Winstone\n\nUK release: 24 July 2015\n\nBarney (Carlyle), a downtrodden Glasgow barber, accidentally stabs his boss Wullie (McCole) to death, and then has to cover up the crime. Carlyle's directorial debut has some decent performances, including his own, but is seriously let down by a garbled, unfunny script, discordant photography and woefully dated gallows…\n\nSurvivor\n\n2015\n\nUS / UK\n\n1h 34min\n\n15\n\nDirected by: James McTeigue\n\nWritten by: Philip Shelby\n\nCast: Milla Jovovich, Pierce Brosnan, Emma Thompson\n\nUK release: 5 June 2015\n\nKate (Jovovich) is a security hotshot who finds herself framed for murder and on the run, pursued by the authorities and a deadly assassin (Brosnan). Jovovich is an appealing lead, but a talented supporting cast is wasted on dull chases and a nonsensical plot, while Brosnan is just amusingly terrible.\n\nA Walk in the Woods\n\n2015\n\nUS\n\n1h 44min\n\n15\n\nDirected by: Ken Kwapis\n\nWritten by: Michael Arndt (screenplay), Bill Bryson (memoir)\n\nCast: Robert Redford, Emma Thompson, Nick Offerman, Kristen Schaal, Nick Nolte\n\nWhen author Bill Bryson (Redford) decides to hike the over 2000-mile Appalachian Trail, concerned wife Catherine (Thompson) only agrees to let him go if he takes a companion: cue his old schoolmate Stephen Katz (Nolte), a fat, creaky, unhealthily florid slob. Amiable comic adventure, not eventful enough to be…\n\nEffie Gray\n\n2014\n\nUK\n\n1h 48min\n\n12A\n\nDirected by: Richard Laxton\n\nWritten by: Emma Thompson\n\nCast: Dakota Fanning, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters\n\nUK release: 10 October 2014\n\nPeriod piece looking at the early life of Euphemia 'Effie' Gray (Fanning), who at 19 made a disastrous marriage to the Victorian art critic John Ruskin (Wise). Enjoyable if slightly sluggish biopic which overcomes its flaws thanks to Thompson's way with dialogue, even if it's not as affecting as it ought to be.\n\nThe Love Punch\n\n2013\n\nFrance\n\n1h 34min\n\n12A\n\nDirected by: Joel Hopkins\n\nCast: Emma Thompson, Pierce Brosnan, Tuppence Middleton\n\nUK release: 18 April 2014\n\nRichard (Brosnan) is a businessman whose company's pension fund is wiped out by a villainous banker, so he heads to Paris with ex-wife Kate (Thompson) in search of redress. Enjoyable middle-aged heist comedy, with outstanding supporting performances from Imrie and Spall as Kate and Richard's best friends.\n\nSaving Mr Banks\n\n2013\n\nUS / UK / Australia\n\n2h 5min\n\nPG\n\nDirected by: John Lee Hancock\n\nCast: Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks, Colin Farrell\n\nUK release: 29 November 2013\n\nAuthor PL Travers reflects on her difficult childhood while meeting with filmmaker Walt Disney during production for the adaptation of her novel, Mary Poppins.\n\nBeautiful Creatures\n\n2013\n\nUS\n\n2h 4min\n\n12A\n\nDirected by: Richard LaGravenese\n\nCast: Alice Englert, Viola Davis, Emma Thompson\n\nUK release: 13 February 2013\n\nFrom the director of PS I Love You comes this supernatural drama about two teenagers who discover dark secrets in their respective families.\n\nBrave\n\n2012\n\nUS\n\n1h 40min\n\nPG\n\nDirected by: Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman\n\nCast: Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson\n\nUK release: 3 August 2012\n\nA rebellious Scottish princess defies her mother's marriage plans and unleashes a curse on her fairytale kingdom, then must complete a number of challenges in order to lift it. The kick-ass tomboyishness of Merida and luscious landscapes make up for a wavering story.\n\nNanny McPhee & The Big Bang\n\n2010\n\nUS\n\n1h 49min\n\nU\n\nDirected by: Susanna White\n\nCast: Emma Thompson, Rhys Ifans, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Asa Butterfield, Ewan McGregor, Maggie Smith, Bill Bailey, Katy Brand\n\nSequel to the popular 2005 family film. This time Gyllenhaal is single mum Isabel Green (hubbie is off to fight the Hun in WW2) with three out of control nippers to contend with and two insufferably posh evacuee cousins about to arrive on their farm."
