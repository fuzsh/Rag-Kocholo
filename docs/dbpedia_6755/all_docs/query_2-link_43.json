        "text": "Amazon MGM is planning a sheep detective comedy with a baaaaaA-list ensemble cast, including Hugh Jackman, Emma Thompson, Nicholas Braun, Nicholas Galitzine, Molly Gordon, and Hong Chau.\n\nTosin Cole, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, Conleth Hill and Mandeep Dhillon are also set for the feature, titled Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Movie.\n\nThree Bags Full is a live-action comedy about a shepherd (Jackman) who dies under mysterious circumstances, leaving his flock of sheep to solve the case. The synopsis for the film adds: “The local cop Tim Derry (Braun), on the other hand, has never solved a serious crime in his life, so the sheep conclude they will have to solve it themselves, even if it means leaving their meadow for the first time and facing the fact that the human world isn’t as simple as it appears in books.”\n\nChornobyl and The Last of Us writer Craig Mazin penned the screenplay based on Leonie Swann’s bestseller of the same name. Minions helmer Kyle Balda will direct.\n\nLindsay Doran will produce with Working Title’s Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner. Executive producers are Phil Lord, Chris Miller, Aditya Sood, and Tim Wellspring.\n\nPrincipal photography on the feature has already begun, with Amazon planning an exclusive worldwide theatrical release dating the film for Feb. 20, 2026."
