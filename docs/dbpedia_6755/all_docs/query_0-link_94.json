        "text": "Anatomy of a riot: early in \"In the Name of the Father,\" the feckless antics of Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis), a young Belfast ne'er-do-well in the early 1970's, are seen triggering a serious military confrontation. As Gerry horses around on a rooftop, stealing scrap metal and wielding a stick guitar-style, English soldiers mistake him for a sniper. Gerry begins a mad dash away from these authorities, and as he runs through streets and houses, panic erupts everywhere. Instantly roused for combat, Belfast's citizenry sounds the call to arms.\n\nWomen bang trash-can lids on cobblestones; English soldiers in riot gear roll up in armored vehicles; the Irish Republican Army vents its fury at Gerry's sheer stupidity. Even after the crisis is resolved peacefully, nerves are jittery all around. In the wake of the kind of incident that has preceded this riot -- the film's quick depiction of an I.R.A. pub bombing in Guildford, England -- such skittishness is painfully easy to understand.\n\nBy the end of this extended opening sequence to his scathingly brilliant new film, the Irish director Jim Sheridan has perfectly evoked the backdrop against which Gerry Conlon's story takes place. Though he lives within a political tinderbox, Gerry has no foresight and no native cunning. The film's edgy, volatile atmosphere and Gerry's pathetic naivete make his ordeal that much more monstrous as it unfolds.\n\nCollaborating triumphantly again with Mr. Day-Lewis (after the Oscar-winning \"My Left Foot\" in 1990), Mr. Sheridan shows the same ability to tell a story both matter-of-factly and metaphorically. His direction is plain and amazingly resonant, pinpointing all the larger misapprehensions that shaped Mr. Conlon's Kafkaesque fate.\n\nOstensibly the tale of one big glaring injustice, \"In the Name of the Father\" actually delves much deeper, emerging as a fervent indictment of the bitterness between English and I.R.A. partisans. In making his point through the tale of a hapless victim, Mr. Sheridan could not have invented anyone more weirdly compelling than Mr. Conlon, whose story is true.\n\nAlready admired as a startlingly inventive actor, Mr. Day-Lewis gives another dazzling performance in what is so far the role of his career. As played so grippingly and unpredictably, the film's Gerry Conlon is anything but a one-dimensional fall guy. \"Proved Innocent\" is the title of Mr. Conlon's memoir (adapted by Mr. Sheridan with Terry George), which suggests a certain lack of suspense in this story. But Mr. Day-Lewis draws endless interest out of the ways in which Gerry's character is forged right before the audience's eyes.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
