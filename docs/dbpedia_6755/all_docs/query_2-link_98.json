        "text": "Love Actually is our No.1 go-to Christmas movie year after year and, let's be honest, it never gets old.\n\nStill, it turns out even the biggest Love Actually fans (aka us) can overlook some of the film's plot points - and there's a pretty huge detail we've all been missing.\n\nOf course, we're all familiar with the actors who star in the film. Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightly and Liam Neeson = a dream combo. However, fans have noticed something pretty weird about the movie, and that's that they can never seem to remember any of the characters' names.\n\nOne fan tweeted about the revelation, writing, \"Love Actually is my favourite Xmas film but I've just realised I cannot name a single character. Like what is Keira Knightly called? Alan Rickman? Emma Thompson? Do they even have names?\"\n\nOther fans have since been discussing the weird detail, with another adding, \"On a side note, does anyone actually remember the Love Actually characters' names? Or do we all just refer to them as Hugh Grant’s character or Emma Thompson’s character?\"\n\nMeanwhile, a third agreed, tweeting, \"I feel like literally nobody who ever watches Love Actually knows any of the characters' names, no matter how many times they've seen it. I only remember that Alan Rickman's character is called Harry, and I only remember that because of the irony,\" presumably referring to Rickman's role as Professor Snape in Harry Potter.\n\nOf course, the characters *do* actually have names. Colin Firth's character is called Jamie, Keira Knightly plays Juliet, Liam Neeson's character is named Daniel, and Hugh Grant's Prime Minister is called David. Plus, who knew that Emma Thompson was called Karen in the film?\n\nOK, time for a rewatch and, yep, we'll be paying attention to the names."
