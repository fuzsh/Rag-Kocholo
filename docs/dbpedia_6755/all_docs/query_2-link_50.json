Emma Thompson delivers a captivating performance as Miss Kenton, the head housekeeper at a country estate.\n\nHer emotional portrayal of a woman torn between duty and love earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.\n\nIn \"Saving Mr. Banks,\" Emma Thompson takes the spotlight as P.L. Travers, the author of the beloved \"Mary Poppins\" books.\n\nIn the third installment of the Harry Potter series, Emma Thompson enters this magical world as Professor Sybill Trelawney.\n\nShe delivers a powerful performance, bringing Trelawney to life with eccentricity and charm and adding a touch of humor to this beloved fantasy franchise.
