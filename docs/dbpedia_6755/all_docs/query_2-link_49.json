        "text": "Disney has dropped a second trailer for its upcoming film Cruella, which stars Emma Stone as the titular villain.\n\nThe clip reveals Stone’s aspiring fashion designer character Estella clashing with her boss, Baroness von Hellman, played by Emma Thompson. Baroness von Hellman is the leader of a London fashion house and seems content torturing her employees, but Estella has had enough, declaring that she’s ready to make trouble. She’s later seen stealing the Baroness’ Dalmatians.\n\nCruella, set in London in the Seventies, spins off from Disney’s animated classic 101 Dalmatians. It was directed by Craig Gillespie, and also stars Joel Fry, Paul Walter Hauser, Emily Beecham, Mark Strong, Kirby Howell-Baptiste, and Jamie Demetriou.\n\nPer a synopsis, Estella arrives in London with the aim of making a name for herself as a designer only to turn a dark corner due to her poison relationship with von Hellman."
