        "text": "One of my favorite things about Emma Thompson is her sheer unpredictability. Not only has she kept me guessing with those wacky red carpet appearances, but her films really run the gamut — I don’t think anyone could have anticipated that the woman who made us think with “Remains of the Day” and cry in “Love, Actually” would end up being the same one to don a giant wart in order to play this generation’s Mary Poppins.\n\nBut that’s exactly what the Nanny McPhee franchise has turned into (I say franchise because the Oscar winning writer is currently crafting the third installment), which has in turn transformed Emma into an icon for the pint-sized set.\n\nWith “Nanny McPhee Returns” hitting DVD today, Emma rang up PopWrap to discuss her foray into fairytales, explain why all children’s movies should be somber and bemoan how little time it actually takes her to transform into the ugly au pair.\n\nPopWrap: When you set out to write the “Nanny McPhee” movies was your intention to create a part for yourself that no one else would?\n\nEmma Thompson: I don’t know if it was as conscious as that. I loved the book and I thought it was a very original cinematic device – it’s not someone who starts looking one way and ends up looking another, but changes on the inside. I thought it was interesting to not tell a redemption story but have redemption involved, which is what we love about all stories. It’s not your run of the mill part.\n\nPW: Nor is it your run of the mill costume — do children recognize you?\n\nEmma: It’s funny, I’m president of something called The Teaching Awards in [England] and I went up to Northern part of our country to give an award to a teacher, but none of the kids knew who I was. Then someone said, “it’s Nanny McPhee” there was this audible and sort of extraordinary gasp from all these little people who hadn’t made the connection. That was very interesting to me. They don’t recognize me generally, I have to be pointed out. So funny things happen when the car is stationary in traffic and children are gazing out, sometimes the parent will point me out and as soon as I see that happening, I give it a couple of seconds and then I wave the light green and they think I’ve done it because I’m magic. It’s good fun.\n\nPW: How long is the transformation?\n\nEmma: Not long enough! [laughs] It’s only about an hour and a half actually. It’s most neck up and the costume covers my neck, so there’s no prosthetics around there. It’s just gluing and painting.\n\nPW: What do you find harder: adapting a book for children or for adults?\n\nEmma: I think children’s movies are harder. I’m writing the third [“Nanny McPhee”] at the minute and it’s very interesting trying to write one that’s set in present day. The challenges of changing the vernacular are fascinating – bringing her into 21st century America is proving really, really hard. But incredibly interesting.\n\nPW: For me, one of the most enjoyable things about the film is the promotion you did with that pig.\n\nEmma: [laughs] Oh, the studio always provides a pig! They provided me one when I got my star on the walk of fame, they provided one for the London premiere and they provided one for the New York premiere. They’re very good at providing me with pigs, which are my favorite animals.\n\nPW: Do they make those appearances tougher for you?\n\nEmma: No, but I did a photoshoot with a couple of pigs who were so traumatized by the experience that they just sh** violently everywhere. Oh boy … it’s like human’s pooing. It’s not attractive. They’re very intelligent creatures however and the red carpet pigs I’ve been lucky enough to be escorted by have been very calm about photography.\n\nPW: A lot of people were equally caught off guard when you signed on for “Men in Black 3” — what was the appeal for you there?\n\nEmma: I love Will – I did a little piece for him at the beginning of “I Am Legend” and we get on well. It’s nice to come and guest on something with a mate. I do that quite a lot because it’s a good balance with family life, which is so big at the minute because of the age of my daughter. That’s why writing is good – because I can fit it in and around the school year.\n\nPW: As a writer, what appeals to you about a script you haven’t written?\n\nEmma: You’re always intrigued by a story, of course – but unless that story is well-written, it’s not worth telling. And so many aren’t. I think a great movie script is hard to come by, which is why I try to write as many of my own as possible. Not that they’re always great either mind you.\n\nPW: If you were given the opportunity to revisit a character you’ve already played to tell chapter 2 of their story, who would it be?\n\nEmma: I would say probably the tortured journalist in “Imagining Argentina.” It’s a film I did some years back about the woman who was one of the disappeared during the Videla regime in Argentina, and the film ends with her finding her husband but having her daughter murdered. That would be a very interesting character to reinhabit, to see how she coped with the aftermath of trauma.\n\nPW: That’s one of a number of your films that leaves your character at a somewhat ambiguous place.\n\nEmma: Exactly, or leaves you wondering whether they might not have a happy ending – which is always so attractive to me.\n\nPW: You are a fan of the downer ending?\n\nEmma: Yes, you know, I was rewatching “E.T.” and “Close Encounters” the other night and I wrote [director Steven] Spielberg afterwards because one forgets the tremendous levels of sadness and trauma in those movies. In places, my 10-year-old was completely inconsolable. [Spielberg] was never frightened in those days to really make you feel terribly sad, and I think that’s very interesting. I don’t think we’re afraid of terrifying children anymore, but I’m not sure how brave we are about saying “this is just unbearable, isn’t it?” Kids understand that better than anyone else.\n\nPW: In your estimation, what’s the key to being dramatic but not depressing?\n\nEmma: For me, it must have humor — and those films do. Wherever they could have gotten maudlin or mawkish, he undercuts it just in time. Which so few people do and then you find yourself quite often just caught in a spiral of depression as a result of buttons being pressed, so you complain “this isn’t helping.” And I think movies aught to be helping by illuminating. Certainly you can’t just leave people with great scabs of emotion they’re incapable of metabolizing in any way. You have to be clever about it. I don’t think really great family movies are anything without a great sprinkling of sadness – and sometimes a bittersweet ending, which Nanny McPhee always has, because she has to leave.\n\n“Nanny McPhee Returns” is now available on DVD, click here to buy!\n\nPhoto: WireImage; Universal"
