Busy times for Emma Thompson at the moment, as she’s added another movie to her to-do list. This time, she’s – oh god, yes please – taking the title role in a brand new action film called The Fisherwoman. Set to be directed by Brian Kirk (Luther), who un turn is working from a script by Dalton Leeb and Nicholas Jacobson-Larson, Thompson is going to play the widowed fisherwoman of the title. A woman who in turn gets in the way of the kidnapping of a teenager, and thus has to try and save the day. Thompson is also executive producer on the film. We don’t have details on when it’ll produce, but the words ‘hopefully soon’ spring to mind. In the meantime, Thompson arrives back on UK cinema screens later this month in What’s Love Got To Do With It. More as we hear it. At the moment, The Fisherwoman sounds the perfect double bill with Jason Statham vehicle The Beekeeper. More action films titled along these lines please.\n\nImage: BigStock\n\nVariety. — Thank you for visiting!
