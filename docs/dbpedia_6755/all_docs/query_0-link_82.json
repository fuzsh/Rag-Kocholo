She had her first success in the 1980s, in British television -- especially the series Tutti Frutti and Fortunes of War. She then became internationally famous as a film star, and in the 1990s she became a regular nominee at the Oscars. Thompson was nominated for her performances in Howard's End (1992, and she won), In the Name of the Father (1993), The Remains of the Day (1993) and Sense and Sensibility. She was also a newsworthy celebrity because of her marriage at the time to Kenneth Branagh, with whom she appeared in Henry V (1989), Dead Again (1991) and Much Ado About Nothing (1993). From leading lady in the 1990s, Thompson opted for more supporting roles in the 2000s, while raising kids and writing. Memorable screen roles were as Sybil Trelawney in the Harry Potter series of movies, as Alan Rickman's wife in Love Actually (2003), as Nanny McPhee in the children's films she also scripted (2005 and 2010), and as P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, in Saving Mr. Banks (2013, also starring Tom Hanks as Walt Disney).\n\nExtra Credit:\n\nEmma Thompson has also co-authored books featuring the Beatrix Potter character Peter Rabbit. With Eleanor Taylor, Thompson has published The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit (2012), The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit (2013) and The Spectacular Tale of Peter Rabbit (2014).\n\n4 Good Links\n\n2014 profile and interview about her personal life\n\n2013 glowing profile\n\nArticle about her as a screenwriter\n\nShe talks as author of children's books\n\nSee also:"
