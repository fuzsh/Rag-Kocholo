        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n26 Oct 2022, 09:09\n\nCredit: BBC\n\nEmma Thompson shared a touching moment with The One Show viewers last night (Tuesday 25th October) after she was surprised by a long-lost letter her late father wrote to the BBC.\n\nThe Love Actually actress’ dad was Eric Thompson, who narrated children’s show The Magic Roundabout and presented Play School in the 1960s.\n\nEmma was on The One Show to promote her upcoming film, Matilda: The Musical, and while there, presenters Zoe Ball and Jermaine Jenas handed over a letter from Emma’s father asking the BBC for an audition.\n\nJermaine explained: “There's this letter from your dad to the BBC. So he says he's just left the army and that he's been advised to write a letter to ask for an audition with the BBC.\n\n“And I'll tell you what it says, so it says: ‘I have no broadcasting experience apart from an audition in Birmingham some years ago, but I have had stage experience both amateur and repertory'’.”\n\nAlongside the letter were two photos of Eric in his youth, and another letter from the BBC on how well his audition went.\n\nZoe added: “The good news is, Emma, he did get an audition, three years later. The producers wrote a positive report on him, which you can have a look at now, so good isn't it.\n\n“And you can see there, they noted that he had a 'quiet charm and a twinkle and an obvious sense of humour'.”\n\nEmma was left speechless as she re-read the BBC’s report, and while holding up the black-and-white photos of her beloved father, she enthused: “Check him out! He was a bit of alright wasn't he really!”\n\nEric did go on to make his name in children’s TV, but took on more directing roles following a heart attack in 1967. He then passed away in 1982 aged 53.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress is currently busy promoting her turn as the terrifying Miss Trunchbull in Matilda: The Musical.\n\nWritten by Dennis Kelly, the movie has been adapted from the Tony and Olivier award-winning production of the popular musical by the Royal Shakespeare Company, and will include the original music and lyrics by Tim Minchin."
