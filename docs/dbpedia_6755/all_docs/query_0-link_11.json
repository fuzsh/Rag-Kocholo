Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis gives an impassioned performance in this riveting drama that mirrors one man's 15-year struggle and ultimate triumph over a terrible injustice. Oscar winner Emma Thompson co-stars in this gripping film the Los Angeles Times calls, \"A politically charged 'Fugitive.'\" In the Name of the Father tells the true saga of Gerry Conlon. A petty thief in strife-torn '70s Belfast, Gerry's main interests are getting drunk and partying, much to the dismay of his quiet, frail father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). When Gerry angers the IRA, his father sends him to England, where his antics land him in the wrong place at the wrong time. Innocent, but forced to confess to a savage terrorist bombing, he is sentenced to life imprisonment as one of the \"Guildford Four.\" An innocent Giuseppe is also arrested and jailed, and while behind bars, Gerry slowly learns that his father's seeming weakness masks an unmatched inner strength and wisdom. Working with a fiercely dedicated lawyer (Thompson), Gerry determines to prove his innocence, clear his father's name and expose the truth behind one of the most shameful legal events in recent history.",

        "text": "In The Name Of The Father is a gritty, compelling and engrossing film. Day-Lewis is extraordinary, of course.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nJim Sheridan tells his gripping tale with a fury that stokes up an audience the way early Costa Gavras movies used to do.\n\nFebruary 15, 2018\n\nIn the Name of the Father is a model of this kind of engaged, enraged filmmaking, a politically charged Fugitive that uses one of the most celebrated cases of recent British history to steamroller an audience with the power of rousing, polemical cinema.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nAt every point, Day-Lewis is at the center of the story, and he carries the film with an impassioned performance. It helps that it's a great part.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nThe picture turns into a kind of stylized morality play about the right and the wrong ways for Irishmen to respond to distorted portraits of their character, and it's terrifically effective.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nIn the Name of the Father is a deeply stirring film that lessens the moral authority of the I.R.A., English soldiers in Ireland, the British police and the British government.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nDay-Lewis, so intricately repressed in The Age of Innocence, here offers a role reversal in an unreserved and emotional performance that throws caution and inhibition to the winds.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nIf Sheridan didn't feel the need to pile on the pedantic subtexts, this would be an absorbing personal drama, rather than a vituperative, question-begging broadside.\n\nJune 25, 2017"
