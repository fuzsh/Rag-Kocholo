        "text": "by Nathaniel R\n\nHow is it Friday before the Oscars already? So much to do before then including Final Predictions, my own top ten list, two more Oscar volleys, and ten more categories at the annual film bitch awards (my own long-running party of \"best\" this & that). Sorry to rush through the duet of the categories we live for: Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. But they're up. Among the 10 selected actresses there are six current Oscar nominees but only five overlaps; Hong Chau is stronger in The Menu than in The Whale. In both cases, and as always in her career, she's totally elevating her material. \"These are tortillas\" is among the very best line-readings of the year. Somehow she's calm, polite, and dripping with condescension at the same time. She's just a magical actress and it's so satisfying to see her finally get her mainstream due via that Oscar nod.\n\nAnd you surely foresaw that I couldn't have a Best Actress list this year without the great Emma Thompson in Good Luck to You Leo Grande (doing her most revelatory work in two decades) and Danielle Deadwyler, so operatically moving in Till.\n\nP.S. Though we can't do the medal ceremony until all categories are posted, I think I've made it clear over and over again that Dolly de Leon will be my gold medalist for Best Supporting Actress. While it's abundantly clear that she was an 'almost there' in 6th place for Oscar's shortlist, given how well Triangle of Sadness did overall, it's still a damn shame she was passed over. I'd boot any of the current nominees -- even the ones I myself nominated -- just to have her in that lineup.\n\nTeam Experience will be discussing each Oscar category as we head into the precursors. Here's Nick Taylor and Eurocheese...\n\nNICK: We’ve arrived at the most crowded acting category of year, which doesn’t necessarily mean this category will be difficult to predict. If you look at the fifteen women in Nathaniel’s Best Actress predictions -- I think Lesley Manville should be higher for Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris -- you can see that the fifth slot is going to be a bloodbath. It makes it even harder to narrow things down when so many of the turns are fantastic. The sheer amount of chaos offered from the this category in the past couple years makes it hard for me to feel comfortable with setting anything in stone even as we reach the end of the year.\n\nI wanna honor the messiness of the category, from year to year, and spice up how we order this volley. Euro, of all the leading actresses from 2022 with minimal-to-no Oscar buzz, who would you rank among the very best?\n\nClick to read more ...\n\nby Nathaniel R\n\nHere's one we absolutely meant to review at Sundance but didn't get to. We did you disservice. This must-see drama from writer Katy Brand and director Sophie Hyde, now streaming on Hulu, is a fine specimen in the increasingly endangered species of \"character-based drama for adults\". More rising directors and screenwriters should attempt low-budget premises like -- easier to get funding -- provided they can find and guide actors savvy enough to pull off something direct and delicate. Hyde and Brand have done just that even if they haven't attempted to make it very \"cinematic\". It's not based on a play but it does feel like a film version of a play. For the wisely economical 97 minute running time we're entirely focused on just two people in one hotel room. Nancy Stokes (Emma Thompson) is a lonely fifty something widow who hires a male escort \"Leo Grande\" (Daryl McCormack) to fill the void of human connection in her life. She also hopes to finally experience an orgasm...\n\nClick to read more ...\n\nA series by Christopher James\n\nDo one for them; do one for you. If you can still do projects for yourself, you can keep your soul.\n\n— Martin Scorsese: A Journey\n\nEmma Thompson was on a pretty incredible run in the early 90s. Following her Best Actress win in 1992 for Howard’s End, Thompson had a consistent streak of great films. In 1993, she received two acting nominations for her work in The Remains of the Day and In the Name of the Father. On top of that, she was delightful in the critically lauded Peter’s Friends and Much Ado About Nothing (the latter perhaps the hottest film of the 90s). By 1995, she would win her second Oscar for Sense and Sensibility in the Adapted Screenplay category. Every track record is bound to have a blemish. Sandwiched in between Merchant & Ivory and Ang Lee is Ivan Reitman’s infamous Junior, better known as the movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger gets pregnant.\n\nWas starring in an Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy the means to the end of getting her passion project made?\n\nClick to read more ..."
