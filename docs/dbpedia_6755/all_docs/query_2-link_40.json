        "text": "Amazon MGM Studios has lined up a big-name cast for a murder mystery film about sheep.\n\nAs reported by Deadline, animated film Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Movie will feature X-Men star Hugh Jackman, Cruella's Emma Thompson, Mary & George's Nicholas Galitzine, Succession's Nicholas Braun, The Whale's Hong Chau, Doctor Who's Tosin Cole, Game of Thrones' Conleth Hill, Wonka's Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, Star Wars' Mandeep Dhillon, and The Bear's Molly Gordon.\n\nIt serves as a reunion for Jackman and Thompson, as they both voiced characters in Laika's charming 2019 film Missing Link.\n\nRelated: Best streaming services, ranked\n\nMeanwhile, The Last of Us creator Craig Mazin has adapted the script from Leonie Swann's 2005 international bestseller, Three Bags Full, while Minions: The Rise of Gru's Kyle Balda is directing.\n\nThe film follows a bunch of sheep who are intelligent enough to understand humans, not that they let know that, of course. They spend their nights being enthralled by the murder mysteries read to them by their shepherd George (Jackman), so when George is found mysteriously dead, they know exactly what's up.\n\nRelated: Emma Thompson describes \"terror\" watching husband Greg Wise on Strictly Come Dancing\n\nSince local police offer Tim (Braun) has never solved a murder in his life, or any serious crime to be exact, the sheep decide to take it upon themselves to crack the case. The only problem is, they've never left their field before, and the human world is a big, confusing place.\n\nThis one is getting a theatrical release, although that won't be until 2026.\n\nMeanwhile, Jackman will soon be seen on the big screen in Deadpool and Wolverine, reprising the role we all thought he had left behind one more time, opposite his good friend Ryan Reynolds.\n\nThree Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Movie will be released in cinemas on February 20, 2026.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
