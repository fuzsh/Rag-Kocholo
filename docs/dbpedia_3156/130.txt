Many organisations are actively exploring AI, machine learning and deep learning models to uncover new business opportunities. However, they often encounter obstacles when trying to scale their proofs of concept due to the lack of a stable data platform and quality standards.

Here are some success stories from Microsoft's new AI labs, where their expertise in Microsoft Azure AI has been instrumental in delivering solutions that overcome challenges and realise the full potential of AI.

Empowering Railway Inspection with Microsoft AI: The Case of Athena

In a world where Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) connectivity is constantly growing, companies like Athena Industrial Services excel at leveraging technology to improve the efficiency and quality of their services. Canada-based Athena is known for its innovative approach to developing and manufacturing non-destructive testing equipment.

One of Athena's weaknesses was in data management collected by nodes and gateways used in railway track detection, where the abundance of information made it difficult to identify crucial problems.

Partnering with the Microsoft AI Co-Innovation Lab, Athena sought a solution to connect its devices to the Azure IoT Hub, capture and store telemetry data.

Innovation in Education with PLN: BBC

BBC, an institution recognised worldwide for its excellence in producing educational content, was faced with the challenge of organising and making accessible its vast repository of educational content, which includes text, video, audio and more.

In April 2020, the BBC turned to the Microsoft AI Co-Innovation Lab in Munich to create a knowledge services infrastructure that would allow users to navigate its content in innovative ways and ask questions to get direct answers.

Transforming the Pharmaceutical Industry with Artificial Intelligence: The Case of Pharmacube and Microsoft Azure

The pharmaceutical industry faces significant challenges, from the high cost and slow pace of drug development to inefficient research and development (R&D). However, the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the pharmaceutical industry offers the promise of optimisation and cost reduction.

During his residency at Microsoft's AI Co-Innovation Lab, Pharmacube focused on two key technical challenges: standardised pharmaceutical sales data storage and accurate clinical term matching.
