We’ve got a free course covering all the harm it can cause, like security and compliance issues and risks, and how to address them—it’s good stuff. There’s no time like the present, so click below to start!\n\nIt’s self-paced. We know you’re busy, so you can work your way through this course in whatever timeframe works best for you. Plus, you’ll have unlimited access! So, if after completing the course, you want to revisit a particular section for a refresher, you’ll always have that option.\n\nThere are no prerequisites for this course! This course was created for anyone who works in the IT department, but especially those who are responsible for managing their organization’s Microsoft 365 environment.\n\nYes! The course covers how granting end users more control over managing Teams teams and SharePoint sites can help lower the chances of shadow IT risk.\n\nThis is due to the increased freedom and independence it provides to many employees, allowing them to be productive without needing the aid of any unapproved software or third-party applications—all that while keeping security intact!\n\nGood question! In the Microsoft 365 world, shadow IT refers to using unauthorized software such as Google Drive or Slack instead of OneDrive or Teams.\n\nA Microsoft 365 environment is set up to facilitate centralized management and file sharing across a corporate network; using unauthorized services wastes resources and promotes risk.\n\nWith Microsoft 365, you can manage and reduce shadow IT risks using various tools and services that address collaboration needs, as this reduces the need for unauthorized apps and services. Additionally, M365 has built-in security features like data loss prevention data backups, threat protection, and identity management that can further help mitigate these risks.\n\nMicrosoft Defender can also help you identify shadow IT, allowing IT admins to procure or block unauthorized apps.\n\nHowever, managing shadow IT manually can be a time-consuming task. Luckily, there are solutions available that can improve visibility, empower end-users with autonomy and responsibilities, and automate specific management tasks to streamline the process.\n\nIT governance helps establish clear guidelines, policies, and processes for technology usage, helping employees understand what tools are approved and how to use them, reducing the need for unsanctioned apps or services.\n\nAnd if you need to brush up on your governance know-how, we have a course for that too!\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach. Consider various methods to educate employees on the risks of using unauthorized tools. Try training sessions, workshops, or engaging content sharing real-life examples. Additionally, organizations can provide resources such as knowledge bases and FAQs.\n\nIf you need a headstart, check out this article on how to drive Microsoft 365 end-user adoption in hybrid workplaces\n\nOrganizations should establish policies prioritizing reporting and visibility to maintain a secure and compliant tech environment. Regular monitoring for data leakage and analysis of software usage can help detect unauthorized tools and identify areas for improvement.\n\nJust as effectively—consider requesting feedback from those utilizing cloud environments, as this is a practical way to gather insights into the first-hand problems end users face.\n\nPlus, establishing a line of communication between the IT team and workers can only encourage employees to seek IT assistance in the future instead of seeking new tools and software independently."
