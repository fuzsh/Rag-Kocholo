        "text": "Angler Award Category\n\nThe Angler Award recognizes anglers who catch any of the 40 eligible fish species that meet or exceed the minimum qualifying lengths established for that species. Anglers receive a species-specific Angler Achievement Award sticker â€“ can you collect all 40!?\n\nEntry Rules\n\nEligible Species and Qualifying Lengths\n\nEntry Rules\n\nFish must be taken during their respective open season by angling or ice fishing in New York State waters in accordance with New York State Fishing Regulations. Fish showing signs of foul hooking (hooked other than in the mouth), gill nets, tampering or foreign objects will be disqualified. Bowfishing entries are not eligible.\n\nEntry Form: Qualifying fish must be entered on the official entry form. All applicable portions of the entry form must be completed. Entry forms must be received within 30 days of the catch.\n\nSubmitting Photographs:\n\nA side-view photograph that shows the entire fish (angler with the fish is encouraged).\n\nThe fish should also be photographed next to a ruler, measuring tape, or an object of known size (e.g., fishing rod, tackle box, etc.).\n\nInformation provided on the entry form and associated photographs become the property of the DEC and may be used for promotional purposes.\n\nAngler Award and Youth Angler Award Entry Requirements\n\nThe fish must be one of the 40 species designated under the Angler Award and Youth Angler Award Categories.\n\nThe fish must be measured from tip of nose to tip of tail.\n\nThe fish must meet or exceed the minimum qualifying length.\n\nThe number of stickers awarded annually will be limited to one sticker per angler per species.\n\nState Record Category Entry Requirements:\n\nThe fish must be one of the 39 species designated for State Record consideration.\n\nFish must be weighed on a certified scale by the owner or employee of the business where the scale is located. Certified scales can be found at post offices, supermarkets, and bait shops. Fish weighed on personal handheld scales will not be accepted.\n\nWeighing must be observed by one witness other than the scale owner or business employee.\n\nThe fish must exceed the previous record by at least 1 ounce to qualify as a new state record (see current State Records).\n\nFish must be kept for the purposes of being weighed on a certified scale (see b. above) and examined by a DEC Fisheries Biologist.\n\nThe fish must be identified and examined by a DEC Fisheries Biologist prior to any cutting of the fish or removal of entrails. If caught during the weekend, keep fish on ice (do not freeze) after weight certification. Contact the appropriate DEC Regional Fisheries Office on the next business day.\n\nFish fed or otherwise grown with the intention of breaking a state record will be disqualified.\n\nThe DEC Bureau of Fisheries reserves the right to reject any Angler Achievement Award Application on the basis of erroneous species identification, improper handling, illegal fishing methods, evidence of tampering or foreign objects, or inability to adequately document any of the circumstances relating to the catch."
