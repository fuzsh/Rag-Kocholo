        "text": "An email with your registration time is sent to your Sierra College student email three to four weeks before registration starts. Please note: If you apply closer to registration, you could receive this email within 24 hours. You can find your registration time in mySierra.\n\nRefer to the When Do I Register for Classes video for additional information on when to register for classes, check for eligibility and any holds. The video is also available in Spanish, Russian and Farsi.\n\nSteps for What Classes You Take\n\nHopefully, you already met with a counselor who helped you create your Educational Plan and recommended classes based on your educational and career goals.\n\nFollow these steps and/or watch a video on how to review your Educational Plan in Degree Planner:\n\nLog in to your mySierra account\n\nUnder the Home tab, scroll down and click on “Sierra Connect”\n\nFrom your Home Screen in Sierra Connect, select the menu icon in the top left corner (three stacked lines)\n\nClick on “Degree Planner”\n\nSelect your plan, which states “Approved” or “Active”\n\nView the Courses tab to see which courses you and your counselor determined you need for that semester\n\nHow Many Units Should I Take?\n\nWe encourage you to complete 30 units in your first year so you can complete your Educational Plan goals as quickly as possible. We understand that completing this number of units in a year is not possible for every student. If you feel your Educational Plan needs to be adjusted, be sure to see your counselor.\n\nIf you feel you need to make changes to your classes after reviewing your Educational Plan, schedule an appointment with your counselor to discuss further.\n\nWatch this How Do I View My Bill? video, which is available in Spanish or follow the steps below.\n\nTwo Options for Getting Started\n\nOption 1:\n\nYou can see your tuition and fees by logging in to your mySierra account.\n\nUnder the Home tab, click on “Payments/Refunds/Tax Forms”\n\nTo pay your bills/fees:\n\nSelect “Online Payments”\n\nSelect Term and click submit. The Account Detail for Term will appear on the next screen.\n\nSelect your payment preference or establish a payment plan.\n\nNote: Keep in mind you need to make arrangements for payment within 10 days of registering for your classes or they may be dropped.\n\nOption 2:\n\nYou can see your tuition and fees by logging in to your mySierra account.\n\nScroll down on your mySierra screen and click on “Payments/Refunds/Tax Forms”\n\nOn next screen, select “View and Pay My Bill”\n\nSelect Term and click submit. The Account Detail for Term will appear on the next screen.\n\nSelect your payment preference or establish a payment plan.\n\nNote: Keep in mind you need to make arrangements for payment within 10 days of registering for your classes or they may be dropped.\n\nBe sure to get on the class waitlist.\n\nA waitlist keeps track of students who are in line for spots in a full class. If a spot becomes available before the first day of class, the student at the top of the waitlist will have the spot reserved for them for 48 hours.\n\nOpt in to the Class Waitlist\n\nGo to mySierra and click “Registration and Classes.”\n\nClick “Add, Drop or Withdraw from Classes.”\n\nSelect the correct term from the drop-down menu and click Submit.\n\nYou’ll see a section called “Add Classes Worksheet.”\n\nIn the CRN area, enter the CRN number of the class you want to waitlist and click “Submit Changes.” You can find CRNs on the Class Schedule.\n\nIf the status of your selected class says “Closed,” a note will advise you to choose the “Waitlist” option from the drop down menu under the “Action” heading.\n\nSelect the “Waitlist” option in the dropdown, then click “Submit Changes” again.\n\nNow the class should appear on your current schedule with the status of “Waitlist.”\n\nNote: You will not be charged for being on a waitlist. You will need to pay registration fees once you are able to add the class.\n\nHow to Waitlist for Online Classes\n\nSince you will not be able to join a waitlist after classes have started, you will need to email the instructor if you want an Add Code. You can find your instructor’s email by clicking on the class’s CRN link in the Sierra College Class Schedule.\n\nTake Note:\n\nTo register for a class after the class has begun, you must get a unique Add Code from your instructor.\n\nYou can only add classes in mySierra using Add Codes before the add/drop/refund deadline. You will not be able to add classes past the Withdrawal (or “W”) deadline. View deadline dates on the academic calendar.\n\nAfter the add/drop/refund deadline, you must obtain an instructor’s signature in addition to an Add Code, and you must register in person at the Admissions Office.\n\nSteps to Get Started\n\nAttend the first and second class session of each class you wish to add. Let your instructor know you need an Add Code.\n\nIf there is space available, the instructor will give you an Add Code. Keep in mind that students on the waitlist will have priority.\n\nAfter obtaining the six-digit Add Code from your instructor, log in to mySierra. Click on the “Registration and Classes” link, then click the “Add/Drop or Withdraw from Classes” link.\n\nSelect the drop down menu under “Action” to choose “Web Registration.”\n\nEnter the add code and click “Validate.”\n\nClick the “Submit Changes” button.\n\nRemember to pay your class fees or you will be dropped from the class. Learn more about how to pay fees and expenses.\n\nWatch this How to Add a Class After it Has Begun (Late Registration) video, which is also available in Spanish, Russian, and Farsi.\n\nHow to Waitlist for Online Classes After They Started\n\nYou will not be able to join a waitlist after online classes have started. Instead, you will need to email the instructor if you want an Add Code. You can find your instructor’s email by clicking on the class’s CRN link in the Sierra College Class Schedule."
