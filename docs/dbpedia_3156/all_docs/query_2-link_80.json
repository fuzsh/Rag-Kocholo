It’s part of our culture, part of our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.\n\nIn 2022, Microsoft employees around the world generated more donations and volunteer efforts than ever before, raising $248 million for 34,000 nonprofits worldwide, along with 841,000 total volunteer hours. And while the organizations they supported had a wide range of causes, our employees were driven by the same mission: empower people, communities, and organizations around the world.\n\nOur Employee Giving Program matches employee donations to nonprofits one-to-one and donates $25 to nonprofits for each hour Microsoft employees volunteer. We also support events like Hack for Good that leverage our employees’ specialized knowledge to collaborate, create, and build solutions. With Microsoft employees in 190 countries around the world, this accrues to a global impact: from disaster relief in India to humanitarian aid in Ukraine, employees stepped up to support communities in need.\n\nAt the outset of the war in Ukraine last year, more than 20,000 Microsoft employees from around the world raised $17 million for the “Give to Ukraine Campaign.” This total rose to nearly $21 million by the end of the year, all of which brought real, on-the-ground relief to Ukrainian refugees and families. Combined with broader support across the company including in the area of cybersecurity, Microsoft has provided over $400 million for Ukraine since the conflict began in early 2022.\n\nIn Microsoft’s home state of Washington, the impact our employees have is evident in their generosity to local organizations. Microsoft moved to Washington in 1979 with fewer than 15 employees, and today it’s home to tens of thousands of our employees. In 2022, Microsoft, together with our employees, provided over $100 million in cash donations and grants to 4,700 Washington state-based nonprofits, along with 386,000 volunteer hours.\n\nIn addition to the companies listed above, a great example of Microsoft employee support was for FIRST Washington, which provides hands-on learning experiences to inspire young people about science, technology, engineering, and math. In 2022, Microsoft employees volunteered 13,620 hours of their time to help FIRST Washington coach teams of young engineers, mentor students who are historically underrepresented in STEM fields, and judge competitions where students showed off their knowledge.\n\n2022 was a year of record-setting generosity from Microsoft’s employees, and an example of Microsoft’s broader impact and commitment. From supporting affordable housing in the Puget Sound region, to investing in local communities, to teaching students computer science, to providing grants and discounts of Microsoft cloud solutions and services to nonprofits around the world, Microsoft Philanthropies is committed to transforming communities, and this is only possible because of our employees' hard work, skills, and dedication to impact.\n\nWe have already begun to build on this success in 2023, and as we look towards the rest of the year, I’m excited to see what we can accomplish together."
