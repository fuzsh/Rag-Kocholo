Parking Services.\n\n(a) Reservations. You may make a reservation on the Website or an App to self park at The Parking Spot’s parking facility which you designate when making such reservation (the “Facility”), or to bring your vehicle to a Facility to valet park your vehicle in the location selected by The Parking Spot at the Facility or at a Storage Location (defined below). If you are a member of theSpotClub® Program, have set up an Account, have a registered theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card, and make a reservation when signed in to your Account on the Website or App, you can complete your reservation without paying The Parking Spot a reservation fee (the “Reservation Fee”). All other reservations are subject to the Reservation Fee indicated on the Website or App. Reservations made on a “Pay Now” or “Pay Later” basis are subject to the Additional Terms available at https://www.theparkingspot.com/reservation-policy , which are hereby incorporated by reference. In consideration of your payment to The Parking Spot of the Reservation Fee in the amount indicated on the Website or App or your completion of a reservation in connection with your participation in theSpotClub® Program, The Parking Spot agrees to make available to you one (1) vehicle parking space at the Facility, or, if you valet park your vehicle, one (1) vehicle parking space selected by The Parking Spot at the Facility or at an off-site location (“Storage Location”) to which your vehicle may be moved for storage and from which your vehicle will be moved back to the Facility upon or before your return to the Facility (as applicable, a “Vehicle Parking Space”) commencing at the Check-In Date/Time which you designated on the Website or App when making such reservation (the “Designated Check-In Time”) on the terms and conditions provided herein and theSpotClub® Program Terms and Conditions (where applicable), but only if you arrive at the Facility at the Designated Check-In Time. We do not guarantee that a particular parking space, product type or service level will be available. You acknowledge that the Reservation Fee constitutes consideration for the right to make such reservation only, and shall not be credited toward the fee which is payable for the use of a Vehicle Parking Space, or any other applicable fees or charges associated with the parking of a vehicle in a Vehicle Parking Space.\n\n(b) Payment of Reservation Fee. As full and complete payment of the Reservation Fee, you hereby authorize and direct The Parking Spot to process a charge in the amount of the Reservation Fee to the credit card in your name which you designated on the Website or App when making the associated reservation, and you hereby represent to The Parking Spot that you are authorized to use such credit card for such purpose. The Reservation Fee is non-refundable except in accordance with the cancellation policy set forth in Paragraph 5(c) below or the issuance of a Guarantee Policy Pass, as set forth in Paragraph 5(f) below.\n\n(c) Cancellation Policy. You may cancel your parking reservation by following the procedures described on the Website or App for the cancellation of a reservation, provided that such cancellation is received by The Parking Spot by means of the Website or App prior to the Designated Check-In Time. In the event of any such timely cancellation of a reservation, the Reservation Fee will be refunded to you in the form of a credit issued to the credit card that you used to make the reservation.\n\n(d) Grant of License. Upon your arrival and check-in at the Facility at the Designated Check-In Time, you shall be deemed to have been granted a license to self park and lock one (1) vehicle in the applicable designated area of the Facility, or, if you valet park your vehicle, in the location selected by The Parking Spot at the Facility or at a Storage Location to which your vehicle may be moved for storage and from which your vehicle will be moved back to the Facility upon or before your return to the Facility, at your sole risk and at posted rates for a period, not to exceed thirty (30) days, commencing upon your arrival at the Facility (the “Actual Check-In Time”). Only a license is granted hereby, and to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, you acknowledge and agree that (i) no lease, bailment or bailee custody is intended or shall be created, (ii) The Parking Spot does not become an insurer, (iii) The Parking Spot does not guard or assume care, custody or control of your vehicle or its contents, (iv) The Parking Spot shall not be liable for (A) fire, theft, loss or damage to the vehicle, (B) mechanical malfunction, (C) fire, theft, loss or damage to any personal property or article left in the vehicle, (D) damage or loss caused by criminal acts by third parties, or (E) incidental or consequential damages, and (v) you assume full responsibility for any personal injuries that may occur while the vehicle is parked at the Facility or Storage Location. You further acknowledge and agree that if your vehicle is left at the Facility or Storage Location for more than thirty (30) days after the Actual Check-In Time (or longer than thirty (30) days as the Facility Manager may authorize), then such vehicle and its contents may be impounded at your expense and sold for expenses and storage fees. No employee or other representative of The Parking Spot may modify or waive any of the terms of these Terms (other than Facility Manager’s limited right to permit vehicles to remain over thirty (30) days).\n\n(e) Payment of Parking Fees. You agree that, in consideration of the license granted in Paragraph 5(d) above, you shall pay The Parking Spot a parking fee calculated by reference to the parking rates posted at the Facility at the Actual Check-In Time.\n\n(f) Guarantee Policy Pass. In the unlikely event that you arrive at the Facility at the Designated Check-In Time and no Vehicle Parking Space is then available for your use and you paid a Reservation Fee when making the associated reservation, the Reservation Fee will be refunded to you by the issuance of a credit to the credit card which you used to make the associated reservation, subject only to the condition that you shall have delivered to The Parking Spot, within one hundred eighty (180) days following the Designated Check-In Time, a written request therefor together with reasonable evidence of such reservation and such unavailability, as determined in our sole discretion. If you have a reservation for a Facility and we are unable to accommodate you on your reserved day(s) at any service level, we will give you a pass for one (1) free stay of up to seven (7) consecutive days (“Guarantee Policy Pass”). To request a Guarantee Policy Pass you must contact us by email at feedback@theparkingspot.com . We may in our sole discretion request that you provide certain information and documentation to verify your eligibility for such a Guarantee Policy Pass.\n\n6. Customer Surveys After Transactions. The Parking Spot may, in its discretion from time to time, and subject to your permission to receive marketing emails, send or cause to be sent to you a customer satisfaction survey after you transact with The Parking Spot. You may also submit a customer satisfaction survey to us on your own volition. Any information provided by you in that customer satisfaction survey shall be subject to the specific terms, conditions and privacy policy set forth therein and may be used by The Parking Spot for reasonable business purposes. By completing and submitting a survey, you agree to accept these The Parking Spot Terms and Conditions.\n\n7. Linking a theSpotClub® Card to a Credit Card. If you have completed the process described on the Website or App to link your theSpotClub® card to the particular credit card in your name which you designated when performing such linking process (the “Designated Credit Card”), then you shall be deemed to have authorized The Parking Spot to create a theSpotClub® card in your name that will be associated with your unique theSpotClub® membership number and with the Designated Credit Card. You further authorize and direct The Parking Spot to process a charge to the Designated Credit Card upon your presentation of such theSpotClub® card, in an amount then due to The Parking Spot as fees, taxes or miscellaneous charges. You represent to The Parking Spot that you are the holder of the Designated Credit Card and that you are authorized to use the Designated Credit Card. All charges to your Designated Credit Card arising from the presentation of theSpotClub® card with which it is associated will appear on your regular bill from the issuer of the Designated Credit Card.

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect users to do the same. In appropriate circumstances, we may remove or disable access to material on the Website and/or App that may be infringing or the subject of infringing activity. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, Title 17 of the United States Code, Section 512 (“DMCA”), we will respond promptly to claims of copyright infringement that are reported to the agent that we have designated to receive notifications of claims of infringement (the “Designated Agent”). Our Designated Agent may be reached at:\n\nDesignated Agent\n\n200 W. Monroe, Suite 1500\n\nChicago, IL 60606\n\nEmail: copyright@theparkingspot.com\n\nIf you are a copyright owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner) and have a good faith belief that your work’s copyright is being infringed, you should submit a written notification to The Parking Spot’s Designated Agent that includes: (a) your contact information, including your name, address, telephone number, and email address; (b) identification and description of each copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (c) the exact URL or location of the material that you claim is infringing; (d) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (e) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; and (f) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owners. Upon receipt of a bona fide infringement notification by the Designated Agent, it is our policy to remove or disable access to the infringing material, notify the user that it has removed or disabled access to the material and, for repeat offenders, to terminate such user’s access to the Website and/or App.\n\nPlease note that Section 512(f) of the DMCA may impose liability for damages of any person who knowingly sends meritless notices of infringement. Please do not make false claims.\n\nAny information or correspondence that you provide to us may be shared with third parties, including the person who provided us with the allegedly infringing material.\n\nIf you believe that your content should not have been removed for alleged copyright infringement, you may send our Designated Agent a written counter-notice with the following information: (a) identification of the copyrighted work that was removed, and the location on the Website or App where it would have been found prior to its removal; (b) a statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed as a result of a mistake or misidentification; and (c) your physical or electronic signature, together with your contact information (address, telephone number and, if available, email address).\n\nIf a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our discretion.\n\n18. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Agreement.\n\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CLAUSE CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n\n(a) Initial Dispute Resolution. We are available by email at privacy@theparkingspot.com to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Website, App and/or Services. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. We and you (each a “party” and together, the “parties”) shall use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.\n\n(b) Agreement to Binding Arbitration. If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to Paragraph 18(a) above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. All claims arising out of or relating to this agreement (including its formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Website, App or Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association on a confidential basis in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this agreement, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of this agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\n\n(c) THE AAA’S RULES GOVERNING THE ARBITRATION MAY BE ACCESSED AT WWW.ADR.ORG OR BY CALLING THE AAA AT 1.800.778.7879. TO THE EXTENT THE FILING FEE FOR THE ARBITRATION EXCEEDS THE COST OF FILING A LAWSUIT, WE WILL PAY THE ADDITIONAL COST. A REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF FEES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED TO AAA ALONG WITH YOUR FORM FOR INITIATING THE ARBITRATION, AND WE WILL MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO PAY ALL NECESSARY FEES DIRECTLY TO THE AAA. IF THE ARBITRATOR FINDS THE ARBITRATION TO BE NON-FRIVOLOUS, WE WILL PAY ALL OF THE ACTUAL FILING AND ARBITRATOR FEES FOR THE ARBITRATION, PROVIDED YOUR CLAIM DOES NOT EXCEED $75,000. THE ARBITRATION RULES ALSO PERMIT YOU TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS’ FEES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.\n\n(d) THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT.\n\n(e) Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in Paragraph 18(b) shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.\n\n(f) Exceptions – Intellectual Property Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief under law or in equity (including without limitation preliminary or other injunctive relief) in any court of competent jurisdiction for disputes or claims arising out of the alleged infringement of either party’s intellectual property rights.\n\n(g) Exceptions – Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.\n\n(h) 30 Day Opt Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Paragraphs 18(b), 18(c), 18(d) and 18(e) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: The Parking Spot, 200 W. Monroe St., Suite 1500, Chicago, IL 60606, Attention: Legal Department. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days after the first of the following to occur: (i) the first date after the Effective Date on which you (a) create an Account on the Website or App, (b) sign in to an existing Account, (c) make a reservation on the Website or App, or (d) register your previously unregistered theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.\n\n(i) Exclusive Venue for Litigation; JURY TRIAL WAIVER. To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in Paragraph 18(b) do not apply, the parties agree that any litigation between them shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in State of Illinois, Cook County (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside, provided that we are subject to jurisdiction there). The parties expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in the State of Illinois, Cook County for any litigation other than small claims court actions. The parties also expressly agree that, to the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in Paragraph 18(b) do not apply, these Terms shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to its conflict of laws rules that would result in the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois, except with respect to the On-Airport Valet Terms which may be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state in which the Facility identified on the On-Airport Valet confirmation is located. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available. THE PARTIES ALSO EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 18(b) ABOVE DO NOT APPLY, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.\n\n(j) Modifications. Any modification to Paragraph 18 shall not apply to any disputes of which we are aware or reasonably should be aware at the time of such modification, and will only apply to all disputes arising after such modification, regardless of whether such disputes arise from events or omissions that occurred before such modification.\n\n19. Consent to Cross-Border Data Transfers. For users located outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may at times be accessible by our service providers who are located worldwide including in countries that the European Commission or other geopolitical regulatory bodies have determined do not provide the same level of data protection as in your country, province, territory or geopolitical region.
