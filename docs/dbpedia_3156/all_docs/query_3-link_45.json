        "text": "Employees and retirees in the Texas Employees Group Benefits Program (GBP) and their immediate families are eligible to participate in the Discount Purchase ProgramSM. Administered by Beneplace, this online marketplace offers discounts on products and services ranging from computers and theme park passes, to wireless service and education programs.\n\nNote: The program is not available to former employees or to employees and retirees from the University of Texas or Texas A&M University Systems.\n\nHow to Participate\n\nTo access discounts, register on the Discount Purchase Program website using your work or personal email. (A small number of discounts are available to active employees only, and you must register with a current work email to redeem.)\n\nOnce you’ve registered, log in to the site with your email address and password. Browse hundreds of discounts from local and national merchants and service providers. Search for a specific item or view discounts by category and filter results. Follow the link for each discount to redeem the offer. Check the site frequently—new offers are added often.\n\nAbout the Offers\n\nERS does not endorse or sponsor any Discount Purchase Program service or service provider and it does not benefit from members’ participation in the program. ERS continually evaluates the overall use of the program to ensure employees and retirees find the offers helpful.\n\nEmployees and retirees should work directly with a merchant for any questions or issues with an order. Beneplace can assist with general information about an offer and any escalated customer service inquires.\n\nERS does not approve, operate, or control, in any respect the terms of use, privacy policies, or any other agreements of third parties found on the Beneplace website or portal. ERS is not responsible for the information, software, products, or services offered."
