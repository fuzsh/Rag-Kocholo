        "text": "Stop Bullying on the Spot\n\nWhen adults respond quickly and consistently to bullying behavior they send the message that it is not acceptable. Research shows this can stop bullying behavior over time. There are simple steps adults can take to stop bullying on the spot and keep kids safe.\n\nDo:\n\nIntervene immediately. It is ok to get another adult to help.\n\nSeparate the kids involved.\n\nMake sure everyone is safe.\n\nMeet any immediate medical or mental health needs.\n\nStay calm. Reassure the kids involved, including bystanders.\n\nModel respectful behavior when you intervene.\n\nAvoid these common mistakes:\n\nDon’t ignore it. Don’t think kids can work it out without adult help.\n\nDon’t immediately try to sort out the facts.\n\nDon’t force other kids to say publicly what they saw.\n\nDon’t question the children involved in front of other kids.\n\nDon’t talk to the kids involved together, only separately.\n\nDon’t make the kids involved apologize or patch up relations on the spot.\n\nGet police help or medical attention immediately if:\n\nA weapon is involved.\n\nThere are threats of serious physical injury.\n\nThere are threats of hate-motivated violence, such as racism or homophobia.\n\nThere is serious bodily harm.\n\nThere is sexual abuse.\n\nAnyone is accused of an illegal act, such as robbery or extortion—using force to get money, property, or services.\n\nFind Out What Happened\n\nWhether you’ve just stopped bullying on the spot or a child has reached out to you for help, follow the steps below to determine the best way to proceed.\n\nKeep all the involved children separate.\n\nGet the story from several sources, both adults and kids.\n\nListen without blaming.\n\nDon’t call the act “bullying” while you are trying to understand what happened.\n\nIt may be difficult to get the whole story, especially if multiple students are involved or the bullying involves social bullying or cyberbullying. Collect all available information.\n\nDetermine if it's Bullying\n\nThere are many behaviors that look like bullying but require different approaches. It is important to determine whether the situation is bullying or something else.\n\nReview the definition of bullying. To determine if this is bullying or something else, consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is the history between the kids involved? Have there been past conflicts?\n\nIs there a power imbalance? Remember that a power imbalance is not limited to physical strength. It is sometimes not easily recognized. If the targeted child feels like there is a power imbalance, there probably is.\n\nHas this happened before? Is the child worried it will happen again?\n\nHave the kids dated? There are special responses for teen dating violence.\n\nAre any of the kids involved with a gang? Gang violence has different interventions.\n\nRemember that it may not matter “who started it.” Some kids who are bullied may be seen as annoying or provoking, but this does not excuse the bullying behavior.\n\nState law and school policy may have additional guidelines for defining bullying behavior."
