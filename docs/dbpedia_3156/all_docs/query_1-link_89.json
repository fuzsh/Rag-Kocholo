        "text": "A constant, dull ache. A sharp or stabbing pain. A tingling or burning sensation. If you have chronic back pain, it can feel like you’re in constant discomfort or you’re waiting for the hurt to return. And you’re probably wondering exactly how you got here.\n\nDo you just have a “bad” back? Did you move funny and cause an old high school sports injury to flare up? Did that slip and fall on the ice last winter do some lasting damage?\n\nThe truth is that most chronic pain especially in the lower back, is caused by underlying conditions. Sure, an awkward movement or a fall can trigger pain, but those events aren’t usually the root cause.\n\nSo, what are some of those underlying causes of chronic back pain? Let’s start by defining what chronic back pain is. Then we’ll talk about chronic back pain causes and how you may be able to find lasting relief.\n\nHow chronic back pain symptoms differ from acute back pain\n\nChronic back pain symptoms typically come on gradually and are long-lasting, sticking around for more than six weeks. As we mentioned, chronic pain usually isn’t caused by a specific event or injury – nor does it just go away or heal itself without medical treatment.\n\nThis is different from acute back pain, which usually comes on suddenly and goes away within two to six weeks. And because chronic pain is long-lasting, it often causes you to avoid physical activity or compensate in other ways, which can actually make your pain worse in the long run.\n\nHow common is chronic back pain?\n\nPretty common. Research shows that eight out of 10 Americans will experience some sort of back pain during their lifetime. Of those who have back pain, one tenth (about 8% of the total population) deals with the chronic kind.\n\nThe underlying conditions that can cause chronic back pain\n\nPeople often think that a single event or injury is to blame for their chronic back problems. But the truth is that a single cause usually can’t be identified, rather there are several underlying conditions that can contribute to chronic pain.\n\n1. Muscle deconditioning\n\nMuscle deconditioning – also called muscle atrophy – is one of the most common causes of chronic back pain. Muscle deconditioning happens when your back muscles lack the strength and stability to support you properly, leading to wear and tear over time.\n\nSome deconditioning naturally occurs as we age – which we’ll get to a little later – but lack of physical activity is the biggest contributor.\n\nIf your back is hurting or you recently injured yourself, you’ve probably started taking it easy or avoiding certain activities. In the short-term, modifying your activities or avoiding things like heavy lifting are often recommended to help your back heal.\n\nBut too much inactivity can cause muscles to shrink and weaken. When this happens, the muscles in your back may no longer be able to support ligaments and vertebrae as they normally would – which can lead to pain or make you more prone to injury.\n\n2. Improper posture or body mechanics\n\nBad habits can stress your spine and strain the soft tissue surrounding it. And over time, this repeated stress can break down the structural components of the spine.\n\nWhile posture or body mechanics are part of every movement you make (or don’t make), your work environment can have a big impact. If your job requires regular lifting or repetitive movement, proper mechanics are your best defense against chronic back pain.\n\nFor office workers, when you sit at your desk for long periods of time without stretching, it can cause your hip flexors to tighten. Over time, this can cause hips and hamstrings to weaken, leading to lower back pain. If you notice yourself hunching over your keyboard several times per day, you may be developing kyphosis. This excessive curving of the spine is often associated with chronic back pain.\n\n3. Genetics and aging\n\nAs we get older, our bodies change – and aches and pains can become more common. We lose muscle strength and disc space within our spine.\n\nOf course, this natural aging process can be accelerated by the other chronic pain-causing conditions we talk about in this post.\n\n4. Traumatic events\n\nEvents such as car accidents, falls on ice, trip-and-fall accidents and other high-impact events can speed up the aging process on the spine and trigger chronic pain to flare. These events can lead to overcompensating on movements because of the injury.\n\n5. Overuse and repetition of everyday activities\n\nEvery day, the little things we do can have a big impact on the amount of stress we put on our bodies. Examples include:\n\nDriving or sitting for long periods of time\n\nRepetitive motion activities such as walking, bending over, exercising or typing\n\nLifting both small and heavy objects, including kids\n\nSleeping in an odd position or on an old mattress\n\n6. Chronic neck and back conditions\n\nThough back pain can be scary or uncomfortable, it’s rarely serious. Many times, back pain begins to develop with simple, everyday movement rather than an injury or condition. These are often caused by stress, tension, fatigue, inactivity or a new activity that makes your back sensitive to movement. Most of the time, this type of back pain resolves within a couple of weeks.\n\nIn some cases, chronic neck and back conditions can cause back pain and other uncomfortable symptoms. Some of these conditions include:\n\nDegenerative disc disease (spondylolysis) – A type of osteoarthritis that affects the discs in the spine. Over time, these discs can thin and dry out, which may cause back pain. However, it’s important to note that disc degeneration is not always painful. In fact, many people who are diagnosed with degenerative disc disease won’t experience neck and back pain.\n\nHerniated disc – Also called a ruptured disc or slipped disc, a herniated disc occurs when a bump forms on one of the spinal discs. While many people with this condition do not experience back pain, a herniated disc can sometimes put pressure on nerves near the spine, which could be painful.\n\nMyofascial pain – Myofascial refers to the muscles and connective tissue in the body. Sometimes, the muscles, tendons and ligaments around the spine can become strained and cause pain. Muscle strain may be painful and disruptive in some cases.\n\nPinched nerve (cervical or lumbar radiculopathy) – A pinched nerve in the cervical or lumbar spine occurs when there’s compression or inflammation of the nerve root. In addition to pain, this can cause numbness, tingling or weakness in the extremities.\n\nSpinal stenosis – This is a condition where the spine narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.\n\nSpine arthritis (spondylosis) – There are dozens of small joints between the bones of our spines. Like any other joint in the body, these joints can develop degenerative or inflammatory changes that cause pain in the neck or back. This condition is called spine arthritis.\n\nA doctor can talk with you about your symptoms and test for chronic conditions that may be causing you pain so they can help you find the best treatment.\n\n7. Injuries\n\nInjuries to the back can cause a wide range of uncomfortable symptoms, including back pain and a limited range of motion. In many cases, injuries that receive proper care heal in time, and there is relief from painful symptoms. However, sometimes injuries like spinal fractures, stress fractures or sports injuries don’t heal as expected. This can cause long-term pain and other chronic issues.\n\nIf you suspect that you didn’t heal after an injury to your back, consider making an appointment with an orthopedic specialist.\n\nWhat causes chronic lower back pain?\n\nIf you’re wondering why your lower back hurts, you’re not alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), lower back pain may be the most common type of pain adults in the U.S. experience.\n\nCommon triggers for back pain may include poor sleep, stress, tension, worrying, low mood, inactivity, and new or different activities. Managing these factors can help prevent pain. If you have a flare-up, try to stay calm, relax and keep moving.\n\nYou can get relief for chronic back pain without surgery\n\nSurgery can be an effective option for long-term pain relief. But there’s not a lot of data to support that surgery is the best solution for curing back pain.\n\nGenerally, surgery is only recommended after nonsurgical treatment options have stopped working.\n\nThe best treatment for chronic back pain is movement, which may sound weird. When your back hurts, you usually think it’s time to take it easy, so you avoid certain activities or movements because you think it will help you heal faster. But the less you move, the more you’ll experience that muscle deconditioning – and your pain will probably get worse.\n\nSo, how do you heal your chronic back pain? You need ongoing active physical therapy.\n\nHeal by moving through active physical therapy\n\nActive physical therapy involves movement-based activities like stretching, range-of-motion exercises, and targeted spine strengthening and conditioning exercises.\n\nThe movements and exercises are designed to address those underlying causes of chronic back pain so you can strengthen your back, condition your muscles and improve your mobility.\n\nMeet TRIA Neck and Back Strengthening Program: A leader in active physical therapy programs\n\nYour active physical therapy program needs to be intensive and specifically designed to strengthen and condition your back and core.
