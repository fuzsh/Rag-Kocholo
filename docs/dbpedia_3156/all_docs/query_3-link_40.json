        "text": "The Housing Choice Voucher program helps low-income families, individuals, seniors and people with disabiliies pay their monthly rent for apartments or houses in Seattle.\n\nThrough the Housing Choice Voucher program (formerly Section 8), SHA provides rental assistance for people with low incomes to rent from landlords throughout the Seattle rental market.\n\nParticipants in the program receive a housing subsidy in the form of a voucher that they can use to rent a unit from any landlord in Seattle who meets the requirements.\n\nHouseholds in this program earn 50 percent or less of area median income (AMI) to qualify, and pay the portion of rent and utilities not covered by the voucher—typically 30 to 40 percent of monthly income. Preference is given to households that are at 30 percent or less of AMI and those who are homeless.\n\nApplying for a voucher\n\nEligibility\n\nApplicants on the voucher list will be chosen at random when vouchers are available. Applicants need to meet several criteria and preferences at the time they are drawn from the list to be eligible.\n\nHow to apply\n\nApplication for a chance to receive a Housing Choice Voucher (formerly known as a Section 8 voucher) is ongoing. Families and individuals may apply at any time.\n\nSave my Spot\n\nTo remain active on the Housing Choice Voucher list, applicants are required to check in once every month using SHA's 24-hour automated Save my spot system.\n\nInformation for participants\n\nRenting with a voucher\n\nSee information about orientation, finding a rental, leasing, voucher payment standards, utility estimates, inspections and more.\n\nAdditional information\n\nSpecial Purpose Vouchers\n\nSHA works with partners who administer additional voucher programs such as Foster Youth to Independence, Family Unification Program and Veteran Affairs Supportive Housing. The Creating Moves to Opportunity is a pilot program which helps families with school-age children rent in \"opportunity neighborhoods.\"\n\nLandlords\n\nOver 1,500 landlords partner with the Seattle Housing Authority’s Housing Choice Voucher program to provide homes to members of our community with low incomes. Learn about the benefits of the program and how to participate.\n\nPolicies and forms\n\nAdministrative plan and policies\n\nSeattle Housing Authority currently has an Administrative Plan for its Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8). It explains the policies through which the agency administers the program. The plan has been approved by the Board of Commissioners.\n\nForms\n\nFind Housing Choice Voucher forms that can be completed online or downloaded, printed, and returned. Applicants and tenants use the SHA Portal to complete online forms for application, recertification and other functions."
