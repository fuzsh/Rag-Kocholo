        "text": "Law school is the most intellectually challenging and rewarding period of one’s educational career. The Moritz College of Law curriculum is intense, and our students are serious about their studies. We look not only for those who have a record of academic accomplishment but those who have the capacity to thrive in a rigorous learning environment such as ours. We consider each application holistically, and there is no single profile most suitable for admission. Instead of looking for an “ideal” candidate, we invite applicants who bring a variety of skills, accomplishments, and aspirations to contribute to our dynamic community.\n\nProfessionalism takes shape in law school. Ohio State law students possess integrity, a strong work ethic, and a spirit of collegiality. They genuinely want each other to succeed so that they may celebrate professional and personal achievements together. We look for people who collaborate with and support the efforts of others. A commitment to diversity is a commitment to push outside of one’s comfort zone to engage in difficult conversations and embrace new experiences. We look for people who are curious about the world around them and interested in broadening their perspective.\n\nThe legal profession is one of great opportunity and profound responsibility. Lawyers serve clients in a wide range of fields, and their communities frequently call on them serve in various capacities because of their analytical and leadership skills. We look for people engaged with their community or the world around them – the kind of people who work toward making a difference in whatever path they have chosen. Accordingly, the Admissions Office evaluates a variety of factors when considering applicants for admission: academic potential, personal experience and goals, and personal qualities and characteristics. Every part of the application matters. In the end our goal is to find the students who are the best fit and who we can help to become outstanding lawyers and leaders.\n\nWhat is the demographic makeup of your 1L class?\n\nFor the entering class of 2023, as of August 31, 2023, there were 161 students. Approximately 54% of students were female and 27% were students of color. Students ranged in age from 19-36 with a median age of 23. We had students from 30 states with 42% from outside the State of Ohio.\n\nWhat is the minimum LSAT/GPA at Moritz?\n\nWe have no minimum LSAT or GPA at Moritz. The Autumn 2023 incoming class has a median LSAT score of 165 and a median GPA of 3.83.\n\nDo you have a part-time or night program?\n\nNo. Our program is full-time, conducted during the day.\n\nMay I apply to start in the summer or winter?\n\nNo. Fall semester is the only start time for our incoming 1L law students.\n\nDoes Moritz offer any specialty programs?\n\nMoritz offers programs in dozens of areas of law. The college also offers certificate programs in International Trade and Development, Dispute Resolution, and Children’s Studies. In addition, we offer the following clinical programs: Civil Clinic, Mediation Clinic, Criminal Defense Clinic, Prosecution Clinic, Immigration Clinic, Justice for Children Clinic, Legislation Clinic, and Entrepreneurial Business Law Clinic. If interested in our clinical programs, feel free to visit their webpage.\n\nDoes Moritz offer any dual-degree programs?\n\nYes. A student may pursue both a law degree and one of our approved dual degree options: JD/MBA, JD/MD, JD/MHA, or JD/MPA.\n\nWhat are your employment statistics?\n\nJob placement statistics are updated frequently by our Career Services Office.\n\nWhere is the Moritz College of Law located?\n\nSituated in Drinko Hall on the sprawling 1,756 acres of The Ohio State University, Moritz marks the southeastern entrance to campus. Less than 2 miles north of downtown, the school is just blocks away from the city’s Short North Arts District, the Arena District, and the Brewery District. Moritz also is less than a mile away from Interstate 71 and State Route 315 and less than 10 miles from Port Columbus International Airport. The address for Moritz is 55 W. 12th Ave., Columbus, Ohio 43210.\n\nWhy should I attend law school in Central Ohio?\n\nAs the 14th largest city in America with a metropolitan population of more than 1.9 million residents, Columbus is a thriving place to study and start a career. Located in the area are six Fortune 500 companies and more than 700 law firms. Columbus has been named one of the best big cities in which to live (Money), 11th for singles (Forbes), the ninth-top arts city in the nation (AmericanStyle Magazine), and the ninth-best city to live for African-Americans (Black Enterprise). Feel free to check out more about Columbus here.\n\nI’m interested in visiting Moritz. Do you offer tours?\n\nProspective students are welcomed to visit the Moritz College of Law during the summer, academic year, or to attend one of our open house events. If you are interested in visiting Moritz, either for a tour or to learn more about our law school, please visit our page on visiting Moritz.\n\nHow many applications do you receive?\n\nEach year, Moritz receives between 1700-2000 applications for approximately 160 spots in the 1L class.\n\nWhat do you require for your application?\n\nA completed electronic application will include the following:\n\nThe application for admission and $60 application fee ($70 for international applicants)\n\nCompleted character and fitness section\n\nResume (generally 1-3 pages)\n\nPersonal statement (generally 2-3 pages)\n\nOptional – Essays on leadership potential/experience; contributions to a diverse intellectual environment/multicultural experiences, commitment to public interest/public service\n\nThe following items must be submitted in addition to the completed application via CAS:\n\nOfficial transcripts from all colleges attended\n\nTwo letters of recommendation (faculty letters of recommendation are strongly preferred for those students that are currently in school or have graduated within the past two years)\n\nWhen should I take the LSAT?\n\nThere is no preferred testing date for the LSAT. It is offered nine times a year. Please note that we will accept scores from the June examination in the same year you wish to enroll. We will accept LSAT scores up to five years old.\n\nWhat should I study at my undergraduate institution?\n\nMoritz does not prefer or recommend any single area of study for a prospective student, and our students range in majors from accounting to zoology. While typical “law school majors” such as political science, business, history, and English are prominent, we also have students with backgrounds in engineering, education, biology, and mathematics. We encourage prospective students to study subjects that to them are most interesting. Focus on majors and courses that offer the chance to write extensively, examine texts, and practice logical reasoning. The Class of 2026 represents over 50 different majors, so the possibilities are truly open for any major.\n\nI tried checking my application status online but I can’t log in.\n\nThe Office of Admissions will notify applicants by e-mail when their application has been received and processed. The email will include log in information for the online status page. It is important that the applicant provides the office with a current e-mail address and checks their e-mail regularly. If you cannot log in to the site, please contact the Admissions Office at (614) 292-8810 or lawadmit@osu.edu, and they can give your username and/or reset your password.\n\nI sent in all my materials, but my status online says my file is incomplete.\n\nIn most cases, your file is incomplete because we have not yet received your CAS report from LSAC. There is a slight time delay in when we receive your application and CAS report and processed the files as received. If you find that your status has remained incomplete for some time, please contact the Admissions Office at (614) 292-8810 or email at lawadmit@osu.edu.\n\nHow is my application evaluated?\n\nMoritz performs a holistic review of your application, meaning that all items in the file are considered before making a decision. In addition to LSAT scores and GPA, we also look at the candidate’s extracurricular involvement, work experience, personal statement, letters of recommendation, and a host of other factors when making a decision.\n\nWhat is your deadline for applying?\n\nApplications for admission to the College of Law should be submitted anytime between September 15 and March 31 of the calendar year prior to the planned date of enrollment; although applications submitted after the preferential deadline of March 31 will be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis until June 1.\n\nI see your application has a character and fitness section. Will I automatically be denied admission if I answer “yes” to any of the questions?\n\nNo. Character and fitness issues are assessed on a case-by-case basis. By answering affirmatively to any of the questions in the character and fitness section, it will not necessarily harm your chances for admission. We do, however, require you submit an explanation regarding the issue. Please note that if the school learns that your answer to one or more of these questions was not accurate, your acceptance may be revoked or, if you are already enrolled, you may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.\n\nWhy do I need to answer the questions in the character and fitness section?\n\nAfter a law student applies to take the bar examination, the respective bar examiners have the law school provide an evaluation of that student’s character and fitness to practice law. Therefore, an essential part of assessing a student’s character and fitness to practice law must be completed when an applicant is considered for admission.\n\nI’ve received a traffic ticket in the past. Am I required to report that?\n\nNo. Minor traffic and parking violations are not necessary to report. However, charges of driving under the influence of alcohol, driving under the influence of drugs, and reckless driving must be disclosed as criminal charges.\n\nWhile an undergraduate, I was placed on academic probation. Will that negatively affect my chances of being admitted?\n\nNot necessarily. All character and fitness issues are assessed on a case-by-case basis. By submitting a required explanation, we can better understand the circumstances surrounding the issue and take that into consideration when reviewing your file.\n\nI have new information that I would like to be added to my file, may I send that to the Admissions Office?\n\nYes. If your file has not yet been reviewed or has been deferred/waitlisted, you are welcome to send additional documentation in support of your admission. You are encouraged to email the additional information as a PDF to the Admissions Office at lawadmit@osu.edu. When emailing information, please include your LSAC account number for quick identification.\n\nDo you have an early decision program?\n\nApplicants to The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law frequently indicate that Ohio State is their first choice for a legal education. For those students who have carefully researched their law school opportunities, the Early Binding Decision Option provides an expeditious evaluation and decision by the Admissions Committee. This early notification has the advantage of enabling successful early decision applicants to pursue their educational, professional and familial engagements and responsibilities free of the time, expense and anxiety associated with the typical law school application process. Successful Early Binding Decision applicants will be notified of scholarship awards soon after admission. Thus, the applicant should be in a position to commit to attending Ohio State even though they might not have a complete financial aid package at the time of their deposit. It is important to recognize that the benefits associated with admission under the Early Binding Decision Option are accompanied by a reduction in law school choice. Ohio State reserves the right to provide other law schools with the names of applicants accepted under our Early Binding Decision Option.\n\nDoes Moritz permit transfer students?\n\nYes, provided the applicant has:\n\ncompleted one year of work as a full-time student at an accredited law school;\n\nranked in the upper-third of their law school class; and\n\nquantifiable pre-law credentials comparable to those of the Ohio State law student with whom they would be competing.\n\nA transfer applicant is responsible for making certain that the following items are submitted in order for their application to be considered complete:\n\nThe completed application and application fee of $60 (submitted electronically through LSAC)\n\nOfficial transcripts of all work completed at all undergraduate and graduate institutions attended and the law school attended sent directly to LSAC\n\nA current CAS report sent from the Law School Admission Council\n\nAn official letter from the law school attended certifying good standing and class rank sent to lawadmit@osu.edu\n\nA letter of recommendation from a law professor who has taught the applicant in class\n\nA resume including honors, awards, activities, and work experience\n\nA brief statement (one page or less) giving the reason for transfer to the Moritz College of Law\n\nWhat is the application fee?\n\nThe fee is $60 for domestic applicants and $70 for international applicants.\n\nHow long will it take for a decision to be made?\n\nIdeally, from the time your application goes under review, we hope that you will receive a decision in six to ten weeks. However, be aware that this may fluctuate throughout the year. The Moritz College of Law Admissions Committee renders admissions decisions on a rolling basis after the application file is received and is complete (with supporting documents, such as the CAS report). Early Binding Decision applicants will receive a decision by December 19. Applicants will be notified of their decision via e-mail and decisions will be posted on the online status page.\n\nI applied in November and it is now March, why haven’t I heard a decision?\n\nIn some cases, your application file is not fully completed. We only begin reviewing an applicant’s file when we receive all of the necessary documents. In this case, it is best to call or email the Admissions Office at (614) 292-8810 or lawadmit@osu.edu to see if your file is missing any items.\n\nCan I call and get my decision over the phone?\n\nNo. Both for the sake of your privacy and our phone lines, we do not give admissions decisions over the phone. Your decision will be displayed on the Applicant Status page and through email.\n\nI am on the wait list. When will I know whether an admissions offer will be extended?\n\nOnce you have been placed on the wait list, you truly have to wait and see. Every year, Ohio State Law receives applications from qualified students in a number that far exceeds the number of available seats. We limit our entering class size to approximately 160 students. If you have been placed on the wait list, the Admissions Office has carefully reviewed your file. Although additional information may be submitted (i.e. an updated transcript), it will not be reviewed unless, and until, a decision is made to extend offers of admission to students on the wait list. The Admissions Office takes great effort to determine those students who really are planning to enroll so that we can determine, as soon as feasible, whether offers will be extended to wait-listed students. The number of students pulled from the wait list varies greatly each year.\n\nAlthough we fully understand that each student on the wait list needs to know, as soon as possible, whether they will have an opportunity to attend Ohio State in the fall, we cannot extend offers from the wait list based upon individual student deadlines. If we are able to determine in late-June that the likelihood of an individual student being pulled from the wait list is very small, we will notify that student in order to assist them in finalizing other options.\n\nIf a decision is made to extend offers to students on the wait list, the Admissions Office will review the files and select a group of students for further consideration. Factors taken into account may include, but are not limited to, the recommendations of the Admissions Committee, comparability of quantifiable credentials to that of the seated class, compatibility with Moritz College of Law programming, and contribution to the range of diversity within the class (educational/experiential background, residency/nonresidency, ethnic/cultural, area of substantive interest, etc.).\n\nIf there is any change on your wait list status, we will contact you as soon as possible. We would appreciate it if you would keep us informed of changes in your contact information via email at lawadmit@osu.edu.\n\nAre scholarships given to incoming students?\n\nYes. Primarily, first-year students are eligible for scholarships based on academic merit, leadership, social justice, access, and public interest. For more information about our scholarships, please visit the Scholarships & Financial Aid section on our website.\n\nI want to work during my first year. Is that permitted?\n\nThe Moritz College of Law has a long-standing policy that states that first-year students may not work. The first year of law school is very different from undergraduate school or holding a job, as the demands of the curriculum are inconsistent with outside employment. You can meet with the Dean of Student Affairs to ask about working as a 1L.\n\nCan I get football tickets?\n\nLaw students are eligible to purchase a season ticket for Ohio State football games provided that your seat deposit is paid by May 1. Please visit www.hangonsloopy.com or call 1-800-GO-BUCKS for more information.\n\nWhat classes will I take my first year?\n\nEach student takes Contracts, Torts, Criminal Law, Civil Procedure, Legal Research, Legal Writing and Analysis, Property, Legislation, and our Legal Practice and Perspectives Program courses. Constitutional Law is a required second-year course.\n\nDo you offer deferred admissions?\n\nMoritz does offer deferred admissions on a case-by-case basis. If you are admitted and are interested in a one-year deferral, please send an email to lawadmit@osu.edu explaining your reasons for a deferral.\n\nIs a seat deposit required to hold my spot?\n\nIf you are admitted to Moritz and wish to attend in the fall, you must submit a $225 seat deposit. Only by submitting your seat deposit will you be able to reserve your seat in the 1L class.\n\nIs the seat deposit refundable?\n\nNo. After you submit your seat deposit, it is not refundable under any circumstances. Should you choose not to attend Moritz, you will forfeit your deposit."
