This practice will allow another member of our community to fill the spot and participate.\n\nAfter three missed reservations, access in the app will be suspended 14 days. If you did attend one of the reservations and you were not checked in, please let us know through emailing us directly or asking the front desk and we will work with you to resolve your use of the reservation system once again.\n\nFor all app questions, please contact us at: APPSUPPORT@YMCALA.ORG\n\nTo reactivate your membership or for other membership questions, please contact us at: MEMBERSHIP@YMCALA.ORG"
