After that date, we will cease new feature development for Bamboo Server and will end support for this product on February 15, 2024 PT. To learn more about Bamboo Data Center, visit our homepage.\n\nFebruary 2, 2021 - End of Server product feature development\n\nWe are no longer developing new features for Server products. We’ll continue to provide bug fixes for Server products until February 15, 2024 PT.\n\nFebruary 2, 2021 - End of sale for apps now included in Data Center\n\nAs part of the end of Server sale and support, we’ve included several Atlassian-built apps and new functionality with a Data Center subscription:\n\nJira Software Data Center: Now includes Advanced Roadmaps (formerly Portfolio for Jira)\n\nConfluence Data Center: Now includes Team Calendars for Confluence and Analytics for Confluence\n\nJira Service Management Data Center: Now includes Insight - Asset Management and Insight Discovery\n\nWhat this means for customers with Server licenses:\n\nIf you don't yet use the app: As of February 2, 2021 PT, you can no longer purchase or request a quote for any of these apps. These apps (or the equivalent native functionality) will only be available by moving to Cloud or Data Center.\n\nIf you have an existing license for one of these apps: You can continue to renew support and maintenance for these apps until the end of support date.\n\nMay 1, 2021 - End of new Server app submissions\n\nFor Marketplace Partners and developers, we no longer accept new Server app submissions for the Atlassian Marketplace.\n\nFebruary 15, 2022 - End of tier upgrades and downgrades for Server products and apps\n\nYou can no longer upgrade or downgrade tiers for your Server products or apps. Changing tiers will only be available by moving to either Cloud or Data Center, with the following exceptions:\n\nStarter licenses: Moving from a Starter to a full license is considered a new sale, which means that as of February 2, 2021 PT (the end of new license sales), you won’t be able to upgrade your Server Starter license to a full license. After that point, upgrading will only be available by moving to either Cloud or Data Center.\n\nFisheye and Crucible: You can still upgrade or downgrade tiers for Fisheye and Crucible.\n\nFebruary 15, 2023 - End of new Server app sales\n\nYou can no longer purchase new apps for your existing Server licenses. App renewals are expected to be prorated with an end date of February 15, 2024 PT to match your Server products' end of support date.\n\nFebruary 15, 2024 - End of Server support\n\nSupport and bug fixes are no longer available for your Server products and apps, and any renewals were prorated to match this date. To stay secure and benefit from continued innovation, we strongly recommend migrating to Cloud or Data Center before the end of support date."
