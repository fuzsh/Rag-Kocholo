        "text": "We recommend you set your Prebooked Parking Online reservation for at least 3 hours prior to your originating flight and 3 hours after your return flight. This will give you flexibility to arrive early, or potentially plan for delayed/cancelled flights or unusual weather.\n\nNo, you are not able to leave and return on the same reservation.\n\nOnce you have entered through the toll gates, your reservation will be marked as completed after you exit, and re-entering the airport afterwards will result in being charged the drive-up rate for the lot you parked in.\n\nYes, you may make changes to your reservation up to one (1) hour in advance of your reservation start time.\n\nPlease click here to make changes to your reservation.\n\nYou may cancel your booking at any time up to one (1) hour before the beginning of your booking arrival time and receive a full refund. To do so, you can click here or click on the âModify Bookingâ link on the confirmation email and then cancel or modify.\n\nModifications to your reservation, such as your license plate, must be made at least 1 hour prior to your booking arrival time through the \"Find My Prebooked Parking\" feature on the DFW Airport Prebooked Parking site. This change can be made with no additional fee. Arriving in a vehicle different from the reservation will result in a charge at the posted parking rate.\n\nA: Log in to your MyDFW account and navigate to âMy Parking Bookingsâ to view your reservations. Click on âManage Bookings.â If your trip has already started (and is in progress), you will see an option to Extend Parking. This option will not be available for future trips.\n\n*The customer service center is unable to assist with these requests due to Payment Card Industry and Personal Identifiable Information compliance.\n\nTo cancel or modify a reservation, go to \"Find My Prebooked Parking\" or click here. You will need the confirmation number from your payment confirmation email and the email address you provided during the payment process in order to access this file.\n\nTo create a reservation, please visit the Prebooked Parking page or the DFW Airport app.\n\nA: The âExtend Stayâ button will only appear after your scheduled arrival and before your scheduled exit.

Parking in another terminal will subject you to incur additional fees. You can access all terminals through Terminal Link shuttles or Skylink. Terminal Link shuttles are designated on the curbside and Skylink can be accessed once through security.\n\nIf you had an issue when entering the airport, and took a ticket from the machine, please use the âCash Onlyâ lane to speak to an attendant and show them your prepaid parking reservation.\n\nOtherwise, you may use any lane to enter and exit through the airport toll plazas.\n\nYes, we sell a limited number of spots online to ensure that customers who drive up without a prebooked reservation can still find parking.\n\nHowever, all drive up customers will pay the drive-up parking rates, which can be found here under each product.\n\nThe QR code is the backup method to enter and exit through the toll plazas.\n\nIf the gates do not open automatically after a few seconds when you pull up, then please scan the QR code located in your email confirmation to enter and/or exit.\n\nPlease have your QR code that you received in your email confirmation up and ready on your phone. The toll gates should open automatically within a few seconds of you pulling up. If they do not, please scan the QR code to get through the toll gate. Do not pull a ticket.\n\nOnce you have received your booking confirmation, you can relax knowing that your parking needs are covered.\n\nHow you use your booking to enter and exit DFW Airport will depend on whether or not you have a TollTag. Instructions on use of TollTag at DFW Airport Parking are listed HERE.\n\nIf you have a TollTag on your vehicle:\n\nEnter and exit DFW Airport as normal using the car and identical TollTag associated with your visit.\n\nYour TollTag will be only be associated with your prebooked parking confirmation and will NOT be charged for your parking stay.

If you still do not see the discounted rate, then it is safe to assume that the discounted rate is not available for the dates in question.\n\nNo, you are not able to leave and return on the same reservation.\n\nOnce you have entered through the toll gates, your reservation will be marked as completed after you exit, and re-entering the airport afterwards will result in being charged the drive-up rate for the lot you parked in.\n\nYou qualify for a refund if:\n\nYou have approved specialty military license plates. Please click here for eligibility.\n\nYou prebooked a reservation but you were charged when exiting the airport (subject to review).\n\nYou parked at Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Regency or with DFW Airport Valet and you were charged when exiting the airport.\n\nYour airline cancelled or delayed your flight.\n\nIf you qualify for a refund, please click here to request your refund and attach all relevant documents.\n\nYou do not qualify for a refund if:\n\nYou have temporary or paper tags for specialty license plates.\n\nYou were charged a Passthrough rate (driving from one end of the airport to the other).\n\nYou failed to cancel your reservation at least 1 hour before airport arrival time.\n\nYou were flying standby and did not get on your flight.\n\nThe license plate of the car you bring to the airport does not match the license plate you entered in the reservation, i.e., please bring the car that you booked.\n\nYes, the original reservation will be refunded.

The original $50 will be refunded within 72 hours.\n\nIf you have not received your refund in 72 hrs, please click here to request your refund."
