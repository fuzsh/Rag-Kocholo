        "text": "Students who apply to Florida State University for first-year admission will receive one of the following admission decisions:\n\nSummer or Fall Admit\n\nIf you were admitted for the summer or fall term, you must complete the following steps to secure a spot in our first-year class:\n\nClaim the FSUID.\n\nPay the $200 non-refundable admission deposit by May 1.\n\nComplete the mandatory orientation registration, select a session, and submit payment.\n\nDefer\n\nPlease note a deferral is not a denial. However, we would like some more information before we make a final admissions decision. Deferred students should complete the Deferral Reply Form through their Application Status Check and, if available, should submit an updated SSAR with first-semester grades. We will also accept new test scores, which can be submitted through the Self-Reported Test Scores Form on the Application Status Check. Early Action Deferred students will receive a final decision in February, while Regular Decision Deferred students will receive a final decision in early April.\n\nSeminole Pathways Offer\n\nStudents selected by the Office of Admissions to participate in this program will be able to join us on the Tallahassee campus after completing one of the four pathways outlined.\n\nFSU Next Program\n\nThe FSU Next Program offers a unique opportunity for students to start their journey at Tallahassee State College in the fall, with the added bonus of taking a unique, in-person course on our FSU campus. Students would be fully admitted to FSU for the spring term.\n\nCourse Load Requirement\n\nStudents admitted to the FSU Next Program must enroll in 12 to 15 semester hours of college credit at Tallahassee State College in the fall. You will work with academic advisors to determine recommended college courses based on major requirements in the Academic Program Guide and any expected accelerated coursework.\n\nStudents will be enrolled in the one-hour \"Gateway to Garnet and Gold\" course at FSU in the fall.\n\nGPA Requirement\n\nYou must earn a minimum 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) college grade point average in your fall classes with no grade below C. If you take classes in the summer, your college GPA for that term must also be 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale) with no grade below C. If you take summer classes, you must have an official transcript sent to FSU Admissions before the start of fall term.\n\nEnglish Requirement\n\nYou must enroll in ENC 1101 (the first English composition class), unless you have earned college credit for English composition through AICE, AP, CLEP, IB, and/or dual enrollment. Refer to Accelerated Credit for college credit awarded through acceleration.\n\nMath Requirement\n\nYou must enroll in MAC 1105 (College Algebra, preferred math), MGF 1130 (Mathematical Thinking), or MGF 1131 (Mathematics in Context) depending on math placement and your major's math requirement, unless you have already earned comparable or higher-level course credit through an accelerated mechanism such as AICE, AP, CLEP, IB, or dual enrollment. You should refer to the Academic Program Guide for your major's math requirement. You should refer to Accelerated Credit for college credit awarded through acceleration.\n\nOur office will periodically follow-up with FSU Next Program students over the summer and fall as we prepare for their enrollment in the spring.\n\nDeny\n\nIf you are denied admission and still wish to attend FSU, you are encouraged to re-apply in the future after earning an Associate in Arts degree or completing 60+ semester hours. We encourage student to explore the Aspire Transfer Program. Tallahassee State College is just steps from FSU's campus, students can live with FSU students in off-campus housing and have the opportunity to participate in FSU activities, all while earning their Associate in Arts degree and prerequisites for their undergraduate program."
