        "text": "The Alabama ABC will hold a Sweepstakes to award approximately 50 places in line at a Quarterly Limited Release event. The event will be held at 22 ABC Select Spirits stores and take place on the fourth Saturday in the months of March, June and September 2024. Winners will be assigned a position in line and will be asked to line up at the store no later than 9:30 a.m. on the day of the event. Winners not in line by 9:30 a.m. on the day of the event will forfeit their position in line. A store employee will verify sweepstakes winners 30 minutes prior to the store opening. The store will open for business at 10:00 a.m. on the day of the event.\n\nAll current residents of the State of Alabama of legal drinking age (21) wishing to enter the Quarterly Limited Release Sweepstakes or Annual Whiskey Release Sweepstakes will need to visit the ABC Board website and complete the registration form. Your name and address information MUST match your Alabama State issued ID or Alabama driver's license exactly. Should you win a place in line at our event and the name on your ID does not match the entry exactly, you will forfeit your place in line - no exceptions. All active military that are stationed in Alabama and can provide proof of residency are welcome to enter the Sweepstakes. The entry website will open quarterly, and dates can BE VIEWED HERE. All Quarterly Limited Release Sweepstakes participants will receive notification within 48 hours of the closing of the registration. All entrants will be notified via text and email. Please make every effort to verify the validity of your email and phone number at the time of entry. If you are awarded a place in line, the notification will inform you of your location and your position in line.\n\nWinning an Alabama ABC Select Spirits 2024 Quarterly Limited Release Sweepstakes WILL NOT guarantee any specific product. It WILL guarantee you a position in line at a store on the day of the event. No need to camp out for three days. Our Sweepstakes program will randomly select names to secure a position in the line at each of our Quarterly Limited Release Sweepstakes events. The first name chosen by our random selection Sweepstakes program will be awarded position #1 in the line at the venue. The second name will be awarded position #2 and so on until all guaranteed positions are awarded.\n\nAt exactly 9:30 a.m. on the day of the event, the store will welcome any person of legal drinking age (21) that does not have a guaranteed position in line to participate in the walk-up line. Walk up customers will be allowed to line up behind the Sweepstakes winners at this time. They will enter the store in the order in which they arrived AFTER the Sweepstakes winners have entered.\n\nA valid State issued Alabama ID or Alabama driver’s license must be presented to participate in the walk-up line. Active-duty military stationed at an Alabama base with proof of residency will be accepted.\n\nWinner Procedures\n\nEach Sweepstake winner will need to be present at the store and in line at 9:30 a.m. on the day of the event. Sweepstakes winners will be allowed to line up as early as 9:15 a.m. the day of the event. Our employees will take the 30 minutes prior to opening to verify the identities of the sweepstakes winners and their assigned position in line. To get a full list of participating stores CLICK HERE. Please remember to bring your Alabama State issued ID, Alabama driver's license or military photo ID. The name on your ID must match the name on the Sweepstakes entry exactly. All Sweepstakes winners NOT present and in line at 9:30 a.m. on the day of the event will be disqualified and the line will adjust to absorb the missing participant’s position in line.\n\nParticipants may purchase from Tables 1 & 2 as detailed below:\n\nTable 1 - 1 bottle from Table 1 - (1 item total) - (these are the most highly allocated products)\n\nTable 2 - 1 bottle1 from Table 2 - (1 item total) - (these are the second most highly allocated products)\n\nParticipants will not be allowed to purchase multiple items from either table.\n\nWhile in the store, all products that are available will be displayed on one of the two tables. Participants are asked to point at a bottle, and one will be supplied from reserves until the inventory is exhausted. At that point the last bottle will be given to the participant from the table.\n\nThank you for your safe participation in the 2024 Quarterly Whiskey Release.\n\nNot-Selected Procedures\n\nYou did not win a spot in line? Don't worry - you can still participate!\n\nWe are awarding approximately 50 spots in line. The actual number of positions awarded will be determined by the number of bottles we have available at the stores during any given event. Because the inventory is very limited in the Quarterly Limited Release events, we anticipate having fewer bottles left after the sweepstakes winners have made their purchases. However, there may be a small amount of product left that members of a walk-up line would enjoy. Simply show up on the day of the event and line up behind the Sweepstakes winners. Walk up line participants will be allowed in the store in the order in which they arrived. You will still need a valid Alabama State issued photo ID, Alabama driver's license or military photo ID. If you are military personnel stationed at a base in Alabama, you will need to show proof of residency. Valid ID as specified above, or proof of residency (military personnel) is required to register as a walk-up participant. The purchasing procedures inside the store will mirror the Winner’s procedures. Sweepstake’s winners can join the walk-up line AFTER they have participated in the Sweepstakes event. They must go to the end of the walk-up Line. Walk-up line participants may rejoin the back of the line once they have participated the first time.\n\nHow do I enter the Quarterly Sweepstakes?"
