Please note that there is a limit to how many bicycles each ferry can safely carry and if we reach bicycle capacity you may not be permitted to board with your bicycle.\n\nMotorized sit down scooters and gas-powered bikes are not permitted onboard.Â Â Only ADA Compliant motor vehicles (scooter or wheelchair).\n\nAll bicycles and scooters are required to remain outdoors on theÂ bow of the vessel unless the bicycle/scooter is a folding unit, in which case it may be brought into the cabin portion of the boat. The crew may request that foldable units be kept outdoors on the bow of the vessel if they pose a safety issue due to the vessel being at capacity, the item is blocking an aisle/seating area or exit. Please keep in mind walkways/staircases must be clear at all times for safety purposes."
