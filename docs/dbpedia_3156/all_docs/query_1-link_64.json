        "text": "What is your refund policy?\n\nAs applicable, classes and membership packages are non-refundable. No exceptions.\n\nWe do not offer refunds on purchases for our services, beyond your statutory rights. We strongly ask you to be modest in your initial membership purchases, and to make sure you like us, can reach the venue, and like what we do before making extravagant purchases.\n\nUnused merchandise will be accepted for a full refund within 7 days of purchase. After 7 days, a store credit will be issued for up to 30 days. No returns will be provided without a receipt.\n\nFor Individuals Located in the European Union: You can cancel your order for a class or membership package without giving any reason within 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the purchase to the extent you have not used the package purchased. You must inform us of your decision to cancel your order. You may submit your request by contacting us at [email protected]. To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication before the 14 days’ cancellation period has expired.\n\nFor questions or support with online purchases or returns, please visit www.barrys.com/contact-us.\n\nCan I freeze my membership?\n\nIf you commit to a membership, you can cancel it with a doctor’s order or due to a move out of the region. Hopefully you are moving to a region with a Red Room though! In either case, documentation may be required. You can also freeze it for up to six months for an injury. If you wish, you can freeze a membership for the duration of your pregnancy. We support you and when you are ready to come back to class postpartum, you can take it at your own pace. You know your body best and we are so impressed with our Mamas-to-be and new mamas in class.\n\nWhat if I move away from the studio where I purchased my membership?\n\nYou will be able to transfer your membership to a Barry’s X membership, or maintain the in-studio membership and either pay the difference or receive a refund depending on the market transferred to and based on the Holiday Sale rate.\n\nWhat happens at the end of my membership?\n\nIf you purchased one 6 month membership, your membership will convert into a regular 30-day Recurring Membership at our regular in-studio rates once your 6 months are complete. You may activate this new 30-day membership by booking into a class. If you do not activate within 30 days of your 6-month membership being completed (by usage or expiry), the membership will be activated for you. You may cancel this monthly recurring membership by connecting with your studio.\n\nIf you purchased two 6 month memberships. You should activate your second 6 month membership by booking into a class within 30 days of your first 6-month membership finishing (by usage or expiry). If you do not activate within 30 days of your first 6-month membership being completed (by usage or expiry), the second 6-month membership will be activated for you. Both of these memberships are non refundable.\n\n*6 Month Membership Terms and Conditions: Memberships are prepaid for 6 months and all classes added upfront. Memberships are valid in the regions specified at time of purchase. Memberships are non-refundable and not transferable. Memberships may be paused one time for 30 days during the 6 month period. All classes for the prepaid membership duration will be added to client account on the day the membership is activated and will expire 6 months after the activation date.\n\nHOLIDAY SALE PACKAGES\n\nCan I return these packages?\n\nNo, these packages cannot be returned or refunded.\n\nCan I use my package at any studio?\n\nYour package can only be used in markets of equal or lesser value.\n\nCan I bring a friend?\n\nYes, packages can be used to bring guests.\n\nWhat if I have a medical emergency that restricts me from utilizing my package?\n\nExpiration dates on packages can be extended in the event of an injury or illness, when accompanied by a doctor’s note. Doctor’s note must include the length of time you are unable to utilize your package.\n\nWhat if I move away from the studio where I purchased my package?\n\nPackages can be used at studios of equal or lesser value. If needed, you will be able to transfer your package to a Barry’s X membership, or maintain the in-studio package and either pay the difference or receive a refund depending on the market transferred to and based on the Holiday Sale rate.\n\n*Holiday Sale Package Terms and Conditions: Packages are prepaid and valid for 12 months from the date of purchase. Packages do not include access to Barry’s X content. Packages are only valid in regions of equal or lesser value and are non-refundable and not transferable. Expiration dates can not be extended unless in the event of an injury or illness, when accompanied by a doctor’s note.\n\nSUMMER 6-PACK SALE\n\nCan I return these packages?\n\nWhat is your return policy?\n\nYou can find all information regarding our return policy on the Terms & Conditions page here.\n\nDo you offer gift cards?\n\nYes! You can find options for your region on our Gift Card page.\n\nCan I leave my kids, pets, or other items in the lobby?\n\nWe’d love to share the Barry’s love with everyone, but we unfortunately can’t be liable for anything left in our lobby area. We do not offer child or pet sitting at this time. We love the little ones, but all children must be accompanied by a supervising adult at all times.\n\nWhat if I’m pregnant or just had a baby?\n\nWe strongly recommend you talk with your doctor about what is appropriate for you. Everyone is different. Plus, the details of each pregnancy can differ. While continuing a reasonable program of physical activity and exercise during/after pregnancy often can be beneficial, some modification to exercise routines and exertion levels may be appropriate. Again, we recommend you discuss what is best for you with your doctor, and make sure your doctor knows what a Barry’s workout entails (running and weight training).\n\nIf you wish, you can freeze a membership for the duration of your pregnancy. We support you and when you are ready to come back to class postpartum, you can take it at your own pace. You know your body best and we are so impressed with our Mamas-to-be and new mamas in class.\n\nCan I bring my service animal or support animal into the studio?\n\nService Animals (any animal that has been trained to perform a service, such as a seeing eye dog) are allowed in the studio but due to class conditions (treadmills, heavy equipment, dark lighting, loud noises, and close proximity to other clients), service animals are not permitted in the Red Room during class. Please connect with your local studio team for additional assistance with accommodations for you and your service animal while you’re in class with us.\n\nSupport Animals (any animal that provides comfort and support to their owners but has not been trained to perform a specific task or service) are not permitted in the studio or in the Red Room at any time.\n\nCan I bring my phone into class with me?\n\nNo! It’s dangerous and distracting to others. We know how vital it can be to keep that phone with you, but please, for that hour you’re with us, pop it in a locked locker.\n\nDo you offer lockers at the studios? Yes! All locations (with the exception of The Hamptons) have personal lockers for your use, complete with built-in combination locks. Please note that Barry’s is not liable for any personal property you may bring with you into the studio so please be sure to lock your locker with a unique combination each and every time.\n\nHow old do I have to be to come to Barry’s?\n\nMinors 14 – 15 years old may participate in classes only with a parent or legal guardian present and attending the class. Minors 16 – 17 years old may participate in classes without a parent or guardian, but the parent or guardian must agree to these Terms on their behalf. No one under 14 years of age may take a Barry’s class.\n\nTo attend class in Germany, you must be 18.\n\nAre you thinking about opening a new Barry’s near me?\n\nUnless you’re on Mars, then probably! We have a team who are busy answering that very question at every waking moment — where should we open up next? If you think people would love Barry’s where you are, and you want to get involved in helping us determine if it makes sense, feel free to reach out to us on the Contact Us page.\n\nBECOME A GLOBAL BARRY’S PARTNER\n\nWhere can I find additional information?\n\nView our page Become A Global Barry’s Partner and check out our Franchisee Pitch Deck."
