        "text": "Blue Campaign is a national public awareness campaign designed to educate the public, law enforcement, and other industry partners to recognize the indicators of human trafficking, and how to appropriately respond to possible cases.\n\nBlue Campaign works closely with DHS Components to develop general awareness trainings, as well as specific educational resources to help reduce victimization within vulnerable populations.\n\nLocated within the DHS Center for Countering Human Trafficking, Blue Campaign leverages partnerships with the private sector, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), law enforcement, and state/local authorities to maximize national public engagement on anti-human trafficking efforts. Blue Campaignâ€™s educational awareness objectives consists of two foundational elements, prevention of human trafficking and protection of exploited persons."
