        "text": "Together we are partnering with Microsoft Rewards to help drive donations to Boys & Girls Clubs of America! When you join Microsoft Rewards, turn on Give with Bing and select BGCA as your nonprofit of choice, your Bing searches will earn points that are automatically turned into donations to BGCA.\n\nBGCA is committed to making a difference for kids everywhere. Focused on inclusion and equity, providing access to computers and a safe place to go a safe place with access to computers, our goal is to set kids up for success and to reach their full potential.\n\nYour impact through Give with Bing will help our kids and BGCA achieve those goals.\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft partnered with Boys & Girls Clubs of America to donate 1,725 new Xbox consoles to hard-hit communities to help drive awareness and education on the COVID-19 vaccine. Microsoft is committed to doing their part to encourage everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated and Microsoft is delighted to partner with Boys & Girls Clubs for this important cause. We can achieve anything together – it’s worth a shot!\n\nMicrosoft is proud to support the National Month of Action.\n\nAt Boys & Girls Clubs of America, we’re proud to partner with Microsoft to inspire young people across the nation, especially young women like Alsyiana, to realize their potential as big thinkers, coders, explorers, engineers and problem-solvers. They’re the faces of STEM’s future and we need them.\n\nAs part of Boys & Girls Clubs STEM initiative, the partnership with Microsoft has contributed to changing perceptions with Club youth – especially girls. Boys & Girls Clubs of America research shows Club members in twelfth grade are more than twice as likely to express interest in a STEM career compared to their peers nationally. The results are even more dramatic for female Club members in twelfth grade, who are more than three times as likely to express interest in a STEM career compared to peers nationally.\n\nAfterschool programs provide exposure to STEM activities and encourage participation in STEM-related career paths, particularly with youth who come from populations and communities that are underrepresented in STEM fields. They encourage participation through interesting, enjoyable activities that ignite interest and provide opportunities to try something new or practice what they’ve learned in school.\n\nThrough project-based learning environments, they offer activities that relate to real-world experiences, which are needed in STEM careers or jobs in any industry. Afterschool STEM programs also provide kids a safe, supportive place where they can be creative, fail, and persevere, enabling the development of youth’s social and emotional skills as well, which are critical to future success."
