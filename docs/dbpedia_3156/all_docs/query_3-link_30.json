        "text": "Originally established in 1990, the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics (Initiative) was re-established in 2021 through executive order by President Joe Biden, who expanded the Initiative’s scope to center on advancing educational equity and economic opportunity for Latino and Hispanic students, families, and communities. The nation’s future prosperity and global leadership across sectors is intrinsically tied to the success of Hispanic and Latino students, and their success is a priority of this Administration.\n\nEmail Sign-Up Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook\n\nNew Executive Order on HSIs White House Initiative and a President’s Board of Advisors for HSIs\n\nOn Wednesday, July 17, the Biden-Harris Administration announced the implementation of one of the most important recommendations approved by our President’s Advisory Commission on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed a new Executive Order (EO) establishing at the U.S. Department of Education, the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and a President’s Board of Advisors for HSIs.\n\nRead the new EO establishing the HSIs White House Initiative and a President’s Board of Advisors for HSIs, here.\n\nView the factsheet announcing the EO and additional actions, including action to expand TRIO college access programs to Dreamers, here.\n\nFollow our Initiative on this webpage, Facebook and X/Twitter for additional links and resources.\n\nSubmit public comment on the proposed rule to expand TRIO college access programs to Dreamers by August 23, 2024, here.\n\nShare statements of support from you/your organization by emailing whitehousehispanicinitiative@ed.gov and posting on social media, using the hashtag #WHLatinos and tagging @WhiteHouseHPI, @USEdGov, @SecCardona, @WhiteHouse and @LaCasaBlanca.\n\nPresident Biden’s EO marks a critical moment for the Hispanic community, which has been seeking this action for over twenty years. HSIs now number over 500 higher education campuses across the U.S. — educating over 55 percent of Latino students, 30 percent of all Pell grant recipients and more than 4.7 million students as a whole. This new EO is an important systemic action aimed at improving the federal government’s capacity to more intentionally address historic equity issues faced by HSIs, Latino students and educators.\n\nComplete the 2024-25 FAFSA Today\n\nComplete the 2024–25 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form today. The Better FAFSA is simplified, redesigned, and streamlined. It is faster and easier to fill out, with most students and families completing it in less than 15 minutes. It ensures 665,000 more students will receive Federal Pell Grants to pay for college. Additionally, more than 1.7 million more students will receive the maximum Pell Grant of $7,395. Completing and submitting the FAFSA form is free, and it gives students access to the largest source of financial aid to help pay for higher education.\n\n2024-25 FAFSA Guide for Parents and Contributors – Partner Guidance\n\nPlease use these English and Spanish fliers to help students and families complete the 2024-25 FAFSA form.\n\nCheck our Federal Student Aid Resources page for additional English and Spanish FAFSA resources.\n\nApply for the SAVE Plan\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration launched the most affordable repayment plan – the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan. The SAVE plan will cut many borrowers’ monthly payments to zero, will save other borrowers around $1,000 per year, will prevent balances from growing because of unpaid interest, and will get more borrowers closer to forgiveness faster. The Biden-Harris Administration estimates that over 20 million borrowers could benefit from the SAVE plan. On average, under the SAVE Plan, Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native borrowers will see their total lifetime payments per dollar borrowed cut in half.\n\nBorrowers, sign up today by visiting StudentAid.gov/SAVE\n\nPeer Review Opportunities with the U.S. Department of Education\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education announces opportunities for individuals to participate in its peer review process for competitive grant funding under the programs administered by the Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE); Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE); Office of English Language Acquisition (OELA); Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE); and Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS).Requests to serve as a peer reviewer for fiscal year 2023 will be accepted on an ongoing basis, aligned with this year’s grant competition schedule.
