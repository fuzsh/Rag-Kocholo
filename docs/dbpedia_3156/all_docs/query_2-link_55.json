        "text": "Jakarta, May 22, 2023 – In a significant step towards empowering youth in Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Microsoft have announced a transformative regional collaboration focused on supporting two million youth from underserved, underrepresented, and digitally excluded communities in Asia with AI fluency and skills for future development. The program aims to equip young people with skills they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving digital era and prepare for the future of work.\n\nThe announcement event, held in Jakarta, marked the beginning of a new chapter in the region's journey towards inclusive and sustainable development and bridging the digital opportunity divide. This collaboration is the beginning of a consortium-based approach to build a coalition of partners from various sectors to create skills development and employability opportunities for youth across Asia. It aims to create a thriving digital ecosystem that contributes to Asia's overall social and economic development.\n\nThrough this collaboration, both organizations seek to bridge the digital skills gap and provide equal opportunities for all youth to succeed. By equipping them with digital skills and fostering an environment conducive to innovation and digital transformation, this program can result in a transformative change in the lives of youths across the region, including in Indonesia.\n\nThe regional collaboration between UNDP and Microsoft will focus on digital skills training targeting students and unemployed or underemployed youths, access to technology and resources to ensure youths have the necessary tools to enhance their learning and capabilities, and digital talent and employment by including certification, project-based internships, and the number of employees as its KPIs.\n\nSeparately, Norimasa Shimomura, UNDP Indonesia Resident Representative highlighted, \"We are thrilled to explore this regional collaboration with Microsoft, which represents a crucial step forward in empowering Indonesian youth and more across Asia and the Pacific. With the rapid digital transformation taking place, acquiring digital skills has become imperative for youth empowerment and employability. By equipping them with the necessary tools and knowledge, we can unlock their potential and contribute to Indonesia's sustainable development.\"\n\nMike Yeh, Regional Vice President, Corporate, External and Legal Affairs for Microsoft in Asia, shares, \"Digital inclusion is crucial to ensuring equal opportunities for all, and this collaboration with UNDP reinforces our commitment to skills development and building a talented workforce across the region that is ready for the next wave of innovation that AI will bring. It's the first step in building a consortium of like-minded organizations who are investing in the next generation of youth leaders and entrepreneurs in the region, and we are excited to work alongside UNDP to leverage the opportunity for technology and AI to become the catalyst for inclusive growth and sustainable development in Asia.”\n\nThe collaboration between UNDP and Microsoft reflects a shared commitment to leveraging technology and innovation to address the challenges faced by youth. It signifies a milestone in the journey towards inclusive and sustainable development.\n\nLinda Restaningrum, Assistant Deputy for Youth Empowerment, Coordinating Ministry of Human Development and Cultural Affairs, reiterated, “The launch of the collaboration between UNDP and Microsoft is a strategic momentum for youth as future leaders to participate and improve their quality through increased digital literacy and capabilities. The involvement of youth is very much needed in development, because apart from being an object, youth must also be the actor or subject of development.”\n\nYoung people today are more connected, creative, informed, and persuasive than any previous generation. They are responding to the world's challenges with innovative approaches, contributing fresh ideas, creating the world they want, and driving human development for themselves, their communities, and societies. However, of the 660 million youth in Asia-Pacific (aged 15-24), 25 per cent (around 160 million) are not in employment, education, or training (NEET) and this number is growing. This has particularly been the case for the most marginalised youth, including those from the poorest backgrounds, women and girls, youth with disabilities, migrants and displaced youth, and indigenous youth.\n\nThis regional collaboration between UNDP and Microsoft focuses on three key areas: providing comprehensive digital skills training programs for youth, facilitating access to technology and resources, and fostering digital talent and employment opportunities. Through this partnership, high school and university students, unemployed and underemployed youth, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds will receive training to navigate the digital landscape effectively. Access to technology and online learning platforms will also be ensured, and efforts will be made to enhance the supply and demand for digital talent, including certification, project-based internships, and increased employment opportunities. This collaboration ultimately aims to decrease the unemployment rate in Indonesia and empower youth for the digital future.\n\nIndonesia, with its vibrant and dynamic youth population, holds immense potential for economic growth and social development. However, access to quality education and employment opportunities remains a challenge for many young individuals across the country. Furthermore, the digital divide exacerbates the existing disparities, making it essential to prioritize digital skills training to ensure inclusive growth and opportunities for all. As such, Indonesia is primely positioned to host the announcement of the regional collaboration as well as the pilot country for the proposed digital upskilling program under this collaboration.\n\nAs Beniam Gebrezghi, Programme Specialist for Civil Society & Youth, UNDP in Asia and the Pacific, also emphasized, \"The digital skills gap poses an obstacle for youth in realizing their full potential with 61% of students do not receive any digital literacy education in schools in surveyed ASEAN countries. This regional collaboration between Microsoft and UNDP will empower youth through digital skills and job-readiness training, and it is through digitalization and partnerships like these that UNDP strives for structural transformation, inclusivity, and resilience, ensuring that no one is left behind in benefiting from digital technology.”\n\nThe announcement saw participation of key stakeholders, including government officials, industry leaders, educators, youth representatives, and members of youth-led civil society organizations. Their presence underscored the shared commitment to advancing youth digital skills development in Indonesia and across Asia.\n\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\n\nUNDP Indonesia\n\nEnggi Dewanti\n\nCampaign Assistant for SDGs\n\nenggi.dewanti@undp.org\n\n+6285249388191\n\nRanda Sandhita\n\nYouth Engagement & Entrepreneurship Officer\n\nranda.sandhita@undp.org\n\n+628118884028\n\nUNDP The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is the leading United Nations organization working to end the injustices of poverty, inequality, and climate change.
