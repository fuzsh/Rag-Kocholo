        "text": "Newborn screening is a state public health program that reaches nearly 4 million babies born in the United States each year. Approximately, a quarter of a million of those babies are born in Florida. Newborns are screened for certain genetic, endocrine, hemoglobinopathy, immunology, and metabolic conditions. Screenings for hearing loss and critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) are completed prior to discharge from a hospital or birth facility. Florida screens for more than 55 conditions, including those recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services’ Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). If a baby’s newborn screen is abnormal, parents will be notified, and the Newborn Screening Follow-up Program will ensure access to diagnostic testing to confirm results.\n\nHealth care providers are the most trusted resource for information about newborn screening and are often responsible for collecting specimens for testing. Samples should be collected correctly for accurate results. Get the best samples the first time by following these step-by-step instructions.\n\nNewborn screening identifies potentially debilitating and life-threatening conditions within the first weeks of an infant’s life, giving children in Florida the best possibility for early interventions and care. A few drops of blood are drawn from the newborn’s heel 24 to 48 hours after birth, and tests for hearing loss and critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) are conducted before the newbornleaves the hospital. The hospital sends the blood sample to the Bureau of Public Health Laboratories in Jacksonville, which screens more than 1,000 blood samples per day. All results are sent to the hospital and forwarded to the newborn’s physician. Patient results are also available to health care providers through the Florida Newborn Screening Results (FNSR) website. If screening results are abnormal, the Newborn Screening Follow-Up Program, which is a part of the Division of Children’s Medical Services, will contact the parents and/or the newborn’s physician to arrange for additional testing to rule out or confirm initial findings."
