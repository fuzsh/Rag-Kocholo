        "text": "Effective Date: November 15, 2022\n\nNOTICE REGARDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION: THESE theSpotClub ® PROGRAM TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT GOVERN HOW CLAIMS YOU AND WE MAY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED (SEE PARAGRAPH 20 BELOW), INCLUDING AN AGREEMENT AND OBLIGATION TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES, WHICH WILL, SUBJECT TO LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE YOU TO SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING ARBITRATION, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 20(H). UNLESS YOU OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION: (A) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND (B) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO SEEK RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\n\nThank you for your interest in theSpotClub® program (\"theSpotClub® Program\" or the \" Program\"). theSpotClub® Program is a customer loyalty program offered by TPS Parking Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company d/b/a The Parking Spot (\"The Parking Spot,\" \" we\" or \"us\"), whereby qualifying theSpotClub® customers can use certain available discounts for parking and car care services at The Parking Spot facilities, earn and use Program points (\" Points\") and earn Program elite status and other Program benefits in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below. The following terms and conditions (the \"Program Terms and Conditions\") govern your participation in the Program. By setting up a theSpotClub® account (\"Account\"), signing in to your Account, registering your theSpotClub ® card or theSpotClub® Exec card to your Account, making a reservation on this website (the \"Website\") or certain of our mobile applications (the \"App(s)\"), when signed in to your Account, or otherwise using your registered or unregistered theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Program Terms and Conditions as well as our general Terms and Conditions located at https://www.theparkingspot.com/terms-and-conditions (the \"General Terms and Conditions\"), and that you agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to theSpotClub ® Program.\n\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE PROGRAM TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND THE GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT SET UP AN ACCOUNT, REGISTER OR USE YOUR REGISTERED OR UNREGISTERED theSpotClub® CARD OR theSpotClub ® EXEC CARD, SIGN IN TO YOUR ACCOUNT, MAKE A RESERVATION ON THE WEBSITE OR APP WHEN SIGNED IN TO YOUR ACCOUNT, OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE PROGRAM TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHEN YOU SET UP AN ACCOUNT AND REGISTER YOUR CARD TO THAT ACCOUNT, ANY POINTS THAT HAVE ACCUMULATED ON AN UNREGISTERED theSpotClub® CARD OR theSpotClub® EXEC CARD WILL NOT BE CREDITED TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REDEEM THOSE POINTS.\n\n1. Changes to or Cancellation of theSpotClub ® Program.\n\nThe Parking Spot reserves the right to change or cancel theSpotClub® Program, in whole or in part, at any time in our sole discretion, without notice or liability, even though such changes may, for example, affect the value, availability, use or redemption of Points, Program elite status, or other Program benefits already accumulated. Such changes or cancellation will be effective when posted on the Website. Such changes may include, without limitation, changes in the terms and conditions for: the accrual and award of Points, Program elite status, discounts or other Program benefits; the redemption of Points, discounts or other Program benefits; the issuance of award certificates and discounts; the redemption of award certificates, discounts and other Program benefits; and/or other aspects of the Program Terms and Conditions. Members, in accumulating Points, a particular Program status and/or other Program benefit, may not rely on the continued availability of such Points, award or Program elite status level, or other Program benefit.\n\nPlease review the Program Terms and Conditions periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes and are familiar with the most current version. Changes to the Program Terms and Conditions apply to all subsequent transactions and participation in the Program. For clarity, any change to or cancellation of these Program Terms and Conditions will apply to all persons who have created an Account, registered or otherwise used their registered or unregistered theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card (\"Members\"), even those who enrolled or participated in the Program before The Parking Spot made such a change or cancellation. If you do not agree to the updated Program Terms and Conditions, you must close your Account and must cease participation in the Program. Your continued participation in the Program, including without limitation continued use of your theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card, constitutes your agreement to the updated Program Terms and Conditions.\n\n2. Eligibility for Membership in theSpotClub ® Program.\n\nPersons who are at least 18 years of age are eligible for membership in theSpotClub® Program. By registering or otherwise using your theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card, you certify that you meet these requirements. If you do not meet these requirements you may not participate in the Program. To have Points credited to your Account and to be eligible to redeem or have access to Points, discounts or other Program benefits, a Member first must register his or her theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card to their Account. Membership in the Program may be prohibited or restricted in some countries. Nothing in these Program Terms and Conditions shall be read to override or circumvent such foreign laws.\n\n3. Registration of theSpotClub ® and theSpotClub ® Exec Cards.\n\nMembers can register their theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub ® Exec card on the Website and certain Apps. To register a card, you must provide certain information, including without limitation your first and last name, mailing address, telephone number, and a valid email address. An Account is created as a part of that registration process. By setting up an Account, registering your theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card on the Website or an App, or otherwise using your registered or unregistered theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card, you become a Member and acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these Program Terms and Conditions and the General Terms and Conditions . However, Points will not be credited to a Member's Account and cannot be redeemed for award certificates, and eligibility to access to other Program benefits and Program status will not occur unless and until the card on which the Points were accumulated has been registered by the Member on the Website or App to an Account the Member has set up. Furthermore, if you are a Member and your theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card is lost or stolen and that card was not registered, any Points that may have been accumulated using that unregistered card will not be credited to your Account and are forfeited, as are any other Program benefits or Program status that you may have been eligible to access by virtue of the accumulation of such Points if you had registered the card to your Account. The Parking Spot therefore encourages all Members to register their theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card as soon as possible following receipt.\n\nEach Member is responsible for remaining knowledgeable about their Account information, including, but not limited to, accumulated Points, redeemed Points, Program status, discounts and other Program benefits and eligibility, and the Program Terms and Conditions. You can find your Account information by logging in to your Account on the Website at www.theparkingspot.com.\n\n4. Accumulation of theSpotClub ® Program Points.\n\nAs a Member, you will accumulate Points on your card each time you pay for parking at a The Parking Spot facility if you present your theSpotClub ® card or theSpotClub® Exec card at the time of payment. However, Points will not be available for redemption and you will not be eligible for other Program benefits unless and until you have set up an Account and registered your card to your active Account.\n\nAs of February 3, 2020, you will receive four (4) Points for every dollar spent on parking services (\"Parking Dollars\") at The Parking Spot facilities, excluding all amounts paid for taxes or government or airport fees, car-care services and any other fees not directly attributable to parking services. For purposes of awarding Points, all Parking Dollars spent will be rounded to the nearest dollar. Parking Dollars shall not include the value of parking services paid for with award certificates or dollars spent on any cancelled, refunded, unused or fraudulent reservations, purchases or activities (as determined by The Parking Spot in its sole discretion).\n\nThe Parking Spot also may, in its sole discretion, from time to time, offer Members the opportunity to earn additional Points or other benefits through our own special offers and/or offers we may provide in connection with other providers of goods or services with whom we work or have agreements (\"Partners\"). These offers may be temporary in nature. The Parking Spot reserves the right to modify or eliminate such offers at any time. These offers are void where prohibited by law. The amount of Points offered under such programs and special offers is subject to the sole discretion of The Parking Spot and/or its Partners.\n\nWe also reserve the right to make bonus Points and promotional offers by The Parking Spot or its Partners selectively available to certain Members at any time based on parking activity, geographic location, Program status, Program participation, or any other factors determined in our sole discretion.\n\nThere may be some delay between eligible transactions completed using your registered theSpotClub card and the posting of Points to your Account. If any Points which you believe you have accumulated as provided herein are not credited to your Account and to request that such Points be credited, log in to your Account, then click on Account Settings. On the left side of your screen, select Missing Credits. Enter your ticket number in the text box that appears below the ticket graphic, entering only the digits that are highlighted in the graphic. Additional information and documentation may be requested to verify your request. Retroactive discounts will not be given\n\nThe activities and transactions eligible for earning Points and other Program benefits and/or the amount of Points or other Program benefits that can be earned are subject to change at any time by The Parking Spot in its sole discretion, without notice or liability.\n\n5. Elite Benefits\n\nBeginning on February 3, 2020, in addition to earning Points and enjoying other Program benefits that may be available to all Members, certain premium services, discounts and other Program benefits may be available to Members who qualify for Program elite status (\"Elite Benefits\").\n\nGold Benefits : Members with registered Accounts who during a calendar year (each, a \"Program Year\") (i) park at The Parking Spot facilities at least fifteen (15) days (excluding days paid for with award certificates), and (ii) accumulate 800 Points through parking services purchases (excluding Bonus Points or other Points deposited in Members’ Accounts as part of any special offer, promotion or as a bonus) will be considered Gold Program Members for that Program Year, and during such Program Year will be eligible to receive:\n\nEarn one bonus point per Parking Dollar, which shall be redeemable for award certificates, but not for the purposes of qualifying for Elite Benefits (\"Bonus Point\").\n\nOne (1) free day of parking awarded on their Program enrollment anniversary date (which is the date on which the Member registered their card to their Account).\n\nA discount on the advertised rate for car care services at The Parking Spot facilities where those services are offered and available.

Please note that any or all of the Program and Elite Benefits may be changed, suspended or terminated by The Parking Spot in whole or in part at any time in its sole discretion, without notice or liability.\n\n6. theSpotClub ® Exec Card.\n\nCompanies regularly negotiate corporate discounts with The Parking Spot for use by their employees (\"Participating Company(ies)\"). If your current employer is a Participating Company, you may be eligible for a theSpotClub ® Exec card, which may be pre-loaded with a specific discount that has been negotiated in advance by your Participating Company. To qualify to use that discount at one of our parking facilities, at the time of service you must present to The Parking Spot personnel your theSpotClub® Exec card and any other documentation required by The Parking Spot in its sole discretion. theSpotClub® Exec cards can be used only by an individual who is current employee of a Participating Company, and may not be used by the employee's friends or family members. You must cease use of a theSpotClub® Exec card once you are no longer an employee of a Participating Company.\n\n7. Reservations .\n\nYou may make a reservation on the Website or App to self park at The Parking Spot’s parking facility which you designate when making such reservation (the \"Facility\"), or to bring your vehicle to a Facility to valet park your vehicle in the location selected by The Parking Spot at the Facility or at a Storage Location (defined in Paragraph 8 below). If you are a Member, have set up an Account, or have a registered theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card, and you make a reservation when signed in to your Account on the Website or App, you can complete your reservation without paying The Parking Spot a reservation fee (the \"Reservation Fee\").All other reservations are subject to the Reservation Fee indicated on the Website or App at the time the reservation is made. Reservations made on a “Pay Now” basis are subject to additional terms available at www.theparkingspot.com/reservation-policy.\n\nAward Certificates.\n\nIf you have registered an Account and have registered your theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card to your Account, you may visit our Website or App to redeem the Points in your Account for award certificates for free days of parking at our parking facilities, provided that your Account has sufficient Points for the requested award certificate, and you continue to be a Member and have a registered Account both at the time you generate the award certificate and at the time that you use the award certificate to pay for parking services at our parking facilities.\n\nTo generate an award certificate you must redeem Points to make a reservation while logged in to your Account on the Website or App to self park or valet park your vehicle at a Facility. The Parking Spot will honor the reservation on the specified day and at the designated Facility if you arrive at the Facility at the designated check-in time. Please note that if you valet park your vehicle, it may be moved from the designated Facility to an off-site storage location (“Storage Location\") and moved back to the Facility upon or before your return to the Facility for which you made the reservation. We do not guarantee that a particular parking space, product type or the reserved service level requested in a reservation will be available. If we are unable to accommodate the reserved service level on the day for which you initially made the reservation when redeeming Points, you may be eligible to have the difference in Points re-deposited into your Account. We may request additional documentation and information in our sole discretion to verify your eligibility and to process such requests. If you do not use an award certificate on the day for which you initially made the reservation when redeeming Points, you may bring the award certificate to the Facility for use on another day, however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate you at any service level on that day. If you use an award certificate at the Facility for which you initially redeemed Points on any day other than the day for which you initially made the reservation when redeeming Points, but the service level at that Facility is not available or the effective applicable daily parking rate at that Facility on the alternate day is higher, you may be required to pay us the difference in price between the service level or the daily parking rate for which you redeemed Points and the actual service level or the applicable daily parking rate available at the Facility on the alternative day (if the available service level or the applicable parking rate for the Facility on the alternate day would have required the redemption of additional Points at the time the reservation was made and the award certificate was generated.)\n\nThe number of Points which must be redeemed for any particular award certificate is determined based upon the length of stay, the Facility location, and the service level that you are requesting for such award certificate, all as indicated on the Website or App when you redeem Points. You will be informed of the number of Points required for the free day of parking prior to completing the redemption transaction.\n\nAward certificates may be redeemed for one (1) or more full days during a single stay only, and must be surrendered at exit. Redemption of award certificates may be subject to additional restrictions and requirements set forth on the face of the award certificate. Award certificates are fully redeemed when surrendered. Award certificates are valid only for the length of stay, Facility, and service level specified on the award certificate.\n\n8. Transferability of Award Certificates.\n\nAward certificates are transferable only gratuitously, and are void if bartered or sold other than as may be expressly authorized and/or sponsored by The Parking Spot. Lost or stolen award certificates cannot be replaced if redeemed.\n\n9. No Transferability of theSpotClub ® Card and theSpotClub ® Exec Cards.\n\ntheSpotClub® cards and theSpotClub® Exec Cards are not transferable.\n\n10. Expiration of Points.\n\nPoints will expire, without notice, eighteen (18) months after the latest Account Activity relating to a registered theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card on which the Points were accumulated. Points accumulated using an unregistered theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card will expire, without notice, ninety (90) days after the latest Activity on the unregistered card on which such Points were accumulated. \"Activity\" includes registering your theSpotClub ® card or theSpotClub® Exec card, earning Points pursuant to Paragraph 4 above, making a reservation for parking services while signed in to your Account, or using award certificates to pay for parking services. If you have more than one card and believe that you may be accruing Points on more than one of those cards, please contact us by email at feedback@theparkingspot.com so that the Points being accumulated under those cards can be merged into one Account. You may be required to provide additional information and documentation, as required by The Parking Spot in its sole discretion, to verify and process your request.\n\nThe Points redeemed to generate an award certificate expire with the corresponding award certificate in accordance with Paragraph 12 below. If a Member closes their Account, or requests that we delete his or her required Account information from our systems (e.g. name, mailing address, email address or telephone number(s)), the Account and all Points in that Account will be terminated without further notice, and any previously issued Program award certificates that have not been used will immediately expire and be void. If you are expelled from the Program pursuant to Paragraph 13 below, we have the right to cancel some or all of the Points you have accumulated in our sole discretion. In addition, as noted in Paragraph 3 above, if a Member’s theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card is lost or stolen and that card was not registered, any Points that may have been accumulated with that unregistered card will not be credited to the Member’s Account and are forfeited.\n\n11. Expiration of Award Certificates; Use of Other Promotions.\n\nProgram award certificates expire six (6) months after the reserved check-in date shown on the face (or the electronic equivalent) of the award certificate, except if a Member closes their Account or otherwise requests that we delete their required Account information from our systems (e.g. name, mailing address, email address or telephone number(s)), in which case any previously issued and unused award certificates will immediately expire and be void. No additional coupons or discounts may be combined or used with an award certificate unless allowed by the Facility at which you are redeeming an award certificate, as determined in its sole discretion. The Points used to generate lost, stolen, or unused award certificates may not be re-deposited into your Account.\n\n12. Expulsion from the Program.\n\nMembers may be expelled from theSpotClub® Program for any violation of the Program Terms and Conditions, as determined in our sole discretion, including but not limited to the following:\n\nA. attempting to print or otherwise generate and redeem an award certificate with the same number more than once;\n\nB. bartering or selling an award certificate other than as may be expressly authorized and/or sponsored by The Parking Spot;\n\nC. transferring a theSpotClub® card or theSpotClub® Exec card;\n\nD. breaching the terms and conditions applicable to one of our parking facilities;\n\nE. circumventing or gaming our revenue control systems, or otherwise engaging in fraud, abuse, misrepresentation, illegal activity, or other improper conduct; or\n\nF. engaging in behavior that is offensive either to our employees or other guests at our parking facilities.\n\n13.
