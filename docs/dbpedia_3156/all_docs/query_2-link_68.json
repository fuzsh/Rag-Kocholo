        "text": "This week at the Microsoft Build conference in Seattle, Jeff Teper, President – Microsoft 365 Collaborative Apps and Platforms, showcased Highspot being one of the first companies to deliver direct integration with Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot for Sales to our customers. This builds on our longstanding partnership to expand the use cases and impact of generative AI (genAI). See below for what was announced.\n\nContinuing leadership in genAI\n\nToday’s showcase builds on previous announcements and collaboration between Highspot and Microsoft — and specifically our joint work to bring the power of genAI to every revenue team. Last fall at Spark ‘23, our annual customer conference, we announced a series of deeper integrations across the Microsoft ecosystem, including enhancements to our Dynamics 365 integration and new connections to Microsoft Teams and genAI tools from Microsoft Copilot. Our announcements at Build continue and accelerate our Microsoft integration roadmap.\n\nCopilot for Sales and Microsoft 365 integration highlights\n\nThese new integrations, broadly available in the coming weeks, bring incredible value to joint customers, unlocking the ability to:\n\nUnderstand buyer engagement: View all Highspot activity on an account within the Sales Copilot pane in Outlook for a full view into how buyers are engaging\n\nLaunch Digital Rooms directly from Outlook: Maintain a single source of truth for buyers with Highspot Digital Rooms, so reps can see the dedicated Digital Room for every opportunity within the Sales Copilot pane in Outlook\n\nLeverage Highspot Search: See Highspot search results and relevant content directly through Copilot for M365\n\nIn addition to bringing Copilot together with critical resources and buyer insight from Highspot, we’ve continued to expand our integration across the Microsoft portfolio to give every customer-facing team the ability to harness the full power of Highspot’s revenue enablement platform.\n\nRecently, Highspot added support to automatically relate sellers’ shared content from Highspot Digital Rooms to records in Dynamics 365 with AI-driven inferencing. This will deliver a more accurate, and more complete picture of the influenced revenue for content, sales plays, and key initiatives without requiring manual input from sellers. We’ve also continued to expand the functionality of Highspot Copilot, the AI-powered digital assistant for revenue teams, built on Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI, providing a secure, enterprise-class engine for genAI functionality across the Highspot platform.\n\nWhat’s Next?"
