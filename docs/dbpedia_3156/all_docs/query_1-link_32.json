        "text": "What Are Social Security-Related Scams?\n\nCriminals continue to impersonate SSA and other government agencies in an attempt to obtain personal information or money.\n\nScammers might call, email, text, write, or message you on social media claiming to be from the Social Security Administration or the Office of the Inspector General. They might use the name of a person who really works there and might send a picture or attachment as “proof.”\n\nSocial Security employees do contact the public by telephone for business purposes. Ordinarily, the agency calls people who have recently applied for a Social Security benefit, are already receiving payments and require an update to their record, or have requested a phone call from the agency. If there is a problem with a person’s Social Security number or record, Social Security will typically mail a letter.\n\nFour Basic Signs of a Scam\n\nRecognizing the signs of a scam gives you the power to ignore criminals and report the scam.\n\nScams come in many varieties, but they all work the same way:\n\nScammers pretend to be from an agency or organization you know to gain your trust.\n\nScammers say there is a problem or a prize.\n\nScammers pressure you to act immediately.\n\nScammers tell you to pay in a specific way.\n\nKnown Tactics Scammers Use\n\nScammers frequently change their approach with new tactics and messages to trick people. We encourage you to stay up to date on the latest news and advisories by following SSA OIG on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook or subscribing to receive email alerts.\n\nThese are red flags; you can trust that Social Security will never\n\nThreaten you with arrest or legal action because you don’t agree to pay money immediately.\n\nSuspend your Social Security number.\n\nClaim to need personal information or payment to activate a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) or other benefit increase.\n\nPressure you to take immediate action, including sharing personal information.\n\nAsk you to pay with gift cards, prepaid debit cards, wire transfers, cryptocurrency, or by mailing cash.\n\nThreaten to seize your bank account.\n\nOffer to move your money to a “protected” bank account.\n\nDemand secrecy.\n\nDirect message you on social media.\n\nBe skeptical and look for red flags. If you receive a suspicious call, text message, email, letter, or message on social media, the caller or sender may not be who they say they are. Scammers have also been known to:\n\nUse legitimate names of Office of Inspector General or Social Security Administration employees.\n\n“Spoof” official government phone numbers, or even numbers for local police departments.\n\nSend official-looking documents by U.S. mail or attachments through email, text, or social media message.\n\nFraudsters create imposter social media pages and accounts using Social Security-related images and jargon. This helps them appear as if they’re associated with or endorsed by Social Security. The imposter pages could be for the agency or Social Security and OIG officials. The user is asked to send their financial information, Social Security number, or other sensitive information. Social Security will never ask for sensitive information through social media as these channels are not secure.\n\nHere are some ways to spot an imposter page:\n\nNumber of followers.\n\nIncorrect punctuation or spelling.\n\nLinks to pages not on ssa.gov.\n\nAdvertisements for forms or other SSA documents.\n\nIncorrect social media handle. To view the list of Social Security’s official social media channels, we encourage you to visit www.ssa.gov/socialmedia\n\nIt is illegal to reproduce federal employee credentials and federal law enforcement badges. Federal law enforcement will never send photographs of credentials or badges to demand any kind of payment, and neither will federal government employees.\n\nReport the scam.\n\nNote—Scammers are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an additional tactic to trick people. You may find more information regarding AI Scams from the Senate Special Committee on Aging’s brochure, “Emerging Threat: Artificial Intelligence”.\n\nHow to Avoid a Scam\n\nProtect yourself, friends, and family — If you receive a suspicious call, text, email, social media message, or letter from someone claiming to be from Social Security:\n\nRemain calm. If you receive a communication that causes a strong emotional response, take a deep breath. Talk to someone you trust.\n\nHang up or ignore the message. Do not click on links or attachments.\n\nProtect your money. Scammers will insist that you pay with a gift card, prepaid debit card, cryptocurrency, wire transfer, money transfer, or by mailing cash. Scammers use these forms of payment because they are hard to trace.\n\nProtect your personal information. Be cautious of any contact claiming to be from a government agency or law enforcement telling you about a problem you don’t recognize, even if the caller has some of your personal information.\n\nSpread the word to protect your community from scammers.\n\nReport the scam to the Office of the Inspector General at oig.ssa.gov/report.\n\nHow to Report\n\nWhen you report a scam, you are providing us with powerful data that we use to inform others, identify trends, refine strategies, and take legal action against the criminals behind these scam activities.\n\nReport a scam\n\nIf you are unsure about the type of scam, but want to report it, visit USA.gov’s Where To Report a Scam. The tool will help you to find the right place to report a scam.\n\nWhat to Do if You Were Scammed\n\nRecovering from a scam can be a long and difficult process. Here are some reminders:\n\nDo not blame yourself. Criminal behavior is not your fault.\n\nStop contact with the scammer. Do not talk to them or respond to their messages.\n\nNotify the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion to add a fraud alert to your credit report.\n\nProtect your Social Security Number.\n\nRequest a replacement SSN card or new SSN, if necessary.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission’s “What To Do if You Were Scammed” article has information about what to do if you paid someone you think is a scammer or gave a scammer your personal information or access to your computer or phone.\n\nAdditionally, the Federal Trade Commission provides assistance in multiple languages. The Federal Trade Commission’s “New Help for Spotting, Avoiding, and Reporting Scams in Multiple Language” and “Consumer Education in Multiple Languages” has information about reporting and avoiding scams in your preferred language.\n\nHelp Us “Slam the Scam”!\n\nPlease visit our Resources page for more information on how you can help us “Slam the Scam”."
