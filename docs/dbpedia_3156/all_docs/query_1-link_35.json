        "text": "SPDES Program Overview\n\nNew York is rich in surface and groundwater resources. Article 17 titled \"Water Pollution Control\" of the 6 NYCRR PART 750 Environmental Conservation Law (ECL) was enacted to protect and maintain these valuable resources. Article 17 authorized creation of the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) program to maintain New York's waters with reasonable standards of purity.\n\nThe SPDES program is designed to eliminate the pollution of New York waters and to maintain the highest quality of water possible, consistent with:\n\nPublic health.\n\nPublic enjoyment of the resource.\n\nProtection and propagation of fish and wildlife.\n\nIndustrial development in the state.\n\nNew York's SPDES program has been approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the control of surface wastewater and stormwater discharges in accordance with the Clean Water Act; however, the SPDES program is broader in scope than that required by the Clean Water Act as it controls point source discharges to groundwaters as well as surface waters.\n\nConditions applicable to all SPDES permits\n\nStormwater information\n\nDetermine if you need a permit\n\nRegulated Activities\n\nNew York State law requires a permit for:\n\nConstructing or using an outlet or discharge pipe (referred to as a \"point source\") that discharges wastewater into the surface waters or ground waters of the state.\n\nConstructing or operating a disposal system such as a sewage treatment plant.\n\nPermits are also required for modifying, transferring, and renewing your permit. See details below.\n\nDo Not Start a Project Before Obtaining a Permit\n\nYou must obtain all necessary permits before commencing work on a project that requires any DEC permit. Persons commencing work on such a project before obtaining the required permits, and any contractors engaged in such work, are subject to enforcement action by the DEC. Such action may include:\n\nCivil or criminal court action, or both;\n\nfines; or\n\nan order to remove structures or materials or perform other remedial action, or both a fine and an order.\n\nExempt Activities\n\nNo SPDES permit is required for a facility whose treatment system has a design flow of total discharges to ground water of less than 1,000 gallons per day of sewage-wastewater containing no industrial or other non-sewage wastes; however, these discharges may require approval from the appropriate city health department, county health department, or district office of the New York State Department of Health before a system (cesspool, septic system, etc.) can be built. They may also require other DEC permits or approvals from other agencies.\n\nIs this project Major or Minor?\n\nMinor SPDES projects:\n\ndischarges of less than 10,000 gallons per day of sewage effluent, without the admixture of industrial wastes or other wastes, to ground water. Such projects may qualify for the P/C/I SPDES General Permit GP-0-15-001.\n\nAll Other SPDES Projects are Major.\n\nApplication of Standards, Limitations, and Other Requirements\n\nSPDES permits must meet all applicable water quality standards and effluent limitations. DEC regulations, 6 NYCRR Section 750-1.11(a), provide a list of standards, limitations, and other requirements.\n\nModifying Your Permit\n\nRequests for permit modifications must be submitted by the permittee for facility modifications or expansions, process modifications, or production modifications. Typical modifications are:\n\nAny increase in the volume of the wastewater.\n\nAny change in the limitations on the contaminants in the wastewater effluent.\n\nAny change in the location of the discharge point.\n\nAny change from a discharge underground to a surface discharge, or from a surface discharge to an underground discharge.\n\nAny change in the type of treatment of the wastewater.\n\nA request for any of these modifications must include the appropriate application form, supporting documents, and an Environmental Assessment Form (EAF). The requested modifications must not be undertaken prior to receiving DEC's authorization.\n\nBe sure to include your previous DEC permit number and your SPDES number (e.g., NY-0100001) in your correspondence.\n\nSubmit your modification request as early as possible. In most cases, modification requests submitted within 6 months (180 days) of an existing permit's expiration date will be combined with your renewal application for processing. Renewal applications are due 6 months before permit expiration.\n\nContact the regional permit administrator if you have questions concerning your particular modification.\n\nTransferring Your Permit\n\nA change in facility ownership or a change in permittee name are types of permit modifications. These require an Application for Permit Transfer (PDF).\n\nThe Application for Permit Transfer requires certifications by both the proposed new owner/operator and the present permittee, and it should be submitted 30 days prior to transfer.\n\nBe sure to include your previous DEC permit number and your SPDES number (e.g., NY-0100001) in your correspondence.\n\nContact the regional permit administrator if you have questions concerning a permit transfer.\n\nRenewing Your Permit\n\nSPDES permits for discharges to surface waters are typically issued for up to five years; and permits for discharges to ground waters are typically issued for up to ten years.\n\nA complete renewal application must be submitted at least 180 days prior to the permit's expiration date. DEC will attempt to mail a renewal application form to the permittee of record several months in advance of the expiration date of the permit so it can be submitted in time.\n\nThe permittee is responsible for submitting a timely renewal application regardless of whether DEC sent you a renewal application. If you have not received a renewal application, please contact:\n\nNYS Department of Environmental Conservation\n\nDivision of Water\n\nBureau of Water Permits\n\n625 Broadway\n\nAlbany, NY 12233-3505\n\nTelephone: (518) 402-8111\n\nPermit renewals, modifications presentation (PDF)\n\nExisting Permits\n\nDECinfo Locator (leaves DEC website) is an interactive map that lets you access DEC documents and public data about the environmental quality of specific sites in New York State. To view current SPDES permits, select the type(s) of wastewater facilities (wastewater, MSGP, CSO, etc.) you are interested in on the Permits and Registrations layer.\n\nThis website is intended to enable interested parties to view and print Multi-Sector General (MSGP) Permit documents (leaves DEC website) as PDFs. There is a Readme file and two Index files to assist the users in locating the permits and documents that they are looking for. Please read the Readme file first before you begin your search.\n\nDraft Permits\n\nDraft SPDES permits are announced in the Environmental Notice Bulletin during the public comment period. Draft SPDES permits publicly noticed on or after May 11, 2022, are posted on DECinfo Locator. Draft SPDES permits publicly noticed prior to May 11, 2022, (leaves DEC website) can be viewed on this website and are in the Draft SPDES Permits folder, listed in order by facility name. Please use the ReadMe file on this site to help you locate the files you are interested in. All questions and comments about the draft permits should be addressed to the contact person provided on the Environmental Notice Bulletin and Newspaper public notice and sent to the regional permit administrator.\n\nAnnual Fees For SPDES Permits\n\nWhile no application fees are charged for review of permit applications, the Department assesses permittees for annual Environmental Regulatory Program Fees based on the type of facility, the type of authorization, and the discharge volume. In accordance with Article 72, Title 6 of the Environmental Conservation Law, fees for SPDES permits are:\n\nTable 1 for SPDES General Permit FeesTypeFees (per year)MSGP$110Aquatic Pesticides General Permit$110PCI (to groundwater)$110CAFO (Medium or Large)$50Construction$110Construction - one time initial authorization fee$110 per disturbed acre and\n\n$675 per future impervious acre\n\nTable 2 for SPDES Individual Permit Fees\n\nCapacityFee (per year)IndustrialLess than 10,000 gpd$67510,000 - 99,999 gpd$2,300100,000 - 499,999 gpd$6,700500,000 - 999,999 gpd$22,5001,000,000 - 9,999,999 gpd$33,50010,000,000 gpd or more$56,000MunicipalLess than 200,000 gpd$425200,000 - 999,999 gpd$2,0001,000,000 - 4,999,999 gpd$8,0005,000,000 - 39,999,999 gpd$15,50040,000,000 gpd or more$38,500Private/Commercial/\n\nInstitutional (PCI)Less than 100,000 gpd$330100,000 gpd or more$675Power Plantany size$56,000Ballast DischargersLess than 1,000,000 gals.\n\nin any 24 hr. period$1001,000,000 gals. or more\n\nin any 24 hr. period$500\n\nDisclaimer: When the fees indicated in the DEC regulations or the above table are not consistent with those contained in the ECL, the annual fees indicated in the ECL shall prevail.\n\n2024 SPDES Priority Ranking List\n\nDEC is providing the Environmental Benefit Permit Strategy (EBPS) priority rankings list (PDF) in conformance with section 17-0817(6) of the ECL. The lists are based on a ranking system that prioritizes individual permits for full technical review and, when necessary, modification. Scoring data for each individual permit in the EBPS lists is available in the EBPS scoring details (PDF) document.\n\nFor additional information on EBPS, please refer to TOGS 1.2.2 or this brief EBPS Overview (PDF).\n\nDesign Standards and Engineering Reports\n\nEngineering Report Outline and Engineering Forms\n\nThis Engineering Report Outline (PDF) describes the requirements for SPDES engineering report submittals that should be followed by all types of discharges and must be followed when a facility receives funding through the Environmental Facilities Corporation.\n\nEngineering reports shall be prepared, stamped, and dated by a New York State-registered Professional Engineer and developed in accordance with the latest editions of the following standards whenever practicable and as appropriate:\n\nRecommended Standards for Wastewater Facilities - Policies for the Design, Review, and Approval of Plans and Specifications for Wastewater Collection and Treatment Facilities (commonly known as the Ten States Standards).\n\nTR-16 Guides for the Design of Wastewater Treatment Works - New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission.\n\nNew York State Stormwater Management Design Manual.\n\nNew York State Design Standards for Intermediate Sized Wastewater Treatment Systems Statewide and Lake George Design Standards.\n\n6 NYCRR Part 750-2.10.\n\nIntermediate Design Standards (2014)\n\nThe 2014 New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Design Standards for Intermediate-sized Wastewater Treatment Systems (PDF) (Intermediate Design Standards) provide wastewater treatment system design professionals, owners and operators, and regulators guidance on design, operation, and maintenance of intermediate-sized wastewater treatment facilities. This manual is a reference for both the Private/Commercial/Institutional SPDES General Permit, as well as individual permits for sanitary waste. These systems serve:\n\nMedium sized facilities discharging to surface and ground waters;\n\nCluster housing and other multi-home developments; and\n\nPublicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) that discharge to groundwater.\n\nExcluded are residential systems (individual home septic systems), large POTWs, and industrial facilities.\n\nThe Intermediate Design Standards provide design criteria for building wastewater treatment systems that protect the water quality of groundwater and surface water, aid designers in the preparation of complete project submissions (map, plan, and report), and improve the efficiency of project review by regulatory agencies. It is intended to incorporate newer technology for the onsite or near-site treatment of wastewater, as well as provide more design and installation guidance for wastewater treatment facilities. These developments have arisen from special needs, including the replacement of failing systems on limited-sized sites, lighter-weight construction materials, lower-cost sewage collection and treatment for remote or isolated locations, and special considerations for environmentally sensitive areas.\n\nLake George Design Standards for Wastewater Treatment Systems (2015)\n\nThe 2015 Design Standards for Wastewater Treatment Systems in the Lake George Basin (PDF) are only applicable in the Lake George Basin for treated sanitary sewage discharging to groundwater without admixture of industrial wastes.\n\nWastewater Treatment Upgrades, Expansions, and Planning\n\nPlanning to upgrade, expand, or build a new wastewater treatment plant in New York State? Below are a few questions to consider before submitting a SPDES application. These guiding points will help to navigate potential changes in an individual SPDES permit and can aid in the decision making and design planning process.\n\nEnsure the regional permit administrator has been contacted about the project. Additional permits may be needed and may impact project timeline.\n\nIdentify the facility's receiving water and any present impairments or Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). The classification of the receiving water impacts the applicable water quality standards. TMDLs and impairments are incorporated into permit limitations.\n\nFacilities that discharge near environmentally sensitive areas such as bathing beaches, drinking water intakes, and areas with sensitive species may have limitations.\n\nDetermine if the planned upgrades or expansion of the facility will impact the facility's influent waste stream's characteristics. If new waste streams are anticipated, these parameters will need to be evaluated. Expanded flows may reduce available dilution.\n\nEnsure the present or future treatment technology can adequately treat for pollutants present in the discharge. This can be helpful in developing the Schedule of Compliance to meet new limitations.\n\nGiven the facility's outfall and receiving waters, identify the available dilution. Dilution impacts the assimilative capacity and ultimately, the water-quality based effluent limits.\n\nNear-by POTWs may have capacity to accept the waste stream, eliminating the need for a direct discharge.\n\nDomestic wastewater contains nutrients. Ponded waterbodies are more susceptible to phosphorus and nitrogen impacts. Consider the receiving waters' assimilative capacity for these nutrients.\n\nA POTW will need to revise the Sewer Use Law if a pretreatment program is required.\n\nBelow are resources that may help during design consideration.\n\nResources for Publicly Owned Treatment Works\n\nTechnology Based Effluent Limitations for POTWs: TOGS 1.3.3\n\nResources for Industries\n\nTechnology Based Effluent Limitations for industrial facilities: TOGS 1.2.1Effluent limitation guidelines and standards for industrial facilities: 40 CFR Chapter I Subchapter N\n\nResources for All Dischargers\n\nTo learn more about the environment in your area such as receiving water classification, waterbody impairments, and endangered species visit:\n\nDECinfo Locator\n\nClassifications and Standards of Quality and Purity: 6 NYCRR X A\n\nEndangered and Threatened Species: DEC Environmental Resource Mapper\n\nTo learn about applicable Water Quality Standards:\n\nSurface Water and Groundwater Quality Standards and Groundwater Effluent Limitations: 6 NYCRR 703.2, 703.3, 703.4, 703.5, 703.6\n\nAmbient Water Quality Standards and Guidance Values and Groundwater Effluent Limitations: TOGS 1.1.1\n\nTo learn about Water Quality Based Effluent Limits:\n\nTotal Maximum Daily Loads & Water Quality Based Effluent Limits: TOGS 1.3.1\n\nUSGS StreamStats: StreamStats Application (leaves DEC website)\n\nUSGS SWToolbox: USGS SWToolbox Software, Instructions\n\nUSGS Low-Flow Frequency Analysis of Streams in New York: Bulletin 74\n\nTo learn about waterbody impairments and Total Maximum Daily Loads:\n\nNYS Section 303(d) List of Impaired/TMDL Waters: 303(d) List\n\nClean Water Plans: Clean Water Plans and Total Maximum Daily Load Plans\n\nTo learn about Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing and Water Treatment Chemicals:\n\nAcute and Chronic Toxicity Testing in the SPDES Permit Program: TOGS 1.3.2\n\nWater Treatment Chemical Notification Forms: Water Treatment Chemicals\n\nTo learn about pollutant-specific limitations:\n\nPhosphorus Removal Requirements to Wastewater Discharges to Lakes & Lake Watersheds: TOGS 1.3.6\n\nMercury Guidance: TOGS 1.3.10\n\nBelow are helpful presentations on individual SPDES permit development."
