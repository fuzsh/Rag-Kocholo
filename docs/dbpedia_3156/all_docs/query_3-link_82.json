        "text": "Who should attend?\n\nIndividuals with disabilities and/or their family members\n\nEducators, including special education teachers and school administrators\n\nPublic and private rehabilitation personnel\n\nEmployers, human resource specialists and accommodation specialists\n\nADA and Section 508 administrators for universities and colleges\n\nAssistive and information technology specialists\n\nOccupational therapists, physical therapists and speech and language pathologists\n\nWhat should participants expect to learn?\n\nThe Assistive Technology Applications Certificate Program (ATACP) provides a practical approach to the applications of assistive technology to meet the needs of individuals with various disabilities in many settings.\n\nLearning objectives for the participants are the following:\n\nA wide range of applications for assistive technology in the home, school, workplace and community environments\n\nAddressing individual needs through a collaborative team approach and a national assessment framework\n\nExisting and new assistive technology for people with disabilities, including, but not limited to, augmentative and alternative communication, environmental controls, seating and positioning, mobility devices, ergonomics, computer access technology, and technology for people with learning, physical, cognitive and/or sensory disabilities\n\nResources to support assistive technology devices and services\n\nCertificate and Continuing Education Units (CEUs)\n\nATACP meets the 100-hour requirement for a certificate in assistive technology applications with 10 CEUs from California State University, Northridge's Tseng College of Extended Learning and the Center on Disabilities.\n\nHow is ATACP delivered?\n\nATACP is offered three times per year — Fall, Spring and Summer. All sessions are offered entirely online. The course is not self-paced and includes both synchronous and asynchronous components, including readings, written assignments, group discussions, and live lectures. The curriculum and content of all three sessions is identical.\n\nThe Assistive Technology Applications Certificate Program (ATACP) meets the 100-hour requirement to earn a certificate in assistive technology applications and 10 Continuing Education Units (CEUs) from the CSUN Center on Disabilities and the CSUN Tseng College.\n\nThe 16-week course covers a range of topics, divided into 10 Modules. The topics are described below:\n\nCourse Description\n\nCourse Module and Description Topic Description\n\nIndividuals interested in the certificate program must complete an application form; applications are accepted year-round. Notices of enrollment during designated enrollment periods for each session will be sent via email to all individuals who have submitted an application. *Space is limited in each of the Assistive Technology Applications Certificate Program (ATACP) sessions and early enrollment is strongly encouraged to ensure availability.\n\nEach participant will receive access to the comprehensive online course that includes reading materials, written assignments, group activities, discussion forums and live lectures. The course combines both synchronous and asynchronous components, and follows a session schedule with due dates. This is not a self-paced program.\n\nThe course is offered on an e-learning platform that provides a virtual classroom. While the course is delivered online, it does mimic an in-person classroom. Users of JAWS or other screen readers can access the course and should be knowledgeable on using personal hardware and software. In order to access the course, participants must have an active email account and access to the Internet. Internet access must not be intermittent. Do not enroll in a session during which you anticipate long periods of absence. Computer speakers and microphone are preferred, but not required.\n\nCertificate and Continuing Education Unit (CEU) requirements\n\nATACP students must complete the required course work with a passing grade of B- or higher to earn the certificate. Certificates are issued approximately 4-8 weeks after the completion of the session. Please note that grades are not printed on the certificate. Students who earn the certificate automatically earn the 10 CEUs which are printed on the certificate. The CEUs are general CSUN CEUs and if a student would like to apply those CEUs towards any particular organization or association, it is up to the student to coordinate that directly with the independent party. Students can also order transcripts of their participation in the certificate program. Transcripts are normally available for order from CSUN Admissions & Records about 4-8 weeks after the completion of the session.\n\nTotal fee to enroll is $1,895.\n\nThe fee includes the cost for instruction, reading materials (included in the course), technology fees, and certificate. There are no additional costs to participate.\n\nPayment is due by the enrollment deadline (see the Upcoming Sessions tab for more details) in order to secure a spot. All prospective students who have submitted an application will receive detailed enrollment instructions and payment information at the start of each session's enrollment period.\n\nPayment\n\nCredit card is the only accepted form of payment. All major credit cards accepted, except Discover. Checks and purchase orders will be returned and will not secure a spot in the session. Prospective students must complete the application form prior to making payment. If payment is made without a submitted application, the enrollment will be cancelled and subject to a $100 processing fee.\n\nRefund policy\n\nAnyone that opts to cancel their enrollment is eligible for a partial refund of $1,445, only if the request is received in writing, by the session's enrollment deadline. No refunds will be made thereafter; no exceptions. Once enrolled, students cannot defer their enrollment to a future session or transfer their enrollment to another person.\n\nThe Assistive Technology Applications Certificate Program (ATACP) is offered three times per year: Fall, Spring, and Summer. Application forms are accepted on a rolling basis and we encourage those interested in the program to complete an application at any time, in order to receive communications regarding each upcoming session.\n\nA submitted application does not enroll a person into a session. Enrollment details and instructions are emailed, ahead of each enrollment period, to anyone that has completed the form. If you are interested in enrolling in a future session, be sure to complete the application early in the enrollment period or even before it begins. Enrollment concludes at the stated deadline.\n\nSession Dates\n\nSession Dates and Enrollment Deadline Session Session Dates Enrollment Period Summer 2024 May 6 to August 23, 2024 Closed Fall 2024 August 26 to December 13, 2024 Closed Spring 2025 January 13 to May 2, 2025 November 18 to December 6, 2024 at 3:00 PM PDT Summer 2025 May 5 to August 22, 2025 March 24 to April 11, 2025 at 3:00 PM PDT Fall 2025 August 25 to December 12, 2025 July 7 to July 25, 2025 at 3:00 PM PDT Spring 2026 January 12 to May 1, 2026 November 17 to November 5, 2026 at 3:00 PM PDT Summer 2026 May 4 to August 21, 2026 March 23 to April 10, 2026 at 3:00 PM PDT Fall 2026 August 24 to December 11, 2026 July 6 to July 24, 2026 at 3:00 PM PDT\n\nThank you for your interest in the Assistive Technology Applications Certificate Program (ATACP).
