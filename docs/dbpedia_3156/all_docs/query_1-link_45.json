        "text": "If you can’t enroll at all...\n\nIs enrollment open for your program? Double-check the Academic Calendar for date and time of enrollment open.\n\nDo you have an enrollment hold? If you do, it will be displayed on your Axess home page in the Holds, To Do's and Notifications section. Click on the hold for additional details. There’s typically an action you’ll need to take to remove the enrollment hold.\n\nAre you on a Leave of Absence? Is your student status discontinued? If so, you won’t be able to enroll. You can find pertinent resources here.\n\nIf the enrollment tool isn’t working as expected...\n\nHere are the basic troubleshooting steps:\n\nStep 1: CRITICAL: Remove any remaining \"planned\" classes. Sometimes these class picks can interfere with new enrollment.\n\nStep 2: CRITICAL: Axess is notoriously cache-sensitive. After clearing your planned classes, clear your browser cache, close your browser completely, and retry Axess.\n\nStep 3: Try the other enrollment tool. If steps 1 and 2 didn’t help, remember that you have two enrollment tools: SimpleEnroll and Enroll (Alternate). If SimpleEnroll isn’t working as expected, try Enroll (Alternate) (or vice versa). See below for how-to links:\n\nHow to Use SimpleEnroll\n\nHow to use Enroll (Alternate)\n\nIf you can’t enroll in a specific class...\n\nIt looks like there should be space in the class. Why won’t the system allow me to enroll?\n\nIn a “combined section” class, the overall enrollment cap is fed by multiple sections. When you review the real-time enrollment data for a single section, it may look as if there are spaces available. However, if you try to enroll and the system indicates that the course is full, it’s because those spaces are actually filled by students enrolling in the course’s other “combined section(s).” You may need to add yourself to the waitlist, or choose another class.\n\nHow does the waitlist process work?\n\nThe waitlist can't enroll you if you have a time conflict, or if adding the class would exceed the maximum allowable units (i.e., 20 units for undergraduates).\n\nWhen you're initially enrolling onto a waitlist, you can avoid these problems by designating your existing class as a \"drop if enrolled\" class at the time when you enroll onto the waitlist. With the \"drop if enrolled\" class designation, you will be eligible to be enrolled off the waitlist into your desired class and simultaneously dropped from your conflicting class.\n\nThe waitlist process is typically run twice a day, and the system will send an email letting you know whether it was able to enroll you. If there was no spot for you, the system will alert you that you have not been enrolled.\n\nPlease note that when the waitlist is between processes, if other students drop the course, it can appear as if there are spaces in the class. However, you may not be able to add to the class roster because the system is waiting to run the waitlist. If there is space available on the waitlist, you may instead add yourself to the waitlist.\n\nWhat if I’m on the waitlist but have a time conflict?\n\nThe waitlist process is typically run twice a day, and the system will send an email letting you know whether it was able to enroll you. If there was no spot for you, the system will alert you that you have not been enrolled.\n\nEven if a spot opens up, the system cannot enroll you from the waitlist if you have a time conflict with another course. Despite the auto messaging, there is no way to “override the time conflict.”\n\nIf you have a time conflict, you may drop the time-conflict course, wait to be enrolled from the waitlist if a spot opens up, and then re-enroll in the course you dropped.\n\nPlease note, in the future you can avoid this issue by designating your existing class as a \"drop if enrolled\" class at the time when you enroll onto the waitlist. With the \"drop if enrolled\" class designation, you will be eligible to be enrolled off the waitlist into your desired class and simultaneously dropped from your conflicting class.\n\nWhat if I’m on the waitlist but at the max unit limit?\n\nThe waitlist process is typically run twice a day, and the system will send an email letting you know whether it was able to enroll you. If there was no spot for you, the system will alert you that you have not been enrolled.\n\nEven if a spot opens up, the system cannot enroll you from the waitlist if this would put you over the max unit limit.\n\nYou may drop another class to reduce your overall credit load, then wait to be enrolled from the waitlist if a spot opens up.\n\nPlease note, in the future you can avoid this issue by designating your existing class as a \"drop if enrolled\" class at the time when you enroll onto the waitlist. With the \"drop if enrolled\" class designation, you will be eligible to be enrolled off the waitlist into your desired class and simultaneously dropped from your conflicting class.\n\nWhy doesn’t my permission number work?\n\nEach permission number pertains to a specific class in a specific quarter, and is valid for only one use. For example, if you enrolled in the course using a valid permission number but then dropped the class, you won’t be able to use that same number to re-enroll. Or, if the permission number pertains to that specific class – but for a prior quarter – it won’t allow you to enroll. Or, if the permission number pertains to another section of a \"combined section\" class – but not to the section you’re trying to enroll – it won’t work.\n\nIf your permission number is not working, you’ll need to contact the professor/department who gave it to you in order to request a new permission number that is linked to the specific course and valid for this specific term.\n\nI’m an undergraduate student, is there any troubleshooting help specific to my program?\n\nUndergraduate students can reference these troubleshooting tips from Academic Advising.\n\nI’m a dual-degree graduate student, and Axess won’t let me drop a class. Why not?\n\nAxess does not allow dual-degree students to drop below the unit minimum in either career, even when enrollment across both careers would still be considered full-time. In order to drop a course, you will need to complete the Multiple Career Enrollment Change request, located in the Student eForms portal. This will tell the Registrar's office which course you'd like to drop and they will manually make the change."
