        "text": "Information Systems and Technology (IS&T) is pleased to announce the launch of a pilot program for a new tool called Microsoft 365 Copilot. This new service offers the ability to use AI to securely work with your Chapman data in your existing Microsoft products (Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams) using OpenAI GPT technology. You can read the official announcement about Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n\nWith Microsoft 365 Copilot, you can:\n\nGenerate high-quality content for various purposes, such as email responses, reports, summaries, or presentations.\n\nFind relevant information and insights across multiple Chapman data sources, such as OneDrive, Email, SharePoint, and Teams.\n\nGet suggestions and feedback on your writing style, tone, grammar, and clarity.\n\nThe purpose of the pilot is to help determine the value of this service to the campus community. The pilot program is available to full-time faculty, staff, and administrators.\n\nPlease note the following additional details:\n\nThe licenses are expected to be available in May 2024 for a period of 1 year, after which a decision around extension will be made and communicated.\n\nLicense quantities are limited and are first-come, first-serve based on signups.\n\nEach person must individually submit a request for a license.\n\nAll participants will be added to a Microsoft Teams channel to share feedback and ideas. Microsoft Teams is optional but recommended as a convenient way to utilize M365 Copilot.\n\nParticipants will receive short periodic surveys from IS&T on your experiences.\n\nIS&T will periodically evaluate users for non-activity, and you may be asked to surrender your license if no utilization is detected over a 30-day period.\n\nYou may submit your request to receive a Microsoft 365 Copilot license!\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nWhat is the difference between Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot for Web?\n\nIS&T previously announced the availability of Copilot for Web (formerly Bing Chat Enterprise) as an enterprise equivalent of ChatGPT for faculty, staff, and students. This remains available for all users. The new Microsoft 365 Copilot works and searches your individual files and is embedded into the Office products that many of us utilize on a daily basis.\n\nWhat is the cost of Microsoft 365 Copilot?\n\nThe cost is currently $360 per year per person and will be paid by IS&T during the pilot program. Long-term funding for Microsoft 365 Copilot has not been identified. As noted previously, the goal of the pilot program is to determine the value of the service.\n\nIs my data safe when using Microsoft 365 Copilot?\n\nYes. Microsoft 365 Copilot can only work with data where you have been assigned permissions and does not share or expose data beyond what is already in place for your content. However, you should always consider the implications of utilizing AI for your specific use case.\n\nVisit Chapman Universityâ€™s AI Hub for more information, including guidelines and suggestions on the use of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThank you,\n\nChapman University Information Systems and Technology (IS&T)"
