Led by legendary oceanographer Dr. Sylvia Earle, Mission Blue is uniting a global coalition to inspire an upwelling of public awareness, access and support for a worldwide network of marine protected areas – Hope Spots. Under Dr. Earle’s leadership, the Mission Blue team implements communications campaigns that elevate Hope Spots to the world stage through documentaries, social media, traditional media and innovative tools like Esri ArcGIS. Mission Blue also embarks on regular oceanic expeditions that shed light on these vital ecosystems and build support for their protection. Currently, the Mission Blue alliance includes more than 200 respected ocean conservation groups and like-minded organizations, from large multinational companies to individual scientific teams doing important research. Additionally, Mission Blue supports the work of conservation NGOs that share the mission of building public support for ocean protection. With the concerted effort and passion of people and organizations around the world, Hope Spots can become a reality and form a global network of marine protected areas large enough to restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nSylvia Earle PhD\n\nChairman, Founder and President\n\nSylvia Earle is President and Chairman of Mission Blue / The Sylvia Earle Alliance.

During his near two decades of work for WCPA he led the increase of MPA coverage from around 1.3% of the global ocean to the c8% seen today, the creation of the original global 20 – 30% MPA target in the Durban Accord, and the ‘at least 30%’ MPA target at Sydney World Park Congress. The latter, resoundingly supported by IUCN members at Hawaii World Conservation Congress, and adopted for land and freshwater, has now become the central focus for negotiations in the CBD’s post-2020 biodiversity framework. During his tenure, among many significant achievements, he was instrumental in forming the High Seas Alliance, in laying the basis for UNESCO’s Marine World Heritage Programme, and creating such influential phrases as ‘marine and coastal carbon sinks’, ‘ocean risk’, and ‘natural solutions’. Working with his co-editor Professor John Baxter, together they created some of the most downloaded publications for IUCN in recent decades, focused on elevating topics such as ‘ocean warming’ and ‘ocean deoxygenation’ into the global public domain. He also led Commission members in the development of specific marine WCPA guidance on the IUCN Management Categories and created and led the development of IUCN’s MPA Standards....\n\nRead Full Bio\n\nProf Dan Laffoley\n\nChair, Hope Spot Council\n\nDan is Emeritus Marine Vice Chair of WCPA, having retired from that position in 2022. During his near two decades of work for WCPA he led the increase of MPA coverage from around 1.3% of the global ocean to the c8% seen today, the creation of the original global 20 – 30% MPA target in the Durban Accord, and the ‘at least 30%’ MPA target at Sydney World Park Congress. The latter, resoundingly supported by IUCN members at Hawaii World Conservation Congress, and adopted for land and freshwater, has now become the central focus for negotiations in the CBD’s post-2020 biodiversity framework. During his tenure, among many significant achievements, he was instrumental in forming the High Seas Alliance, in laying the basis for UNESCO’s Marine World Heritage Programme, and creating such influential phrases as ‘marine and coastal carbon sinks’, ‘ocean risk’, and ‘natural solutions’. Working with his co-editor Professor John Baxter, together they created some of the most downloaded publications for IUCN in recent decades, focused on elevating topics such as ‘ocean warming’ and ‘ocean deoxygenation’ into the global public domain.

She has volunteered and helped raise funds for a number of animal rescue organizations and considers animals blessings, that enrich our lives. Fun fact, her dog A.J. (since passed) once got to meet a whale shark in Baja, California while on a boat trip. Working with Champions and communities around the world, committed to ocean conservation has been an inspiring, rewarding and humbling job.
