        "text": "Mind the deadlines\n\nProspective students should be mindful of deadlines and work to ensure that a complete Barrett application is on file by the appropriate date. A Barrett application is complete when:\n\nIt has been submitted, not just saved.\n\nBoth required letters of recommendation have been received by Barrett.\n\nThe student has been admitted to an Arizona State University undergraduate degree program at the ASU Downtown Phoenix, Polytechnic, Tempe or West Valley campus.*\n\n*Though a Barrett application may be started and even submitted before ASU admission is conferred, it cannot go to evaluation until university acceptance is formally awarded. Apply to ASU accordingly.\n\nStudents who submit an application in time for a particular deadline will receive a short grace period for missing letters of recommendation to be received and for ASU admission to be processed.\n\nApply to ASU\n\nStudents interested in Barrett must first apply to Arizona State University and then may begin the separate and free Barrett application.\n\nProspective students should apply to ASU at least 4 weeks before their preferred Barrett deadline.\n\nWhen completing the ASU application, self-reporting grades will result in a significantly faster university decision. The Common Application is another option to apply to ASU.\n\nASU Application Common Application\n\nWhen a student applies for ASU admission, an ASURITE ID is issued. Students must then activate their ASURITE ID, which includes identifying a password. The ASURITE ID and password are required to begin the free Barrett application.\n\nASURITE activation\n\nSubmit your Barrett application\n\nAll incoming first-year ASU students apply for Barrett Lower Division consideration, regardless of AP/IB/dual enrollment credits.\n\nThe Barrett application does not need to be completed in one sitting. A student may start, save their work, exit and then return at a later date to finish and submit the application ahead of the appropriate deadline. After starting the application, a student may re-access it via the “Apply now” button or through the Barrett Application Status area of their My ASU webpage.\n\nFor the best application experience, use the most current version of your internet browser.\n\nThe 2025 Barrett application will open on Wednesday, September 4.\n\nConfirm your spot\n\nTo secure their spot as a member of the fall 2025 Arizona State University incoming class, an admitted student must submit the ASU enrollment deposit via their My ASU web portal. This action will also confirm their place in Barrett, The Honors College. There is no separate Barrett deposit. Barrett students who fail to address the ASU enrollment deposit by May 1, 2025 may forfeit their spot to a deserving student on the wait list."
