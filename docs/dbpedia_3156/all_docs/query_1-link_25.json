        "text": "Student loan forgiveness calls, emails, or text messages setting off your scam sensors? Read on to learn how to identify and avoid student loan forgiveness scams and find out what you should do if you think youâve been scammed.\n\nScams come in all shapes and sizes, from phone calls and emails to text messages. You may Â encounter scams tied to current events. But sometimes itâs as simple as a fake promise to work fast and save you lots of money. Remember: A scam doesnât have to be elaborate or complex.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission received 495,855 fraud reports in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThere are legitimate programs and resources available if you need help with your federal student loans, including the\n\nFederal Direct Consolidation Loan Program,\n\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness, and\n\nTeacher Loan Forgiveness.\n\nYou can work with your loan servicer to explore what options are right for youâfree of charge. But many companies will try to take advantage of borrowers by guaranteeing immediate results or requesting money up front for services they canât provide.\n\nWhat do common scams look like?\n\nAggressive Advertising Language\n\nHere are some examples of false claims you might come across:\n\nâAct immediately to qualify for student loan forgiveness before the program is discontinued.â\n\nâYour student loans may qualify for complete discharge. Enrollments are first come, first served.â\n\nâStudent alerts: Your student loan is flagged for forgiveness pending verification. Call now!â\n\nThough the U.S. Department of Education may reach out to highlight temporary programs, aggressive advertising language like the above will not come from us or our partners.\n\nPromises That Are Too Good To Be True\n\nScammers will frequently request an up-front or monthly fee while promising immediate and total student loan cancellation. Most government forgiveness programs require years of qualifying payments and/or employment in certain fields before forgiving loans.\n\nAsking for Log-in Info\n\nA scammer may even ask for your StudentAid.gov account information, like your FSA ID (account username and password). This is a red flag. We and our partners will never ask for your password. Thatâs a guarantee.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education and our partners will never ask for your StudentAid.gov username and password.\n\nTypos\n\nIf you receive a questionable message promising student loan forgiveness and arenât sure what to make of it, keep an eye out for any unusual capitalization, improper grammar, or incomplete sentences. These sorts of errors indicate a potential scam in action.\n\nUnofficial Addresses or Phone Numbers\n\nSome scammers may use official-looking names, seals, and logos, but that doesnât make them trustworthy. Know what official communications from us and our partners look like and always double check the senderâs email address.\n\nEmails from us will only come from these addresses:\n\nnoreply@studentaid.gov\n\nnoreply@debtrelief.studentaid.gov\n\ned.gov@public.govdelivery.com\n\nText messages from us will only come from 227722 or 51592.\n\nStill not sure if youâre being scammed? You can check with your local Better Business BureauÂ® to see if a company has any complaints.\n\nShould I pay for debt relief help?\n\nIf youâre having difficulty paying for your student loans, your first step should be to contact your loan servicer. Some debt relief companies will charge a fee for services that you and your servicer can work out together, for free.\n\nWe and our affiliated federal loan servicers can help you\n\nlower your monthly loan payment,\n\nconsolidate multiple federal student loans,\n\nswitch to a new repayment plan, or\n\nsee if you qualify for loan forgiveness.\n\nGetting assistance from a private, unaffiliated debt relief company doesnât necessarily mean youâll be scammed. But seeking out unverified services is a common path to a student loan forgiveness scam.\n\nWho are legitimate loan servicers?\n\nWe work hand in hand with some private companiesâsuch as lenders and loan servicersâto support federal student loans and borrowers. To avoid student loan forgiveness scams, itâs important to know who these companies are and what services they provide.\n\nYour loan servicer works on the governmentâs behalf to\n\ncollect your loan payments,\n\nanswer any questions you have about your loans,\n\nhelp you decide which repayment plan is right for you, and\n\nhelp you switch to a new plan at no cost.\n\nTo find out who your student loan servicer is, log in and visit your account Dashboard. You can also call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-433-3243.\n\nIf you need help with your federal student loans or are pursuing some form of student loan forgiveness, make sure youâre contacting a U.S. Department of Education affiliated company that you can trust. Review our list of contracted federal student loan servicers before reaching out to a potential partner.\n\nWhat should I do if I think Iâve been scammed?\n\nFor all types of student loan forgiveness scams, act fast and follow one or all of these options:\n\nContact your federal loan servicer to make sure no unwanted actions were taken on your loans (or to revoke any authorization agreement that your servicer has on file).\n\nContact your bank or credit card company to stop all payments to the company that is scamming you.\n\nSubmit a complaint to us.\n\nFile a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nFile a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nFSA ID Account Scams"
