        "text": "We answer questions about deadlines, high school requirements, home schooling, transcripts, regional campuses and more.\n\nAre dual enrollment college transcripts required for freshman admission?\n\nIf you completed dual enrollment coursework while in high school, official copies of your college transcripts(s) are not required at the time of application or for an admission decision. Upon graduation from high school, official final transcripts from all post-secondary institutions showing grades for dual enrollment coursework will be due to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\nNote: If you are earning an Associate in Arts degree at the same time as your high school diploma, we may request an official copy of your college transcript(s) to be sent in addition to your completed SPARK Form.\n\nCan I retest for a higher ACT, CLT or SAT score\n\nYes! If your standardized test scores are outside of our midranges for admission, you may wish to consider retesting. If you plan to apply Early Action, be advised that your options for retesting may be limited prior to the Nov. 1 application completion date.\n\nNote: It can take up to three weeks for test results to be delivered to and processed by UCF. Take note of the applicable application completion deadline for your preferred term and request your official scores early enough to allow for transit and processing time.\n\nDo I need to have my international academic credentials evaluated?\n\nInternational high school credentials are evaluated by UCF and do not need to be sent to an external evaluation agency for evaluation. However, international post-secondary (college or university) credentials do need to be sent to either World Education Services or Josef Silny & Associates for a course-by-course evaluation.\n\nDoes UCF Admissions require recommendations, essays or interviews?\n\nLetters of recommendation are not required and will not be considered in the general admission process.\n\nThe application for admission provides space for a listing of extra and co-curricular activities; this portion of the application should be completed in lieu of submitting supplemental materials.\n\nThe essay is an optional (but strongly recommended) component of the application for admission. If you elect to submit an essay, please select a topic within the application form and submit it within your completed application.\n\nSupplemental materials – including essays – sent after application submission will not be included in your admission file.\n\nUCF does not conduct interviews as part of the undergraduate application or admission process.\n\nDoes UCF guarantee admission based upon class rank?\n\nUCF no longer guarantees admission for Florida high school graduates based upon senior year class rank.\n\nIn an effort to reduce inequities and inconsistencies in how Top 10 Knights were identified, the initiative was discontinued in June 2023, effective for all subsequent first-year application cycles.\n\nIn recent years, some Florida high schools and/or districts changed the way class rank is calculated and reported, making it difficult to accurately evaluate and determine students for Top 10 Knights qualification.\n\nUCF remains committed to a holistic application review process that includes consideration of course selection, curriculum, rigor, grade point average, test score(s), and other subjective factors. When accurately reported, class rank will be a consideration, however, unranked students will not be disadvantaged in the admission review process.\n\nDoes UCF have specific essay or personal statement topics?\n\nAlthough optional, an essay can assist the Admissions Committee in knowing you as an individual, independent of test scores and other objective data. If you would like to submit an essay, please select from one of the topics below. Your response should be limited to a total of 250 words.\n\nWhy did you choose to apply to UCF?\n\nWhat qualities or unique characteristics do you possess that will allow you to contribute to the UCF community?\n\nDoes UCF offer any English language learning programs?\n\nYes, The English Language Institute at UCF offers an intensive, student-focused, English learning curriculum based on face-to-face instruction.\n\nDoes UCF offer Study Abroad Programs?\n\nStudy abroad can broaden one’s view of themselves and the world around them. Students often return with a refined sense of what they want to achieve in life and increased maturity, confidence and motivation.\n\nPlease visit UCF Study Abroad for more information about programs and program options.\n\nDoes UCF superscore the SAT or ACT?\n\nUCF superscores both the SAT and the ACT. The SAT superscore is compiled using the highest Evidence-Based Reading/Writing and Math from all test components received. The ACT superscore is compiled using the highest English, Math, Reading and Science scores from all test components received.\n\nUCF does not prefer one test over the other. Since students perform differently on each test, they are encouraged to take both exams if possible.\n\nHow can I increase my competitiveness in the applicant pool?\n\nThe Admissions Committee looks at many factors when reviewing a student’s application. The admission decision is made primarily based upon the academic credentials (high school GPA, rigor of course work, and SAT/ACT/CLT scores).\n\nTo increase their competitiveness in the applicant pool, students are encouraged to submit 1st semester senior grades and/or updated SAT/ACT/CLT scores.\n\nHow can I qualify for a waiver of the application fee?\n\nYour $30 application fee can be waived on the basis of financial hardship by uploading one of the following items within your application at the time of submission:\n\nAn SAT, ACT, SCOIR or NACAC fee waiver form from your high school guidance office;\n\nDocumentation from your high school showing your eligibility for a free or reduced lunch;\n\nYour family’s most recent tax return\n\nIf a Social Security Number (SSN) appears on the waiver request, please black out all but the last four digits for security purposes.\n\nHow can I send my Cambridge AICE scores to UCF?\n\nIf you are a U.S. student, you may request to have your Cambridge AICE transcript submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions through the Cambridge International Grade Transcript Service. Use the following information when completing the form.\n\nName and job title of person receiving results transcript: Debra Reynolds, Director of Operations and Technology\n\nUniversity name: University of Central Florida\n\nMailing address of person receiving results transcript: UCF Undergraduate Admissions, P.O. Box 160111, Orlando, FL 32816-0111\n\nUniversity email address: myapplicationdocs@ucf.edu\n\nHow do I appeal an admission decision?\n\nA student who is denied admission to UCF for academic reasons only, has a right to appeal that decision. If a student chooses to appeal, they must submit a letter of appeal revealing new academic information that was not present in the initial admission application. Letters can be mailed or emailed to:\n\nAdmissions and Standards Committee\n\nc/o The Executive Director of Undergraduate Admissions\n\nP.O. Box 160111\n\nOrlando, FL 32816-0111\n\n-or-\n\nadmissionappeals@ucf.edu\n\nHow do I let UCF know I am accepting a spot on the waitlist?\n\nIf you wish to remain under consideration for admission, you must accept a spot on the waitlist if offered. Your application will be denied if you choose to decline a waitlist offer.\n\nYou can confirm a waitlist offer on your Future Knight Portal.\n\nHow do I obtain/verify Florida residency for tuition purposes?\n\nYour residency classification is based upon information from your application — documentation of your Florida residency may be required. If you have already attended UCF as an undergraduate student and wish to reclassify your residency for tuition purposes, please visit the registrar’s office website for information on residency reclassification.\n\nHow do I send a transcript to UCF?\n\nWe suggest contacting your school(s) individually to determine how they send transcripts. Undergraduate Admissions can accept official transcripts through U.S. mail or electronically when sent directly from your institution through a secure delivery service.\n\nElectronic transcripts can only be accepted as official if they are delivered through one of the following approved transcript service providers:\n\nSPEEDE (Addressed Institution ID: 10002 Institution ID: 730000000395400)\n\nParchment Exchange (including Naviance and Docufide)\n\nNational Student Clearinghouse\n\nCredential Solutions\n\nScribbles Software\n\nAARTS and SMART transcripts (military service only, not required for admission)\n\nSCOIR\n\nNOTE: If the transcript delivery service asks you to provide an email address to send transcripts to, please use myapplicationdocs@ucf.edu.\n\nWhen sending a transcript through one of the above service providers, their system may indicate that it has been delivered; however, please allow two to three weeks for UCF Undergraduate Admissions to process these documents. Instead of sending duplicates, please verify receipt of the transcript through your application status on your Future Knight Portal.\n\nHard copy transcripts may be sent to:\n\nUCF Undergraduate Admissions\n\nP.O. Box 160111\n\nOrlando, FL 32816-0111\n\nHow does UCF view Pass/Fail and Satisfactory (S)/Unsatisfactory (U) grades on transcripts?\n\nYour UCF recalculated GPA for admission purposes is determined by what your high school puts on your official transcript and by which method of grading your institution has chosen to adopt.\n\nCompleted courses being graded as Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory will not affect your UCF recalculated GPA. Courses receiving an “S (Satisfactory)” earn credit for being completed. Courses receiving a “U (Unsatisfactory)” will not earn credit.\n\nCourses that are marked “P (Pass)” will also result in credit earned and will not impact your UCF recalculated GPA. However, courses that are marked “F (Fail)” will be viewed as a failing grade and an “F” will be included in your UCF recalculated GPA. It is important to know which option your school is offering and fully understand the potential consequences of your choices if you are given options for U, S, P or F marks.\n\nIf you are transferring college level coursework to UCF, you should know that certain degree programs require a “B” grade or higher in some courses. You should contact the academic advising office in the college of your major for additional information on how these marks may impact transfer credit.\n\nHow is my high school GPA calculated for admission?\n\nYour GPA is recalculated based on the academic core courses (including English, math, science, social studies and foreign language). UCF uses a 4.0 grading scale, and also awards additional quality points for any weighted courses within the academic core. Courses marked as pre-AP, pre-IB, pre-AICE and honors are given an additional 0.5 quality point. Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced International Certification of Education (AICE) and Dual Enrollment (DE) courses are given 1 additional quality point.\n\nHow long does it take for an electronic transcript to arrive at UCF?\n\nElectronic transcripts usually arrive at the university within five to ten business days after being sent from the institution of origin.\n\nAll documents, including documents submitted electronically, require processing time once received by UCF. Document processing time varies by time of year:\n\nNon-Peak: 5-7 business days minimum from date of receipt\n\nPeak times (around application deadlines and the start of every semester): 7-10 business days minimum from date of receipt\n\nTo avoid delays, submit all required documents as early as possible and well before application completion deadlines.\n\nHow long does it take for Undergraduate Admissions to process any document I submit?\n\nAll documents, including documents submitted electronically, require transit and processing time. Document processing time varies by time of year:\n\nNon-Peak: 5-7 business days minimum from date of receipt\n\nPeak times (around application deadlines and the start of every semester): 7-10 business days minimum from date of receipt\n\nTo avoid delays, submit all required documents as early as possible and well before application completion deadlines.\n\nI am graduating from an international high school. What academic credentials do I have to submit?\n\nPlease refer to our Country Reference Guide for a list of secondary school credentials required by country. If your country is not listed, please contact us at uainternational@ucf.edu.\n\nI am on the waitlist. What does that mean?\n\nAdmission to UCF is more competitive today than at any other time in our history. We typically receive approximately 45,000 freshman applications for an incoming class of 5,000. As a result, a number of students are offered space on our waitlist.\n\nIt is important to understand that a waitlist offer is not the same as being denied; you could still be considered for admission to UCF should space open up in our freshman class.\n\nI have been deferred for updated test scores. When will my file be reviewed again after submitting new scores?\n\nThe Admissions Committee will reevaluate your application for admission after new test scores are received on rolling basis. Decisions are released through May 1.\n\nI have been deferred. Can I send a resume, letters of recommendation, or additional essays?\n\nSupplemental materials – including essays – sent after application submission will not be included in your admission file.\n\nI have been deferred. What does that mean?\n\nAdmission to UCF is more competitive today than at any other time in our history. We typically receive approximately 45,000 freshman applications for an incoming class of about 5,000. Freshmen students who receive a defer have had an initial file review but the admission committee needs more information before making a final decision. Students will be asked to submit additional academic credentials that include either first semester senior year grades, updated SAT, ACT or CLT scores, or in some case, both.\n\nThe Self-Reported Academic Record for Knights (SPARK) Form will open in January for students to input mid-year senior year grades.\n\nI have DACA status or am undocumented. Can I apply to UCF?\n\nUndocumented students, with or without DACA, are welcome to apply for admission and enroll at the University of Central Florida and are not obligated to disclose their status. Admission is based upon the strength of a student’s academic credentials, regardless of their immigration status. Undocumented and DACA applicants will discover a welcoming atmosphere and a supportive community at UCF.\n\nFor detailed information regarding the application process, please refer to our website and the steps to apply by applicant type:\n\nFirst-year Applicants\n\nTransfer Applicants\n\nI requested my transcript electronically yesterday. Shouldn’t I see you received it on my Future Knight Portal today?\n\nNo. Electronic transcripts usually arrive at the university within five to ten business days after being sent from the institution of origin.\n\nAll documents, including documents submitted electronically, require transit and processing time. Document processing time varies by time of year:\n\nNon-Peak: 5-7 business days minimum from date of receipt\n\nPeak times (around application deadlines and the start of every semester): 7-10 business days minimum from date of receipt\n\nTo avoid delays, submit all required documents as early as possible and well before application completion deadlines.\n\nI was home-schooled or received a GED. What should I submit?\n\nUCF will consider applications from students who are educated through a home-school program.\n\nIf your home-school follows a traditional U.S.-based high school curriculum, you should complete and submit a SPARK form. Otherwise, please email ucfsparkhelp@ucf.edu for assistance.\n\nOnce you finish your home-school program, you will be required to submit a final official transcript that includes a list of all coursework, showing final grades and units earned for each course completed. A brief description of the methods used for evaluation should accompany the home-school transcript. If home-schooled applicants previously attended another school or completed courses through the Florida Virtual School or through dual enrollment at a local college or university, official transcripts are required. Those courses should also be reflected on the home-school transcript.\n\nApplicants who present a GED will also be considered for admission. Official GED results, a partial high school transcript, and ACT, SAT and/or CLT results must be submitted.\n\nI've been admitted for summer. Which term can I begin?\n\nUCF offers four summer terms: A, B, C and D. New first-year students may only start in the Summer B term, which is a six-week term typically beginning in late June and concluding in early August.\n\nIf I apply for fall, will I be considered for summer as well?\n\nYes, freshmen students that apply for the fall semester, will be considered for all possible terms and pathways.\n\nFor a list of admission pathways, visit UCF admission pathways\n\nIs a defer the same as waitlist?\n\nNo. A defer usually happens early in the application cycle and means that your application has been put on hold and will be considered again throughout the rolling process, hopefully with updated academic information. A waitlist offer happens later in the application cycle and means you could still being considered for admission to UCF should space open up in our freshman class.\n\nIs the Top 10 Knights initiative discontinued?\n\nIn an effort to reduce inequities and inconsistencies in how Top 10 Knights were identified, the initiative was discontinued in June 2023, effective for all subsequent first-year application cycles.\n\nIn recent years, some Florida high schools and/or districts changed the way class rank is calculated and reported, making it difficult to accurately evaluate and determine students for Top 10 Knights qualification.\n\nUCF remains committed to a holistic application review process that includes consideration of course selection, curriculum, rigor, grade point average, test score(s), and other subjective factors. When accurately reported, class rank will be a consideration, however, unranked students will not be disadvantaged in the admission review process.\n\nAll students, regardless of placement within their graduating class, are encouraged to submit an application to UCF within the first two months their senior year. The timing of your application remains one of the most consequential factors in being offered admission to UCF.\n\nWhat are the application completion deadlines for first-year students?\n\nFreshman Application Deadlines\n\nEARLY ACTION REGULAR DECISION APPLICATION DEADLINE Oct. 15 (Summer & Fall) Mar. 1 (Summer)\n\nMay 1 (Fall)\n\nNov. 1 (Spring) MATERIAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE Nov. 1 (Summer & Fall) Mar. 1 (Summer)\n\nMay 1 (Fall)\n\nNov. 1 (Spring)\n\nNOTE: The Scholarship Priority Deadline for FTIC students applying for summer and fall is November 1.\n\nInternational Student Application Deadlines\n\nREGULAR DECISION APPLICATION DEADLINE Jan. 1 (Summer)\n\nMar. 1 (Fall)\n\nSep. 1 (Spring) MATERIAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE Jan. 1 (Summer)\n\nMar. 1 (Fall)\n\nSep. 1 (Spring)\n\nView Academic Calendar\n\nWhat are the chances that I will be moved off of the waitlist?\n\nIt is difficult to predict how many students may be offered admission from the waitlist. The number of spaces, if any, that open in our freshman class determines the number of students admitted. You are encouraged to submit updated transcripts and/or ACT/CLT/SAT scores for the Admissions Committee to review.\n\nWhat are the foreign language admission requirements?\n\nThe state of Florida requires that you demonstrate proficiency in a world language or American Sign Language equivalent to at least the second high school level (e.g., Spanish II) or the second elementary course at the college level (e.g., SPN 1211 – Beginning Spanish II).\n\nPlease visit our Freshman Applicants or Transfer page for details on the satisfaction of foreign language for admission.\n\nThis requirement will be satisfied upon receipt of the A.A. degree from a Florida public community/state college or university if you initially entered Fall 2014–15 of after.\n\nWhat documents do I need to submit with my application?\n\nTo review requirements and required documents, please visit the homepage and select the category of student that best describes you.\n\nWhat if I am admitted off of the waitlist after the May 1 enrollment deposit deadline?\n\nIt is possible that you will be notified of your decision after the traditional May 1 enrollment deposit deadline. This is not unusual for students on the waitlist. If you are admitted, you will be given a new deposit deadline.\n\nWhat is a Application Completion Deadline?\n\nThe Application Completion Deadline (also referred to as the Material Submission Deadline) is the date by which the application for admission, application fee or fee waiver, and all necessary academic credentials and supporting documents must be submitted to UCF to be considered for admission. Academic credentials can include, but are not limited to high school transcripts, college or university transcripts, SAT, ACT or CLT scores, TOEFL, IELTS or CLEP scores, international transcript evaluations, and AICE, AP or IB score reports. Students failing to submit the required credentials or documentation by the Application Completion Deadline may be required to reapply for a future term.\n\nAfter your application and application fee are submitted and processed, a list of required documents will be available on your Future Knight Portal. If checklist items are not marked as received, your application is not complete and may not be reviewed by the admissions committee.\n\nFreshman Application Deadlines\n\nEARLY ACTION REGULAR DECISION APPLICATION DEADLINE Oct. 15 (Summer & Fall) Mar. 1 (Summer)\n\nMay 1 (Fall)\n\nNov. 1 (Spring) MATERIAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE Nov. 1 (Summer & Fall) Mar. 1 (Summer)\n\nMay 1 (Fall)\n\nNov. 1 (Spring)\n\nNOTE: The Scholarship Priority Deadline for FTIC students applying for summer and fall is November 1.\n\nTransfer Application Deadlines\n\nREGULAR DECISION APPLICATION DEADLINE Mar. 1 (Summer)\n\nJul. 1 (Fall)\n\nNov. 1 (Spring) MATERIAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE Mar. 1 (Summer)\n\nJul. 1 (Fall)\n\nNov. 1 (Spring)\n\nInternational Student Application Deadlines\n\nREGULAR DECISION APPLICATION DEADLINE Jan. 1 (Summer)\n\nMar. 1 (Fall)\n\nSep. 1 (Spring) MATERIAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE Jan. 1 (Summer)\n\nMar. 1 (Fall)\n\nSep. 1 (Spring)\n\nWhat is a First-Time In College student?\n\nFirst-Time In College (FTIC) students are defined by the number of college credits completed after high school graduation. Any student who graduates from high school and enrolls at UCF having completed less than 12 college credits since earning their high school diploma is an FTIC.\n\nCollege credits completed as part of a high school curriculum (including dual enrollment and accelerated credit such as AICE, AP, CLEP or IB) are not counted toward the credit limit. Even students who have completed significant college credit, such as an AA degree, are considered FTICs as long as the credit or degree was earned while still enrolled in high school.\n\nWhat is an official transcript?\n\nAn official transcript is a sealed record sent directly to UCF from an institution you attended. You can send an official transcript yourself if the envelope has not been opened.\n\nWhat is the difference between a student taking online courses and a student enrolled in a fully online program?\n\nStudents admitted to UCF as campus-based students have complete access to UCF campus-based services and pay full tuition and fees. Campus based students may enroll in both online and campus-based courses.\n\nA UCF Online student is a strictly online student who does not attend courses on campus. UCF Online students pay reduced fees and do not have access to all campus based activities such as housing, health services, Recreation and Wellness Center, athletics, etc. UCF Online students may only enroll in online and video streaming courses.\n\nWhat is the physical address of UCF Undergraduate Admissions?\n\nFor certified or overnight mail, packages or if you plan to use a shipping service (e.g. DHL, FedEx, UPS, etc.), please send correspondences to the following address:\n\nUCF Undergraduate Admissions\n\n12585 Gemini Boulevard South\n\nOrlando, FL 32816\n\nWhat methods of payment do you accept for my admission application fee and my enrollment deposit?\n\nA major credit or debit card is accepted as payment for both the $30 admission application fee (freshmen and transfer students) and the $200 enrollment deposit (freshmen students) .\n\nWhat number am I on the waitlist?\n\nThe waitlist at UCF is not ranked. All students accepting a waitlist offer will be considered for admission to the university on a space-available basis.\n\nWhen can I take the SAT, ACT and/or CLT exam?\n\nStudents should register for and take the SAT, ACT and/or CLT exams early – preferably once in their junior year and again at the beginning of the senior year of high school.\n\nNOTE: SAT and ACT scores must have been taken within the last five years. CLT scores must have been taken after July 1, 2023.\n\nSAT, ACT and CLT administration dates are published by the respective testing agencies and can be viewed here:\n\nSAT Test Administration Dates\n\nACT Test Administration Dates\n\nCLT Exam Dates\n\nNote: It can take up to three weeks for test results to be delivered to and processed by UCF. Take note of the applicable application completion deadline for your preferred term and request your official scores early enough to allow for transit and processing time.\n\nWhen do I find out if I’ve been offered a UCF merit scholarship?\n\nWe recommend applying for admission between August and October of your senior year to be considered for a UCF merit scholarship. The Priority Scholarship Application Deadline is November 1. The Scholarship Committee will review admitted freshmen for scholarships in November and periodically thereafter while funds are available, however, scholarship resources are limited, and additional awards may be extremely competitive after the deadline.\n\nIf you are awarded a merit scholarship, you will receive an official letter in the mail with details on your scholarship. You may also check your status on myUCF.\n\nWhen do I have to send final transcripts to UCF?\n\nFRESHMEN: A copy of your official final transcript showing the date of high school graduation is due no later than June 30 for students enrolling in the summer term and no later than July 15 for students enrolling in fall. If your transcript does not match information provided on your SPARK Form, your offer of admission may be rescinded. You must also submit official final transcripts from every post-secondary institution (i.e. dual enrollment) attended.\n\nTRANSFERS: A copy of your official final transcripts from each institution attended is required. If you satisfied the foreign language requirement in high school, a copy of your official final high school transcript must be submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\nALL: Failure to provide final transcripts to UCF may also delay the disbursement of financial aid. Failure to meet all admission criteria will result in a change in your eligibility for financial aid. Your admission is contingent upon your successful completion of all coursework at a level consistent with that at the time of admission. Your enrollment is not complete until all official final transcripts and test scores are on file in our office. The status of these transcripts is available on your Future Knight Portal. Failure to provide final transcripts will jeopardize your ability to adjust your schedule, register for future terms, receive grades or have transcripts sent to other institutions.\n\nNOTE: All documents, including documents submitted electronically, require processing time. Document processing time varies by time of year:\n\nNon-peak: 5-7 business days minimum\n\nPeak times (around application deadlines and first few weeks of each semester): 7-10 business days minimum\n\nTo avoid delays, submit all required documents as early as possible and well before deadlines.\n\nHow competitive is it to get admitted into UCF?\n\nFor freshmen, the mid-range (middle 50 percent) of our Fall entering class was:\n\nGPA: 4.1 – 4.5 (recalculated academic core)\n\nSAT: 1270 – 1390 (Evidence-based Reading and Writing + Math)\n\nACT: 26 – 30 (composite)\n\nCLT: 90-100\n\nWhat are the application deadlines & decision dates?\n\nFreshman Application Deadlines\n\nEARLY ACTION REGULAR DECISION APPLICATION DEADLINE Oct. 15 (Summer & Fall) Mar. 1 (Summer)\n\nMay 1 (Fall)\n\nNov. 1 (Spring) MATERIAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE Nov. 1 (Summer & Fall) Mar. 1 (Summer)\n\nMay 1 (Fall)\n\nNov. 1 (Spring) DECISION NOTIFICATION Nov. 15 (Summer & Fall) Rolling ** DECISION OUTCOMES Admit, Pathway Admit, Defer, Deny Admit, Pathway Admit, Defer, Deny, Waitlist\n\nNOTE: The Scholarship Priority Deadline for FTIC students applying for summer and fall is November 1.\n\n** Following the Nov. 15 Early Action decision notification date, the Admissions Committee will resume its review of FTIC summer and fall applications in early January and continue releasing decisions on a rolling basis through May 1.\n\nTransfer Application Deadlines:\n\nREGULAR DECISION APPLICATION DEADLINE Mar. 1 (Summer)\n\nJul. 1 (Fall)\n\nNov. 1 (Spring) MATERIAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE Mar. 1 (Summer)\n\nJul. 1 (Fall)\n\nNov. 1 (Spring) DECISION NOTIFICATION Rolling DECISION OUTCOMES Admit, Defer, Deny\n\nAll International Application Deadlines\n\nREGULAR DECISION APPLICATION DEADLINE Jan. 1 (Summer)\n\nMar. 1 (Fall)\n\nSep. 1 (Spring) MATERIAL SUBMISSION DEADLINE Jan. 1 (Summer)\n\nMar. 1 (Fall)\n\nSep. 1 (Spring) DECISION NOTIFICATION Rolling DECISION OUTCOMES Admit, Pathway Admit, Defer, Deny, Waitlist\n\nView Academic Calendar\n\nWhen is the best time to apply for admission?\n\nFreshmen should apply early (between September and November of their senior year in high school) for maximum consideration in the admission and scholarship review process.\n\nTransfer students should apply 6-9 months prior to the term for which you plan to enroll.\n\nApply Today\n\nDoes UCF require standardized tests?\n\nYes.
