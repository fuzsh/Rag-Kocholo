Consumers should reach out to their internet company to see if they offer alternative low-cost internet plans. They may be able to help you enroll in a new and affordable plan even though the ACP benefit is no longer available.\n\nWhy can I no longer apply for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)?\n\nDue to a lack of additional funding from Congress, the ACP stopped accepting new applications as of February 7, 2024. The last fully funded month of the ACP was April 2024, and the program has ended for now. If Congress provides more funds for the ACP, the FCC will issue additional information."
