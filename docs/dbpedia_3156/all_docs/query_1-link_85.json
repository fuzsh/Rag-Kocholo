        "text": "We want to make sure you can access our services when you need them. Currently, you can book appointments up to 90 days ahead, which is great for planning. However, we know that sometimes unexpected situations arise or urgent testing is required, and waiting is not always feasible.\n\nThis summer 2024, a new feature in our booking system will allow you to book an appointment on the same day. Soon, a portion of our daily appointments will be reserved for same-day bookings. This means that when urgency strikes, you won’t have to worry about waiting for an available slot. These same-day appointments will be released on the day itself, ensuring that you get the care you need exactly when you need it.\n\nThis improvement will replace our current Save My Spot! ™ mobile app, which allowed virtual reservations for urgent needs. With our new system, we are directly allocating slots for same-day testing, reducing your wait time at our patient service centres. Because when it comes to your health, we are here to make things easier for you."
