        "text": "Initiative is commonly defined as doing something without being told. It is the first step in a series of actions which are unsolicited, and it starts with you! So, how can you apply initiative to get feedback from your manager or to navigate your career?\n\nShow initiative to navigate your career\n\nWhen deciding what your next career move will be, the first step is to give some thought to where you want to go in your career. What is the goal? Once you have a goal in mind, investigate the field if it is new to you, to be sure your personal interests align with the job responsibilities. This could be accomplished by conducting informational interviews. Once you set a goal, use the C&T assessment to identify any opportunities for learning and improvement. Then create a learning plan and look for opportunities on the Yale Learn and Grow website to take a course or utilize LinkedIn Learning. Set up time with your manager to discuss your career aspirations, especially if your interest is to develop in your current role.\n\nTake initiative to receive feedback on your performance\n\nEach year, clerical and technical employees should receive an annual performance feedback review utilizing the C&T feedback form. Although this is an annual event, the discussions between you and your manager should entail coaching and feedback throughout the year. Be sure to take account of your current work goals and ask how you are doing. There is nothing worse than being surprised during your annual review with feedback that you are struggling in a particular area. Feedback that is timely and specific, descriptive, and constructive is highly effective because it gives you the opportunity to improve or adjust your course with assistance from your manager. If you do not have regular meetings to discuss your work with your manager, take the initiative and schedule them yourself. This can help you to fill any gaps in knowledge or ask clarifying questions about your goals. Be sure to watch the video on C&T Performance Feedback.\n\nOther areas where you can show initiative in the workplace\n\nSpot opportunities for improvement and share at a staff meeting.\n\nOffer to help a co-worker so that your team can meet their deadlines.\n\nLearn something new, which may be of interest to you or that may enhance the way you approach your work; then share it with others.\n\nAsk for the chance to shadow someone in your department or cross-train in duties.\n\nTake a LinkedIn Learning course to sharpen your soft skills.\n\nSoft skills, such as initiative, are highly sought-after by hiring managers. To demonstrate initiative, think about how you can apply it to get feedback from your manager or to navigate your career."
