        "text": "Applying to medical school can be complex. Our job in the Office of Admissions is to help you decide whether OHSU’s MD Program is a good fit, start your application and stay on track throughout the process.\n\nStudents come to OHSU for:\n\nAccess to outstanding faculty and leading-edge research opportunities at the hospital system routinely named No. 1 in the state by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nAll the resources of Oregon’s only public academic medical center.\n\nEarly clinical experience and increasing patient-care responsibilities as you progress through the program.\n\nA multidisciplinary approach that allows you to individualize your program of study.\n\nOur promise that your tuition will stay the same each year of the program.\n\nIs the MD program right for you?\n\nStudents who do well at OHSU are independent, lifelong learners. Our graduates are motivated by scientific discovery and committed to becoming health care leaders who meet patients’ needs throughout the Northwest.\n\nIn particular, the MD program seeks students who have an interest in rural health, underserved areas and primary care, or an understanding and appreciation of health care issues and an interest in biomedical research.\n\nWe welcome all qualified applicants and follow all requirements for equal opportunity and nondiscrimination. As an applicant, you will be considered based on your academic credentials and your capacity to succeed in your intended program of study. No applicant shall be denied admission based on race, age, sex, religion, or disability. Since direct patient contact is involved in the clinical aspect of most programs, you must be able to perform the required duties without compromising the patient's safety or welfare.\n\nThe MD program gives strong preference to:\n\nOregon residents.\n\nNonresidents with Oregon Heritage.\n\nNonresidents with outstanding achievements in academics and significant experiences in health care, leadership, extracurricular activities and/or community service.\n\nApplicants with a demonstrated ability to overcome adversity and/or applicants who have personally experienced inequities within the healthcare system.\n\nStudents applying to OHSU’s dual degree programs such as the MD/PhD and MD/MPH\n\nApplicants who are WICHE-certified in allopathic medicine.\n\nAdmissions requirements\n\nYour grades, MCAT scores, pre-med experience, communication and interpersonal skills, motivation and maturity all play a role in admission to the MD program.\n\nOur entering class has:\n\nAn average total GPA of 3.66\n\nAn average science GPA of 3.57\n\nAn average MCAT of 509\n\nOur minimum academic and MCAT qualifiers may change from one admissions cycle to the next. When you apply, you must meet the qualifiers for that admissions cycle.\n\nHow the admission process works\n\nWe understand that applying to medical school can be stressful.\n\nWe hope that by explaining the way the process works at OHSU, and offering clear communication throughout the admission cycle, we’ll make your experience as smooth as possible.\n\nHere’s an overview of our admission cycle.\n\nPlease reach out to us if you have any questions. And to make sure you receive important information from us, add our team’s email, mdadmin@ohsu.edu, to your safe senders list\n\nAMCAS application and letter service\n\nOHSU participates in the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). If you meet our admission criteria, the first step is to set up your AMCAS account and submit the online application. Make sure to designate OHSU to receive your completed applications.\n\nAMCAS sends applications to OHSU from May 31 through Oct. 15.\n\nWe also use AMCAS for recommendations. All letters must be sent via the AMCAS Letter Service. If your health professions advisor uses the VirtualEvals or Interfolio letter service, AMCAS will access your letters on these services and make them available to us.\n\nRecommendations\n\nInsights from the people you learn from and work with help the admissions team see whether the MD program would be a good fit for you.\n\nWe require letters from three college or university teaching faculty from any department, with at least one from teaching faculty in a science department.\n\nIf you choose to, you can submit a packet of at least three individual faculty letters or a premedical committee evaluation report (committee letter) instead of three separate recommendations.\n\nIf you have been out of college for five years or more, you can submit two letters from employers and one from a teaching faculty member.\n\nOHSU doesn’t have a maximum number of letters that can be submitted. Our team encourages you to submit a well-chosen group of letters, including nonacademic recommendations that highlight your experiences in health care/physician shadowing and your extracurricular accomplishments.\n\nAll letters need to on departmental/company stationary, signed by the letter writer and submitted through the AMCAS Letter Service. We don’t accept letters that are emailed, faxed or sent directly from applicants.\n\nCASPer test\n\nThe CASPer test is no longer be required, as of the 2024 Cycle. No other tests are required (other than the MCAT). For the 2025 Cycle, only the MCAT is required.\n\nWe consider MD program candidates comparatively based on your application materials. The admissions committee reviews each applicant’s:\n\nAssessment of motivation, ability to communicate, life enriching experiences, problem-solving ability and maturity\n\nOverall academic record\n\nMCAT scores\n\nRecommendation letters\n\nUnderstanding and appreciation of health care issues and/ or biomedical research\n\nInterest in rural health, underserved areas and primary care\n\nFor applicants to the MD/PhD program, commitment to and potential for biomedical research\n\nWe then give each candidate a priority score based on the admissions committee score, MMI scores, and academics.\n\nBased on this ranking, you may be offered acceptance, placed on hold or refused admission.\n\nIf you are admitted, you will receive a notification though our Admissions Portal, followed by an email from our team.\n\nYour initial notification will be followed by a formal acceptance letter sent by email. This message includes a deadline by which to print, sign, scan and return the acceptance and technical standards forms that will be attached.\n\nBackground Checks - following conditional admission offer:\n\nProspective students are not required to disclose criminal convictions prior to receiving an offer of admission. Following a conditional admission offer, prospective students will undergo a pre-matriculation background check pursuant to policy and procedures available on the OHSU Public Safety website. However, OHSU is a university of health professions, and it is possible that professional and occupational licensure requirements may prohibit individuals with criminal convictions from ultimately obtaining a professional license. Licensure requirements vary by state and prospective students are encouraged to consult their state licensing agency for more information.\n\nIf a prospective student is denied admission due to a criminal conviction, they may appeal the final admissions decision to the Office of the Provost at provost@ohsu.edu.\n\nhttps://www.ohsu.edu/public-safety/background-checks\n\nAccepted students\n\nAfter you’re notified of acceptance, you must commit to enrolling at OHSU through AMCAS at least 21 days before the first day of orientation.\n\nOrientation is generally the first week of August. The deadline for making the AMCAS “commit to enroll” selection is in mid-July.\n\nWe do not offer deferred admission. If you decide not to enroll at OHSU, we need to receive your notice of withdrawal directly. Selecting “commit to enroll” for another institution doesn’t automatically withdraw your application from OHSU.\n\nYou can find more details about choosing your medical school and deadlines for holding multiple acceptances on the AMCAS website.\n\nOn hold\n\nIf your application is on hold, you may be accepted out of the hold pool at any time before April 30.\n\nBy May 1, all our initial offers will be made. Our alternate list also will be created and ranked.\n\nAlternates\n\nTo create an alternate list, we rank the top 120 to 200 applicants and assign each one a discrete number. If you are an alternate, we will let you know by May 1.\n\nWe select applicants off the list in order as spots become available between May 1 and the first day of orientation.\n\nWe only skip over applicants who have withdrawn their application by contacting us directly. Please note that selecting “commit to enroll” for another institution through AMCAS does not automatically withdraw your application from OHSU.\n\nIf you applied for a combined degree program and are on the alternate list, we encourage you to reach out to the admissions team for details about your status.\n\nFAQs\n\n/sites/default/files/2024-07/FAQ_2025_final.pdf\n\nTuition, fees and financial aid\n\nApplying to medical school can be nerve-wracking. Figuring out whether you can afford it shouldn’t add to the pressure. That’s why the MD program is committed to making an OHSU education accessible to all qualified applicants.\n\nOur commitment includes a “no surprises” approach to tuition rates and a financial aid team dedicated to helping you navigate all your options.\n\nOur tuition promise\n\nWhen you enroll as a new student, you’ll benefit from OHSU’s promise that your tuition for the MD program won’t go up during the remaining years of your degree program.\n\nWe make this promise to all our students as long as you finish the program within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nFinancial aid\n\nAlmost every student who attends OHSU does so with the help of financial assistance of some kind.\n\nIn the Office of Financial Aid, our goal is to make sure that all qualified applicants have a chance to study here. We can help by connecting you with scholarships, federal and state grants, work-study aid and low-interest student loans.\n\nOur office advises students on tuition and fees, the overall cost of your education and how to find aid through OHSU or other sources.\n\nOur personal finance and debt counselors also work with you to create an educational debt management plan so that you have a better understanding of your budget, obligations and options after graduation.\n\nFor help navigating the financial aid process, reach out to our team at finaid@ohsu.edu or 503-494-7800.\n\nNote to Current 2025 Cycle Applicants\n\nThe 2025 OHSU Secondary Application is now being rolled out to applicants with verified AMCAS Primary Applications. Once an applicant's fully verified AMCAS Primary Application is received by us, our office will email a link to our OHSU Secondary Application.\n\nNote that we do NOT pre-screen for minimum requirements -- nor do we look at any primaries until after a secondary is received.\n\nAfter your OHSU Secondary Application has been submitted, please continue to check the Admissions Portal for the status of your application.\n\nBe sure to add mdadmin@ohsu.edu to your safe senders list. Please check your junk/spam folder. We have been finding issues with Gmail.\n\nAdmissions AMA (\"Ask Me Anything\")\n\nAre you applying to OHSU's MD Program in the current 2025 cycle?
