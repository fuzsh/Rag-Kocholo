        "text": "A spot award is a spur-of-the-moment employee recognition for employee performance and exemplary behavior as and when it happens. The prize can be both monetary and non-monetary. It is used as a retention tool to let employees know their efforts have been recognized and reinforce the organization’s values.\n\nThe two characteristics of a spot award are:\n\nIt is instant – The award is given at the moment. Recognizing an employee three months after their performance would not be considered a spot award. The word spot indicates the award is given “on the spot.”\n\nMonetary and non-monetary – Employees can receive non-monetary recognition (such as a certificate) or monetary (cash, bonus, gift certificates, etc.)\n\nA good spot award program has a balance between monetary and non-monetary incentives.\n\nSpot award examples\n\nNon-monetary spot award examples\n\nSocial media shout-out – To recognize an employee by giving them praise on company social media platforms.\n\nWall of fame – A wall, in the office or virtual, is used to put up photos of employees doing great work.\n\nEnjoy a meal on the company – Giving an employee a free lunch, for example, paid for by the company.\n\nRotating trophy – A trophy that can recognize an employee who exemplifies a particular value or goes beyond the call of duty on the job. It can be given to a different employee every week or month.\n\nSpontaneous treats – Giving employees free coffee or snacks.\n\nVirtual party – Throwing an on-the-spot virtual party to recognize either a team or individual achievement for remote workers.\n\nCompany swag – Giving an employee branded employee goods, such as a hoodie, mug, or notebook.\n\nMonetary spot award examples\n\nGift card – A relevant gift card for a particular store for shopping, travel, or dining.\n\nCash incentive – Money awarded to the employee on the spot.\n\nPaid vacation leave – An extra day of paid vacation leave is granted to the employee.\n\nWhen to give spot awards\n\nConsider the following acts to be noteworthy for a spot award:\n\nGoing beyond the call of duty to help a customer or complete a project.\n\nImplementation of a creative idea to solve a problem.\n\nVoluntarily taking the lead on a project.\n\nConsistent exhibition of one of the values of the organization.\n\nAssisting a peer when they are struggling.\n\nSpot awards best practices\n\nEnsure your spot award program is practiced consistently and fairly to avoid overly competitive behavior.\n\nDo not use it as a replacement for annual bonus awards.\n\nEnsure social visibility. In other words, make a big deal about it. A spot award is a proud moment for an employee, and sharing it with a larger group will amplify its importance.\n\nConsider leveraging technology, such as an internal employee recognition platform, email, and social media.\n\nEmpower line managers with the necessary toolkits to properly use spot awards.\n\nAvoid awarding it to the same employee all the time.\n\nEnsure that you communicate the process of spot awards in a transparent way.\n\nCreate a threshold for managers to ensure the awards are in line with the company budget.\n\nDownload Free Resource:"
