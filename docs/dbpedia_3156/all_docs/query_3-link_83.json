        "text": "Students in health-related undergraduate, masters and doctoral programs can train alongside active duty officers during their school breaks as part of the Junior Commissioned Officer Student Training and Extern Program. Participants are paid, and receive health benefits, housing and travel allowances. Programs last between 30 and 120 days. Participants become inactive Public Health Service officers upon completing the program and can activate upon graduation. There is no obligation to join the USPHS Commissioned Corps.\n\nIn the Senior Commissioned Officer Student Training and Extern Program, students entering their final year of graduate school or professional training get paid while in school in exchange for committing to enroll in the USPHS Commissioned Corps upon graduation. Students receive the basic pay and allowances of an Ensign while in the program and are guaranteed a spot in the USPHS Commissioned Corps upon graduation. The service obligation is equal to twice the time sponsored.\n\nOnly the School of Medicine at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) can claim the title, “America’s Medical School.” The F. Edward Hébert School of Medicine was established in 1972 to assure the Armed Forces and U.S. Public Health Service would have a steady supply of physician-leaders to provide the backbone for their medical corps and serve the nation. Established by Congress in 1972, the university’s close proximity to the National Institutes of Health, the National Library of Medicine, and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center make it a unique location for medical education and research. With over 8,000 USU School of Medicine alumni, graduates are not simply doctors, researchers, and scholars; they are leaders, innovators, and public servants committed to a mission far greater than themselves.\n\nThe Indian Health Service (IHS) pharmacy residencies offer an excellent opportunity to learn and improve the healthcare of Native Americans. Each of the IHS pharmacy residency programs offers unique and rewarding experiences. In addition to learning in a progressive practice setting, you can experience cultural diversity and recreational opportunities. While most programs are conducted over one year, several IHS pharmacy residency programs are conducted as two-year, non-traditional programs. Enjoy learning in a multidisciplinary and friendly team environment!\n\nEpidemic Intelligence Service (EIS)/Laboratory Leadership Service (LLS) Program\n\nEIS is a long-standing, globally-recognized fellowship program renowned for its investigative and emergency response efforts. EIS officers serve on the front lines of public health, protecting Americans and the global community while training under the guidance of seasoned mentors. When disease outbreaks or other public health threats emerge, EIS officers investigate, identify the cause, rapidly implement control measures, and collect evidence to recommend preventive actions.\n\nCDC’s Laboratory Leadership Service (LLS) was launched in 2015 to develop future public health laboratory leaders. LLS is a service-learning, multidimensional program that encompasses the competencies of applied public health laboratory research, laboratory operations and quality management, the science of biosafety, bioinformatics, advanced communications, and leadership training. A LLS fellow’s training helps bridge applied laboratory science with public health, allowing fellows to provide daily mission-critical technical expertise and service to federal, state, and local public health laboratories and support public health investigations."
