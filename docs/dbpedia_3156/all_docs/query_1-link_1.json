        "text": "Plan\n\nPremium family\n\nCountry\n\nUS\n\nDevice\n\n(iPhone xs\n\nOperating System\n\nIdk whatever iOS they on now\n\nMy Question or Issue\n\nI have had Spotify since it came out; I upgraded to a premium plan with my family in 2018. The decision to stop supporting Car Thing breaks my heart. My truck doesn't have bluetooth or a display so when Spotify Car Thing came out I was ecstatic. I love Spotify I have always thought it was way better than apple music because they would try to make**bleep** like the car thing and they weren't some huge heartless corporation like apple. But this and the fact that our premium plan gets raised a dollar all the time has made me rethink my position.\n\nMy whole family uses I phones and have been discussing switching to apple music for YEARS. I WAS ALWAYS THE ONE TO KEEP THEM WITH SPOTIFY. Now I am over it if you don't make this right and my car thing stops working in December we will be switching to apple music.\n\nThe recent annoucement on the decision to make existing Car Thing users' devices completely inoperable in Decembe is unconscionable. I've been using my Car Thing ever since I was an early bird adopter and got the device for free maybe 3-4 years ago. It's been an absolutely incredible device and breathed new life into my older car that doesn't have Apple Car Play. I know that they discontinued production of the device quite a long time ago, but I was happy because the device still functioned normally. So why all of a sudden would they make the device not function altogether? It's EXTREMELY disappointing to have it just remotely rendered completely useless. I hope Spotify can shed light on why it's seemingly impossible to just let the devices keep functioning\n\nI’ve had the Car Thing since 2021 when I first came out — I paid $50 for it. Now three years later, they’re discontinuing it??\n\nI have used this thing RELIGIOUSLY every day since I’ve got it — it helps when my car has Bluetooth but is old enough that it doesn’t have a great user interface and so the CarThing made it more streamlined. Especially as an Apple user, when Siri would always glitch and not change my music correctly — and now I’ll have no presets for playlists.\n\nEven driving Uber, my passengers would be able to seamlessly request music and it would make their ride more enjoyable — many also asked what the device was because they’d never seen it.\n\nNeedless to say I am extremely disappointed — I would go so far to say I would pay an extra fee to keep my CarThing active, the software can’t be that complicated . . .\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nI agree, I have two of them and they are absolutely perfect for late-model vehicles. There is no percievable reason why it is necessary to make it \"no longer work\". Sure, you can make it discontinued and tell people that it will not receive further updates but I do not see why it should \"stop\" working entirely.\n\nAt a minimum release the firmware as open source so people can continue using it. In fact, I have half a mind to start dumping it and reverse engineering them because they are so useful it would be a shame for them to become e-waste.\n\nWhy in the world would you stop operating a product that you put out? And then not offer a trade in, compensation, or SOMETHING? I have two car things that will now essentially be useless, just a block of plastic. This was a move filled by greed, they just want to sell us something new and get the most money they can out of it. I’ve also been saying spotify premium for years, most people who use spotify also have been using premium for years. We are probably the most loyal customers and now you are trying to scam us out of our money in THIS economy?"
