        "text": "Story\n\n12 September 2023\n\nThe 2023 UN SDGs Summit – What does it mean for ordinary Samoans?\n\nCome next week, Prime Minister of Samoa, the Honorable Fiame Naomi Mataafa will take a stand at the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Summit in New York, as one of the leaders of the 193 member states of the UN, to proclaim Samoa’s commitments as a nation, towards accelerating the implementation of the SDGs. Taking place on the 18th and the 19th of September at the UN headquarters in New York, this is a crucial convening, considering the setbacks in the implementation of Agenda 2030 (the SDGs). Ahead of the UN SDGs Summit, the Government of Samoa with the UN Country Team in Apia recently held a national consultation on the SDGs. Samoa is the second country in the Pacific region to host such a significant consultation, and this is a vital step in its preparations for the Summit. It is a remarkable demonstration of the government's unwavering dedication to achieve the SDGs, and these SDGs are embodied in the Government of Samoa development aspirations to foster harmony, safety and freedom for all its people. The SDGs resonates with Samoa’s development priorities to foresee the creation of communities that are empowered and resilient and to inspire growth. On the other hand, Samoa’s national development contributes to the SDGs underlying aspirations of a world where people live in peace and enjoy prosperity from a planet that is safe and protected. As we reach the halfway point towards achieving the SDGs by 2030, the UN, in collaboration with member countries, is conducting a comprehensive evaluation of progress and challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted SDGs’ achievements. The recent SDG Progress Report shows that just 12 percent of the SDGs are targets are on track. Progress on 50 per cent is weak and insufficient. Alarmingly, we have stalled or gone into reverse on more than 30 per cent of the SDGs, globally. Assessing Samoa’s implementation progress against the SDGs targets and its aligned national development strategy is therefore of paramount importance to the people of Samoa. At Samoa's national SDGs consultations held on the 5th of September, the government presented its 2020 VNR, which highlighted both progress and challenges. The pandemic disrupted income generation, increased poverty, violence against women and children, food insecurity, and mental health issues. Samoa’s GDP fell by over 9 percent. These insights underscore the need for strategic investments to reignite progress on SDGs. In a context where the needs are abundant and resources are constrained, it is important to consider prioritization of key investments that would have the most positive spillover effects on other areas of need. Based on the UN’s analysis and the discussion at the national consultation, Samoa should consider prioritizing investments in food systems, job creation, social care, biodiversity and climate change. These investments not only address key challenges but also yield positive effects, including reducing violence against women. It is crucial for citizens to understand the implications of these decisions and actively engage in national development planning and SDGs policy discussions. The SDGs Summit provides a platform for governments to showcase their commitments, and it is where we can gauge whether these commitments will reverse the negative trajectory before 2030. The implementation of these commitments will require partnerships with all stakeholders and ordinary citizens also have an important role to play in the realization of the SDGs. Now let’s turn back to what the SDGs are all about. The 17 SDGs embody the aspirations of global leaders for a world marked by peace, equality, and prosperity for all, regardless of gender, religion, ethnicity, race, age, nationality, sexual orientation, geographical location or any other differences. The SDGs provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. They provide benchmarks for realizing this vision and serve as a basis for dialogue between governments and their partners on development cooperation. Crucially, the SDGs underpin regional development strategies such as the 2050 strategy for the Blue Pacific continent as well as national development strategies, ensuring that the pursuit of regional and local goals aligns with global priorities. Samoa’s commitment to realizing Agenda 2030 is evident since it is one of the few small islands developing states (SIDS) that have submitted voluntary national reviews (VNRs) on SDGs achievement. By expressing its dedication to present its third VNR in 2024, Samoa aims to be among the few countries worldwide actively participating in this reporting process. But how much does the average Samoan citizen fully understand about the value and significance of the SDGs and the upcoming SDGs Summit? That is crucial. The 2019 survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF), tells us that the global awareness of the SDGs is relatively high, with 74 percent of adults being aware of them. Nonetheless, awareness levels vary significantly from country to country. There is a significant opportunity to raise awareness among Samoans about the importance of the SDGs, what they represent, and their relevance to daily life, and the United Nations is willing to partner and provide this support as relevant and resourceful as needed. Themba Kalua, UN Resident Coordinator - Samoa, Cook Islands, Niue, and Tokelau\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n06 September 2023\n\nAct now and act together to progress the 17 Goals.\n\nEight years ago, world leaders of the United Nations’ member states, were bold and adopted a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These 17 goals whilst complex and ambitious, when combined would help us realise a world where no one is left behind. A world where life is fulfilling with just governing systems, where everyone enjoys good health, are well-educated and earns sufficient income. A world where food is abundant and nutritious, the cost of energy is affordable and the environment is safe and protected. In the heart of such a world, are people that are safe and resilient to adapt and thrive, no matter what shakes the core of their existence. But that dream of such a world through the 17 SDG to come true by 2030, is not progressing as expected. Earlier this year, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed his grave concerns on SDGs achievement; “Halfway to the deadline for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we are leaving more than half the world behind.” “The SDG Progress Report shows that just 12 per cent of the Sustainable Development Goal targets are on track. Progress on 50 per cent is weak and insufficient. Worst of all, we have stalled or gone into reverse on more than 30 per cent of the SDGs.” “Unless we act now, the 2030 Agenda will become an epitaph for a world that might have been.” The call to act now and to act together, moved the UN Country Team in Samoa to immediately convene national SDG consultations with the countries they serve including Cook Islands, Niue, Samoa and Tokelau, in response to the UN SG’s concerns on lack of SDGs progress.The UNCT Samoa in collaboration with Samoa’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade coordinated the Consultation bringing together the members of Samoa’s SDGs Taskforce and the UN at the Lava Hotel on Tuesday 5th of September, 2023. The Chief Executive Officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peseta Noumea Simi reiterated in her official remarks at the opening of the Samoa SDG Consultation that accelerating progress of the SDGs requires robust approaches, collective and meaningful engagement of all partners. She added that this consultation is important because it enables genuine dialogue on Samoa’s efforts to localise the SDGs, and their integration and implementation through government’s national development priorities. The UN Resident Coordinator Themba Kalua acknowledged the leadership of the Government of Samoa and their commitment to fast track progress of the 17 SDGs goals, whilst emphasising that the ‘UN is very clear that the focus of SDGs acceleration efforts is entirely up to the Government of Samoa.’ Available indicators shows that the major challenges with SDGs progression for Samoa appears to surround the advancement of gender equality, reducing hunger, protecting life on land, and stimulating decent jobs and growth. Mapping Samoa’s SDGs challenges to the UN’s six areas for SDGs acceleration, and considering the SDGs interlinkages, suggests emphasis on investments in food systems, social protection and jobs, and biodiversity and nature to spur catalytic SDGs progress in Samoa. A UN Policy Brief concluded that it would cost Samoa approximately 16% of its GDP per year to achieve this, if it intended to progress all of its SDGs targets by 2030. Noting that the costs for SDGs achievement seemed unrealistic, a key recommendation following the UN’s discussion with the SDGs Taskforce was for the government to also focus its SDGs acceleration efforts on health and education, particularly given the high rates of NCDs and the shortage of labour on island being exacerbated by seasonal employment schemes. The Taskforce also stressed that the private sector and civil society should not be left behind in these discussions and decisions on the SDGs, given that such discussions are at the foundation of the key messages that Samoa will articulate at the global SDG Summit in later this month. Samoa completed its second Voluntary National Review of the SDGs in 2020 and is preparing for its third, which should be ready for circulation in 2024\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n10 April 2023\n\nPam, driving the vehicle of change for community women movements.\n\nFuatino Pam Sua or affectionately known as ‘Pam’ first became involved in the business of the Samoa National Council Women (SNCW), simply by being the driver for its founding President, Masiofo Fetauimalemau Mataafa. In 1972, I was sent home after schooling in New Zealand. While in NZ, I taught myself how to drive. Thankfully, it was my driving skills that the late Masiofo Fetauimalemau, called me to drive her around and do the bidding of the old ladies of the SNCW, taking them to meetings and so forth. I enjoyed the driving because I also got to sit in, listen and understand the governance and operations of the Council. Most important was the relationships with the old ladies and the knowledge and wisdom shared amongst them that I even learnt so much from it. Some years later, Pam was assigned the role of managing the SNCW finances. Fast forward to 2012, just before Samoa’s celebration of its independence, Pam was organizing lunch and making transportation arrangements for the SNCW members from Savaii and Upolu. I was about to leave, but the Hon. Fiame Naomi, the daughter of the late Masiofo Fetauimalemau and the President of the SNCW called me over and said, “before you leave, you’ve just been appointed the new secretary”. That day my responsibilities multiplied. I am in charge of managing the organization and trying to live up to the expectations and vision of the Samoan matriarchs that came before us and paved the way for the women’s movement in Samoa for generations that followed. Pam is at the heart of mobilizing and uniting women from the villages around Samoa under the umbrella of the SNCW and she was involved for over fifty years. The SNCW was set up in 1953 and is an umbrella organization for village women’s committees in Samoa. The SNCW is premised on the value of Samoan women’s traditional statuses and social standing, namely ‘Sa’o Ao (daughters of village men and women), faletua ma tausi (wives of paramount chiefs and orators), and āvā a taulele’a (wives of untitled men). This social group plays an integral role in supporting the village’s local governance with its developments and advocacies filtering across to the other influential players of the village, namely, the village council, untitled men and the youth. In 2015, the SNCW embarked on an institutional strengthening programme to redefine its purpose and review the organization’s constitution and to explore whether its purpose and existence was still relevant. At the time, the SNCW was a member of the CRC and CEDAW Partnership Committees coordinated under the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development (MWCSD). One of the key development issues requiring a whole-of country approach, was family violence. The SNCW received funding from the Government of Australia to fund the Samoa Shaping Women’s Development programme through MWCSD to implement a nationwide advocacy campaign on the prevention of violence against women and girls using traditional learning methods through the art of community conversations. Spearheaded with technical assistance from Palanitina Tupuimatagi Toelupe, 41 villages were covered, and we collaborated with the women’s committees, women’s church fellowship, including youth groups to deliver this advocacy with the hope that the women themselves will drive their own destiny and facilitate social change through this movement. This community-centered programme was our steppingstone into reviving our focus on ending violence against women and girls (EVAWG) and linking it to good governance and leadership. Building on from the momentum in 2015, the support from the EU & UN Spotlight Initiative in 2020 has elevated this work with 16 women’s committees from Upolu and Savaii engaging and joining in the movement. The Spotlight’s involvement added weight to the community conversations to strengthen the advocacy of eliminating violence against women and girls. And the Spotlight focus was through leadership programmes to empower the women’s committees to gain confidence as they are the gatekeepers of what is happening within their own communities. Contextualized trainings were offered to women members of the SNCW on EVAWG using the transformational leadership tool to advocate and disseminate the information and learnings to women in their villages to address violence against women and girls including intimate partner violence. Our training content and practical exercises worked on confidence and advocacy building within their own women’s committee settings and when advocating for support from the village council of chiefs. For instance, they were reminded through the programme to remember and understand the order of the Alii ma Faipule – village council of chiefs. There was nothing worse than coming in only just to be chased out. The Spotlight Initiative programme was well received, the lessons learned, and the work of the trained women was effective to create awareness and advocacy for other committees to grow the need and the urge to be part of the SNCW. A testimony from Mrs Vine Sefo Samia, Samatau Council Women, participant in the SNCW leadership trainings – Spotlight gave us the tools to run our own advocacy activities in the village reaching all age groups, especially the young men and women, who have a better understanding than before. We visit families and encourage mothers to not be afraid to speak out and seek help. We encourage open communication and dialogue between the mothers and their daughters on sexual reproductive health and rights of women and girls, and how to prevent sexual and physical violence. We lobbied for leadership and good governance support from our Alii and Faipule and church ministers which led to having in place village policy and laws to address violence against women and girls, we remind the families and fathers about their duty to protect and keep the peace in the village. Conversations are being made, collaborations amongst the traditional structures of the village and women have been made stronger. We do not see nor hear of any new incidents of violence these are the good changes that have come about due to the strong advocacy by the women of the Samatau council. We cannot afford to be complacent, we have to continue the advocacy as we are the Spotlight champions in our village to effect the change in norms, attitudes and behavior to end violence. The leadership training was to advance the work we had already started and become self-reliant to not wait for handouts but to stand up and lead from the home and from the community, to be caregivers and oversee their communities and the issues that pertain to women and girls. This all tied in when in times of crisis especially when the measles epidemic hit Samoa in 2019, the committees mobilized into action in terms of ensuring sanitation and caring support to prevent the spread of measles amongst our most vulnerable groups, our children. The Spotlight Initiative-UNDP partnership with SNCW dovetailed into the community conversation programme and expanded it. The leadership programme under Spotlight allowed the committees of women and girls to flourish and build confidence in themselves to such a degree it enabled them to lobby, speak out and empower the traditional village setting to listen and consider their needs and issues. Women and girls must lead from the front, because they are the ones who understand what is needed and to collaborate with each other, amplify and complement each other’s work. They have the capacity and know how to carry out their work and the leadership programme through the Spotlight Initiative brought about the change in confidence and know-how to be the voice for women, girls, and children. We utilized the Samoan ways and tools we have in place to put a focus on bringing to light the violence against women, girls and children and advocating for a better change. \"As you witnessed, our perseverance bore fruit with the President of the SNCW becoming the first woman Prime Minister for this country.” The rest is history.

Samoa and Zimbabwe are the only AccLabs selected from a pool of 91 UNDP AccLabs across the world. The Challenge will enable the UNDP Samoa AccLab to implement an innovative project to convert fish skin into sustainable fish leather. This project aims to maximize the economic benefits of the entire fish caught, instead of just the flesh whilst discarding other fish parts, thus lending the project its name: “100% Fish Use”. The fish leather will be manufactured through a sustainable process. The eco-friendly fish leather is an exotic leather and will be an addition to the existing Samoan handicrafts/products such as wallets, business card holders and other items, popular as souvenirs. There is also a huge demand for fish leather overseas and this has the potential to increase additional avenues for export. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) AccLab is partnering with Think Sea Corp, a Japanese company, to implement this project through funding from the Japan Cabinet Office (CAO). This Challenge is facilitated by the Japan Innovation Network. The contract between UNDP Samoa and Think Sea Corps was signed in March 2023 and the project is now ready for implementation. “Over 40 to 60% of the caught fish is currently being dumped or underused. Furthermore, there is very little data on the amount of fish waste generated in Samoa. This project, in addition to assigning economic value to fish waste, will also boost the data on fish waste,” said Jorn Sorensen, Resident Representative, UNDP Samoa. The founders of the Think Sea Corp will spend two months in Samoa to experiment with the fish skin type available locally and create samples of leather. They will also train the target communities on the low-cost process of leather production, enabling communities to take up new entrepreneurial opportunities of producing, utilizing, and selling fish leather. \"We are thrilled to embark on this project to contribute to the protection of the marine environment and sustainable development with the team at UNDP Samoa. As awareness of the importance of marine conservation continues to grow, we take great pride in being able to support sustainable economic development while making use of ocean resources. Through this project, we hope to make valuable contributions to the local communities by leveraging our respective expertise and skills to pursue meaningful impact,” said Tomohisa Noguchi, Founder, Think Sea Corp. The 100% Fish Use project is a critical milestone for Samoa not only in terms of expanding the blue economy, but also a successful example of connecting technology and innovation from the private sector to local contexts, accelerating progress on the SDGs. -ENDS- For media queries, please contact: Tomohisa Noguchi, Think Sea Corp, totoleather@gmail.com, https://www.tototoleather.com/en Laufaleaina Lesa, UNDP Multi Country Office, Samoa|Tel. +685 23670|E: laufaleaina.lesa@undp.org www.ws.undp.org @UNDP in Samoa, Cook Islands, Tokelau & Niue @undpsamoa\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n23 August 2024\n\nSamoa Hands Over New Wing of One UN House to UN During Secretary-General Guterres' Visit\n\nThe Government of Samoa officially handed over the new wing of the One UN House at Tuanaimato to the United Nations on Friday, to coincide with the visit to the country by the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. The United Nations moved to its current location at Tuanaimato in 2017, when the Government of Samoa handed over one of the main facilities used for the UN’s Third SIDS Conference, hosted by Samoa in 2014. “It is the hope that the new wing will enable and complete the merge of all UN agencies to follow the structural framework for the Samoa Multi-Country Office and to work collectively as the UN country team on the ground to deliver on the national development needs of Samoa and for the whole cluster including Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau,” said Hon. Toeolesulusulu Cedric Schuster, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, who represented the Government of Samoa at the handover. There are currently 15 UN agencies operating in Samoa, most of which are housed in the One UN premises, while others are spread out at different strategic locations around Apia.The completion of the new wing will bring together more UN agencies under the common premises and will significantly advance the Secretary General’s efficiency agenda as part of the UN reform on the repositioning of the UN development system. “This visit is not just about paying tribute and solidarity for the people of Samoa, but also a visit of gratitude. Gratitude to the Government of Samoa that has provided the UN with absolutely fantastic premises. It is remarkable that despite all the challenges the Government faces, the generosity with which it has allowed the UN to work in such fantastic premises deserves not only gratitude but great admiration,” said Secretary General, Guterres. “I thank the government and people of Samoa for their warm welcome and exceptional hospitality. It is a privilege to visit this beautiful island. To experience its rich culture. And to witness both its immense resilience and its extreme vulnerability. Samoa is a firm friend of the United Nations and an active supporter of multilateralism. I applaud your fierce advocacy for climate justice in international climate negotiations, and your commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals.”The SG’s visit to the One UN House also coincided with the launch of the UN joint programme, “Catalyzing the Samoa National Food Systems Transformation Agenda through Collective Action”, funded by the joint SDG fund. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Hon. Laauli Leuatea Polataivao, and the Minister of Health, Hon. Valasi Tafito Selesele launched the initiative in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Secretary General’s two-day visit to Samoa affirms the UN’s solidarity with Samoa, and the Pacific region, as it navigates complex challenges such as the existential threat of climate change.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n16 July 2024\n\nOrnamental flowers enrich vulnerable families.\n\nBlooming flowers and warm smiles welcomed Mr. David McLachlan-Karr, the Regional Director of the UN Development Coordination Office for Asia and the Pacific, as he stepped out of the car to greet women growers of the Fa'alapotopotoga o Aiga Ma'ale'ale (FAMA).FAMA is an association of vulnerable families with low-income backgrounds living in the urban areas of Samoa.Malaeolela Valerie Tuia, a member of FAMA who led the welcoming party, introduced David to the women growers of the association. David, who hails from Queensland, Australia, and comes from a family with a farming history, felt an immediate connection with these passionate growers. Each woman had a unique story. About the challenges they faced as urban families, due to the impacts of climate change, limited urban land availability, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.Yet, they all share a common goal, which is to improve their livelihoods, through their love for gardening unique and exotic flowers. Listening intently, David was inspired by how their struggles had turned into ingenuity. Valerie explained how they came together to explore opportunities for project assistance to support their passion for growing and marketing high-value exotic ornamental varieties to generate income. In 2023, the Global Environment Facility – Small Grants Programme (GEF-SGP) UNDP, awarded the FAMA with a grant to implement their \"Women leading community ornamental project for improved livelihoods.\" This project focuses on high-value exotic orchids, in high demand locally and usually sold between $150 to $300 Samoan Tala per plant. The FAMA members under this project, have received essential training, and tools including greenhouse materials, sprayers, wheelbarrows, and shovels. David was then invited to tour one of the greenhouses operated by Kaloline Key Schuster, where he observed the meticulous care given to each plant. Kaloline proudly showcased her thriving orchids, sharing how she earned over $1,000 Samoan Tala weekly, from selling these exquisite flowers, with each orchid fetching around $130 Samoan Tala. \"This project has transformed our lives,\" Kaloline said with a smile. \"We are grateful to the GEF SGP UNDP for this opportunity. The income from selling orchids supports our families, even during tough times like cyclones and floods.\"“Right now, we are selling the flowers but we look forward to the second phase of our project, where we will sell the orchid plants themselves, so other vulnerable women can also buy from us and grow their own ornamental gardens,” Kaloline added.\"We've now included vegetables to support food security for our women,\" Karoline added,” but tending to these flowers brings happiness that is crucial for our mental well-being.\"Moved by their dedication and resilience, David saw how their work provided not just financial stability but also community and purpose and he kindly acknowledged the crucial role that the GEF SGP UNDP, has played in empowering these women to enhance their livelihoods and improve the vulnerabilities of their families and communities.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n10 July 2024\n\nRegional Director Embraces Campus of Hope's Role in Ending Violence Against Women and Girls.\n\nOn a recent visit to Samoa, the Regional Director of the United Nations Development Coordination Office (UN DCO) for Asia and the Pacific, David Mclachlan-Karr had the opportunity to witness firsthand the profound impact of the Campus of Hope, and the vital role the United Nations (UN) agencies play, in supporting its mission.The Campus of Hope is a sanctuary under the Samoa Victim Support Group (SVSG). This shelter is not just a refuge but a haven of hope for a new life free of violence and pain.It houses over 100 children, and over 50 women, and girls who have endured the harsh realities of violence. Mclachlan-Karr’s visit was an eye-opening journey, into the heart of a community-driven initiative that addresses gender equality and violence against women through a unique blend of modern intervention and traditional values. The Campus of Hope symbolises the power of collective effort and the enduring spirit of Fa’a Samoa – the Samoan way of life, which emphasizes love, respect, and communal harmony.As Maclachlan-Karr walked through the gates of the Campus of Hope accompanied by Themba Kalua, the UN Resident Coordinator and UN colleagues in Samoa, they were greeted by the vibrant energy and the serene smiles of Siliniu Lina Chang, or Mama Lina. The woman with genuine passion and love who built and sustained Campus of Hope. Painted yellow as the colour that symbolises bright life, each corner of the Campus echoed stories of resilience and transformation, where pain and trauma are gently being replaced with hope and healing.The Campus of Hope was established by the SVSG in 2006. A year after Mama Lina founded the SVSG to support victims of domestic violence and abuse in Samoa. The work of SVSG expanded to legal and healthcare support by 2010, and gained international recognition in 2012. The SVSG’s approach is multifaceted, integrating various programs designed to educate and rehabilitate its residents. While Mclachlan-Karr was deeply engaged in discussions with the SVSG Management and the UN colleagues, he could hear the children’s laughter as they played cheerfully with their musical instruments. Music classes are besides their academic classes, arts, handicrafts and cooking classes. Their programmes and activities are also therapeutic, providing the tools and support needed for personal growth and recovery. Mclachlan-Karr was particularly moved by the spirit that drives the SVSG in addressing gender equality and ending violence against women and girls. The UN agencies play a crucial role in this partnership, providing resources, expertise, and support to bolster the shelter's efforts. Their involvement ensures that the SVSG can offer comprehensive services, from legal assistance and healthcare to psychological counselling, vocational training and entrepreneurship opportunities. This holistic approach is essential in addressing the complex needs of survivors and paving the way for long-term recovery and empowerment.Pepe Tevaga, the Communications Manager of the SVSG, highlighted the extensive support received from various UN agencies through the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative and other mandatory programs.During the COVID-19 pandemic, SVSG experienced a significant increase in domestic violence incidents, reflecting the heightened prevalence and severity of domestic violence incidents. In response, the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative, through UNDP, supported SVSG in establishing the helpline number 800-7874. This helpline has greatly improved access to immediate support for victims, offering timely interventions and comprehensive assistance. Its success has also attracted international partnerships and funding, enhancing SVSG's capacity to support more victims effectively.Under the Spotlight Initiative, with support from UNESCO, SVSG developed a mobile app for case management to enhance support for domestic violence victims. This app securely handles sensitive data, allows real-time updates, provides easy access to resources, enables data analysis for better service and advocacy, and features a user-friendly interface, significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of SVSG's case management efforts.Moreover, the Spotlight Initiative has enabled UNFPA to support SVSG in delivering Family Life Education (FLE) programs to community-based youth. These programs provide comprehensive and culturally relevant education on health, relationships, and gender norms, promoting the overall well-being and development of young people in Samoa.In addition, UN Women and ESCAP have collaborated with SVSG to empower women victims of domestic violence through entrepreneurship training and opportunities. As a result, some women have successfully established their businesses, fostering economic independence and resilience.UNICEF, under the Spotlight Initiative and through its agency programs, continues to support SVSG with child protection policies and activities, ensuring the safety and well-being of vulnerable children.Mclachlan-Karr acknowledged the support of the UN but emphasized the dedication of the SVSG and its management in providing support for victims of violence in Samoa.As the discussions and visit ended, Mclachlan-Karr left the SVSG with a deep appreciation for the incredible work being done to combat violence against women and girls. His visit highlights the importance of supporting and uplifting initiatives like SVSG, which indeed, is a spotlight towards a path to hope and healing for those who had suffered from violence, and the passion of those committed to ending violence against women, girls and children. *As per SVSG Child Protection Policy, it is prohibited to take photos of children, women and girls housed at the campus unless given special permission.\n\n1 of 5\n\nPress Release\n\n25 August 2024\n\nUN Secretary General Remarks at the One UN House in Samoa.\n\nTalofa,I thank the government and people of Samoa for their warm welcome and exceptional hospitality. It is a privilege to visit this beautiful island. To experience its rich culture. And to witness both its immense resilience and its extreme vulnerability.Samoa is a firm friend of the United Nations and an active supporter of multilateralism. I applaud your fierce advocacy for climate justice in international climate negotiations, and your commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals.Yet, like many Pacific countries, Samoa is caught in a storm of rising prices, rising seas, and rising geopolitical tensions – compounded by an ailing ocean and woefully insufficient finance. The average rate of sea level rise has more than doubled since the 1990s.Today's rate of increase is unprecedented in at least 3,000 years and likely, since the dawn of civilization, 12 000 years ago. During my visit, I spent time with communities threatened by the rising ocean. High and rising sea level pose an enormous threat to Samoa, the Pacific, and other Small Island Developing States. These challenges demand resolute international action.The climate crisis is the gravest threat facing this country and this region – and, quite possibly, the world.This region, the Pacific, contributes 0.02 per cent of global emissions.Yet you are on the front lines of the climate crisis, dealing with extreme weather events from raging tropical cyclones to record ocean heatwaves.Sea levels are rising even faster than the global average, posing an existential threat to millions of Pacific islanders. People are suffering. Economies are being battered.And entire territories face annihilation.The injustice is appalling.But Pacific islands are not only climate victims. They are leaders.And Samoa has built extraordinary resilience through Fa'asamoa.Many countries in this region are at the fore of ambition and action.And the world must match them.The fate of the Pacific depends on limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We need the G20 – the biggest emitters – out in front:Phasing out fossil fuels – fairly.And ending fossil fuel expansion – immediately.All countries must produce new national climate action plans – or Nationally Determined Contributions – by next year, aligned with the 1.5-degree limit on global temperature increase.And we need climate justice – starting with major contributions to the new Loss and Damage fund, and ensuring that every person is protected by lifesaving early warning systems by [2027]. We also need a massive increase in finance.In Samoa, and around the world, lack of funds has put ambitious plans for climate action and sustainable development on hold.We need to simplify access to concessional finance and massively increase the sums available.We need to reform the Multilateral Development Banks, to massively increase their lending capacity and enable them to leverage far more private finance for development at affordable rates.We need action on debt – which is soaking up funds in many developing countries.We have just approved the multi-dimensional vulnerability index. Until no,w a country like Samoa that has huge challenges because it's a middle-income country would not be able to receive any form of concessional funding or any form of debt relief.And so we ask the international community to act in a way that when international financial institutions deal with countries like Samoa, the multi-dimensional vulnerability index is taking into account to allow for concessional funding to be granted for the projects that are necessary for this country to achieve the sustainable development goals and protect its populations against climate change.And we need all countries to honour their promises on climate finance, and a strong finance outcome from this year’s COP where we will discuss the financial commitments after 2025. We also need international action for the ocean.The beating heart of Pacific cultures and economies is being exploited, polluted, and degraded.Climate change, plastic, overfishing and waste are taking a terrible toll.Pacific nations lead the world in ocean stewardship.And globally, countries have now agreed on a better course.I urge all countries to ratify the recent international Agreement on Marine Biodiversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction – to give the ocean, and ocean people, a fighting chance.Dear friends of the media,Climate chaos brings its own security challenges. Meanwhile, international tensions are rising and interest in this region from major powers is mounting.The Pacific is best managed by Pacific islanders. It must never become a forum for geostrategic competition.I urge all countries to seize the chance presented at the Summit of the Future next month to revitalize multilateral institutions and re-boot multilateral solutions.We must equip our international system to meet today’s challenges.And we must push for greater representation – including of Pacific countries, especially in multilateral financial institutions.On all these issues – together – the United Nations stands with the Pacific in calling for justice and change.For global action to support the Blue Continent and the future of its people and take in particular consideration the need to massively increase the funding for adaptation of countries that are already suffering the dramatic impacts of climate change. This is the message I will carry with me to the Pacific Island Forum in Tonga and to the Summit of the Future and the General Assembly in New York.Thank you.\n\n1 of 5"
