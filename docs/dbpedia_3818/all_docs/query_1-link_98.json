Louis-Antoine de Bougainville named them Navigator Islands in 1768. The United States Exploring Expedition (1838-42) reached Samoa in 1839. In 1855 J.C.

The Samoan Civil War of 1886-1894 devolved into the Samoan crisis between colonial powers, followed by the Second Samoan Civil War of 1898-1899, which was resolved by partition of the islands in the Tripartite Convention (resulting in the formal partition of the Samoan archipelago into a German colony and a United States territory), between the United States, Great Britain and Germany.\n\nAfter World War I, German Samoa became a Trust Territory and eventually became independent as Samoa in 1962.\n\nSamoa lies south of the equator, about halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, in the Polynesian region of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n*Reference: Wikipedia"
