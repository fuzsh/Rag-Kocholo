        "text": "By Liam Fox in Apia\n\nDesperate parents are turning to alternative healers in Samoa as a measles epidemic continues to rock the Pacific nation.\n\nA state of emergency was declared this week in a bid to contain the spread of measles, which has claimed 20 lives to date — 19 of them under the age of five.\n\nSamoa's Government has ordered compulsory vaccinations, and a mass immunisation campaign is underway, but authorities fear the situation is going to get worse before it gets better.\n\nThe crisis has seen some parents turning to questionable alternative therapies in a bid to save their children from the disease.\n\nLocal businessman Fritz Alaiasa Neufelt claimed his product, which he called \"Kangen Water\", had healing properties.\n\nMr Neufelt did not claim his water could cure measles, but said spraying it on sick children and getting them to drink it would alleviate the symptoms of the disease.\n\n\"They're feeling good,\" he said. \"The measles are already … not cured, but it's already back to normal,\" he said.\n\nThe product is just tap water put through a filter in his kitchen, but those who had paid for it, like mother Janet Vaitagutu, believed it had helped.\n\n\"It's really good for curing the virus,\" Ms Vaitagutu said.\n\nThe Samoan Government has banned large gatherings to try to contain the measles epidemic, but parents continued showing up seeking Mr Neufelt's treatment.\n\nGovernment issues warning on compulsory vaccinations\n\nHealth authorities were concerned these types of alternative therapies could discourage people from seeking proper medical treatment and getting vaccinated.\n\nThe Government posted a directive to their Facebook page, highlighting compliance with an emergency vaccination order was compulsory.\n\n\"Any person that actively discourages or prevents in any way members of the community from receiving their vaccination injection, is hereby warned, to cease immediately, and is similarly warned not to take any further action of that kind,\" it read.\n\nIn a statement earlier this week, Samoa's Health Ministry said, \"Vaccination provides the best and safest protection against measles\".\n\nThe low vaccination rate was one of the major causes of the deadly epidemic.\n\nLocal officials said only two thirds of the population were immunised, but other estimates put the figure even lower.\n\nLast year, two infants died after two nurses incorrectly mixed and administered the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which was then recalled and temporarily banned by the Government.\n\nGrandmother Mauga Kerita said she went to a free clinic because she was fearful about the spread of the disease.\n\n\"They [are] feeling panicked because it's getting worse,\" she said.\n\nTonga and Fiji are also trying to contain outbreaks, which are believed to have originated in New Zealand, where there are more than 2,000 confirmed cases.\n\nBut much higher vaccination rates meant there had been no deaths in those countries.\n\nEseta Meki's two-year-old son was among those in Samoa who had not been vaccinated. He died on Monday after being rushed to the hospital with a fever and a rash.\n\n\"The nurses tried their best but at the end they told me they couldn't save him,\" Ms Meki told the ABC this week.\n\nShe urged other parents to get their children vaccinated.\n\n\"My advice to parents and people is please take good care of your children.\""
