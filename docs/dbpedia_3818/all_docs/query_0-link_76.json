        "text": "Samoa's newly elected and first female prime minister was locked out of parliament on Monday as the previous leader claimed he was still in charge.\n\nThe move threw the small Pacific nation of 200,000 into a constitutional crisis that could affect its peace and stability and relationship with China.\n\nPrime Minister-elect Fiame Naomi Mata’afa and her supporters had showed up at Parliament on Monday to form a new government but were not allowed inside. They later appointed ministers in a ceremony under a tent outside parliament.\n\nThe nation’s Supreme Court had earlier ordered the parliament to convene. And the constitution requires that lawmakers meet within 45 days of an election, with Monday marking the final day by that count.\n\nBut Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, who was prime minister for 22 years before his unexpected election loss, doesn't appear ready to give up power. He was already one of the longest-serving leaders in the world.\n\nTwo powerful allies have been supporting Tuilaepa.\n\n'Business as usual'\n\nThe nation's head of state, Tuimalealiifano Va'aletoa Sualauvi II, wrote in a proclamation last week that he was suspending Parliament “for reasons that I will make known in due course.\" On Sunday, the Parliament's speaker backed him.\n\nAfter Fiame was locked out on Monday, Tuilaepa held a news conference proclaiming his government remained in charge.\n\nSamoan journalist Lagipoiva Cherelle Jackson translated the back-and-forth into English on Twitter.\n\nAt his news conference, Tuilaepa said: “There is only one government in Samoa, even if we are just the custodian government. We remain in this role and operate business as usual.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Fiame told her supporters: “There will be a time when we will meet again, inside that House. Let us leave it to the law.\"\n\nFiame's election win was seen as a milestone not only for Samoa, which is conservative and Christian, but also for the South Pacific, which has had few female leaders.\n\nAn advocate for women’s equality, Fiame, who was born in 1957, broke new ground during her campaign by going on the road and robustly criticising the incumbent.\n\nShe has pledged to stop a $100 million port development backed by Beijing, calling the project excessive for a nation that's already heavily in debt to China, according to news broadcaster RNZ.\n\nFiame said she intends to maintain good relations with China but has more pressing needs to address, RNZ reported.\n\nLast month's election initially ended in a 25-25 tie between Fiame's FAST Party and Tuilaepa’s HRP Party, with one independent candidate.\n\nThe independent candidate chose to go with Fiame, but meanwhile, the electoral commissioner appointed another HRP candidate, saying it was required to conform to gender quotas.\n\nThat made it 26-26.\n\nThe head of state then stepped in to announce fresh elections to break the tie. Those elections in the nation of 200,000 were scheduled to be held last week.\n\nBut Fiame’s party appealed and the Supreme Court ruled against both the appointed candidate and the plans for the new elections, restoring the FAST Party to a 26-25 majority.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that they hold \"a huge amount of trust and faith in the institutions in Samoa\" and called for the outcome to be \"upheld\".\n\nShe added that despite the \"changeable\" political situation, they had reports of \"relative calm\" among Samoa's people."
