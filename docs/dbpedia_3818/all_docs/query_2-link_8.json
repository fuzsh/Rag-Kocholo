        "text": "1994\n\nNFL creates MTBI Committee\n\nNFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue creates the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury committee, and appoints New York Jets team doctor and rheumatologist Dr. Elliot Pellman as chair, despite lacking any previous experience in brain science.\n\nWhen asked about the issue of concussions in 1994, Pellman tells Newsday:\n\n“‘We discuss it on the list of things every time we have a league meeting … We think the issue of knees, of drugs and steroids and drinking is a far greater problem, according to the number of incidents.”\n\nPellman also tells Sports Illustrated that “concussions are part of the profession, an occupational risk.”\n\nJanuary 1994\n\nTroy Aikman’s concussion\n\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman takes a knee to the head during the 1993 season NFC Championship game, landing him in the hospital that night.\n\nAikman later tells the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he can’t remember the game:\n\n“I didn’t know what planet I was on. I still to this day have no recollection of ever having played in that game. So whenever I see footage of that game, it’s like somebody else is out there doing it.”\n\nAikman’s agent, Leigh Steinberg, visited him in the hospital that night and recalled the story to FRONTLINE.\n\nOctober 1999\n\nNFL Retirement Board rules Mike Webster permanently disabled\n\nThe NFL Retirement Board rules that Mike Webster’s head injuries from his years playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs left him “totally and permanently” disabled as “the result of head injuries he suffered as a football player.” The ruling isn’t made public until it’s uncovered by FRONTLINE/ESPN reporters Steve Fainaru and Mark Fainaru-Wada.\n\nWebster’s attorney, Bob Fitzsimmons, says the ruling shows that the league should’ve known there was a link between football and brain damage.\n\n“It’s pretty devastating evidence,” he said. “If the NFL takes the position that they didn’t know or weren’t armed with evidence that concussions can cause total disability — permanent disability, permanent brain injury — in 1999, that evidence trumps anything they say.”\n\nDecember 1999\n\nMTBI chair says serious brain injuries are a rarity in the NFL\n\nDr. Pellman tells The Chicago Tribune that the MTBI committee’s studies have found that brain injuries in football are relatively uncommon and minor. The paper reports:\n\n“After four years of keeping close track of head injuries, Pellman claims the numbers have remained ‘remarkably the same’ throughout the league. He said there are about 180 ‘incidents’ per year of mild traumatic brain injury. ‘We’re talking the majority are minor injuries,’ Pellman said.”\n\nMay 2000\n\nMTBI members question return to play guidelines\n\nThe New York Times reports that MTBI committee members, along with many NFL doctors, are criticizing the American Academy of Neurology’s 1997 return-to-play guidelines, citing a lack of research to support them.\n\n“We don’t know whether being knocked out briefly is any more dangerous than having amnesia and not being knocked out,” committee member and neurologist Dr. Mark R. Lovell tells the Times. ”We see people all the time that get knocked out briefly and have no symptoms,” he added. ”Others get elbowed, go back to the bench and say, ‘Where am I?'”\n\nNovember 2003\n\nResearchers warn on concussions\n\nDr. Kevin Guskiewicz, a sports medicine researcher at the University of North Carolina, publishes a paper suggesting that repeat concussions may lead to slower recovery of neurological functioning:\n\n“Our study suggests that players with a history of previous concussions are more likely to have future concussive injuries than those with no history; 1 in 15 players with a concussion may have additional concussions in the same playing season; and previous concussions may be associated with slower recovery of neurological function.”\n\nOctober 2003\n\nNFL begins publishing research in scientific journal\n\nThe first of 16 scientific papers by the MTBI Committee, is published in the journal Neurosurgery along with a guest editorial by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. Tagliabue writes:\n\n“We salute our Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee for its leadership and the individuals involved in this project who put in so many hours of work. We are confident that this important new information will continue to advance the cause of improving the safety of profession and amateur athletes on all levels.”\n\nOctober 2004\n\nMTBI disputes research on effects of repeat concussions\n\nThe MTBI committee publishes a paper in Neurosurgery disputing Guskiewicz’s findings. According to the committee:\n\n“They [Guskiewicz et. al.] concluded that there may be an increased risk of repeat concussive injuries and there may be a slower recovery of neurological function after repeat concussions in those have a history of previous concussions. The results of this present NFL study do not support those conclusions.”\n\nThe committee also notes that although brain disease from heads hits is seen in other athletes, such as boxers, there’s no sign of such disease in pro football players.\n\nNovember 2004\n\nMTBI says NFL players are less susceptible to brain injury\n\nThe MTBI committee’s fifth paper in Neurosurgery stirs controversy. It suggests that NFL players have evolved to a state where their brains are less susceptible to injury:\n\n“One of the other processes that may account for some of these differences between NFL players and the general population might be deemed to be a type of artificial selection. Most NFL players have been involved with organized football since junior or senior high school and on through college. It is well known that MTBIs occur at all these levels of the sport. For whatever reasons, certain individuals undoubtedly are more prone to MTBI than others. Some individuals are more prone to delayed or poor recovery after MTBI. These groups may overlap. It is likely that many of these individuals will stop playing organized football before reaching the professional level. They are ‘selected out’ either of their own volition or because their head injuries prevent them from continuing to participate in the sport. As a result of this winnowing process, those players who ultimately play in the NFL are probably less susceptible to MTBI and prolonged post-concussion syndrome than the general population.”\n\nJanuary 2005\n\nMTBI suggests return to play doesn’t increase injury risk\n\nThe MTBI committee publishes another paper in Neurosurgery, concluding that:\n\n“Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season.”\n\nThe committee goes on to argue that its findings might apply to younger athletes.\n\n“Under the right circumstances, specifically with regard to final decision making on return to play being solely at the clinical discretion of a knowledgeable team physician, it might be safe for college/high school football players to be cleared to return to play on the same day as their injury. The authors suggest that, rather than blindly adhering to arbitrary, rigid guidelines, physicians keep an open mind to the possibility that the present analysis of professional football players may have relevance to college and high school players.”\n\nJanuary 2006\n\nMTBI member says Omalu uses “fallacious reasoning”\n\nSteelers team doctor and future member of the MTBI Committee, Dr. Joseph Maroon, tells the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Omalu’s conclusion that Terry Long’s suicide may have been the result of depression caused by head injuries during his career in football was “fallacious reasoning.”\n\n“To go back and say that he was depressed from playing in the NFL and that led to his death 14 years later, I think is purely speculative,” Maroon told the paper. He added:”He could have had a head injury that wasn’t reported before football. He could have had a fight, he could have had a head injury … And that’s why I’m saying it’s so speculative.”\n\nFebruary 2007\n\nPatriots player’s story raises questions about return to play\n\nFormer New England Patriots player Ted Johnson tells The New York Times that in the wake of his retirement, he suffers from memory loss, an addiction to amphetamines and agoraphobia. He dates his problems to two concussions he suffered within a week in August 2002 and says that Coach Bill Belichick sent him back on the field for regular contact play four days later, against the advice of the team’s trainer. Belicheck later told The Boston Globe that Johnson should have told him if he wasn’t able to practice. “If Ted felt so strongly that he didn’t feel he was ready to practice with us, he should have told me,” Belichick said.\n\nMay 2007\n\nResearch shows concussed players at risk for depression\n\nDr. Julian Bailes and Dr. Kevin Guskiewicz release a study on the risk of depression in retired NFL players based on a survey of more than 2500 former players. The paper, published in the Official Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine, concludes:\n\n“… Professional football players with a history of three of more concussions are at a significantly greater risk for having depressive episodes later in life compared with those players with no history of concussion.”\n\nJune 2007\n\nNFL hosts Concussion Summit\n\nNew NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell calls the first league-wide Concussion Summit; attendees include the NFL’s own doctors as well as outside scientists.\n\nA number of outside researchers, including Dr. Bailes and Dr. Guskiewicz, present their findings on the dangers of concussions. Dr. Bailes says his research was dismissed by MBTI committee members.\n\nDuring a press conference following the summit, Goodell touts the accomplishments of NFL doctors and champions the conference as an example of the league’s continued steps towards a better understanding of the science behind head injury.\n\n“And I think one thing that troubles me sometimes, when I see media reports, is that this is something that, all of a sudden, we’ve started to focus on,” says Goodell. “We’ve had this committee for 14 years. We have done terrific work. And our doctors, our scientists have been working at this diligently. So this is not something that’s come to us new.\n\nMBTI committee chair Dr. Ira Casson, meanwhile, tells reporters:\n\n“In my opinion, the only scientifically valid evidence of a chronic encephalopathy in athletes is in boxers and in some Steeplechase jockeys. It’s never been scientifically validly documented in any other athletes… Anecdotes do not make scientifically valid evidence. I am a man of science. I believe in empirically determined scientifically valid data. And that is not scientifically valid data.”\n\nSeptember 2007\n\nNFL issues concussion pamphlet\n\nThe pamphlet says that current research on the long-term impact of concussions is inconclusive:\n\n“Current research with professional athletes has not shown that having more than one or two concussions leads to permanent problems if each injury is managed properly. It is important to understand that there is no magic number for how many concussions is too many. Research is currently underway to determine if there are any long-term effects of concussions in NFL athletes.”\n\nJanuary 2009\n\nScientists crash the Super Bowl\n\nDr. Ann McKee, Chris Nowinski and a team of scientists from the newly formed Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy hold a press conference in Tampa, where the world’s sports media is gathered for the Super Bowl.\n\nAt the press conference, they announce several new cases of CTE, including in Tom McHale, who died of a drug overdose at age 45, as well as in the brain of an 18-year-old high school student who died 10 days after suffering his fourth concussion.\n\nMay 2009\n\nMcKee meets with MTBI Committee\n\nDr. McKee presents her findings to Dr. Ira Casson and members of the MTBI committee at NFL headquarters in New York. Dr. McKee says that the panel was dismissive of her and her research. “It was like, ‘Oh, the girl talked. Now we can get back to some serious business,'” she told FRONTLINE.\n\nCommittee member Dr. Henry Feuer told FRONTLINE that Dr. McKee’s research did not indicate a specific cause for CTE and could not show the prevalence of the disease, given that her findings were based solely on case studies.\n\n“I just have a problem. Ann McKee, she cannot tell me where it’s starting. We don’t know the cause and effect. We don’t know that right now. We don’t know the incidence,” Feuer said. “She was seeing only those that were in trouble. And we know that there are thousands roaming around that are not having problems. So, I think, that’s where we may have had an issue.\n\nSeptember 2009\n\nNFL says study is flawed\n\nNFL spokesman Greg Aiello criticizes the NFL-funded study. As The New York Times reports:\n\n“An N.F.L. spokesman, Greg Aiello, said in an e-mail message that the study did not formally diagnose dementia, that it was subject to shortcomings of telephone surveys and that ‘there are thousands of retired players who do not have memory problems … Memory disorders affect many people who never played football or other sports,’ Mr. Aiello said. ‘We are trying to understand it as it relates to our retired players.'”\n\nOctober 2009\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the outside scientists present their case\n\nDr. Ann McKee and others present evidence of CTE in football players during a Congressional hearing. Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) tells Goodell that the league’s response to the problem reminds her of the tobacco industry’s handling of the link between smoking and health problems in the 1990s.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) tells Goodell: “We have heard from the NFL time and time again. You are always studying, you are always trying, you are hopeful. I want to know, what are you doing now?”\n\nNovember 2009\n\nShake Up on the MTBI Committee\n\nDr. Ira Casson and Dr. David Viano resign from the MTBI committee. In a memo obtained by the Associated Press following their resignation, Commissioner Goodell said that he wanted to find new members “who will bring to the committee independent sources of expertise and experience in the field of head injuries.”\n\nIn March 2010, the league installs neurological surgeons Dr. H. Hunt Batjer and Dr. Richard G. Ellenbogen as co-chairs of the renamed “Head, Neck and Spine Committee” and appoints Dr. Kevin Guskiewicz as a member.\n\nJanuary 2010\n\nNFL makes Boston University its “preferred” brain bank\n\nIn addition to donating $1 million towards their research efforts, the NFL writes a letter stating they will make Dr. McKee’s Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy the “‘preferred’ brain bank of the NFL” for future research on the brains of deceased NFL players.\n\nDr. McKee told FRONTLINE that she was surprised by the unexpected gift. “A CBS reporter wanted to know what I thought of the gift of a million dollars. That was the first I heard of it,” she said. “I was floored.”\n\nNovember 2012\n\nDr. McKee presents research at sports conference, faces critcism\n\nDr. McKee presents her findings of CTE in 33 of the 34 brains of former football players that she’s examined at the annual Conference of Concussion in Sport hosted by FIFA, the international soccer federation, in Zurich.\n\nMcKee faces sharp criticism at the conference, particularly around the question of a causal relationship between football and CTE and questions of prevalence when her research is based solely on case studies.\n\nMcKee told FRONTLINE that she’s aware that she’s only seeing a small sample.\n\n“I think to be truthful, even a selection bias in an autopsy sample, even if the family of an individual who is affected is much more likely to donate their brain, than a person who has no symptoms whatsoever,” she said, “given that, we have still been just ridiculously successful in getting examples of this disease.\n\nNovember 2012\n\nGoodell speaks about concussions\n\nThe NFL commissioner speaks about player safety at the Harvard School of Public Health. He emphasizes the league’s focus on making the game safer, but he also points out that there are still unanswered questions when it comes to the long-term impact of concussions:\n\n“In recent years, there has been a much sharper focus on concussions in football and other sports. There are still unanswered questions, but scientists and doctors know more about concussions and their long-term potential effects than they did even a few years ago. The key issue for us is how we use this new understanding to make the game even safer and more exciting in the future.”\n\nAugust 2013\n\nA surprise settlement\n\nThe NFL agrees to pay $765 million to settle the lawsuit with retired players. As part of the settlement, the league doesn’t admit any wrongdoing.\n\nIn the days following the settlement, Commissioner Goodell reiterates that “there was no admission of guilt. There was no admission that anything was caused by football.”\n\nAs of October 2013, lawyers are still determining how the proceeds will be used for former players. ESPN has reported that any retired player who died before 2006 would be excluded from the settlement, and that it’s unclear if there is enough money to cover the players that do qualify."
