Quotations, highlights, commentary.\n\nCurrently Reading\n\nWheels of Commerce (by Fernand Braudel)\n\nGolden Lads (by Daphne du Maurier): a biography of Anthony and Francis Bacon.\n\nCollected Prose and Poetry, 2017-2022 (by Chris Stasse)\n\nConventions\n\nWords within square brackets (\"[]\") are my additions or paraphrases. Ellipses in brackets (\"[...]\" or \"[…]\") show where I've elided part of a quotation.\n\nEmphasized text is original emphasis; I use the mark element when I want to point something out.\n\nNon-English words are marked up like this, using the foreign class and HTML's lang attribute.\n\nAnything read before 2018 is unlikely to be added here.\n\nA minimal entry doesn't mean I have nothing to say. It means I haven't yet uploaded the notes for that book.\n\nScore Scale\n\nLast updated 2020-04-11.\n\n0/5: Terrible. No redeeming qualities.\n\n1/5: Bad. Not saved by scattered sections of higher quality or inventiveness.\n\n2/5: Poor. Below the bar. May well be enjoyable or have artistic merit, but excessive flaws prevent me from giving a higher rating. Not worth re-reading except for comfort or nostalgia. Recommendable only to those with a strong interest in its topic.\n\n3/5: Solid. Above the bar. Good parts outweigh bad. I'm glad to have read it once.\n\n4/5: Good. Left a unique impression on me. Excels in some area of written composition. Gets prioritized for transferring my notes and excerpts to this webpage.\n\n5/5: Superb. Probably worth reading twice.\n\nThe Books\n\nSea of Glory\n\n(by Nathaniel Fredrick) (score 3)\n\nReasonably good account of the US Exploring Expedition. Fine subject matter, and Fredrick's writing is by no means bad, but in the large his authorial voice has a certain monotony. Each chapter felt almost the same; incredibly, I began to say \"ho-hum, another adventure?\" even as the feats managed by Wilkes' crew at the southernmost parts of the world grew more and more fascinating.\n\nLetters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and Conditions of North American Indians\n\n(by George Catlin) (score 4)\n\nCatlin was a portrait painter who spent about 7 years living among the Indians of the Louisiana Purchase territories. His paintings, reproduced here as full-page color prints, are a treasure trove for anthropology.\n\nHis writings are also a fitting riposte for anyone who claims that all historical Americans were racists, or otherwise intolerant of natives. His attitude is even more positive than that of Meriwether Lewis (who I recently read about in Undaunted Courage.)\n\nUndaunted Courage\n\n(by Stephen Ambrose) (score 4)\n\nA Moveable Feast\n\n(by Ernest Hemingway) (score 4)\n\nThe Bicentennial Man\n\n(by Isaac Asimov)\n\nWest of the Revolution\n\nThe Annotated Lolita\n\n(by Vladimir Nabokov) (edited by Alfred Appel, Jr.) (:unfinished)\n\nOn a linguistic level, Lolita is crafted as masterfully as one would expect from Nabokov. But I must say that this didn't capture me the way Pale Fire did. I'll have to return and tackle it again, finishing it this time; I am certain that the fault lies with me and not with the author.\n\nAlone Through the Forbidden Land\n\nConquest, Tribute, and Trade\n\n(by Howard J. Erlichman) (score 2)\n\nA Golden Treasury of Chinese Poetry\n\n(by Father John Turner, SJ) (score 5) (read 2022-02-02 to 2022-02-03)\n\nOut-fucking-standing.\n\nPale Fire\n\n(by Vladimir Nabokov) (score 4 or 5)\n\nVarious\n\nSkimmed as desired, 2021-12-16 to 2022-02-03\n\nA Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas, by William York Tindall [from 2021-12-16]\n\nWhere have the Old Words Got Me? Explications of Dylan Thomas's Collected Poems, by Ralph Maud [from 2021-12-16]\n\nCollected Poems, by Dylan Thomas [from 2021-12-06]\n\nComputer Lib/Dream Machines, by Ted Nelson\n\nCoal: A Sonnet Sequence, by John Gurney (illustrated by Paul Peter Piech)\n\n(score 2)\n\n(from 2021-12-06 to 2021-12-11)\n\nI've written a review of Coal and will post it here when I have time.\n\nA Commentary on Tennyson's \"In Memoriam\", by A. C. Bradley\n\n(partial)\n\n\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\", by Alfred, Lord Tennyson\n\n(score 5)\n\nTerminal Moraine\n\n(by James Fenton) (read fall 2021) (score 1)\n\nBrief review, 2022-02-03:\n\n\"Our Western Furniture\" is the centerpiece of this collection. I recently read that poem as my introduction to Fenton, and it is fantastic work; a 5 on its own, without question. However, of the other poems in Terminal Moraine, I only liked a single one: \"Put Thou Thy Tears into My Bottle, Part One.\" Stupid title, but unparalleled use of enjambment to create a rhythm that rolls incessantly from line to line.\n\nThus, considered apart from \"Furniture,\" this collection gets a 1; and \"Furniture\" is so long a sonnet sequence, and makes up so much of the volume, that I have to rate it by itself, and won't let its score upgrade Terminal Moraine's.\n\nOur Western Furniture\n\n(by James Fenton) (score 5)\n\nThe Economic History of China\n\n(by Richard von Glahn)\n\nThe Corpse Walker\n\n(score 4 or 5)\n\nZen Flesh, Zen Bones\n\n(score 4)\n\nDaily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250-1276\n\n(by Jacques Gernet) (score 3 or 4)\n\nGabriela, Clove and Cinnamon\n\n(score 3)\n\nWordstruck\n\n(score 3 or 4)\n\nThe Search for Modern China\n\nThe Futurological Congress\n\n(score 3)\n\nDesert Solitaire\n\n(score 5)\n\nCandide\n\nThe Languages of China\n\n(score 3 or 4)\n\nSelected Poems\n\n(author Robert Browning) (score 5)\n\nWorks of Gerard Manley Hopkins\n\nHis Master's Voice\n\n(by Stanisław Lem) (score 4) (read 2021-03-10 to 2021-03-21T22:08:53-0700)\n\nThe King of Elfland's Daughter\n\n(by Lord Dunsany) (score 4) (read 2021-02-19 to 2021-03-04)\n\nRead my Elfland poems: one, two, three, four.\n\nBureaucracy\n\n(by James Q. Wilson) (score 4)\n\nDictionary of the Khazars\n\n(score 1 or 2)\n\n2021-03-17T16:53:06-0700\n\nOh, how I wanted to like this \"dictionary novel.\" Unfortunately, it completely failed to deliver on both parts of that premise.\n\nIt is entirely possible to read a topic-specific dictionary and enjoy it in exactly the way that Khazars ought to have aped. For instance, I found it tremendously satisfying to read a 1980s cultural dictionary of Japanese which, apart from being a first-rate dictionary, introduced me to aspects of Japanese material and intangible culture which I had never heard of before. All Khazars had to do was be a made-up dictionary of the same kind, and I would have found it impossible to put down. However, there were so few actual entries in the dictionary that it didn't feel like a dictionary at all; instead of a large number of entries which slowly reveal larger themes and events, Khazars basically just uses the dictionary headwords as chapters. The headwords don't even have pronunciation guides like a real dictionary!\n\nFurthermore, and even more damningly, it's not a good novel, either. Its fantasy runs entirely on dream logic, unmoored to anything, like the most fantastic of fables or myths. This is thematically correct for the namesake Khazars, who (if I recall correctly, and if I understood the damn snippets correctly) have a culture revolving around interpreting and manipulating dreams; however, this makes each individual story in the \"dictionary\" hugely unrewarding unless you are really, really into myth.\n\nFrustrating, frustrating, frustrating. In short, you might enjoy this if you are looking for something far different than what I expected. But as someone who actually does enjoy reading dictionaries, this was a huge disappointment. It could have been a daring and fascinating experiment; instead it's just overblown myths connected by a skeleton far too weak to bind them tightly.\n\nLeft of Bang\n\n(score 3)\n\nWhy Things Hurt\n\n(score 3) (read 2020-12-20 to 2021-01-01)\n\nImperial China, 900-1800\n\n(by F. W. Mote)\n\nFinding Them Gone\n\n(by Bill Porter :aka Red Pine) (year 2016) (score 4) (read 2020-10-02 to 2020-10-09)\n\nWhat a great book. Bill Porter, known in Chinese as Red Pine, has for decades been an important figure in the world of translated Chinese poetry. His travel writings have also gained a huge following in China.\n\nIn thirty chapters, Porter describes a personal quest: spend thirty days tearing ass all over China in search of graves, hometowns, and shrines from the lives of important Chinese poets so that he can toast them with fine American whiskey.\n\nThe book is not only a modern Chinese travelogue, but also a primer on Chinese poetry. Breaking up the travel narrative are over 200 Chinese poems, accompanied by Porter's translations.\n\nChina in Ten Words\n\n(by Yu Hua :zh-name 余华) (year ???? 2008?) (score 3 :unfinished) (:zh-title 十个词汇里的中国)\n\nChris Stasse, Alexi C., and I are reading and responding to this as part of a Chinese reading group. Each chapter is an essay prompted by a single two-character Chinese word. Below are the ones I've read so far; I'll definitely end up blogging more about this book.\n\n人民 People\n\n领袖 Leader (finished 2020-09-21)\n\n阅读 Reading (read 2020-10-10)\n\n7 more chapters...

He was born in the 1990s, but ends the book living in the 3000s as one of just a dozen remaining 'original' humans.\n\nWhile Forever War was written as a response to the Vietnam War, it takes on new meaning with the increasing social atomization of modern (American) society. If, through the Web, you invisibly participate in a subculture that the people around you misunderstand or condemn, and find yourself biting your tongue in every real-life conversation, aren't you nearly as detached as Mandella, even if you have somewhere to go online? Furthermore, the social changes Mandella faces take place over years, and historical social change took place over decades or centuries, while today a culture shift that entices you and drives away your IRL peers (or vice versa) can take place in weeks or days (and be reported on in minutes.)\n\nThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress\n\n(by Robert Heinlein) (year 1966) (score 5) (read 2020-07-16 to 2020-07-17)\n\nReread. Worth every second, as a plea for all people to be competent, self-reliant, and willing to live and let live.\n\nKing Leopold's Ghost\n\n(by Adam Hochschild) (year 1998) (score 4) (read 2020-07-11 to 2020-07-13)\n\nSlaughterhouse-Five\n\n(by Kurt Vonnegut) (year ?) (score 4 or 5) (read 2020-07-07 to 2020-07-08)\n\nReread. The first time was in high school, but I didn't pay it enough attention at that time.

I can't say I cared for the ending, but that's probably on me. Recommended to those who consider themselves artists or art enthusiasts.\n\nLife on the Mississippi\n\n(by Mark Twain) (year ?) (score 3 or 4 :unfinished) (read 2020-04)\n\nSunrise with Seamonsters\n\n(by Paul Theroux) (year 1985) (score 4) (read 2020-04)\n\nIn the tiny country of Malawi the winter is severe [...] May, June, and July, the cold months, are also the harvest months. This is the season when the village silos -- huge baskets on legs -- are filled to the brim with corn, the staple food of the Malawian. The oranges and tangerines are ripe; the second bean crop, the tobacco and tea are all being harvested and auctioned.\n\nWinter in Africa [July 2, 1965] - pg 12\n\nThe giraffes moved slowly among the trees like tired dancers. I wanted them to gallop. Once you've seen a giraffe galloping -- they gallop as if they're about to come apart any second, yet somehow all their flapping limbs stay miraculously attached -- you know that survival has something to do with speed, no matter how grotesque, double-bellied and gawky the beast may be.\n\n[...] No camera is like no hands, a feat of skill. And if you know that sooner or later you will have to explain it all, without benefit of slides or album, to your large family, then as soon as you see something you start searching the view for clues and rummaging through your lexical baggage for the right phrases. Otherwise, what's the use? And when you see something like a galloping giraffe which you can't capture on film you are thrown back on the English language like a cowboy's grizzled sidekick against a cactus. You hope for the sake of posterity and spectators that you can rise unscratched with a blossom.\n\nThe Cerebral Snapshot [October 5, 1965] - pg 15-16\n\nSlowly, it happens, a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph. Nothing comes out right the first time, and you are not so much writing as learning a language, inching along in what seems at times like another tongue.\n\nA Love-Scene After Work: Writing in the Tropics [1971] - pg 86\n\nI am calling attention to the phenomenon [of mass tourism] because it is so far from the traditional notion of travel as going away [...] The interest in travel today, which is passionate, arises out of the fact that there is a form of travel prevalent that is now very easy -- people want to find an antidote for the immobility that mass tourism has produced; people want to believe that somewhere, somehow, it is still very dangerous, bizarre, anxiety-making and exotic to travel, that one can still make discoveries in a glorious solitary way. Mock-travel has produced a huge interest in clumsy, old-fashioned travel, with its disgusting food and miseries and long nights. It has also given rise to a lively interest in travel literature and the affirmation that the world is still large and strange and, thank God, full of empty places that are nothing like home.\n\nStranger on a Train: The Pleasures of Railways [1976] - pg 135\n\nIn the schoolroom and factory and in the long dark line of coalminers waiting to be paid, the faces stare out helplessly, trapped by circumstances, and we feel judged, because we have never been gazed at in quite that way, so immediately, across time. Moments before many of these pictures were taken, the last words spoken were \"Hold still!\" We can see the effect of that command in the small boy's shoulders or the man's grip on the chairback. Everyone here is holding his breath, as if for a hundred-year leap to the present.\n\nThe Past Recaptured [1980] - pg 231-232\n\nI have seen a number of photographs taken in [the 1800s], usually in China, of beheadings. Invariably the sword is shown poised over the neck (sometimes the head has been struck off and lies severed on the ground).\n\nBut this beheading in China is electrifying. We see more than the sword and the head. The man has been hit with the blade several times, and the executionr is tensed to take another stroke. The condemned man, clearly bleeding -- that is blood, not hair, coursing from his twisted face -- is a goner. But look at the faces of the men who are holding his ropes and supporting his gibbet. This is hardly the routine event we have been taught took place in Imperial China. These men are as close as we are (and we are seeing something the witnesses in the background are missing) and they wear expressions of terror and disbelief. The whole affair is as shocking to them as it is -- one hopes -- to us. This is the opposite of anonymity, and after the experience of this photograph one cannot think of such an execution as something taken for granted, a ritual which we can regard as conventional and commonplace. It is almost cathartic, for those wincing men are expressing our own shock.\n\nSome of these photographs [...] are much older than their dates suggest. They give us access to the past. The Ainus, the Bedouin, the Irish peat-carriers, the Wa-Kikuyu and American Indians -- these might have been taken in the 'eighties or 'nineties of [the 1800s], or even more recently, but we may be assured that for the preceding century, and perhaps for many centuries before, the people looked exactly like this. Our glimpse is not of people caught on a given year, but of an image carried away from a much remoter past, and a few decades before they were to change out of all recognition.\n\nThe Past Recaptured [1980] - pg 232\n\nOne evening, Sackville was with a group of illustrious friends at Knole House. To entertain them in front of the fire, Sackville suggested that they all write \"impromptus\" -- a few brilliant lines apiece -- and that John Dryden, who had probably ceased to be Poet Laureate at this point, should act as judge. The guests took pens and paper and put their minds to the task, each hoping to win with his own piece. The papers were collected and given to Dryden, who carefully examined each entry. He then announced Sackville as the winner. This was not so surprising -- Sackville, as well as being a patron, was also a considerable poet.\n\nDryden read out Sackville's winning impromptu. It was not a poem. It went as follows: \"I promise to pay Mr John Dryden five hundred pounds on demand. Signed, Dorset.\"\n\nEasy Money: Patronage [1981] - pg 260\n\nThe most knowledgeable railway buff I met in Simla was a man who, over a period of years, had traveled all over India on trains visiting race tracks. He seldom stayed overnight. He would hurry to Lucknow on a night train, gamble all day at the track, and then catch the sleeper to Calcutta and do the same thing. I said it seemed a difficult thing to do, all that railroading. No, he said, the difficult thing was putting on a sad face and hailing a tonga and then riding Third Class so no potential thief would guess he had five thousand rupees of winnings in his pocket.\n\nMaking Tracks to Chittagong [1983] - pg 318\n\nWord list:\n\nlaburnum\n\nbathetic\n\nirrefragable\n\nsneaping\n\normolu\n\nraffish\n\norotund\n\noppidan\n\nTravels with Samantha\n\n(by Philip Greenspun) (year 1993) (score 3) (read 2020-04-23)\n\nAvailable for free online.

Magazines, newspapers--print. I'm not oriented to television as I was to print. The biggest impact today is TV. This has helped reduce the need for press agentry. A client will come to me and say, \"I want to be a star.\" In the old days, maybe I'd get her in Life. Today on the Carson show you could get more attention that I could have gotten her in a year. As press agentry becomes part of a bigger and bigger world it becomes more routinized. It's a mechanical thing today. It's no longer the opportunity to do stunts. They don't work any more. Much of what I've been doing all these years is not as potent as in the old days.\n\nMost guys in my category have eight, ten clients. If you have less, you're in trouble. You can't depend on one or two, no matter how much they pay, 'cause you can lose 'em. One day I lost three clients that were paying me each over twelve thousand dollars a year. I lost Cinerama, Indonesia, and the Singer Company. That is thirty-six thousand dollars a year. I had years I made a hundred thousand. There's a law of making money. You never regard it as something temporary, and you live up to the scale. But in this work, you don't build anything. If I had a little candy store and I built it up to a bigger store, I might have sold it for a quarter of a million dollars. Who do I sell my clippings to?\n\nEddie Jaffe, press agent - pg 88\n\nTo me, when I was a kid, the policeman was the epitome--not of perfection--was a good and evil in combination, but in control. He came from an element in the neighborhood and he knew what was going on. To me, a policeman is your community officer. He is your Officer Friendly, he is your clergyman, he is your counselor. He is a doctor to some: \"Mr. Policeman, my son just fell and bumped his head.\" Now all we are is a guy that sits in a squad car and waits for a call to come over the radio. We have lost complete contact with the people. They get the assumption that we're gonna be called to the scene for one purpose--to become violent to make an arrest. No way I can see that. I am the community officer. They have taken me away from the people I'm dedicated to serving--and I don't like it.\n\nVincent Maher, policeman - pg 134-135\n\nI quit chaufferin'. I make more money in a parking lot with tips and salary. When people ask what I do, I tell 'em I park cars just like any other job. Only thing you got is a white collar, that's okay with me. Working behind a typewriter, that's fine. You're a doctor, that's cool. I got man friends, teachers. We meet sometimes, have a drink, talk. Everything is normal. Everybody got a job to do. My friends never feel superior to me. They'll say, \"I'll go downtown and park with Lovin' Al.\"\n\nAlfred \"Lovin' Al\" Pommier, car hiker [valet] - pg 222\n\nWe were doing a beautiful job for a big brewer. They'd just bought a new brewery and found out the beer was too nutritious. It had a lot of food value. They did market research and found out that psychologically inadequate young men consumed beer as a way of competing with one another--the kids in college. \"Can you drink fourteen bottles of beer while I drink fourteen bottles of beer?\" How many can you drink before you puke? The beer that sells best is the weakest and the thinnest and doesn't fight you. The first thing they did was take the richness out of it. They got it down to alcohol and water.\n\nMy role was to create a fun-filled image, an exciting boy-girl gaiety in the competitive market of light beer. \"Light beer\"--that's the ad phrase for the watered and thin beer. So the schmucky kid thinks he's a stud fighting for the babe by consuming all that alcohol.\n\nYou begin to say, \"What the fuck am I doing? I'm sitting here destroying my country.\" The feeling gets stronger and stronger and suddenly your father dies.\n\nWalter Lundquist, industrial designer - pg 526\n\nWe've had the bar only six months. We're trying to get it to a point where we spend less and less time there. [...] We go to bed about midnight and it starts all over the next day. Except Monday. Monday we're closed.\n\nNow we begin to reap the benefits of what we went there for. On Monday we put the kids on the bus to school. We get in the truck, we throw the boat in the back. Six minutes from our front door, we put it in one of the world's largest man-made lakes and go fishing and picknicking and mess around until four o'clock when the kids come home. We sit out there, where I don't suppose three boats go by us all day long. Sit and watch the copperheads on the shore and the birds overhead. Discussing Nixon and Daley and fishing and the dairy bar and whatever. What's astonishing is we can climb a mountain right across from our home. There's a waterfall at the top. And no jets going over. No people. Just a pickup truck down the road now and then.\n\nA man stood on Eden's Highway [in Chicago] and took a survey of guys driving to work. Their jaw muscles were working. I was one of those guys. I was this guy with his eyes bulging and swearing and saying, \"You rotten guy, get out of my way.\" For what? So I could get to work to get kicked around by a purchasing agent because his job is five minutes late? That forty-five minutes' drive to work. I would usually have about five cigarettes. Constant close calls, jam-ups, running late, tapping the foot on the floor, thumping that wheel, and everything that everybody does.\n\nI would get to the office. You might find the paper hadn't been delivered, the press had broken down, the boss might be in a foul mood. Or you might have a guy on the phone screaming that he had to see you in half an hour or else the whole world would end. They always had to have an estimate first. So you'd do your paper work as fast as you could. Then you'd start your round of daily calls. Then came the hassle for parking space. Are you lucky enough to get one of those hour jobs on the street or do you go in the lot? If you go in the lot, what're they gonna do to your car before they give it back to you? How many dents? So you go through that hassle.\n\nThen it would be lunch time. You'd take a guy to lunch, have two or three drinks. Rich food ... You come out of the darkened restaurant back into the summer afternoon. At four you'd take whatever jobs you had assembled or proofs you had to look over. Maybe work until five thirty or six. Then you're fighting the traffic back to the suburb.\n\n[...] If you decide to cut and run, you've got to do it in one clean break. You'll never do it if you piddle away and if you wait until you're sixty. A fellow I know, he was sixty-three, bought a piece of land in Taos, on a mountain top, forty acres. He and his wife were gonna go in three years and move there. He told me this on a Tuesday. On Saturday his wife was dead in the garden. The day he buried her he said to me, \"Boy, you're so smart to get out while you're young.\" Our decision to make this journey evolved over a period of years. Not so strangely, it came about with our achievement of what is called the American Dream.\n\nPeople say, \"You're wasting your college education.\" My ex-employer said to my father, \"You didn't raise your son to be a hash slinger.\" I've lost status in the eyes of my big city friends.

My personal status with myself has gone up a hundred percent.\n\nFred Ringley, ex-salesman turned farmer - pg 534-535\n\nMighty Rough Times, I Tell You\n\n(editor Andrea Sutcliffe) (score 3) (read 2020-04-11)\n\nTo get salt to go in your bread in slavery, well, they would dig up the dirt where the fresh meat hung over and had been dripping salt, and would boil this to get the salt. They would get and parch sweet potato peelings to make coffee. You-all are blessed children; you are living on flowery beds of ease. I would to God sometimes that I was able to express myself.\n\nMr. Reed, in \"A Negro Has Got No Name\" - pg 25\n\nOne time, they had a beef killed for General Forrest's regiment, but somehow or other Forrest didn't get there to eat that meat, and it begin[^6] to spoil, and they was feeding the slaves that then. I couldn't stomach it, and one day I told Master that I had to quit work 'cause I was starving to death, and that I might as well die one way as the other. He asked me what was the matter, that the other slaves was eating all right. I told him I couldn't stand that meat, that I just couldn't stomach it. He carried me to the house and fed me from their table.\n\nMr. Chapman, in \"We Didn't Know Nothing Else But Slavery\" - pg 31\n\nI think I's 107 years old. Was born in Williamson County 'fore the Civil War. Guess the reason I have lived so long was 'cause I took good care of myself and wore warm clothes and still do, wear my yarn petticoats now. Have had good health all my life. Have took very little medicine, and the worst sickness I ever had was smallpox. I's been a widow about seventy years.\n\nPrecilla Grey, in \"I Got Many a Whipping\" - pg 33\n\nThen we came back. I don't know how long that was before the war broke out, but we stayed with the same white people until the war ceasted[^7]. Now, you know what happened then. They told us we were free, but of course we didn't know where to go nor nothing.\n\nVergy, in \"I Was Four Years Old When I Was Put on the Block\" - pg 36\n\nI'm about played out now. Yes, I like to look at the ladies sometimes. I don't get out much now. Last night was a cold night, wasn't it?\n\nI expect I am the oldest man in Nashville. Nearest we can come to making out my age, I am 'bout 120 years old. I don't know it exactly 'cause when the war broke out they lost the Bible [slaves' birth dates were customarily recorded in the Bible of their white family.]\n\nname unknown, in \"I Expect I Am the Oldest Man in Nashville\" - pg 43\n\nI remember the first streetlights in Nashville. When the lamp man would come round and light the lamps, they would yell out, \"All is well!\" And I also remember the Southern money going out and Yankee money going in, and also when there wasn't any coal here, and everything was wood, and most of the town was in the woods.\n\nPatsy Hyde, in \"I Never Worries No Matter What Happens\" - pg 49\n\nHow Does a Poem Mean?\n\n(by John Ciardi) (score 3) (read 2020-04-04 to 2020-04-05)\n\nDid Frost know what he was going to do when he began [Stopping By Woods]? Considering the poem simply as a piece of juggling one cannot fail to respond to the magnificent turn at the end where, with one flip, seven of the simplest words in the language suddenly dazzle [...]\n\npg 674\n\nOr suppose that there existed somewhere a religious order that imposed a vow not only of eternal silence, but against all verbalization even of one's thoughts. Initiaties, suppose further, must pray a certain number of hours each day, but they must dance their prayers. [...] Can there be any doubt that the kinds of postures and the sequences of actions such dancers could fall into could constitute not only a language but a language susceptible of[^4] great refinement?\n\npg 707\n\nAs soon as one takes into account this picture-behind-the-word, there are simply no synonyms anymore.\n\npg 766-767\n\nAfter a discussion of Milton (itself worth quoting):\n\n\"Poetry, it must be understood, is a made thing. It does not record reality nor even imagination; it selects from them.\"\n\npg 769-771\n\nDiscussing Keats' revisions to the original manuscript of \"The Eve of St. Agnes\":\n\nThe first draft of the manuscript reads not as above in the third line, but \"Unclasps her bosom jewels.\" This reading Keats immediately struck out. One must note in the final version that though Madeline undresses in this stanza, there is not one word that mentions flesh. Certainly there is no reason except the narrowest kind of prurience against mentioning \"bosom\" as a facet of the world. But the word does not fit the mood Keats is seeking to establish. The flesh remains in the revised line, but it is sublimated and suggested in the richness of \"warmed\" rather than baldly stated.\n\n[Further discussion of revisions to the next line.]\n\nTwo things seem to emerge clearly from a careful look at Keats' choices and revisions here. First, Keats seems originally to have conceived of Madeline as definitely buxom, but no hint of that original conception survives the revisions. Keats seems to have changed, or at least to have suppressed his original conception of the facts, and to have done so with no hint of unfaithfulness to facts, but rather in a joyous pursuit of something else. Poets seem easily inclined to change the denotations of what they write about in order to control the connotations.\n\npg 772-773\n\nThus, poetry may achieve high effect by the power of suggestion (overtone) rather than rather than by its specific identification (denotation).[^5] John William Burgon, an English poet of the nineteenth century, wrote many poems but survives only as the author of one line describing the Trans-Jordan city of Petra:\n\nA rose-red city half as old as time.\n\nThe \"rose-red\" is clearly intended to convey the color of the sandstone from which the city is built. In another context it might suggest the sunset stain on white walls. In either case the effect is denotative. But the truly memorable quality of the line certainly rests in \"half as old as time,\" a phrase about as far from denotation as language seems able to go this side of nonsense syllables.\n\npg 790\n\nIt would be simply silly, however, to argue that \"steel\" in poetry is anything but strong. The case is even simpler for \"hushed calm\" and \"distant sunset\": one need only try to imagine an unhushed calm or a nearby sunset, to ealize that such adjectives must tend above all else to indicate the incompetence of the writer. The least one should expect of poetry, is that it find for itself a language (or a diction) better than the reader could improvise.\n\npg 795\n\nWord list:\n\nlucent\n\nargosy\n\nwoofed\n\nbillingsgate\n\npismire\n\nomnium-gatherum\n\nousel\n\nsquamous\n\nThe Story of My Life\n\n(by Giacomo Casanova) (score 3 or 4)\n\nInvisible Cities\n\n(by Italo Calvino) (score 4) (read 2020-03-07 to 2020-03-08T09:45:00-0700) (translator William Weaver)\n\nIsaura, city of the thousand wells, is said to rise over a deep, subterranean lake. On all sides, wherever the inhabitants dig long, vertical holes in the ground, they succeed in drawing up water, as are as the city extends, and no further. Its green border repeats the dark outline of the buried lake; an invisible landscape conditions the visible one; everything that moves in the sunlight is driven by the lapping wave enclosed beneath the rock's calcareous sky.\n\npg 20 / Thin Cities 1\n\nMarco [Polo] enters a city; he sees someone in a square living a life or an instant that could be his; he could now be in that man's place, if he had stopped in time, long ago; or if, long ago, at a crossroads, instead of taking one road he had taken the opposite one, and after long wandering he had come to be in the place of that man in the square.\n\npg 29\n\nYou do not come to Euphemia only to buy and sell, but also because at night, by the fires all around the market, seated on sacks or barrels or stretched out on piles of carpets, at each word that a man says--such as \"wolf\", \"sister\", \"hidden treasure\", \"battle\", \"scabies\", \"lovers\"--the others tell, each one, his tale of wolves, sisters, treasures, scabies, lovers, battles.\n\npg 36 / Trading Cities 1\n\nIt is the mood of the beholder which gives the city of Zemrude its form. If you go by whistling, your nose a-tilt behind the whistle, you will know it from below: window sills, flapping curtains, fountains. If you walk along hanging your head, your nails dug into the palms of your hands, your gaze will be held on the ground, in the gutters, the manhole covers, the fish scales, wastepaper. You cannot say that one aspect of the city is truer than the other, but you hear of the upper Zemrude chiefly from those who remember it, as they sink into the lower Zemrude, following every day the same stretches of street and finding again each morning the ill-humor of the day before, encrusted at the foot of the walls. For everyone, sooner or later, the day comes when we bring our gaze down along the drainpipes and we can no longer detach it from the cobblestones. The reverse is not impossible, but it is more rare: and so we continue walking through Zemrude's streets with eyes now digging into the cellars, the foundations, the wells.\n\npg 66 / Cities & Eyes 2\n\nIn Esmeralda, city of water, a network of canals and a network of streets span and intersect each other. To go from one place to another you have always the choice between land and boat: and since the shortest distance between two points in Esmeralda is not a straight line but a zigzag that ramifies in tortuous optional routes, the ways that open to each passerby are never two, but many, and they increase further for those who alternate a stretch by boat with one on dry land.\n\n[...]\n\nAnd that is not all: the network of routes is not arranged on one level, but follows instead an up-and-down course of steps, landings, cambered bridges, hanging streets. Combining segments of the various routes, elevated or on ground level, each inhabitant can enjoy every day the pleasure of a new itinerary to reach the same places. The most fixed and calm lives in Esmeralda are spent without any repetition.\n\nSecret and adventurous lives, here as elsewhere, are subject to greater restrictions. Esmeralda's cats, thieves, illicit lovers move along higher, discontinuous ways, dropping from a rooftop to a balcony, following gutterings with acrobats' steps. [...] Below, the rats run [...] crossing the city's compactness pierced by the spokes of underground passages.\n\nA map of Esmeralda should include, marked in different colored inks, all these routes, solid and liquid, evident and hidden.\n\npg 89 / Trading Cities 5\n\nA vegetable vendor was weighing a cabbage on a scales[^scales] and put it in a basket dangling on a string a girl lowered from a balcony. The girl was identical with one in my village who had gone mad for love and killed herself. The vegetable vendor raised her face: she was my grandmother.\n\nI thought: \"You reach a moment in life when, among the people you have known, the dead outnumber the living. And the mind refuses to accept more faces, more expressions: on every new face you encounter, it prints the old forms, for each one it finds the most suitable mask.\"\n\npg 94-95 / Cities & The Dead 2\n\nThe image propagated by tradition is that of a city of pure gold, with silver locks and diamond gates, a jewel-city, all inset and inlaid, as a maximum of laborious study might produce when applied to materials of the maximum worth.\n\npg 111 / Cities & the Sky 2\n\nThen Marco Polo spoke: \"Your chessboard, sire, is inlaid with two woods: ebony and maple. The square on which your enlightened gaze is fixed was cut from the ring of a trunk that grew in a year of drought: you see how its fibers are arranged? Here a barely hinted knot can be made out: a bud tried to burgeon on a premature spring day, but the night's frost forced it to desist.\"\n\nUntil then the Great Khan had not realized that the foreigner knew how to express himself fluently in his language, but it was not this fluency that amazed him.\n\n\"Here is a thicker pore: perhaps it was a larvum's nest; not a woodworm, because, once born, it would have begun to dig, but a caterpillar that gnawed the leaves and was the cause for the tree's being chosen for chopping down . . .

This seed ferments in bitterness, rivalry, resentment; and the natural desire of revenge on the unjust is colored by a yearning to be in their place and to act as they do. Another unjust city, though different from the first, is digging out its space within the double sheath of the just and unjust Berenices.\n\npg 162 / Hidden Cities 5\n\nWord list:\n\ncalcareous\n\nnoria\n\nlabile\n\nbelvedere\n\nlavabo\n\nhawsepipe\n\nmandrel\n\nmullion (as \"mullioned\")\n\ndeclivity: n. a downward slope; a deviation from the horizontal (opp. acclivity)\n\ncampanile\n\ncorbel\n\ncornice: n. any horizontal, molded projection at the highest part of a building or wall (e.g. crown molding); an overhanging mass of snow on a mountain peak; v. to decorate with a cornice\n\nbrocade\n\nbarracan\n\nmedlar\n\nlazaretta\n\nelytra\n\nodalisque\n\nThe Mists of Avalon\n\n(by Marion Zimmer Bradley) (score 3) (read 2020-02)\n\nWord list:\n\nbyre\n\nbannock\n\ntanist\n\nGoing Solo\n\n(by Roald Dahl) (score 3) (year 1986) (read 2020-01-24)\n\nRed Sparrow\n\n(by Jason Matthews) (score 3) (read 2020-01-23) (year 2013)\n\nWord list:\n\ngamine: n. a mischievous, playful, or elfish girl or young woman; a female waif or urchin.\n\ncassoulet: n. an oven-baked stew or casserole from southwest France, containing beans, meats, vegetables, and herbs.\n\nspile: n. a pile (anchoring post); a bung or spigot.\n\nsplenetic: adj.

I kept finding parallels to what I know of China, past and present, with countless micro-cultures spread over a vast area. The second half concerns the growing of national identity; the bypassing of village, forest, and transhumance trail by railroad; the disappearance of folkways; and the replacement of ignorance of the contemporary with ignorance of the past.\n\nGreat Poems of the English Language\n\n(by Wallace Alvin Briggs) (score 4) (year 1927) (read 2019)\n\nSelections from this volume kicked off my Favorite Poems page.\n\nWord list:\n\nrialto: n. theater district.

Outside of explaining the larger historical context, the book focuses mainly on Sun Yat-sen and his leadership.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that I found it a bit difficult to keep the timeline straight, and I believe this is a consequence of Linebarger's decision to split the book up into conceptual sections rather than by chronology. One section will detail events up to a given time period, only for the following section to return to an earlier era.\n\n[Excerpts coming. There were several turns of phrase I want to copy out]\n\nThree Men in a Boat\n\n(by Jerome K. Jerome) (score 4)\n\nOne way for a book to earn my approval is by making me laugh out loud. Three Men in a Boat accomplished that several times.\n\nI remember going to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had a touch—hay fever, I fancy it was. I got down the book, and read all I came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally. I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into—some fearful, devastating scourge, I know—and, before I had glanced half down the list of “premonitory symptoms,” it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.\n\nIt was a ramshackle affair, dragged along by a knock-kneed, broken-winded somnambulist, which his owner, in a moment of enthusiasm, during conversation, referred to as a horse.\n\nWhy, all our art treasures of to-day are only the dug-up commonplaces of three or four hundred years ago. I wonder if there is real intrinsic beauty in the old soup-plates, beer-mugs, and candle-snuffers that we prize so now, or if it is only the halo of age glowing around them that gives them their charms in our eyes. The “old blue” that we hang about our walls as ornaments were the common every-day household utensils of a few centuries ago; and the pink shepherds and the yellow shepherdesses that we hand round now for all our friends to gush over, and pretend they understand, were the unvalued mantel-ornaments that the mother of the eighteenth century would have given the baby to suck when he cried.\n\nWill it be the same in the future? Will the prized treasures of to-day always be the cheap trifles of the day before? Will rows of our willow-pattern dinner-plates be ranged above the chimneypieces of the great in the years 2000 and odd? Will the white cups with the gold rim and the beautiful gold flower inside (species unknown), that our Sarah Janes now break in sheer light-heartedness of spirit, be carefully mended, and stood upon a bracket, and dusted only by the lady of the house?\n\nAt that moment an angel came by in the disguise of a small boy (and I cannot think of any more effective disguise an angel could have assumed), with a can of beer in one hand, and in the other something at the end of a string, which he let down on to every flat stone he came across, and then pulled up again, this producing a peculiarly unattractive sound, suggestive of suffering.\n\nWe asked this heavenly messenger (as we discovered him afterwards to be) if he knew of any lonely house, whose occupants were few and feeble (old ladies or paralysed gentlemen preferred), who could be easily frightened into giving up their beds for the night to three desperate men; or, if not this, could he recommend us to an empty pigstye, or a disused limekiln, or anything of that sort. He did not know of any such place—at least, not one handy; but he said that, if we liked to come with him, his mother had a room to spare, and could put us up for the night.\n\nI was steering.\n\nAs we drew nearer, we could see that the three men fishing seemed old and solemn-looking men. They sat on three chairs in the punt, and watched intently their lines. And the red sunset threw a mystic light upon the waters, and tinged with fire the towering woods, and made a golden glory of the piled-up clouds. It was an hour of deep enchantment, of ecstatic hope and longing. The little sail stood out against the purple sky, the gloaming lay around us, wrapping the world in rainbow shadows; and, behind us, crept the night.\n\nWe seemed like knights of some old legend, sailing across some mystic lake into the unknown realm of twilight, unto the great land of the sunset.\n\nWe did not go into the realm of twilight; we went slap into that punt, where those three old men were fishing.\n\nI never see a steam launch but I feel I should like to lure it to a lonely part of the river, and there, in the silence and the solitude, strangle it. There is a blatant bumptiousness about a steam launch that has the knack of rousing every evil instinct in my nature, and I yearn for the good old days, when you could go about and tell people what you thought of them with a hatchet and a bow and arrows.\n\nWord list:\n\ninvidious\n\nsimoom\n\noriel\n\nweir\n\nswain\n\nstentorian\n\ncynosure: n. one that serves to direct or guide; a center of attraction or attention.\n\nLao She Short Story Collection\n\n(by Lao She) (score 4)\n\nOn 2019-08-04, my friend Chris Stasse gave me this collection of stories (老舍小说集). As of 2020-06-25, I've read these stories:\n\n《马裤先生》 (read my English translation)\n\n《恋》\n\n《月牙儿》\n\n《不成问题的问题》\n\n《歪毛儿》\n\n《铁牛和病鸭》 (read my English translation)\n\n《一封家信》\n\n《热包子》\n\n《老字号》\n\n《大悲寺外》\n\n《也是三角》\n\n《柳家大院》\n\n《东西》 [2019-12-04T12:14:16-0800: one of the two main characters has a fixation on the contrast between Western and Eastern schooling, manners, lifestyle, etc. The title is thus best translated as \"East and West\", not as \"Things\".]\n\n《陈二哥加薪水》\n\n《善人》\n\n《同盟》\n\nparts of 《黑白李》、《上任》\n\nGargantua\n\n(by François Rabelais) (year 1542) (score 4)\n\nThe second book in the Pantagruel and Gargantua series, which I read first (my copy of the series placed it before Pantagruel because it's a prequel to that book.)\n\nThe introduction made me laugh hysterically, and the first several chapters made me laugh until I cried. Rabelais is a master of repetition; his most common form of joke is to describe a ludicrous number of items within a character's response, or in a description of a scene. For example, one early chapter (in my opinion, the funniest) is almost entirely taken up with an enumeration of the things that Pantagruel, a toddler of comic proportions, has used to wipe his bottom.\n\nWhat About the Rest of Your Life\n\n(by Sung Yim) (year 2017) (read 2019-08-04) (score 4)\n\nI've never read a memoir quite like this. The people, events, and choices that made Sung Yim's life a hell of mental illness and drug addiction also made her into someone who probably would not like me, and who I would not like to spend time with -- but I am glad to have spent a few hours absorbing her perspective.\n\nA Man in Full\n\n(by Tom Wolfe) (score 2 :unfinished)\n\nI quit reading this after ~100 pages, because I felt it could be summed up as \"The Bonfire of the Vanities, but in Atlanta.\" I'd rather read something totally new than something which feels like a retread. I don't care if that's actually an unfair characterization; with so many other things to read, this didn't make the cut.\n\nIvanhoe: A Romance\n\n(by Walter Scott) (? (year 1820)) (read 2019) (score 3 or 4)\n\nHis own character being light, profligate, and perfidious, John easily attached to his person and faction, not only all who had reason to dread the resentment of Richard for criminal proceedings during his absence, but also the numerous class of “lawless resolutes,” whom the crusades had turned back on their country, accomplished in the vices of the East, impoverished in substance, and hardened in character, and who placed their hopes of harvest in civil commotion. To these causes of public distress and apprehension, must be added, the multitude of outlaws, who, driven to despair by the oppression of the feudal nobility, and the severe exercise of the forest laws, banded together in large gangs, and, keeping possession of the forests and the wastes, set at defiance the justice and magistracy of the country. The nobles themselves, each fortified within his own castle, and playing the petty sovereign over his own dominions, were the leaders of bands scarce less lawless and oppressive than those of the avowed depredators. To maintain these retainers, and to support the extravagance and magnificence which their pride induced them to affect, the nobility borrowed sums of money from the Jews at the most usurious interest, which gnawed into their estates like consuming cankers, scarce to be cured unless when circumstances gave them an opportunity of getting free, by exercising upon their creditors some act of unprincipled violence.\n\nChapter 7\n\nTrust me each state must have its policies: Kingdoms have edicts, cities have their charters; Even the wild outlaw, in his forest-walk, Keeps yet some touch of civil discipline; For not since Adam wore his verdant apron, Hath man with man in social union dwelt, But laws were made to draw that union closer.\n\n\"Old Play\", Chapter 32\n\nThey are forbidden to read, save what their Superior permitted, or listen to what is read, save such holy things as may be recited aloud during the hours of refaction; but lo! their ears are at the command of idle minstrels, and their eyes study empty romaunts.\n\n[...] Simpleness of diet was prescribed to them, roots, pottage, gruels, eating flesh but thrice a-week, because the accustomed feeding on flesh is a dishonourable corruption of the body; and behold, their tables groan under delicate fare!

Edsel (with Bret Witter)) (score 3)\n\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Part 6: Stone Ocean\n\n(by Hirohiko Araki) (read 2019-07) (score 2)\n\nI was introduced to JoJo through the anime adaptation, of which I've watched all of parts 2 through 5. After the part 5 anime concluded, I decided to try the manga, and found copies of part 6. While I liked many of the characters and Stands, overall I liked Stone Ocean less than the other parts with which I'm familiar.\n\nI knowingly accept a baseline level of inanity in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and the nonsense is part of what gives the franchise its charm. However, I prefer my inanity to reside in character designs, Stand powers, and fight scenarios/locations which lead to tricky or unusual fights -- not in deus ex machina ass-pulls which end fights. When I read/watch JoJo, I want to see the main characters use their powers to solve ludicrous challenges with ridiculous tactics. But if the established characteristics of a Stand power are violated, the \"challenge\" aspect goes out of the window.\n\nFor my money, the worst sequence in part 6 is (spoilers) the resolution of Jolyne's fight with Miu Miu/Jailhouse Rock, which effectively ends once Jolyne reveals that four reflections only count as one fact . I'll admit I don't have a suggestion for a better end to the fight. Given that this is a serial comic; given that Jailhouse Rock has an extremely strong ability with with well-established limits; and given that the fight occurs relatively early (less than halfway through the series, IIRC); it's perhaps inevitable that Araki had to reach into his butt to get Jolyne out of this fight alive. But it didn't sit right with me, and it stayed at the back of my mind as I read the rest of the series.\n\nPerhaps I'm just fickle. The sequence at the end of part 5 where (spoilers) Diavolo notices Chariot Requiem's shadow, realizes that his soul is illuminating Chariot, and injures it by punching the area behind his own mind? That's the perfect level of JoJo bullshit.\n\nIf on a winter's night a traveler\n\n(by Italo Calvino) (translator William Weaver) (read 2019-07) (score 4 or 5)\n\nI was skeptical about this novel's premise, but my friend Matt guaranteed I'd like it.

This makes me nervous; instinctively I slow down; I prick up my ears to hear whether somebody is answering and I become impatient when the ringing continues. Continuing my run, I pass another house in which a telephone is ringing, and I think: There is a telephone chasing me, there is somebody looking up all the numbers on Chestnut Lane in the directory, and he is calling one house after the other to see if he can overtake me.\n\npg 135\n\nNothing is hung on the rest of the wall, nor does any furniture stand against it. And the whole house is somewhat similar: bare walls here, crammed ones there, as if resulting from a need to concentrate signs into a kind of dense script, surrounded by the void in which to find repose and refreshment again.\n\npg 144\n\nRenouncing things is less difficult than people believe: it's all a matter of getting started. Once you've succeeded in dispensing with something you thought essential, you realize you can also do without something else, then without many other things.\n\npg 248\n\nThe gaze of the reader opposite you, instead of resting on the book open in his hands, wanders in the air. But his eyes are not absent: a fixed intensity accompanies the movements of the blue irises. Every now and then your eyes meet. At a certain point he addresses you, or, rather, he speaks as if into the void, though certainly to you:\n\n\"Don't be amazed if you see my eyes always wandering. In fact, this is my way of reading, and it is only in this way that reading proves fruitful for me. If a book truly interests me, I cannot follow it for more than a few lines before my mind, having seized on a thought that the text suggests to it, or a feeling, or a question, or an image, goes off on a tangent and springs from thought to thought, from image to image, in an itinerary of reasonings and fantasies that I feel the need to pursue to the end, moving away from the book until I have lost sight of it. The stimulus of reading is indispensable to me, and of meaty reading, even if, of every book, I manage to read no more than a few pages. But those few pages already enclose for me whole universes, which I can never exhaust.\"\n\npg 253-254\n\nUtopia\n\n(by Thomas More) (year 1516) (read 2019-07) (score 3)\n\nPortnoy's Complaint\n\n(by Philip Roth) (read 2019) (score 4)\n\nBecause this city, as we know, is alive with girls wholly unlike Mary Jane Reed, promising, unbroken, uncontaminated young women--healthy, in fact, as milkmaids.

The existence of Gush Emunim disturbs your [secular Israelis'] experience of modern Western existence, including permissiveness and pacifism and internationalism; it interferes with your attempt to 'adjust' our society to fashionable Western values.

Quoted in \"An Argument on Life and Death (A)\", pg 115\n\nI have stated many times that Zionism is not a first name but a surname, a family name, and this family is divided, feuding over the question of a \"master plan\" for the enterprise: How shall we live here? Shall we aspire to rebuild the kingdom of David and Solomon? Shall we construct a Marxist paradise here? A Western society, a social-democratic welfare state? Or shall we create a model of the petite bourgeoisie diluted with a little Yiddishkeit? Amos Oz, in a speech given to members of the Ofra settlement. Quoted in \"An Argument on Life and Death (B)\", pg 128\n\nThe controversy between \"hawks\" and \"doves\" is fundamentally not about the future of the territories. It is a controversy over the nature of Zionism and even the meaning of the Jewish destiny. The hawks maintain that there is some ancient, mysterious curse of fate because of which we are doomed to eternal conflict with an inimical, alien world, no matter what we do, and therefore we had better slough off the image of the \"nice Jewish boy\" and become the big bad wolves for a change -- they are not going to love us anyway, but maybe they will fear us. Some wolf: with claws made in the United States and jaws donated by charity. Whereas the doves maintain that there is a certain correlation between our acts, our behavior, and the support we garner. He who shuts his eyes and sings ecstatically, \"All the world's against us\" forgets, for instance, the broad, vital, and fateful support we had in [1948] and again in [1967], despite the oil and assorted other delicacies the Arabs had to offer anyone who would line up against us. Amos Oz, pg 146\n\n\"It was a little strange. It annoyed me. The Zionists should be soldiers! Let them be a brutal enemy! They're not supposed to look like the old people of Nablus! And then I saw little children playing in the street. And then I saw an elderly Jewish laborer drag an ice box and load it onto his cart, which was drawn by a donkey. All of a sudden it became difficult to hate them. They looked too much like human beings. That trip caused a small crisis in me. Perhaps something similar happens to a Jew who comes to Germany for the first time and suddenly finds that the streets are not filled with uniformed Nazis with jackboots and whips, but that there are old people, poor people; that there are lovely children; that there are human beings without horns and tails.

Your suffering grants you rights, as does our suffering. I accept that. Do you know what the hardest thing for me to accept, the hardest thing for me to swallow? That we are two similar peoples. That our fate is interlocked. Am I happy about it? No, not at all. You are not happy about it, either. But nothing can be done about that any more: we are linked together. You are our destiny.

Either we will continue our stubbornness until we destroy each other completely, or we will recognize each other and recognize the tie between us, and then, maybe, there will be an end to the suffering.

Furniture is drab; costume is not.\n\nLife at the Bottom\n\n(by Theodore Dalrymple) (read ? 2018) (score 3)\n\nThe Shadow of the Torturer\n\n(by Gene Wolfe) (read ? 2018) (score 4)\n\nThe Design of Everyday Things\n\n(by Donald A. Norman) (read 2018) (score 4)\n\nThe Three-Body Problem\n\n(by Cixin Liu) (read 2017) (score 2)\n\nI read this in Chinese. Anyone lauding The Three-Body Problem has not read enough classic 20th-century science fiction, which expected some effort from its readers. Occasional memorable scenes (like the ship assault) and the solid Cultural Revolution sections cannot save the daft plot. One example: the alien \"videogame\" lacks the features of an actual videogame -- motivation, progression, reward -- and is more like a series of weird lectures. While people do play bad videogames, the way this one is described, it's hard to understand why Earthlings would play it in large numbers.\n\nBefore bothering with this, read Roadside Picnic, Dune, and Starship Troopers. [And don't whine to me about Heinlein.]\n\nHomage to Catalonia\n\n(by George Orwell) (read ? 2017) (score 4)\n\nBabbitt\n\n(by Sinclair Lewis) (read 2017) (score 3)\n\nThe Trial\n\n(by Franz Kafka) (translator David Wyllie) (read 2017) (score 4)\n\nCrime and Punishment\n\n(by Fyodor Dostoyevsky) (translator Constance Garnett) (read 2017) (score 3 or 4)\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest\n\n(by Oscar Wilde) (read 2017) (score 3)\n\nSons and Lovers\n\n(by D. H. Lawrence) (read 2017) (score 4)\n\nA first-rate novel. (I'm afraid I can't say the same about Amores, a collection of Lawrence's poems.)\n\nThe Good Soldier\n\n(by Ford Madox Ford) (read 2016) (score 3)\n\nThe Cyberiad\n\n(by Stanisław Lem) (score 5) (read 2014) (year 1974) (translator Michael Kandel)\n\nA phenomenally inventive collection of stories which is enjoyable by anyone, SF fan or no. While the protagonists are robots who ride spaceships and build poetry machines, and Lem employs endless riffs on scientific and technological diction, the stories in The Cyberiad are structurally myths, or fairy tales. My copy is, quite accurately, subtitled \"Fables for the Cybernetic Age.\"\n\nSynthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games\n\n(by Edward Castronova) (year 2008) (read ? 2009)\n\nIts entry on Google Books.\n\nBooks to Read\n\nWhat I hope to read.\n\nhttps://publicdomainreview.org/collection/etidorhpa\n\nDiplomacy (Henry Kissinger)\n\nChilde Harold's Pilgrimage\n\nThe Ring and the Book\n\nThe Seasons (John Thomson)\n\nPoems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery (John Clare)\n\nBourbon for Breakfast\n\nhttp://powermobydick.com/\n\nNever Leave Well Enough Alone\n\nHere Comes Everybody\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Nights\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monsters_and_the_Critics,_and_Other_Essays\n\nThe Power Elite\n\nDead Souls\n\nFrom Sea to Sea\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrack-Room_Ballads\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tunnel_(novel)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Girls_(graphic_novel)\n\nTristram Shandy\n\nEconomic History of China\n\nBeasts, Men, and Gods\n\nhttps://www.peterhessler.net/river-town/\n\nHot Potatoe (Mark Bell)\n\nJourney to the End of the Night\n\nhttps://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674987692 The Ethics of Authenticity\n\nhttp://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/modern/The-Work-of-Art-in-the-Age-of-Mechanical-Reproduction.html\n\nRed Sauce, Whiskey and Wine\n\nBriggflatts\n\nmovie Ivan Vasilievich\n\nmovie Kidnapping, Caucasian Style\n\nMr. Either Or (recommended by Tanner Greer)\n\nZong! an example of erasure poetry\n\nThe Gulag Archipelago\n\nThe Power of the Powerless\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_Songs#77_Dream_Songs\n\nHow Asia Works (Joe Studwell)\n\nSpycatcher (Peter Wright)\n\nThe Dictionary of the Khazars (Milorad Pavić)\n\nGod and Man at Yale (tried it, meh.)\n\nJohn Brown's Body\n\nPimp (Iceberg Slim)\n\nShakespeare: The Invention of the Human (Harold Bloom)\n\nThe Territory of the Historian (Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie)\n\nWealth and Power: China's Long March to the Twenty-first Century (Orville Schell, John Delury) [2014]\n\nElectric Incandescent Lighting (L.
