        "text": "Mauroy History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nFrance\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Mauroy family\n\nThe surname Mauroy was first found in Champagne, where the family has been traced to ancient times. Pierre Maury (c.1282-1324) was a shepherd in the Comté de Foix known for his depositions to Bishop Jacques Fournier who was hunting for Cathar heretics. He plays a prominent role in the French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's study \"Montaillou, village occitan de 1294 à 1324.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Mauroy family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Mauroy research.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Dampne n'es pas\n\nMotto Translation: Damned are not\n\nCitations +\n\nGenerals Who Served in the French Army during the Period 1789-1815.
