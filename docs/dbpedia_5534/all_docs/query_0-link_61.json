        "text": "CMS150 - Winter 2001\n\nTrials of Conscience: Litigation\n\nand the Rhetoric of Identity\n\nWeek 13, Class 1 Lecture Outline\n\nMontaillou\n\nThe third generation of Annalistes is best represented by the works of Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, who became editor of the Annales in 1967 and who is now one of France's most respected historians. Two of his more recent books are: Montaillou and Carnival in Romans (Le Roy Ladurie 1980, 1981). In these, without returning to the narrative history of the early twentieth century, he has restored the importance of short-term events and the individual.\n\nrestoration of narrative to writing of history\n\nvia writing of microhistory: La Roy Ladurie, Ginzburg, Davis\n\nwhat's good about narrative?\n\nwhat's a problem about narrative\n\nworld of language transforms the history you write\n\njust as Joan's history is transformed when she enters the linguistic world of the clerics, any history writing transforms the very events it trying to write about because the historian must enter the linguistic world he/she lives in [means the categories, terms of analysis, paradigms inherent in the culture for narration and analysis shape what history you can write]\n\nwouldn't this be true of any type of history?\n\nYes, but you still should think about this\n\nnarration relies on narrative structures/paradigms\n\ne.g. Dominick LaCapra, Hayden White: paradigms influence our interpretation: tragic, comic etc\n\nMore recently, various strands of cultural history writing have brought theoretical tools from literary and cultural studies into historical practice. Figures like Hayden White and Dominick LaCapra began arguing for such changes in the 1980s, but only in the 1990s did these openings begin to challenge certain traditional practices.\n\nIs this \"microhistory\" a history\n\nHistory is about the element of time - diachronic\n\nMicrohistory gives a synchronic account of town\n\nOccitania\n\nOccitan language also called Languedoc, or Provençal, a Romance language spoken by about 1,500,000 people in southern France. All Occitan speakers use French as their official and cultural language, but Occitan dialects are used for everyday purposes and show no signs of extinction. The name Occitan is derived from the geographical name Occitania, which is itself patterned after Aquitania and includes the regions of Limousin, Languedoc, the old Aquitaine, and the southern part of the French Alps, all of the populations of which are Occitan-speaking.\n\nThe name Languedoc comes from the term langue d 'oc, which denoted a language using oc for \"yes\" (from Latin hoc), in contrast to the French language, the langue d 'oïl, which used oïl (modern oui) for \"yes\" (from Latin hoc ille). Languedoc refers to a linguistic and political&endash;geographical region of the southern Massif Central in France. The name Provençal originally referred to the Occitan dialects of the Provence region and is used also to refer to the standardized medieval literary language based on the dialect of Provence.\n\nMontaillou was the last village which actively supported Cathars\n\nCatharism appeared in 12th century in Languedoc and it or variants of it were active in northern Italy, southern France and Balkans\n\nprinciples of Catharism\n\npractitioners were the true Christians (as opposed to official church who had abandoned doctrine of Apolstles)\n\ndualist\n\nstruggle between deities of good and evil characterize history\n\nspirtual is good; carnal physical is evil\n\norganization\n\npure elite [parfait]\n\nreceived consolamentum\n\nrequired committment to pure life (no sex or meet)\n\nusually perceived to be \"gentle,\" easy; itinerent [nb Pierre Maury's experience suggests that parfait could be no better/worse than priests]\n\ndidn't tithe\n\nordinary believers\n\nreceived consolamentum just before death and then undertook endura (total fasting)\n\nhistory of suppression\n\nBarons of n. France led crusades (beginning in 1209); // if not primary goal was annexation of Languedoc into France in 1229\n\nrevival in 14th century: Montaillou a center\n\neffectively wiped out in Montaillou by inquisition of Bishop Fournier in 1320\n\nprocedure\n\none or more denunciations\n\nsummons to appear [enforced by local lay authority]\n\noath on Gospels\n\ninterrogation by inquisitor\n\ncould be very lengthy, with accused under various decrees of restraint\n\nverdict announced\n\npenalty inflicted\n\nInquisition in Montaillou\n\nDominicans led inquistion and not techniquely related to diosces of Pamiers (whose Bishops had long ignored the heresy)\n\ne.g., 1308, Inquisitor of Carcassonne, Geoffroy d'Ablis, arrsed the entire adult populatoin of Montaillou\n\nFournier, as bishop of Pamiers, actively supported inquisition and worked closely with Dominicans\n\nJacques Fournier, Bishop of Pamier [modern dept of Ariège] from 1318 to 1325 [later Avignon Pope Benedict XII] born in 1280\n\nPamier in Comté de Foix very near Languedoc; satellite of France\n\npersonally led intterrogations\n\nrarely used torture\n\nfor him it was a matter of detecting sinful behavior and then of saving souls\n\nevidence\n\nregister of inquisition (2 vol lost)\n\n1) scribe wrote protocol [notes] at hearing\n\n2) from protocal scribe would prepare minutes\n\n3) scribes copied minutes onto parchment for Register\n\nproblem of language\n\n1) Register in Latin\n\n2) accused spoke mostly Ocitan, some Gascon; -> translation at some stage\n\n3) rough translation of minute (in latin) back into vulgar tongue read to witness/accused\n\nquantity of evidence\n\nFournier conducted 578 interogations (-> a lot of ev re town and its life)\n\n=> anthropoligical model possible (ethnohistory)/thick description\n\nquality of evidence\n\nassertions about people's belief made in context:\n\nof Inquisition - save self by ratting friends\n\ncriticism of Le Roy Ladurie's use of evidence\n\nnb: criticism: use of ev from other towns in region & language (screws up anthro models)\n\nlanguage issues\n\nsome q his ability to read medieval church Latin\n\nsome note that he never theorizes the language issue vis a vis the 'accuracy' of the testimony\n\nsome note that LRL recreates the register; e.g., he's obssessed with the sexual life of the town; Fournier manifestly was not\n\nsome note that LRL hates the Church and doesn't provide a \"Catholic\" side to the story; Fournier was a Cisterian reformer; the Cistercians were a reforming order\n\nsome note that he reuses the same quotes and for different points\n\nthe town\n\ntown consisted of 40 house, 200-250 individs; town isolated: few left, few visited\n\nshepherds, artisans and farmers, one old wine seller, a priest and a bailiff.\n\nPierre and Bernard Clergue (priest and bailif) members of family that had dominated region\n\nnb: not \"elite\" but, relative to others, quite wealthy\n\nhalf heretic in sympathies and beliefs\n\ntotally cynical in use of position and Inquisition to sustain dominance in town (via tithes, bailiff is secular authority who enforces priest/Churches claim to tithes)\n\nwealth, family connections, heresy and power: -> influence of Clergue's\n\neg of local institutions oppressing not because of institutional agenda (e.g. tithe) but because competing local powers used institutions to gain and assert influence\n\npriest was spy for inquisition as early as 1300\n\nperhaps at first thought to rat friends and save enemies\n\nin 1308 he locked up his flock at direction of Inquistion; those that didn't leave or were killed were released to his authority\n\nPierre saw himself as using Inquisition to pursue vendetta\n\nIn 1320 the much more local than Carcassone Inquistiont (Fournier) wiped out the Clerges when rivalry with a local family set them to informing against the preist [what calculation did they make?] - Fournier imprisoned, Clerge tried to have Carcassone released\n\nLa Roy Ladurie uses references in records to describe\n\necon/labor org of society\n\ndivision of labor via age and sex; diet\n\neconomy/society of shepherds [wide ranging, bold] vs village [timid, small scale - barter, loans & exchange of gifts]\n\nrelatively poor; no firm distinctions bt artisan, cit and noble; every did what came to hand\n\nland and sheep -> wealth\n\nno serfdom\n\nintinerant shepherds\n\nmaintained connections with local domus through lands where the pastured their sheep; lived in households [-> dependent member/independent member of domus]\n\ntended to be downwardly mobile or surplas (younger sons)\n\ncould be communication link bt Cathar villages; cf Pierre Maury\n\nreflected relatively marginal place of Montaillou in transhumance of Pyrenean economy [several hundred vs small flock farming where big distinction is bt those who graze own flocks in parish land and those who graze others' flocks i the mountain pastures]\n\ndomus as fundamental social unit [physical structure and people who live w/in it - old Med unit of org - obligation to sustain; economic and social id of individ dependent on continuing econ and social existence of house]\n\nnb: Catharism was a religion of and in the house - [vs church]\n\ndomus could protect Cathars w/in it from risk of their faiths in public\n\nCatharism spread from domus to domus (and therefore to inhabitants): -> domus was basis of social links bt Cathars\n\nInquisition perceived as attack on domus more than individual\n\nkitchen/hearth as heart of domus/ostal\n\nindicator of soc/econ status\n\nwas domus matrilineal or patrilineal? [anthro question]\n\npart of 'neigborhood' structure - neighbors cd unite against a domus to destroy it - local rivalry, politics expressed in terms of heresy and infoming\n\nlocal politics\n\noperated beneath radar of feudalism and manorial system\n\n\"official\" relationships were hierachical (Comté, Bishop), but practices of family and friendship far more influential (even if sometimes deployed through hierarchical relationships - priest, bailiff)\n\njust as Clergues mediated between Montaillou and the larger owrld, the Clergues needed mediators: ties w/ local nobels, church hierarchy, magistrates, Inquisition\n\nnote - obvious 'feuding behavior' going on which Le Roy Ladurie doesn't theorize; Cohen might say that these folks are tragically using the Inquisition as an arena for local feuding\n\nregional politics\n\nComte de Foix in theory controlled Comté de Foix; his chatelain and abyle were present in Montaillou\n\nDominican Inquistion in Carcassonne [a topic which the locals talked about much]\n\nBishop of Pamiers [who had as much interest in collecting tithes (which the Comtes had obstructed) as in heresy)\n\nKingdom of France - which de facto controled Comte and Comté\n\nnote: local interests would collapse religous heresy and opposition to French [and would have been right to]\n\nvillagers lived with a sense of suspicion and in anticipation of betrayal"
