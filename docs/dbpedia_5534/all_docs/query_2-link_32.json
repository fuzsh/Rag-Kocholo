Your editor has just returned from a year of ethnographic field research among\n\nNahuas of northern Veracruz, and the NN will resume its normal November and February\n\npublishing schedule. In this issue we have a number of news items, book reviews, and a\n\ndirectory update. Please send word of your activities so that the world-wide community\n\nof colleagues who share your interests will know what you are doing. It pays to\n\nadvertise, and the NN is the ideal forum for making important contacts.\n\nOf the many occurrences in the field last year, I would like briefly to recount one\n\nthat stands out as an example of the vitality of contemporary Nahua culture. Due to the\n\nEl Niño phenomenon, the Gulf Coast region of Mexico was hit with bizarre\n\nweather, including severe drought. The Nahuas of the Huasteca veracruzana region, where\n\nmy wife and son and I were living, responded with a series of ritual appeals for rain.\n\nOne such appeal involved a pilgrimage to a remote sacred mountain called Postectitla,\n\nnear the Nahua center of Chicontepec, Veracruz. Preparations for the pilgrimage began\n\nmonths in advance, while the ritual occasion itself lasted six days.\n\nPeople from neighboring villages began arriving days ahead of time to help in the\n\npreparations, which included the cutting of tens of thousands of sacred paper figures\n\nrepresenting significant spirit entities. For four days following preparations, ritual\n\nleaders constructed altars within and outside of a village shrine, and at a nearby\n\nspring. At each altar, paper figures were laid out as part of a complex array of sacred\n\nadornments. Amid swirling clouds of copal incense smoke, the ritual specialists chanted\n\nto the spirits and dedicated their offerings. At the center of each offering were the\n\ntwo sacred walking sticks believed by the Nahuas to be carried by thunder spirits as\n\nthey transport water from the Gulf to caves in the mountains. Many chickens and turkeys\n\nwere killed and their blood methodically spread on the paper figures.\n\nThe music, chanting, dancing, and dedication of offerings continued day and night\n\nfor four days. At dawn on the fifth day, about 50 participants packed carrying baskets\n\nand, along with your editor, began the more than nine-hour walk to Postectitla. The\n\ntemperature soared above 110 degrees F. as we struggled under our burdens along trails\n\nthat passed through the heart of Nahua country. We reached the Nahuatl-speaking town of\n\nIchcacuatitla that evening, dehydrated and exhausted. After a brief rest, the pilgrims\n\nbegan an all-night offering at a permanent shrine at the base of the sacred hill.\n\nPostectitla is the basaltic core of an extinct volcano rising 2,000 feet vertically\n\nabove the surrounding country and the small town at its base. Up to this point, the\n\nritual was more than an anthropologist could ask for, but the real surprise awaited our\n\narrival at the summit of this forbidding mountain.\n\nEarly in the morning we began the harrowing ascent, carrying 24 chickens and\n\nturkeys, and baskets loaded with offerings. We were led by a ritual specialist carrying\n\none of the sacred walking sticks, and followed by another carrying the second. A third\n\nof the way up, the participants constructed an altar and covered the paper figures with\n\nchicken and turkey blood as women danced and the ritual specialists chanted. Near the\n\nend, they imprisoned a living chicken in the cliff face as an offering to the mountain.\n\nTwo thirds of the way to the summit, we stopped and everyone helped to construct\n\nanother altar and again anointed paper figures with animal blood. Delegations were sent\n\nto two caves further up the mountain, one the home of thunder and the other the\n\ndwelling place of the female water spirit. More offerings were dedicated and the\n\nexhausted participants then made for the summit.\n\nHalf an hour later we emerged from the trees into the open and crawled our way to\n\nthe craggy top. The temperature was searing as the villagers constructed the final\n\nthree altars. One was dedicated to the mountain and another to the cross, and the\n\nritual specialists killed more chickens and turkeys for offerings. This time, however,\n\nno blood was spread on the paper figures arrayed on the altar. Instead, the bodies were\n\nflung over the edge of the mountain. The final altar was a circular platform mounted on\n\na pole about ten feet from the ground. Offerings were laid on the platform and paper\n\nstreamers were led away from the circular altar in all directions, like spokes from a\n\nwheel. After more than 25 years of research on the Nahuas of this region, I was\n\nprivileged to witness my first direct offering to the solar disk, representing the\n\ncreator deity who, in Nahua thought, animates the cosmos. It was a thrilling conclusion\n\nto an eventful year. The rainy season was delayed this year due to El Niño but\n\nas we descended Postectitla, we heard a loud thunderclap that our fellow pilgrims\n\ninterpreted as a sign that the offering did some good and that relief from the drought\n\nwas on the way. Safely back in Indiana, it is hard to believe that all of this took\n\nplace just a few months ago.\n\nFollowing several months of serious reverse culture shock, we are back operating as\n\nnormal. I am busy organizing field data in preparation for publication and readjusting\n\nto the academic routine. I hope that everyone enjoys this issue of the NN and that you\n\nwill use the publication as a forum to inform us about your own research interests.\n\nThe most severe problem facing the NN at the moment is that its budget has been\n\ndepleted. We are currently running on empty, so if you plan to contribute to the cause,\n\nnow is the time to do it. Loyal readers have kept the NN going for over 12 years and\n\nseveral of you have come through with contributions in the last few months. It is only\n\nbecause of such generosity that we have been able to produce the current issue. Please\n\nmail checks to the address below, and you will receive a letter acknowledging your\n\ncontribution. All money goes to offset printing and mailing expenses – there are\n\nabsolutely no administrative costs. I hope to hear from you soon.\n\nPlease mail announcements and contributions to the following address:\n\nAlan R. Sandstrom\n\nEditor, The Nahua Newsletter\n\nAnthropology Department\n\nIndiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne\n\n2101 Coliseum Blvd. East\n\nFort Wayne, Indiana 46805\n\nNews Items\n\n1. Our colleagues and loyal NN readers, Dr. Ursula Dyckerhoff and Prof. Dr. Hanns J.\n\nPrem of Germany, write of disturbing developments for those of us who work in Mexico.\n\nApparently, elements in the Mexican government are beginning to demand that foreign\n\nresearchers obtain an FM-3 visa in order to work in the country. These visas can be\n\ndifficult to obtain in a timely fashion and the result of this policy may well be to\n\ndiscourage foreign researchers from entering the country. The crackdown may be related\n\nto the situation in the Chiapas and it could have a chilling effect on any type of\n\nscholarly work that has political repercussions. Until now, most researchers have\n\nentered Mexico with a tourist card, which is relatively easy to obtain. Alfredo\n\nLópez-Austín forwarded the following resolution regarding this change in\n\nMexican governmental policy:\n\n“Los antropólogos reunidos en la ciudad de San Luís Potosí\n\ndurante la XXV Mesa Redonda de la Sociedad Mexicana de Antropología protestamos\n\nen contra de las medidas vejatorias y el aumento de trabas y requisitos que en los\n\núltimos meses han sufrido por parte de autoridades de migración y\n\nconsulados mexicanos nuestros colegas y estudiantes extranjeros que se encuentran en\n\nMéxico ó que pretenden venir al país en viajes de estudio,\n\ninvestigación ó participación académica.\n\n“Consideramos que estos actos gubernamentales:\n\na.Entorpecen el libre ejercicio de la ciencia.\n\nb.Son particularmente injustos frente a muchos profesionales que han contribuido\n\nnotablemente al saber antropológico mexicano.\n\nc.Dificultan la formación de nuevos cuadros, tanto nacionales como\n\nextranjeros.\n\nd.Atentan con acciones xenofóbicas contra las concepciones de dignidad humana\n\nque guian a la antropología contemporanea.\n\ne.Exponen a nuestros colegas y estudiantes mexicanos a reciprocidades vejatorias en\n\nel extranjero.\n\n“Consideramos, además, que el intento gubernamental de ocultar ante ojos\n\nextranjeros las violaciones de derechos humanos en territorios indígenas es una\n\nacción torpe e indigna que rebaja a México en el concierto de las\n\nnaciones. San Luís Potosí, S.L.P., México, 17 de julio de\n\n1998.”\n\nAs we receive news, we will keep readers posted about developments in this important\n\nchange in government policy.\n\n2. Eloise Quiñones Keber, professor of art history at the City University of\n\nNew York, received a 1998-1999 Guggenheim Fellowship to work on a project entitled “The\n\nReinvention of Aztec Art.” She will also be chairing a session with the same title at\n\nthe February 1999 meeting of the College Art Association in Los Angeles. Speakers and\n\ntopics include H.B. Nicholson (UCLA) on the creating of Aztec stone deity images,\n\nCatherine DiCesare (University of New Mexico) on Mexican Indians and Christian\n\nkingship, Khristaan D. Villela (College of Santa Fe) on Bustamante and the Aztecs in\n\nindependent Mexico, Barbara Mundy (Fordham University) on fakes and the reinvention of\n\nAztec art, and Lise Patt (Graduate Center, City University of New York, and The\n\nInstitute of Cultural Inquiry) on the Aztec Manifesto.\n\n3. Eloise Quiñones Keber also sends news about a new database on Nahua\n\nresearchers – the Tlacuilco Project: “The Project goal is to set up an Internet site\n\nthat would gather all relevant bibliographical information on as many scholars as\n\npossible in the field of Aztec/Nahua studies. The site is conceived as a repository of\n\nreferences of current research in the field, where researchers and other aficionados\n\nwill be able to check the state of current publishing in the field. Bibliographical\n\ndata sent by each scholar will be set up in an individual Web page. A simple search\n\ninstrument by alphabetical order of names will allow a rapid access to each page.\n\nFurther along, a more comprehensive search instrument would allow searching on specific\n\nterms or themes (i.e., publications on Tezcatlipoca, instead of merely publications by\n\na particular author).\n\n“What is required is for you to transmit your current bibliographical data, under\n\nthe following conditions concerning format:\n\na.Please cite according to the Chicago Manual of Style or Turabian format. The\n\nappearance of the data on the Web page may not reflect exactly the Chicago style\n\nbecause the original document will be translated into html format fit for publication\n\non the Internet, but details are being worked out for presenting a standard\n\nbibliographical style.\n\nb.Send your information using Word for Windows (any version up to and including\n\nWord97) or any other DOS-based program (even though it seems that Word for Macintosh\n\ncan be converted to Word for Windows). Send files either on diskette or preferably by\n\ne-mail (see addresses below).\n\nc.Please include the following information: Your name, current affiliation, and\n\ne-mail address (if you want it listed), along with a list of your publications\n\nincluding books (authored or edited, alone or in collaboration), chapters in collective\n\nworks or encyclopedias, articles, reviews. Give full bibliographic information on\n\ncoauthors, publishers, and pagination. At this time, I am planning to list only\n\npublished works (even if o.p.), but no in-press or forthcoming work.\n\n“This work is being done as a service to the field and is a totally unfunded,\n\nunsponsored, one-man band, so please be patient – work will be done one author at a\n\ntime. Send diskettes to: Michel Besson, 600 W. 115th Street Apt. 42, New York, N.Y.\n\n10025, or e-mail files to: ometzin@sysnet.net. The Web address of the Project is:\n\nhttp://www2.sysnet.net/ ometzin/aztec1.html.”\n\n4. John Bierhorst writes that his Nahuatl-English Dictionary and Concordance to the\n\nCantares Mexicanos (1985) has been reprinted by Stanford University Press, without\n\ncorrecting errata. Future printings will be corrected. In the meantime, anyone who\n\nwould like the errata sheet may write to: John Bierhorst, P.O. Box 10, West Shokan, NY\n\n12494.\n\n5. Stafford Poole sends the following announcement: “The Story of Guadalupe: Luis\n\nLaso de la Vega’s Huei tlamahuicoltica of 1649 edited and translated by Luisa Sousa,\n\nStafford Poole, C.M., and James Lockhart has been accepted for joint publication by the\n\nUCLA Latin American Center and Stanford University Press. Laso de la Vega was the vicar\n\nof the shrine of Guadalupe and published the first Nahuatl account of the apparitions\n\nof the Virgin Mary to the neophyte Juan Diego. This is the first translation of the\n\nentire work into English and the first into any language since that of Primo Feliciano\n\nVelázquez in 1926. The introduction and notes contain extensive linguistic\n\ncommentaries and analyses.”\n\n6. The NN has received this communique from Terry Stocker: “In 1994, I went to\n\nKorea. I wanted to live in Asia to broaden my perspective on the possibilities of\n\npre-Columbian contacts between the Old and New Worlds. I chose Korea for several\n\nreasons. First, they use a lunar calendar and all Koreans tell their birthday in the\n\nlunar calendar before the solar calendar. Of interest is the name of the lunar-rabbit\n\ndeity, Tokki (Tochtli in Nahuatl). This similarity probably existed at the time of\n\nsplitting at the Bering Strait.\n\n“My second concern was the utilization of seaweed in maritime diets. About 50\n\nspecies of seaweed are still used in rural Korea. Until recently, all newborn Koreans\n\nwere blessed with a bowl of dried rice and a stack of dried seaweed at the parents’\n\ndoor. After giving birth, women are still served mainly seaweed soup for six weeks.\n\nArchaeologically, seaweed consumption is almost impossible to detect. What is of\n\ninterest for pre-Columbian contacts is that seaweed is easily obtained throughout the\n\noceans. Chinese illustrations dating to 300 B.C. show junks out in the open ocean\n\nharvesting kelp with nothing more than a log pole. When I was first introduced to the\n\nproblem of pre-Columbian contacts, survival was the major hurdle. However, anyone\n\ncrossing the ocean could have survived on seaweed alone. What is of interest is that\n\nseaweed is also a source of fresh water. I hope to finish my ethnography on Korean\n\nculture change by 1999. When I went to Korea in 1994 there were no pizza parlors in my\n\nrural city, Naju, of 30,000. When I left in 1997, there were 17! I saw the old Korea.\n\nSeaweed consumption is rapidly decreasing.\n\n“I could go on at length about facts strengthening pre-Columbian ties, but the main\n\none, for me, was the bottomless jawed crocodilian in China. Some examples could be\n\nplaced side-by-side with Mesoamerican examples and there would be no difference. Until\n\nliving in Asia, I never believed in dragons. Now I do. In other words, there is no\n\nbiological foundation for crocodilians in Korea, but the dragon exists. Unlike Europe,\n\nthe Asian dragon is benevolent, maybe explaining why it is found in public art\n\nthroughout Asia. In the not too-recent past, Koreans believed each village to be\n\nguarded by a tiger spirit residing in a nearby hill.\n\n“Now that Asian scholars are alerted to the problem of the origins of New World\n\ncivilizations, we will hopefully be getting more information from their side of the\n\nworld. Because of my Asian sojourn, I have fallen behind in my Mesoamerican\n\npublications. I hope that by 2000 my two-volume work on the Mesoamerican augury table\n\n(260 day count) will be published. How I discovered that the 260 count was an augury\n\ntable and not a calendar, and how to read the entire table will be elaborated upon in A\n\nWalk Through An Aztec Dream. To begin to understand the 260 day count, one should\n\nrealize that the title in the Florentine Codex is “The Soothsayers,” not “The\n\nCalendar.” I have published one piece about this in Epigraphic Society Occasional\n\nPublications Vol. 22 (1993), and there is another in press. The essence of the\n\npublished article is that at least two scribes are responsible for plates 103 and 104\n\nin The Soothsayers. The styles are completely different. What is not to be disputed is\n\nthat 12 Rain on the last line of place 103 is a mistake. It should be 12 Water. What\n\nwill be new with this published note is that the only complete cycle (1 Jaguar)\n\ndepicted in plates 2-5 ends with another error. Instead of 12 Death it should be 13\n\nDeath. The calendrical use of the 260 day count is only of use when tied into the solar\n\ncalendar. From what I can tell, the calendrical use of the 260 day count is\n\npost-Columbian.”\n\n7.

By Eloise Quiñones Keber. Foreword by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie; illustrations by Michel Besson. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1995. Illustrations, figures, tables, maps, photographs, appendices, bibliography, Index. Pp. 365. $75.00 (cloth). ISBN-0-292-76901-6.\n\nThe history and culture of ancient Mexico are revealed to a large extent in\n\nhistorical chronicles and in pictorial codices. During many long years, information\n\nfrom these sources, so valuable to the historian, so interesting for the layman, had\n\nbeen unknown because innumerable documents, both written and pictorial, lay dormant in\n\narchives. Added to this long sleep was the unfortunate period early in the sixteenth\n\ncentury when the European conquerors considered that the codices, painted by tlacuilos\n\nor indigenous scribes, were work of the devil and therefore had to be destroyed.\n\nFurthermore, the material on which the codices were painted – animal skin or bark paper\n\n– is easily destroyed by unfriendly weather conditions or simply by ignorance in their\n\npreservation. The written chronicles of the colonial period also were ignored until\n\nscholars took them out of seclusion and presented them to the world. Fortunately the\n\nworld became interested in these treatises created in words or pictures, so the\n\nproduction of both continued, many in the sixteenth century or soon thereafter.\n\nIn the nineteenth or early-twentieth century, historians such as Eduard Seler, Zelia\n\nNuttall, Francisco del Paso y Troncoso, José Fernando Ramírez, and Manuel\n\nOrozco y Berra became interested in the wonderful world of painted images from ancient\n\nMexico. These were followed by early and mid-twentieth century scholars such as Alfonso\n\nCaso, Wigberto Jiménez Moreno, and Robert Barlow, to name a few. Written\n\nhistories (Sahagún, Duran, Motolinia, etc.) proliferated and fortunately\n\ncontinue to appear, while the pictorial codices came into their own. Many studies and\n\nfacsimiles were and are still produced in Mexico, the United States, and Europe.\n\nIn this universe of painted manuscripts an extraordinary volume has recently\n\nappeared ‹ a study of the Codex Telleriano-Remensis by Eloise Quiñones\n\nKeber. This primary source for the study of Aztec history and ritual is one of the few\n\nsurviving codices from this culture and presents to the reader a treasury of\n\ninformation about the people of Mesoamerica. This high-quality facsimile edition\n\nfocuses especially on the Aztecs prior to and after the Conquest. But above all,\n\ncongratulations go to Quiñones Keber, whose excellent work and years of\n\ndedication and research has been recognized by the granting of the Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nAward, given to Eloise in 1996 for her “outstanding contribution to humanistic\n\nlearning.” The University of Texas Press is also to be congratulated for this superior\n\nproduction, as is the Getty Foundation, which has made the fine volume available to\n\nscholars, libraries, and art lovers.\n\nThe Telleriano-Remensis receives its name from one of its owners, Charles Maurice Le\n\nTellier, and the city of Reims, of which he was archbishop and duke. Today the\n\nmanuscript on Italian paper is housed in the Bibliotheque Nationale de France. Because\n\nof its age (1553-1563) and its fragile material, the document was carefully kept away\n\nfrom visitors. In 1990, however, the Bibliotheque made a microfilm of this valuable\n\nsource so students could study it. And now the full color facsimile of the original\n\ncodex has come alive in this 1995 edition.\n\nThe manuscript is divided into three parts and presents pictures of the Aztec gods,\n\nthe tlatoani who ruled these people, activities such as hunting or war, the natural\n\nenvironment, some everyday scenes, and other subjects. Each folio carries a gloss and\n\nthe date of the events depicted. The first part contains seven folios on the veintena,\n\nthe twenty-day calendrical and ritual periods. There were eighteen of these periods\n\nplus five extra days in the prehispanic year. The second part of the codex is the\n\ntonalamatl or divinatory almanac, with its 260 days of thirteen trecenas in this\n\ncalendrical cycle. These are presented in seventeen folios. In the third part,\n\ntwenty-six folios tell the story of the Aztecs from the twelfth to the mid-sixteenth\n\ncenturies.\n\nThe first thing one sees on opening the book is the facsimile done on fine quality\n\npaper. An introduction by Quiñones Keber follows, called “Tradition and\n\nTransformation.” The author explains what pictorial codices are and relates the history\n\nof the Telleriano-Remensis. The physical description of the manuscript is given, along\n\nwith its form and content. Its provenience follows and we are introduced to its\n\ncreators: the tlacuilos (Eloise sees three, whom she calls “hands,” as of course they\n\nwere), and the annotators or commentators, whose gloss accompanied the images when they\n\nwere painted. An important part of this section is a comparison of the\n\nTelleriano-Remensis with the Vaticanus-A codex thoroughly studied by Eloise, who here\n\nintroduces Pedro de Ríos, the compiler of the Vaticanus-A. In 1898, Del Paso y\n\nTroncoso mentioned that Ríos also intervened in the Telleriano-Remensis as one\n\nof the “hands.”\n\nA detailed description of the annual ritual calendar is seen here (folios 8r to\n\n24r), with an explanation of the Mesoamerican calendrical system. Quiñones Keber\n\nnotes an important aspect of the Telleriano-Remensis, namely that it concentrates\n\nprimarily on the people themselves, not only on kings and conquests.\n\nThe tonalamatl is analyzed in the second part. The author makes this division of the\n\ncalendar clear and understandable – no easy task. A table explains how to read the\n\ntonalamatl, which is the calendrical document, and compares this with other codices,\n\nincluding the Vaticanus A, the Borbonicus, the Tonalamatl de Aubin, the Borgia, and the\n\nVaticanus-B.\n\nThe third part consists of a discussion of historical annals, with emphasis on Aztec\n\nhistory and the way it is presented in the Telleriano-Remensis. Here we see the Aztec\n\nmigration from Aztlan or Chicomoztoc to the Basin of Mexico, with Huitzilopochtli,\n\npatron deity, as leader, and glyphs of the places the migrants passed on the way\n\n(folios 25r to 28v). In the next seven folios, the Aztecs are seen dressed in animal\n\nskins and carrying bows and arrows, indicating their Chichimec origin. The Aztec\n\ntlatoanis from Acamapichtli to Motecuzoma the Second are presented next. Natural\n\ndisasters are seen at the same time as the rulers are shown.\n\nThe natural disasters interested me because they are still present in modern Mexico.\n\nNine earthquakes are represented from 1460 to 1521, portrayed by the ollin symbol,\n\nsimilar to the Saint Andrews cross or an “x.” There was a devastating snow storm in\n\n1447 and a plague of rats in 1506 (folios 32r and 41v). An eclipse of the sun is\n\nrepresented here, and a probable volcanic eruption. Today there is so much tectonic\n\nactivity in Mexico that this phenomenon attracts attention, especially as it is\n\nrepresented in history. Popocatepetl, which has been spitting and fuming in recent\n\nyears, is considered a young volcano, since it is only 135,000 years old. In 1519,\n\nthere was a serious eruption and volcanic activity was present up to 1527, much as it\n\nis today. Its eruptions and gas fumes, as well as those of its sister and older\n\nvolcano, Iztaccihuatl, have been both a menace and a friend, since they are always\n\npresent. Therefore it surprised me somewhat that more attention was not given to these\n\nfuming mountains and their menace to surrounding areas in the Telleriano-Remensis. This\n\nled to the question: Could the makers of the Telleriano-Remensis have originated in\n\nanother region in the Altiplano? If this had been the case, however, some indication of\n\nit would have been seen in the document.\n\nAztec conquests are represented not by battle scenes but by two military opponents\n\nfacing each other. The story of the Aztecs in prehispanic times continues up to the\n\narrival of the Spaniards, who are portrayed on horses or seated on European armchairs.\n\nReligious men are here also, from the year 1541 (folios 44r and 46r), although a\n\nbishop, identified by his footprints, is dated arriving in 1532. Folio 46r shows the\n\nresult of a great plague in 1544-1545 by the presence of cadavers wrapped in cloth.\n\nThe appendices to this volume are very useful and include a translation of the\n\nsixteenth century annotations, tables that include the meaning of each veintena (for\n\nexample, Panquetzaliztli, “Raising of the Banners”), the twenty day signs of the\n\nancient calendar represented in pictures and words, and the figures of the gods. These\n\nfine drawings were done by Michel Besson.\n\nMore little gems that fully explain the meaning of this codex are the comparison in\n\na table of the glyphs of sites on the migration with those represented in other\n\ncodices: the Azcatitlan, Boturini, Aubin, Mexicanus, and Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca.\n\nThe tlatoanis of Mexico, Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco, and Tezcoco are portrayed with the\n\ndates of their reigns and the toponyms of their cities. Events in the\n\nTelleriano-Remensis in still another table are depicted with European dates. Notes,\n\nbibliography, and Index provide valuable information for readers of this outstanding\n\nvolume. The work will open doors to an exiting world of history, art, and ritual for\n\nspecialists and others who are meeting Mesoamerica and the Aztecs for the first time.\n\nEloise Quiñones Keber is to be congratulated for having given us this\n\nsignificant and now readily available source.\n\nDoris Heyden\n\nInstituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia\n\nUtopia and History in Mexico: The First Chronicles of Mexican Civilization (1520-1569). By Georges Baudot; translated by Bernard R. Ortiz de Montellano and Thelma Ortiz de Montellano. Niwot, Colo.: University Press of Colorado, 1995. Pp. xix+566. $49.95 (cloth). ISBN 0-87081 401-X.\n\nThis impressive volume is a translation of the original French work Utopie et\n\nhistoire au Mexique (1977). Furthermore, it seems that this is an English translation\n\nof a Spanish translation of the French original. As a result of this rather interesting\n\npublication history, the comments here will be divided into two parts – one part on the\n\nmechanics of the work and its publication history, the other on the substance of the\n\nwork.\n\nAs a scholar I have serious reservations about a work that has been translated\n\ntwice. Anyone who has worked with materials in a foreign language appreciates the\n\ntremendous risk one runs in making translations. In this instance, it is entirely\n\nconceivable that many misunderstandings could have entered into the final English\n\nlanguage text. On the positive side, readers familiar with the translations of Bernardo\n\nR. and Thelma Ortiz de Montellano will be assuaged by the general high quality that\n\nthey manifest in their work. But also frustrating is an occasional lack of attention to\n\ndetail on the part of the editors. For example, there is no consistency in the spelling\n\nof the surname of Fr. Jacobo de Tastera, also Testera. While the former appears more\n\nfrequently in the book, the latter is the more common form.\n\nThe second concern is also one that falls into the realm of “it might have been.” In\n\nthe scholarly world, twenty years can either be irrelevant or critical. As it turns\n\nout, the field of early colonial studies has been dramatically revolutionized in the\n\nperiod between 1977 and 1995. While Baudot obviously revisited his text after 1977, the\n\nchanges have been light. Several works appear in the bibliography, but are not\n\nnecessarily referenced at the appropriate point in the text. Other works are totally\n\nabsent. Publications of relevant material, such as Maxwell and Hanson’s edition of the\n\nOlmos manuscript in the Tulane collection, are also absent. Although at various points\n\nin the work Baudot refers to the “ethnographic” work of Alonso de Zorita, the biography\n\nof that jurist by Ralph H. Vigil (University of Oklahoma Press, 1987), is absent both\n\nfrom the notes and bibliography. Similarly, although Louise Burkhart’s work The\n\nSlippery Earth, appears in the bibliography, it is absent from the notes when Baudot\n\ndiscusses the problems of translation of doctrine from Spanish to Nahuatl (p. 99).\n\nGiven these reservations, one is forced to look to the material itself and evaluate\n\nthe benefit of the work. In this regard the work is most valuable indeed. Although the\n\npoints made by Baudot are now twenty years old, they had not been easily available to\n\nscholars writing in English who were unable to gain access to the French original.\n\nBaudot offers a critically important hypothesis about the development of the Franciscan\n\n“ethnographers” and their eventual decline in the 1570s. His arguments are cogent and\n\nstrong. His command of the literature, especially of the primary sources upon which he\n\nbuilds his arguments, is second to none.\n\nBaudot’s work consists of nine chapters and a conclusion, arranged in a generally\n\nchronological fashion. It is not, however, strictly chronological. When Baudot\n\ndiscusses relationships among the works of various friars the thread of argument moves\n\nforward and backward. The first chapter is a general overview of the historiography of\n\nthe Conquest and settlement of New Spain up until 1568. This chapter focuses on reports\n\nof laymen and crown officials, and serves as a general background for Baudot’s\n\narguments. The second chapter turns to the efforts of the Franciscans in Mexico during\n\nthe “spiritual conquest.” This history is necessary because most of Baudot’s arguments\n\nand documents come from the Franciscan Order. In the third chapter, Baudot outlines the\n\nlife and career of Fr. Andrés de Olmos, whom he presents as the founder of the\n\nFranciscan ethnographic tradition. The subsequent chapter follows in this path by\n\ndetailing the ethnographic production of Olmos, reconstructing his opera from known\n\nsources and conjecturing about other sources long considered anonymous or doubtful.\n\nChapter Five discusses the life of Fr. Toribio de Benavente, Motolinía, while\n\nChapter Six considers his ethnographic production. With this solid background, Baudot\n\nthen considers the authorship of the Relación de Michoacán. This curious\n\ndocument resembles several produced at the behest of Olmos, but has until now lacked a\n\nclearly identified author. Baudot ascribes the work to Fr. Martín de\n\nCoruña and places it within the ethnographic tradition initiated by Olmos. Next,\n\nBaudot considers the career and ethnographic production of Fr. Francisco de las Navas,\n\nthe last of the ethnographers to be studied. Navas began his work as a companion to\n\nOlmos, later was a collaborator with Sahagún, and went on to produce several\n\nimportant items himself. In the last chapter Baudot discusses the confiscation of the\n\nethnographic production in the 1570s, when Sahagún and others were forced to\n\ndiscontinue their work.\n\nBaudot’s work is masterful. He draw upon the extant ethnographic sources and\n\nanalyzes them with great care and insight. He has clearly reconstructed the\n\ninterrelationships among the various Franciscans, and the few laypersons who\n\ncollaborated with them. He has analyzed with clarity the royal order to cease\n\ninvestigation into the native past. His conclusion is that this same royal policy both\n\nharmed the imperial structure by denying it information necessary to rule better its\n\nsubjects, and also has caused later generations of scholars to misunderstand the early\n\nmissionaries. Baudot has sought to correct this oversight. Again, none of this should\n\nbe novel to readers who are familiar either with this work in French or with Baudot’s\n\nnumerous articles that provide the grist for the book.\n\nIn summary, scholars in the English-speaking world should be pleased that his\n\nimportant work is finally available in English. There are, however, some reservations.\n\nThe translation was not brought about in a manner to best guarantee faithfulness to the\n\noriginal text. The publisher might have taken this opportunity to allow Prof. Baudot to\n\nbring his work up to date. But beyond this, it is an important work that anyone must\n\nread who is interested in the spiritual conquest or the ethnography of pre-Columbian\n\nMexico.\n\nJohn F. Schwaller\n\nUniversity of Montana\n\nWandering Peoples: Colonialism, Ethnic Spaces, and Ecological Frontiers in Northwestern Mexico, 1700-1850. By Cynthia Radding. Durham: Duke University Press, 1997. Pp. xx+404. $59.95 (cloth); $19.95 (paper). ISBN 0-8223-1907-1 (cloth); ISBN 0-8223-899-7 (paper).\n\nThis book looks at the late Colonial to early National period in central and\n\nnorthern Sonora through southern Arizona, a physically difficult area caught between\n\nthe better known Spanish colonies in the American Southwest and Mesoamerica. The\n\nindigenous inhabitants of the region were mostly Uto-Aztecan speakers, and Radding\n\nfocuses on the Opata, Pima, and Eudeve, although the Yaqui, Seri, Tarahumara, and the\n\nAthabaskan Apache all play a role. The author is a member of the Department of History\n\nat the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and she follows her earlier volume\n\nEntre el Desierto y la Sierra in presenting an ethnohistorical and anthropological\n\nperspective, eschewing the traditional approach of the historian. Anthropologists and\n\nethnohistorians will be the primary audience for this book, and there is much to\n\nrecommend it to researchers from beyond Mesoamerica and the American Southwest for its\n\ncoverage of the relationship between peasants and a colonial empire.\n\nRadding’s goal, she states in the Introduction, is to give voice to the subaltern\n\npeoples of the region and to show how their acts of resistance affected and altered the\n\nSpanish colonial project. I have doubts about whether these goals were convincingly\n\nfulfilled, but Radding’s book is undoubtedly a success as a data-rich anthropological\n\nanalysis of important socioeconomic transformations in an understudied region. This\n\nauthor knows her stuff, and has an intimate knowledge of the region and its historical\n\nrecord. Her appreciation of the variation in interests among Spanish and Indian groups\n\ncannot be done justice in this brief review.\n\nThe initial chapter, “Introduction: The Social Ecology of the Sonoran Frontier,”\n\nlays the groundwork. Radding summarizes much of the material from later chapters, but\n\nmost prominently focuses on a discussion of the social ecology theoretical orientation\n\nthat she follows throughout the book. She defines “social ecology” as an approach based\n\nin the ecological relations that guide the “political implications of resource\n\nallocation,” and determines how people “ascribe cultural values to their claims to land\n\nand labor.” Obviously these relationships are not determined by environment, since the\n\nSpaniards did not adopt a Sonoran lifestyle after their arrival. Nevertheless, native\n\npeoples had very different concepts of land use and mobility that would directly clash\n\nwith the Spanish agenda, and this is really the core of the book. Another concept\n\nRadding discusses is that of “ethnic space,” arguing that the Indian-land relationship\n\nprovided a sense of identity that transcended any kind of political or economic unit.\n\nBecause the book is heavily concerned with peasant class formation, she gives a working\n\ndefinition of this term that takes into account the variability within the category,\n\ncomposed primarily of Indians (on the bottom) and non-Indian vecinos on the top.\n\nFinally, Radding notes that she is following a model of “ethnogenesis,” i.e., rather\n\nthan evaluating native strategies by how many pre-Columbian traits survive over time,\n\nshe instead examines how Indians defended a shifting and dynamic ethnicity.\n\nThe remainder of the book is divided into three parts. The first section, “Los\n\nSonoras and the Iberian Invasion of Northwestern Mexico,” is devoted to a discussion of\n\nnative history both before and after the Conquest, in particular describing land-use\n\npatterns and how these would collide with Spanish concepts of the same. Chapters in\n\nthis book are not neatly compartmentalized, and readers must expect to find detailed\n\ndiscussions of a topic long before the chapter devoted strictly to that issue.\n\nChapter 1, “Ethnic Frontiers in the Sonoran Desert,” gives a good introduction to\n\nthe region, sketching the basic geographic, ethnic, and linguistic landscape. Radding\n\npays particular attention to the difficulties imposed by the climate and the unstable\n\nnature of agricultural production, and how these forced a dispersed settlement pattern.\n\nHer discussion of the pre Columbian archaeology is quite good and manages to relate\n\nmaterial culture to life ways more effectively than many archaeologists do. She focuses\n\nespecially on the Trincheras and Rio Sonora traditions, ranked societies fueled by\n\nextensive long-distance trade contacts but without rigid social stratification.\n\nThis is followed by a more traditional historical narrative of the Spanish conquest\n\nof this region, and of the failed attempts at imposing an encomienda system like that\n\nwhich had worked so well in central Mexico. Spanish colonial exploitation of Sonora\n\ndiffered primarily because of the lack of large-scale polities that could be easily\n\ntapped into, and due to the degree of nomadism practiced by northern groups. The lack\n\nof incentive for colonists to move into this area, at least until the discovery of\n\nsilver mines, meant that Spanish control was also much slower to develop. The Crown was\n\naccordingly forced to rely on religious missionization for a Spanish presence,\n\nprimarily embodied in the Jesuit order. The establishment of missions and the\n\nreducción of scattered Indian settlements into larger villages was a hardship,\n\nbut still an improvement over the earlier, violent encounters between Spaniards and\n\nIndians in the 16th and 17th centuries. The main focus of Radding’s book begins at this\n\npoint, circa 1700, when mining and stock raising were bringing in increasing numbers of\n\nSpaniards, and the Bourbon reforms leading to an increased colonial presence were about\n\nto begin.\n\nI might note parenthetically that a more extensive treatment of the 16th and 17th\n\ncenturies would have greatly altered the tone of the book. This period of nearly 200\n\nyears after the arrival of Spaniards on mainland America is bound to have had\n\npronounced effects on the Native American populations of Sonora. Disease swept through\n\nwestern Mexico ahead of the Spanish advance (see the Relación de\n\nMichoacán for a description of the effects of disease on the Tarascan political\n\nand social system) and Sonora probably suffered a similar devastation long before\n\nEuropeans ever showed up in the area. Radding notes that when the peoples of Sonora\n\nattempted to defend and hold onto their culture against the Spanish encroachment, it\n\nwas already as much colonial as pre-Columbian. But she might have noted that the\n\nprobable passage of disease through the region before the Spaniards ever got there\n\nwould have helped to tear down much of the pre-Columbian political and economic order.\n\nDisease by no means wiped out native culture, but a more extensive discussion of this\n\ndisastrous period would probably have made Radding’s examples of native resistance look\n\nrather late and ineffectual.\n\nChapter 2, “Amerindian Economy in Sonora,” is a detailed and interesting exegesis on\n\nnative subsistence methods, and Radding’s discussion virtually puts the reader into the\n\nshoes of a native Sonoran. A critical feature of agriculture in Sonora was its\n\ninstability thanks to the variable rainfall. Too little rain resulted in a minimal\n\ncrop, but too much washed away valuable soil. The resulting native pattern of feast or\n\nfamine depending on the current food supply would seriously interfere with the goals of\n\nthe Spanish colonial system.\n\nChapter 3, “Native Livelihood and Colonial Economy,” describes this collision by\n\nblending of quantitative data and individual portraits. The mission system was oriented\n\ntowards production of a limited number of staple crops to supply the nearby presidios\n\nand mining camps, and struggled to impose this system on the Indian populations, who\n\nhad adapted to the Sonoran environment by adopting a dispersed settlement pattern and a\n\nreliance on a wide array of resources. Sonorans were increasingly reluctant to plant\n\nthe communal mission lands and many protested by breaking off from the mission to\n\nreestablish the small hamlets of the past. The expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 left\n\nother Spanish colonists free to ensnare the Indians in debt servitude, even as Bourbon\n\nreforms continued to break up communal lands into private holdings.\n\nPart II, “The Intimate Sphere of Ethnicity: Household and Community,” is divided\n\ninto two chapters. Chapter 4, “Sexuality, Marriage, and Family Formation in Sonora,”\n\ndelves into vital statistics for the region. Radding examines the series of birth and\n\ndeath rates, and documents the fragmentation of Indian households due to labor\n\nmigration and disease. Indian households responded by becoming considerably more\n\nflexible; they accepted new members who had lost their own families, and temporary\n\nsexual unions formed while males were away at mining camps. These impermanent family\n\nstructures clashed with Spanish, particularly missionary, ideals, and were yet another\n\nsource of ethnic conflict. As in the previous chapter, Radding uses historical data on\n\nindividuals or families to liven up the quantitative statistics and give the reader a\n\nbetter feel for the era.\n\nChapter 5, “‘Gypseys’ and Villagers: Shifting Communities and Changing Ethnic\n\nIdentities in Highland Sonora,” concentrates on the fragmentation of community that\n\nsupplied the concept of “wandering peoples” to the title. The migration of Indians away\n\nfrom the missions undermined the communal land system, the invasion of the region by\n\ncattle herds led to increased erosion and destruction of agricultural land, and men\n\njoining the military for long campaigns against the Apaches left many of their towns\n\nstarved for labor.\n\nPart III, “Rival Proprietors and Changing Forms of Land Tenure,” has two chapters.\n\nChapter 6, “Land and the Indian Común,” follows the causes and effects of\n\nincreasing privatization of land. Radding makes good use of her knowledge of legal\n\nprocedures of the time and of individual case studies, to show exactly how the invading\n\nvecinos were slowly gaining control of land and water rights. The advance of Bourbon\n\nreforms brought increasingly formal procedures of land ownership for which the Indians\n\nwere unprepared. The land grabs that followed continued to chip away at communal land\n\nholdings until little was left, and the incentive even to retain Indian identity\n\ndisappeared.\n\nChapter 7, “Peasants, Hacendados, and Merchants: The Cultural Differentiation of\n\nSonoran Society,” discusses many of the themes of previous chapters (primarily land\n\nownership) as illustrated by individual cases from the community of Pitic and the\n\nvalley of Horcasitas. The chapter concludes with the final dismantling of communal and\n\nmission lands under the nascent Mexican government, provoked by the needs of a growing\n\nnon-Indian population in the far northwest.\n\nPart IV is titled “Ethnogenesis and Resistant Adaptation,” and pulls together many\n\nof the earlier threads. Chapter 8, “Cultural Endurance and Accommodation to Spanish\n\nRule,” and Chapter 9, “Patterns of Mobilization,” are both devoted to discussions of\n\nresistance among the Sonoran Indians and how it was manifested. Resistance, Radding\n\nargues, was mainly acted out through migration (voting with one’s feet) and actual\n\narmed rebellion, which appears to have occurred rather frequently in retaliation for\n\nill treatment and in frustration over the inability to defend their holdings in other\n\nways. Other forms of resistance that Radding discusses appear less effective, e.g.,\n\nIndians joined the Spanish military in order to gain some personal advantages, but\n\ntheir absence cost their communities dearly in terms of labor and defense.\n\nThe final chapter, “Conclusions: Contested Space,” provides a much-needed summary,\n\ndrawing together the many threads of this volume. The pre-contact Sonoran Indians had\n\nadopted a dispersed settlement pattern and broad-based subsistence strategy in order to\n\ndeal with a low productivity and risky agricultural regime. The Spaniards forced them\n\nin the 17th century into a concentrated mission-centered pattern and insisted that they\n\ncultivate a few staple products (maize, wheat) to feed the wider colonial market.\n\nIronically, the slow decline and breakup of the mission system was opposed by the\n\nIndians, thanks to the identification of the mission with communal land ownership.\n\nRadding concludes with an argument for the continued use of the social ecology\n\napproach, and notes that the time is ripe for more comparative analyses incorporating\n\ndensely peopled areas with sedentary populations.\n\nPrimary data in this book are not overwhelming, but there are plenty of maps, charts\n\nlisting the holdings of various missions, data on agricultural production and sales,\n\netc. The author is clearly in command of the literature for this area, and has a very\n\nrealistic sense of how the flexibility of stated ethnicity, the incompleteness of\n\nrecords, and the biases of one chronicler or another can affect interpretation of\n\nseemingly clear-cut quantitative data. I came away from this book impressed with\n\nRadding’s scholarship and her identification of important factors and\n\nrelationships.\n\nMy reservations and doubts relate to larger questions. Two of the primary objectives\n\nof this book were to give voice to the peasants, presumably Indian peasants, of Sonoran\n\nsociety, and to examine their strategies of resistance to the Colonial agenda. I am not\n\nsure that this first goal was fulfilled. The Opata, Pima, and Eudeve peoples are hard\n\nto tease out from the statistics and Spanish historical records. Although I applaud the\n\nuse of individual and family histories to flesh out the broader historical patterns\n\nfound in the documents, there is little Indian presence in these portraits, which\n\nbetter illustrate Spanish and vecino motives. Indians are usually being talked about by\n\nothers, rather than speaking for themselves. When they do speak out, it is their\n\ncommunity leaders who are doing the talking, and it is hard to know how representative\n\nthese views were of the village as a whole.\n\nRadding’s second goal is of very broad relevance to ethnographic and ethnohistorical\n\nresearch, and is the source of my primary reservations. What constitutes resistance as\n\nopposed to accommodation? Although Radding begins to address this thorny theoretical\n\nquestion, she veers off into a discussion of armed rebellion and migrations as\n\nmanifestations of this behavior. These may be plausible examples, but what about the\n\nstatement that the blending of native and Catholic religious beliefs constitutes\n\nresistance? Indian beliefs appear to have been so thoroughly expunged that there is no\n\ndiscussion of them in this book beyond a vague reference to shamanism. Of course,\n\nCatholicism is a good example of shamanism too (a holy man who goes to the land of the\n\ndead to heal others and returns from messages from the other side), and I’m not sure\n\nhow much of those “native” contributions really are that. I am not saying that only\n\nthose acts that are ultimately successful need to be considered resistance – they are\n\nall ultimately transitory – but surely more time is needed on this question. Resistance\n\nsounds great and it is a means of empowering the dead and making it appear that they\n\nwere not run over without a fight, but it’s not always a very accurate characterization\n\nof past events.\n\nMore questions abound. What are people resisting against? Who is resisting –\n\nIndians? Not exactly, since there was only occasional cooperation between different\n\ngroups. And shouldn’t we describe the recalcitrant behavior of the vecinos towards the\n\nmissionaries, or local Spanish officials against each other, as resistance? Or does one\n\nhave to be “ethnic” (Spaniards have no ethnicity, of course, since they are the\n\nestablishment) for acts to be considered resistance? Is resistance occurring at the\n\nlevel of the village community? Sometimes yes, when attempting to defend the integrity\n\nof their communal land, but these protests were mostly voiced by native leaders whose\n\nmotives were often not so altruistic towards their own constituents. Besides, choices\n\nof resistance versus cooperation more often led to intra-village conflict, not\n\nsolidarity. Rather, Radding describes a social environment in which individuals\n\nresisted, and attempted to improve their lot even at the expense of their own\n\ncommunities. Victories are typically small and personal. Radding eventually concludes\n\nthat native Sonorans followed a path that wound between accommodation and resistance.\n\nBut isn’t this what everyone does every day? What individual or group doesn’t toe that\n\nline between retaining our independence or giving it up to gain something else? Is this\n\na meaningful observation?\n\nI am more optimistic about the approach of social ecology as an integrated analysis\n\nof humans and the significance they ascribe to their subsistence relationships. Rather\n\nthan just focusing on how these ideologies are formed, however, we must also study why\n\nthey are retained in the face of overwhelming changes. The subsistence pattern to which\n\nthe native Sonorans kept returning was quite logical for the environment in which they\n\nlived. But what about the Spaniards? Why did they continue to try to impose production\n\nfor a colonial market on a population so incapable of maintaining it, and in the face\n\nof declining populations and continuing rebellions?\n\nI can recommend this volume as a detailed and savvy analysis of the Late\n\nColonial­Early National period of this corner of Mexico, and I believe I learned\n\nquite a bit about the interaction between Spanish colonialism and peasants. My\n\ndisagreements revolve around Radding’s optimistic portrayal of native Sonorans as\n\nperhaps more organized and effective at interfering with the Spanish agenda than I can\n\nsee.\n\nChristopher S.

Experiencing a savory,\n\nfragrant, and satisfying meal made from exotic ingredients, diners want more, and\n\nawakened appetites have provoked endless cultural upheavals to keep those flavors\n\ncoming. Today many people have global palates; in the United States, foreign dishes are\n\navailable in restaurants even in small towns, and exotic ingredients are widely sold in\n\nsupermarkets. In turn, people in distant corners of the world know and like foods\n\nutterly foreign to local biotic and cultural patterns.\n\nDissemination of foods has been an impetus for cultural interchange since trading\n\nbegan, and in the Age of Discovery (or Age of European Intrusion), the practice\n\naccelerated. Now, crops of the Old and New Worlds share the world’s menus. The New\n\nWorld definitely holds its own in the interchange, and Foster and Cordell’s volume\n\ndetails some of the most important – and sabroso – exports. The book presents papers\n\nfrom an unusual symposium in that great culinary capital, San Francisco. The program\n\nincluded tastings as well as ideas and information; this is an admirable approach\n\nbecause, like a picture, a taste is worth at least 1,000 words. The papers focus on how\n\nNew World foods became globally adopted, and why some foods failed to capture Old World\n\nattention. Thus there is a strong emphasis on food in history, along with some\n\ndiscussions of agronomy, food chemistry, and nutrition.\n\nThe first chapter, by Alan Davidson, reviews the general circumstances of\n\ndissemination of New World crops. Davidson uses histories of ecological change and\n\ndispersal (such as Alfred Crosby’s The Columbian Exchange) and more food-specific\n\nregional studies (Joop Witteveen’s study of the adoption of the potato in the\n\nNetherlands) to explore why rapid adoption in some places was mirrored by disinterest\n\nelsewhere. He concludes that adoption of food is difficult to predict, because it is\n\naffected by idiosyncratic cultural particulars. For example, Crosby had theorized that\n\nthe potato was adopted in Ireland not only because of its nutritional benefits but\n\nbecause the maturing crop was safe underground, not subject to destruction as war raged\n\nover the landscape.\n\nDaniel K. Early’s chapter on amaranth recounts a modern success story. This leafy\n\ngrain is higher in protein than wheat, rice, or maize, and its leaves are as\n\nnutritionally rich as spinach. Rediscovered in a deliberate search for underutilized\n\nfood crops, amaranth was made a special project of the Rodale Foundation. It is now\n\ncommercially available as breakfast cereal, crackers, etc. Amaranth’s lack of\n\ndistribution may have derived in part from sixteenth-century Spanish reaction against\n\nits ritual use; the Aztecs bound the seeds together by honey or other sticky liquid and\n\nformed representations of deities and mountains. Seeing such shapes of reddish amaranth\n\nseed, the Spaniards assumed that the Aztecs were using human blood as binder, and given\n\nother Aztec practices, one can hardly be affronted by this assumption on their\n\nbehalf.\n\nA similar reaction may have predisposed Spaniards to ignore quinoa, a mainstay of\n\nInca life and another leafy-grain nutritional powerhouse, as John F. McCamant notes in\n\nhis chapter. After potatoes, quinoa was the most important Andean food, able to grow at\n\nelevations up to 13,000 feet. Certain of quinoa’s features made its value less apparent\n\nto Europeans. The seeds have a bitter coat of saponin (the Incas made soap from it),\n\nand lacked the gluten necessary to make yeasted bread, a European dietary mainstay.\n\nSome strains are so carefully attuned to their native regime of day length and\n\ntemperature cycles that they will not produce seeds in other environments. McCamant\n\nrecounts the rather bizarre story of recent efforts to get quinoa accepted and grown\n\noutside the Andes. Without government backing or the interest of powerful supporters\n\nlike Rodale, investment in production is difficult. In the case of quinoa, three\n\ndynamic Americans worked for years and traveled extensively toward this end. In spite\n\nof one of them meeting a violent death in this effort, they succeeded to the extent\n\nthat quinoa, like amaranth, is now widely available.\n\nPotatoes, fundamentally important to Andean cultures, have long been a mainstay of\n\nEuropean and North American diets, but until a few years ago our choices were limited\n\nto baking or boiling varieties. We now know that beyond this dependable duo there lies\n\na rainbow of “non mainstream” potatoes, the subject of Noel Vietmeyer’s essay. He notes\n\nthat “the Incas cultivated almost as many species of plants as the farmers of all of\n\nAsia… to produce abundant food for fifteen million or more subjects” (p. 95). In the\n\nEuropean adoption of a few types of potato, at least five species were left behind, as\n\nwere some other root crops similar to carrots and other vegetables.\n\nWalton C. Galinat’s chapter on maize points out that Europeans first saw maize\n\nfields only four days after arriving in the New World. Maize has become a culinary\n\nstalwart in many regions due to its remarkable productivity and degree of\n\ndomesticability. This latter property has also presented an impediment to maize-origin\n\nresearch, resulting in the “lack of a stable base stock amenable to experimentation”\n\n(p. 56). Beans are another dietary staple with an active tendency toward hybridization,\n\nand Lawrence Kaplan and Lucille N. Kaplan present studies of bean genetic diversity,\n\nand efforts to determine the extent of range of variability (if any) among cultivated\n\nbeans.\n\nOn a recent stay in Honduras I fell right into the vanilla-flavored tourist trap\n\nthat Patricia Rain exposes in her essay. What a bargain my big bottle of “vanilla” was,\n\nand how smug I felt at having acquired it at the ancestral source. Or at least close to\n\nthe source. Rain describes how ancient Totonacs of the Gulf Coast of Mexico are\n\ncredited with developing the method of curing beans, which is essentially the same\n\ntoday. Totonacs learned the habits of the tropical vine and how to induce production of\n\npods. Aztecs got vanilla in tribute from Totonacs, and in turn the Spaniards also\n\ndemanded vanilla in tribute, and it was adopted in Europe as a flavoring agent,\n\nparticularly for chocolate. It was the favorite flavoring of Elizabeth I of England,\n\nand so treasured in France that they established plantings on their tropical island\n\nholdings, i.e., Madagascar, but with little success. The Totonacs continued to control\n\nthe world supply until the mid-nineteenth century, when secure propagation techniques\n\nwere established. Rain warns against mking the facile assumption that “vanilla”\n\nflavoring purchased in America’s tropical lowlands is natural, and sure enough, upon\n\nreading the fine print on the bottle’s label, I learned that my “authentic” vanilla was\n\nborn in a chemical plant.\n\nVanilla’s cultivational reticence led to the development of artificial impostors,\n\nbut chili peppers wrought their global flavor revolution naturally. Indigenous to South\n\nAmerica, they spread to Mesoamerican and the Caribbean, and then to the rest of the\n\nworld, lending “bite” to the cuisines of China, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. Jean\n\nAndrews notes that “The breadth of the chili peppers’ dispersion in Africa resulted in\n\npart from a Portuguese policy intended to prevent unity among slaves and thus to reduce\n\nthe likelihood of rebellion. This policy, which prohibited plantations from having\n\nlarge concentration of slaves from a single geographic area, stimulated a far-reaching\n\nsearch for new sources of slaves, and where the slave traders went, chili peppers\n\nevidently soon followed” (p. 86). In fact, chilis were relatively unknown in North\n\nAmerica (except for the Southwest and Florida) until they were spread by African slave\n\npopulations.\n\nChocolate’s history of use is more complex. In fact as John West points out,\n\nColumbus first brought it to Europe but had no idea of how to serve it. Only when\n\nCortés returned home did Spanish nobles share the favorite drink of the Aztec\n\ncourt, where Cortés and his men had shared so many cups of the frothy beverage\n\nwith their royal Aztec hosts. West’s article is richer in chocolate history and lore\n\nthan chemical analysis, and offers fascinating vignettes about chocolate’s value as an\n\nexpeditionary food as well as an aphrodisiac.\n\nGary Paul Nabhan’s Epilogue moves from the specifics of the foods we have come to\n\ncall our own to the complexity of the local ecosystems from which they came. He writes:\n\n“though it is useful to profile single American crops and their culinary uses, it is\n\ncrucial to keep in mind that each arose in a multidimensional ecological and cultural\n\ncontext” (p. 148). Native American farmers did not simply broadcast seed, they\n\npracticed finely-honed methods of plant cultivation. In Mexico, temporal cultivation\n\ninvolves plunging the digging stick into the soil until a damp level is found, and then\n\ninserting the seed, thus insuring that the seed will germinate, even in the marginal,\n\ncold and arid conditions of the Central Highlands. One can be certain that a farmer so\n\ncareful with each seed will preserve those that do best, and thus, as Nabhan writes,\n\nbecome “experts at single-plant selection” a technique which “favors locally\n\nspecialized ecotypes, farmer specific flavor and color variants, and culture-specific\n\nceremonial strains of crops” (pp. 149-50). Industrialization, the urbanization and\n\nproletarianization of native farmers, the Green Revolution and the Gene Revolution have\n\nplaced inexorable pressure for abandonment of the old, personal, complex ways of\n\nproducing food.\n\nAnd yet, some hope exists for saving, or perhaps salvaging the genetic variety of\n\nthese food crops, and the life ways of family farming. Among educated and influential\n\npeople exists a strong interest in pure, whole food, and in helping indigenous peoples\n\nmaintain their traditional livelihoods if they so choose. This may amount to shouting\n\ninto a hurricane, but some efforts along these lines have been effective:\n\norganically-grown crops are gaining an increasing share of the U.S. food market, and\n\nthe foods favored by the trend-setting restaurants and markets of the San Francisco Bay\n\narea, for example, are grown on small farms. Meanwhile, back in the real world, strong\n\npressures continue toward mass-production of food, absorption of small businesses into\n\nlarge corporations, and abandonment of extended family enterprises for wage-paying\n\njobs. At this writing, the forests of Indonesia are being burned by palm-oil plantation\n\nowners, creating a subcontinental smog that is devastating the economy, for example by\n\nreducing sunlight to a level below that required to grow basic subsistence crops. Like\n\nother acts of ecocide, this deliberate razing of the landscape reveals how fragile are\n\nthe family farms and their crops in the face of the casually destructive greed of\n\nagribusiness.\n\nSusan Toby Evans\n\nPenn State University\n\nPrimeros memoriales.

ISBN 0-8061-2909-3.\n\nI think it would be fair to characterize the Primeros memoriales as a pilot project\n\nfor the compilation of the Florentine Codex. Bernardino de Sahagún’s methodology\n\nfor eliciting information from informants was devised and tried in Tepepolco. From\n\nthere came the first of the data sets to be employed in the later “siftings” whereby\n\nSahagún and his Nahua assistants located and sought to clarify their informants’\n\ninconsistencies and omissions. Part of the material to be found in the Primeros\n\nmemoriales made its way into the Florentine Codex in more or less revised form, as\n\nindicated in the extensive annotation of the Sullivan volume. Much of it remains unique\n\nto the Primeros memoriales, and that which is only to be found in the early Tepepolco\n\ncompilation is of special interest to scholars.\n\nAlthough there is narrative in the Primeros memoriales (notably the fragmentary\n\nstory of a woman who dies before her time and visits Mictlan), much of the content\n\nconsists of lists and detailed captions for paintings. One of the most delightful for\n\nreaders is a menu of foods and beverages available to the elite, among them such\n\nenticing dishes as dark tortillas with sliced hot green chilis, fruit tamales with\n\nstewed turkey hen, and red-hot chilied tadpoles, perhaps accompanied by chocolate with\n\nwild honey or magnolia blossoms. The bill of fare for the macehualtin by comparison\n\nseems dry, with most of its protein derived from insects and worms, but fish roe\n\ntamales sound tasty (Sullivan 1997:202-203).\n\nOn the subject of food, there is also a description of a tamale festival at which\n\npart of the entertainment was the swallowing of live snakes and frogs by dancers known\n\nas Mazatecs. It is stated that at the conclusion of the feast, which took place only\n\nonce every eight years, old men and women wept to think they might not live long enough\n\nto take part in it again.\n\nElsewhere in the Primeros memoriales are lists of names appropriate only to males\n\nand only to females (pp. 253-55). One finds that the men’s name list leans heavily to\n\nanimal names (rabbit, deer, lizard, jaguar, eagle, hummingbird, etc.), while the much\n\nshorter female list has, in addition to birth-order names (first-born, younger,\n\nyoungest), plant and flower names (magnolia, maize tassel, calliandra). Unexpectedly,\n\nthe generic “flower” appears on the men’s name list in two variant spellings (xochitl\n\nand xuchitl) and also on the woman’s list without an absolutive suffix (xochi).\n\nPerhaps the most amusing lists of all are of bad names (pp. 210-12, 216-17) and\n\nquarrelsome insults (pp. 295-98). Here we learn that the Nahuah took out their\n\nexasperation by calling each other imbeciles, boors, and blockheads (“You are a bad\n\npiece of wood”) as well as coining some turns of phrase we might be tempted to adopt\n\n(“[You are] a miserable hole in the nape of the neck”). Ideally, the elite strove to\n\nbury criticism in admonitions, while the commoners went at each other with bare\n\nknuckles, making scurrilous references to sexual behavior and excrement. Not\n\nsurprisingly, the Primeros memoriales states that the object of such a public attack\n\nsometimes had no line of defense but could only listen and weep.\n\nDescriptions of ceremonies, processional standards, and costumes are illustrated\n\nwith detailed multicolored paintings. The feast of the eating of water tamales\n\nmentioned above has a full-page illustration showing, among many things, one Mazatec\n\ndancer about to swallow a snake, and two others with snake tails hanging from their\n\nmouths. When one reads the texts accompanying illustrations, one sees that the text\n\nsometimes describes a detail not visible in the painting. This is true for the apparel\n\nof deities, for instance. In the description of the water-tamale feast, the live snakes\n\nare shown but the live frogs (perhaps less of a challenge to the Mazatecs) are\n\nomitted.\n\nThe native artist who contributed to the Primeros memoriales incorporated fewer\n\nindigenous conventional representations into their paintings than did the artist of the\n\nFlorentine Codex, but one can find hill and water “glyphs,” footprints to indicate\n\ntravel, many speech scrolls, and a complete set of calendrical day signs with numbers.\n\nElaborate headdresses and processional standards are shown mounted on poles planted in\n\nbases that resemble flower pots.\n\nIn studying the song lyrics incorporated in the Cantares mexicanos and the Romances\n\nde los señores de la Nueva Espana, James Lockhart and I found a pervasive\n\npattern of eight-verse songs arranged in four verse-pairs, each pair sharing a common\n\ncoda of vocables such as ohuaya and huiya. The famous twenty sacred hymns of the\n\nPrimeros memoriales do not show such pervasive four-ness, but it is notable that most\n\nof them consist of even numbers of verses, and there is considerable evidence of paired\n\nvocable codae as well, honoring the Mesoamerican principle of duality.\n\nSullivan’s paleography presents the content of the Primeros memoriales as it appears\n\non the page. It is a very polished product of meticulous research, and few errors have\n\nbeen introduced in the printing. The first I noticed was on p. 125, where\n\n“teiztaltiaia” should read “teizcaltiaia.” A second follows on p. 132, “onetleneviloc”\n\nfor “onetlaneviloc.” Most of the typographical errors I came across were, however, in\n\nthe footnotes, where there are instances of missing cedillas and some spacing problems\n\nas well as extraneous, missing, or wrong letters in English as well as Nahuatl.\n\nIn the English translation and notes, Nahuatl place names and personal names are\n\nregularized but not entirely consistently. For instance, there are many instances of\n\ninitial “yy” for “y” in the Primeros memoriales. These cannot all be resolved into\n\nthird-person possessive prefixes or reductions of the particle “yn,” as for example\n\n“yyequachtli” (“tobacco pouch”) and “yyetecumatl” (“tobacco vessel”) on p. 117. In the\n\nnotes, the former is referred to as “yiequachtli” and is derived from “Yietl (yetl)”\n\n(“tobacco”). Because there is no “ie” diphthong in Nahuatl, this is a poor way to\n\nresolve the issue. According to R. Richard Andrews, it is iyetl.\n\nLikewise, the deity associated with merchants appears in the Primeros memoriales as\n\n“yyacatecutli,” “yyacatecutlj,” and “yyacatecuhtli.” In three English headings, the\n\nform is consistently “Yacatecuhtli.” In running text in the English translation, the\n\nname appears as “Yiacatecuhtli” (p. 58). In four footnotes the name appears in the\n\nfollowing ways: “Yiacatecuhtli or Yacatecuhtli,” “Yiacatecuhtli (Yacatecuhtli),” and\n\n“Yacatecuhtli” (twice). The Index heading is “Yacatecuhtli (Yiacatecuhtli).” It would\n\nhave been more user-friendly to resolve everything in the headings, English\n\ntranslation, and Index consistently as “Yacatecuhtli.”\n\nThe word for “lord” (freestanding and compounded ) has been consistently regularized\n\nto “tecuhtli” in accordance with longstanding convention. But in the Primeros\n\nmemoriales itself, the spelling “tecutli” dominates other spellings by a ratio of about\n\nseven to two. The spelling I prefer (and this preference is shared with other\n\ngrammarians of Nahuatl) of “teuctli” with the syllable final inversion of the digraph\n\n“cu” to “uc” runs in last place in the Primeros memoriales itself with just three\n\ninstances.\n\nThe “tecuhtli” spelling convention leads readers to think that this culturally\n\nsupremely important word is trisyllabic, that it contains the vowel “u,” and that it\n\nhas a stem-final “saltillo” (glottal stop), none of which is the case. The spelling\n\npronunciation [tekutli] is unfortunately pervasive among scholars (as opposed to\n\nspeakers) of Nahuatl. Sullivan herself believed the orthographic “h” represented a\n\nglottal stop, as can be see in her 1976 Compendio de la gramática náhuatl\n\n(p. 19), where she offers “tecu’tli” as an example of a word containing a stem-final\n\nsaltillo. I find it regrettable that this edition of the Primeros memoriales\n\nperpetuates the misunderstanding.\n\nA translation produced by Sullivan and then scrutinized by Anderson and Dibble is\n\nimpervious to criticism, for surely these three scholars knew the Sahaguntine corpus as\n\nfew of us could hope to, and they had vast resources to call upon when making decisions\n\nabout specific instances. However, in the song sung at the tamale feast mentioned\n\nabove, where participants wore bird costumes and imitate birds in their dances, the\n\nonly way we can hope to take “quechol” as a singing, nectar-sipping roseate spoonbill\n\nis as part of a hilarious burlesque; no actual spoonbill has ever done such things.\n\nThe footnote annotation is not so reliable as the English translation. As presented,\n\nwe cannot sort out Sullivan’s notes from those of the editors. In general, they are\n\ndistinctly backwards looking to Eduard Seler and Angel María Garibay (the latter\n\na powerfully influential figure in Sullivan’s formations as Nahuatl scholar), rather\n\nthan forward-looking to Nahuatl scholarships since the 1950s. The retrospective is\n\nvaluable, but the notes tend to dictionary-look-up analysis uninformed by the rules of\n\nNahuatl morphology. One old chestnut is the glossing of “Tonacacihuatl” as “Lady of our\n\nsustenance” (p. 140, n. 16). The English translation itself consistently and correctly\n\ntranslates “tonaca-” as “sustenance,” derived from the verb stem tona-, but the note\n\nfalls into the old habit of identifying “to” with the possessive prefix “our.” The\n\nindisputably correct analysis is to be found already in Horacio Carochi’s 1645 grammar\n\nof Nahuatl.\n\nIn another note, there is a nonsensical etymology for “Chantico” (p. 112, n. 94).\n\nThe locative suffix -co does not attach to nouns with the ligature -ti, and the noun\n\nchantli refers to “home” not “house.” The translation of “Tezcacoac Ayopechtli” (p.\n\n110, n. 87) as a personal name “Mirror-Snake Tortoise Bench” is, to be charitable,\n\nquestionable. The derivation of xocotl from xiuh-ocotl (p. 60) is unlikely, and\n\n“toxcauia” has no huaqui or huatza in it to supply a sense of drying up (p. 58, n. 13).\n\nAppeals to archaism and the use of “ligatures” to explain away problems of\n\nmorphological analysis are too frequent in the notes.\n\nThere is some terminology in the notes the reasons for which I do not understand.\n\nWhy is octli referred to as “the fermented saccharine exudate of the maguey”? Does this\n\nsay more than “octli” or “pulque” or “fermented maguey sap”? Why the repeated use of\n\nthe longer adjective form “gentilitial” where others use “gentile”? And is an\n\n“asterism” different from a constellation?\n\nBook design has created some problems with locating things and matching the material\n\nin the Sullivan volume to the facsimile. For one thing, pp. 38-54 in the Sullivan\n\nvolume have no page numbers printed on them. The Index refers to items in tables on\n\nthese pages, but finding them is hard work.\n\nThe sacred hymns, which appear written solid in verses in the facsimile, have been\n\nbroken into lines after the practice of Garibay. There is no evidence for these line\n\nbreaks in the original, and the imposition of lines in the Sullivan volume is the\n\nsingle departure from true paleography of the Primeros memoriales.\n\nThe Primeros memoriales exists in two pieces and is, moreover, fragmentary. Some\n\npages have been lost. Eloise Quiñones Keber explains and illustrates the\n\ngatherings of the Palace manuscript and the Academy manuscript in her introductory\n\nessay to the Sullivan volume. But as it happens, the order decided upon for the\n\nSullivan volume is slightly different from the order of the photographic facsimile. In\n\nthe facsimile, folios 72r-80v are inserted between 68v and 69r. In the Sullivan volume,\n\nfolio 72r follows part of folio 69r, which resumes after folio 80r. (Folio 80v is\n\nblank, so it contributes nothing to the Sullivan volume.)\n\nI think users of the Primeros memoriales need to know about these concerns. The most\n\nimportant thing to know about the Primeros memoriales, however, is that it is now\n\navailable in facsimile, paleography, and translation. The facsimile is colorful and\n\nfascinating to look at. The Sullivan volume makes it supremely useful. Although four\n\nyears have separated the publication of these volumes, libraries need to be reminded\n\nthat the volumes are needed, and they are needed together.\n\nFrances Karttunen\n\nRenvall Institute, University Helsinki\n\nAt the Desert’s Green Edge: An Ethnobotany of the Gila River Pima. By Amadeo M. Rea. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1997. ISBN 0-8165-1540-9.\n\nAmadeo Rea’s At the Desert’s Green Edge stands as a major work in ethnobotany, of\n\ninterest to southwestern and Mesoamerican anthropologists as well as to ethnobotanists\n\nin general. Mesoamericanists will find in this volume information relevant to the\n\nreconstruction of pre Columbian environments, the indigenous classification of nature\n\namong Uto-Aztecan speakers, and an historical account of the Spanish (and later Anglo)\n\ncolonization and transformation of a people. Rea has combined the anthropological\n\ntradition of avocational devotion, professional scientific rigor, and respect for\n\nanthropological subjects that represents the best of traditional ethnography. As such,\n\nhis work is a breath of fresh air in today’s contentious, socially constructed, and\n\noften empirically void anthropology.\n\nThis work is an ethnobotany of the Gila River Pima, or Akimel O’odham as they call\n\nthemselves. Rea draws on 35 years of research with the Akimel O’odham. His approach is\n\nto utilize memory culture of eight elder Pima along with the recollections of other\n\nPima to construct the most complete ethnobotany possible. He strives to unite the emic\n\nviews of the Pima with the etic views of botanists and anthropologists. In order to\n\naccomplish this, he presents his data in extensive appendices according to Pima\n\nclassifications of plants. Rea’s use of Pima categories to organize his ethnobotany\n\nhelps to accomplish another of his goals, that of providing an ethnobotany that would\n\npreserve the knowledge of Pima elders for future generations of Pima.\n\nRea’s basic ethnobotanical data stand on their own, but there are a number of\n\nmethodological and theoretical issues he also treats in this volume that make the\n\nparticulars of Pima ethnobotany of general importance to anthropologists and\n\nhistorians.\n\nMethodologically, Rea draws from the work of ethnoscientists such as Brent Berlin\n\nand Cecil Brown. He contributes to the general finding of ethnoscientists that, when\n\nnaming species and genera, folk taxonomies and Linnean taxonomies tend to be in\n\nagreement, indicating that people from varied cultural perspectives nonetheless are\n\nperceiving the same objective reality (p. 84). My one criticism of the book is that, in\n\nhis treatment of methodology, he does not address the pioneering work of Harold Conklin\n\nor the rigorous methodological work of Oswald Werner. Nonetheless, any ethnobotanist\n\nwould benefit from a reading of Rea’s work. Rea also presents important information\n\nregarding historical changes in the lexicon of Pima plant categories that adds further\n\nlinguistic relevance to his work.\n\nRea’s reconstruction of Pima culture history and the ecological history of the\n\nAmerican southwest and northern Mexico is another empirical and theoretical\n\ncontribution of the book. Rea’s culture history of the Pima combines a regard for the\n\nbasic scientific (and as yet inconclusive) evidence, along with a respect for\n\nindigenous myths as oral histories. Rea links the Pima solidly with other Uto-Aztecan\n\nspeakers to the south, and therefore other Mesoamerican people. He also notes the\n\ncultural ecological implications of the recent arrival (ca. 350 years ago) of the Pima\n\nin the upper Sonoran desert of southern Arizona.\n\nRea provides a thorough, if not stark, ecological history of the Gila and Salt river\n\nwatersheds in which he details the systematic destruction of this environment in\n\nespecially the past 100 years. Rea purposively drew his data from older informants who\n\nwould have remembered early 20th century ecological conditions, before the effects of\n\nriver diversion, drought, mining, lumbering, and herding were fully felt in the Gila\n\ndrainage. Rea details how and when the natural environment of the Gila was destroyed,\n\nas well as why, and so provides policy implications for modern land management in arid\n\nregions.\n\nRea also addresses the dietary and health effects of the transformation of the Gila\n\nwatershed and Pima culture/economy, and he spells out exactly how these changes have\n\nled to the incredibly high incidence of diabetes in this and other indigenous\n\npopulations formerly pursuing a gathering-hunting-horticultural way of life in arid\n\nregions.\n\nRea’s book has much to recommend it for the ethnobotanist, linguist, historical\n\necologist, archaeologist, and Mesoamericanist. The solid empirical information\n\npresented on the environment and on Pima perspectives on the environment destine this\n\nbook to be a true volume of record to which scholars will refer for decades to come.\n\nAdditionally relevant for Mesoamericanists, especially archaeologists, is the mixed\n\ngathering-hunting-horticultural economy that Rea reconstructs for the early Pima, which\n\nmay provide a reasonable analog for the alleged early wanderings of the Aztecs in\n\nnorthern Mexico. With all due inferential precautions, Rea may provide a useful tool\n\nfor unraveling the economic origins of some of Mesoamerica’s most celebrated\n\npeoples.\n\nLawrence A.
