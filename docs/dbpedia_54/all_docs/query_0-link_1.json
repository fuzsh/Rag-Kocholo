        "text": "Son of [father unknown] and [mother unknown]\n\n[sibling(s) unknown]\n\nDescendants\n\nProfile last modified 26 Mar 2024 | Created 24 Sep 2014\n\nThis page has been accessed 1,205 times.\n\nBiography\n\nNOTE: careful to not confuse him with another Nicolas Prevost, Prevost-154\n\nNicolas (Prevost) Prevôt dit Colet was born about 1700, possibly in La Rochelle, France, according to the baptism record of his son, [[Prevost-1000|Antoine Provost].[1]\n\nNicolas (~23) married Yves Dubos (~16) around 1723 in La Louisiane, Nouvelle-France.\n\nTheir known children were:\n\nPierre (c.1724)\n\nJoseph (c.1726) m.1749 Magdeleine Mayeux[2]\n\nNicole Provost (1729)\n\nAnne Provost (c.1734-1742)[3]\n\nNicolas Prevost (1740-1741)\n\nAntoine Provost (1742)[4]\n\nMarie Francoise (c.1745)[5]\n\nPaul Prevost (1748 - 1785)\n\nOn the general census dated January 1, 1726, of all inhabitants of the Louisiana Colony, Nicolas Prevost, wife, child, for a total of 3, are on the list of \"Habitants of Natchitoches.\"[6]\n\nOn May 16, 1734, Colet signed as sponsor at the baptism of Marie Louise, an adult, female, \"Indian, belonging to Lebrun, Habitant.\" The other sponsor was Marie Anne Bocquet. On March 31, 1737 Nicolas Prevot and Catherine Mesliers sponsored the baptism of Nicolas, adult nègre, belonging to Jacques de la Chaise. On December 10, 1737, Nicole Prevôt's son Nicolas was baptized, having been born on December 3, 1737. His record reads: \"legitimate son of Nicolas Prevôt 'dit' Colet and Yves Dubos. Godparents: Pierre Prevôt (s) and Nicole Prevôt (x).[7]\n\nHe is on the census of 1745 taken in Pointe Coupée Parish, Louisiana, with his wife, Ines, four children (Pierre, Joseph, Antoine and Marie Francoise), two slaves and 25 arpents in cultivation with corn, beans and tobacco.[8]\n\nNicolas died before 7 January 1762, possibly in Pointe Coupee, Louisiana. On that date, he was listed as deceased on the marriage record of his daughter, Marie Françoise, to Bernard Auricoste, which took place in New Orleans.[9] No death record for him was found in Natchitoches church records or in Pointe Coupee Church records.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nInès DUBOT and Nicolas PRÉVOST were likely married about 1723/4 but a marriage record has not been found.\n\nCopied in part from \"MY LOUISIANA LINEAGE Including Early Pointe Coupée & Avoyelles Colonists; ...and their roots in Canada, France, Germany...\" Cathy Lemoine Sturgell, Louisiana Lineage. Some editing has been done to the copied text.\n\nNicolas PRÉVOST was born about 1700. The location of his birth is unknown. (It was originally believed that his parents were Claude PRÉVOST and Marie RORNIE/RERNIE and that he was born in Longuille, Bishopric of Boulogne, France. However, a 1732 marriage record in New Orleans for a Nicolas Prévost, s/o Claude and Marie Rernie, is likely where this erroneous parentage came from. The Nicolas who married in 1732 could not be our Nicolas (who married c1723) because our Nicolas was married to Yves Dubos from 1723 until c1760.) He appeared in the census in 1726 in Natchitoches (Natchitoches Post), Louisiana, with his wife, Ines, and one child.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Diocese of Baton Rouge Catholic Church Records, vol. 1b; Pointe Coupee Records, 1722-1769, (Baton Rouge, LA: Diocese of Baton Rouge, 2002) pp. 149-152;\n\nAntoine Provost (Nicolas Provost and Ives Dubau) native of La Rochelle, France, bn. 29 Nov. 1742 bt 9 Jan. 1743 spo.
