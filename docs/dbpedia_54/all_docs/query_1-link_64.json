        "text": "Integrins regulate adhesion-dependent growth, survival and invasion of tumor cells. In particular, expression of integrin αvβ3 is associated with progression of a variety of human tumors. We recently described an adhesion-independent role for integrin αvβ3 in pancreatic cancer and other carcinomas resulting in increased anchorage-independent tumor growth in vitro and lymph node metastases in vivo. These effects required recruitment of c-Src to the β3 integrin cytoplasmic tail, leading to c-Src activation. Pharmacological blockade of c-Src kinase activity with Dasatinib or genetic suppression of endogenous c-Src not only inhibited anchorage-independent growth, but also suppressed metastasis in vivo. We now show that αvβ3 exerts these effects through ligand-independent clustering of the integrin on the surface of non-adherent tumor cells. Self-assembly/clustering appears to be a unique property of αvβ3 relative to other integrins and is dependent on c-Src recruitment to αvβ3. These data describe a c-Src-dependent self-assembly property of αvβ3 leading to increased anchorage-independence and malignancy of tumor cells expressing this integrin. These findings also underscore the potential benefits of using Src inhibitors, such as Dasatinib, for treating patients with αvβ3-expressing solid tumors.

Philadelphia (PA): AACR; Cancer Res 2010;70(8 Suppl):Abstract nr 3841.\n\nUnlabelled: Summary. Background: Vinculin links integrins to the cell cytoskeleton by virtue of its binding to proteins such as talin and F-actin. It has been implicated in the transmission of mechanical forces from the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton of migrating cells. Vinculin's function in platelets is unknown. Objective: To determine whether vinculin is required for the functions of platelets and their major integrin, α(IIb) β(3) . Methods: The murine vinculin gene (Vcl) was deleted in the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage by breeding Vcl fl/fl mice with Pf4-Cre mice. Platelet and integrin functions were studied in vivo and ex vivo. Results: Vinculin was undetectable in platelets from Vcl fl/fl Cre(+) mice, as determined by immunoblotting and fluorescence microscopy. Vinculin-deficient megakaryocytes exhibited increased membrane tethers in response to mechanical pulling on α(IIb) β(3) with laser tweezers, suggesting that vinculin helps to maintain membrane cytoskeleton integrity. Surprisingly, vinculin-deficient platelets displayed normal agonist-induced fibrinogen binding to α(IIb) β(3) , aggregation, spreading, actin polymerization/organization, clot retraction and the ability to form a procoagulant surface. Furthermore, vinculin-deficient platelets adhered to immobilized fibrinogen or collagen normally, under both static and flow conditions. Tail bleeding times were prolonged in 59% of vinculin-deficient mice. However, these mice exhibited no spontaneous bleeding and they formed occlusive platelet thrombi comparable to those in wild-type littermates in response to carotid artery injury with FeCl(3) . Conclusion: Despite promoting membrane cytoskeleton integrity when mechanical force is applied to α(IIb) β(3) , vinculin is not required for the traditional functions of α(IIb) β(3) or the platelet actin cytoskeleton.\n\nIntegrins regulate adhesion-dependent growth, survival and invasion of tumor cells. In particular, expression of integrin alpha(v)beta(3) is associated with progression of a variety of human tumors. Here we reveal a previously undescribed adhesion-independent role for integrin alpha(v)beta(3) in pancreatic cancer and other carcinomas. Specifically, alpha(v)beta(3) expressed in carcinoma cells enhanced anchorage-independent tumor growth in vitro and increased lymph node metastases in vivo. These effects required recruitment of c-Src to the beta(3) integrin cytoplasmic tail, leading to c-Src activation, Crk-associated substrate (CAS) phosphorylation and tumor cell survival that, unexpectedly, was independent of cell adhesion or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation. Pharmacological blockade of c-Src kinase activity or decreased expression of endogenous alpha(v)beta(3) integrin or c-Src not only inhibited anchorage-independent growth but also suppressed metastasis in vivo, yet these manipulations did not affect tumor cell migration or invasion. These data define an unexpected role for an integrin as a mediator of anchorage independence, suggesting that an alpha(v)beta(3)-c-Src signaling module may account for the aggressive behavior of integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-expressing tumors in humans.\n\nGroup IVA cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)alpha) catalyzes release of arachidonic acid from glycerophospholipids, leading to thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) production. Some platelet agonists stimulate cPLA(2)alpha, but others require fibrinogen binding to alphaIIbbeta3 to elicit TxA(2). Therefore, relationships between cPLA(2)alpha and alphaIIbbeta3 were examined. cPLA(2)alpha and a cPLA(2)alpha binding partner, vimentin, coimmunoprecipitated with alphaIIbbeta3 from platelets, independent of fibrinogen binding. Studies with purified proteins and with recombinant proteins expressed in CHO cells determined that the interaction between cPLA(2)alpha and alphaIIbbeta3 was indirect and was dependent on the alphaIIb and beta3 cytoplasmic tails. Fibrinogen binding to alphaIIbbeta3 caused an increase in integrin-associated cPLA(2)alpha activity in normal platelets, but not in cPLA(2)alpha-deficient mouse platelets or in human platelets treated with pyrrophenone, a cPLA(2)alpha inhibitor. cPLA(2)alpha activation downstream of alphaIIbbeta3 had functional consequences for platelets in that it was required for fibrinogen-dependent recruitment of activated protein kinase Cbeta to the alphaIIbbeta3 complex and for platelet spreading. Thus, cPLA(2)alpha and alphaIIbbeta3 interact to reinforce each other's functions during alphaIIbbeta3 signaling. This provides a plausible explanation for the role of alphaIIbbeta3 in TxA(2) formation and in the defective hemostatic function of mouse or human platelets deficient in cPLA(2)alpha.\n\nFocal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays a key role in mediating signaling downstream of integrins and growth factor receptors. In this study, we determined the roles of FAK in vivo by generating a megakaryocyte lineage-specific FAK-null mouse (Pf4-Cre/FAK-floxed). Megakaryocyte and platelet FAK expression was ablated in Pf4-Cre/FAK-floxed mice without affecting expression of the FAK homologue PYK2, although PYK2 phosphorylation was increased in FAK-/- megakaryocytes in response to fibrinogen. Megakaryopoiesis is greatly enhanced in Pf4-Cre/FAK-floxed mice, with significant increases in megakaryocytic progenitors (CFU-MK), mature megakaryocytes, megakaryocyte ploidy, and moderate increases in resting platelet number and platelet recovery following a thrombocytopenic stress. Thrombopoietin (Tpo)-mediated activation of Lyn kinase, a negative regulator of megakaryopoiesis, is severely attenuated in FAK-null megakaryocytes compared with wild-type controls. In contrast, Tpo-mediated activation of positive megakaryopoiesis regulators such as ERK1/2 and AKT is increased in FAK-null megakaryocytes, providing a plausible explanation for the observed increases in megakaryopoiesis in these mice. In Pf4-Cre/FAK-floxed mice, rebleeding times are significantly increased, and FAK-null platelets exhibit diminished spreading on immobilized fibrinogen. These studies establish clear roles for FAK in megakaryocyte growth and platelet function, setting the stage for manipulation of this component of the Tpo signaling apparatus for therapeutic benefit.\n\ncPLA2 catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of platelet membrane glycerophospholipids, leading via cyclooxygenase to the production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a platelet agonist. One function of TXA2 and other platelet agonists is to activate the fibrinogen-binding function of integrin αIIbβ3 through a series of biochemical steps known as inside-out signaling. While some platelet agonists stimulate cPLA2 activity and TXA2 production during inside-out signaling, others appear to require fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 and subsequent outside-in signaling through the integrin to elicit TXA2 production. However, the precise relationship between cPLA2 and αIIbβ3 is unclear. Here we have discovered that cPLA2α, the principal cPLA2 isoform in platelets, interacts with αIIbβ3 and participates in both inside-out and outside-in integrin signaling. A pool of cPLA2α was constitutively associated with αIIbβ3 in human and murine platelets, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies to cPLA2α or αIIbβ3. Although the mode of interaction of cPLA2α with αIIbβ3 is unknown, vimentin, an intermediate filament protein known to bind to cPLA2α and integrin β tails, co-immunoprecipitated with both cPLA2 and αIIbβ3 from platelets. Selective induction of fibrinogen binding to platelets by MnCl2 caused a detectable increase in cPLA2 activity in both whole platelet extracts and αIIbβ3 immunoprecipitates. However, this response was not observed in platelets from mice deficient in cPLA2α or in human platelets pre-treated with pyrrophenone, a selective cPLA2α inhibitor. Integrin-dependent activation of cPLA2α had functional consequences. First, thromboxane A2 produced in response to fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 was required for the recruitment of activated protein kinase Cβ to the αIIbβ3 signaling complex, an event known to be required for cytoskeletal reorganization and full platelet spreading on fibrinogen. Second, platelets from cPLA2α-deficient mice exhibited reduced spreading on fibrinogen compared to platelets from wild-type littermate controls (P < 0.05). Similarly, human platelets pre-treated with either pyrrophenone or a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist spread poorly on fibrinogen compared to vehicle-treated control platelets (P < 0.05). Third, cPLA2α-deficient platelets stimulated by the GP VI collagen receptor agonist, CRP, exhibited decreased binding of soluble fibrinogen (P < 0.05). These studies establish that cPLA2α can function in association with αIIbβ3 to produce a pool of TXA2 that promotes integrin-dependent activation of protein kinase Cβ, cytoskeletal reorganization and platelet spreading. Given the previous demonstration of prolonged bleeding times and protection from thromboembolism in cPLA2α-deficient mice, these results imply that normal platelet function requires cPLA2α activation both upstream and downstream of αIIbβ3."
