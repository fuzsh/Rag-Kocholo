        "text": "Fine Art Reproductions\n\nWe produce Prévost art prints, often referred to as posters, as art reproductions on high quality papers using digital printing technology. We print them on Canon iPF 9400 large format printers. These systems are characterized by an extremely high resolution and thanks to the 12-color ink system also by an enormously large color space and finest color gradations. The quality is significantly better than e.g. on color laser printers or in offset or screen printing. And best of all: You can choose between different papers, such as art paper, canvas, photo paper and watercolor paper. In addition, you determine the size and section of the picture »Visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon« itself.\n\nCanvas on Stretcher\n\nOur canvas prints of the motif »Visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon« are printed on high-quality canvas using high-end digital printers (Canon iPF 9400). The prints impress with the finest color nuances, large color space and UV resistance. They are hand-crafted onto real stretcher frames. And everything is guaranteed Made in Germany! Please note that under the product Art Print you can also order this motif printed on canvas without stretcher frame.\n\nFramed Pictures\n\nPictures from Nicolas Prévost you can also buy framed. In addition to a variety of wood and aluminum moldings we also offer passe-partouts and various surface protection options. All frames are handmade in our own factory. Naturally all framings are Made in Germany. Individually framed, the picture »Visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon« really comes into its own!\n\nAlu Composite Pictures\n\nAluminum composite panels consist of a sandwich construction of aluminum sheets (outside) and PVC material (inside). The picture »Visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon« is printed with an UV printing process. Thanks to the floating suspension, you can create a modern ambience in every home. Especially offices and shops benefit from the futuristic design."
