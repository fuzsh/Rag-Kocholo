        "text": "Summary\n\nFrom the 1750s, natural stone specimens provided a rich source of inspiration for new enamel effects designed to attract and retain clients for luxury gold snuffboxes and porcelain. The blue enamel ground on this box is imitating the highly prized stone, lapislazuli (and perhaps the hardstone snuffboxes produced in Paris in the 1730s and 40s). The colour was probably developed in the SÃ¨vres porcelain factory and is used on snuffboxes from the 1760s until the French revolution. It was evidently used on gold boxes before 1764 as the posthumous inventory of Madame de Pompadour's effects includes a snuffbox with a 'fond de lapis, Ã©maillÃ©e' (an enamelled lapis ground).\n\nThe central enamel plaque is painted en grisaille (in shades of grey) with a charming scene of putti playing cards.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the worldâs great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996."
