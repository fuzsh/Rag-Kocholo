        "text": "von Willebrand disease (VWD)-type 2B is characterized by gain-of-function mutations in the von Willebrand factor (VWF) A1-domain, leading to increased affinity for its platelet-receptor, glycoprotein Ibα. We engineered the first knock-in (KI) murine model for VWD-type 2B by introducing the p.V1316M mutation in murine VWF. Homozygous KI-mice replicated human VWD-type 2B with macrothrombocytopenia (platelet counts reduced by 55%, platelet volume increased by 44%), circulating platelet-aggregates and a severe bleeding tendency. Also, vessel occlusion was deficient in the FeCl3-induced thrombosis model. Platelet aggregation induced by thrombin or collagen was defective for KI-mice at all doses. KI-mice manifested a loss of high molecular weight multimers and increased multimer degradation. In a model of VWF-string formation, the number of platelets/string and string-lifetime were surprisingly enhanced in KI-mice, suggesting that proteolysis of VWF/p.V1316M is differentially regulated in the circulation versus the endothelial surface. Furthermore, we observed increased leukocyte recruitment during an inflammatory response induced by the reverse passive Arthus reaction. This points to an active role of VWF/p.V1316M in the exfiltration of leukocytes under inflammatory conditions. In conclusion, our genetically-engineered VWD-type 2B mice represent an original model to study the consequences of spontaneous VWF-platelet interactions and the physiopathology of this human disease.\n\nThrombocytopenia and increased platelet clearance observed in von Willebrand disease-type 2B (VWD-2B) may be explained by platelet apoptosis triggered by the constitutive binding of VWF to its receptor, glycoprotein Ib (GPIb). Apoptosis was assessed in platelets from two patients with a severe VWD-2B mutation VWF/p.V1316M and from mice transiently expressing VWF/p.V1316M. We now report that the VWD-2B mutation VWF/p.V1316M which binds spontaneously to its receptor GPIbα does not induce apoptosis. In 2 unrelated patients (P1 and P2) exhibiting different VWF plasma levels (70% and 36%, respectively, compared with normal pooled human plasma given as 100%), inner transmembrane depolarization of mitochondria, characteristic of apoptotic events was undetectable in platelets, whether washed or in whole blood. No or a moderate phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure as measured by annexin-V staining was observed for P1 and P2, respectively. Expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax, and caspase-3 activity were similar to control platelets. In the VWD-2B mouse model expressing high levels of mVWF/p.V1316M (423%), similar to what is found in inflammatory pathologies, no significant difference was observed between mice expressing mVWF/WT and mVWF/p.V1316M. These results strongly argue against apoptosis as a mechanism for the thrombocytopenia of severe VWD-2B exhibiting the VWF/p.V1316M mutation.\n\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening disease that presents with thrombocytopenia, disseminated thrombosis, hemolytic anemia, and organ dysfunction. The etiology of TTP has revealed that patients share a deficiency in plasma protease a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13), the enzyme responsible for cleaving ultra-large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers into nonthrombogenic fragments. Therefore, existing TTP mouse models were developed by targeted disruption of the ADAMTS13 gene. ADAMTS13(-/-) mice are mostly asymptomatic in the absence of a trigger, as redundant proteases appear to take on VWF processing. As an alternative approach to creating one such model, we devised a strategy based on the expression of a cleavage-resistant VWF mutant in mice. The creation of a disulfide bond within the A2 domain of VWF was found to render VWF multimers resistant to proteolysis by plasma proteases under flow. Furthermore, mice expressing the murine VWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C mutant present with symptoms characteristics of acute TTP such as thrombocytopenia, red cell shredding, accumulation of VWF-rich thrombi in the microvasculature, and advanced TTP symptoms such as renal dysfunction and splenomegaly. Because this model appears to faithfully emulate the pathophysiology of TTP, it should prove most useful in the study of microangiopathic diseases and their treatment."
