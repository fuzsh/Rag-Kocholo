        "text": "A group of New Jersey public education supporters has released an open letter to the State Board of Education to reject Gov. Chris Christie’s new choice for a superintendent for Newark public schools, saying that he will be no more effective than his last controversial choice.\n\nLast month, superintendent Cami Anderson, who the governor appointed in 2011 and repeatedly defended, year after year, despite a rebellion in the city against her reform policies, finally left her post. This happened shortly before Christie jumped into the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination (but surely the timing was a coincidence).\n\nBecause Newark schools have been under state control since 1995, the governor selects the person to run the district schools. His choice to succeed Anderson is Christopher Cerf, who was New Jersey’s controversial education commissioner from 2011-2014. The New Jersey Board of Education is scheduled to vote on the nomination July 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnderson was strongly disliked in Newark for her management style as well as her “One Newark” reform plan, which eliminated neighborhood schools in favor of a citywide lottery that ostensibly gave parents more school choices. The result was the closure of numerous schools, mass firings of teachers and principals, a rise in charter schools, and at least seven complaints of civil rights violations that have been investigated by the U.S. Education Department. Last year, dozens of clergy in Newark warned Christie that school reform was causing so much “unnecessary instability” that they were “concerned about the level of public anger” over the issue. A new mayor, Ras Baraka, was elected last year on his anti-Anderson reform platform.\n\nCerf, as education commissioner, supported Anderson’s “One Newark Plan” and was a big supporter of charter schools. On Feb. 23, 2011, the Star-Ledger reported this about Cerf, who was at the time the acting education commissioner before his full confirmation:\n\nA consulting firm hired by Newark’s mayor to overhaul the city’s failing schools was founded a few months ago by Christopher D. Cerf, the state’s acting education commissioner, and still lists his Montclair home as its New Jersey address.\n\nThe firm, Global Education Advisors, is at the heart of a controversial proposal to open nearly a dozen new charter schools — a move that would reshuffle thousands of city kids and one that has already drawn angry response from parents.\n\nCerf acknowledged Tuesday that he had a hand in the creation of the firm, but said he was no longer connected with it.\n\nNewark residents have repeatedly called for the state to let the city run its own school district again. The state took over Newark schools because of their poor performance, but little progress has been reported under state control. As Sarah Blaine, a New Jersey public school parent, attorney and activist, wrote on her blog:\n\nAs a believer in the critical importance of local democratic control over our nation’s public schools, I cannot agree more that after 20 years, it is time for the people of Newark to choose their own leaders for their children’s public schools. Our public schools are intended to prepare our children for the responsibilities and duties of democratic citizenship. How can Newark’s children internalize democratic principles if their parents and community members are told, decade after decade, that the adults of Newark cannot be trusted to democratically govern their children’s schools?\n\nHere’s the open letter:"
