        "text": "Defunct American toy company\n\nIdeal Toy Company was an American toy company founded by Morris Michtom and his wife, Rose. During the post–World War II baby boom era, Ideal became the largest doll-making company in the United States. Their most popular dolls included Betsy Wetsy,[1] Toni, Saucy Walker, Shirley Temple, Miss Revlon, Patti Playpal, Tammy, Thumbelina, Tiny Thumbelina, and Crissy.[2] The company is also known for selling the Rubik's Cube.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\n1903-1945[edit]\n\nMorris and Rose Michtom founded the \"Ideal Novelty and Toy Company\" in Brooklyn when they invented the Teddy bear in 1903.[3][4][5] Rose had made the original \"Teddy's Bear\" for their children. Morris and Rose sent a bear to President \"Teddy\" Roosevelt, as well as asking permission to use his name for the bear. Roosevelt \"adopted\" the bear and had it present in his campaign and on display at White House functions.[6] After Morris Michtom's death in 1938, the company changed its name to the \"Ideal Toy Company\",[7] and Michtom's nephew Abraham Katz became chief executive.\n\nDuring World War II, the company's value rose from $2 million all the way to $11 million.[8] The company's dolls were so popular during the post–World War II baby boom era, they began selling dolls under license in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Brazil.[citation needed]\n\n1946-1968[edit]\n\nKey Ideal employees during the 1950s, '60s, and '70s were Lionel A. Weintraub and Joseph C. Winkler. Weintraub, the son-in-law of Abraham Katz, joined the company in 1941 and rose to become president, chairman of the board, and chief executive officer. Winkler joined Ideal in 1956, rising to vice president by 1971.[9]\n\nIn 1951, Ideal partnered with its competitors the American Character Doll Company and the Alexander Doll Company to establish the United States-Israeli Toy and Plastic Corporation. The company was created to produce material for toys in Israel; the U.S. Ideal CEO Abraham Katz was named president of the new company.[10]\n\nIn 1953, Ideal won the licensing rights to produce the U.S. Forest Service's Smokey Bear. They kept their licensing until 1968 when the U.S. Forest Service switched to Knickerbocker.[5]\n\nIn 1968, Ideal joined the New York Stock Exchange.[5]\n\nIn 1968, the American Character Doll Company filed for bankruptcy, and Ideal acquired the defunct company's dyes, patents, and trademarks,[11] as well as specific products like the \"Tressy\" Gro-Hair doll.\n\n1970-1990[edit]\n\nIn late 1971, Ideal joined the New York Stock Exchange; valued at $71 million, it was one of the U.S.'s top three toy companies.[8][5]\n\nBy 1970, Ideal had outgrown its manufacturing complex in Hollis, Queens. The company wanted to build a new plant in College Point, Queens, but was unable to strike a deal with the Lindsay administration. Consequently, the company opened a new facility in Newark, New Jersey, in the early 1970s, while continuing to operate its factory in Hollis.[3][12][13]\n\nIn 1979, a Hungarian inventor, Erno Rubik, pitched his \"Magic Cube\" to Ideal Toy Company, who renamed it the \"Rubik's cube.\"[14][15][16] The toy was sold in stores beginning in 1980.[14]\n\nIdeal had earnings of $3.7 million in fiscal year 1979–1980, but lost $15.5 million in fiscal year 1980–1981. (Sales both years averaged around $150 million.)[9] Trying to maximize profits on the Rubik's Cube craze, Ideal filed civil suits in May 1981 against dozens of distributors and retailers selling knockoff cubes.[17]\n\nIn May 1981, Joseph Winkler was named Ideal's president, succeeding Lionel Weintraub, who remained chairman and CEO.[9]\n\nIn 1982, the company moved its headquarters from Hollis, Queens, to Harmon Meadow, New Jersey. It was sold to CBS Toys later that year for around $58 million.[3][18]\n\nIn 1984, CBS sold Ideal to Viewmaster International, which renamed itself \"View-Master Ideal\" in the process.[19]\n\nIn 1989, View-Master Ideal was bought by Tyco Toys of Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, for $43.9 million.[20] The Ideal line remained part of Tyco until Tyco's merger with Mattel, Inc., in 1997.[21][22][23][24]\n\nIdeal's United Kingdom assets were sold to Hasbro, which has since released Mouse Trap and KerPlunk under its MB Games brand. Other toys that originated with Ideal continue to be marketed and sold by other companies, including Rubik's Cube by Hasbro and Magic 8-ball by Mattel.[25]\n\n1991-present[edit]\n\nThe Ideal trademarks, and most toy molds not purchased by Hasbro or Mattel, were purchased by Jay Horowitz of American Plastic Equipment, who later transferred all rights to American Plastic Equipment's subsidiary, American Classic Toys. Mr. Horowitz licensed the trademark and toy rights to Plaza Toys, to be used on its Fiddlestix building sticks products, and eventually sold the mark and toy rights in January 2011 to Poof-Slinky.[26]\n\nIn January 2014, the Ideal brand and toy rights became part of a new company, Alex Brands, after the May 2013 acquisition of Alex Toys by Propel Equity Partners.[27]\n\nIn early 2019, Jay Horowitz of American Classic Toys entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Juna Group to represent worldwide select Ideal brands (not included in the sale to Poof-Slinky) in all categories outside of toys and playthings.[citation needed] In 2023, this license agreement was acquired from The Juna Group by CSN Press LLC, publishers of the weekly newspaper, Comic Shop News.[citation needed]\n\nProducts history[edit]\n\n1903-1915[edit]\n\nIdeal began making dolls in 1907 to complement its line of teddy bears. Their first doll was “Yellow Kid” from Richard Felton Outcault's comic strip of the same name. After that Ideal began making a line of baby and character dolls such as Naughty Marietta (from the Victor Herbert operetta), and Admiral Dot.[28] Ideal advertised their dolls as \"unbreakable,\" since they were made of composition, a material made of sawdust and glue, rather than ceramics. Ideal produced over 200 variations of dolls throughout the composition era.[2]\n\nIn 1914, Ideal had a boy doll launched named the Uneeda Kid, after a biscuit company.[29][28] It was patented on December 8, 1914.[30] The 15-inch boy doll wore a blue and white bloomer suit and held a box of Uneeda Biscuits under his arm.[31]\n\n1916-1950s[edit]\n\nOne of Ideal's most lasting products was Betsy Wetsy, introduced in 1934 and in production for more than 50 years. The doll was named after the daughter of Abraham Katz, the head of the company.[2] Ideal, via the Betsy Wetsy doll, was also one of the first doll manufacturers to produce an African American version of a popular doll.[32] In 2003, the Toy Industry Association named Betsy Wetsy to its Century of Toys List, a compilation commemorating the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the 20th century.[33]\n\nDebuting in 1934, the Shirley Temple doll was their best-selling doll.[28] Ideal followed this with licensed Disney dolls and a Judy Garland doll.[4]\n\nTwo cosmetics-based doll series were launched after World War II: Toni was introduced at the end of the 1940s, followed by the 1950s-dominating Miss Revlon series.[4]\n\n1960-1990s[edit]\n\nIdeal had a hobby division in the 1950s, but shifted from that to games in 1962. By the early 1970s, 30% of the company's sales were games such as Mouse Trap and Hands Down.[8]\n\nDoll designer Judith Albert worked for Ideal Toy Company from 1960 to 1982.[1] Master sculptor Vincent J. DeFilippo spent 27 years creating dolls for Ideal from 1963 to 1980[verification needed]. Some of the company's most popular dolls during this period were Tammy (1962–1966), Flatsy dolls (1969–1973), Crissy (1969–1974), and Tressy (1970–1972).\n\nPopular Ideal toys in the 1970s included a full line of Evel Knievel toys, Snoopy toys, and the Tuesday Taylor and Wake-up Thumbelina dolls.[34]\n\n1990s-present[edit]\n\nFor a short time, the company had a huge seller with the Magic Cube, which it imported from Hungary in 1980 and renamed Rubik's Cube.[35][36] The Rubik's Cube was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2014.[37][38]\n\nProduct lines[edit]\n\nToys and games[edit]\n\nBoard games[edit]\n\nDolls[edit]\n\nDeFilippo Dolls[edit]\n\nOther Ideal dolls[edit]"
