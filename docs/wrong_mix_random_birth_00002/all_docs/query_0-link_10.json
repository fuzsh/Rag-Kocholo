He used to teach her little steps in his backyard and that gave him the idea to bring her on the show, reprising the number that he did with her mother Judy Garland in For Me and My Gal (1942). He said he was nervous for Liza and he could tell that she was nervous. “I could feel it in her body and her hands,” he said. But he could also tell that she loved it. “You can feel when your partners in song or dance really love what they’re doing. She was just entranced and entrancing. Now I’ve loved her ever since.” According to a letter here in the archives that 13-year-old Liza sent to Gene after the performance, she felt the same about him. “You are my favorite,” she said, “and you always will be. Lots of love Liza.” It doesn’t get much better than this, does it?\n\n#genekelly #genekellylegacy\".",
