        "text": "Looking back on Judy Garland’s movies I’ve seen, I can\n\nhonestly say I haven’t seen a movie I didn’t like. Even though some pictures were\n\nbetter than others, I can’t say any of Judy’s films were “bad”. Hoping this\n\nstreak will continue, I joined the Third Judy Garland Blogathon by reviewing For\n\nMe and My Gal! This film was recommended by the Brannan sisters from Pure\n\nEntertainment Preservation Society. They not only introduced me to this film,\n\nthey introduced me to the Breen Code era! Between 1934 to 1954, the Breen Code\n\nserved as a set of guidelines for film-makers. These guidelines addressed the\n\ndos and don’ts of movie-making based on a series of morals. Within that period\n\nof time, Hollywood gave their audience films that have stood the test of time\n\nand even become “classics”. But will this statement hold true for For Me and\n\nMy Gal? Keeping reading my review to find out!\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nThe on-screen chemistry: Since I chose to review this movie\n\nfor the Third Judy Garland Blogathon, I want to discuss Judy’s performance in For\n\nMe and My Gal. However, I want to talk about her performance in relation to\n\nher on-screen chemistry with Gene Kelly. When a movie musical features a\n\nromantic relationship, the on-screen chemistry of the lead actor and actress\n\ncan sell the idea their characters truly love one another. This is what Gene\n\nand Judy achieved through their portrayals of Harry Palmer and Jo Hayden! One\n\nperfect example is presented during the musical number, “For Me and My Gal”.\n\nThrough facial expressions, the choreography, and their singing abilities, Jo\n\nand Harry realize they share the same dream, despite being complete strangers\n\nonly hours ago. This musical number emphasizes how these characters were always\n\nmeant to be together.\n\nHow World War I was incorporated: For Me and My Gal takes place in the middle of the 1900s, the time when World War I took place. The story revolves around civilian perspectives; vaudeville\n\nperformers trying to make their dreams come true. At the beginning of the\n\nmovie, newspaper headlines broadcast events related to World War I. But the\n\nnewspaper’s front page is turned away from the characters, as they are more\n\nconcerned with how their performances were reviewed by the critics. As the\n\nstory progresses, World War I starts to take center stage in their lives,\n\naffecting each character differently. This progression is steady and the\n\nchanges happen more subtly. The way World War I was incorporated into For Me\n\nand My Gal felt realistic. Though fictional musical movies require a\n\ncertain amount of disbelief to be suspended, it was refreshing for realism to\n\nbe woven into the film.\n\nA story with stakes: Movie musicals, especially those from\n\nthe Breen Code era, contain simpler stories. These stories range from looking\n\nfor another member of a talent group or characters expressing their love for\n\neach other. In For Me and My Gal, the overarching\n\nstory focuses on characters working toward their dreams. Throughout the movie,\n\nJo and Harry experience obstacles and attempt to overcome them. At one point in\n\nthe film, Harry receives an offer to perform at The Palace, a theatre in New\n\nYork every vaudeville performer aspires to go. While the offer itself sounds\n\namazing, the problem is Harry would no longer be able to perform with Jo. This\n\nis one example of For Me and My Gal containing a story with stakes. In\n\nthe case of the aforementioned conflict, there were stakes not only for Harry’s\n\ncareer, but also for his relationship with Jo.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nThe “insta-love” trope: In stories where a romantic\n\nrelationship in included, part of the story is devoted to showcasing the\n\nprogression of that relationship. If a story’s relationship moves too quickly,\n\nit may be difficult for the audience to become invested in that relationship or\n\ndetermine if the actors have on-screen chemistry. While Judy Garland and Gene\n\nKelly had good on-screen chemistry, I found their characters’ initial attraction\n\nto happen too quickly. In fact, this attraction happened so quickly, it almost\n\nfelt unbelievable. I recognize there’s only so much story to tell in an hour\n\nand forty-four minutes. However, I wish Harry and Jo’s attraction for one\n\nanother had taken its time.\n\nAn unresolved debt: Toward the beginning of For Me and My\n\nGal, Jo’s brother, Danny, pays Jo a visit after one of her shows. During\n\ntheir conversation, Jo tells Danny she will pay him back after she becomes a\n\nbig vaudeville star. But this is the only time throughout the movie where this\n\ndebt is mentioned. The debt is not revisited or resolved as the story progresses.\n\nThat part of the story ended up becoming a loose end that was left behind by\n\nthe end of the movie.\n\nA confusing conflict: For this part of my review, I will\n\nspoil For Me and My Gal. If you have not seen this movie and are\n\ninterested in watching it, skip this part of my review and continue reading where\n\nit says “My overall impression”.\n\nAfter Jo and Harry discover their love for each other, they\n\nreceive a telegram congratulating them on their upcoming performance at The\n\nPalace, a theatre in New York they have dreamed about for so long. When they\n\narrive at The Palace, Harry and Jo learn there was a misunderstanding. They\n\nreceived a gig at The Palace theatre in Newark, New Jersey. In the telegram, its\n\nsender stated The Palace was in New York. But any performer on the vaudeville\n\nscene would know there’s only one Palace theatre, the one in New York City.\n\nThat quote in the telegram references how Eve Minard, a singer Jo and Harry met\n\non a train trip, brought up the idea of more than one Palace theatre. For Me\n\nand My Gal was released during the Breen Code era. When a character makes a\n\npoor choice within a film from this time period, they either face accountability\n\nfor that choice or learn from their mistake. However, Eve is never confronted\n\nabout the telegram. This leaves me confused, wondering if Eve was intentionally\n\nruining Harry and Jo’s plans or if she was genuinely trying to help, but her\n\nmessage became lost in translation?\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nThe term, “The Golden Age of Hollywood”, gets thrown around\n\nfrom time to time in conversations about the film industry. This term’s\n\ndefinition depends on who you ask, as film itself can be subjective. In my\n\nopinion, one of Hollywood’s “golden ages” was the Breen Code era. For Me and My Gal serves as one example to prove my point. The 1942 picture sets itself apart from other musical films by\n\npresenting a story with stakes. It also incorporates World War I in a realistic\n\nway. As I’ve stated in past reviews, the strength of a musical movie lies in\n\nits musical numbers. For the most part, For Me and My Gal features\n\nmusical numbers that are pleasant to watch! This is the second Judy Garland\n\nproduction I reviewed this year I was not only recommended, but ended up liking\n\nas well. The streak of enjoyable Judy Garland movies I mentioned in this review’s\n\nintroduction is still going strong!\n\nOverall score: 7.6 out of 10\n\nHave you seen For Me and My Gal? What is your\n\nfavorite movie of Judy Garland’s? Please let me know in the comment section!\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\n18 Cinema Lane is almost five years old. In that time, I have reviewed many films; from the blockbuster to the underrated and everything in between. Sometimes, I had the opportunity to talk about “classic” films. These opportunities were formal introductions to these titles. This list highlights some of the “classic” movies I watched because of my blog. Whether it was a blogathon entry or a Blog Follower Dedication Review, I’m thankful I was able to see these films. That way, I can now have an honest opinion about them. Since I have reviewed all the films on my list, I will provide links in this article. I will also be sharing my thoughts on these films, so anything I say is not meant to be mean-spirited or negative.\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nStarting this list is the most recent “classic” I reviewed. I chose to write about The Bridge on the River Kwai for The 5th Golden Boy Blogathon, where I was the only participant to select it. This movie made me question why some movies do or don’t end up on AFI’s list of The 100 Greatest American Movies Of All Time. Until I watched The Bridge on the River Kwai, I believed these titles met one of two criteria: those that represent the time they were released and those that brought something new to the cinematic table. With the 1957 film, I still haven’t figured out why it’s on the list. I am not saying this is a bad movie. But, at best, I thought it was just fine.\n\nTake 3: The Bridge on the River Kwai Review\n\nA Star Is Born (1937)\n\nBefore participating in the Fredric March Blogathon, I didn’t have an interest in watching any version of A Star Is Born. Because this story has been remade on more than one occasion, I thought each version was going to share a recycled plot, with little variation among them. As of this list’s publication, I’ve only seen the 1937 original. However, I was surprised by how impressive the movie was! Fredric March’s performance was so strong, not just among the Breen Code era films I’ve seen, but among any movie I have seen. He worked well alongside Janet Gaynor, sharing really good banter between each other. A Star Is Born made me want to actively seek out more films from Fredric’s filmography!\n\nTake 3: A Star Is Born (1937) Review\n\nFunny Face\n\nAs Fred Astaire famously said, “Do it big, do it right, and do it with style”. When it comes to his movie, Funny Face, that’s exactly what happened. This is a pleasant looking production! I remember loving the use of color, as pops of color were placed in scenes with a primarily plain color palette. The musical numbers were also entertaining to watch, with creative ideas woven through them. Though I haven’t seen many of Audrey Hepburn’s films, Funny Face is one of her projects I like. She appeared to be enjoying whatever she was doing, whether it was dancing in the “Basal Metabolism” number or portraying Jo traveling to Paris. Then again, Audrey did famously say “I believe that happy girls are the prettiest girls”.\n\nTake 3: Funny Face Review (Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly Blogathon Part 2)\n\nAll About Eve\n\nAs the last movie I reviewed for 2019’s Clean Movie Month, All About Eve is a film I thought was just fine. A peek behind the theater world’s curtain was refreshing, providing the story with interesting perspectives. The use of voice-overs not only allowed the audience to witness Eve develop as an individual, but connect with the other characters as well. However, I found the title to be misleading, as the story was led by Margo. As I said in my review, the film would be called “Mostly About Margo” or “Sometimes About Eve” if given an honest title.\n\nTake 3: All About Eve Review (Clean Movie Month — #5)\n\nNosferatu\n\nThe same year I reviewed All About Eve, I also wrote about Nosferatu. My review of the 1922 “classic” was for 2019’s A Month Without the Code. I’m thankful for the opportunity I had to see Nosferatu, as the film was not only created under strict copyright rules, but has also been preserved over time. This film serves as a stone in cinema’s foundation, showcasing elements still found in today’s movies, such as using music to elevate the story’s tone. I don’t often talk about horror films on 18 Cinema Lane. But out of the ones I have reviewed, Nosferatu is definitely one of the better titles!\n\nTake 3: Nosferatu Review (A Month Without the Code — #1)\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\nLike I recently said in my list, ‘The Top 10 Best Movies I Saw in 2022’, there are few movies I found better than their source material. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those films! I like this adaptation because the script gets straight to the point sooner than the book did. It also places more emphasis on the trial, the part of the book I found the most interesting. The visual nature of film elevated the suspenseful moments from the original story, presenting realistic situations with an intensified level of uncertainty. This is one of those times where I would suggest skipping the book and going straight to the film.\n\nTake 3: To Kill a Mockingbird Review\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nIn my opinion, Citizen Kane is an over-hyped movie. I know that’s a controversial opinion. But when I reviewed the movie in 2019, I didn’t find it the flawless masterpiece others have made it out to be. For starters, I don’t think the film needed an hour and fifty-nine-minute run-time. I also found it difficult to connect with the characters. Despite my view on Citizen Kane, I don’t think it’s a bad movie. If anything, I thought it was decent. But like I said with The Bridge on the River Kwai, I wonder why Citizen Kane is number one on AFI’s list of The 100 Greatest American Movies Of All Time?\n\nTake 3: Citizen Kane Review (Clean Movie Month — #2)\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThis is another “classic” I feel is over-hyped. However, the over-hyped status of Lawrence of Arabia is not to the same degree as Citizen Kane, in my opinion. The 1962 film is one of the most iconic “sword and sandal” titles. But beyond this simplified distinction is a World War I story from a unique perspective. Reviewing Lawrence of Arabia for The World War One On Film Blogathon was not my first choice. I had actually planned to review a different movie, which ended up being released on DVD after the blogathon took place. This last-minute decision was a blessing in disguise, as it gave me an excuse to check out Lawrence of Arabia!\n\nTake 3: Lawrence of Arabia Review\n\nBen-Hur (1959)\n\nWhen I chose to watch this movie for a Blog Follower Dedication Review, I had no idea how much I would love it! I remember being so invested in Judah’s journey, I wasn’t too bothered by the film’s three-hour run-time. This is another iconic “sword and sandal” picture. But only referring to this film by that simplified title does it such a disservice. That’s because the movie is, in my opinion, one of the better faith-based films! I’ve heard 1959’s Ben-Hur is a remake of a film from the ’20s. Maybe that version will be covered in a future review!\n\nTake 3: Ben-Hur (1959) Review + 60 Follower Thank You\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis\n\nThe Breen Code era gave us some good musicals. Meet Me in St. Louis is no exception! A musical is only as strong as its musical numbers. In the 1944 film, there was an assortment of enjoyable songs. From Judy’s iconic rendition of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” to my favorite, “Under the Bamboo Tree”, this part of the story added to my movie viewing experience. While the film does have its flaws, it is a pleasant production. If I were introducing someone to the Breen Code era, Meet Me in St. Louis is a film I would recommend!\n\nTake 3: Meet Me in St. Louis Review + 75 Follower Thank You\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\nFor Maddy Loves Her Classic Films’ blogathon, The World War One On Film Blogathon, I had originally planned on reviewing the movie, Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero. However, because the film changed its DVD release date several times, with December 11th being the latest date, I had to come up with a different movie to review. Remembering MovieBabble’s list of the Top 10 Best World War I Movies, I visited this post to see what options were available at such short notice. I decided to pick Lawrence of Arabia because a) I’ve never seen it before and b) I’ve heard a lot of good things about the movie throughout the years. In fact, until I read MovieBabble’s aforementioned list, I had no idea that Lawrence of Arabia had anything to do with World War I. Despite the change of plans, I was looking forward to finally seeing this movie. Was it truly as good as almost everyone says it is? Let’s find out in my review for Lawrence of Arabia!\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nThe acting: The cast of Lawrence of Arabia was really good! Everyone on-screen brought a significant amount of believability to their roles. Peter O’Toole gave such a great performance, bringing the emotional depth that made his performance so memorable. Two of the stand-out performers in this movie were Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn! Both of their performances were so good, it felt like their characters were truly coming to life as the events played out on-screen. The acting overall was definitely a highlight to this film!\n\nThe scenery: The scenery in this film is great to look at! Any scene that took place in the desert was filmed very well, making that environment appear beautiful. I also liked the architecture that was featured in the film. My favorite building in Lawrence of Arabia was the British offices in Cairo because that facility looked majestic and breath-taking.\n\nSeeing World War I from a unique perspective: Whenever events from World War I or World War II are depicted in film, either characters are shown fighting on the European front or the conflicts of World War I or II are shown affecting various European countries. In Lawrence of Arabia, however, the effects of World War I are shown through the eyes of those stationed in Arabia. Like a lot of war movies or movies discussing the subject of war, there were several shared ideas in Lawrence of Arabia, such as looking out for fellow comrades, questioning the ethics of war, and individuals from various backgrounds coming together to reach a common goal. There were also ideas in Lawrence of Arabia that added uniqueness to this perspective, such as religion and the characters’ views on the two Arab tribes that were amongst Lawrence’s troop. These shared ideas and unique views of World War I make Lawrence of Arabia an interesting and compelling war movie!\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nAn interesting four minutes: During the first four minutes of this movie, the screen was blank while the film’s score played. I was so caught off-guard by this, that I thought something was wrong with my television.\n\nSome scenes feeling more drawn out than others: While watching Lawrence of Arabia, I noticed that some scenes were drawn out more than others. The scenes that were drawn out were any of them that involved the characters traveling in the desert. Because these scenes didn’t involve a lot of action or intrigue, this affected the continuity of my interest in the film.\n\nA limited amount of battles: When one thinks of a war movie, the idea of the characters fighting in at least one battle is almost always expected. Before I saw Lawrence of Arabia, I thought it would contain two smaller battles and one big, climatic battle. However, this movie contained several military confrontations and political negotiations. While these things made the film interesting, I was expecting a little more action.\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nOne three-hour movie and a film review later, I can honestly say that Lawrence of Arabia was a good movie! However, I, personally, feel that it’s not as great as some people have made it out to be. Over the years, I think it has become a bit over-hyped. But, I can definitely see why people like it as much as they claim to. This film does have its merits and has stood the “test of time” for good reason. Lawrence of Arabia is a film that is worth checking out, whether it’s your first time seeing it or if you’re re-watching it for the billionth time. Looking back on it, Lawrence of Arabia does make a good war movie. Its unique perspective and cinematic qualities set this movie apart from all the rest.\n\nOverall score: 7.7-7.8 out of 10\n\nHave you seen Lawrence of Arabia? What’s your favorite war movie? Leave your thoughts below in the comment section!\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen\n\nIf you want to check out MovieBabble’s post that I mentioned in this review, you can visit this link:\n\nhttps://moviebabblereviews.com/2018/08/22/top-10-best-world-war-i-movies/"
