        "text": "Everything revolves around New Jersey.\n\nEven the holiday season.\n\nThe Garden State plays a role in some of the best — and quite frankly, worst — that Christmas cinema has to offer.\n\nSome of these Christmas movies are dripping with Jerseyness. Other classics require more work to find the inevitable Jersey tie.\n\nHere are 25 holiday films with a Jersey connection. And if you want even more Jersey films, read the 51 greatest Jersey movies list.\n\n“Home Alone,” 1990 and “Home Alone 2,″ 1992\n\nThe McCallister home is in Illinois, the setting of so many John Hughes movies. And Catherine O’Hara and John Candy are Canadian, of course. But Joe Pesci was born in Newark, and until recently, had a home in Lavallette.\n\nAs for the sequel? The hit song from its soundtrack, “All Alone on Christmas” by Darlene Love, was written by Middletown High School grad Steven Van Zandt and featured other members of Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band.\n\n“It’s a Wonderful Life,” 1946\n\nDid you know Bedford Falls was based on tiny Califon in Hunterdon County?\n\n“It’s a Wonderful Life” was adapted from a Christmas card sent by Rutgers University graduate Philip Van Doren Stern. And its fictional setting was actually inspired by the small New Jersey town with an iron bridge that became a focal point of the movie.\n\n“Die Hard,” 1988\n\nThe debate still rages: Is “Die Hard” a Christmas movie? But this much is certain: John McClane is a Jersey guy. Bruce Willis was raised in Salem County and attended high school and college here.\n\nOh, and one of the film’s producers, Joel Silver, grew up in South Orange.\n\n“The Family Stone,” 2005\n\nDowntown Madison served as the backdrop for scenes in the comedy-drama starring Diane Keaton and Sarah Jessica Parker. Claire Danes and Dermot Mulroney even stopped at St. Vincent Martyr School to sign autographs after filming.\n\n“White Christmas,” 1954\n\nDick Stabile, the musician who portrayed the Carousel Club bandleader, was born in Newark.\n\nA distant link? Sure. But the Jersey connection to this iconic film is real.\n\n“Miracle on 34th Street,” 1947\n\nAny movie about New York City can’t escape a bit of Jersey.\n\nActor William Forrest, who played Dr. Rogers at Bellevue, was a star athlete at Princeton University.\n\n“A Christmas Story,” 1983\n\nEver heard of the TV show “Shepherd’s Pie”? If not, you’re welcome.\n\nA few years before Jean Shepherd narrated “A Christmas Story” — a film based on some of his stories — the author humorously chronicled New Jersey life for PBS New Jersey Network.\n\n“Bad Santa,” 2003\n\nNew Jersey wouldn’t have anything to do with a story about a con man dressing up as Santa to rob malls, would it? Of course it would.\n\nScreenwriter Glenn Ficarra attended St. John Vianney High School in Holmdel Township.\n\n“Meet Me in St. Louis,” 1944\n\nThe Garden State can’t claim Judy Garland or Margaret O’Brien. But Joan Carroll, who played Garland’s younger sister, Agnes Smith, was born in Elizabeth.\n\n“The Polar Express,” 2004\n\nIt’s hard to find the local connection when Tom Hanks plays six different characters.\n\nBut the beloved children’s book-turned-animated movie starring Hanks as a train conductor features music by Teaneck native Alan Silvestri, whose score was nominated for an Oscar.\n\nYou might want to check out Silvestri’s more famous work: the score to “Back to the Future.”\n\n“Lethal Weapon,” 1987\n\nSome might argue that if “Die Hard” is a Christmas movie, so is “Lethal Weapon.” And like “Die Hard,” one of its producers is South Orange-bred Joel Silver.\n\n“Elf,” 2003\n\nOK, we know this one is about a human raised as an elf who leaves the North Pole for Manhattan.\n\nBut remember how he got there? By walking through the Lincoln Tunnel. That means he had to start in Weehawken.\n\n“Scrooged,” 1988\n\nThis Reagan-era “Christmas Carol” update starring Bill Murray has a few supporting actors from Jersey.\n\nJohn Forsythe, who played the ghost of Lew Hayward, was born in Penns Grove. And Michael J. Pollard, who played homeless Herman, was raised in Garfield and Clifton.\n\n“The Preacher’s Wife,” 1996\n\nWhitney Houston. Need to say more?\n\nWell, maybe that this was filmed partly in Paterson and Newark, the pop legend’s birthplace.\n\n“Deck the Halls,” 2006\n\nThis Christmas-decorating comedy is a Jersey two-for: Its stars include Danny DeVito, an Asbury Park native, and “Sex and the City” actress Kristin Davis, a graduate of the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University.\n\n“Surviving Christmas,” 2004\n\nCritics hated this holiday flick starring Ben Affleck, who was at the height of his pop-culture pariah period. But we know the real draw is co-star Tony Soprano himself: Park Ridge’s James Gandolfini.\n\n“Gremlins,” 1984\n\nAnother is-it-a-Christmas-movie selection with a touch of the Garden State. This horror-comedy — with the saddest/scariest story about Santa known to man — was directed by Joe Dante, who grew up in Livingston.\n\n“Just Friends,” 2005\n\nSometimes you just have to unexpectedly return home to New Jersey on Christmas to fall in love with your once-unrequited crush.\n\nAt least that’s the gist of this rom-com, starring Ryan Reynolds as a formerly obese record producer who ends up at his mom’s Jersey house for the holiday and reconnects with the woman he once doted on in high school.\n\n“The Family Man,” 2000\n\nThe fantasy dramedy starring Nicolas Cage is sort of a twisted, modern take on “It’s a Wonderful Life” — set in Jersey and partially filmed in Teaneck.\n\nCage stars as a Wall Street exec who magically wakes up in a Garden State suburb on Christmas Day, getting a view of what his life might have looked like if he took a different path.\n\n“The Perfect Holiday,” 2007\n\nJerseyness abounds in this movie about an aspiring songwriter, played by Morris Chestnut, who also works as a Santa at the Jersey Gardens Mall in Elizabeth.\n\nParts of it were filmed in Hoboken, Jersey City, Clifton, Rutherford, Westfield and Bergenfield.\n\nAnd the film’s narrator? East Orange-raised Queen Latifah.\n\n“Paul Blart: Mall Cop,” 2009\n\nIs it a Christmas movie?\n\nClose enough. This film about a mall security guard-turned-action hero takes place on Black Friday inside a “New Jersey” mall decked in holiday decorations.\n\nPlans to shoot at the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne were dashed when the filmmakers couldn’t get permits. So Kevin James was filmed in Massachusetts while pretending to be in Jersey’s fictional West Orange Pavilion Mall.\n\n“A Christmas Carol,” 2004\n\nThe modern musical version of the holiday classic stars Livingston’s Jason Alexander as Jacob Marley and Parsippany’s Jane Krakowski as the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\n“All Is Bright,” 2013\n\nTwo former thieves try to go straight selling Christmas trees. One is played by Paul Giamatti. The other by Passaic-born Paul Rudd.\n\n“Candy Cane Lane,” 2023\n\nStar Eddie Murphy is one of many celebrities who have called upscale Alpine their home through the years.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.
