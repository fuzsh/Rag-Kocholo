        "text": "Judy Malloy:\n\n2016 - January, 2018 Writer's Notebook\n\nA writer's notebook is not a final paper but rather reflects the development of a work or series of works. In the informal, recursive, yet productive practice of creating notebooks online, ideas and sources are developed and slowly emerge.\n\nPrimarily this 2016-January, 2018 notebook is about the research for and creation of \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf Writing. In this work, from an interface of six simultaneously generated arrays, every time \"the whole room\" is entered, a different version of \"Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf Writing\" is created. And, as the reader moves into subject-generated arrays -- from the Cornwall landscape to bisexual lives in a repressive society -- the contingencies of Richardson and Woolf's writing practices emerge -- surprising, evocative, challenging, female.\n\nBeginning in August 2017, this notebook also concerns my new work, Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems. Since, until December 2017, work on \"the whole room\" will also continue, both works will appear in this notebook, until February 2018, when a new notebook will begin.\n\nJanuary 6, 2018\n\nThe last entry in this notebook.\n\nA few changes were made on January 7.\n\nA new notebook will begin in February, 2018\n\nThis February 5, 2016 to January 6, 2018 writer's notebook begins and ends with snows storms in New Jersey.\n\nIn the February 5, 2016 entry, I wrote these words:\n\nA week or so ago, over the course of two days, while the wind howled, and the sky was white with snow, thirty inches fell outside my window.\n\nIt was a time to read, write, and reflect on the future. A time for apple cider and apple doughnuts; a time for fondue, made with Emmentaler, Gruyere and champagne; a time for linguini with artichoke hearts and basil from the window herb garden; a time to plan the documentation of artists' early telematic projects; a time for white chocolate; a time to begin the research for \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson Writing; and a time to walk in the woods.\n\nIt was also a time to recreate the code for a classic work of electronic literature. Thus, I begin this new 2016 writer's notebook with notes on \"Recreating the 1990 GW-BASIC version of its name was Penelope\" in the 2016 Critical Studies Working Group. (CCSWG2016)\n\nTwo years later, on Friday, January 4, 2018, while the wind howled outside, and snow darkened the sky, I read my several-years-ago description of snow-storm food with pleasure. This is a frugal year, but I do have linguini, Trader Joe's artichoke hearts, and fresh basil in my kitchen.\n\nT oday, this February 5, 2016 to January 6, 2018 notebook ends where it began -- not only with snow, but also with the Critical Code Studies Working Group. Every other year, CCSWG addresses humanities and computer science interdisciplinary issues in the study, teaching, use, and significance of code. January, 2018, CCSWG2018 is, as usual, sponsored by the Humanities and Critical Code Studies Lab, (USC) and the Transcriptions Center.(UCSB) It is coordinated by Jeremy Douglass (UCSB); Mark Marino (USC); Catherine Griffiths (USC); Ali Rachel Pearl(USC); and Teddy Roland (UCSB).\n\nThis year, I had planned to work on recreating the BASIC software for The Yellow Bowl, a work that fittingly I introduced in the legendary 1992 MLA panel \"Hypertext, Hypermedia: Defining a Fictional Form\". However, because with Liz Losh and Jacqueline Wernimont, I will be co-hosting a CCSWG2018 discussion on \"Gender in Coding Cultures\", The Yellow Bowl reconstruction will not happen during CCSWG2018. Although there is a certain irony in this, a discussion of gender issues in code cultures is important. I'll plunge into the labyrinth of reconstructing The Yellow Bowl later.\n\nJanuary, 2018 is also the time to consider the coding for File Two of Arriving Simultaneously.\n\nMy original intention was to create a variation on Recollected in This Early Morning -- where, in a look and feel compatible with that of File One, recollections of people of Internet history would appear in somewhat the same way California painters appear in Recollected. But I am also revisiting the interface for when we return again. (the last canto of From Ireland with Letters). In this system, an innovative yet surprisingly seamless use of randomly generated text represents past history in column three, while present history unfolds in columns one and two. The look and feel would need to be changed, as would the structure. But I plan to also explore this option.\n\nM eanwhile, this week a few changes were made that improved the overall look and feel of\n\nFile 1: when the punch cards were placed in the punch card reader.\n\n1. Since in my recollection, this system was blue and silver, the formerly black and white icon for the IBM 1130 was changed to blue.\n\nIt would be preferable to include the peripherals that made this a room-filling system. However, combinations of computer and peripherals varied greatly in the late 1960's, and so far I have not found a useable image of the entire system.\n\n2. The icon for the power lunch at The Happy Farmer was changed from a ghostly empty table and chairs (that represented a time of my life that was gone) to a busy tavern that more clearly conveys the mood of this array.\n\n3. I created an icon for Roland's departure to Silicon Valley.\n\nWhen the kaleidoscope icon appears and is selected, the reader moves to an environment with fewer rogue punch cards. Instead, various playable iterations of the manuscript appear. The reader returns to the punch card page by selecting the icon for Julie and Diana's cross country trip. The icon for Roland's departure to Silicon Valley is the same as the Diana-Julie icon, but the color is blue; it will eventually lead to File Two of Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems.\n\nI admit to remembered sadness when this icon and text were put in place.\n\nIt is clear that Diana will soon be leaving the mountains.\n\nR egarding, the difference between Jenny's experience of tech industry culture in Uncle Roger and Diana's experience of tech industry culture in Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems, I would like to emphasize that both Ball Aerospace and Xerox PARC were important, productive, and harassment-free experiences. Working for an aerospace company at the height of the space race was an unforgettable view of space technology. Furthermore, Ball gave teams and individuals the access and power to develop needed systems on their own initiative and in this way encouraged invention and innovation. Twenty years later, at a different time of my life, Xerox PARC was the most hospitable environment I have ever experienced as regards not only my own work, but also the experience of an office in PARC's legendary Computer Science Lab (CSL) with access to an unparalleled array of research and development -- and later the opportunity to work with distinguished hypertext programmer, Cathy Marshall. It is important that young woman, who want to become software engineers, are aware that in the real world, there are welcoming environments.\n\nUncle Roger, however, was based on the years of the chip industry in Silicon Valley -- at a time when I was primarily an artist/writer and was not working as an industry professional. In this era, my situation was more as an observer than as a participant. Additionally, the culture of the chip industry and the culture of the aerospace industry were different, particularly as regards how women were employed. Given, the current climate in Silicon Valley, there is much to be said about this issue, and there are contingencies with the chip industry culture and contemporary social media industry culture. But for the moment, this is another story.\n\nThe story relevant to today's notebook entry is the emergence of histories of women and engineers/software engineers in space exploration. As the Mercury 13 woman astronauts found out in the 1960's, there were glass ceilings. Nevertheless, the work of the black women mathematicians/computer programmers at Langley -- and the work of the women mathematicians and computer programmers at JPL, including Chinese American Helen Ling and African American Janez Lawson -- was extraordinary.\n\nArriving Simultaneously draws on my own much earlier experience in working with information technology at Ball Aerospace (then BBRC) in the late 1960's. But it is a pleasure to note that 25 years later the number of women at Ball Aerospace and JPL who worked in core positions on the Deep Impact Mission (launched in 2005) is inspirational.\n\nThey included Sysems Engineering Lead Amy Walsh, a 2006 Women In Aerospace Award Winner for her work on Deep Impact (Ball); Senior Engineer, Lorna Hess-Frey, Flyby Structures & Mechanisms Lead, Deep Impact (Ball); Michelle Goldman, Project Engineer in Systems Testing, Deep Impact (Ball); and Jennifer Rocca, Launch Activity Lead, Deep Impact (JPL). Astronomer Karen J. Meech at the University of Hawaii was the Coordinator of Earth-Based Observations. Other women who worked on Deep Impact were Systems Design Engineer Sheryl Atterberg (Ball); Software Stress Tester Kavita Kaur (JPL); and Leticia Montanez, Testbed Manager, Deep Impact (JPL). Much of this history (of course also focusing on the work of the male engineers), is well documented in Todd Neff's From Jars to the Stars: How Ball came to build a comet-hunting machine. (Denver, CO: Earthview Media, 2010) Because of its detailed documentation of the development of an amazing array of systems, this book is of value to anyone interested in innovation --- including new media artists.\n\nC ontingently, I am thrilled to see that this Spring, the University of Illinois Press will be releasing New Media Futures The Rise of Women in the Digital Arts, edited by Donna Cox, Ellen Sandor, and Janine Fron; Forewords by Lisa Wainwright, Anne Balsamo, and Judy Malloy. As I noted in my foreword to this book:\n\n\"Presenting individual histories as situated in the development of the technologies themselves, New Media Futures not only provides multiple models for women interested in exploring the computer-mediated creative arts but also documents the challenges of creating digital art from the late seventies to the early nineties. Application software, for instance, was unlikely at the time when many of the artists in this book began working. Explanatory books were scarce; programs were created from scratch, often taking the form of a stack of punch cards. As Lucy Petrovic, whose work focuses on human-computer interactivity and virtual reality environments, observes in this book: 'We were writing code, step-by-step. Initially that was the only way to create art on the computer.' \"\n\nDecember 26, 2017\n\n\"The way the search results appeared line by line...\n\nThe way the titles of the reports and books\n\n-- that I continued to catalog and add to the database --\n\nappeared in the output.\"\n\nI t is always interesting to see how additions to databases change the search output. But it was particularly magical in the late 1960's when the process of creating a database was still a mystery, commercial database applications were not (to my knowledge) available at all, and databases were generally created from scratch with Fortran, punch cards, a large computer, and continuous feed paper output.\n\nAs I wrote the words that lead off this entry, something I should have realized long ago was apparent: it is not only the coding but also the process of adding new data, running the program, and adding new data that are the heart of much of my work. All of these things were influenced by my work at Ball Aerospace. Thus, in surprising ways, corporate environments have incubated electronic literature. I am thinking also of James Tenney's residency at Bell labs from 1961-1964 and his role in fostering Fluxus generative Poetry and of Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) programmer Will Crowther, who developed Adventure in Fortran on BBN's PDP-10 in the 1970's.\n\nIn addition to the joys of the holidays, the past few days have been spent reviewing the progress of Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems. As a result of playing the work over and over again, multiple small edits and the following observations and additions occurred.\n\n1. As Dorothy Abrona McCrae observes in my when the foreground and the background merged (2008),\n\nI am writing this in the 21st century.\n\nIf the time shifts are not always obvious,\n\nso it is with my memory of the events.\n\n2. I'm currently working on when the punch cards were placed in the punch card reader, the name of the first file of Arriving Simultaneously. An in progress title page for the entire work now puts this initial file in the context of the whole work.\n\n3. Due to the unpredictable action of the punch card function, it is not always easy for the reader to see multiple arrays at once. To provide this access, a kaleidoscope icon has now been added to the variables in the punch card function. Distinguished with Dorothy Richardson's words from Interim, the kaleidoscope gives access to a manuscript page that simultaneously displays visible text from four arrays; each time this page is accessed, the content will be different. Certain icons, such as the vehicle ascending a mountain pass, return the reader to the top page of when the punch cards were placed in the punch card reader.\n\nDecember 10-11, 2017\n\nA rriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems is a generative electronic manuscript. The first \"page\" in this work -- the page I am working on now -- is composed with six arrays and a few associated unconventionally-nested arrays. As I, the writer, mine my memories to convey the experience of the computerization of a Colorado aerospace technical library in the late 1960's, the reader of this work experiences the spare, compressed memories that would be expected from a narrator, who is looking at her life many years later. We don't remember sequentially. I repeat. We use the affordances of electronic literature to tell stories differently. As with any form of writing, the whole takes a while to come together.\n\nAt night running and rerunning Arriving Simultaneously on my tablet allows an understanding of the flow of a work in which increasingly, no one reader will ever see the same screen. At night, reading narratives of earlier eras when women programmers were expected and welcomed, the stories of women coding -- not only during World War II but also in the 1950's and 1960's --emerge.\n\nEarlier this fall, reading Margot Lee Shetterly Hidden Figures - The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, I was immersed in the extraordinary lives of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Christine Darden and many others.\n\nIn October, immersed in Julianne Nyhan and Andrew Flinn's Computation and the Humanities: Towards an Oral History of Digital Humanities, I explored the role of early computing in the history of the digital humanities.\n\nIn November, Nathalia Holt's Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, from Missiles to the Moon to Mars stared at me from a library shelf. Initially, turned off by the 50's hairstyles and culture, I checked out the Wonder Woman DVD instead. A week later I returned and checked out Rise of the Rocket Girls. Soon, I was deep into the work of the women mathematician/computer programers at JPL. Helen Ling, Barbara Paulson, Susan Finley, Sylvia Lundy Miller, and many others. By the time I had finished, from a media archeology point of view, I felt as if the culture of the 1950's -- and how these women emerged from that culture -- was important in the narrative -- just as the maverick culture of Boulder Colorado is important in of Todd Neff's From Jars to the Stars. And yes, Neff does describe what the men did in their spare time and even sometimes what they wore.\n\nF or Arriving Simultaneously, I could have created a woman mathematician. That was my original intention, but the details of the life of a mathematician were not in my memory. Instead, Diana is a music major, an early information retrieval programmer for a NASA contractor (at a time when information retrieval systems were not well developed and documented), a Silicon Valley-based database designer, and eventually a core figure in computer-mediated community networking.\n\nIt was at Leopold Records in Berkeley, when Community Memory was installed there in 1973, that Diana first encountered community networking. And at its core, Arriving Simultaneously is an Internet story, that celebrates in spirit all the men and women who built the non-profit communities of the Internet.\n\nHowever, with Electromagnetic Research Corporation running fictionalized in the background, the story begins in a NASA contractor's technical library in the late 1960's.\n\nAs was the norm in that era, I left Ball Brothers Research Corporation (BBRC, now Ball Aerospace) in the summer of 1970 when my then husband went to work as head of a new Fairchild division. But for years I remained awed by the grandeur of the Orbiting Solar Observatory. Thus, the time I spent as project head for computerizing the BBRC library was an experience that was important in its right. In my life, it also fueled a lifetime investigation of computer-mediated literature -- as well as years of work in artist-centered community networking.\n\nAdditionally, it engendered concerns about what artists could not undertake with the resources available. In response, in 1981 I created Technical Information, an installation in which small works of information art (such as my card catalog series) were housed in a satellite-reminiscent structure that was surrounded by over 1000 pieces the literature of science and technology, arrayed on shelves that I built on the wall that encircled the art. The inviting editor for my Leonardo paper that describes this project was Roger Malina, whose father, Frank Malina, was one of the founders of JPL.\n\nM y copy of Todd Neff's detailed and fascinating From Jars to the Stars: How Ball came to build a comet-hunting machine has arrived, and as Arriving Simultaneously progresses, I am reading this book.\n\nNovember 25, 2017\n\nO n Thanksgiving Day. it was a pleasure to talk with my family in California, and then I made some variations in the interface design of the first dynamic Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems manuscript. Later, sitting in the woods (evading the FORTRAN IV manual), I went back in time to write a little more for the \"route 128\" array. It was a beautiful winter day, and somehow I veered into working at the Harvard Coop bookstore during Christmas vacations -- an experience I like to remember. So, I gave it to Diana.\n\nFor the record, this being a notebook, a few examples of the current interface design and of the new text in the output are recorded below. The purpose of doing this is to compare the changes with what existed before. Sometimes -- this may be one of those times -- a decision to revert to the original may be made.\n\nL ater on Thanksgiving evening, I was continually generating the manuscript on my tablet -- looking for mistakes and getting a feel for how the arrays work together, when I began to feel as if Diana was talking to me -- an eerie experience that I have never before had as a writer. It would be more common to merge with the personality of the character.\n\nAs is my usual practice, and because I need to test how it runs on a tablet, the in-progress first manuscript page of Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems is now online at http://www.judymalloy.net/arriving/diana_icon_interface.html This is not the top page because the top page won't be finished until all the manuscripts it accesses are completed.\n\nTo both give the reader more details and avoid too much repetition, each array should contain about 40 variables. There are 6 arrays, each now containing about 10-20 variables, so there is much more writing to do. Reader, remember, if you visit this work in progress, that each icon randomly generates a different array, and that since I will be adding new writing as often as possible, the work will be in flux -- at least until January when I begin to work on the second Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems manuscript.\n\nThe second manuscript will take place in Silicon Valley.\n\nNovember 20, 2017\n\nW ith intense work on the writing, coding and interface design, the first of the three P2P dynamic manuscript pages that will comprise Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems is working to the point that it \"plays\" elegantly, particularly on an iPad touch platform. However, much more writing is necessary, and before it is done, I need to read various histories of satellites and to once again confront the FORTRAN IV (FORTRAN 66) manual.\n\nT he images above depict reader movement from the top page, to reader \"on-the-fly\" generation of the first manuscript of Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems, to an accessible single array-displaying window. I look forward to generating all the arrays in a continuous printout. Meanwhile, composition observations are recorded here.\n\n1. In Uncle Roger File 3 and its name was Penelope, I coded generative hypertext to create narratives where the meaning slowly built up in unpredictable ways. A part of the composition process was to continually replay the work until I was certain that the lexias worked together in whatever order the reader received them. Later, recollected on this early morning was composed with looping, interlocked lexias that slowly revealed submerged narrative information about the life of a woman artist.\n\nAlthough inspired by the recollected interface, Arriving Simultaneously is designed to reflect the life of a woman programmer. Thus, it is a dynamic manuscript, created/recreated with JavaScript in a HTML/CSS structure and read \"on-the-fly\". Visual icons give Arriving a playable feel, as well as contributing to reader control of the manuscript. However, like the bat(s) in Gregory Yob's Hunt the Wumpus, the punch card icon has the power to transport the reader in unpredictable ways.\n\n2. The generative hypertext that I used in its name was penelope and The Not Yet Named Jig was influenced by my own card catalogs, as well as by the use of multiple imagery by conceptual photographers and artists, such as Jennifer Bartlett, Sol LeWitt, and Lew Thomas. Using paragraph-sized units that stand by themselves (lexias), this method of writing created a relatively coherent narrative because each lexia was written to either stand by its self or be combined with other lexias. However, beginning with Another Party in Woodside (a prize winner in the Neukom Institute for Computational Science at Dartmouth's Turing Test in the Computational Arts) and continuing with \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\", I created strategies for composing generative literature using sentences and phrases as variables.\n\nIn my work, the goal of computer-mediated literature is not to eliminate all traces of the process. For instance, although, it can be programmed out, I retain repetition to emphasize the presence of aleatory composition. Additionally, because nonsequental sentence juxtaposition sometimes occurs in Arriving Simultaneously, I would like to point out that we do not always remember in chronological order. And, when the whole works (sometimes I rewrite if it does not work), the evidence of a random composition process is poetic and musical.\n\n3. It is generally proper to refer to aleatory computer-mediated creative work as pseudo-random. But because pseudo-random is not understandable to general readers, I have of late eliminated the \"pseudo\" from the text in this notebook. The expert on pseudo-random and the elusive \"true\" random is, of course, Donald Knuth. (see The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2, Chapter three: \"Random Numbers\").\n\n4. The image of Diana in Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems is taken from an early photograph of my Mother, Barbara Lillard Powers, 1916-2001, Editor of the Somerville Journal, Managing Editor of the Somerville Journal; the Cambridge Chronicle; and the Watertown Press, and long ago chauffeur for the French composer Nadia Boulanger.\n\nNovember 9, 2017\n\nL ast night new variables were entered in the \"early programming\" array of Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems. This morning, testing the generated results in combination with the cabin array, I am thrown back in time. It is the summer of 1968, almost exactly a year from the launch of Apollo 11.\n\nNovember 5-6, 2017\n\nT hese past four days, I have been immersed in the difficult job of integrating the interface, the preliminary program, and the preliminary writing for Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems. To begin with, I'm concentrating on Diana's early life and her meeting with Roland.\n\nWhen a new work of electronic literature moves from the early planning/writing/coding stage to initial implementation and testing, sometimes everything works as planned. Sometimes nothing works as planned. This has been an in-between experience. Some things are working well; some things need improvement.\n\n1. diana_begin.html. The initial top interface page is composed of active spaces that each lead to a different opening page; each reader choice sets the stage for a different part of the story; eventually they will intertwine. Some of the text that the top page calls will briefly appear on the top page itself. Other text will appear on separate pages. The initial top page is currently in the throes of serious design and image issues, but the idea is working.\n\n2. Generated phrases and sentences. As shown on the left-hand column of the adjacent figure, a series of files has been created. Although there are only four files indicated in this preliminary chart, it works better with five files. The fifth file concerns Diana's summer job.\n\nEach module consists of an image that keys it, phrases and sentences, and code that generates the stored text at random. So far, I am happy with how the generated text is working, but there are issues with how the modules will eventually interweave. Additionally, although, my decision to write Diana's voice as notebook entries that are not writer's voice-embellished gives a certain energy to the work, this needs to be somewhat improved.\n\nThe samples below generate 2-4 variables from each module. They are very preliminary because much more text needs to be entered (and there are mistakes). However, they are helpful in seeing what is working and what is not working. Note that each image-keyed file is a separate module. This will allow user image-generated searches that combine the files in various ways.\n\nIt is always a thrill to see a long-planned work begin to take shape!\n\n3. Images. The images in Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems are planned to be flexible, by which I mean that the texts they refer to will change. For instance, the cabin image initially combines with Diana's workplace, but it will also combine with her love affair with and eventual marriage to Roland.\n\nA chart of all the images in Arriving Simultaneously (so far) needs to be created and keyed to credits to the source of each image.\n\nAlthough I used images as icons to key text in maps; in my card catalog The Woodpile (1979); in the early web version of the Blue Notebook (Uncle Roger File 2); as well as in A Party at Silver Beach, the use of images in my work has not been predominant since the days of making maps and \"card catalog\"-based narratives. Thus, I would like to also call attention to JR Carpenter's algorithmic electronic manuscripts, created with integrated images and generative text -- as well as to Deena Larsen's combinations of images and text in Marble Springs -- as being innovative examples of the use of images in conjunction with story-bearing text in web-based narrative. In the case of Arriving Simultaneously, because the text is generated from different modules, ultimately, the images are important in situating the reader within fluctuating time-frames in the narrator's life. In order that they be meaning-laden but not didactic, many of the images are designed to fade unobtrusively into the background.\n\nOctober 29-30, 2017\n\nW riting for Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems has accumulated these past weeks in two notebooks, an old one, that I repurposed and a new blue notebook, that stands out more than is desirable in the subdued autumn colors of this unseasonably warm autumn. This needing-a-drawing-on-its-cover notebook is not intended to refer to Jenny's blue notebook in Uncle Roger. Nevertheless, there is a writer's issue here of fictionalizing pieces of one's life.\n\nAs if in warning, last week it was with dismay that I read Leonard Woolf's The Wise Virgins. There are nuances, unflattering to either of the women, but it is not Camilla, the \"Virginia\" character whom, Harry, the \"Leonard\" character, marries in this novel.\n\nThe Wise Virgins was written not long after his marriage to Virginia and published in 1914 while she was still in a precarious in-and-out-of-breakdown state. Leonard's mother said there would be a \"serious break\" between her and her son if he published it. Nevertheless, it was published. Because of her condition, Virginia writes in her diary that she didn't read The Wise Virgins until late January 1915. She observed in this diary entry that it is a \"writer's book\". Nevertheless, a few weeks later she had another breakdown. No wonder.\n\nI had a hard time sleeping after reading The Wise Virgins. There is no reason to recount the entire story in this informal notebook. Leonard never wrote another novel.\n\nAfter reading The Wise Virgins, I went to the public library, checked out The Complete Shorter Fiction of Virginia Woolf (Susan Dick, ed, Harcourt, 1985, 1989), and -- in a coffee house with pleasure -- began reading the stories that are not in the collections I already have.\n\nA nd now, with help from unexpected sources, much of Diana's background in Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems has been envisioned. Because the few decades (during and after World War II) when women were hired as computer programmers are important, I am to a certain extent borrowing from my own life. However, Diana is not me. Some of the changes that I wish to disclose are related here.\n\nElectromagnetic Research Corporation (ERC) in College Park, MD, where I worked as Technical Librarian after I left the Library of Congress, appears to no longer exist. It will not be named in Arriving Simultaneously, and additionally, it has been transported to somewhere off route 128 in the Boston area. Roland, an MIT grad student at the time, worked on the programming for this now fictional company's fictional new computer. Since Roland is also fictional, I'm pretty sure he never worked for the real ERC. A friend of Diana's father was connected with this company, and she worked there during her summer vacations. (Thanks to a similar connection, I worked for a medical library during summer vacations, but that is another story).\n\nDiana was born in 1946 which makes her a few years younger than I am. However, having skipped my adventures in Europe, she arrives in Colorado to go to work for an aerospace company in 1968, which is about when I went to work for BBRC in Boulder. The date is important because Roland, whom Diana had met at ERC during her summer job, shows up in Boulder not long after the July 1969 moonwalk -- a date still memorable in my mind, since I was working for a NASA contractor at the time. Roland is on his way to a postdoc position in Stanford's fledgling computer science department.\n\nWhile she is working in Boulder, Diana lives in the mountains, I'm not going to say precisely where, but it is somewhere in the Nederland, Ward area -- not in the more remote part of Pinecliffe, where I lived with my then husband, and it is a somewhat easier commute to Boulder than was the commute from the dirt-road-that-we-had-to-plow-ourselves in Pinecliffe. Diana is not married at this time; two years later, she will marry Roland and move to Silicon Valley. Although she is a violinist and plays in a Palo Alto-based string quartet, her music is very separate from her life as a computer programmer.\n\nIn reading the histories of woman programmers in the days before University computer science departments were prevalent, I have been deeply impressed by their dedication, by their immersion in their work, and by their role in the development of the field. Thus, just as Diana's work as a programmer is core to her life, it is also central in her voice, as expressed in Arriving Simultaneously. Clearly, her story is different than my own core dedication to computer-mediated artforms. But, in writing the details of the corporate computer science experience in various eras, I have used my own experience. Not only was programming a part of my job when I worked for BBRC beginning in 1968, but also it was a part of my residence at the Xerox PARC Computer Science Lab, beginning in 1993.\n\nT wenty years or so after their marriage, Roland's reaction, when Diana leaves her high-wage job as a programmer and goes to work for a nonprofit in the field of community networking, will eventually lead to his leaving her for a younger woman, who, as he does, works in industry. Subsequently, how Diana meets Toby, her second husband, at CFP93 is a part of the growing legend that surrounds her life. None of this, as should be obvious, is based on my life (although I did speak at CFP93); rather it is what might have happened, given the lives and personalities of the protagonists. At this point the characters have been developed to the point that they themselves seemingly take control of the narrative.\n\nAlthough her memories are primary in this work, Arriving Simultaneously begins in circa 2006, just before Diana's surprise 60th birthday party, which unbeknownst to her is being planned by Toby's son Dez (by his first wife, the former \"booth babe\", Miranda) and Diana and Roland's daughter, Phoebe. Since Diana is not enthusiastic about the growing attraction between Phoebe and Dez; since Dez is inviting his mother (who is interested in Toby again because some of his early patents have resulted in a windfall); since Phoebe has invited Roland and Erika, his commercial social media platform executive second wife; and since so far none of Diana's community networking friends have been invited, things are sure to go awry...\n\nOn other Arriving Simultaneously fronts, I have returned to working on the code and now need to begin entering variables from the writing of the past few months. The text will be entered in phrases, on the model of what I did in \"the whole room\". I had some questions as to how this would work, but although neither the writing or the coding are easy processes, what I have tested so far is working surprisingly well.\n\nMeanwhile, although I have yet to confront Leonard Woolf's The Wise Virgins in the \"Virginia and Leonard\" array of \"the whole room\", some words from two of Virginia's short stories, \"Memoirs of a Novelist\" and \"The Mark on the Wall\", as well as a few more phrases from Dorothy Richardson's The Tunnel, have been added to the writing array. Some of the new additions can be seen in the output below, generated on Friday, October 27.\n\nOctober 15, 2017\n\nBuild1 of the app version of difference that a small amount of blue has been completed. Written between 2000 and 2010, the three works that comprise this trilogy are Dorothy Abrona Mccrae, A Party at Silver Beach; and Paths of Memory and Painting. Under the hood work, an initial \"about\" file, and a consideration of interface and interface graphics remain to be done. Nevertheless, after many hours of work, difference is working!\n\nL ong form electronic literature is not written as often as it was in the heyday of Eastgate. But because reading complete books on tablets has become a part of reading culture, immersive novel-length electronic manuscripts are a desirable addition to the tablet reading experience. In Difference, the complexity of the reading experience increases slowly as the reader progress though each part, creating a readable introduction to the possibilities of e-manuscripts that take better advantage of the computer screen than do re-housed print narratives.\n\nOn August 20, in this notebook, I wrote:\n\n\"I had tackled recoding Paths of Memory and Painting partially because in preparation for creating the interface and code for Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems, I wanted to look at how I had structured Part 1 of Paths -- why it was done that way and how well it worked. What I decided was that although the many-lexia-entry portals worked well for the fractured memories in \"recollected\", the interface for \"Arriving Simultaneously\" would work better if it began with only one visible portal -- the portal for Diana (the main narrator) -- and then other portals would open and close depending on when they were 'called' in the narrative. \"\n\nAlmost two months later, a trilogy, now with the title of difference that a small amount of blue, has been both connected and recast in a more contemporary HTML5/CSS environment. It had not been my intention to go this far into recoding, but, in the process, many interesting issues arose in the struggle to make a work display on both a tablet and a large laptop screen.\n\nFor example, because it is the one part of difference that displays more effectively on a larger screen, the reader is given two choices -- tablet or larger size --- to enter recollected on this early morning (the first suite of Paths of Memory and Painting). It is also my custom to link a dominant titlepage image to the work. Would it be better to link the image to the tablet or to the larger screen version? Neither approach was satisfactory. The solution was to link the image to an \"about\" file, which will (as soon as I have written this) discuss display choices. Such adventure game-like interface designer's choices are also familiar to makers of artists books, who create innovative text and image displaying structures, where every structure/text/image choice is a decision.\n\nC ontingently, reading this past week on tablet, I have been immersed in Julianne Nyhan and Andrew Flinn's Computation and the Humanities: Towards an Oral History of Digital Humanities (Springer, 2016), which is available both as a print book and online in a downloadable version. Like the change from reading for \"the whole room\" in the woods and fields and beside brooks to notebook writing for Arriving Simultaneously (in similar places), the move from book reading for \"the whole room\" to tablet reading for Arriving was initially difficult. However, it has served to set the stage for writing and coding a work that explores the life of a woman programmer, who initially creates databases for technical documents and then becomes a \"circuit rider\" for community networking.\n\nCharacters eventually take on their own life; ultimately neither Dorothy Abrona McCrae nor Diana are me, nor are they anyone else in real life. But for deep background, I'm enjoying reading the different viewpoints, that occur in the oral history-mediated voices of the DH pioneers that comprise Computatation and the Humanities.\n\nTwo examples:\n\n1. \"I wondered about your earliest memory, in any context at all, of encountering computing or computing technology?\" Julianne Nyhan asks William Ott. It is a question she will continue to ask throughout the book. In his answer, among other things, Ott responds:\n\n\"When I started the programming course in the spring of 1966 it was relatively early times for Humanities Computing... After some days I found the exercises they did a bit annoying. Therefore, since I was working on Vergil's Aeneid, an epic poem written in dactylic hexameters, and since I had learned from Eduard Nordens Commentary on Book VI of the Aeneid (1957) how important it was to also pay attention to the 'pictorial elements' of the hexameter when interpreting the poem, I tried to design a program to automatically compile the metrical characteristics which Norden had collected in the appendix to his commentary. It worked, and it was my second experience of thinking about the application of computers to the Humanities.\" [1]\n\n2. With an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and a MA in English Literature at Texas Tech University, Mary Dee Harris had worked as an assembly language programmer at the Jet Propulsion Lab on an early unmanned space shots to the moon, when, as a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, she encountered a 200 page Dylan Thomas manuscript that was difficult to assemble.\n\n\"The second thing that came to my mind after several years of saying I wasn't going to have anything to do with computers was 'if I put this on the computer, I can get it all sorted out,'\" she tells Nyhan. \"So that turned into my dissertation, Computer Collation of Manuscript Poetry: Dylan Thomas' 'Poem on his Birthday' (Harris Fosberg 1975). [2]\n\nAmong many other interesting accounts in Computation and the Humanities: Towards an Oral History of Digital Humanities, are \"They Took a Chance\": Susan Hockey and Julianne Nyhan; \"There Had to Be a Better Way: John Nitti and Julianne Nyhan\" and my own early experiences as an artist programming technical documents at an aerospace company, \"The Influence of Algorithmic Thinking: Judy Malloy and Julianne Nyhan\".\n\nW alking to my parking space from the coffee house where I finished this book earlier this week, I reflected on Shakespeare Scholar Gabriel Egan's chapter, \"So, Into the Chopper It Went\". In his interview, Egan tells how he digitized his entire library of 3,000 books, destroying the print books themselves in the process.\n\nNyhan asks:\n\n\"And do you feel no attachment or sentimentality for the materiality of the book or the book as artistic object?\"\n\nEgan replies:\n\n\"Well I didn't have any rare books. So no, these were just functional. I have had one or two tricky cases. For example, I've got a copy of the Norton facsimile of the First Folio of Shakespeare (Hinman 1968). Its only 1968 but the copy I've got I was given by my PhD supervisor, Stanley Wells. It was the one he used when he was making the Oxford Shakespeare edition of 1986, which was a big-deal edition (he was the main Editor.... I felt a little bad chopping it up. But I thought 'I want this thing, I need it, and I want to have it with me! I want to have it everywhere I go'. So, into the chopper it went.\"[3}\n\nFor \"the whole room,\", it had seemed wrong to read Virginia Woolf and Dorothy Richardson's books on a tablet. They wrote for the book interface. But Egan is a Shakespeare and theatre scholar. Shakespeare was not writing for print, he was writing for the theatre. Admittedly, I was still uncomfortable with Egan's lurid descriptions of \"guillotining\" the spines off of books. But I found that reading DH oral histories on tablet in a coffee house was a satisfatory experience, not as pleasurable as reading Virginia Woolf's and Dorothy Richardson's books in the same coffee house, but nevertheless, productive and economical. And I like the way Computation and the Humanities is available both as a book and as free downloadable text.\n\nMeanwhile, the writing for Arriving Simultaneously continues. And material for Networked Projects in the Formative Years of the Internet is slowly accumulating. This month an interview with Tom Klinkowstein was published on content | code | process, and a thoughtful conversation about our 1990's Interactive Art Conference on Arts Wire has begun with Anna Couey via email.\n\nAnd yes, Dorothy and Virginia are still writing:\n\n_______________________\n\n1. \"The University Was Still Taking Account of universitas scientiarum: Wilhelm Ott and Julianne Nyhan, in Julianne Nyhan and Andrew Flinn, Computation and the Humanities Towards an Oral History of Digital Humanities.

With last week's words, Diana's life -- leaving college and heading west in an old car, stacks of technical documents and a FORTRAN manual on her desk at her new job, studying systems analysis in the shadow of Apollo 11, and suddenly Roland appears in a Restaurant at a company lunch -- has emerged to the point that I am looking forward to translating my writing to the (not yet completed) coded environment of Arriving Simultaneously.\n\nThe narrative of this work will unfold in randomly generated phrases, not unlike the way \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf Writing continually creates unexpected narrative dissonance and coherence. Because Arriving is all my own writing, I will have better control of the generated content. However, working on \"the whole room\" continues to provide a perfect example of experimental writing by two masters.\n\nThus, as I write and re-code other works, it is with pleasure that I also continue to add new variables to and generate screens from the writing array of \"the whole room\":\n\nAnd yes, Dorothy and Virgina are still writing:\n\nT he three works that center on the artist Dorothy Abrona McCrae\n\nDorothy Abrona Mccrae\n\nA Party at Silver Beach\n\nPaths of Memory and Painting\n\nwere created from 2000-2009.\n\nThese are the works that I am rehousing in an HTML5/CSS environment\n\nSoon, they will be also appear as a trilogy -- under the title of\n\nThe Difference that a Small Amount of Blue.\n\nFor consistency, there will probably be a new title page for each work.\n\nI am happy with how these narratives will work together.\n\nBut note that there may be some glitches while I work on this.\n\nSeptember 17, 2017\n\nL ast week, while The Roar of Destiny went into London, in a brief exhibition, hosted by the British Computer Society and curated by Dene Grigar, as an accompaniment to Beyond Grammatron, a celebration of Mark Amerika's work, I spent some time working on the London array of \"the whole room\". The London array is not generated inside \"the whole room\" interface, but if you click on:\n\n\"...the little boat crossing the river\"?\n\n(here or at the bottom of \"the whole room\"), you will arrive in Virginia Woolf and Dorothy Richardson's London.\n\nVirginia's London is punctuated with parties of friends and family; Dorothy -- despite her clear joy of living there -- punctuates London with solitary dark places. But, as they write about streets, crowds, sounds, music, remembered words, and umbrellas, their voices cohere remarkably well.\n\nAbout ten new variables were entered last week. A few appear below in five generated-screens from the London array. Reader, remember, that if you visit this array yourself, you will see something else; each array is generated anew, every time it is entered.\n\nM eanwhile, the writing for Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems continues. This week, in a cafe, on a short walk to a pond, on a short walk along a stream, I worked on Diana's voice (What does her \"voice\" sound like?). Still struggling with Diana's voice, on Thursday I went to the campus to hear Sergio Militello, Choirmaster and Principal Organist of the Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral in Florence, play the 60 or 61 variations of Ciacona.ex C by Johann Valentin Eckelt.\n\nAs I listened, I heard Diana's voice emerging in the bass-line. Steady, calm, melodic, graceful, central. All around her, the voices of her family and friends were playing in the variations.\n\nPerfectly played by Segio Militello, as a complete continuous system of base-line and variations, the variations in the Eckelt Ciacona are not like the \"windows\" of generated words that I envision for Arriving Simultaneously, where there are other dominant voices: some, such as Toby's first wife, Miranda, discordant/challenging; others, such as Diana's son, Braydon, and his African American wife, Olivianne, on harmonic, parallel tracks.\n\nHowever, in this version of Internet history, it is Diana who is telling the story, and the sound of her voice has emerged. Grazie!\n\nA t home, I read Hidden Figures - The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly. (NY: William Morrow, 2016), and I watched the film. The narratives in the book and the film are extraordinary, not only for the core work of the black women \"computers\" at Langley -- from World War II to the \"space race\" -- but also for the details of the protracted segregation which they and their families endured.\n\nSeptember 3, 2017\n\nA fter the rains, the woods and fields are an extraordinary green; beside the creeks and on the fallen logs, moss grows in varied hues. Last week, sitting in the woods, before my notebook was opened -- as if a lover had departed -- I wished that rather than writing-cold myself, I had brought Virginia Woolf or Dorothy Richardson and could inhabit the worlds of other woman writers.\n\nNot unexpectedly, to justify my desire to sit in the woods, as Diana's monologue in Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems begins, she is sitting on the deck of her home in the Sierras. While her husband, Toby, is at his Silicon Valley office (where he often spends midweek before returning to the mountains to spend a long weekend with Diana), in this secluded place, her thoughts will emerge on the screen, accompanied in separate opening and closing windows by the lives and work of her friends, family and colleagues -- as if they are the shadows in Shadow Castle (a childhood-read book).\n\nAnd so, beside a canal where canoes drift by, or beside a creek, across from a surreal green meadow and dark trees, or as far as crutches can take me through a massive \"boulder field\", I open my notebook and soon Diana and I are in a small cluttered library about 50 years ago at a company where the D layer of the atmosphere is simulated in a room-dominating bright-blue vacuum chamber. It is a summer job.\n\nMy pen moves rapidly; sometimes I can't read my own writing; this does not matter since this exploratory writing will eventually be completely rewritten.\n\nWhen I first saw Michael Joyce's afternoon, I thought it flowed more smoothly than Uncle Roger. In my work, I composed each unit of text as standing by itself and also capable of being combined with any other lexia. When I looked at afternoon, I questioned my approach, but this quality of unpredictably generated lexias is partially what distinguishes my writing, so I kept to my vision while at the same time I admired how Michael wrote.\n\nEpisodes are seldom written in classic sequential order; I write to a lexia and then move to another: from Diana sitting in a tent in the Colorado Rockies, reading a 20th century ad for a job in an aerospace company in Boulder, to Toby in his 21st century office, looking at an engineering drawing for an unusual fountain. Sequential in my work is the order in which I wrote the lexias.\n\nS ince in Arriving Simultaneously, the output will be composed with combinatory generation, I cannot control how the words I am writing will be displayed as well as I did in recollected; however, to a certain extent, code will shepherd the process. To arrive at phrases that combine in various ways, I need to begin with what might be remembered. The process follows the card catalogs I created beginning the 1970's, where the whole had collective meaning, but each unit had meaning by itself. The process is clear in File 3 of Uncle Roger. Memories occur one after another, but are seldom sequential in a traditional fiction sense.\n\nO n the first day of September, in my notebook Diana is remembering the second time she met Toby. The place is CFP93, the memorable Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy. Here, still available on the World Wide Web Consortium's web site, is the beginning of an email that I received in 1993.\n\nGiven the date of this conference -- the watershed year of 1993, just before the web took off more publicly in 1994 -- this was an important stage-setting gathering. Topics were:\n\nElectronic Democracy\n\nElectronic Voting\n\nPortrait Of The Artist On The Net\n\nDigital Telephony And Cryptography\n\nHealth Records And Confidentiality\n\nThe Many Faces Of Privacy\n\nThe Digital Individual\n\nGender Issues In Computing And Telecommunications\n\nThe Hand That Wields The Gavel\n\nThe Power, Politics And Promise Of Internetworking,\n\nInternational Data Flow\n\nSpeakers and/or people in the audience (this line was not always clear) included Anita Borg; Vint Cerf; Richard Civille, Center for Civic Networking; Anna Couey; Dorothy Denning; Mike Godwin, EFF; Mitch Kapor; Brenda Laurel; Judy Malloy; Randy Ross, (Ponca Tribe of Nebraska and Otoe Missouria) Vice-President, American Indian Telecommunications; and Bruce Sterling, who had just returned from Russia and gave me a Russian coin. I gave a talk on Portrait of the Artist on the Net\n\nAugust 20, 2017\n\nL ast week began with reading Virginia Woolf's The Common Reader on a beautiful Sunday morning on a trail where I had never before been. I chose her chapter on \"Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights\".\n\nBy Friday, August 18, passages from Virginia Woolf's review of the Bronte's and from Dorothy Richardson's reading-Ibsen-episode in Interim had been entered in the reading array of \"the whole room\". The recoding of \"recollected on this early morning\" (Part 1 of Paths of Memory and Painting) was almost finished. I had drafted an interface for the beginning of my new work, Arriving Simultaneously, and built on the code that I wrote for \"the whole room\" to create very preliminary coding for Arriving Simultaneously. On Thursday, in a coffee house I finished enough text to test the interface and preliminary code. By Friday, a very preliminary build was working! I was also working on an update for the content | code | process The Electronic Manuscript pages; rereading documentation of Tom Klinkowstein's early telematic work; and preparing questions for our interview that will begin soon. Whew!\n\nI had tackled recoding Paths of Memory and Painting partially because in preparation for creating the interface and code for Arriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-Flung Systems, I wanted to look at how I had structured Part 1 of Paths -- why it was done that way and how well it worked. What I decided was that although the many-lexia-entry portals worked well for the fractured memories in \"recollected\", the interface for \"Arriving Simultaneously\" would work better if it began with only one visible portal -- the portal for Diana (the main narrator) -- and then other portals would open and close depending on when they were \"called\" in the narrative.\n\nA rriving Simultaneously on Multiple Far-flung Systems is an electronic manuscript, keyed by a randomly-generated stream of consciousness monologue by Diana, who abandoned a lucrative career as an aerospace company programmer and set out on a journey to bring community networking to poverty-line rural and urban communities.\n\nAs the work begins, an invitation sets off a chain of recollections of her life and the Internet family dynasty she heads with her hacker/inventor husband, Toby. Portals to extended family lives are keyed by their mention in her thoughts and appear on the screen, whenever the reader calls them from Diana's recollections.\n\nInternet culture is observed and debated as issues -- such as identity, gender, diversity, privacy, Internet history, social media dominance, profit vs non-profit -- arise in clashes between family members. And, in the process, a story informed by my own memories proceeds with cameo appearances by the people of Internet history.\n\nOutput from the \"Arriving\" code is not ready to enter in this notebook. Although, unlike \"the whole room\", a reading process is not central for Arriving, research will be needed in several aspects of the work. For instance, I have experience in working in a programming capacity in the aerospace industry. That, I can write, but I am wondering about the general picture for woman programmers who were hired at a time before this became the territory for male computer scientist PhD's. What happened to the women in this transition time? I look forward to reading Margot Lee Shetterly's Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Who Helped Win the Space Race, and I'm planning to start by re-visiting Julianne Nyhan and Andrew Flinn's Computation and the Humanities - Towards an Oral History of Digital Humanities, which includes quite a few interviews with women, including an interview with me and an interview with Mary Dee Harris, who began working at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena before computer science was widely taught in universities. Also of interest is Donna Cox, Ellen Sandor, and Janice Fron's forthcoming book for the University of Illinois Press, Women in New Media Arts: Perspectives on Innovative Collaboration, for which I wrote the Foreword, and which includes chapters by Donna Cox, who is Director of the University of Illinois' Advanced Visualization Laboratory at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications; Carolina Cruz-Neira, who played significant role in the development of the virtual immersive environment that would evolve into the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment; and on Ping Fu and Colleen Bushell's work on graphical interface design for the Mosaic web browser.\n\nM eanwhile, here are three output screens from the reading array of \"the whole room\". Intermittently in the output, Charlotte Bronte never allows Virginia Woolf to forget her; Dorothy Richardson is with Ibsen in the mountains of Norway.\n\nRepresenting the role of reading in the work of Virginia Woolf and Dorothy Richardson. as well as in the creation of \"the whole room\", the reading array is located outside of \"the whole room\". Other than by the direct link just given, it can only be accessed from the notes. From within the reading array, click on\n\n\"...taking up the first handy vol and opening at random...\"\n\nto generate new texts.\n\nObserve how -- sometimes appearing, sometimes not appearing --\n\nthe Ibsen and Bronte texts impact the whole.\n\nIt is my intention to continue work on \"the whole room\" until December. Access to the books I need is curtailed by various factors; December is a good time to review the interface and to clean up/standardize the code; I would anticipate some interface and code changes at that time.\n\nThe beginning thinking for \"the whole room\" is documented in the September 20-23 entry of my 2015 writer's notebook; creating this work has been an immersive process, but I am reluctant to emerge from the combined works of two brilliant women writers.\n\nAugust 5, 2017\n\nT hanks to a bookseller in a neighboring state, an immediately- treasured copy of Virginia Woolf's The Common Reader arrived when I was in the midst of a cyberpoet's re-occurring task of updating the software and/or markup languages that control my work. Last week (and continuing), the task was/is updating Paths of Memory and Painting (2008-2010) from an earlier HTML environment to a HTML5/CSS environment\n\nPaths of Memory and Painting is an electronic manuscript, in which markup languages are used algorithmically as well as for design purposes. Thus, updating to HTML5/CSS is not a simple task. Nevertheless, I am pleased with how the work is progressing, and the struggle is worthwhile -- like washing windows to better see the view.\n\nIn the color box interface for \"recollected on this early morning\", part I of Paths, the reader is eventually confronted with a screen of fractured recollections. An artist, Dorothy Abrona McCrae, returns many years later to a place in the Berkeley Hills where she remembers sitting and painting in the Spring of 1944. Her husband, Luke, (they were young and newly married), was killed in the battle of Tarawa in November of 1943. California was the last place she saw him.\n\nIn such cases, one woman might go home to her family; another might stay, as Dorothy did, in the last place she saw her husband -- taking refuge in painting in the California hills; immersed in local wartime culture; repressing death in battle, imagining a soldier's return that will never occur, becoming Californian. And, as she locates herself in a study of California art history, California artists appear as continuo in her fractured memories.\n\nThe hidden polysequential paths that underlie certain works of hypertext, appear in \"recollected on this early morning\" in an array of immediately visible entryway texts to variously shuffled stacks of semi-polysequential lexias. Entry1 opens the painting stack at \"Early Twentieth Century\"; entry2 opens the painting stack at \"Walking up the trail\". Entry3 opens the music stack at \"I think there is more to the story\"; entry4 opens the painting stack at \"White-capped mountains in the distance\"; entry5 opens the music stack at \"My room in Mabel's parents' home\"; entry6 opens the music stack at \"Wasn't asked to go with the troops\". Entry 7 opens the \"blondel\" stack at \"Armed only with remembered song\"; and entry8 opens the blondel stack at \"Apple trees flowering\". All the stack entryways continually juxtapose text in ways that are related to both each other and the whole; the whole was composed with this in mind.\n\nLexias advance filmically, generally timed to change every 60 seconds, but the entire text in each lexia is also a link that leads to the next lexia in the stack, so that readers themselves can control not only where to read but also the movement of the lexias.\n\nThe updating of the markup language in the interface and in each lexia is proceeding slowly, but it should be finished by the end of August. The changes are not always visible to the reader.\n\n\"We are sharply cut off from our predecessors. A shift in the scale -- the war, the sudden slip of masses held in position for ages -- has shaken the fabric from top to bottom, alienated us from the past and made us to perhaps too vividly conscious of the present. Every day we find ourselves doing, saying, or thinking things that would have been impossible to our fathers...New books lure us to read them partly in the hope that they will reflect this re-arrangement of our attitude -- those scenes, thoughts, and apparently fortuitous groupings of incongruous things which impinge upon us with so keen a sense of novelty--and, as literature does, give it back into our keeping, whole and comprehended.\" - Virginia Woolf, The Common Reader [1]\n\nAlthough \"whole and comprehended\" is not always our goal, as I did in \"recollected on this early morning\", we often struggle in electronic literature towards an approach to meaning through \"re-arrangement\".\n\nC ontingently, a week or so ago, while I sat in the deep woods, slowly -- very slowly, looking at Donald Knuth's history of combinatorial practice, I noted that in a figure taken from Athanasius Kircher's Ars Magna Sciendi sive Combinatoria (1669, in which Kircher discusses the work of Raymond Lull), Knuth added a quote from \"The Ars Magna of Ramon Llull\" section of Martin Gardner's Logic Machines and Diagrams (1958), as follows:\n\n\"When ideas are combined in all possible ways, the new combinations start the mind thinking along novel channels and one is led to discover fresh truths and arguments...\" [2]\n\n_______________________\n\n1.

Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2006. p.59\n\nJuly 23-24, 2017\n\nA week of very hot days. In a mid-summer transition time, when I'm plotting a new work (for which the title changes every week; this week it is \"instantly reproduced on multiple far flung systems\"), as the work for \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\" begins to move into the background of my life, I am seeking again to define this not-easily-categorized work.\n\nTo begin with, \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\" is a generative electronic manuscript, which explores the contingent writing practices of Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf. The making of the eight arrays of this continuously randomly generated manuscript was informed by my early information art practice [1] and by John Cage's computerized version of The First Meeting of the Satie Society. As explained here in three notes (2,3,4), \"the whole room\" was created with the idea of loosely adapting \"Monte Carlo\" simulation to a humanities context. It was authored with a variation of my award-winning \"Another Party in Woodside\" code.\n\n\"...instead of being a book it seemed as if what I read was laid upon the landscape not printed, bound, or sewn up, but somehow the product of trees and fields and the hot summer sky...\" - Virginia Woolf, Essays\n\nBut on a human and personal level, the texts that comprise the variables in this work were not chosen by computer searching. Instead, many of the phrases and sentences were chosen by walking in the countryside and, at intervals, stopping to read. This was important because -- as indicated by this array from \"the whole room\" -- the lives and writing practice of Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf continually reflected the seasons and surroundings of the places where they lived and walked.\n\nT here have been times -- the late 18th century, for instance -- when reading outdoors was a part of the culture, Andrew Piper observes in Book was There: Reading in Electronic Times. In \"Among the trees\" (Chapter Six), which I read in a coffee house last week, he writes:\n\n\"Reading in the woods is just one example of the way reading is deeply shaped by where we read. Whether on trains, planes, buses, in bed, at a carrel, by a bookshelf, or under a tree, we will read just about anywhere. But as Gertrude Stein understood in those words, 'book was there,' it matters deeply where one reads. Reading and place conjoin to form a powerful mix of meaning.\" [5]\n\n\"And thus it is that although the book yields its treasure not directly in a single eyeful, but extendedly in the course of a prolonged collaboration between reader and writer, it remains humanity's intimate: the domestic pet among the arts. It is mobile and companionable, allowing itself to be carried in the pocket to the ends of the earth.\" - Dorothy Richardson, John Austen and the Inseparables\n\nThe book as object was also important in the lives of both Virginia Woolf and Dorothy Richardson. In addition to the central role of reading and writing in her life, Virginia Woolf set type and bound books for Hogarth Press. Her sister, Vanessa Bell, designed many of the covers. In addition to the central role of reading and writing in her life, Dorothy Richardson's husband, Alan Odle, was a book illustrator, and in 1930, Dorothy authored John Austen and the Inseparables , a monograph about their friend, book illustrator, John Austen:\n\nFor me, outdoor reading began when I was a child, who packed books, notebooks, and paints and paper and bicycled around the countryside, stopping when I felt like it to read or draw or write.\n\nits name was Penelope was primarily written on small hidden beaches, along the East Bay shore. Much of The Yellow Bowl was written first on small beaches at Point Pinole in Northern California -- and then beside the pond in the woods behind my mother's house in New Hampshire, as well as beside a hidden crystal clear lake in the woods a few miles away. At times, I can hear the waves lapping on the shore when I read Penelope; when Clara and Helen finally meet in The Yellow Bowl, it is at a place that I discovered on a writing walk in New Hampshire.\n\nAnd some of The Roar of Destiny was written in the California Gold Country.\n\nThis week -- planning my new work as I walked in the early morning heat; sitting in a chair beside a perfect pond; rereading Virginia Woolf's Between the Acts; onward in Between the Acts in the deep woods -- I continued to remember past places of walking, writing and reading. And surprisingly, at home, my files produced long forgotten evidence of such activities in my arts writer's practice.\n\n_______________________\n\n1.

There are various definitions of Monte Carlo simulations, but briefly, they are a group of computational algorithms that (generally in the sciences, particularly in particle physics) use repeated random sampling to explore and clarify problems. Clearly my usage is not precise, but looking at this from a humanities point of view, and from the point of view of \"the whole room\", we do not know what, if any, was the relationship between the writing practice of Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf. Would repeated (in this case, pseudo-)random combinations of their ideas from and about their writing contribute to an understanding of the relationship between these two extraordinary women? At this point the answer is clearly: yes.\n\n3. Peter Dizikes, \"Explained: Monte Carlo simulations: Mathematical technique lets scientists make estimates in a probabilistic world\", MIT News Office, May 17, 2010\n\n4. Clarissa Ai Ling Lee's contribution to the Critical Code Studies Working Group 2012 (CCSWG12), was Pythia (Ver 8 and Ver 6, Programming languages for various versions: FORTRAN, C++), a classic \"Monte Carlo\" simulation tool with literate documentation.\n\nAlthough I knew of Monte Carlo simulations from years of working with technical information, I was not very familiar with how they worked until Clarissa Lee set this out in CCSWG12. In 2014, when for \"The Not Yet Named Jig\" (canto 7 of From Ireland with Letters), I needed to show readers what the Massachusetts town of Malden was like in the 17th century, I remembered Pythia and thought that I could create a generative hypertext in which each lexia was based on known or fictionized-from-known information, and then -- if the work was run repeatedly -- from multiple (pseudo-)randomly produced combinations, a picture of Malden in the 17th century would emerge. Not surprisingly, but nevertheless amazingly, it did.\n\n5. Andrew Piper, Book was There: Reading in Electronic Times. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2012. p 112.\n\nJuly 9, 2017\n\nLast week was sometimes summer days; early morning walks, reading in the woods, and sometimes wild rain storms.\n\nI n June, when I began to read Between the Acts, Virginia Woolf's last work of fiction before she died in 1941, it seemed important to, at the same time, read her diary from that era. Now, as I write this notebook entry, in Woolf's diary, it is 1940, and into her diary has crept the blackout, the Battle of Britain, and the Blitz.\n\nA result of writing variables that concern WWII into the code for \"the whole room\" has been cogent examples of how one phrase, when it appears in the output, can change the meaning of the whole. Three texts from the early days of World WarII have been entered in different arrays of \"the whole room. Not surprisingly, when they are encountered, which is not very often -- and even if they are early observations (from the early days of the blackout as in the output below)-- the meaning of the output is altered.\n\nFrom the weather array\n\nFrom the London array\n\nT he WWII texts entered in the past few days are as follows:\n\nTwo into the last set of the London array (the last set now includes 26 variables but it is not the only set called in the London array output); the last set is called once, every time the London array is run.\n\nOne into the \"summer\" set of the seasons array (which now includes 20 variables, but it is not the only set called in the output of the seasons array). The summer set is called three times, every time the seasons array is run.\n\nThis brings up the question: will I want to precisely control the probably of certain events occurring in the output of my new work (very tentatively called Four Crystal Goblets Unexpectedly at Midnight)? To a certain extent, this may be desirable in the Internet-history centered Four Crystal Goblets. But it is only sometimes appropriate in the reading, writing and memory-centered arrays of \"the whole room\".\n\nIn VSW's words from her diary:\n\n\"Also I shall do away with exact place and time. Anything may be out of the window -- a ship -- a desert -- London.\"\n\nAnd speaking presciently for generative literature as a whole, in Interim (1919), Dorothy Richardson writes:\n\n\"Do you remember looking at the kaleidoscope? I used to cry about it sometimes at night; thinking of the patterns I had not seen. I thought there was a new pattern every time you shook it, for ever.\"\n\nJune 24, 2017\n\nT he past weeks began with a harried trip to the library in order to identify what needs to be read in the Richardson and Woolf sections and -- before my access expired -- to begin scanning what I could. It did not take long to realize that this was not in keeping with the spirit of the project.\n\nBecause \"the whole room\" is a poet/coder/ reader's exploration of two experimental writers, whose reading practice was central in their lives and work, the act of reading the separate works of Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf is important in my vision for \"the whole room\". But feeding page after page into a scanner or sitting on the library floor, taking books down from the shelves in a rushed exploration of what I have not read, is not in keeping with my vision for \"\"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf Writing.\n\nInstead, with many thanks and much respect for the purveyors of historic used books, I will continue with what I can find on a limited book budget. Two treasures arrived since my last notebook entry: John Cowper Powys, Dorothy M. Richardson, London: Joiner and Steele, 1931, and Virginia Woolf, Between the Acts, NY: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1941.\n\nWoolf's Between the Acts is a many-readings in meadows and beside brooks book; there is no need to hurry this escapist's pleasure. Meanwhile, in his monograph, Powys writes eloquently of the \"atmosphere\" which pervades Pilgrimage:\n\n\"Perhaps no writer has ever devoted so much attention to the 'atmospheric' aspects of her backgrounds. The way the morning light falls upon furniture and bric-a-brac in rooms; the way the evening light falls from passage-windows upon staircases and woodwork; the way shadows fall and slide and drift and lift and sink upon roadways and pavements; the way lamps and fires and candlelight affect the psychic temper of a room; the way the greyness of a colourless sky impregnates the simplest things in a room, the very tea-cups on the table, the very wash-basin on an attic chest-of-drawers; the way the mistiness of an autumn afternoon glides through the cracks and crannies of the most shuttered and cluttered boarding-house...\" (pp 12-13)\n\nHis primary focus, however, is on Miriam as an extraordinary heroine. Gilt-boxed within a male viewpoint and male desire, in this 48-page monograph, Richardson's \"Miriam\" is seen through the eyes of a well-known male writer of the era (the author of Wolf Solent, published in 1929). Yet surprisingly, Powys slowly builds a credible case for the importance of Miriam -- particularly when read in our identity and avatar-focused era.\n\n\"The heroine of Miss Richardson's great work,\" he observes, \"has an identity so real that it is only comparable to the identity in ourselves of which we alone are aware.\" (p. 14)\n\nMiriam is not the avatar (or agent in the early interactive art/AI sense) everyone would select and perhaps that is at times the difficulty. One doesn't, for instance, see Miriam in the screen of avatar choices presented by Second Life. But Powys' interpretation of Miriam as a female equivalent of \"the male quest for the essence of human experience\" (p.6) is potent, and over and over he presents his case differently:\n\n\"In reading Pilgrimage, we are unconsciously on the look-out for those particular renderings of the Good, the True and the Beautiful which have become an inheritance of our very blood and bones. We have to learn the art of taking these with a difference. To a large extent we must overcome this exigency that goes so deep, and is so intricately entangled with the conventional feelings of ten thousand years. We must cease to look for 'charm and cleverness,' and learn to look for something rich and strange, for something that has always been there and yet has never been given utterance.\" (p. 9)\n\nM ost of the arrays that comprise \"the whole room\" are now where I would like them to be: working while at the same time they are open to new input. This continues to be an interesting and fruitful process. But, the struggle this week was with the writing array. There are several reasons why the writing array has been more difficult. One is that because their ideas were densely expressed, in juxtaposition they appear as waring passages, even though they are at times expressing contingent ideas in different contexts (in Virginia's intimate diary, as opposed to interwoven with the fictionalized early life of a writer in Pilgrimage, for instance).\n\nAlthough occurring and reoccurring discordant ideas are important to this array, in studying the output, it became apparent that I had not sustained reader interest by grounding Richardson and Woolf's theoretical thinking with narrative content from their lives, nor had I included enough implied suggestions of how they incorporated their ideas in their actual writing.\n\nAnd so, with the addition of about 14 new variables and a shortened number of variables chosen to produce generated output (it was a total of 8; it is now a total of 6), the writing array is improved. However, this struggle is not over.\n\nJune 11, 2017\n\nA copy of Dorothy Richardson, Journey to Paradise: Short Stories and Autobiographical Sketches, edited by Trudi Tate (London Virago, 1989), has been received!\n\nIt was the third week in March, when I first began reading this book in the Firestone Library. At that time, I desired to have my own copy of this 140 page out-of-print book, but I could not find a single copy under $60.00, and so (I have access only privileges), I began a library visit tradition. After reading for the resources page for Contemporary Social Media Narrative, I would go to the stacks, where this small book resided -- always afraid it would no longer be there -- and read one or two stories. As an end to my Rutgers faculty access loomed, worried that I would not be able to reread these stories, I rechecked and found a copy for $2,00. It is now in my possession! Thank you all Amazon used booksellers who have sent affordable treasures during the course of my reading for \"the whole room.\"\n\nI began reading Journey to Paradise about the time when in the rare books room, I was reading Richardson's John Austen and the Inseparables (London: William Jackson Books, 1930). In this notebook, I quoted her words about the book as an object: \"...mobile and companionable, allowing itself to be carried in the pocket to the ends of the earth.\" Yes. And the small treasured copy of Journey to Paradise is a pleasure to take into the woods and meadows and beside the brooks of the Princeton area.\n\nW orking this week on the writing array of \"the whole room\", I concentrated on adding a few more passages from the Journey to Paradise stories. From \"Excursion\", a passage -- in which she suggests that the experience of life can be composed like an artist making a picture rather than a chronological narrative -- was added to the writing array. In the output below, this passage concludes the text, while far above it are Virginia's words from \"Modern Fiction\", which begin: \"Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged...\"\n\nThen, working from \"Data for a Spanish Publisher\", which appears in the last section of Journey to Paradise, I took this powerful line from the place on page 139 where Richardson writes about her departure from the expected constraints of the print novel:\n\n\"Assembling their characters, the novelists developed situations, devised events, climax and conclusion. I could not accept their finalities.\n\nand added it to the writing array that is part of \"the whole room\", where, in the output below, it concludes the text.\n\nNext, a passage from Virginia Woolf's \"Modern Fiction\" in The Common Reader -- remembered for some time, but not yet entered -- was placed in the writing array (\"...as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall, let us trace the pattern...\").\n\nT he past two weeks were also devoted to looking at the work as a whole. I began with creating a formal bibliography. Organized by date of first publication, which allows readers to see how Woolf's and Richardson's works coincided in publication, the bibliography includes most of the sources I've used so far and will be updated as I continue to read.\n\nAlthough I will be beginning a new work in midsummer, the work on \"the while room\" will continue. It is always a pleasure to see how this work evolves with each new addition.\n\nMeanwhile, the notes page has been expanded, and the connections between the various pages have been improved.\n\nMay 28-30, 2017\n\n\"Surely what fiction, at the its best, can do,\n\nis to arrange data, truths\n\nin their real relationship\n\nby a process of selection.\n\nLike an artist making a picture.\" - Dorothy Richardson\n\nW hen I began thinking about creating \"the whole room\", a few years ago, it was in search of how Dorothy Richardson developed her writing practice and, in the process, to pay a debt I owed her because of the reoccurring influence of her work and words on my electronic literature writing practice: the collaborative reader, inconclusive scenes and endings, and the stringing together of evocative scenes, an approach that in my work informed the lexia -- as it developed from my early \"card catalog\" works.\n\nWhile reading Dorothy's letters -- encountering many gaps, many unknowns about her life -- I considered how much more Virginia Woolf had written about her life and how their writing lives unfolded in parallel time periods, beginning with the 1915 publication of their first novels, Dorothy's Pointed Roofs and Virginia's The Voyage Out. The publisher for both of these works was Duckworth, founded by Virginia's half-brother, Gerald Duckworth.\n\nAt the time that I made the decision to change \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson Writing to \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf Writing, I thought the combinational generative output would be dominated by differences between Virginia Woolf and Dorothy Richardson.\n\nBut, beginning with cornwall.html, their voices merged -- almost as if they were sisters -- to the point that sometimes even I have to consult the marginalia-key to know who is talking. In addition to \"cornwall\", the arrays where their voices often form a harmonious duet/dialogue, are writing.html, orlando.html, and the array that focuses on the way changing seasons and variable weather pervaded their lives and work, seasons.html.\n\nDifferences emerge more strongly when they are separately dialoguing with their partners, (Virginia_Leonard.html and Dorothy_Alan.html ) and in london.html where the separate circles they traversed in their different social situations is more apparent. But even here -- although, it does not appear that they ever met -- the output seems like a dialogue between two women, who know each other through their writing and are responding with the details of how they live in and interact with the city. In the example below, following the title phrases (Virginia, Dorothy), it is Virginia, Dorothy, Virginia, Virginia, Dorothy, Dorothy (these two phrases concern her parting with HG Wells), Virginia.\n\nIt has been extraordinary adventure!\n\nL ast week I spent much time making very small changes in the opening page and \"the whole room interface page\". For the later, I considered a suggested less-conceptual interface -- images in a room that led to each array, for instance. But in the end, although I am working on a new version of the notes that will include a concise/clickable map to the arrays, I kept \"the whole room\" scroll interface because the idea of the interface as a generative scroll -- although in print-terms not as workable as it was in the days of ubiquitous continuous feed paper -- was at the heart of \"the whole room\". And, partially because of its roots in poetic information art, for this work I wished to retain the conceptual word-intensive scroll look and feel.\n\nHowever, an image-suffused interface would be perfect for the work that I plan to begin later this year. It will use a similar authoring system, but I myself will write the variables for the fictional characters in this generative fiction about a dynasty of feuding Internet networking generations -- that begins with community networking.\n\nA nd then, with the passage in Dorothy's Clear Horizon where Amabel goes to Holloway Prison for marching for the right of women to vote, Amabel was added to \"the whole room\". Into the Orlando array, I put only the beginning:\n\n\"Down, down, down the long staircase, with Amabel, better known and more beloved than any one on earth...\"\n\nIn the London array, I used the entire passage:\n\n\"Down, down, down the long staircase, with Amabel, better known and more beloved than any one on earth, a stranger and hostile, a young girl in a cloak, going, breakfastless and sick with excitement, to pay for effectively stating the desire and the right of women to help in the world's housekeeping.\"\n\nO n Saturday morning I packed up The Waves and went in search of a waterfall I had never seen. It was a rough hike on crutches; but there was a pleasant surprise at the place of the late-Spring-diminished waterfall. And, in one of the most peaceful mornings of this lovely Princeton-area spring, I sat and reread part four of The Waves, where there is a farewell dinner for Percival in a London restaurant. Among the passages I chose to add to the London array were:\n\n\"'glittering, many-pointed and many-domed London lies before me under mist.'\"\n\n\"'Now the cab comes; now Percival goes...How signal to all time to come that we, who stand in the street, in the lamplight, loved Percival?'\"\n\nMay 15, 2017\n\nThe reading of Virginia Woolf's The Years, which I had never read before, took place in a week of lush spring flowers, rain, and the pleasure of presenting from afar at Other Codes/Cóid Eile at the National University of Ireland, Galway.\n\nI finished The Years on Mother's Day, sitting on the trail because the grass was wet, and then retreating inside. This afternoon, into the London array, I entered four phrases from The Years.\n\nAfterwards, when I generated the London array, Virginia dominated the output -- dressing over and over for Clive's party, listening to an interrupted pigeon lullaby -- until in the last generated screen, Dorothy issued an invitation to 32 Queens Terrace, and once again, fictionized HG Wells, put on his clothes and called for a Hansom.\n\nI did not put the London array into the central interface page of \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf Writing; \"The Whole Room\" seemed complete without it. Instead, the London array is linked near the end of \"The Whole Room\". To access the London array, page down and click on: \"...the little boat crossing the river\"?\n\nApril 29, 2017\n\noutput changed April 30, 2017\n\nUnderlying this week's enjoyable work -- on Networked Projects in the Formative Years of the Internet; on the reading for a resource to accompany the contemporary social media panel; and on \"Conveying Diaspora in a Polyphonic Electronic Manuscript\", my talk for Other Codes at NUI Galway -- was the poet/coder's pleasure of plunging into the London array for the whole room.\n\nThis week, the variables for the London array were primarily taken from Dorothy's Letters, Virginia's diary, pt 3, Dorothy's The Tunnel and Interim, and Virginia's Night and Day, \"Kew Gardens\", and Mrs Dalloway.\n\nThe London array does not yet contain enough to be introduced online, but a few examples of output from this array-in-progress are printed below:\n\nApril 16, 2017\n\nlinks added on April 20, 2017\n\nE aster weekend. Continuing work on \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf Writing. Reading Virginia Woolf's Night and Day, in which Jane Austen's deftly satirical language is perfectly mimicked in a tunnel-view novel of 20th century English courtship.\n\nSince last month's immersion in Richardson's The Tunnel, I have been thinking that an array should be created for London, but have not wanted to construct it. In the light of Night and Day, (published in 1919; The Tunnel was published in 1920) I can no longer delay this personally-undesirable foray into City.\n\nWriting: Every new addition to the writing array increases knowledge of how these two extraordinary women approached the writing of radically experimental works. Every generated page from the Writing array is also a dialogue between Dorothy and Virginia. At one point, I wrote code in which variables from each woman alternated precisely: Dorothy's words, Virginia's words; Dorothy's words, Virginia's words -- but I found that the generated results seemed forced/didactic. Surprisingly, the arrays that comprise \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf Writing generate in a more natural manner if their voices appear at the will of the computer -- as seen in the examples below:\n\nAnd last week, I continued to add to the Dorothy and Alan array -- particularly interested in how a few words from Dorothy's short story \"Tryst\" \" encapsulate her (and Virginia's) mixed feelings about the role of marriage in the lives of creative women:\n\nApril 4, 2017\n\nEarly spring. The sound of rain. At home, reading Richardson's Interim and Woolf's short stories. In the library, reading Graham Meikle and Sherman Young's Media Convergence. And there are fig buttercups in the woods. Below me on the trail, there was an entrancing entire field of fig buttercups, but the hill was too steep to traverse on crutches.\n\nRevisiting my writer's notebooks from 2011-2012, I am piercing together the roots of the unmeasured polyphonic authoring I used in \"Begin with Arrival\". (Part II of From Ireland with Letters). In editing From Ireland, it is on this section that I have lingered, and it is this section that I am focusing on for the Other Codes Conference in Galway in May. The topic is: conveying diaspora with polyphonic electronic literature.\n\nA s sometimes happens in my evolving practice -- in exploring the lineage of the algorithmically combined voices of Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf in \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf Writing -- I return to John Cage. In this case, it is Cage's The First Meeting of the Satie Society. The electronic version of this work (not the book or the recording) was published on Art Com Electronic Network in 1986, where it was soon followed by my Uncle Roger.\n\nIn \"Art Works as Organic Communication Systems\", her paper in the 1991 Roy Ascott/Carl Loeffler edited issue of Leonardo, Anna Couey describes The First Meeting of the Satie Society in this way:\n\n\"Conceived by John Cage and realized through the application of programs written at Cage's request by Jim Rosenberg and Andrew Culver (1985-86), this homage to the composer Erik Satie consisted of texts (presents) by writers who knew and loved Satie's work (or who might have if they had existed in a time period that enabled them to know it), restructured by two computer programs. The texts were written by Henry David Thoreau, James Joyce, Marcel Duchamp, Chris Mann, Marshall McLuhan and John Cage, and also included selections from The Book of Genesis; there was also a \"response\" by Satie, consisting of selected quotes. One of the computer programs, MESOLIST, by Jim Rosenberg created mesostics on Satie's name and works from lines of text selected by IC a program by Andrew Culver that replicated the chance processes of the I Ching.\"\n\nHer observations on the reader-revealed meaning of this work are also of interest as regards \"the whole room\":\n\n\"The First Meeting of the Satie Society, while conceptually the work of Cage, was written through the convergence of several humans and software -- and reflects of a multiplicity of (not entirely human) voices. Cage's emphasis on the readers' use of the work points both to the importance of process (that art extends beyond its completion by the artist) and to user participation (in creating additional meanings through use).\"\n\nLast week, working on the writing array for \"the whole room like a picture in a dream, it was a pleasure to add variables from Dorothy Richardson's Interim, in particular, her references to narrative-disclosing toys. For instance:\n\n\"....the sound of the paper scraping over the little wooden roller as the printed scenes came round backwards or forwards, and plunged into descriptions of deep views of the insides of cathedrals in sharp relief in a clear silver light, mountains, lakes, statuary in clear light out of doors...\"\n\nFor instance:\n\n\"Do you remember looking at the kaleidoscope? I used to cry about it sometimes at night; thinking of the patterns I had not seen. I thought there was a new pattern every time you shook it, for ever. We had a huge one with very small bits of glass. They clicked smoothly when the pattern changed and were very beautifully coloured...\"\n\nAs the arrays in \"the whole room\" are augmented, the words moving between Dorothy and Virginia continue in an extraordinary allusive dialogue. Last week, I entered these words from Virginia's short story, \"Haunted House\" (written a year or so after Dorothy's Interim was serialised in the Little Review, which at the time was also -- until Post Office charges of obcenity -- serializing Joyce's Ulysses):\n\n\"The window panes reflected apples, reflected roses; all the leaves were green in the glass. If they moved in the drawing room, the apple only turned its yellow side.\"\n\nIn my forthcoming paper: \"'A WAY IS OPEN' Allusion, Authoring System, Identity, and Audience in Early Text-Based Electronic Literature\" ( in Dene Grigar and James O'Sullivan, eds,, Contexts, Forms, and Practices of Electronic Literature) I write:\n\n\"Allusion is a fragile concept for working artists. We saw a work 10 or 20 years ago and remember it vaguely. The work of John Cage and the Fluxus artists lying in the background, not always acknowledged but always there; Fluxus alluded to for years in the continuing creation of boxes as containers for words. The work of Sonya Rapoport in the San Francisco Bay area, instilling the idea of computer-mediated installation in the collective mind; icon-laden stamp art from Ed Higgins, echoed in the interface for A Party at Silver Beach; the way video artist Joan Jonas integrated myth and life; her video I Want to Live in the Country (And Other Romances) alluded to in the concluding \"Song\" of its name was Penelope -- although if I hadn't told you this you would never know.\"\n\nMarch 26, 2017\n\nIt was another intense week of writing/coding; the epic Facebook retelling of the chapters of Social Media Archeology and Poetics concluded with Gary Larson's chapter on \"From Archaeology to Architecture: Building a Place for Noncommercial Culture Online\"; a plan to create a manageable website in conjunction with the book was finally set in motion; the reading for the Social Media Narrative: Issues in Contemporary Practice resource continued -- and the whole was punctuated with library interludes.\n\nImmersed in \"the whole room like a picture in a dream\": Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf Writing, I worked primarily on the Dorothy and Alan array, with brief excursions into the reading and writing arrays. In the library rare book room, I read a small treasure of a book: Dorothy Richardson, John Austen and the Inseparables (London: William Jackson Books, 1930). It begins with a foreword by the illustrator Austen -- who was a close friend of Alan Odle -- in which he writes:\n\n\"It should be the artist-craftsman's job to make his own book -- not with his hands -- the machine will do that labor for him -- but with his brain and eye --using type, printing, binding, and engraving, in his own way to serve his own idea of beauty of form. Thus only can he really work. No one else can do it as he can for it is his job.\"\n\nOther than briefly documenting a shared exhibition, Dorothy's text does not directly address Alan, but serves instead to increase the respect for the work of book illustrators and for the book itself as a responsive, companionable object:\n\n\"And thus it is that although the book yields its treasure not directly in a single eyeful but extendedly in the course of a prolonged collaboration between reader and writer, it remains humanity's intimate.\"\n\n\"...mobile and companionable, allowing itself to be carried in the pocket to the ends of the earth.\"\n\nDorothy's intense privacy, as well as Alan's expression of his life and ideas only through the graphic arts, have made this array challenging. But in the library, I found last week a letter to a Spanish publisher \", (\"Data for a Spanish Publisher, reprinted in Dorothy Miller Richardson, Journey to Paradise: Short Stories and Autobiographical Sketches, edited by Trudi Tate. London Virago, 1989) which included a few words about her husband. Addressing what he brought to her life as a writer and the overcoming of misgivings in their shared artist-writer's marriage, her words appear throughout the output of the Dorothy_Alan array:\n\nAnd in various biographies and introductions -- Rosenberg, Fromm, Gregory, Hanscombe -- I found descriptions of both Alan and Dorothy, which I am adding to the Dorothy and Alan array. A few are in the example below. Note that the \"word sketch\" version of this array still appears in \"the whole room\" interface, but (not here but from within the whole room), if you click on \"a window with just the right north light\", a more \"word-painterly\" version is generated.\n\nThis week I was also very happy to receive the news that my presentation of as if the memory was a song: From Ireland with Letters will be at Other Codes / Cóid Eile -- The First Galway Digital Cultures Initiative Conference at the National University of Ireland, Galway this May. Thus, I returned yesterday to the final editing of this work -- rereading the whole both with some pleasure at how this electronic manuscript situated ballad is created with words -- and with dismay at a few remaining rough passages. Onward...\n\nMarch 14, 2017\n\nedited on March 15\n\nThe snow is still falling fast outside m"
