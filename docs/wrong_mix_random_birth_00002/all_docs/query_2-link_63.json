        "text": "NJSO PERFORMS FULL FILM SCORE AT SCREENING OF THE CLASSIC 1939 FILM\n\nPRE-CONCERT FESTIVITIES INCLUDE COSTUME CONTEST, DANCING AND SING-ALONG OF OZ TUNES\n\nSat, Apr 26, at NJPAC in Newark\n\nSun, Apr 27, at State Theatre in New Brunswick\n\nNEWARK, NJ (March 17, 2014)—The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra presents The Wizard of Oz with live orchestral accompaniment on April 26 and 27 in Newark and New Brunswick. Conductor Constantine Kitsopoulos returns to lead the NJSO in Harold Arlen’s full film score as the movie screens above the stage in the Orchestra’s third NJSO POPS program of the season.\n\nThe American Film Institute named the classic 1939 musical film, which celebrates its 75th anniversary this year, the sixth greatest American movie of all time. Critic Roger Ebert writes: “‘The Wizard of Oz’ fills such a large space in our imagination. It somehow seems real and important in a way most movies don’t … ‘The Wizard of Oz’ has a wonderful surface of comedy and music, special effects and excitement, but we still watch it [decades] later because its underlying story penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of childhood, stirs them and then reassures them.”\n\nOf the experience of seeing The Wizard of Oz with an orchestra performing the film score live, The Washington Post writes: “having the music in the foreground of the film brought out elements and moments that usually go unnoticed. From the frightening tarantella of the Wicked Witch to the melodies of ‘there’s no place like home,’ the threads of the film are woven together by the music.”\n\nPerformances take place on Saturday, April 26, (8 pm) at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC) in Newark and Sunday, April 27, (3 pm) at the State Theatre in New Brunswick. The April 27 performance is presented in collaboration with the State Theatre.\n\nAttendees can dress up as favorite Wizard of Oz characters to participate in a pre-concert costume contest—with prize categories for adults and children—in the concert-hall lobby. Other special festivities also precede each concert. Patrons can dance to the swinging sounds of the Michael Arenella Sextet in the NJPAC lobby on April 26 and can join in on a sing-along of songs from both The Wizard of Oz and the Harold Arlen songbook at the State Theatre on April 27. In February, nearly 300 attendees of the Orchestra’s Beatles-themed pops concerts with Classical Mystery Tour enjoyed the pre-concert dancing and sing-along events.\n\nTICKETS\n\nTickets start at $20 and are available for purchase online at www.njsymphony.org, by phone at 1.800.ALLEGRO (255.3476) or in person. The NJSO ticket office is located at 60 Park Place, 9th floor, in Newark; tickets are available by phone or in person Monday–Friday, 9 am to 5 pm. Tickets are also available, by phone only, on concert-weekend Saturdays, 11 am to 5 pm. Tickets for the April 27 performance are also available from the State Theatre ticket office online at www.StateTheatreNJ.org, by phone at 732.246.SHOW (7469) or in person. The State Theatre ticket office is located at 15 Livingston Ave in New Brunswick—hours are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, 10 am to 6 pm; Wednesday, 11 am to 7 pm; Saturday, 1 to 5 pm, and at least three hours prior to curtain on performance dates unless otherwise specified.\n\nAdditional information is available at www.njsymphony.org/events/detail/the-wizard-oz-with-orchestra.\n\nSPRING INTO MUSIC GALA\n\nThe NJSO hosts its 2014 Spring into Music Gala on Saturday, April 26, at NJPAC in Newark. The event includes cocktails, dinner and a silent auction, followed by the Wizard of Oz NJSO POPS concert. The gala’s honorees are former Governor Brendan Byrne and his wife, Ruthi, in honor of the Governor’s 90th birthday. Governor Chris Christie and former Governors Richard J. Codey, Donald T. DiFrancesco, James J. Florio, Thomas H. Kean, James E. McGreevey and Christine Todd Whitman are honorary gala chairs. All proceeds from the gala event will support the NJSO as it enriches lives through its artistic, music education and community engagement programs."
