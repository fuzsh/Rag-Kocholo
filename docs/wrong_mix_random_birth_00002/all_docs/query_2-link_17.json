CAROL WOODS\n\nFor the past few years, Carol Woods has been touring the country as Matron “Mama” Morton in the national touring company of Kander and Ebb’s Chicago, belting “When You’re Good To Mama” eight times a week. Now, the former Goodbye Girl star, who will return to Broadway in the upcoming, eagerly anticipated revival of Follies, is currently preparing a cabaret act for Arci’s Place (450 Park Avenue South), where she will open on January 30 for a four-week run. Woods’ act, which is entitled Stick Around, will feature such tunes as “Come Rain or Come Shine,” “Children Will Listen,” “Even God Must Get the Blues,” “Sit On It,” David Friedman’s “As Long As I Can Sing” and Rupert Holmes’ “People You Never Get to Love.” What follows are a few of Woods’ choice quotes from an upcoming Playbill article written by actor/writer David Drake.\n\nabout her decision to perform a cabaret act:\n\n“[One night in Chicago] I thought, ‘I’m a singer who doesn’t sing!’ I mean, I do these Broadway shows -- and I’m getting ready to do another - where I have this one song and then, I disappear! . . . I made a decision: ‘When I go home to New York, I’m going to sing.’ That was my goal. And in New York, honey, you’ve got to have a goal.”\n\nabout the start of her career:\n\n“A lot of folks don’t know this, but [professionally] I got my start singing in cabarets. Of course, we didn’t call it cabaret, we just called it a night club. I did the ‘Chittlin Circuit,’ you know, the black clubs.”\n\nabout her former profession:\n\n“I do still miss [nursing]. But, you know, I still feel like I’m nursing. I mean, that’s what we do when we go out onstage: We’re administering to the audiences, giving them a show -- it’s healing.”\n\nQUOTABLE QUOTES\n\nLawson Taitte’s review of Patti LuPone’s recent concert with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra (in the Dallas Morning News):\n\n“Ms. LuPone was pretty sensational, too . . . The most-fun moment came when the singer alleged she could do either star female role in West Side Story (snarling to the audience, \"Only you made me become Ethel Merman\"). Or both of them. She then launched into the great Anita Maria duet, ‘A Boy Like That/I Have a Love,’ singing both roles - sometimes almost simultaneously. The crowning touch was when the time came for Maria to hit her final high note, and Ms. LuPone picked up a glass of water and took a drink instead. The singer used all her classical theater training to cross the line from burlesque to serious emotion back and forth at will. Her pipes are still in astounding shape for someone who has been belting constantly for more than 20 years.”\n\nA review of “Girls, Girls, Girls,” which airs on VH1 this Thursday at 10 PM and includes a feature on Jennifer Holliday (from Jeff Gemmill’s “Music Guide” in TV Guide):\n\n“This All Access episode -- which plays like six mini-versions of Behind the Music, on women -- is a reminder of the thin line between success and excess. Profiles include the Go-Go’s, whose career was sometimes riddled with substance abuse, and Jennifer Holliday of ‘Dreamgirls,’ who discusses her suicide attempt . . .”\n\nIN OTHER NEWS It looks like Tony and Olivier Award winner Patti LuPone will bring her acclaimed Matters of the Heart concert act to New Jersey’s Paper Mill Playhouse in March for a one-night only performance. Stay tuned for confirmation and price list . . .
