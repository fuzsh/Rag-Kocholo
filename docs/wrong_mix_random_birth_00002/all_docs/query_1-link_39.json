        "text": "Bayonne bay-ohn[20] is a city in Hudson County, New Jersey, United States. Located in the Gateway Region, Bayonne is situated on a peninsula located between Newark Bay to the west, the Kill Van Kull to the south, and New York Bay to the east. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city's population was 63,024,[9][10][11] reflecting an increase of 1,182 (+1.9%) from the 61,842 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 398 (+0.6%) from the 61,444 counted in the 1990 Census.[21]\n\nBayonne was originally formed as a township on April 1, 1861, from portions of Bergen Township. Bayonne was reincorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 10, 1869,[22] replacing Bayonne Township, subject to the results of a referendum held nine days later.[23] At the time it was formed, Bayonne included the communities of Bergen Point, Constable Hook, Centreville, Pamrapo and Saltersville.[24]\n\nBayonne is east of Newark, the state's largest city, north of Elizabeth in Union County and west of Brooklyn. It shares a land border with Jersey City to the north and is connected to Staten Island by the Bayonne Bridge.[25] While somewhat diminished, traditional manufacturing, distribution, and maritime activities remain a driving force of the economy of the city, and a portion of the Port of New York and New Jersey is located there.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nOriginally inhabited by Native Americans, the region presently known as Bayonne was claimed by the Netherlands after Henry Hudson explored the Hudson River which is named after him. According to Royden Page Whitcomb's 1904 book, First History of Bayonne, New Jersey, the name Bayonne is speculated to have originated with Bayonne, France, from which Huguenots settled for a year before the founding of New Amsterdam.[26]However, there is no empirical evidence for this notion, which is considered apocryphal. Whitcomb gives more credence to the idea that Erastus Randall, E.C. Bramhall and B.F. Woolsey, who bought the land owned by Jasper and William Cadmus for real estate speculation, named it Bayonne for purposes of real estate speculation, because it was located on the shores of two bays, Newark and New York.[27]\n\nThe city experienced strikes that led to significant civil unrest during the Bayonne refinery strikes of 1915–1916, in which mostly Polish American workers staged labor actions against Standard Oil of New Jersey and Tidewater Petroleum, seeking improved pay and working conditions.[28] Four striking workers were killed when strikebreakers protected by police fired into a crowd.[29]\n\nGeography[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 11.082 square miles (28.702 km2), including 5.804 square miles (15.033 km2) of land and 5.278 square miles (13.669 km2) of water (47.62%) was water.[1][2]\n\nThe city is located south of Jersey City on a peninsula earlier known as Bergen Neck surrounded by Upper New York Bay to the east, Newark Bay to the west, and Kill Van Kull to the south.\n\nUnincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include:[30] Bergen Point, Constable Hook and Port Johnson.[citation needed]\n\nDemographics[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.%± 1870 3,834 1880 9,372 144.4% 1890 19,033 103.1% 1900 32,722 71.9% 1910 55,545 69.7% 1920 76,754 38.2% 1930 88,979 15.9% 1940 79,198 −11.0% 1950 77,203 −2.5% 1960 74,215 −3.9% 1970 72,743 −2.0% 1980 65,047 −10.6% 1990 61,444 −5.5% 2000 61,842 0.6% 2010 63,024 1.9% Est. 2015 66,311 [12][31] 5.2% Population sources: 1870-1920[32]\n\n1870[33][34] 1880-1890[35]\n\n1890-1910[36] 1870-1930[37]\n\n1930-1990[38] 2000[39][40] 2010[9][10][11]\n\n2010 Census[edit]\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 63,024 people, 25,237 households, and 16,051 families residing in the city.

The first revived Bayonne Hometown Fair took place from June 6–7, 2015.[52]\n\nGovernment[edit]\n\nLocal government[edit]\n\nThe City of Bayonne has been governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government (Plan C), implemented based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission as of July 1, 1962,[53] before which it was governed by a Board of Commissioners under the Walsh Act. The governing body consists of a mayor and a five-member city council, of which two seats are elected at-large and three from wards.[7][3][54]\n\nAs of 2016, the Mayor of Bayonne is Jimmy Davis, who was elected in a runoff election on June 10, 2014, against incumbent Mayor Mark Smith.

McKnight (D, Jersey City).[70]\n\nHudson County is governed by a directly elected County Executive and by a Board of Chosen Freeholders, which serves as the county's legislative body. Hudson County's Freeholder District 1 includes all of Bayonne and a part of Jersey City. As of 2015 is represented by Kenneth Kopacz[71] The County Executive is DemocratThomas A. DeGise, whose term of office ends December 31, 2015.[72]\n\nPolitics[edit]\n\nAs of March 23, 2011, there were a total of 32,747 registered voters in Bayonne, of which 17,087 (52.2%) were registered as Democrats, 2,709 (8.3%) were registered as Republicans and 12,928 (39.5%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There were 23 voters registered to other parties.[73]\n\nIn the 2012 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 66.4% of the vote (13,467 cast), ahead of Republican Mitt Romney with 32.6% (6,605 votes), and other candidates with 1.0% (197 votes), among the 20,454 ballots cast by the city's 34,424 registered voters (185 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 59.4%.[74][75] In the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 57.0% of the vote here (13,768 cast), ahead of Republican John McCain with 40.6% (9,796 votes) and other candidates with 1.2% (283 votes), among the 24,139 ballots cast by the town's 35,823 registered voters, for a turnout of 67.4%.[76] In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John Kerry received 56.0% of the vote here (12,402 ballots cast), outpolling Republican George W. Bush with 42.2% (9,341 votes) and other candidates with 0.6% (184 votes), among the 22,135 ballots cast by the town's 32,129 registered voters, for a turnout percentage of 68.9.[77]\n\nIn the 2013 gubernatorial election, Republican Chris Christie received 49.3% of the vote (5,322 cast), ahead of Democrat Barbara Buono with 49.1% (5,297 votes), and other candidates with 1.6% (169 votes), among the 10,987 ballots cast by the city's 34,957 registered voters (199 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 31.4%.[78][79] In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Democrat Jon Corzine received 53.8% of the vote here (7,421 ballots cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 38.7% (5,333 votes), Independent Chris Daggett with 4.8% (662 votes) and other candidates with 1.3% (183 votes), among the 13,781 ballots cast by the town's 32,588 registered voters, yielding a 42.3% turnout.[80]\n\nLocal services[edit]\n\nMunicipal Utilities Authority[edit]\n\nThe Bayonne Municipal Utilities Authority (BMUA) is the second agency to use wind power in New Jersey and has built the first wind turbine in the metropolitan area.[81][82][83][84][85] Construction of a single turbine tower was completed in January 2012.[86][87] It is the first wind turbine created by Leitwind to be installed in the United States.[88]\n\nIn December 2012, the autonomous agency entered into a water management agreement with the Bayonne Water Joint Venture (BWJV), a partnership between United Water and investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts.[89] The 40-year concession agreement is a public-private partnership between the city and the BWJV in which the private partners pay off the BMUA's $130 million debt and take over the operations, maintenance, and capital improvement of Bayonne's water and wastewater utilities in exchange for a regulated share of the revenue.[90][91][92] United Water is managing the operations for the partnership, while KKR is providing 90% of the funding.[93] A rate schedule was included in the agreement, and it contained an immediate 8.5% utility rate increase (the first rate increase since 2006),[89] followed by two years without increases, followed by annual increases estimated to range between 2.5% - 4.5%.[91] This partnership was sought for several reasons, including the BMUA's debt, its shortage of skilled employees, and its lagging rate revenue from years without rate increases and reduced demand.[90][94] Part of this reduced demand stemmed from the closure of the Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne,[94] and the fact that the subsequent plans to redevelop the site with housing fell short.[95] The BMUA's $130 million debt that was paid off by the BWJV represented over half of Bayonne's overall debt ($240 million) at the time,[91] and in March 2013, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the credit rating of Bayonne from 'negative' to 'stable', citing the water deal.[93]\n\nFire department[edit]\n\nThe city of Bayonne is protected on a full-time, around-the-clock basis by the 161 professional firefighters of the city of Bayonne Fire Department (BFD), which was founded on September 3, 1906, and operates out of five fire stations, located throughout the city. The BFD operates a fire apparatus fleet of five engines, three ladders, one squad (rescue pumper), one rescue truck (part of the Metro USAR Collapse Rescue Strike Team), two fireboats, a Multi-Purpose Unit (M.P.U.), a large 4,000-US-gallon (15,000 l; 3,300 imp gal) foam tanker truck, a haz-mat truck,and numerous other special, support and reserve units. Each piece of apparatus is staffed by three fire fighters and a captain. Each platoon works on a 24 hours on, 72 hours off schedule and is commanded by a Battalion Chief. The BFD responds to approximately 17,000 emergency calls annually. The current Chief of Department is Keith Weaver.[96]\n\nThe department is part of the Metro USAR Strike Team, which consists of nine North Jersey fire departments and other emergency services divisions working to address major emergency rescue situations.[97]\n\nEducation[edit]\n\nPublic schools[edit]\n\nThe Bayonne Board of Education serves students from pre-Kindergarten through twelfth grade. As of the 2011-12 school year, the district's 12 schools had an enrollment of 9,418 students and 646.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 14.58:1.[98] Schools in the district (with 2011-12 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics[99]) are the 11 elementary schools Henry E. Harris No. 1[100] (grades PreK-8; 636 students), Phillip G. Vroom No. 2[101] (PreK-8; 421), Dr. Walter F. Robinson No. 3[102] (PreK-8; 788), Mary J. Donohoe No. 4[103] (PreK-8; 485), Lincoln Community School No. 5[104] (PreK-8; 444), Horace Mann No. 6[105] (PreK-8; 599), Midtown Community School No. 8[106] (PreK-8; 1,087), George Washington Community School No. 9[107] (PreK-8; 663), Woodrow Wilson School No. 10[108] (PreK-8; 617), John M. Bailey School No. 12[109] (PreK-8; 637) and Nicholas Oresko School No. 14[110] (PreK-8; 444) an advanced school for gifted and talented students in academics, the arts, and physical education; and Bayonne High School[111] (9-12; 2,597).[112][113] Bayonne High School is the only public school in the state to have an on-campus ice rink for its hockey team.[114]\n\nDuring the 1998-99 school year, Midtown Community School No. 8 was recognized with the National Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education.[115] During the 2008–09 school year, P.S. #14 was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School award, and Washington Community School No. 9 was honored during the 2009–10 school year.[116]\n\nFor the 2004–05 school year, Mary J. Donohoe No. 4 School was named a \"Star School\" by the New Jersey Department of Education, the highest honor that a New Jersey school can achieve.[117] It is the fourth school in Bayonne to receive this honor. The other three are Bayonne High School in 1995–96,[118] Midtown Community School in 1996–97[119] and P.S. #14 in the 1998–99 school year.[120]\n\nBeginning with the 2006–07 school year, the Board of Education implemented a dress code for students in pre-K through eighth grade. Under this code students wear a school logo shirt and a variety of pants, skirts, shorts, and other prescribed items. The plan was intended to \"increase student identification with their schools and the district, eliminate many of the distractions associated with differences in social or economic status, allow the children, their teachers and the Board of Education to concentrate on shared pursuit of educational excellence [and] instill a sense of belonging and school pride\".[121][122] The decision prompted a battle between the Board and parents upset at the manner in which the policy was imposed, the cost of the uniforms, the loss of freedom of expression to students in choosing the clothing they wear and issues regarding the manner in which the contract was awarded.[123]\n\nPrivate schools[edit]\n\nPrivate schools in Bayonne include All Saints Catholic Academy for grades PreK-8 and the co-ed Marist High School for grades 9-12, both of which operate under the supervision of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.[124][125]\n\nThe Yeshiva Gedolah of Bayonne is a yeshiva high school / Bais Medrash / Kolel with 130 students.[126]\n\nHoly Family Academy for girls in ninth through twelfth grades was closed at the end of the 2012-13 school year in the wake of financial difficulties and declining enrollment, having lost the support of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia in 2008.[127]\n\nLibraries and museums[edit]\n\nThe Bayonne Public Library,[128] one of New Jersey's original 36 Carnegie libraries,[129] the Bayonne Community Museum,[130]the Bayonne Firefighters Museum,[131] and the Joyce-Herbert VFW Post 226 Veterans Museum[132] provide educational events and programs.\n\nTransportation[edit]\n\nRoads and highways[edit]\n\nAs of May 2010, the city had a total of 76.55 miles (123.20 km) of roadways, of which 65.78 miles (105.86 km) were maintained by the city, 4.82 miles (7.76 km) are overseen by Hudson County, 4.04 miles (6.50 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and 1.91 miles (3.07 km) are the responsibility of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[133]\n\nThe Bayonne Bridge connects south to Staten Island over the Kill Van Kull. Kennedy Boulevard is a major thoroughfare along the west side of the city from the bridge north to Jersey City and North Hudson.\n\nThe Newark Bay Extension (Interstate 78) of the New Jersey Turnpike northbound travels to Jersey City and, via the Holland Tunnel, Manhattan. Westbound, the Newark Bay Bridge provides access to Newark, Newark Liberty International Airport and the rest of the turnpike (Interstate 95).[134]\n\nRoute 440 runs along the east side of Bayonne, and the West Side of Jersey City, partially following the old Morris Canal route.[135] Although it has traffic lights it is usually the quickest route north-south within Bayonne. It connects to the Bayonne Bridge, I-78, and to Route 185 to Liberty State Park.\n\nPublic transportation[edit]\n\nBus transportation is provided on three main north-south streets of the city: Broadway, Kennedy Boulevard, and Avenue C, both by the state-operated NJ Transit and several private bus lines.[136] The Broadway line runs solely inside Bayonne city limits, while bus lines on Avenue C and Kennedy Boulevard run to various end points in Jersey City. The NJ Transit 120 runs between Avenue C in Bayonne and Battery Park in Downtown Manhattan during rush hours in peak direction while the 81 provides service to New Jersey.[137]\n\nMTA Regional Bus Operations provides bus service between Bayonne and Staten Island on the S89 route, which connects the 34th Street light rail station and the Eltingville neighborhood on Staten Island with no other stops in Bayonne. It is the first interstate bus service operated by the New York City Transit Authority.[138]\n\nThe Hudson-Bergen Light Rail has four stops in Bayonne, all originally from the former Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ). They are located at 45th Street, 34th Street, 22nd Street, all just east of Avenue E, and 8th Street (the southern terminal of the 8th Street-Hoboken Line) at Avenue C, which opened in January 2011.[139]\n\nFor 114 years, the CNJ ran frequent service through the city. Trains ran north to the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal in Jersey City. Trains ran west to Elizabethport, Elizabeth, and Cranford for points west and south. The building of the Aldene Connection by-passed CNJ trains around Bayonne so that nearly all trains would either terminate at Newark Pennsylvania Station or at Hoboken Terminal. Until August 6, 1978, a shuttle service between Bayonne and Cranford retained the last leg of service with the CNJ trains.[140]\n\nPoints of interest[edit]\n\nThe Bayonne Bridge is the fifth-longest steel arch bridge in the world. For the more than 45 years from its dedication in 1931 until the completion of the New River Gorge Bridge, the Bayonne Bridge was the world's longest such bridge.[141]\n\nBergen Point\n\nConstable Hook is the site of two burials grounds known as the Constable Hook Cemetery,[142] numerous tank farms and the Bayonne Golf Club, situated at the city's highest point\n\nShooters Island, closed to the general public, is a 35 acres (14 ha) islandof which 7.5 acres (3.0 ha) are in Bayonnethat is operated as a bird sanctuary by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.[143]\n\nNational Registered Historic Places and museums[edit]\n\nSee List of Registered Historic Places in Hudson County, New Jersey\n\nBayonne Truck House No. 1, home to Bayonne Firefighters Museum\n\nBayonne Trust Company, home to Bayonne Community Museum\n\nFirst Reformed Dutch Church of Bergen Neck\n\nRobbins Reef Light - Built to serve ships heading into New York Harbor, the current structure at the site dates to 1883, replacing an earlier lighthouse constructed in 1839.[144]\n\nMedia and culture[edit]\n\nBayonne is located within the New York media market, with most of its daily papers available for sale or delivery. Local, county, and regional news is covered by the daily Jersey Journal. The Bayonne Community News is part of The Hudson Reporter group of local weeklies. Other weeklies, the River View Observer and El Especialito also cover local news.[145] Bayonne-based periodicals include the Bayonne Evening Star-Telegram (B.E.S.T.).\n\nBayonne's local culture is served by the Annual Outdoor Art Show, which was instituted in 2008, in which local artists display their works.[146]\n\nJackie Gleason, a former headliner at the Hi-Hat Club in Bayonne, was fascinated by the city and mentioned it often in the television series The Honeymooners.[147]\n\nFilms set in Bayonne include the 1991 film Mortal Thoughts, with Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, which was filmed near Horace Mann School and locations around Bayonne and Hoboken;[148] the 2000 drama Men of Honor, starring Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr.; the 2002 drama Hysterical Blindness; and the 2005 Tom Cruise science fiction film War of the Worlds, which opens at the Bayonne home of the lead character, and depicts the destruction of the Bayonne Bridge by aliens. Films shot in Bayonne include the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, scenes of which were filmed at the Peninsula at Bayonne Harbor,[149] and the 2008 Mickey Rourke drama The Wrestler, which was partially filmed in the Color & Cuts Salon and the former Dolphin Gym, both of which are on Broadway in Bayonne.[150][151]\n\nThe November 16, 2010, episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart parodied former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin's reality television series, Sarah Palin's Alaska, in the form of a trailer for a fictional reality show called Jason Jones' Bayonne, New Jersey, whose portrayal of the city was characterized by prostitution, drugs, crime, pollution and a stereotypical Italian-American population.[152] Bayonne Mayor Mark Smith criticized the sketch, saying, \"Jon Stewart's unfortunate and inaccurate depiction of Bayonne represents a lame attempt at humor at the expense of a rock solid, all-American community.\"[153]\n\nThe comic strip Piranha Club (originally \"Ernie\"), drawn by Bud Grace, is set in and around Bayonne.[154]\n\nThe ABC sci-fi comedy television series, The Neighbors, is about a family that moves from Bayonne into a fictional gated community, Hidden Hills, that is populated by aliens from another planet posing as humans.[155]\n\nThe Best Show with Tom Scharpling records near Bayonne, and the town is frequently mentioned due to Associate Producer Mike Lisk (a.k.a. AP Mike) being a Bayonne native, who tends bar at Massa's Tavern, a local bar.\n\nThe city has a very ethnically diverse population, home to large populations of Italian Americans, Irish Americans, Polish Americans, Egyptian Americans, Dominican Americans, Mexican Americans, Salvadoran Americans, Pakistani Americans, Puerto Ricans, amongst others.\n\nNotable people[edit]\n\nPeople who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Bayonne include ((B) denotes that the person was born in the city):\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
