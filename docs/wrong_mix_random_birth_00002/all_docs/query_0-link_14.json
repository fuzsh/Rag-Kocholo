        "text": "Tag: Helen Hokinson\n\nA Decade of Delights\n\nWith this post (No. 413), we mark the tenth anniversary of The New Yorker. Since I began A New Yorker State of Mind in March 2015, I’ve attempted to give you at least a sense of what the magazine was like in those first years, as well as the historical events that often informed its editorial content as well as its famed cartoons. Those times also informed the advertisements; indeed, in some cases the ads give us a better idea of who was reading the magazine, as well as their changing tastes and buying power as we moved from the Roaring Twenties to the Depression, and from Prohibition into Repeal.\n\nI have also chosen this time to go on hiatus, and hopefully resume this blog when The New Yorker celebrates its centennial next February (this site will remain active and available, and I will continue to monitor comments and messages). Let us hope that the editors use the original Rea Irvin cover for that occasion, and restore his masthead above “The Talk of the Town” section. Perhaps some enterprising soul could start a petition.\n\nMoving on to the tenth anniversary issue, we find E.B. White recalling the world of The New Yorker’s first days. Given the massive economic and societal shifts that occurred from 1925 to 1935, those first days seemed distant to White, who felt old, “not in years but events.”\n\nWhite also noted a new craze that had originated around the same time as the birth of The New Yorker…\n\nWhite concluded with these parting words, tinged with world-weariness, writing “More seems likely to happen.” One wonders if he imagined The New Yorker at 100, which in our day is just around the corner. Like White, many us have grown weary of this angry world, where indeed more seems likely to happen. Let us hope it is for the best.\n\nNow, some unfinished business. We need to look at the previous issue, Feb. 9, 1935, before we close out the decade.\n\nWe stay on the lighter side, joining critic John Mosher at the local cinema to appreciate Leslie Howard’s dashing performance in The Scarlet Pimpernel…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nCigarette manufacturers employed every angle from sex to health claims to move their product…not to be left out of any niche market, Chesterfield even went after the little old ladies…\n\n…by contrast, the makers of Old Gold cigarettes featured a clueless sugar daddy and his leggy mistress in a series of ads drawn by famed pin-up artist George Petty…\n\n…Otto Soglow would do well with advertisers during his career, promoting everything from whiskey to Pepsi and Shredded Wheat to department stores…in this case Bloomingdale’s…after William Randolph Hearst’s King Features Syndicate wrested The Little King away from The New Yorker in September 1934, this was the only way you would see the harmless potentate in the magazine…\n\n…another New Yorker artist earning some ad dollars on the side was Constantin Alajalov, here adding a stylish flair for Coty…\n\n…and then there’s James Thurber, who continued to contribute his talents on behalf of the Theatre Guild…\n\n…and we move along to the Feb. 9 cartoons, with Thurber again…\n\n…the issue also featured two by George Price…\n\n…and Howard Baer supplied some life to this little party…\n\n…now let’s return to the Feb. 15, 1935 issue…\n\n…where John Mosher was back at the cinema, this time enjoying the story of a “beautiful stenographer”…\n\n* * *\n\nMore From Our Advertisers\n\nIn its bid for survival during the Depression, the luxury brand Packard introduced its first car under $1000, the 120. Sales more than tripled in 1935 and doubled again in 1936…\n\n…meanwhile, Hudson was hanging in there with innovations such as the “Electric Hand”…it was not a true automatic transmission, but it did allow drivers to shift gears near the steering wheel…\n\n…as demonstrated here…\n\n…whatever you were driving, Goodyear claimed it would keep you the safest with their “Double Eagles”…\n\n…I include this ad for Taylor Instruments because it features an illustration by Ervine Metzl, who would become known for his posters and postage stamp designs…\n\n…Metzl’s design of a three-cent stamp commemorating the 1957–1958 International Geophysical Year…\n\n…on to our cartoonists, we begin with this Deco-inspired artwork by an unidentified illustrator…\n\n…one of Helen Hokinson’s “girls” was going about her daily rounds…\n\n…Garrett Price gave us a gatekeeper not quite up to his task…\n\n…Gilbert Bundy was seeing stripes rather than stars…\n\n…while James Thurber’s medium was getting in touch with an equine spirit…\n\n…scientific inquiry knew no bounds in Robert Day’s world….\n\n…and in the world of Alain (aka Daniel Brustlein), old habits died hard…\n\n…and we close with Peter Arno, at his risqué best…\n\nThanks for reading The New Yorker State of Mind!\n\nLegitimate Nonchalance\n\nAbove: W.C. Fields was a well-known juggler and vaudeville performer decades before he became even more famous in the movies of the 1930s.\n\nWilliam Claude Dukenfield was a vaudeville juggler who distinguished himself from other “tramp acts” by adding sarcastic asides to his routines. Internationally known for his juggling skills, by the turn of the century the man who billed himself as “The Eccentric Juggler” would become much better known by another name: W.C. Fields.\n\nIn the first of a three-part profile, Alva Johnston pondered the secret behind Fields’ genius, an “inborn nonchalance” that he considered “the rarest of gifts.” Johnston surmised that some of that genius derived from the volatile relationship Fields had with his father, and the street-smarts he gained as a runaway at age eleven. It is no surprise, however, that these childhood stories of hardship were significantly embellished by the great wit himself.\n\nJohnston also described Fields’ acting style and demeanor, noting that the actor’s asides were likely inspired by his mother, Kate Spangler Felton, who was known for her doorstep witticisms.\n\n* * *\n\nMacabre Diversions\n\nIn the days before television and the internet, folks got their dose of the sensational and macabre from the tabloids, or, on occasion, in real life. Before crime or accident scene investigations became more sophisticated, it was not uncommon for crowds to mob grisly death scenes, including the car containing the bullet-riddled bodies of notorious bank robbers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. Their Ford automobile, pocked with 112 bullet holes, became a popular traveling attraction at fairs, amusement parks, and, in February 1935, at a car dealer’s showroom in Missouri. E.B. White explained:\n\n* * *\n\nSaar Kraut\n\nJanet Flanner mused on the recent plebiscite in the Saarland, which following World War I was seized from Germany and placed under the governance of a League of Nations commission. Much to the dismay of the French, the majority German population voted to return the Saar region to Germany, and its Nazi leadership.\n\n* * *\n\nOver the Rainbow\n\nIn a previous column, Lois Long took aim at the Rockefeller Center’s new Rainbow Room, dismissing it as a tourist trap filled with interminable strains of organ music. In her latest column, Long retracted some of that vitriol, finding the entertainment (and, one supposes, the food) more to her liking.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nAs Lois Long mentioned in “Tables for Two,” British actress and singer Beatrice Lillie was appearing at in the Rainbow Room on the 65th floor of Rockefeller Center; according to the ad below, also featured were ballroom dancers Lydia and Joresco and bandleader Jolly Corburn…\n\n…at first I though this was Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne shilling for Luckies, but the resemblance isn’t quite there, plus I’m not aware of the Broadway legends ever endorsing any product, let alone cigarettes…\n\n…the folks at Hormel continued to feature notable Frenchmen who were known to enjoy French onion soup, although this particular image doesn’t do much for one’s appetite…\n\n…the Bermuda Trade Development Board continued to feature colorful ads that enticed New Yorkers away from the late winter blahs…\n\n…this ad for Schaefer is a bit odd…I guess the artist wanted to suggest a handbill, and therefore tilted the image it at an angle, unsuccessfully, one might add…\n\n…The Theatre Guild once again called upon the talents of James Thurber to advertise their latest production…\n\n…which segues into our cartoons, with Thurber once more…\n\n…Al Frueh did his part to promote the stage with this illustration for the theatre section…\n\n…Otto Soglow offered his spin on pairs figure skating…\n\n…Gardner Rea explored the world of art appreciation…\n\n…Helen Hokinson aptly supplied this cartoon for Lois Long’s fashion column…\n\n…Whitney Darrow Jr. showed us the consequences of classified advertising…\n\n…Barbara Shermund clued us in on the latest gossip…\n\n…and we close with Peter Arno, and one butcher’s cold greeting…\n\nNext Time: A Decade of Delights…\n\nIt’s a Gift\n\nAbove: Charles Sellen as Mr. Muckle and W.C. Fields as shopkeeper Harold Bissonette in the 1934 film It's a Gift.\n\nRea Irvin featured the New York Auto Show on the cover of Jan. 12, 1935 issue—the extravaganza of cars at the Grand Central Palace was one place New Yorkers could go to chase away the winter blues. The other was at one of the city’s RKO theatres, where a classic W.C. Fields comedy was gracing the silver screen.\n\nIt’s a Gift was a showcase of Fields’ vaudevillian talents, tied together in a story about grocer Harold Bissonette (Fields) whose various tribulations included a pompous wife (who insisted on pronouncing the surname “biss-on-ay”), bratty children, and challenging customers (the hilarious Charles Sellen as Mr. Muckle). Writing for BFI Film Classics, Simon Louvish calls the film a chronicle of the “many titanic struggles between Harold Bissonnette and the universe. There will be battle of wills between father and daughter, between male and female, between man and a variety of uncontrollable objects.” Here is John Mosher’s review for The New Yorker.\n\n* * *\n\nBy Another Name\n\nE.B. White led off his column with a note about Persia, which had officially changed its name to Iran. To mark the new year, Reza Shah had officially asked foreign delegates to use the new term, which referred to the native name of the people who inhabited the region.\n\n* * *\n\nHot Rods\n\nThe New Yorker was back at the auto show, where correspondent “Speed” noted the appeal of the Auburn Speedster to a college-age crowd. The $2,500 price tag (equivalent to about $55k today) was apparently within reach for some of the lads at Columbia and other Ivies. Speed also admired the limousine version of the Chrysler Airflow, but the real car of his desires was a bottle-shaped milk truck.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThe proprietors of Essex House tapped into the popularity of the Auto Show to market their economical, yet deluxe accommodations…\n\n…the anti-war group World Peaceways continued its ad campaign with this image of the “most powerful man in America,” that is, the average citizen who should not be tricked into “the absurd business of war”…\n\n…United Airlines used the endorsement of journalist and radio commentator Edwin C. Hill to tout the safety and comfort of its airliners…\n\n…at the time, United’s flagship airplane was the Boeing 247…\n\n…”Mrs. William LaVarre” (Alice Lucille Elliott) was the latest adventurous soul to endorse the energizing effects of Camel cigarettes…\n\n…it was no coincidence that the Camel and Chesterfield ads both featured women, the tobacco companies’ biggest growth market in the 1930s…\n\n…on to our cartoons, we go bowling in this spot by George Shellhase…\n\n…a doctor’s bedside manner, in James Thurber’s world of the battling sexes…\n\n…two of Helen Hokinson’s “Girls” were left breathless by the exploits of Elias Burton Holmes, an American photographer and filmmaker who apparently coined the term “travelogue”…\n\n…for this next cartoon by Robert Day, a snippet from the Auto Show will shed some light…\n\n…and we close with Carl Rose, and some hijinks among the statuary…\n\nNext Time: Everything’s Jake…\n\nFarewell to 1934\n\nAbove: Ringing in the New Year at Times Square, 1934.\n\nWe bid adieu to 1934 with some odds and ends, beginning with E.B. White’s observations for the upcoming year, which if anyone had noticed the uptick in Ascot tie purchases, just might be a bit rosier than previous years of the decade.\n\nWhite was also hopeful for a new year with a less dreadful press, particularly the pandering type promulgated by William Randolph Hearst.\n\n* * *\n\nDr. Peeper\n\n“The Talk of the Town” noted that Dr. Allan Dafoe, the country doctor who gained fame for delivering the Dionne Quintuplets, expressed a desire to see Sally Rand perform her bubble dance during his visit to Gotham. “Talk” also looked in on the some of the technical aspects of the burlesque dancer’s signature act:\n\n* * *\n\nLeading Ladies\n\nFilm Critic John Mosher noted the continued rise of two leading female stars, twenty-seven-year-old Katharine Hepburn and six-year-old Shirley Temple. Mosher recalled Hepburn’s recent performance in Little Women, and proclaimed that she “succeeds again” in The Little Minister.\n\nAlthough Mosher admitted he was a “disagreeable adult” who doesn’t enjoy seeing children on the screen “more than necessary,” he acknowledged Shirley Temple’s talents as well as those of child actor Jane Withers in Bright Eyes.\n\n* * *\n\nThat Youthful Feeling\n\nGiven that William Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet were mere teenagers (the ages 13 and 16 were given to Juliet and Romeo, respectively), many productions featured actors more than twice that age. That was the case in 1933 when the play was revived by actress Katharine Cornell and her director husband Guthrie McClintic, who took the play on a seven-month nationwide tour before it was revised and opened on Broadway in December 1934. Critics dubbed the 41-year-old Cornell “the greatest Juliet of her time,” and it seems Robert Benchley heartily agreed in this excerpt from his stage review:\n\n* * *\n\nThe New Yorkiest Place\n\nIn 1930 gossip columnist Walter Winchell called the new Stork Club “New York’s New Yorkiest place on W. 58th,” and when it relocated to 3 East 53rd Street in 1934 it further defined itself as the ultimate New York night club. In her “Tables for Two” column, Lois Long found the new location much to her liking. An excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nSo Long?\n\nClarence Day, best known for his Life with Father stories, also contributed a number of cartoons to the magazine, accompanied by satirical poems and humorous shorts. Day would die at the tender age of 61—after a bout with pneumonia—in December 1935, about a year after this cartoon was published in The New Yorker. I assume he was signing off from the magazine in order to arrange publication of his Life with Father book, which was published shortly after his death.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nSunny California beckoned those who had the means and leisure to head to warmer climes during the New York winter…\n\n…for those who stayed behind, they could wrap themselves in a chic winter coat such as this one sported by Camel endorser Mrs. Langdon Post (Janet Kirby)…\n\n…another colorful ad with a not-so-colorful message from World Peaceways, a 1930s anti-war organization that characterized soldiers (and future soldiers, seen here) as pawns in the corrupt games of the rich and powerful…\n\n…the distributors of French champagne rang in the New Year by suggesting that Doyen was worth your very last cent…\n\n…we kick off our cartoons by welcoming the New Year with George Price…\n\n…Robert Day contributed a spot drawing that offered a new twist to ice hockey…\n\n…I should know this artist, but it escapes me for the moment…nevertheless, a great illustration to stretch across the bottom of an opening page…\n\n…a closeup of the signature…\n\n…another from George Price, still up in the air in the final issue of 1934…\n\n…Garner Rea introduced us to the life of the party…\n\n…”Miss Otis Regrets” is a 1934 Cole Porter song about the lynching of a society woman after she murders her unfaithful lover. Porter wrote the song as a parody of a sad cowboy song he heard on the radio. The song was further workshopped for fun at “smart set” cocktail parties…on to our next cartoon, and a moment of keen insight from James Thurber…\n\n…Garrett Price went on the town with some students of anatomy…\n\n…and we say Happy New Year with the help of Helen Hokinson…\n\nNext Time: Easy Riders…\n\nThe Age of Giants\n\nOtto Klemperer rehearsing at the Hollywood Bowl in September 1937. (Los Angeles Philharmonic)\n\nThe 20th century was an age of big personalities in classical music, among them Otto Klemperer (1885-1973), a German-born protégé of the composer and conductor Gustav Mahler. Klemperer was already an established conductor in opera houses around Germany when the rise of the Nazis prompted the maestro to emigrate with his family in 1933. He was soon appointed chief conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\n\nKlemperer also guest conducted a number of orchestras in the U.S., including the New York Philharmonic, where his larger than life presence caught the attention of “The Talk of the Town.” Excerpts:\n\nLauded internationally as a great orchestral commander, in 1939 Klemperer would begin experiencing balance issues. After a tumor the size of a small orange was removed from his brain, he would be left partially paralyzed on his right side; bouts of depression and a manic phase would later land him in a mental hospital. However, by 1946 he would recover his health enough to return to conducting in a career that would last until 1971.\n\nThe conductor’s daughter, Lotte Klemperer (1923–2003), would serve as her father’s secretary, negotiator and administrator until his death in 1973. Otto’s son, Werner Klemperer (1920–2000), would become a stage, screen and television actor, most notably portraying Colonel Klink in the 1960s comedy Hogan’s Heroes. Although the role would garner Werner two Emmys, his father never fully understood the series or even the concept of a sitcom. Reluctant to pursue a musical career while his father was alive, Werner would later join the Metropolitan Opera Company in the 1970s, appear in Broadway musicals, and serve as a narrator with a number of American symphony orchestras.\n\n* * *\n\nVanished in the Haze\n\nIn his “Notes and Comment,” E.B. White lamented what appeared to be the transformation of the familiar night club; high above Manhattan in the Rockefeller Center’s Rainbow Room, the comforting haze of “cigarette smoke, talc, waiter’s venom” had been displaced by air conditioning, and to add to the horror, an organ had been installed that tinged the fox trot “with an odd piety.”\n\n* * *\n\nThere Oughta Be a Law\n\nWhile E.B. White was mourning the demise of the smoky nightclub, art and design critic Lewis Mumford continued his tirade against the pretentious and mediocre buildings that were popping up all over the city, including the new Federal Court Building on Centre Street that was, in Mumford’s words, a supreme example of bad design and fake grandeur.\n\n* * *\n\nCrime of the Century\n\nThat is what the press called the kidnap and murder of the infant son of Charles Lindbergh and Anne Morrow. In September 1934 a German immigrant carpenter named Bruno Hauptmann was arrested for the crime, and a trial date was set for the following January. In his “A Reporter at Large” column, Morris Markey examined the ransom money trail that led to Hauptmann’s ultimate arrest. Excerpts:\n\n* * *\n\nShould Have Stayed Lost\n\nA film version of Willa Cather’s 1923 novel A Lost Lady was first made as a silent by Warner Brothers in 1924 (the film itself is lost) but in 1934 Warner had another go at the novel with a sound version starring starring Barbara Stanwyck, who was emerging as a major star. But Stanwyck’s talents could not overcome a script that critic John Mosher described as bleak, blank nonsense. Cather was so dismayed by the film that she refused to permit another adaptation of any of her novels during her lifetime.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWe kick off our sponsors with this two-page center spread from Hiram Walker & Sons, who introduced their new line of playing card-inspired whiskies…\n\n…the New Yorker’s Janet Flanner wrote in 1938 that Elsie de Wolfe invented interior design as a profession, so who was to argue with de Wolfe’s suggestion that the leisure class should linger in bed with the aid of a Wamsutta bed-rest…the small print beneath the logo indicated that the bed-rest was “hair-filled,” which I assume was horse hair, still used today in some luxury brands…\n\n…if de Wolfe was queen of interior designers, then Hattie Carnegie was the “First Lady of Fashion,” or so this ad claimed…\n\n…here are images of the two titans of fashion and good taste…\n\n…and speaking of fashion, here is a llama cloth coat from B. Altman, trimmed in silver raccoon, suitable for Yale football games…based on inflation, that coat today would set you back at least $2,000…\n\n…this condescending ad offered merchants a way to reach the “hitherto strange and aloof women of New York” through daytime advertising…\n\n…Plymouth enlisted the talents of Alan Dunn to tout their car’s ride and durability…\n\n…and on to our cartoonists, another from Dunn, a bit of spot art featuring a not so subtle commentary on Lawrence Lee Bazley Angas’s book The Coming American Boom…\n\n…and some spot art from Isadore Klein…\n\n…Miguel Covarrubias contributed to the theater review section…\n\n…James Thurber entertained a house guest…\n\n…George Price was still up in the air…\n\n…Helen Hokinson took a spin with a celebrity look-alike…\n\n…and Barbara Shermund offered another glimpse into the life of a modern woman…\n\n…on to Oct. 20, 1934…\n\n…in which E.B. White offered up a new lament, namely the pervasiveness of nostalgia and sentiment in contemporary literature…\n\n* * *\n\nFifty Years Young\n\n“The Talk of the Town” marked the Dakota’s 50th year at Central Park West, and made note of its loyal and prominent clientele…back in the day it served as a residence for actors such as Lillian Gish, Boris Karloff, and Teresa Wright, and in later years such luminaries as Lauren Bacall, Judy Garland, Rudolf Nureyev, and, of course, John Lennon and Yoko Ono.\n\n* * *\n\nMore From Our Advertisers\n\nThe Matson-Oceanic Line offered a “millionaire’s idea of a vacation” at an affordable price, and offered this sumptuous image as proof…\n\n…E.B. White wasn’t crazy about the smokeless dazzle of the Rainbow Room, but it proved to be popular among the city’s elite…\n\n…in case one was concerned about the provenance of one’s mink coat, Saks posted this helpful ad. Their high-end, natural-skin minks were priced at $8,000 (roughly $180,000 today); there was, however, a caveat regarding the cheaper models…\n\n…Bergdorf Goodman offered up another ad featuring an impossibly attenuated model posed with a cigarette, her defiant gaze suggesting her modernity and individualism…\n\n…Plymouth went back to the stable of New Yorker cartoonists, this time featuring the adventures of Helen Hokinson’s “girls”…\n\n…and we segue to the rest of our cartoonists, including this spot by Constantin Alajalov…\n\n…and this by George Price…\n\n…who also gave us another update on the trials and tribulations of his floating man…\n\n… James Thurber occasionally ignored scale in rendering his characters, which didn’t really matter in his strange world…\n\n…Jack Markow had some bad news for two sign painters (the caption size is increased for readability)…\n\n…and we close with Peter Arno, and the winner of most original Halloween costume…\n\n…and before I go…this is being posted on Halloween, 2023, so here are a few images from 1934 to get you in the spirit, including a Saturday Evening Post cover, a 1934 party ideas magazine, and a page from Popular Mechanics featuring a smoking robot costume you could make yourself…in the 1930s, Popular Mechanics often featured Halloween party ideas that were downright lethal, usually involving electric shocks, pistols loaded with blanks, that sort of thing.\n\nHappy Halloween!\n\nNext Time: House & Home…\n\nLunch at the Dog Wagon\n\nIf you think today’s food trailers are the result of some hipster craze, consider that their origins go back more than a century; by 1934 Manhattan was home to 300 of the country’s 5,000 “lunch wagons,” which were commonly called “dog wagons.”\n\nSome of Manhattan’s dog wagons belied the moniker, however, resembling the sleek roadside diners over which many today wax nostalgic. Jerry O’Mahony Diner Company of Elizabeth, New Jersey, produced more of these dining cars than any other concern—2,000 of them between 1917 and 1952 (only about twenty remain today). “The Talk of the Town” had this to say about the dog wagon phenomenon. Excerpts:\n\n* * *\n\nA Captain’s Curios\n\n“The Talk of the Town” also paid a visit to Captain Charley’s Private Museum for Intelligent People, a place that would later be visited (and written about) by The New Yorker’s chronicler of the commonplace, Joseph Mitchell. Excerpts:\n\n* * *\n\nOrigins of Life\n\nWolcott Gibbs took his turn as theater reviewer (in relief of Robert Benchley) and managed to sit through Life Begins at 8:40, which had a successful run at the Winter Garden.\n\nIn contrast to Bert Lahr’s new toned-down style, Milton Berle’s outlandish antics over at the Imperial Theatre had Gibbs wondering what the comedian’s vaudeville-style show Saluta was all about, if it was about anything. Whatever it was, it worked—Berle would enjoy a comedy career spanning eight decades, including becoming one of early television’s biggest stars.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWe begin with a cold one from Rheingold, which had “beverage balance” and wasn’t afraid to stamp a slogan right over its ad copy…\n\n…Lucky Strike gave us another stylish reason for taking up a bad habit…\n\n…Arts & Decoration magazine took out this full page to tout the latest news in modern design…\n\n…while the folks at Packard bought this center spread to give ample space to their 1935 model, which must have been a helluva thing to parallel park…\n\n…clothing companies continued use class shaming to goad aspiring toffs to purchase the “correct” attire for school…\n\n…with the help of Gardner Rea, Heinz suggested that the upper orders would simply swoon over cuisine you managed to scoop out of a can…\n\n…on to our cartoonists, we begin with spots by James Thurber…\n\n…and Lloyd Coe…\n\n…with the absence of Otto Soglow’s Little King, Gluyas Williams did his best to fill the void of a full page, something Williams did quite nicely…\n\n…Rea Irvin gave us yet another local bird sighting…\n\n…Richard Decker found understatement over a reservoir…\n\n…Robert Day borrowed from the style of Rockwell Kent to offer a bit of humor from the northern climes…\n\n…here is a woodcut from Kent’s N by E is, an illustrated story of his voyage to Greenland…\n\n…Reginald Marsh lent his social realism to an uglier side of American life…\n\n…and we close with Helen Hokinson, just taking in the passing scene…\n\nNext Time: Sticks and Stones…\n\nUp In The Air\n\nThe 1930s saw steady improvements in the fledging airline industry, which catered mostly to major businesses or well-heeled (and somewhat brave) folks who were interested in getting to places relatively quickly. Margaret Case Harriman reported on the many ways one could criss-cross the country by heading to the Newark Airport, the first major airport to serve the New York metro.\n\nWriting for the “Out of Town” column, Harriman described how someone in 1934 could make their way to Los Angeles by boarding a 9 a.m. American Airlines flight in Newark and then changing over to a “sleeper plane” in Fort Worth around 10 p.m. that same day (top speed of the fastest plane was about 190 mph or 306 kph. The trip also required stops for refueling). The night flight from Fort Worth would deliver the traveler to Los Angeles the following day, at 7:55 a.m.—the trip totaled about 23 hours.\n\nWhen we think of flying in the 1930s many of us recall the great travel posters featuring Pan American’s Clipper Ships—flying boats that took passengers to exotic locations in the Caribbean and in Central and South America. Harriman wrote:\n\nHarriman closed with some advice to readers unfamiliar with flying, including putting drops of Argyrol (a silver-protein antiseptic) into ones eyes to “prevent that ticking sensation in the temples.”\n\n* * *\n\nNo Offense Taken\n\nCritic John Mosher was no fan of Jean Harlow’s, but he did acknowledge her box office appeal, and that fans eagerly awaited the Blonde Bombshell’s next picture, The Girl from Missouri…with its “usual plot of a gold-digger and millionaries.” Mosher also noted that Harlow, along with Mae West, was a prime target of reformers (see Hays Code) who wanted to ban “immorality” from the pictures, and he was eager to see how the Puritans had wielded their new censoring shears on the film.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWe begin with another ad from the makers of Spud menthol cigarettes, who deployed what seemed like every known visual metaphor to suggest that smoking their cigarettes “all day” would leave one feeling cool, clean and fresh, in this case as a blanket of newly fallen snow (an appealing sight in that hot summer of 1934)…\n\n…R.J. Reynolds deployed any number of tricks to sell their Camels, from ads promoting their health benefits to endorsements by wealthy socialites, in this case Sarah Lippincott (“Mrs. Nicholas Biddle”) of Philadelphia…\n\n…snob appeal was not limited to cigarette ads, as this full page from the folks at Chevrolet attests…\n\n…zooming in on the copy that accompanied the above ad, we find that this fictive Chevy owner was a “marked woman” sought out by paparazzi and admired by couturiers…\n\n…Dr. Seuss continued his series of weird ads for Flit insecticide…\n\n…Helen Hokinson illustrated this patrician picnic scene to promote Heinz’s line of sandwich spreads…\n\n…and we kick off our cartoons with Helen again, observing a proud moment…\n\n…Robert Day offered this observation on modern architecture…\n\n…Rea Irvin skewered the puritan set with his latest bird illustration…\n\n…William Steig’s precocious “Small Fry” visited Coney Island…\n\n…and we close with E. Simms Campbell, and a sly introduction…\n\nNext Time: Dizzy Drinks…\n\nHis Five Cent’s Worth\n\nAbove: Final Design of Grand Central Terminal, ca. 1910. (New York Transit Museum)\n\nThe heat wave of 1934 spread misery from the Midwest to the East Coast. The temperature in New York City hit 101 degrees F (38.3 C) on June 29, and July recorded at least ten days of temps in the mid- to upper 90s. It must have been miserable in the days before air-conditioning, and since no adult would dare be seen in public wearing shorts and a t-shirt, an outing on a crowded tour boat, as illustrated below by William Cotton, must have been hellish.\n\n…putting a fine point on it, recall this wryly captioned cartoon from the June 30 issue by Garrett Price…\n\n…but let us move ahead to the July 28 issue, where E.B. White was hopefully keeping his cool in the men’s waiting room at Grand Central Station, where he plunked down a nickel to cool his heels in the “middle class” section, where he observed side attractions including a vending machine that dispensed handkerchiefs and a coin-operated peep show featuring burlesque star Sally Rand.\n\n…White referred to a peep show that featured famed fan dancer Sally Rand…\n\nWhite also commented on the growing number of travelers, still pinched by the Depression, opting for the free section:\n\nWe settle in with the June 21 issue (which leads this post) with White once again, this time enjoying a drive to Stamford, Conn., where he admired the “splendor” of the Condé Nast printing plant (apparently the plant also printed The New Yorker, although the magazine itself would not be acquired by Condé Nast’s parent company, Advance Publications, until 1985).\n\n* * *\n\nDisney’s Other Mouse\n\nFilm critic John Mosher was a fan of Disney’s “Silly Symphony” cartoon shorts, which were produced between 1929 and 1939. Animation, and especially color animation, was in its infancy, so these doubtless had an uplifting effect on many moviegoers.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Great McGonigle\n\nW.C. Fields appeared in more than a dozen silent films before making his first talkie, 1930’s The Golf Specialist, and it was in sound films that Fields was able to truly express his vaudevillian wit. It was also in the sound era that Fields teamed up with Baby LeRoy for three films (in 1933 and 1934), including The Old Fashioned Way, in which Fields portrayed “The Great McGonigle,” leader of a traveling (and perpetually underfunded) theater troupe who was always a step ahead of police and creditors. Critic John Mosher found the film’s riff on an old morality play, The Drunkard, to be a bit dated, but overall thought it a cheerful diversion.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWe begin with scientific proof (from a “famous research laboratory in New York”) that Camel cigarettes increased one’s flow of energy…\n\n…if that crackpot claim doesn’t get you, here’s one that recommended downing a PBR before a big meeting, a sure remedy for that “listless, tired-out feeling”…\n\n…of course we all know that a few sugary Cokes will get you going…back then they were taking it in six- and ten-ounce bottles, not 30- to 50-ounce Big Gulps…\n\n…it’s not every day you see a dog food ad in The New Yorker…in the 1930s there was no secret to where ol’ Sparky ended up…\n\n…popular were these Rockwellian ads that equated various products with happy and wholesome (and safe) living, in this case a massive “Dual-Balloon” tire that dominated this tableau featuring a stylish mommy and her little boy slumming with an old sea salt…\n\n…the folks at Essex House hired an illustrator who did his or her best to channel Helen Hokinson and William Steig for this New Yorker ad…as we have seen before, Essex House ads walked a fine line between thrift and snob appeal…\n\n…on to our cartoons, beginning with Ned Hilton, whose work appeared in The New Yorker from 1934 to 1957…\n\n…Mary Petty recorded some sweet nothings by the seaside…\n\n…George Price drifted along with two men and tuba…\n\n…Carl Rose revealed a modest side to life at a nudist colony…\n\n…we know Clarence Day for his Life With Father series, but on occasion he also contributed illustrated poems such as this one from the July 21 issue…\n\n…on to July 28…\n\n…where we encounter more “scientific research” that encouraged folks to smoke…This ad was placed on the very last page of the July 28 issue by the Cigarette Research Institute, based in Louisville, Kentucky…\n\n…the booklet was filled with “amazing facts” uncovered in a “scientific investigation,” facts did not address the health effects of smoking, but rather such important topics as how to hold a cigarette the right way and how to reduce staining on your teeth…it also helpfully debunked the notion that nicotine was a “dread demon”…\n\n…take for example this woman smoking a Lucky…now she knew how to hold a cigarette!…\n\n…the folks at Essex House were back, aggressively playing the class/caste card…apparently if you lived there you were entitled to kick your old friends to the curb…\n\n…the antacid and pain reliever Bromo-Seltzer was ubiquitous in 1930s medicine cabinets, but after the recipe was changed in the 1970s (all Bromides were withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1975) the brand slowly fizzled away…\n\n…Mildred Oppenheim Melisse was a popular illustrator of ads for department stores and various household goods, including Cannon towels, here guaranteed to absorb even this man’s sweaty “flood”…\n\n…Dr. Seuss back again for Flit, once again having no issues mixing insecticide with food preparation…\n\n…Rea Irvin kicks off the cartoons with his Double Breasted Dowager…\n\n…Helen Hokinson found some misplaced pity at a garden party…\n\n…Garrett Price offered some unsolicited advice…\n\n…Reginald Marsh filled two pages with a scene from Central Park…\n\n…Robert Day looked for a unique experience at an auto camp…\n\n…and we close with Barbara Shermund, and some alarming news on the domestic front…\n\nNext Time: Men of Mystery…\n\nThe Happy Warrior\n\nAbove: Al Smith waving to crowds on arrival at Chattanooga, Tennessee during his presidential campaign in 1928. (Museum of the City of New York)\n\nIt’s hard to not like Al Smith, the governor of New York from 1923 to 1928, a man who avoided the temptations of political power and stayed true to his working class roots of the Lower East Side.\n\nThe son of Irish, Italian and German immigrants, Alfred Emanuel Smith (1873–1944) was raised in the Tammany Hall-dominated Fourth Ward, and although he was indebted to Tammany’s political machine throughout much of his professional life (including stints in the New York State Assembly and as York County Sheriff, President of the Board of Alderman, and finally Governor) he remained untarnished by corruption. Smith’s unsuccessful bid for the U.S. presidency in 1928 put an end to his political life, but there was still much to do, as “The Talk of the Town” explained:\n\nSmith first sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1924. According to historian Robert Slayton, Smith advanced the cause of civil liberty by decrying lynching and racial violence at the 1924 Democratic National Convention, where Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered the nominating speech for Smith and saluted him as “the Happy Warrior of the political battlefield.”\n\nFollowing his 1928 presidential election loss to Herbert Hoover, Smith became president of Empire State, Inc., the corporation that built and also operated the Empire State Building, which was then the tallest building in the world. Smith was also known for his fondness of animals, and in 1934 Parks Commissioner Robert Moses made Smith “Honorary Night Zookeeper” of the renovated Central Park Zoo. Smith was given keys to the zoo and often took guests to see the animals after hours. According to Rebekah Burgess of the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation, “As a resident of 820 Fifth Avenue, directly across the street from the entrance of the Central Park Zoo, Smith was known to appear with snacks for the animals or to launch into impromptu lectures for visitors. Al Smith took his honorary title to heart. Throughout the rest of his life, Smith could often be found attending to the animals at the zookeepers’ sides during open hours. At night, Smith visited with guests, or more often, one-on-one with the animals.”\n\nSmith was also a humanitarian, and in addition to advocating for the working class, he was an early critic of the Nazi regime in Germany, vigorously supporting the Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933.

(dorchestercollection.com)\n\nLois Long took her nightlife column, “Tables for Two,” to London and its famed nightclub scene, where everyone from British royalty to gangsters reveled in a boozy, bohemian scene.\n\nPrince Edward, a well-known party animal (who would serve as king for less than a year and abdicate in 1936) was known to get up on the stage of the Embassy Club and perform drum solos, while at the Savoy his fellow toffs would sip Champagne and glide in elegant dress across the dance floor. London nightlife included a lively jazz scene in edgy Soho basement clubs, featuring such greats as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie.\n\nLong hoped that the visit to London, her first in eight years, would give her some much-needed rest and a change of scene. What she found instead was a red-hot, all-night party, where the smart set took dinner near midnight and danced until dawn.\n\n* * *\n\nMisery Loves Company\n\nIn his “Notes and Comment,” E.B. White observed that almost everyone was “made miserable” by the Depression, but if one looked around there were signs that things weren’t so bad after all.\n\n* * *\n\nHe Came Up a Bit Short\n\nHoward Brubaker, in his column “Of All Things,” made this observation about Adolf Hitler’s prediction that Nazism would endure a thousand years.\n\nAnd now a retreat into the cool darkness of the cinema, where John Mosher singled out Bette Davis’s performance in Of Human Bondage…Mosher’s instincts were correct—the film proved to be Davis’s breakout role on her road to major stardom.\n\nMosher also took in the “bright” performances of William Powell and Myrna Loy in The Thin Man, a pre-Code comedy-mystery based on the Dashiell Hammett novel by the same name. Powell and Loy portrayed Nick and Nora Charles, who added spice to their leisurely lives through numerous cocktails, flirtatious banter, and crime-solving. Critics loved the film, as did audiences, spawning five sequels from 1936 to 1947.\n\nAnother star of the show was Asta, the Charles’s wire fox terrier. Asta was portrayed by Skippy, a dog actor who not only appeared in The Thin Man films but also acted alongside Cary Grant in 1937’s The Awful Truth and in 1938’s Bringing Up Baby. Skippy appeared in three Thin Man movies and in more than twenty films altogether between 1932 and 1941. Being an actor in the film must have been good for one’s health: Powell lived 91 years, Loy 88 years, and Skippy, 20 years—a good long life for any pooch.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWhile Chrysler’s styling of their streamlined Airflow proved to be too far advanced for the buying public (the Depression didn’t help), Studebaker’s own foray into the streamlined future caused a sensation…\n\n…thanks to Studebaker’s brief merger with Pierce-Arrow (1928–33), Studebaker’s designers took cues from Pierce’s streamlined 1933 Silver Arrow and created more than 800 cars with “Year-Ahead” design features—the positive reception convinced the company to continue the style in 1935…here is a top-of-the-line 1934 President Land Cruiser…\n\nand the car that inspired it…\n\n…we continue with those round rubber things that held the cars up…a lot of tire ads in the 1930s emphasized safety—blowouts were common back then…funny how it took nearly four decades to add seat belts to cars…those tires wouldn’t help much in a head-on collision, especially with your kid standing on the from seat…\n\n…now let’s cool off with crisp Canadian Ale, thanks to Carling’s entry into the American market…\n\n…Carling’s Black Label beer was popular in the states…my parents had a set of these coasters with the Black Label tagline…\n\n…Budweiser continued its artful series of ads featuring the well-heeled enjoying its product…here it appears old dad (wearing some kind of medal) is getting to know his daughter-in-law over some cold chicken…”hey boy, she’s one of us!”…\n\n…and we move on to three very different approaches to selling cigarettes, beginning with Spud, continuing its message that menthol cigarettes are as refreshing as a shower on a July afternoon…\n\n…a close up of the message…\n\n…Camel, on the other hand, continued its campaign against irritability…it apparently did wonders for this woman, who seems to be on something more than nicotine…\n\n…and from the people who brought us the tagline “blow some my way” in 1928 (as a way to encourage women to take up the habit), by 1934 she is owning that cigarette, and apparently setting some ground rules with the gentleman…\n\n…contrast with the more submissive pose in the Chesterfield ad from the late 1920s…\n\n…on to our cartoons, we begin with spot art by Alan Dunn, which appears to have originated as a captioned cartoon…\n\n…William Steig offered up this bit of art for a profile of an “insurance man” by St. Clair McKelway…\n\n…Helen Hokinson drew up a full page of cartoons along the theme of outdoor dining…\n\n…we continue Rea Irvin’s series on native birds…\n\n…George Price found a way to save on the cost of light bulbs…\n\n…and we close with James Thurber, and a welcome to the family…\n\nNext Time: The Happy Warrior…"
