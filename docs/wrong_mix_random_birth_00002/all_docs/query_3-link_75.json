The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 3 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 3 FOREWORD2015 was a an interesting year for Judy Garland fans. Auctions were big news again, with some great Garland items on the block. Auctions have become more popular than ever as collectors and fans sell off parts or all of their collections. It’s big business, too, what with the high prices that some items are sold for making the film memorabilia market quite lucrative for auction houses. There were some anniversaries in 2015 that are well worth noting, anniversaries of milestones in Judy’s career and in the home media market They’re included here. In the world of home media there weren’t as many major Garland releases as we’ve been used to in the past. But there were still some releases to get excited about. The U.S. release of the 2014 “Swan Songs, First Flights” 3-CD set is worth noting. As is Judy’s return to vinyl with three LP reissues. My new blog series “The Judy Garland Wars - or - How I survived the wacky world of Judy Garland Fandom” premiered on March 2nd at The Judy Garland News & Events blog. The series is a semi-satirical look at my observations and experiences ever since becoming a part of the online “community” in 1995. I had hoped to get a new chapter out each month, but that didn’t pan out. One of my goals for 2016 is to get a new chapter out every month or two. 2016 will most likely be another good year for Garland collecting and for Garland related events. We have the “Judy Sings Harold Arlen” 2-CD set to look forward to, with its release of the previously lost complete version of “Lose That Long Face” from A Star Is Born. So, here’s to a great year for collectors, fans, and admirers of the woman still considered The World’s Greatest Entertainer! Sincerely, Scott Brogan The Judy Room\n\n4. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 4 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments 4The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review ANNIVERSARIES Anniversaries and milestones are usually celebrated in five year increments. A good example are the 70th and 75th anniversaries of The Wizard of Oz as celebrated by Warner Bros. and Warner Home Video. You can bet they’ll re-release that Blu-ray boxed set again, with new collectibles, when the 80th anniversary comes around. This section of The Judy Room’s 2015 Year in Review focuses on some of the important milestone anniversaries of 2015. Enjoy!\n\n5. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 5 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 5 1935 - 80 years ago 1935 was a major milestone year for Judy. There were two main events that would shape her future forever: Her audition and first contract with MGM; and the death of her father, Frank Gumm. Even with that tragic event, there is much to celebrate. Take a look. March 29th: Judy’s first studio recordings. 12-year-old Judy cut three test records for Decca Records, one with her sisters, “Moonglow,” and two solos: “Bill” and a medley of “On The Good Ship Lollipop/The Object of My Affection/Dinah.” All three with mother Ethel accompanying them on the piano. The tests were rejected and thought lost for over 70 years when the two solos were discovered and released on the 2010 4-CD set “Judy Garland Lost Tracks 1929-1959.” The recordings were remastered and re-released in 2015 on the CD “Judy Garland The Best of Lost Tracks 1929-1959.” Details of that release on page 38. “Moonglow” is still lost. These are the only surviving recordings of Judy as she sounded before she signed with MGM and was tutored by Roger Edens. They’re a revelation. Judy is lacking a little polish, but it’s all there: The vibrato, the energy, that gorgeous tone. It’s no wonder that when she auditioned at MGM that September, everyone went wild! After that audition, Judy made two more tests for Decca on November 27th: “All’s Well” and “No Other One.” Those were rejected as well and are still lost. The photo at the far right is Judy in Chicago in 1934 posting as she did when singing “Bill” as part of the Garland Sisters’ act. Above is the label of the Decca test record of “Bill.” continued\n\n6. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 6 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 6 1935 - 80 years ago March 7th to 13th: Judy and her sisters, as “The Garland Sisters,” appeared at the Paramount Theater in Los Angeles, California. They were earning $110 a week at the time, quite a sum in the middle of the Depression. They also earned their fifth review in “Variety” which raved about Frances (Judy). The reason this event is listed here is because it resulted in the only known photograph of the sisters in performance on stage and of a theater marquee featuring “The Garland Sisters.” Later that summer, on August 12th, the sisters made their last appearance on film which was also their last professional appearance as a trio. They were on location in Santa Barbara filming the short subject La Fiesta de Santa Barbara in which they sang “La Cucaracha.” The Technicolor short was Judy’s first appearance in a color film and first MGM film, predating her audition with the studio by one month. The film was independently produced but released by MGM as an MGM short. It’s also Judy’s only color film until The Wizard of Oz four years later.

The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 7 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 7 September 13th: Judy successfully auditioned for MGM. She sang “Zing! Went The Strings Of My Heart” and “Eili, Eili.” Judy’s father, Frank Gumm, took her to the audition because mom Ethel was on an errand when the call came in. Frank took Judy “as is” without making her up as Ethel would have done. Judy’s soon-to-be musical mentor Roger Edens took over on the piano after Frank’s abilities proved to be negligible. Edens later said he knew within a few bars of music that Judy was a one-of-a-kind major talent. September 16th: MGM ordered its legal department to prepare a standard seven year contract for Judy to commence on October 1st. Judy would be paid $100 per week, with options every six month to renew or be let go for the first year, then once a year for the next six. The contract was approved on September 27th at the Los Angeles Superior Court. Judy was a minor so Frank and Ethel accompanied her to the courthouse to sign the papers. An MGM photographer took the first official studio photo of Judy at this event, the photo is shown at left. Judy spent her first weeks working with Roger Edens on her vocal style. She sang at the half time of a USC football game at the Los Angeles Coliseum. While singing “Fight on for Good Old USC” she was interrupted midway through the song when the team raced out early and the cheering crowd drowned out her voice. Some sources have this event taking place at USC and not the Coliseum. October 26th was Judy’s national radio debut on the NBC Radio show “The Shell Chateau Hour” hosted by MGM star Wallace Beery. Although she was thirteen Beery gave her age as twelve. She sang “Broadway Rhythm.” A recording of this performance survives and can be downloaded here. Photo above: Judy on her way to MGM in October 1935. 1935 - 80 years ago continued\n\n8. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 8 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 8 November 17th: Judy’s father, Frank Gumm, died of spinal meningitis. The previous night, November 16th, Judy made her second appearance on the NBC Radio show “The Shell Chateau Hour.” Host Wallace Berry told the audience that because of her appearance on the show in October she was signed to a contract with MGM. The MGM myth-making publicity machine was already spinning tales about Judy, as they did for all of their stars. Before the performance, Judy was told that Frank would be listening from his hospital bed. She sang a very heartfelt “Zing! Went The Strings Of My Heart.” Instead of going to Frank’s hospital bedside MGM whisked Judy to the La Monica Ballroom in Santa Monica. She was not present when her father passed. This performance was also recorded and can be downloaded here. It’s the earliest known recording of Judy singing what was not only her audition song for the studio but also a staple of her live performances for the rest of her live. Frank’s death was, as Judy’s later noted, “the most terrible thing that ever happened to me in my life.” Judy felt that Frank was the only person from whom she received unconditional love and support. It left a huge hole that some speculate never completely healed. Most likely they’re right. Surely her life at MGM would have been different if Frank had lived and been able to stand up for her once her schedule became grueling and detrimental to her health.

Photo at right: A shot from Judy’s first studio portrait session at MGM. Some sources state that this took place on November 6th while others place it as having taken place on “mid-November” after Frank’s death. 1935 - 80 years ago continued\n\n9. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 9 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 9 1945 - Hollywood’s Golden Girl The big anniversary in 1945 is Judy’s June 15th marriage to Vincente Minnelli. He had guided her through Meet Me In St. Louis in 1943/44, still a big hit in 1945, her guest appearance in Ziegfeld Follies (released in 1946), and her first solely dramatic role in The Clock. It premiered on May 25th. The marriage is worth noting for two reasons: 1) Minnelli was, at least in the beginning, a calming influence on Judy and the right man for her at that time. Their collaborations brought out the best in her on screen. 2) The union gave us Liza! Judy’s first child, Liza Minnelli, was born March 12, 1946. Judy was pregnant with Liza while filming her guest spot in Till The Clouds Roll By in late 1945. Her guest appearance was directed by her husband, Vincente, of course. Judy is glowing and radiant in her numbers and scenes, displaying a confidence and total command of her talents that only a star of her caliber could display. Judy was truly Hollywood’s “Golden Girl” who not only could do it all but also seemed to have it all. continued\n\n10. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 10 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 10 1950 began in turmoil for Judy. She was in the final months of filming Summer Stock which was a difficult shoot. She finished the film in February then came back on March 15th to pre-record “Get Happy” which was a last minute “payoff” number that the film needed for its “show within a show” finale section. Judy was trimmer than in the rest of the film and audiences immediately thought the number was an outtake from an earlier film. It wasn’t. When the film opened in August, it was after her much publicized suicide attempt on June 19th. In the interim, Judy had gone on a vacation after completing Summer Stock but was called back to the studio to replace June Allyson in Royal Wedding. It was too much for her. Although this wasn’t her first suicide attempt, it was the first to make headlines. Contrary to what MGM assumed, the news only endeared Judy to the public more than before. The public and the critics showered praise on Judy’s performance in the film, proving that they loved her regardless of her personal issues. Judy and MGM mutually parted ways on September 29th, just a tad over fifteen years after her audition in 1935. The studio had actually been considering keeping Judy under contract in spite of the recent drama. She was still trending as popular and Summer Stock was a hit. It’s a testament to her talent and the love of her audiences that after all that came before in 1950 she was still one of the studio’s biggest stars. Thanks to his kindness of heart Bing Crosby re-presented Judy publicly on his radio show several times in late 1950. She dazzled with her full throated “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody.” The song became a showstopper in her concerts for the rest of her life. Judy completed the year performing the role of “Alice Adams” in the play of the same name on the NBC Radio show “The Theater Guild On The Air” and recreating her role of “Dorothy” in the radio adaptation of The Wizard of Oz on Christmas day. 1950 - A Time Of Change 1950 was a turning point for Judy. She gave us the iconic “Get Happy,” a number that still inspires performers today. It was also the year in which she left MGM seemingly a “has-been.” Nothing could be further from the truth! continued\n\n11. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 11 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 11 2015 was the 60th anniversary of two milestones in Judy’s career: Her first album for Capitol Records (and her first official studio “album” of the LP era), “Miss Show Business” and her very first television appearance, the 90 minute special premiering CBS-TV’s new program “The Ford Star Jubilee.” The TV special aired on September 24, 1955 from 9:30 - 11:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time “live” and in color. It was broadcast in kinescope on the West Coast. A black and white kinescope survives and has been available on videotape and DVD. It’s the only filmed record of Judy singing “Over the Rainbow” as she sang it in concert. The Capitol album was released two days after the broadcast on September 26th and was a soundtrack of sorts to the special, with most of the songs on the LP having been featured in the show. All are studio recordings made on August 25th, 29th, & 30th and September 1st and 2nd. The album was re-released in 2015 in both vinyl (see page 39) and HD Digital (see page 40). The HD Digital version is remastered and sounds better than ever. The vinyl was also remastered and sounds good although not as great as the HD remaster.

The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 12 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 12 Another turning point year of milestones, 1960 set Judy on the path to incredible success and adoration as the biggest star on the planet. She really was “The World’s Greatest Entertainer” and a true living legend. 1960 began with Judy recuperating from her bout with hepatitis. She was released from Doctor’s Hospital in New York on January 5th and returned home to California to rest. Just a few days prior she had signed a contract with Random House to write her autobiography, collaborating with Fred Finklehoffe. Finklehoffe had written the screenplays for some of Judy’s best films, including Meet Me In St. Louis and For Me And My Gal. By late spring Judy proved the doctors wrong in their prognosis that she would “never work again.” It was the beginning of her early 1960s renaissance. In April her first work after release from the hospital was to record the song “The Far Away Part Of Town” for the Columbia film Pepe. Judy didn’t appear in the film. Her vocal was used for a dance scene featuring Shirley Jones and Dan Dailey. It was nominated for the Oscar for “Best Song.” On June 8, 1960 Judy began work on her next Capitol album, “Judy: That’s Entertainment!” with the recording of “How Long Has This Been Going On?”; “Yes”; and “It Never Was You.” The next day Judy recorded “If I Love Again”; “Who Cares?”’ “Puttin’ On The Ritz”; “Just You, Just Me”’ and “Down With Love.” On June 17th Judy completed album by recording “That’s Entertainment!”; “Old Devil Moon”; “I’ve Confessed To The Breeze”; and “Alone Together.” 1960 - New Beginnings continued\n\n13. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 13 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 13 The album was released on October 31st and is considered by most to be one of her very best albums. Many list it as their all-time favorite. Judy’s rest period gave her voice a chance to relax and you can certainly hear it on this album. Judy was seen very healthy and happy that summer when she performed at a Democratic fund raiser for her friend John F. Kennedy (footage of this appearance still exists) before going to London where she would be in the recording studio again, this time recording what would become known as “The London Sessions.” On August 2nd at 7 p.m., Judy arrived at the EMI studios in London for the first of five sessions for a planned two-record set presenting many of her greatest hits recorded in stereo for the first time. On this date she recorded: “Chicago”; “Do It Again”; “Lucky Day”; and “Stormy Weather.” Conducted by Norrie Paramour, the recording sessions were nothing less than electric. As with the recording of “Judy: That’s Entertainment!” Judy was happy, healthy, and in phenomenal voice. On August 3rd she recorded: “I Happen To Like New York”; “Swanee”; “You’ll Never Walk Alone”; and “Why Was I Born?” August 4th: “The Man That Got Away”; “Come Rain Or Come Shine”; “San Francisco”; and “Over The Rainbow.” August 5th: “Medley: You Made Me Love You/ For Me And My Gal/The Trolley Song”; “You Go To My Head”; “Happiness Is A Thing Called Joe”; and “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody.” August 8th: “Judy At The Palace” medley; “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love”; “After You’ve Gone”; “It’s A Great Day For The Irish.” The tracks were held for release first due to the recent release of the “That’s Entertainment!” album, and then due to the incredible success of the label’s recording of Judy’s historic concert at New York’s Carnegie Hall. That concert was even more electric than these recording sessions and included many of the same songs as these sessions. In 1962 Capitol released a compilation album titled “The Garland Touch” that included, without explanation, six of “London Sessions” tracks: “Lucky Day”; “I Happen To Like New York”; “Judy At The Palace” medley; “Happiness Is A Thing Called Joe”; “You’ll Never Walk Alone”; and “It’s A Great Day For The Irish.” Some fans initially thought the recordings might have been from the Carnegie Hall concert without the applause, maybe from a different night. 1960 - New Beginnings continued\n\n14. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 14 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 14 All of the tracks were released on a two record set titled “Judy in London” released by the Capitol Records Club in 1972. That release was not a general release being available to club members only. The same holds true for the 1978 “special markets” release of the tracks, also titled “Judy in London.” In 1991 Capitol finally released the complete album to the general public as the third CD of their deluxe 3-CD boxed set “Judy Garland: The One And Only.” They were newly remastered and were such a hit that in 1992 Capitol released them as a stand-alone CD titled the same as they had been in the boxed set: “The London Sessions.” Some of the recordings would be included in a few compilations as well as some previously unreleased alternate takes. Alternates of “Happiness Is A Thing Called Joe” and “Why Was I Born?” were first released on June 27, 2006 on the Capitol Records single CD “The Essential Judy Garland.” Alternates of “Stormy Weather” and “Over The Rainbow” premiered on the February 20, 2007 EMI Records Ltd. 3-CD set “The Very Best Of Judy Garland: The Capitol Recordings 1955 - 1965.” All of these alternates were remastered and included on the October 11, 2011 First Hand Records deluxe 2-CD set “The London Studio Recordings 1957 - 1964.” As an added bonus, that release premiered additional alternates of: “Stormy Weather” and “Why Was I Born?” as well as previously unreleased alternates of “Lucky Day”; “After You’ve Gone”; “It’s A Great Day For The Irish”; and “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” If you’re looking for the most complete representation of “The London Sessions” as well as all of Judy’s other recordings made at the Capitol/EMI Studios in London, then this First Hand 1960 - New Beginnings continued\n\n15. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 15 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 15 Records release is what you want. The other two releases from 2006 and 2007 are fantastic compilations as well that both feature other treasures. Not one to keep still for very long, Judy followed those August 1960 recording sessions with her very first two-act solo concert on August 28, 1960 at the London Palladium. This was the first known, two-act, solo, one-woman concert by a female pop vocalist. While it’s a format that seems standard today, it was groundbreaking at the time. Judy came up with the program of songs herself, remarking in 1962, “I figured out my program myself on the inside of a pack of matches.” She also selected her clothes and allegedly even helped design the lighting. This concert is also notable as it’s the beginning of Judy’s legendary 1960/1961 concert tour, the apex of which was her appearance at Carnegie Hall in 1961, thankfully recorded and preserved by Capitol Records. It’s hard to believe that just eight months prior she was told she’d never work again. Talk about the strength of recuperative powers! Judy reprised her new show at the Palladium on September 4th, then took it to The Palais de Chaillot in Paris for two nights (October 5th & 7th), then back to England for an October 16th engagement at The Leeds Odeon Theater in Leeds, then The Birmingham Odeon Theater in Birmingham on October 23rd followed by a quick jaunt to Wiesbaden, Germany on October 26th for the “Koncert For Kennedy” (her friend again, John F. Kennedy). Whew! Hopscotching around Europe, Judy appeared at: The Olympia Theater, Paris, France (October 28th & 29th - the 28th concert was recorded for radio broadcast released on the November 23, 1994 CD “Judy Garland à Paris” re-released in 2005); Frankfurt, Germany (November, two concerts, locations and dates unknown); The De Montford Hall, Leister, England (November 15th); The London Palladium (The Royal Variety Show, December 1st); The Free Trade Hall, Manchester, England (December 4th); The Tuschinski Theater, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (December 10th, broadcast and issued on budget LPs in the 1970s and 80s then on CD in 1996 then remastered and re-released on November 12, 2012 by First Hand Records as “The Amsterdam Concert December 1960”). Judy spent the rest of the year in London with her family. She signed a new contract with Freddie Fields Associates to manage her career and spent time socializing while the press linked her name to various projects. In the next several years Judy achieved a level of success and a varied body of work arguably unmatched in show business history. 1960 - New Beginnings continued\n\n16. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 16 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 16 There have been quite a few Judy Garland “after life career” milestones. “After life career” means highlights that happened after Judy passed away in 1969. Almost immediately after her death various projects celebrating her or immortalizing were announced, including several biographies. In 1974 MGM released That’s Entertainment! a surprise hit documentary film celebrating the golden age of MGM musicals. Of course, Judy was front and center. Its enormous success surprised everyone and did much to bring renewed interest to Judy’s film career. A sequel, That’s Entertainment Part 2, followed in 1996. The movies reminded film goers of Judy’s amazing film achievements while introducing her to their children and grandchildren. The soundtrack albums for the films were also extremely popular. Those albums complemented the special two-record sets that MGM Records had begun reissuing in 1973. The following year, 1975, saw three major books about Judy: “Judy” by Gerold Frank; “Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland” by Christopher Finch; and “Judy Garland” by Anne Edwards. There would be other books and albums but what really changed things was the home media “revolution” in the 1980s. For the first time, the public could buy or rent their favorite films in an affordable format. This created a new market for classic films. Judy’s films were quite popular and gave fans a chance to see films they might never would have, or they might have to wait for an obscure 3 a.m. showing of a bad print split up by endless infomercials. The Wizard of Oz, Meet Me In St. Louis, and Easter Parade were the first three Garland films released in the new medium, as they have been in every new format since. By 1995 VHS and laser discs ruled the home video market, and compact discs had taken over as the audio format of choice. Rhino Records released no less than six Judy Garland soundtrack CDs and three soundtrack CD boxed sets. This was the start of several years of newly restored and remastered classic film soundtracks and compilations from the label. The following pages highlight the best of the home media releases in 1995. It’s hard to believe that it’s already been twenty years! 1995 - Home Media Renaissance continued\n\n17. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 17 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 17 Originally scheduled for a 1994 release but held until 1995, this amazing laser disc boxed set is still the best home video presentation of Judy’s MGM years. The set featured three films: The Harvey Girls; The Pirate; and Summer Stock, but the real icing on the cake were the extras. Not only were there previously unseen shorts (including the recently discovered Bubbles from 1930 - that’s the reason for the set’s delay) but there were hours upon hours of alternate audio. The alternate audio tracks featured the pre-recording sessions for the three films listed above, plus most of Judy’s other films for the studio. A real treasure!

The laser set featured all three films plus an extra disc with even more numbers, including the stereo versions of “Do The La Conga” (Strike Up The Band - 1940); “Bombshell From Brazil” (Babes on Broadway - 1941); and stereo excerpts from The Wizard of Oz (1939). Alternate audio tracks featured recording sessions from many MGM musicals including Judy’s 1936 short Every Sunday. Click here for complete details at The Judy Garland Online Discography. The 6-CD boxed set from Rhino Records was similar in content to the laser disc set in that it featured the complete soundtracks to all three films plus a disc of extras. Many tracks were remixed into stereo from the surviving recording session’s multiple “angles.” The set was reissued in 2006 with previously unreleased performances including the complete outtake of Judy’s “Buds Won’t Bud” from Andy Hardy Meets Debutante (1940).

The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 19 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 19 The 1990s and part of the 2000s were the heyday of CDs. In 1995 alone no less than thirty CD releases of varying quality were released. The CDs shown here are the more notable releases of 1995 (excepting the Rhino CDs featured on the following pages). Capitol Records’ “Judy Garland - 25th Anniversary Retrospective” marked the 25th anniversary of Judy’s death by bringing together a variety of Judy’s recordings on one CD covering 1938 to 1965 and included soundtrack, studio, and live performances. “Spotlight on Judy Garland” is another Capitol compilation, this time part of their “Great Ladies of Song” series. The single CD has a nice selection of Judy’s studio recordings for the label. The Laserlight label released two Christmas themed CDs: “Christmas Through the Years” is a nice compilation of Decca, MGM Records, and TV performances. “The Judy Garland Christmas Album” is comprised of the soundtrack of the Christmas episode of Judy’s 1963/64 TV series “The Judy Garland Show.” Laserlight also released a 5-CD set aptly titled “The Judy Garland Show” that features a wide variety of performances from Judy’s TV series. Judy’s daughter Lorna Luft took the lead from Natalie Cole’s hit “duet” of “Unforgettable” with her father, Nat “King” Cole, and released an extended CD single of her singing a “duet” with Judy’s Decca recording of “Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.” 1995 - Home Media Renaissance continued\n\n20. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 20 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 20 Rhino Records released six CDs and three CD sets of Judy’s MGM soundtracks in 1995. These were newly restored, expanded CDs featuring lavish booklets with great information and photos. All featured previously unreleased recordings, many in stereo for the first time. They were a soundtrack collector’s dream come true. To promote the new series, the label put out a promotional CD housed in a faux jewelry box titled “Hollywood’s Most Precious Jewels.” The accompanying booklet stated: From grand musicals to sweeping epics to heart-pounding suspense, the Turner Entertainment Company’s library of classic films from the M-G-M, RKO, and Warner Bros. studios encompasses the most important and beloved films in Hollywood’s history. Now, the soundtracks to those landmark films are being released through Turner Classic Movies Music and Rhino Movie Music. The label wasn’t kidding. In 1994, Rhino provided CD soundtracks for the MGM/UA special edition laser disc releases of Meet Me In St. Louis and Ziegfeld Follies. Those CDs were the last official MGM Records soundtracks ever released. Each disc carried the MGM logo, not the Rhino Records logo, and had different disc art than when released as part of the new CD series on April 25, 1995. Easter Parade was released on May 23rd; The Wizard of Oz 2-CD “Deluxe Edition” followed on July 18th; the 4-CD set “Mickey & Judy: The Judy Garland & Mickey Rooney Collection” and the single CD “songs only” The Wizard of Oz were both released on September 19th; and finally the 6-CD boxed set of the That’s Entertainment! films was released on October 24th (see page 18). 1995 - Home Media Renaissance continued\n\n21.

Sold for $2,750.00 Catalog description: Typed letter signed (“Bing”) on Crosby’s stationery, 1 p, Pebble Beach, California, October 11, 1954, inscribed in red pencil “File J G Personal.” Crosby writes to thank Garland for speaking well of him during an NBC radio program. He apologizes for having heard it after its initial broadcast, joking that he missed the show because “it was at 3 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon, and you know where I am likely to be at that time on that day – generally somewhere around the 11th hole, trying to convert a high faded tee shot into a par 4.” Crosby was a well-known golf obsessive, starting his own tournament in 1937. Crosby is referencing the “Bing Crosby 20th Anniversary Tribute” show that aired on NBC Radio on September 24, 1954. Judy sang “Swingin’ On A Star.” It’s notable as it was Judy’s last real radio program. After this, Judy’s radio appearances would be comprised of basic interviews and performances lifted from various recordings. The television age had taken over. continued\n\n33.

On April 19, 2013 Watertower Music re-released the out-of-print Rhino Records version of the soundtrack to The Wizard of Oz on green vinyl but that was a limited edition version only available in stores on “Record Store Day.” That vinyl release, minus the green colored vinyl, was made available on Amazon on October 16, 2015. Excepting the fact that the audio has been remastered, these three new releases are exact duplicates of the original LPs in the song line-up and cover & back cover artwork.

Unfortunately, being a copy of the Rhino set, the all-mono soundtrack still has that very low fidelity. Plus, that loud “where” in the second chorus of “Over the Rainbow” is still there, a flaw in the remastering that now goes back 20 years. One would think it would have been fixed by now. This soundtrack practically begs for a remastering. The iTunes download comes with a very low resolution PDF booklet copy of the original print booklet that accompanied the CD set in 1995 but with different cover and back cover artwork reflecting the new label’s theme. The cover art (see here) is the same design as the 2013 green vinyl release. That vinyl release was made available on Amazon on October 16, 2015 minus the green colored vinyl. 2015 saw the first ever HD release of a Garland album with the August 7, 2105 release of Judy’s first album for Capitol Records, 1955’s “Miss Show Business.” The HD version was mastered by Robert Vosgien, Senior Mastering Engineer at Capitol Studios and it sounds great.

The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 42 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments INTERVIEW WITH RICK SMITH Rick Smith is a long-time record collector. He has stated about his “Lose That Long Face” lacquer featuring Judy Garland and Monette Moore that “These acetates are the kind made of an aluminum core with a durable black lacquer coating, not the ones made of soft wax or brittle shellac. I’m a longtime collector of 78 rpm records, and I know how to care for them… As far as I know, these Warner Bros. acetates are the only pre-recordings from “Star” to have survived. So it’s very fortunate that this different version of that number happened to be one of the survivors… I still find it hard to believe what I’ve found and that I get to play a part in its rediscovery. Thanks again for helping to get this music to people who will appreciate and enjoy it… The release of the Decca tests on CD was big news for anyone who loves classic musicals, and especially for Judy Garland’s many fans. The fascinating story of how those recordings were found is amazingly similar to how I acquired these acetates from A Star Is Born. When I read the liner notes in the set I bought, I would never have imagined history could repeat itself like this — much less with me playing a role in their rediscovery.” Read the press release about the upcoming “Judy Garland Sings Harold Arlen” CD featuring this rare recording – with the complete track listing – here. The Judy Room: When did you acquire the “Lose That Long Face” lacquer? Could you describe the circumstances how you acquired it? Rick Smith: In early 2014 I made contact with a lady in California whose grandmother had bought Judy’s house on Rockingham Drive in the 1960’s. Judy had left what the granddaughter called “a lot of junk” in the attic, where it sat for decades. The family didn’t get around to clearing out the attic until about 10 years ago. They sold what they could, kept a few souvenirs for themselves, and threw away the rest. Then about 3 years ago they found a few other items, including this group of records. The lady said they were big, black records of Judy singing, but she didn’t know anything about them because they had no labels. She thought they might have been privately recorded, but she wasn’t sure. I hesitated to buy them, but I decided that even if the music was nothing special, this was something that had belonged to Judy. She held it in her hands and thought it was important enough to keep in her home. It would be a tangible connection to my favorite entertainer, and that alone would be enough to make it worth the amount the owner was asking. So I took a deep breath and placed a large bid, which narrowly won the auction. JR: When you listened to the record for the first time, did you immediately realize you had a collector’s item? RS: When the records arrived, I immediately recognized that they were film studio acetates, like the practice record Judy plays at the beginning of the “Someone At Last” number. I expected they would be the same songs I’d been listening to for years on the Columbia Records soundtrack album. The first record I played had Judy’s soliloquy at the beginning of “Born In A Trunk,” and the other side was the first portion of that same sequence. Again, this music was already quite familiar to me. The next record I played was “Lose That Long Face,” and sounded the same as the soundtrack. Then, about halfway through the song, I heard Judy singing lyrics I’d never heard before! I like to think I’m something of an expert about her studio recordings, and this was brand new to me. I turned and stared at my turntable as a chill went down my spine and my heart started pounding. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, so I played it again and again while listening closely. There was absolutely no doubt I’d stumbled onto something very special. JR: How did you learn about the historic importance of the lacquer? RS: I wanted to educate myself by getting as much information about this Originally published on December 14, 2015 by JudyGarlandNews.com continued\n\n43.

I checked the indexes of all my books about Judy, then I did an online search for anything I could learn. The first thing I found was Scott Brogan’s excellent review of the Blu-ray issue of “A Star Is Born,” and that gave me exactly the information I was looking for. I scrolled down to read what he’d written about the disc of extra material, and that explained everything. He wrote, among a number of other things, about some silent footage of an early version of “Lose That Long Face” on this disc: “We get a peek at the early version, for which the audio doesn’t survive…” When I saw this, I shouted at my computer, “Yes it does, and I’ve got it!” JR: Did you ever consider contacting Warner Bros. about your discovery? RS: Yes, that was one possibility I considered. I thought about that disc of extra material with a brief clip of that early version. I thought about how wonderful it would be if my track could be matched to that silent film. Then we’d have a new Technicolor production number from Judy’s greatest film. Perhaps that could’ve been included in updated Blu-ray reissue, and how wonderful that could be! But my daydream came to a screeching halt when I remembered reading about how some studios have confiscated rare material from collectors in the past, usually prints of film that the studios no longer have. If something like that happened, this amazing music might disappear into the studio’s archives, and never see the light of day again. I wanted this music to be shared with the people who would appreciate it, and not to be lost all over again. There was no way I was going to let that happen, so I decided to look for another way to share my discovery. Sixty years in hibernation were long enough, and I wanted to make this music public. JR: “Lose That Long Face” is a perfect fit for Judy Garland Sings Harold Arlen. How did that come about? RS: After I had a fuller understanding of what I had and how important this music was, the next step was to find the best way to share it with the people who would enjoy it as much as I did. I feel it’s wrong for people who own rare material to keep it to themselves, or use it to impress their friends without considering how much it would be appreciated if they shared it with the public. My first thought was to contact Ron Haver, but I knew he was no longer living, so I wasn’t sure what to do. Then I remembered Scott Brogan’s wonderful website, “The Judy Room,” which I’ve enjoyed for years. I knew the site had a Facebook page, so I contacted him in his capacity as its webmaster. I sent him a private message, telling him about my discovery and gave him my email address. We began corresponding last summer, and he put me in touch with Larry Schulman, who had produced the CD set with the Decca tests. I already had this set in my own collection, so I knew I was in good hands. When he told me about his plans to issue a set of Judy’s performances of Harold Arlen songs, I felt this was the perfect vehicle for my discovery to be shared. JR: Do you have other Garland items that might be rare? CLICK HERE or on the image above to watch the teaser video for the upcoming “Judy Garland Sings Harold Arlen” 2-CD set that includes a clip of the previously lost extended version of “Lose that Long Face” from A Star Is Born. continued\n\n44. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 44 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments INTERVIEW WITH RICK SMITH RS: I have a few other rare Garland recordings, including a radio program of Judy performing with Danny Kaye and Lauritz Melchior which I believe has not been heard since it was recorded during WW2. It’s a funny skit with songs about wartime inconveniences, and I hope it can eventually, be made available to the public. Last year I acquired an interesting item that had been in the personal collection of Hugh Martin. It was a recording of “Boys and Girls Like You and Me” that was recorded at MGM in December 1943 for Judy’s film “Meet Me In St. Louis,” but cut from the final release print. It’s somewhat different from the Decca recording, and as far as I know it’s never been available to the public. I also have a couple of other studio acetates from “A Star Is Born” from the group of records my discovery came from. They’re different parts of “Born In A Trunk,” and basically the same as what’s in the Columbia Records soundtrack album. But they begin with Ray Heindorf shouting “One, two!” before the orchestra begins playing, which is fun to hear. They also include a series of clicks that serve as a cue for Judy, signaling a change in the music’s tempo. JR: You are surely aware of Cynthia Meader, who owns Garland’s 1935 Decca tests, and how her name has now become part of the history of them. With the release of the “Lose That Long Face” lacquer, your name too becomes part of its history. How do you feel about that? RS: Me, a part of history? That’s hard for me to imagine, but then I still can’t believe I was the one who made this amazing discovery. I’m honored to play a part in getting it released, and I like to think of it as a present from Judy to a very dedicated fan. I’m glad this wonderful music is being heard at last by her other fans, and by everyone who appreciates classic musicals from Hollywood’s “Golden Age.” By my standards, this is one of the biggest things that ever happened to me, and I couldn’t be happier to have participated in the release of this set. JR: You are clearly passionate about Judy Garland. What do you like about her? Did you ever see her in concert? RS: I was only 10 years old when Judy’s spirit moved on, so I never got to see her in concert. My first exposure to Judy came when “The Wizard of Oz” was shown every year on television in the 1960’s. My first-grade class play was “Oz,” and I played the part of the talking apple tree, so that was an early connection. I wanted the part of the Wicked Witch of the East but lost interest when I learned I wouldn’t get to wear red and white striped stockings! I gained a greater appreciation of her artistry as an adult. As a gay man, I can identify with Dorothy Gale’s dissatisfaction with her drab surroundings, and wishing for a safe, happy place “where there isn’t any trouble.” I especially admire Judy’s strength and resilience because she never stopped trying to be happy, and at the same time she allowed us to see her vulnerability. She was down many times in her life, but never out. JR: You are a longtime collector of 78 rpm records. How did this passion begin? And what kind of records do you collect? How large is the collection? RS: I can’t remember a time when I didn’t love records! I started collecting them before I was old enough to go to school, and I always had a record player. Details of the lacquer playback disc for “Lose That Long Face” continued\n\n45. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 45 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments INTERVIEW WITH RICK SMITH I would estimate I have about 4,000 records in my collection, including lots of 45’s and LP albums. But my chief interest is collecting 78 rpm records, with about 2,000 of them at present. I have several areas I particularly enjoy collecting, such as the Spoken Word category, including speeches by famous people, comedy routines, and advertising records. I have a special passion for records with speeches by royalty, with about 70 of these rare discs in my collection. I also have a number of Edison cylinders, but I don’t have a machine to play them on. These players are especially temperamental and have many parts; working machines are very expensive. A special area I have a passion for is “Personality” 78s; recordings by famous people who didn’t usually make a lot of recordings. I have records by famous songwriters like Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Harold Arlen, George M. Cohan, and George Gershwin, performing their own compositions. These records are very few in number, and incredibly scarce. I have 78s by actors like Walter Pidgeon, Pola Negri, Rudolph Valentino, Sophie Tucker, Mae West, and a few Broadway stars. Fred Astaire is another favorite subject, along with Fanny Brice and even Marlon Brando. And then there are my Judy Garland records, which are among my proudest possessions. JR: How long have you been collecting Judy Garland records? Please describe your Garland collection. RS: My first Garland records were LPs like “Judy at Carnegie Hall,” the double albums of her Decca recordings from the 1930’s and 40’s, and reissues of songs from her MGM films. I enjoyed them so much I started buying every Garland record I could find, with the goal of collecting everything she ever recorded. And then there are my Judy Garland 78’s. Earlier this year I completed a project I’ve been working on for about 35 years, which was to acquire at least one copy of each of Judy’s 78 rpm records. There were over 100 of them, including albums with 3 to 5 records in them, plus foreign pressings of her American recordings. One by one, I started buying them whenever I could find them and quickly acquired the more common Decca 78s. Then I worked on the rarer items like “I’m Just Wild About Harry,” which was never released in the US; only in England. I found a usable copy of her only V-Disc, “I May Be Wrong,” and the pair of singles she recorded for Columbia Records in 1953. Her Decca recording of “I Wish I Judy and Harold Arlen, October 15, 1967 Click here to check out The Judy Room’s Extensive Spotlight on A Star Is Born. continued\n\n46. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 46 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments Were In Love Again” was especially difficult to locate, but I managed to track down a nice copy about 6 months ago. It was a happy day when I finally found the last 78 that had been hiding from me; the UK pressing of a Capitol Records disc, “Just Imagine,” which I bought from a gentleman in Wales. I was relieved when it survived the transatlantic trip intact and had withstood the tender care of the USPS. Like all 78 rpm collectors, I’ve received my share of broken records due to mishandling and poor packing. It’s always a disappointment when that happens, but it goes with the territory. But fortunately, not this time. JR: Besides your interest in Garland and collecting, tell us about yourself. RS: There’s really not much to tell. My family moved around a lot while I was growing up; I was born in California and lived in several towns in Ohio, mostly in Newark. I’ve lived all my adult life in Atlanta, which is a wonderful place and I love it here. During my working years I was a pharmacy technician and foreign language interpreter, but now I’m enjoying retirement. In addition to record collecting, I enjoy surfing the Internet and I have fun collecting paper money from around the world, and films on home video. I’m single for now, and I live in a tall apartment building with my feline companion, “Cleocatra.” I was privileged to serve two terms as Secretary of my building’s Resident Association, and when our President became incapacitated, I was appointed Acting President for the remainder of her term. I feel it’s important that we give something of ourselves for the benefit of others, and I enjoyed serving my community. I’ll continue to enjoy listening to Judy’s recordings, watching her films and television performances, and reading books about her as they’re written. And why? There’s something about her that I can’t put into words, so I’ll leave that to people who are more eloquent and better informed than me. In the meantime, I’m putting another Garland record on my turntable, and I’ll dream of a place “where there isn’t any trouble.” Thanks for reading, and best wishes. © 2015 Scott Brogan, The Judy Room & Judy Garland News & Events Read the press release about the upcoming “Judy Garland Sings Harold Arlen” CD featuring this rare recording – with the complete track listing – here.

The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 47 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments INTERVIEW WITH STEVIE PHILLIPS Stevie Phillips’ new book, “Judy & Liza & Robert & Freddie & David & Sue & Me…: A Memoir” has caused quite a stir in Garfandom and become somewhat controversial. Here at The Judy Room and Judy Garland News & Events, we like to hear from everyone, including those who’s opinions or viewpoints might not be “popular.” Everyone has a story, and everyone should have a chance to give their side of their story. We’re happy to give Ms. Phillips a chance to answer some questions and address some of the controversies surrounding her new book. Thank you Ms. Phillips! Stevie Phillips began working for Freddie Fields and David Begelman at Music Corporation of America (MCA) under the glare of legendary über-agent Lew Wasserman. When MCA blew apart, Fields and Begelman created Creative Management Associates (CMA), now International Creative Management, and Phillips went along, becoming head of the theater and the motion picture department. Fields convinced Judy Garland to come on board, and Phillips became, as she puts it, “Garland’s shadow,” putting out fires — figurative and literal — in order to get her to the next concert in the next down-and-out town. In her new tough-talking memoir, “Judy & Liza & Robert & Freddie & David & Sue & Me..: A Memoir” (St. Martin’s Press, 2015), Phillips paints a portrait of a Garland that was at times a nightmare. Phillips says, “She became my teacher,” showing her “how to” and “how not to” live. As an agent, Phillips represented Garland’s fiercely talented daughter, Liza Minnelli, as well as Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Henry Fonda, George Roy Hill, Bob Fosse, Cat Stevens, and David Bowie. She produced multiple award-winning Broadway shows – among them, Doonesbury, Loose Ends, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, and Open Admissions – and film productions, and counted her colleague, the legendary agent Sue Mengers, among her closest confidantes. She lives in New York City. The Judy Room: Your memoir describes painful personal memories of Judy Garland, but also shows great respect for her work. Overall, which weighs more: her memory or her talent? Stevie Phillips: I wrote a chapter in the book entitled “Sometimes”. It’s still the word that best sums up my feelings. Sometimes it’s the awful things that happened that weigh most heavily, and sometimes I remember a voice that was liquid magic, that could wrap itself around any note and engage your sympathy. It’s never all one or the other. JR: Why did you wait so long to publish your memoir? SP: I started it over many times, and put it away often, sometime for years. First it was going to be a screenplay, then a novel, and finally a memoir. And time has a way of collapsing. Suddenly I’m 79 and I don’t know how I got here so fast. JR: Are there things about Garland that, for whatever reason, you left out? SP: I told about the things that impacted me. Yes, of course, I left things out that were not a part of my growth, but they were mostly more of the same rather than anything different.

The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 48 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments INTERVIEW WITH STEVIE PHILLIPS JR: You were no longer personally involved with her when she died, and you mention her death after the fact. What was your reaction when you learned she died? SP: I was incredibly saddened but certainly not surprised. JR: Garland died broke. How is it possible for a woman so rich in talent to have wound up so poor after a 45-year career? SP: She didn’t care about her money, and so she didn’t take care of it. And then there were the two awful men – David Begelman and Sid Luft – that stole her money, spent her money, and used her. JR: Recently, there is a school of thought which idolizes Garland and everything she did during her career. There is another school which treats her as a human being, frailties and all. Where do you stand? SP: Clearly with the latter. She was not Dorothy Gale in real life. I tried to humanize her. JR: Fans have pooh-poohed your book for showing a negative side to Garland, and for revealing intimate details, including sexual, that might better be left unsaid. They even doubt the accuracy of your memories. What do you say to them? SP: They are entitled to believe what they wish, and if they’re comfortable disliking the book and me, I’m okay with that. I told my own story, and I have no regrets about that. JR: Do you have anything nice to say about David Begelman or Sid Luft? Not a thing. JR: Nowadays stars take care of themselves. That is, they eat well, exercise, get enough sleep. Why do you think Garland took such poor care of herself? SP: Her addiction got in the way of her common sense and self concern. JR: On a 1964 Jack Paar program, Garland said that “Things happen to me, or I bring them on. I couldn’t care less.” In your opinion, did things happen to her, or did she bring them on? SP: Judy always had options. She made poor choices that contributed to terrible results. JR: Garland is often portrayed as a victim – of her mother, Louis B. Meyer, husbands, managers, the system. Is she at all to blame for what happened to her? SP: She was certainly victimized as a child so far as I know. I wasn’t there. As a mature adult, she always had the opportunity to grab the reins and run her life. Either she wasn’t capable (and I don’t believe that) or she chose not to. JR: Your memoir depicts a kind of permanent anarchy as the norm in her life, a permanent anarchy that she thrived on. In your opinion, did she not grasp that this anarchy would be her ruin? Or did she not care? Begelman continued\n\n49. The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 49 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments INTERVIEW WITH STEVIE PHILLIPS SP: It was both. There were times when I thought she didn’t realize it and we talked about it, and it was in those very moments she convinced me she didn’t care. JR: It has been stated that Garland’s short life was a long suicide. Do you agree? SP: I think the description is a little convenient, but addiction is completely suicidal, in my opinion. Having said that, I don’t think that she wanted to die during the time I knew her. Had that been her wish, she would not have called me so often at three in the morning to come save her. JR: You worked with Garland in the early 1960s, when she was robust, and saw her for the last time in 1967 at Liza’s wedding, where you state you were shocked at how frail she had become. It should be noted she looked healthy in 1967 compared to 1969, when she died. She seems to have aged very quickly. Do you think she was aware of her physical decline? SP: Yes. She wasn’t stupid by any means. JR: Composer John Meyer, who lived with Garland in late 1968, has stated that when Garland got up – usually in the afternoon – her breakfast was vodka and Ritalin. Does this surprise you? SP: Yes. She had been told, when we were together, that drinking high proof liquor would kill her. Perhaps she had a hyper-extended death wish toward the end. JR: You saw Garland perform many times in the early 1960s. Can you tell us what it was like to see her on stage? SP: It was magic. She could wring such incredible meaning out of lyrics. I’ve never again seen anyone capable of the same thing. Her performances were deeply touching, exciting, and delicious. So filled with the best ingredients . JR: Your descriptions of Garland’s bloody self-mutilations are shocking even to the most hardened reader. In hindsight, would you say there was self-hatred there, a desire to die, or just a need to get attention? SP: I’ve spent a hundred pages and 50 years trying to understand it. When I first met her it seemed like a great need to get attention, but later on it had to have turned to something more pitiful: wanting to die. JR: You begin and end the memoir by talking about Garland. Today, so many years after her death, fans carry a passion for her that is boundless. Why is it that she has haunted your life, and that of others, to this day? Why exactly was she so unforgettable?

The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 50 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments INTERVIEW WITH STEVIE PHILLIPS SP: I think because she was on screen the living incarnation of many of our dreams. For a dreamer like me she was the epitome of all good things. I didn’t want my dreams to decay. Who does? JR: Do you think Garland was a strong woman? SP: Absolutely not! To me, strong means wise, and self-protective. JR: Garland thrived on chaos. Can one therefore conclude she had a happy life? SP: Of course not. But there were many happy moments, and none of those were chaotic. JR: Christopher Finch, in his landmark 1975 biography of Garland, Rainbow, writes about the end of her life as such: “Her behavior in this penultimate phase of her life was so erratic that it’s easy to believe that her excesses […] may have caused some kind of brain damage. We are no longer talking about someone who is driven to bizarre behavior by the circumstances of her life; we are talking about someone who at times was probably certifiably insane.” Do you agree? SP: I wasn’t there at the very end. I’m glad of it. I couldn’t have watched it without trying to change it, which had never been possible when I was there. JR: By the way, have you ever drunk Liebfraumilch, Garland’s favorite white wine? SP: I have and I hated it. © 2015 Scott Brogan, The Judy Room & Judy Garland News & Events\n\n51.

He is a longtime Judy Garland fan. His original songs, At The Opera, Just Like Judy and The Ballad of Judy Garland are available on iTunes, as are his renditions of Santa Baby and Let It Snow. His one-act play, The Judy Monologues, is based entirely on rare voice recordings made by Garland in the mid-1960s. His short play, Ramblings of a Middle Aged Drag Queen, is set in a Toronto gay bar in the 1990s. Sherlock & Watson: Behind Closed Doors imagines a gay relationship between the famous detective and his trusted sidekick. Darren is a member of the Playwrights Guild of Canada. He is also the Artistic Director of Gay Play Day, an annual festival of LGBTQ theatre in Toronto, Ontario. The Judy Monologues is a one-act play based entirely upon rare voice tapes recorded by Judy Garland in the mid-1960s for her never-written autobiography. Conceived and directed by Darren Stewart-Jones, the original production featured vintage film clips of Garland from MGM’s Till the Clouds Roll By. The Judy Monologues premiered at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre in Toronto, Ontario in September 2010 and subsequently played The Pearl Company in Hamilton, Ontario. Performed by three male actors as a tribute to Garland’s influence on the gay community, the original cast featured Philip Cairns, Ryan Fisher and Darren Stewart-Jones. Nigel Gough (1982–2010) was the understudy. A Garland lookalike, Kimberly Roberts, also appeared in silent vignettes. An abridged version of the play was performed in London, Ontario as part of the London One Act Festival in April, 2011. Philip Cairns won Best Actor at the festival’s awards ceremony. The play also received two additional awards – special mentions for the concept and the audio/visual content. The Judy Monologues was performed at the 2012 Toronto Fringe Festival. Michael Hughes replaced Ryan Fisher in his role. A revamped version of The Judy Monologues was performed at the 2013 Hamilton Fringe Festival as a one-woman show, with Elley-Ray Hennessy portraying Garland to rave reviews. The Judy Monologues will be performed at the 2015 SpringWorks Festival in Stratford, Ontario. Check out: thejudymonologues.blogspot.com and the show’s Facebook Page The Judy Room: The tapes Judy Garland made in the hope of publishing a biography are not always “the best of Judy Garland.” Do you think they are an accurate depiction of her? Darren Stewart-Jones: I believe the tapes are an accurate depiction of Garland at a certain time in her life. JR: Many admirers of Garland may not want to see her through tapes for which she was not always sober or coherent. What do you say to those who might criticize you for your choice of sources? DS-J: We use what I believe are the best bits of the recordings. This piece of theatre celebrates Garland. Audiences leave with a respect for her talent and an insight into what it might be like to be one of the most famous people on the planet and an understanding of the kind of stress that level of fame might have on an individual. JR: The double CD Judy Garland Speaks!, on which The Judy Monologues are based, is a bootleg never meant for public consumption. Garland herself would most certainly never have approved its public release. Did you have any moral qualms in using source tapes meant to remain private? DS-J: I would argue that the tapes were recorded as notes for a potential INTERVIEW WITH DARREN STEWART-JONES continued Originally published on April 17, 2015 by JudyGarlandNews.com\n\n52.

The fact that they exist as archives to this day is fascinating to me. JR: In his 2000 biography Get Happy, Gerald Clarke, like you, doesn’t wear rose-tinted glasses in dealing with his subject. Do you think that so many years after her death, the public is entitled to know everything about Judy Garland? Or do you believe she should be depicted in her best light? DS-J: I think many of us are intrigued by celebrity. Personally, I enjoy biographies written about individuals who reach the pinnacle of their chosen field as Judy obviously did. I am interested in what makes someone like Garland so unique. What is behind the genius and the talent? JR: At your blog, you state that the play was written “as a tribute to Garland’s influence on the gay community.” In a recent New York Times article by Robert Leleux, he states that Judy’s influence on gays today is over. Is “Judyism” dead or alive? DS-J: The original version of the play was performed by three male actors (including myself) in a gay theatre in Toronto, so in that sense it was a tribute. I think gay men have always had a fascination with female Icons. I was born the same month and year that Garland died, so she wasn’t exactly current when I was growing up but I was immediately drawn to her talent and to her life story when I discovered her. I believe all of the great performers continue to influence future generations, gay or straight. JR: On the source tapes, Judy depicts herself as a victim. She also states that “being Judy Garland is quite a chore.” Do you think gays are victims? Do you think being gay is a chore? DS-J: I don’t consider myself as a victim or my sexuality as a chore. Life in general is probably easier for straight people but I came out at a very young age and luckily, have managed to surround myself with supportive individuals. I am also a white male so I have never personally experienced race or gender inequality. JR: Do you think straight audiences can appreciate Judy Garland, and your play? DS-J: The audience members I most enjoy meeting are the ones who know nothing about Judy other than that she was the girl in The Wizard of Oz. This play is an educational experience for many who come to see it. Remember, the monologues are interpolated with film footage of Garland from her Hollywood heyday. Several audience members haven’t previously seen the clips we use nor do they know anything about her personal life prior to seeing the play. JR: The play has been performed by three male actors, and more recently by a female actress. Do you prefer males or a female to play Garland? Why? DS-J: The initial version of the play (with three actors) was more of a workshop. I was still trying to figure out how to use the material most effectively. I then had the good fortune of meeting Elley-Ray (who plays Judy) while working with her on another project. She is one of Toronto’s finest actresses.

A local theatre critic called her “Garland reborn” in his review of the play. You need to be at the top of your game to play Garland convincingly. JR: Did you see Peter Quilter’s End of the Rainbow with Tracie Bennett? If yes, what did you think? DS-J: I saw End of the Rainbow in the West End. I thought Tracie’s performance was incredible. I really thought she was going to win the Tony after being nominated for the Broadway run of the show. The year she was nominated, the awards ceremony took place on the date of Judy’s birthday. Unfortunately, she didn’t win but she’s a great performer nonetheless. I have actually written a script for a musical about Garland myself. I’m hoping to produce it in the near future. JR: The tapes The Judy Monologues uses were made in the 1960s, when Judy was not always in physically or financially good shape. Just like End of the Rainbow, it concentrates on her anguish rather than her artistry. Why does her decline seem to be of greater interest than her glory days? DS-J: Any story has to have conflict in order to drive the plot and capture an audience’s attention. Judy is quite angry and bitter during some of the monologues but we also see her vulnerability, her intelligence, her love for her children and especially her sense of humour. JR: The play has been performed since 2010. What has been the public reaction? Has it evolved since it first opened? DS-J: Well, the fact that we are still performing the show five years later tells me that people are still interested in this story. Every time I think I have put it to bed, another opportunity to perform the play presents itself. Working with Elley-Ray is a collaborative process. We change the script here and there each time we go back to visit it. We have taken bits and pieces of the tapes and merged them together to make the story more coherent. I am also adding more film footage of Judy this time around. JR: Has your perspective on Judy Garland changed since The Judy Monologues first opened? How so? DS-J: I am still in love with Judy as much as I ever was, if not more so. JR: Since the play has been performed so far in Canada, do you find Canadians have a different take on Garland than elsewhere? DS-J: I think her appeal is universal. Our Ontario audiences have been great. I’m looking forward to the show being performed internationally one day. JR: Why do you think Judy Garland is remembered today, ninety-two years after her birth and forty-five years after her death? DS-J: If I knew the secret to that, I would bottle it. She had a gift. Perhaps it’s as simple as that. © 2015 Scott Brogan, The Judy Room & Judy Garland News & Events\n\n54.

Just like the 2004 edition, it was a full color printed single sheet, folded over and mailed out. It was free, but limited to a finite number of copies. Those who didn’t get a printed copy could download the high resolution PDF to save or print out themselves. It’s still available for download here. Just as it notes, 2005 was “another banner year.” The RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) inducted Judy’s Decca “Cast Album” of songs from Meet Me In St. Louis into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Two anniversaries were worth noting: The Judy Garland Database turned 10 years old as did Scott Schechter’s “Garlands for Judy” fan magazine. The Wizard of Oz received it’s first deluxe DVD treatment (see next page) as did Easter Parade. Blu-ray had not yet become the media of choice so DVDs were still big business. Sadly it’s the year in which Judy’s third husband, and man whom she was married to the longest, Sid Luft, passed away. It was also the year in which Michael Shaw’s pair of original Ruby Slippers were stolen from the Garland museum in Grand Rapids. They still have yet to be found.

The only known major release as of the date of this publication is the upcoming 2-CD set “Judy Garland Sings Harold Arlen.” Filled with newly remastered (by John H. Haley) treasures and a few previously unreleased tracks, this set is over two-and-a-half hours of Judy doing what she did best: Singing songs composed by Harold Arlen. Of particular note is the release of the complete “Lose That Long Face” from A Star Is Born. 28 seconds of previously unheard music and lyrics were thought lost for over 60 years. Thanks to Garland collector Rick Smith’s generosity, this wonderful outtake can now be seen and heard in its entirety. The recordings of Judy’s appearance at an Arlen tribute event in 1968 have also been newly remastered, properly, and are included here. This is a must-have for all Garland and Arlen fans.

The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 58 Contents Foreword Anniversaries Auctions Media Interviews A Look Back Coming Soon Stats Acknowledgments The Judy Room - 2015 Year In Review 58 STATS - blog Over at the Judy Garland News & Events blog, the “Dorothy Costumes through the years” post was the most viewed entry for the third year in a row. That’s followed by four entries in the “Judy Garland Wars” series that round out the top five viewed posts. The busiest day of the year was March 2nd, when the “Wars” series first premiered. The blog was viewed over 47k times, up from last year. The increase in views is no doubt due to the increase in posts. Looking at the map, you can see that while most of the views came from North America and Europe, the blog was viewed on every continent (except Artica and Antarctica). continued\n\n59.
