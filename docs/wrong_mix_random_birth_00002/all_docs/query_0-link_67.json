She never knew a stranger. If you were lucky enough in this life to know her  you probably loved her dearly. Despite many grueling obstacles throughout her childhood and young adult life, she chose to rise gracefully above them all. She always chose love and laughter. She was truly hilarious  her quick wit was comedic gold up until her last breath and her deep dimples and belly laughter will live on in her family for generations to come. She leaned on her faith in God no matter what. She was a very generous woman, and she was an avid Browns fan since 1980. Against the odds, she and her husband of 63 years, Ronald Cushman, created a beautiful life for themselves and a beautiful family that they loved unconditionally. Juanita was born to ­­­­Lawrence Sandy and Ruth Marple on February 23, 1941, at home in Salem, OH. When she was six years old, she was given up for adoption to Kate and Shike Breault who lovingly raised her right here in Salem, OH until their passing when she was only 18 years of age. Her biological family moved away but she developed relationships with some of her siblings later in life and is survived by her sister Ruth Hampson Reynolds of Georgia. Nita attended St. Paul School through 8th grade and graduated from Salem High School class of 1959. Nita was someone who left a mark on everyone she met. Children always flocked to her and up until even a week before her death she could be found on the floor playing with the littlest members of our family, cracking jokes and instilling in them her unique gifts of joy and laughter and the safety of being loved for exactly who you are. There are no words for how heartbroken her family is to lose her from this earth. She was loved beyond measure. She leaves behind her husband, Ronnie Cushman, who feels lost without her. They had three children together, their oldest son Charles Chuck Cushman died tragically in a car accident when he was only 28 years old and Juanita has longed for the day she would get to see her son again which brings the family comfort during this time. Chuck had two children, Kyle Cushman and Ian Cushman. She leaves behind her second son, Jeff Cushman of Salem, OH and his four children, Brian Cushman, Brice Cushman, Sidney Cushman, and Cade Cushman. Ron and Nita got their Christmas wish in 1965 when she gave birth to a daughter, they named Connie Sue. Juanita and Connie had the kind of relationship that is all too rare among mothers and daughters. They were best friends. They talked every single day of their lives and the love and memories they shared together will be forever cherished. Connie (58) lives in Columbia, S.C. and has three children of her own, Shea Williams, Bree Pastore, and Alex Whinnery, who all were extremely close with her as well and will do their best to carry on the legacy of resilience, laughter, and love that she built for them. Juanita leaves behind 19 beautiful great grandchildren and counting. It is said that grief is the price we pay for love. In this case, the love our family had for her is limitless and so is the deep grief we will experience in the wake of her transition to be with God. To know this kind of pain means the love was really that remarkable. Juanita leaves behind not the kind of legacy that comes from material wealth or things that can be lost or destroyed she leaves us all with an ironclad legacy of love and devotion that will live on in our hearts and lineages forever. To know her was a gift, to lose her is absolutely devastating, to be loved by her is a blessing from God that can never be taken away and for that her family is eternally grateful for every moment they had with her. In lieu of flowers or cards, the family asks that you pay your respects to Nita by loving your family and friends with all your heart. Life is short even when its long. Be kind to strangers. Take care of your neighbors. Dont let the world make you cold. Make your mark on the people you love because THAT is what truly matters in this life. THAT is what carries on long after youre gone. This is what Nita would want. As Nita wished, there will be no formal services or calling hours. Arrangements are being handled by Stark Memorial Funeral Home.
