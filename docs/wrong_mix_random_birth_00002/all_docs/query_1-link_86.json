        "text": "Here are the 10,000-plus top-paid NJ public school teachers, a growing club earning $100K-plus a year. Below is the list/their districts.\n\nNEW JERSEY – Teachers' salaries are rising again, and six-figure salaries are no longer uncommon for educators in New Jersey. In fact, nearly 10,000 teachers make $100,000 or more. Patch has the list of 10,000-plus top-earning teachers and their salaries in 2019 below.\n\nThe Department of Education has released its annual list of teachers and their salaries for 2019. And the list of educators making $100,000 or more — a list that barely had any teachers on it more than a decade ago — has grown in recent years.\n\nIt's also a small fraction of the more than 100,000 people who teach in public and charter schools in this state. But the highest earners also come from all different schools — not just the so-called \"wealthy\" districts that routinely rank highly on national and state lists for best schools.\n\n(If you want to find teachers in your district, scroll through the lists that are divided based on experience below).\n\nThe data is from the 2018-2019 school year, the most recent year available. In 2018-2019, the median salary for teachers totaled $68,985, according to a Patch analysis of salary data for public school districts and charter schools. The amount was about 1.6 percent higher than the previous year (see list below).\n\nThe Department of Education has said the department double-checks the data before delivering it to the media.\n\nHere are the more than 10,000 teachers who earn the top salaries, with their school, their school district and county and, finally, their salaries (the teachers have been divided by their years of experience):\n\n50 years or more of experience:\n\nSTEPHANIE MORETTI, Menlo Park Elementary School, EDISON TWP, MIDDLESEX $117,838\n\nCAROL RUSSELL, Memorial Elementary School, PARAMUS BORO, BERGEN $115,450\n\nVINCENT TIMPANARO, Glen Ridge High School, GLEN RIDGE BORO, ESSEX $109,216\n\nANTOINETTE WASHBURN, Hasbrouck Heights High School, HASBROUCK HEIGHTS BORO, BERGEN $105,375\n\nRobert Roth, Toms River High School South, TOMS RIVER REGIONAL, OCEAN $103,495\n\nMARILYN J SIMON, School Of Information Technology, PATERSON CITY, PASSAIC $103,267\n\nThomas Halbedl, District Office, MONMOUTH REGIONAL, MONMOUTH $103,150\n\nJohn Salamon, Chesterfield Township Elementary School, CHESTERFIELD TWP, BURLINGTON $103,073\n\nJAMES WASKO, Montclair High School, MONTCLAIR TOWN, ESSEX $102,848\n\nJOANNE AANSTOOTS, Cedar Hill School, MONTVILLE TWP, MORRIS $102,685\n\nELIZABETH CLEARY, Hoover Elementary School, BERGENFIELD BORO, BERGEN $102,511\n\nJanet Kraemer, Lafayette Avenue School, SCH DIST OF THE CHATHAMS, MORRIS $102,295\n\nJOYCE JONES, Princeton High School, PRINCETON REGIONAL, MERCER $101,445\n\n40 to 49 years of experience:\n\nJoyce Zondler, Lincoln Elementary School, NORTH BERGEN TWP, HUDSON $144,317\n\nDaniel Reardon, North Bergen High School, NORTH BERGEN TWP, HUDSON $137,917\n\nJanet Sobkowicz, Waldwick High School, WALDWICK BORO, BERGEN $137,664\n\nAnthony Tabbacchino, North Bergen High School, NORTH BERGEN TWP, HUDSON $134,067\n\nJOANN SNOOK, Allentown High School, UPPER FREEHOLD REGIONAL, MONMOUTH $133,629\n\nTherese Shenton-Lehman, Memorial High School, WEST NEW YORK TOWN, HUDSON $126,789\n\nEUGENE A EHRLICH, Thomas Edison Intermediate School, WESTFIELD TOWN, UNION $126,523\n\nANTHONY DEFINA, Wayne Hills High School, WAYNE TWP, PASSAIC $126,207\n\nKATHLEEN HENDRICKS, Edison High School, EDISON TWP, MIDDLESEX $125,487\n\nJeffrey Jasper, Pascack Valley High School, PASCACK VALLEY REGIONAL, BERGEN $124,150\n\nWILLIAM PAVLU, Bergen County Academies, BERGEN COUNTY VOCATIONAL, BERGEN $123,840\n\nRivka Rosenstein, Alpine Elementary School, ALPINE BORO, BERGEN $123,343\n\nROSE MEADE, Old Bridge High School, OLD BRIDGE TWP, MIDDLESEX $122,615\n\nROBERT JR BREWSTER, Westfield Senior High School, WESTFIELD TOWN, UNION $122,035\n\nRAYMOND BANGS, Roselle Park High School, ROSELLE PARK BORO, UNION $121,634\n\nDEBORAH SHARKEY, West Orange High School, WEST ORANGE TOWN, ESSEX $121,575\n\nANDREA PASTORE, Cornelia F.
