        "text": "March signifies the month of rebirth as we exit winter and enter spring with a fresh start. There are so many celebrities who are born in March, being either a Pisces (March 1 to March 20) or an Aries (March 21 to March 31). March Pisces‘ energy is usually associated with being empathetic, competitive, and ethereal. This sign makes incredible artists and creatives. Pisces is the last sign of the zodiac, making it the most wise and psychic of all the other signs. There is much to be learned by Pisces, who tend to live half in a dream state. Represented by two fish swimming in opposite directions, the constant division of Pisces’s attention between fantasy and reality is seen as this yin-yang symbol. Half of the March Pisceans are co-ruled by the moon, the planet that governs our moods and sentiments. This makes March Pisces to be more sensitive and vulnerable to people’s temperaments than the Pisces born in February. Pisces born in March need to protect their peace by staying away from energy suckers and toxic environments.\n\nMarch Aries Traits\n\nMeanwhile, Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, so they tend to be raw with their needs, wants, and emotions. Fiery Aries are bold and ambitious, and when it comes to some of our favorite stars and directors, it is thrilling to watch. Represented by the ram, Aries are passionate, motivated, and confident leaders who build community with their relentless determination. When we think of Aries, we think of how they are very direct in their approach, sometimes too much that they often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances. This sign is ruled by Mars, the dynamic red planet named after the Roman god of war. Accordingly, these courageous rams are always ready for a fight. Aries are known for their explosive temper, but when their emotional reactions do not get the better of them, they are inspiring, playful creatures who enjoy living life to the fullest.\n\nSee below which of your favorite stars have a March birthday!"
