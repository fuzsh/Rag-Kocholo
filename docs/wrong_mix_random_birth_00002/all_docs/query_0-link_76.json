He was Princetons oldest graduate at the time of his death and was a man of great intelligence, honesty, and courage. He received the 1923 Old Guard Award in 1999 for being the oldest alumnus at Reunions. After receiving his award, Harding addressed the luncheon about the pleasures of his Princeton association. He then led the P-rade, walking the entire route. Harding and his wife spent many years as medical missionaries in Thailand. He served in a leprosy hospital in Chiang Mai during the 1930s and fled Thailand as the Japanese were invading through Burma. He reestablished his internal medicine practice in North Carolina, making subsequent trips to Thailand.\n\nHarding is survived by three children, including his son, Bill Kneedler 60, seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. A memorial service was held Apr. 21 at the Davidson College Presbyterian Church where he served as an elder. We remember several photographs that were taken in 1998, when Harding won four gold medals at the Senior Olympic Games. Harding was a wonderful Princetonian and a fine person. We extend sincere condolences to his family.\n\nThe Class of 1922\n\nHorace G. Meeker 29\n\nHorace died Mar. 3, 2002, in Maplewood, N.J.

At Princeton Bruce balanced scholarship, varsity crew, and numerous creative pursuits. Fluent in Japanese and Mandarin, he became a Princeton-in-Asia fellow in Singapore prior to graduate study at Cornell U. and a Fulbright in Japan.\n\nBruce spent 15 years with the International Food Policy Research Institute, helping developing countries adapt policies and technology to improve health and nutrition.

Jonathan came to Princeton from Seven Hills School in Cincinnati, where he was born and raised. He majored in economics, joined Charter Club, and served as co-editorial chair of the Daily Princetonian.\n\nJonathan was a bit of a nomad, picking up and moving from DC to Boston and then to San Francisco, working as an investment banker for Hambrecht & Quist.\n\nHe loved California and was an active outdoorsman  skiing in Tahoe, mountain biking, and surfing. Last year, he took a severance package when J.P. Morgan acquired H&Q and used it to undertake his freedom tour of the US, visiting many classmates across the country.\n\nIts hard not to smile when thinking of Jonathanremembering one of his many witty remarks, provocative political pontifications, or his favorite retort to an overly liberal comment: Youve GOT to be kidding me. Well remember those moments, and Jonathans huge grin and big heart.\n\nTo his parents, David and Carolyn, his brother, David, and his sister, Sarah, the class extends its deepest sympathies.\n\nThe Class of 1993"
