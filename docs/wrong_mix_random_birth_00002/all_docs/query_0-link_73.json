        "text": "I understand you were born Marie Ladagona on June 28th 1950 in Newark, New Jersey. I'm guessing Ladagona is an Italian name. Am I right? How did your parents come to be in America? Was it a musical family?\n\nLadagona is an Italian name. My parents were first generation Americans. My Mom's parents were from Sicily and my Dad's parents were from Barri. Both of my parents speak fluent Italian. My Mom had a beautiful singing voice, but never pursued a career.\n\nWhat was life like in 1950s Newark? Were you old enough to be aware of the pop music revolution going on in America?\n\nI was born in Newark, NJ, but also lived in Jersey City and Union during the 50s. My family finally settled in Union, NJ. Music was, and still is, a big part of my life, so yes, I was very aware of the pop revolution.\n\nHow old were you when you first started singing? And what sort of things were you doing as a child? Who was your childhood musical hero?\n\nI was about 10 years old when my Dad took serious notice of my voice and decided to help me pursue my dream. As a child I sang mostly for family get-togethers, charity affairs and political rallies. My childhood musical heroes were Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand and Connie Francis. The one thing that they all had in common was that they sang with feeling and from their hearts. These women played a great part in helping me develop my style.\n\nHow did your career get kick-started? And during the period prior to working with Jimmy Wisner in 1968, what were you up to? Didn't you record some singles as Marie La Donna for Gateway Records? And also do some demo work for Columbia?\n\nMy Dad took me to a local studio where I recorded \"I'll Cry For You,\" which we used as a demo. We brought the demo to the Connie Francis office where I was introduced to Don Stirling. Over the next few years, I worked with Don Stirling as Marie La Donna. Don wrote \"Bobby Baby\" and I subsequently made a master recording of this song, which was sold to Gateway in 1963. The song went to number one in the Midwest - not bad for a 13 year old. I was signed to Gateway and in 1964 released \"How Can I Let You Know,\" written and produced by Don Stirling; the Skyliners did back-up for me on this song. Also in 1964 I recorded \"Little Snowflake,\" written by Murray the K's mother; Murray was known as the fifth Beatle here in the United States. This was my last known recording with Gateway and as Marie La Donna. After 1964 I hired a manager and my name was changed to Donna Marie. Around 1966 I was signed as a solo artist - not demo work - by Columbia Records. My first single was \"The Whole Wide World is Watching Us,\" produced by Charles Calello; the flip-side was a Burt Bacharach song called \"Through the Eye of the Needle.\" My next single was \"The Penthouse,\" produced by Paul Leka of \"Green Tambourine\" fame. Around 1967 I acquired a back-up band and, with this band called the Mystics, I opened for the Four Seasons at the Asbury Park Convention Centre. The next recording on Columbia was \"He Gives Me Love (La La La),\" produced by Jimmy Wisner.\n\nWhat was it like to be in the studio for the first time? How would you describe the music you were making very early on in your career? You seem to get compared a lot to Leslie Gore. Would that be a fair comparison?\n\nI was 12 years old the first time I was in a studio, so even though it was a little frightening, I was still excited. They told me that Little Eva had recorded in the studio only the day before; I was very impressed. As to the Leslie Gore comparison, the only similarity is that we both recorded \"He Gives Me Love\" at the same time.\n\nHow did you come to meet Jimmy Wisner?\n\nAt the same time that I was recording at Columbia Records, Jimmy Wisner was producing for Columbia and that's how I met him. He had a song that he thought was perfect for me and we recorded \"He Gives Me Love (La La La).\"\n\n\"La La La\" is a song I remember from my early childhood, as it beat Cliff Richard in the 1968 Eurovision song contest. My mother is Spanish, so we always took an interest in the Spanish entry. Were you aware of the song's background when you came to record it? Can you remember much about the \"La La La\" session?\n\nThe only thing I know about the song was that it was a Eurovision winner, but I didn't know about the Spanish background. I feel fortunate that I was able to work with top studio players while I was at Columbia. To me, every session was exciting and I felt blessed to be a part of it. What I remember most about Jimmy Wisner was the support and encouragement he gave me. He brought out the best in me and helped to give me the confidence to perform as I did. He was a nice, kind man.\n\nAccording to my research, you also recorded \"The Penthouse,\" the theme to the film of the same name. What can you tell me about the film? How did you get to be involved with the soundtrack?\n\nThe only thing I know about \"The Penthouse\" is that it was a crime film. It was considered to be one of the first R rated movies of that time and the subject matter depicted a brutal attack on a woman in a penthouse apartment. My involvement came about because I was working with Paul Leka at the time and he asked me to record the title song to this film, which I did around 1967. Around 1968, I ended my association with Columbia Records. I hired a new manager - Lenny Mietus. Lenny was the one who eventually introduced me to Jeff Barry."
