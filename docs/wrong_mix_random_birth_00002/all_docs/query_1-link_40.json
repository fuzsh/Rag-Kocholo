        "text": "Lonnie G. Bunch III\n\nAmerican museum director\n\nLonnie G. Bunch III (born November 18, 1952, Newark, New Jersey) is an American historian and museum curator and administrator, the 14th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution (2019– ) and the first Black person to hold that office. Before heading the Smithsonian, he served as the founding director of the institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC; 2005–19). As the Smithsonian’s secretary, he oversees 19 museums and nine research centres as well as the National Zoo. Additionally, he is in charge of the development of two new Smithsonian museums.\n\nEarly life\n\n“I knew from a very early age that history mattered,” Bunch told Encyclopædia Britannica in 2022. “My grandfather read to me.…I was only four years old, but I would look at the pictures, and I knew I wanted to know the stories of the people.”\n\nBunch was born in Newark, New Jersey, the elder son of high-school science teacher Lonnie G. Bunch, Jr., and third-grade teacher Montrose Boone-Bunch. He grew up in a largely Italian American neighbourhood, and race was a constant presence during his childhood. “We were the only Black family in the neighborhood,” Bunch recalled in the interview with Britannica. “I remember playing in the street, and one of the mothers came out with Kool-Aid for the kids. She told me that I could ‘drink out of the hose.’ So I learned how to straddle many worlds, and that’s how history became my weapon in a fight for fairness and social justice.”\n\nAfter first attending Howard University, in Washington, D.C., he received bachelor’s and master’s degrees from American University.\n\nEarly career\n\nBunch started his career at the Smithsonian, and, although he would leave it several times for opportunities at museums in other parts of the United States, he found the Smithsonian to be always more siren than institution. He has described it as the place that “gave me not just a career but a calling.” It is also where he met the woman who became his wife, Maria Marable-Bunch.\n\nBunch’s first job at the Smithsonian was as an education specialist at the iconic National Air and Space Museum, on the National Mall, in 1978–79. He left that position to join the team that opened the California African American Museum in Los Angeles in time for the 1984 Olympics, which the city hosted. As part of that museum project, he curated an exhibition on the history of Black Olympic athletes that featured, among others, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, famous for giving the Black Power salute during the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Developing that exhibition, Bunch later said, taught him that “protest is the highest form of patriotism. It’s not about hating a nation but expecting a nation to live up to its promises.”\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In 2001 he left the Smithsonian again, to become president of the Chicago Historical Society (now the Chicago History Museum). It was during his tenure there that he met Mamie Till-Mobley, the mother of Emmett Till, who had been murdered in Mississippi in 1955 when he was 14 years old. That meeting with Till-Mobley, who became an icon of the civil rights movement for her devotion to telling her son’s story, would shape much of the next chapter of Bunch’s career.\n\n“I spent several hours with her,” Bunch later said. “She told me everything that happened from the time she kissed him goodbye until the time she buried him. She carried that burden for 50 years, and in that meeting she asked me to carry on his legacy.” Bunch oversaw an exhibition on lynching at the Chicago Historical Society before the Smithsonian beckoned him back to Washington once again.\n\nBuilding the National Museum of African American History and Culture\n\nBunch became the founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2005. The only problem was that there was no museum. Over the next 11 years he secured almost $600 million in public and private funds, hired Tanzanian-born architect David Adjaye to design a 400,000-square-foot (37,000-square-metre) building across the street from the Washington Monument, and secured more than 35,000 artifacts to put on display.\n\nBy his own admission, Bunch’s fingerprints are on every aspect of the museum, including the way visitors experience the exhibits. “I had never done a museum where you have a forced march,” Bunch said, referring to the path all museumgoers follow, starting with underground exhibits that tell the story of Blacks in Europe’s American colonies and the United States from the earliest days of slavery. When visitors emerge from those exhibits, they are welcomed into the museum’s Contemplative Court, where a cylindrical fountain gently rains into a pool. There are benches to sit on for quiet consideration of the exhibits just experienced. Quotations line the walls. Each was chosen by Bunch, including Sam Cooke’s iconic lyric “A change is gonna come.” When he recalled choosing that one, Bunch laughed deeply. “How could I not include Sam Cooke?”\n\nAmong the tens of thousands of artifacts collected for the museum, two hold special meaning for Bunch. First is the casket of Emmett Till, which Till’s family discovered had been discarded when his remains were exhumed and reburied in 2005. When Bunch learned that the family might donate it to the not-yet-opened museum, he recalled his meeting with Till’s mother: “I kept hearing Mamie Till-Mobley saying it was my turn to make sure Emmett was never forgotten.”\n\nThe other artifact Bunch cherishes most came to the museum by way of a phone call from Philadelphia historian Charles L. Blockson. “He called me and said if I came up to Philadelphia, he’d make it worth my while, so I went,” Bunch recounted to Britannica. When the two men met, Blockson showed Bunch pictures from Harriet Tubman’s funeral and a small hymnal that Tubman, though she couldn’t read, had carried with her throughout her life. “To this day, I can’t get over the fact that I’ve held in my hands Harriet Tubman’s hymnal,” Bunch said.\n\nThe museum’s eventual opening, in 2016, was a star-studded affair attended by Oprah Winfrey, Stevie Wonder, and scores of other celebrities. It was presided over by U.S. Pres. Barack Obama. The museum immediately became one of Washington’s most-visited attractions, to the delight of Bunch, who told The Washington Post, “I want to help the museums become as community-centered and as exciting to the public as the African American Museum is.”\n\nRunning the Smithsonian\n\nThe success of the NMAAHC led in 2019 to Bunch’s elevation to the secretaryship of the Smithsonian Institution. The first African American and the first historian to hold that post, he came to the job with big plans to modernize an institution founded in 1846 and to accelerate the development of its digital presence. Nine months after his appointment the COVID-19 pandemic hit. “I used to be known as the guy who created the African American History Museum. Now I’m known as the guy who closed the Smithsonian—TWICE,” Bunch said with a chuckle. All the museums having reopened by 2022, he sees his mission as finding “the right tension between tradition and innovation. Museums need to have a more contemporary resonance.” That must be done without losing what Bunch considers to be the essence of what he calls society’s most-trusted institutions: “The role of a museum is to define reality and to give hope.”"
