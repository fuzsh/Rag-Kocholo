        "text": "On the Road\n\nKerry Layton was hard to miss in the back bar of the Stone Pony.\n\nHe had a big handle-bar mustache that matched his overflowing enthusiasm for the music scene of Asbury Park. Layton passed away June 7 at his home in Deal, according to the city’s Buckley Funeral Home.\n\nHe was 70. A memorial for Layton will take place, in the back bar of the Stone Pony, from 6 to 9 p.m. on Thursday, June 20. Friends will remember the man known as the Ambassador of the Asbury Park music scene.\n\n“Even if I was having a bad night, he could almost always make me laugh,” said Asbury Park Press writer and music historian Jean Mikle. “I can’t tell you how many times he’d say to me, ‘Jean, this is a really special night here!’ And he meant it! The thing is, he had the exact same enthusiasm for the performers whether it was a popular national act or a local band just starting out. He also had an almost encyclopedic memory when it came to bands and songs. I was constantly asking him, who record that? And he would always know.”\n\nEileen Chapman, an Asbury Park city councilperson, first got to know Layton when she was the manager of the former Mrs. Jays Beer Garden, next to the Stone Pony, in the early 1980s.\n\n“We shared an interest in music and pop culture and those conversations were so much fun,” Chapman said. “He was so brilliant, intelligent and quick-witted.”\n\nWhen Chapman became the director of the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, she wanted to get Layton on the record.\n\n“Kerry was one of the people I reached out to to get that oral history,” Chapman said. “It was really important to have a fan’s perspective of what the music scene looked like through the years.”\n\nMore: New Jersey Hall of Fame 2019: Smithereens, Southside Johnny, George R.R.

I look at it now, and the way it’s come back is incredible. The community is bustling, and I couldn’t be happier about it. Asbury Park is a quirky town and I hope it continues to be.”\n\nLayton was a long-time lifeguard for Deal and Long Branch and a lifelong surfer. He was also a member of the Asbury Ushers, who worked the shows at the Paramount Theatre and Convention Hall. He’s survived by his mother Ginnie Layton, his brother Jeff Layton and sister Janine Layton Kimmel, and his beloved lifelong soul mate, Pam DeLisa, who is part of the group known as the Ambassadors, in the back bar of the Stone Pony.\n\n“His philosophical analysis of life was like no other, I loved hearing his Kerryism’s,” said Lynne Kirchdoerffer, founder of the Asbury Ushers. “I will miss him dearly.”\n\nLatin music, big Jersey stages\n\nThere are two Latin music superstars playing Jersey venues not normally associated with Latin music this summer.\n\nRomeo Santos, the King of Bachata, will headline MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford on Sept. 21. Santos, formerly of Aventura, will become the first Latin act to headline MetLife.\n\nTickets for what he’s calling “Utopia the Concert” begin at $80 and are on sale through Ticketmaster.\n\nBefore then, Gilberto Santa Rosa, aka the Gentleman of Salsa, plays the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park on Aug. 9 in an evening presented by the New Jersey Performing Arts Center of Newark. Tickets are on sale via Ticketmaster, starting at $49.50.\n\nHe’s celebrating his 40th year in the biz this year and opening up some new doors along the way.\n\nLBI music series\n\nAre you ready for another year of live music in Loveladies?\n\nFolk-rock troubadour Stephen Kellogg kicks off the third season of the Live Concert Series at the Long Beach Island Foundation for the Arts and Sciences in Loveladies with a 7:30 p.m. Thursday, June 13 performance.\n\nKellogg’s latest album, “Objects in the Mirror,” was likened to “John Prine fronting the Heartbreakers” by Rolling Stone. South Jersey singer-songwriter Sahara Moon is the opener. Tickets are $27.\n\nUpcoming shows in the series include folk-rock legend Steve Forbert at 8 p.m. Thursday, June 20. Tickets are $27.
