In America, Jerry Lewis is still an embarrassing and unexplained paradox, often ridiculed, awaiting a persuasive critical champion. This incredible gulf can in part be explained by American access, on television talk shows and Lewis's annual muscular dystrophy telethon, to Lewis's contradictory public persona: egotistical yet insecure, insulting yet sentimental, juvenile yet adult, emotionally naked yet defensive. Were not the real Lewis apparently so hard to love, the celluloid Lewis might be loved all the more. And yet a Lewis cult thrives among American cinephiles; and certainly The Bellboy, The Errand Boy, The Nutty Professor, and Which Way to the Front? appear today to be among the most interesting and ambitious American films of the 1960s.\n\nLewis's career can be divided into four periods: first, the partnership with singer Dean Martin, which resulted in a successful nightclub act and popular series of comedies, including My Friend Irma and At War with the Army, as well as several highly regarded films directed by former cartoonist and Lewis mentor Frank Tashlin; second (after professional and personal tensions fueled by Lewis's artistic ambitions irrevocably destroyed the partnership), an apprenticeship as a solo comedy star, beginning with The Delicate Delinquent and continuing through Tashlin's Cinderfella; third, the period as the self-professed \"total filmmaker,\" inaugurated in 1960 with The Bellboy and followed by a decade of Lewis films directed by and starring Lewis, which attracted the attention of auteurist critics in France and overwhelming box-office response in America, culminating with a string of well-publicized financial failures, including Which Way to the Front? and the unreleased, near-mythical The Day the Clown Cried, in which clown Lewis leads Jewish children to Nazi ovens; and finally, the period as valorized, if martyred auteur, exemplified by Lewis's work as an actor in Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy and Lewis's sporadic, unsuccessful attempts to reestablish his own directorial career. Lewis's appeal is significantly rooted in the American silent film tradition of the individual comedian: like Chaplin, Lewis is interested in pathos and sentiment; like Keaton, Lewis is fascinated by the comic gag which could only exist on celluloid; like Harry Langdon, Lewis exhibits, within an adult persona, childish behavior which is often disturbing and embarrassing; like Stan Laurel, whose first name Lewis adopts as an homage in several of his films, Lewis is the lovable innocent often endowed with almost magical qualities. What Lewis brings uniquely to this tradition, however, is his obsession with the concept of the schizophrenic self; his typical cinema character has so many anxieties and tensions that it must take on other personalities in order to survive. Often, the schizophrenia becomes overtly autobiographical, with the innocent, gawky kid escaping his stigmatized existence by literally becoming \"Jerry Lewis,\" beloved and successful comedian (as in The Bellboy and The Errand Boy) or romantic leading man, perhaps representing the now absent Dean Martin (as in The Nutty Professor). Jerry Lewis's physical presence on screen in his idiot persona emphasizes movement disorders in a way which relates provocatively to his highly publicized work for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Schizophrenia is compounded in The Family Jewels: what Jean-Pierre Coursodon calls Lewis's \"yearning for self-obliteration\" is manifested in seven distinct personalities. Ultimately, Lewis escapes by turning himself into his cinema, as evidenced by the credits in his failed comeback film, which proudly announce: \"Jerry Lewis is . . . Hardly Working.\" This element of cinematic escape and schizophrenia is especially valued by the French, who politicize it as a manifestation of the human condition as influenced by American capitalism.\n\nMuch must also be said about the strong avant-garde qualities to Lewis's work: his interest in surrealism; his experimentalism and fascination with self-conscious stylistic devices; his movement away from conventional gags toward structures apparently purposely deformed; his interest in plotlessness and ellipsis; the reflexivity of his narrative; his studied use of extended silence and gibberish in a sound cinema; the ambiguous sexual subtext of his work; and finally, his use of film as personal revelation.\n\nThe last decade has seen a slight diminution of Lewis's reputation as a director (Lewis having directed television situation comedies, but no features), but an augmentation of his reputation as an actor and icon. His King of Comedy appearance now seems definitely a major performance in the American cinema, as does the Scorsese film a major statement about the American lust for celebrity. Ever since that film, a variety of younger directors have used Lewis as icon and/or as reflexive comment on the Lewis career. Perhaps Lewis's most interesting showcase is his 1995 performance as a Las Vegas comedian in Funny Bones, directed by Peter Chelsom. It is hard not to see Funny Bones as a deadly look at the Las Vegas side of the Lewis persona, complete with the jazzy Sinatra score and the institutional insincerity: Lewis is the funny father who overshadows his psychologically wounded and relatively untalented son, his own celebrity having a dark, depressing underside and a deleterious effect on family life.\n\nLewis as George Fawkes admits that he was not true to his talent and confesses, \"It kills me that I used writers, instead of using me.\" The film's philosophy—\"I never saw anything funny that wasn't terrible, that didn't cause pain\"—seems a natural segue to other recent events in the Lewis life: his autobiography, written in 1982, chronicled, among other things, his addiction to Percodan and his driven personality. His ex-wife, Patti Lewis, followed with her own autobiography—whose title tells it all: I Laffed 'til I Cried: Thirty-six Years of Marriage to Jerry Lewis. And although Lewis has dedicated his life to raising hundreds of millions of dollars for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, he has been virulently attacked by many adults with the disease—particularly in 1992 and 1993—who claim he publicly demonstrates a patronizing, demeaning attitude and exploits them with a pity which makes their lives in society harder, not easier. Lewis responded by attacking his accusers equally virulently, thus creating great pathos and bitterness all around: yet another fold in that seamless garment which is Lewis's life and art. Comic performances in films by younger French directors added little to Lewis's reputation, but a recurring role in the TV series Wiseguy in 1989 and a triumphant Broadway appearance as the devil in Damn Yankees in 1995, which reprised all his \"Jerry Lewis\" shtick, have been well received. Perhaps only Lewis's death will allow any definitive American evaluation of his substantial career.\n\n—Charles Derry\n\nLEWIS, Jerry\n\nNationality: American.

While other comedians such as Abbott & Costello (even The Three Stooges) who were similarly dismissed by contemporary reviewers but have since achieved a degree of artistic respectability—in some quarters, more than that—with the passage of time, Lewis has yet to experience such reappraisal. He remains more honored in Europe—especially France, although Germany and Spain have showered him with honors, too—than at home despite a career as prolific in its output as those of his more esteemed comic colleagues.\n\nThe reason for this may be that Lewis's style of comedy—which, in its post-Dean Martin period, focused almost exclusively on Lewis himself, almost never the characters or events surrounding him—strikes people as self-indulgent, self-centered, even egotistical; this is a major turnoff, particularly to critics. Also, the screen character he created and lavished so much attention on—the child who never grew up, a mugging simpleton Lewis dubbed \"the Kid\"—is very much an acquired taste. Children, especially young tots, find the character amusingly simpatico. But many older viewers, from age 20 on, find it forced, grating, shallow, stupid, and excruciatingly witless.\n\nLewis began his career as a borscht belt comedian and impersonator of well-known singers of the day whose voices and mannerisms he mimicked to the accompaniment of recordings. His career was going nowhere until a chance meeting with a crooner named Dean Martin, whose career was likewise stalled, led to their teaming up. Their mostly improvised act involved Lewis's manic attempts to destroy Martin's numbers by breaking him up on-stage. It was audiences who broke up; within months, Martin & Lewis was the hottest comedy team in show business. Word spread, Hollywood called, and Martin & Lewis made their screen debut low down in the cast list of My Friend Irma, a comedy based on a hit radio show of the time. The team essentially reprised its stage act in the film. Audiences felt they stole the picture, a hit, which was followed by a sequel, My Friend Irma Goes West, in which the duo was top-billed with stars John Lund and Marie Wilson. Signed to a long-term contract by Paramount, Martin & Lewis starred in more than a dozen wildly popular comedies for the studio until their celebrated split in 1956 following the appropriately titled Hollywood or Bust. Many believed their Hollywood careers would go bust without each other, but Martin & Lewis proved them wrong. Martin went on to achieve a successful solo career as a singer, actor, and television star. After The Delicate Delinquent, his first film without Martin (in which Darren McGavin stepped into the Martin straight man role), Lewis decided he no longer needed a straight man for his antics, and went solo himself.\n\nLewis's disenchantment with the nature of the team's screen persona was among the stated reasons for the break-up. Critic David Thomson has described the persona as that of \". . . two men at odds: Lewis seems hurt by Martin's callousness, just as Martin seems offended by the proximity of a slob.\" As the team's films progressed, Martin's suave and sophisticated character seemed to become increasingly scornful and unscrupulously manipulative of Lewis's nitwit character, whose antics escalated into an insufferably annoying plague on both their houses. But some critics have voiced another possible reason for the split: Lewis's ambivalent desire to be like Martin and simultaneous hostility toward him. These critics have pointed to Lewis's The Nutty Professor (1963) as a not-so-subtle expression of this inner war. In the film—a comic take on Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde that Lewis starred in, co-wrote and directed—he plays a nerdy, lovesick chemistry professor in the \"Kid\" mold and the alter-ego he unleashes with his magic formula: suave singer and lounge lizard Buddy Love, a character viewed as a vicious takeoff on Martin. Later, in Boeing, Boeing, a romantic farce co-starring Tony Curtis, Lewis ironically played the more subdued, straight man role, a role Dean Martin could easily have stepped in himself, so there may be some validity to the critics' assessment.\n\nLewis's most important collaboration after the break-up with Martin was with Frank Tashlin, a former Warner Brothers cartoon director turned feature filmmaker, whose satiric style and eye for the cartoonlike, belly-laugh sight gag strongly influenced Lewis's subsequent career and own directorial approach. Lewis made two films for Tashlin with Martin (Artists and Models, Hollywood or Bust) and six without, arguably the best of which is Rock-a-Bye-Baby (1958), a remake of the Preston Sturges classic The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944).\n\nLewis turned to directing with The Bellboy (1960), hailed by French critics as Lewis's breakthrough film and funniest movie to date. It was quickly followed by The Ladies' Man and The Errand Boy (both 1961), then The Nutty Professor, which the French named the best picture of the year and Lewis's masterpiece—his intervening films with Tashlin notwithstanding. By 1965, Lewis was being deified by the French as the greatest comic artist since Buster Keaton, an inapt comparison on a number of levels. For one thing, Lewis's increasing penchant for inserting pathos and the occasional \"message\" into his work was less like Keaton than Chaplin, whose career Lewis seemed bent most in emulating. Unlike Chaplin, however, Lewis's scenes of pathos tend to be more mawkish than tear-jerkingly sentimental.\n\nLewis's The Day the Clown Cried (1972), a seriocomic look at the Holocaust from the perspective of a Jewish comic imprisoned in a Nazi death camp, remains his most ambitious attempt to emulate Chaplin. Whether he succeeded or not we still do not know as the film has yet to be released due to legal entanglements with its backers. The debacle apparently crushed Lewis's spirits for a time; he did not make another film until 1979's aptly titled Hardly Working, a critically scorned (in America) but commercial hit.\n\nSince then, Lewis has chosen to remain in the public mind primarily as host of the Labor Day Muscular Dystrophy Telethon, an annual charitable rite with which he has been associated for years. His film performances have mostly been for other directors, the most notable being Martin Scorsese, in whose 1983 The King of Comedy Lewis undertook his first dramatic role as a late night television talk show entertainer in the vein of Johnny Carson stalked by an ambitious fan. Lewis's performance garnered well-deserved accolades not just in France, but, at last, in the United States as well. In 1995 he made his Broadway debut as the devil in a revival of the musical comedy Damn Yankees and was similarly acclaimed. Perhaps these two atypical roles, and the impressive kudos he received for his performances in them, auger better things to come for the indominatable \"Kid\" in his native land.\n\n—John McCarty\n\nLEWIS, Jerry\n\n(b. 16 March 1926 in Newark, New Jersey), comedian, actor, philanthropist, filmmaker, and auteur who morphed during the 1960s from a nerdy sidekick into an artiste, the darling of French intelligentsia and their \"Sacred Monster.\"\n\nLewis, born Jerome (some sources say Joseph) Levitch, was the only child of Daniel Levitch, an actor, and Rae Brodsky, a pianist and actor. Lewis's parents were a show business couple that performed professionally as Danny and Rae Lewis. Young Lewis made his debut at a benefit in the Catskills in 1932 with a poignant rendition of \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" He was just six years old. Hooked on entertainment, Lewis left Irvington High School at the age of sixteen. He developed a \"bit\" that was part Charlie McCarthy (the dummy prop of the comedian Edgar Bergen) and part Al Jolson (a vaudeville performer and early movie star), in which he would mime to music with exaggerated, spastic movements. Though nurtured in the Borscht Belt environs of Jewish humor in upstate New York, the young comic quite deliberately de-emphasized his background in order to reach a wider audience. Although eager to serve in World War II, Lewis was declared unfit for service because of a perforated eardrum and a heart murmur.\n\nAfter a floundering apprenticeship as a \"hack\" comic, Lewis hit pay dirt in the summer of 1946 at Atlantic City, New Jersey, when he joined the actor and singer Dean Martin to form America's most dynamic comedic duo since Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. Based on the best Borscht Belt tradition of doing anything for a laugh, the comic and the crooner fed off each other's shtick. They became an instant hit. Jew and Italian, putz and playboy, the duet played to packed audiences in nightclubs and theaters, especially New York's Paramount. They moved on to boxoffice bonanzas in Hollywood and enormous success on television, America's \"tube of plenty.\" Together they starred in seventeen films, which earned millions for Paramount Pictures. According to the biographer Nick Tosches, Lewis and Martin's ability to cross boundaries—between masculine and feminine, straight and gay, adult and child—provided a much-needed escape from cold war anxieties, while sustaining male camaraderie forged during World War II. Lewis conceded that he \"kept the child in me alive. I'm nine and I've always been nine since 1935 and I will always be nine.\"\n\nLewis married the nightclub singer Patti Palmer, six years his senior, on 3 October 1944. They had five sons and adopted another, but their marriage—plagued by the comic's imperious manner and frequent infidelities—ended in divorce in 1982. One year later, on 13 February 1983, Lewis married Sandra (\"San Dee\") Pitnick, with whom he had been romantically linked. They adopted a daughter in 1992.\n\nIn 1956 a discontented Martin bolted after their last film, Hollywood or Bust. On 25 July 1956 Lewis and Martin made their final stage appearance at the Copacabana club in New York City, ten years to the day after their first team performance. After the split Martin thrived as a singer and actor, while his erstwhile partner was \"All Alone\" by the Irving Berlin telephone. Lewis refocused his energies as an actor, writer, director, and singer. Prodded by the singer Judy Garland, Lewis even sang solo. In fact, his first recording, Jerry Lewis Just Sings (1956), was a best-selling album, and his single \"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby\" sold more than a million copies in the late 1950s. Inspired by the songs of Jolson and the films of Charlie Chaplin, the young artist branched out in the halcyon 1960s to essay the varied roles of a \"Renaissance man.\"\n\nLewis's career peaked during the 1960s. He made seventeen films, including several gems, namely, The Bellboy and Cinderfella (1960), The Ladies Man and The Errand Boy (1961), and The Patsy (1964). Chaplin hailed The Bellboy as a work of genius. It paid homage to the silent movie clowns Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Drawing on his Catskills experience, Lewis identified with the silent working class and crafted a comic character—Stanley—in opposition to an oppressive society. The other movies proved less popular and profitable, with the exception of The Nutty Professor (1963), which showed his talents as writer, director, and performer. Derived from the polar personas of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the film projected two sides of Lewis's personality, the introverted intellectual Julius Kelp and the chemically charged, ebullient Buddy Love. Although most fans believed that the movie caricatured his former partner, Dean Martin, Lewis claimed that it actually highlighted his own dark side.\n\nBy the mid-1960s Lewis was up against the creative wall. An ambitious attempt to emulate the British actor Sir Alec Guinness (in Kind Hearts and Coronets, 1949), by impersonating seven characters in search of a legacy in The Family Jewels (1965), flopped. In that same year Lewis suffered a freak accident in an appearance on The Andy Williams Show, which resulted in a linear skull fracture. This injury precipitated severe disability and constant pain—alleviated only by powerful painkillers. Lewis admitted later that he suffered from a long-term drug dependency on Percodan, an addiction he finally broke in 1979. In 1965 Lewis left Paramount for Columbia Pictures, where he continued to write, direct, and produce films that earned diminishing profits. Evidently, Lewis was out of synch with 1960s youth culture. Lewis tried in vain to stay current, even singing with his rock star son Gary, but the older Lewis could not keep the beat of Gary Lewis and the Playboys.\n\nLewis's burst of creativity in the 1960s endeared him to the mandarins of French culture. The moviemaker Jean Luc Godard \"dug\" his movies, as the slang of the day put it. Jack Lang dubbed him \"a child's friend and a model for adults.\" Lewis even taught a graduate course in film direction at the University of Southern California (USC) in 1967, where he was a professor of cinema arts. Hundreds of students flocked to this course; among them, the film-makers George Lukas, Francis Ford Coppola, Randy Klieser, Peter Bogdanovich, and Steven Spielberg. Out of this heady experience issued a text, aptly titled: The TotalFilm-Maker (1971). Lewis also helped raise enormous sums for charity. He is a spokesperson for the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), a charity that he has been involved with since the 1940s. In 1966 Lewis began annual television appeals for MDA that were broadcast over the Labor Day weekend. The MDA Telethon yearly netted increasing amounts of money: $1.25 million in 1967, $1.4 million in 1968, $2.04 million in 1969, and $5.09 million at the decade's end.\n\nLionized abroad, Lewis floundered at home. In January 1957 he launched a series of specials for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) dubbed The Jerry Lewis Show. Only moderately successful, they were superceded by a disastrous switch to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1963. A hybrid of talk and variety, the two-hour The Jerry Lewis Show appeared live on Saturday evenings. After thirteen shows the series ended on 25 December 1963. Lewis blamed the sponsors and affiliates. A comeback attempt on ABC on 12 September 1967 proved equally dismal. A stage version of Hellzapoppin' in 1976 never reached Broadway. Most painful, however, was the failure of his pet film project, The Day the Clown Cried (1972), which remained incomplete and unreleased. Evidently seeking to reconnect with his Jewish roots and to regain his golden touch at the movie box office, Lewis unhappily succumbed to bathos, banality, and litigation.\n\nLewis's work for the MDA earned him a nomination, courtesy of Congressman Les Aspin, for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977. Frank Krutnick insightfully locates the roots of Lewis's philanthropy. Empowered and impassioned with the rhetoric of love, often absent from his formative years, Lewis is the mediating father figure who \"rages, cries, pleads, and cajoles on behalf of the victim-child against the villain of disease.\" Lewis transforms fear and guilt into love—a precious kind of love that is measured in money. On 3 September the 2001 MDA Telethon raised $56.7 million for medical research. The telethon was carried on more than two hundred television stations and viewed by more than seventy-five million people in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.\n\nLewis's artistic regeneration began after a near fatal heart attack in December 1982, with a stunning performance in Martin Scorcese's The King of Comedy (1983). In a strikingly understated performance, he played Jerry Langford, who personified the many faces—in the apposite French designation—of the \"Sacred Monster.\" His impersonation of Applegate, the Devil, in the 1995–1997 stage revival of Damn Yankees also elicited rave reviews. Lewis's films garnered more than $800 million at a time when most ticket prices were less than one dollar. Remakes of his best films, plus his prolific output of sixty-three films as an actor, seventeen as a director, fourteen as a producer, and eleven as a writer assure Lewis a place in our national pantheon.\n\nLewis's autobiography, written with Herb Gluck, is Jerry Lewis in Person (1984). A collection of Lewis's insights on filmmaking is in his book The Total Film-Maker (1971). Biographies of Lewis include Richard Gehman, That Kid—The Story of Jerry Lewis (1964); Patti Lewis, I Laffed Till I Cried: Thirty-Six Years of Marriage to Jerry Lewis (1993); and Shawn Levy, King of Comedy: The Life and Art of Jerry Lewis (1996). Biographical information is also in Nick Tosches's biography of Dean Martin, Dino: Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams (1992); James L. Neibaur and Ted Okuda, The Jerry Lewis Films: An Analytical Filmography of the Innovative Comic (1995); Frank Krutnik, Inventing Jerry Lewis (2000); and Rae Beth Gordon, Why the French Love Jerry Lewis: From Cabaret to Early Cinema (2001).\n\nJoseph Dorinson"
