        "text": "The obituary read “We are sad to announce that on October 17, 2022, at age 101, Leo J. Dolan passed away.\n\n“He was predeceased by his wife Eleanor Getz Dolan, his daughter Beth Dolan, and his former wife Isabel Mansfield Dolan. He is survived by his children, Charles, Leo Jr., Thomas, Joseph, Claire Baylor, Jeannie Dunn, Eleanor Connelly, and Ann Clark. He also is survived by 23 grandchildren and 37 great-grandchildren.\n\n“A viewing was held on Thursday and Friday October 20th- October 21st. A mass of Christian burial was held on Friday morning at St. John Vianney Church, Gladwyne. Burial followed at Calvary Cemetery.”\n\nIronically only 101 words of record for a life well-lived.\n\nFlashback 101 years ago:\n\nIn 1921, the world saw innovations in health, science, and education, including the first vaccination against tuberculosis. The world also faced repercussions of the First World War (the Leipzig War Crimes Trials began in Germany) along with other wars like the Irish War of Independence, revolutions, uprisings, riots, and strikes.\n\nInsulin was discovered by researchers at the University of Toronto. The first birth control clinic opened in the British Empire.\n\nAdolf Hitler becomes Chairman of the Nazi Party in his rise to power in Germany. Franklin D. Roosevelt, at age 39, contracts polio. The Communist Party of China is formed with Mao Tso-tung (Zedong) as a founding member.\n\nThe first radio baseball game was broadcast in Pittsburgh and the first radio broadcast of a World Series game aired in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nAnd Leo J. Dolan was born (June 13) in Philadelphia.\n\nFast forward to 1948:\n\nMoviegoers across the nation were stepping into “The Red Shoes” of Moira Shearer, joining Bob Hope and Bing Crosby on “The Road to Rio,” and strutting with Judy Garland and Fred Astaire in the “Easter Parade.”\n\nIn the real world, Myanmar, Israel, and North Korea were established as independent states, NATO was formed, the Soviet Union blockaded West Berlin, and apartheid became the rule in South Africa.\n\nCloser to home, residents of the Main Line were living in a fast-paced post-war society where technology, fashion, housing, and lifestyles were changing faster than the costumes of a burlesque headliner.\n\nThe average wage per year was $2950, the cost of a new house was $7700, a new car went for $1250, a gallon of gas poured in at 16 cents, a loaf of bread sliced the wallet for 14 cents, and a two- pound bag of coffee perked at 85 cents.\n\nDuring that era, service clubs like the Lions, the Optimists, the Rotary and Kiwanis populated the landscape. Young businesspeople flocked to those clubs throughout the Main Line for regular fellowship and community service to charitable causes in their neighborhoods and the world at large.\n\nAmong young men who became members of The Kiwanis Club of Main Line (the club was chartered in 1926) was Leo J. Dolan, a 27-year-old jeweler in Bryn Mawr.\n\nLeo was inspired to join the club by the Six Objects (values) of the organization: 1) To give primacy to the human and spiritual, rather than the material values of life. 2) To encourage the daily living of The Golden Rule in all human relationships. 3) To promote the adoption and the application of higher social, business, and professional standards. 4) To develop by precept and example a more intelligent, aggressive, and serviceable citizenship. 5) To provide a practical means to form enduring friendships, to render altruistic service, and build better communities, and 6) To cooperate in creating and maintaining the sound public opinion and high idealism which makes possible the increase of righteousness, justice, patriotism, and goodwill.\n\nThrough more than seven decades, Leo committed his time, skills, and energy to carrying out the mission of Kiwanis and being true to those values within the club and in the community-at-large.\n\nAt a celebration of Leo’s 70th year in Kiwanis (2018) Rosemont attorney and club member, Ed Heins, said:\n\n“Giving Leo a gold watch would be gilding the lily. Instead, we’re presenting him a plaque that embodies sentiments of our membership in recognizing Leo’s untiring dedication to bringing new members into the club, organizing and taking part in hundreds of activities throughout the years, and for helping grow our trust fund (for the benefit of a variety of local charities and causes for needy children) by initiating and holding an annual benefit pro-am golf tournament at St. Davids Golf Club as well as championing the club’s Rose Sale every fall. (Ironically, this year’s sale took place the day of Leo’s visitation.)\n\nIn addition to his commitment to Kiwanis, Leo, who was a resident at Beamont in Bryn Mawr, was a lifetime member of St. Davids Golf Club, and among its better golfers. Even in his early 90s, he was known to win more than his share of rounds there. And he held his own at the club’s card tables, as well. He also was a member of the Knights of Columbus, American Legion Merion Post #545, and the Navy League.\n\nA 1939 graduate of Roman Catholic High School (and captain of the track team,) Leo served in the US Navy during World War II and returned from the war to attend Wharton Evening School of Accounts & Finance at the University of Pennsylvania, completing the program in 1948, the same year he joined Kiwanis.\n\nFor many years, he was co-owner, and later owner, at Diesinger & Dolan Jewelers, (one of the first stores in Ardmore’s Suburban Square opened in 1938). Leo purchased the business in 1953 and moved it to Bryn Mawr, eventually selling the firm to his son, Charles, about a dozen years ago\n\nLeo would travel internationally to purchase distinctive pieces and redesign them for contemporary buyers. In 1957, Leo formed a subsidiary called Coronation Cultured Pearls. The firm manufactured fine pearl jewelry available at quality retailers around the country. On a trip to Argentina in 1959 he purchased most of the jewelry collection of Eva Peron.\n\nHe made numerous trips to Japan to buy quality pearls for his store and formed friendships with several Japanese families in the jewelry market (even staying in their homes on these extended trips) and became known locally as “Mr. Pearl.”\n\nA long-time active supporter of various Catholic charities, Leo kept a life-long fondness in his heart for Roman Catholic High School in Center City, and his family has requested that legacy donations to “Roman” (the first free diocesan high school for boys in the nation) be made in Leo’s memory.\n\nJust a few more than 1001 words in honor of a life well lived. May Leo’s soul rest in peace.\n\n********\n\nThe Last Word: Good day, good luck, and good news tomorrow!\n\nComments invited to mainlinebanter@verizon.net"
