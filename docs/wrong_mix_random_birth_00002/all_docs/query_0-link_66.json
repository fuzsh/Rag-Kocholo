Mean Girl: The Musical movie will premiere and the phenomenal cast will finally show how amazing they all are! Leading the pack is the shooting star that is Renee Rapp (@reneerapp)!\n\nShow/Movie: Mean Girls: The Musical\nSong: “Meet the Plastics”\n\nMean Girls is a musical with music by Jeff Richmond, lyrics by Nell Benjamin, and a book by Tina Fey. It is based on the 2004 film of the same name written by Fey, which in turn was based on the 2002 book Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman. The musical premiered at the National Theatre, Washington, D.C., in October 2017 and opened on Broadway in April 2018 at the August Wilson Theatre. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show played its final performance on Broadway on March 11, 2020.\n\nA film adaptation of the musical is set to be released theatrically in January 2024 by Paramount Pictures. Arturo Perez and Samantha Jayne directed the film, with Tina Fey returning to write the screenplay. Jeff Richmond and lyricist Nell Benjamin also returned to rework their songs from the stage musical. It features an ensemble cast that includes Angourie Rice as Cady, Auliʻi Cravalho as Janis, Christopher Briney as Aaron, Jaquel Spivey as Damian, Bebe Wood as Gretchen, and Avantika Vandanapu as Karen. Reneé Rapp, who previously portrayed Regina George as a replacement for Louderman in the musical from 2019 until its closure in 2020, reprises her role, while Fey and Tim Meadows reprise their roles from the original film. Ashley Park, who originated the role of Gretchen in the musical, makes a cameo in the film.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nWhat are your favorite Broadway memories of Mean Girls?!\n\n#meangirls #meangirlsday #meangirlsbroadway #meangirlsonbroadway #meangirlsbroadwaymemories #meangirlsthemovie #meangirlsmovie #meangirlsthemusical #meangirlsmusical #reneerapp #reneérapp #reginageorge #meettheplastics #mynameisreginageorge #gretchenweiners #karensmith #cadyheron #tinafey #jaquelspivey #auliicravalho #broadway #broadwaymusical #broadwaymusicals #broadwaytheatre #broadwaytheater #broadwayshow #theatre #theater #showtune #broadwaymemories\".",
