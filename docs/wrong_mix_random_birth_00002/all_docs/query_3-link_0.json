        "text": "In the early 1960s, Judy Garland enjoyed a golden era that was an unprecedented career renaissance.\n\nIn 1960, Judy was counted out. She had just survived a horrible bout with hepatitis. It was so serious that doctors told her she would never perform again but she miraculously bounced back. By the middle of 1960, she was back on the concert trail with a renewed vigor and a profound change in her voice making it (as if it wasn’t amazing, to begin with), more electrifying than ever before.\n\n1961 saw Judy reach her apex with her instantly legendary concert at Carnegie Hall. From there she conquered TV with her now-classic series, “The Judy Garland Show” while also becoming a favorite on the talk show circuit. In spite of the short success of her TV series and the four films she made before the middle of the decade (five films if you count her vocal-only one solo in Pepe), she always returned to her first true love, the stage.\n\nUnfortunately, by the middle of the decade, Judy had suffered a near-death experience that almost destroyed her already weakened system, and did permanent damage to her voice. Ever the trouper, she carried on and in spite of the unwanted change in her voice she nevertheless still cast her mesmerizing spell on audiences around the world.\n\nMuch of the information and media on this page was provided by many wonderful Garland fans as well as from the collection of the author plus the many biographies and other books about Judy Garland, her peers, and film studies in general.\n\nA big shout out to Scott Schechter’s still invaluable 2002 book “Judy Garland – The Day-by-Day Chronicle of a Legend” as well as newspaper online archives.\n\nJanuary 2, 1960: Judy was still convalescing from her bout with hepatitis when she signed a contract with Random House, to write her autobiography. Titled “The Judy Garland Story,” the book was to be a collaboration with Fred Finklehoffe. Finklehoffe had written the screenplays for some of Judy’s greatest films including Babes on Broadway, For Me And My Gal, Girl Crazy, and Meet Me In St. Louis. Judy was paid an advance of $35,000, and she and Finklehoffe recorded their sessions on audiotape some of which have survived, listen to some of those recordings here.\n\nOn September 26, 1960, Bennett Cerf of Random House wrote a letter printed in the fan publication “Garland Gazette” that said Random House had “not yet seen one line of [the] manuscript of the Judy Garland autobiography. I have been assured that we will have half of the manuscript within a month’s time.”\n\nA partial manuscript was eventually produced, totaling 65 pages, and it contains frank observations and startling revelations, including the following: Judy knew she was an “unwanted” (unplanned) baby, and she received a great amount of psychological abuse from her mother and the man who became her stepfather who had taunted and laughed at Judy together, with Ethel (Judy’s mom) at one point telling Judy that she had been born with a defective brain. Although Judy admitted that she loved Ethel and that “she was always doing things . . . which made me love her so much, but at the same time I was afraid of her. At any time, in the middle of a great kindness or loud laughter, she was capable of saying something or doing something that would scare me to death.” Judy also talked candidly about her attempts to rid herself of the medications she was on; the men at the studio who made advances on her; and most astonishingly, about the abortion she had when she was twenty. However, the book would not continue after a certain stage, as Judy felt too good and happy to look back.\n\nOn January 5, 1960, Judy was released from the Doctor’s Hospital (see photo) in New York City and immediately returned home to California. Lucky for Judy (and her fans), she rallied and fully recovered. During this time she was also nearly free of all medications aside for a prescribed dose of Ritalin.\n\nJudy rested with her only work being her recording the song “The Faraway Part of Town” for the movie Pepe (her first film work since 1954’s A Star Is Born) in April 1960. On June 8, 1960, Judy was back at the Capitol Records studios in Hollywood recording the album “That’s Entertainment!” This was Judy’s first major work since her bout with hepatitis and she’s in glorious voice.\n\nOn July 10, 1960, Judy attended, along with Sammy Davis Jr., Frank Sinatra, Milton Berle, Tony Martin, George Jessel, and other celebrities, the Democratic fundraiser at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. The fundraiser was for her friend, John F. Kennedy, who would soon become President. Some film footage exists, see the video below.\n\nJudy traveled to England on July 14, 1960, then on August 3, she had the first of five sessions for Capitol (EMI in England) at their London studios. The recordings made between August 3, 1960, and August 8, 1960, were intended to be released as a two-LP set featuring new stereo studio recordings of many of her concert songs and other Garland standards. Those recordings became known as “The London Sessions.”\n\nMost of the recordings stayed in the vaults due to “Judy at Carnegie Hall” being such a huge success in 1961. The label didn’t think an album that contained most of the same songs (although they were studio versions and not live) would not sell well or it might impede the sales of the Carnegie album.\n\nSix tracks from these sessions appeared without explanation on the 1962 album, “The Garland Touch.” All of the recordings were released in 1972 on a special set released by the Capitol Record Club to members only, titled “Judy in London” which was re-released in 1980 on a Capitol Records “Special Markets” release.\n\nIn 1991, they were remastered and released to the general public all together for the first time as part of the CD boxed set “The One And Only” followed by a single CD release in 1992 simply titled “The London Sessions.” They have since been remastered again and released in 2011 on the 2-CD set “The London Studio Recordings 1957-1964.”\n\nFebruary 7, 1963\n\nHARRAH’S RESORT, LAKE TAHOE, NEVADA\n\nJudy opened a scheduled three-week engagement of her “mini-concert” (approximately an hour long) similar to her show at the Sahara in Las Vegas in 1962. Mort Lindsey was again Judy’s conductor.\n\nJudy’s song list (in order): “Hello, Bluebird,” “Almost Like Being N Love”/”This Can’t Be Love,” “Do It Again,” “Never Will I Marry,” “As Long As He Needs Me,” “Judy’s Olio,” “By Myself,” “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby,” “San Francisco.” This was the debut of Judy’s version of “As Long As He Needs Me.”\n\nJudy canceled the February 11th show but returned on the 12th. On the 13th she collapsed before going on stage and on the morning of the 14th she was taken by ambulance to the hospital at Carson City. That afternoon she went to the hospital administrator saying she was fine and she returned to Tahoe for a “quiet Valentine’s Day party” with her children. Judy’s visit to the hospital resulted in the hospital hiring extra staff to handle the flood of calls that came in from Judys ans and the media!\n\nOn February 15, 1963, in spite of Judy announcing that she was feeling better, the Harrah’s management let her out of her contract. It was obvious that she was suffering from total exhaustion. Judy’s pal mickey Rooney came in to complete the engagement. Judy saying in Tahoe an extra day with husband Sid Luft with whom she had been separated from. Luft had come in on the 13th and he and Judy reconciled. they left Tahoe on the 17th for a few days in Las Vegas then to San Francisco for a “reconciliation/honeymoon” at the Fairmont Hotel.\n\n“THE JUDY GARLAND SHOW”\n\nIn late May 1963, Judy Garland went out to Los Angeles to begin work on her TV series debut, “The Judy Garland Show” produced by CBS-TV. The show was videotaped at CBS Television City in Hollywood.\n\nThe taping of the first episode on June 24, 1963, was a star-studded event. In the audience were such stars as Lucille Ball, Natalie Wood, Dick Van Dyke, Jack Benny, Clint Eastwood, Agnes Moorhead, Van Heflin, and both of Hollywood’s great columnists, Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, among others.\n\nJudy’s guest for her first show was her old chum Mickey Rooney. Although the show was the first one taped, it was not the first to air. It was originally broadcast on December 8, 1963.\n\n“The Judy Garland Show” premiered on September 29, 1963 at 9 p.m. eastern standard time. The premiere episode was actually the seventh to be taped, “Episode Seven.” Judy’s guest was Donald O’Connor. Although the show was off to a great start, it was almost doomed from the beginning. It was aired against the powerhouse #1 show at that time, “Bonanza” which handicapped it from the start. To further complicate matters, the initial format of the show wasn’t popular with viewers. Judy’s ‘second banana” Jerry Van Dyke (brother of Dick Van Dyke), proved to be a mistake.\n\nThe CBS network execs seem to have it in for Judy. They changed the format, changed directors and other key personnel, and lost all interest in doing anything to save it. On the flip side, critics audiences liked the show, especially once it hit its stride. If the network had moved air date to a different night of the week and had any confidence it it, the show would have lasted more than one season of 26 episodes. Over the years the show, which had some of the best production values of the time, has become a classic. To Judy’s credit, she worked hard to make it a success and never faltered. All of the episodes and most of the outtakes survive and have been released in pristine quality on DVD.\n\nThroughout the 26 episodes Judy is given the chance to perform many songs she hadn’t performed before as well as crowd favorites from the great Garland catalog. She was also paired with the best in show business, including: Lena Horne, Peggy Lee, Barbra Streisand, Tony Bennett, Vic Damone, Chita Rivera, Diahann Carroll, Martha Raye, Jack Jones, Count Basie, Jane Powell, June Allyson, Ethel Merman, Peter Lawford, Rich Little, Louis Jourdan, Steve Lawrence, Ray Bolger, The Smothers Brothers, Steve Allen, Mel Torme, Dick Shawn, and daughter Liza Minnelli.\n\nTYPHOON VIOLA IN HONG KONG AND BRUSH WITH DEATH\n\nAfter the disaster in Melbourne, Judy and Mark Herron flew to Sydney then to Hong Kong where they checked into the Mandarin Hotel.\n\nA few days later, on May 28, Typhoon Viola hit Hong Kong which made the hotel sway and shake. At some point in the early morning hours of May 29, with the typhoon still raging, Judy took an overdose of pills. She was found by Herron who rushed her, through the typhoon, three blocks to the Catholic Hospital, the Canossa Hospital. Judy’s stomach was pumped and in the process, the tubes damaged her vocal cords. She was in a coma for 15 hours. A valve in her oxygen tent broke and before it was fixed Judy hadn’t moved so a nurse claimed that Judy had died. The news spread around the world like wildfire. Luckily Judy survived, but just barely. She had pleurisy in both lungs and her throat and heart were damaged. Because of the damage to her vocal cords, she was told not to sing for a year.\n\nWhen Judy came out of her coma she learned that her sister, “Susie” (Mary Jane Gumm), had committed suicide the previous Tuesday (May 26th) in Las Vegas. The newspapers reported that she died from “a chronic infection of the pancreas” as told by her friend, John Morrissey, at whose home she succeeded in taking her life. Sister “Jimmie” (Dorothy Virginia Gumm) later stated: “It was a sordid domestic mess. Living in Las Vegas, that’s not a particularly tranquil atmosphere – the gambling, the girls, the temptations – that was the end for her. She went the sleeping pill route. Somehow the Garland females can’t stand the loss of love.” Judy did not address it publicly but it’s assumed that, naturally, she took the news badly. As with her relationship with her mother, Judy’s relationships with her two sisters were complicated and although she had some contact with Susie in the early 1960s Jimmie had broken ties with Judy over Judy’s behavior towards their mother, Ethel, and towards Susie.\n\nJudy’s doctor in California, Lee Siegel, flew to Hong Kong on May 30th accompanied by her road manager/CMA agent Karl Brent. Judy was released from the hospital on June 1st. She stayed in Hong Kong convalescing for the early part of June. In early June Judy was well enough to go to the Starlight Room in Hong Kong where she saw “The Allen Brothers” featuring Peter Allen for the first time. Judy also sang that night in spite of the fact that she was still recuperating from the vocal cord damage. Singing just a week or so out from that damaging incident most likely damaged her voice even more.\n\nOn June 11, Judy and Herron boarded the President Roosevelt ocean liner bound for Tokyo. While onboard, they were allegedly married by a Buddhist priest in spite of the fact that Judy’s divorce from Sid Luft wasn’t final, and wouldn’t be finale until late 1965. She and Herron married (for real) on November 14, 1965. To further complicate things. on June 11th Judy joked that she and Herron were married on June 6th on the Norwegian freighter “Bodo” which was docked in Hong Kong while Judy was there. Judy said, “Mark and I were married five days ago” at a party she attended at a hotel nightclub. The news hit the papers on the 12th. Also hitting the papers was the fact that Judy had told the marriage story as “a gag” and her press agent, Guy MacElwaine, said the story circulated because the press overheard Judy’s joke about it and took her seriously.\n\nWhen Judy and Herron arrived in Yokohama, Japan, Judy gave a press conference. On June 25, Judy and Herron left Tokyo by plane for Denmark via a stopover in Anchorage, Alaska where Judy told the press “I am very happy – We are very happy!” The couple arrived in London on June 30th.\n\nImages: Telegram to Judy from Bobby Kennedy wishing her well, and Judy’s response; Judy and Mark Herron leaving the hospital after Judy was released on June 1, 1964.\n\nNovember 8, 1964\n\nPALLADIUM, LONDON, ENGLAND\n\n“JUDY GARLAND AND LIZA MINNELLI AT THE PALLADIUM”\n\nThe first of a two-night engagement at the London Palladium for Judy and daughter Liza Minnelli.\n\nAfter a four-hour afternoon orchestra/rehearsal call, which had Judy singing from 2:30 to after 6 p.m., Judy and daughter Liza Minnelli gave their first concert at the London Palladium, “Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli at the London Palladium.”\n\nThe show featured 50 songs, with 15 of those being Garland solos including: “Once In A Lifetime”; “Maggie May”; “As Long As He Needs Me”; “Just In Time”; “It’s Yourself”; “Smile”; “Never Will I Marry”; “What Now, My Love?”; “The Music That Makes Me Dance”; “Joey, Joey, Joey”; “Make Someone Happy”; “The Man That Got Away’; “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby”; “San Franciso”; and “Over The Rainbow.” Judy and Liza had over 20 duets including two medleys from Judy’s recent TV series that she had performed with Barbra Streisand.\n\nThe concert was a smash hit and was recorded by Capitol Records as was the second concert on November 15th. The two-record set was another Garland hit for Capitol Records. Here are The Judy Garland Online Discography’s pages on “Judy and Liza at the Palladium” including a link to Lawrence Schulman’s excellent article about the 2-LP set, its reissues, and the drama surrounding efforts to get a complete version – or nearly complete – released publicly.\n\nThe following files represent as complete as we can get (thus far) of the recording, plus extras:\n\nACT 1 (zip file)\n\nACT 2 (zip file)\n\nEXTRAS (Includes rehearsals, radio interview, & new remasters) (zip file)\n\nMIDNIGHT CONCERT NOVEMBER 16, 1964 ACT 1 (zip file)\n\nMIDNIGHT CONCERT NOVEMBER 16, 1964 ACT 2 (zip file)\n\nA FEW HIGHLIGHTS:\n\nNever Will I Marry (2nd Night – Improved Sound Quality)\n\nhttps://www.thejudyroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Never-Will-I-Marry-2nd-Night.mp3\n\nIf I Were In Your Shoes (Liza Solo – Remastered Version)\n\nhttps://www.thejudyroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/If-I-Were-In-Your-Shoes-Remastered.mp3\n\nMaybe This Time (Liza Solo – Remastered Version)\n\nhttps://www.thejudyroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Maybe-This-Time-Remastered.mp3\n\nNovember 15, 1964\n\nPALLADIUM, LONDON, ENGLAND\n\n“JUDY GARLAND AND LIZA MINNELLI AT THE PALLADIUM”\n\nJudy and daughter Liza Minnelli’s second concert at the London Palladium. There was such a huge demand for tickets for the first concert on November 8, 1964, this second concert was scheduled. Both nights were hits with both audiences and critics.\n\nITV British Television videotaped this second show. The telecast five weeks later used only 55 minutes of the 130-minute concert. Those 55 minutes of video are all that are known to have survived.\n\nThe second and third videos below feature audio from this second night, restored by John H. Haley, and paired with the ITV footage.\n\nOn November 23, 1964, Judy and Liza recorded vocal tracks for the “Judy Garland And Liza Minnelli ‘Live’ At The London Palladium” album in Capitol’s London studios. They recorded their vocals over the orchestra tracks that were made during the November 15th concert recording. Judy dubbed “Just Once In A Lifetime” (one take); “His Is The Only Music That Makes Me Dance” (two takes); and together Judy and Liza dubbed “Hello, Dolly” (one take); “Don’t Rain On My Parade” (three takes); “San Francisco” (three takes); and “Chicago” (two takes – this song used orchestra tracks from the first concert). Liza dubbed new solos of her “Mama” tribute and “Who’s Sorry Now?”.\n\nPer Scott Schechter’s book “Judy Garland The Day-By-Day Chronicle Of A Legend,” Part of the reason for recording these new takes is that much of the second concert audiotapes were ruined by a buzzing sound that bled through from some of the television cameras that were videotaping the show that night. For all this effort, the only thing that would be used from this session on the album was the ending of “Hello, Dolly,” that occurs after the dialogue between Judy and Liza and the audience.”\n\nCheck out the album and its reissues at The Judy Garland Online Discography.\n\nOn January 11, 1965, Judy arrived back in Los Angeles for the first time since May 2, 1964. An audio recording of the television report of Lorna and Joe meeting her at the plane exists, listen to it here:\n\nhttps://www.thejudyroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/January-11-1965-Family-Reunion-LA.mp3\n\nAt this time it had been announced that Judy would do four concerts in South Africa in either the spring, or June, or July; one each in Durban, Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth. Morton Gould was Judy’s requested pianist, along with a twenty-seven-piece orchestra. Judy’s salary for the concerts was said to be “colossal … the highest price paid in South Africa,” and later revealed to be $110,000 for the four concerts, or $27,500 each. Tickets were to have a $20 top price, unheard of in 1965. Judy never performed in South Africa.\n\nAround this time, Judy and Mark Herron were seen with Denise and Vincente Minnelli at the Daisy, a nightclub in Hollywood.\n\nIt’s also reported that on January 11, 1965, Judy borrowed $25,000 from the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association in Hollywood, with the understanding that she repay it by March 5. Judy borrowed the money because she was having financial difficulties. This might have happened a day or two after Judy arrived in LA as she wouldn’t have had much time to accomplish this on the actual date of her arrival.\n\nOn February 2, 1965, Judy taped an appearance on the CBS-TV show “On Broadway Tonight” in New York, at CBS Studio 50. Judy arrived at 4 p.m. in her limo with manager Karl Brent, Mark Herron, and her maid Snowy, along with her chauffeur. Liza was also at the studio, along with Peter Allen and his stage partner Chris. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Peter Lawford also stopped in from Studio 52 where they were taping a show. Judy sang “When You’re Smiling”; “Almost Like Being In Love”/”This Can’t Be Love”; “I Wish You Love” (with the Allen Brothers); “The Music That Makes Me Dance”; and “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby.”\n\nThis was Judy’s first TV appearance taped in the US – and her first on CBS – since the end of her series in 1964. The show aired on February 5th and was a success. Judy allegedly received $7,500 for her appearance. On the night of the airing, Judy went to a performance of the Broadway musical “Golden Boy” and was photographed backstage with the show’s stars Sammy Davis, Jr., and Paula Wayne.\n\nPhotos: Judy with Lorna and Joe Luft on January 11, 1965; Judy with Sammy Davis, Jr., and Paula Wayne.\n\nVideos below: Judy’s appearance on “On Broadway Tonight” on CBS-TV taped on February 2, 1965, and aired on February 5, 1965.\n\nFebruary 8, 1965\n\nTHE O’KEEFE CENTER, TORONTO, CANADA\n\nJudy’s first concert with The Allen Brothers.\n\nThe Allen Brothers opened the show at 8:40 p.m., with thirty minutes of songs. Comedian Nipsey Russell was next for twenty minutes. After a twenty-minute intermission, Judy’s overture was played at 10:02 p.m. with Mort Lindsey conducting.\n\nJudy’s songs were: “When You’re Smiling”; “Almost Like Being In Love/This Can’t Be Love”; “The Music That Makes Me Dance”; “Smile”; “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot/He’s Got The Whole World In His Hands”; “I Wish You Love” (with The Allen Brothers, who then sang “Don’t Let The Rain Come Down” and “Toreador” while Judy changes; she came on during “Toreador” and danced with Peter); “Joey, Joey, Joey”; “You Made Me Love You/For Me And My Gal/The Trolley Song”; “By Myself”; “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby”; “Swanee”; “Chicago” and “Over The Rainbow.”\n\nJudy was having some vocal problems during the first two nights due to the flu. She canceled her matinee and evening show o the 10th on order of her doctor, L.A. Kane. The flu had given her laryngitis.\n\nFor the second night’s show on February 8, and before she took time off due to her flu, Judy changed her program, opening with “Sweet Chariot/He’s Got The Whole World In His Hands”; then “When You’re Smiling”; “Almost Like Being In Love/This Can’t Be Love”; “The Music That Makes Me Dance”; and adding the song “Just IN time”; “You Made me Love You/For Me And My Gal/The Trolley Song”; “Smile”; “Make Someone Happy” (added); “By Myself”; “The Man That Got Away” (added); “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby”; and “Chicago.” Judy did not sing “Over The Rainbow” or “Swanee” for this performance due to her flu.\n\nOn February 11, she returned for her second show at the venu arriving at 7 p.m. She began her portion of the show at 9:50 p.m., and her program was now in a set order for the remaining shows: “Sweet Chariot/He’s Got The Whole World In His Hands”; “When You’re Smiling”; “Almost Like Being In Love/This Can’t Be Love”; “Smile”; “Just In Time”; “You Made me Love You/For Me And My Gal/The Trolley Song”; “Make Someone Happy”; “By Myself”; “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby”; “Chicago”; “The Man That Got Away”; “Over The Rainbow.”\n\nJudy completed the engagement on February 13 with two shows, one matinee and one evening show. Liza had flown in to see the final evening show. The gross for the engagement was $98,000 for the six shows at $6.00 the top ticket price. The theater held 3,200 people. Judy was paid a flat fee, plus a percentage of the gross and her shows were, of course SRO.\n\nJudy was actually filling in for Nat “King” Cole, who had to cancel due to illness.\n\nDownload audio of this night, and Judy’s performances from the 11th & 13th (zip files) from the following links. NOTE: The recordings are from audiotapes taken by fans in the audience. The sound quality isn’t the greatest, but they’re all we have!\n\nFebruary 8, 1965\n\nFebruary 11, 1965\n\nFebruary 13, 1965\n\nHARLOW\n\nMarch 21, 1965: After her shows in Florida, Judy flew back to Los Angeles to begin work on the film Harlow, the film biopic about Jean Harlow starring Carol Lynley as Harlow.\n\nShe was immediately driven from the airport to the studio where she was photographed with actor Barry Sullivan, and daughter Lorna and son Joe looking at the poster art for the film.\n\nThe following day, March 22, 1965, Judy withdrew from the production. Filming was scheduled to start on March 31st. The reason given for her withdrawal was “prior commitments.” Eleanor Parker replaced her then left the project as well, being replaced by Ginger Rogers.\n\nJudy allegedly said to Lynley: “Honey, I’m not drunk, I’m not on drugs, and I’m telling you this is a piece of junk, and I’m getting out!” The film was, indeed, a piece of junk.\n\nSIDE NOTE: Judy and her family moved to Los Angeles and then Lancaster (California) in the late 1920s. Allegedly while on a trip to Los Angeles, Judy’s father Frank, and some friends, went to see the premiere festivities of (the real) Harlow’s first big film, Hell’s Angels, at Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood. Frank was able to get up to Harlow’s car and opened the door for her when she got out, prompting one of his friends to jokingly shout at him, “Who do you think you are? Rin Tin Tin?” There are photos and newsreel footage of the premiere but none of Harlow getting out of her car so it’s impossible to verify this story.\n\nFind out more about the many films Judy was a part of, or wanted for, at The Judy Room’s “The Films That Got Away” section.\n\nMay 29, 1965\n\nCINCINNATI GARDENS, CINCINNATI, OHIO\n\nJudy was in concert at the Cincinnati Gardens in Cincinnati, Ohio. Judy completed the first act in fine vocal form but had to cancel the second half when her doctor announced – with Judy on-stage – that she could not continue, as she had a virus infection and a temperature of 102. Judy had reportedly been paid $20,000 for the concert, according to one report: a $5,000 advance, then the remaining $15,000 apparently an hour before the concert; another report had Judy earning a guaranteed $40,000 against 60% of the gross; 4,500 people had paid from $3.75 to $7.50. Judy’s songs in the 32-minute first half were: “He’s Got The Whole World In His Hands”; “When You’re Smiling”; “Almost Like Being In Love”/”This Can’t Be Love”; “What Now My Love?” (standing ovation); “Do It Again”; and “San Francisco,” all backed by a 30-piece orchestra.\n\nMargaret Josten of The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that prior to the intermission “Miss Garland was visibly annoyed several times … by fans running to the stage to pop flashbulbs in her face. The guards worked overtime keeping them back. Finally, at intermission, it was announced that Judy would be very happy if nobody else tried it.”\n\nNewspapers reported that the crowd was not happy that Judy canceled the rest of the concert, with approximately 1,000 people demanding their money back and then they “besieged her dressing room, not allowing the singer to leave until more police arrived.”\n\nJune 15 through June 28, 1965\n\nTHE THUNDERBIRD HOTEL, LAS VEGAS, NEVADA\n\nJudy was released from UCLA Hospital (she had suffered an allergic reaction to prescription medications on June 12th) and immediately flew to Las Vegas for her opening night at The Thunderbird Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. That afternoon, Judy suffered convulsions from the newly prescribed medicine but she recovered. Due to arriving right from UCLA she didn’t have a chance to rehearse on opening day but it didn’t matter. Judy was a hit!\n\nThe venue was SRO on opening night, a maximum of 750 people who gave her several standing ovations. Judy’s songs: “He’s Got The Whole World In His Hands”; “When You’re Smiling’: “Almost LIke Being IN Love/This Can’t Be Love”; “Smile”; “Just IN Time”; “What Now My Love?”; “You Made Me Love You/For Me And My Gal/The Trolley Song”; “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby”; “By Myself”; “Chicago”; “The Man That Got Away” and “Over The Rainbow.”\n\nJudy’s two-week engagement outdrew every other hotel on the strip and garnered, again, amazing reviews. Judy’s shows started at 10:30 p.m. and she was backed by the Allen Brothers and a 31-piece orchestra under the direction of Nick Perito.\n\nThe opening night was a filled-to-capacity house of 900 people who gave her several ovations and as one report noted, even the waiters stood and cheered, “and waiters haven’t been known to cheer in recent years, oldtimers here noted.”\n\nAs noted in the papers, the Thunderbird was served with a writ from the Sheriff’s Office for $4,000. The writ was the result of a claim from attorney William Morse who represented Judy in 1962 during her consideration of a Nevada divorce from husband Sid Luft. Morse claimed that Judy paid him $3,000 by check then stopped payment on that check. A district court judgment was awarded the lawyers the $3,000 plus $1,000 for attorney fees. The writ required that the Thunderbird withhold the money from Judy’s salary. In spite of the legal issues the engagement was a big success.\n\nWhile Judy was in Vegas, she called into a radio show hosted by Jack Wagner and gave a quick promo/interview about the “Judy Garland and Liza Minnelli ‘Live’ at the London Palladium” album. Listen to that radio spot here:\n\nhttps://www.thejudyroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Palladium-Album-Promo-1965.mp3\n\nA recording of the first night’s performance (June 15) was made from the audience. Download a zip file of that recording here.\n\nNOTE: The version of “Over the Rainbow” included here cuts out at the very end. Unfortunately, it’s the only version from this show that I have.\n\nNovember 30 through December 13, 1965\n\nTHE SAHARA HOTEL, LAS VEGAS, NEVADA\n\nJudy returned to the Sahara for a two-week engagement. She was paid $50,000 per week.\n\nJudy and new husband Mark Herron had flown to Vegas two weeks prior and gotten married on November 14th at the Little Church of West at 1:30 a.m. They went back to Los Angeles for Liza’s opening night at the Coconut Grove on November 23rd and were back in Vegas by the 29th.\n\nJudy’s engagement at the Sahara was a successful one. Paul Rice reported in “The Sun” newspaper that: “[Judy’s appearance] may well have been the most fabulous night in show business … and I’ve never been much of a fan.”\n\nJudy was backed by the 30-piece Louis Basil orchestra. Her songs were: “He’s Got The Whole World In His Hands”; “Almost Like Being In Love”/”This Can’t Be Love”; “As Long As He Needs Me”; “Just In Time”; “What Now My Love?”; “Joey, Joey”; “The Man That Got Away” (on some nights this was replaced with “Stormy Weather”); “Do It Again”; “By Myself”; “Rock-A-Bye Your Baby”; “San Francisco”; “Swanee”; “Judy’s Olio”; “Chicago”; and “Over The Rainbow.”\n\nOn Friday, December 10th, Judy and Lorna sang “Hello, Lorna!” and “Jamboree Jones.” On closing night, December 13, Judy also sang “Liza” in tribute to the next headliner at the Sahara, who happened to be her daughter Liza Minnelli opening on Christmas Day.\n\nIt was reported at this time that Judy and Mark would spend the holidays in England and then return to New York in the middle of January for another “Ed Sullivan” show. These two events never occurred."
