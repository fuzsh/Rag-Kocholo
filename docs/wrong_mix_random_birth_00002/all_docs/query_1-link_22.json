        "text": "“I feel embraced by this place.” Albert Poland.\n\nIt’s a scary and sometimes heartless world, but there are blessed beacons of generosity, compassion and hope, and one of them is the Entertainment Community Fund (formerly known as The Actors Fund). It has provided a safety net for performing arts and entertainment professionals, not just actors, (that’s why they changed the name) but also stagehands, costumers, managers and publicists, among many others, since 1882. Their help includes counseling, jobs, financial help and health care. Its New Jersey branch, The Actors Fund Home in Englewood, is set on a lovely 6-acre campus off West Hudson Avenue and is a state-of-the-art, 169-bed facility that includes short-stay rehabilitation, assisted living, skilled nursing and accredited dementia care. The Fund opened its first retirement home in Staten Island in 1902 and then moved to Englewood in 1928. The home and its residents are a gold mine of show business history and pizazz. For me, it redefines the term “senior moment” to one of resilience, experience, grit and charm.\n\nI wanted to visit the Actors Fund Home because I heard that Albert Poland, a famous and adventurous theater producer, lives there and loves it. Poland’s string of hits includes “The Fantasticks,” “Little Shop of Horrors” and the plays of his friend, Sam Shepard, among many other successes. His wonderful memoir, “Stages,” (available on Amazon) traces his career from his Indiana childhood where he started a branch of the Judy Garland fan club. (He cold called her and got her permission.) When he came to New York, he took chances and backed the right ponies. That kind of producer doesn’t exist anymore. Ironically, one of the last shows he managed was “The Boy from Oz,” the musical about Peter Allen, Judy’s one-time son-in-law, starring Hugh Jackman. I think “Stages” is right up there with Moss Hart’s “Act One,” essential reading if you want a life in the theater.\n\nWhen I went to the Actors Fund Home, I was surprised by its bright, open layout. It was nothing like nursing homes I had seen. I talked with Jordan Strohl, who started at the home in 2000 as an intern and became its administrator in 2006. Vibrant and charismatic, Strohl’s involvement with geriatric care began early with his love for his grandparents, Harry and Frances Edelstein, Holocaust survivors who owned and operated the famed Café Edison on 47th Street in Manhattan from 1980 to 2005. It was popular with tourists and showbiz insiders who dubbed it the Polish Tea Room, and it was “a bastion of matzoh brei, borscht and corned beef served in generous portions,” according to The New York Times.\n\nOn weekends, from the age of 5, Strohl was dressed and ready by 3:30 a.m. to accompany his father on the drive from New Jersey to the restaurant. Surrounded by “blintzes, potato pancakes, latkes,” he listened to his grandfather’s vivid stories of the Holocaust” while his beautiful grandmother took a maternal interest in her customers. “The last 12 years of the business, I did Sunday mornings,” he said.\n\nAt 16, Strohl became a nationally certified EMT (Emergency Medical Technician). His friends called him a trauma junkie. He would often be out all night, 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., get home then head to the Actors Fund and crash when he got home. Now with three sons, coaching baseball and running the Actors Fund Home, he is on a break as an EMT, but he will go back to it when his kids get older. He was raised in Marlboro and lives there now. When we met,his upbeat energy was contagious. “I love what I do. It’s easy to be as happy as I am. I love this organization; I love this facility.”\n\nThe home spent $35 million on renovations in 2016 and opened a 25-bed sub-acute rehab for residents who needed extra care while recovering from an injury.\n\n“People come to us when their loved one has had an incident, is hospitalized and is ready to be discharged but not ready go home. Under the gun, people have to make hasty decisions about which facility to go to. I love it when people plan ahead, think about the future and have a game plan,” Strohl said. “Then it’s not a crisis issue. Most people in health care are dealing with putting out fires.”\n\nOne of Strohl’s favorite stories is about a hospitalized actor who wanted to be discharged to the home. Some of Strohl’s medical team thought he was too ill to come to the home. But he did come and when he arrived, smoking a cigarette, he exclaimed, dramatically, “I’ve arrived! I’ve arrived!” “For him, the home was his Graceland. He died a day later but he made it to Graceland.”\n\nWhen the Actors Fund changed its name to the more inclusive Entertainment Community Fund, Strohl lobbied to keep the home The Actors Fund Home because “when hospitals are discharging patients who need additional care, the all-important “A” in the Actors Fund keeps us at the top of the list.”\n\nI met Albert Poland in his spacious, sunny room filled with mementos from his exceptional career. When I got there, he was being interviewed by a film crew working on a story about Judy Garland. “I feel embraced by this room,” Poland said. “I’ve always followed the road signs, and they were pointing me toward The Actors Fund Home.” After he retired, he moved to a lovely house in upstate New York. “I have thought of my house for about 11 seconds. And I loved my house. But I’m now in the next chapter and there’s plenty going on to pull me into the present,” he said.\n\nPoland has a steady stream of showbiz pros visiting. He asked his old friend, Oscar and Tony award-winning composer Alan Menken (“Little Shop of Horrors,” “Aladdin,” “The Little Mermaid,” “Beauty and the Beast”) to come perform at the home and he said, “Yes” immediately. Other guests have included Seth Rudetsky of Sirius XM’s “On Broadway.”\n\n“I think one of the keys to my happiness is I make my universe small. I try to stay aware of what is going on, but I don’t immerse myself in it. I had a lucky career, and I don’t know that anyone could have my career now. Like when we did ‘The Fantasticks,’ I was really flying by the seat of my pants.” He’s still flying by the seat of his pants, only a little slower. “The response to the book, along with many other things in my life, have made a coda at this point in my life that is just filled with joy and abundance and love and support and care, and it’s a wonderful last act.”\n\nI met Philip Carlson, a dapper and youthful man who started as an actor and became a well-known agent. After retiring, he moved to Seattle, where his wife passed away. He returned to New York and eventually decided to move into the home in July. He’s still finding his way there. “It was a shock to the system.” He spends his time catching up on his reading and he writes. His book “Breaking and Entering” is considered indispensable to actors learning the ropes.\n\nTrusting his instincts, Carlson discovered and nurtured talents including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kyra Sedgewick, Liev Schreiber and Idris Elba, whom he heard about from an acquaintance. “I met him, and he was magical.” Though Elba didn’t know much about theater or Shakespeare, Carlson submitted him for a prestigious production of “Troilus and Cressida,” directed by Sir Peter Hall, and Elba’s career was launched.\n\n“Philip Carlson was my guide in shining armor. Smart, honest and hardworking. ‘Breaking and Entering’ is his experience on a shelf,” Elba has said of the book. Another discovery was an unknown 13-year-old Claire Danes, who sent her pictures to his office. “I met her and fell in love with her,” he said.\n\nI was introduced to another resident, Gene Bertoncini, one of the greatest jazz guitarists on the planet. “There are only a handful of legendary jazz guitarists today who can demand the respect and admiration due them after a lifetime of majestic devotion to the art of jazz guitar. Gene Bertoncini is just such an artist and like Segovia, his name should be synonymous with all that is virtuous in the world of jazz,” Jazz Guitar Life has said.\n\nBertoncini began playing guitar at age 7 and by age 16 was appearing on television. He was in “The Tonight Show” band and has worked with most of the greats: Burt Bacharach, Tony Bennett, Paul Desmond, Benny Goodman, Lena Horne, Michel Legrand, Carmen McRae and Nancy Wilson, among many others. His discography as a front and side man is extensive. He told me that he still performs in New York City, and at the Actors Fund Home regularly.\n\nThe New York offices of the Entertainment Community Fund have been closed since the pandemic and most business is conducted virtually for the time being. I loved going to the office on Seventh Avenue, a block north of the TKTS booth. In a business filled with rejection, it was the opposite: welcoming, respectful and most of all, helpful. From its simple origins in 1882, The Fund has expanded to include offices in Chicago and Los Angeles, and housing in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Its atmosphere is set by President and CEO Joe Benincasa, who started there in 1989. A dedicated, unpretentious but brilliant man, I had the feeling that he, like Jordan Strohl, was from New Jersey. “Yes, I was born and raised in New Brunswick and now live outside of Lambertville.”\n\nBenincasa started with the organization in 1989. “They had started to build a nursing home, and my first job was the fundraising campaign to build the nursing home.” His mission has expanded exponentially, as have the needs of the community.\n\n“There are lot of stories attached to the home’s development. I remember bringing Celeste Holm out there and having her solicit Pittsburgh Paints. We got 300 cans of paint for the place. Dina Merrill helped us with the flooring there.” We created assisted living in 1995 and we continue to improve the facility. Our greatest find was Jordan Strohl.”\n\nAcclaimed performer Brian Stokes Mitchell was a dedicated and charismatic president of the board of directors for 19 years. He has just been succeeded by Annette Bening (yes, that Annette Bening), who got her start in New York theater. Between the pandemic and the writers’ strike, things are tougher than ever for the arts community.\n\nIf you’re interested in knowing more about the Fund and all its services or to donate to this organization, visit: entertainmentcommunity.org\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Spring 2024 issue of Jersey’s Best. Subscribe here for in-depth access to everything that makes the Garden State great.\n\nSince 2022, Jersey’s Best has declared three uniquely captivating towns Destinations of the Year. In true eclectic Jersey style, we’ve gone from Cape May’s coastal Victorian vibe, to Lambertville’s riverside charm; and for 2024 it’s Metuchen — a cityscape with all the small town feels. It might make you wonder, “What’s the secret formula?”\n\nNow, as we introduce a whole new quintet of finalists in contention for the Jersey’s Best 2025 Destination of the Year, we plan to keep everyone guessing. Representing the finest examples of New Jersey’s diverse appeal, let’s hear it for this year’s standout nominees: Fort Lee, Hillsborough, Jersey City, Madison and New Brunswick. Never been? This’ll make you want to give ‘em a go.\n\nFort Lee\n\nPerched on the Palisades and just a minutes-long jitney ride away from Manhattan, Fort Lee might seem like a place to pass through on your way to the big city. Stop right there, folks, because this town on the Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge is no place to pass up. The cliff-top views of the Hudson River and the New York City skyline from Fort Lee Historic Park’s overlooks are unparalleled, and a walk through the park’s visitor center and historic encampment area makes for one revolutionary stroll.\n\nFort Lee is our smallest contender, but it’s no featherweight when it comes to packing a punch. Another “Jersey first” source of pride, Fort Lee is the birthplace of America’s motion picture industry, a distinction celebrated with stunning sophistication at the Barrymore Film Center, a museum and repertory film theatre which opened in October 2022. It’s not the only show in town when it comes to this suburb’s devotion to arts, entertainment, and culture – Fort Lee’s mural project is a vivid reminder of the contemporary vibe downtown. Even the food is a work of art at Ventanas Restaurant and Lounge, fusing modern American, Asian and Latin cuisines in a visually dazzling space.\n\nThis town that invented the term “cliff hanger” is in the midst of one right now: Will Fort Lee be our next Destination of the Year?\n\nHillsborough Township\n\nThough our Destination of the Year distinction can’t be won by duking it out, it’s tough to argue with the 1.5 million visitors enchanted over the years by the beauty and purpose of Duke Farms – one of Hillsborough Township’s many crowning jewels. This 2,700-acre environmental center holds endless promise and delights for conservationists and all who cherish nature and being outdoors. Hillsborough Township boasts an easy harmony of rural and suburban living, designating 40% of its acreage to open space and dedicating the rest to the good life.\n\n“We are humbled and excited to be considered,” says Mayor Robert Britting. “We all believe Hillsborough is the best place to live in the USA and has the most potential compared to any other town in the state.”\n\nAdd to that a best place to stay with the opening of a 100-room boutique hotel, making it easy to visit for more than a day to enjoy Dukes Farm, the Sourland Mountain Preserve, farms such as Norz Hill and What a View (goat yoga, anyone?), Royce Brook Golf Club, and the myriad “unknown gem” restaurants — secrets that won’t stay secret for long.\n\nHillsborough Township’s community events, such as the five-day Rotary Fair, Family Fun Day, and holiday fests, draw tens of thousands to town throughout the year; while the Flounder Brewing Co.’s tasting rooms fill with live music, locals, and folks who often end up wishing they were.\n\nAnd if Hillsborough Township’s wishes come true, they’ll be raising a glass to a 2025 Destination of the Year win.\n\nJersey City\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that any other place in New Jersey could compete with Jersey City as a destination when you consider the masses who set sail in its direction for Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty over the past century or so. But our friendly competition is all about where to go once you get here, and if you’re looking for urban chic; artistry on display, indoors and out; music, food and faces from around the world; take a look at Jersey City.\n\nThere’s quite a lot to look at. Public art is everywhere; and the Jersey City Mural Arts Program has it all mapped out to guide your tour of murals by the dozens. Historic architecture and soaring contemporary high-rises catch the eye at every turn. During spring and summer, weekly outdoor events are main attractions, including the Handmade Market featuring the wares of local artists and makers; and Groove on Grove, the city’s live music series. Journal Square, the city’s business district, is undergoing a transformation — by 2025 and beyond, the landmark Lowe’s Jersey Theater will have completed its restoration; and the opening of the Centre Pompidou x, a satellite of the iconic French museum, promises to further elevate Jersey City’s cultural arts scene — perhaps just in time to coincide with a Destination of the Year title.\n\nMadison\n\nFrom its vibrant center for the arts, to one of the leading Shakespeare theaters in the nation, to the Museum of Early Trades and Crafts, to the stunning, historic street scape of its quaint and lively downtown, the “Rose City” of Madison feels like home, whether you live there or not. Once the world’s number one producer of roses (hence the moniker), Madison is a-bloom with places and things for all kinds of people; and they are drawn in swarms like bees to nectar.\n\nMadison is home to both Fairleigh Dickinson University and to Drew University, where the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey has celebrated the works of the namesake playwright for more than 60 years. The four-square-mile hamlet’s walkable downtown boasts more than 50 restaurants, including the acclaimed Shanghai Jazz Restaurant and Bar – hailed as one of the top 100 jazz clubs in the world. Along Main Street, independent shops and unique retailers outnumber by far any national chains; and even Hollywood agrees this downtown is as pretty as a (motion) picture, using it as the backdrop for several films and series. It’s also the setting for Madison’s Bottle Hill Day festival, an autumn celebration enjoyed by thousands.\n\nLife is good in Madison, but a Destination of the Year designation will have everything coming up roses.\n\nNew Brunswick\n\nDespite all the serious studies going on at Rutgers University, there seems to be quite a lot of fun and games going on in New Brunswick. That’s hard to avoid with a Big 10 team in town: the Scarlet Knights are a huge draw during college football season, both for stadium spectators and parking lot tail gaiters.\n\nBut there’s much more to tackle in this final finalist’s domain. Arts and entertainment team up to dominate New Brunswick’s appeal. The State Theatre NJ anchors the downtown district; and the New Brunswick Performing Arts Center houses four unique arts companies, including the Crossroads Theatre Company, the George Street Playhouse, the American Repertory Ballet, and the Rutgers University Mason Gross School of the Arts. Need more culture? Visit the university-based Zimmerli Art Museum or take a listen to the New Brunswick Jazz Project at Tavern on the George.\n\nAnd when your soul is sated, your self may still hunger; luckily, dining options abound, from a scattering of food trucks to the sumptuous elegance of the Frog and the Peach. You’ll never be far from food in this vital college town.\n\nUltimately, when you need comic relief, the Stress Factory comes through in the clutch. And he who laughs last, laughs best – perchance to best the competition and crown New Brunswick the next Destination of the Year.\n\nA Quirky Quintet\n\nCities and suburbs and farms … oh, my! Which town takes the prize for 2025? Let the guessing games begin!\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Spring 2024 issue of Jersey’s Best. Subscribe here for in-depth access to everything that makes the Garden State great.\n\nImagine this: You’re walking down a street in New Jersey when you hear something that’s music to your ears — literally. It’s the sound of a mariachi band strumming a harmony so smooth it almost puts you in a trance. You’ve got places to be, though, so you keep walking.\n\nNot even a minute goes by before your nose picks up the tune of an aromatic symphony. Peppers, parsley, onion and garlic waft through the air, and suddenly you feel like you’re in Haiti. Those savory and spicy notes are no match because you’ve got your senses set on another country: Portugal. Or was it Brazil? Honestly, it doesn’t even matter. Why not both?\n\nAs lifelong Elizabeth resident Jennifer Costa likes to say: “Pick your country, and you’ll find a restaurant with iconic cuisine symbolic of that.”\n\nDespite being in a state so densely packed with culture, it’s still a bold claim for the president of the Greater Elizabeth Chamber of Commerce to make, but Costa’s not kidding. The city’s culinary scene represents more than 50 of the 195 United Nations-recognized countries, or about one-quarter of the world’s food culture. In an area occupying less than 14 square miles, that averages out to over three countries per square mile.\n\nWhat does it all amount to? “A cultural immersion without having to leave Jersey,” Costa said.\n\nFirst Course: A Bit(e) of History\n\nTo appreciate Elizabeth’s rich food culture is to understand the recipe from which it came.\n\nThe city has long been a central hub for immigration, thanks to its coastal location and proximity to New York City, which primed the area to be at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. Companies such as Singer Sewing Machine Co. and Bethlehem Steel Corp. set up shop at that time, creating thousands of jobs for the European population who began to call Elizabeth home.\n\nFast forward to the 20th century, and in came a wave of Spanish-speaking immigrants looking to make a life in the states. Elizabeth, again, proved itself a no-brainer home base thanks to the emergence of other major employers, such as the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal as well as Newark Liberty International Airport, both of which have grown into global behemoths for their respective industries.\n\nAs the ingredients came together for these new residents, they began to sprinkle in their own special sauce — new traditions, new languages and, of course, new cuisine — making Elizabeth a true melting pot that’s equal parts diverse and immersive.\n\n“You can dine one night in Old Portugal or in the country of Colombia. You can end up having pastries at a French crêperie,” Costa explained. “But it’s also walking into establishments where not only is the cuisine amazing; you have that cultural experience of ambiance, of linguistics, too.”\n\nSecond Course: Savor the Sights, Sounds and Flavors\n\nAh, yes. Portugal! That’s where we were headed.\n\nIt’s fitting we make it to 230 Trumbull St. for two reasons. First, we’ve arrived at the real-life postcard of Elizabeth’s past, present and future, with Newark Liberty International Airport, the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal and The Mills at Jersey Gardens — every shopper’s dream come true — all within a stone’s throw of where we’re standing.\n\nSecond, we’ve made it to Portugal.\n\nStepping into Bossa Fish is a lot like stepping into a Portuguese fish market, with everything from fresh branzino to red snapper to salt cod lined up precisely on ice. You’ll often hear customers ordering in Portuguese or Spanish, something managing partner Philip Carvalho takes great pride in because, in his words, “We’re here to serve the community.”\n\nBossa Fish has more than meets the eye and ear. The eatery features a menu that mixes traditional takes with some inventive concoctions, like The Charlie Baltimore Crab Cake topped with a super-secret Bossa sauce, or The Knickerbocker Chopped Cheese made with another mysterious sauce lathered on a toasted hero. The sauces shall remain a mystery, but one thing is no secret: Bossa Fish has been named a top new dining spot every year since its opening in 2021. You can’t argue with those accolades.\n\nFor every newcomer there is a longstanding institution, and there may be no better example than Valença Restaurant. The Elizabeth icon has been around since 1989, serving food in a warm setting that makes you feel like you’re part of a Portuguese family. Diane Barbosa said that’s been a hallmark of her family’s restaurant from the start.\n\n“The idea with Valença was to make it feel like how we feel (as a family),” she said. “With the employees, we say, ‘This is your home. We want to support you and your families.’ I think the family feel even transpires into the food itself; the food tastes better. When you’re eating at home, you feel comfortable.”\n\nIf the intricate lighting and rustic artwork don’t do the trick, the steak on the stone surely will. The Portuguese novelty, which involves cooking your own meat in a sizzling butter mixture, has proven to be a big hit over the years. Its origin story? Well, you could probably guess.\n\n“We came up with it together during a summer family vacation to Portugal. That’s the secret,” Barbosa said.\n\nThird Course: Hitting the Sweet Spot\n\nIf you’re in search of a place with all the tastes, begin (and end) at Morris, Elizabeth, Rahway or Westfield avenues. Here, you’ll find an appetizing cross-section of the city’s food scene.\n\nLooking to be swept away by the sounds of that mariachi band with a tropical drink in hand? Mexology, on Morris Avenue, is calling your name. And those peppery notes straight from Haiti? That’s First Republic Lounge & Restaurant, one block south and one block east of Mexology. Feeling adventurous? Try Uruguayan delights at La Estancia Parrillada along Rahway Avenue.\n\nJust don’t forget to pick up a tres leches cake or Napoleon pastry from G&S Sweets before you leave town. Calories definitely don’t count here.\n\nWhen you enjoy this slice of international food paradise, don’t forget you can only find it … Just in Jersey.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Spring 2024 issue of Jersey’s Best. Subscribe here for in-depth access to everything that makes the Garden State great.\n\nAt first glance, A hospital building may appear large and impersonal.\n\nBut in reality, it’s a good neighbor.\n\nNew Jersey’s 113 hospitals are integral to the communities in which they are based — whether those settings are urban, suburban or rural. And many of our hospitals are among the national leaders in high-level, around-the-clock emergency and inpatient care.\n\nBut hospitals do much more than treat the acutely and chronically sick; they provide a range of free or low-cost services aimed at improving the community’s overall physical, medical and emotional health.\n\nFollowing are just a few ways hospitals benefit their communities:\n\nCommunity wellness programs ranging from post-cancer recovery, to yoga and meditation, to healthy eating and cooking, to grief support and counseling;\n\nVaccination and screening clinics;\n\nOn-site pharmacy services;\n\nVaccination and screening clinics;\n\nSmoking cessation programs;\n\nTransportation to and from medical appointments and hospital stays for those in need;\n\nCommunity health fairs, where people can learn about health related issues, as well as hospital programs and employment opportunities.\n\nMany hospitals also hold community food and clothing drives; offer meeting spaces for community organizations; connect the needy with food and nutrition support programs and other basic needs; provide short-term housing and rent support; and sponsor and organize community-based programs such as community gardens, athletic events and more.\n\n“A hospital’s reach and impact extend beyond its walls into the surrounding neighborhoods and communities,” says American Hospital Association Board Chair John Hauper.\n\nHospital Workers are the Community\n\nWhy are hospitals so involved with their communities?\n\nIt’s simple. The hospital’s physicians, nurses, support staff, maintenance, food service and security staff are the community. When they’re on duty, they comfort and care for us. When they’re off duty, we run into them at the park, the supermarket or the coffee shop, or at a local house of worship. Their children attend school with our children, and we buy Girl Scout cookies and candy bars from them.\n\nMany hospital employees live or settle in the community in which their hospital is based, so they are invested in their hometown and are motivated to make a difference for their fellow residents. As stated on the health care job search site Hospital Careers, “Fewer health care professionals have the benefit of making a difference more than those who work in a hospital.”\n\nNew Jersey’s hospital staffs work 24/7 to improve our well-being. That is why Jersey’s Best, in collaboration with health care research and consulting firm Castle Connolly, is proud to spotlight the New Jersey medical centers that have been honored for 2024 as Top Hospitals.\n\nKnown for its trusted Top Doctors directories of primary care and specialty physicians, Castle Connolly also compiles annual Top Hospital listings based on nominations and recommendations from the physicians who entrust their patients’ care to these medical centers.\n\nEach year, Castle Connolly asks doctors to complete an online survey that includes questions relative to a hospital’s overall ability to provide quality care and treat specific medical conditions. Each physician chooses as many hospitals as he or she feels exemplify a commitment to high-level care.\n\nThe nomination process sets Castle Connolly lists apart from directories that simply include every medical center from a city or regional database, or that list only hospitals that pay to be included. Castle Connolly never accepts payment for list inclusion, and each nominated hospital can only be listed after approval by Castle Connolly’s review board, chief medical officer, chief research officer and research staff.\n\nA total of 606 doctors voted for this year’s list, and roughly 11,900 votes were cast. Castle Connolly then used a point system to weigh each physician’s votes, with higher-ranked hospitals garnering more points.\n\nPatients’ perceptions of the care they received at these hospitals were equally critical to the selection process, so Castle Connolly also took into account discharge data and patient feedback.\n\nAs part of the nomination and vetting process, the physicians and review team also were asked to consider the inherent differences between larger and smaller hospitals. For example, larger hospitals have more expansive rosters of affiliated physicians than do smaller hospitals, and they may also have more prominent centers of excellence that focus on the clinical areas that physicians were asked to rank.\n\nSo, to judge hospitals on even terms regardless of size, Castle Connolly awarded separate Top Hospital designations for hospitals with more than 350 beds, and for those with 350 beds or fewer. All told, 82 New Jersey hospitals were ranked — 42 in the more-than-350-bed category, and 40 in the 350-bed-or-less listing.\n\nOnce a nominated hospital is accepted for inclusion, it is listed prominently on the Top Hospitals page and on a searchable database of Top Hospitals, both on the Castle Connolly website. Users can search the database by location or zip code to find a top-level hospital close to home.\n\nThe Castle Connolly site also lists Top Hospitals by specialty, so users can quickly find the leading hospitals in New Jersey and elsewhere for heart disease, cancer, pediatric care and orthopedic surgery.\n\nVisit www.castleconnolly.com/top-hospitals if you’re looking for a hospital or to learn more about a specific medical center.\n\nTo view Jersey’s Best Top Hospitals’ list, click here.\n\nThe economic impact of N.J. hospitals on the community\n\nIn addition to the many practical and visceral benefits hospitals impart to their communities, they also help fuel the local economy. Each year, New Jersey hospitals:\n\nEmploy 154,000 full- and part-time workers in clinical, administrative, maintenance, food service, security and other roles.\n\nFund $10 billion-plus in total employee salaries, which generates $570 million in state income taxes.\n\nSpend $4.6 billion on goods and services from other businesses, many of them local.\n\nCreate 1.3 jobs outside of the hospital with each hire.\n\nSource: New Jersey Hospital Association, https://www.njha.com/pressroom/nj-hospital-fast-facts.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Spring 2024 issue of Jersey’s Best.

They are an opportunity to take a more challenging class that can be their sole focus. If a student is looking to graduate early, they can knock out an elective or other classes.”\n\nFinancial assistance may also be available for summer programs, Naphy added.\n\nAt Rowan, chemistry is one of the most popular summer offerings, enabling students to take this difficult course without juggling other classes. The university also offers a Pre-college Institute for certain students.\n\n“They learn the ropes of what it’s like to be a college student,’’ Naphy said. “They take two classes during those six weeks so when they enter Rowan in the fall they are already familiar with the campus and have met other students. It’s a program that really prepares them to be successful in college.’’\n\nVisit rowan.edu.\n\nAt Drew University, summer offerings also run the gamut.\n\n“We have a full summer schedule of courses for high school students to get a head start on college credits,” said Colby McCarthy, dean of enrollment management, Drew University. “Current students have the opportunity to pick up another class.”\n\nDrew’s study abroad program gives students a chance to spend three to four weeks in another country, experience another culture and take courses that can bolster their credit count. The coursework coordinates with a country’s culture, such as taking food and farming sustainability classes in Italy or learning about economics in London.\n\n“This is a unique short study abroad program, led by faculty members, and is good for students who may not be able to study abroad for a full semester,’’ McCarthy said. “It’s a great way to explore an academic area while being in another culture.’’\n\nVisit drew.edu.\n\nAt Seton Hall, courses are available to current students and those visiting from other colleges and universities. Popular courses include Digital Art and Design, Sports Management, Biology, Human Anatomy, Catholic Theology, History, Music and Civilizations.\n\n“Our summer academic sessions offer courses and programs for current undergraduate, graduate and high school students that can help them progress toward degree completion or simply enrich their knowledge in an area of interest,” said Mary Kate Naatus, assistant provost and dean of the Division of Continuing and Professional Education.\n\n“Students can select in person, hybrid or remote courses and can enjoy learning from faculty experts in many different fields,” she said. “Summer learning in condensed academic sessions can be especially rewarding and allow for even greater interactions in the classes.”\n\nSeton Hall also offers programs for high school students, including Giant Leap STEM in Weather and Climate Sustainability, Robotics and Electronics, Accounting 101 and Cybersecurity, among others.\n\nVisit shu.edu.\n\nAt Rider University, students are privy to an array of pre-college enrichment programs designed to empower high-schoolers with essential skills and tools necessary to pursue their passions, while immersing themselves in the college campus experience.\n\nParticipants engage in rigorous coursework and gain access to state-of-the-art equipment, facilities, on-campus housing and a range of engaging activities, providing them with a comprehensive exploration of college life at Rider.\n\nSome popular offerings include Game Design Academy, which immerses high school students in digital game development in a professional and creative environment. Through hands-on experience with industry-standard software, participants acquire fundamental skills in digital design and game logic programming. They also gain valuable insights into potential career paths within the field, exploring Rider’s B.A. program in Game and Interactive Media Design.\n\nRider’s Musical Theatre Institute (MTI) nurtures future stars of the performing arts industry through intensive group and private sessions in singing, acting and dancing. Led by esteemed faculty members with extensive experience in Broadway, national tours, television and film, students receive personalized instruction and mentorship.\n\nThe MTI faculty recognize that students have varying levels of natural ability and experience. They are committed to meeting each student “where they are” in their training and helping them cultivate and expand their current abilities.\n\nRider’s Solo Vocal Artist helps young classical singers develop their art alongside the distinguished voice faculty of Rider’s Westminster Choir College. The program provides personalized hands-on instruction for each student, including daily sessions in voice science, body awareness, opera and art song history.\n\nVisit rider.edu.\n\nCounty College of Morris offers a wide range of courses across all academic programs that appeal to current students, visiting students attending four-year institutions, high school students looking to earn college credits before they graduate or students looking for non-credit workforce development programs.\n\nMost academic programs at CCM offer virtual, on campus and hybrid course options. Many of the college’s popular summer courses include IT, health professions and the natural sciences, such as biology and chemistry.\n\nVisit ccm.edu.\n\nAt the New Jersey Institute of Technology, hundreds of courses in a wide range of disciplines are offered between May and August. The undergraduate and graduate-level courses cover everything from environmental engineering, accounting and architecture to emerging academic offerings like ethical hacking, forensic science and artificial intelligence.\n\n“There’s something for everyone,” NJIT Provost John Pelesko said. “Summer Session offers students the opportunity to take advantage of flexible course schedules and formats, including face-to-face, online and hybrid delivery models.”\n\nIn addition, NJIT offers summertime pre-college programs in mathematics, forensic science and engineering designed for high school students and some middle schoolers. These programs aim to spark interest in STEM at an early age, particularly among those from underserved communities in NJIT’s home of Newark. Ideally, they inspire participants to pursue college degrees and ultimately, stimulating and financially rewarding jobs in STEM.\n\nNJIT’s Hillier College of Architecture and Design has summer career exploration programs that enable high school students to work collaboratively in studios and create portfolios. Also, beyond traditional architecture and design, the instruction includes game design and animation.\n\nNJIT’s Martin Tuchman School of Management (MTSM), which recently introduced a concentration in sports data analytics, offers online business data analytics courses in the summer that focus on interpretation and insights, rather than number crunching.\n\n“These programs supply much-needed opportunities for students in the middle of their academic pursuit, adult learners upskilling into higher paying jobs and pre-college students looking for a jump start,” Pelesko said. “Indeed, learning is continuous and all are welcome here.”\n\nVisit njit.edu.\n\nSummer education programs are not just for high school and college students. Located in Sparkill, N.Y., St. Thomas Aquinas College offers STEM camps to students entering grades five through nine in areas like technology, arts and mathematics.\n\nMade possible by the generous support of Orange & Rockland Utilities and Community Offshore Wind, the program includes The Mathematics of Elections in which campers study different voting methods and explore basic game theory and the United State’s electoral system.\n\nAnother popular camp offering is Electronics: Circuits & Usage, which explores the fundamental principles of electricity, basic circuit design and how data science can be used to explore electrical usage.\n\nThe college’s Summer Literacy Program equips students in need of extra literacy support with the skills to be strategic readers and writers. Students work in small groups or individually with certified teachers completing their master’s degrees in literacy or special education and is supervised by the School of Education faculty.\n\nVisit stac.edu.\n\nWearing the right clothing can bolster confidence and help make a great first impression. Guided by that principle, Dress for Success of Northern NJ has been providing free professional attire to women as they job search and begin the first few weeks of employment.\n\nWith 25 years under its fashionable belt, the nonprofit organization suited and styled close to 2,300 women across 10 counties in 2023 alone. Now Dress for Success of Northern NJ has embraced a new opportunity of its own: a move from 25 Cook Ave. to 300 Madison Ave. in Madison.\n\nExecutive Director Loraimy Kendall outlined the advantages the new building offers the organization’s clients.\n\n“The Madison Community House, which is celebrating 100 years this year, hosted us for 25 years and it was a great experience,” she said. “The new location is in more of a residential building. It’s closer to the train station. We have an elevator so it’s accessible for all types of women and anyone who might have a disability. Our office and our boutique are now combined in one location. It’s a really good new space for us.”\n\nTo celebrate, Dress for Success will host a grand opening event on Wednesday, April 24 from 6 to 8 p.m. so the public can visit the new boutique.\n\nSupporting the cause\n\nWhile Dress for Success gratefully accepts clothing donations, Kendall noted that the new boutique has limited storage. With that in mind, she asked that donors limit their contributions to 20 items or less.\n\nMonetary donations are always appreciated and gift cards help the organization supplement inventory, particularly when it comes to offering less common sizes.\n\n“We get an abundance of donations, but the smaller sizes, like extra-small, double zero, and then anything above size 20, like 22 to 24, those sizes are even harder to find,” said Kendall, who noted that gift cards to retailers such as Lane Bryant and Amazon are ideal as they allow Dress for Success to stock items in wide range of sizes.\n\nEmpowered women empower women\n\nA leading provider of free workforce development services for women, Dress for Success operates largely due to the hard work and dedication of its volunteers. In addition to suiting and styling women, volunteers also provide support through professional development programs aimed at helping women advance in their careers.\n\n“We serve all of Northern New Jersey, so we have a huge footprint, but I am currently the only full-time staff so everything really gets done by our volunteers,” Kendall said. “We have over 600 volunteers in northern New Jersey. Not all are active, but we send out newsletters on a monthly basis and, depending on the volunteer activity, a lot of volunteers do sign up.”\n\nKendall, who’s been with Dress for Success for eight years, credits the nonprofit’s “Friday crew” with creating a smooth transition amid the recent move.\n\n“They’re a group that come every Friday and help with almost every part of the organization,” she said. “I think that’s why I’ve been with this organization so long. It’s really like a very big sisterhood. We’re all empowering each other and are always helping each other. It’s the best community.”\n\nThat hard work is appreciated by clients who begin to view themselves in a new light after receiving support.\n\n“Dress for Success Northern NJ allowed me to unlock my own potential and see how bright of a future I could and did create for myself,” noted client A. Bochko.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nIn addition to its new location, Dress for Success has other news: its gala will return this fall.\n\n“We are going to have a huge fundraiser in October,” Kendall said. “It’s going to be our first time bringing our gala back since COVID. It’ll be held at the Park Avenue Club in Florham Park.\n\nKendall suggested following Dress for Success on social media for updates about events.\n\nTo learn more about client services, ways to volunteer, and upcoming events, visit Dress for Success’s website.\n\nFor Charlie Van Leuven, stepping inside the Matchbox Road Museum for the first time was like being 8 years old all over again.\n\nThe dizzying array of those little die-cast vehicles — placed with almost surgical precision in colorful rows behind plexiglass — took him back to summer days spent roaming similar displays of The Trading Post along Route 9 in Sea Isle City. It’s what spurred the Mantua native to start collecting over 50 years ago, but now he found himself in a different predicament.\n\n“(I felt) like a kid in a candy store … but I couldn’t buy any of it,” he laughed.\n\nEverett Marshall III can especially relate. He, too, spent summers down the Shore buying as many Matchbox cars as he could with a $1 weekly allowance. The only difference? Well, Marshall may as well have bought the whole “candy store.”\n\nAnd it so happens that Van Leuven was standing in the middle of it.\n\nA True Toy Story\n\nWhat began as a simple collection of cars for Marshall in childhood turned into an equally simple reasoning to, in his words, “put them away because they may be worth something someday” once he got older. He figured having each of the original 75 Matchbox models would be a solid place to start.\n\nLittle did he realize that Matchbox had more than that fixed lineup of models. Like, waaaay more. There were tons of variations out there, too. So, 75 cars soon became 100. Then 100 became 1,000. Then 1,000 became 50,000. Somewhere in between, Marshall had his “where the rubber meets the road” moment. This collection couldn’t possibly fit in his basement anymore.\n\nIn 1992, he opened Matchbox Road Museum out of a three-car garage that was previously used for his family’s trucking business. Marshall was supposed to incorporate his cars and his father’s train collection into the space. You could probably guess which one of those collections never made it in. The following year, a pole barn was added on to the garage to keep up with the ever-growing treasure trove of Matchbox memorabilia, which had expanded from the standard planes, trains and automobiles to Skip-It toys and Christie Brinkley dolls. (More on that in a bit.)\n\nIt was official: Marshall and Matchbox were a match made in heaven.\n\n“I had friends who worked for Matchbox. When I first started collecting, I became friends with one of the designers in England,” Marshall explained. “Then I became friendly with the people at Tyco (a former Matchbox manufacturer), which was only 40 minutes or so north of the museum. If they needed a model to mock up for something, I’d get it for them, and it was kind of give and take.”\n\nPreserving Precious History\n\nThat relationship with the Matchbox manufacturer over the years (currently: Mattel, Inc.) fostered more than a few one-of-a-kind snags for Marshall. Among them are so-called “transitional pieces,” or vehicles that have the “wrong” parts because those parts ended up fitting from an old model line to the new.\n\nHe cited a late ‘60s red Pontiac in the museum that has black plastic wheels instead of the typical rubber wheels that dominated the Superfast line. A retail price of about $0.49 back then has since skyrocketed to thousands of dollars for such cars on auction.\n\nThen, there are the products most people don’t know Matchbox ever made, like that curious Christie Brinkley doll and her pink limousine. Marshall explained that the company created the prototype to compete with Barbie and her pink Corvette, but it didn’t sell at toy shows so they scrapped the plan. He was able to keep the failed product that would’ve otherwise been a forever forgotten piece of Matchbox history.\n\n“People will come in and see things like that in the museum, and they’re amazed that it was actually part of Matchbox at one time,” Marshall said. “Rubik’s Cubes, Skip-Its, Ginny Vogue dolls. There’s just a lot of things to acquire because the museum needs to show everything that they did, so those are the kinds of things I look for now, not necessarily vehicles anymore.”\n\nA Collection That Sparks A Connection\n\nWhile the unexpected finds make the museum a place for more than just car collectors, the real magic is found in the bond it creates across generations. Visitors young and old step through the doors together, then suddenly age becomes nothing but a number.\n\n“I get some guys who just go on and on and on because of the cars they had when they were a child, and they go, ‘Look, I remember that one! I had that one,’ ” Van Leuven said.\n\nWait, what is Van Leuven still doing here? Yeah, he’s no one-time visitor; he has a hand in the “candy store” after all. Turns out feeling like that kid who couldn’t buy anything transformed into a 27-plus-year museum volunteer gig … and counting. On top of leading tours, he helps curate and organize Marshall’s collection — a massive undertaking considering the museum is missing an estimated 15,000 pieces not yet prepared for public display.\n\nThat’s at the top of the to-do list in 2024, in addition to a tentatively planned Open House sometime in April. Beyond the foreseeable future, Marshall is hopeful that one of his grandsons will continue the legacy while he enjoys life down in Florida. In the meantime, he promises anyone who walks through the doors will instantly feel the joy of his precious toys.\n\n“Seeing is believing. People will come back, collectors will come back three and four times, and they still don’t see everything,” Marshall said. “You can spend hours there, but I just so much enjoy when people come in happy.”\n\nMatchbox Road Museum is located at 15 Pearl St. in Newfield. The Open House date is not yet set, but private tours can be scheduled by calling 609-381-2332. Admission is free; donations are accepted.\n\nVisit facebook.com/MatchboxRoadMuseum to stay updated with the latest events.\n\nWhen you dig through this nostalgic treasure chest of toys, don’t forget you can only find it … Just in Jersey.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Jersey’s Best.

Wyckoff residents Jessica Jackson and Nick Mamola thought up a solution: The Mookabee, a swaddle that safely incorporates a parent’s scent. The mission of Mookabee Swaddle is to harness the scientifically proven power of a mom’s scent to create soothing and comforting swaddles that help babies fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, while promoting the bond between a parent and child. The swaddle with its scent-absorbing soothe-swatch is backed by medical professionals and recommended by sleep consultants. Find out more about this Wyckoff-based company that’s helping parents and babies sleep better! Co-owner Jessica Jackson fills us in.\n\nWhy did you start your business?\n\nThe Mookabee was started after many, many sleepless nights. I recently had my second daughter, and sleep felt like a thing of the past. No matter what I did my baby wouldn’t sleep. After thoroughly researching ways to help soothe her, and repeatedly hearing the same thing: put your scent on something in the crib, I decided to test it out. I placed a shirt of mine underneath her swaddle, and for the first time, I watched her fall asleep, and stay asleep, easily! But having any loose items in the crib is unsafe, and I knew there had to be a better way. I began collaborating with my business partner, Nick, on ways to safely incorporate a parent’s scent into the crib — and the Mookabee was born. Parenting is such hard work, and the sleep deprivation that comes along with it makes it even harder. Knowing that the Mookabee allows parents to essentially still provide comfort to their baby, while improving the quality of sleep for the whole family, is so motivating. There’s also nothing like this on the market, so fulfilling a need with this unique swaddle continues to drive us forward.\n\nHow did you come up with the name of the company?\n\nThe name combines “Mukavuus,” which means comfort in Finnish, and “Bee,” which symbolizes community and brightness. We all know it takes a village to raise children and having a child represents new beginnings and light.\n\nWhat was the hardest part about getting it up and running?\n\nIt was definitely the production process during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic [in 2020]. The entire supply chain was disrupted, our factory shut down, and partnerships that were time sensitive were impacted. It was incredibly difficult to launch a business. Having a small business is hard in different ways, constantly. Allocating marketing dollars to the right partnerships is difficult in the baby world because it’s such a large market, but we know that eventually just means more opportunity!\n\nTell us the “ah-ha” moment when you knew this business was something you had to keep pursuing.\n\nGetting the initial feedback from customers and hearing things like, “This is the only swaddle my baby will sleep in now” or “I was going back to work after my maternity leave was up and I felt so much better knowing my baby would at least smell me and feel like I was with her while I was gone” are the things that make it all worth pursuing. The Mookabee is based on a scientifically proven concept that’s been used for quite some time in NICUs across the country. We knew it would have a big impact on parents and babies but hearing that firsthand from those who are using it is an “ah-ha” moment over and over again.\n\nWhat is a typical day like running the company?\n\nThe day-to-day varies but typically involves monitoring our sales performance, reviewing marketing campaigns, and exploring growth opportunities. We also spend time addressing customer inquiries, feedback, and concerns promptly and effectively. As a small business, it’s important to us that we focus on maintaining strong customer relationships and gather insights to continuously improve the customer experience. Other days are spent identifying new opportunities for expansion, partnerships, or collaborations, as well as exploring potential markets, researching new product ideas, and evaluating potential risks and benefits.\n\nHow does the company differentiate itself from competitors in the industry?\n\nThere is absolutely nothing else like this in the baby space. It is the only swaddle that actually uses a parent’s scent to help soothe your baby.\n\nWhat are the most important traits you believe an entrepreneur must have to create a successful business?\n\nTenacity and dedication. You have to be fearless and just go after what you want and continue to believe in your product or business no matter what stands in your way, otherwise, it becomes too overwhelming.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone just starting their own business?\n\nMake sure you have a solid business plan in place. Assume that it will cost more and take longer than you originally think, but don’t give up on it. Keep pushing forward!\n\nHow does the company give back through philanthropic efforts?\n\nWe are not only passionate about the well-being of babies and mothers but also about making a positive impact on the world. That’s why we are proud to contribute to the cause of eradicating preventable maternal deaths and birth-related complications among women by donating a portion of all proceeds the non-profit organization, Saving Mothers, that is dedicated to this important mission. We also donate our swaddle to local organizations that assist moms in need.\n\nWhat are the company’s plans and goals for growth?\n\nWe will be developing new designs, different lovey attachments and eventually a sleepsack for the next stage in baby development. We are also in early negotiations with a hospital group about bringing our product on board.\n\nROOTED IN JERSEY is a series that shines a spotlight on the diverse and thriving businesses that proudly call the Garden State home.
