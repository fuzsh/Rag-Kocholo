        "text": "Rob Lowe is one of few male actors who looks just as appetizing today as he did from when he first appeared on the scene. As The Outsiders alum approaches his 60th birthday in March, the heartthrob actor recently shared with USA Today how he maintains looking youthful. The 9-1-1: Lone Star star revealed he starts his morning with a gratitude list and a prayer, but his morning routine kicks off after he gets an “embarrassing amount” of sleep. Without sharing a specific number with the publication, the father of two just says he gets “tons” of it — “Like, an embarrassing amount.” He doesn’t want fans to think there’s something wrong with him for sleeping so much. Though he says it isn’t 12 hours, he would sleep 12 hours if he could.\n\nRob prioritizes sleep so much, he’ll take a nap while being driven in his Cadillac Escalade. “I have it down to a science. The eye mask, the Bose noise-canceling headphones. And I’m gone.” Along with a solid amount of rest, Lowe follows a low-carb, high-protein Atkins diet. The actor told the outlet he realized in his 30s that he couldn’t eat how he used to and maintain his physique. He’s been maintaining the diet since and became a spokesperson in 2018.\n\nRELATED: Mark Wahlberg, Hugh Jackman Use Popular Longevity Trends\n\nIn October 2021, Lowe explained the benefits of all the sleep he gets and the Atkins diet to GQ magazine. “I’m now getting the studies that are backing up what I have been doing intuitively for years,” he said at the time. “People used to make fun of me. But now the science is catching up — that it’s more than beauty sleep. It’s brain sleep, it’s body sleep, it’s focus.” Along with dieting and sleep, Lowe has been sober from alcohol for over 30 years. He believes the calories and bloating from consuming alcohol adds up, and quitting alcohol has been “super helpful” for him.\n\nThese Celebrities Have March Birthdays\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
