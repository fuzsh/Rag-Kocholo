Born in Newport, Rhode Island on August 25, 1916, Van appeared with Gene in Pal Joey on Broadway in 1940 and they remained friends for life. Van often spoke about how he would find Gene quietly rehearsing alone in the darkened theater—always working to make his performance better. Van wore red socks and wrote his notes to us in red felt marker on yellow legal pads with his name printed in red at the top. He called Gene “Gene Bones” in a note to Gene in 1986, with a smiley face in the “O.” He said, regarding a recent tribute to Gene, “Lots of fond memories flashed before me, because, after all, I saw most of those exciting numbers shot = You were the hardest working actor on the lot = But look what you’ve left the world for all to see & enjoy & the inspiration for all the young ons coming up…” Van was in Pilot No. 5 (1943) with Gene and also starred with Gene in Brigadoon (1954). Gene tried to get a TV series set in Paris starring Van off the ground in 1964, but it didn’t fly. I like the fact that stars regularly stopped by the sets at MGM to say hello to their friends. In this photo, it is Van saying hello to Gene and Judy Garland who were readying for The Pirate (1948). That’s right. Friends.\n\n#genekelly #genekellylegacy #vanjohnson #judygarland\".",
