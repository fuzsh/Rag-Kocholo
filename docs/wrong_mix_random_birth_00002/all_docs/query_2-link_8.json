        "text": "Looking back on Judy Garland’s movies I’ve seen, I can\n\nhonestly say I haven’t seen a movie I didn’t like. Even though some pictures were\n\nbetter than others, I can’t say any of Judy’s films were “bad”. Hoping this\n\nstreak will continue, I joined the Third Judy Garland Blogathon by reviewing For\n\nMe and My Gal! This film was recommended by the Brannan sisters from Pure\n\nEntertainment Preservation Society. They not only introduced me to this film,\n\nthey introduced me to the Breen Code era! Between 1934 to 1954, the Breen Code\n\nserved as a set of guidelines for film-makers. These guidelines addressed the\n\ndos and don’ts of movie-making based on a series of morals. Within that period\n\nof time, Hollywood gave their audience films that have stood the test of time\n\nand even become “classics”. But will this statement hold true for For Me and\n\nMy Gal? Keeping reading my review to find out!\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nThe on-screen chemistry: Since I chose to review this movie\n\nfor the Third Judy Garland Blogathon, I want to discuss Judy’s performance in For\n\nMe and My Gal. However, I want to talk about her performance in relation to\n\nher on-screen chemistry with Gene Kelly. When a movie musical features a\n\nromantic relationship, the on-screen chemistry of the lead actor and actress\n\ncan sell the idea their characters truly love one another. This is what Gene\n\nand Judy achieved through their portrayals of Harry Palmer and Jo Hayden! One\n\nperfect example is presented during the musical number, “For Me and My Gal”.\n\nThrough facial expressions, the choreography, and their singing abilities, Jo\n\nand Harry realize they share the same dream, despite being complete strangers\n\nonly hours ago. This musical number emphasizes how these characters were always\n\nmeant to be together.\n\nHow World War I was incorporated: For Me and My Gal takes place in the middle of the 1900s, the time when World War I took place. The story revolves around civilian perspectives; vaudeville\n\nperformers trying to make their dreams come true. At the beginning of the\n\nmovie, newspaper headlines broadcast events related to World War I. But the\n\nnewspaper’s front page is turned away from the characters, as they are more\n\nconcerned with how their performances were reviewed by the critics. As the\n\nstory progresses, World War I starts to take center stage in their lives,\n\naffecting each character differently. This progression is steady and the\n\nchanges happen more subtly. The way World War I was incorporated into For Me\n\nand My Gal felt realistic. Though fictional musical movies require a\n\ncertain amount of disbelief to be suspended, it was refreshing for realism to\n\nbe woven into the film.\n\nA story with stakes: Movie musicals, especially those from\n\nthe Breen Code era, contain simpler stories. These stories range from looking\n\nfor another member of a talent group or characters expressing their love for\n\neach other. In For Me and My Gal, the overarching\n\nstory focuses on characters working toward their dreams. Throughout the movie,\n\nJo and Harry experience obstacles and attempt to overcome them. At one point in\n\nthe film, Harry receives an offer to perform at The Palace, a theatre in New\n\nYork every vaudeville performer aspires to go. While the offer itself sounds\n\namazing, the problem is Harry would no longer be able to perform with Jo. This\n\nis one example of For Me and My Gal containing a story with stakes. In\n\nthe case of the aforementioned conflict, there were stakes not only for Harry’s\n\ncareer, but also for his relationship with Jo.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nThe “insta-love” trope: In stories where a romantic\n\nrelationship in included, part of the story is devoted to showcasing the\n\nprogression of that relationship. If a story’s relationship moves too quickly,\n\nit may be difficult for the audience to become invested in that relationship or\n\ndetermine if the actors have on-screen chemistry. While Judy Garland and Gene\n\nKelly had good on-screen chemistry, I found their characters’ initial attraction\n\nto happen too quickly. In fact, this attraction happened so quickly, it almost\n\nfelt unbelievable. I recognize there’s only so much story to tell in an hour\n\nand forty-four minutes. However, I wish Harry and Jo’s attraction for one\n\nanother had taken its time.\n\nAn unresolved debt: Toward the beginning of For Me and My\n\nGal, Jo’s brother, Danny, pays Jo a visit after one of her shows. During\n\ntheir conversation, Jo tells Danny she will pay him back after she becomes a\n\nbig vaudeville star. But this is the only time throughout the movie where this\n\ndebt is mentioned. The debt is not revisited or resolved as the story progresses.\n\nThat part of the story ended up becoming a loose end that was left behind by\n\nthe end of the movie.\n\nA confusing conflict: For this part of my review, I will\n\nspoil For Me and My Gal. If you have not seen this movie and are\n\ninterested in watching it, skip this part of my review and continue reading where\n\nit says “My overall impression”.\n\nAfter Jo and Harry discover their love for each other, they\n\nreceive a telegram congratulating them on their upcoming performance at The\n\nPalace, a theatre in New York they have dreamed about for so long. When they\n\narrive at The Palace, Harry and Jo learn there was a misunderstanding. They\n\nreceived a gig at The Palace theatre in Newark, New Jersey. In the telegram, its\n\nsender stated The Palace was in New York. But any performer on the vaudeville\n\nscene would know there’s only one Palace theatre, the one in New York City.\n\nThat quote in the telegram references how Eve Minard, a singer Jo and Harry met\n\non a train trip, brought up the idea of more than one Palace theatre. For Me\n\nand My Gal was released during the Breen Code era. When a character makes a\n\npoor choice within a film from this time period, they either face accountability\n\nfor that choice or learn from their mistake. However, Eve is never confronted\n\nabout the telegram. This leaves me confused, wondering if Eve was intentionally\n\nruining Harry and Jo’s plans or if she was genuinely trying to help, but her\n\nmessage became lost in translation?\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nThe term, “The Golden Age of Hollywood”, gets thrown around\n\nfrom time to time in conversations about the film industry. This term’s\n\ndefinition depends on who you ask, as film itself can be subjective. In my\n\nopinion, one of Hollywood’s “golden ages” was the Breen Code era. For Me and My Gal serves as one example to prove my point. The 1942 picture sets itself apart from other musical films by\n\npresenting a story with stakes. It also incorporates World War I in a realistic\n\nway. As I’ve stated in past reviews, the strength of a musical movie lies in\n\nits musical numbers. For the most part, For Me and My Gal features\n\nmusical numbers that are pleasant to watch! This is the second Judy Garland\n\nproduction I reviewed this year I was not only recommended, but ended up liking\n\nas well. The streak of enjoyable Judy Garland movies I mentioned in this review’s\n\nintroduction is still going strong!\n\nOverall score: 7.6 out of 10\n\nHave you seen For Me and My Gal? What is your\n\nfavorite movie of Judy Garland’s? Please let me know in the comment section!\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen"
