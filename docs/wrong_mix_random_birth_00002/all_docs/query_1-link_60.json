He is well remembered for his long solo rendition of “Caravan,” his signature piece.\n\nHe recorded with Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Sidney Bechet, Billie Holiday, Bobby Hackett, Don Byas, Red Norvo, Perry Como, Bunny Berigan, Bud Freeman, Dave Newcomb, Clyde Newcomb, Judy Garland, Eddie Fisher, Mel Torme, Teddy Wilson, Eddie Condon, Artie Shaw, Woody Herman, Paul Whiteman, Bing Crosby and most importantly Frank Sinatra, who chose Mr. Blowers to be his drummer in 1943.\n\nMr. Blowers’s first real break was with Bobby Hackett’s small band at Nick’s in Greenwich Village, performing with such luminaries as Eddie Condon and Pee Wee Russell. Nick’s was the place to be seen in 1937 and by April 1938 he had joined Bunny Berigan’s big band.\n\nLater in 1938 he recorded with Teddy Wilson (“Don’t Be That Way”) and also performed with Jan Savitt and Ben Bernie.\n\nMr. Blowers always seemed to be in the right place at the right time. Possibly it was his drumming that helped make Judy Garland’s, “On The Atchison, Topeka and Sante Fe,” Buddy Clark’s, “Linda,” Louis Armstrong’s, “Blueberry Hill,” or Perry Como’s, “Prisoner of Love” such big hits. He continued as staff musician for CBS, NBC and ABC through television’s early days in the 1950’s.\n\nHe spent nearly a year at Eddie Condon’s Jazz Club in 1947 and briefly owned his own club, the Club Blowers, in Queens, New York that same year. In the early 1960’s, he accepted an offer to host his own radio show on Long Island where he would play music and do interviews. Mr. Blowers recorded interviews with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Gene Krupa and many others.\n\nIn the 1970’s the renewal of interest in traditional jazz and swing music led to many gigs at festivals and clubs. He spent a number of years in the Broadway show “Follies” as one of the musicians who performed on stage with a small jazz band.\n\nMr. Blowers recorded an album (“Those Giants of Jazz”) in 1991 and continued touring the world with the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band. He joined the band in 1986 and spent the next 20 years with the band until 2005 when he became too ill to continue.\n\nHe also appeared in a rock video by the band They Might Be Giants (“They’ll Need A Crane”) in the early 1990’s.\n\nMr. Blowers’s autobiography is “Back Beats And Rim Shots,” published by Scarecrow Press, Inc. (1997).\n\nHis sister, Catherine Ivy, survives him as well as his youngest son, Ronald, his daughter-in-law Frances, his daughter, Deborah Lewis, and her husband, Arne, and his grandsons Robin and Owen.\n\nThis obituary edited from the Westbury Times (Long Island).\n\nBack to top\n\nHorace Diaz Jr.\n\nHorace Diaz Jr., 97, a pianist and an 802 member since 1929, died on May 25.\n\nBorn in Vera Cruz, Mexico, he moved with his family to New Orleans as a child.

He was an accomplished baseball player and was recruited by the Minor Leagues. He served two years in the Army. He earned a Ph.D. from Brown and eventually became executive director of the Classics Department of the University of Illinois, where he joined the AFM local there.

Following the outbreak of World War II, Ms. Ghent and her family immigrated to New York where she continued her violin studies at the Juilliard Preparatory School with Dorothy De Lay and her former teacher Galamian, who had recently immigrated to America. She also began studying viola with William Kroll and Hans Lenz and developed a lifelong love of chamber music during summers spent as a string quartet coach at Meadowmount, in Westport, New York. Ms. Ghent graduated from the High School of Music and Art in 1951 and entered Sarah Lawrence College as a scholarship student, graduating with a B.A. in 1955.\n\nMs. Ghent worked extensively as a violist in the New York musical world.

Years later, Olman would tell his own son how his three brothers would beat on the door to get him out.\n\nEven though times were hard for the family during the Depression, the family sacrificed to pay for violin lessons for young Olman.\n\n”He was a prodigy,” Mel Olman said of his father. “He was a very gifted violinist.”\n\nAt 16, he was touring Europe, giving concert performances. Later, he went on to graduate from Julliard.\n\nOlman was a student of Joseph Schillinger, a well-known teacher of music who gave private lessons in composition. As a young adult, Olman learned the Schillinger System of Music, a method of composition that uses mathematical processes.\n\n”Dad’s notebooks would be filled with mathematical equations to lead a 100-piece orchestra,” recalled Ronald Olman.\n\nIt was in January 1942, while working as a bandleader at a Manhattan club, that Olman met a ballet student. By October that year, Barbra and David Olman had married.\n\nAfter working for years as a well-known society bandleader in Manhattan, the Olmans relocated to Miami Beach, attracted by the seaside’s city romance and glamour.\n\nNat King Cole, Dorothy Dandridge, Jerry Lewis, Ann-Margret and Milton Berle were headliners at the Beach clubs. In addition to playing the violin, Olman would conduct for these stars at the Fontainebleau and the Eden Roc throughout the 1950’s and 60’s.\n\n”We would watch these shows and be escorted to the front row to see all these performers and meet them backstage,” Mel Olman said. “It was wild for us. The Big Central Park West apartment with a sunken living room, and the perks like Dad’s jobs in fancy resorts, we’d eat and dine for free all summer long.”\n\nIn addition to his love of music, Olman enjoyed golf, chess and reading.\n\nMusic was a passion throughout his life. ”He listened to music everyday and invited guests over often,” Ronald Olman said.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his wife.\n\nThis obituary from the Miami Herald.\n\nBack to top\n\nFrank Reysen\n\nFrank Reysen, 93, a pianist and an 802 member since 1935, died on June 14.\n\nMr. Reysen entertained hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers during a 60-year career as a professional piano player, organist and band leader..\n\nHe began his music career in the early 1930’s as featured pianist with the George Carroll Orchestra, playing at the old Fordham Collegiate Club in the Bronx.

In the 70’s, Mr. Reysen turned to the organ and played many engagements at restaurants and colleges in Rockland County, NY.\n\nMr. Reysen is survived by his son Frank Jr., daughter Joan DePalma, son-in-law Pat, and grandchildren Joanne and Michael.\n\nBack to top\n\nHoward Shanet\n\nHoward Shanet, 87, a conductor, composer and professor at Columbia University who wrote an important history of the New York Philharmonic, died on June 19. He had been a Local 802 member since 1946.\n\nAs a conductor, Mr. Shanet appeared with several major American orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic and the Boston Symphony, and he frequently performed in New York with the organizations he founded, Music-in-the-Making and String Revival. He was partial to new music and unusual works that had become eclipsed, like Sousa’s operetta “El Capitan”; a Schubert opera, “Die Zwillingsbrüder” (“The Twin Brothers”), for which he commissioned an English libretto from Chester Kallman; and Gottschalk’s “Night in the Tropics,” which became popular in the 1970’s in Mr. Shanet’s reconstruction.\n\nMr. Shanet began his musical studies as a cellist and earned a bachelor’s degree at Columbia in 1939 and a master’s in musicology, as a student of Paul Henry Lang, at Columbia in 1941. That year he joined the faculty of Hunter College. He also served in the Pacific from 1942 to 1946.\n\nAfter World War II Mr. Shanet studied composition with Bohuslav Martinu and Aaron Copland and conducting with Serge Koussevitzky and Fritz Stiedry. He was a conducting assistant to Leonard Bernstein at the New York City Symphony in the early 1950’s and wrote program notes for the New York Philharmonic in 1959 and 1960.\n\nHe eventually returned to the Philharmonic in a different guise, as a historian researching his “Philharmonic: A History of New York’s Orchestra,” published in 1975. Four years later, when books about the orchestra by Henry Edward Krehbiel, James Gibbons Huneker and John Erskine were reissued together as “Early Histories of the New York Philharmonic,” Mr. Shanet wrote an introduction and historical notes. He also published a music textbook, “Learn to Read Music,” in 1956.\n\nIn 1953 Mr. Shanet joined Columbia as a professor of music and a conductor of the university’s orchestra. He was chairman of Columbia’s music department from 1972 to 1978 and later was a professor emeritus.\n\nAs a composer, Mr. Shanet wrote music for orchestra, string quartet and band.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Bernice Grafstein and son Laurence Paul Shanet.\n\nThis obituary from the New York Times.\n\nBack to top\n\nJoseph Siegelman\n\nJoseph Siegelman, 84, a violinist and an 802 member since 1940, died on March 14.\n\nMr. Siegelman was born in Jersey City.

He is also survived by a brother Henry, nephews Robert, David and Steven, five grandnephews and two grandnieces.\n\nBack to top\n\nAlfredo Silipigni\n\nAlfredo Silipigni, 72, a conductor and an 802 member since 1964, died on March 25.\n\nA conductor whose international career included appearances with the Vienna State Opera, English National Opera, Teatrale L’Opera de Montreal and Opera de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, Mr. Silipigni was particularly renowned for his skill conducting “verismo,” a style and repertoire that required an instinctive feeling for free tempo.\n\nPlacido Domingo was known to request him when singing verismo, and Mr. Silipigni was responsible for staging productions featuring verismo stars such as Magda Olivero and Giuseppe Taddei, who were rarely invited to America’s larger opera houses.\n\nCritic Andrew Porter, in London’s Financial Times, once commented that “Newark may perhaps be the last place in which to see authentic verismo stagings.”\n\n“He was unique in all the world,” said Duane Printz, artistic director of Teatro Grattacielo in New York, which presents little-known verismo repertoire and worked with Mr. Silipigni for three seasons. “There’s no one left who understands the difficulty of verismo. He knew how to bring it to life.”\n\nMr. Silipigni, with his pencil-sharp mustache, slicked hair and pinstripe suits, also was the epitome of the cultured gentleman, never known in a 50-year conducting career to raise his voice to even the most difficult diva.\n\nBorn in Atlantic City and educated at Juilliard and Westminster Choir College of Rider University, Mr. Silipigni also played piano every night until just before his death, his daughter said, and was once an organist at Radio City Music Hall. He made his conducting debut with the prestigious NBC Symphony Orchestra at age 25.\n\nBut New Jersey State Opera, which Mr. Silipigni guided from an amateur group to a professional company with international standards, was his first love.\n\nAlso a specialist in Verdi, Mr. Silipigni led the company in mainstream repertoire as well as a few attempts at contemporary premieres.\n\nMetropolitan Opera stars like Licia Albanese and Jerome Hines were longtime allies and supporters of Mr. Silipigni’s company, often starring in productions.\n\nA long list of stars were wooed to New Jersey by Mr. Silipigni, including Domingo, Birgit Nilsson (singing her last stateside Turandot), Franco Corelli, Carlo Bergonzi, Roberta Peters, Beverly Sills, Richard Tucker and the verismo specialists Giuseppe Taddei and Magda Olivero.\n\nMr. Silipigni’s greatest legacy, perhaps, was convincing a small group of funders and supporters that New Jersey, wedged between Philadelphia and New York’s glittering opera scene, deserved a company of its own.\n\nMr. Silipigni is survived by his wife Gloria, daughters Marisa and Elizabeth, son Alfred, and two grandchildren. The family requests that donations may be made to the New Jersey State Opera, 50 Park Place, Newark, N.J. 07102.\n\nThis obituary edited from the Newark Star-Ledger.\n\nBack to top\n\nFlorian ZaBach\n\nFlorian ZaBach, 87, a violinist and conductor and an 802 member since 1950, died on Feb. 25.\n\nBorn in Chicago, he was the son of Florian ZaBach Sr., a native of Austria who played clarinet with the Vienna Philharmonic, and the late Anna Morganfort-ZaBach. An only child, he began his study of music first with his father, then at the Chicago Cosmopolitan Conservatory of Music, and had further violin studies at the Prague Conservatory in Czechoslovakia.\n\nA child prodigy, who at the age of 12 made his debut with the Chicago Symphony orchestra playing the Mendelssohn concerto, Mr. ZaBach is best known for his million-selling record “The Hot Canary,” which attracted worldwide acclaim, and for his speed in playing “The Flight of the Bumblebee,” about which “Believe It or Not,” which clocked the performance, wrote, “he plays 12.8 notes per second … faster than any known violinist in history.”\n\nUpon his return to the states, he joined the music staff of Chicago’s NBC and WGN radio stations. Then he served 2.5 years in the Army Medical Corps as a private and a corporal. After his honorable discharge, his music career reached great heights upon being discovered in Washington, D.C., where, as the personable orchestra leader at the Mayflower Hotel, he became a favorite of the social set of the elite political scene. It was there that he was chosen by television’s Arthur Godfrey, who presented Mr. ZaBach on his shows several times each month for years. This led to multiple appearances on most of the mega-television shows emanating from New York at the time: Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle, Ken Murray, Red Skelton, Steve Allen, Jack Parr and 25 appearances on the “Tonight Show,” as well as his weekly CBS-TV shows from the Big Apple. For more than a year, he performed five one-hour shows daily, seven days a week as master of ceremonies, orchestra conductor and violin soloist on the stage of Strand Theatre on Broadway.\n\nThen the tall, handsome blonde was called to Hollywood, where he was signed to film the new “Florian ZaBach” show, a weekly half-hour television series that was syndicated and carried nationwide in more than 90 markets, as well as most major cities throughout the world.\n\nAs his reputation progressed, each year Mr. ZaBach received more bids to appear with major symphony orchestras as soloist and conductor on their pops concerts here and in London, Vienna, Austria, and Genoa and Venice, Italy; Australia, and Bejing, among other concert halls. His musical arrangements and compositions are on record in the Florian ZaBach collection in the Library of Congress.\n\nMr. ZaBach recorded countless albums for Mercury and Decca (on which he recorded his million-selling “The Hot Canary”). During most of his career, his constant companion was his 1732 Guarnerius del Gesu violin, created in Cremona, Italy.\n\nSurviving is a stepdaughter, Julia Shartzer.\n\nThis obituary from the Scranton Times-Tribune."
