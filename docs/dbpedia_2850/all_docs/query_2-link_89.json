On August 9, the nation will congregate at the historic Padang to celebrate how far we've come together and pledge to unite on the path ahead.\n\nBesides the state flag flypast, flashy 'Salute-to-the-Nation' bomb burst flown by fighter aircraft and dizzying aerial displays by the RSAF, the most highly-anticipated aspect of the National Day Parade has got to be the fireworks display. This year, the main fireworks show will occur in the Marina Bay area alongside simultaneous displays at five locations in the heartlands. Keen to catch the dazzling display? Here are the best places to catch the NDP 2024 fireworks in Singapore.\n\nStay in the loop: sign up for ourfree Time Out Singapore newsletter for the best of the city straight to your inbox."
