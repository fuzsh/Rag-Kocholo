        "text": "Crossposted with the Basics post on branching\n\nFollow-up post on the entire Circle Line published in 2023 here\n\nAs I wrote the Branching post, I realised that the amount of stuff needed to be worked out on the Circle Line, was a bit too much for a case study. To avoid having to redo everything, the entire CCL case study from that post has been pasted here. Anyways, it deserves to be a page on its own, given the amount of shit that I have to clear here. Enjoy reading! ~AMC\n\nThis is the elephant in the room we need to address today.\n\nThe Circle Line Stage 6, or CCL6, is a plan to close the “circle”, after 16 long years, in 2025. However, LTA’s plans on how the CCL6 would interface with existing infrastructure is, at best, mildly alarming. It has had a lot to do with a fundamental theorem involved in public transportation, especially railways: branching. With LTA’s complicated ways of running train services, the “branches” and “mainlines” are complicated and counterintuitive, and to the average man, they would pass it off as another “improvement” to their commute. Except that this “upgrade” is not an upgrade, not at least to the parts that need it the most.\n\nIf our rail network is a family, we can say that the CCL is often the sick child – oft-plagued with problems despite it being fairly new. (The NSL is the ageing ah kong having cough every 2 days or so)\n\nAnd to add on to that, one more commuting woe those travelling on the CCL regularly have is – the trains are so. damn. crowded. Even during off-peak hours. Well you can blame that on LTA’s poor planning when they initially came up with the “Marina LRT“, and that was a legacy that carried over into the CC and DT lines, evident in the 3-car trains (they probably learned that an APM is NOT a LRT).\n\nThe branching issue isn’t exactly serious today, but in the future it may have some disastrous consequences if not addressed (and LTA’s mathematically unsound plan for CCL6 taken carte blanche).\n\nPresently, there are 2 types (actually no, it’s 3) of services running on the CCL:\n\nMainline: Dhoby Ghaut (8) to HarbourFront (9)\n\nBranch (off-peak): Stadium (no EDN) to Marina Bay (10)\n\nBranching Service (Peak only): HarbourFront (9) to Marina Bay (10)\n\nAnd here’s the mathematically unsound plan, or the official one from LTA (I have my reasons, read on!)\n\nAnti-clockwise\n\nClockwise (I’m not sure how the (8) and (9) destination circles will be dealt with after this though)\n\nThis weird arrangement running from Dhoby Ghaut to Prince Edward, then turning back to DBG from there.\n\nIn a shellnut, the Dhoby Ghaut to Promenade section becomes the branch, and Marina Bay-Bayfront section becomes the mainline\n\nNoticed anything?\n\nIn both arrangements, the branch and mainlines share tracks.\n\nThis means that the frequency on the branch lines is constrained by the frequency on the mainline. Operationally, this means that the lowest headway possible on the branch is 200 seconds, twice that of the mainline’s 100 (based on the constraints of CBTC signalling). That translates to 3 min 20 seconds at least. But in the context of the Circle Line, the minimum frequency is 2 mins (presumably due to the fleet shortage – 64 trains running on 71 km of track.)\n\nMind you – when the service pattern is such that only a short section of track is shared, it is a very wasteful arrangement. This is exemplified in the Circle Line. With only the Promenade – Stadium section being shared, essentially, the rest of the line are “branches”.\n\nThe peak arrangement today is fairly straightforward in terms of defining “mainline” and “branch line”, so I won’t delve too deeply into that.\n\nCome 2025, with the opening of the Circle Line Stage 6 and the completion of the circle, we have a even more mathematically incoherent plan put forth by none other than our big-brained Land Transport Authority. Recap: Besides the continuous loop services, the CCL post-2025 will have a shuttle service operating from Dhoby Ghaut to Prince Edward. On first glance, it looks pretty ok. But this arrangement leaves a gaping hole right smack in the middle of the Marina Bay Financial Center. And worse of all, this leaves the CBD, where MRT service should be highest, with ironically the least service of all the CCL. Happy commuting.\n\nBut the woes don’t end there.\n\nFar out west, there is a booming new town that will be developed in the next decade. (For the ignoramuses, that is Tengah) Already, the western side of the East-West Line is, safe to say, screwed up. So pretty much you have an overcrowded western side which is going to further fill up in the next decade, and the only option into the CBD being… the EWL.\n\nFor the longest time imaginable since the entire Jurong Region Line mania started, talk has been floating around of a possible extension to Haw Par Villa on the Circle Line. This could have been an alternative route, to at last bring some relief to the EWL, by sending commuters down the JRL + CCL path directly to Marina Bay with the completion of CCL6.\n\nBut do you remember this infographic from the Branching article?\n\nLook at the “Branching box”. The proposed service pattern for the Circle Line post-2025 would see something similar to the diagram on the left, except that it is just the line width halving at Prince Edward due to every other train turning back there. This creates a bottleneck, except that it is a transit bottleneck, hindering the movement of commuters. With just one station short of Marina Bay, most commuters would still go by the JRL + EWL instead as it (1) brings them directly into the CBD, (2) doesn’t dump them barely 1 stop before their destination.\n\nOr, they might just flock to the JRL + CCL alternative in large numbers. When that time comes, will we see a repeat of Bishan at Prince Edward (AM Peak) and Marina Bay (PM Peak)?\n\nIt’s chilling. Either way, the MRT network is screwed with the increasing population (cough White Paper 2013 cough). Hopefully someone decides to change the service plan before it is too late.\n\nLiked this article? Subscribe to SG Transport Critic to receive all the latest articles!"
