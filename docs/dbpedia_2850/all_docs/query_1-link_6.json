        "text": "Bras Basah MRT station lies in the heart of the Historic Civic District in Singapore. As such, one of the design requirements during the international design competition was that the station should not block the Singapore Art Museum.\n\nThe winning underground design from WOHA retains the visual connection to the external environment, with a station roof that doubles up as a reflecting pool and skylight. This brings daylight into the deep station while creating a landscaped water garden for the museum on the surface. When viewed from the park, the pool mirrors the museum against the blue sky; from the station concourse, sunlight and shadows create a dynamic light show.\n\nÂ\n\nLocated next to the National Stadium, station architects WOHA had to address the scale of the large buildings in the vicinity and accommodate for surge crowds during events at the Singapore Indoor Stadium and the National Stadium. An open-air concourse and plaza space at ground-level as well as fare gates at opposite ends of the station offer plenty of space for crowds to snake into queues. The form of the station was inspired by the dynamic flux of human traffic and inflected by the sweeping curves of the stadium. Contrasting a linear element against a curved one, the station design was conceived as a dramatic silver canyon that is breathtaking in scale. As one takes the downward escalators to the platform, the curved wall closes in to reveal a slit of daylight along the entire platform.\n\nÂ\n\nLocated in a public park, Marina Bay MRT station is an integral part of the Marina Bay development and an interchange station for the North-South and Circle lines. The stationâs design integrates it Â into the park through landscaping. A translucent canopy allows natural light to penetrate deep into the underground concourse. To minimise the visual impact of the station on the surrounding park, only elements such as the lift, entrance glazed enclosure, lightweight canopy and reflective pool are visible on the ground level. As one exits from the station, commuters are greeted with a panoramic view of the landscape."
