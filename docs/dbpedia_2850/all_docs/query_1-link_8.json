        "text": "An extension off the previous post on rail-rail interchange types covered internationally, here I’ll classify all of Singapore’s rail interchanges based on the types I’ve listed in the previous post. Requested by a fellow reader, enjoy! E:D Also included: personal comments on each of those nodes, and perhaps a truckload a pinch of shitting on some extremely *well-designed, integrated* stations. As more stations open progressively (cue TEL stage 3, JRL, and the Cross Island Line), this post will be updated asap to reflect new-formed interchange stations.\n\n25/3/23 update: Added entries for TEL stage 3 new interchanges\n\nPreamble\n\nFor the frequent MRT riders (like most who frequent this site, presumably), an increasingly common feature that we go through on our regular commutes would be the “transfer station”, or “interchange”. Put simply, those are “intersection stations” where two lines meet, and passengers are allowed to change trains between different lines (or services). As more rail lines open, increasing the overall catchment and network length of the MRT system, the network effect (being a partially connective network in the CBD, as well as increasingly so elsewhere) increases. For the power of a connective network, no matter how partial, to be realised, the connections made must be excellent, in other to fully harness the ability to travel freely, and quickly on a 2-dimensional plane. Due to our quirky form of planning, all sorts of connection styles have emerged, and while some are as good even on an international level, most are really so mediocre that even at home they are big laughingstocks, if not for the pain they inflict on commuters forced to use them twice or more daily.\n\nInterchanges – The Good\n\n1) Raffles Place – City Hall pair\n\n2) Bayfront\n\n3) Sengkang and Punggol\n\n1) Raffles Place – City Hall\n\nSince the East-West and the North-South lines were planned together (even the concept of them being two separate lines only became a thing 10 or so years after the Initial System was completed), it was a logical choice, and the right one at that, to pull the best interchanging scheme at the two “central” stations in downtown Singapore in 1988 – the paired stacked-island cross-platform transfer configuration that practically every world-class metro attempts to utilise at some point.\n\nArguably the best transfer scheme in existence currently in Singapore, the City Hall and Raffles Place stations offer the most convenient transfers — to transfer in either direction only requires walking 10m across the platform at the correct station — Raffles Place for trains heading the same way, and City Hall for opposite-direction trains on the NSEWL.\n\nOf course, as usual, SMRT Trains does the pretty horrific thing of marring what would have been the perfect interchange set-up, by botching the train arrival and departure timetables at off-peak hours. What this means, is that as your train pulls into the station, and as you just intend to do the Olympic-esque 20m dash across the platform to transfer, the train on the other side closes its doors securely shut before your train opens its doors, thus you have to wait the full 5 minutes for the next train. Ugh. (If you’re unlucky, or if you’re heading towards Tuas Link, you might have to wait longer) Why can’t the trains be timed such that they open and close their doors at the same time though? Is it a track configuration thing between City Hall and Raffles Place that imposes some sort of constraint…? It would make the transfer experience much more pleasant, saving us yet another 5 minutes of travel time.\n\n2) Bayfront\n\nNearly 25 years after opening the first paired stacked-island cross platform transfer, yet another stacked-island cross platform transfer appears — this time as a single stacked-island cross platform transfer.\n\nRumor has it that Bayfront was the stepchild of a failed Marina Line, with its four branches converging here, hence necessitating a cross-platform transfer that would have become the paired CPT after the initial two transfer stations of the MRT. Heck, some theories even suggest a triplet stacked-island CPT, with Bayfront, Promenade, and Nicoll Highway all utilising such a formation!\n\nOf course, two of the three were aborted, one completely being rebuilt into a conventional station, and the other leaving signs of what greatness it could have been had things went as planned.\n\nAgain, again: What’s up with the non-coordination in train timings? It’s really frustrating to see the intended train pull off just as you arrive! Is it because of the imposed barrier between two different operators? Well, as I said last year, silo culture is a bad habit I high time suggest the transport industry get rid of. Like many other human-related things, transportation systems exist in connection to each other, and imposing those barriers is, for the lack of a better word, non-ideal.\n\n3) Sengkang and Punggol\n\nSurprisingly, I found myself putting two APM-MRT interchanges ahead of the pack in terms of connection design.\n\nFor Sengkang and Punggol, the transfer process is really, a simple case of going up the escalator to the concourse level, and then taking another set of escalators up to the APM platforms, completing the transfer within 90 seconds even if you passively wait for the escalator to carry you up. Aside from my quibble with just how astonishingly high they elevated the tiny APM platforms, about the height of the 5th storey in a HDB block, further unneccessarily extending the transfer time needed and inducing acrophobia, it’s surprisingly integrated for a rail-rail connection in Singapore.\n\nThankfully, they also boarded over the middle track at Punggol, so there is no longer a problem of “going up the wrong escalator” — going up and down again, even at the fastest, is equivalent to the in-vehicle travel time from Somerset to Dhoby Ghaut! Whew.\n\nBonus points awarded for air-conditioning the entire 5-storey high concourse area. And more bonuses for placing same-direction escalators right beside each other i.e. no confluence of human traffic.\n\nInterchanges – the meh\n\n4) Tanah Merah (pre-2024)\n\n5) Jurong East\n\n6) Bishan\n\n7) MacPherson\n\n8) Chinatown\n\n9) Choa Chu Kang (APM – NSL)\n\n10) Dhoby Ghaut (CCL – NSL)\n\n11) HarbourFront\n\n12) Woodlands\n\n13) Caldecott\n\n14) Stevens\n\n15) Orchard\n\n16) Outram Park (EWL – TEL)\n\n4) Tanah Merah (pre-2024)\n\nAnother relic of old 1980s-style “patterned” planning following a bunch of unspoken conventions, Tanah Merah presents itself as a double-island centric cross-platform transfer between the EWL mainline and the Changi branch. (The alleged unspoken convention here: building a double island instead of a single island platform (and train depot) at the “9th station” out from the CBD, hence known as the “9-station rule”.)\n\nFor now, the arrangement is particularly handy: to have the Changi spur tucked neatly in between the eastbound and westbound platforms, thus allowing convenient transfers for the large crowds going between the city and Changi Airport. A transfer that was necessitated by changing EWL service patterns to isolate the Changi spur from the mainline, it is made up much more for by far improved frequencies on the mainline and the convenience of changing trains here.\n\n5) Jurong East\n\nDitto Tanah Merah above, but with the JEMP’s addition of 1 island platform to the mix born out of requirement (due to the necessary frequency of the NSL that terminates there), things get slightly complicated with the newly-added Platform A. Unfortunately, this complication also means I’d rank Jurong East slightly behind Tanah Merah because passengers coming into Platform A don’t exactly have a convenient transfer path to westbound trains at Platform F, being separated by 2 tracks in between…\n\nThe more effective solution I proposed, which involves transforming the current triple island set-up into a City Hall/Raffles Place-style stacked island cross-platform transfer, can be found here.\n\n6) Bishan\n\nBeing stuck in an odd configuration of being an interchange station between an at-grade and underground line, Bishan does… okay-ish, when compared to the four other instances (Bukit Panjang, Tampines, Buona Vista, Paya Lebar)\n\nAs someone who goes through this interchange station often, the one thing that irks me most is how the transfer between the northbound NSL platform and the CCL is significantly longer than that between the southbound NSL platform and CCL… and to make matters worse the escalator from the transfer linkway to the northbound platform is placed at such a distance from the actual Circle Line platform a travellator is actually feasible!\n\nAs a side note, I don’t get what’s up with all the inclines around Bishan station either…\n\n7) MacPherson\n\nMacPherson station utilises what I call the “1+2” perpendicular stack layout, in which two lines cross at right angles to each other, one using an island platform and the other with a pair of side platforms.\n\nThe implications of such a layout are clear: it provices convenience, only if you are on the correct end of the train (in this case, if you’re coming in on the Circle Line). For MacPherson station, this isn’t too big a problem given two things, first, that the Circle Line platform is short (because the trains are short O.o) and that the Downtown Line station is centered underneath the Circle Line platform. Why does this matter? See Chinatown station below.\n\n8) Chinatown\n\nAlso using the 1+2 perpendicular stack, Chinatown ranks behind MacPherson station for one key reason: the DTL platforms don’t center above the NEL platform.\n\nRather, the DTL platforms are flushed to the northern end of the NEL platform, likely because the street alignment above ground necessitated it as such. What this however means is that you are not going to enjoy the benefits of a 1+2 perpendicular stack as much if you happen to be coming into Chinatown station on the HarbourFront end of the train. Also this flush introduces a heck lot of complexity into the station concourse, something I still can’t quite wrap my head around even though DTL stage 1 has been around for nearly a decade…\n\n9) Choa Chu Kang (APM – NSL)\n\nTypically one can expect to place platforms right next to each other and connections should not become a major issue. Choa Chu Kang is no exception with the convenient transfer between the APM and NSL platforms made possible with their proximity.\n\nThere’s just two problems that slightly complicate things and make life a little bit more annoying for those using this as a connection point frequently. First, the APM platform is located at the Jurong East end of the NSL platform, which presents the same problem as in Chinatown — to truly make the transfer convenient you’d have to be at the correct end of the train that opens up to the connecting linkway. And the lack of lifts available for the newly-opened side platforms at the APM station complicate what would have been a simple Spanish-solution terminating style for the APM pods there.\n\n10) Dhoby Ghaut (NSL – CCL)\n\nGenerally isn’t a hassle, as long as the signage is clear as to which escalators send you towards which platforms. Rather than the connection between the NSL and CCL at Singapore’s (prior to the TEL3 opening) sole 3-line interchange station, there is a bigger problem with the inadequacy of the escalators (especially the ones on the NSL platform) to clear passengers in time, resulting in some quite severe bottlenecks during rush hour…\n\n11) HarbourFront\n\nBorn out of sheer accident, the current double terminus between the Circle and North-East lines has a similar layout to the NSL/APM set-up at Choa Chu Kang. Both station boxes are placed side-by-side, making transferring between the two lines an easy job of just going up one set of escalators, walking across and then going down on another, just as if you were crossing the road on an overhead bridge. Quite literally the least complicated way to create an interchange station. Not a fan of going up and down escalators, but sure…\n\n12) Woodlands\n\nHonestly I doubt if the first NSL-TEL connection to open belongs in the “meh” category, given the two extraordinarily long sets of escalators that link the NSL platform to the TEL platform.\n\nBut I still give them credit for at least trying to plan the connection to a certain extent, because it could certainly have been far worse (cue Expo later)\n\nAlso Woodlands takes the Chinatown problem to an extreme: the linkway is flushed all the way to the Marina South Pier end of the NSL platform, and all the way to the Woodlands North end of the TEL platform. Have fun walking the long way if you’re on the “wrong” end of the train 🙂\n\n13) Caldecott\n\nDitto HarbourFront, but one thing I’m taking the pitchfork to Hampshire Road over is the missed opportunity to provide… better connections between the CCL and TEL…\n\nLike seriously, tell me what in the fresh heck is THIS:\n\nThe upper escalators that transverse 1 storey, and the lower escalators that go down the equivalent of 4 HDB storeys… Like seriously, what’s with climbing 5 levels, running up an inclined transfer linkway (seriously, why??) and then running down another 2 levels (and vice versa) to change between the CCL and TEL…?\n\nHonestly, given the fact that the CCL and TEL are basically oriented in the same direction at Caldecott…\n\nwouldn’t it have been possible to tuck the TEL station directly below the CCL station, a la Hung Hom? Plus, construction space to do this wouldn’t have been an issue at all — Caldecott station is 80% surrounded by nothingness, unlike the case of Orchard station (see below) which sits directly underneath many towering malls and office blocks…\n\nA stacked island configuration would save a lot of time for those who transit between the CCL and TEL every day. And perhaps fewer missed trains because it simply takes too long to get to the platform on the other side, something that gets more painful once you factor into account the fact that the TEL has… questionable frequency even in its second stage.\n\n14 – Stevens\n\nWhen the blueprints of the interchanging scheme between the DTL and TEL first appeared on the hoardings where the DTL now links to the TEL (the area around the DTL lift shaft), I was planning to consign this interchange to the lowest of low categories. On the CGI render, it showed a jumbled mess of transfer linkways, lift shafts going everywhere, more concourses all disjoint from each other, and to top off the madness the TEL and DTL sides of the station didn’t even agree what level was what (for instance, DTL B3 (Bukit Panjang-bound platform) was marked as B4 on the TEL side). Enough to give anyone suffering insufficient brainpower a massive headache on sight.\n\nWhen TEL stage 3 opened on 13 Nov 2022, the mess incomprehensible when printed in 2D became clear as we were permitted to roam the station’s corridors: Think of Stevens as a “sandwich” version of perpendicular stack stations the like of Chinatown and MacPherson. Instead of a 1+2 stack (one island, two side platforms), Stevens station forms a unique “1+1+1” stack, where one side platform, one island platform, and one more side platform are stacked in alternating perpendicular alignments on top of each other. The island platform sandwiched in the middle is the newly-opened TEL platforms.\n\nYet another feature of the station that pushes it back up is the cherry on the icing: the signage indicating which platform, as well as the direction of each platform is clearly printed on the signage at the TEL platform. Effectively, it means you know where your DTL train is going before you even reach the DTL platform, helping you navigate better than just a sign that arrows a platform saying “<- to (13) Bukit Panjang”.\n\n15 – Orchard\n\nLike with Caldecott station, the set-up of the TEL platform in relation to the NSL baffles me too:\n\nThe TEL portion of the station is effectively a completely separate station of its own, save the transfer linkway linking the NSL and TEL platforms. In a first, the transfer linkway between the NSL and TEL platforms is also placed beneath the platforms itself (usually, transfer linkways are placed above the platform level for underground stations. TEL stage 3 sets a new precedent in this regard).\n\nAt least, they did provide a (once-again, generously wide) travellator despite the comparatively short transfer distance, compared to a number of others, like Little India, Outram Park etc, which makes it slightly better. Still, transferring at this station feels oddly unnatural. Plus the escalator/lift connections to the TEL are still mostly flushed to the Marina South Pier end of the NSL platform, so do take note of which end of the train you’re on when transferring here.\n\n16 – Outram Park (TEL – EWL)\n\nPerhaps the best-designed transfer of any along the TEL since its initial opening in 2020, the apt placement of the TEL platforms to be right beside the EWL platforms at Outram Park station has allowed this relatively convenient arrangement of side-by-side, “cross the overhead bridge” style of interchanging to take place here. Of course, it’s the result of a happy coincidence where the TEL was running exactly parallel to the EWL for that particular sector, but I will enjoy this convenient transfer, no less.\n\nUnfortunately, placing the TEL with EWL also means, that whatever crap transfer the EWL already has with NEL, the same, if not worse, is expected for the TEL – NEL link. And sure it is.\n\nInterchanges – the bad\n\n17) Serangoon\n\n18) Dhoby Ghaut (NSL/CCL – NEL)\n\n19) Outram Park (all 3 connections)\n\n20) Paya Lebar\n\n21) Buona Vista\n\n22) Little India\n\n23) Expo\n\n24) Bugis\n\n25) Tampines\n\n26) Marina Bay (all 3 connections)\n\n27) Botanic Gardens\n\n17) Serangoon\n\nThe North East Line was an exemplar of silo mentality in planning for its time – and I say that for good reason. With the exception of HarbourFront and the two APM interchange stations on the other end of the NEL, all interchange stations of the North East Line are, I’m sorry to say, an utter mess.\n\nSerangoon. How complicated could it get, just 2 lines crossing each other at right angles where a road junction also exists. Yet some extreme brain planning led instead to Serangoon being a station that requires… travelators??\n\n18) Dhoby Ghaut (NSL/CCL – NEL)\n\nThere are some things in life I absolutely fail to fathom.\n\nLike for instance the need to create a massive labyrinth of escalators and stairways between the sole NSL-NEL interchange station.\n\nIt was bad enough with the need for a travellator between the NSL and NEL before the CCL opened, and when the CCL opened it literally became a steaming spaghetti bowl of escalators and linkways, especially at the atrium at the NEL side…\n\n19) Outram Park (EWL – NEL)\n\nThings have improved a lot since the opening of the new linkway (with the extra-wide travellators) but still lots leave to be desired here. Honestly with the shortening of the transfer distance thanks to the new linkway (which now centers the transfer linkway access, instead of the old one flushed to the Punggol end of the NEL platform and Pasir Ris end of the EWL platform), it could probably make it into the “meh” list, if not for how far apart those platforms were. Bzzzt…\n\nThat’s where it ends however. The link between the NEL and the TEL is, sad to say, atrocious. To borrow terminology from ex-TM Khaw Boon Wan, it’s a “rollercoaster” for your legs, having to continuously go up and down along multiple escalators in order to complete the transfer. From the TEL, one would first have to go down the escalators (worse still, the access link to NEL from TEL platform is located all the way at the GBTB end of the platform). Then after walking a considerable distance you’d have to take another escalator up again, where you will find yourself in the former transfer linkway between the NEL and EWL (since repurposed for the NEL – TEL link). From there, you will have to take yet another escalator down to the NEL platform in order to board the train! Thanks for the meticulous weaving of the transfer hallways up and down, certainly helped us get closer to our daily steps goal.\n\n20) 21) Paya Lebar and Buona Vista\n\nGiven that the two EWL-CCL interchange stations are quite similar in their set-up and have the same bucket of problems I’ll cover them together to save a bit on my storage space.\n\nLike with Woodlands, their main problem is really that it cannot be helped that the transfer distance is insanely long because of the elevation difference between the EWL and the CCL platforms. What makes it far worse for these two stations however is their far more complicated transfer linkways — they have a somewhat confusing mess of pathways to a certain extent like Dhoby Ghaut above.\n\nSide note for Buona Vista station: it’s so messy I had difficulties locating the EWL faregates on my initial visits there. Nice.\n\n22) Little India\n\nHonestly, if LTA wants to screw up the interchanging so bad a 100m-long transfer linkway is needed, I can let it slide if there’s a travellator in place for passengers to rest their feet, as was what was done for all the poorly-thought out NEL interchange stations that came before. Unfortunately Little India… maybe it was due to the “bend” in the transfer linkway or something that busted the chance (again, nothing stops them from just making a straight linkway that would have opened up to the center of the NEL platform, but well). Still, this transfer isn’t exactly the most enjoyable for most going between the northwest and northeast, and want to avoid the Circle Line chaos at Serangoon.\n\nIt’s only slightly more bearable than what goes on at Newton by virtue of the transfer being at least fully within the paid zone.\n\n23) Expo\n\nMy honest take on the DTL’s eastern terminus interchange? Not quite well conceived. Had the footfall Expo station has to experience daily increase significantly to the level seen on the mainline EWL, it would be the same chaos at Buona Vista and Paya Lebar. Expo comes under the ‘bad’ interchange section for the exceptionally long linkway underground from the EWL platform to the DTL platform, as well as the haphazard integration into the existing EWL station structure. (I’d say the same about Tampines, smh)\n\n24) Bugis\n\nThe poor interchanging at almost every DTL interchange station, past present and future (excepting Bayfront) reflects a lack of planning ahead on the part of LTA when the initial MRT systems were conceived — certainly the Downtown Line (or any of the 3 constituent lines that were merged to form it) didn’t show up on the radar when older MRT stations were built, leaving far less room for provisions that were already available, ready to be used when it was time to build new lines. Hopefully this culture changes, and big masterplans that visualise the rail network decades ahead are a good start. (Though I’d say a good question to ask ourselves at this point – what would our rail network look like when Singapore celebrates her 100th anniversary?)\n\n25) Tampines\n\nThe busiest hub in the east is an extreme example of not planning ahead adequately. So you got yourself a station that you want to make an interchange because it is conveniently a hub for one of the largest towns in the vicinity, but your station was built with 1970s plans which completely did not visualise your new line? There you have it.\n\nAnd for those who think the pain ends with entering the DTL station exit after walking through the Tampines station mall – the underground linkway section that joins the DTL platforms to the surface is also quite a stretch, about the same length as the street-level section you walk through to get from the DTL exit to the EWL station. Very nice planning. If only the DTL and EWL could have been better integrated, I could move myself to call Tampines an ITH, a true one at that.\n\n26a) Marina Bay (NSL – CCL)\n\nFor all its faults, the one thing I appreciate about Dhoby Ghaut station is the concept of a huge “underground atrium” (featured above) which was placed at the NEL side of the station, and I definitely love to see wide spaces within our MRT stations, especially key transfer points, given how it isn’t beneficial to keep things cramped underground.\n\nAnd I’m glad the NSL – CCL transfer incorporated this element on the CCL side to make the place feel more open and inviting. What I don’t like however, is the comparatively long walk between the NSL and CCL. And I place the old NSL terminus in this category instead because there could have been a better way to place the CCL platform.\n\nThe NSL concourse at Marina Bay station is particularly interesting, in that it features an octagonal chamber-like structure between the NSL faregates and the NSL platform proper. Which did get me wondering, whether it would have been possible for the CCL and TEL platforms to link to this common chamber, a sort of common atrium for transferring between the 3 lines.\n\n26b) Marina Bay (NSL – TEL, CCL – TEL)\n\nThe existing massive structures of the NSL – CCL transfer already numb me to how overblown structures for a simple two- or three-line rail-rail transfer can get. But what blows me away about the TEL Marina Bay station is not its largeness, but just how sprawling it gets.\n\nTo complicate simple transfers and make them needlessly tiring to complete is one level of failed planning. To transform a train station, a passage from one place to another, into a passage unto itself through its labyrinthine layout, with many branching corridors, multiple chambers each with its own way leading somewhere, is next level messed up.\n\nI must say, just as I thought DTL had been one clusterf*ck when it comes to interchange planning, the basket case of the TEL3 interchange stations did made me facepalm harder. Just how difficult is it to plan decent rail-rail interchanges in Singapore nowadays, given how every line has existed for years in advance on some plan or another. Where were the 90s-style provisions to provide better connections for MRT users when we need it so badly now?\n\n27) Botanic Gardens\n\nPerhaps because the Bukit Timah Line was planned to be technically different from the current Downtown Line as it is today. Yet I honestly wonder how things could have been much different had LTA decided to adopt a cross-platform transfer (or failing that, a basic 1+2 perpendicular stack) at Botanic Gardens station, instead of the long and dark travellator linkway today.\n\nA side note: what the hell is up with the insanely long escalators down to the platforms of new rail lines? Coupled with short station intervals (especially TEL stage 3, cue Havelock and Maxwell, Shenton Way and Marina Bay), the high access penalty of these stations really might mean you might just be faster walking than taking the train!\n\nInterchanges – the absolute WTF\n\n28) Bukit Panjang\n\n29) Newton\n\n30) Promenade\n\n31) Rochor\n\n28) Bukit Panjang\n\nAs they say, “welcome to Bukit Panjang, welcome to hell”. The place is notorious for being anything except what you want your town to be like, be it the snarling traffic, horrid lack of amenities or connectivity, or the joke-of-the-century “ITH” located in their town center.\n\nIn the original Interchanges classification post I inserted this image of the Bukit Panjang station area, and honestly, I think that one pic continues to be able to succinctly explain the level of screwing up that happened with the planning and integration here:\n\nA 10-minute walk to change trains? What is your basis for calling that an “integrated” transport hub, then?\n\n29) Newton\n\nThe sole NSL-DTL connection leaves a lot to be desired. Insanely long escalators and extreme elevation changes to get between platforms? Check. Need to fish out your wallet twice to complete the transfer? Check. Failure to plan ahead while conceiving the original Newton station? Check, check and check.\n\nThe sole upside of having an unpaid link, like with the rest, is that this is one of the few places you can grab a quick toilet break if and when nature calls, without being charged twice. Then again, the TEL stations that opened later show you, this doesn’t have to be the case…\n\n30) Promenade\n\nEver wondered, as you alighted from the Circle Line here, what lay beyond the blank, stone-cold wall that greeted you on the other side? Ever imagined a possible better way to integrate the Downtown Line with the existing Circle Line platforms, without having to resort to that highly-awkward quad-stacked-side platform that is the case currently?\n\nWell, turns out that there *was*, and surprisingly it appears in the original plans for this station! Behind that cold wall you see there, actually lies a provision tunnel that was intended for the original (first) Arts Center and (later) Marina lines. Both of which would eventually in part form the present-day CBD section of the Circle and Downtown lines. Put two and two together, imagine there being active rail lines where those provision tunnels are, and voila what have you got?\n\nA stacked-island cross platform transfer.\n\nThen consider that Bayfront and Nicoll Highway stations were also planned as such, and what is the end result?\n\nA triplet stacked-island cross platform transfer system\n\nThough objectively the screw ups in transfer design for the other DTL stations and NEL are worse, Promenade falls in this category because the sorry state of things as they are today is entirely caused by the planners’ response to the Nicoll Highway collapse incident, in which not only was the ACL abandoned and scrapped for good, the excellently-designed transfers were entirely scrapped on the planners’ own accord. One could argue the DTL was “a victim of circumstance” (which I don’t buy either, but at least there’s some backing to it), where it “couldn’t be helped” but end up as a horrid mess, but what happened at Promenade… it feels like a child angrily throwing his otherwise perfect draft drawing on the floor after one mistaken stroke, and instead restarting again with compromise to quality.\n\n31) Rochor\n\nThe 13th (or 12th, depending on how you count) station on the Downtown Line is not an interchange station. Yet it is featured here as a painful reminder for us to always remember what we are doing. That is, knowing what our goals and priorities are, and actively avoiding what runs counter to it. The Downtown Line has a comparatively odd shape, intersecting itself around the Sim Lim area. Weird, but that also provides a great opportunity to enhance connectivity by intersecting itself, thereby allowing northwest-to-east commuters to change trains with ease without going through the high-demand regions in the CBD.\n\nInstead, the result passengers received as Downtown Line Stage 3 opened was quite an embarrassment to the supposed world-class planning skills at Hampshire Road. It was a “connection” like never before — nonexistent, literally. Whereas previous missed connections were compensated in part with connector infrastructure such as link malls (City Hall’s CityLink underpass system comes to mind) or at least a well-defined transfer route for passengers, there was practically nothing provided for the connection between Rochor and Jalan Besar stations which acts the role the hypothetical self-interchanging station would have played. Unsheltered, lack of signage, long walks and need to cross busy streets are all common complaints of this connection. It is hard to believe this level of planning could occur in Singapore, where infrastructure has been touted to be efficient, user-friendly and well-designed.\n\nConcluding Note\n\nWell-designed interchange stations, those that provide maximum convenience for passengers and greatest efficiency to the system overall, need lots of thought to be put into it. Entire station structures need to be conceived with developments further along the road in mind. How far ahead we can envision our rail network to look like will be how well we can build our rail-rail interchange stations to be, because once you can visualise the corridors and all, where each line roughly runs, you will be able to plan your stations accordingly to accommodate new lines that can best integrate with existing infrastructure.\n\nSo to end off this post, I pose this question to the planners and planners-to-be: What will our rail network look like in 2065?\n\nHit that subscribe button to stay updated of new content here on STC!"
