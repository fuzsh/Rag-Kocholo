        "text": "We all have our fair share of gripes and grumbles about Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) network, but there’s clearly a reason why it’s hailed as the second best public transport system in Asia. It wasn’t too long ago that we only had one to two main lines connecting limited areas of the island, but now, there’s a whole web of stations that even locals need to pause to navigate.\n\nFrom 2020 onwards, Singapore’s highly-anticipated Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) – also commonly referred to as the ‘brown line’ – began welcoming commuters in various phases. At time of writing, it’s currently in its third stage, stretching all the way from Woodlands North to Gardens by the Bay. Think that’s already a blessing? You’ll be chuffed to know that a whopping seven more TEL MRT stations are opening to the public this coming Sunday, on June 23, 2024, as part of its fourth phase of expansion.\n\nThe new TEL MRT stations opening on June 23 are:\n\nTanjong Rhu\n\nKatong Park\n\nTanjong Katong\n\nMarine Parade\n\nMarine Terrace\n\nSiglap\n\nBayshore\n\nBy then, the TEL will be more than 90 percent complete, pending its fifth and final stage. Founders’ Memorial station – situated in between Gardens by the Bay and Tanjong Rhu stations – is slated to start operations in 2025, together with Bedok South and Sungei Bedok stations located at the easternmost end of the line.\n\nThomson-East Coast Line public preview on June 21 with free MRT rides\n\nSelf-professed ‘train otakus’ who absolutely can’t wait to hop on for a ride on the new TEL can head down to check it out at the public preview happening till 9pm today. No entry fees are required – simply head down to enjoy free MRT rides across the newly-opened stations, partake in fun games and family-friendly activities. and even attempt challenges to win exclusive prizes.\n\nOther than that, visitors can look forward to a train simulator at Marine Parade MRT station, where you’ll get to experience how it’s like being a train captain, along with a showcase filled with train-themed memorabilia belonging to train enthusiasts. There will also be merchandise featuring SMRT’s Thoughtful Bunch mascots.\n\nCheck out the full Thomson-East Coast Line MRT route map below:\n\nFAQs on the Thomson-East Coast Line:\n\nWhen will Singapore’s TEL (aka brown line) be fully open?\n\nThe Thomson-East Coast Line will 100 percent open on an unspecified date in the year 2025.\n\nHow many stations are there in the TEL?\n\nThere will be a total of 32 MRT stations serviced by the Thomson-East Coast Line once it is completely open. Come June 23, there will be 29 functioning stations as part of the line.\n\nWill there be free train rides on the day of the Thomson-East Coast Line’s opening?\n\nThe free train rides on the TEL are only happening on June 21, which is the day of the public preview that all are welcome to enjoy. Bear in mind that the free rides are happening from 12pm to 9pm, along the new stations only. There will not be any free MRT journeys on June 23, the official opening date; Regular fares apply.\n\nHow long does it take to get from one end of the TEL to the other?\n\nThe duration of a train ride from Woodlands North MRT station to Gardens by the Bay MRT station takes roughly 45 minutes. We’ll update this space with new information on getting from Woodlands North to Bayshore after the official opening launch.\n\nFind out more about the Thomson-East Coast Line via Land Transport Authority’s (LTA) website.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nSingapore is the second-most expensive city in the world for expats in 2024\n\nFamed cocktail bar Dragonfly opens in Singapore with ethereal stained glass decor and live music"
