        "text": "Marina Bay MRT Station (NS27/TE20/CE2) is an underground interchange station located in the Downtown Core planning subzone, built alongside Bayfront Avenue. The station connects the North South Line (NSL), the Circle Line (CCL) extension, as well as the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL). It joined Dhoby Ghaut and Outram Park stations as a three-line interchange station within the MRT network upon the opening of TEL Stage 3 on 13 Nov 2022.\n\nServing the Marina Bay area, named after the water body it surrounds, Marina Bay station serves limited nearby developments, but will be situated in the heart of the new Central Business District currently being built around it.\n\nThe TEL station was originally targeted for completion and opening in Year 2021. However, it was delayed till 2022 as mentioned in the SMRT Operations Review 2020. TEL 3 opened for passenger service on 13 Nov 2022.\n\nCurrently the terminus of the Circle Line extension, Marina Bay will be an intermediate stop for the Circle Line once the Circle Line Stage 6 between Marina Bay and HarbourFront stations opens in 2026. In the meantime, both platforms are utilized for train turnarounds. As reflected in the Future Network Map as of March 2020, the station code will change again to NS27TE20CC33 with the opening of Circle Line Stage 6.\n\nThe Marina Bay Temporary Maintenance Facility for Downtown Line trains was also built at this station as part of the Circle Line Extension to facilitate operations of Downtown Line Stage 1. Works to remove the disused tracks leading to the maintenance facility from the Circle Line took place in 2021. The area was converted to an unpaid link between Exit 5 at the TEL Paid Link, the NSL & CCL ticket concourses, as well as Exit 2, which opened on 1 November 2023.\n\nFirst / Last Train Timings\n\nNorth South Line – (NS27) Marina Bay\n\nDestination First Train Last Train Weekdays & Sat Sun & Public Holidays Daily NS28 Marina South Pier 6:05am 6:32am 11:58pm NS1 Jurong East 6:01am 6:26am 11:50pm NS7 Kranji – – 12:06am Circle Line – (CE2) Marina Bay\n\nDestination First Train Last Train Weekdays & Sat Sun & Public Holidays Daily CC6 Stadium 5:59am 6:24am 11:55pm Thomson-East Coast Line – (TE20) Marina Bay\n\nDestination First Train Last Train Weekdays & Sat Sun & Public Holidays Daily TE1 Woodlands North 6:02am 6:22am 12:02am TE9 Caldecott – – 12:14am TE14 Orchard – – 12:20am TE29 Bayshore 6:01am 6:21am 12:14am TE27 Marine Terrace – – 12:19am TE22 Gardens by the Bay – – 12:25am\n\nStation Layout\n\nL1 Street Level Bus stops, Taxi stand, Pick-up/drop-off point B1 NSL Concourse Faregates, Ticketing Service Kiosks, Passenger Service Centre (NSL) CCL-NSL Transfer Link Paid Transfer between NSL & CCL, Passenger Service Centre (CCL), Faregates CCL Platform C Circle Line towards CC6 Stadium (Off-Peak Hours)\n\nCircle Line towards CC29NE1 HarbourFront (Peak Hours) CCL Platform D Circle Line towards CC6 Stadium (Off-Peak Hours)\n\nCircle Line towards CC29NE1 HarbourFront (Peak Hours) Linkway Unpaid Link to Exits 2 & 5, Faregates to CCL / NSL Ticket Concourses\n\n(Former Marina Bay Temporary Maintenance Facility) TEL Concourse Faregates, Ticketing Service Kiosks, Passenger Service Centre (TEL), Retail Shops TEL-NSL Transfer Link Paid Transfer between TEL & NSL, Faregates to Exit 5 B2 NSL Platform A North South Line towards NS1EW24 Jurong East NSL Platform B North South Line towards NS28 Marina South Pier CCL Concourse Transfer Hall; Faregates to CCL-TEL Unpaid Link TEL-CCL Transfer Link Paid Transfer between TEL & CCL TEL-CCL Transfer Link Unpaid Transfer between TEL Concourse & CCL Concourse B3 TEL-NSL & CCL Link Paid Transfer between TEL & CCL / NSL B4 TEL Platform E Thomson-East Coast Line towards TE29 Bayshore B5 TEL Platform F Thomson-East Coast Line towards TE1 Woodlands North\n\nPlatforms\n\nMarina Bay Station currently has six platforms, with NSL, CCL and TEL each occupying two platforms.\n\nCircle Line (B1):\n\nUnpaid Link\n\n< to Exit 5 | ^ Lift & Escalator to CCL Concourse (B2) ^ | Faregates to NSL Ticket Concourse >\n\nFormer Marina Bay Temporary Maintenance Facility [Restricted Area] Platform C:\n\nCircle Line towards CC6 Stadium via CE1DT16 Bayfront (→)\n\nCircle Line towards CC29NE1 Harbourfront via CE1DT16 Bayfront (Peak Hours) (→)\n\nPlatform D:\n\nCircle Line towards CC6 Stadium via CE1DT16 Bayfront (→)\n\nCircle Line towards CC29NE1 Harbourfront via CE1DT16 Bayfront (Peak Hours) (→)\n\nThe Circle Line platform uses a conventional island platform layout. CCL platforms were renumbered from A & B to C & D respectively upon the opening of the TEL on 13 Nov 2022.\n\nAs part of the Circle Line Extension, train services on the Circle Line will operate as a shuttle between Marina Bay and Stadium stations throughout most of the day. However, during the weekday peak hours (07:00 – 09:17 & 16:51 – 21:12), train services from Marina Bay will serve the full line, operating between Marina Bay and HarbourFront stations via Bishan. Both platforms are utilized alternately by terminating trains.\n\nWith the platforms at Basement 1 accessible only via the Ticket Concourse / Transfer Hall at Basement 2, Marina Bay CCL station is the first underground MRT station to have its platform level above the concourse level.\n\nJust beside the Circle Line station is the former Marina Bay Temporary Maintenance Facility (MBTMF). As Downtown Line Stage 1 (22 Dec 2013 to 26 Dec 2015) was disconnected from the main depot at Gali Batu, the Temporary Maintenance Facility was used to provide for low-level maintenance work for the Bombardier MOVIA C951 rolling stock prior to the opening of Downtown Line Stage 2. In the meantime, trains used the Circle Line’s Kim Chuan Depot for the launching of trains and major maintenance works.\n\nMBTMF was built as part of the Circle Line Extension. Concealed from view behind a concrete partition wall, the facility can be seen from the scissors crossing just north of the station, with a single access track joining the northbound track. The tracks were removed in May 2021. The facility was converted to an unpaid link and was opened on 1 November 2023.\n\nNorth South Line (B2):\n\nPlatform A: North South Line towards NS1EW24 Jurong East via NS26EW14 Raffles Place (→)\n\nPlatform B: North South Line towards NS28 Marina South Pier (←)\n\nThe North South Line platforms are arranged in a conventional island platform layout.\n\nPrior to regular southbound trains being scheduled to turnaround at Marina South Pier, platforms at Marina Bay were used both for train turnarounds and trains heading to/from Marina South Pier. Using a set of points north of the station, terminating trains arriving from Raffles Place arrive at either Platform A or B to before heading back towards Raffles Place and Jurong East. At the same time, passing-through-trains call at Platform B towards Marina South Pier, and at Platform A towards Jurong East.\n\nThomson-East Coast Line (B4):\n\nPlatform E: Thomson-East Coast Line towards TE29 Bayshore via TE21 Marina South & TE22 Gardens by the Bay (→)\n\nThomson-East Coast Line (B5):\n\nPlatform F: Thomson-East Coast Line towards TE1 Woodlands North via TE19 Shenton Way (←)\n\nThe TEL platforms are arranged in a stacked side configuration. Heading south from Marina Bay station, trains pass through the unopened Marina South station.\n\nConcourse\n\nNSL & TEL ticket concourses are located at Basement 1, while the CCL ticket concourse is located at Basement 2.They feature faregates for automatic fare collection and provides access between paid and unpaid areas of the station, with at least one bidirectional wide-swinging gate for the benefit of passengers-in-wheelchairs and those carrying bulky items or travelling with prams.\n\nTicketing Service Kiosks at the ticket concourse offer contactless card transactions. The station offices at each concourse function as a Passenger Service Centre, and is staffed during operating hours.\n\nAlthough the Circle Line ticket concourse is at Basement 2, the Circle Line Passenger Service Centre is at Basement 1, next to Exit 2 faregates.\n\nPaid Links\n\nNSL – CCL Paid Link\n\nThe former Exit A was reconstructed to allow for a paid link between the NSL and CCL at Basement 1. Near the CCL concourse, the transfer linkway emerges at an atrium where a set of five escalators (3 in paid areas and 2 outside of paid areas) descend to the B2 Transfer Hall, where passengers can ascend to the CCL platforms. Additional faregates at the transfer hall leads to the unpaid link to the TEL Concourse. The CCL – TEL paid link is also located at this level.\n\nTEL – NSL / CCL Paid Link\n\nA transfer level at B3 of the TEL Station connects it with both the NSL & CCL. The NSL-TEL paid link also branches off to Exit 5 with a dedicated remote faregate line and lift lobby at both B1 and B2 level away from the main TEL ticket concourse.\n\nUnpaid Link\n\nThe former Marina Bay Temporary Maintenance Facility was converted to an unpaid link from 1 November 2023 providing access to Exit 5, CCL Concourse via lifts / escalators at B2 level, as well as faregates to the paid link between CCL & NSL.\n\nCCL Art in Transit: “Train Rides on Rainy Days” by Nah Yong En\n\n“Train Rides on Rainy Days” comprises of two sets of photographs, ‘greenery’ and ‘blue evening’ taken from the inside of MRT trains on the East-West and North-South Lines during rainy days. The photographic works are of places that we might probably have become so familiar with that we no longer consciously notice.\n\nTEL Art in Transit: “Walking into the Interstitial” by Tang Ling Nah\n\nTaking the form of trompe l’œil murals, the artwork brings its viewers’ attention to everyday spaces easily missed by commuters on the go. It also bridges the old Central Business District (CBD) and the new financial centre in Marina Bay, where this station is located.\n\nThe artist referenced the stairways, doors, windows and interstitial spaces, such as alleys and corridors, in areas like Cecil Street, Raffles Place and Shenton Way in the old CBD, to create original charcoal drawings which were then transferred onto prints on vitreous enamel panels. She has thus transposed parts of the old CBD into the new financial centre, creating uncanny moments of unfamiliar familiarity and invoking viewers in their memories of an ever-changing city.\n\nCivil Defence shelter\n\nMarina Bay NSL station is one of six stations along the North South Line designated as Civil Defence (CD) shelters, which will be activated in times of national emergency. Apart from reinforced construction, the stations are designed and equipped with facilities to ensure the shelter environment is tolerable for all shelterees during shelter occupation.

Demand is expected to increase in the future when the new Central Business District develops in the surrounding area.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2014, Marina Bay Station was the southern terminus of the North South Line. When Marina South Pier station opened in 2014, it was no longer the line terminus, but a majority of NSL trains terminated there likely owing to low passenger traffic at Marina South Pier. This arrangement was lifted following the implementation of the new CBTC Signalling System in 2017.\n\nConstruction\n\nMarina Bay NSL station and tunnels were built as part of NSL Contract 310.\n\nCircle Line Contract 901 for the construction and completion of Marina Bay CCL station was awarded to local company Hock Lian Seng Infrastructure Pte. Ltd. for S$348.4 million in Feb 2008. The scope also includes addition and alteration works to the existing North South Line (NSL) Marina Bay station, localised diversions of the East Coast Parkway and Marina Street as well as demolition of an expunged vehicular underpass.\n\nThe Circle Line station was designed by Aedas Architecture. As an integral part of Singapore’s Marina Bay development and an interchange station for two major metro lines, Marina Bay Station is located in a public park. The design aims to integrate the station into the park landscape through landscaping. The translucent ETFE canopy acts as a skylight to allow natural light penetrating deep into the underground hall. To further minimise the visual impact of the station to the surrounding park landscape, only the lift, entrance glazed enclosure, lightweight canopy and reflective pool are visible on street level, giving users full view of the park from the station entrance.\n\nContract T226 for the construction of Marina Bay station and its associated tunnels was awarded to Taisei Corporation at a contract sum of S$425 million.\n\nFuture Developments\n\nCircle Line Stage 6 between HarbourFront and Marina Bay stations is scheduled for completion in 2026. A pedestrian mall network will link the station with adjacent buildings in the future.\n\nGallery\n\nAdditional Photos at Page 2.\n\nExternal Links & References"
