        "text": "About\n\nThe Marina Bay Street Circuit hosted Formula 1’s first night race in 2008 and has been a staple of the calendar ever since.\n\nThe 23-turn Marina Bay Street Circuit, originally designed by Hermann Tilke before being modified by KBR. Inc., winds its way around some of Singapore’s landmarks, such as the Anderson Bridge, the Fullerton Hotel, and the striking Singapore Flyer, which opened in the same year as the inaugural Singapore race. The track has undergone minor changes over the past ten years, including the re-profiling of the ‘Singapore Sling’ – a once challenging corner which caught plenty of drivers out. The race is one of the most testing of the year due to the extreme heat and the challenging street circuit track layout. Every running of the Singapore Grand Prix so far has featured at least one Safety Car period.\n\nFirst held in 2008, the event was the inaugural F1 night race, which continues to make for a breathtaking spectacle under the Singapore skyline. The 2008 race here wasn’t without controversy. Fernando Alonso won the race, helped by his team-mate Nelson Piquet Jnr crashing into a wall. ‘Crashgate’ became one of the sport’s biggest scandals when Piquet later revealed that he had been instructed to crash on purpose.\n\nThe circuit, which is made up of public roads, is only in operation for the Formula 1 weekend, with the Porsche Carrera Cup and Ferrari Challenge also running as support races. Another highlight of the F1 weekend is the high-profile concerts held over the course of the event. Singapore will remain on the F1 calendar until at least 2021.\n\nThe Singapore Grand Prix was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and 2021. The race will return in 2022, but a new contract will need to be signed to secure the event’s long-term future.\n\nLearn more: Singapore Grand Prix in Numbers\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nUpcoming events at Marina Bay Street Circuit\n\nMarina Bay is a temporary street circuit that’s only used once a year.\n\nThe Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix 2023 is scheduled for September 15-17. (Buy tickets here)\n\nHow to get there\n\nThe Marina Bay Street Circuit is a temporary race track in the Downtown Core and Kallang areas of Singapore’s city center.\n\nChangi Airport (SIN), the fifth busiest international airport in the world, is the most convenient airport for your trip to the Singapore Grand Prix.\n\nHow to get to the circuit:\n\nWalk: If you’re staying in downtown Singapore, you’ll more than likely be able to walk to the circuit.\n\nPublic Transport: Given the heat and humidity, you may wish to make use of Singapore’s efficient MRT (Mass Rapid Transport) for the weekend, even if only for a few stops. It’s a good idea to purchase a Singapore Tourist Pass which provides you with unlimited travel on public transport for one day ($22 SGD), two days ($29 SGD) or three days ($34 SGD).\n\nTaxi: Taxis are reliable and affordable in Singapore. Short trips in the city centre should cost no more than $10-20 SGD – but be aware of surcharges of a hefty 50% between midnight-6am.\n\nCar: A car shouldn’t be necessary for the Grand Prix weekend, but you may benefit from car hire if you are staying in the area for an extended break.\n\nMore information about getting to the Marina Bay Street Circuit can be found on F1Destinations: Getting There & Around – Singapore Grand Prix.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nWith the Singapore Grand Prix taking place in the city center, hotels in the area sell out fast and are often expensive. Nevertheless, there is a wide range of affordable and extravagant options within the city.\n\nClick here to browse all accommodation for the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix.\n\nThe best hotels in the area are located around the Marina Bay circuit. If you get lucky, you won’t even need to buy a ticket for the race, with some hotels overlooking the on-track action! Hotels do sell out early, though – with the famous Fullerton Hotel regularly selling out almost a year in advance of the next season’s race. Other hotels next to the track include the Swissotel The Stamford (near turn 9) and the Pan Pacific Hotel (near turn 6).\n\nLooking for something extra special? The Marina Bay Sands Hotel with its rooftop infinity pool, often seen on the TV coverage, will set you back around $825 SGD per night, while the Ritz-Carlton Millennia, located near the pit-lane, is $1825 SGD per night.\n\nMore affordable options in the area include the Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay and the 4-star Dorsett Singapore. All are located just a short walk from public transport stations. Be aware that some hotels, especially budget options, will have windowless rooms.\n\nMore information about where to stay for the Singapore Grand Prix can be found on F1Destinations: Accommodation – Singapore Grand Prix\n\nGoogle Map\n\nCircuit Map\n\nImages\n\nVideos"
