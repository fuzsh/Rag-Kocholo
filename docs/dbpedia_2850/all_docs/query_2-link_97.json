The Wi-Fi router could be too far away from your devices or due to physical interferences like thick walls, floors, or other appliances; or too many devices connecting to a network simultaneously. You may wish to move to another location where the network signal is stronger.\n\nWhy is the maps performance so slow?\n\nThe accuracy and strength of GPS can be affected by walls, buildings and large trees. Crowded areas and poor network connection can also result in a weak GPS signal, hence affecting the maps calculation and navigation performance.\n\nLYON CHAT\n\nI cannot find the content I am looking for in Lyon Chat, what should I do?\n\nPlease arrow down the search terms.
