        "text": "On 10 January 2024, Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat announced that the fourth stage of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) will open in the first half of 2024.\n\nThe stage 4 opening of the Thomson-East Coast Line will comprise seven MRT stations:\n\nTanjong Rhu MRT station\n\nKatong Park MRT station\n\nTanjong Katong MRT station\n\nMarine Parade MRT station\n\nMarine Terrace MRT station\n\nSiglap MRT station\n\nBayshore MRT station\n\nHow will the TEL make your MRT commute to work, school, and town even more convenient? Read on to find out everything you need to know about the upcoming TEL!\n\nThomson-East Coast Line: Overview\n\nBefore the TEL came about, the Thomson Line (TSL) and Eastern Region Line (ERL) were planned as two separate MRT lines. The TSL would run between Woodlands and Marina Bay MRT stations, while the ERL would loop around Jalan Besar and Expo MRT stations. However, the LTA saw that merging the two lines would be worth more than the sum of their parts. Therefore, on 15 August 2014, the TEL was born.\n\nThe stage 1 opening of the Thomson-East Coast Line commenced on 31 January 2020. Three out of 32 stations were open to the public: Woodlands North, Woodlands, and Woodlands South MRT stations.\n\nWhen the TEL is fully complete, it will cover a distance of 43km and consist of 32 stations.\n\nThomson-East Coast Line Map\n\nOnce the entire line has been constructed, it will link the north side and east side of Singapore via the central region. Its two ends will be Woodlands North and Sungei Bedok MRT stations; along the line will include Upper Thomson, Stevens, Orchard, Shenton Way, Marina Bay, Tanjong Rhu, Marine Parade, and Sungei Bedok MRT stations.\n\nFor people residing in the North, the TEL already offers a quicker way to go to Orchard Road or the Central Business District (CBD). The Thomson-East Coast Line opening stage 4 will mean even more public transport access for people living across Singapore.\n\nThomson-East Coast Line Opening Stages and Timelines\n\nThere will be a total of five Thomson-East Coast Line opening stages from 2020 to 2025.\n\nIt’s a long list, but that’s not the end of it yet. Under the Land Transport Master Plan 2040, the TEL will see an extension sometime in 2040. This will extend from Sungei Bedok MRT station to the upcoming Changi Airport Terminal 5, as well as Changi Airport itself.\n\nThis extension will allow those living in the South to gain easy access to Changi Airport. It will also link Changi Airport directly to sightseeing spots such as Marina Bay and Gardens By the Bay, which could mean improved convenience for tourists. For Singaporeans, it would mean that those living in places such as Marine Parade can finally travel overseas without calling a taxi.\n\nShould I Stay Along the TEL?\n\nOne housing estate along the TEL is Marine Parade, which is well-developed with plenty of amenities and eateries. It is also within proximity to East Coast Park and Marina Bay. It has always been a hot spot for higher-income citizens but lacks good MRT accessibility. With the Thomson-East Coast Line opening stage 4 confirmed for 2024, developments such as Coastline Residences and Seaside Residences may become more attractive to property seekers very soon.\n\nTanglin is another popular spot for those looking for a more upscale area. Situated at the heart of Singapore, Tanglin is near areas such as Orchard, Newton, and other central parts of Singapore. Since the opening of Napier MRT station, Tanglin has enjoyed even more connectivity to other places in Singapore. This may have increased the popularity of properties such as 120 Grange.\n\nRecently, on 17 October 2023, HDB announced two Bayshore BTO projects that will launch in H2 2024.\n\nOn how potential homebuyers may perceive Bayshore as an area to live in, Dr Lee Nai Jia, Head of Real Estate Intelligence, Data and Software Solutions, PropertyGuru Group said, “Ten years later, when these Plus flats fulfil their Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) and developers start launching private properties in the area, HDB upgraders might start looking to buy these homes.\n\n“By that time, Bayshore and the surrounding neighbourhoods would have been largely revitalised. This could be attractive for young families seeking convenience to transport links, lifestyle amenities, and green spaces.”\n\nInterested in staying near the TEL?
