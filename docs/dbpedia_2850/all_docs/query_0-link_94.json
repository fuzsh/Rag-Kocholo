        "text": "The Department of Transportation (DOTr) anticipates receiving approval from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a $1 billion loan within the year to fund a new mass transit project extending from San Juan City to Taytay in Rizal province.\n\nTimothy John Batan, Undersecretary for Planning and Project Development at DOTr, said “We aim to secure board approval from the ADB by year-end. Currently, we need to seek reapproval from the NEDA Board for increased costs and a revised scope.”\n\nOriginally proposed as a monorail, the project has been updated to a conventional heavy metro rail system in response to expected high ridership.\n\nThe Metro Rail Transit Line 4 (MRT4) will be a fully elevated rail system covering 15.56 kilometers with 11 stations and two additional provisional stations. The design includes barrier-free access to enhance inclusivity.\n\nThe project aims to ease traffic congestion along Ortigas Avenue and improve connectivity in densely populated areas of eastern Metro Manila and Rizal.\n\nAccording to the ADB, the MRT4 will cut travel times from Taytay to Ortigas CBD from up to three hours by road to less than 30 minutes by rail. The new line is expected to bolster economic growth and support urban development in the region.\n\nThe MRT4, with an estimated cost of P59.3 billion, will feature trains operating at speeds up to 80 kilometers per hour and a commercial speed between 25 and 40 kilometers per hour. The line will run through Mandaluyong, San Juan, Quezon, Pasig, and the municipalities of Cainta and Taytay.\n\nIt is projected to accommodate 4,464 passengers during peak hours and 2,678 passengers during off-peak times. The estimated travel time from N. Domingo in San Juan to Taytay is 27 minutes, with daily ridership expected to reach 328,804 by 2030."
