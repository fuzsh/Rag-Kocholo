        "text": "The Circle Line is a line with many problems. In fact, if you ask me, it may even eclipse the Downtown Line as the “sick child” of the MRT.\n\nWhen it first opened, many doomsayers were saying that the line wouldn’t be able to cope with its expected capacity. Being designed before the population boom of the late 2000s, it quickly became clear that there wasn’t enough capacity, especially when viral images of Bishan station literally being flooded with passengers showed up on the internet. (maybe the Population White Paper was justified after all?)\n\nMost obvious is that they didn’t buy enough trains at first to run a high intensity service, but that’s not just the issue here. Let’s start by asking ourselves what the CCL will look like in 2040.\n\nWinter is coming\n\nRecall the principle of circles — to facilitate movement between radials. Consequently, what you would want out of a circle is high frequency, and the expectation that nobody in their right mind (unless, of course, you’re talking about train otaku) would go around more than half a circle, which in our terms would be half an hour. This principle also means that at major stations you expect high circulation of passengers in and out of trains.\n\nWhile in journey planning you can probably forget about the Circle and switch lines elsewhere, but if everyone thought that way, the government would be forced to spend billions on improving capacity of downtown interchange stations and adding new lines to said interchange stations — worse still, we’re basically out of roads to put train lines under in the CBD, so you’d need to do Crossrail-style burrowing to put stations under buildings and such. Most notably, a story goes that when Joseph Stalin was approached about crowding at Moscow Metro interchanges, he put a coffee cup on the map, making a stain in the shape of a circle, and told the planners to build that.\n\nOr so that was the initial principle behind the design of the CCL (and still stands when talking about the CRL), although in recent years I daresay things have changed quite significantly. The URA’s draft masterplan shows an intent of developing quite a few CCL stations (both interchange and regular stations) as destinations in their own right — glacial pace of urban development aside, the past decade alone has seen quite a lot of change around the line’s catchment areas. This doesn’t make the need for frequency any more important, though — on the contrary, demand from points along the line itself would actually increase, so you’d have to increase frequency to make up for that.\n\nGiven the LTA’s habit of being caught with their pants down (bicycle-sharing bust, anyone?) I’d actually say that it would do them better to start with worst-case assumptions when planning, especially since there’s that new line study going on.\n\nLoop the loop\n\nWith CCL6, there will be a set of turnback tracks constructed past Prince Edward. Given both that and some information that was sent out by SMRT a while back, the following is a likely service pattern post-CCL6 in 2025:\n\ninner loop service, going around the circle\n\nouter loop service, going around the circle\n\n“short trips” from Dhoby Ghaut to Prince Edward\n\nThe “short trips” are worth taking note. Brief observation would tell you that demand on the upper side of the circle (Paya Lebar to Buona Vista, through Bishan) is a lot higher than the lower half. Consequently, in that short few months in end-2011 before the Marina Bay branch opened, SMRT ran services from Paya Lebar (using the now-unused middle platform) to one-north, reversing in the siding between there and Kent Ridge. Where there are events at the Sports Hub, they can also extend Marina Bay branch trains to Caldecott.\n\nBad Execution aside, this lets them bring back a service similar to the one-north terminators of the old days. These turnback tracks will allow for the short trips to be “overlaid” on the Yamanote/Koltsevaya style true loop service, and this provide the required additional trips on the north half of the circle — which, as the Russians will tell you, can be a recipe for disaster when put together with high frequency. The Russians don’t branch, and for good reason, which we will see later.\n\nParadoxically, such a service pattern as is likely what the Circle Line would run, would actually result in a reduction of service where it would be needed the most. Assume they manage to run a 100 second headway on most of the line, with 50% of trains being loop services while the other 50% go to Dhoby Ghaut and Prince Edward.\n\nThis results that at Marina Bay and Bayfront, crucial interchanges with the Downtown and Thomson lines, you get a 3–4 minute frequency in peak hour. Yes, peak hour. Additional time will also need to be allocated at Prince Edward and Promenade to allow for those on the wrong service to alight and wait for the correct train — or they could just wait at their originating station, but that adds to crowding, especially at a place like Bishan already packed to the rafters.\n\nThrow the baby out with the bath water\n\nWe have to face things — what’s built is built. With the Thomson Line, LTA has realized the benefits of more doors to facilitate faster boarding and alighting. This pushes down dwell times. However, as detailed in The Changi Problem, there are a considerable amount of Circle Line stations that have structural supports in the way of five-door train cars. Hence, short of an expensive undertaking to rebuild the many CCL stations with such features, you can’t run five-door cars on the Circle Line.\n\nThe best you could do would be to make the train doors themselves wider to achieve a similar effect — but then you’d likely need to buy new trains. It may be possible, when the C830 is due for its mid-life refurbishment, to attempt to widen the doors on the trains, but there’s only so much you can do before you start being constrained by the platform doors — although at the same time you may need to look at modifying platform doors as well, given the age of the equipment.\n\nIt’s also because of such travel patterns that I feel four-car trains may be of limited use on the CCL, compared to the DTL. This is simply because the DTL acts as a radial trunk line to bring passengers into the CBD, while the CCL gets them around the place.\n\nThere is also the matter of power usage. Just as a household electricity supply can trip when you turn on too many appliances at the same time, the railway’s power system must also be able to cope with the electrical demand posed by running more trains along the line. Fortunately, this may come earlier than expected, given that in the interest of saving land and money during construction, the CCL power system is tied into the NSEWL one which is being upgraded as part of Contract R153.\n\nAll these are investments you will have to make anyway, which SMRT learned the hard way back in 2011, so it would also be a good time to consider how you can further improve line capacity.\n\nWhere do you want to go?\n\nMaking things worse on the CCL is its branching operation at Promenade, where trains can either take the turn to Esplanade or continue on to Bayfront. As such, time is needed to configure the junction routing to allow a train at Promenade to proceed straight to Bayfront or into the sharp curve to Esplanade. Furthermore, should the route not be set in favour, the back train is required to enter the platform area at a speed where it can brake in time to avoid the junction, even if the previous train is already clear of the junction area. This basically acts as a fixed block where the benefit of CBTC no longer applies. The longer time needed to clear the junction area because of the curve will thus affect headway through the platform.\n\nAt Prince Edward Road, things may be the same, or worse, seeing as the track from the upper platform to the turnback is on an incline, and the train will need to slow down to avoid accidents. You can’t avoid that without dealing with such moves are needed— to turn trains from the branch, which still goes back to why the Promenade junction has to be used in the first place.\n\nIn the other direction where two tracks merge into one, things are even worse given that trains have to arrive at the junction in the prescribed order, at the prescribed time as in the timetable (believe me or not, it does exist). Since loop trains already do not have the ability to hold somewhere to make up for delays, if they miss their “slot” to enter the common area, it risks building up delays along the rest of the line, since if the train for the desired branch is delayed and has to let something else go in front of it, when it does show up there will be more passengers than expected, and the train has to stay in the platform longer so as much people as possible can get aboard… and you get it. Since the CCL is an automated railway it’s much easier to amend the service accordingly, but it’s still better for the control room not to have to resort to that.\n\nSlow zones also limit the maximum speed a train can pass the area in, with the Promenade junction possibly being below par even for LTA’s own standards (given visual comparison to similar turnouts along the DTL which lead to cripple sidings). This is the easiest to deal with, since better-performing trains will not encounter that steep of a speed penalty when entering and leaving slow zones as they can simply accelerate and brake faster.\n\nWhile the timetable may state 100 seconds, practical headway may be even lower than 100 seconds due to passenger or train disruption that can happen anywhere. When this happens, the next train is likely to already be just outside the platform and have to creep in — an effect which cascades down at tight timetabled headways. Most notably, extreme risk aversion on the part of LTA and SMRT means that you realistically wouldn’t be able to run such a schedule for long either.\n\nFor want of a crayon\n\nThe old German saying goes, “organization before electronics before concrete”. I wouldn’t say what I’m going to say, if I didn’t think organization wasn’t a effective solution and the electronics only let you do so much.\n\nThe first way to fix the Circle, would be to find a way to split off the branch to Dhoby Ghaut. This would most likely involve the construction of new platforms somewhere in the tight confines of Promenade Station — however, there is one spare (the other is now the DTL concourse), and some land to the east of the station. Modifications to the existing tunnels may also be required, either to redirect the main loop platforms to new ones and let the branch take over the existing ones, or to redirect the branch to whatever new platform is built.\n\nHowever, this is where caution must be taken — you can’t be too adventurous given the LTA design standards and the fact that existing tunnels create a “wall” around the area, preventing tracks from Esplanade from continuing east without complicated gymnastics. Some quarters think that you could route an eastward extension through the “wall”, but it would require awkward turns north or south, and with the latter option you have to give up an interchange at Promenade station (although if people complain, let them walk through Marina Square)\n\nThe second, would be to connect Paya Lebar’s middle platform to the tracks coming from Dakota. This would allow depot-bound trains to have a dedicated platform where they can be checked for passengers before the trains head back to the depot, without holding up other trains behind. Beijing Line 10 (Bagou and Songjiazhuang) and the Yamanote Line (Osaki and Ikebukuro) both have this, but we can’t put in plans to add a platform more (or even 2) at Tai Seng and Bartley, so Paya Lebar will have to do.\n\nSo why bother?\n\nLooking at things from a glass-half-empty perspective, you start to draw up “do nothing’ scenarios. So what happens if you “do nothing”? CRL may be able to relieve some of the interchanging load on the west side of the Circle, but not everyone who uses the Circle can benefit from using CRL instead. The new line to the north will also have its own passengers to distribute, so there’s limited benefit if you force transfers to existing lines and then use it as a reliever for the Circle, even if that only happens in downtown—which became a controversy when the NEL opened in 2003.\n\nWhile doing something may be expensive, doing nothing has its costs as well. It may not have a tangible price tag to it, but such are the troubles of public transit planning. A lesson LTA has learnt for future lines is that it may prove more prudent to design for excess capacity in future, since you have the choice of not using it.\n\nAlas, it’s a hard lesson, and we’re paying the bill. For the Circle, is it too late yet?\n\nedit: added some images, hope they help\n\nanother edit: checked some information"
