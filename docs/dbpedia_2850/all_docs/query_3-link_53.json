        "text": "Motorists travelling in and out of Singapore’s Central Business District, brace yourselves — change is coming, once again.\n\nThe Land Transport Authority announced on Monday key changes to the road network in the Marina South Area, particularly to the Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE), which opened to much confusion near the end of last year.\n\nThe key changes that will take effect starting Sunday, 28 September at 5am are:\n\nThe removal of the Prince Edward Road exit from the MCE, and its replacement with links in and out of Maxwell Road — and yes, the ERP gantry will be ported over from Prince Edward Road.\n\nThe removal of the slip road between Maxwell Road and Central Boulevard. Its ERP gantry, naturally, will be gone too.\n\nCentral Boulevard and Marina Boulevard, currently having four lanes moving toward one direction and the last lane in the other, will be converted to single-direction roads, with all five lanes headed toward Shenton Way and the MCE respectively.\n\nThe opening of a straight section along Central Boulevard, so you won’t have to detour through Marina Station Road, which will then be closed.\n\nThe lengthening of Bayfront Avenue to loop at Marina Bay station.\n\nThese changes will affect several bus routes as well, and if you take services 97, 106, 133, 400, 402, 502 and 513 through the CBD, you may wish to check out the changes closely to see if the bus stop you frequent will be removed or shifted. (See GIFs of the forward and return trips for the affected buses here and here.)\n\nTo make it easier to understand, here is a slideshow that shows the new routes in GIF form.\n\nIn its bid to improve your preparedness, the LTA will distribute brochures and circulars to offices and residential buildings in the area, and it will also hold four lunchtime exhibitions: two at the Marina Bay Financial Centre on the 24th and 26th, one at the Ministry of National Development building on the 22nd, and one more at the Urban Redevelopment Authority on the 25th.\n\nThey’ve also developed eight drivers’ point-of-view video clips simulating the experience of plying the new road network, complete with the new signs you will see, which we helpfully bring to you here:\n\nHere’s what you'll see when driving from the AYE to Rochor and Marina South:\n\nHere's the driving experience from the ECP to Rochor and Marina South, via the MCE:\n\nHere's what you can expect driving from the ECP and Rochor to the Marina South and MCE:\n\nAnd here's what your journey would look like from the Marina South area to the ECP and MCE:\n\nHere's what it's like exiting the MCE to Maxwell Road instead of to Prince Edward Road:\n\nYou can see several other routes tracked in videos on the LTA's YouTube channel, here.\n\nHow does it look to you? Let us know your thoughts about these changes in the comments!"
