        "text": "It’s been a long wait, but finally, the Thomson East Coast Line will finally be opening Stage 3 on November 13 with newly-launched MRT stations spanning from Stevens to Gardens by the Bay. With this new MRT line, it’s never been easier to travel from Woodlands to Orchard – you’ll reach in a mere matters of 35 minutes.\n\nIn any case, head down on November 11 to trial this new MRT line for yourself – entirely for free. This will be running from 10am to 9pm, and you can easily slot in travels from Bukit Timah Road with stations like Stevens all the way to the CBD area with Maxwell, Shenton Way, and Marina Bay MRT Stations.\n\nFor those wondering how this affects their public transport commute, the new Thomson-East Coast Line stations are: Stevens, Napier, Orchard Boulevard, Orchard, Great World, Havelock, Outram Park, Maxwell, Shenton Way, Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay. There are still two stages due to open, and all should be completed by 2025. Stage 4 (around 2024) will be covering eight stations from Bayshore all the way to Bay East, while Stage 5 (around 2025) will be from Bedok South to Sungei Bedok.\n\nFind out more information on LTA’s website."
