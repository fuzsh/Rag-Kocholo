        "text": "Singapore is the world’s only city-state. With a population of 6 million, Singapore gained independence from Britain in 1963. The country is a global commerce, finance and transport hub. It is small, about 2/3 the size of New York City, measuring 50 km from east to west and 27 km from north to south, with nearly 200 km of coastline. Singapore has an active greening policy, which has covered the island with tropical plants, parks, and parks. Singapore is one of our favorite cities to run in Asia. If you’d like to have an in-person guided running experience in Singapore, we highly recommend our friends at Go! Running Tours.\n\nDespite its density and many high-rises, Singapore is a pleasure for running. There are lots of lovely paths and parks, and a very active running scene. Highlights include some spectacular waterfront running around the marina, the extensive East and West coast linear parks along the water, Gardens by the Bay, and the Macritchie Reservoir loop. Another running note: many of Singapore’s running spots are well lit at night. We’ll try to point those out. This is helpful, as there are not late sunsets due to Singapore’s location close to the equator. Singapore has an excellent public transportation system. You don’t generally need a car to access great running — in fact, Singapore is known for its expensive congestion pricing. The best way to get around is the extensive MRT system, which is a combination of trains, subways, and light rail. Here’s a link to the MRT MAP\n\nIn the Punggol area in the northeastern part of Singapore, there's some very scenic running on waterfront paths, around Serangoon (Coney) Island, and Waterway Park. A few different distance options.\n\nSpectacular run around Marina Bay’s fascinating architecture and major sites. Short run 3.4 miles, long run 7.2 miles\n\nGreat run from downtown core to stadium along dedicated waterfront path.\n\nOne of the most popular runs in Singapore. A paved multi-use path runs along the Singapore Strait from Marine Parade/Katong east toward the airport. Nice foliage, water views, and a festive scene. Up to 11.7 k one-way.\n\nSome of the best running options near an airport of any city we know. Run the 'Jurassic Mile' to East Coast Park; a path to Changi Beach; or the many km of paths around Pasir Ris Park & Tampines.\n\nGardens by the Bay is one of Singapore’s major sites and also great for running. Combine with Fort Canning Park for a hill and a great 5.8 mile tour, and even more with Marina Bay. The Helix Bridge is a highlight, as are numerous other pedestrian bridges.\n\nWonderful 6.5 mile loop around reservoir and nature trails. A great getaway only 10k from downtown.\n\nA great run in western part of Singapore. 5k loop along the water.\n\n4.3 km loop around a Reservoir, which was originally a sand quarry. Popular spot in the eastern part of Singapore, near the airport. Add on with up to 3.4 km in adjacent Bedok Park\n\nGreat trail right from downtown, along river 3.8 miles to Queenstown Stadium.\n\nA verdant, scenic and unique run! Paths connect four adjacent parks, passing through and above a lush tree canopy, with great views of the city below. Includes two 'treetop walks' and impressive pedestrian bridges.\n\nPleasant 5 km path along the Pandan River, from Buona Vista MRT station to Clementi Ave. Can add with Rail Corridor Trail, which heads north to Clementi Forest & Bukit Timah.\n\nThis 163-ha preserve 12 km from the city is a great trail running option. Lush vegetation, facilities, and trails of varying distances & difficulty, including the 163m Bukit Timah Hill.\n\nA 16 km+ multi-use path in the western part of Singapore that can be run standalone or as add-on/connector to our Bukit Timah, Pandan River Trail, & Clementi Forest routes.\n\nA scenic run in Woodlands - a planned residential community in the northern part of Singapore. Includes Woodlands Waterfront Park along the Johor Straits, and lush green trails through Marsiling Park and Admiralty Park.\n\nFor a scenic destination run, take the short ferry ride from Changi Point to Pulau Ubin Island. The island is a large nature sanctuary featuring wetlands, quarries, mangrove swamps, and lush woodlands. Some easier trails, others more rugged."
