Jurong East MRT Station (NS1/EW24) is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station that is part of the North South Line (Branch Line before 1996) and the East West Line in Singapore, and serves as an interchange station between the two lines. It is located in the eastern portion of the town of Jurong, serving Jurong East Neighbourhoods 1, 2 and 4 and the commercial centre of the upcoming Jurong Gateway precinct in the Jurong Lake District.[1]

On the North South Line, it is the first station for south-bound trains and the last station for north-bound trains. On the East West Line, it is between the Chinese Garden and the Clementi MRT stations. During the morning and evening peak periods, there will be trains departing from Ulu Pandan Depot to arrive at the middle platform of the station to travel towards Marina Bay. During peak periods, some trains at the middle platform will terminate at Yew Tee and Ang Mo Kio MRT stations. When the MRT service is about to end for the day, trains at the middle platform will terminate at Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh MRT stations instead. Also, this is one of the four MRT stations to appear in the original Singapore Edition of Monopoly.
