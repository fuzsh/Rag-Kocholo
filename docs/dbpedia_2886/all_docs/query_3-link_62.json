        "text": "This article describes the historically high levels of investment in Spain’s railroads, resulting in new high speed lines and the acquisition of large amounts of new rolling stock. It presents an interview with Jose Salgueiro, the president of Renfe Operadora, Spain’s national railway. The company is in its second year of operations after the state-owned Renfe was split into two publicly owned companies. Commercial income from passenger and freight services is up, while costs remain under control. The goal for the 2005-2009 strategic plan is to increase passenger traffic by a little more than 19 percent. Opening new lines is expected to be a big contributor to the increase. There is also a sizable amount of money devoted to new train investment, which will add rolling stock for high speed corridors as well as modifications to existing trains. Renfe Operadora's companion company after the breakup is ADIF, which manages the infrastructure that supports Renfe's commercial operations. The two work closely together as the arrangement enters its second year. The article includes a map of the Iberian peninsula train network denoting new planned lines, lines under construction, and location of high speed routes that are being planned and under construction.\n\nAvailability:\n\nFind a library where document is available.
