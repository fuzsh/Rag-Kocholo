        "text": "Discount for children\n\nTravel terms and conditions for minors\n\nApplicable to all transport services on Renfe Viajeros (Renfe Passengers) trains nationwide, in addition to Renfe Viajeros (Renfe Passengers) Tourist Trains. These Commercial Regulations for journeys by minors will not be applicable to the above-mentioned Renfe Viajeros (Renfe Passengers) Tourist Trains.\n\nCheck the special terms and conditions for AVE (high-speed) International in the AVE (high-speed) France section.\n\nRegardless of their age, all children must have a valid ticket to travel on AVE (high-speed), AVLO, Alvia, Euromed, Intercity and Avant (mid-distance high-speed) trains.\n\nOn these services and on Regional train services combined with a Commercial Services train, minors under 14 years of age must travel accompanied by an adult, i.e. a person who is at least 14 years of age, and the sale of a ticket to an unaccompanied minor under 14 years of age is not permitted, regardless of whether a child fare or an adult fare is used.\n\nOn certain trains, Renfe offers a service so that children aged 6 to 13 can travel alone unaccompanied by an adult under the supervision of on-board staff. The terms and conditions of this service are set out in the \"Unaccompanied children travel service\".\n\nRenfe offers discounts and commercial advantages for travel by minors, as well as tickets for children that give the right to travel free of charge without occupying a seat, for which the commercial terms and conditions are set out in this regulation. For all tickets for children under 14 years of age, it is mandatory to fill in one of the contact details of the father, mother or guardian (at least the telephone number).\n\nOn Renfe Cercanías and Rodalies (Commuter) trains, the terms and conditions for travel by minors are different. On Renfe Cercanías (Commuter) (Iberian gauge and metric gauge), children under the age of 6 travel for free (up to a maximum of two children per adult ticket). On Rodalies (Commuter), children under the age of 4 travel for free. AVLO services have specific commercial conditions for the travel of minors.\n\nIn addition to minors travelling alone, on the services where it is allowed, both minors under 14 years of age who travel accompanied or using the Unaccompanied Children Travel Service, as well as those aged 14 to 17, will always do so under the responsibility of their parents or legal guardian. Authorisation to travel will not be requested except as regulated for the specific documentation of the Unaccompanied Children Travel Service.\n\nFree ticket for children aged 0 to 3 years without occupying a seat\n\nChildren under 4 can be issued a \"Free child ticket\" for travel, always sharing a seat. Maximum one child with free ticket for each companion with the corresponding paid ticket on AVE (high-speed), Alvia, Euromed, Intercity and Avant (mid-distance high-speed) services. Does not apply on AVLO, Regional trains (Iberian gauge and metric gauge) and Cercanías (Iberian gauge and metric gauge) services.\n\nA child under 4 years of age with a free ticket can only share a seat with a passenger who is aged 14 or over with an appropriate paid ticket. Free tickets for children aged 0 to 3 cannot be linked with discounted tickets for children aged 4 to 13.\n\nThe \"Free child ticket\" and the accompanying passenger's ticket have the same seat and carriage number allocated. Regardless of their age, when children share a seat, it may only be occupied by a maximum of two persons.\n\nChildren under 4 may travel occupying a seat by purchasing a \"Child\" fare ticket.\n\nThese tickets can be purchased at the same time as purchasing the accompanying passenger's ticket by selecting them on the number-of-passengers form, or at a later time through the option to add a child ticket. The child's ticket will show the name, surname and ticket number of the passenger accompanying the child. It does not accept add-ons.\n\nChanges and cancellations\n\nChanging or cancelling the paid ticket means the \"Free child ticket\" is also changed or cancelled .\n\nThe \"Free child ticket\" can be cancelled separately.\n\nMissed trains\n\nA \"Free child ticket\" can also be issued when the conditions of the accompanying passenger's paid ticket allow a \"Missed train\" ticket to be obtained.\n\nBoarding control and control during the journey\n\nThe \"Free child ticket\" must be presented together with the accompanying passenger's ticket, and some official document (National ID card, Official Family Record Book or similar) certifying the child's age or date of birth may be requested.\n\nDiscount for children aged 0 to 13 years occupying a seat\n\nTerms and conditions for children aged 4 to 13 years on the date of travel, or for children under 4 years old occupying a seat on any of the national routes of the AVE (high-speed), Alvia, Euromed, Intercity, Avant (mid-distance high-speed) and Regional train services (Iberian gauge and metric gauge).\n\nThe AVLO services have special prices for children.\n\nIndependent child fare tickets cannot be issued for AVE (high-speed), Alvia, Euromed, Intercity and Avant (mid-distance high-speed) services, or for Regional train services combined with a Commercial Services train.\n\nDiscount\n\nOn AVE (high-speed), Alvia, Euromed and Intercity services, a 40% discount will be applied to the dynamic price applicable at the time of purchase for the price option chosen. This discount does not apply to add-ons.\n\nOn Avant (mid-distance high-speed): 40% on the price of the General Fare.\n\nOn Regional trains: 40% on the base train fare for any route in the Network, when either one or both of the origin or destination stations is/are outside the Cercanías hubs, as well as between stations of different city/town centres. It will also apply between stations of the same Cercanías hub when the train has as a different base fare to Fare 1.\n\nIt cannot be combined any other discount, except for the Spanish Large Family discount and discounts which specifically permit it.\n\nSales channels\n\nDepending on the service being travelled on, tickets can be issued through station ticket offices, www.renfe.com, Renfe App, telephone sales, online agencies, physical travel agencies and self-service machines.\n\nCancellations\n\nPartial cancellation of adult tickets with a locator is not allowed if this would leave independent child tickets not cancelled. That is to say, at least one adult ticket must always be left not cancelled if child tickets remain valid. Partial cancellation of child tickets is allowed.\n\nTickets to travel on AVE (high-speed), Alvia, Euromed and Intercity may only be cancelled when the price option purchased includes this entitlement, or a supplement to improve cancellation conditions has been paid.\n\nThe change fee depending on the service and, where appropriate, the price option and purchased add-ons, along with the rest of the terms and conditions for this operation are given in \"Changes and Cancellations\".\n\nChanges\n\nPartial change of adult tickets with a locator is not allowed if this would leave independent child tickets unchanged or not cancelled, i.e. at least one adult ticket must always be left unchanged if child tickets are still valid.

The corresponding price difference will also be paid, where appropriate, if the new ticket is of a higher category price option. If the new ticket is of a lower price option than that of the missed train, no difference will be refunded.\n\nExtending the journey\n\nThis is allowed upon request to the inspection/supervision personnel en route, if free seats are available, paying the extension route under the terms and conditions established for this offer.\n\nSeat type or price option upgrade\n\nFor AVE (high-speed), Alvia, Euromed and Intercity, must be requested from the inspection/supervision personnel en route, who will check the availability of free seats.\n\nThe amount to be paid is the difference between the new price option's dynamic price, including the Child discount, and the price paid on the original ticket.\n\nBoarding control en route\n\nOn AVE (high-speed), Alvia, Euromed, Intercity and Avant (mid-distance high-speed) services, as well as on Regional train services combined with a Commercial Services train, children under 14 years of age who come unaccompanied will not be allowed to travel.\n\nCustomers, at boarding control or en route, must present their ticket and keep it until the end of the journey. In addition, train or station staff may ask customers to show a document to prove their identity and age. They must also present the documents accrediting a possible combined discount.\n\nIf the passenger is not the holder of the accreditation documents, does not present the documents, they are expired, or the passenger is not of the appropriate age to benefit from this offer, the passenger will be considered not to have a ticket valid for travel, and must settle the amount for the journey, if they have the means to do so, at the boarding control or at the station ticket office.\n\nIn the case of passengers without a ticket valid for travel en route, action will be taken in accordance with the provisions for passengers without a valid ticket.\n\nLoyalty Programme\n\nTickets with this discount do not earn Renfecitos (Renfe Points) as part of the loyalty programme, but they can be purchased using Renfecitos (Renfe Points).\n\nThese terms and conditions for pets apply to national AVE (high-speed), Larga Distancia (Long Distance), Avant (mid-distance high-speed), Regional (metric and Iberian gauge), Cercanías (Commuter, metric and Iberian gauge) and International AVE (high-speed) trains (only for pets with a maximum weight of 10 kg).
