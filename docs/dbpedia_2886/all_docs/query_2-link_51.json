        "text": "The Seville Cercanías trains are the local commuter trains that serve the city, and run frequently to small towns in the outskirts. Seville has a good train connection with Renfe suburban network.\n\nUnless you plan to visit one or some of the surrounding villages (e.g. the beautiful Utrera), you won’t need to use the Cercanías trains.\n\nHowever, if you plan to take the train to travel around Spain, you should definitely have a look at my complete guide on train travel from Seville.\n\nAlternatively, you can also read more about getting to Seville by train from other cities in Spain.\n\nThe Seville Cercanías trains network\n\nRenfe Operadora currently operates 254 km (158 mi) of railway infrastructure and 35 stations (1 of them linked to the Metro) in the Seville region.\n\nThe Cercanías or commuter service comprises 5 railway lines and currently offer the following routes:\n\nC-1 (light blue): Lebrija – Utrera – Santa Justa – Lora del Río\n\nC-2 (dark green): Santa Justa – Cartuja\n\nC-3 (red): Santa Justa – Cazalla – Constantina\n\nC-4 (purple): Línea Circular\n\nC-5 (dark blue): Jardines de Hércules – Santa Justa – Benacazón\n\nFor more information, you can download a Cercanías map that provides all the details.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no Cercanías train line linking the Seville airport with the city center.\n\nIn case you need it, here’s everything you need to know when arriving to Seville airport and how to get there from the city center.\n\nThe Seville Cercanías trains operating times and trips\n\nCercanías trains start running every day between 5:00 and 6:00 and stop at around midnight.\n\nTrains normally run every 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the line. At weekends and in the evening they are less frequent, and you may have to wait up to 15 to 60 minutes, depending on the time.\n\nDownload the Renfe Cercanías app (iOS or Android) to access a complete schedule of all Cercanías trains.\n\nAlternatively, you can also check the Cercanías schedules at Renfe’s website.\n\nThe Seville Cercanías trains tickets and fares\n\nThe price of the Cercanías train tickets varies according to the distance covered. You can buy, for example, a single ticket or a Bonotren with 10 trips.\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot use the same transport tickets as you would for Metro and buses.\n\nDon’t throw out your Cercanías train ticket and receipt until you’re well away from your destination train station. On arriving at your destination you’ll need your ticket again in order to exit the train platform area.\n\nIf you arrive to Seville by AVE, you can use your Combinado Cercanías ticket.\n\nThe main Cercanías train stations\n\nYou can also take the Cercanías within the city.\n\nSanta Justa. Seville’s main station is the most important Cercanías hub. All the lines leave from or go through it. You can also catch high-speed AVE and Media distancia trains.\n\nSan Bernardo. It the second big station of the city and all Cercanías lines (except C-2 and C-3) stop here. It’s also a Metro station (line 1) and many Tussam buses stop here.\n\nThis article is part of a complete tutorial about train travel from Seville where you can read all the information you need to organize your train journeys from the city.\n\nHere is a complete summary of all the guide:"
