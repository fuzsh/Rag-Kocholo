        "text": "The government of Spain wants Renfe-Operadora, the recently formed national train operator, to achieve financial independence by 2010. No agreement, however, has been signed by the Spanish government and Renfe-Operadora for the intervening period on issues such subsidy rates for public service obligation payments for loss-making service operations, service provision levels, and indebtedness limits. High speed train service, freight and passenger operations, investment and other financial issues, and historic debt of Spanish National Railways (Renfe), Spain's former fully integrated railway are among issues discussed. A box highlights Renfe-Operadora's management team.\n\nAvailability:\n\nFind a library where document is available.
