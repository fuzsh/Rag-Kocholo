        "text": "Contractual framework\n\nOn January 1st this year, the local railway service operated by Renfe Rodalies was transferred from the Spanish Central Government to the Government of Catalonia. 197 trains and around 900 workers provide the service. This is the first time that a regional government in Spain has taken over functions that have been, until now, exclusive to the Central Government.\n\nTo manage the transfer, the Catalan Government – Renfe\n\nOperadora Mixed Coordination and Control Body was set\n\nup, with four representatives each from the autonomous\n\nGovernment and the railway operator. Moreover, the\n\nCatalan Government has appointed the technical director of\n\nBarcelona Metropolitan Transport Authority as technical\n\ncoordinator of the Rodalia local railway service.\n\nThe powers transferred concern management, regulation,\n\nplanning, coordination and inspection of the service, as well\n\nas setting the fares.\n\nAccording to the transfer agreement, the Catalan Government\n\nundertakes to continue with the current contract-programme\n\nsigned with the Spanish Government until 31 December\n\n2010. After that date, the Government will be free to\n\nnegotiate a new contract for the 2011-2015 period or to\n\nappoint a new operator from 2012.\n\nFor its part, the State will assume the entire Renfe Operadora deficit, which is estimated at around 117.2 million euro per year. This amount includes operating loss, depreciation on investment and financial costs. The agreement specifies that the Catalan Government will assume no losses sustained by Renfe Operadora either in 2010 or in the previous years.\n\nWhen the current contract-programme expires, the Catalan\n\nGovernment will be free to renew it with Renfe or to appoint\n\na different operator to run Barcelona local railway services.\n\nWhether or not Renfe continues to operate the service, the\n\nState Administration will transfer to the Catalan Government an amount equivalent to the deficit generated by the provision of the service.\n\nThe Catalan Government may establish different quality\n\nlevels and its own fare policy. It may also modify the\n\nstandards of service from those agreed between the Spanish\n\nministry and Renfe (increased frequency, capacity of trains,\n\netc…).\n\nActions carried out\n\nOver the first half-year since the service was transferred,\n\nprogress has been made over four lines of action:\n\nExtension of the daily service span and increased weekend\n\nservices;\n\nIncreased the comfort, with the purchase of 59 new trains,\n\nreducing the average age of the train fleet to 10.7 years;\n\nImproved information and customer services, previously\n\na serious shortcoming;\n\nLaunch of a “mystery shopper” programme;\n\nIntroduction of automatic public address systems and\n\ninformation monitors at 70 of the 108 stations that\n\nform the network;\n\nNew image for Renfe Rodalies.\n\nAs a consequence of these improvements, the average user\n\nquality rating has risen from 6.24 to 6.31 in the six months\n\nsince the Catalan Government took over responsibility for\n\noperating the system."
