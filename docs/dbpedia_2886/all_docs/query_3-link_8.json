        "text": "¡Hola España! Renfe, Spain’s national train operator, is bringing its high-speed AVE trains to France, from July 13, 2023. Less than a year after Renfe-SNCF trains stopped operating between France and Spain in December 2022, Renfe is launching a new service offering direct, high-speed routes between the two countries. AVE trains will stop at 10 train stations in France on their journeys toward Barcelona and Madrid, with 1 journey each way every Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday between France and Spain.\n\nYou’ll be able to travel direct to Spain from Lyon or Marseille with tickets from €29. * If you want to travel to Spain from Montpellier, tickets will start at just €19. * With prices like that, it’s the perfect time to discover more of Spain for less. What’s more, if you want to explore France as well, tickets between French towns along Renfe’s routes will start at €9! *\n\nSay adiós to driving and au revoir to flying – instead, sit back and enjoy traveling in comfort on a high-speed train. Relax in Estándar (Standard Class) or treat yourself to Confort (First Class). Either way, hop on an AVE train and get free WiFi, individual power outlets, comfortable seats and air-conditioning.\n\nTickets for Renfe trains between France and Spain are now available to buy with Trainline. Vamos!\n\n* Prices subject to availability.\n\nThis map shows you the most popular train routes taken in Spain. There are thousands more you can take to explore each corner of this country. Using AVE, Alvia and Avant trains, you can create the perfect trip around Spain, with this map a perfect starting point.\n\nThere are many more places in Spain to visit by rail, including Cordoba, Valencia, Malaga and Alicante. Find out how to get to the Holy Grail in Valencia by train. Or, if you want to see Spain's capital and explore southern Spain too, why not travel from Madrid to Seville by train? For more inspiration around where Renfe trains can take you, then visit our trains in Spain page.\n\nThe map includes the recently completed Antequera-Granada high-speed line. This connects Granada to the high-speed Madrid-Malaga line – one of the main arteries running into the south of Spain. Work is currently ongoing to connect Seville and Antequera via a high-speed line.\n\nBásico\n\nBásico fares are for Estandár seating (the equivalent of Standard Class – more on that below) only. This is the cheapest fare and the best for travellers who aren’t fussed about flexibility. Básico fares cannot be refunded or exchanged – you must catch the specific fare listed on your ticket.\n\nPlease make sure that the name you book your ticket with matches the one you have on your ID, as it cannot be amended once you buy your ticket.\n\nYou will not be able to select your seat, however, this option can be purchased for an additional €8. Pets are also not allowed to travel with you on a Básico fare. Note: trading up to an Elige or Premium fare will cost €12 and €30 respectively.\n\nElige\n\nElige translates to ‘choose’ – this fare offers a greater array of optional extras and more flexibility for cancellations and exchanges. Firstly, you can purchase an Elige fare for either seating class, Estandár or Confort (the equivalent of First Class).\n\nThe first exchange for an Elige Confort or Elige Estandár ticket is free of charge. Other changes are subject to a €10 fee, plus the difference in price when compared to the new ticket, as applicable. If the new ticket is cheaper, no refund will be offered for the difference.\n\nSeat selection is also available as an optional extra for €5 and upgrading to a Premium fare costs €20. Pets can be added after booking for €10. Catering is available from the cold tray.\n\nYou can request refunds in the 'My Bookings' section of your account.\n\nPrémium\n\nThe Prémium fare is the most expensive fare but offers the most flexibility and applies exclusively to Confort (First Class) seating. Changing to a different service is free of charge and if you miss your train, it’s free to catch the next train.\n\nAt seat catering of hot food comes as standard and you can bring a pet for free. Note: the Prémium fare will only be available once hot food is made available again on Renfe trains.\n\nBook in advance\n\nIn theory, the cheapest tickets for AVE services come on sale 90 days ahead of the date of travel. For other services, such as Alvia and Avant, it’s around 60 days. Básico fares are the most heavily discounted fare option available, offering savings of 70% on the full fare. These fares work like airline tickets – becoming more expensive as the departure date approaches. The further in advance you book, the cheaper they will be.\n\nIn practice, Renfe often release blocks of tickets in one go. When that happens, the booking horizon can shrink to 45 days ahead of the date of travel. It’s not ideal – but stay patient and you’ll find a good deal!"
