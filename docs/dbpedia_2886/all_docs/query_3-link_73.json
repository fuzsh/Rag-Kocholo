However I can't find any timetables and don't know how long it will take. I think the FEVE line has been taken over by RENFE and there is nothing on line. Does anyone know how I can find a FEVE time table?\n\nBradypus\n\nMigratory hermit\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nToo many and too often!\n\nW\n\nwhariwharangi\n\nGuest\n\nMar 13, 2016\n\n#3\n\nGo to the Renfe site.\n\nFind the 'Commuter Trains and FEVE' button\n\nhttp://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/\n\nTia Valeria\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nPt Norte/Pmtvo 2010\n\nC.

This link is the most up to date as far as I know\n\nhttp://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/feve/ - one page further than the link above. I suggest checking all possible times and printing it, and if possible the stations en route too, because the timetable is no longer given out at stations. We have in the past broken the journey in various places like Ribadeo, Pravia (Hotel 14 is near the station), Oviedo, Arriondas, Ribadasella and Llanes. There are several places to stay in Oviedo near the station and it is worth breaking the journey here if nowhere else apart from the length of time otherwise on the train. Have a great ride.\n\nDeni Dawgs\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Ingles Planned 2016\n\nMay 15, 2016\n\n#5\n\nThank you all, with your help I found what I needed.\n\nAnd I apologize for my delay in responding to your kindnesses.

None of my searches have produced results. None of the above suggested URL's work. I even looked at RENFE Operadora (https://rail.cc/en/train-company/renfe/27) without much success. The same poor result from all RENFE searches.

Last time I looked there are not any Renfe trains including FEVE scheduled past mid June this year. Its too early and its the same lateness every year at this time.\n\nYou can use today's schedule for planning.\n\nSometimes the longer trips don't show up so you have to break the journey into pieces. I got one train on a search Bilbao to Oveido. I'd probably get more if I broke it up into Bilbao to Santander and Santander to Oveido.\n\nJan_D\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2021\n\nMay 7, 2017\n\n#8\n\nI just checked the times on the link provided by whariwharangi and the train times are the same as I remember from when I walked the Norte a couple of years ago. I doubt they'll change much next year. To get to Oviedo you'd have to make a connection in Santander, from where trains leave at 9am or 4pm, hence why there's only 1 option. The journey takes over 8 hours, however, so I'd recommend breaking it up as there are some beautiful spots along the line. If you want to get to Oviedo more quickly an Alsa bus can get you there in under 4 hours.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nLevant from Avila 2013\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nLevant from Avila 2013\n\nMay 7, 2017\n\n#10\n\nWe had a great Camino de Levante in 2013(from Avila), and I have the timetbles from our trip by bus to Finisterre, then on to Ferrol, Feve to Oviedo overnight and then to Bilbao, on on to Hendaye for a TGV to Paris and hime to Sydney. But these are probably out of date, and in addition in the wrong direction. My mobile also responds with \"Server not found\" messsage when pointed to REnfe website. A puzzlement."
