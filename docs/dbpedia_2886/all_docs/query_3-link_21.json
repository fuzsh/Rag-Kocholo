        "text": "What is Feve?\n\nFeve was a Spanish railway operator (the name of which was the acronym for Ferrocarriles de Vía Estrecho (narrow-gauge railways)), which managed the narrow-gauge (metric gauge) railway infrastructures for freight, commuter and regional passenger services.\n\nThe company was established in 1965 and operated mainly in the north of Spain, where it also created some of our most emblematic and historic tourist trains: El Transcantábrico and El Expreso de la Robla!\n\nWhat is Renfe Cercanías (Commuter) Metric Gauge?\n\nOver the years, Feve has upgraded and renewed its trains and routes. In 2013, it merged with Renfe Operadora, which gave rise to Renfe Feve, currently Renfe Cercanías (Commuter) Metric Gauge (Cercanías AM)."
