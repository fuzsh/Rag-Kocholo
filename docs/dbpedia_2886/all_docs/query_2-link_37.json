        "text": "Chapter 2: Fare and pricing system structure.\n\nRenfe Viajeros structures the pricing system for the services it offers to passengers into commercial services and services subject to public service obligations.\n\nAn issuance fee may be added to ticket prices, depending on the sales channel, or other fees for extra services that the customer arranges.\n\nCommercial services\n\nPrices for journeys on commercial service trains will depend on: train, date, place of departure-arrival, sales channel, terms and conditions of sale selected by the customer, and taxes in force. It is a dynamic pricing system and prices may vary during the sales period of each journey or service, depending on supply and demand. A series of additional supplements or services may also be offered on each journey, for greater convenience and customer satisfaction.\n\nRenfe Viajeros may combine the above pricing structure with other products, promotions or offers, which will change the prices or terms and conditions of sale. These products, and information about their terms and conditions and prices, can be consulted on the Renfe website, as well as through the other sales channels and at customer service offices. The purchase of such products signifies acceptance of the terms and conditions.\n\nServices subject to public service obligations\n\nThe prices of services subject to these obligations are approved and authorised by the competent government authorities.\n\nThe overall price (general fare or basic fare), is the one authorised by the central government and the one that will be applied to each train, travel class, and place of departure-arrival, including taxes in force. These prices can be consulted through any information and sales channel authorised by Renfe Viajeros.\n\nThe structure of the Cercanías (commuter) pricing service establishes the prices authorised by Cercanías hub (geographical area where the Cercanías (commuter) trains service is provided) and areas travelled.\n\nThe pricing system structures, on which the authorised prices for the Media Distancia (mid-distance) services area based, are unique and apply to each service offer.\n\nPromotions and discounts\n\nRenfe Viajeros offers customers a series of commercial products aimed at the general public or specific groups/users.\n\nTo be entitled to them, the customer must meet the requirements established for each of them, and accept the terms and conditions of use.\n\nFor services subject to public service obligations, promotional or discounted prices are calculated based solely on the prices authorised by the central government.\n\nIn general, for services subject to public service obligations, discounts cannot combined with other commercial offers, unless expressly specified, in which case the combination of discounts or offers will only be allowed under the terms established in the terms and conditions for the commercial product.\n\nSpanish Large Family reductions can be combined with any other discount on the applicable fare, except in the case of products, services or offers established under an agreement, or any that are used or paid on a non-individual basis.\n\nIn the case of commercial services, Spanish Large Family discounts will only be applicable to prices and considerations that refer specifically to the transport services, under the terms established in regulations that establish discounts for Spanish Large Family members and subsequent compensation to the railway companies.\n\nChapter 5: Ticket validity\n\n5.1- Tickets are only valid from the time of purchase until the end of the journey (or journeys, in the case of combined or multiple-journey tickets). In the case of some services they will be valid for a certain period, for the dates, trains, routes, zones and types of seats or classes listed on them. Passengers must keep the ticket until the end of the purchased services. Named tickets are only valid for the ticket holder.\n\nThe passenger must keep the ticket with them during the journey, in a format authorised by Renfe Viajeros, formalised or validated where appropriate, with the original documents in force that prove the passenger's identity when necessary, and any credentials that justify the discounts to which they are entitled.\n\nMultiple-journey tickets will specify the validity period. The tickets are only valid for travel once formalised or validated for each journey, using the validation machines in the stations or on board the trains. Formalisation means securing a seat for a specific date and train. Validating a ticket is the process of showing that a journey has been made using the machines or systems provided for that purpose. Tickets must be booked and purchased and multiple-journey tickets must be formalised using the sales channels enabled for this purpose.\n\nAny ticket purchased before a price change will be valid for the established date or period without the passenger being required to pay any difference.\n\nIn Cercanías (commuter) services with no assigned seats, for tickets to be considered valid they must be validated before the start of the journey and at the end of it.\n\n5.2- A ticket is considered invalid if it has not been formalised or validated, which is required by the passenger, or when it has been manipulated or forged. It is also considered invalid: if it is damaged in any way which means the information cannot be checked, if it has been amended, laminated, is not supported by the necessary documents for the type of ticket purchased, if it has been annulled, has expired or does not match the specific circumstances of the passenger or route.\n\n5.3- For services subject to public service obligations, purchasing more than one ticket simultaneously or consecutively will not be valid to make the same journey at a lower price.\n\nChapter 1: Rights\n\nRenfe Viajeros passengers have the following rights, among others:\n\n1. To be informed that these general terms and conditions exist, which will be available on the Renfe website, through the sales channels and points of sale and at customer service offices.\n\n2. To have access, well in advance, to the schedules and prices of the services, and other information available about the rail service. In particular, in the event of a delay of departure or arrival, to be informed of the situation and of the estimated time of departure and arrival, as soon as this information is available.\n\n3. To receive the following information before the journey, if requested:\n\nSchedules and conditions of the fastest journey and the cheapest price options and fares.\n\nAccessibility, conditions of access and availability of facilities for people with disabilities or reduced mobility.\n\nSeats available.\n\nActivities that may disrupt or delay services.\n\nAvailability of extra services.\n\nTerms and conditions for luggage allowance and accessibility and conditions of access for bicycles.\n\nProcedures for recovering forgotten or lost luggage.\n\nProcedures for filing claims and complaints.\n\n4. To receive the following information during the journey:\n\nOn-board services.\n\nNext stop.\n\nPossible delays and incidents.\n\nMain connection services.\n\nSecurity issues.\n\n5. To enter into a transport contract in accordance with current laws, by purchasing a valid ticket for the journey from or to any of the stations at which passengers board or alight the purchased journey, notwithstanding the provisions of Heading IV Chapter 2 \"Boarding the Train\" of these general terms and conditions. For these purposes, trains will only stop at stations or stops previously established by Renfe Viajeros.\n\n6. Receive the purchased service according to proper quality and safety standards.\n\n7. Be kept up-to-date about the set procedures to settle disputes that may arise relating to rail transport:\n\na) Passengers, without prejudice to being able to defend their claims before ordinary jurisdiction, are entitled to address claims and complaints related to the provision of the service directly to Renfe Viajeros, under the terms of Heading IX Chapter I \"Guarantees for passengers\" of these general terms and conditions.\n\nb) Renfe Viajeros will place a complaint form or log at the disposal of users, with the format or template allowed by law.\n\nc) Likewise, customers are entitled to address their claims related to the provision of the rail transport service and defend those claims before the competent arbitration bodies.\n\n8. To receive compensation for damages caused to them in the event that Renfe Viajeros does not fulfil its obligations.\n\n9.

This information will be available at customer service offices, through the different sales channels and on the Renfe website.\n\n10.

Refrain from smoking, handing out flyers, putting up posters, begging, organising raffles or games of chance for profit and selling goods or services on Renfe trains, facilities and areas, without previous written authorisation from Renfe Viajeros, or any other action prohibited by current legislation.\n\n5. Board or disembark the train when it has come to a full stop only at the stations established for this purpose; only travel in places authorised for passengers, taking care not to obstruct passage in places intended for the transit of people; and refrain from entering the driver's cab or other places on trains or facilities reserved for the exclusive use of railway personnel or authorised persons.\n\n6. Respect vehicles and installations, as well as refrain from any action that may endanger the safety of the railway and any equipment and facilities, or damage or dirty equipment, trains or railway facilities.\n\n7. Refrain from manipulating the door opening or closing mechanisms or any other mechanism or device that is for the exclusive use of Renfe Viajeros staff; from using the alarm or train stop buttons or any other train device without justified cause; from preventing or forcing the opening or closing of the train doors; and from throwing or leaving objects or dumping anything in trains or railway facilities.\n\n8.

Passengers travelling without a valid ticket and adjusting this en route\n\nCustomers must have a valid ticket for the duration of the journey, which must be shown, along with proof of identity, to Renfe Viajeros staff or authorised staff whenever required and must be kept until the end of the purchased services.\n\nIf the customer does not show their ticket or any proof of identity en route, they will be considered to be travelling without a valid ticket and the on-board inspector will adjust this situation.\n\nThis procedure will be as follows:\n\n1.1. If the customer has come from a station without ticket sale, or from a station where ticket sale is temporarily unavailable, the customer shall pay the ticket amount for the journey in question.\n\nIf the customer is entitled to a discount, they must prove this en route for it to be applied, otherwise they must pay the ticket at the general/basic fare or reference price. If Renfe Viajeros cannot apply the requested fare en route, the customer must pay the ticket at the general/basic fare or reference price, and may subsequently claim a refund for the difference.\n\nIn exceptional cases, passengers with visual impairment, wheelchair users, elderly passengers or passengers with intellectual or cognitive disabilities will only pay the ticket amount for the journey in question, even if they can purchase a ticket from a self-service machine at the station or through other channels.\n\n1.2. In any other case not listed in section 1.1 above, passengers without a valid ticket will be subject to the penalties that apply. Tickets that are not valid or are used fraudulently will be confiscated by on-board inspectors, without the right to any refund, and without prejudice to the actions or penalties listed below.\n\n2. Penalties for travelling without a valid ticket\n\nIf the customer does not have a valid ticket or is not entitled to the discounts granted and boards the train without fulfilling the circumstances administration fee established by Renfe Viajeros, in addition to the following penalties for improper access to the train:\n\nAlta Velocidad-Larga Distancia (high-speed-long distance) and Larga Distancia (long distance) - €300\n\nAlta Velocidad-Media Distancia (high-speed-mid-distance) - €200\n\nMedia Distancia Convencional (regional train) - €200\n\nCercanías (commuter) - €100\n\nIf the payment is made within less than 30 calendar days, the payable amount for these penalties will be reduced by 50%, in accordance with the rules, specific procedures and through the sales channels that are established for each rail service.\n\n3. Non-admission of passengers\n\nRenfe Viajeros may force passengers to leave the train if they are travelling without a valid ticket and have refused to adjust this situation, or passengers whose conduct, or carrying any item, luggage or container that causes a disturbance or endangers the safety and proper functioning of rail operations, or endangers or seriously bothers other passengers.\n\nAccess shall be prohibited to scooters, unicycles or any other electric or battery-powered personal mobility device, as they are considered a danger to the safety and proper functioning of transport operations and passengers.\n\nIn any case, vehicles used by people with reduced mobility and electric bicycles, are excluded from this prohibition.\n\nIn these cases, those passengers must leave the train at the station where it has stopped, or if it is in transit, at the next station where it stops, without the right to reimbursement of the price paid, and without prejudice to any penalties for their violations, and the penalties provided for in these general terms and conditions.\n\nAccess to vehicles and to boarding lounges or waiting rooms can also be denied for those persons who do not respect the security controls established.\n\nChapter 2: Liability for cancellation, disruption or delay\n\nPassengers affected by a cancelled, disrupted or delayed journey may be entitled to receive the compensation provided for in applicable legislation.\n\nIf the delay of departure or arrival is greater than 60 minutes, Renfe Viajeros will be obliged to provide the passenger with assistance under the terms established in current legislation.\n\nWhen a service hired by people with disabilities or reduced mobility is cancelled or disrupted, their ticket will be authorised for another train or means of transport, with the same accessibility conditions as originally agreed.\n\nThe passenger will not be entitled to compensation if Renfe Viajeros informs them of the delay before they purchase the ticket or if the delay is less than 60 minutes.\n\nIn any case, more favourable compensation than specified in these general terms and conditions may be provided. This more favourable compensation will be available to customers on the Renfe website, as well as through the different authorised sales channels and at customer service offices.\n\nThe provisions of this paragraph will apply to journeys under tickets issued by the Transport Consortiums and Authorities and multiple-journey tickets, in accordance with their specific terms and conditions of sale, and with the exceptions and limitations provided for in applicable regulations.\n\nFor successive transport services operated by one or more railway undertakings, the provisions of legislation in force and agreements and contracts signed between the various undertakings will apply.\n\n1. Cancelling the journey\n\nCancellation of the journey is understood as the non-fulfilment of this, that is, the impossibility of it taking place under the conditions specified on the ticket.\n\nIf the cause of the cancellation is attributable to the operating company, the advance notice of the cancellation will be taken into account, and depending on that advance notice the passenger will be entitled to the following:\n\nIf the cancellation occurs before 48 hours, the passenger is entitled to a refund of the price paid for the ticket or to exchange the ticket for another train or another date at no extra cost.\n\nIf the cancellation occurs within 48 hours prior to the departure time shown on the ticket, the passenger has the right to be reimbursed the price paid or to be provided with transport on another train or other means of transport under conditions equivalent to those agreed.\n\nIf the cancellation is announced within 4 hours prior to the departure time stated on the ticket, the passenger is entitled to a refund of the ticket price or to be provided with transportation on another train or other means of transport. If the passenger chooses not to use the alternative transport offered, they are also entitled to receive compensation for twice the amount of the ticket.\n\nOn Cercanías (commuter) (Iberian gauge and metric gauge) and Media Distancia Convencional (regional train) (metric gauge) services, when the journey is cancelled due to the suspension/stoppage of the service for at least one hour, the passenger may choose to:\n\nTerminate the transport contract, receiving the full amount of the journey.\n\nAuthorise the ticket for a time when the journey can be made.\n\nMake the journey using other means of transport that Renfe Viajeros authorises.\n\nIf the passenger chooses to use the alternative transport offered, the provisions of the applicable terms and conditions of sale will apply, which can be consulted in the information available on the Renfe website, as well as through the authorised sales channels and at the customer service offices.\n\nThe compatibility of compensation for cancellations with other compensation to which the passenger may be entitled will depend on the provisions of the applicable terms and conditions of sale, which can be consulted on the Renfe website, through the authorised sales channels and at customer service offices.\n\n2. Stopping the journey\n\nA disrupted journey is one that stops after it has started.\n\nWhen any of the following situations arise as a result of the disruption of the journey, the provisions below will apply.\n\nIf the train is blocked on the tracks, Renfe Viajeros will provide transport to the departure railway station, to an alternative departure station or to the final destination of the service, as long as this is physically possible.\n\n3. Delays\n\nThe time that passes between the passenger's scheduled time of arrival, according to the published schedule, and the actual time of arrival at the arrival station specified on the ticket is considered a delay.\n\nWhen it is expected that the train will leave the departure station later than the published schedule, the customer will be entitled to one of the following options:\n\nChange the ticket for another train, to travel on a different date, at no extra cost\n\nA refund of the price paid for the journey not travelled,\n\nContinue the journey on the same train.\n\nIf during the journey there is a delay equal to or greater than 60 minutes regarding arrival at the destination specified on the ticket, the passenger may opt for:\n\na) A reimbursement of the amount of the ticket for to the part of the journey not made.\n\n(b) If, as a result of this delay, the journey loses its purpose for the passenger or they do not wish to continue their journey, they will also be entitled to receive the amount of the ticket for the part of the journey travelled. In this case, Renfe Viajeros will provide a return service to the point of departure as soon as possible.\n\nc) Continuation of the journey to the destination either via the planned route or by another alternative route, under conditions of transport similar to those purchased. The passenger can also choose to make the journey at a later date, at no extra cost.\n\nExcept for the reasons provided for by current legislation, in the event of a delayed arrival at the destination of 60 minutes or more, the customer will be entitled to compensation equivalent to 50 percent of the price of the ticket used. When this delay exceeds 90 minutes, the compensation will be equivalent to the total price.\n\n4. Guaranteed connection\n\nRenfe Viajeros guarantees connections between its trains under the conditions listed below, except for Cercanías (commuter) trains and other services or products where the specific terms and conditions of sale mention this.\n\nThis guarantee will apply only when, between the theoretical time of arrival of the first train and the departure time of the second, there is a time lapse of 60 minutes -if the train change is at the same station- or 90 minutes -if the train change is between two stations in the same municipality- and will entitle the passenger to the compensation expressly established in the specific terms and conditions of sale for missed connections.\n\nFor Cercanías (commuter) services, the connection is not guaranteed in any case.\n\nTransfers with other means of transport or trains belonging to different railway companies, under combined tickets, will be regulated in accordance with the provisions of current legislation, as well as in the agreements and contracts signed between the different companies."
