        "text": "Regional rail services between France and Germany are poor, but change is supposed to be around the corner. A fleet of new Régiolis trains for the these services has been ordered and built (and I set out to find them) but when the operations of these trains will start, and who will operate them, is currently unclear. There is a danger that rather than later this year, the trains will only enter service in 2026 or 2027 – meaning a fleet worth €376 millon will be parked up not being used.\n\nWhat is the most plausible theory of what is happening?\n\nThe trains will operate in 1 French Région (Grand Est) and 3 German Länder (Baden Württemberg, Rheinland-Pfalz, Saarland). Grand Est wanted SNCF to operate the trains, while the Länder wanted a competitive tender to find an operator. Rather than sort this out while the trains were being built, decisions on operations were delayed until this year – the Länder won out (there will be a tender), but even if a winner is announced this year, whoever wins will not be able to start right away – and so an interim solution for the operations would be needed. Until a temporary solution is found (and it looks unlikely this will happen at the time of writing) the danger is the trains stay parked up not being used for three and half years, and cross border services remain lousy in the meantime.\n\nBackground and timeline\n\nThe story starts back in 2009, when Alstom wins the “framework contract of the century” to build the new generation of regional trains for the French Régions, appropriately to be called Régiolis. More than 360 of these trains of this type are already in service, and they were to be built at Reichshoffen in Alsace. CAF has subsequently taken over the Reichshoffen works from Alstom, but that is incidental to our story here.\n\nRight from the off (it’s mentioned in the press release confirming the contract) versions of the trains with 15kV ac electrification for Germany and Switzerland were foreseen, and trains equipped with diesel motors as well as electric (bi-mode) were available. The first bi-modes appeared in 2014, the first versions with 15kV started operating on the Léman Express network in 2019.\n\n22 October 2019 – as part of the wider framework contract – an order is placed for 30 Régiolis trains will also be able to operate in Germany. The value of the order is €360 million (later this rose to €376 million – of which €3 million is EU money from Interreg), and the trains will be able to operate on two electric systems – 25kV ac for northern France, 15kV ac for Germany, and diesel – bi mode.\n\n22 November 2020 – Lok Report had the first news about operations – there was supposed to be a tender, and they link to this Ted page about the tender… but that page is now empty (in French, German and English).\n\n9 July 2021 – less than 2 years after the order was placed – Ministerpräsident of Rheinland-Pfalz Malu Dreyer was pictured with a pre-series train at Neustadt an der Weinstraße (set number 85503-85504), and set 85501-85502 was dispatched to Velim for tests. At this time December 2024 was already the proposed start date for operations.\n\n25 December 2021 – Lok Report finally has more, and a link to what looks like a more complete tender process – 665162-2021 – with December 2024 being the start of operations, with the option for some steady introduction of some services up until 2027. Date for submission of tender bids was 25 February 2022, and today we still do not know who won.\n\n28 April 2023 – nvbv has by this point changed its tone. It announces that all documents have been provided to tender bidders, but that operation of the services will now start from December 2026, 2 years later than everyone had been saying. But there is still no information about when the tender process will be completed. Peculiarly on 11 September 2023 Rheinland-Pfalz put up a new story sticking to the 2024 date.\n\n18 July 2023 – Die Rheinpfalz had an interesting story about the headaches with the tender that were brewing, but nevertheless hoped that Neustadt (Weinstraße) – Strasbourg could get 6 trains a day still (via Wissembourg). Soon after – 12 September 2023 – there were already the beginnings of ideas for interim solutions 2024-2026 according to this BahnBlogStelle piece.\n\nOn a webpage without a date on it, Zweckverband ÖPNV Rheinland-Pfalz Süd currently states that the conclusion of the tender process is now foreseen for end of 2024 / start of 2025, and services from December 2027. But the problem is they forgot that the internet never forgets, especially the Wayback Machine. In this 24 February 2024 snapshot, they state mid 2024 for the conclusion of the tender and – significantly – there is a text that states (my translation) “In order to achieve initial improvements for customers as quickly as possible, a run-up operation with the two existing companies DB Regio and SNCF is planned on individual routes from December 2024” – and by today that text has been removed.\n\nIt is hence from that timeline that I conclude that December 2027 is now to be the start of operations of the new trains, and that efforts to achieve an interim solution 2024-2027 have failed. That means – at the time of writing – it looks like the Régiolis trains are going to be standing idle for three and a half years.\n\nThe trains themselves\n\nTo test this idea that some, if not all, of the trains could be used on an interim basis from December 2024, I wanted to see how many of them have indeed been built and could be deployed. So on 31st July and 1st August 2024 I set out to find the trains. A few tip-offs on social media helped me work out where to go.\n\nI can confirm that 13 of the cross border Régiolis were parked at Lauterbourg on 31 July – 11 at BCAuto Enchères opposite the railway station (Google Maps here) and 2 further south at the Port du Rhin (Google Maps).\n\nA further 8 trains were at the ex-Alstom (now CAF) plant at Reichshoffen on 1 August – 4 to the south of the plant (Google Maps), and 4 more either alongside or within the main plant (Google Maps)\n\nAnd a final 2 trains were at the SNCF Technicentre Alsace (Google Maps) – also 1 August\n\nSo that means at least 23 of the fleet of 30 trains is complete.\n\nSo what should be done with these trains?\n\nThe old version of the Zweckverband ÖPNV Rheinland-Pfalz Süd page cited above has the right idea – these trains should be deployed on existing cross border routes as soon as possible, to ease the rolling stock capacity problems, and also eliminate diesel traction on electrified routes.\n\nFirst priority would be to run Régiolis on Strasbourg – Offenburg, where capacity on the existing diesel railbuses is far too limited, and these run on a line that is electrified throughout. Régiolis would replace both SNCF and SWEG railbuses here.\n\nA similar solution would be available right away for Saarbrücken – Forbach, where Régiolis would replace X 73900 on an electrified line, even with the possibility of running as far as Metz right from the start.\n\nWörth (Rhein) – Lauterbourg has a different issue – the DB 628 DMU used there is not disabled accessible and has no air conditioning, so running a Régiolis here would be a major step forward for all passengers.\n\nMulhouse – Müllheim (Baden) would also benefit from new trains, but a driver shortage there means all trains are replaced by buses at the moment, so Régiolis there should only happen once the other lines are fixed. Winden (Pfalz) – Wissembourg runs with Talent DMUs that are passable for now, Saarbrücken – Sarreguemines is ok with the tram and a few trains for now, Perl – Thionville has a weekend only service so let’s not get carried away asking that gets stepped up, and let’s not dream for Niedaltdorf – Bouzonville currently.\n\nSo for the three priority borders, are there enough Régiolis trains to cover those services: clearly and obviously YES. So that is how a temporary solution should look – run the new trains on those lines as soon as possible. This is the short term priority – make this happen.\n\nFAQ\n\nAre these trains too complex?\n\nTwo electric systems, and diesel, is a common combination in France – even the AGC trains (predecessor of the Régiolis) had this from 2009 onwards. Régiolis bi mode trains have been in service since 2014. The only difference with the cross border Régiolis is the replacement of 1.5kV dc with 15kV ac, and 15kV ac has been used successfully on the Léman Express units. So no, ultimately, I see no reason why these trains should be any more complicated than hundreds of others already in operation in France and Switzerland.\n\nIs this all actually a problem of rolling stock authorisation instead?\n\nI don’t think so, but I cannot be 100% sure, because not all the necessary information is available in public. I can find no information about the approval of this Régiolis variant in ERATV, although there is a fiche for the Léman Express ones. I however cannot see how a reasonably simple 160km/h train, where a similar version was approved, can be encountering major headaches in terms of approval – not least as they have now had 3 years to iron out any kinks. There is no reference in any news story anywhere to approval problems being the reason for the delays. Also given there were pre-series trains (in 2021) and then series production (from 2023), I cannot imagine the latter happening if there were some major technical headache still to overcome.\n\nDo you have any close up pictures of the trains?\n\nYes.
