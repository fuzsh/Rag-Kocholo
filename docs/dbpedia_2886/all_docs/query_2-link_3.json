        "text": "Alta Velocidad (High-speed)\n\nThe future of Renfe Operadora's commercial services, Alta Velocidad (high-speed) and Larga Distancia (Long Distance), is going to be in the context of a free market. Faced with the prospects of growth in demand and a new, low-cost travel model, we have added 30 new Alta Velocidad (high-speed) trains to our fleet and this will be the 106 series.\n\nAvlo\n\nWe have remodelled 5 of the 30 trains from the 112 series in the fleet to use them for Avlo â€“ our low-cost, high-speed service. These trains, which are all one class, do not have a buffet car and have 438 seats with sockets for each of them.\n\nS-106\n\nThese trains will make up Renfe's 106 series and will be able to travel at speeds of up to 330 km/h. They will be made up of eleven carriages with a total of 521 seats that will be laid out, depending on the types designed, in rows of 2+2 and 3+2 seats, all able to be turned to face in the direction the train is moving. The capacity of the trains in this series is greater than that of any of the other trains that provide Renfe's commercial services."
