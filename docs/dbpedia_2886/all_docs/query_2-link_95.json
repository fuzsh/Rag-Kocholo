        "text": "Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. has been selected to provide broadband internet on Renfe Operadora (Renfe) high-speed trains throughout Spain. Renfe is currently engaged in a major transformation and modernization project including an overhaul of its Information and Communications (ICT) technology systems. A key factor of the ICT overhaul is the provision of reliable and consistent broadband connectivity for Internet usage on its fleet of high-speed trains.\n\nGilat was chosen by Aicox, the project integrator to join a consortium of leading players delivering satellite based reliable broadband connectivity to Renfe’s high-speed trains. Gilat’s ER-7000 antenna passed rigorous testing and certifications, including the stringent European EN 50155 compliance requirements.\n\nGilat’s ER-7000 low-profile tracking antenna was designed for high-speed trains operating in harsh weather conditions. Its aerodynamic build and rugged radome contribute to the antenna’s robustness. The antenna is wide reaching with a high gain, cost effectively meeting high throughput broadband communication needs during fast train travel.\n\nThe project consists of nearly one hundred trains, all of Renfe AGV (Automotrice Grande Vitesse) high-speed train fleet. Gilat’s broadband connectivity for trains is now being implemented, with initial deployment planned for this quarter.\n\nShare on:"
