        "text": "Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles, or Renfe in short, was created in 2005 after the splits of the railway infrastructure (Adif) and operators (Renfe-Operadora for passenger and Renfe Mercancías for freight transport). It has also branched out maintenance (Integria) and rolling stock rental (Alquiler).\n\nThe company has bold ambitions abroad, managing, owning or partially owning several projects and operators worldwide. This includes Haramain High-Speed Project in Saudi Arabia, the Central Texas high-speed project, Rail Baltica, Leo Express, Tren de Maya, EFE, and others. By 2028, these projects should reach 10% of the company’s income.\n\nBut, most of Renfe’s work is at home – in Spain. The government-owned entity has recently launched an ambitious fleet renewal project. Out of the total numbers, 406 trains and 24 locomotives have been ordered so far. This article represents an overview of what is on order and who will deliver the rolling stock.\n\nPassenger service (AVE, Avlo, Media Distancia, Cercanías, narrow-gauge)\n\nPassenger trains of all kinds will get significant capacity, comfort, and upgrade in the coming years. All major players, having their production facilities in Spain, will be included in the project that encompasses high-speed rail (AVE, Avlo), medium-distance intercity trains (Media Distancia), commuter trains (Cercanías, and, in the case of Catalunya, Rodalies), and also narrow-gauge trains still operated in this second most hilly country of Europe. This is a split among manufacturers:\n\nCAF:\n\n60 trains (52 x three-car, 8 x four-car) for Media Distancia – equipped with a battery to avoid delays in case of power outages, yet not for longer travels\n\n29 trains (four-car) for Cercanías (commuter trains)\n\n37 trains for the narrow-gauge network in Asturian, Basque, Castilla y León, Cantabria, Galicia and the C9 Cercanías line in the Madrid area\n\nThere is still an option for 10 more trains to be ordered in the CAF framework contract.\n\nAlstom:\n\n201 single and double-deck trains (each six-car train with two double-deck cars) that recently got a new design revealed for Cercanías and Rodalies (Catalan commuter service)\n\nStadler:\n\n79 single and double-deck trains (55 eight-car and 24 four-car trains with end cars being single deck)\n\nTalgo:\n\n30 high-speed S-106 trains\n\n26 power cars for the S-107 trains (with an option for 14 more) – to start operations in November 2023\n\n14 high-speed Talgo Class S-730 trains overhaul (dual-voltage, electric and diesel)\n\n30 high-speed Talgo S-130 trains overhaul (dual voltage, electric)\n\nFreight service (Mercancías)\n\nThe freight operator Renfe Mercancías is currently searching for a strategic partner to take 50% of the company share. Contestants are MSC (which already has Medway as its rail operator in the country), Maersk, and CMA-CGM (which also has a rail freight operator in Spain already - Continental Rail). Other major rail freight companies in Spain include Captrain España, Logitren (owned by shipping company COSCO), Low Cost Rail, ALSA, Traccion Rail, or FGC. Most of the cargo on Spanish railways are container trains, known as Teco here. Other significant commodities are cars, steel and its products, or grain, but the share of freight rail in the country is way below the European average – around 5%. The planned rolling stock highways projects, massive investments into new terminals, and the Mediterranean Corridor project aim to change this. To be ready for this change, Renfe Mercancías is also part of the fleet renewal program, which includes these orders:\n\nStadler:\n\n24 EURO6000 six-axle locomotives – 12 for Iberian gauge and 12 for the standard gauge, the latter be used on the Mediterranean Corridor\n\n149 new wagons with a maximum speed of 100 km/h\n\n74 Sgnss 60’ container-hauling wagons\n\n75 Sdggmrss semitrailer-hauling wagons\n\nIn addition, 28 out of its 100 Alstom Traxx (F140DC) locomotives will be equipped with the ERTMS system."
