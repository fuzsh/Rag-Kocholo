        "text": "What is Sagrero's famous for?\n\nSagrera railway station is a major through station under construction in the Barcelona districts of Sant Andreu and Sant Martí, in Catalonia, Spain. It is intended to serve as the central station for northern and eastern Barcelona, with Sants serving as the central station for southern and western Barcelona. Together with El Prat de Llobregat and Sants, currently the only high-speed rail stations in the Barcelona area, it will be on the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line. It will also be on the conventional Barcelona–Cerbère and Barcelona–Mataró–Maçanet-Massanes railways. Once fully completed, it will be a major public transport hub, with dedicated stations on Barcelona Metro lines 4 and 9/10, as well as a bus station. The complex will be fully underground excepting for the station building, with two levels of platforms, accounting for a total of 18 railway tracks.. You can find more here."
