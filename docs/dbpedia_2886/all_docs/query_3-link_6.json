        "text": "Our beginnings, those of the train in Spain, date back to 1941, when a process of reconstructing and nationalizing the railway industry took place in our country and gave rise to the Red Nacional de Ferrocarriles Espa√±oles- RENFE (National Network of Spanish Railways).\n\nFrom that moment on, work began on gradually replacing the steam system with an electrical system, which was followed by the first commercial Talgo and the first diesel locomotives. The 1050s were a time for technological renewal marked development.\n\nFrom the mid-1960s on, modernization of the infrastructure started and, at the beginning of the 1980s, Spain took one of the main strategic decisions for the future of the railway. Spain committed, firstly, to the creation of Commuter systems in large urban areas and, secondly, to the development of a high-speed network that would culminate in the inauguration of the Madrid-Seville AVE (high-speed) in 1992, which would be definitively developed from the decade 2000 to the present day."
