        "text": "Talgo has initiated the delivery of the Avril trains to Renfe this week, following the successful completion of driver training and extensive reliability and running-in tests on various track types across Spain. This delivery marks the culmination of a thorough testing phase, where nearly 300,000 kilometers of test routes have been logged in the last year, half of which were completed in 2024 alone. These tests included extensive checks for compatibility with all Spanish railway lines, including those connecting regions such as Galicia, the Principality of Asturias, Catalonia, and the Valencian Community.\n\nApproximately 200 personnel have worked on this project in roles spanning commissioning, verification and validation, engineering, and maintenance. The comprehensive testing phase also involved collaboration with over a dozen companies within the Spanish railway sector and two universities.\n\nEach of the 30 Avril trains for Renfe can accommodate up to 581 passengers while maintaining a lighter total weight, which contributes to minimized energy consumption and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The train features a single floor, 200-meter long layout with all passenger cars aligned at the same height as the platform, simplifying access for all passengers, including those with reduced mobility, parents with strollers, and travelers with bulky luggage or bicycles.\n\nEach train is adaptable, featuring the ability to change track gauges (both Iberian and international) and is equipped for operation beyond Spain, including in northern regions such as France. On September 7, 2022, the Avril set a world speed record for Iberian gauge at 360 km/h on the Ourense-Santiago de Compostela high-speed line in Galicia."
