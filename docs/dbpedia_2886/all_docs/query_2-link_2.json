        "text": "The company does not disclose sufficient emissions intensity data to meaningfully assess performance in the past or project future performance. The company should report its emissions data per passenger-kilometre travelled and tonne-kilometre travelled. This information will enable the company to create a more robust transition plan. Though the company reports that only 20% of its fleet is run on diesel it does not clarify if the remaining 80% of its fleet is low-carbon or its deployment schedule to decarbonise its diesel trains.\n\nRenfe works in partnership with key infrastructure operators to develop infrastructure enabling the operation of low-carbon vehicles and energies. The company worked with ADIF, the state rail infrastructure operator, on its Master Plan to Fight Climate Change, in line with a below 2-degrees scenario. The company can go further by partnering with suppliers and manufacturers. This can include setting science-based targets to reduce value chain emissions and developing joint low-carbon research and development projects.\n\nRenfe has several programmes to influence passenger customer behaviour to reduce GHG emissions. The company provides passengers with information comparing the carbon emissions attributed to train use versus other modes of travel. The company has a rewards programme to encourage greater use of the train network. Renfe is also piloting Renfe-as-a-Service, making it simpler for passengers to use multi-modal low-carbon options. The company can set quantitative GHG emissions reduction targets for these programmes. It should also seek to replicate these offers for its freight transport services.\n\nThe company has developed a low-carbon transition plan, covering the purchase of new trains, alternative energies and energy efficiency audits. Despite claiming to be aligned with a below 2 degrees scenario, Renfe discloses no evidence of scenario analysis. Additionally, although the company has set a 2050 net-zero target, the transition plan only extends to 2030. Renfe can improve its plan by including verifiable and quantifiable key performance indicators and financial commitments. The plan should be informed by scenario analysis to ensure that the planâs ambition is sufficient for a 1.5Â°C pathway.\n\nRenfe has committed to reach net-zero by 2050 but does not have a plan or targets against which to assess its progress. The companyâs transition plan covers both its passenger and freight operations but only extends to 2030 and lacks the financial and operational detail to provide confidence in its execution.\n\nNo evidence was found of the companyâs commitment to social dialogue or of the categories of stakeholders the company engages with on a just transition. Furthermore, no evidence was found to demonstrate the companyâs ongoing social dialogue and meaningful engagement with affected stakeholders.\n\nNo evidence was found of the company undertaking low-carbon transition planning to mitigate the social impacts of the transition on workers, affected stakeholders and its business relationships. Additionally, no evidence was found to demonstrate the companyâs engagement in social dialogue or engagement with stakeholders in its just transition planning.\n\nThe company discloses the actions it takes to create permanent jobs in the rejuvenation of its workforce. It also discloses the measures it takes to ensure that these jobs embed equality of opportunity for women and vulnerable groups. In particular, it works to create inclusive workplaces for disabled persons and has initiatives for gender equality in the workforce. However, no evidence was found of the company committing to create and support access to green and decent jobs as part of the low-carbon transition. Furthermore, no relevant disclosure was found of the companyâs assessment of employment dislocation risks.\n\nNo public commitment by the company was found stating its intention to reskill and upskill workers displaced by the transition to a low-carbon economy. Additionally, no evidence was found that the company reskills and upskills workers in a way that ensures gender balance and inclusion of vulnerable groups.\n\nNo relevant disclosure was found to show if the company identifies impacts of the low-carbon transition on social protection for workers and affected stakeholders, nor how it contributes to social protection. Additionally, no evidence was found that the company expects its business relationships to contribute to the social protection of their workers and affected stakeholders.\n\nNo relevant disclosure was found to show how the company identifies any misalignment of its lobbying activities with policies and regulations that support the just transition, nor of the measures it takes to address misalignment. Furthermore, no evidence was found that the company lobbies for policies and regulations for green and decent job creation; retention, education and reskilling; and social protection for workers.\n\nThe company discloses the proportion of its direct workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements, as well as the gender of its workforce by employee category. It also discloses how it monitors the health and safety performance of its suppliers. However, the company can strengthen its disclosure on these and other decent work issues, including living wage and working hours practices."
