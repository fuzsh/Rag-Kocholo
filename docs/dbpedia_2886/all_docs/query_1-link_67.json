        "text": "I have never travelled on Estrella but I see that it makes many stops and this may be annoying if trying to have a good night's rest.\n\nThe stops are: MADRID-CHAMARTIN,ALCALA DE HENARES,GUADALAJARA,SIGUENZA,ARCOS DE JALON,CALATAYUD,ZARAGOZA-DELICIAS,LA PUEBLA DE HIJAR,CASPE,FLIX,MORA LA NOVA,REUS,TARRAGONA,SANT VICENC DE CALDERS,BARCELONA-SANTS,GRANOLLERS CENTRE,CALDES DE MALAVELLA,GIRONA,FLACA,FIGUERES,LLANCA,PORTBOU and finally at long last after several uncomfortable hours CERBERE.\n\nIf I wanted to get to Cerbere from Madrid I think I would get to Barcelona first the cheapest way, using the RENFE booking to catch a cheap fast train (under 3 hours) then transfer to the Estacion de Franca and get one of the local trains to Cerbere taking also 3 hours ! Booking ahead I could get a â‚¬45 ticket on the fast AVE from Madrid to Barcelona in May.\n\nI don't have any knowledge of Inter Rail passes because I like to book my own tickets with the railway companies in each country and look for best routes. Sometimes I choose airlines.\n\nEstrella night train has a reputation as a slightly outdated, nothing else really. It goes on time. It is safe, it takes you from point A to point B and back. I have used Estrella train, and I have nothing to complain. Everything worked well.\n\nThank you for the replies. I mainly fear of delays, which ruin my journey plan. You say, it's not a typical problem at this train, so I will choose it.\n\nI've been said, probably it's impossible to buy Renfe supplementary ticket for IR ticket in Hungary. So, I have to buy it in Spain. Are there difficulties of getting a ticket, because of running out of seats?\n\nI will use the last, evening AVE train from Zaragoza to Madrid (tuesday), and the Estrella (thursday evening). If I can't buy the the tickets earlier, will I have a real chance to get them on the station, before the departure?"
