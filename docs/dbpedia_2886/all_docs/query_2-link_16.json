        "text": "Spain trains are a great way to get from one destination to another. In fact, Spanish trains are an increasingly cost-effective alternative to planes, particularly if you’re going a relatively short distance or if you’re traveling in the one of the high-speed long distance trains.\n\nNowadays several companies compete to offer the best train service of the country.\n\nBut which one suits better your travel plans?\n\nDo your research and compare fares! The good news is that there’s a great site for that.\n\nPurchase your train tickets online with the best booking platform.\n\nHave a look at a complete guide on how to purchase your train tickets online.\n\nBelow you can find a list of all the railway companies operating in Spain and the routes that they cover.\n\nRailway companies operating in Spain\n\nWho operates trains in Spain?\n\nThe deregulation of the railway sector has led to the different operators gaining access to the Spanish railway network. After decades of monopoly, the state-owned company Renfe Operadora competes with several private operators.\n\nHere is a list of the current railway operators in Spain:\n\nRenfe. It’s the Spanish state rail operator, which until recently operated a monopoly in Spain. It also operates through Avlo, its low-cost subsidiary.\n\nOUIGO. It’s French SNCF’s low-cost service high-speed trains, offering long-distance services on core routes of the Spanish rail network.\n\niryo. It’s operated by ILSA, which is part of a consortium made up of Spanish airline Air Nostrum, Globalvia (a Spanish multinational transport infrastructure company) and Italy’s main train operator Trenitalia.\n\nNow… You may be asking yourself, which one is better?\n\nWell, all of them are valid options. It’s just a matter of availability (as you’ll see below, Renfe still offers the widest range of routes) and price (Renfe tickets are still the most expensive ones).\n\nSo, do your research and compare fares here and there!\n\nThe good news is there’s a great site for that. And it’s my favorite place\n\nPurchase your train tickets online with the best booking platform.\n\nSpain trains: high-speed long distance routes\n\nWith a 3,100km track network the Spanish high-speed trains operate on the longest high-speed network in Europe. Running at speeds of up to 310 km/h this extensive network allows for fast connections between cities in Spain.\n\nFor example, the central hub of the high-speed long distance routes in Madrid is the train station Puerta de Atocha, although other routes depart from Chamartín train station. In Barcelona these trains depart from the Barcelona Sants train station. And in Seville, they depart from Santa Justa train station.\n\nRenfe\n\nCurrently Renfe has the following AVE routes:\n\nMadrid Atocha – Calatayud- Zaragoza – Lleida – Tarragona – Barcelona – Girona – Figueres\n\nMadrid Atocha – Guadalajara – Calatayud – Zaragoza – Tardienta – Huesca\n\nMadrid Atocha – Ciudad Real – Puertollano – Córdoba – Sevilla\n\nMadrid Atocha – Ciudad Real – Puertollano – Córdoba – Puente Genil – Antequera – Loja – Granada\n\nMadrid Atocha – Ciudad Real – Puertollano – Córdoba – Puente Genil – Antequera – Málaga\n\nMadrid Atocha – Cuenca – Requena – Valencia – Castellón\n\nMadrid Atocha – Cuenca – Albacete – Villena – Alicante – Elche – Orihuela – Murcia\n\nMadrid Chamartín – Cuenca – Requena – Valencia\n\nMadrid Chamartín – Cuenca – Albacete – Villena – Alicante\n\nMadrid Chamartín – Segovia – Valladolid – Palencia – León\n\nMadrid Chamartín – Zamora – Ourense\n\nBarcelona – Tarragona – Lleida – Zaragoza – Ciudad Real – Puertollano – Córdoba – Antequera – Granada\n\nBarcelona – Tarragona – Lleida – Zaragoza – Ciudad Real – Córdoba – Antequera – Puente Genil – Antequera – Málaga\n\nBarcelona – Tarragona – Lleida – Zaragoza – Ciudad Real – Córdoba – Sevilla\n\nValencia – Cuenca – Ciudad Real – Puertollano – Córdoba – Sevilla\n\nValencia – Requena – Cuenca – Madrid Chamartín – Valladolid – Burgos\n\nAlicante – Albacete – Cuenca – Madrid Chamartín – Zamora – Ourense\n\nAlicante – Albacete – Cuenca – Madrid Chamartín – Valladolid – Palencia – León\n\nApart from AVE trains, Avlo is Renfe’s low-cost high-speed long-distance train service operating 5 long distance routes:\n\nMadrid Atocha – Guadalajara – Calatayud – Zaragoza – Lleida – Tarragona – Barcelona – Girona – Figueres\n\nMadrid Chamartín – Cuenca – Requena – Valencia\n\nMadrid Chamartín – Cuenca – Albacete – Villena – Alicante\n\nMadrid Atocha – Ciudad Real – Puertollano – Villanueva de Córdoba – Córdoba – Sevilla\n\nMadrid Atocha – Ciudad Real – Puertollano – Villanueva de Córdoba – Córdoba – Puente Genil – Antequera Santa Ana – Málaga\n\nIn addition to this, Renfe has 2 other types of high speed trains:\n\nAvant trains travel at the same speed as AVE one, but they are designed for short trips to interconnect nearby destinations (e.g. from Madrid to Segovia, Valladolid, Córdoba, Sevilla, Toledo and from Barcelona to Zaragoza, Tarragona, Santiago, Girona).\n\nAlvia train services share the high speed lines with AVE trains, but then branch off in to conventional tracks, or continue beyond the end of the high speed lines, in order to reach their final destinations.\n\nOUIGO\n\nFrench SNCF’s low-cost high-speed OUIGO trains now operate on 3 routes:\n\nMadrid Atocha – Tarragona – Zaragoza – Barcelona\n\nMadrid Chamartín – Valencia\n\nMadrid Chamartín – Albacete – Alicante\n\nOUIGO Spain services will gradually be extended to other high-speed lines in Spain.\n\niryo\n\niryo is the brand from railway operator ILSA. The company is jointly owned by Italy’s main train operator Trenitalia, Spanish airline Air Nostrum, and the infrastructure investment fund Globalvia.\n\nIt operates on the following routes:\n\nMadrid Atocha – Tarragona – Zaragoza – Barcelona\n\nMadrid Atocha – Córdoba – Sevilla\n\nMadrid Atocha – Córdoba – Antequera – Málaga\n\nMadrid Chamartín – Cuenca – Valencia\n\nMadrid Chamartín – Cuenca – Albacete – Alicante\n\nThey are also expected to run between other destinations in the near future.\n\nSpain trains: Media Distancia routes\n\nThe Media Distancia (regional trains) and Avant trains cover the whole country and are solely operated by Renfe. These trains are also very modern and quite punctual but they are not as fast as the long distance ones.\n\nThis map shows you in detail all the routes network in Spain.\n\nThe following routes are currently available using the Avant trains:\n\nAvant Madrid – Segovia – Valladolid\n\nAvant Málaga – Córdoba – Seville\n\nAvant Madrid – Ciudad Real – Puertollano\n\nAvant Madrid – Toledo\n\nAvant Barcelona – Tarragona – Lleida\n\nAvant Calatayud – Zaragoza\n\nAvant Ourense – Santiago – A Coruña\n\nAvant Barcelona – Girona\n\nAvant Barcelona – Figueres Vilafant\n\nAvant Valencia – Requena Utiel\n\nSpain trains: Cercanías routes\n\nThe Spain trains for commuter rail services or suburban trains are called Cercanías (or Rodalies in Barcelona).\n\nOperating from many major cities, these local routes travel from main city center stations to suburbs and exurbs, and serve primarily to bring workers and students into city centers from more provincial areas. They either cover large cities (including Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Seville and Valencia) or small regions (Asturias, Murcia).\n\nThese local trains are only operated by Renfe.\n\nThe following maps show you in detail all the routes corresponding to a certain geographical area of Spain:\n\nAsturias\n\nBarcelona\n\nBilbao\n\nCádiz\n\nGirona\n\nLleida\n\nMadrid\n\nMálaga\n\nMurcia/Alicante\n\nSan Sebastián\n\nSantander\n\nSeville\n\nTarragona\n\nValencia\n\nZaragoza\n\nThis article is part of a complete tutorial about train travel in Spain where you can read all the information you need to organize your train journeys around the country.\n\nHere is a complete summary of all the guide:"
