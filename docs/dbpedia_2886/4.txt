The R17 is a line of Rodalies de Catalunya's regional rail service, operated by Renfe Operadora. It runs southwards from the Barcelona area to Port Aventura, near the seaside resort of Salou, passing through the Vallès Occidental, Baix Llobregat, Garraf, Baix Penedès, Camp de Tarragona, Baix Ebre and Montsià regions. R17 trains run primarily on the Valencia−Sant Vicenç de Calders and Madrid–Barcelona railway, using Port Aventura as their southernmost terminus, and Barcelona Estació de França as its northern one. They use the Aragó Tunnel in Barcelona, where they share tracks with Rodalies de Catalunya's Barcelona suburban lines R2, R2 Nord and R2 Sud and regional rail lines R11, R13, R14, R15 and R16, calling at Sants and Passeig de Gràcia stations,[1] while they continue to share tracks with Barcelona commuter rail service R2 Sud as far as Sant Vicenç de Calders, and with the Tarragona commuter rail service RT2 from Sant Vicenç de Calders to Port Aventura.

R17 trains started operating on 13 January 2020 ( ) after the closure of a segment of the Valencia−Sant Vicenç de Calders railway and the opening of an alternative route bypassing that segment, affecting trains running through that segment. The R16, which had previously run on that segment between Tarragona and L'Ampolla-Perelló-Deltebre, was rerouted via the new bypass. The newly created R17 took over the former segment of line R16 between Tarragona and Port Aventura stations, where the old line stops operating.
