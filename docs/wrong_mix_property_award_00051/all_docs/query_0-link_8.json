        "text": "South America is the embodiment of the human neck and head.\n\nThe South America Adam’s Apple is exactly where it should be: below the Rio de Janeiro Chin (see paragraph 1). More enormous land masses—Australia, Africa, Greenland and more—embody more Mammalian Heads and other anatomy. What this and other natural phenomena from The Big Bang and brightest comets to largest earthquakes and people’s births, deaths, and discoveries are all saying about harmony, liberty, and life in the Cosmos.\n\nEoghanÓ Súilleabháin\n\nThe magical minority lives in this magical place.\n\nBrazil—the huge country in eastern and interior South America—is the continental face with the prominent eye, nose and chin. Just below the Rio de Janeiro Chin is the Adam’s Apple at Santa Catarina, Brazil, where in 2004 the first known South Atlantic hurricane made landfall on the anniversary of North America’s largest earthquake, astronomer Fred Hoyle’s coining of “The Big Bang”, the cataclysmic 1920 tornado outbreak, and Terence MacSwiney’s birth. Terence MacSwiney’s friend—Mayor of Cork Tomás Mac Curtain—was murdered eight days before the 1920 tornado outbreak. MacSwiney became Mayor of Cork in Mac Curtain’s place.\n\nHurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple occurred exactly one year before 2005’s largest earthquake and exactly five months after the powerful X-class solar flare. It’s the exact five-month interval between Saturn’s perihelion and 2003’s deadliest earthquake—the earthquake which occurred fifty-nine days after the X-class solar flare and exactly one year before 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake killed 225,000 people. Saturn’s perihelion—its nearest point to the Sun—occurs every twenty-nine years. The exact one-year interval between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake is the same interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake.\n\nTerence MacSwiney was born exactly two weeks after Albert Einstein’s birth and one day after the death of Hércules Florence—inventor in the field of photography and coiner of the word photographie. North America’s largest earthquake occurred (Coordinated Universal Time—UTC) on Terence MacSwiney’s birthday and locally in Alaska on the anniversary of Hércules Florence’s death. The one-day interval between Hércules Florence’s death and Terence MacSwiney’s birth is the same interval between the large Virginia earthquake and the Palomar Transient Factory’s discovery of Supernova 2011fe in 2011. The exact two-week interval between Albert Einstein’s and Terence MacSwiney’s births is the interval too between William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus and Pierre Méchain’s discovery of Ursa Major’s Pinwheel Galaxy—home to Supernova 2011fe. Hércules Florence died—in Brazil—the Face of the South America Head—on the anniversary of Pierre Méchain’s Pinwheel Galaxy discovery.\n\nThe exact two-week interval between Albert Einstein’s and Terence MacSwiney’s births and between William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus and Pierre Méchain’s discovery of the Pinwheel Galaxy is the same interval between another powerful X-class solar flare and the aforementioned large Virginia earthquake—the earthquake which occurred one day before Supernova 2011fe’s discovery. X-class solar flares can occur a dozen or so times a year and this one in 2011 was the most powerful since the three X-class flares in December 2006. The Virginia earthquake—the largest U.S. earthquake in sixty-five years east of the Rocky Mountains—shook much of the eastern United States, including myself here in Massachusetts—the state whose entire east coast is the embodiment of the Human Head profile. The three powerful solar flares of December 2006 occurred within an eight-day stretch—the same eight-day interval betweenTomás Mac Curtain’s aforementioned murder and the 1920 tornado outbreak in the American South and Midwest—the tornado outbreak on the birthday of Terence MacSwiney (Tomás Mac Curtain’s Mayor of Cork replacement after his murder) and on whose anniversary Fred Hoyle coined “The Big Bang”, Hurricane Catarina made landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple, and North America’s largest earthquake and 2005’s largest earthquake occurred.\n\nFred Hoyle coined “The Big Bang” exactly three weeks before Ireland broke free from Britain and became the Republic of Ireland. On the sixth anniversary of the Irish Republic’s birth Albert Einstein died. It’s the same exact six-year interval between Cathal Goulding’s death and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake—the earthquake and horrific tsunami which followed 2003’s deadliest earthquake by exactly one year. The exact five-year interval between Cathal Goulding’s death and 2003’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between the detection of the powerful gamma-ray burst from one of the twenty-one known magnetars in our Milky Way and Mars’ perihelic opposition. In fact, the interval between the detection of gamma rays and Cathal Goulding’s death is precisely the same as that between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s deadliest earthquake: August 27th to December 26th, 1998 and 2003 respectively. On the day of Mars’ perihelic opposition Earth and Mars were closer than we’d been in 60,000 years.\n\nThe first of the three December 2006 solar flares—the last X-class flares until 2011—occurred on the birthday of virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski—inventor of the first effective live polio vaccine. On the birthday of Jonas Salk—inventor of the first successful inactivated polio vaccine—the solar flare fifty-nine days before 2003’s deadliest earthquake, twenty-six days before 2003’s total solar eclipse and exactly five months before Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple occurred. Jonas Salk died (6/23) nine days after Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir’s (Rory Gallagher) death (1995). Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir was born on my grandmother’s birthday and on the anniversary of 1933’s largest earthquake. Hilary Koprowski died onthe anniversary of Heinrich Schwabe’s death and first anniversary of 2012’s largest earthquake. Terence MacSwiney—Tomás Mac Curtain’s Mayor of Cork replacement—died on Heinrich Schwabe’s birthday. Inspired by the solar cycle studies of Schwabe, Rudolf Wolf discovered the 11-year solar cycle and the unified nature of the solar and geomagnetic cycles. My grandmother died thirty-two days before 2012’s largest earthquake. It’s the same thirty-two interval between Cathal Goulding’s birth and 1923’s largest earthquake. Goulding, of course, died exactly five and six years before 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. The exact six-year interval between Goulding’s death and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake is the same interval between the Irish Republic’s birth and Albert Einstein’s death. The exact five-year interval between Cathal Goulding’s death and 2003’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between the detection of the powerful gamma-ray burst from one of the twenty-one known magnetars in our Milky Way and Mars’ perihelic opposition. Of course, the interval between the detection of gamma rays and Cathal Goulding’s death is precisely the same as that between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s deadliest earthquake: August 27th to December 26th, 1998 and 2003 respectively. On the day of Mars’ perihelic opposition Earth and Mars were closer than we’d been in 60,000 years.\n\nThe X6.5 solar flare of December 6, 2006—the second of the three powerful solar flares that December—occurred on the anniversary of Rudolf Wolf’s death. The first of the three solar flares occurred, of course, on Hilary Koprowski’s birthday and on the eleventh anniversary of Clair Patterson’s death and on the anniversary in 2010 the Cassini spacecraft detected lightning on Saturn and discovered the Great White Spot—the enormous recurring storm in Saturn’s northern hemisphere. Clair Patterson—the geochemist who first accurately measured Earth’s age—was born exactly seven months before Cathal Goulding’s birth. The first of the three solar flares occurred, as I said, on the eleventh anniversary of Clair Patterson’s death. Patterson and my grandmother died eleven days apart and five months afterRuairí Uí Ghallchóir’s and Jonas Salk’s deaths. The exact eleven-year interval between Clair Patterson’s death and the first of the three December solar flares is the same interval between the rare Transit of Venus and Rudolf Wolf’s death. The second of the three solar flares occurred, of course, on the anniversary of Rudolf Wolf’s death.\n\nTwenty-two days before Cassini’s detection of lightning inside Saturn’s Great White Spot, astronomer Allan Sandage died. Sandage made the first accurate measurement of the Universe’s age. The exact seven-month interval between the births of Clair Patterson—the geochemist who first accurately measured Earth’s age—and Cathal Goulding is the same interval between Ken Kesey’s death and 2002’s first solar eclipse, and between Heinrich Schwabe’s death and the birth of astronomer Vesto Slipher—discoverer of the redshift proof of our universe’s expansion (1912). Ken Kesey was born on the anniversary of Vesto Slipher’s redshift discovery. Eleven days before the Saturnian storm’s detection, an earthquake occurred in Maui, Hawaii on the anniversary of the death of my grandmother—the one and only—whose tragic death came eleven days before the death of Clair Patterson—first to accurately measure Earth’s age. The island of Maui is the embodiment of the human head and torso. See it yourself. The eleven-day interval between the Maui earthquake and the Saturnian storm’s detection is, of course, the same interval between my grandmother’s and Clair Patterson’s deaths. In fact, the interval between the deaths of my grandmother and Patterson is the exact interval between the Maui earthquake and the Saturnian storm’s detection: November 24th to December 5th, 1995 and 2010 respectively.\n\nThe exact one-year interval between 2012’s largest earthquake and Hilary Koprowski’s death is the same interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, and between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. Hurricane Catarina’s landfall and 2005’s largest earthquake occurred, of course, on the anniversary of North America’s largest earthquake, Fred Hoyle’s coining of “The Big Bang”, the cataclysmic 1920 tornado outbreak and Terence MacSwiney’s birth. 2005’s largest earthquake occurred at Sumatra—the Indonesian island embodiment of the alligator and crocodile where 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake occurred. Exactly one week after Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple, United States Army specialist Casey Sheehan died in combat in Iraq. On the anniversary of Casey Sheehan’s death, Comet Panstarrs’ conjunction with the Andromeda Galaxy in 2013 occurred and the bright comet and the largest of the Local Group galaxies shone together in Earth’s sky. This galaxy-comet conjunction occurred exactly one week before the death of Hilary Koprowski—of course, the inventor of the first effective live polio vaccine who died on the anniversary of 2012’s largest earthquake and Heinrich Schwabe’s death and on whose birthday the first of the three powerful December 2006 solar flares occurred. The Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction occurred on the first anniversary of the Dallas, Texas tornado and another cosmic conjunction: Venus with The Pleiades. Eight days after the Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado, 2012’s largest earthquake occurred. Hilary Koprowski, of course, died on the first anniversary of 2012’s largest earthquake. It’s the exact one-year interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, of course, and between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. The eight-day interval betweenthe same-day Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado and 2012’s largest earthquake is the same interval between the first and last of the powerful December solar flares and between Tomás Mac Curtain’s murder and the 1920 tornado outbreak—the tornado outbreak on the birthday of Tomás Mac Curtain’s friend and his Mayor of Cork replacement: Terence MacSwiney. The exact one-week interval between the Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction and Hilary Koprowski’s death is, of course, the same interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the Adam’s Apple and Casey Sheehan’s death. The Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction of course occurred on the anniversary of Casey Sheehan’s death.\n\nThe exact nine-year interval between Casey Sheehan’s death and the Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction is the same interval between Carolyn Shoemaker’s birth and the Chicora meteor\n\ndetonation, and between the Great Meteor Procession of 1860 and magician Howard Thurston’s birth. The birth of Carolyn Shoemaker—discoverer of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9—and the Chicora meteor explosion occurred on Fred Hoyle’s birthday. The Great Meteor Procession of 1860 occurred over the northeastern United States one day after Lizzie Borden’s birth—also in the northeastern United States—and exactly eight months before the cataclysmic earthquake in Mendoza, Argentina, at the Back of the South America Throat. Carolyn Shoemaker’s discovery—Comet Shoemaker-Levy—became its own stoney firey procession before its spectacular flight into Jupiter.\n\nRight at Earth’s equator, the South America Eye is the Amazon River Delta where Earth’s largest river—the Amazon River—meets the Atlantic Ocean: the constant ocean-blue forest-green eye in the shining Sun, the perfect epitome of eye-catching. Africa also has a huge conspicuous blue eye in Lake Nam Lolwe (Lake Victoria)—also on Earth’s equator. Looking west-to-east at Africa rather than the usual south-to-north global perspective the continent is the embodiment of the horse head: the horse’s snout is South Africa while Somalia and Ethiopia is the horse’s ear. In the Ecuadoran Galapagos, at Earth’s equator too where the South America Eye and the Africa Eye are Isabela Island also embodies the horse—the seahorse. Isabela Island’s Cerro Azul Volcano erupted in 2008 on the birthday of aforementioned army specialist Casey Sheehan and John F. Kennedy, and twelve days before the eruption Kennedy’s brother Ted had his brain cancer-revealing seizure at his home in my home state Massachusetts—the state whose east coast is the embodiment of the human head profile. The human brain’s hippocampus got its name because it embodies the seahorse. The Horsehead Nebula—the embodiment of the African continent, Isabela Island, the hippocampus, and of course the horse, is near Alnitak—the triple star and one of the three Orion Belt stars in the constellation Orion.\n\nIn his study of another of the three Orion Belt stars—Mintaka—Johannes Hartmann discovered the interstellar medium – what in the darkness to our eyes looks like empty space between stellar systems is really full of dust, gas and light. Hartmann was born six days after astronomer Julio Armero’s birth and exactly two months after the birth of pioneering surgeon George Crile. The six-day interval between Julio Armero’s and Johannes Hartmann’s births is the same interval between the birth of magician Penn Jillette and the death of Alexander Fleming—discoverer of penicillin. Fleming died on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Julio Armero’s death. Penn Jillette’s partner in magic—Teller—and Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir were born seventeen days apart in the winter of 1948. George Crile—the surgical pioneer in blood transfusion and anaesthesiology—was born exactly eleven years before Vesto Slipher’s birth. It’s the same exact eleven-year interval between Clair Patterson’s death and X-class solar flare, between magician Lance Burton’s birth and my birth *see 56 days (exactly 8 weeks) arthur stoll and me, and between the 1882 Transit of Venus and Rudolf Wolf’s death. On the eleventh anniversary of Clair Patterson’s death the first of the three powerful December solar flares occurred. The second of the three solar flares occurred on the anniversary of the death of Rudolf Wolf—discoverer of the 11-year solar cycle and the unified nature of the solar and geomagnetic cycles.\n\nJulio Armero observed the total solar eclipse which occurred over his native Colombia at the back of the South America Head exactly three months before the murders of Padraig Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke. Pearse, MacDonagh, and Clarke died fighting against the British in Ireland. Julio Armero and Alexander Fleming died on Thomas Clarke’s birthday. The exact three-month interval between the total solar eclipse and the murder of Pearse, MacDonagh and Clarke is the same interval between 1923’s largest earthquake and the death of Ernst Hartwig—discoverer of the first supernova beyond this Milky Way Galaxy. In fact, the interval between the total solar eclipse and the murder of Pearse, MacDonagh and Clarke, and between 1923’s largest earthquake and Ernst Hartwig’s death is precisely the same: February 3rd to May 3rd, 1916 and 1923 respectively. The exact two-month interval between George Crile’s and Johannes Hartmann’s births is the same interval between 1970’s deadliest earthquake and largest earthquake, between 1971’s largest earthquake and my birth, and between Albert Einstein’s publication of “The foundations of the General Theory of Relativity” and the first of three tornadoes to occur on the same date in Codell, Kansas over three consecutive years. The first Codell tornado occurred seventeen days after the murders of Pearse, MacDonagh and Clarke. It’s the same seventeen-day interval, of course, between the births of Teller—of Penn and Teller—and Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir. The forty-four day interval between Albert Einstein’s publication of “The foundations of the General Theory of Relativity” and the murders of Padraig Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke is the same interval between Penn Jillette’s birth and Albert Einstein’s death, and between magician John Maskelyne’s death and Humphry Osmond’s birth. The second of the three consecutive Codell tornadoes occurred two days after John Maskelyne’s death, nine days before John Kennedy’s birth and exactly six weeks (42 days) before the birth of Humphry Osmond—coiner of the term psychedelic. Six weeks is also the exact interval between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and Humphry Osmond’s death. 2003’s deadliest earthquake occurred, of course, on the fifth anniversary of Cathal Goulding’s death and on the first anniversary of the earthquake 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake occurred. The exact five-year interval between Cathal Goulding’s death and 2003’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between the detection of the powerful gamma-ray burst from one of the twenty-one known magnetars in our Milky Way and Mars’ perihelic opposition. Of course, the interval between the detection of gamma rays and Cathal Goulding’s death is precisely the same as that between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s deadliest earthquake: August 27th to December 26th, 1998 and 2003 respectively. On the day of Mars’ perihelic opposition Earth and Mars were closer than we’d been in 60,000 years.\n\nTed Kennedy’s brain cancer-induced seizure occurred five days after 2008’s largest deadliest earthquake, fifteen days after Cyclone Nargis’s cataclysmic Myanmar landfall, eighteen days after Albert Hofmann’s death and on the birthday of Timothy Healy and chemists Edward Jenner and Vincent Barry. Like Hilary Koprowski and Jonas Salk—inventors of the polio vaccines—and Alexander Fleming—discoverer of penicillin—Edward Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine and Vincent Barry found the leprosy cure – discoveries which saved lives and cured millions of people. Cyclone Nargis’s Myanmar landfall occurred fifteen days before Ted Kennedy’s seizure and on Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s (Patrick Hillery) birthday twenty days after Ó hIrghile’s death. Nargis remained in Myanmar one day after landfall—on the anniversary of Padraig Pearse’s, Thomas MacDonagh’s and Thomas Clarke’s murders, Ernst Hartwig’s death, and magician Doug Henning’s birth. Henning and John Barlow—lyricist for the Grateful Dead, founder of the Freedom of the Press Foundation and advisory board member of the Marijuana Policy Project—were born exactly five months apart. It’s the same exact five-month interval between the powerful X-class solar flare and Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple, and between Saturn’s perihelion and 2003’s deadliest earthquake—the earthquake which occurred fifty-nine days after the solar flare, on the fifth anniversary of Cathal Goulding’s death, exactly six weeks before Humphry Osmond’s death and exactly one year before 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. Saturn’s perihelion occurs every twenty-nine years.\n\nThe fifteen-day interval between Cyclone Nargis’s Myanmar landfall and Ted Kennedy’s seizure is the same interval between the powerful X-class solar flare and Supernova 2011fe’s discovery. The solar flare occurred on the anniversary of the Grateful Dead’s Jerry Garcia’s death. The large Virginia earthquake occurred, of course, exactly two weeks after the solar flare and one day before the supernova’s discovery. The exact two-week interval between the solar flare and the Virginia earthquake is the same interval between Albert Einstein’s and Terence MacSwiney’s births, of course, and between William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus and Pierre Méchain’s discovery of Ursa Major’s Pinwheel Galaxy, and between the deadliest earthquake and the largest earthquake of 1996. 1996’s deadliest earthquake occurred on the anniversary of 1916’s aforementioned total solar eclipse and 1923’s largest earthquake. 1996’s largest earthquake occurred on the birthday of John Sullivan and magician Larry Jennings and the anniversary of the Provisional Irish Republican Army’s La Mon restaurant bombing and George Bond’s death. Magician Larry Jennings was born one day before James Corbett’s death, thirteen days before 1933’s largest earthquake, and exactly eight months before Albert Einstein’s arrival at Princeton University to live and work his remaining years. 1933’s largest earthquake—on my grandmother’s birthday and on whose anniversary Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir was born—occurred exactly five months after Ruairí Ó Brádaigh’s birth. Ó Brádaigh was born one day before the death of Max Wolf—the astronomer who shot the first photograph of the North America Nebula—the nebula in constellation Cygnus which embodies the North American continent. John Barlow was born on the anniversary of Max Wolf’s death. Barlow—lyricist for the Grateful Dead, founder of the Freedom of the Press Foundation and advisory board member of the Marijuana Policy Project—was born of course exactly five months after magician Doug Henning’s birth. It’s the same exact five-month interval between Ruairí Ó Brádaigh’s birth and 1933’s largest earthquake, between the powerful X-class solar flare and Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple, and between Saturn’s perihelion and 2003’s deadliest earthquake.\n\nGeorge Bond—the astronomer on whose anniversary of death 1996’s largest earthquake occurred—died forty-three days after Julio Armero’s birth and thirty-seven days after the birth of Johannes Hartmann—discoverer of the interstellar medium. George Bond shot the first photograph of a star. The Provisional IRA bombed La Mon restaurant eleven days after New England’s Blizzard of ’78 and thirty-two days before Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh’s (Carroll Daly) death. The eleven-day interval between the Blizzard of ’78 and the PIRA bombing is the same interval between the aforementioned Maui earthquake and the Saturnian storm’s detection, and between my grandmother’s and Clair Patterson’s deaths. The interval between the deaths of my grandmother and Patterson is the exact interval between the Maui earthquake and the Saturnian storm’s detection, of course: November 24th to December 5th, 1995 and 2010 respectively. Maui is the Hawaiian island embodiment of the human torso and head! See it! Remember it!\n\nThe forty-three day interval between Julio Armero’s birth and George Bond’s death is the same interval between Novarupta’s volcanic eruption—the 20th century’s largest eruption—and the Arizona meteor detonation which rained thousands of meteor bits onto the town of Holbrook on Lizzie Borden’s birthday. The one-day interval between magician Larry Jennings’ birth and James Corbett’s death is the same interval between the large Virginia earthquake and Supernova 2011fe’s discovery, between the death of Hércules Florence—inventor of photography and coiner of the word photographie—and Terence MacSwiney’s birth, and between Lizzie Borden’s birth in the northeastern United States and the Great Meteor Procession of 1860 over the northeastern United States. The Palomar Transient Factory found Supernova 2011fe in Pierre Méchain’s discovery—the Pinwheel Galaxy, of course—the galaxy discovered exactly two weeks after William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus. Percival Lowell—the force behind Pluto’s discovery—was born on the anniversary of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus. World heavyweight boxing champion James Corbett died one day after the birth of Larry Jennings—the magician, of course—and on the third anniversary of Clyde Tombaugh’s discovery of Pluto at Percival Lowell’s Arizona observatory.\n\nThe thirty-two day interval between the Provisional IRA bombing and Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh’s death is the same interval between Cathal Goulding’s birth and 1923’s largest earthquake, and between my grandmother’s death and 2012’s largest earthquake—the earthquake which occurred eight days after the Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado and exactly one year before Hilary Koprowski’s death. The eight-day interval between the same-day Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado and 2012’s largest earthquake is the same interval between the first and last of the powerful December solar flares (the first flare occurred on Hilary Koprowski’s birthday), and between Tomás Mac Curtain’s murder and the 1920 tornado outbreak—the tornado outbreak on the birthday of Tomás Mac Curtain’s friend and his Mayor of Cork replacement: Terence MacSwiney. The exact one-year interval between 2012’s largest earthquake and Hilary Koprowski’s death is the same interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, and between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, as well as Fred Hoyle’s coining of “The Big Bang”, North America’s largest earthquake and the 1920 tornado outbreak all occurred on Terence MacSwiney’s birthday.\n\nCyclone Nargis’s Myanmar landfall occurred exactly seven months after Dónal Céitinn’s (Dan Keating) death, twenty-seven days before Cerro Azul’s eruption, fifteen days before Ted Kennedy’s seizure, ten days before 2008’s largest deadliest earthquake, three days after Albert Hofmann’s death, and on Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s (Patrick Hillery) birthday twenty days after Ó hIrghile’s death. Dónal Céitinn and Cathal Goulding—each of the Irish Republican Army—were born on January 2nd – a date which is often Earth’s perihelion. The twenty-day interval between Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s death and Cyclone Nargis’s Myanmar landfall is the same interval between Albert Hofmann’s birth and 1906’s largest earthquake. On the birthday of Johannes Hartmann—discoverer of the interstellar medium—Albert Hofmann was born, Donald Osterbrock died, and Venus’s inferior conjunction occurred in 2014. Pádraig Ó hIrghile—one of Ireland’s early presidents—was born one day before Ernst Hartwig’s death. Hartwig and Isaac Ward discovered Supernova 1885A—the first documented discovery of a supernova beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. Johannes Hartmann—discoverer of the interstellar medium—died on Isaac Ward’s birthday. The one-day interval between Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s birth and Ernst Hartwig’s death is, of course, the same interval between the Virginia earthquake and Supernova 2011fe’s discovery, between Hércules Florence’s death and Terence MacSwiney’s birth, between Larry Jennings’ birth and James Corbett’s death, and between Lizzie Borden’s birth in the northeastern United States and the Great Meteor Procession of 1860 over the northeastern United States.\n\nOn Johannes Hartmann’s birthday, Albert Hofmann was born, Donald Osterbrock died, and Venus’s inferior conjunction occurred in 2014. Another of Venus’s inferior conjunctions, the rare Transit of Venus—Venus transiting the face of the Sun—occurred in 2012 exactly eight weeks (56 days) after 2012’s largest earthquake, the earthquake which occurred thirty-two days after my grandmother’s death, eight days after the Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado, and exactly one year before Hilary Koprowski’s death. The thirty-two day interval between my grandmother’s death and 2012’s largest earthquake is the same interval between Cathal Goulding’s birth and 1923’s largest earthquake, and between the PIRA bombing and Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh’s death. The 2012 Transit of Venus occurred on the centennial of Novarupta’s huge volcanic eruption, on the first anniversary of Comet Panstarrs’ discovery and on the anniversary of the death of Patrick Henry and birthday of Liam Mac Cosgair (William Cosgrave)—first president of the Irish Free State. Joining Liam Mac Cosgair as the Irish Free State’s first Governor-General was Timothy Healy—on whose birthday Ted Kennedy had his cancer-induced seizure. Of course, Timothy Healy was born on Edward Jenner’s birthday and on their birthday Vincent Barry was born. Jenner, Barry, Hilary Koprowski, Jonas Salk, George Crile and Alexander Fleming discovered vaccines, medicines, pioneering surgical procedures and cures for polio, smallpox, and leprosy. Percival Lowell—leader in the search for Pluto whose Lowell Observatory discovered Pluto—was born sixty-five days before Timothy Healy’s birth. It’s the same sixty-five day interval between Casey Sheehan’s death and the 2004 Transit of Venus. The 2004 Transit of Venus was the first Transit of Venus since 1882. The powerful X6.5 solar flare of December 6, 2006 occurred on the anniversary of the 1882 Transit of Venus and Rudolf Wolf died on the eleventh anniversary of that Venus transit. Of course, Rudolf Wolf discovered the 11-year solar cycle and the unified nature of the solar and geomagnetic cycles. The exact eleven-year interval between the 1882 Transit of Venus and Rudolf Wolf’s death is the same interval between magician Lance Burton’s birth and my birth, between George Crile’s and Vesto Slipher’s births, between Seán Ó Riada’s and Jerry Garcia’s births, and between Clair Patterson’s death and the first of the three powerful December 2006 solar flares. Of course, these flares were the last X-class solar flares before the Sun’s four-year period of calm. The flares in 2011—including the flare exactly two weeks before the large Virginia earthquake and fifteen days before Supernova 2011fe’s discovery—broke the calm.\n\nNovarupta’s eruption—exactly one century before the 2012 Transit of Venus, forty-three days before the Holbrook meteor detonation and thirty-eight days before Woody Guthrie’s birth—was the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. The thirty-eight day interval between Novarupta’s eruption and Woody Guthrie’s birth is the same interval between Alexander Fleming’s and Albert Einstein’s deaths. Seán Ó Riada—on whose eleventh birthday Jerry Garcia was born—died on the fourth anniversary of Woody Guthrie’s death and the anniversary of Max Wolf’s death and John Barlow’s birth. The five-day interval between Woody Guthrie’s birth and the Holbrook meteor detonation is the same interval between 2008’s largest deadliest earthquake and Ted Kennedy’s cancer-induced seizure. The exact four-year interval between Woody Guthrie’s and Seán Ó Riada’s deaths is the same interval betweenPaddy Moloney’s and Jerry Garcia’s births, between Rick Simpson’s and Rick Doblin’s births, between Rick Doblin’s birth and same-day births of Tomás Mac Giolla Bhuí’s (Thomas McElwee) and Daniel McCann, and between Dusty Springfield’s birth and Albert Hofmann’s first LSD experience. Rick Simpson discovered cannabis’s cancer curing power and Rick Doblin is the founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). Rick Simpson was born six days before Lead Belly’s death. It’s the same six-day interval between Julio Armero’s and Johannes Hartmann’s births, between Comet Shoemaker-Levy’s first and final impact with Jupiter, and between the birth of magician Penn Jillette and the death of Alexander Fleming—discoverer of penicillin. Rick Doblin was born exactly nine weeks (63 days) after Edwin Hubble’s death. It’s the same exact nine-week interval between Feargal Ó hAnnluain’s (Fergal O’Hanlon) and John Kelly’s births, and between Myron Stolaroff’s and Timothy Leary’s births.\n\nLead Belly—whose death came six days after Rick Simpson’s birth—died on the anniversary of the 1882 Transit of Venus and Rudolf Wolf’s death and on the anniversary the second of the three powerful December 2006 solar flares occurred. The 2004 and 2012 Transits of Venus are the only Transits of Venus in the 20th and 21st centuries. Comet Panstarrs—discovered exactly one year before the 2012 Transit of Venus—is the comet whose conjunction with the Andromeda Galaxy occurred on the anniversary of United States Army specialist Casey Sheehan’s death and first anniversary of the Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado. On Casey Sheehan’s, John Kennedy’s, and Patrick Henry’s birthday Cerro Azul Volcano erupted, of course, on Isabela Island—the island embodiment of the seahorse, the African continent, the Horsehead Nebula, and the hippocampus—the place in human brains involved in short-and-long-term memory and spatial navigation. Novarupta’s eruption, Liam Mac Cosgair’s birth, Comet Panstarrs’ discovery, and the 2012 Transit of Venus occurred on the anniversary of the death of Patrick Henry. Henry’s famous for giving his “Give me liberty, or give me death!” speech in the lead up to America’s Revolutionary War against England.\n\nLiam Mac Cosgair—the first president of the Irish Free State on whose birthday Novarupta’s eruption, Comet Panstarrs’ discovery and the Transit of Venus occurred—was born in Dublin one month before math prodigy Arthur Griffith’s birth in Indiana. Dubbed The Lightning Calculator, Griffith was born on the anniversary of Galileo Galilei’s discovery of Saturn’s rings and on Griffith’s birthday 1917’s deadliest earthquake occurred and my brother-in-law Christopher was born thirty days before the death of Éamon de Valera—Liam Mac Cosgair’s successor as president of the Irish Free State and later president of the Irish Republic. Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh—the Irish Republic’s fifth president—died, of course, thirty-two days after the PIRA’s restaurant bombing—the same thirty-two-day interval between Cathal Goulding’s birth and 1923’s largest earthquake, and between my grandmother’s death and 2012’s largest earthquake—the earthquake which occurred in Indonesia eight days after the Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado, exactly eight weeks (56 days) before the Transit of Venus, and exactly one year before Hilary Koprowski’s death. 1917’s deadliest earthquake occurred sixty-two days after John Kennedy’s birth and twenty-nine days after Humphry Osmond’s birth. Sixty-two days is also the interval between my grandmother’s and Pete Seeger’s births. Seeger was born on the third anniversary of the murders of Pádraig Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke, and on Seeger’s birthday Ernst Hartwig died, Doug Henning was born, and Cyclone Nargis’s cataclysmic Myanmar landfall occurred. The twenty-nine day interval between Humphry Osmond’s birth and 1917’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s largest earthquake, and between the third of the three powerful December solar flares and Donald Osterbrock’s death. Osterbrock—discoverer of our Milky Way Galaxy’s spiral arms—died on the birthday of Albert Hofmann and Johannes Hartmann—discoverer of the interstellar medium—and Venus’s inferior conjunction occurred in 2014 on the anniversary.\n\nÉamon de Valera was born fifty-three days before the 1882 Transit of Venus. The thirty-day interval between my brother-in-law’s birth and Éamon de Valera’s death is the same interval between the powerful X-class solar flare and 2012’s deadliest earthquake—the earthquake exactly four months after 2012’s largest earthquake. The powerful solar flare—thirty days before 2012’s deadliest earthquake and one month after the Transit of Venus—occurred on the anniversary of Irish president Douglas Hyde’s death. That’s four Irish presidents in two short paragraphs, plus Pádraig Ó hIrghile to make five Irish presidents. Until recently the Irish were too busy fighting against the English to elect a president; there’ve been a dozen. The exact four-month interval between 2012’s largest and deadliest earthquakes is the same interval between Denis Barry’s and Harry Atwood’s births. Atwood landed a plane on the South Lawn of the White House five months before Arthur Griffith’s death and exactly one year before Woody Guthrie’s birth and on the anniversary Jerry Rubin was born, Atwood himself died, and the powerful X-class solar flare occurred in 2000. The exact one-year interval between Atwood’s flight to the White House and Woody Guthrie’s birth is the same interval between 2012’s largest earthquake and Hilary Koprowski’s death, between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, and between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. The X-class solar flare in 2000 occurred thirty-eight days after the X-class flare on the anniversary of Patrick Henry’s death, Liam MacCosgair’s birth and Novarupta’s huge eruption, and Comet Panstarrs was discovered and the Transit of Venus occurred on the anniversary. Thirty-eight days, of course, is also the interval between Novarupta’s eruption and Woody Guthrie’s birth, and between Alexander Fleming’s and Albert Einstein’s deaths.\n\nTomás Mac Curtain — the Mayor of Cork murdered on his birthday eight days before the 1920 tornado outbreak — was born at the spring equinox and on the anniversary of the cataclysmic Mendoza earthquake in Argentina at the Back of the South America Throat—the earthquake exactly eight months after the Great Meteor Procession of 1860. Albert Einstein published his bright and novel “The foundations of the General Theory of Relativity” on Tomás Mac Curtain’s birthday thirty-five days before Ireland’s Easter Monday Rising—Ireland’s military operation against the English blight—an operation Mac Curtain supported. The Rising fighting endured for six days. It’s the same six-day interval between Julio Armero’s and Johannes Hartmann’s births, between Comet Shoemaker-Levy’s first and final impact with Jupiter, between Penn Jillette’s birth and Alexander Fleming’s death, and between Rick Simpson’s birth and Lead Belly’s death. Nine days after The Rising the leaders of the operation—aforementioned Padraig Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke—were murdered by the English. Einstein published his groundbreaking theory forty-six days after the total solar eclipse observed by Julio Armero from his native Colombia—the eclipse at the back of the South America Head exactly three months before the murders of Pearse, MacDonagh, and Clarke. The nine-day interval between Ireland’s Rising and the deaths of Pearse, MacDonagh and Clarke is the same interval between Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir’s and Jonas Salk’s aforementioned deaths, and between the second of the three consecutive Codell, Kansas tornadoes and John Kennedy’s birth.\n\nThe Argentine earthquake at the Back of the South America Throat—on whose anniversary Tomás Mac Curtain was born and was murdered—occurred exactly eight months after the Great Meteor Procession of 1860 and exactly two weeks after poet P.J. McCall’s birth. The Great Meteor Procession of 1860 occurred over the northeastern United States one day after Lizzie Borden’s birth—also in the northeastern United States. The exact two-week interval between P.J. McCall’s birth and the Argentine earthquake is the same interval between Albert Einstein’s and Terence MacSwiney’s births, between William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus and Pierre Méchain’s discovery of the Pinwheel Galaxy, between the powerful X-class solar flare and the large Virginia earthquake, and between the deadliest earthquake and the largest earthquake of 1996.Terence MacSwiney, of course, became Mayor of Cork following Tomás Mac Curtain’s murder. The solar flare exactly two weeks before the Virginia earthquake—the most powerful solar flare of the last seven years—occurred on the anniversary of 1912’s deadliest earthquake—the earthquake in Turkey sixty-four days after the eruption of Novarupta—the 20th century’s largest volcanic eruption—twenty-six days after Woody Guthrie’s birth and exactly three weeks after the Holbrook meteor detonation. The Virginia earthquake occurred one day before Supernova 2011fe’s light reached Earth from the Pinwheel Galaxy. It’s the same one-day interval, of course, between Hércules Florence’s death and Terence MacSwiney’s birth, between Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s birth and Ernst Hartwig’s death, between the first two powerful solar flares of December 2006, between Larry Jennings’ birth and James Corbett’s death, and between Lizzie Borden’s birth and the Great Meteor Procession of 1860. Hércules Florence—inventor of photography and coiner of the word photographie—died of course on the anniversary of Pierre Méchain’s discovery of the Pinwheel Galaxy—home to Supernova 2011fe. The exact three-week and twenty-six day intervals between the Holbrook meteor detonation and 1912’s deadliest earthquake and between Woody Guthrie’s birth and 1912’s deadliest earthquake is the same intervals between Fred Hoyle’s coining of “The Big Bang” and the birth of the Republic of Ireland. The twenty-six day interval between Woody Guthrie’s birth and 1912’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between the X-class solar flare and 2003’s total solar eclipse—the eclipse thirty-three days before 2003’s deadliest earthquake. Thirty-three days is also the interval between Lassen Peak’s large eruption and Fred Hoyle’s birth. The solar flare is the same flare which occurred exactly five months before Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple. It’s the same exact five-month interval, of course, between Saturn’s perihelion and 2003’s deadliest earthquake—the earthquake which occurred thirty-three days after 2003’s total solar eclipse and preceded 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake by exactly one year.\n\nThe exact three-week interval between Fred Hoyle’s coining of The Big Bang and the birth of the Irish Republic and between the Holbrook meteor detonation and 1912’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between 1915’s largest earthquake and Lassen Peak’s large eruption. Lassen Peak’s eruption occurred, of course, thirty-three days before Fred Hoyle’s birth.\n\n2012’s deadliest earthquake—thirty days after the powerful solar flare and two months after the Transit of Venus—occurred exactly four months after 2012’s largest earthquake. The interval between Denis Barry’s and Harry Atwood’s births, and between Paul Pender’s world championship boxing victory and Earth’s largest recorded earthquake is also exactly four months. Paul Pender, like John Kennedy, was born in Brookline, Massachusetts at the Nose of the Massachusetts Head. The Massachusetts Coast—my coast—is, of course, the embodiment of the human head profile. Earth’s largest recorded earthquake occurred in Chile at the Back of the South America Head on the anniversary of Lassen Peak’s large eruption.\n\nSouth America, Africa, and Massachusetts aren’t alone embodying mammalian heads. Australia is the big cat or dog head and Greenland is the wolf head. How did these huge terrestrial masses and mammalian heads become so gracefully akin? What’s it saying about life in the Cosmos and how long will this harmony be ignored?\n\nDonald Osterbrock died on Johannes Hartmann’s and Albert Hofmann’s birthday eight days after Earth’s perihelion—our closest moment to the Sun—and one day before the perihelion of Comet McNaught—the brightest comet of the last fifty years—and on the anniversary of Donald Osterbrock’s death Venus’s inferior conjunction occurred in 2014. The nine-day interval between Earth’s and Comet McNaught’s perihelions is the same interval between Ireland’s Rising and the deaths of Padraig Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke, between Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir’s and Jonas Salk’s deaths, and between the second of the three consecutive Codell, Kansas tornadoes and John Kennedy’s birth. Venus’s inferior conjunction—an event which includes the Transit of Venus—happens about every seventeen months. The one-day interval between Donald Osterbrock’s death and Comet McNaught’s perihelion is, of course, the same interval between Hércules Florence’s death and Terence MacSwiney’s birth, between Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s birth and Ernst Hartwig’s death, between the first two powerful solar flares of December 2006, between Larry Jennings’ birth and James Corbett’s death, between the large Virginia earthquake and the Palomar Transient Factory’s discovery of Supernova 2011fe in Ursa Major’s Pinwheel Galaxy, and between Lizzie Borden’s birth and the Great Meteor Procession of 1860. Donald Osterbrock, with William Morgan, discovered our Milky Way Galaxy’s spiral arms. William Morgan and the discoverer of LSD born on Johannes Hartmann’s birthday—Albert Hofmann—were born eight days apart in January 1906. Eight days is the familiar interval between Tomás Mac Curtain’s death and the 1920 tornado outbreak, between the first and final solar flares of December 2006, between the same-day Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado and 2012’s largest earthquake, and between Earth’s perihelion and Donald Osterbrock’s death. Earth’s perihelion occurred on William Morgan’s birthday. The interval between William Morgan’s and Albert Hofmann’s births is precisely the same as the interval between Earth’s perihelion and Donald Osterbrock’s death: January 3rd to January 11th, 1906 and 2007 respectively. This is the fourth instance in twenty pages that two pairs of events have occurred at exactly the same intervals. The interval between the deaths of my grandmother and Clair Patterson is the exact interval between the Maui earthquake and the Saturnian storm’s detection—November 24th to December 5th, 1995 and 2010 respectively—and the interval between 1916’s total solar eclipse and the murders of Padraig Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke, and between 1923’s largest earthquake and Ernst Hartwig’s death is precisely the same—February 3rd to May 3rd, 1916 and 1923 respectively—andthe interval between the detection of gamma rays and Cathal Goulding’s death is precisely the same as that between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s deadliest earthquake: August 27th to December 26th, 1998 and 2003 respectively.\n\nExactly four weeks after William Morgan’s birth, twenty days after Albert Hofmann’s birth, and four days before Clyde Tombaugh’s birth, one of the largest earthquakes on record rocked the Ecuadoran coast at the back of the South America Head. Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto at Percival Lowell’s observatory exactly three years before James Corbett’s death. Percival Lowell—leader in the search for Pluto—was born on the anniversary of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus and sixty-five days before Timothy Healy’s birth. It’s the same sixty-five day interval between Casey Sheehan’s death and the 2004 Transit of Venus. The exact three-year interval between Pluto’s discovery and James Corbett’s death is the same interval between Comet McNaught’s perihelion and the cataclysmic Haiti earthquake—the deadliest earthquake of the last four hundred years. Comet McNaught’s perihelion and the Haiti earthquake occurred on my grandmother’s birthday. The twenty-four day interval between Albert Hofmann’s and Clyde Tombaugh’s births is the same interval between my grandmother’s death and the same-day Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado. The Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado occurred nineteen days before the large meteor detonation over northern California, exactly one year before the Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction and exactly five months after the powerful X-class solar flare. It’s the same exact five-month interval between another X-class solar flare and Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple, and between Saturn’s perihelion and 2003’s deadliest earthquake. The nineteen-day interval between the same-day Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado and the large meteor detonation over northern California is the same interval between the cataclysmic Haiti earthquake and Howard Lotsof’s death.\n\nThe twenty-day interval between Albert Hofmann’s birth and the Ecuadoran earthquake is the same interval between Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s death and Cyclone Nargis’s cataclysmic Myanmar landfall. Landfall occurred on Ó hIrghile’s birthday. Ecuador means equator—Earth’s waist where North meets South and where Ecuador, the Galapagos Islands, the South America Eye—the Amazon River Delta—and the Africa Eye—Lake Nam Lolwe—have been for millions of years. Four days after the Ecuadoran earthquake Pluto’s discoverer Clyde Tombaugh was born 190 miles west of “The Lightning Calculator” Arthur Griffith’s Milford, Indiana birthplace. Clyde Tombaugh was born in Streator, Illinois where an F2 tornado touched down in 2010 on the anniversary of Roy Sullivan’s sixth lightning strike. Arthur Griffith, known as the lightning calculator with regards to his math skills, was born one month after Liam Mac Cosgair’s birth and on the anniversary of Galileo’s discovery of Saturn’s rings, of course, and on his birthday my brother-in-law Christopher was born and 1917’s deadliest earthquake occurred. 1917’s deadliest earthquake occurred sixty-two days after John Kennedy’s birth and twenty-nine days after Humphry Osmond’s birth. Sixty-two days is also the interval between my grandmother’s and Pete Seeger’s births. Seeger was born on the third anniversary of the murders of Pádraig Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke, and on Seeger’s birthday Ernst Hartwig died, Doug Henning was born, and Cyclone Nargis’s cataclysmic Myanmar landfall occurred. The twenty-nine day interval between Humphry Osmond’s birth and 1917’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s largest earthquake, and between the third of the three powerful December solar flares and Donald Osterbrock’s death. The four-day interval between the Ecuadoran earthquake and Clyde Tombaugh’s birth is the same interval between Supernova 2011fe’s discovery and Hurricane Irene’s landfall here in Massachusetts, and between my grandmother’s birth and P.J. McCall’s death. McCall—the poet and songwriter—was born, of course, exactly two weeks before the cataclysmic Argentine earthquake at the Back of the South America Throat—the earthquake which occurred exactly eight months after the Great Meteor Procession of 1860 and on whose anniversary Tomás Mac Curtain was born and was murdered. The exact two-week interval between PJ McCall’s birth and the Argentine earthquake is the same interval between Albert Einstein’s and Terence MacSwiney’s births, between William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus and Pierre Méchain’s discovery of the Pinwheel Galaxy, between the powerful X-class solar flare and the large Virginia earthquake, and between the deadliest earthquake and the largest earthquake of 1996. The Pinwheel Galaxy is home, of course, to Supernova 2011fe—the Type Ia supernova of a binary stellar system. Supernovae are touchstone events in the progression towards intelligent life.\n\nThe largest earthquake of 1996 occurred on John Sullivan’s and Larry Jennings’ birthday and the anniversary of George Bond’s death and the PIRA restaurant bombing. The deadliest earthquake of 1996 occurred on the anniversary of 1916’s total solar eclipse and 1923’s largest earthquake. John Sullivan was born thirty-five days before the death of botanist and linguist Olof Rudbeck. It’s the same thirty-five day interval between Einstein’s publication of his “The foundations of the General Theory of Relativity” (on Tomás Mac Curtain’s birthday) and Ireland’s Easter Monday Rising, between Patrick Hillery’s death and Ted Kennedy’s cancer-induced seizure, between Ted Kennedy’s death and 2009’s largest earthquake, and between 2010’s largest earthquake and the powerful solar flare and enormous coronal mass ejection (CME). The CME swept over Earth two days later (on 4/5). On the second and third anniversary of the solar flare the same-day Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado occurred and the Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction occurred. The CME arrived at Earth on the birthday of surgeon Joseph Lister—founder of antiseptic medicine. The two-day interval between the solar flare and the CME’s arrival at Earth is the same interval between Anthony Wesley’s recording of the asteroid impact with Jupiter and the F2 tornado in Pluto discoverer Clyde Tombaugh’s birthplace, and between Ernst Chladni’s death and Joseph Lister’s birth. Chladni first proposed the now-known extraterrestrial origin of meteorites. The tornado in Clyde Tombaugh’s birthplace occurred on the anniversary of Roy Sullivan’s sixth lightning strike. Lightning—which struck Sullivan on seven occasions—struck Sullivan his sixth time twenty days before the cataclysmic 1976 earthquake in Papua—where 1996’s largest earthquake occurred a few degrees south of the equator—and on the first anniversary of the ’76 Papua earthquake lightning struck Sullivan again for the seventh and final time. Sullivan was born three days before Joseph Lister’s death. It’s the same three-day interval between Albert Hofmann’s death and Cyclone Nargis’s cataclysmic Myanmar landfall. My niece was born on the anniversary of the ’76 Papua earthquake and Sullivan’s final lightning strike, seventeen days after the 2004 Transit of Venus, and exactly nine months after 2003’s largest earthquake. The seventeen-day interval between the Transit of Venus and my niece’s birth is the same interval between 2008’s largest deadliest earthquake and Cerro Azul’s eruption on Isabela Island—the eruption on Casey Sheehan’s, John Kennedy’s and Patrick Henry’s birthday. The 20-day interval between Roy Sullivan’s sixth lightning strike and the Papua earthquake is the same interval between Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s death and Cyclone Nargis’s cataclysmic Myanmar landfall, and between Albert Hofmann’s birth and the huge Ecuadoran earthquake. Four months before Roy Sullivan’s 6th lightning strike and the Papua earthquake, one of the deadliest earthquakes in history occurred in Guatemala on Clyde Tombaugh’s birthday. The huge Ecuadoran earthquake occurred, of course, four days before Clyde Tombaugh’s birth. On the anniversary of the Guatemala earthquake and Tombaugh’s birth, one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded—1965’s largest earthquake—occurred in Alaska nine months before Liam Mac Cosgair’s death and exactly two months before actor Robert Downey, Jr.’s birth. Liam Mac Cosgair—the first president of the Irish Free State on whose birthday Novarupta’s eruption, Comet Panstarrs’ discovery, the Transit of Venus and the 2000 X-class solar flare occurred—died the same day magician Harry Blackstone died. Blackstone was born thirty-eight days after Ernst Hartwig’s Supernova 1885A discovery and on Blackstone’s birthday in 2013 magician John Calvert died. The thirty-eight day interval between Ernst Hartwig’s Supernova 1885A discovery and Harry Blackstone’s birth is the same interval between the two X-class solar flares of 2000, between Novarupta’s eruption and Woody Guthrie’s birth, and between Alexander Fleming’s and Albert Einstein’s deaths. The second of the two solar flares of 2000 occurred on Woody Guthrie’s and Jerry Rubin’s birthday and the anniversary of Harry Atwood’s\n\nWhite House plane landing and Atwood’s death. The exact one-year interval between Atwood’s flight to the White House and Woody Guthrie’s birth is the same interval between 2012’s largest earthquake and Hilary Koprowski’s death, between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake, and between the cataclysmic Papua earthquake and Roy Sullivan’s 7th lightning strike.\n\nThe exact two-month interval between 1965’s largest earthquake and Robert Downey’s birth is the same interval between James Jeans’s death and Terence McKenna’s birth. Mathematician James Jeans conceived Steady State cosmology: the theory at the heels of Big Bang cosmology. Liam Mac Cosgair—of course, the first president of the Irish Free State—and Harry Blackstone died on Terence McKenna’s nineteenth birthday. McKenna was—like Albert Hofmann—a psychedelics expert and McKenna was born on the anniversary of Albert Hofmann’s LSD discovery. McKenna died on the anniversary of the death of Ernst Chladni—the first person to propose the now-known extraterrestrial origin of meteorites—and on the anniversary of their deaths the powerful solar flare sent the huge CME towards Earth, the Dallas tornado and the Venus-Pleiades conjunction, and the Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction occurred. The exact two-year interval between the solar flare and the same-day Dallas tornado and Venus-Pleiades conjunction is the same interval between 1995’s deadliest earthquake and Clyde Tombaugh’s death, between the X-class solar flare and 2013’s deadliest earthquake, between the 2011 tornado outbreak and Swift’s detection of GRB 130427A, between the X2.6 solar flare and Comet McNaught’s perigee, and between the Great Comet of 1996’s perigee and 1998’s largest earthquake. The exact three-year interval between the solar flare and the Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction is the same interval between Comet McNaught’s perihelion and the cataclysmic Haiti earthquake.\n\n2012’s largest earthquake—exactly four months before the year’s deadliest earthquake—and Hilary Koprowski’s death occurred on the anniversary of the cataclysmic Midwest tornado outbreak which happened exactly one week after Robert Downey’s birth. Downey, the famous actor, was born of course exactly two months after 1965’s largest earthquake. The exact one-week interval between Robert Downey’s birth and the Midwest tornado outbreak is the same interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and Casey Sheehan’s death, of course, and between the Comet Panstarrs-Andromeda Galaxy conjunction and Hilary Koprowski’s death. Casey Sheehan was killed and the Comet Panstarrs-Andromeda Galaxy conjunction occurred on Robert Downey’s birthday. The Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction, the Dallas tornado and the Venus-Pleiades conjunction occurred on the anniversary of Terence McKenna’s death. The Midwest tornado outbreak—exactly one week after Robert Downey’s birth—occurred in Arthur Griffith’s, John Calvert’s, Clyde Tombaugh’s, Harry Blackstone’s and Donald Osterbrock’s respective home states of Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio.\n\nThree months after 2012’s largest earthquake and exactly one month after the Transit of Venus, another powerful bright X-class solar flare occurred on the anniversary of the Johnstown Meteorite fall in Colorado—the meteorite which fell exactly one week before the birth of Donald Osterbrock—discoverer of our Milky Way Galaxy’s spiral arms. The one-week interval between the Johnstown Meteorite fall and Donald Osterbrock’s birth is of course the exact interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and Casey Sheehan’s death, between the Comet Panstarrs-Andromeda Galaxy conjunction and Hilary Koprowski’s death, and between Robert Downey’s birth and the Midwest tornado outbreak. Hilary Koprowski, remember, invented the first effective live polio vaccine. Venus’s inferior conjunction—an event which includes the Transit of Venus and happens about every seventeen months—occurred in 2014 on the anniversary of Donald Osterbrock’s death and Albert Hofmann’s and Johannes Hartmann’s births. Casey Sheehan died sixty-five days before the 2004 Transit of Venus, of course. It’s the same sixty-five-day interval between Percival Lowell’s and Timothy Healy’s births. Percival Lowell—born on the anniversary of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus—pushed for the discovery of Pluto and it was at his Lowell Observatory that Clyde Tombaugh discovered the planet.Ted Kennedy’s cancer-induced seizure occurred on the birthday of Timothy Healy, Edward Jenner, and Vincent Barry. Like Hilary Koprowski, Jonas Salk, George Crile, Alexander Fleming, and Rick Simpson, Edward Jenner and Vincent Barry discovered vaccines, medicines, pioneering surgical procedures and prevented and cured diseases: polio, smallpox, and leprosy. Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine and Barry found the leprosy cure—discoveries which saved lives and cured millions of people. Rick Simpson—whose discovery of cannabis’s cancer-curing power is also saving people—was born on the birthday of physicist Ernst Chladni—the first person to propose the now-known extraterrestrial origin of meteorites. Terence McKenna’s death, the Comet Panstarrs-Andromeda Galaxy conjunction, the Dallas tornado and the Venus-Pleiades conjunction occurred on the anniversary of Ernst Chladni’s death. On Rick Simpson’s fourth birthday, Rick Doblin—founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)—was born. It’s the same exact four-year interval between Woody Guthrie’s and Seán Ó Riada’s deaths, between Paddy Moloney’s and Jerry Garcia’s births, between Rick Doblin’s birth and same-day births of Tomás Mac Giolla Bhuí’s (Thomas McElwee) and Daniel McCann, and between Dusty Springfield’s birth and Albert Hofmann’s first LSD experience. Rick Simpson was born six days before Lead Belly’s death. It’s the same six-day interval between Julio Armero’s and Johannes Hartmann’s births, between Comet Shoemaker-Levy’s first and final impact with Jupiter, and between the birth of magician Penn Jillette and the death of Alexander Fleming—discoverer of penicillin.\n\nErnst Chladni—the first person to propose the now-known extraterrestrial origin of meteorites—died exactly five months before John Drew’s birth. It’s the same exact five-month interval between the powerful X-class solar flare and the same-day Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado, between another X-class solar flare and Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple, between Saturn’s perihelion and 2003’s deadliest earthquake, and between Swift’s detection of (gamma-ray burst) GRB 130427A and magician John Calvert’s death. Calvert died, of course, on fellow magician Harry Blackstone’s birthday. The gamma-ray burst’s light traveled four billion light-years to reach Earth on the second anniversary of the deadliest American tornado outbreak of the last ninety years. Three days after the tornado outbreak six consecutive days of earthquakes began in eastern Maine and eighteen days after the tornado outbreak an earthquake occurred in Cape Cod—the peninsular Jawline of the Massachusetts Head. The three-day interval between the tornado outbreak and the first day of Maine earthquakes is the same interval between Albert Hofmann’s death and Cyclone Nargis’s cataclysmic Myanmar landfall, between Roy Sullivan’s birth and Joseph Lister’s death, between the perihelion and perigee of Comet McNaught—the brightest comet of the last fifty years—and between 2013’s deadliest earthquake and magician John Calvert’s death. Calvert, of course, died on fellow magician Harry Blackstone’s birthday and exactly five months after Swift’s detection of GRB 130427A. The exact six-day interval between the first and final Eastern Maine earthquakes is the same interval between Rick Simpson’s birth and Lead Belly’s death, between Julio Armero’s and Johannes Hartmann’s births, between Comet Shoemaker-Levy’s first and final impact with Jupiter, and between the birth of magician Penn Jillette and the death of Alexander Fleming—discoverer of penicillin.\n\n2013’s deadliest earthquake—three days before magician John Calvert’s death—occurred on the second anniversary of the powerful X1.9 solar flare—the last of four X-class solar flares which occurred over eighteen days in September 2011. The eighteen-day interval between first and last of the September 2011 solar flares and between the 2011 tornado outbreak and Cape Cod earthquake is the same interval between Albert Hofmann’s death and Ted Kennedy’s cancer-induced seizure at his Cape Cod home. The exact two-year interval between the solar flare and 2013’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between the 2011 tornado outbreak and Swift’s detection of GRB 130427A, between 1995’s deadliest earthquake and Clyde Tombaugh’s death, between the X2.6 solar flare and Comet McNaught’s perigee, between the Great Comet of 1996’s perigee and 1998’s largest earthquake, and between the solar flare and Earth-directed CME and the same-day Dallas tornado and Venus-Pleiades conjunction. The 2011 tornado outbreak occurred exactly seven months before Terry Lovejoy’s discovery of Comet Lovejoy—among the brightest comets of the last hundred years. It’s the same exact seven-month interval between Comet McNaught’s perigee and 2007’s deadliest earthquake, and between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and Jimmy McLarnin’s death. Jimmy McLarnin died on the first anniversary of the X17 solar flare—the now-familiar flare which occurred exactly five months before Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple. The exact one-year interval between the solar flare and Jimmy McLarnin’s death is the same interval between Harry Atwood’s flight to the White House and Woody Guthrie’s birth, between 2012’s largest earthquake and Hilary Koprowski’s death, between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, and between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. 2007’s deadliest earthquake—exactly seven months after Comet McNaught’s perigee—occurred in Peru at the Back of the South America Head on the anniversary of 1950’s largest earthquake and Julia Child’s birth. 1950’s largest earthquake occurred twenty-nine days before Sara Allgood’s death. It’s the same twenty-nine day interval between Humphry Osmond’s birth and 1917’s deadliest earthquake, between the third of the three powerful December solar flares and Donald Osterbrock’s death, and between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s largest earthquake. On the day of Mars’ perihelic opposition Earth and Mars were closer, of course, than we’d been in 60,000 years.\n\nJulia Child was born exactly ten weeks after Novarupta’s huge eruption—the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. It’s the same exact ten-week interval between Adam Clayton’s birth and Earth’s largest recorded earthquake, between 2007’s deadliest earthquake and Comet Holmes’s flare up, and between the X3.8 solar flare (1/17) and 2005’s largest earthquake. Adam Clayton—bassist for the rock band U2—was born on the anniversary of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus, Percival Lowell’s birth, Robert Innes’s death and on the thirtieth anniversary of Clyde Tombaugh’s announcement of his discovery of Pluto. It’s the same exact thirty-year interval between the Great Comet of 1882’s perihelion and Vesto Slipher’s discovery of redshift proof of the Universe’s expansion, between the Bombay Cyclone’s landfall in Bombay, India and Novarupta’s eruption, between Edwin Hubble’s and Roy Sullivan’s deaths, and between 1953’s deadliest earthquake and 1983’s largest earthquake. The three-month interval between the Bombay Cyclone’s landfall and the Great Comet of 1882’s perihelion is the exact same three-month interval between Novarupta’s eruption and Vesto Slipher’s discovery: June 6th to September 17th, 1882 and 1912 respectively. The six-month interval between 1953’s deadliest earthquake and Edwin Hubble’s death is the exact same six-month interval between 1983’s largest earthquake and Roy Sullivan’s death: March 18th to September 28th, 1953 and 1983 respectively. These are the fifth and sixth instances in these first thirty pages that two pairs of events have occurred at exactly the same intervals. The interval between William Morgan’s and Albert Hofmann’s births is precisely the same as the interval between Earth’s perihelion and Donald Osterbrock’s death: January 3rd to January 11th, 1906 and 2007 respectively. The interval between the deaths of my grandmother and Clair Patterson is the exact interval between the Maui earthquake and the Saturnian storm’s detection—November 24th to December 5th, 1995 and 2010 respectively—and the interval between 1916’s total solar eclipse and the murders of Padraig Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke, and between 1923’s largest earthquake and Ernst Hartwig’s death is precisely the same—February 3rd to May 3rd, 1916 and 1923 respectively—and the interval between the detection of gamma rays and Cathal Goulding’s death is precisely the same as that between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s deadliest earthquake: August 27th to December 26th, 1998 and 2003 respectively.\n\nand so on\n\nSouth America is the embodiment of the human neck and head.\n\nThe South America Adam’s Apple is exactly where it should be: below the Rio de Janeiro Chin (see paragraph 1). More enormous land masses—Australia, Africa, Greenland and more—embody more Mammalian Heads and other anatomy. What this and other natural phenomena from The Big Bang and brightest comets to largest earthquakes and people’s births, deaths, and discoveries are all saying about harmony, liberty, and life in the Cosmos.\n\nEoghanÓ Súilleabháin\n\nThe magical minority lives in this magical place.\n\nBrazil—the huge country in eastern and interior South America—is the continental face with the prominent eye, nose and chin. Just below the Rio de Janeiro Chin is the Adam’s Apple at Santa Catarina, Brazil, where in 2004 the first known South Atlantic hurricane made landfall on the anniversary of North America’s largest earthquake, astronomer Fred Hoyle’s coining of “The Big Bang”, the cataclysmic 1920 tornado outbreak, and Terence MacSwiney’s birth. Terence MacSwiney’s friend—Mayor of Cork Tomás Mac Curtain—was murdered eight days before the 1920 tornado outbreak. MacSwiney became Mayor of Cork in Mac Curtain’s place.\n\nHurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple occurred exactly one year before 2005’s largest earthquake and exactly five months after the powerful X-class solar flare. It’s the exact five-month interval between Saturn’s perihelion and 2003’s deadliest earthquake—the earthquake which occurred fifty-nine days after the X-class solar flare and exactly one year before 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake killed 225,000 people. Saturn’s perihelion—its nearest point to the Sun—occurs every twenty-nine years. The exact one-year interval between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake is the same interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake.\n\nTerence MacSwiney was born exactly two weeks after Albert Einstein’s birth and one day after the death of Hércules Florence—inventor in the field of photography and coiner of the word photographie. North America’s largest earthquake occurred (Coordinated Universal Time—UTC) on Terence MacSwiney’s birthday and locally in Alaska on the anniversary of Hércules Florence’s death. The one-day interval between Hércules Florence’s death and Terence MacSwiney’s birth is the same interval between the large Virginia earthquake and the Palomar Transient Factory’s discovery of Supernova 2011fe in 2011. The exact two-week interval between Albert Einstein’s and Terence MacSwiney’s births is the interval too between William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus and Pierre Méchain’s discovery of Ursa Major’s Pinwheel Galaxy—home to Supernova 2011fe. Hércules Florence died—in Brazil—the Face of the South America Head—on the anniversary of Pierre Méchain’s Pinwheel Galaxy discovery.\n\nThe exact two-week interval between Albert Einstein’s and Terence MacSwiney’s births and between William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus and Pierre Méchain’s discovery of the Pinwheel Galaxy is the same interval between another powerful X-class solar flare and the aforementioned large Virginia earthquake—the earthquake which occurred one day before Supernova 2011fe’s discovery. X-class solar flares can occur a dozen or so times a year and this one in 2011 was the most powerful since the three X-class flares in December 2006. The Virginia earthquake—the largest U.S. earthquake in sixty-five years east of the Rocky Mountains—shook much of the eastern United States, including myself here in Massachusetts—the state whose entire east coast is the embodiment of the Human Head profile. The three powerful solar flares of December 2006 occurred within an eight-day stretch—the same eight-day interval betweenTomás Mac Curtain’s aforementioned murder and the 1920 tornado outbreak in the American South and Midwest—the tornado outbreak on the birthday of Terence MacSwiney (Tomás Mac Curtain’s Mayor of Cork replacement after his murder) and on whose anniversary Fred Hoyle coined “The Big Bang”, Hurricane Catarina made landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple, and North America’s largest earthquake and 2005’s largest earthquake occurred.\n\nFred Hoyle coined “The Big Bang” exactly three weeks before Ireland broke free from Britain and became the Republic of Ireland. On the sixth anniversary of the Irish Republic’s birth Albert Einstein died. It’s the same exact six-year interval between Cathal Goulding’s death and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake—the earthquake and horrific tsunami which followed 2003’s deadliest earthquake by exactly one year. The exact five-year interval between Cathal Goulding’s death and 2003’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between the detection of the powerful gamma-ray burst from one of the twenty-one known magnetars in our Milky Way and Mars’ perihelic opposition. In fact, the interval between the detection of gamma rays and Cathal Goulding’s death is precisely the same as that between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s deadliest earthquake: August 27th to December 26th, 1998 and 2003 respectively. On the day of Mars’ perihelic opposition Earth and Mars were closer than we’d been in 60,000 years.\n\nThe first of the three December 2006 solar flares—the last X-class flares until 2011—occurred on the birthday of virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski—inventor of the first effective live polio vaccine. On the birthday of Jonas Salk—inventor of the first successful inactivated polio vaccine—the solar flare fifty-nine days before 2003’s deadliest earthquake, twenty-six days before 2003’s total solar eclipse and exactly five months before Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple occurred. Jonas Salk died (6/23) nine days after Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir’s (Rory Gallagher) death (1995). Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir was born on my grandmother’s birthday and on the anniversary of 1933’s largest earthquake. Hilary Koprowski died onthe anniversary of Heinrich Schwabe’s death and first anniversary of 2012’s largest earthquake. Terence MacSwiney—Tomás Mac Curtain’s Mayor of Cork replacement—died on Heinrich Schwabe’s birthday. Inspired by the solar cycle studies of Schwabe, Rudolf Wolf discovered the 11-year solar cycle and the unified nature of the solar and geomagnetic cycles. My grandmother died thirty-two days before 2012’s largest earthquake. It’s the same thirty-two interval between Cathal Goulding’s birth and 1923’s largest earthquake. Goulding, of course, died exactly five and six years before 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. The exact six-year interval between Goulding’s death and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake is the same interval between the Irish Republic’s birth and Albert Einstein’s death. The exact five-year interval between Cathal Goulding’s death and 2003’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between the detection of the powerful gamma-ray burst from one of the twenty-one known magnetars in our Milky Way and Mars’ perihelic opposition. Of course, the interval between the detection of gamma rays and Cathal Goulding’s death is precisely the same as that between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s deadliest earthquake: August 27th to December 26th, 1998 and 2003 respectively. On the day of Mars’ perihelic opposition Earth and Mars were closer than we’d been in 60,000 years.\n\nThe X6.5 solar flare of December 6, 2006—the second of the three powerful solar flares that December—occurred on the anniversary of Rudolf Wolf’s death. The first of the three solar flares occurred, of course, on Hilary Koprowski’s birthday and on the eleventh anniversary of Clair Patterson’s death and on the anniversary in 2010 the Cassini spacecraft detected lightning on Saturn and discovered the Great White Spot—the enormous recurring storm in Saturn’s northern hemisphere. Clair Patterson—the geochemist who first accurately measured Earth’s age—was born exactly seven months before Cathal Goulding’s birth. The first of the three solar flares occurred, as I said, on the eleventh anniversary of Clair Patterson’s death. Patterson and my grandmother died eleven days apart and five months afterRuairí Uí Ghallchóir’s and Jonas Salk’s deaths. The exact eleven-year interval between Clair Patterson’s death and the first of the three December solar flares is the same interval between the rare Transit of Venus and Rudolf Wolf’s death. The second of the three solar flares occurred, of course, on the anniversary of Rudolf Wolf’s death.\n\nTwenty-two days before Cassini’s detection of lightning inside Saturn’s Great White Spot, astronomer Allan Sandage died. Sandage made the first accurate measurement of the Universe’s age. The exact seven-month interval between the births of Clair Patterson—the geochemist who first accurately measured Earth’s age—and Cathal Goulding is the same interval between Ken Kesey’s death and 2002’s first solar eclipse, and between Heinrich Schwabe’s death and the birth of astronomer Vesto Slipher—discoverer of the redshift proof of our universe’s expansion (1912). Ken Kesey was born on the anniversary of Vesto Slipher’s redshift discovery. Eleven days before the Saturnian storm’s detection, an earthquake occurred in Maui, Hawaii on the anniversary of the death of my grandmother—the one and only—whose tragic death came eleven days before the death of Clair Patterson—first to accurately measure Earth’s age. The island of Maui is the embodiment of the human head and torso. See it yourself. The eleven-day interval between the Maui earthquake and the Saturnian storm’s detection is, of course, the same interval between my grandmother’s and Clair Patterson’s deaths. In fact, the interval between the deaths of my grandmother and Patterson is the exact interval between the Maui earthquake and the Saturnian storm’s detection: November 24th to December 5th, 1995 and 2010 respectively.\n\nThe exact one-year interval between 2012’s largest earthquake and Hilary Koprowski’s death is the same interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, and between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. Hurricane Catarina’s landfall and 2005’s largest earthquake occurred, of course, on the anniversary of North America’s largest earthquake, Fred Hoyle’s coining of “The Big Bang”, the cataclysmic 1920 tornado outbreak and Terence MacSwiney’s birth. 2005’s largest earthquake occurred at Sumatra—the Indonesian island embodiment of the alligator and crocodile where 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake occurred. Exactly one week after Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple, United States Army specialist Casey Sheehan died in combat in Iraq. On the anniversary of Casey Sheehan’s death, Comet Panstarrs’ conjunction with the Andromeda Galaxy in 2013 occurred and the bright comet and the largest of the Local Group galaxies shone together in Earth’s sky. This galaxy-comet conjunction occurred exactly one week before the death of Hilary Koprowski—of course, the inventor of the first effective live polio vaccine who died on the anniversary of 2012’s largest earthquake and Heinrich Schwabe’s death and on whose birthday the first of the three powerful December 2006 solar flares occurred. The Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction occurred on the first anniversary of the Dallas, Texas tornado and another cosmic conjunction: Venus with The Pleiades. Eight days after the Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado, 2012’s largest earthquake occurred. Hilary Koprowski, of course, died on the first anniversary of 2012’s largest earthquake. It’s the exact one-year interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, of course, and between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. The eight-day interval betweenthe same-day Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado and 2012’s largest earthquake is the same interval between the first and last of the powerful December solar flares and between Tomás Mac Curtain’s murder and the 1920 tornado outbreak—the tornado outbreak on the birthday of Tomás Mac Curtain’s friend and his Mayor of Cork replacement: Terence MacSwiney. The exact one-week interval between the Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction and Hilary Koprowski’s death is, of course, the same interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the Adam’s Apple and Casey Sheehan’s death. The Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction of course occurred on the anniversary of Casey Sheehan’s death.\n\nThe exact nine-year interval between Casey Sheehan’s death and the Andromeda Galaxy-Comet Panstarrs conjunction is the same interval between Carolyn Shoemaker’s birth and the Chicora meteor\n\ndetonation, and between the Great Meteor Procession of 1860 and magician Howard Thurston’s birth. The birth of Carolyn Shoemaker—discoverer of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9—and the Chicora meteor explosion occurred on Fred Hoyle’s birthday. The Great Meteor Procession of 1860 occurred over the northeastern United States one day after Lizzie Borden’s birth—also in the northeastern United States—and exactly eight months before the cataclysmic earthquake in Mendoza, Argentina, at the Back of the South America Throat. Carolyn Shoemaker’s discovery—Comet Shoemaker-Levy—became its own stoney firey procession before its spectacular flight into Jupiter.\n\nRight at Earth’s equator, the South America Eye is the Amazon River Delta where Earth’s largest river—the Amazon River—meets the Atlantic Ocean: the constant ocean-blue forest-green eye in the shining Sun, the perfect epitome of eye-catching. Africa also has a huge conspicuous blue eye in Lake Nam Lolwe (Lake Victoria)—also on Earth’s equator. Looking west-to-east at Africa rather than the usual south-to-north global perspective the continent is the embodiment of the horse head: the horse’s snout is South Africa while Somalia and Ethiopia is the horse’s ear. In the Ecuadoran Galapagos, at Earth’s equator too where the South America Eye and the Africa Eye are Isabela Island also embodies the horse—the seahorse. Isabela Island’s Cerro Azul Volcano erupted in 2008 on the birthday of aforementioned army specialist Casey Sheehan and John F. Kennedy, and twelve days before the eruption Kennedy’s brother Ted had his brain cancer-revealing seizure at his home in my home state Massachusetts—the state whose east coast is the embodiment of the human head profile. The human brain’s hippocampus got its name because it embodies the seahorse. The Horsehead Nebula—the embodiment of the African continent, Isabela Island, the hippocampus, and of course the horse, is near Alnitak—the triple star and one of the three Orion Belt stars in the constellation Orion.\n\nIn his study of another of the three Orion Belt stars—Mintaka—Johannes Hartmann discovered the interstellar medium – what in the darkness to our eyes looks like empty space between stellar systems is really full of dust, gas and light. Hartmann was born six days after astronomer Julio Armero’s birth and exactly two months after the birth of pioneering surgeon George Crile. The six-day interval between Julio Armero’s and Johannes Hartmann’s births is the same interval between the birth of magician Penn Jillette and the death of Alexander Fleming—discoverer of penicillin. Fleming died on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Julio Armero’s death. Penn Jillette’s partner in magic—Teller—and Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir were born seventeen days apart in the winter of 1948. George Crile—the surgical pioneer in blood transfusion and anaesthesiology—was born exactly eleven years before Vesto Slipher’s birth. It’s the same exact eleven-year interval between Clair Patterson’s death and X-class solar flare, between magician Lance Burton’s birth and my birth *see 56 days (exactly 8 weeks) arthur stoll and me, and between the 1882 Transit of Venus and Rudolf Wolf’s death. On the eleventh anniversary of Clair Patterson’s death the first of the three powerful December solar flares occurred. The second of the three solar flares occurred on the anniversary of the death of Rudolf Wolf—discoverer of the 11-year solar cycle and the unified nature of the solar and geomagnetic cycles.\n\nJulio Armero observed the total solar eclipse which occurred over his native Colombia at the back of the South America Head exactly three months before the murders of Padraig Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke. Pearse, MacDonagh, and Clarke died fighting against the British in Ireland. Julio Armero and Alexander Fleming died on Thomas Clarke’s birthday. The exact three-month interval between the total solar eclipse and the murder of Pearse, MacDonagh and Clarke is the same interval between 1923’s largest earthquake and the death of Ernst Hartwig—discoverer of the first supernova beyond this Milky Way Galaxy. In fact, the interval between the total solar eclipse and the murder of Pearse, MacDonagh and Clarke, and between 1923’s largest earthquake and Ernst Hartwig’s death is precisely the same: February 3rd to May 3rd, 1916 and 1923 respectively. The exact two-month interval between George Crile’s and Johannes Hartmann’s births is the same interval between 1970’s deadliest earthquake and largest earthquake, between 1971’s largest earthquake and my birth, and between Albert Einstein’s publication of “The foundations of the General Theory of Relativity” and the first of three tornadoes to occur on the same date in Codell, Kansas over three consecutive years. The first Codell tornado occurred seventeen days after the murders of Pearse, MacDonagh and Clarke. It’s the same seventeen-day interval, of course, between the births of Teller—of Penn and Teller—and Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir. The forty-four day interval between Albert Einstein’s publication of “The foundations of the General Theory of Relativity” and the murders of Padraig Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Thomas Clarke is the same interval between Penn Jillette’s birth and Albert Einstein’s death, and between magician John Maskelyne’s death and Humphry Osmond’s birth. The second of the three consecutive Codell tornadoes occurred two days after John Maskelyne’s death, nine days before John Kennedy’s birth and exactly six weeks (42 days) before the birth of Humphry Osmond—coiner of the term psychedelic. Six weeks is also the exact interval between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and Humphry Osmond’s death. 2003’s deadliest earthquake occurred, of course, on the fifth anniversary of Cathal Goulding’s death and on the first anniversary of the earthquake 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake occurred. The exact five-year interval between Cathal Goulding’s death and 2003’s deadliest earthquake is the same interval between the detection of the powerful gamma-ray burst from one of the twenty-one known magnetars in our Milky Way and Mars’ perihelic opposition. Of course, the interval between the detection of gamma rays and Cathal Goulding’s death is precisely the same as that between Mars’ perihelic opposition and 2003’s deadliest earthquake: August 27th to December 26th, 1998 and 2003 respectively. On the day of Mars’ perihelic opposition Earth and Mars were closer than we’d been in 60,000 years.\n\nTed Kennedy’s brain cancer-induced seizure occurred five days after 2008’s largest deadliest earthquake, fifteen days after Cyclone Nargis’s cataclysmic Myanmar landfall, eighteen days after Albert Hofmann’s death and on the birthday of Timothy Healy and chemists Edward Jenner and Vincent Barry. Like Hilary Koprowski and Jonas Salk—inventors of the polio vaccines—and Alexander Fleming—discoverer of penicillin—Edward Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine and Vincent Barry found the leprosy cure – discoveries which saved lives and cured millions of people. Cyclone Nargis’s Myanmar landfall occurred fifteen days before Ted Kennedy’s seizure and on Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s (Patrick Hillery) birthday twenty days after Ó hIrghile’s death. Nargis remained in Myanmar one day after landfall—on the anniversary of Padraig Pearse’s, Thomas MacDonagh’s and Thomas Clarke’s murders, Ernst Hartwig’s death, and magician Doug Henning’s birth. Henning and John Barlow—lyricist for the Grateful Dead, founder of the Freedom of the Press Foundation and advisory board member of the Marijuana Policy Project—were born exactly five months apart. It’s the same exact five-month interval between the powerful X-class solar flare and Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple, and between Saturn’s perihelion and 2003’s deadliest earthquake—the earthquake which occurred fifty-nine days after the solar flare, on the fifth anniversary of Cathal Goulding’s death, exactly six weeks before Humphry Osmond’s death and exactly one year before 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. Saturn’s perihelion occurs every twenty-nine years.\n\nThe fifteen-day interval between Cyclone Nargis’s Myanmar landfall and Ted Kennedy’s seizure is the same interval between the powerful X-class solar flare and Supernova 2011fe’s discovery. The solar flare occurred on the anniversary of the Grateful Dead’s Jerry Garcia’s death. The large Virginia earthquake occurred, of course, exactly two weeks after the solar flare and one day before the supernova’s discovery. The exact two-week interval between the solar flare and the Virginia earthquake is the same interval between Albert Einstein’s and Terence MacSwiney’s births, of course, and between William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus and Pierre Méchain’s discovery of Ursa Major’s Pinwheel Galaxy, and between the deadliest earthquake and the largest earthquake of 1996. 1996’s deadliest earthquake occurred on the anniversary of 1916’s aforementioned total solar eclipse and 1923’s largest earthquake. 1996’s largest earthquake occurred on the birthday of John Sullivan and magician Larry Jennings and the anniversary of the Provisional Irish Republican Army’s La Mon restaurant bombing and George Bond’s death. Magician Larry Jennings was born one day before James Corbett’s death, thirteen days before 1933’s largest earthquake, and exactly eight months before Albert Einstein’s arrival at Princeton University to live and work his remaining years. 1933’s largest earthquake—on my grandmother’s birthday and on whose anniversary Ruairí Uí Ghallchóir was born—occurred exactly five months after Ruairí Ó Brádaigh’s birth. Ó Brádaigh was born one day before the death of Max Wolf—the astronomer who shot the first photograph of the North America Nebula—the nebula in constellation Cygnus which embodies the North American continent. John Barlow was born on the anniversary of Max Wolf’s death. Barlow—lyricist for the Grateful Dead, founder of the Freedom of the Press Foundation and advisory board member of the Marijuana Policy Project—was born of course exactly five months after magician Doug Henning’s birth. It’s the same exact five-month interval between Ruairí Ó Brádaigh’s birth and 1933’s largest earthquake, between the powerful X-class solar flare and Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple, and between Saturn’s perihelion and 2003’s deadliest earthquake.\n\nGeorge Bond—the astronomer on whose anniversary of death 1996’s largest earthquake occurred—died forty-three days after Julio Armero’s birth and thirty-seven days after the birth of Johannes Hartmann—discoverer of the interstellar medium. George Bond shot the first photograph of a star. The Provisional IRA bombed La Mon restaurant eleven days after New England’s Blizzard of ’78 and thirty-two days before Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh’s (Carroll Daly) death. The eleven-day interval between the Blizzard of ’78 and the PIRA bombing is the same interval between the aforementioned Maui earthquake and the Saturnian storm’s detection, and between my grandmother’s and Clair Patterson’s deaths. The interval between the deaths of my grandmother and Patterson is the exact interval between the Maui earthquake and the Saturnian storm’s detection, of course: November 24th to December 5th, 1995 and 2010 respectively. Maui is the Hawaiian island embodiment of the human torso and head! See it! Remember it!\n\nThe forty-three day interval between Julio Armero’s birth and George Bond’s death is the same interval between Novarupta’s volcanic eruption—the 20th century’s largest eruption—and the Arizona meteor detonation which rained thousands of meteor bits onto the town of Holbrook on Lizzie Borden’s birthday. The one-day interval between magician Larry Jennings’ birth and James Corbett’s death is the same interval between the large Virginia earthquake and Supernova 2011fe’s discovery, between the death of Hércules Florence—inventor of photography and coiner of the word photographie—and Terence MacSwiney’s birth, and between Lizzie Borden’s birth in the northeastern United States and the Great Meteor Procession of 1860 over the northeastern United States. The Palomar Transient Factory found Supernova 2011fe in Pierre Méchain’s discovery—the Pinwheel Galaxy, of course—the galaxy discovered exactly two weeks after William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus. Percival Lowell—the force behind Pluto’s discovery—was born on the anniversary of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus. World heavyweight boxing champion James Corbett died one day after the birth of Larry Jennings—the magician, of course—and on the third anniversary of Clyde Tombaugh’s discovery of Pluto at Percival Lowell’s Arizona observatory.\n\nThe thirty-two day interval between the Provisional IRA bombing and Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh’s death is the same interval between Cathal Goulding’s birth and 1923’s largest earthquake, and between my grandmother’s death and 2012’s largest earthquake—the earthquake which occurred eight days after the Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado and exactly one year before Hilary Koprowski’s death. The eight-day interval between the same-day Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado and 2012’s largest earthquake is the same interval between the first and last of the powerful December solar flares (the first flare occurred on Hilary Koprowski’s birthday), and between Tomás Mac Curtain’s murder and the 1920 tornado outbreak—the tornado outbreak on the birthday of Tomás Mac Curtain’s friend and his Mayor of Cork replacement: Terence MacSwiney. The exact one-year interval between 2012’s largest earthquake and Hilary Koprowski’s death is the same interval between Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, and between 2003’s deadliest earthquake and 2004’s largest deadliest earthquake. Hurricane Catarina’s landfall at the South America Adam’s Apple and 2005’s largest earthquake, as well as Fred Hoyle’s coining of “The Big Bang”, North America’s largest earthquake and the 1920 tornado outbreak all occurred on Terence MacSwiney’s birthday.\n\nCyclone Nargis’s Myanmar landfall occurred exactly seven months after Dónal Céitinn’s (Dan Keating) death, twenty-seven days before Cerro Azul’s eruption, fifteen days before Ted Kennedy’s seizure, ten days before 2008’s largest deadliest earthquake, three days after Albert Hofmann’s death, and on Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s (Patrick Hillery) birthday twenty days after Ó hIrghile’s death. Dónal Céitinn and Cathal Goulding—each of the Irish Republican Army—were born on January 2nd – a date which is often Earth’s perihelion. The twenty-day interval between Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s death and Cyclone Nargis’s Myanmar landfall is the same interval between Albert Hofmann’s birth and 1906’s largest earthquake. On the birthday of Johannes Hartmann—discoverer of the interstellar medium—Albert Hofmann was born, Donald Osterbrock died, and Venus’s inferior conjunction occurred in 2014. Pádraig Ó hIrghile—one of Ireland’s early presidents—was born one day before Ernst Hartwig’s death. Hartwig and Isaac Ward discovered Supernova 1885A—the first documented discovery of a supernova beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. Johannes Hartmann—discoverer of the interstellar medium—died on Isaac Ward’s birthday. The one-day interval between Pádraig Ó hIrghile’s birth and Ernst Hartwig’s death is, of course, the same interval between the Virginia earthquake and Supernova 2011fe’s discovery, between Hércules Florence’s death and Terence MacSwiney’s birth, between Larry Jennings’ birth and James Corbett’s death, and between Lizzie Borden’s birth in the northeastern United States and the Great Meteor Procession of 1860 over the northeastern United States.\n\nOn Johannes Hartmann’s birthday, Albert Hofmann was born, Donald Osterbrock died, and Venus’s inferior conjunction occurred in 2014. Another of Venus’s inferior conjunctions, the rare Transit of Venus—Venus transiting the face of the Sun—occurred in 2012 exactly eight weeks (56 days) after 2012’s largest earthquake, the earthquake which occurred thirty-two days after my grandmother’s death, eight days after the Venus-Pleiades conjunction and Dallas tornado, and exactly one year before Hilary Koprowski’s death. The thirty-two day interval between my grandmother’s death and 2012’s largest earthquake is the same interval between Cathal Goulding’s birth and 1923’s largest earthquake, and between the PIRA bombing and Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh’s death. The 2012 Transit of Venus occurred on the centennial of Novarupta’s huge volcanic eruption, on the first anniversary of Comet Panstarrs’ discovery and on the anniversary of the death of Patrick Henry and birthday of Liam Mac Cosgair (William Cosgrave)—f"
