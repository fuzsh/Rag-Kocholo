Learn about the details of how Howard Hughes pulled the wool over the eyes of the public and lived his last 25 years with the woman he loved, finally dying in Nov. 2001.\n\nMark Musick retired from the military in 2008 at the rank of Major General. In 2002 Mark met Eva McLelland who told him a secret which she had not divulged to anyone. Her story consisted of the ingredients of fabulous wealth, a reclusive man unable to escape his famous life, assistance from the CIA providing an alternate identity, and a loving wife who knew how to keep a secret.\n\nProgram includes free admission to the museum.\n\nMembers, please enter the code you received via email for 50% off your ticket.
