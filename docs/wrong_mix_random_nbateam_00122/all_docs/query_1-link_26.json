        "text": "HOUSTON, TX — The Howard Hughes Corporation is pleased to announce that its Houston area communities — The Woodlands, its newest community The Woodlands Hills, and Bridgeland, northwest Houston’s premier community — exceeded their goals and raised record funds for local charities during its Spring Giving Campaign. It was during this time that The Howard Hughes Corporation pledged to donate $1,000 for each home purchased. Donations were made on behalf of buyers to one of the following five charities of their choosing: Montgomery County Community Foundation, YES to Youth, Cy-Hope, Cy-Fair Educational Foundation, and Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nSince its inception, The Howard Hughes Corporation has been an active philanthropist throughout the Greater Houston region, donating annually to over 130 local nonprofit organizations. Community-focused philanthropy is a guiding principle in the company’s corporate social responsibility program, HHCares, and the company prides itself on supporting charities and causes in and around Bridgeland, The Woodlands, The Woodlands Hills, and across the country.\n\nBy providing new homebuyers with the opportunity to select which charity they wish to donate, The Howard Hughes Corporation was able to share the power of giving with residents and the greater community of Montgomery County and Cypress. As two of the fastest growing areas of Houston including some of Texas’ largest school districts, the area is experiencing rapid growth. Howard Hughes recognizes that both Montgomery County and Cypress’ most vulnerable communities will need additional resources in the future and pledges to support long-term.\n\nIn Montgomery County, local charities YES to Youth and the Montgomery County Community Foundation (MCCF) aim to use their funds for purposes both educational and administrative. YES to Youth’s Chief Executive Officer Dannette Suding states, “We are so honored that The Howard Hughes Corporation selected YES to Youth as a beneficiary of their program this year. With this gift, we can ensure that at least 108 children and their families receive mental health counseling for an entire year – at absolutely no cost! This will allow kids to access valuable services to help prevent family conflict, to help kids be successful in school, and to prevent self-harm.” Additionally, she says that YES to Youth will also be able to provide additional safe shelter to abused, neglected, sex-trafficked, homeless, and runaway youth in the area.\n\nMeanwhile, MCCF will be using the donation to help those at risk of becoming homeless; additional funds will help families with children financially, increasing stability and reducing the chance that children will be disrupted at home or at school. MCCF will also provide more career-pathing classes for adults to learn new skills with the hope of securing a new job. These efforts will assist countless individuals and families across Montgomery County and promote the general well-being of residents of all ages. “With Montgomery County’s rapid growth, we know that there will be a greater need for social services to help out those less fortunate,” says Heath Melton, Senior Vice President of MPC Residential for The Howard Hughes Corporation. “Working with YES to Youth and MCCF was an easy decision for us because of their proven success and grassroots efforts.”\n\nWithin Cypress, Bridgeland has built an existing partnership with Cy-Hope through its annual, heavily-attended Nature Fest, and with Cy-Fair Educational Foundation (CFEF) through scholarships and sponsor support. Cy-Hope is a local organization dedicated to bringing hope and opportunity to every child in the Cy-Fair area, while CFEF seeks to raise funds to increase college access for graduates and instructional support for teachers of Cy-Fair ISD. “The engagement in the Spring Giving Campaign was incredible this year, and we’re so proud to be helping our communities from the ground up,” says Melton.\n\nDonations made to these local charities will provide sustained support for their efforts. Holly Calbat, head of Donor Relations at Cy-Hope, says, “Cy-Hope is extremely grateful to Howard Hughes for all we have received and for the exposure of our efforts to Bridgeland’s newest residents!” To date, donations to Cy-Hope will help to provide over 1,000 dual credit financial assistance awards, run a Cy-Hope Hope Center for a year and a half, sponsor 34 Dierkers Champs Baseball teams for one season, and sponsor 535 students to participate in one year of Cy-Hope’s mentoring program.\n\nAdditionally, funds donated to Bridgeland’s other area recipient – CFEF – will benefit a variety of causes. Through Bridgeland’s existing endowment with CFEF, it helps to give scholarships to graduating seniors in Cy-Fair ISD as they prepare for higher education. Part of Bridgeland’s donation will also help fund a new CFEF initiative that supports a dual-credit program offered by Cy-Fair ISD, allowing students to take college-accredited courses while still in high school. While dual-credit courses typically carry an additional cost, Bridgeland’s donation will make these more financially accessible. Fewer costs due to higher education equate to less student debt for many graduates, a burden Bridgeland hopes to lessen. 2019 marks the 50th year that CFEF will give out scholarships and financial assistance for educational benefits, and Bridgeland hopes to continue helping such an important charity.\n\nLastly, the charity uniting the Spring Giving Campaign across three Howard Hughes communities — The Woodlands, The Woodlands Hills and Bridgeland — was the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), a charity which helps to support research for blood cancer cures and improves the quality of life for both patients and families. The Howard Hughes Corporation’s donation will have an immense and life-changing impact on affected families. This year’s donation will help to fund one year of critical research on CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell immunotherapy. This therapy is a groundbreaking treatment approach that seeks to genetically reconstitute a patient’s own immune cells to attack and inhibit cancer cells.\n\nUltimately, philanthropy and community involvement are core tenets of The Howard Hughes Corporation’s guiding philosophy. Melton says, “The Spring Giving Campaign was a great success that we hope brings lasting impact. We look forward to future philanthropic initiatives within our community.” Learn more about The Woodlands, The Woodlands Hills and Bridgeland, developments of The Howard Hughes Corporation, at www.TheWoodlands.com, www.TheWoodlandsHills.com, or www.Bridgeland.com.\n\nThe Woodlands is a 28,000-acre master planned community located 27 miles north of downtown Houston.
