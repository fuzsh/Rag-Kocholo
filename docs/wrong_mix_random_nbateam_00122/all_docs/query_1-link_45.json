        "text": "The Howard Hughes Corporation, the community developer for Downtown Columbia, has established a scholarship in honor of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, creator of the “1619 Project” for The New York Times Magazine.\n\nThe $10,000 Nikole Hannah-Jones Scholarship will be presented to two Black or African American seniors attending Howard County public high schools who have been accepted to attend college. Each year, two $5,000 scholarships will be awarded. Howard Hughes Corporation created the scholarship in partnership with the Community Foundation of Howard County, who will administer the awards under the umbrella of the foundation’s scholarship program.\n\n“Nikole Hannah-Jones is a ground-breaking journalist and inspiring leader. Establishing a scholarship in her name recognizes her accomplishments and her example as a torch bearer for the values of equity and justice,” said Greg Fitchitt, President, Columbia, for The Howard Hughes Corporation.\n\nThe Community Foundation of Howard County will evaluate all applications for the scholarship and will select awardees based on community service involvement and other activities, letters of recommendation and transcript. Financial need will be considered but is not required for selection. Applicants are also asked to submit a short essay responding to the question, “What should racial justice look like in America?”\n\n“We’re so pleased to work with Howard Hughes Corporation to help establish the Nikole Hannah-Jones Scholarship,” said Beverly White-Seals, president and CEO of the Community Foundation of Howard County. “Howard Hughes Corporation is a great partner, and we applaud its continued support of education and young people. This scholarship exemplifies how our corporate community can make a tangible difference in Howard County. As one of our largest annual scholarship awards, the Nikole Hannah-Jones Scholarship will provide educational opportunities to deserving students every year.”\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones is an investigative journalist covering racial injustice and is known for her coverage of civil rights in the United States. She recently joined Howard University’s School of Communications as the Knight Chair of Race and Journalism. She was the featured headliner at the 2021 Books in Bloom book festival presented by the Downtown Columbia Partnership in Color Burst Park in Merriweather District last October.\n\nThe Nikole Hannah-Jones Scholarship will be awarded annually, and awardees for their freshman year may re-apply for their sophomore, junior and senior years, so long as they remain enrolled and in good standing.\n\nScholarship applications for the Nikole Hannah-Jones Scholarship are due March 28.
