        "text": "By Adam Hadhazy\n\nClifford Brangwynne, whose research explores the hidden order within cellular liquid, has been named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.\n\nBrangwynne, an associate professor of chemical and biological engineering at Princeton University, is one of 19 new investigators named by the institute this year. The distinction is one of the most sought-after awards in biomedical research.\n\nA nonprofit medical research organization headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland, HHMI provides roughly $8 million over a seven-year period for researchers, who remain based at their home institutions, pursuing cutting-edge science. This innovative approach affords researchers time to concentrate on their work and not have to continually seek short-term grants."
