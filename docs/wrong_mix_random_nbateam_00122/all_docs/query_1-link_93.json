        "text": "Early on, they established an important principle: The entity would be a “steady operating organization with its own laboratories and not a general program of giving money away.”\n\nLate in 1953, Hughes created the medical institute that bears his name and decided to fund its work through the profits of the Hughes Aircraft Company. In signing the documents to create HHMI on December 17, 1953, Hughes pursued a characteristically bold course of action: He wished to create an institute committed to basic research, to probe into “the genesis of life itself.” The HHMI charter states:\n\nThe primary purpose and objective of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute shall be the promotion of human knowledge within the field of the basic sciences (principally the field of medical research and medical education) and the effective application thereof for the benefit of mankind.\n\nHughes’s decision would have powerful consequences for biomedical research. After the establishment of the Institute, a select group of advisors to Hughes charted the fields of biomedical research to be supported by HHMI.\n\nWhen Hughes died in 1976, he was the sole trustee of HHMI. In the aftermath of Hughes’s death, the Delaware Court of Chancery in 1984 appointed a group of charter trustees to assume responsibility for the Institute. The charter trustees—George W. Thorn, Hanna H. Gray, Helen K. Copley, Donald S. Fredrickson (who also served as the Institute’s first president), Frank William Gay, James H. Gilliam Jr., William R. Lummis, and Irving S. Shapiro—made the critical decision in 1985 to sell the Institute’s sole asset, the Hughes Aircraft Company, to create a more flexible endowment for the support of biomedical research. During the process of selling the company, the trustees reaffirmed the Institute’s status as a medical research organization (MRO) and thereby declined to transform it into a private foundation.\n\nBy 1984, HHMI scientists focused on four areas of research—cell biology, genetics, immunology, and neuroscience—with a fifth, structural biology, being added in 1986. During its first three decades, the Institute also established the relationship with its researchers that has proved singularly productive. The Institute employs Hughes investigators, but they conduct their research in the laboratories of their host institutions, allowing for a cross-fertilization of ideas and people that has ramifications throughout the biomedical sciences.\n\nThe sale of the Hughes Aircraft Company established the Institute’s net worth, which in turn determined the amount that HHMI must spend each year on research. The trustees expanded the HHMI Investigator Program beyond a small number of institutions. That same year, the trustees elected Purnell W. Choppin as the Institute’s president. Both events were critical and set the stage for an extraordinary period of growth and change. The Institute decided, among other initiatives, to make a major investment in structural biology, to help with the initial funding for the sequencing of the human genome, and to create a separate grants program.\n\nSee Website:"
