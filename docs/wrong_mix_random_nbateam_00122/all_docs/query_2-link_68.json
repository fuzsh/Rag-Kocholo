        "text": "Dear Friends of the Educational Foundation,\n\nThe world has changed in ways none of us could have anticipated. Every day, the coronavirus pandemic impacts how we live our lives and brings new and unique challenges for many - including Howard Community College students. With the move to remote learning and services, some of their needs are even greater now than when they were on campus.\n\nAs we all struggle to learn how to live within our new reality, students who normally work to pay for school and daily living expenses may not be able to under the current conditions. Furloughs, layoffs, and uncertainty have now put them at risk for financial insecurity, and even some with food insecurity. Each of us can make a positive impact on these students' lives. With a gift of support through the Howard Community College Educational Foundation (HCCEF), you can help make a difference.\n\nThe HCCEF has created several COVID-19 Response Funds to assist students during this critical time. Remote learning has placed an unexpected burden on our students who do not have current technology at home to successfully implement online courses. Our COVID-19 Response Fund provides aid for purchasing this technology and also allows for scholarship needs if a student's current financial aid did not cover all of their course costs. The COVID-19 Response Helping Hands Fund allows students to receive assistance with food purchases since they can no longer access HCC's on-campus food pantry or participate in the food voucher program through the cafeteria. This fund also provides monetary assistance for unforeseen costs with other daily living expenses such as increased bills for additional data coverage, car repairs, transportation costs, etc.\n\nBe the best kind of \"influencer,\" a donor. To provide immediate assistance, make a gift online . If you are supporting one of our upcoming special events as a sponsor, we can modify your sponsorship dollars to support one of the COVID-19 Response Funds. With your support, no student will be forced to choose between their education and their daily needs.\n\nFor more information about any of our programs, please contact the HCC Educational Foundation staff at foundation@howardcc.edu or 443-518-1970. Thank you for your consideration, and stay safe.\n\nMissy\n\nFeeding the future for HCC students\n\nAs a graduate student in South Carolina, Rajiv Jain struggled to pay for food and cook nutritious meals. So when the technology leader and his wife, Hima, heard about HCC's desire to address food insecurities on campus, they immediately offered their financial support. The new \"Fueling Dragons Program,\" made possible because of the couple's generosity, gives low-income students access to healthy food, cooking classes and educational materials.\n\nRead more about the Jains' efforts.\n\nFinding support for life on and off campus\n\nJobless and homeless, Arlette thought she may never complete her education or achieve her dream of becoming a diagnostic medical sonographer. But out of despair she found hope, thanks to HCC's Career Links - a program that supports single parents and displaced homemakers. Now back on track to complete her studies, Arlette says Career Links and the scholarships she received helped her leave her stressful life behind and work toward a new goal: offering mobile ultrasound services to the less fortunate.\n\nRead more about Arlette's journey.\n\nValuing education and community\n\nFor more than 15 years, the Howard Hughes Corporation has supported the HCC Educational Foundation through events and scholarships. While it may seem like the neighborly thing to do, given the corporation is right down the street from HCC's campus, there's a deeper reason for the long-time support: The corporation values education. HCC provides pathways to success for thousands of students each year, says Greg Fitchett, Howard Hughes Corporation's regional president.\n\nRead more about this community partnership."
