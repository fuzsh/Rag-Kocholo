        "text": "The Society's Awards Program was initiated in 1944 and over the years has paid tribute to the world's outstanding leaders in industry, government and academia. The number of awards presented annually has grown steadily, as has the prestige and importance associated with them. The Vertical Flight Society Awards Program acts as a catalyst for stimulating technological advances in vertical flight aircraft. The Annual Grand Awards Banquet is a highlight of the Society's Annual Forum & Technology Display.\n\nPlease consider nominating a colleague or organization for one of our awards. Hundreds of Vertical Flight Society members have been recognized over our 80-year history. Annual nominations and endorsements are due no later than Feb. 16, 2024 at 11:59 pm EST (UTC-5)!\n\nClick on the links below to find out more about each award and for a list of past honored awardees:\n\nLeonardo International Fellowship Award\n\nThe Leonardo International Fellowship Award is given for significant contributions to international vertical flight cooperation.

The Award honors the memory of a young helicopter engineer, Swiss citizen, author and rescue pilot who founded the VFS Student Chapter at the University of Michigan. At 20 years of age, he published a treatise on helicopter aerodynamics. Subsequently, he developed instrument flight rules (IFR) procedures for rotorcraft in Europe, and as a commercial pilot, he performed more than 300 helicopter rescue missions.\n\nAwardees\n\nGrover E.

It honors the memory of an outstanding helicopter test pilot and an exemplary person. The award consists of a stipend ($250), the engraving of the recipient’s name on a plaque, and an individual plaque.\n\nAwardees\n\nPaul E. Haueter Award\n\nThe Paul E. Haueter Award was instituted in 1966 and is given for an outstanding technical contribution to the field of vertical take-off and landing aircraft development other than a helicopter or an operational vertical flight aircraft. The award honors an aeronautical engineer, devoted public servant, and VFS officer who was instrumental in fostering the early development of VTOL aircraft in the United States.\n\nAwardees\n\nHonorary Fellows\n\nThe title of Honorary Fellow is granted to highly distinguished Society members who have made exceptional leadership, innovative or other meritorious contributions that have significantly advanced Vertical Flight Society and the vertical flight community during their career. The granting of Honorary Fellows is in perpetuity, and a certificate and life membership in the Society is given to each Honorary Fellow elected. No more than two such awards are given in any single year.\n\nAwardees\n\nHoward Hughes Award\n\nThe Howard Hughes Award is given for an outstanding improvement in fundamental vertical flight technology brought to fruition during the preceding 18 months. The award is intended to foster accomplishments in the basic science and technology disciplines of the vertical flight community, such as aerodynamics, dynamics, structures, propulsion, human factors, electronics, simulation, testing and systems integration. The award was established in 1977 by Hughes Helicopters to honor the memory of Howard Hughes and his pioneering accomplishments in aviation.\n\nAwardees\n\nHarry T. Jensen Award\n\nSince 1986, the Society has given the Harry T. Jensen Award for an outstanding contribution to the improvement of vertical flight aircraft reliability, maintainability, and/or safety through improved design brought to fruition during the preceding year. Established by Sikorsky Aircraft, the award honors Harry Jensen’s contributions to enhance helicopter qualification, structural reliability and safety.\n\nAwardees\n\nDr. Alexander Klemin Award\n\nCreated in 1951 by industry pioneer Frank Piasecki, the Klemin Award is the highest honor the VFS bestows on an individual for notable achievement in advancing the field of vertical flight aeronautics. The award honors the memory of an eminent aeronautical engineer, educator, author, and outstanding pioneer in rotary wing aeronautics.\n\nAwardees\n\nCaptain William J. Kossler, USCG Award\n\nThe Kossler Award, established in 1951, is given for the greatest achievement in the practical application or operation of a vertical flight aircraft, the value of which has been demonstrated by actual service during the preceding year. The award honors the memory of a US Coast Guard airman, aeronautical engineer, and early advocate of helicopters in search and rescue operations.\n\nAwardees\n\nAlexander A. Nikolsky Honorary Lectureship\n\nGiven to an individual who has a highly distinguished career in vertical flight aircraft research and development, and is skilled at communicating their technical knowledge and experience, for whom a summary of their original work represents a valuable reference publication.\n\nAwardees\n\nRobert L. Pinckney Award\n\nThe Robert L. Pinckney Award is given for a notable achievement in manufacturing research and development for vertical flight aircraft or components brought to fruition in the preceding year. The Award was created by Boeing in 1995 to honor the memory of Robert L. Pinckney, an eminent manufacturing engineer.\n\nAwardees\n\nJohn J.
