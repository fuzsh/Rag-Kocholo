HHMI supports the research of Rockefeller faculty who have HHMI appointments with funding for salaries, supplies, equipment and laboratory personnel, including postdoctoral associates, technicians and administrative assistants. HHMI investigators and early career scientists maintain their faculty appointments at the university and pursue their research in HHMI laboratories on campus. There are currently 15 HHMI investigators and one HHMI early career scientist at Rockefeller, many of whom are active in the education of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.\n\nFor more information visit the Howard Hughes Medical Institute"
