        "text": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute\n\nHHMI is a science philanthropy whose mission is to advance biomedical research and science education for the benefit of humanity.\n\nTo learn more about HHMI, visit: www.hhmi.org\n\nIn 2009, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute announced that it would expand collaborations with various foundations, including The Helen Hay Whitney Foundation, in order to increase support for outstanding postdoctoral researchers. HHMI now provides each organization with support for up to six postdoctoral fellows a year. For more information about this program, visit: HHMI News.\n\nThe Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) is one of the world’s largest philanthropies, with laboratories across the United States and grants programs throughout the world. The Institute is a nonprofit medical research organization that employs hundreds of leading biomedical scientists working at the forefront of their fields. HHMI investigators work in Hughes laboratories at more than 60 universities, medical centers, and other research institutions throughout the United States. In a complementary program at HHMI’s Janelia Research Campus in Loudoun County, Virginia, leading scientists are pursuing long-term, high-risk, high-reward research in a campus specially designed to bring together researchers from disparate disciplines. In addition, through its grants program and other activities, HHMI is helping to enhance science education at all levels and maintain the vigor of biomedical science worldwide. Its headquarters are\n\nlocated in Chevy Chase, Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C.\n\n2023 HHMI-HHWF Fellowship Recipients\n\nNipun S.
