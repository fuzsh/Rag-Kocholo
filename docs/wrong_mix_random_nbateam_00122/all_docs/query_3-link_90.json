        "text": "Christmas came early at the Sun 'n Fun Air Museum.\n\nAnd this time the part of Santa Claus was played by the spirit of Howard Hughes.\n\nHughes, the billionaire flyboy who once soared around the globe in less than four days, was a great collector of aviation memorabilia.\n\nSun 'n Fun officials on Monday were the giddy recipients of 180 crates and boxes full of Hughes' well-preserved keepsakes.\n\n\"That's a pretty big name to hit Lakeland,\" said museum general manager Arthur Henderson. \"We were very fortunate in receiving this.\"\n\nThe Sun 'n Fun Aviation Foundation beat out such heavyweight competition as UCLA and the University of Southern California for the Hughes collection.\n\nVernon Olson, senior vice president of Howard Hughes Corp., told Henderson he liked the Sun 'n Fun Aviation Foundation's offer to put the collection on public display.\n\nThe take included:\n\nScale models of three of Hughes' most famous airplanes: the Spruce Goose, the Hughes H-1 racer and the XF-11 fighter plane that Hughes crashed during a flight test.\n\nRacing trophies Hughes won in speed competitions, including one from the Miami Air Races in 1934.\n\nOriginal flight maps Hughes used during his record-breaking flight around the world in 1938.\n\nScrapbooks of news clippings covering Hughes' aviation exploits over the decades.\n\nDozens of black-and-white photographs of Hughes and his planes .\n\nHenderson said most of the artifacts will be kept in storage, but he hopes to have a Hughes exhibit ready by early November when Sun 'n Fun hosts its annual Wings and Things event.\n\n_ Information from the Associated Press was used in this report."
