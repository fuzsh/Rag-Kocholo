        "text": "Alejandro Aguilera Castrejón is a new group leader in HHMI Janelia Research Campus’ 4D Cellular Physiology research area, exploring mammalian embryo development. Growing up outside Mexico City, Aguilera Castrejon knew he wanted to follow a different path than his family, who struggled to put food on the table. He didn’t know he could make a living from being a scientist, but his love of animals led him to study biology as an undergraduate, where he discovered developmental biology and stem cell research and knew he had found his path. During his PhD at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Aguilera Castrejon developed platforms that allow researchers to grow mouse embryos outside the uterus to study development in real time. He is especially interested in studying gastrulation, when patterning of the future body of the embryo begins. “I really want to understand how organs and life is formed. In the beginning we are only cells, but these go on to create a being. For me that's amazing.” Aguilera Castrejon was attracted to Janelia because of its new research area, 4DCP, which seeks to understand how tissues form and create organs and organisms. He also liked that tool developers work closely with biologists, the research is internally funded, and that group leaders are expected to do experiments in the lab. “And then I came here, and I discovered all the ideas behind the institute. It's a different way of doing science -- that, by itself, is an experiment. Janelia’s ideology, it’s very similar to my own ideas. I would like to contribute to that, and to change the way science is done.” Aguilera Castrejon says also likes Janelia’s focus on collaboration and appreciates the expertise of his colleagues and their excitement about research. “In other places, people do science just as a means of getting a salary, but here, I think people do science because they like it,” he says. Outside the lab, Aguilera Castrejon likes being outdoors and visiting museums. He also likes to workout. “I think it’s important because in the end, if you are not healthy, it will affect your whole life and you will not be able to do the things you love.” Read the full Q&A here: https://hhmi.news/3Y5fJCJ"
