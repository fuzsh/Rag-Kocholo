        "text": "$500 Will Be Donated to Charity for Every Home Sold During September\n\nThe Howard Hughes Corporation® (NYSE: HHC) is pleased to announce that its Houston area communities — Bridgeland®, the No. 1 selling master planned community in Texas, and The Woodlands Hills®, another award-winning master planned community — will each launch its Fall Giving Drive on September 1, lasting all month.\n\nFor each new home sold at one of these award-winning communities during this period, The Howard Hughes Corporation will donate $500 on behalf of the buyer to one of the following charities selected by the buyer: Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, YES to YOUTH, HomeAid Houston, Montgomery County Food Bank and Cy-Fair Educational Foundation. During a time of record home sales, the charitable effort gives homebuyers the opportunity to make a positive impact in the Greater Houston region while finding a new home.\n\nSince inception, The Howard Hughes Corporation has been an active philanthropist in the Greater Houston area, donating annually to over 130 causes of local non-profit organizations. Community-focused philanthropy is a guiding principle in the company’s corporate social responsibility program, HHCares, through financial donations and volunteerism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“At The Howard Hughes Corporation, we are dedicated to improving the quality of life in and around our communities,” said Heath Melton, executive vice president of MPC, Residential for The Howard Hughes Corporation. “With homes selling at record-breaking numbers, providing our homebuyers with the opportunity to have $500 donated to a charitable organization of their choice will deliver much needed funds to worthy causes. We hope this campaign acts as an inspiration toward building an even stronger culture of giving and volunteerism in our communities.”\n\nThe Howard Hughes Corporation will not be alone in this effort. This year’s Fall Giving Drive will also have 100% of the homebuilders in Bridgeland and The Woodlands Hills as well as some Realtor® partners donating to the selected charities, providing an even greater impact for the charities and the meaningful work they do.\n\n“With homes selling at record-breaking numbers, providing our homebuyers with the opportunity to have $500 donated to a charitable organization of their choice will deliver much needed funds to worthy causes.”\n\nPlatinum contributors include Beazer Homes, Century Communities, Chesmar Homes Coventry Homes, Darling Homes, David Weekley Homes, Fedrick Harris Estate Homes, Gehan Homes, Highland Homes, Lennar, M/I Homes, Newmark Homes, Partners in Building, Perry Homes, Ravenna Homes, Taylor Morrison, Village Builders, and Ray Larson Group – Re/Max The Woodlands and Spring. Silver contributors include Neighbors Ellis Team – Better Homes and Gardens Gary Greene, The Franklin Team Brokered by eXp Realty, The Lippincott Team – Keller Williams Platinum, The Tello Team – eXp Realty, and Shelley Colley – The Franklin Team.\n\nEach selected charity in the Fall Giving Drive serves and aids thousands to fulfill its respective missions. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) is a nationally recognized charity with LLS funds going towards the research for blood cancer cures and improving quality of life for patients and affected families. YES to YOUTH provides Montgomery County youth with crisis counseling, shelter programs and prevention services.\n\nHomeAid Houston, a charity sponsored by the Greater Houston Builders Association (GHBA), identifies long-term stable homeless care providers who need additional capacity and pairs them with GHBA builders, vendors and suppliers who donate their time, materials and labor to help build transitional homeless shelters. The Montgomery County Food Bank’s mission is to unite the community to fight hunger, providing over 11 million nutritional meals through a vast network of over 70 partner pantries, local school districts and community partners. The Cy-Fair Educational Foundation seeks to raise funds to increase college access for graduates and instructional support for teachers of Cy-Fair ISD.\n\n“The Howard Hughes Corporation seeks to not only provide innovative first-class homes and communities, but also act as a steward of the non-profit organizations that elevate our neighborhoods,” said Jim Carman, President, Houston Region for The Howard Hughes Corporation. “The Fall Giving Drive is a perfect example of the power of HHCares, as well as a win-win for homebuyers and the worthy charities they will fund.”"
