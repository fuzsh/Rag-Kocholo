        "text": "Reserve Your Free Trees From the Arbor Day Foundation\n\nHoward County residents are now eligible to reserve up to two free trees from the Arbor Day Foundation. Since 2017, Howard Hughes has partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation with the goal of planting 10,000 trees in Howard County by 2037. To date, we’ve helped plant 3,728 trees in our community, including 600+ in 2022.\n\nVisit ArborDay.org/HowardHughes to reserve up to two free trees from the 2023 selection. On the website, you’ll enter your street address, select the Fall 2023 promotion, and then choose which species you’d like to receive. From there, the Arbor Day Foundation team works with a local nursery and mails the tree directly to your home. It is Howard Hughes’ intention that the free trees we provide be a gift to you and the community.\n\nFive popular native tree species are available in the Fall 2023 selection:\n\nEastern Redbud\n\nNorthern Red Oak\n\nRed Maple\n\nShadblow Serviceberry\n\nWhite Flowering Dogwood\n\nAt Merriweather District, we’re committed to a greener, healthier world. Trees around homes will not only help reduce the amount of energy your home requires, but they also add to your property value, reduce your carbon footprint, improve the air quality, and more effectively catch stormwater runoff. Howard Hughes is proud to sponsor this program and provide Howard County residents with up to 2 free trees.\n\nLet’s grow boldly and spread the green throughout our community! Visit ArborDay.org/HowardHughes to reserve your trees today."
