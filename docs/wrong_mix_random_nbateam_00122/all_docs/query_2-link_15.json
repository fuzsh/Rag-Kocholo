        "text": "Years ago, as the business development manager for a large local construction company, I was chasing the contract for building the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Va. While jockeying to qualify for the project’s shortlist, scuttlebutt began to circulate about the “strange-but-true” genesis of the HHMI. It seems that Howard Hughes was determined that his death would not be his end. In his will, he funded a research center with the ultimate goal of his own resurrection. The mission of the research center was to produce the science that could “jump start” the body he dictated be cryogenically preserved at death.\n\nNo doubt roadblocks will be encountered by anyone seeking to verify this story, but if anyone on the planet is up to the task, it’s Answer Man.\n\n— Rocky Semmes, Alexandria\n\nAnswer Man called the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and asked if they had the late millionaire's body stashed out in Ashburn in a vat of liquid nitrogen.\n\n\"Actually, no, we don't,\" said James E. Keeley Jr., director of Strategic Communication and News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about somewhere in the institute’s administrative offices in Chevy Chase?\n\n“No,” James said.\n\nSo there’s your answer.\n\nThe thing is, Howard R. Hughes Jr. was seriously weird. He was obsessed with his health, something that apparently stemmed from his mother's hypochondria and the early deaths of his parents. His mother died when Hughes was 16, his father two years later.\n\nIn 1925, the boy millionaire — heir to the oil-drilling equipment company Hughes Sr. had co-founded — wrote a will that included orders to create a laboratory for “the discovery and development of antitoxins for the prevention, and specific remedies for the cure, of the most important and dangerous diseases to which this section of the country may be subjected.”\n\nAlthough that will was never executed — and wills, both real and forged, would plague the estate — it did show Hughes's early interest in medical research. However, when the HHMI was actually created in 1953, it was for entirely different reasons. According to the 1979 biography \"Howard Hughes: His Life and Madness,\" by Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, Hughes formed the charity as a tax gimmick. By bestowing the assets of Hughes Aircraft on the HHMI, Hughes dodged a massive IRS bill. He even managed to receive payments from the institute, which did precious little research at first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt does tons now, though. The HHMI has assets of nearly $19 billion. There are more than 300 HHMI-funded researchers at universities across the country. At Janelia, opened in 2006, scientists focus on two things: studying how information is processed by the brain and developing the best imaging tools for research.\n\nAnd here's where the conspiracy-minded might cock an eyebrow. One of the scientists at Janelia is Ken Hayworth, co-founder of the Brain Preservation Foundation, an organization that is offering a $100,000 prize to the first team that can successfully demonstrate a technique capable of inexpensively and completely preserving an entire human brain for long-term storage in a way that allows every synaptic connection to remain intact and traceable with today's electron microscopes.\n\nHayworth stressed that his brain preservation interests are completely separate from his day job at Janelia, where he works on taking extremely magnified, high-resolution images of fruit flies’ brains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s the work on fruit fly and mouse brains that excites Hayworth and others. We’re near the point where we can map the neural connections of a specific fly brain. If you were to scan the brain of a fly that had specific preferences — an aversion to strawberries, for example — and store it in a computer, you’d have, arguably, duplicated that very fly, with all its quirks and personality traits.\n\nHayworth believes it’s just a matter of time — a century, say — before human brains can be scanned this way. But that’s too far away for anyone living today. And that’s why he thinks we need to perfect brain preservation technology.\n\n\"We're not talking cryonics in the sense of being able to preserve biological function and be able to rewarm somebody and have them walk out like Austin Powers,\" he said. \"We're talking about doing what we already do to fruit flies, what people are already doing to mice. Just doing that to human beings in hopes that one day, maybe 100 years from now, the technology will be there to scan the brains and upload them into computer simulations that are controlling robotic bodies.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch a capability would allow long-distance space travel. Rather than send mortals on a trip of 10,000 years, send their brain data encoded into machines.\n\nTo be honest, Answer Man was a bit discomfited by all this. Heretofore, all of human existence has been informed by the knowledge that we will die. Should we be messing with immortality?\n\nHayworth thinks such quibbles are misplaced. We don’t hesitate to spend a lot of money to extend the life of terminally ill cancer patients, he said.\n\nThe reclusive Howard Hughes died in 1976 aboard a chartered plane flying from Mexico to Houston. He was 70. His brain was probably not in the best shape, addled as it was by years of codeine abuse that was enabled by a cadre of toadying doctors. His body was shrunken and abscessed, his arms riddled with the broken tips of hypodermic needles.\n\nHughes was buried next to his parents in Houston’s Glenwood Cemetery. Barring a zombie revolution, he will never rise again.\n\nAnswer Man needs questions! Send them to answerman@washpost.com."
