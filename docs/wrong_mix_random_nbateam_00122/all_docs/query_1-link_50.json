        "text": "HHLA at Howard Hughes Center is a 300,000-sq.-ft. full renovation and repositioning of an existing retail and entertainment mall located in Los Angeles’ Westside. The design by Jerde creates a more accessible open-air mall with an increased focus on food and beverage tenants and activated outdoor spaces. House & Robertson led the technical development of the core and shell project through construction and provided full architectural services for many of the tenant relocations needed to facilitate the larger renovation. The project was complicated by the complex phasing which needed to keep the existing cinema and other major tenants open and operating throughout construction, and the need to interface existing elements and structure with new components in the most cost-effective manner possible. The project was completed in January of 2020."
