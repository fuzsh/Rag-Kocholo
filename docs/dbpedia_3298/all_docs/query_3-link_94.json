        "text": "Mindanao electric consumers may enjoy competitive electricity rates with the implementation of Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) as stipulated in Republic Act 9136, otherwise known as Electric Power Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001.\n\nThis was what Zacharry C. Gutierrez, WESM trainer, told the media practitioners attending the WESM 101 orientation at Limketkai Luxe Hotel, Cagagyan de Oro City this week.\n\nWESM, Gutierrez said, is a venue for trading electricity as a commodity. In other words, it is where the generators sell their excess capacities.\n\nWhen asked if WESM is the solution to rotating brownouts that plagued Mindanao Island a few years ago, Mindanao System Operations head Ambrocio Rosales of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) said electricity supply in Mindanao is now stable. He also disclosed that more power plants would soon operate in the area.\n\nRosales believed that with WESM the power supply in Mindanao would become stable and that the rates are competitive.\n\nSome 30 media practitioners who are members of the Iligan City Energy Press Corp and Cagayan de Oro Energy Press Corp turned up in said gathering. (FPG/PIA)\n\nThe National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) energized on June 3 the transmission lines providing power to the Mindanao State University (MSU), despite the ongoing gunfire in Marawi City.\n\nThe said transmission facility tripped last May 23 when the clashes bewtween the Maute terror group and government troops in Marawi City erupted.\n\nNGCP personnel began inspecting the line as soon as a clearance was given by the AFP.\n\nThe line crew continued with inspections and repairs while gunfire was heard coming from the peripheral areas of the compound. “We decided to go and proceed with the repair with three line crews, in order to give a ray of hope to the lone government university in Marawi City, the MSU,” the team leader of NGCP’s restoration group for Marawi said.\n\n“We are very proud of our team. The bravery demonstrated by the substation crew, who have not left their posts since the hostilities started, despite the risk to themselves, is truly laudable. We also commend our line crew who conducted repairs amidst audible gunfire.”\n\nThe NGCP also expressed its appreciation to the AFP for providing security while the line patrol was doing repairs, and for providing security in transporting supplies being to NGCP personnel on duty in the area.\n\nThe company also assures the public that it is ready to conduct similar repair and restoration to ensure that power delivery service is continuous to its customers and household consumers. (NGCP/PIA-10)\n\nHedcor volunteered to refurbish classrooms in its host communities in Bukidnon.\n\nTogether with the local community, Hedcor supports to Department of Education’s Brigada Eskwela by helping the teachers and students in improving the classrooms and cleaning the surroundings.\n\nThe pupils of the Kalabugao Annex High School in Impasug-ong town, Bukidnon, Sabangan Elementary School and Lingi-on Elementary School in Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon will be soon welcomed by repainted walls and chairs, repaired school’s fixtures, replaced busted bulbs, and cleaned surroundings.\n\nHedcor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AboitizPower. It specializes in generating renewable energy from run-of-river hydropower systems. Today, Hedcor manages and operates 22 hydropower plants and supplies the country with 185 MW of clean and renewable energy. With almost 40 years of experience, Hedcor is the leading run-of-river developer in the Philippines. (Hedcor)\n\nPower producer STEAG State Power Inc. (SPI) will carry out its first planned maintenance shutdown for the year on 8-10 February 2017.\n\nMaintenance activities will be carried out for the major and auxiliary equipment of Steag Unit # 2 to ensure its long-term efficiency and reliability. The unit has a net generating capacity of 105MW.\n\nThe planned maintenance shutdown is expected to have minimal or no adverse effect in the power supply condition in Mindanao.\n\nUnlike in the previous years, Mindanao currently enjoys a surplus capacity of more than 500 MW primarily due to the stable condition of the hydro electric power plants as well as the operations of new baseload capacities.\n\nDespite this surplus capacity, SPI continues to enjoin Mindanao power consumers to remain prudent in the use of electric power.\n\nSPI owns and operates Mindanao’s first coal-fired power plant located at the PHIVIDEC Industrial Estate in Misamis Oriental.\n\nThe company is a pioneer in highly efficient and reliable power generation. It has delivered more than 14B kWh of electric power to the grid and has sustained reliability and efficiency ratings that are higher than industry standards. (spi)\n\nThe ongoing construction of the 68.8-MW Manolo Fortich Hydropower Project of Hedcor in Bukidnon Province reached on 16 October 3.7 million man-hours with no time lost on incidents resulting in injuries on personnel.\n\nHedcor’s president and COO Rene Ronquillo said, “A safe working environment can only be achieved if there is a collective effort from our team. And, this is now the result. Our team has shown a strong regard to our commitments to health, environment, and safety.”\n\nAboitizPower subsidiary Hedcor considers the development as a major achievement, considering that the project site covers 74 hectares and involves a workforce of about 2,000.\n\nRonquillo said the project is now 63-percent complete.\n\nThe first of the two cascading run-of-river hydropower plants is contracted to JV Angeles Construction while work for the second power plant is conducted by Sta Clara International Corporation.\n\nHedcor commenced the construction in May 2015. The hydropower generation facility is expected to be commissioned by the third quarter of 2017.\n\nThe 68.8-MW Manolo Fortich Hydropower Project in Bukidnon will provide additional clean and renewable energy to the Mindanao grid. Recently, Mindanao cooperatives like Zamboanga del Sur Electric Cooperatives 1 and 2, Zamboanga del Norte Electric Cooperative, Misamis Occidental I Electric Cooperative and Siargao Electric Cooperative signed renewable energy supply agreements with Hedcor.\n\nHedcor is a socially and environmentally responsible company. It complies with global standards on environment protection and safety as a company that is certified under ISO 9001 for Quality Management System, ISO 14001 for Environmental Management System, ISO 27001 for Information Security Management System and OHSAS 18001 for Occupational Health and Safety.(Lloyd Revilla/HEDCOR)\n\nPower grid operator, NGCP, reiterates its support for the passage of the “Anti-Power Line Disturbance Act”, which will criminalize the deliberate planting of trees, and the construction of any structure within the right-of-way (ROW) clearances of power lines across the country.\n\nNGCP is hopeful that the 17th Congress, which convened last July, will refile the bill originally proposed in the previous Congress by House Representatives. The company aims to get the support of the present House Committee on Energy chaired by Cong. Lord Allan Velasco of Marinduque and the Senate Committee on Energy led by Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, in pushing for the enactment of the said bill.\n\nThe “Act prohibiting the planting of plants and trees, and the construction of any structure under or within the right-of-way clearance of all power transmission and distribution lines and providing penalties for violation thereof” will authorize private grid-operator NGCP, distribution utilities, and electric cooperatives to immediately cut or prune trees, and remove any obstruction to power line.\n\nThe law, when enacted, is expected to eliminate substantial delays in NGCP’s project construction and regular maintenance activities, particularly with uncooperative landowners and claimants who maliciously plant trees and build structures within the ROW clearance, and demand exorbitant amounts before allowing NGCP access to the property.\n\n“Support in the form of legislation will ultimately be for the benefit of power consumers. The issue on settling ROW cases has delayed both current and new projects of NGCP. It is also a recurring and worsening issue, especially in Mindanao and North Luzon. With the Act, we can expedite the process and improve our turn-around time. The sooner we can complete our projects and maintain our lines, the sooner we can provide secure and reliable power transmission services to the people. We are appealing for the support of our Congress and Senate Committees on Energy by refiling the bill and pushing for its expedited enactment into law,” stated NGCP.\n\nNGCP is a privately owned corporation in charge of operating, maintaining, and developing the country’s power grid. It transmits high-voltage electricity through “power superhighways” that include the interconnected system of transmission lines, towers, substations, and related assets. The consortium, which holds the 25-year concession contract to operate the country’s power transmission network, is comprised of Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp. led by Henry Sy, Jr., Calaca High Power Corporation led by Robert Coyiuto, Jr., and the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) as technical partner.\n\nCAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, October 23 (PIA) – In support to the government’s Expanded Rural Electrification Program, 22 more sitios or sub-villages in Northern Mindanao will be energized.\n\nA ceremonial switch-on was held on October 22, 2014 in Cagayan de Oro City led by power generator STEAG state power incorporated through its Fostering Rural Electrification and Energization (FREE) Project.\n\nFREE is a collaborative undertaking between STEAG, the Department of Energy (DOE), concerned recipient local government units and various electric cooperatives and distribution utilities in Northern Mindanao.\n\nTotal project cost is P23.32 million, funded by STEAG’s contribution to the Philippines Expanded Rural Electrification Program and pursuant to DOE’s ER-1 94 program where generators set aside one-centavo for every kilowatt hour of electricity sales for various social and environmental protection programs and projects.\n\nAccording to STEAG Power Plant Manager Dr. Carsten Evers, “This is only the start. We are operating our power plant for a long time and there will be a lot more generation of electricity.”\n\n“Sooner or later, this will enable all households to have access to electricity. Energize all sitios in MisOr, all sitios in NorMin, and whole island of Mindanao. If we do it as a team, we will be successful,” Dr. Evers said.\n\nMeanwhile, 2nd District Representative Juliette T. Uy during the switch-on said that electricity empowers people to have better access to education, livelihood, disaster preparedness, medical and information services that are all vital to our human development.\n\nRecipient communities include seven villages in Misamis Oriental, eight in Misamis Occidental, and six in Cagayan de Oro City and one in Oroquieta City.
