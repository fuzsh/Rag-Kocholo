        "text": "Innocent Chunga\n\nNkhota-kota, July 20, MANA. The Wildlife and Environmental Society of Malawi WESM, has vowed to strengthen its effort towards the restoration of bird population in areas around Chia Lagoon in Nkhotakota district.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday at the launch of a 312 million Kwacha Chia Lagoon Waterbird project in the district, WESM Programs Manager Blessings Chingagwe, said the organization will assist communities in protecting birds, after noticing that Chia Lagoon is not gazetted as a protected area.\n\n\"The project will work with communities to better manage and restore the vital lagoon ecosystem, reverse decline in vulnerable and declining bird species and improve livelihoods in the communities.\" She said.\n\nNkhotakota District Environmental Officer, Jane Kayira encouraged WESM to work together with other organizations that are already on the ground with related projects at the lagoon to use already existing structures for smooth implementation of the project.\n\nShe said use of already existing community structures ensures project sustainability because other partners like Ripple Africa are implementing a similar fish for tomorrow project in the area which is looking at the ecosystem around the lagoon.\n\nWESM has been dedicated to protecting Malawi's remarkable biodiversity and ecosystems for over 75 years. With support from UK based organization Dawn initiative, the project will work with nine villages from the areas of Senior Chief Mwadzama and Traditional Authority Kalimanjira and Nkhanga in the district.\n\nWESM will work with partners in the project including Ministry of Natural Resources and Climate Change through Department of Fisheries, Environmental Affairs, Ministry of Tourism through Department of National Parks and Wildlife, Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST), Micro loan Foundation, African Parks and Ripple Africa."
