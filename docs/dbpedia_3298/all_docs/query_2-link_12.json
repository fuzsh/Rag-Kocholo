        "text": "My experience at Westchester High school has been great but something that would improve the school would be more diversity. There should be clubs for Hispanics and other students from minority backgrounds since they are not represented at the school. The teachers should find more effective ways to help students get better test scores such as for AP exams. The teachers did not help students prepare for the AP exams, such as taking enough practice tests or reviewing answers, which would be beneficial to students. There should also be more assemblies regarding mental health and conflict solving skills since there are many situations where students want to harm one another. Lastly, our school should learn how to coexist with the WISH students on campus. The two schools should come to an agreement of how many classes should be available for students to prevent crowded classrooms.\n\nWestchester has its ups and its downed. If you're planning to succeed work your hardest. If there isn't a path already pave your own. The school is what you make it there is no general same experience, so don't be scared to take chances socially. The teachers only care if you care. So you have to carry your weight or you will end up drowning in the pool of students who did give up on their academics. I suggest also making friends in high places in this school. You'd be surprised what teachers have a lot of power at Westchester. The staff has amazing school spirit."
