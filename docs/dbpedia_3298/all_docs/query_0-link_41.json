        "text": "Delmarva Public Media announced exciting changes have been made in its jazz and public affairs programming.\n\nOn Sundays, Delmarva Public Media’s WESM (91.3 FM) will introduce three new jazz programs in the afternoon from 1 to 4 p.m. It will start with “Jazz and the American Spirit,” which looks at stories of jazz across America and the musicians who constructed them. At 2 p.m., “Live at the Bop Stop” will feature live jazz performances from the famous Bop Stop jazz club in Cleveland, Ohio. Lastly, at 3 p.m. is “Jazz Most Wanted,” a countdown for each week’s top 10 jazz songs and artists.\n\nIn changes to WESM’s public affairs programming, “Weekend Edition” is moving from 10 a.m. to noon. Delmarva Public Media’s award-winning weekly news show, “Delmarva Today,” will now run from noon to 1 p.m., ahead of the new jazz programs.\n\nTo make room for the new Sunday jazz programs, “Latino USA,” “Snap Judgment” and “On the Media” will run on weeknights at 8 p.m., Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. On Mondays at 8 p.m., Delmarva Public Media will debut the nationally syndicated political program, “Left, Right and Center,” featuring former NPR Morning Edition host David Greene. The show will take the place of “Our Body Politic,” which recently announced an extended hiatus.\n\n“While it’s unfortunate to lose a great show like ‘Our Body Politic,’ its departure created an opportunity to make Sundays more musical for our jazz audience and package our news magazine shows in the evenings where other similar shows have found success,” said Bryan Russo, Delmarva Public Media director of production and operations. “We realize change is never easy, but we believe these new shows coupled with relocating some of the existing shows in our schedule will strengthen our programming on WESM overall.”\n\nDelmarva Public Media has dedicated over 30 years to providing quality music, news and programming. Delmarva Public Media is currently a collaboration of public radio stations under Salisbury University and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore including WSCL, WSDL and WESM."
