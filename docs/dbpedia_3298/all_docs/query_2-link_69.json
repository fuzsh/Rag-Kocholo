The Philippine Power Market The EPIRA reform agenda promote competition and choice 1970 1980 1990 2000 Institutional reforms: ERC, PSALM, Transco, etc (2001) Separation of generation from transmission (2003) Creation of WESM (2006) Privatization of NPC generation (2006) Competition in generation (2006) Transmission privatization thru NGCP (2008) Retail Competition and Open Access (2013) State monopoly in generation and transmission Power Supply Crisis Private sector participation in power generation with oligopsony by NPC and Meralco Electric Power Industry Reform Act\n\n3. The Philippine Power Market: Value Chain has evolved under EPIRA* 3 Generation •Open & competitive •ERC requires that it approves the PSA for a DU’s captive customers •Operates under WESM •No cross-ownership in Transmission •No company can own, operate and control 30% of installed capacity of any grid, or 25% of the national capacity Transmission •Franchised & Regulated common carrier business •Subject to rate-setting powers of the ERC •National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (private consortium) •Open access transmission system •No cross ownership in generation and /or distribution Distribution •Franchised & Regulated common carrier business •Subject to rate-setting powers of the ERC •Non-discriminatory distribution open access •No cross-ownership in Transmission Local RES •DU business segment; can sell to Contestable Customers in franchise area only Retail Electricity Supplier (RES) •ERC licensed Contestable Market •End-users with demand >=1 MW •Contestability threshold reduces to 750 kW by Jul 2016 and to 500 kW by Jul 2018 Captive Market •End-users with demand <1MW •(See contestability thresholds below) WiresGeneration Retail Supply • Distribution Retail Price to Captive Market subject to ERC regulation (including wires charges to RES) • Retail Supply Contract does not require ERC approval End User Market DU Regulated Retail Distribution Services •DU/EC business segment for sales to Captive Market •No DU may source more than 50% of its demand from an associated firm • Contestability threshold goes down from 1 MW to 750kW after 2 years • ERC may further reduce contestability threshold until it reaches household level (7- year goal) EPIRA – Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001, Republic .Act # 9136\n\n4. The Philippine Power Market Comparative Policy & Regulatory Regimes Pre – EPIRA EPIRA Generation Mix • State monopoly in generation and transmission (NAPOCOR) • Government plans for fuel diversity and energy autarky • Government has dirigiste oversight on what gets built and how plants are run • “least cost” development planning • dispatch based on economic merit order • Generation sector is open and competitive • Generation mix and what gets built are driven by the power market: • Bidding Merit order in the WESM • PSAs by DUs and Contestable Customers • Renewable Energy Act imposes RE quota (RPS), subsidies (FIT) and priority dispatch of VREs Power Rates • Bundled generation and transmission (NAPOCOR tariff) • Regulated by ERB using RoRB regulation (recovery of actual costs; subject to efficiency standards) • Unbundled: generation, transmission, distribution, gov’t charges (taxes, UCME, FITALL) • DU End-user generation rate is composite of PSA charges approved by ERC and WESM • Only the generation rates for captive customers and rates for wires services are regulated: • ERC requires DUs to conduct CSP for PSA for captive market • PSAs of contestable customers do not require ERC approval to be implemented • Regulation is based on full recovery of prudent and reasonable economic costs EPIRA promotes cost efficiency through competition and choice\n\n5.

The Philippine Power Market The Buyers: Captive and Contestable Market The Captive Market • The Captive Market are the end-user customers of DUs whose average demand is less than 1,000kW (the current “Contestability Threshold”) • Relevant EPIRA Provisions: • Sec 23: The DUs have the obligation to supply electricity in the least cost manner to its captive market subject to the collection of retail rate duly approved by the ERC. • Sec 25: Retail rates shall be subject to ERC regulation based on principle of full recovery of prudent and reasonable economic costs incurred, or such other principles that will promote efficiency as may be determined by the ERC • DUs secure PSAs effectively on behalf of their customers • ERC requires CSP for DU PSAs • PSAs require approval by the ERC before these can be implemented • PSA contract prices are on full pass-through(no-gain-no- loss basis) except any portion disallowed by ERC • DUs are allowed to recover from their end-users their approved PSA charges and WESM purchases The Contestable Market • The Contestable Market are end-user customers (or those directly connected to the grid) whose average demand is at least 1,000kW (the current “Contestability Threshold”) • The Contestability Threshold reduces to 750 kW by July 2016 and to 500 kW by July 2018 • Contestable Customers may secure PSAs from licensed Retail Electricity Suppliers (RES) or from the DUs Local RES; The DUs will continue to provide Distribution Wheeling Services • Contestable Customers are solely responsible for securing their supply; in the absence of a RES, a Contestable Customer may be supplied by ERC designated Supplier of Last Resort (SOLR) • Any WESM requirement of a Contestable Customer is secured through its RES • RES PSAs do not require ERC approval to be implemented • The Contestable Market size is expected to grow as the Contestability Threshold is reduced (~ 35% when threshold reaches 500 kW)\n\n10.

The Market Framework • The overall objective of power systems operation is to produce power at the lowest total cost • Uniform Price Auction promotes economic dispatch because of the financial incentives for the suppliers to bid their short-run marginal cost • The market framework seeks short-run efficiency: • Output is produced by least-cost suppliers • Output is consumed by those most willing to pay • The right quantity is produced • Generators win market share by offering low prices (Generators are more likely to bid at their marginal cost) • Demand is currently a “Price-Taker” • There are rules to thwart and prevent generators from exercising market power: • “Must Offer Rule” → physical withholding • “Price Cap” → economic withholding • “Secondary Price Cap” → “too-high-too-long” • The spot market operates under WESM Rules (approved by ERC)\n\n22. • Default market position: • A Generator sells all its production in the WESM and a Customer (DU) buys all its requirements in the WESM, unless, they have a bilateral contract and their transaction is settled outside the WESM • RCOA effectively places Contestable Customers in the WESM (whose connection is conveyed through its DWSA) • WESM prices are volatile • Month to month, hour to hour changes • More volatile than commodity prices (coal, oil, Fx) The business of entities selling and buying in the WESM are exposed to volatility risk (Not a way to run business!) • A bilateral contract is basically a hedge benefitting both buyers and sellers with business stability. WESM Rules on net settlement allow the parties to settle their bilateral contract transaction outside of the market • In a WESM regime, the merit of a particular bilateral contract lies in: • the “trade off” between: (a) the generation rate volatility indexed on commodity prices and escalation indices, versus (b) the WESM price volatility from market forces and chance events; • Its competitiveness in relation to other offers (such as plants of other fuel types) The Market Framework WESM is the default market for sellers and buyers\n\n23.

The WESM Price & Cost Recovery Mechanism for the Reserves Market • The application for the approval of the PCRM was filed with the ERC on Jan 8, 2007; • Approved by the ERC on Jul 7, 2008: • Gross Pool concept • Zonal reserve pricing • Ex-ante settlement • Co-optimization of energy and reserves • Administered reserve prices • Re-filed with the ERC on Feb 26, 2013; hearing by ERC on Jan 28, 2014. PEMC recommends 2-stage implementation: • Interim Phase (Mar 26, 2014): Operate Reserve Market based on current design • Completion Stage (24 Months after Interim Phase): Full compliance to all ERC directives • On Jul 7, 2008, the ERC also directed compliance to directives: • Implement an Ex-Ante Reserve Effectiveness Factor • Realign Specifications of Reserve Services to create a Fast Contingency Service • Set up new Lower Reserve Service • Introduce Interruptible Load Dropping (ILD) as a fully functioning reserve service • Set up interim arrangement for ILD • Set up appropriate changes in the Philippine Grid Code • Submit plans for future enhancement and develop Interim Plans • Establish appropriate mitigating measures in the Energy and Reserve Market to curb misuse of market power or occurrence of anti-competitive behavior\n\n53.
