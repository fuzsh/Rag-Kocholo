        "text": "Published August 1, 2008 5:21pm\n\nMANILA, Philippines - A senator on Friday urged the Manila Electric Company (Meralco) to purchase more electricity from the state-owned National Power Corp. (Napocor) instead of buying from independent power producers (IPPs) in order to bring down power rates. A report over radio dzXL quoted Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago as saying buying more electricity from Napocor will lower electricity costs by almost P1 per kilowatt hour. Defensor-Santiago, who also acts as chair of the Senate energy committee and the joint congressional power commission, added that buying electricity from the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) is further pushing Meralco to charge an extra P0.23 per kilowatt hour. Meralco currently sources 42 percent of its energy from Napocor, and the rest from IPPs and the WESM. The senator said she based her suggestions on a report by University of the Philippines professors who conducted a study on high electricity rates in the country. The Lopez-owned Meralco is currently feuding with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), which has a 22-percent stake in the power firm. The GSIS wants to take over the Meralco after alleging that the electric utility companyâs owners were mismanaging its operations and overcharging consumers. The feud was further mired in controversy when Court of Appeals Associate Justice Jose Sabio Jr said in a letter to Presiding Judge Conrado Vasquez dated July 26 that a businessman tried to bribe him with P10 million so he would inhibit from himself from the case and give way to Associate Justice Bienvenido Reyes, who had earlier ruled favorably toward Meralco. Sabio did not initially name the businessman, but Francis Roa de Borja on Thursday came out with an affidavit insinuating that he is the âbroker\" Sabio was referring to. His claims, however, contrasted with Sabioâs. De Borja said Sabio, whom he had known earlier when the latter was just a regional trial court judge, told him that the government had offered him a promotion to the Supreme Court and money to rule in favor of GSIS. De Borja, who said he âsympathized\" with the Lopezes, further claimed that the Associate Justice told him it would take P50 million for Sabio to resist the government offer. Sabio has denied De Borjaâs claims, saying he has proof showing that De Borja âpestered\" him into taking the bribe but that he had refused every time. Meralco has also âcategorically and vehemently denied\" attempting to bribe Sabio or anyone else, saying âthe Lopez family is not in the business of bribing people in the pursuit of its businesses or to win cases in court.\" In a statement, Meralco chairman Manuel Lopez said while he is friends with De Borja, the latter âis not in any way connected with any of the family businesses, especially that of Meralco.\" The Court of Appeals turned over the case to the Supreme Court on Thursday. - Johanna Camille Sisante, GMANews.TV"
