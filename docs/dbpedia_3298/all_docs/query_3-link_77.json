        "text": "By Chemrock\n\nThe continuing high cost of electricity fuels clamor for repealing EPIRA (Electric Power Industry Reform Act 2001) and revert the power sector to a public run service. Has Epira delivered on its mandate to bring about affordable electricity in a more efficient and competitive market?\n\nThis is a 3-part series on electricity. The first 2 parts formed as backgrounder to a better understanding of the status quo of the Philippines electricity system.\n\n1st part was Philippines electricity tariff decoded\n\n2nd part was Electrification and decarbonization\n\nThis final part looks at the restructuring of the Philippines power industry. Deregulation, liberalization or modernization is often used synonymously, but restructuring seems more appropriate, not least because they actually create more laws and regulations. Epira sets the framework to restructure the power industry from an inefficient government controlled monopoly to an efficient market-based one. It seeks to unbundle the industry into 4 separate sectors of power generation, transmission, distribution, and retailing with the aim of ensuring fair and reasonable electricity costs and supply reliability. This blog looks at where we are in the restructuring, whether electricity is now cheaper, its reliability, and how the system addresses decarbonization.\n\nPhilippine economic planning has always taken a revolving-door approach as there is seldom continuity of efforts with each succeeding Administration. The consequence is that long-term strategies beyond 6 years are almost impossible. National wastage, in terms of the opportunity cost of preparatory work done by the previous Admin whose projects are jettisoned, are high. (Right on cue after I drafted this portion came the Dec 21 headline “Lacson: Wasteful projects worth Php583b“). As an exception, electricity restructuring has been on course, held together by Epira. So it has to take legislation for long-term strategies to prosper. The great downside is that the long winding process of legislation always hampers economic activities in a fast paced dynamic market in the real world. A good example is the development of initiatives to address climate change, more specifically, in the mechanism of carbon credits, the kind of stuff that was unheard of whilst Epira was being penned by Legislators.\n\nElectricity industry restructuring is a very complicated task unlikely to be completed by a bunch of lobbyist lawyers and politicians.\n\nLike the Philippines, many other countries also restructured their power industry in the last few decades, some more successfully than others. In the 1990s, the State of California was a great example of what can go wrong. There were several missteps, but it will be remembered for 4 things — a poorly thought out mechanism which allowed Enron Energy to game the system and make off with billions of $, a system that collapsed causing rolling blackouts, the taxpayers being loaded with billions of $ of state debts, all of which resulted in the booting out of the incumbent governor to pave the way for the ‘Terminator”, Arnold Swarzeneggar, into office.\n\nThe Players and their roles:\n\nDOE (Dept of Energy) – policy maker and implementing agency for all things Energy.\n\nNEA (National Electrification Administration) – implements electrification policy, regulates the electric cooperatives.\n\nERC (Energy Regulatory Commission)- jurisdiction over all cases contesting rates, fees, fines and penalties it imposes, and over all cases involving disputes between and among participants or players in the energy sector; – promotes competition, encourage market development, ensures consumer choice and penalises abuse of market power in the electricity industry.\n\nNapocor (National Power Corp) – Govt agency electrificatication of the countryside.\n\nTransco (National Transmission Company) – govt agency that owns the grid assets.\n\nNGC (National Grid Corp) private entity that operates and maintains the grid (a Chinese firm owns 40%)\n\nIPP (Independent Power Producers) – (Gencos – generation companies) licensed by ERC\n\nDU (Distributor Utilities) – Private entities franchised (territory basis) by Congress\n\nRES (Retail Electricity Suppliers) – ERC licenses entities that buy wholesale and sell to contestable customers.\n\nWESM — Wholesale Electricity Spot Market\n\nPEMC – Philippines Electricity Market Corp a non-stock, non-profit company that manages and operates WESM.\n\nCRB — Central Registration Body (under PMEC) — looks after RCOA operations (market development, management of systems & processes, registration of contestable consumers, consumers switching retailers.\n\nBasically, all necessary laws are in place.\n\nEPIRA (Electric Power Industry Reform Act 2001) – the framework for modernization, prioritizes RE\n\nRenewable Energy Act 2008 — incentives for RE\n\nBiofuels Act 2006 — specific targets\n\nClean Air Act 1999 — regulates GHG emissions\n\nSolid Waste Management Act 2000 – mandates waste management\n\nStatus:\n\nPower generation: Goals — open market (checked)\n\nThis sector has been privatized. Napacor has divested generation assets except for hydro-plants. Gencos (power generation corporations) are not considered utilities so it is not Congress-controlled, just green light from ERC is required. Anti-competition safeguards – 100% foreign ownership is still denied; no genco is allowed to have capacity in access of 25% of the country’s aggregate; gencos cannot have shareholdings in utilities.\n\nTransmission: Goals — Govt retains assets, operations privatized (checked)\n\nThe Philippine National Grid comprises of 3 interconnections — Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. The Luzon-Visayas network are now linked. Mindanao grid will be linked up soon. Transmission assets are state-owned, but operation is by a concessionaire with a franchise for 25 + 25 years.\n\nDistribution: Goals – privatized (checked)\n\nDU requires Congressional approval for a territory franchise. Basically, these are local monopolies\n\nRetail: Goals – open market for retail suppliers, contestable market (in a legal tangle)\n\nRCOA (retail competition open access) is a pathway to fully open up the market for consumers. A new class of participants are introduced — retail suppliers. There are no restrictions to applying for a licence from ERC. ‘Open access’ refers to distributor utilities having to deliver the electricity to all retail suppliers’ customers. All consumers will be able to select the supplier of their choice. This is rolled out in stages. Those with loads above 1,000 kWh are contestable. Deliberations at the Supreme Court are holding up those between 750 kWh to 1,000 kWh.\n\nWESM (Wholesale electricity market): Goals — competitive market (partial checked)\n\nThe wholesale spot market is up and running for Luzon and Visayas interconnection. Mindanao rollout has been postponed countless times. WESM seeks to ensure a competitive price by having gencos ‘auction’ their production in a transparent manner.\n\nSummary:\n\nDevelopments are very much in line with the Epira framework. Credit must go to the DOE for doggedly sticking to Epira and ensuring continuity of efforts over several Admins. That in itself is a great achievement not to mention that electricity industry restructuring is in effect a megaproject. After all the hard work over 2 decades, let’s turn to address 3 key questions.\n\n(1) Has restructuring made electricity cheaper?\n\nThis is an industry where data in all its varieties is key. The technology today from mission-critical systems to smart meters, where every tiny little sensor anywhere in the system can be read and recorded, ensures the minutest of data to be generated. Unfortunately, any attempt to analyse the impact of industry restructuring on rates is full of challenges due to insufficient data. For eg, information across the utilities is not consistent, simple averages instead of weighted averages, insufficient data for time series analysis, etc.\n\nIn 2016 the Philippines Institute of Devt Studies did a study on this. Based on data from NEA and with many assumptions, PIDS offered this useful chart.\n\nNote for those who don’t understand statistics:\n\nNominal price is the rate in actual pesos terms.\n\nThe real price is the nominal price adjusted for inflation. It is the value in terms of the bundle of goods and services in the CPI (consumer price index) basket. An increase means the electricity tariff increases more quickly than the general price level.\n\nOverall, real rates have been quite stable. It should be noted that Epira seek to achieve rates that are fair and reasonable, not cheaper. That is of course subjective, but to maintain rates in real terms is nevertheless a credible achievement.\n\nWhat then was the impact of the restructuring? The introduction of WESM was supposed to make generation rates more competitive. Did it? Albeit slightly, nevertheless, the real rates 1994 – 2002 decreased, and then, after the introduction of WESM, started increasing 2002-2006.\n\nNothing is conclusive. There are no ready data at national level to break rates into its various components. Data of this nature would have helped to understand the impact of each cost component on the average tariff. Meralco (for NCR Region) has some good data as can be seen in this table.\n\nNor is there data to isolate the impacts of the various causes that spike rates — fuel prices, currency exchange rates, weather, govt policy or regulatory changes, planned and unplanned plant outages, etc.\n\nFuel prices have been decreasing since 2008 so has generation cost decreased accordingly? The Meralco chart suggests NO. Could the cost reduction be negated by a weakening peso? Well, the peso started depreciating during the current Admin so it couldn’t be a cause for an increase in generation cost before 2017.\n\nAs for regulatory changes, the Meralco chart show significant increase in taxes and universal charge.\n\nTransmission & distribution cost:\n\nBoth operations are monopolies with captured consumers. The rates of the transmission concessionaire are regulated by ERC. The DUs are monitored by ERC but not regulated.\n\nThe rates for transmission and distribution seek to allow operators to recoup capital cost, operating expenditure, and a reasonable return on investments. They are often the most non-transparent, most difficult to understand, and vulnerable to systems gaming. It hinges on asset valuation and relies on some accounting methodologies devised by smart academicians. There are a few methodologies, each relevant to a given situation, not least is to be in sync with tax and govt economic policies.\n\nThis is briefly how rates are computed. First the operator computes the ARR (annual revenue requirements) for 4 years (rates computed 4 yearly) which are then worked to net present values. This total is then divided by the load to obtain rate @ kWh for each year.\n\nNote the 2 lines return ON and OF capital. These 2 items make up 79% and 54% of Transmission and Meralco’s distribution rate components respectively. These are computed on the basis of RAB (regulated asset base). In the past when life was simpler, cost recovery used to be based on acquisition or historical cost. Many countries are still using this basis. The Philippines was also using historical cost, but sometime prior to Epira, the ODRC (optimized depreciation replacement cost) was adopted. I won’t bore readers with the details (takes 10 pages for full explanation), but in simple terms, this involves a subjective revaluation of the RAB. In effect, it assures a continuous increase in the value of the asset base.\n\nTransmission and distribution (excluding transmission loss), account for about 35% of the electricity bill. The net implication of the ODRC methodology is a transfer of great wealth to utility shareholders from the consumer public. It is a major reason why tariffs are high.\n\nThe rationale for ODRC is to have a transmission and distribution rate that supports a contestable market with no barriers to new entrants. In simple English, it means if the rates are based on recovery of sunk or historical asset cost of existing operators, then it will not be profitable for any new entrant who is faced with higher capex (given inflation, historical cost is always lower). So the RAB needs to be revalued. However, this reasoning is irrelevant given that transmission and distribution sectors are monopolies.\n\nIt makes no sense for transmission and distribution to be privatized and run as monopolies. Because these are monopolies, it’s in consumers’ interest for these to be a public service. I posit it’s even better for transmission and distribution to be a merged operation under a single govt agency. Economies of scale and conformity of processes and assets are the benefits. Perhaps only then will the cities of Philippines finally rid themselves of the ghastly overhanging wires along all the streets.\n\nThe Wholesaler Electricity Spot Market:\n\nThe centerpiece of the restructuring is the WESM. Very briefly, WESM is supposed to work like this :\n\nDemand side (Distribution utilities, retailers, aggregators, direct participants) report load requirements hourly to the SO (Systems Operator)\n\nSO requests generators to bid\n\nGenerators bid hourly and quote offer rates (per plant basis – if a generator has 3 plants, 3 quotes are offered)\n\nQuotes are stacked from lowest to highest.\n\nThe marginal price is where the offer meets the demandSO send out dispatch to the successful plants.\n\nThe marginal price is the determined spot rate for the particular hour that buyers pay to sellers.\n\nThe function of WESM is to make generation rates transparent, efficient and competitive. Is it working the way it’s supposed to be and is it making generation rates competitive? The answer is a clear NO.\n\n(Note – Mindanao is not yet in the WESM).\n\nIn the month of January 2015 only 6% of the load were transacted in WESM. This is a dismal failure of the system to show transparent and competitive generation rates.\n\nThe lack of volume has serious consequences for the system.\n\n(a) Most of the gencos’ loads are already pre-committed bilaterally. Only the residue capacity is offered in the WESM. This makes market power play possible leading to manipulation of the spot rates. (Market power is an entity’s ability to manipulate the price of an item in the marketplace by manipulating the level of supply, demand or both.)\n\n(b) The sole purpose of a market is to enable price discovery, which basically is the price where supply meets demand, where buyers and sellers agree on a price. Price discovery ensures fair, efficient and transparent prices. With 96% of loads done through secret bilateral contracts, there is no price discovery in the system. The WESM spot price is not representative of generation cost in the country.\n\n(c) Reliance on the spot rates from the WESM leads to erroneous economic decisions.\n\n(d) Bilateral contracts create a non-level playing field. The retail suppliers who are subsidiaries of gencos, and other retail suppliers with links to gencos have market power over independent retail suppliers. Eg DU Meralco has related companies – Energy Solutions and Management Inc., Solvre Inc. and MeridianX Inc. Meralco PowerGen Corporation, Spectrum (RE). The end result is consumers get the short stick.\n\n(e) With 96% of loads traded outside of WESM, it basically means the system is not within the regulatory controls of the ERC in the spirit of Epira.\n\nAs long as the WESM is reduced to an appendage to the whole restructured system, the market will not develop.\n\n100% of gencos’ loads should be transacted in WESM. Retail suppliers and DUs should buy 100% in WESM and then hedge their spot contracts however they want. With no financial derivatives market, buyers will generally be driven to hedge with a bilateral contract with gencos. The tendency is the market will move towards a form of pricing and risk transfers where buyers will simply hedge with their own genco holding companies. Independent retailers will be disadvantaged. The market will not develop in sophistication, innovation, and strength that leads to better deals for consumers. In the longer term, gencos/DU must divest their retailing arms, Meralco divest their RE generation companies, and financial derivatives developed, such as an electricity futures market.\n\nSome aspects of the Epira game plan have been hijacked by powerful players. WESM has lost its way, and with bilateral contracts almost the only play in town, ERC implemented a Competitive Selection Process for long-term power supply contracts. This makes it mandatory for buyers to have a bidding process and an independent Third Party to monitor it. It is a laughable solution. It is wool over the eyes to pretend a level of comfort that regulators are on top of things. This can be regulation #101 for a govt entity’s procurement process, but it is not the place for the authority to interject themselves into a commercial entity’s internal management. In any case, the goals for securing best prices is universal and commercial entities know just what to do. Not least of all it is fair dinkum the Filipinos’ flair to engineer a failed bidding that will eventually end up in a negotiated bid.\n\nRetail supplier & aggregators :\n\nRCOA opens up the market by bringing in a new set of participants, the retail suppliers, and allowing contestable consumers the right to choose any supplier they wish. Consumers have the choice of any retail supplier, agregators, or DU. This is supposed to make the retail market more competitive and bring rates down.\n\nThe retail market is an open one so there is no restriction to obtaining a retailing licence from ERC. Is it a wonder that almost all gencos and DU like Meralco have their own retailing subsidiary? Would you wonder whether the gencos’ own subsidiaries or unrelated retail suppliers or DUs will have favored deals when it comes to bilateral contracts? Where incestuous relationships exist, consumers suffer. This is the same situation in the fuel pump industry were the oil giants all operate their own petrol stations. It’s a cartel. No good.\n\nHere is something I fail to grasp. DUs make their money from distribution charges. All third party charges are simply pass-throughs — generation cost, transmission wheeling charge, etc. Retail suppliers, meanwhile, need to pay wheeling charges for transmission and distribution, plus generation cost and other 3rd party charges. So where is their margin coming from? It is fairly obvious that all things being equal, retail supplier tariff will be higher than the DUs. Yet many are the reports in media that there are benefits of lower electricity cost when consumers switch to retail suppliers. How is that possible?\n\nI may stand corrected, but my guess, based on what I see in other countries, is that the generation cost as shown in a DU, eg Meralco’s bill, is actually a formulated figure. It is not the actual cost of their procurement, but is based on a complicated formula for the computation which, amongst other things, imputes a margin for the DU. Just as in the oil industry, the retail pricing basis is a very convoluted process. It is almost impossible for those outside the industry to understand. It is this margin that retail suppliers play around with to lower cost for consumers. If this is correct, then DUs have been milking consumers ever since when.\n\nAgain I may stand corrected on this one. I checked the websites of a few retail suppliers. They are all talk of being able to offer solutions to fit their customers’ needs. I was not able to see products like fixed rates for 1,2, or 3 years, peak rates and non-peak rates, or a fuel index-linked rate, etc. Retail suppliers should be offering products for risk averse customers. A 3 year fixed rate locks in the price so customers have certainty which is what businessmen prefer. Or if consumers view fuel prices rising they can lock in a retail rate. Retail suppliers play no economic role if their pricing mechanism continues to subject consumers to the vagaries of the day-to-day volatility of the spot market.\n\nFIT or feed-in tariff:\n\nThis is a subsidy for Grid-sourced RE energy and it’s a significant reason for the high cost of electricity. (See explanation below under (3).)\n\n(2) Has restructuring improved the reliability of electricity supply?\n\nReliability refers to the efficiency in capacity planning and systems balancing. With restructuring, power generation is not considered a public utility. It is open market and there is no constraint to new entrants, subject to the 40% foreign equity limitation and anti-competition restraint of no generator having more than 25% capacity of national load. Only ERC approval is required. If there is proper price discovery, investors will enter the market if they deem it profitable.\n\nInstalled capacity is currently about 22,000MW with a projected additional requirement of about 43,000MW by 2040, a 200% increase in 20 years.\n\nSystems balancing refers to the job of making sure supply equals to demand. Electricity is a commodity that cannot be stored and must be readily available when required. The supply side must ensure that baseload, peakload and reserves are met. The WESM was designed for this, but with only 6% of loads transacted, it is basically meaningless as a management tool. Bilateral contracts take significant control out of the ERC.\n\nThe Philippines is running out of gas, literary\n\nNatural gas combined cycle plants use gas piped from Malampaya plants. With 1/5 of the country’s energy coming from gas plants, not having any gas storage facility all these years subject the country to ransom by Malampaya plant outages. This has happened so many times which spiked the spot rates and hurt consumers. The natural gas reserve is expected to run out by 2024. There is no choice but to rely on imported natural gas. A national disaster looms with no NG gas storage facilities in sight. The Duterte admin is working on a US$2b NG storage facility with interest coming from Japanese and Chinese investors. This has a capacity of holding 5 million metric tons of NG annually. If the Duterte admin fails to deliver, it will gift the next admin the Mother of All Headaches. Construction is estimated to take 30 months. If 30 months is not a problem, think about the time it will take to construct the NG pipe lines to all those gas plants. With the Iron Law of Mega Projects weighing against this huge gas storage project, and reserves running out by 2024, these are years of living dangerously.\n\nHow open is the power generation market really? There is a befuddlement going on in Pagbilao, Quezon Province. A 420MW new coal fired plant recently opened and easily feeds into the nodal point, the New Pagbilao Station built by National Grid Corp. Congratulations are in order. Then again there is another nearby project in Pagbilao by the Aussie company Energy World Corp. This is a 650MW NG combined cycle plant PLUS an NG storage facility with 3 million metric ton capacity annually. This was intended as a gas storage hub for imported gas that will supply the needs of a couple of existing NG plants in the vicinity. This EWC project is ready to come onstream but has hit a dead wall with the authorities for months. As usual, all depts declare their part of the job is done, all lights are green. But EWC has no access to the Luzon Grid and even the last tranche funding from Devt Bank of Philippines has been denied. Strangely, EWC was asked not to enter into any bilateral sales contracts. They are only allowed to transact in the wholesale spot market.\n\nStepped on a few toes, the EWC did. And a few more. Consider this. The EWC project of the 650MW gas plant PLUS a 3 million metric ton capacity NG storage facility, cost US$750 million. This covers the whole works — all auxiliary facilities necessary for the gas hub, such as pumping stations and berthing for LNG tankers. Line this up against the govt-planned US$2B NG storage facility of 5 million metric ton capacity. In addition, EWC has the facility to convert the imported natural gas to CNG which can be priced much lower than the LNG that households use. First broached in the Arroyo admin, construction commencing in the Pnoy admin., EWC project is in limbo in the Duterte admin. Filipinos’ interest now take a back-seat as political and oligarch lobbies square if off, never mind that 2024 is on the horizon. Incredible.\n\n(3) Does restructuring address decarbonization:\n\nGovernments steer the decarbonization process by taking a compliance or voluntary route. The cap-and-tax is a compliance regime. The other route is by way of a carbon tax. Carbon tax is regressive and there is a lot of pushback as seen in the demonstrations in France. Canadians and Americans are in somewhat similar mood.\n\nREM (Renewable Energy Market) has been established. This is to function as a Registry for RECs (renewable energy certificates).\n\nThe Philippines does not have a ‘tax the polluters’ policy in addressing climate change. The restructuring seeks to incentivize RE (renewable energy) developments by 3 mechanisms :\n\n(a) Net-metering – installations of less than 100kW that export their excess energy into the DU earn peso credits for loads thus exported. The consumer must be a DU customer and the DU is connected to the national Grid. The credits are netted in their electricity bills.\n\n(b) FITs (Feed-in tariffs) – RE gencos sell their green loads to the market, and in addition they get paid a special tariff for what they feed into the Grid. Transco collects the FITs and pays the RE gencos. FIT quantum depends on the type of RE. Eg solar pv FIT is about Php8.68 per kWh (which is roughly the current country average for electricity tariffs!).\n\nRE gencos turn to FIT as a source of revenue compensation to recoup capex or sell their green energy low. Is that why Leandro Leviste (Sen Legarda’s son) says his company, Solar Philippines, is selling their electricity below cost?\n\nWho gets to pay the FITs? The consumers, of course, are the ones subsidizing the RE gencos . With RE contributing about 25% of the country’s energy mix, the annual FIT collection goes into trillions of pesos. It contributes to a great upward pressure on consumers’ electricity bills. This is a sacrifice Filipinos pay for clean energy.\n\nPhilippines is behind the market in policy making. FIT was popularized by countries like Germany and Spain which saw the mechanism spurring RE developments. In recent times, FIT is falling out of favor. Germany, Spain Japan, Sokor, etc, are all removing FIT to shift from a subsidy mechanism to a more market-driven one. FIT is bad because, as a subsidy, it distorts market pricing. It’s the reason why there is no FIT in Singapore. Countries are moving toward a form of auction mechanism that is market driven. Here, the Philippines will find itself, as it so often does, caught in legal entanglements because RE projects approved for FIT are given a 20 year life line support.\n\n(c) RPS (Renewable Portfolio Standards) – The scheme is being rolled out. 2018/2019 will be transition years with full implementation in 2020. It sets the pace for utilities to comply with a renewable energy mix in their procurement.\n\nIn the US, and most other countries, the RPS applies on Scope 1 emitters, ie the gencos. They have to comply with regulations for certain percentage of their generation from RE. Fossil-fuel plants of course cannot do that. So they are forced to either invest and build their own RE plants, or buy RECs (renewable energy certificates). Either way, RPS incenticizes the development of RE.\n\nRPS in Philippines applies to Utilities, which is not a Scope 1 emitter. Utilities buy the required amount of RE and sell what they term ‘blended’ price. Consumers pay the ‘blended’ price which means they are forced to buy RE. The big difference is the focus is not on fossil-based gencos to participate in finding solutions to address climate change but passing the pain to consumers.\n\nWind and solar pv rising issues:\n\nWind and solar pv installations currently make up a small fraction of the electricity mix. Both are expected to grow significantly, especially for solar pv which has seen exponential decrease in cost. Two contentious problems lie in wait. Solar pv requires huge footprints due to it’s inefficiencies (about 10-14%) so the issue of optimum land use will be challenging. Wind and solar pv require intermittency management as they are weather constrained. As their percentage in the electricity mix increases, the cost of reserves increases. At the moment, because they are still insignificant, the question of how to compute, and who pays for the increased reserves, has never been broached.\n\nPhilippines carbon road map:\n\nThe camp from the Climate Change group promotes a decarbonization path to achieve Philippines NDC 2030 which seeks a 75% CO2E reduction. The DOE under Secretary Cuisi does not wish to depart from coal technology and eyes the rehabilitation of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant. It’s a divergent view, and with the revolving door policies of economic planning, who knows what direction Philippines will take.\n\nBy 2019 end, the Philippines may expect about 5,700 MW of new capacity at least 63% of which will be provided by coal-fired power plants.\n\nDOE’s direction is the refusal to accept economic sacrifices to combat climate change. The older coal fired plants use coal pulverization technology which requires higher grade imported coal. The Philippines coal reserve is the lower quality grade which cannot be used in the old plants. The introduction of recent so called new clean coal technology allows for the lower quality grade of coal. The DOE inclination is to go for new coal technology to maximize local resources to bolster the economy.\n\nIs there market hype in new clean coal technology that says lower quality coal can be better than imported higher quality coal in terms of environmental pollution? Or is it industry power jostling for market share? The question to ask is the power generation cost inclusive of cost of CO2, SO2 & NOx controls as this impacts the consumers. Data is hard to come by. Table below is a dated one from the US which provides some cost perspectives.\n\nThis table takes away the allure of coal fired plants with or without controls for CO2, SO2 and NOx capture. In the past decade, Solar PV has made the greatest leaps in Mwh cost, but it is still the most expensive technology today. As to the argument that boosting coal mining activities generates jobs and improves the economy, employment reports all over the world indicate that it is the solar pv sector that has seen the most growth in labor figures.\n\nBataan Nuclear Power Plant:\n\nThe elephant in any discussion of the high cost of Philippines electricity is Cory Aquino. Construction safety concerns, high corruption, construction on seismic fault lines, Chernoby disaster – all these weighed heavily on her shoulders. She mothballed the project in 1986. What if she was wrong and mothballing the BNPP denied Filipinos a source of cheap electricity and caused the 1990s power crisis. What if she was right and averted a tragedy of unspeakable proportions. These are contra-factuals not worth dwelling on. The burden was hers to bear and she made a decision one way or the other.\n\nIt’s time to put the ghost of BNPP to rest once and for all, based on facts.\n\na). Cancelling BNPP did not cause the power crisis of 1990s. The rightful blame for the power crisis was (1) the delays in Napocor’s new projects, and (2) the debilitating effect of El Nino which crippled the hydroplants.\n\nb). Cancelling BNPP did not cause the high cost of electricity today because (1) Nuclear power is not quite as cheap as propagated (See table above), and (2) BNPP capacity of 626 MW is only about 2.7% of total country capacity of 22,728MW (2017), hardly able to influence electricity cost.\n\nc). Here’s the mathematics. BNPP capacity was 626 MW and sunk cost ballooned to $2.3B which isn’t even the final figure yet. Nuclear plant has average efficiency of 90% and 30 year life span. So assuming 24/7 operation, the return of capital alone would be :\n\n– Production : 626MW x 24hr x 365days x 90% = 4,935,384 mWh per annum\n\n– Depreciation (historical cost basis) : $2,300,000,000/30 years = $76,667 per annum\n\n– Return of capital = 76,667/4,935,384 = $0.01553 per mWh = $15.53 per kWh\n\n– Using the exchange rate of $1=Php21 in 1986, the cost of ‘return of capital’ alone would have been Php 326 per kWh. Could Filipinos have shot Marcos in 1986?\n\n– No doubt pro-BNPP crowd will cry the $2.3b is all sunk cost, fully written off, and pouring in another few hundred million $ to rehabilitate an expired plant makes a lot of sense.\n\n(d) Nuclear power does not appear to have the level of cost advantage to justify the risks, as seen in the table above.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nWith only 6% of loads handled by WESM, the market pricing is open to wheeling and dealing by the major players. Case in point is the giant DU Meralco. There is action taken by some consumer groups for an inquiry into Meralco’s questionable dealings with sister companies that disadvantage consumers. 4 ERC commissioners have been suspended by Duterte for corruption. This relates to the ERC allowing Meralco to be excused from the open bidding process for their power purchase agreements. Meanwhile, the Supreme court has TRO’d the suspension order.\n\nThe open market spirit of Epira is weakened where a regulatory body is required to actively participate in minutiae processes. Every power purchase agreements of bilateral contracts or RE application for FITs require ERC intervention. It interferes with the fast moving world of commerce and leads to the 4 C’s — collusion, corruption, collision, and courts. The suspension of the 4 ERC commissioners is a reminder.\n\nIt is a very dangerous way to run the affairs of state to have the Legislative spend years crafting a law, the Executive finally acting on what was planned, and then a Supreme Court intervening and bringing in discord. Businesses and peoples’ lives get bruised along the way. Meanwhile projects are left high and dry. A good example in the US is the Obamacare that’s now been ruled unconstitutional. In Philippines electricity it’s the TRO by the Supreme Court on the RCOA scheme.\n\nEpira lives and dies by WESM. Without a proper functioning of WESM, and that means 100% load transaction, all else are just plain sashaying around the system. Without 100% load transaction in WESM there is no competitive, transparent, efficient price discovery. There is no fair spot rate. The market cannot develop further. And consumers, at the end of the day, are at the mercy of power plays of service providers. ERC is merely grand standing their role as protector of consumer interests.\n\nElectricity systems are generally very complicated. Is the one in Philippines any more so than others? As one frustrated consumer related “We have only 22,000 MW installed, why can’t we get things right?”"
