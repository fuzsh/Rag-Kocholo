        "text": "North Negros Biopower, operational since January 2020, boasts a 25-megawatt capacity and churns out approximately 185 million kWh of electricity each year.\n\nShell Energy Philippines has inked a deal with the North Negros Biopower Inc. for offtake for its biomass facility in Negros Occidental in the Philippines. North Negros is a firm of Thomas Lloyd Group which is headquartered in Zurich, is a prominent independent impact investment manager.\n\nThe biomass plant, spearheaded by Shell Energy CEO Bernd Krukenberg, relies on sugarcane waste as its primary fuel source. This not only ensures a sustainable power stream but also bolsters the local Negros community.\n\nFormerly known as Manta Energy, Inc., Shell Energy Philippines operates within the Philippine power sector as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell, concentrating on retail electricity provision and trading.\n\nNorth Negros Biopower, operational since January 2020, boasts a 25-megawatt capacity and churns out approximately 185 million kWh of electricity each year. This endeavor forms part of a broader initiative by the BioPower Group, tapping into locally sourced sugarcane residues within Negros Island to fuel renewable energy.\n\nNegros’s sugarcane farming generates substantial amounts of residual cane trash. Typically, this residue is burned in open fields, posing environmental hazards. The North Negros Biopower plant steps in by converting this waste into clean energy, mitigating the detrimental practice of open burning without necessitating additional investments from sugarcane growers.\n\nShell has entered the Philippines power market as a retail electricity supplier with an objective to help meet customer’s changing energy needs. Shell Energy Philippines Inc. (SEPH), formerly Manta Energy Inc., is a 100% Shell-owned, Philippines power marketing and trading business. Registered as a direct member of the Philippine Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM), Shell looks forward to offering cleaner, flexible and competitive energy solutions.\n\nWith decades of experience as a power trader and wholesale supplier globally, Shell is keen to bring its expertise and understanding to develop customised energy offers for customers in the Philippines.\n\n(Visited 105 times, 1 visits today)"
