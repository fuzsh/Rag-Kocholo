The most frequent types are dermatophytoses or tineas. Tinea versicolor involves the skin in the form of hypochromic or hyperchromic plaques, and tinea nigra affects the skin of the palms with dark plaques. White piedra and black piedra are parasitic infections of scalp hairs in the form of concretions caused by fungal growth. Diagnosis of these mycoses is made from mycologic studies, direct examination, stains, and isolation, and identification of the fungi. Treatment includes systemic antifungals, topical antifungals, and keratolytics. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Multiple topical as well as systemic therapies are available for treatment. Systemic therapies are used for extensive disease, frequent relapse or where topical agents have failed. The aim that translates the rationale of the study was to compare the efficacy, safety, tolerability and cost effectiveness of single dose 400mg versus 7 day 200 mg daily dose of itraconazole in the treatment of tinea versicolor. A clinical study was done to compare the efficacy of single dose (400 mg) of itraconazole and 7 day 200 mg daily dose of itraconazole in the treatment of extensive tinea versicolor. Total 60 patients (aged 18-50 years) were selected for the study during the period of June 2007 to May 2008 in the department of Dermatology of three different hospitals in Bangladesh. Cases having with extensive involvement, diagnosed clinically and confirmed by wood's lamp and KOH microscopy were taken. Patients were randomly allocated into equal groups. Group A was given single dose 400 mg itraconazole and Group B was given 7 day 200 mg daily itraconazole. Fifty three (88%) male and 7(12%) female were included in the study. The mean age of group A was 32.37+/-9 years and in group B 33.23+/-8 years. The mean duration of the disease in group A was 2.63+/-2 months and 2.76+/-2 months in group B. In group A clinical responders was found cure 22(73.33%) and improvement 5(16.33%) and in group B it was found cure 24(79.99%) and improvement 4(13.33%). The measure at the End point (EP1) equals to 90% response and in-group B it was found cure 24 (79.99%) and improvement 4(13.33%). (Here the End point EP2) equals to 93.33%. The EP clinical analysis however shows 91.66% response. Both single dose and 7 day daily dose of itraconazole can be effective in the treatment of tinea versicolor with extensive involvement but single dose appears\n\nAspectos clÃ­nicos de pacientes com pitirÃ­ase versicolor atendidos em um centro de referÃªncia em dermatologia tropical na cidade de Manaus (AM, Brasil Clinical aspects of patients with pityriasis versicolor seen at a referral center for tropical dermatology in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPatrÃ­cia Motta de Morais\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFull Text Available FUNDAMENTOS: A pitirÃ­ase versicolor (tinha versicolor Ã© uma micose superficial crÃ´nica, causada por leveduras do gÃªnero Malassezia spp. comensais das camadas queratinizadas da pele e que, sob determinadas condiÃ§Ãµes ainda nÃ£o esclarecidas, se torna patogÃªnica, determinando as manifestaÃ§Ãµes clÃ­nicas da doenÃ§a.

To avoid a misdiagnosis, identification of dermatophyte infections requires both a fungal culture on Sabouraud's agar media, and a light microscopic mycologic examination from skin scrapings. Topical antifungals may be sufficient for treatment of tinea corporis and cruris and tinea nigra, and the shaving of hair infected by piedra may also be beneficial. Systemic therapy, however, may be required when the infected areas are large, macerated with a secondary infection, or in immunocompromised individuals. Preventative measures of tinea infections include practicing good personal hygiene; keeping the skin dry and cool at all times; and avoiding sharing towels, clothing, or hair accessories with infected individuals.\n\nA Comparative Study of Efficacy and Safety of Eberconazole versus Terbinafine in Patients of Tinea Versicolor.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSharma, Jyoti; Kaushal, Jyoti; Aggarwal, Kamal\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTinea versicolor (TV) is characterised by the appearance of maculosquamous lesions sometimes associated with mild erythema and pruritus in characteristic areas of the body. Eberconazole and terbinafine though drugs of different classes provide both mycological and clinical cure. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of eberconazole versus terbinafine in patients of TV. An open-label, randomised, comparative clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients. The patients were randomly divided into two study groups. Group A: Eberconazole 1% cream once daily and Group B: Terbinafine 1% cream once daily for 2 weeks. Efficacy assessment was done by observing signs and symptoms, i.e., Physician assessment 4-point scale, microscopic KOH examination, Wood's lamp examination, global clinical response assessment, and patient's assessment on visual analog scale at the end of 2 weeks and subsequently patients were reassessed at the end of 4 and 8 weeks to check any relapse. Safety assessment was also done. There was a significant improvement in all the parameters in both groups over a period of 2 weeks. Both the treatment groups, i.e., eberconazole and terbinafine were found to be safe and efficacious at the end of 2 weeks, and no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding complete cure, i.e., mycological and clinical cure (80% vs. 63.33%), respectively. However, early response (at the end of week 1) was observed with eberconazole. No relapse was seen with eberconazole, but one patient had relapse at 8 weeks with terbinafine. Both drugs had similar safety profile. Although both the drugs cured the disease, eberconazole showed better response as clinical cure and mycological cure were observed earlier and no patient relapsed in the follow-up.\n\nA comparative study of efficacy and safety of eberconazole versus terbinafine in patients of tinea versicolor\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJyoti Sharma\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Tinea versicolor (TV is characterised by the appearance of maculosquamous lesions sometimes associated with mild erythema and pruritus in characteristic areas of the body.

The main objective of this study is to define this frequency all patients referred to the Mycological Laboratory of Razi Hospital, Tehran, during a 3-month period in 1997, who had a positive KOH smear for dermatophyte in the groin area were included in the study. A culture from this site, and a smear and culture from the foot (regardless of the presence of any lesion, were performed. Sixty patients (46 males and 14 females entered the study .Epidermophyton floccosum was the most frequent isolated fungus in tinea cruris. Four patients (6.4% had concurrent tinea pedis proved by smear and culture; and the sole isolate form the foot, was Trichophyton mentagrophtes. In three of them, the corresponding dermatophyte in the groin was E. floccosum. In this study, the frequency of tinea pedis in patients with tinea cruris was low\n\nSuperficial fungal infections.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchwartz, Robert A\n\nSuperficial fungal infections arise from a pathogen that is restricted to the stratum corneum, with little or no tissue reaction. In this Seminar, three types of infection will be covered: tinea versicolor, piedra, and tinea nigra. Tinea versicolor is common worldwide and is caused by Malassezia spp, which are human saprophytes that sometimes switch from yeast to pathogenic mycelial form. Malassezia furfur, Malassezia globosa, and Malassezia sympodialis are most closely linked to tinea versicolor. White and black piedra are both common in tropical regions of the world; white piedra is also endemic in temperate climates. Black piedra is caused by Piedraia hortae; white piedra is due to pathogenic species of the Trichosporon genus. Tinea nigra is also common in tropical areas and has been confused with melanoma.\n\nNovos aspectos na evoluÃ§Ã£o clÃ­nica da pitirÃ­ase versicolor New aspects in the clinical course of pityriasis versicolor\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nValÃ©ria Maria de Souza Framil\n\n2011-12-01\n\nFull Text Available FUNDAMENTO: A pitirÃ­ase versicolor Ã© uma doenÃ§a infecciosa causada por vÃ¡rias espÃ©cies de Malassezia com uma tendÃªncia a se tornar recidivante ou crÃ´nica.

The clinical manifestations of tinea incognito can mimic many dermatoses such as eczema, psoriasis, allergic contact dermatitis, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. The diagnosis of tinea incognito is confirmed by direct KOH (potassium hydroxide examination ( native preparation, making the fungal cultures from the lesion and histopathological examination in some cases. Systemic antifungal therapy is recommended in the treatment of tinea incognito. Herein, 10 cases of tinea incognito which mimicking various dermatoses were diagnosed and treated in our clinic in 2014 is presented.\n\nProphylactic ketoconazole shampoo for tinea capitis in a high-risk pediatric population.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBookstaver, P Brandon; Watson, Holly J; Winters, Shauna D; Carlson, Adrian L; Schulz, Richard M\n\n2011-07-01\n\nAlthough topical agents for the treatment of tinea capitis decrease viable fungal elements and reduce shedding, their use as a prophylactic agent has not been investigated. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a prophylactic ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral 2%) protocol to reduce the number of clinically evident tinea capitis infections in a high-risk African American, urban population. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a ketoconazole prophylaxis protocol that was implemented at an urban pediatric clinic for medically fragile children. Patients at high risk for tinea capitis received twice-weekly ketoconazole shampoo. The primary outcome of the study was a reduction in the number of documented tinea capitis infections between the 12-month preprotocol and 12-month postprotocol periods. A secondary outcome included the evaluation of predisposing risk factors for acquiring tinea infections. Ninety-seven patients, with a mean age of 8.06 years, were included. Most patients (78%) were African American. There were a total of 13 tinea capitis infections during the 12-month preprotocol period. During the 12-month postprotocol period, 41 infections were documented: 37 (90.2%) in the prophylaxis group and 4 (9.8%) in the nonprophylaxis group. The average numbers of per-patient infections in the postprotocol period were 0.79 and 0.08 in the prophylaxis and nonprophylaxis groups, respectively. Initiation of prophylaxis did not reduce tinea capitis infections (p=NS). Previous history of infection and a high level of care were significant predictors of infections (pshampoo) prophylaxis protocol.\n\nTinea Versicolor\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n...

A MEDLINE search restricted to English-language articles published from 1966 through 1996 and journal references were used in preparing this review. The data on mycology, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and drug interactions were obtained from controlled studies and case reports appearing in the literature. Both open-label and comparative studies were evaluated to assess the efficacy of antimycotics in the treatment of this infection. Griseofulvin is the drug of choice in the treatment of tinea capitis. Newer agents with greater efficacy or shorter treatment durations continue to be explored. Ketoconazole, the first azole studied for efficacy in tinea capitis, has not demonstrated any clinical advantage over griseofulvin in several controlled clinical trials. Itraconazole is effective, but the available data are limited to case reports and a single uncontrolled study. Terbinafine similarly has shown promise in the treatment of tinea capitis, but the oral formulation was only recently approved in the US. Existing studies reflect the results in infection with pathogens not seen in the US. Both itraconazole and terbinafine achieve high concentrations in the hair and stratum corneum that persist for several weeks following drug administration. This may enable shorter courses of therapy; however, comparative studies need to be conducted in the US. Tinea capitis remains the most common dermatophyte infection in young urban children. Oral antifungal therapy is required for effective treatment, often for several months. The combination of griseofulvin with a selenium sulfide shampoo continues to be the mainstay of therapy until more experience is gained with the newer antimycotics.\n\nMycology of Cutaneous Fungal Infections in Ambajogai: a Rural Area\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA S Damle\n\n1981-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Two hundred and eithteen cases of fungal skin infections were studied.

Hereby, we present a 59-year-old Caucasian male patient with tinea manuum on the dorsum of his left hand. The lesion was formerly misdiagnosed as psoriasis vulgaris and treated with topical corticosteroids. However, the symptoms were worsened. Moreover, new papules and pustules appeared within the lesion. The past medical history was remarkable for psoriasis vulgaris and he had an erythematous and squamous plaque on his lower back resembling psoriasis vulgaris. In order to reach a definitive diagnosis, the skin lesion on the dorsum of the patientâs left hand was examined by light microscopy after the application of 10% potassium hydroxide solution. Detection of septate hyphae confirmed dermatophytosis. The lesion was completely healed with oral terbinafine 250 mg daily for four weeks. Dermatophyte infections in early stages may be misdiagnosed as psoriasis vulgaris and thus, prolonged use of corticosteroids can lead to tinea incognito. Therefore, cutaneous lesions unresponsive to topical corticosteroid treatment should be evaluated with microscopic examination and fungal culture to confirm a suspected dermatophyte infection. Past medical history can provide useful information but a complete dermatological examination should be performed before the final diagnosis is made.\n\nOutbreak of tinea gladiatorum in wrestlers in Tehran (Iran\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBassiri-Jahromi Shahindokht\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: In recent years, skin diseases in wrestling have finally received the attention they deserve. Outbreaks of tinea corporis are often associated with sports involving extensive bodily contact; such sports include wrestling. Tinea corporis gladiatorum is primarily caused by Trichophyton tonsurans , infecting wrestlers at alarming rates. The management of skin infections in wrestlers and other athletes in sports involving skin-to-skin contact entails numerous challenges, from making an accurate diagnosis to determining eligibility for playing the sports. To control outbreaks, we conducted an epidemiologic investigation. The purpose of this article is to determine the prevalence of tinea corporis gladiatorum in wrestlers in Tehran, Iran. Materials and Methods: A study of dermatophytosis was carried out during the period of March 2004 to December 2005 on 612 mycological proven cases of dermatophytosis found in male wrestlers in Tehran. Mycological examination consisted of culturing of pathologic material followed by direct microscopic observation. Diagnosis was based on macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the colonies. Results: T. tonsurans was the predominant dermatophyte, accounting for> 90% of all tinea corporis gladiatorum isolates during the 2 year analysis. Tinea corporis gladiatorum was found to be more frequent in individuals between the ages of 10 and 20 years of age (72.7%. Wrestlers with tinea corporis gladiatorum were predominantly from wrestling clubs in southern and southeastern Tehran. Transmission of tinea corporis is primarily through skin-to-skin contact. Conclusion: Rapid identification and treatment of tinea corporis gladiatorum is required to minimize the disruption of team practices and competitions. Infection with dermatophytes can disqualify a wrestler from competing in matches, and thus, vigilant surveillance and rapid initiation of treatment is important to prevent the suspension of team practices and\n\nTinea Corporis: Five-year Retrospective Evaluation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAslÄ± GÃ¼naydÄ±n\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Background and Desgin: Tinea corporis is an cutaneous infection due to dermatophytes, excluding palms-soles, nails and groins.The distributation of agents varies with geographic and socio-economic factors. In thÄ±s study we aimed to analyse the agents seen in tinea corporis and their relationship with the patientsâ age, gender and lesion location. Material and Method: In thÄ±s study, between January 2007 and December 2011, 62 patients referred to our dermatology policlinic and diagnosed as tinea corporis, restrospectively analyzed. Results compared with patientsâ age, sex and location of lesions for the statistical significance. Results: The avarage age of the patiesnts was 40,5 and accounted for 62,9% of them were female, 37,1% were male. Trichophyton rubrum was the most frequent species in both gender (56,5 %, followed by Microsporum canis (35,5 %, Trichophyton violaceum (4,8 % and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (3,2 %. The incidence of Microsporum canis 46,5 % in women and 17,3 % in men and the diffrence attributed to the contact of women with pets which are an important source of contamination for he zoophilic dermatophyte Microsporum canis more than men. Conclusion: In our study, the frequency and the species of tinea corporis were detected similiar to the literatÃ¼re. There was no statistically significant difference between the variables of agent species, localization, gender and age. However, epidemiological data can be an important factor in the conditions that mycological culture can not be considered.\n\nSuccessive potassium hydroxide testing for improved diagnosis of tinea pedis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKaraman, Bilge F; Topal, Suhan G; Aksungur, Varol L; Ãnal, Ä°lker; Ä°lkit, Macit\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIn this study, we investigated the role of successive potassium hydroxide (KOH) tests for the diagnosis of tinea pedis with different clinical presentations. The study included 135 patients with 200 lesions that were clinically suspicious for tinea pedis. Three samples of skin scrapings were taken from each lesion in the same session and were examined using a KOH test. This study offers an inexpensive, rapid, and useful technique for the daily practice of clinicians and mycologists managing patients with clinically suspected tinea pedis.\n\nBiological Control of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cumini with Aspergillus versicolor\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nS. Israel\n\n2005-04-01\n\nFull Text Available A native heat-tolerant strain of Aspergillus versicolor (Vuill. Tirab. highly antagonistic to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cumini (Foc was isolated from arid soils. In tests performed to ascertain its antagonistic activity against Foc as compared to Trichoderma harzianum, a 99.2 and 96.4% reduction in Foc propagules was achieved in A. versicolor and T. harzianum infested soil respectively. The reduction of Foc propagules in Foc and A. versicolorinfested soil was also determined. In a liquid-culture test, even at a low concentration of 0.5 ml cell-free filtrate, A. versicolor inhibited mycelial growth of Foc. Population changes of A. versicolor were examined at different soil moisture gradients, where maximum survival and multiplication of A. versicolor was estimated at 50% of moisture holding capacity. In general, with increasing concentrations of A. versicolor inoculum, soil population densities of Foc went down. Studies on thermal resistance showed that A. versicolor survived and multiplied even at 65Â°C. Soil amended with A. versicolor alone, or with a combination of T. harzianum and Verbisina enceloides residues was significantly better at reducing Foc than was non-amended control soil. A marked increase in the root length of cumin was observed in soil amended with A. versicolor or T. harzianum or both. The results suggest that A. versicolor has a potential value for use against Fusarium in hot arid soils because it can survive under dry and high-temperature conditions.\n\n[Evolution of tinea capitis observed in mycology laboratory of institute Pasteur of Algeria from1995 to 2015].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHamroune, Z; Mazouz, A; Benelmouffok, A-B; Kellou, D\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTinea capitis are common in Algeria and are a frequent reason for consultation. This mycosis affects children and rarely adults. This is a retrospective study over a period of 20 years from 1995 to 2015 at the mycology laboratory of the Pasteur institute of Algeria. Observe the evolution of these tinea over the years, to study the epidemiological aspects and identify the responsible agents. This study concerned patients of all ages and sexes living in the region of Algiers and the environs, consultant for various scalp lesions. For each patient, a completed information sheet is developed in insisting on the presence of animals and people with similar lesions. For each sampling, direct examination and culture on Sabouraud medium and antibiotics are utilized. The cultures are put at TÂ° 27 to 28Â°C and controlled regularly during 3 to 4 weeks. A total of 2664 samples were collected, 892 examinations were positive corresponding to a frequency of 33.48%. The age group 0-10 years is the most affected 710 cases (79.60%), with a slight predominance for male sex 502 cases (56.27%) and 390 cases (43.72%) for female sex. Eight hundred and fifty-five dermatophytes strains were isolated. Among the species found, Trichophyton violaceum is the most species isolated (59.41%), followed by Microsporum canis to 35.08%. In our series, the number of cases of tinea has increased slightly over the years, the rate of 26% in 2001 has progressed to 41.02% in 2015. From 1995 to 2011, T.Â violaceum was the predominant species, but from the year 2011 we see an increase of M.Â canis and decreased of T.Â violaceum. Tinea capitis remains frequent in Algeria and affects preferentially the children. T.Â violaceum and M.Â canis dominate the dermatophytic flora. Tinea trichophytic anthropophiles have progressively decreased in favor of tinea microsporic zoophiles who saw their number increased. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Choice of treatment for tinea capitis is determined by the species of fungus. Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the most prevalent fungal species causing tinea capitis in children from Egypt and the most useful antifungal agent for treatment. Patients and Methods: A total of 100 patients diagnosed clinically with tinea capitis were included in the study. Samples were collected and sent to the microbiology and immunology laboratory for sample processing and fungal identification by routine laboratory techniques. A study of antifungal susceptibility to chosen antifungal medications (fluconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, amphotericin, caspofungin, itraconazole, terbinafine, and griseofulvin was done by minimum inhibitory concentration technique. Results: Our analysis revealed that Microsporum canis is the most commonly isolated strain. Amphotericin was the most effective antifungal agent followed by terbinafine. The most sensitive strain to fluconazole and griseofulvin is Microsporum gypseum, while Microsporum audouinii was mostly responsive to terbinafine. Conclusion: Identification and evaluation of the antifungal susceptibility of the pathogenic species in a certain geographic region is important to achieve a good clinical response.\n\nAn outbreak of tinea gladiatorum in Lanzarote.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPique, E; Copado, R; Cabrera, A; Olivares, M; FariÃ±a, M C; Escalonilla, P; Soriano, M L; Requena, L\n\n1999-01-01\n\nCanary Islands wrestling is a variant of the sport played exclusively in that region, and is associated with close participant contact.

All patients who attended the dermatology clinic of king Fahad Hospital of the University (KFHU at Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia and who were diagnosed as tinea capitis between January 1991 and December 2001 were reviewed. The collected data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered as the statistical level of significance. The patients with tinea capitis composed 0.14% of the study population and male to female ratio was 1.8:1. The mean age at presentation was 6.4 + 5.2 years. The most frequent sign was alopecia and the predominant morphological type was the non inflammatory tinea capitis. Micorporum canis was the predominant dermatophyte followed by Trichophyton violaceum.\n\nKERION TYPE OF TINEA CAPITIS TREATED WITH DOUBLE PULSE DOSE TERBINAFINE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFranky Chandra\n\n2016-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Tinea capitis is a common dermatophyte infection affecting hair and skin which always requires systemic treatment to get a clinical and mycologic cure, preventing relapse, and infection spread. Griseofulvin has been the antifungal therapy of choice for tinea capitis, but it often requires higher doses and a longer duration than recommended. Thus, effective alternative antifungal with good oral tolerability and shorter course of treatment are therefore required. The objective of this report is to evaluate the effectiveness of double pulse dose terbinafine for tinea capitis alternative therapy. Method: A case of kerion type of tinea capitis in a two-year-old girl was reported. Diagnosis was established based on clinical manifestations of alopecia, presented as erythematous macule with pustules, hemorrhagic crusts, and scales on the scalp, accompanied with occipital lymphadenopathy. Fungal culture showed growth of Microsporum canis (M. canis colonies. Patient was treated with doubled pulse dose terbinafine 125 mg/day and 2% ketoconazole shampoo for two months. Result: Clinical improvements were found on 35th day of follow up, while mycologic cure was achieved on 60th day of follow up. Tolerability was excellent and no side effects observed. Conclusion: Double pulse dose terbinafine is effective for kerion type of tinea capitis.\n\nTinea faciei in a central Portuguese hospital: A 9-year survey.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBorges, Ana; Brasileiro, Ana; Galhardas, CÃ©lia; Apetato, Margarida\n\n2018-04-01\n\nTinea faciei is a relatively uncommon dermatophytosis that affects the glabrous skin of the face. The aim of this study was to analyse the epidemiologic, clinical and mycological features of tinea faciei cases diagnosed at the Dermatology and Venereology Department of Hospital Santo AntÃ³nio dos Capuchos (Lisbon, Portugal). Consecutive cases diagnosed between 2008 and 2016 were studied retrospectively. A total of 72 tinea faciei cases have been diagnosed, involving 37 male and 35 female, aged between 8Â months and 86Â years. The majority were observed in patients younger than 12Â years of age (59.72%). Anthropophilic isolates (mainly Microsporum audouinii, Trichophyton soudanense and Trichophyton rubrum) accounted for 75.7% of the identified dermatophytes. One quarter of the patients were also affected by dermatophytosis in other areas, such as the scalp. Only 10 cases were previously treated with topical steroids due to misdiagnosis. Most patients were treated with topical and systemic antifungal therapy with total resolution of skin lesions, without relapse or side effects. In contrast to other European studies, anthropophilic dermatophytes were the main causative agents of tinea faciei. As previously described to tinea capitis, this result is probably due to changes in the epidemiology of dermatophytes worldwide.

N.; Sadaf, S.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn the present study the potential of live mycelia of Coriolus versicolor was explored for the removal of zirconium from simulated aqueous solution. Optimum experimental parameters for the bioremediation of zirconium using C. versicolor biomass have been investigated by studying the effect of mycelia dose, concentration of zirconium, contact time and temperature. The isothermal studies indicated that the ongoing bioremediation process was exothermic in nature and obeyed Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The Gibbs free energy (ÎG), entropy (ÎS) and enthalpy (ÎH) of bioremediation were also determined. The result showed that bioremediation of zirconium by live C. versicolor was feasible and spontaneous at room temperature. The equilibrium data verified the involvement of chemisorption during the bioremediation. The kinetic data indicated the operation of pseudo-second order process during the biosorption of zirconium from aqueous solution. Maximum bioremediation capacity (110.75 mg/g) of C. versicolor was observed under optimum operational conditions: pH 4.5, biomass dose 0.05 mg/100 mL, contact time 6 h and temperature 30 degree C. The results showed that C. versicolor could be used for bioremediation of heavy metal ions from aqueous systems.

The researchers collected tissue samples from 13 P. versicolor spiny lobster in Lombok waters. 9 haplotypes were identified with haplotype diversity values (Hd and nucleotides (Pi respectively Hd = 0.859 and Pi = 0.00509. Research results exhibit P. versicolor spiny lobster population from the waters of Lombok is closely related to the spiny lobster population in some regions of the Indian Ocean. In general, P. versicolor spiny lobster population formed a monophyletic clone with spiny lobsters from several regions of the Indian Ocean with genetic distance values (P-distance from 0.001 to 0.004. The reconstruction of the haplotype network exhibited no genetic structure, which means that each population is not genetically isolated from others.\n\nPathogenic Dermatophytes Survive in Nail Lesions During Oral Terbinafine Treatment for Tinea Unguium.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nIwanaga, Tomoyuki; Ushigami, Tsuyoshi; Anzawa, Kazushi; Mochizuki, Takashi\n\n2017-08-01\n\nTinea unguium caused by dermatophyte species are usually treated with oral antimycotic, terbinafine (TBF). To understand the mechanisms of improvement and recalcitrance of tinea unguium by oral TBF treatment, a method of quantifying dermatophyte viability in the nail was developed, and the viability of dermatophytes was analyzed in toenail lesions of 14 patients with KOH-positive tinea unguium treated with oral TBF 125Â mg/day for up to 16Â weeks. Mycological tests, including KOH examination and fungal culture, and targeted quantitative real-time PCR for internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, including rRNA, were demonstrated at the initial visit and after 8 and 16Â weeks of treatment. Assays in eight patients showed that average ITS DNA amount significantly decreased, to 44% at 8Â weeks and 36% at 16Â weeks compared with 100% at initial visit. No significant difference was observed between at 8 and 16Â weeks, despite the TBF concentration in the nail supposedly more than 10-fold higher than the minimum fungicidal concentration for dermatophytes. This finding suggests the pathogenic dermatophytes in nail lesions could survive in a dormant form, such as arthroconidia, during oral TBF treatment. Both antimycotic activity and nail growth are important factors in treatment of tinea unguium.\n\nThe effect of surfactant on pollutant biosorption of Trametes versicolor\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGÃ¼l, ÃlkÃ¼ye Dudu; Silah, HÃ¼lya; AkbaÅ, Halide; Has, Merve\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe major problem concerning industrial wastewater is treatment of dye and heavy metal containing effluents. Industrial effluents are also contained surfactants that are used as levelling, dispersing and wetting agents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of surfactant on textile dye biosorption properties of a white rot fungus named Trametes versicolor. Reactive dyes are commonly used in textile industry because of their advantages such as brightness and excellent color fastness. A recative textile dye, called Everzol Black, was used in this study. The low-cost mollasses medium is used for fungal growth. The usage of mollases, the sugar refinery effluent as a source of energy and nutrients, gained importance because of reducing the cost and also reusing another waste. In biosorption process the effect of surfactant on dye removal properties of T. versicolor was examined as a function of pH, dye consentration and surfactant concentration. The results of this study showed that the surfactant enhanced the dye removal capacity of Trametes versicolor. The dye and surfactant molecules were interacted electrostatically and these electrostatic interactions improved dye removal properties of filamentous fungus T. versicolor. The results of this study recommended the use of surfactants as an inducer in textile wastewater treatment technologies.\n\nTinea capitis: study of asymptomatic carriers and sick adolescents, adults and elderly who live with children with the disease\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBERGSON Christiane Loureiro\n\n2001-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection that occurs mainly in childhood; there are few reports, in Brazil, in adolescents and adults. The detection of asymptomatic carriers is of great importance in the disease control. From February 1998 to February 1999, a study was performed at the outpatient Dermatologic Unit of Instituto de Puericultura e Pediatria MartagÃ£o Gesteira (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil to verify the frequency of asymptomatic carriers and tinea capitis between 79 adolescents, adults and elderly who lived in the same household of 56 children (0-12 years with tinea capitis. Of these, one female and one male adults (2.5% were asymptomatic carriers and the cultures revealed Trichophyton tonsurans and Microsporum canis respectively. One female adolescent and two female adults (3.8% had tinea capitis and all cultures revealed Trichophyton tonsurans. The study has shown that adolescents and adults who live in the same household of children with tinea capitis may be sick or asymptomatic carriers.\n\nAcral pityriasis versicolor â A rare clinical presentation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTasleem Arif\n\n2015-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Pityriasis versicolor is a superficial fungal infection of the skin caused by the yeast of the genus Malassezia and presents as hypo or hyper pigmented scaly macules. The most commonly affected sites include upper trunk, upper arms, neck and the abdomen. Lesions confined to the acral parts like hands and feet have rarely been reported. In this article the author reports a 40 year old male who presented with multiple hypo pigmented scaly macules confined to the acral parts (hands and wrist. The acral variant of pityriasis versicolor is considered to be a very rare clinical entity which prompted the author to report this case.\n\n[Superficial mycoses: comparative study between type 2 diabetic patients and a non-diabetic control group].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGarcÃ­a-HumbrÃ­a, Leila; Richard-Yegres, Nicole; PÃ©rez-Blanco, Maigualida; Yegres, Francisco; Mendoza, Mireya; Acosta, Arnaldo; HernÃ¡ndez, Rosaura; ZÃ¡rraga, Eluz\n\n2005-03-01\n\nSuperficial mycoses are considered to affect more frequently patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2), specially onychomycosis and Tinea pedis.

Clinical, metabolic, mycologic and inmunologic studies against Candida albicans, were carried out. Both diabetics 75% (30/40) and controls 65% (26/40) presented a high frequency of superficial mycoses (no significant difference p = 0.329). Pitiriasis versicolor was not detected in diabetic patients. They presented Tinea unguium, concomitant with Tinea pedis, with a higher frequency. The predominant dermatophyte was Trichophyton rubrum 18/23 (78%) in diabetics and 8/16 (50%) in non diabetics. Candida was isolated as commensal from oral mucous: 23/40 (58%) in diabetics and 21/40 (52%) in non diabetics (serotipo A was the more frequent), and from onychomycosis: 11/40 (28%) in diabetics and 12/40 (30%) in non diabetics. The immunological response was the same in both groups: celular 100%, humoral 20%. No statistical correlation among superficial mycoses, blood glucose level, glycosylated hemoglobin values or the time suffering the disease was observed. The high susceptibility to dermatophytes and Candida sp. infection showed to be associated with age and no with the diabetic type 2 condition in those patients.\n\nTinea Pedis Presenting as Asymmetric Purpuric Papules on the Sole of the Foot: A Case Report\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJennifer Yan Fei Chen\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available In this report we describe a unique case of tinea pedis. A 29-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of asymptomatic purpuric papules predominantly on his left foot. Potassium hydroxide preparation demonstrated fungal hyphae and culture yielded Trichophyton mentagrophytes. This patient presented unusually with purpuric papules, unlike the three commonly described types of tinea pedis. Given the morphology, positive potassium hydroxide slide preparation, T. mentagrophytes on fungal culture and clinical response to ketoconazole cream, we conclude that this represents a unique variant of tinea pedis. We recognize that even common dermatological diagnoses can have unique presentations, and it is important for clinicians to maintain a broad differential for new dermatologic cases.\n\nChemical constituents of Simarouba versicolor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nArriaga, Angela M.C.; Mesquita, Aldenor C. de; Pouliquen, Yvone B.M.; Lima, Roberto A. de; Cavalcante, Sergio H.; Carvalho, Mario G. de; Siqueira, Jose A. de; Alegrio, Leila V.; Braz-Filho, Raimundo\n\n2002-01-01\n\nFrom the roots, stems and fruits of Simarouba versicolor (Simaroubaceae) were isolated quassinoids (3, 5-7), triterpenoids (8-14), a mixture of steroids (15-17), the flavonoid kaempferol (18) and the squalene derivative 11,14-diacetoxy-7,10; 15,18-diepoxy-6,19-dihidroxy-6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19-octahydrosqualene (19).

Tinea profunda typically involves the scalp and beard. Infection within the mons pubis is rare. Objective . To present a case of tinea profunda in a rare location. Case report . A 19-year-old female, the owner of a hamster, noticed a nodule on her mons pubis. She had shaved this part of the skin some days before. The skin surrounding the nodule became erythematous and slightly scaly soon. She was treated with topical corticosteroids and oral antibiotics after consultation at an outpatient clinic. Despite the treatment, exacerbation of skin lesions was observed. The patient was admitted to the Department of Gynecology and, after consultation, was referred to the Department of Dermatology with the preliminary diagnosis of bacterial skin infection of the mons pubis and vulval area. Bacteriological tests were negative twice. Fungal mycelium was demonstrated on direct mycological examination and Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. granulosum was cultured. The patient was successfully treated with terbinafine, then fluconazole. Conclusions . Atypical location of fungal infection may cause a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma.\n\nMicoses superficiais na cidade de Manaus, AM, entre marÃ§o e novembro/2003 Superficial mycoses in the City of Manaus/AM between March and November/2003\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJosÃ© Augusto Almendros de Oliveira\n\n2006-06-01\n\nFull Text Available FUNDAMENTOS: Micoses superficiais estritas sÃ£o infecÃ§Ãµes fÃºngicas que se localizam nas camadas superficiais da pele e seus anexos.

Identification of Malassezia species isolated from patients with pityriasis versicolor. In 100 patients with pityriasis versicolor, Malassezia species were identified by culture in Sabouraud's dextrose agar containing cycloheximide with olive oil overlay and modified Dixon agar and by doing biochemical tests (catalase reaction, assimilation of glycine, and Tween utilisation tests). In 10 patients, 10% KOH smear was negative, while in 90 patients the smear showed characteristic \"spaghetti and meatball\" appearance. Of these 90 cases, growth was obtained on modified Dixon's agar in 87 cases. Fifty of the isolates (57.5%) were M. globosa, 15 (17.2%) were M. sympodialis, seven (8.0%) were suspected M. sympodialis, 6 (6.9%) each of the isolates were M. furfur and M. obtusa, and three (3.4%) isolates were M. restricta. M. globosa was the most common species, followed by M. sympodialis, M. furfur, M. obtusa, and M. restricta.\n\nExploitation of Trametes versicolor for bioremediation of endocrine disrupting chemicals in bioreactors.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCinzia Pezzella\n\nFull Text Available Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs are environmental contaminants causing increasing concerns due to their toxicity, persistence and ubiquity. In the present study, degradative capabilities of Trametes versicolor, Pleurotus ostreatus and Phanerochaete chrysosporium to act on five EDCs, which represent different classes of chemicals (phenols, parabens and phthalate and were first applied as single compounds, were assessed. T. versicolor was selected due to its efficiency against target EDCs and its potentialities were exploited against a mixture of EDCs in a cost-effective bioremediation process. A fed-batch approach as well as a starvation strategy were applied in order to reduce the need for input of 'fresh' biomass, and avoid the requirement for external nutrients. The fungus was successfully operated in two different bioreactors over one week. Semi-batch cultures were carried out by daily adding a mixture of EDCs to the bioreactors in a total of five consecutive degradation cycles. T. versicolor was able to efficiently remove all compounds during each cycle converting up to 21 mg L-1 day-1 of the tested EDCs. The maintained ability of T. versicolor to remove EDCs without any additional nutrients represents the main outcome of this study, which enables to forecast its application in a water treatment process.\n\nBiodegradation and utilization of 4-n-nonylphenol by Aspergillus versicolor as a sole carbon and energy source\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKrupiÅski, Mariusz; Janicki, Tomasz; PaÅecz, BartÅomiej; DÅugoÅski, Jerzy\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ A. versicolor is able to degrade 4-n-NP as the sole source of carbon and energy. â¢ 4-n-NP removal by A. versicolor was accompanied by the formation of metabolites. â¢ Radioactive experiments show complete 4-n-NP mineralization by A. versicolor. â¢ 4-n-NP initiates heat production in the A. versicolor spores. - Abstract: 4-n-Nonylphenol (4-n-NP) is an environmental pollutant with endocrine-disrupting activities that is formed during the degradation of nonylphenol polyethoxylates, which are widely used as surfactants. Utilization of 4-n-NP by the filamentous fungus Aspergillus versicolor as the sole carbon and energy source was investigated. By means of gas chromatographyâmass spectrometry, we showed that in the absence of any carbon source other than 4-n-NP in the medium, A. versicolor completely removed the xenobiotic (100 mg L â1 ) after 3 d of cultivation. Moreover, mass spectrometric analysis of intracellular extracts led to the identification of eight intermediates. The mineralization of the xenobiotic in cultures supplemented with 4-n-NP [ring- 14 C(U)] as a growth substrate was also assessed. After 3 d of incubation, approximately 50% of the initially applied radioactivity was recovered in the form of 14 CO 2 , proving that this xenobiotic was completely metabolized and utilized by A. versicolor as a carbon source. Based on microscopic analysis, A. versicolor is capable of germinating spores under such conditions. To confirm these observations, a microcalorimetric method was used. The results show that even the highest amount of 4-n-NP initiates heat production in the fungal samples, proving that metabolic processes were affected by the use of 4-n-NP as an energetic substrate\n\nBiodegradation and utilization of 4-n-nonylphenol by Aspergillus versicolor as a sole carbon and energy source\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKrupiÅski, Mariusz; Janicki, Tomasz [Department of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 ÅÃ³dÅº (Poland); PaÅecz, BartÅomiej [Department of Physical Chemistry, University of Lodz, Pomorska 165, 90-236 ÅÃ³dÅº (Poland); DÅugoÅski, Jerzy, E-mail: jdlugo@biol.uni.lodz.pl [Department of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 ÅÃ³dÅº (Poland)\n\n2014-09-15\n\nHighlights: â¢ A. versicolor is able to degrade 4-n-NP as the sole source of carbon and energy. â¢ 4-n-NP removal by A. versicolor was accompanied by the formation of metabolites. â¢ Radioactive experiments show complete 4-n-NP mineralization by A. versicolor. â¢ 4-n-NP initiates heat production in the A. versicolor spores. - Abstract: 4-n-Nonylphenol (4-n-NP) is an environmental pollutant with endocrine-disrupting activities that is formed during the degradation of nonylphenol polyethoxylates, which are widely used as surfactants.

Chemical analysis of pretreated biomass showed that the two studied strains were able to selectively degrade lignin. Selective lignin degradation was greater in week 3 of the pretreatment by Trametes versicolor compared to the other strain. Lengthening pretreatment time increased both lignin and cellulose losses which caused a reduction in selective lignin degradation for both strains. X-ray diffractometry showed that after seven weeks of pretreatment, the crystallinity of the woody biomass was decreased significantly. It decreased from 46% for untreated wood chips to 37% and 44% for Stereum hirsutum and Trametes versicolor treated biomass, respectively. The pretreatment with these two white rot fungi showed that 3-week pretreatment provided a cellulose rich biomass with the minimum cellulose loss compared to the other time of pretreatment.\n\nAtrophic pityriasis versicolor occurring in a patient with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMarinello, Elena; Piaserico, Stefano; Alaibac, Mauro\n\n2017-01-18\n\nPityriasis versicolor is one of the most frequent epidermal mycotic infections in the world, but its atrophic variant is rarely described. The aetiology of the atrophy is still unknown, and two main hypotheses have been formulated, one suggesting a correlation with long-term use of topical steroids and the other a delayed type hypersensitivity to epicutaneous antigens derived from components of the fungus. Atrophic pityriasis versicolor is a benign disease, but needs to be distinguished from other more severe skin diseases manifesting with cutaneous atrophy. The diagnosis can be easily confirmed by direct microscopic observation of the scales soaked in 15% potassium hydroxide, which reveals the typical 'spaghetti and meatball' appearance, or by a skin biopsy in doubtful cases. Here, we describe a case of extensive atrophic pityriasis versicolor occurring in a woman affected by SjÃ¶gren's syndrome which completely resolved after topical antifungal treatment. 2017 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\n\nLeaf removal by sesarmid crabs in Bangrong mangrove forest, Phuket, Thailand; with emphasis on the feeding ecology of Neoepisesarma versicolor\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nThongtham, Nalinee; Kristensen, Erik; Puangprasan, Som-Ying\n\n2008-12-01\n\nField measurements on leaf removal by populations of sesarmid crabs at different locations in the Bangrong mangrove forest, Phuket, Thailand, indicated that crabs on average can remove 87% of the daily leaf litter fall by ingestion or burial. The removal rate is correlated positively with the number of crab burrows and negatively with tidal inundation time. The results from the field were supplemented with observations on the behavior of Neoepisesarma versicolor in laboratory microcosms and a mangrove mesocosm. N. versicolor feeds primarily at night and total time spent feeding was up to an order of magnitude higher in the artificial microcosms than under simulated in situ conditions in the mesocosm. Most of the time during both day and night was spent resting near the entrance or inside burrows. N. versicolor mainly feeds on mangrove leaves and scraps of food material from the sediment surface. This is supported by examinations of stomach content, which showed that 62% is composed of higher plant material and 38% of detritus and mineral particles from the sediment. The nutritive value of leaves and detritus is insufficient to maintain crab growth. Sesarmid crabs may instead obtain the needed nutrients by occasional consumption of nitrogen-rich animal tissues, such as carcasses of fish and crustaceans, as indicated by the presence of animal remains in the stomach and the willingness of crabs to consume fish meat. Laboratory experiments on leaf consumption and leaf preferences of N. versicolor indicate that they preferentially feed on brown leaves, if available, followed by green and yellow leaves. If all species of sesarmid crabs in the Bangrong mangrove forest consume leaves at the same rate as N. versicolor, they could potentially ingest 52% of the total litter fall.\n\nSteroids isolated from Millettia versicolor Baker (Fabaceae)\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nSTORAGESEVER\n\n2008-06-03\n\nJun 3, 2008 ...

On examination, follicular brownish maculopapules were present on the chest with a uniform size of about 3 mm in diameter. The lesions were isolated without a tendency to merge, giving several S-shaped, band-like appearances. Direct mycological examination of the skin flakes revealed many pseudomycelial hyphae and yeast cells with typical spaghetti and meatball appearance. Wood's light examination of the lesion revealed a golden yellow fluorescence. A diagnosis of blaschkoid pityriasis versicolor was suggested because of blaschkoid distribution of the lesions in this new variant of PV.\n\nPrevalence of different Malassezia species in pityriasis versicolor in central India\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChaudhary Rahul\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: In the last 10 years, different studies have shown interesting geographical variations in the prevalence of different Malassezia species in pityriasis versicolor.

If not diagnosed and treated, it may lead to disfigurement of the areas involved and also result in deep invasive infections. Aim: The aim of the present study was to identify and speciate Malassezia in patients clinically suspected of having Pityriasis versicolor. Materials and Methods: Total 139 patients suspected of having Pityriasis versicolor were evaluated clinically and diagnosis was done by Woodâ²s lamp examination, confirmed mycologically by using KOH, cultivation on Sabouraudâ²s dextrose agar and modified Dixon agar at a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai. The total duration of study was 12 months. Results: Majority of the patients were males (59.71% in the age group of 21-30 years (33.81% who were students (30.21% by profession. The incidence of Malassezia in Pityriasis versicolor was 50.35%. The most common isolate was M. globosa (48.57%, followed by M. furfur (34.28%. Majority of the patients had hypopigmented lesions, with M. globosa as the predominant isolate. Neck was the most common site affected; 88.48% were Woodâ²s lamp positive of which 56.91% of Malassezia isolates grew on culture. KOH mount was positive in 82.01% of which 61.40% Malassezia isolates grew on culture. Conclusions: The procedure of culture and antifungal testing is required to be performed as different species of Malassezia are involved in Pityriasis versicolor and susceptibility is different among different species. Thus, it would help to prevent recurrences and any systemic complications.\n\nEffect of Aspergillus versicolor strain JASS1 on low density polyethylene degradation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGajendiran, A.; Subramani, S.; Abraham, J.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nLow density polyethylene (LDPE) waste disposal remains one of the major environmental concerns faced by the world today. In past decades, major focus has been given to enhance the biodegradation of LDPE by microbial species. In this present study, Aspergillus versicolor with the ability to degrade LDPE was isolated from municipal landfill area using enrichment technique. Based on 18S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed its identity as Aspergillus versicolor. The biodegradation study was carried out for 90 d in M1 medium. The degradation behaviour of LDPE films by Aspergillus versicolor strain JASS1 were confirmed by weight loss, CO2 evolution, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, Atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) technique. From current investigation, it can be concluded that our isolated strain JASS1 had the potential to degrade LDPE films and it can be useful in solving the problem caused by polyethylene in the environment.\n\nCombination treatment of oral terbinafine with topical terbinafine and 10% urea ointment in hyperkeratotic type tinea pedis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShi, Tian-Wei; Zhang, Jiang-An; Zhang, Xian-Wei; Yu, Hong-Xing; Tang, Yong-Bo; Yu, Jian-Bin\n\n2014-09-01\n\nHyperkeratotic-type tinea pedis is chronic and recalcitrant to topical antifungal agents. Some topical antifungal agents are effective; however, long duration of therapy is required, which often reduce the treatment compliance of patients. To seek for short period therapy of hyperkeratotic type tinea pedis, in this study, we observed the efficacy and safety of treatment of topical terbinafine and 10% urea ointment combined oral terbinafine. Participants with hyperkeratotic type tinea pedis were randomly assigned to two groups. Patients in group I were treated with oral terbinafine for 2 weeks and topical terbinafine and 10% urea ointment for 4 weeks, whereas in group II, only the above topical agents were applied for 12 weeks. Clinical improvement rates and fungal eradication rates were compared between the two groups at 24 weeks after the initiation of treatment. The group I had stopped the topical therapy 8 weeks earlier than group II. There were no significant differences in mycological eradication rates and clinical improvement rates between the two groups, besides, no major side effects were noted in both groups. The short combination therapy with oral terbinafine was effective and safe; it should be a valuable option for patients with hyperkeratotic type tinea pedis.

CONCLUSÃES: A pitirÃ­ase versicolor nÃ£o se mostrou mais freqÃ¼ente e nem mais agressiva na populaÃ§Ã£o imunodeprimida pelo HIV em relaÃ§Ã£o ao grupo controle, enquanto a dermatite seborrÃ©ica apresentou-se mais freqÃ¼ente no grupo infectado pelo HIV.\n\nPrevalence of Tinea capitis in school going children from Mathare, informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMoto, Jedidah Ndunge; Maingi, John Muthini; Nyamache, Anthony Kebira\n\n2015-06-27\n\nTinea capitis is a common infection especially in poor resource settings. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence Tinea capitis in children from selected schools from an urban slum in Nairobi city of Kenya. A cross-sectional study was carried out in 150 school going children during the period between May and September 2013. A questionnaire was administered and cultures of scalps, skin scrapping/hair stubs samples were performed and the etiological agents identified and confirmed. In a total of one hundred and fifty (150) children recruited 89 (59.3%) were males and 61 (40.7%) females aged between 3 and 14 years. The overall prevalence rates in dermatophytes infection was 81.3% (122/150) with etiological agents consisting Trichophyton spp. (61.3%), Microsporum spp. (13.3%) and Epidermophyton spp. (7.3%) infections with infections occurring either singly (56%), duo (38%) or tipple co-infections (6%). This study demonstrates a high prevalence of Tinea infections with Trichophyton tonsurans as the predominant etiological agent in school going children of the urban slums of Nairobi.\n\nSymbiosis initiation in the bacterially luminous sea urchin cardinalfish Siphamia versicolor.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDunlap, P V; Gould, A L; Wittenrich, M L; Nakamura, M\n\n2012-09-01\n\nTo determine how each new generation of the sea urchin cardinalfish Siphamia versicolor acquires the symbiotic luminous bacterium Photobacterium mandapamensis, and when in its development the S. versicolor initiates the symbiosis, procedures were established for rearing S. versicolor larvae in an aposymbiotic state. Under the conditions provided, larvae survived and developed for 28 days after their release from the mouths of males. Notochord flexion began at 8 days post release (dpr). By 28 dpr, squamation was evident and the caudal complex was complete. The light organ remained free of bacteria but increased in size and complexity during development of the larvae. Thus, aposymbiotic larvae of the fish can survive and develop for extended periods, major components of the luminescence system develop in the absence of the bacteria and the bacteria are not acquired directly from a parent, via the egg or during mouth brooding. Presentation of the symbiotic bacteria to aposymbiotic larvae at 8-10 dpr, but not earlier, led to initiation of the symbiosis. Upon colonization of the light organ, the bacterial population increased rapidly and cells forming the light-organ chambers exhibited a differentiated appearance. Therefore, the light organ apparently first becomes receptive to colonization after 1 week post-release development, the symbiosis is initiated by bacteria acquired from the environment and bacterial colonization induces morphological changes in the nascent light organ. The abilities to culture larvae of S. versicolor for extended periods and to initiate the symbiosis in aposymbiotic larvae are key steps in establishing the experimental tractability of this highly specific vertebrate and microbe mutualism.

The structures of 1-7 were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data and chemical evidence. The absolute configuration of the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) group in 1-4 was ascertained by chemical analysis combined with a chiral HPLC method. Cytotoxic activities of the isolated compounds were evaluated against a small panel of cancer and other cell lines.\n\nFlavonoids Promote Haustoria Formation in the Root Parasite Triphysaria versicolor1\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAlbrecht, Huguette; Yoder, John I.; Phillips, Donald A.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nParasitic plants in the Scrophulariaceae develop infective root structures called haustoria in response to chemical signals released from host-plant roots. This study used a simple in vitro assay to characterize natural and synthetic molecules that induce haustoria in the facultative parasite Triphysaria versicolor. Several phenolic acids, flavonoids, and the quinone 2,6-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone induced haustoria in T. versicolor root tips within hours after treatment. The concentration at which different molecules were active varied widely, the most active being 2,6-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone and the anthocyanidin peonidin. Maize (Zea mays) seeds are rich sources of molecules that induce T. versicolor haustoria in vitro, and chromatographic analyses indicated that the active molecules present in maize-seed rinses include anthocyanins, other flavonoids, and simple phenolics. The presence of different classes of inducing molecules in seed rinses was substantiated by the observation that maize kernels deficient in chalcone synthase, a key enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis, released haustoria-inducing molecules, although at reduced levels compared with wild-type kernels. We discuss these results in light of existing models for host perception in the related parasitic plant Striga.

Structural characterization and biological effects.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarzia Scarpari\n\nFull Text Available Mushrooms represent a formidable source of bioactive compounds. Some of these may be considered as biological response modifiers; these include compounds with a specific biological function: antibiotics (e.g. plectasin, immune system stimulator (e,g, lentinan, antitumor agents (e.g. krestin, PSK and hypolipidemic agents (e.g. lovastatin inter alia. In this study, we focused on the Chinese medicinal mushroom \"yun zhi\", Trametes versicolor, traditionally used for (cit. \"replenish essence and qi (vital energy\". Previous studies indicated the potential activity of extracts from culture filtrate of asexual mycelia of T. versicolor in controlling the growth and secondary metabolism (e.g. mycotoxins of plant pathogenic fungi. The quest of active principles produced by T. versicolor, allowed us characterising an exo-polysaccharide released in its culture filtrate and naming it Tramesan. Herein we evaluate the biological activity of Tramesan in different organisms: plants, mammals and plant pathogenic fungi. We suggest that the bioactivity of Tramesan relies mostly on its ability to act as pro antioxidant molecule regardless the biological system on which it was applied.\n\nThe Tinea Hospital in Granada, 1679-1923: an institution with a long history.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGirÃ³n, F; Lozano, C; Serrano-Ortega, S\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe Tinea hospital in Granada, Spain, was a charitable health facility founded in the 17th century and still treating patients well into the 20th century. The hospital accepted patients from anywhere, not only those residing in the surrounding area. We describe the hospital's founding and the characteristics of the patients and caregivers. We also discuss how tinea was considered at the time, including the typology and treatment protocols applied as well as diet and hygiene measures used. It is striking that a hospital so focused on treating a single disease did not produce studies on the condition or on the application of contemporary knowledge to guide treatment.
