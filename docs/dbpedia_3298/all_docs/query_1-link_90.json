        "text": "Howard Kaylan was born Howard Kaplan on June 22, 1947, in New York City.\n\nHe moved to Westchester near LAX with his parents when his father got a job with Hughes Aircraft in the late 1950s. The family lived at 5994 W. 96th Street in a house that no longer exists, having been torn down years later to make room for an LAX parking lot.\n\nBefore there were Crossfires, or Turtles, or Flo & Eddie, or any of Kaylan’s musical ventures, there was Mr. Art Ferguson at Westchester Music Center. He gave clarinet lessons to the young Kaylan for five years.\n\nUnder Ferguson’s tutelage, Kaylan became good enough on the licorice stick to begin playing locally with a local Dixieland jazz band at local shopping centers under the name The Belvederes.\n\nHe also was a member of the Westchester Youth Band, an organized marching band under the direction of Fern Jarris that won honors in parades all over Southern California.\n\nOne of his fellow Youth Band members and Westchester High School classmates was Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme, who later became involved with the Manson Family. She spent 34 years in prison for her Sept. 9, 1975, assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford in Sacramento.\n\nBut all that lie in the future when clarinet student Kaylan, a rock ’n’ roll fan, began to eye an old tenor saxophone during lessons in the practice room at Westchester Music. He convinced Mr. Feguson to let him borrow it so he could practice on it at home.\n\nOne day, he got a call out of the blue from Chuck Portz of The Nightriders, a local band, offering him a spot in the band playing sax, and Kaylan accepted even though he didn’t know Portz at the time.\n\nWhile at Westchester High, Kaylan also sang with the school’s a cappella choir, directed by music teacher Robert Wood, who quickly became Kaylan’s favorite teacher.\n\nWhile in the choir, he met a frizzy-haired young man named Mark Volman. The two hit it off. Volman asked Kaylan if he could also join the Nightriders, even though he didn’t play an instrument at the time. It turned out he also had been taking clarinet lessons at Westchester Music, and switched to alto sax for the Nightriders.\n\nThe Nightriders became The Crossfires, with the same lineup that later would become the first lineup of the Turtles: Mark Volman (alto sax) and Howard Kaylan (tenor sax and vocals), Jim Tucker of Torrance on rhythm guitar, Al Nichol on lead, Chuck Portz on bass, and Don Murray on drums.\n\nThe Crossfires became a popular local surf music band, playing gigs at the Westchester Women’s Club and teen dances at Darby Park Recreation Center in Inglewood.\n\nThey won a battle of the bands at the Revelaire Club at 312 Catalina Avenue in Redondo Beach, owned by local disc jockey Reb Foster, and became the club’s house band.\n\nConfusingly, Kaylan, Volman, Nichol and fellow choir singer Betty McCarty also formed a folk group on the side, the Crosswind Singers, performing in the then-popular style of the Kingston Trio. They were skilled enough to open for local folksinging duo Joe and Eddie at a UCLA concert.\n\nAs for the Crossfires, they released two singles during this era, a pair of surf instrumentals on the tiny Capco label (“Fiberglass Jungle/Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”), and another 45 featuring vocals on the Lucky Token label. “One Potato, Two Potato” was a local hit, especially in the Inland Empire.\n\nKaylan began attending UCLA on a music scholarship, much to the delight of his parents. But he soon found himself far more interested in spinning records as a DJ for the campus radio station than in attending classes.\n\nHis dad was furious when Howard announced he was quitting school to pursue rock music. He promised his parents that if he didn’t have a hit record within a year, he’d return to school.\n\nIn 1965, while still at the Revelaire Club, the Crossfires changed their name and their direction. Influenced by the Beatles and the British Invasion, as well as by Bob Dylan’s new electric sounds, they became the Turtles. When Reb Foster suggested the name to them, they laughed at him at first, but they came around to it eventually.\n\nA small new label, White Whale Records, signed the band. They recorded a folk-rock version of Bob Dylan’s “It Ain’t Me, Babe,” and it immediately became a Top 10 national hit. Kaylan never had to go back to school.\n\nMany more hits would follow: “Let Me Be,” “You Baby,” the No. 1 smash “Happy Together,” “She’d Rather Be With Me,” “You Know What I Mean,” “She’s My Girl,” “Elenore,” “You Showed Me.” All of them made the top 20 on the Billboard charts.\n\nThrough all the hits and many personnel changes, the band was one of the few from the era that never used session musicians on their recordings, unlike the Beach Boys, Byrds, Monkees and dozens of others.\n\nWhy? Because White Whale, their record label, couldn’t afford to hire from the L.A. studio musicians pool known informally as The Wrecking Crew. So it was up to the band, and they proved fully capable of handling the challenge.\n\nThe Turtles toured incessantly, did dozens of TV shows, including the “Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,” “The Ed Sullivan Show” and many others, and made a famous trip to the White House in May 1969 to play a gig at first daughter Patricia Nixon’s birthday party.\n\n(Note: This clip shows the band lip-synching “Happy Together” on the “Smothers Brothers,” followed by a later live performance of “Elenore”:)\n\nWhen the Turtles came to an end in 1970, Kaylan and Volman found their record company White Whale owned the name, and they were unable to perform using it.\n\nThey eventually hooked up with Frank Zappa, who was forming a new touring Mothers of Invention band, and began calling themselves The Pholorescent Leech (Kaylan) and Eddie (Volman), which they soon shortened to Flo and Eddie.\n\nThey toured with Zappa during the “200 Motels” era, released several albums as Flo and Eddie, and played and sung on dozens of recording sessions for everyone from T. Rex to David Cassidy to Alice Cooper to Who drummer Keith Moon’s solo album.\n\nThey won back the rights to use The Turtles name in 1983, and have lovingly curated reissues of the band’s work, including a Rhino Records reissue of the Crossfires material, and have toured the oldies circuit under the Turtles name for years.\n\nNot bad for a couple of kids from Westchester High, which was reorganized and renamed Westchester Enriched Sciences Magnets (WESM) in 2010.\n\nThese days, Kaylan lives in Seattle, Washington, and continues to be involved with music, working on his second solo album. He also wrote the 2003 film, “My Dinner With Jimi,” about his encounter with Jimi Hendrix and other pop stars in England in 1967.\n\nVolman returned to college during the 1990s, earning a bachelor’s degree in communications, followed by a Masters degree in Film Studies and Screenwriting from Loyola Marymount University in Westchester in 1999.\n\nVolman most recently had been teaching in the entertainment studies program at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nEarlier this year, Kaylan announced via Twitter that his longtime compatriot Volman had recovered from a bout with throat cancer.\n\nSources:\n\n“Howard Kaylan: A Turtle Comes out of His Shell,” by Anne M. Raso, Classic Rock Revisited website.\n\n“Mark Volman of the Turtles Declared Cancer-Free,” by Dave Lifton, Ultimate Classic Rock website, Feb. 27, 2016.\n\n“Mark Volman, M.F.A.,” bio, Belmont University website.\n\n“Shell Shocked: My Life with the Turtles, Flo & Eddie, and Frank Zappa, etc….,” by Howard Kaylan with Jeff Tamarkin, Backbeat Books, 2013. (Note: This post could not have been written without this detailed, highly entertaining book.)\n\nWith the arrival of another high school football season, it seems fitting to take a moment to remember longtime San Pedro High football announcer Bill “Tiger” Reese.\n\nWilliam H. Reese was born at the Fort McKenzie military base near Sheridan, Wyoming, where his father was a civil service carpentry worker. In 1921, the family moved to San Pedro, where his father had gotten a similar job at Fort MacArthur.\n\nReese felt at home in San Pedro immediately: “We didn’t have dime, but that never seemed to matter. We always had fun, and the friends I made are still friends today.”\n\nReese attended San Pedro High School, where he earned a letter as a 115-pound right end on the B football team. He graduated in 1935.\n\nHe got his nickname just before World War II. Two of his buddies, Roy Pederson, and Ray Musso, went to San Francisco. While there, they had a fake headline on a newspaper printed up that read “Tiger Reese Drafted — Hitler Runs Like Hell.” The name stuck.\n\nHe served in the Port Battalion during World War II, surviving one enemy attack near Anzio, Italy, that killed 30 of his fellow shipmates. He credited having learned to swim at San Pedro’s Cabrillo Beach for saving his life.\n\nHe became a meter reader with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power after returning home from the war. He worked for the DWP until his retirement in 1978.\n\nHis announcing career seemed unlikely, given his tendency to stutter as a child.\n\nBut he decided to challenge himself when his friend Nick Trani asked him to fill in as announcer for a San Pedro Athletic Club football game in 1946. The semipro team had a 37-game winning streak during the postwar era, playing many memorable games against Blue Tide, a rival team made of area longshoremen.\n\nTurns out, Reese was a natural with a mike in his hand.\n\n“I stuttered as a kid and I was scared of talking in front of crowds,” Reese recalled in 1996. “But I soon discovered that I had no trouble talking into a microphone. It helped cure me.”\n\nIn 1947, Reese was asked to take over announcing chores for San Pedro High School football games. He took the job calling play-by-play at Pirates home games for no pay, and he would do it for 55 years.\n\nNor did he accept pay for announcing Mary Star of the Sea and Los Angeles Harbor College Seahawks’ football games, both of which he did for 52 years. (He also announced at San Pedro track meets and softball games over the years.)\n\nHe had a smooth announcing style. He wasn’t obsessed with statistics, preferring to tell stories, and sometimes referring humorously to his fictional heroic exploits as a San Pedro player. One of his favorite lines after a particularly spectacular play on the field: “That reminds me of a play I made back in 1933.”\n\nHe was also known for his attention to calling out players who made good plays by name during games, and to be recognized from the announcer’s booth by Reese became a badge of honor for Pirate football team members.\n\nReese didn’t take the matter lightly, either, carefully learning names, numbers, and, most importantly, pronunciations of those names. He knew how important it was to the players to get recognition.\n\n“If there’s a gang tackle by the defense or an offensive play with a lot of key blocks, I try to call out as many names as possible,” Reese told the Daily Breeze in 1996. “The kids work hard and they all deserve to be recognized.”\n\nReese had some help in identifying players during games from ex-Pirate gridder Carlos Trevino. Before a 1971 game at Daniels Field, Reese asked Trevino to help him untangle a microphone cord. The two got to talking, and Trevino accepted Reese’s offer to become his spotter during games.\n\nTheir partnership lasted 30 years, with Trevino retiring shortly after Reese did in 2001.\n\nReese credits longtime San Pedro football coach Mike Walsh with helping him to achieve his dream of announcing a football game from the Los Angeles Coliseum.\n\nWalsh fought to get Reese the job when San Pedro played Taft High in the L.A. 4-A City Championship football game at the Coliseum in 1996. The Pirates defeated Taft in a thriller, 22-20, and Reese counted calling the game among the highlights of his career.\n\nReese first considered retirement in 1999. The job had grown tougher with the onset of emphysema, which made climbing the stairs to the press box difficult, and diabetes, which caused his eyesight to begin to fail. He had to wear a hearing aid as well.\n\nEarlier health problems had caused him to miss the only four games he ever missed in his career. He missed the first game of the 1989 season due to a ruptured appendix, and the last three games of the 1998 season due to a mild heart attack.\n\n“The hardest part for me is my deteriorating eyesight,” he told the Daily Breeze in 2001.\n\nReese called his final game, San Pedro’s victory over Narbonne High, on Friday, Nov. 9, 2001.\n\nAlong the way, he had garnered plenty of honors. In 1981, he was named Citizen of the Year by the San Pedro Lions Club. In 1996, he was among the first group of sports figures to be inducted into the San Pedro Sportswalk Hall of Fame.\n\nThat same year, he was selected as grand marshal of the annual San Pedro Christmas Parade. He also received honors from the San Pedro Pirate Booster Club and the Boys and Girls Club, and, in 2001, the press box at the new $3.5 million Daniels Field football stadium was named for him.\n\nAfter some weeks in failing health from cancer, the 87-year-old Reese died on Dec. 30, 2003. An overflow crowd of hundreds of mourners of all ages turned out for his funeral at Green Hills Memorial Park on Jan. 8, 2004. Many had to listen to the services on a public address speaker since the chapel was filled to capacity.\n\n“People in San Pedro loved Tiger,” said former Pirate booster club president Bill Castro at the ceremony.\n\nThree weeks before Reese died, Joe Donato, the former president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 13, had started the drive to rename Daniels Field after the announcer. Getting approval from the city took longer than Donato had envisioned, though, so the honor didn’t come until after Reese’s death.\n\nThe stadium was rededicated on Friday, Sept. 24, 2004, before a game between Mary Star and Cerritos Valley Christian. Then-City Councilwoman Janice Hahn joined members of Reese’s family, including his wife, Mary, in announcing that the field would now be known as “Tiger Reese Stadium at Daniels Field.”\n\nSources:\n\nDaily Breeze files.\n\nSAN PEDRANS REMEMBER TIGER REESE\n\n“He’s probably the best high school announcer I’ve ever seen.”\n\n— Sam Domancich\n\n“When he called your name, it was like you were somebody. He made you feel important and he made you play harder because he just might announce your name to everybody.”\n\n— Former San Pedro football player Edward Grageda\n\n“He went beyond. He was a color commentator as well as an announcer.”\n\n— Former San Pedro football coach Henry Pacheco\n\n“Tiger was always a gentleman and always had a smile. He greeted everybody and was never too busy to acknowledge someone.”\n\n— Rino Marconi, San Pedro Pirate Booster Club\n\n“Tiger always knew that every time he announced a name in that mike, he was making someone’s life special.”\n\n— Pirate booster club member Xavier Hermosillo\n\n“Sitting side by side in the press box, he was always telling me stories about the family, about the kids. That was his life. I’m truly going to miss him.”\n\n— Longtime spotter Carlos Trevino\n\n“Announcing was the best thing that ever happened to him. He absolutely loved it — the best thing that ever happened to him.”\n\n— Mary Reese, his wife of 42 years.\n\nIn April 1967, a group of investors with German roots announced a plan to bring a bit of Bavaria to the South Bay.\n\nThe members of the German South Bay Club Inc. planned to build a theme park of sorts on the eastern outskirts of Torrance that would celebrate German culture, food and drink, and make products from Germany that they loved – everything from sausages to dirndls to imported crystal – available locally.\n\nAlpine Village opened in late 1968, in time to advertise its wares to Christmas shoppers that year, on 13 acres of unincorporated Los Angeles County land at 833 West Torrance Boulevard, between Vermont and Hamilton avenues near the 110 Freeway. The village always has been associated with Torrance; it has a Torrance mailing address even though technically it’s located outside the city limits.\n\nWhen it first opened, the village consisted of a main hall/restaurant, and several specialty shops.\n\nOn June 15, 1969, Alpine Village Park, as it billed itself, held a Bavarian song and dance festival featuring traditional German music and “imported Bavarian beer” priced at 10 cents with your paid $1.00 admission fee.\n\nEvents such as this met with great success, and led to Alpine Village’s first Oktoberfest celebration that fall.\n\nThe original Oktoberfest began in Germany as part of the wedding celebration of Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, and was held on the outskirts of Munich, Germany, on Oct. 12, 1810. The festivities included a giant festival, horse races and additional events that attracted thousands.\n\nWhen the decision was made to hold the festival as an annual event starting in 1811, Oktoberfest was born. It grew larger, more public and much more beer-centric over time, interrupted only by the world wars of the 20th century. Following World War II, the modern version of Oktoberfest, 16 days of celebration starting in late September, resumed once more. The festivities began with a 12-gun salute and ceremonial tapping of the first beer keg in 1950, practices still followed today.\n\nAlpine Village recognized the need to bring this popular European custom to German immigrants (and anyone else who wanted to come), and held its first Oktoberfest on Sept. 26-28, 1969. An ad in the L.A. Times calls it “October Fest,” perhaps to make the event more understandable to non-Germans.\n\nThe celebration was a great success, drawing 32,000 visitors over the three days in 1969.\n\nThe festival expanded to two weekends in 1970, and 24-year-old Noel Steever of Beverly Hills was named Oktoberfest queen following the inagural beauty contest that same year. A festival-opening German-style parade was added to the festivities in 1973.\n\nOver the years, Oktoberfest has included traditional German bands, stein-carrying contests, a wood-sawing competition, and, of course, the chicken dance:\n\nAlpine Village began expanding in the early 1970s. On Aug. 1, 1971, it opened the “Alpine Farm Fairytale Land” for children, and a new beer garden for adults.\n\nThe Alpine Farm had a petting zoo, animal show. live pony rides, a merry-go-round and other rides for children. 22 shops and the well-stocked Alpine Market sold specialty foods and other items.\n\nThe village hosted all types of ethnic bands, especially “oompapa” outfits, but also other bands playing traditional ethnic music. Festivals were added throughout the year, including a Sausage Festival in June, a May Festival, a wine festival and others.\n\nLive entertainment also included magic shows as well as folk music concerts and even the occasional rock band.\n\nIn 1978, the Carson Batting Cages opened on the Alpine Village property, and the parking lot also became host to a popular swap meet in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1981, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors denied a plan to add helicopter rides to Alpine Village’s entertainment menu, reversing an early planning commission decision to allow a heliport to be built at the village. Residents of the nearby Ponderosa Pines condominium project that had been built next to Alpine Village already were complaining about noise from the village, and actively campaigned against the heliport idea.\n\nIn 1982, Alpine Village began booking punk-rock concerts into its main hall in the Alpine Steinhaus restaurant and a smaller nearby room. Local lads The Last played two shows there that year. Other bills included one show with Saccharine Trust, Salvation Army and San Pedro’s legendary Minutemen, while another featured the Salvation Army paired with South Bay stalwarts The Descendents.\n\nA major controversy brewed on Oct. 25, 1985, when a security guard asked four neo-Nazis, Stanley Witek, Gene Loven, Joe Fields and Hal Follin, to remove their Nazi regalia while the quartet dined in the main Alpine Village restaurant. The men refused, allegedly used racial epithets against the black security guard who made the request and challenged him to fight.\n\nThe owners of Alpine Village stood behind the decision to eject the men, while the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on the quartet’s behalf charging the restaurant with violating their civil rights.\n\nThe suit dragged on until March 10, 1988 when a Superior Court judge ruled against Alpine Village, saying it didn’t have the right to refuse service to the men because of what they were wearing.\n\nIn July 1988, Alpine Village began brewing its own beer. Gunther Buerk took over the fledgling operation after the original braumeister Fritz Lippert had to return to Germany days before the first batch of suds was produced. The new operation was successful nonetheless.\n\nUnder general manager Hans Rotter and his wife, Teri, Oktoberfest grew to become one of the South Bay’s most popular festivals. After hosting Oktoberfest for 38 years, the Rotters were fired in 2008. The couple had grand ambitions to develop the site further, including the addition of a 300-room hotel to be built above Alpine Village’s restaurant and bar.\n\nWithout securing proper demolition permits, the Rotters began implementing their plans, which included tearing up much of the 1,373-space parking lot, closing the swap meet for a time. It later reopened in a much smaller space. Even more controversial was the demolition of the beloved Carson Batting Cages, which were bulldozed after its operators lost their lease in May 2008.\n\nRumors swirled that the aging park might shut down and be razed for new development, but its directors righted the ship and continued its traditions.\n\nIn 2009, new manager Gerald King ended Alpine Village’s contract with longtime supplier Angel City Brewing Co., which chose to move its operations from the location to downtown Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2010, new general manager Otto Radtke, who recently left the post to start the Great Society Cider & Mead cidery in Long Beach, got Alpine Village in on the burgeoning food truck craze, bringing the popular wagons in for Wednesday nights. He also began booking bands again, hoping customers would be attracted both by the music and the trendy food trucks.\n\nAfter nearly 66,000 attended the 2010 Oktoberfest, Alpine Village began to make a concerted effort to deal with noise and people problems caused by the celebration’s popularity.\n\n3,000 square feet of noise-absorbing vinyl sheets were installed, and loudspeakers were positioned to face east toward the 110 Freeway instead of towards neighboring residences. Security guards were hired to reduce loitering and other problems in surrounding neighborhoods caused by Oktoberfest revelers.\n\nThis year’s Oktoberfest will be here before you know it, running from Sept. 9 to Oct. 23, 2016. Visit the Alpine Village website for more details.\n\nSources:\n\nDaily Breeze files.\n\nLos Angeles Times files.\n\nAlpine Village website, www.alpinevillagecenter.com.\n\nNote: This post has been updated to indicate that Otto Radtke has left Alpine Village.\n\nWhen Greg Noll, then 66, spoke at his induction into the inaugural class of Hermosa Beach’s Surfers Walk of Fame in 2003, he observed how strange it was to be honored for spending his life doing what he loved.\n\nModesty aside, few deserved the honors as much as Noll, who was not only a pioneering big wave surfer, but a legendary board shaper, a filmmaker, a commercial fisherman and a successful businessmen and entrepreneur who became one of the sport’s most respected figures.\n\nNicknamed “Da Bull” for his muscular 6-foot-2 frame and aggressive surfing style, Noll was born on Feb. 11, 1937, in San Diego. His parents divorced when he was 6, and Noll moved to Manhattan Beach with his mother.\n\nThe young Noll loved the beach, and found a job cutting bait for fishermen at the Manhattan Beach Pier. He gravitated toward the Manhattan Beach Surf Club, a group of surfers that included surfing pioneer Dale Velzy. The surfers had a small clubhouse that the city allowed them to use located underneath the pier.\n\nNoll used to drive Velzy crazy by hanging around the clubhouse watching boards being shaped, picking up tools and trying to figure out how it was done. He would also watch Velzy, Jack Wise, Larry Felker, future Body Glove founders Bill and Bob Meistrell, and other surf club members catching waves by the pier.\n\nSeeing their exploits inspired him to buy his first surfboard, made of solid redwood, for $15 at age 11. In his autobiography, “Da Bull: Life Over the Edge,” Noll writes about his struggle to get the board, which weighed at least as much as he did as an 11-year-old, down the steps at the pier and into the ocean, a process that could take 45 minutes. Riding it also was a challenge; Noll claims to have spent most of his first summer mastering the art of riding the huge board.\n\nHe also served an informal apprenticeship in board shaping under Velzy, who eventually opened the first retail surfboard shop in the world in Manhattan Beach in 1950.\n\nBy his junior year at Mira Costa High School, Noll was hopelessly hooked on the surfing life. He had a friendly rivalry with a group of Hermosa Beach surfers, who told him about the North Shore of Hawaii.\n\nNoll somehow convinced his mom that one of the older Hermosa surfers, Billy Meng, could act as his guardian if he moved to Makaha in Hawaii, where he promised to finish his senior year of high school. He managed to do that at nearby Waipahu High, but he spent most of the time exploring the fantastic waves at various spots along the North Shore.\n\nHawaii’s big waves captivated him, as they did the generations of surfers who followed in his footsteps to Makaha, Waimea Bay, Pipeline and other legendary island surfing spots.\n\nIn 1956, Noll was a member of an American surf paddling team invited to participate in a contest being held during the Melbourne Summer Olympics. By then, he had graduated to shorter, lighter balsa wood boards, which his team introduced to the Australians, who had never seen them. The modern boards helped turn the country on to surfing, and it eventually became one of the sport’s most important locations.\n\nWhile in Australia, Noll also began his career as a surf documentary filmmaker, shooting footage of his friends catching waves. (In a future post, we’ll explore the pre-“Endless Summer” surf film phenomenon.)\n\nHe married his wife, Beverly, whom he had met while at Mira Costa, after returning from Melbourne. He credits her with inspiring him to open a surfboard business. He was working as a Manhattan Beach lifeguard, and spending his off hours shaping new boards in his garage.\n\nAfter opening small stores first in Manhattan, and then in Hermosa, Noll went all in and built a 20,000-square-foot surfboard factory and storefront at 1502 Pacific Coast Highway in Hermosa Beach in October 1965. Greg Noll Surfboards thrived at the location for six years, until Noll closed up shop in 1971.\n\nOne of his workers at the shop was a young surfer named Eddie Talbot, who credits Noll for giving him the knowledge and experience to open his own surf shop in 1972. E.T. Surfboards went on to become one of the most successful surf shops in California, and is still going strong at 904 Aviation Boulevard in Hermosa.\n\nIn 1964, Noll did another kind of film work as the stunt man doing the actual surfing at Waimea Bay for actor James Mitchum’s character Eskimo in the Hollywood film “Ride the Wild Surf.”\n\nBut the surfing exploit that truly made him a legend occurred on Dec. 4, 1969. The 32-year-old Noll had now been riding big waves in Hawaii, especially at Waimea, for more than a dozen years when he woke up one morning to hear what later would be described as “The Swell of the Century” hitting the North Shore.\n\nHe watched as giant breakers pounded the shore, and knew he had to head to Makaha Beach. He noticed some surfers in the roiling waters, but none outside where the waves were the biggest. “I just figured I had an edge, since all my surfing had been devoted to big waves,” he wrote in his autobiography.\n\nThe wave he paddled out and caught has since passed into legend. He described it as 10 feet higher than any wave he’d ever ridden, perhaps as high as 40 feet. To this day, most surf historians agree it was the largest wave ever caught by a surfer paddling out on his own power. (Big-wave surfers at Mavericks and other spots have caught plenty of large waves since, but are usually dropped in by helicopter or towed to the waves on jet skis.)\n\nSo why not check the footage and/or photos of this incredible ride to verify it? Because none exists. No photos or video of the ride have ever surfaced.\n\nIn a curious subplot, South African surfer Shaun Tomson was watching from shore that day, and shooting movie film of the incredible conditions with his Super 8 movie camera. He may or may not have captured Noll’s legendary ride on film. If he did, he’s not talking. Filmmaker Stacy Peralta approached Tomson while making his 2004 documentary, “Riding Giants.” Tomson shared his reels of film from that day with Peralta, the footage leading right up to Noll’s ride before the film went blank.\n\n“I think it’s better that myths are shrouded in secrecy and the unknown,” Tomson told the Steve Hawk of the L.A. Times in 2004. “That’s what myths are all about.”\n\n(Note: Noll’s name is misspelled in video title. The video is an excerpt from Stacy Peralta’s 2004 big-wave documentary, “Riding Giants.”)\n\nHowever big the wave might have been, it secured Noll’s place forever in surfing history. And he almost didn’t make it back to shore in the wave’s violent aftermath.\n\nThe experience seemed to cure Noll’s fever for riding big waves, and may have led to his decision to close his Hermosa Beach shop and move to Northern California, where he became a commercial fisherman in Crescent City.\n\nHe also has continued to shape boards over the years, producing a line of high-end replicas of historic wooden surfboards.\n\nNow 79, he has been inducted into surfing halls of fame not only in Hermosa in 2003, but also in Huntington Beach, and has a marker on San Pedro’s Sportswalk to the Waterfront. He still lives in Crescent City.\n\nHe told Daily Breeze reporter Phil Collin in 2009, “It’s a neat thing to look back on it and say I had a good life. I owe it all back to the ocean.”\n\nSources:\n\n“Da Bull: Life Over the Edge,” by Greg Noll and Andrera Gabbard, North Atlantic Books, 1989.\n\nDaily Breeze files.\n\n“Greg Noll: ‘Da Bull,'” from the Legendary Surfers: A Definitive History of Surfing’s Culture and Heroes website, by Malcolm Gault-Williams.

Doak was born in San Antonio, Texas. on Jan. 6, 1898.\n\nRelatives remember that as a young boy, Doak would be fascinated by wind patterns during violent storms, studying how the air movement affected objects, while others sought shelter and feared for their lives.\n\nHis family moved to California in December 1910, and like many an aerospace industry pioneer, Doak was entranced by the Dominguez Air Meet held In Carson. He missed the first one, held in 1910, but met aircraft company owner Glenn L. Martin at the 1911 meet. Martin offered him a future job at his Los Angeles factory.\n\nHired in 1913 at the age of 15, the new messenger boy met aerospace men such as Donald Douglas, and Bell Aircraft founder Lawrence Bell in the course of his job. He rose quickly in the industry, becoming purchasing agent for Douglas’ aerospace firm in 1922, a position he held until 1935.\n\nHe moved to North American Aviation in Inglewood for the next two years, where he helped revamp that company’s facilities as Factory Manager. He returned to Douglas in 1937, where, among other things, he headed the development of the DC-5 transport plane.\n\nDoak left Douglas in 1939 to form his own company, along with 10 other men. Doak Aircraft Company began in leased quarters in Hermosa Beach.\n\nDoak had foreseen the possibility that steel might be at a premium with the possibility of America’s entrance into the war, and began working with aluminum and molded plywood. Doak built the DRD-1 training plane for military and civilian use, as well as fabricating aircraft parts for larger planes.\n\nDoak Aircraft shortly became an in-demand military contractor, and quickly had to find additional manufacturing quarters. In 1940, the company opened its Torrance plant at 223rd Street and Western Avenue, in the general area now occupied by a Lowe’s hardware superstore. The company’s official Torrance address was 2321 Abalone Avenue.\n\nIn 1942, Doak shrewdly signed an agreement with Kroehler, a major furniture manufacturing firm, to facilitate the building of wood-based aviation products and parts.\n\nBy the end of the war, Doak was Torrance’s largest employer, employing upwards of 2,000 workers.\n\nIn 1945, the plant won the Army-Navy “E” (for excellence) award, given to manufacturers whose work for the military was deemed consistently outstanding. A bevy of military brass turned out for the occasion that August.\n\nIn the years following the war’s end, Doak’s company turned to making patio furniture for Kroehler, while Doak himself continued to explore his ideas for new kinds of airplanes.\n\nHe’d always been fascinated by helicopters, and puzzled over an idea that would combine a helicopter’s small landing space with an airplane’s capacity for longer, faster forward flying.\n\nDoak envisioned propellers housed in ducts on the end of an airplane wing that could lift the transport plane off the ground, then rotate into a forward position to move the plane into flight once it was in the air. In 1954, his company began developing the idea in earnest.\n\nHere’s how it worked:\n\nThe idea, known as Vertical Take-Off and Landing, or VTOL, also was of great interest to the military.\n\nOn April 13, 1956, the U.S. Army announced the awarding of joint contracts to Fairchild Aircraft in Maryland and Torrance’s Doak Aircraft for the development of an experimental VTOL plane.\n\nOver the next two years, Doak worked on developing the prototype plane, which the company called the Doak Model 16, at its hangars at Torrance Municipal Airport. Ground testing at Torrance began in early February 1958.\n\nOn Feb. 25, 1958, the Doak Model 16 successfully completed its first free hovering flight at the airport, impressing the Army officials in attendance. The plane was moved to Edwards Air Force Base for further testing in October 1958. These later flights marked the first rigorous tests of any American VTOL plane.\n\nA year later, in October, 1959, the Army, pleased with the results, announced the acceptance of the plane, renamed it the VZ-4, and moved it to NASA facilities at Langley AFB in Maryland.\n\nDoak envisioned not only military, but also civilian use for his creation. telling The Daily Breeze before the Feburary 1958 test:\n\n“Ducted propeller aircraft of this type, with vertical take-off and long range, and high speed, can provide the commercial feeder line service needed to carry traffic between the few major landing fields along the paths of the big non-sto airliners and the many smaller outlying cities having no huge, jet-age airports.”\n\nIt was a grand idea that could have revolutionized commercial aviation, but it never came to pass.\n\nThe Army and NASA continued to test the VZ-4 until 1960, when the U.S. Congress stepped in, decreeing that henceforth, the Air Force would develop airplanes, and the Army, helicopters. The VZ-4 was classified as an airplane, but the Air Force showed little interest in its development, not even inviting Doak to bid in its VTOL competition.\n\nDoak Aircraft had lost its only major customer, and had no further prospects of developing its owner’s dream plane. Disillusioned, Doak closed the company permanently in 1960.\n\nThe VZ-4 prototype ended up on display at a military museum at Fort Eustis, Virginia.\n\nThe Royal Air Force would experiment with the VTOL concept with its Harrier jet fighter in the 1950s and 1960s, and the U.S. Air Force began developing its Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey program in 1986. Production began in 2005, and, by 2008, costs had risen to an estimated $27 billion, with an addition $27 billion expected to be spent on future production: each plane costs an estimated $73 million.\n\nDoak partisans always claimed that the government would have saved some cash and been better off had they given Doak’s aircraft a longer look.\n\nAs for Doak, he continued to tinker with ideas on a smaller scale at a workshop on Madrid Avenue in Old Torrance, including, among other projects, an air-cushion flying saucer-like vehicle that would float a one-foot air bubble above water or land, a concept on which he had first taken out a patent in 1956.\n\nDoak lived in Beverly Hills for years, moving to Rolling Hills later in life. Known as “The Chief” and “Big Daddy” to his friends, Doak died on Oct. 20, 1986, at the age of 88. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.\n\nHis friend and colleague Wallace Perry told the Daily Breeze at the time of Doak’s death:\n\n“He made aviation history, a true pioneer. He built his own wind tunnel, and proved that his ducted-fan airplane could really work. He even experimented with developing flying saucers. He spent $300,000 of his own money developing the Doak 16, which at that time was a tremendous amount of money. … All of his friends admired him so much, missing him aren’t even the words.”\n\nSources:\n\nDaily Breeze files.\n\n“Doak Family Website: Memorabilia,” republishing excerpts from “A Little History of Doak Aircraft,” by Chuck Lobb, originally published in Torrance People magazine.\n\n“Doak VZ-4,” Aviastar website, taken from “Straight Up: A History of Vertical Flight,” S.

In the early 1920s, a social organization called The Surf and Sand Club was formed to help promote the beach burg’s attractive stretch of shoreline as a tourist destination.\n\nIn March 1923, club members announced plans to build a four-story “clubhouse” on a plot of land on The Strand between 14th and 15th streets. Its features would include an indoor swimming pool, a grill, bowling alley, billiard and card rooms, a large dining room, and sleeping quarters on the third and fourth floors.\n\nArchitect Myron Hunt designed the new structure, which would be Hermosa’s first (and pretty much last) high-rise building, and J.A. Wolvin Co. was hired as its contractor.\n\nBy the time preliminary renderings of the project were released a month later, the planned building had grown to six stories. It would ultimately grow to eight stories.\n\nClub President Ralph E. Matteson directed the project, which resulted in a flood of memberships in the Surf and Sand Club from all over Southern California. 250 memberships were sold almost immediately; that number would top 1000 with the project’s completion a couple of years later.\n\nConstruction began on the project in December 1923.\n\nOn May 17, 1924, a dedication ceremony was held at the clubhouse, and a cornerstone was laid. Construction wasn’t complete; only the first two floors had been worked on extensively, but the club wanted to show members the progress that had been made.\n\nThe club opened its doors to members in June 1925, and held a ceremony noting the opening that July 4. But it still was unfinished; some furnishings still hadn’t been put in place due to shipping complications.\n\nIn March 1926, the Surf and Sand Club declared that its $800,000 “clubhouse” had been fully furnished and equipped, and was now officially completed.\n\nIt quickly became the focal point of the city’s growing beach culture scene, and one of the South Bay coast’s most visible landmarks.\n\nA factor that hurt the club’s success was that it didn’t own the beach that lie directly in front of it. That belonged to the city, so the club could not transform it into a private beach, as other beach clubs along the Southern California coast had done.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, beach goers in front of the Surf and Sand were shocked when Mary Wilson appeared on the sand in “a very abbreviated and daringly cut” swimsuit on March 27, 1929. Police Chief Eddie Messenger immediately arrested her and hauled her into court, where she received a stern warning and released, despite her protestations that such suits would soon be all the rage. Sadly, no pictures of the offending swimwear survive.\n\nAfter its big start, economics forced the Surf and Sand Club to merge with the Los Angeles Athletic Club in September 1929, and at some point in the early 1930s, the Biltmore Hotel chain took ownership of the club. It became a public hotel, though it continued to operate under the Surf and Sand Club name for several years.\n\nAs late as 1935, the Surf and Sand Club still was trying to fence off the beach in front of its seaside clubhouse and make it private, but the city refused to accept the proposal.\n\nAnother proposal, this one from the federal government, was implemented on Jan. 5, 1939. The New Deal agency known as the National Youth Administration (NYA), took possession of the hotel, by this time known as the Hermosa Biltmore Hotel, with plans to use it as a dormitory and work unit. Youths would be housed there and then transported to Los Angeles-area sites for vocational training.\n\nThe plan met with stiff resistance from Hermosans. Despite 1,400 protest from residents, the plan to house 400 students seeking job training stayed in place for several months. The government finally backed away from the plan, citing the hotel’s location as limiting and removing the student residents on Aug. 15, 1939.\n\nThe hotel struggled in the years following World War II, with a succession of different owners taking charge between 1949 and 1961. It became run-down in the process, its owners unable to provide for its upkeep.\n\nOn Nov. 29, 1963, the deteriorating structure was sold to Rev. Clarence T. (Kelly) Walberg and his Cup of Cold Water Ministry, Inc., a religious group with grand plans to turn the Biltmore into a world headquarters for its evangelical movement and missionary operations.\n\nThe group’s plans included onsite retail stores that would sell products imported from the religious group’s worldwide missionary sites in order to finance its operations.\n\nIt also planned to reach out to youth. A hootenanny and a surfing contest were part of the March 23, 1964, grand opening of Stub’s Pub, a youth center on the site of the former Biltmore’s cocktail lounge.\n\nEventually, however, the roof fell in on Cup of Cold Water.\n\nWalberg and his partner, Rev. Wayne Davidson, were indicted by the Los Angeles County Grand Jury on July 6, 1966, on charges of violating securities laws.\n\nThey were convicted of 10 counts on Jan. 24, 1967, and Cup of Cold Water was no more.\n\nOwnership of the property reverted to the city of Hermosa Beach following the 1966 indictment.\n\nIt continued to deteriorate at a rapid rate during the next three years, becoming little more than a crash-pad haven for hippies and street people of the era, who were blamed for a 1968 fire that destroyed much of the building’s second floor.\n\nDemolition of the now-decrepit building finally took place in 1969.\n\nThe city was left with an empty plot of land. Now all city fathers had to do was decide on how best to use it.\n\nHow hard could that be?\n\nWell, here’s a list of possible uses for the Biltmore site that were debated endlessly in meetings, planning sessions and public forums of various kinds for the next 20 years. Several were voted on as city ballot measures, and none of them came to fruition:\n\n1970: High-rise, multi-use building\n\n1972: A complete medical center/clinic\n\n1973: Beachside parking lot\n\n1975: 40 oil wells\n\n1975: Three-story hotel spa and restaurant\n\n1977: Skateboard park\n\n1983: 49-unit time-share condominium complex\n\n1983: Seven-story hotel with 175 rooms\n\n1984: A hotel and conference center\n\n1988: A hotel with bath house and spa\n\n1989: Mix of open space for public plaza, residential and commercial development\n\n1989: A park and play area built around an old fire truck\n\n1990: 8 beachfront homes, proceeds to buy Santa Fe right of way for Greenbelt\n\nProposition H, a city proposal to sell the property for commercial development, passed by 40 votes in 1991, but the decision made residents and community activists uneasy.\n\nThey wanted another vote. In 1992, at the urgings of green space advocate Parker Herriott, the Hermosa Beach City Council placed Proposition D on the November ballot.\n\nIn the Nov. 3, 1992. election, 63 percent of the city’s voters approved Proposition D, Herriott’s plan to transform the disputed plot into a landscaped city park.\n\nDespite the seemingly final decision, debate over the site continued, of course.\n\nIn August 1994, the Council decided to nix a proposal to ask the city’s voters again what they wanted to do with the vacant land between 14th and 15th streets, and to go ahead with the Prop D plans to develop the park. Had they sent the land’s fate back to the voters, it would have been the 15th time since 1972 that voters would have been asked to pass judgment on a Biltmore site-related measure.\n\nEven Councilman Sam Edgerton, who was not a strong supporter of the park proposal, said of the issue, “It’s like a comic book series. It’s time to move on.”\n\nBut three years after the park decision, debate continued on the site’s future. In July 1995, Councilman Robert Benz called the as-yet-unfinished park “the most insane idea for a park I’ve ever seen.”\n\nBenz wanted to sell the land for commercial development and use the money to help fund the city’s downtown renovation plans. He was outvoted, and Biltmore Park came closer to becoming a reality.\n\nA couple weeks after Benz’s remarks, Hermosa residents Joe and Betty Noble donated $90,000 to cover the remaining construction costs for the park, and in return, the green space was renamed Noble Park. It was dedicated on Sept. 22, 1995.\n\nSources:\n\nDaily Breeze files.\n\nFootnotes on the Sand: An Incomplete Compendium, an Arbitrary Selection of Events, Rumor, Speculation, Some Fact and Some Fiction About Hermosa Beach, by Patricia A. Gazin, self-published, 1991.\n\nLos Angeles Times files.\n\nJack L. Warner and his fellow movie moguls from Hollywood’s Golden Age were no dummies.\n\nEven though the country had plunged into the Great Depression in 1929, Warner went ahead with plans to build several lavish movie palaces, shrewdly taking advantage, along with his competitors at Fox and other studios, of lower construction costs in the Los Angeles area.\n\nWarner knew that cheap entertainment would be an even more valuable commodity during hard economic times. (Before a 1948 antitrust ruling, movie studios also had a lucrative business arrangement, owning and booking the theaters that showed their films.)\n\nOne of the Warner Theatres he built during this era was the Warner San Pedro Theatre, built on a vacant lot at 478 W. 6th Street in downtown San Pedro.\n\nGround was broken for the new theater on June 18, 1930. Warner himself wielded a ceremonial shovel, along with San Pedro Chamber of Commerce president Leslie Mott.\n\nA handful of movie stars made the trip down to the Harbor Area for the ceremony, most notably Loretta Young and Walter Pidgeon, both in the early stages of their careers.\n\nWarner had bought the 150 x 125-foot lot for $150,000. The Warner San Pedro, which he dubbed “The Castle of Your Dreams,” ultimately would cost $500,000 dollars to build.\n\nThe art deco building was designed by architect B. Marcus Priteca and artist Anthony Heinsbergen, the same team behind Hollywood’s Pantages Theater, another landmark still in operation.\n\nIt featured elaborate wood carvings on its ceilings, art deco light fixtures, wall tapestries and an ornate stage curtain.\n\nIts much-ballyhooed grand opening took place on Tuesday, Jan. 20, 1931. Actor-singer Frank Fay was the evening’s master of ceremonies who introduced Jack Warner, who spoke to the thousands of people who turned up for the event.\n\nFay was married to actress Barbara Stanwyck at the time, and helped the then-struggling actress in her career. When his own career faltered later in the 1930s as her star rose, some speculated that their story was the basis for the 1937 film “A Star Is Born,” which traces similar career arcs for its main characters.\n\n“Going Wild,” a comedy starring the popular, elastic-faced actor and comedian Joe E. Brown, was the first feature to screen at the Warner San Pedro, whose 2,000 seats were all filled for the event. (Its seating capacity would later be reduced to 1,500.)\n\nThe theater was built to accommodate the staging of entertainment such as vaudeville and live theater productions, but in its early years, it served mostly as a movie house.\n\nSome say the theater was the first to be built in the South Bay/Harbor Area fully equipped for sound films, still a relatively new phenomenon at the time.\n\nIt became a popular community venue, though it struggled a bit as the Depression wore on. Renamed The San Pedro Theater in 1937, the movie house’s fortunes improved during the war years of the 1940s, drawing customers from military-based operations at the nearby port and shipyards.\n\nIn 1953, Warner Bros. had to split off its theater chain as a result of the 1948 Supreme Court ruling breaking the studio’s hold on distribution. Its Stanley Warner Corporation subsidiary took ownership of the theater, which became variously known as the Stanley Warner San Pedro Theatre, the Warner Theatre, and the Stanley Warner Theatre. In 1968, the Pacific Theatres chain took over ownership of the property.\n\nBy 1975, Ron McNulty was operating the venue under his Torrance company, PMP, but his attempt to revive the theater’s fortunes were unsuccessful, and he was forced to close it in December 1975. He had been approached by porn distributors wanting to sublet the theater for X-rated films, but declined.\n\nDuring these years, the theater would operate for a while, then close and be boarded up, only to be revived again under a revolving door of owners.\n\nArnulfo Estrada bought the theater in 1978, turning it into a Spanish-language movie house called Teatro Juarez, but it failed to thrive enough to keep it open.\n\nIn the early 1980s, its historical value began to be recognized. In 1982, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board designated the theater as a historical landmark.\n\nIn 1984, Estrada enlisted San Pedro real estate broker Nick Papadakis to find a buyer for the theater.\n\nPapadakis fielded several offers, including two serious proposals to turn the grand old cinema into an X-rated movie house.\n\nIt would have been a move counter to the community’s desire to revitalize San Pedro’s downtown area, and Papadakis advised Estrada instead to sell the theater to former Mann’s Chinese manager Raymond Howell.\n\nHowell renamed the 15,000-square-foot theater the Warner Grand, and planned to offer quality second-run films and performing arts offerings.\n\nThe Warner Grand still struggled financially, though, and in 1988, Howell stopped regular film screenings, instead renting it out only occasionally for live performances and film festivals.\n\nRock singer Lee Michaels bought the building in December 1991, with plans to turn it into a dinner theater. That never came to pass, and in 1995, Michaels offered it for sale as a potential church property. An idea to turn it into an indoor swap meet also was floated.\n\nLos Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. convinced the city to buy the property. The Community Redevelopment Agency purchased it for $1.2 million in 1996.\n\nDedicated community members formed the Grand Vision Foundation, a grass-roots group aimed at reorganizing and operating the theater under its new ownership.\n\nPlenty of work still remained to be done on the theater, which had antiquated seats and insufficient heating and cooling equipment. Using mostly private funds, the venue gradually was spruced up in these and other ways over the years.\n\nThe Grand Vision Foundation saw the Warner Grand as a community center for not just films, but live performances from the Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities, the Golden State Pops Orchestra, the San Pedro City Ballet, and even the occasional live popular music act.\n\nIts efforts met with growing success. The Warner Grand added the Grand Annex in a storefront building just east of the theater at 434 W. 6th Street, designing the smaller club-style space for intimate concerts and adventurous film screenings.\n\nIn time, everything from Port of Los Angeles High School graduations to community meetings on crime prevention have been held at the Warner Grand, along with its wide variety of cultural offerings that have included live theater, classical music, opera, ballet and rock concerts. And, all along, its benefactors have continued to renovate and upgrade the venerable theater.\n\nCooling and heating systems were upgraded in 2004, a major interior renovation including all new seating was completed in 2006, and its original 32-foot-high, 52-foot-wide stage curtain was rediscovered in 2014. Plans to recondition the curtain so that it can be reused safely — it was originally was coated with asbestos to make it fireproof — are ongoing.\n\nA pre-dawn fire broke out in the string of storefront buildings just west of the Warner Grand on Nov. 2, 2015, destroying the buildings. Firefighters kept the blaze from reaching the theater itself. Its thick concrete walls, which had no openings to the nearby buildings, helped firefighters save the structure, which suffered only minor smoke damage. The affected buildings were a total loss, and had to be razed.\n\nAt 85 years and still going strong, the Warner Grand is a true survivor, one of the last remaining 1930s movie palaces still standing in its mostly original form.\n\nSources:\n\nDaily Breeze files.\n\nLos Angeles Times files.\n\n“Warner Grand Theatre,” Cinema Treasures website.\n\n“Warner Grand Theatre,” by the Los Angeles Conservancy, Los Angeles Conservancy web site.\n\n“Warner Grand Theatre: ‘The Castle of Your Dreams,” by Tanner Jackson, blog post.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers aren’t just the longest-running brother act in show business; they also qualify as the longest-lived comedy team in modern history.\n\nThe famous Redondo Union High School grads were born at the Fort Jay army hospital on Governors Island in New York to Thomas B. Smothers Jr., and his wife, Ruth. Smothers was a career Army officer who graduated from West Point.\n\nThomas, better known as Tom or Tommy, was born first on Feb. 2, 1937. Richard “Dick” Smothers followed on Nov. 20, 1938. Their younger sister, Sherry, was born in September 1941.\n\nTheir dad, then a major, was taken prisoner while fighting overseas against the Japanese in World War II. He died in a POW camp in Japan.\n\nRuth, whose maiden name was Remick, raised her children in the Los Angeles area. They were living on Via Linda Vista in the Hollywood Riviera section of Torrance when the boys reached high school age.\n\nTom enrolled in Redondo Union High School, where he was active in athletics, competing on the parallel bars in gymnastics and as a pole vaulter for the track team. He was also something of a class clown, known even then for his quick sense of humor. After graduation in 1955, he enrolled in San Jose State College, as San Jose State University was known then.\n\nDick Smothers followed his brother into Redondo Union High, where he graduated in 1957. He also participated in track as a distance runner for the Sea Hawks.\n\nBoth brothers, especially Dick, still speak glowingly of Redondo teacher Ted Misenheimer, who probably deserves his own blog entry. A science teacher by trade, Misenheimer also started The Madrigal Singers vocal group at Redondo that the brothers participated in.\n\nDick described Misenheimer as “the Mr. Holland of the school,” after the inspirational character played by Richard Dreyfuss in the film “Mr. Holland’s Opus.”\n\nDick participated in performing arts at Redondo as well. In a 1995 Daily Breeze interview with staff writer Sandra Kreiswirth, he recalled singing “When I’m Not Near the Girl I Love” from the show “Finian’s Rainbow” for a talent show at the school.\n\nHe would follow Tom up north after graduation, also enrolling in San Jose State College.\n\nThe brothers started singing together, playing for $4 a night at the Kerosene Club, a small venue in San Jose aimed at attracting students from the nearby college.\n\nWhile playing in Aspen, Colorado, in the late 1950s, they began focusing their attention on folk music. Its popularity had been growing, with such acts as The Kingston Trio rising to prominence. But their act would evolve into something quite a bit different from the straightforward folk performers, though Dick’s tenor and Tom’s harmonies had great appeal.\n\nIt started when Tom began concocting far-fetched introductions to the songs they were performing, and his brother would accuse him, rightfully, of making it all up.\n\nSoon the arguments became longer and more ornate, and the music, though high in quality, took something of a back seat. In fact, not ever finishing the song they had ostensibly set out to perform would become a Smothers Brothers trademark.\n\nTheir first big success came with their first appearance billed as “The Smothers Brothers” in February 1959 at a beatnik hangout in the North Beach area of San Francisco that had also launched the careers of The Kingston Trio and comedian Phyllis Diller. The Purple Onion had opened in 1952, and became a hip venue for stand-up comics such as Lenny Bruce, Bob Newhart, Woody Allen and, later, Richard Pryor.\n\nIn 1961, the Smothers Brothers recorded their first album there. “The Smothers Brothers Live at the Purple Onion” was released on May 1, 1961, and its success launched their careers. With its often humorless sincerity, folk music was a ripe target for satiric humor, and the Smothers Brothers were smart, agile performers who were primed to take on the genre.\n\nThe duo released several more popular albums during the early 1960s, touring the country and becoming regulars on television variety shows. On Sept. 26, 1964, they headlined a concert at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nTheir growing popularity brought Hollywood to their door, and the brothers signed up for their first television series. “The Smothers Brothers Show,” with Tom playing a guardian angel to his bachelor brother Dick, featured little of the music-influenced act that had brought the brothers their popularity. It lasted only one season, 32 episodes, on CBS.\n\nThe brothers’ lack of creative control over the show made them determined to have more power over how they were presented in their next television outing.\n\n“The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour” started out as a slightly offbeat but fairly traditional comedy-variety show when it debuted on CBS in the winter of 1967.\n\nThe brothers recruited an amazing collection of talented writers, with Steve Martin, Don “Father Guido Sarducci” Novello, Bob Einstein and his brother Albert, who went by the name of Albert Brooks, and Rob Reiner among them. Pat Paulsen also was in the writer’s room, before becoming famous for his tongue-in-cheek 1968 run for president.\n\nThe show’s attention to controversial topics growing out of the late 1960s youth/hippie culture began to get the show in trouble with the CBS censors, who were not enamored with the show’s drug and sex references, and were especially sensitive to the growing use of political satire and anti-Vietnam War sentiments expressed on the show.\n\nTom had already established relationships with rock musicians of the era. In June 1967, the summer before the “Comedy Hour” debuted, he famously introduced Moby Grape, Otis Redding, and Big Brother and the Holding Co. (with Janis Joplin) on the stage of the landmark Monterey Pop Festival.\n\nHe was able to use his knowledge of the rock music scene to bring popular performers to the “Comedy Hour” show. George Harrison, The Doors, Buffalo Springfield, Donovan, Jefferson Airplane, Steppenwolf, and controversial folk singer Pete Seeger were just a few who made appearances. Seeger’s performance of “Waist Deep in the Big Muddy,” with its pointed references to Vietnam, was cut from a broadcast in a dispute with censors, though he was allowed to perform it on a later episode.\n\nBritish rock titans The Who also made a most memorable appearance on the show. In their live U.S. national television debut, they performed “My Generation,” the number that usually came at the climax of their act where guitarist Pete Townshend smashed his guitar. On this occasion, the band also planned to have wildman drummer Keith Moon’s kit explode, but didn’t know that Moon had added extra firepower for the stunt:\n\nThe run-ins with censors continued. On March 9, 1969, the network aired a re-run, pre-empting the regularly scheduled episode in a dispute over its content. The show was picked for renewal a few days later on March 14, but CBS head William S. Paley abruptly canceled it on April 4.\n\nAfter 4 years of litigation, the Smothers Brothers won a breach of contract lawsuit against CBS over the cancellation and their firing. The entire saga is cataloged in the 2002 documentary, “Smothered: The Censorship Struggles of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.”\n\nThe brothers tried several revivals of their television formula during the 1970s and 1980s, but none of the shows lasted, as traditional variety shows began to fade from TV screens.\n\nDuring this time, Tom also was involved in a notable physical altercation with comedian Bill Cosby in October 1976 that’s recounted here.\n\nTheir performing schedule eased a bit as the brothers pursued other interests. They established the Remick Ridge Vineyards winemaking operation in Sonoma County. Tom raised his family while running the operation there. Dick began to spend more time indulging in one of his lifelong passions, auto racing.\n\nIn 1978, they appeared together in a stage production of the musical comedy, “I Love My Wife,” which rekindled their interest in performing together.\n\nThey began touring again, playing Las Vegas and other venues across the country, including a 1995 concert homecoming at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center.\n\nDick also returned to the South Bay in 2005, for the 100th anniversary celebration of the founding of Redondo Union High School.\n\nThe duo announced their retirement from active performing at a show at the Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on May 16, 2010, the same year they were inducted in to the Television Academy Hall of Fame. (They had already received their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Nov. 3, 1989.)\n\nTom, 79, currently lives in Sonoma County, and Dick, now 77, in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nSources:\n\nDaily Breeze files.\n\nSmothers Brothers home page, http://www.smothersbrothers.com/.\n\n“Tommy Smothers interview,” The Comedy Couch website, July 22, 2006.\n\nWikipedia.\n\nFurther reading:\n\n“Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of ‘The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'”, by David Bianculli, Touchstone Books, 2009.\n\nFurther viewing:\n\n“Smothered: The Censorship Struggles of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,” Time-Life, 2008.\n\nVideo: The Smothers Brothers go electric:\n\nLocal history isn’t always old and musty. Some recent landmarks have vanished from the view so quickly and completely, it’s as if they were never there.\n\nTake record stores. Chains and independents once dotted the South Bay landscape, but the rise of download services, streaming and other innovations in the early 2000s have killed off most of the bricks-and-mortar stores.\n\nBut, not so long ago, Torrance could boast of having two major chain record stores right across the street from each other.\n\nThe Wherehouse, whose parent company was headquartered at first in Gardena and later in Harbor Gateway, established its large store at 3832 Sepulveda Boulevard in the shopping center on the southwest corner of Hawthorne and Sepulveda boulevards as its flagship store.\n\nThe chain opened its first six stores, including the Sepulveda store in Torrance, in 1970. The Torrance store would expand to 12,200 square feet in 1985. It stocked a large selection of new vinyl and CDs, as well as videos in its later years, and, near the end of its run, used music and video titles.\n\nIt didn’t take long for another competitor to move into the shopping center.\n\nLicorice Pizza took its name from an old Bud & Travis folk album. James Greenwood liked the phrase and named his record store after it, opening the first Licorice Pizza in Long Beach in 1969.\n\nThe chain was a major player in record retailing during the 1970s, opening dozens of stores, including a large location on Sunset and La Cienega boulevards, kitty-corner from the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, not far from Tower Records’ Sunset Strip megastore.\n\nIts Torrance location did business from the early 1970s until 1986.\n\nLicorice Pizza was sold in 1986 to the company that owned Record Bar, another retail record store chain with a location in the Carson Mall (now South Bay Pavilion). Its Torrance location near the Wherehouse flagship later became a Music Plus.\n\nRuss Solomon founded Tower Records in 1960, opening his first store in Sacramento and rapidly expanding during the 1970s.\n\nTower moved into Torrance in September 1986, opening its 10,000-square-foot full-service store – they even had a Ticketmaster on site for concert ticket sales – on the northwest corner of Hawthorne and Sepulveda, at 22135 Hawthorne.\n\nFor the next several years, the two stores did battle across the street from each other, but competition from digital online sources eventually drove both out of business.\n\nTower closed its Torrance location in December 2006. It became an f.y.e. shortly thereafter, selling mostly used CDs and video. The f.y.e. store closed on Jan. 23, 2016.\n\nThe site now houses a jewelry store, Signet Jewelers.\n\nAs for The Wherehouse, its parent company, Wherehouse Entertainment, began having financial troubles in the mid-1990s, going so far as to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 1995.\n\nThe far-flung chain would declare bankruptcy again in January 2003, and begin closing its remaining stores. The main Torrance location closed a couple of years later.\n\nThe Wherehouse Music store near the South Bay Galleria at 17542 Hawthorne Boulevard was the last Torrance store in the chain to shut its doors, on April 25, 2014.\n\nIndie stores also proliferated during this era, including a whole raft of smaller ones in the beach cities: Scooter’s, Round Sounds, The Music Stop, and several others.\n\nRecycled Records in Hermosa Beach at 1200 Pacific Coast Highway, was one of the larger and longer-lived used record stores in the area, even though, for a time, it was located right next door to a Music Plus outlet.\n\nGo Boy Records, which specialized in surf music, punk and indie, was another South Bay indie record store institution. Its South Redondo location at 1310 S. Pacific Coast Highway gave it a strong beach vibe.\n\nGo Boy opened in the mid-1980s and was managed for many years by Alan Ostroff, who sold it in 2004 to Scott Dallavo. Dallavo was the victim of circumstances, coming in just as the bottom dropped out of the CD retail market. He was forced to close Go Boy on Dec. 26, 2006.\n\nRob Wilton began his South Bay record store career as the manager of the Torrance branch of the small Moby Disc chain, which he turned into an adventurous outlet for indie music in addition to mainstream sounds.\n\nIn January 1996, Wilton and partner Clark Benson opened their own store, Off/Beat Music, at 553 N. Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, and it quickly became one of the best indie stores in the South Bay. Wilton carried a broad selection of rock, from non-mainstream metal to punk-rock and ska revival bands, in addition to mainstream artists.\n\nWilton bought out Benson and became sole owner in 2001. Unfortunately, the downturn in bricks and mortar retail music sales claimed Off/Beat as a victim also, and Wilton had to close the store in December 2006.\n\nThree indie stores do remain in the South Bay. Erving Johnson’s P.M. Sounds at 1115 Sartori Avenue in Old Torrance has been specializing in jazz, r&b and rock vinyl records since 1997, and the resurgence of interest in vinyl has made his store a popular stop for collectors.\n\nThe vinyl revival also has been good to Record Recycler, owned by Roy Kaiser, at 17312 Crenshaw Boulevard in Torrance, which specializes in vintage vinyl.\n\nSoundsations at 8701 La Tijera Boulevard in Westchester is the largest of the three, and stocks new releases as well as used vinyl and CDs, Blu-Ray and DVDs.\n\nOther than those choices, bricks and mortar record store fans can seek out Fingerprints in Long Beach, and Amoeba in Hollywood. The Valley has more than its share of indie record stores, including CD Trader in Reseda, Freakbeat in Sherman Oaks, and Atomic Records in Burbank, and Silver Lake specializes in smaller curated used vinyl stores such as Vacation Vinyl, Mono and Origami, and has the larger collector-oriented Rockaway Records.\n\nAs for the South Bay, though, if you can’t find what you’re looking for at the few retailers that still carry music, such as Best Buy or Barnes & Noble or the few remaining indie stores, you’re either going to have to go online or take a road trip.\n\nSources:\n\nDaily Breeze files.\n\nLos Angeles Times files."
