They highlighted findings from recent Senate hearings and statements by NEDA which linked POGOs to negative “externalities,” citing the involvement of POGO personalities in human trafficking, kidnapping and money laundering.\n\n2022 data from the Philippine National Police showed that 55 percent of 31 cases of kidnapping were POGO-related. — TJ Burgonio\n\nMarcos explains failure to bring down rice prices, makes more promises\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. opened his third State of the Nation Address on Monday, July 22, with a reality check on the high price of rice.\n\n“The hard lesson of this last year has made it very clear that whatever current data proudly bannering our country as among the best performing in Asia means nothing to a Filipino, who is confronted by the price of rice at P45 to P65 per kilo,” he said.\n\nOn the presidential campaign trail, Marcos promised to lower the price of rice to P20 per kilo. After he assumed the presidency in June 2022, he took on the job of agriculture chief to address pressing issues in the sector.\n\nBut his first two years in office saw rice prices increase three-fold and local rice inflation surge the fastest in years. Marcos stepped down as agriculture chief in November last year amid skyrocketing rice prices.\n\nThe high retail price of rice comes amid record-high local palay production outputs, reaching 20 million metric tons in 2023, according to the Department of Agriculture.\n\nMarcos said local and international market forces dictate surging costs but continued to drill down on hoarders and smugglers for manipulating rice prices, which he said forced the government to impose a price ceiling in September.\n\n“Because of compelling emergency reasons such as illegal price manipulations by hoarders and smuggling, we were constrained to temporarily implement mandated price ceiling in rice,” he said.\n\nHe justified the country’s dependence on imports, saying palay outputs translate to only 13 metric tons of rice—insufficient to meet current demand of 16 million metric tons. He mentioned moves to extend tariff adjustments for imported rice.\n\nMarcos last month signed Executive Order 62 to lower tariff rates from 35 percent to 15 percent to “facilitate the importation of rice, corn and pork” until the end of the year.\n\n“Tinitiyak ko sa ating magsasaka at sa buong sektor ng agrikultura na ang mga ito ay pawang panggiitang solusyon lamang,” he said. (I am assuring our farmers and the whole agricultural sector that these are only stop-gap measures.)\n\nMarcos also highlighted efforts to address smuggled agri-fisheries products through modernized customs procedures and heightened enforcement efforts.\n\n“More than 2.7 billion worth of smuggled agri-fisheries products have been seized preventing them from entering the market and negatively influencing prices,” he said.\n\n“Bilang leksyon, ang mga nasabat na kargamento ng bigas ay agad nating pinamamahagi sa ating mahihirap na kababayan. Ganun din ang sasapitin ng lahat ng mga ipupuslit na bigas. Ang ibang produkto naman ay ating sisirain at susunugin bukod pa sa pagkakakulong sa mga mahuhuling mga salarin (As a lesson, counterfeit cargoes of rice will be distributed immediately to the poor. We will do the same for smuggled rice. For other products, we will destroy and burn them apart from putting culprits behind bars.)”\n\nMarcos also highlighted ongoing programs to distribute seedlings and fertilizers to farmers, and fingerlings and bancas to fisherfolk; renovate fish ports and establish cold storage facilities; and provide technical and financial support to farmers and fisherfolk. — Leilani Chavez\n\nMarcos wants it but is it time to review EPIRA?\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. asked Congress to review the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) to lower electricity costs in the country.\n\n“Binabalikan at binubusisi nating muli ang EPIRA upang malaman kung angkop pa ba ito sa ating kasalukuyang sitwasyon. O napapanahon na, na ito ay amyendahan,” he said during his third State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 22.\n\nRepublic Act No. 9136 was enacted in 2001 to resolve the power crisis of the 1990s. It restructured the electric power industry by privatizing the generation, transmission and distribution assets of the power sector.\n\nThese reforms were intended to promote free competition and provide a lower but efficient power generation system. But critics said the EPIRA law has been a “failure.”\n\nThe review of the EPIRA law is one of 28 priority measures identified by the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (Ledac) ahead of the midterm elections in May 2025.\n\nThe Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities (ICSC), however, said a new legislation may not be the swiftest way to address urgent challenges in the energy sector.\n\n“While we agree that a clean and affordable energy agenda is reason to further strengthen the EPIRA, we do not believe that amending the law is warranted at this time,” said ICSC Executive Director Angelo Kairos dela Cruz.\n\n“Instead, the most pressing energy issues faced by Filipinos can be more effectively and swiftly addressed by amending implementing rules and regulations and updating the circulars that implement EPIRA provisions.” he said.\n\nICSC also reiterated its call to abolish the automatic fuel cost pass-through provisions in power contracts. “It is this provision that has burdened consumers financially for years,” Cruz said. — Carmela Fonbuena\n\nMarcos stands his ground amid rising tension in West PH Sea\n\n“The Philippines cannot yield. The Philippines cannot waver,” President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Monday, vowing to assert the country’s “rights and sovereignty” in the West Philippine Sea amid growing tension with China over the grounded Philippine ship — the BRP Sierra Madre —on Ayungin Shoal.\n\n“Ang West Philippine Sea ay hindi kathang isip natin lamang. Ito ay atin,” Marcos said in his State of the Nation Address, receiving a standing ovation from senators and congressional representatives. “At ito ay mananatiling atin, hangga’t nag-aalab ang diwa ng ating minamahal na bansang Pilipinas.”\n\n“We continuously try to find ways to de-escalate tensions in the contested areas with our counterparts, without compromising our position and principles,” he said.\n\nOn June 17, a Philippine Navy personnel lost his thumb during a clash with Chinese Coast Guard men who boarded a Philippine Navy ship wielding knives, spears and an axe in a bid to foil a resupply mission in Ayungin Shoal.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) had announced that the Philippines and China have agreed on a “temporary arrangement” on the rotation and resupply missions to the Sierra Madre on Ayungin Shoal, where a handful of Philippine marines are stationed.\n\nMarcos said the country would continue to boost its defensive posture, both by developing self-reliance and strengthening its partnerships with other allied countries. —Kayla Claire Abawag\n\nMarcos silent again on press freedom, FOI\n\nPresident Ferdinand “Bongong” Marcos Jr. was again silent on press freedom and Freedom of Information (FOI) during his third State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 22.\n\nAhead of this SONA, media groups called on Marcos to push for measures that will protect the media from attacks and uphold transparency in government.\n\nConveners of the first Philippine Media Safety Summit urged Marcos to prioritize the decriminalization of libel, the passage of an FOI law, and the removal of a provision in the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2022 which states journalists are possible witnesses in drug-related cases.\n\nThese were not in the measures he asked Congress to pass during his SONA speech.\n\nThe Philippines is among the most dangerous countries for journalists. It ranked 134th out of 180 countries on the Reporters Without Borders’ (RSF) World Press Freedom Index.\n\nA total of 136 attacks against journalists were recorded during the first two years of the Marcos administration, according to data from the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP). — Nash Villena\n\nAs food prices hurt, Marcos renews call on LGUs to suspend ‘pass-thru fees’ to reduce business cost\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday renewed his call on local government units (LGUs) to stop collecting fees that make it more expensive to do business in the country.\n\n“To reduce unnecessary business costs, local government units no longer collect fees and charges from motorists transporting goods and merchandise while passing through national roads. On the same principle, LGUs have been strongly urged to refrain from collecting similar fees for the use of local roads,” he said in his State of the Nation Address on Monday, July 22.\n\nBut will the LGUs listen? Marcos’ call on the LGUs received applause from an audience composed mostly of lawmakers.\n\nMayors have asserted autonomy under the Local Government Code to “create their own sources of revenues and levy taxes, fees, and charges.”\n\nLogistics often account for the biggest production expense of manufacturing and agricultural producers. Logistics costs are often passed on to consumers, driving up costs of goods in the country.\n\nThese fees have been blamed for high food inflation, especially in urban centers such as Metro Manila whose food supply had to be transported from distant areas.\n\nFood inflation remained to be Marcos’ biggest challenge. Food inflation hit 6.5 percent in June 2024, a long way from this year’s goal of 2.0-4.0 percent under the Philippine Development Plan.\n\nMarcos issued Executive Order No. 41 in September last year to prohibit the collection of pass-through fees from vehicles transporting goods on national roads. The EO also urged the LGUs to suspend pass-through fees on local roads.\n\nThe EO “strongly urged” against the collection of sticker, discharging, delivery, market, toll, entry or mayor’s permit fees.\n\nThe Department of Interior and Local Government has also issued circulars against the collection of these fees. — Carmela Fonbuena\n\nMarcos’ SONA quiet on Maharlika funds\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. skipped the issue of the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) in his third State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 22, amid his administration’s aggressive infrastructure push.\n\nThe MIF legislation breezed through both chambers of Congress and was signed into law by the President on July 18, 2023, days ahead of his second SONA.\n\nMarcos envisioned the MIF as an intrument to mobilize “underutilized government funds” for “high impact and profitable investments,” such as the administration’s flagship infrastructure program, “Build Better More.”\n\n“The gains from the fund shall be reinvested into the country’s economic well-being,” he said then.\n\nThe country’s first sovereign wealth fund had initially come under criticism over a provision to fund it with investments from pension funds. After the firestorm, this was scrapped. Instead, its start-up capital would come from government financial institutions.\n\nMarcos clarified last year “funds for social security and health insurance” will remain intact and separate.”\n\nState-owned Maharlika Investment Corp. (MIC) has recently approved its investment and risk management framework, eyeing to raise $1 billion for investments in renewable energy, infrastructure, and agriculture.\n\nMIC has an authorized capital stock of P500 billion. Its initial capital of P125 billion came from contributions from the national government (P50 billion), the state-owned Land Bank of the Philippines (P50 billion) and Development Bank of the Philippines (P25 billion).\n\nWhile Marcos didn’t mention Maharlika, he highlighted the Public-Private Partnership Act or the PPP Code. Passed into law in December last year, it sought to tap foreign investments for state development projects.\n\n“PPP is seen to facilitate strategic investments and the timely development of projects under our Build Better More program, since around one fourth of our flagship projects have been envisioned to be funded through this modality,” he said on Monday.\n\nThe code covers official development assistance, joint ventures, toll operation facilities and agreements, lease agreements for government-owned land and facilities, and other contractual arrangements approved by the National Economic and Development Authority Board and heads of implementing agencies.\n\nMarcos’s “Build Better More” program includes some 198 infrastructure projects worth P8.8 trillion. More than 62 percent of the listed projects are new while 74 are carried over from the previous administration. — Leilani Chavez\n\nMarcos’ claim on bloodless anti-drug campaign ‘spurious and baseless’\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the government’s “bloodless war on dangerous drugs” would continue to abide by the “eight Es of an effective anti-illegal drugs strategy.”\n\n“Extermination was never one of them,’’ Marcos said in his State of the Nation Address on Monday, July 22, referring to his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal crackdown on drug suspects that left thousands dead.\n\nMarcos’ pronouncement drew a quick retort from Carlos Conde, senior researcher of the Human Rights Watch.\n\n“President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. not only failed to declare an end to the ‘war on drugs’ or outline a human-rights based approach to illegal drugs – he made the spurious and baseless claim that the continuing anti-drug campaign has been bloodless,’’ he said in a statement.\n\nCiting data from Dahas, a University of the Philippines Third World Studies Center program monitoring drug war killings, Conde said that more than 700 had been killed on Marcos’ watch, and that these “worsened in the past year compared to the year before.”\n\nFrom June 30, 2023 to July 1 this year, 360 deaths in anti-illegal drug operations were recorded. A third or 34.3 percent of these had been blamed on agents of the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), or Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).\n\nOf the 342 deaths recorded during Marcos’ first year in office, 160 were also committed by state agents, according to the Dahas report.\n\n“Even if we grant that it is bloodless – which it is definitely not – the measure of success should not only be the absence of violence but how many have been accountable,’’ Conde said.\n\nMarcos also declared that 71,000 anti-drug operations led to the seizure of some P44 billion worth of illegal drugs and the arrest of almost 100,000 drug personalities, including high-profile individuals and public officials.\n\n“The drug conviction rate is at a high of 79 percent. Together with this, we welcome the report that the number of drug-affected barangays in our country has been reduced by 32 percent,” Marcos added.\n\nFor Conde, this wasn’t reassuring. “We expect the ‘drug war’ violence to continue, probably even worsen,” he said.\n\nIn 2022, the PDEA claimed a 60-percent drug conviction rate. — Marilyn Cahatol\n\nWhat Marcos’ SONA said about the most urgent concerns of Filipinos\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s 2024 State of the Nation Address (SONA) detailed his administration’s performance on the most urgent concerns of Filipinos, based on the June 2024 Pulse Asia survey.\n\nThe table below summarizes what he said on issues considered urgent by at least 10% of Filipinos.\n\n— Research by Chris Josef De Jesus\n\nWill Marcos dance the Cha-cha? He was mum about it in SONA speech\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was mum about Charter change during his third State of Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 22.\n\nSenate President Francis Escudero on Sunday said he would allow the committee hearings on Charter change to continue in the chamber despite his opposition to the proposal to ease restrictions on foreign ownership of public utilities, educational institutions and advertising industry.\n\nThe House has passed the proposal on third and final reading. The counterpart bill in the Senate has yet to hurdle first reading at the committee level. — PCIJ.org\n\n‘Gov’t will honor commitments under the Bangsamoro peace process’\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the government would honor its remaining commitments under the Bangsamoro peace process as the five-year-old autonomous region prepares for its first regular elections in May 2025.\n\n“Government will honor and fully comply with its remaining deliverables and commitments,” Marcos said in his State of the Nation Address on Monday, July 22.\n\nMindanao’s dominant Muslim rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), agreed to end its struggle for independence in exchange for the political settlement that created the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). BARMM has more resources and wider powers than its predecessor, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).\n\n“In November last year, we signed proclamations granting amnesty to former rebels. A month later and then in June of this year, the House of Representatives and the Senate issued their respective resolutions concurring with these amnesty proclamations,” Marcos said.\n\nThe proclamation covers former rebels facing charges in court for alleged crimes committed during their armed struggle for independence. It’s an important step that will allow the combatants to transition to civilian life.\n\nMarcos also underscored government programs for the reintegration of former combatants in BARMM.\n\nThe normalization track of the peace process has yet to be completed less than 10 months before the elections on May 12, 2025 . So far 26,132 of the 40,000 MILF combatants have been decommissioned. This leaves 14,000 more combatants who have yet to transition to civilian life.\n\nMarcos’ statement was important amid concerns about the socio-economic packages that the combatants were promised.\n\nBut whether or not the normalization can be completed before the May 2025 elections is not clear.\n\nNevertheless, Marcos said in his SONA speech that BARMM appears “primed” and “ready“ for the elections next year.\n\nHe cited the enactment of the “essential laws of the region.” Five out of seven have already been enacted:\n\nAdministrative Code\n\nLocal Government Code\n\nElection Code\n\nEducation Code\n\nCivil Service Code\n\nThe parliament is still deliberating the proposed Indigenous People’s Rights Act and Revenue Code.\n\nMarcos also expressed optimism about the region. He celebrated how “investments in the region increased by 140 percent year-on-year” and how the “poverty index [in BARMM] has significantly decreased since 2018.”\n\nBut BARMM is still struggling economically. It’s among areas outside Metro Manila that have consistently suffered from high inflation rate. — Guinevere Latoza\n\nEnvironmental advocates to Marcos: Where are your climate justice policies?\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. asked Congress to pass a law conferring the legal personality of the Philippines as host of the board of the Loss and Damage Fund, a fund set up at COP28 UN climate change conference in December to help developing countries cope with the impact of climate change.\n\n“Precisely because of our inherent vulnerability, we are proactive advocates for heightened climate responsibility and justice on the global stage. To this end, we have secured a seat on the Board of the Loss and Damage Fund. And further, the Philippines has also been selected as (the) host country to that fund,” the President said in his State of the Naton Address on Monday, July 22.\n\n“This will require an enabling law from Congress to confer the legal personality and capacity to the Board,” he added.\n\nMarcos said the role gives the Philippines “a strong voice to access the needed financial assistance for climate-related initiatives and impacts.”\n\nMarcos also detailed the government’s disaster risk reduction efforts. As La Niña looms, he assured that flood prevention projects are underway. He also boasted of the newly inaugurated Disaster Response Command Center in Quezon City, a “central hub” for monitoring, reporting and coordination of disaster preparedness and response efforts.\n\nBut what about other environmental issues? Where were the administration’s climate change policies?\n\nHow about the mining projects and reclamation activities? And where does the administration stand on the rights violations against environmental defenders?\n\nThese are issues that environmental advocates found lacking in Marcos’ SONA.\n\n“Action on climate justice was conspicuously absent from President Marcos’ SONA,” Greenpeace’s Jefferson Chua said in a statement. “We know that climate impacts are already devastating agriculture, people’s livelihoods and jobs, education and health.”\n\nThe green coalition Kalikasan, however, was not convinced of the administration’s commitment to achieving genuine climate justice.\n\n“In the face of ongoing plunder from mining and environmentally destructive projects such as reclamation and mega-dams, the people are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with disasters,” the green coalition’s Jonila Castro countered.\n\nThe president was also mum on rights violations against environmental defenders.\n\n“Marcos Jr.’s total silence on these deadly attacks is a grave human rights violation in itself and an affront to ecological justice,” added Castro, one of two environmental activists who were reportedly abducted by the military and eventually freed in September last year.\n\nIn 2023, the Philippines was considered Asia’s deadliest country for land and environmental defenders. Almost 300 killings have been recorded over the past decade, a third of which were linked to the mining sector. — Guinevere Latoza\n\nMarcos promises lower electricity bills as he celebrates NGCP completion of key projects\n\nIt was only last year that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. reprimanded the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) over delayed projects in his State of the Nation Address (SONA). He demanded the completion of the Mindanao-Visayas and the Cebu-Negros-Panay interconnection grids.\n\nIn his SONA speech on Monday, July 22, Marcos was happy to report that the two projects were among a number of projects that have finally been completed. He said these infrastructure projects will ultimately help bring down the cost of electricity in the country.\n\n“Batid nating lahat na ang presyo ng kuryente dito sa ating bansa ay mataas. Kaya patuloy tayo sa pagdagdag ng mga imprastraktura ng kuryente na magpapababa ng presyo ng kalaunan,” Marcos said.\n\n(We are aware that the cost of electricity in the country is high. This is why we continue to build infrastructure that will eventually bring down power costs.)\n\nMarcos also asked Congress to review the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) law to determine if there’s a need to amend it.\n\nUnified Philippine Grid\n\nThe completion of the Cebu-Negros-Panay backbone project will “stabilize the power situation in Western and Central Visayas, and avert recurrences of power outages experienced in the past,” Marcos said, referring to the recent power crisis in Panay Island.\n\nHe celebrated the energization of the Mindanao-Visayas Interconnection, which finally linked the power grids of the country’s three major island groups.\n\nThe “unified Philippine Grid” is a fulfillment of the dream, whose seeds were planted in the ’80s, through a vision bolstered by R&D, which we accomplished by applying typical Filipino persistence and dedication,” he said.\n\nNGCP, which was not mentioned in Monday’s SONA, thanked Marcos in a statement. His SONA speech “is a clear sign that our hard work is recognized as having made a positive impact and is fully aligned with his vision for a strong economy,” it said.\n\nThe Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities (ICSC) welcomed the infrastructure projects, including improvements in transmission lines.\n\n“The next step is to further modernize the grid, making it more flexible and distributed by integrating indigenous and renewable energy sources, ensuring that the country’s power system fits the energy needs of Filipinos,” Executive Director Angelo Kairos dela Cruz said.\n\nThe projects were completed after the government ordered the NGCP to explain the delays, sought review of its rates by the Energy Regulatory Commission, and called on Congress to review its franchise.\n\nAfter repeated delays, the ERC said it is targeting to complete the rate reset by the end of the month.\n\n‘Band-aid’ solutions to rising electricity bills\n\nMarcos boasted of other government measures to address the rising cost of electricity. “Tinitiyak din nating makatarungan ang paniningil sa mga konsyumer,” he said.\n\nThe Lifeline Rate program which provides subsidies to the poor, particularly 4Ps beneficiaries\n\nTemporary suspension of FIT-All Tariff in electric bills. It has a pass-on charge to consumers to support the development of renewable energy sources\n\nAnti-Bill Shock lending program that assists electric cooperatives and other power distribution utilities to cushion the impact of high electricity bills, especially during hot months\n\nThe suspension of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) operations during the recent red alerts in Luzon and the Visayas to control power rates\n\nRefund and removal of excess charges on electricity bills, including franchise taxes\n\nICSC, however, said these are “temporary, band-aid solutions.”\n\n“What we ultimately need is to source power from indigenous and readily available sources, and to immediately move away from a baseload-centric, fossil fuel-centered power system,” Cruz said.\n\nRenewable Energy\n\nIn a departure from the Duterte administration’s lukewarm stance on renewable power, Marcos spoke of investments in renewable energy (RE), particularly solar energy, in his address.\n\nRenewable energy advocates have blamed delays in the completion of transmission projects on the country’s slow shift from dirty fossil fuels to renewable energy.\n\nThe Philippine Energy Plan (PEP) outlines the government’s ambitious goal to increase the share of RE in the country’s power generation mix to more than 40 percent by 2030 and nearly 57 percent by 2040.\n\nCruz said it “looks promising” but “the continued prevalence of fossil fuel operations can still drive up the cost of electricity and set back true progress.”\n\n350 Pilipinas, a network of climate advocates, said the PEP’s implementation needs to be scrutinized to ensure that fossil fuels are phased out and the grid develops into a “more adaptive and decentralized network.”\n\n“Confronting the nation’s deep-seated coal dependency and the administration’s flirtations with fossil gas and nuclear power is essential for true progress. This requires not just eliminating coal subsidies but reimagining the energy landscape to address market inequities and harnessing the nation’s potential in renewable sources of energy,” the network said in a statement.\n\nFor communities that still lack electricity, Marcos said the government would resort to micro-grid and off-grid systems to power them. — Carmela Fonbuena\n\nMarcos mum about divorce and SOGIESC bills\n\nThe House of Representatives approved on third and final reading House Bill No. 9349 or the Absolute Divorce Bill in May. Whether or not it becomes a law is now up to the Senate, which has yet to approve its version, SB No. 2443, in plenary.\n\nWhen the third regular session of the 19th Congress opened on Monday, July 22, Senate President Francis Escudero said that the bill was not among the chamber’s priority legislation. The senators are divided on the matter.\n\nNeither the divorce bill nor the Gender Identity, Gender Expression, or Sex Characteristics (SOGIESC) Equality Bill was mentioned in President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s State of the Nation Address on Monday.\n\nA Senate committee approved Senate Bill No. 1600 or the SOGIESC Equality bill in 2023. It has yet to be deliberated for second reading approval, the most difficult stage of the legislative process, where lawmakers debate the measure in plenary. Escudero said the bill faces rough sailing in the Senate unless it is amended.\n\nThe counterpart measure in the House of Representatives reached plenary discussions in May.\n\nClaire Padilla, executive director of EnGendeRights, Inc., said it was unfortunate that these important issues were not tackled in his SONA.\n\n“While President Marcos Jr. mentioned ways to address poverty, education and health and various gains, the long-standing issues such as lack of access to reproductive information and services, gender-based violence, divorce and LGBTIQ rights were absent in his SONA,” said Padilla.\n\nThe Philippines is overwhelmingly Catholic. Only the Philippines and Vatican City do not allow divorce.\n\nPadilla said the SOGIESC Equality Bill is also urgent. “LGBTIQ people suffer discrimination in the streets, workplaces, online, and other public spaces and in access to services and legal protection afforded to heterosexual Filipinos,” she said.\n\nPadilla also questioned the president’s silence on the issues of reproductive rights, gender-related violence, and abortion.\n\n“Addressing all these issues is important, certifying the bills on divorce, anti-teenage pregnancy, SOGIE Anti-Discrimination, Comprehensive Anti-Discrimination as priority is urgent, and supporting the passage of laws decriminalizing abortion, legal gender recognition and marriage equality are urgent to address equality and non-discrimination,” Padilla said. — Marilyn Cahatol\n\nMarcos lists priority bills in remaining months of 19th Congress\n\nPresident Marcos asked Congress to pass the following bills:\n\nEnabling law for Loss and Damage Fund, an endowment initiated by the a United Nations Climate Conference to assist developing countries affected by climate change\n\nAmendments to the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) Act to enhance the country’s tax incentives\n\nThe 19th Congress has 70 sessions before the midterm elections in May 2025. — Aaron John Baluis"
