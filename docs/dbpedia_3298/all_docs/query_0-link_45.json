        "text": "City in Maryland, United States\n\nSalisbury ( SAWLZ-bə-ree) is a city in and the county seat of Wicomico County, Maryland, United States.[5] Salisbury is the largest city in the state's Eastern Shore region, with a population of 33,050 at the 2020 census. Salisbury is the principal city of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is a commercial hub of the Delmarva Peninsula.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSalisbury's location at the head of Wicomico River was a major factor in growth. At first, it was a small colonial outpost set up by Lord Baltimore. Salisbury was established in 1732.[6][7]\n\nSalisbury's location at the head of the Wicomico River was seen to be a convenient location for trading purposes.[6] Due to the similar physical attributes as well as the nationality of Salisbury's founders, many historians believe that the name was inspired by the city of Salisbury, England, an ancient cathedral city.[6]\n\nSalisbury was officially incorporated as a city in 1854.[8]\n\nSalisbury also had a role in the American Civil War, as it served as a location where Union forces encamped in order to search for sympathizers from the South. These Union forces also worked to inhibit the movement of contraband to Confederate forces in the South.[citation needed]\n\nFires struck Salisbury in both 1860 and 1886, burning through two-thirds of the Town.[8] Despite the fires, Salisbury and the country that surrounded it continued to grow, and Salisbury was considered to be the major town of the county. In 1909, the Humphrey's Dam burst, flooding portions of Salisbury.[8][9]\n\nIn 1867, when Wicomico County was formed out of parts of both Somerset and Worcester Counties, Salisbury became the government seat.[7]\n\nIn 1898 and 1931, three Black men were lynched in Salisbury. Town leaders, including the fire chief and police chief, were allegedly complicit in the lynchings.[10]\n\nIn 1968, protests occurred in Salisbury after a police officer fatally shot a deaf and mute African-American man.[11] The protests prompted Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew to declare Martial Law and send the Maryland National Guard to Salisbury.[12]\n\nToday, Salisbury attracts a wide variety of different businesses in addition to the county, state, and federal government offices.[13]\n\nAdding to the diversity of Salisbury, the City is host to a wide variety of events celebrating local culture and the arts. These events include 3rd Friday, an event held in downtown Salisbury on the third Friday of each month, celebrating local music, artists, and nonprofit organizations.\n\nSalisbury is also home to a historical City Park,[14] the Salisbury Zoo, The Centre at Salisbury shopping mall, and the Wicomico Youth & Civic Center.\n\nThe Gillis-Grier House, Honeysuckle Lodge, Sen. William P. Jackson House, Pemberton Hall, Perry-Cooper House, Poplar Hill Mansion, Union Station, and F. Leonard Wailes Law Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[15]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 13.87 square miles (35.92 km2), of which 13.40 square miles (34.71 km2) is land and 0.47 square miles (1.22 km2) is water.[16] The city is situated 17 to 45 feet (5.2 to 13.7 m) above sea level.\n\nThe nearest major cities are Baltimore, 106 miles (171 km) away, Washington, D.C., 119 miles (192 km) away, and Philadelphia, 128 miles (206 km) away.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nSalisbury's location on the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland gives it a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa),[17] with hot, humid summers and, on average, cool to mild winters. The monthly daily average temperature at nearby Wicomico Regional Airport ranges from 36.8 °F (2.7 °C) in January to 77.9 °F (25.5 °C) in July;[18] on average, there are 30 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs annually and 7 days where the high fails to rise above freezing.[18] On average, Salisbury annually receives around 47.49 in (1,210 mm) of precipitation,[18] with 8.0 in (20.3 cm) of snowfall per year.[18] Record temperatures range from −10 °F (−23 °C) on January 11, 1942, up to 106 °F (41 °C) on July 21, 1930 and August 7, 1918.[18] However, temperatures reaching 0 °F (−18 °C) and lower, or 100 °F (37.8 °C) and higher, are rare, having last occurred January 9, 2017 and July 27, 2012, respectively.[18]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1850947—18702,064—18802,58125.0%18902,90512.6%19004,27747.2%19106,69056.4%19207,55312.9%193010,99745.6%194013,31321.1%195015,14113.7%196016,3027.7%197015,252−6.4%198016,4297.7%199020,59225.3%200023,74315.3%201030,34327.8%202033,0508.9%2022 (est.)33,209[21]0.5%\n\nSalisbury is the principal city of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Somerset, Wicomico, and Worcester counties in Maryland and Sussex County in Delaware.[22]\n\n2000 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the census[23] of 2000, there were 23,743 people, 9,061 households, and 4,802 families residing in the city.

(DJ) Elliot, at his office on Lake Street. The authorities found D.J. Elliot dead at his desk, his son, James Elliot present, and Matthew Williams incapacitated by several gunshot wounds. After being taken to Peninsula General Hospital, a 300-man white mob threw Williams from a second-floor window to the crowd below, where he was stabbed, tied to a truck and dragged three blocks to the county court house. There they hanged him from a tree, before he had any chance of a trial. The mob paraded Williams' body through the black part of Salisbury for intimidation, and mutilated and burned him. It was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882.[29] No one was prosecuted for Williams' killing, as was typical in lynchings.[29] As of 2007, there was no commemoration of the extrajudicial killing.[30][31]\n\nA 2017 memorial for Matthew Williams reignited the call for commemoration of the lynchings, with the known location of Matthew Williams' lynching (Wicomico County Circuit Courthouse lawn) emerging as the focal point. On this site, however, stood a sign some saw as antithetical to the sacred nature of the site as the location of one of the last lynchings in Maryland: a marker commemorating Confederate General John H. Winder. A 2018 documentary film (The Sign)[32] was produced, documenting and unraveling the complexities of this conflict, \"exposing deep wounds from the complicated history of the Eastern Shore.\"\n\nIn January 2020, Mayor Jake Day announced the formation of a Lynching Memorial Task Force[33] which was tasked with \"coordinating with the Equal Justice Initiative's Community Remembrance Project to facilitate the creation of a permanent monument in honor and solemn remembrance of the three American citizens who lost their lives at the hands of lynch mobs in Wicomico County.\"[34]\n\nOn July 5, 2023, a mass shooting occurred during a block party just outside of the city limits, leading to the death of a 14-year-old child and seven other injuries.[35] Following an investigation involving the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office and the Salisbury Police Department, the suspected shooter was arrested on September 11.[36]\n\nStatistics\n\n[edit]\n\nCrime statistics Year Part One\n\nCrimes %\n\nChange 2007[37] 2,862 2008[37] 2,655 -7.23 2009[37] 3,147 18.53 2010[37] 2,688 -14.59 2011[37] 2,169 -19.31 2012[37] 2,199 1.38 2013[37] 2,089 -5.00 2014[37] 2,110 1.01 2015[37] 2,091 -0.90 2016[38] 1,979 -5.36 2017[39] 2,089 5.56 2018[39] 1,821 -12.83 2019[40] 1,695 -6.92 2020[41] 1,319 -22.18\n\nCrime in 2019 was the lowest in the city's history, with the five safest years on record being 1986, 1996, 2016, 2018, and 2019.[39] Part One crimes, which are included in the table to the right, consist of the more serious crimes, including shoplifting, burglary, assault, theft, and rape.\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nSalisbury is a municipality within Wicomico County. The form of government is strong-mayor, as defined by the City Charter. In this form, executive functions are vested in a popularly elected mayor who serves a four-year term; currently John 'Jack' R. Heath.[42] The Mayor is the chief executive officer and the head of the administrative branch of the city government. In that role, he is responsible for overseeing the various departments in the city, ensuring that the ordinances of the city are executed, providing an annual report on the financial condition and accomplishments of the city, appointing the heads of all departments and members of committees and commissions, prepare an annual budget, and supervise the City Administrator who manages day-to-day functions.[43] The City Administrator is the supervisor of all department heads, except the City Clerk and City Attorney.[44] The City Administrator may also perform all other tasks delegated by the Mayor. Legislative and oversight functions are the purview of the elected council.[45] The five council members are elected to four-year terms from the city's five districts. City elections are non-partisan. The council meets in regular session the second and fourth Monday of each month in Council Chambers. Council work sessions are held the first and third Monday of each month. The council also holds the ability to fill vacancies in the council or appoint an acting mayor when a vacancy occurs.[46]\n\nMayors of Salisbury\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2023, there have been 29 mayors of Salisbury, listed to the right.[47]\n\nMayors of Salisbury Name From To A.
