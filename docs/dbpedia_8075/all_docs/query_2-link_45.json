        "text": "HERE is what August Strindberg had to say about the bourgeois theater of his time (he was born in 1849 and died in 1912): ''Theater has long seemed to me, like art in general, a kind of bible with pictures for those who can't read or write; the playwright is their lay preacher who explains the current middle-class thinking in ways that won't strain their brain capacity.''\n\nOr try this: ''Everyone is calling for the Joy of Life; theater managers demand we write farces, as if the Joy of Life resided in being ridiculous; we must paint human beings as if they are all suffering from St. Vitus' dance or idiocy.''\n\nStrindberg never tries to ingratiate himself. So perhaps it is not surprising that a pervasive, if mild, distaste for his work exists among audiences and theater folk alike. Of the 1888 ''Miss Julie'' he wrote, ''If my tragedy depresses many people, it is their own fault.'' Nor was he concerned if audiences had to struggle to negotiate abrupt shifts in tone and style, from laughter to horror to tears.\n\nIn my view, the major difficulty we have today with Strindberg is his difficulty. But if it is not simply a matter of coincidence, why is he popping up so often these days? In the last two years there have been Robert Wilson's production of ''The Dream Play'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music; Mike Figgis's movie of ''Miss Julie''; Ingmar Bergman's production of ''The Ghost Sonata,'' also at the Brooklyn Academy; a new adaptation of ''Dance of Death'' by the excellent American playwright Richard Greenberg, which opens on Thursday at the Broadhurst Theater, starring Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren; and a major show of Strindberg's paintings and photographs originating at the National Museum in Stockholm. Yale University Press has now published the first book to bring Strindberg's visionary paintings and photographs to an English-speaking audience; the paintings look as if they were completed this morning, and the degree to which many of them presage the work of Clifford Still, Richard Diebenkorn, Anselm Kiefer, Jackson Pollock and a host of others is but further evidence of Strindberg's courage and foresight. Another word for this is genius.\n\nIt is no secret that the greatest artists are often drawn toward the most difficult and new in both form and content; indeed, that's part of what makes them great. And no playwright since Shakespeare is as diverse on these two fronts as Strindberg. The truth is, no one even comes close. For sheer volume, he stands as a titan looking down on his contemporaries Ibsen and Chekhov. At his death, Strindberg left 55 volumes of stories, literary and scientific and religious essays, novels, poetry, autobiography, philosophy and plays, along with the visual works.\n\nWhen one then begins to look closely at the vast array of experiments he undertook -- from naturalism to Expressionism, verse dramas, tragicomedies, historical trilogies, religious drama, surreal dream plays, chamber plays and polemical plays; his revolutionary experiments in the theatrical use of music, dance, mime and improvisation; and his scenic innovations (in 1888 he suggested using projections) and in styles of performing -- one must stop to wonder whether this very heterogeneity may have also helped push him to the margins of our collective attention deficit disorder.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
