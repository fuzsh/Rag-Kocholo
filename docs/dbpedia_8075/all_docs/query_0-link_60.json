        "text": "1.\n\nI've got fear in my heart. I've got fear in my system. I've got fear in my heart. I've got fear in my system. What can tear us apart? There's a million nasty things going on in my head. Leave the angels for dead I've got fear in my heart. Rip the feathers off her wings. I've got fear in my heart. I've got fear in my system It's been there from the start. It's a tiny nasty place. It's a matter of fact. Thinking versus the act. What can tear us apart? There's a million nasty things going on in my head. Leave the angels for dead. I've got fear in my heart. Rip the feathers off her wings. I've got fear in my heart. I've got fear in my system. I've got fear in my system.\n\n2.\n\nInquisitor. 03:40\n\nLightning strikes through my fingertips. Static shocks from the telephone. Hair that stands on its very own. Snow that falls from her silver lips. If I can't be yours then you might as well rip my eyes out. Underneath the floors the guillotine slowly cries out for the coming of the ice queen. The cradle in her eyes. Remover of the fear when everybody dies. The holder of the crystal. The wisdom of the sage. Thе middle of the blizzard. The sеtters of the stage. Thistle blooms from your fingertips. Ginger snaps with a butcher knife. Lips so red, like the bloody drips from your teeth at the end of life. Chemicals coursing through my veins. Little words looping in our brains. Can't be sure, cos I can't be sure Can't be sure, cos my soul's not pure like the soul inside the ice queen. The cradle in her eyes. Remover of the fear when everybody dies. The holder of the crystal. The wisdom of the sage. The knowledge of the prophet. The setters of the stage. The letters on the page.\n\n3.\n\nGretle. 03:53\n\nI was leaping like the lizards in and out of asylum, so they took away my scissors. I'm hiding from the shivers. Reading Hesse I was diving in the rivers but I never was a leper. I was running when the shepard said to get to steppin I was wearing wolf's skin chewing on the mutton like it's lamb chop. Drop down, check yourself Some fool's deck is left on my shelf. So. I was checking through, it's twenty-two. Nevermind; it's fifty-six, in time for making parlor tricks and showing em to you as I'm speaking to the looking glass and everyone I'm looking past; babies in the witch's stew, I remember sitting in the blackest of the kettles in the hottest of the waters with the baddest of the girls, that's Gretle. So! So if your dinner date incinerates you toss em in the garbage bin with everything a sinner hates like little golden calves. You gots to rip em limb from limb! It gets real dim real quick when it's unexpected. You never stay protected You just elected a skeleton for all of us and I don't trust a single one of you and never have. So! My arms are open when the dead comes broken-hearted. My lips parted for the breadcrumbs, suckling the charred fingertips of sweet Gretle. -- It's whatever you say. You turn the other cheek. You look the other way It's whatever you say. You turn the other cheek. You look the other way It's whatever you say. You turn the other cheek I look the other way.\n\n4.\n\nCode inconnu. 01:00\n\n5.\n\nIndigo land. 03:30\n\nThis race is waiting to die out Just one last place that's making us cry out: Lumania That's what i'm naming ya Oh America, can i owe you one? This sage was waiting for a native son People asked him for a hand, so he gave them one And went into the mountains And decided to become a hermit Just to hear the cricket's language And attempt to learn it The water in the stream's more clear Than the ocean underneath the feet Of children on the piеr It's easy to hear The humming of thе ferryman: He's grounded all year A hole's at the bottom of his boat Such things make it difficult to float in the sea 'cause you can paddle all you want I guarantee it tips and loses balance From the back or the front Cumming in the oracle is like a miracle Plant seeds; she bleeds It's hysterical The way the wolves'll howl at the moon: Controller of the tides and manipulates the egg Which blooms There's a baby on the carpet in the middle room Cooing for a bottle or blanket We found him in the garden near An oak tree, so we thank it I reaped the nectar, then drank it -- This race is waiting to die out Just one last place making us cry out\n\n6.\n\nSailboat. 03:10\n\nI was in a loop-around Breathing in the steam I was in my lover's bed Waking from a dream I was in a mirror world Everything was green I decide to stay awake Living in a dream Everytime i look around Nothing's as it seems If i lay in bed Hiding from the fiends... Running from the branches (reaching from the willow trees) Tryna pull me underground (underneath its tangled roots) Running from a nightmare (i can see my lover's face) Tryna find a light (always puts me in my place.)\n\n7.\n\nUsurper. 02:41\n\nAnd if you think there's something wrong here It's probably 'cause i don't belong here There's a song here But i couldn't find it There was something i found but Honestly, i couldn't get behind it All the wallowing was tearing up my voicebox And i can make a choice like Paradox Seraphim I met a few who couldn't sing I met a couple, each was only born with one wing Meeting lots of these Pseudo-Mephistopheles Metamorphosizing metaphysical atrocities Planted in my hеad Buried underneath thе willow trees I planted them instead of asking for the woman's sympathies Happily on knees... There's big breasts to squeeze There's nipples to suckle And knock knock jokes of which to chuckle At. zippers to unzip Unbuckle that belt! But, not just to hit me; If mama sees welts then i'll say the dog bit me With... blunted teeth I wanted no grief But my ancestors sunk fangs in the beef I got a recipe for you to find relief And you can stroke it If you can find my neck, then baby you can choke it All night! It might hurt; But i know it's not meant to Please be kind to the literature i lent you And your mental... And please don't kick off dirt In the temple\n\n8.\n\nCrater in the moon. 03:40\n\nI was sick of every ritual and carrying the candlelight across the empty swimming pool. I was crooked, I was missing you and noticed my depression was habitual (and couldn't teach it a lesson without the indiscretion of a box-cutter), laying in-between the bread and butter in the cupboard. Graveyard workers work the same shift. When the poles shift, everyone's forgetting who they came with. -- The elephant will never forget: I swung upon his trunk until his body was wet in his own blood. (and I'll never forget.)\n\n9.\n\nLying with the snake. 01:02\n\nDon't wake: 'cause i'm better undercover I'm a liar and a snake And when i'm talking to your mother Then your father's Best not to go in there It's like the moonlight bothering the mourning air We don't care I'm talking to your daughter Drown me underwater Just to see me struggling And label me a martyr The white pill's what you oughta do Baby i'm a cross With a hammer just to martyr you The nail's for the palms or wrists And if you want it There's at least a couple arms to twist You can't resist I can't deny We can't manage Open up the wound to causе damage Open up the door But it's lockеd And the key is in the pit of my stomach I'm in the snake pit Deeper you can plummet But only if you want it\n\n10.\n\nThe queen rat. 04:38\n\nWe get up early to fight the world's traffic And fetch worms with the focus of a maverick You touch my body and the bed squirms slowly It's been a hundred years; i reckon you should know me It's been eternity And half a million names and surnames given To the daughter of the maiden and the flat that she was living in (it's not evident.) Beneath the ceiling all the parasites are settling You know it's not a virtue If it's meant to hurt you Tell it to a city that will swallow and desert you Tell it to the industry and smile with a curtsey And don't forget to tell it to the woman Who could wallow and desert me Firstly I been talking to a glass darkly I rip your panties just to blame it on the Marquis De Sade, i said it to the king and all the king's men Ever since Queen Rat's been teething I'm sorry that i'm always leaving\n\n11.\n\nDemian. 02:28\n\nI was awful handy with a handicap And took an easy beating like a skull snap Even if i'm bleeding In the corner of the kitchen Tapping on the shoulder Of the woman that's alone who Stood upon her own two Feet - I was feeding On her shoulder i was leaning I was grazing on her nipples In the ocean as it ripples I was gazing at her naval And begging her to scold me I don't give a fuck about what mother ever told me Mother was a mummy who would wrap me in her bandages She never calculated damages Mother couldn't manage his Oedipitiful suicidal tеndencies From beyond thе grave, so she let it be You telling me That you sleepwalk Even when you hear the voices from the corridor Begging you to lay down beside me, and Ride me Trade your pony for the glue Who would never come to question Anything And never knew I'm a little boy and my daddy knows As soon as he got to stepping i would lose control And i'm a little stillborn Mama said she would always loved me better if i came out dead Is that a fact? Something that should've taken back? Maybe i should take a crack At the old Freudian psychoanalysis And figure why my baby's in paralysis But only while she's sleeping... Listening to Demian creeping It presses on the ear Like a sack that's seeping into the drum From the middle of the skull And conjugate the rats like a fiddle that can blow And i'm a little boy And my daddy oughta know As soon as he got to stepping i was sure to lose control And i'm a little stillborn Mama always said That she would love me better if i came out... If i came out... Broke! He's broke all over, he's broken out of his shell! Broke! He's broke all over, he's broken out of his shell! Broke! He's broke all over he's broken out of his shell! Broken! Broken! Broke! (this really isn't me) Broke! (it was never meant to be) Broke! broke!

Genetic sort of frontal lobotomy So i'm back at the bottom I couldn't tell you if i got 'em But i wouldn't hesitate to show If the commission was sold; It's money that i won't owe\n\n13.\n\nHark The Harold angel sings out In the dark of night For me to stop choking the skylark Alright But if a dog's bite let's blood Well he can fetch a dead bird Like a spud in the mud I hit the rooftop With a thud When the angel's dropped me From the heavens onto Wuthering's height Which made each and every wrong right And with eyes white I wept black tears 'til it blurred my sight And kept back shears With pains, from neck veins To count dust by the speck And measure sand by grains Which doesn't keep away the migraines But at least it helps me sleep Long nights every day it rains Because the wailing of the trains past the moors Is like ghosts trailing their chains through locked doors Spectres who've been wrecked with locked jaws Under sheets, it rocks gauze In the streets it crawls on all fours Here's to rubbing the dirt in the bedsores And praying on broken knees To either virgins or whores Whichever you please, only to appease the man up- Stairs, if he cares, if he's holding your hand up... It might get chopped off Or lopped off Held lazily over the cliff and dropped off And a........................... .............. ....... ... ...

You used to have an awful lot to say Shouldn't you remember that i breathe through you? Kill my only child, then i grieve through you How is it to know you've been deceived? You used to have an awful lot to say...\n\n14.\n\nDeceiver. 02:52\n\nI was in a bind Hung erected from a cable Finding out she had his baby; Took my cup of coffee From her kitchen table Going out to burn the horses in the stable You said i wasn't able You said i wasn't able You said you were an enabler - You persecute us You persecute us\n\n15.\n\nIf it comes back To haunt you Take the pill Take the pill If it comes back To haunt you And it will And it will If it comes back To haunt you Keep still Keep still If it comes back To haunt you Take the pill Take the pill\n\n16.\n\nMolly blooms. 03:00\n\nMy soliloquy's a vaginal monologue Christian missionary, jews in the synagogue Hidden in the fog It’s fairly a monastery And the nun with the monocle... tends to scare me I was barley a pupil within the nunnery And blamed it on the thing that swung between my legs And under me I was hardly a hermaphrodite But i'd invite Anyone to enter As long as they made me laugh at night If only just to spite; Or see if spilt seed made an old god smite the instigator on sight We were meant to bleed upon impact Adam's calling up and asking for his sin back It’s sort of like the skeleton that's asking for his skin back And i would tell 'em paint the walls, but they've been black In fact Here's a needle from the haystack Just in case you need to make your way Back awwwwwwwwwwwwwwYES!!!!!!!! What it all comes down to When you're in your wedding dress With people all around you And the centre where i found you Never will it hold The ice age cometh It's cold! This world is a towel and we're soaking it Everyone’s a locked door begging you to open it Though i’m sort of like a locked chest Fetus in a coin locker at the bottom of the loch ness Darkness Cradling and pulling down the lark's nest Wingless Suckling its own dark breast But the thing is i broke away, and i confess The brother and the sister’s coming in like cest And any of whom i may offend, i just And i'm sure to take it all back when i rest And godforsake another significant other Underneath the stars And moonbeams And astral cars - This is the slave That laid the track That led to the house Was made by Jack This is the blood I cough and hack That drips through the pores And every crack This is the slave That laid the track That led to the house That was made by Jack This is the blood I cough and hack That drips through the pores And every crack When Molly blooms...\n\n17.\n\nId quixotic. 03:49\n\nTell me how am i supposed to know With my eyes sewn closed if my pants are down? And tell me what am i supposed to think When you come downstairs in your fancy gown I know that you really don't belong to me I know that you really don't belong to me I know that you really don't belong to me I know that you really don't belong to me And tell me how am i supposed to feel In my broken bones if i got no skin? And tell me how the hell i'm gonna deal In a mirror world if i lost my twin? Guess i'll meet the puller of my unseen strings Guess i'll meet the puller of my unseen strings Guess i'll meet thе puller of my unseen strings Guess i'll meet the pullеr of my unseen Strings (i guess i just don't know better) - God is at the centre of my soul But baby i don't know if that's enough to take control Now tell me what you won't do Tell me what you won't say Maybe we can find a way To turn and make it true one day Some say That the body is the mind when physical And the unseen strings drag behind, invisible To our eyes, though they're hanging from the skies And some would say i'm batshit crazy Telling lies to gullible little humans on the planet Who never knew any better In the summer, i'm sweating in the humid weather And try to keep it together But some things Will never stop the devil plucking feathers from wings of seraphim! I look into the mirror And i stop I swear it's him, and he's unbound Now i'm staring, dumbfounded Unfound children from the sea: I heard a couple drownded, it's where i wanna be I heard a couple drownded, it's where i wanna be I heard a couple drownded, it's where i wanna be\n\n18.\n\nAll too human. 01:01\n\n19.\n\nFalse brillante. 02:10\n\nWith god in his heaven And out my mind Everything certainly sure will be fine With no more distractions To waste my time Everything certainly sure will be fine But even the one with the greatest intentions Should maybe turn back and rethink his ambitions And watching you bleed as you're held in suspension Should at least insure you won't doubt my superstitions God's in his heaven And out my mind Everything certainly sure will be fine With no more distractions To waste my time Everything cеrtainly sure will be fine But еven a god or the lips of a mother Could die by the hand of whom once was your lover And old Don Quioxte or great Gilgamesh Would be hard-pressed to solve the secrets of our human flesh God's in his heaven And out my mind Everything certainly sure will be fine With no more distractions To waste my time Everything certainly sure will be fine\n\n20.\n\nBreaking the waveforms. 02:01\n\nThis is what you want this is what you get Know it's been a while, i'm ready to spit Make an Amadeus, i'm eating my shit Never should you mind, just taking the hit Usually it's true, but now it's legit Usually it's you, but now it's the vet I'm an animal, in this body i sit Gotta try and be a little proud of it Life's so hard Lets fuck and be silly You work so hard To grow and act smart You try too hard 'cause nobody listens We all got issues We all need jobs! Baby if you tell me where the level is... Maybe i can tell you where the devil is Once upon a time, they called me the wiz Takе it from a spoiled melancholiac Every othеr day i'm waiting to crack Gotta ride the wave that's taking me back Breaking all the waves is breaking my back Soon as i get money i'm buying a Mac Life's so hard Lets fuck and be silly You work so hard To grow and act smart You try too hard 'cause nobody listens We all got issues We all need jobs! Nobody can judge the right from the wrong Been around long; my evil is strong Really though, i'm better at writing a song I remember once, i was mugged in the street Luckily they were not carrying heat That'd be enough to put me in my seat Everybody wants to hop on the beat The only way to start is to hop on your feet!
