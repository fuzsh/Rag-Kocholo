        "meta_description": "August Strindberg (1849-1912) was a playwright, novelist, painter and photographer. Born in Stockholm to a father from an aristocratic family and a working-class mother who died when he was thirteen, he began studying at the University of Uppsala in 1867. He left shortly afterwards, however, to try his hand at various jobs, including acting. In 1870, his first plays were performed at the Royal Theatre. Strindberg’s intellectual and aesthetic universe was shaped by the writing and ideas of Kierkegaard, Rousseau, Shakespeare and Goethe, while he corresponded with Nietzsche about his own philosophical reflections. Ideologically, he espoused socialism as a goal to work towards, but his eventful and tumultuous personal life and his relationships with women led to accusations of misogyny. He wrote novels, short stories, essays, and more than seventy theatrical pieces, in which he experimented with naturalism and expressionism. An important stage in his career was the founding of the Intima Teatern in 1907 in Stockholm, with the actor and director August Falck. In this new theatre, in contrast to the spirit of the age, the whole was more important than any one part. Everyone and everything, including sets, costumes, lighting and music, served the author’s vision. Strindberg’s deeply subjective dramas reshaped European theatre in the twentieth century and influenced later writers such as Eugene O'Neill, Ionesco, Becket, Pinter and Tennessee Williams.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA short list of his plays:\r\nThe father [Fadren], Miss Julie [Fröken Julie], Creditors [Fordringsägare], The road to Damascus [Till Damaskus], A dream play [Ett drömspel], The ghost sonata [Spöksonaten],The pelican [Pelikanen].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nLove is to us a play, and we play at it when our work leaves us time to do so. But we have not the time to do so all day and all night, as you have. I believe you are sick—I am sure you are sick. (Miss Julie)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nBut perhaps you want even more—to have power over the child, but still have me to support you. What has this whole life and death struggle been for but power? (The Father)",

        "text": "Theatre unites people. It recognises no restrictions, and has no borders or geographical, political or economic limitations. It erases the distance of time and space – and even of language. A play is the fastest way of discovering new words eras, and cultures. Even when everything had to stop temporarily, art continued to take us on journeys and connect us with one another.\n\nTravel Through Theatre started as an exhibition at Athens International Airport “Eleftherios Venizelos” in September 2022 and is a journey about the dramatists who bring us together, from antiquity to the present day. It is a tour of the lives and works of writers whose endless flights of the imagination dissolve every frontier, because culture is not the preserve of a select few - it belongs to all of us. Art reminds us that we are all passengers on a single planet, “the great globe itself”, as Shakespeare callet it, on a journey that will continue as long as humankind exists.\n\nThe greatest writers have always raised fundamental questions about life. Regardless of where they were born and what language they wrote in, they speak to all of us. We present a theatre map (by no means exhaustive) of influential playwrights who constantly show us a world outside our window and encourage us to look beyond the narrow confines of the here and now.\n\nDr Irene Moundraki\n\nCurator – Head of Drama Department of the National Theatre of Greece\n\nTravel Through Theatre was an exhibition designed and held at Athens International Airport \"Eleftherios Venizelos\" as part of the wider cooperation between the National Theatre of Greece and the Airport.
