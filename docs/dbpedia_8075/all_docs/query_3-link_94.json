        "text": "The Show Must Go On. Due to the frank and salacious discussion of sex in Miss Julie, the play was initially forbidden from being performed several days before it was set to premier in Stockholm. Strindberg was able to get around censors, however, by premiering the play several days later at the Copenhagen University Student’s Union.\n\nAll In the Family. The title role of Miss Julie was originally performed by Strindberg’s then wife, Siri von Essen, who also served as the artistic director of their theater company.\n\nA Veritable Hit. Miss Julie is such a triumph of the Naturalist genre that it is one of the few plays ever written that boasts having had a production staged every year since its premiere in 1889."
