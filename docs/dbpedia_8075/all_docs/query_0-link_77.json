        "text": "Strindberg at the Opera\n\nRaymond Jarvi\n\nAugust Strindberg’s influence as a theorist and shaper of drama is ubiquitous; he can be considered the playwrights’ playwright of our century. His straining and breaking of the conventions of the late nineteenth-century stage has furnished impetus for virtually every aspect of the dramatic avant-garde during the last seven decades. Although his point of departure was the realistic theater of his time, he prepared the way for expressionistic drama; he contributed significantly to both the dream and the “supernaturalistic” play; he has also affected the development of modern symbolic, pageant, intimate, and historical drama. Has he had any impact at all on the operatic stage?\n\nAs far as the standard repertory goes, Strindbergian drama has not yet rendered an Aida, Bohème, or Carmen. In the case of Ture Rangström’s musical setting of Kronbruden (The Crown Bride) (1919), comparison can readily be made with the Maeterlinck-Debussy Pelleas et Melisande (1902) and the Wilde-Strauss Salomé (1905). Each composer has taken an already viable work for the stage and used its text as his libretto; each has produced a music-drama beyond the ken even of that crafty old wizard, Richard Wagner. The Rangström-Strindberg Kronbruden may well find a world audience among those who view Leos Janacek’s Jenufa (1904) as a twentieth-century masterpiece (and their numbers are increasing); in any case, the annals of the operatic stage do record numerous other attempts that have been made to adapt or transcribe Strindbergian drama to its own ambience. During the 1920s, the German composer Julius Weismann produced operatic versions of Svanevit (Swanwhite), Ett drömspel, (A Dream Play), and Spoksonaten (The Ghost Sonata); his Schwanenweiß (1923), in particular, did receive fairly extensive production on the German lyric stage in its day. The American composer Ned Rorem’s ill-fated version of Miss Julie (1965) might have fared better had its premiere at the New York City Opera not come in the aftermath of the company’s first mounting of Prokofiev’s Flaming Angel—nor just a few days before the famous metropolitan blackout that November. The Austrian-Yugoslavian composer Antonio Bibalo has, indeed, produced an intimate operatic version of Miss Julie (1975), which despite its obtrusive prologue—in which overdue attention is paid to the contrasting dreams of Julie and Jean—effectively adds a musical component to Strindberg’s “naturalistic tragedy.” Perhaps the most remarkable chamber opera based on a Strindberg text is the Australian composer Malcolm Williamson’s The Growing Castle, premiered in a castle in Wales in 1968, subsequently produced in Göteborg and in the Spanish courtyard of the Caramoor mansion in New York state (July 1970). Influenced by Gustav Holst’s Savitri (1916), Williamson has drastically reduced Strindberg’s Ett drömspel so that four singers can perform all of its twenty-eight roles, and the accompaniment (piano, harpsichord, bells, and percussion) can all be managed by one musician. Reviewing the Caramoor performances, John W. Freeman commented: “Symbolism is perilous in opera, and some of the lines and images could be construed as jejune in another context, but somehow when Strindberg does it one doesn’t laugh.”1 What might Strindberg have thought of such adaptations of his works? What was his relationship to, assessment of, and involvement with the lyric theater of his day?\n\nDuring his teens and twenties, Strindberg occasionally attended operatic performances at Stockholm’s Kungliga Teatern (The Royal Theater); in the 1870s, he enjoyed the friendship of such prominent members of the theater’s ensemble as Pelle Janzon and Carl Fredrik Lundqvist (“Lunkan”). The premiere of La belle Hélène (Beautiful Helen) on the national lyric stage in 1865, Offenbach’s official breakthrough in Sweden, made an indelible impression on an extremely serious sixteen-year-old Johan August, judging by the lengthy discussion of it that he included in the first volume of Tjänstekvinnans son (The Son of a Servant) (1886).2 He considered Offenbach a latter-day Aristophanes whose works denoted the end of an era in a common European development, namely, two thousand years of Greco-Christian cultural hegemony. What Strindberg saw in 1865 as a veiled smile, assumed at length dimensions of a demonic leer, as his diatribe against these matters in Öppna brev till Intima teatern (Open Letters to the Intimate Theater) (1908) indicates.3\n\nLess complex and more exclusively positive was the young Strindberg’s enthusiastic response to Verdi’s II Trovatore (The Troubadour), premiered in Stockholm on 31 May 1860, to Mozart’s Don Giovanni—that perennial enigma—and to what then was the rising star of Charles Gounod, whose Faust was a standard repertory piece at Kungliga Teatern from 1862 until the early 1950s and whose Roméo et Juliette was first performed in Stockholm on 11 June 1868, although it did not actually enter the repertory until the revival of 1884. Both of Gounod’s world-wide successes, above all, Roméo et Juliette, were to retain an evocation of the dream of youth in Strindberg’s memory and experience; well-worn piano reductions of both works are among the handful of operatic scores in the library that Strindberg collected after 1899, now in the archives of Nordiska Museet (The Nordic Museum).4 In the case of Faust, however, the dream tarnished somewhat not only as Strindberg gained an appreciation of Goethe and his more faithful operatic disciple, Arrigo Boito,5 but also when chance arranged things so that the Parisian premiere of Fadren (The Father) on 13 December 1894 necessarily had to compete for public attention with the gala 1,000th performance of Gounod’s deathless triumph of the Victorian sensibility on 14 December 1894 at the Palais Garnier.6\n\nThe lyric stage remained, however, relatively low at best in the young Strindberg’s scheme of priorities. Rousseauean idealist of a strongly Darwinian bent and son of a servant woman that he was, he found opera itself not only the epitome of the artificial but a bastion for the values and sensibilities of what he considered an oppressive and moribund elite, hence, an outmoded means of artistic expression doomed to extinction in the inevitable progress of natural selection. Remarks in a letter of 20 November 1885 to his brother Axel indicate Strindberg’s characteristic pre-Inferno assessment: “Men Wagnerismen är bara en enskild persons fundering som nu är på modet. Operan kan ej utvecklas; den är onatur alltigenom och kan bara dö. Upplöses i operetten och slutar som Variété-teatern.”7\n\nWhy then did Strindberg in the mid-1880s suggest that his Uppsala friend Eugène Fahlstedt adapt his short story “Odlad frukt” (“Cultivated Fruit”) in Svenska öden och äventyr (Swedish Destinies and Adventures) (1882) as a libretto for the then prominent Swedish composer Andreas Hallén; or in his letter of 4 June 1891 to Fredrik Vult von Steijern roughly outline plans for an original libretto to an opera seria in the old number style on the subject of David and Saul? Economic necessity probably accounts for the first matter; Strindberg’s almost lifelong, perilously uncertain financial base led him to plan infinitely more than even he—“Sveriges största eld” (“Sweden’s greatest fire”)—actually managed to produce. As far as the proposed opera seria goes, it would amount to repayment of a personal debt to Vult von Steijern, who from his position as editor-in-chief of Dagens Nyheter had gathered the economic means whereby Strindberg was able to fund his Swedish travels of 1890–1891. As one of Sweden’s leading Wagnerians at the time, Vult von Steijern was keenly interested in the synthesis of drama and music. Neither project got any further than the indicated stages; Strindberg’s commitment or motivation to pursue these matters evidently was not very strong.\n\nAn opera seria in the tradition of Handel and Mozart, entitled Saul og David, composed by the Danish symphonist Carl Nielsen between 1898 and 1901 and premiered at Copenhagen’s Kongelige Theater (Royal Theater) on 28 November 1902 has decently maintained itself in that theater’s repertory and traveled north to Göteborg (1928) and Stockholm (1931). The pre-Inferno Strindberg would probably have appreciated Nielsen’s and his librettist Einar Christiansen’s basic thesis: their treatment of Saul as a tragic hero, an intelligent and courageous individual who questions the accepted beliefs and superstitions of a primitive tribe, in conflict with the more conventional figure of David, who accepts the existing order, believes in it, and ultimately becomes the chosen king of Israel.\n\nA shift in Strindberg’s attitude toward the lyric stage can be detected in the early 1890s after his divorce from Siri von Essen and during his and his fellow expatriates’ search for a new artistic synthesis—whatever the consequences might be—in the willed madness, among other assumed poses, of the “Zum schwarzen Ferkel” (“The Black Piglet”) circle. He continued to dismiss Wagner and the Wagnerians as simply the cult of a given ego—of no real lasting significance. In the performances of Die Walküre (The Valkyrie) he attended in Berlin in 1893, he found neither music nor drama.8 A wholly admirable work—and one that did not pretend to be a “music drama”—he now found in Bizet’s Carmen (1875), which by the mid-1890s had firmly established itself in the European repertory, if it still was unsuitable for performance at L’Academie Nationale de Musique (The National Academy of Music). In Bizet, Strindberg obviously saw a fellow outsider—but one whose day had brilliantly arrived.9 Georg Brandes had seen to it, moreover, that Strindberg got a copy of Nietzsche’s Der Fall Wagner (The Case of Wagner) directly from the publisher in 1888.10\n\nThe work that now intrigued Strindberg, the theorist of the drama, was Pietro Mascagni’s Cavalleria Rusticana (Rustic Chivalry), which first sizzled on the Roman lyric stage in 1890—the Fröken Julie (Miss Julie) (1888), roughly speaking, of the Italian veristic movement. Consider, for example, Strindberg’s advice to the Finnish writer Adolf Paul, whose training had included music and who in 1894 wanted to make a libretto: “När Du nu gör operatext, har Du ej tänkt gå längre än Mascagni och Convaljen11 och ta moderna kurrar i snygga gångkläder, utan folkkostym. Han, Hon, Den i redingoter och bord och stol. Hvad säger Du om Das Band? (Tänk de tolf nämdemännen kör för bariton och basar!) Hvilka körer, ensembler och Solon med Leitmotiv! Slå Mascagnis verldsrekord!”12 Three people, two chairs, and a table: since the dissection of souls in Fordringsägare (Creditors) (1888) had been achieved with these extremely simple means, might they not also provide a new tack for the lyric stage—one that went further than Mascagni or Leoncavallo in confronting an audience with mirror images of the human condition? However far-fetched the idea might have seemed to Adolf Paul, a brace of twentieth-century composers from the Schoenberg of Erwartung (Anticipation) (1909; first performed 1924) to the Poulenc of La Voix humaine (The Human Voice) (1959) to the Hugo Weisgall of The Stronger (1952) have richly explored the possibilities of Strindberg’s intuitive suggestion. And one may conjure indeed with Bandet (The Bond) (1892). Think of the twelve jurymen resounding from the deepest reaches of the male voice! Think of the Verdi of the king’s closet scene in Don Carlos (1867), the Dies Irae movement of the Requiem (1874), or the revised council scene in Simon Boccanegra (1881) applying his heightened creative powers to these choruses, ensembles, and arias! Think of Strindberg’s having been able to offer this text directly to Leos Janacek …\n\nThe Strindberg of “Kammarspelen” (“the chamber plays”) (1907) devoted considerable thought to the shaping of “en kammaropera” (“a chamber opera”) as his letters to his good friend, the conductor and violinist Tor Aulin, indicate. At the playwright’s request, the latter had furnished the incidental music for the production of the verse Mäster Olof that inaugurated Dramaten’s new “Vita huset” (“White House”) on Nybroplan. The congenial results of that venture led Strindberg to write the following to Aulin on 20 January 1908:\n\nNär Du sist föreslog ett nytt samarbete … så frågar jag: Hvarför icke en opera? Men icke en svensk. Det blir antigen Den Bergtagna med C-dur och A-moll i oändlighet; och en visa är bara en liten detalj i operan. Eller Waldemarsskatten: en kombination af Skansen, Wagner och Waldteuffel.\n\nPå Ditt förslag föreslår jag: Drömspelet. Der har Du en text som pröfvat eldarne. Men den skall försäkras efter kompositörens behag; alla komiska moment utgå; personalen inskränkes, och orkestern indrages till Mozarts besättning (Din nuvarande). Och kort! Ett musikaliskt kammarspel, der all filosofencer utgå, och endast “scenerna” stå qvar. Alltså icke den sjungna romanen som i—Du minns den Franska på Svenska Teatern! Dramatisk—lyrisk musik men icke teatralisk—recitativ—resonerande.\n\nEnkel men icke för enkel. Glück gerna (Orfeus), men fodrad med Beethoven, dock icke Beethoven helt!13\n\nA Strindberg-Aulin opera was never written: The former repeatedly brought the matter up in his letters of 1908–09, but the latter could only eat humble pie, so to speak, on his end of their correspondence because of the kind things the master was saying to him. Malcolm Williamson, however, has reduced Ett drömspel—dramatically to be sure—along the lines that Strindberg suggested to Aulin and thus has provided a version of the work for the modern intimate lyric stage. Williamson’s music from the global village would probably elude the shade of Strindberg, were that happy ghost able to attend a current performance of The Growing Castle. The post-Inferno Strindberg’s insistence that melody alone is the common denominator of all musical experience, his pointing Aulin back to Glück and Beethoven for models—one hopes that in his heart of hearts, even Strindberg realized it might be drudgery were it actually this simple.\n\nA formidable Swedish composer did, however, appear at Strindberg’s threshold in the early summer of 1909, the young Ture Rangström. Tor Aulin had, in fact, served as the go-between in arranging their first meeting. Rangström’s calling card had been his recently published opus of romanser based on four poems from Ordalek och småkonst (Word Play and Minor Art) (1905),14 legitimate expressions of the lyrics themselves, from Strindberg’s point of view, but far too dependent as to their musicality on the Norwegian harmonies of Grieg, Sinding, and others of their school. Were Rangström to manifest the Swedish mode, said Strindberg, he was well advised to search for her secrets and nuances in his own musical folk drama Kronbruden (1901). The idea had already occurred to the young composer who replied to the playwright, all the same, that were he to pursue this Dalecarlian vein, the first four of Strindberg’s six tableaux would be sufficient for his libretto. In them, the eye and ear of the musician could readily perceive the movement from sin to punishment to redemption that constitutes the essence of the crown bride Kersti’s dream. “Ett ögonblicks tanke!” replied Strindberg. “Ni har rätt! Musiken har ibland en högre moral än dikten!”15 The rest is—and will be on-going—operatic history.\n\nNotes\n\n1. Opera News, 35, No. 1 (5 September 1970), p. 22. Four operatic versions of Strindberg’s Ett drömspel have thus far been produced. In addition to those by Weismann and Williamson, the Swiss composer Edward Staemfli made his debut on the lyric stage in 1943 with his setting of Ein Traumspiel. This text also furnished the libretto of the German composer Aribert Reimann’s first opera Traumspiel, premiered in Kiel on 20 June 1965, and couched in a lyrically expressionistic modern idiom that tends towards shifting tonal foci. The Swedish composer Ingvar Lidholm is presently writing an opera on this intrinsically musical text.\n\n2. August Strindberg, Samlade Skrifter, ed.
