        "text": "“Twitter, Facebook, Internet debates, you name it—he would’ve loved it. His own diary notes vacillate between highs and lows, just like people’s tweets today.” Hansson Wretman says there have been lots of reactions to Strindberg’s tweets, and many have added themselves as followers, and the followers are from all walks of life, from librarians to soccer fans. Expressen Kultur is behind another Strindberg Twitter account under the name “EnDjeflaMan” (A Hell of a Man), which mixes authentic Strindberg quotes with links to the newspaper’s articles regarding the centennial. There’s some friction between the different Strindbergs on Twitter, however. The unknown man or woman behind the account “_strindberg” lets his or her August speak out quite liberally, and this fictive Strindberg has shown anger over Liljevalch’s version. “He wrote something about being tired of us ‘stealing’ from ‘Ockulta dagboken’. But our own August didn’t respond to that. He never does,” Annika Hansson Wretman says and adds that she’s not too happy about people using the August Strindberg avatar without quoting the author correctly. “It’s a pity when people post quotes and you don’t know if Strindberg indeed said it or not.”\n\nDagens Nyheter did a brief Twitter-interview with “_strindberg”:\n\nDN: Why does August Strindberg twitter? Aren’t 140 characters a limitation for an artistic soul?\n\n“The limitation is a challenge. I adapt to the society that has such clear need of my fire.”\n\nDN: What do you think of others twittering under the name Strindberg?\n\n“Epigones! They take my old texts, re-publish them out of context and choose not to interact with people. To communicate is important!”"
