        "text": "Born in 1849 to a serving woman and a bankrupt\n\nex-gentleman, Swedish playwright August Strindberg knew poverty\n\nand misery from early childhood. This personal experience explains\n\nthe subject matter for many of his plays – the conflict between\n\nmen and women, and the antagonism between classes.\n\nStrindberg was an acute observer of environments, customs and\n\nmanners, and a master of the concrete, whether he was dealing\n\nwith city or provincial life, the upper or the lower classes,\n\nhistorical or contemporary situations. But Strindberg not only\n\ndeepened realistic drama in plays like \"Miss Julie,\"\n\nhe also transcended realism with pioneering experiments in non-realistic\n\nplays like \"The Ghost Sonata,\" which made him the first\n\nmodern master of both psychological realism and expressionism.\n\n[The Royal Dramatic Theatre of Sweden will stage \"Ghost\n\nSonata\" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Harvey Theater\n\nJune 20-24.]\n\nIn the 1890s, Strindberg became interested in the physical sciences,\n\nbut his experiments in chemistry soon transformed into alchemy,\n\noccultism and mysticism as he came under the influence of Maurice\n\nMaeterlinck, the Belgian poet, dramatist and essayist notable\n\nfor his mysticism and dreamy subject matter. Strindberg’s plays\n\nbecame more symbolic and less realistic.\n\nThen in 1896, Strindberg suffered a psychological crisis that\n\nbrought him to the edge of madness. His new plays began to give\n\nform to his vision of life, in which the inner world has as much,\n\nif not more claim to reality than external experience.\n\nWritten in 1907, \"The Ghost Sonata\" was first produced\n\nfor the Intimate Theater in Stockholm, which Strindberg had established\n\nthat year with August Falck.\n\n\"The Ghost Sonata\" is a chamber play in three scenes.\n\nIt opens on a square in front of an elegant home, where the Student\n\nconverses with the Milkmaid, who is visible only to him. Hummel,\n\nan elderly gentleman, encounters the Student and introduces himself.\n\n[In BAM’s production, Hummel is played by Jan Malmsjo.]\n\nDuring their conversation, he learns that the Student is a Sunday\n\nChild, which, according to Swedish folklore, means he has supernatural\n\npowers. Intrigued, Hummel invites the Student to dinner at the\n\nstylish house, where he meets its inhabitants – the colonel;\n\nhis wife, the Mummy; and their beautiful daughter, the Young\n\nLady – as well as various guests and servants.\n\nOver the course of the evening, the Student falls in love with\n\nthe Young Lady, and secrets are gradually unfolded that reveal\n\nthe entire cast – except the Student – as both physically and\n\nemotionally corrupt.\n\nIn \"The Ghost Sonata,\" Strindberg evokes the horrors\n\nof the subconscious world, a world populated by lost souls and\n\nsurreal characters. But in its own way, \"The Ghost Sonata,\"\n\nlike Strindberg’s realistic drama, reflects the artist’s will\n\nand ability to make the unknown and the hidden revealed and the\n\nsubconscious conscious.\n\n\"The Ghost Sonata\" will be\n\nperformed June 20-23 at 7:30 pm and June 24 at 3 pm at the BAM\n\nHarvey Theatre [651 Fulton St., (718) 636-4100]. Tickets are\n\n$20-$65. The play will be performed in Swedish with simultaneous\n\nEnglish translation."
