        "text": "Johan August Strindberg was a Swedish playwright and often referred to as the ‘Father of modern Swedish literature’. Though he is reputed for his plays outside Sweden, nationally he is equally recognised as a poet, painter, essayist and novelist. His contribution as a writer in a career span of around four decades include more than thirty works of friction, sixty plays, historical works, autobiographies, political writings and cultural analysis. He experimented and delved into vast spectrum of dramatic techniques including melodramatic, tragic, historical, surrealist and naturalistic styles. His real breakthrough in theatres came in 1881 with ‘Master Olof’, his first prominent play that was premiered at the ‘New Theatre’. A new composite form of Expressionist drama evolved in European field of drama with his experimental fusion of Naturalism with psychology. For some time in the 1890s he stayed abroad and got hooked with occult science. After suffering from bouts of psychotic attacks leading to hospitalisation, he came back to Sweden. Later upon his recovery he was fascinated by the views of Emanuel Swedenborg and made up his mind to become \"the Zola of the Occult\". He got back to playwriting in 1898. Some of his noted plays like ‘The Father’ (1887), ‘Miss Julie’ (1888), ‘A Dream Play’ (1902), and ‘The Ghost Sonata’ (1907) are performed till date."
