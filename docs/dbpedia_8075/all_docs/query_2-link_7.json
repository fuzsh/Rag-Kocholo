        "text": "This is purely speculative, based on what you have said and reviewing the plot summary in the Wikipedia article.\n\nYou point out that the names are not common in Sweden at that time, which points to an underlying reason for their choice.\n\nTaking this as a given and looking to the play itself, I see that it is set at Midsummer, the turning point of the year, and explores Darwinian themes of inheritance and fitness.\n\nI would speculate then that the names Jean and Julie reference the months of June and July (in Swedish Juni and Juli).\n\nThe play is set near the end of June as the year turns and gives way to July. It may be that the names are intended to gently reference an evolving human society by highlighting that she belongs to the future and he the past, or possibly that she represents a doomed evolutionary branch. I suspect one needs real familiarity with the play to theorise further.\n\nThe other aspect of the name Jean is a possible reference to St John the Baptist, on whose feast day the second part of the play is set. the Gospels portray John as the precursor or forerunner of Christ, which may again play to themes of succession in the play.\n\nEdit: It’s just struck me that someone called ‘August’ may well have enjoyed naming his characters for months of the year...\n\nAuthor Jan Myrdal, although mainly a political writer, was very interested in literary fiction and wrote several books and many articles about Strindberg. He referred to Strindberg’s own words (in a letter to Norwegian novelist Jonas Lie) that reading Nikolay Chernyshevsky’s novel What Is to Be Done? constituted a “turning point” in his life as a writer, and argued—for example in a collection of essays called Ord och avsikt (“Words and Intent”, 1986)—that a large part of Strindberg’s authorship was inspired by Chernyshevsky.\n\nMore recently, Mariusz Kalinowski, a translator of Strindberg into Polish, has claimed—in an article titled Indras Dotter – född ur en rysk dröm (“Indra’s daughter – born from a Russian dream”) and bearing the subheading Om Strindbergs skuld till Tjernysjevskij (“On Strindberg’s debt to Chernyshevsky”)—that Strindberg’s fascination with What Is to Be Done? led him to name Miss Julie and Jean after two of the main characters in the novel, namely Julie Letellier and Jean Solovtsov. Apparently, Russian scholar Dmitry Mikhailovich Sharypkin put forward similar arguments in his book Русская литература в скандинавских странах (“Russian literature in the Scandinavian countries”, 1975).\n\nAs it is commonly believed that Chernyshevsky’s Julie was modelled after the protagonist of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse, some people who buy into the above have fancied that Miss Julie and Jean should ultimately be said to owe their names to Rousseau’s Julie and to himself."
