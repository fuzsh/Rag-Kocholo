        "text": "This article is about the play. For the album by Tuxedomoon, see The Ghost Sonata (album). For the television episode, see The Ghost Sonata (Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists).\n\nThe Ghost Sonata (Swedish: Spöksonaten) is a play in three acts by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg. Written in 1907, it was first produced at Strindberg's Intimate Theatre in Stockholm on 21 January 1908. Since then, it has been staged by such notable directors as Max Reinhardt, Olof Molander, Roger Blin, and Ingmar Bergman. Bergman directed it four times: in 1941, 1954, 1973, and 2000. Strindberg took the title from Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 17 in D minor, which he called 'The Gespenster Sonata', and also Piano Trio No. 5 in D major, known as the 'Ghost Trio'.[1]\n\nThe Ghost Sonata is a key text in the development of modernist drama and a vivid example of a chamber play. In it, Strindberg creates a world in which ghosts walk in bright daylight, a beautiful woman is transformed into a mummy and lives in the closet, and the household cook sucks all the nourishment out of the food before she serves it to her masters.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ghost Sonata relates the adventures of a young student, who idealizes the lives of the inhabitants of a stylish apartment building in Stockholm. He makes the acquaintance of the mysterious Jacob Hummel, who helps him to find his way into the apartment, only to find that it is a nest of betrayal and sickness. The world, the student learns, is hell and human beings must suffer to achieve salvation. The play centers on a family of strangers who meet for the sake of meeting. They exchange no dialogue, nor gestures; they simply sit and bask in their own misfortune.\n\nCharacters\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Old Man, Jacob Hummel\n\nThe Student, Mr. Arkenholz\n\nThe Milkmaid, An apparition\n\nThe Superintendent's wife\n\nThe Superintendent\n\nThe Dead Man, a Consul\n\nThe Lady in Black, Daughter of the Dead Man and the Superintendent's wife\n\nThe Colonel\n\nThe Mummy, the Colonel's wife\n\nThe Young Lady, the Colonel's daughter, but actually the Old Man's daughter\n\nJohansson, Hummel's servant\n\nBengtsson, The Colonel's footman\n\nThe Fiancée, a white-haired woman, formerly engaged to Hummel\n\nThe Cook\n\nBeggars\n\nThe Nobleman, engaged to the Lady in Black\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nIsle of the Dead (Böcklin's painting)\n\nDie Gespenstersonate, opera by Julius Weismann (1930)\n\nDie Gespenstersonate opera by Aribert Reimann (1984)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nTörnqvist, Egil.
