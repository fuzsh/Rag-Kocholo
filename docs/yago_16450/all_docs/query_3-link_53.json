        "text": "Notable University of Kentucky Scientist to Lead RD1’s Wood-Finishing Exploration\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. – RD1 Spirits—the Lexington-based, bourbon brand with more than 90 national and international awards for its portfolio—leaned in even further to its wood-finishing focus with the creation of a new role, Research and Development Master Distiller.\n\nFormer University of Kentucky distilling researcher and instructor Jarrad Gollihue, PhD, will lead this science-heavy position, overseeing RD1’s wood-finishing operations and experiments with new woods at RD1 Distillery at The Commons, slated to open in January 2025.\n\nRD1’s Kentucky Straight Bourbon will continue to be crafted by 8th-generation Master Distiller Jacob Call at Western Kentucky Distilling in Beaver Dam, Ky.\n\n“The R&D Master Distiller role enhances our business and operational focus on stellar Kentucky Straight Bourbon and its intersection with unique wood from across the world,” said Mike Tetterton, chief executive officer of RD1. “We are fortunate to have a relationship with Western Kentucky Distilling and Jacob Call to supply our bourbon and now to layer in the expertise of Dr. Gollihue in our distillery lab with his focus on innovation on wood. RD1’s powerful distilling and finishing team will help us continue to write the next chapter in bourbon.”\n\nPreviously, Dr. Gollihue was technical director and post-doctoral scholar at the University of Kentucky’s James B. Beam Institute. There, he led data-driven experiments focusing on yeast/fermentation issues, barrel charring, and flavor profiles from wood, and also taught numerous courses.\n\n“RD1 Distillery at The Commons will be a giant playground for me,” said Dr. Gollihue, who is also leading the build-out efforts of the facility, which is expected to produce experimental barrels and potential surprise tastings for consumer tours. “I’ve always been fascinated with distillation science—changing variables in fermentation and cooking temperatures—and nature’s powerful role in creating bourbon. For me, working on two things at the same time—novel wood and its natural influence on whiskey—is my way of using science to produce art.”\n\nA native Kentuckian, Dr. Gollihue earned his doctoral and bachelor’s degrees from the University of Kentucky. For the last decade, the study of food science and oak physiology have been his main professional focus. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on barrel variation impacts from cooperage on whiskey maturation. At the university, he taught courses on distillation science and production. His undergraduate studies in horticulture, also at the University of Kentucky, opened doors to enology and eventually to whiskey distillation.\n\n“There’s always been a thread to my research,” Dr. Gollihue added. “I’m most fascinated by the flavor development we get from trees and plants, and how varieties in grains and wood can dramatically impact bourbon. When it comes to wood species, there’s a big world of flavor out there just waiting to be discovered, and there’s plenty of ground that no one has touched. Those nuanced notes are what get me excited every day.”\n\n“Dr. Gollihue is one of a kind in this industry,” added RD1 director of product innovation Don Hardwick, who has over 30 years of experience in Kentucky bourbon production. “His specific focus from crop to finished cases is a natural complement to our brand’s unique interest. It’s a beautiful marriage of the science of our land and Kentucky Straight Bourbon.”\n\nDr. Gollihue has co-authored ten publications and played a key role in 32 conference presentations on barrel chemistry, barrel toasting and charring, corn, barley varieties, spent grains, lab-scale methodology and wood staves. He and his wife, who is also a scientist, have a young son and reside in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nUpon opening in early 2025, RD1 Distillery at The Commons will include an 800-gallon pot still that is the hub of the operation. In addition, the location will also house a 175-gallon pot still, a 750-gallon fermenter, and a 1,000-gallon mash cooker. This stop on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail® will offer additional customized experiences for guests to learn about the heart of RD1, Kentucky Straight Bourbon, and wood finishing.\n\nRD1 Distillery at The Commons will honor Lexington’s bourbon history—dating back to 1865—while showcasing bourbon’s modern-day innovation. The two-story, 10,215 square-foot brand destination will include an interactive, history-meets-innovation experience of Lexington’s bourbon milestones; a fermentation-to-distillation tour; private tasting rooms; glass-enclosed R&D labs for wood finishing and barrel thieving; a VIP speakeasy tasting room; a craft cocktail bar; a gift shop; and space for private events.\n\n###\n\nAbout RD1 Spirits\n\nBased in Lexington, Kentucky, RD1 Spirits exists to explore the bourbon frontier. Lexington entrepreneurs founded the company in 2020 to help give life to the stories of Lexington’s bourbon firsts, namely its first federally registered distillery, established in 1865. RD1 is paving its own path, focusing on Kentucky Straight Bourbon and its interaction with various wood finishings in the barrel.
