Multiple workstations can be customized to specific needs in a system that oversees navigation, monitoring and propulsion systems.\n\nAccording to Telemar, the system “brings modern functionality and appeal to vessels with outdated control panels. The interactive touchscreen user interface offers a comprehensive and unique user experience. Programs, tabs, and data can be moved around with ease and projected onto additional displays in and outside of the console with an innovative overhead glass band.”\n\nTelemar created the T-Master Touch with Italian design firm Pariani and in addition to function, acts as a sleek and stylish talking point The first system is now in use on M/Y Kathryn, a Codecasa 58 that Telemar installed the system on at its Viareggio headquarters over the summer.\n\nThanks to its 2017 acquisition of Livewire Connections, Telemar can also offer IT and service packages, while its BridgeLink offers IoT solutions.\n\nTopics:"
