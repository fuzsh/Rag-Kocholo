        "text": "I would like to introduce you to an exciting product, one you may or may not have come across in your farm market travels: the Kiwi Berry. Not quite a kiwi and certainly not your traditional berry, the Kiwi Berry is a unique, smooth-skinned fruit (a cousin of the well-known kiwi) that originated in the temperate, coastal regions of Russia and China. Though they make look different on the outside, the inside of the berry bares a striking resemblance to their New Zealand-native cousin. Some even say they taste similar, too.\n\nI drove out to Kathy Glahn’s Kiwi Berry Farm in Gettysburg, PA earlier this week to learn more about this not-so-common, but certainly delicious fruit. Driving up the driveway, I found myself surrounded by rows of beautiful green vines to my right and left, encompassing an adorable little home in which Kathy and her husband, Jeff, reside. I knocked on the door and was greeted by a beautiful dog, an inquisitive cat, and Jeff. I was soon taken to the back where Kathy stood among the vines, clearly in her place of happiness and peace.\n\nKathy certainly knows a lot about agriculture and farming. She grew up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin where she later met Jeff. After several moves, they ended up in their current residence in Pennsylvania. Kathy began growing micro greens and other produce for local gourmet restaurants. As soon as she discovered kiwi berries, Kathy decided to devote all of her time to raising these hardy little fruits. She first found them in a nursery in New York where she met a grower and soon began the long process of growing and cultivating them.\n\nKiwi berry vines take a long time and a lot of effort to bear fruit. There is no fruit on a male vine, only flowers. Pollination, which takes place near the end of May, happens by strategically intermingling male and female vines and a female vine must be 4-5 years old before it can produce fruit. A study done by Penn State and Cornell University determined that more pollination occurs from wind than from traditional methods (such as bees), and therefore male vines are placed on prevailing wind sides.\n\nAround the beginning of September, Kathy will start checking the sugar levels of the berries to determine when the proper harvest time will occur. Much like avocados, kiwi berries are better picked when they’re almost ripe. They are picked, placed in cold storage, and taken out the Tuesday before a market. This way, they are at optimum ripeness for the weekend markets. This is something that Kathy stresses to her customers – kiwi berries hold very well in cold storage up to 4 weeks!\n\nLittle did I know, there are many different varieties of kiwi berries, and they all have their own distinct attributes and flavors. The most popular is the Passion Popper, which will be the first crop of kiwi berries at the markets. According to Kathy, they have a kiwi-strawberry flavor that customers go crazy for. Then there is the Anna variety, which is a little more susceptible to bugs, so the harvest is usually smaller than other kinds. The Anna has a kiwi-pear flavor. Other varieties include the Red Princess (strong kiwi taste and a red interior), the Dumbarton Oak (strong lime flavor), and the Michigan, which has a slightly less acidic, mild kiwi flavor. Kathy is very passionate about educating her customers and is determined to help customers distinguish between the varieties of kiwi berries.\n\nKathy’s Kiwi Berries will be coming to Bethesda Central Farm Market on the weekend of September 13. I strongly encourage you to put that date on your calendar, plan to be there and taste these amazing fruits. Come talk to Kathy and let her tell you all about kiwi berries – her passion for this product is palpable. I guarantee you’ll learn so much about these hardy treats, just like I did.\n\nI thought I knew chocolate. After years of eating, baking with and learning about chocolate, I really believed I had a good grasp on the subject. That was until I met Ismael, the owner of Chocotenango. He has taught me more about the complexities, intricacies and important aspects of chocolate-making than I ever knew. Ismael knows more about the subject than anyone I’ve ever had the pleasure to interview, and while I’d love to tell you all everything I learned, this is a blog and I must refrain from turning it into a novel! So instead, I’ll tell you all about Ismael and his delicious chocolates that can be found every Sunday at the Bethesda Central Farm Market.\n\nIsmael is originally from Algeria. Since 1994, he has worked as a professional chef doing pastry, savory and chocolate work for prestigious restaurants in London, DC and Boston. In 2002, he and his wife moved to Guatemala where Ismael volunteered for Habitat for Humanity and worked at a few restaurants, while his wife settled into an international health job. One day, he realized “This town has no chocolate!” He decided to use this as an opportunity to create his own business, and six months later Chocotenango got it’s start.\n\nThe name has a very simple meaning. In Guatemala, a lot of the towns end with the word “-tenango” which translates to “place of.” While taste-testing and brainstorming with friends, he came up with the name Chocotenango, which literally means “place of chocolate!” This is quite fitting as the Mayans were the first civilization to discover chocolate and created its many uses we know today. From 2004 to 2008, Ismael taught himself everything he needed to know in order to start and maintain a successful chocolate business.\n\nIn 2008, Ismael was awarded 1st place at the 13th International Gastronomy Festival of Guatemala for his famous cardamom truffle. Soon after, he sold his company to a friend (who has successfully continued the business since), and took a year and half off to travel the world with his wife. They traveled from Chile to Colombia and from Cape Town to Egypt. Ismael used these travels as inspiration for the next iteration of his business. In 2010, Ismael’s wife got a job and the two of them moved to DC.\n\nIsmael spent some time as a chef at The Four Seasons, but when Union Kitchen opened in 2013, he jumped at the chance to continue his passion of chocolate-making. For the first 6 months, he worked both at the restaurant and on his chocolates. He soon realized that if he wanted it done right, he’d have to put his entire self into it. He now spends all of his time painstakingly handling every step of the process himself- from recipe creation to packaging. It takes him 2 whole days to make 800 bars of chocolate. His filled chocolates originally came in 18 different flavors, which he is slowly reducing to 9. Everything is done by hand, much of his time spent working in the walk-in refrigerator so as to keep the product as cold resulting in a very high quality!\n\nAt the markets, Ismael sells his signature chocolate bars in 4 flavors; two milk and two dark. He also sells boxed chocolates in various delicious flavors (like Chipotle Chili and Seven Spices), hot chocolate mixes, chocolate lollipops and more. Recently, he has added a new product to the mix, something he created using a method called “panning.” It is essentially a way for chocolatiers to evenly cover objects with a delicious layer of chocolate. Ismael will have panned goji berries, hickory smoked almonds, salted coffee caramel, espresso beans and dried blueberries at his stand from now on.\n\nIsmael sells his products to a few small shops in the area, but farm markets are where he really shines. The sheer knowledge this man has about his product is a drawing point to his stand. I implore you to start a conversation with him- ask him anything you have ever wanted to know about chocolate- from the history to the harvest, I promise he will blow you away with his insight. Stop by his stand for a taste- he always has his chocolate ready for a customer to try it and love it.\n\nAnd now you know all about Ismael and his business. Next time I’ll have time to talk to you about the chocolate itself! Stay tuned…\n\nConnect with Chocotenango online – like them on Facebook and follow them on Twitter!\n\nLucas Brownback has lived on Spiral Path Farm his whole life. Located near Loysville, PA, the farm has been the home of his parents and family for 36 years. He and his brother work the 255 acres themselves, planting and harvesting all of their produce with such personal care and detail, it’s amazing they have time for anything else! The farm was certified organic in 1994 and twenty years later, the Brownback family is still wholly committed to continuing their sustainable and organic practices. I was lucky enough to visit the farm on a beautiful day in early August, and what I saw really opened my eyes to this type of farming.\n\nWhen I drove up, Lucas was on his knees picking herbs from a beautiful garden planted directly in front of his parents’ house. His father, a hobby-builder, designed the house himself. With views of the Pennsylvania mountains surrounding the farm, Spiral Path is truly a sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of the urban existence that I’ve known my whole life. The perfectly manicured and expertly organized rows of crops are breathtaking, reflecting the amount of work that goes into running a farm of this size.\n\nThe reason for my initial surprise was simply the sheer size of the whole operation. If you’ve seen Lucas’ stand at the Bethesda Central Farm Market, you’ll agree- it’s very unassuming. Beautiful produce, sure, but you would never guess the magnitude of their farm operation. Lucas tells me that much of their produce is actually sold wholesale at Wegmans, with the other majority going to their CSA customers – a great way for subscribers to receive “a wide variety of local in-season foods harvested at the peak of their ripeness, flavor, vitamin and mineral content.” The abundant bounty of produce we see at Spiral Path’s stand every weekend is nothing compared to what this farm produces on a regular basis!\n\nLucas only takes cash at the market. He might be one of the few vendors who continues this practice. To him, it’s a matter of principle. His goal is to keep the middleman out of the process – to promote the cash going to the producer with no hands in between. Although he will admit that this might prohibit some sales, to him, the message is the most important part. And he’ll tell you, “I drove all the way out here to bring you food, you can put in the effort to stop by the ATM on your way here!” As a patron, he said that to me when I asked about the cash-only policy. I totally got it! And I really appreciate where he’s coming from.\n\nStop by the Spiral Path Farm Stand on Sundays and take in the beautiful array of vibrant, colorful organic produce that Lucas and his whole family work so hard to bring to us. They have a wonderfully tasty salad mix, super fresh kale, beautiful eggplants, tomatoes, zucchini and a variety of squashes. Ask him about the farm and talk to him about what you do with your veggies. He’s always there with the biggest smile, waiting to help you eat healthfully, locally and sustainably.\n\nMeet Mark Bishop. He’s the father of the thriving, Master’s Touch. I say “father” because while he is the head of the company, it was actually his son, Jonathan, who started the business. Fresh out of high school, Jonathan used his passion for plants to germinate a unique business from their backyard.\n\nMark and Jonathan, along with the help of Mark’s other son, hand crafted the three greenhouses and a vegetable garden that are now located next to their home in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia.\n\nThey began with caring for fig trees. Within no time they found themselves growing everything from vegetables like squash, cucumbers, figs, leeks, and beans to more rare and exotic plants that can now be found in their greenhouses. Mark and Jonathan pride themselves on specializing in exotic, fruiting trees from around the world. Their greenhouses contain specialties such as grape plants, fig trees, olive trees, pepper plants, jasmine, stevia plants and so much more. They also grow and sell various annuals and perennials at the markets each week.\n\nEverything the Bishops grow is sold at local farmers markets. Master’s Touch sells at Bethesda Central Farm Market and two other markets that are located near their hometown. The family happily consumes the product that doesn’t get sold.\n\nWalking through the busy Bethesda Central Farm Market, one plant is destined to catch your eye with its is gigantic green and purple leaves. This specialty plant is an exotic fruiting tree from Peru called Naranjilla. The fruit that grows on this tree is a cross between an orange and a kiwi and is used in many dishes in Peru. Another large interesting plant found at their weekly stand is what they call the “sensitive plant.” You have to see it, or touch it to believe it. When the leaves of this plant are touched, the plant’s cells react to the moisture on your fingertips and the leaves retract, like all the fingers closing into a fist!\n\nI encourage you to stop by Master’s Touch for a chat the next time you are at the market. Whether it is Mark or Jonathan manning the booth, they are more than happy to answer any questions you may have, as well as acquaint you with some of their exotic species and give you the back stories on their acquisition.\n\nFor their loyal customers at Bethesda Central Farm Market, Master’s Touch is offering a one-time discount on Sunday, August 3. Four of their more interesting plants will be on sale to readers of the blog! The Passionflower will be discounted by $5, the Naranjilla will be $10 off. They’ll also take $10 off the price of the Chicago Hardy Fig Tree and the Spanish Olive Tree!"
