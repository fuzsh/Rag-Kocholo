Lady. Jen Duplessis, I wanted to share with you today my friend George Chanos. He is the former Attorney General in Vegas and has moved on to bigger and better things in his life. And I'm so excited because he's having a really, really cool event. April 24th, is that right? April 25th, 26th and 27th. I'm flying out on the 24th, that's why I've got already have my tickets, but April 25th? 26th and 27th, a full three day event called you Evolution instead of revolution or Evolution, Evolution. So George, tell us about this event because I know it's connecting with greatness and you know a lot of people when they see that name, they might be going, OK, so is this, is this going to be something for healers and people like that or is this for business people? Who's this event for? Yeah, good, good question. So it's for anyone who wants to move their life forward from where they are today to where they want to be, right? So if you want a different life, you need to do something different than what you're doing, right? If if you keep doing the same thing, you're going to keep getting the same results. So you need to pivot and adapt. You need to change what it is that you're doing to move forward. And that could be, you know, do more of what you're doing, accelerate what you're doing, or it could mean pivot. And do something entirely different. So this all began essentially with the idea that there is a technological tsunami on the horizon and I think what is going to and and I know a little bit about that because I've spent years researching this is millennial semi a mindset for the 21st century right where I talk about the future. I I'm a trained researcher and analyst and complex. Problem solver and I've been looking at what's going on in the world and almost, let's see 2019, four years ago, five years ago now, I published this book and told people that there are radical changes that are coming. So what will surprise everyone is the speed of change and the magnitude of change. And some people are talking about this, but not a lot of people and. Not enough people? And it's going to cause disruption. It's going to change the world we live in. Frankly, it's going to change everything about it over time. And it's not going to take a lot of time because AI increases at a rate that dwarfs what we've seen over the past 50 years with computers. So 50 years ago, Gordon Moore of Intel postmated Moores law said that computing power would 88 every 18 months and. Having cost that's happened for the past 50 years, that's now out the window with AI. The increases will be multiples of 10101 thousand 10,000, not multiples of doubling, right. So you're going to get this just incredible growth of technology and how is that going to affect the lives that we live in? I, I, I read a great quote the other day, AI will not replace humans, humans that use AI. Will replace humans that don't. And so you really need to embrace this technology and you need to learn how to use this technology and leverage it. So if you, whatever your ambitions are, if you want to open up a business, if you want to travel around the world in a van, if you want to be a digital nomad, you know whatever it is that you want to do, there are certain things that you need to do to empower yourself. You need to generate income. Right. You need to learn how to leverage this technology to increase your productivity. Because other people are going to be doing that. And if you're not doing that, you're really going to fall way behind the curve. So evolution is divided into 4 pillars. It's business, which is everything. Business. What do you need to know about business to survive, thrive and have a better life, right? That could be everything from how to form a business, how to draft a business plan, how to, how to pick the right idea as opposed to wasting time on the wrong idea. Right. How to put together a team, how to raise capital. So business is one part of a better life, Lifestyle is another pillar of evolution. So, so you know, travel, nutrition, meditation, mindfulness, right. What do you need to learn about these things. So we'll we'll bring in business experts that can help you in the in the areas of business, we'll bring in AI experts that can teach you about cutting edge technology, we'll bring in. Healers and meditators and yoga practitioners and Breathwork practitioners that can teach you about lifestyle and how to improve your lifestyle. Improve your health, which is a core component of your success, right? Being healthier, you know in what you're doing. 1/3 component is community, right? We're trying to give you a community that you can belong to that is based on a simple premise, which is people helping people. So there's no selling at au volution event from stage, right? So nobody's there pitching you on trying to get a bunch of money out of you. We're just empowering you, right? We're just you pay for your ticket, you come and you're not going to be sold, you're going to be. Educated you're going to have value delivered to you. We're going to try to over deliver value. So community is the third component. And community also involves the issues of the day. What are the big issues? Right. Immigration at the border, you know, inflation, the war in Ukraine. We're going to talk about these issues and we're going to try to give you new insights into these issues, things that you don't know, that will better prepare you to make good decisions, right? Who should you be? We're not going. It's not political. We're not going to try to tell you who to vote for. You know, I'm a centrist. But we're going to educate you. We're going to tell you what we know and we're going to do, you know, we're going to very civilly and very in a very loving way. We're going to talk about these issues right very gracefully and and and with with respect to one another. And then the final pillar is core values. There are certain things that ancient core values that have helped every generation in, in, in. The course of evolution to succeed, right? Character, courage, commitment, compassion, these types of values. So we'll be talking about these values and we'll be sharing our views on these values. And at the end of the day, what evolution is about is people helping people. So the idea. Is to bring in people like you, Jen. Right. People who have done things in their lives, right, who want to give back and want to help other people do great things in their lives. And you know, what have you learned along the way? What lessons do you have to share? Right. So we'll bring in Connor Fields. He's an Olympic gold medalist. He, he won the men's gold in Barcelona in 2016 in BMX. He was the favorite to win the gold in Tokyo in 2020. Got into a tragic accident with a French cyclist and he became brain damaged and he had to retrain himself to walk and to talk. And he is now an NBC commentator. He's the voice of outdoor Nevada. He's a charismatic 27 year old figure who at 12 years old wrote on the wall of his garage. I'm going to win an Olympic gold medal. So what has his journey been from 12 years old through Barcelona winning the gold medal? Through Tokyo getting into a a life threatening, you know catastrophe. Having to relearn to walk and talk. You want to talk about commitment. You want to learn about courage. You want to learn about commitment. What can you learn from a guy like this? We're bringing in Dan maybes. Dan makes bought a wrote a book called the Spatial Web. It's one of the most visionary books that I've ever read. He is an AI scientist. He was working on IBM's Big Blue when it beat Kasparov. The chest He now has formed a publicly traded AI company called Verses. He has as his chief scientist, the most widely cited AI scientist in the world. So what can we learn from an AI visionary on the future of AI? I'm sure you've got a lot of questions, you know, how will AI impact humanity? Will it take over? You know, will humans be threatened? What are what are the upsides? What are the downsides? You know, asking those questions? Someone like Dan Mapes is an extraordinary opportunity and listening to his answers and and hearing his insights. James ***** right And having access to be able to ask him questions and things too.\n\nTo view or add a comment, sign in"
