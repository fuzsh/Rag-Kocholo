        "text": "'The Master Touch' (aka) 'Un Uomo Da Rispettare' (1972) is what can be genuinely described as an unsung poliziotteschi classic. Outside of 'Escape From Death Row' (1973) this appears to be director, Michele Lupo's only exciting foray into the appealingly grimy idiom of Italian crime cinema, and that's a great shame, since maestro, Lupo's pleasingly brisk, stylishly mounted, gloriously acrobatic actioner is arguably up there with the very best of 'em! The engagingly simple premise is slickly handled: Steve Wallace (Kirk Douglas), a seasoned heist expert is encouraged to attempt the seemingly impossible blag of removing $1.000.000 from what initially appears to be a wholly impenetrable fortress masquerading as a bank! Master Touch's stunning set pieces are fashioned with a clockwork precision, Lupo's refreshingly masculine 70s thriller retains its timeless fascination!\n\nWhat separates this classy offering from many other lesser titles is the hugely charismatic presence of Hollywood icon, Kirk Douglas, whose roguish, insouciant exterior belies the steely heart of a truly exemplary, meticulously minded thief. As Kirk's better half, the always delightful, Florinda Bolkan has, sadly, little to do outside of sporadic brooding, plus a soup√ßon of crotch-expanding smoulder, yet Bolkan's lustrous presence offers a more than welcome distraction to Master Touch's brawny machismo. The immensely likeable, physically adept, woefully underrated cinematic stud, Giuliano Gemma excels as the agile trapeze artist who is recruited to construct what appears to be a vacuum-tight alibi. Michele Lupo's compelling narrative includes a deliriously destructive, scalp-raising, cacophonous car chase through the dank streets of Hamburg, and the exquisitely shot heist is a veritable Boy's own dream! And it would be an even greater (Euro) crime not to mention the sublime, low key, uniquely atmospheric score by maestro, Ennio Morricone, whose majestic theme adds a terse piquancy to all the square jawed, sweaty-browed, Alpha Male theatrics!"
