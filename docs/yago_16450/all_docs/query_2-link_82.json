The bottom skirt flounce is a handkerchief style that creates great flow when worshiping the Living God through movement. This overlay also comes in a children version and an array of colors. Shown with our white unity bell sleeved top and palazzo pants which are sold separately. Our inspiration was:\n\nPsalm 19:7\n\nThe law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple."
