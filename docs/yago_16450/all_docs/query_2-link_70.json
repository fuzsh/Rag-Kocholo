        "text": "Our History\n\nThe Swartzentruber family started Green Acres in 1988 as a side business in addition to their produce farming. The business was conducted April – July, three days a week, along Rt. 145 in Allentown.\n\nThey started out selling wooden lawn furniture. As they became known throughout the Lehigh Valley and as business increased they made the decision to stop produce farming so they could better serve the growing demand for their products.\n\nIn 1991 a lot behind McDonalds became available that was perfect for the company’s growing needs. That same year a family partnership was formed and over the next several years the business continued to grow, adding sheds, gazebos, and playsets to their available products.\n\nIn 1999 they opened a second location in Easton, PA leasing a space from a nursery company. With more time and family personnel available they gradually began increasing the length of their season and daily hours.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001 there was a period of tremendous growth for the business. Several additional product lines were added and delivery/setup services were expanded.\n\nIn 2003 another significant decision was made to purchase a warehouse facility in Hamburg, PA.\n\nIn 2004 the family decided to create a home heating oil division to help offset the stagnant winter sales of outdoor products. They began to provide heating oil at fair prices to the entire Lehigh Valley.\n\nIn December of 2006, they purchased an additional property along Rt. 33 in Easton, PA, to meet the growing demand for their products, as well as facilitating significantly larger indoor and outdoor showroom. Since then they have continued to expand their indoor showroom and outdoor patio.\n\nIn 2007, an opportunity presented itself to open a location in Marietta, Georgia. Two employees from the Allentown and Hamburg locations were transferred there to establish our 3rd location. Green Acres of Marietta has now grown considerably, and is firmly established.\n\nToday Green Acres Outdoor Living has expanded their products to include: aluminum, wicker, poly and wooden patio furniture, storage sheds, garages, gazebos, pavilions, sunrooms, pool houses, pergolas, playsets, lawn décor, foot bridges, grills, Amish made indoor furniture, and much more.\n\nWe provide various services including: delivery/setup, shed moves, playset moves, site preparation, etc.\n\nOur goal as a team at Green Acres is to provide our friends and neighbors with outstanding products, fair prices, and great service. We look forward to meeting you and serving you!"
