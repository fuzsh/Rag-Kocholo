        "text": "Mercer University alumnus Nnamdi Onyekwuluje remembers times when as a student he needed to wear professional attire but didn’t have any.\n\n“I can remember being in undergrad and having to scramble for a blazer when I had something important to do on campus,” said Onyekwuluje, who graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in political science. “Back when I was at Mercer, the Salvation Army was still open on Mercer University Drive, and so I would run over there and grab a blazer for cheap and then be able to attend whatever important event that I had to.”\n\nNow Onyekwuluje has more than enough blazers and was among the first to donate some to the School of Business’s new professional clothing closet. The Blazers for Bears program aims to provide professional clothing to students who need it free of charge.\n\n“The goal is to eliminate barriers,” said Ashley Herman, associate director of career management services in the School of Business.\n\nThe business school offers opportunities throughout the year for students to meet with executives, she said, but some students would say they couldn’t go because they didn’t have a blazer.\n\nInitially, the closet will offer primarily men’s and women’s blazers. Neckties also are available for the men, and some faculty members donated pearls for the women, Herman said. If the program is successful, it may expand to include more professional attire in the future.\n\nBlazers for Bears began accepting donations of gently used blazers and ties this summer, and more are needed. Donations may be dropped off at Stetson Hall — Room 250 or the lobby of the dean’s office — in Macon or the School of Business in Atlanta. Donors also may contact Herman at 478-301-5799 or herman_ag@mercer.edu to arrange pick up. All sizes and styles are accepted.\n\nThe closet will open to students Sept. 3. Blazers and ties may be borrowed for a two-week period and then returned to the closet. At the end of the academic year, students will have the opportunity to take blazers home, Herman said.\n\nGem Cleaners will provide the School of Business with discounted cleaning for the blazers, and the location at 3330 Vineville Ave. in Macon will accept donations for the program. Students are not responsible for the cleaning."
