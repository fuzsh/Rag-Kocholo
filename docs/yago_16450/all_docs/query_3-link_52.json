        "text": "Featured Video\n\nThe informative video at the top of this article is provided by Fandom's Featured Video team and not the editors of this wiki. It may not accurately represent the article and contradict info on the wiki itself, so it should not be taken at face value. The info has become outdated over time, as these videos were made in 2018.\n\nElemental Masters Elemental Powers Elemental Powers (The LEGO Ninjago Movie)\n\n“They were the First Spinjitzu Master's guardians, each endowed with an Elemental Power that has passed down through generations.”\n\nElemental Masters are people who each have the ability to wield one of the many elements of the Merged Realms. In Ninjago, before the birth of his sons,[1] the First Spinjitzu Master shared his power with a number of individuals who became the realm's first Elemental Masters and the First Spinjitzu Master's guardians.[2][3] Their powers have been passed down for over a hundred generations,[4] so they could continue to be used to protect the world from all evil forces.\n\nDuring the First Serpentine War, the Elemental Masters of the era allied to protect the citizens from the Serpentine and formed Elemental Alliance. However, thanks to Chen's careful manipulation, they became divided and were scattered across the world for years. Ironically, it was Chen's Tournament of Elements that brought their descendants together to form a new Elemental Alliance against the threat of the Anacondrai Cultists.\n\nWhen Clouse freed Nadakhan from the Teapot of Tyrahn, the deceptive Djinn sought revenge on the ninja for the destruction of his home realm. Using the Djinn Blade, Nadakhan imprisoned all the Elemental Masters in the weapon,[5] except Jay, Nya, and Skylor, who fought against the Sky Pirates. Jay eventually made his final wish, which reversed all the recent events, causing the Elemental Masters to be freed from the Sword of Souls.\n\nAfter the Fall of Ninjago, most of the Elemental Masters from the Tournament of Elements returned to help fight the Sons of Garmadon and Garmadon himself by joining Lloyd and Nya's Resistance to save Ninjago City.\n\nAfter the Merge, a new generation of Elemental Masters came to existence, with new elemental powers being created and elements that didn't have any users finding new hosts.\n\nSuccession[]\n\nAn Elemental Master's power is most typically known to be passed down from parent to child. If the parents are both Elemental Masters, the child is either born with one or the other of the parents' powers. When a child inherits their parent's power, the parent loses their element.[6] However, it's currently unknown whether Elemental Masters instantly lose their powers after having children or their powers fade away gradually.\n\nGenerally, there cannot be two masters of an element at once, the one known exception being the Time Twins, who are twin brothers. In most cases, if twins are born to an Elemental Master, the firstborn will inherit the element.[7][8] In the case of Zeatrix and Beatrix, the former inherited their father's power because she was the oldest by a few minutes. However, Acronix and Krux are a special case because the power of Time is easily divisible, allowing for it to be distributed among the two as different abilities derived from the same power.[9]\n\nIt is also possible for an Elemental Master to willingly pass their power to someone who is not their descendant, as the former Master of Ice gave his powers to Zane, a Nindroid.[10] If an Elemental Master dies before they pass on their power, it will usually find a new host.[11][12] Nya has stated that powers can skip a generation,[13] but this may be incorrect.[14]\n\nThose related to the First Spinjitzu Master appear not to lose their powers upon their children gaining theirs, as Garmadon and Lloyd are able to have the same power at the same time. Their powers are not truly \"elements,\" nor are they Elemental Masters in the same sense the others are.\n\nElemental essences[]\n\nNote: The term \"elemental essence\" is conjecture based on creator statements. While it is a concept that exists in the Ninjago universe, it has not been given an official name.\n\nThese are powers that aren't considered 'elements' in the conventional sense and instead are what remains of the power of the First Spinjitzu Master.[15] The users of these abilities are generally not referred to as Elemental Masters with the exception of Lloyd, though he isn't one either.[16] Elemental Masters is the term for the people who were granted the elements by the First Spinjitzu Master himself (with the apparent exception of Nyad and the Original Master of Amber, as the master did not control Water, and the latter created Amber himself), and those who inherited their powers via descendancy or otherwise.\n\nGolden Power[]\n\nGolden Power is related to the powers of Creation, originally used by the First Spinjitzu Master. It is the opposite of Darkness. It is usually seen as a stronger form of Creation and Energy and is thus a combination of the four elements of Creation (Fire, Earth, Lightning, and Ice). Unlike Creation, the Golden Power is used primarily for offensive energy attacks and making \"constructs\" that appear to be mostly made of energy rather than matter. Although, the user is also able to create and control large amounts of the four elements of Creation. Its Spinjitzu is bright gold as it's associated with the color gold, and corresponds with the Golden Dragon. Unlike Lloyd, Master Wu and Garmadon aren't able to use the Golden Power, as their powers are not as refined as his.\n\nFirst Spinjitzu Master\n\nLloyd Garmadon (formerly)\n\nThe Overlord (as the Golden Master; formerly)\n\nCreation[]\n\nCreation is the opposite of Destruction and is one of the remaining essences of the First Spinjitzu Master. Its Spinjitzu is a dull gold and yellow (as opposed to Golden Power's brighter gold Spinjitzu), which is the color it is associated with and corresponds with the Master Wu's dragon. It is composed of Earth, Fire, Ice, and Lightning. It grants the power of materiokinesis, giving the user the ability to create and manipulate both organic and inorganic matter and use it for multiple purposes or as Master Wu said while describing the Tornado of Creation, \"create something, out of nothing.\" As demonstrated with the Tornado of Creation, the ninja creating things like a massive Ferris Wheel, a gigantic slingshot, and the Ultra Sonic Raider. Also, the user can manipulate the four elements of Creation, due to creation being composed of them.\n\nFirst Spinjitzu Master\n\nWu\n\nGarmadon (with True Potential)\n\nEnergy[]\n\nEnergy is one of the most powerful elemental abilities in Ninjago[17] It is the element with the most potential, as its master is destined to become the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master. It also grants the user ergokinesis, manifesting itself as the color green. It allows the user to shoot powerful energy projections, create an energy force field, summon an energy motorcycle, and enhance the energy of objects (turning them green on occasions). Its Spinjitzu is green and corresponds with the Energy Dragon.\n\nLloyd Garmadon\n\nDarkness[]\n\nDarkness is the opposite of Golden Power (in some cases it represents evil and shadow) and is closely tied to Destruction.[18] It corresponds with the Overlord and the Island of Darkness and is associated with the colors lavender and pink. It grants the power to control/manipulate darkness (shadow), allowing them to shoot powerful dark beams, propel themselves forward (often through the air), create a field of absolute darkness, and create dark crystals. A form of it made up the Great Devourer's venom, which then coursed through Garmadon's veins, corrupting him.\n\nThe Overlord\n\nDestruction[]\n\nDestruction is the opposite of Creation. It is an essence of the First Spinjitzu Master and is closely tied to and influenced by Darkness.[18] It is the opposite of Creation and is dark purple. It gives the user control over destructive energy and mastery over dark magic.\n\nOni\n\nMystake\n\nThe Omega\n\nFirst Spinjitzu Master\n\nGarmadon\n\nLloyd Garmadon\n\nElemental Masters, their descendants, and their elements[]\n\nElements of Creation[]\n\nFire[]\n\nFire is one of the Elements of Creation.

Tox and Mr. Pale had already been released in Ultra Agents sets, as their designs in the show were chosen to allow fans to obtain more of the Elemental Masters in minifigure form;[19] but they both received new minifigures in Dragons Rising's sets on the occasion of the Tournament of the Sources, likely so they have minifigures in the Ninjago theme instead of only in Ultra Agents. Karlof, Griffin Turner, and Skylor were released in the Tournament of Elements wave in 2015; Shade and Ash were released in a 2017 battle pack; and Neuro was released in a Toys R Us exclusive minifigure pack in 2017; Bolobo, Gravis, and Jacob Pevsner were released in a Ninjago: Legacy set; and Chamille was released in a Ninjago: Dragons Rising set. She was supposed to be included in the aforementioned Legacy set, but production issues led to her being omitted.[20] Along with Jacob, Chamille is one of two Elemental Masters Tommy Andreasen said he would like to see made into minifigures.[21]\n\nThe only Elemental Masters who returned in Hunted were those who had physical minifigures at the time, apart from Ash. While it was explained Bolobo was a captive and Chamille became \"bad\", it is unknown where Jacob, Gravis, and Ash were.\n\nScrapped Elemental Masters include the Masters of Magnetism, Crystal, and Sight, with the Master of Crystal being called \"Gazor\".[22][23] Water and Time were both considered for Tournament of Elements but were not used until later.[24][25]\n\nIt was previously unknown how Zane was an Elemental Master, him being a Nindroid without any biological connections to an Elemental Master.\n\nAn unidentified Elemental Master, whose clothing indicates his origins are related to cold temperatures, can be seen in the flashback from \"Spellbound.\"\n\nIn The Hands of Time, it was revealed that this previously unknown Elemental Master was the Master of Ice during the Serpentine War. Somehow he gave Zane his Ice, as revealed in \"Snake Jaguar.\"\n\nA dull gold-colored dragon appears in a flashback in \"Spellbound,\" being ridden by an unidentified Elemental Master. The dragon's appearance strongly resembles that of the Gravity Dragon, yet its rider is not the Elemental Master of Gravity, who was also around in that time period. According to Tommy Andreasen, this Elemental Master is most likely the Master of Form taking on an appearance.[26]\n\nAll of the main colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, gray, black, and white) correspond with at least one element.\n\nIn addition, every element corresponds with at least one color (be it main or not), except for Light.\n\nA character named Lar appeared in a Tournament of Elements activity book, supposedly the Master of Water. However, this proved to be non-canon when Nya was revealed to be the Master of Water in the TV series.[27] In Way of the Departed, he was said to be a charlatan who spreads rumors that he was a Master of Water and fought in the Tournament of Elements.\n\nAcronix and Krux are the only Elemental Masters who had their powers stolen permanently and are the only two with the same elemental power.\n\nElemental Masters likely age differently than normal humans.[28][29] This can be observed with former Masters Ray, Maya, and Krux. Ray and Maya appear relatively young due to having their powers for a long time before losing them after the births of their children. Krux was stripped of his powers over forty years ago, rendering him a normal human, and thus he is an old man in the present.\n\nSometimes, elemental masters refer to each other by their elements rather than their names. This is seen in \"Lost in Time\" when the Master of Ice and Jay's mother refer to each other as \"Ice\" and \"Lightning\" and when Acronix refers to Kai and Nya (thinking they are Ray and Maya) as \"Fire and Water\".\n\nSome of the elements that Elemental Masters wield come from the dragons. The First Spinjitzu Master was born of the Oni and the Dragons, and therefore, had both their respective powers (Destruction from the Oni, and Golden Power/Creation from the Dragons). When the First Spinjitzu Master created Ninjago, he empowered his two sons with two of the strongest elements; his younger son, Wu, was gifted with Creation, and his older son, Garmadon, was granted Destruction.[30]\n\nBefore his sons, he presumably empowered a select group of humans with all the other elements he had at his disposal (i.e Poison, Metal, Fire). Firstbourne controls every element of her beloved spawn (Fire, Ice, Lightning, Earth, and Wind). It is unknown why dragons of any other elements do not exist.\n\nIt is also unknown why there is a Wind Dragon since the elemental power originally belonged to Wojira.\n\nAccording to Tommy Andreasen, he stated that all dragons before adolescence may temporarily use the Wind element before they get one of the four elements of Creation excluding the other secondary elements.[31]\n\nWhen asked who would be the last Elemental Master standing in an attempt to wipe all of them out, Tommy Andreasen said it would be Ash or Mr. Pale, as \"they are hard to nail.\"[32]\n\nIt would seem that when an Elemental Master dies while still in possession of their element, the element goes on to find a new host.[11][12]\n\nAccording to Tommy Andreasen, they were toying around with a character named Rayne who would have been the Elemental Master of Water. In addition, they would have appeared in Season 4.[25] However, the idea was scratched \"[m]ostly because there were other fun ideas and the idea was too ‘big’\" and \"It wasn’t needed.\"[33]\n\nA number of Elemental Masters—Ash, Bolobo, Chamille, Gravis, Shade, Cole's grandfather, the Elemental Master of Gravity, the Elemental Master of Shadow, the Elemental Master of Sound, and Morro—use versions of face and/or torso prints from other LEGO themes or previous ninja suits.\n\nDuring the first Serpentine War, Chen manipulated some Elemental Masters to fight for the Serpentine, such as Cole's grandfather via Hypnobrai hypnosis.[34][35]\n\nThe previous group of Elemental Masters consists of both the parents and grandparents of the current Elemental Masters. This is because one can be a parent at fewer than 20 years old and a grandparent at fewer than 40 years old.[36]\n\nElemental essence users like the First Spinjitzu Master, Garmadon, Wu, Lloyd, and the Overlord, are all either entirely or partly non-human.\n\nSkylor, a human, nearly died attempting to use Garmadon's Destruction through her Amber. Objects imbued with a high enough amount of Golden Power/Creation are well known to be fatal to the touch of any mortal who attempts to hold them.\n\nThe original Elemental Masters were not ninja, nor were they trained in the ninja arts, but rather, they were warriors.[37]\n\nWhen asked what the rest of the Elemental Masters were doing during the Overlord's and Preeminent's arrivals in Ninjago in the Nindroid crisis and ghost invasion respectively, Tommy Andreasen responded, \"They were all playing a illegal poker tournament off shore. I think? Or at least that's kind of plausible.\"[38]\n\nElemental Masters' bodies are probably stronger and more durable than normal humans.[39]\n\nWhen Elemental Masters use their powers, their eyes would sometimes glow or change to the colors of their elements.\n\nGallery[]\n\nCurrent Generation[]\n\nPrevious Masters[]\n\nMinifigures[]\n\nCurrent Generation[]\n\nPrevious Masters[]\n\nConcept art[]\n\nIn Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu[]\n\nThe images on Elemental Masters need to be organized.\n\nYou can help the Wiki by adding images to the appropriate section on \"Elemental Masters.\"\n\nThis template can be removed once images have been organized.\n\nIn Ninjago: Dragons Rising[]\n\nIn other media[]\n\nTranslations[]\n\nLanguage Name Chinese (Simplified) 元素大师 German Elementarmeister/Meister der Elemente Polish Mistrzowie żywiołów Ukrainian Майстри стихій Japanese エレメント・マスター\n\nReferences[]\n\nNinjago characters Heroes Cole · Jay · Kai · Lloyd · Master Wu · Nya · Zane Allies Cyrus Borg · Dareth · Falcon · Lord Garmadon · MiniPix Seven · Misako · P.I.X.A.L. · Ronin · Skylor Villains Acidicus · Acronix · Arkade · Aspheera · Anacondrai generals (Arcturus) · Attila · Avatar Harumi · Bansha · Barracudox · Bizarro Cole · Bizarro Jay · Bizarro Kai · Bizarro Zane · Blizzard Warriors (Grimfax) · Blizzard Sword Masters · Blizzard Archers · Commander Blunck · Boa Destructors · Bucko · Buffer · Buffmillion · Bunch · Bytar · Cardinsto · Cobra Mechanics · Cece · Char · Master Chen · Chew Toy · Chokun · Cyren · Chope · Chopper Maroon · Chris · \"Chuck\" · Clancee · Clouse · Cowler · General Cryptor · Cyrus · Daddy No Legs · Delara · Dogshank · Doubloon · Eyezor · Faith · Fangdam · Fang-Suei · Fangtom · Fenwick · Fire Fiends · First Mate · Flintlocke · Francis · Gahrann the Dreamer · Ghoultar · Ghurka · Giant Stone Warrior · Glutinous · Golden Vipers · Hackler · Harumi · Hazza D'ur · Hostess · Howla · Hypno Vipers · Insect Master · Iron Baron · Jet Jack · King Kalmaar · Kapau · Karenn · Killow · Kirchonn the Invincible · General Kozu · Krait · Krux · Kryptarium inmates (The Needles) · Lasha · Living Diamonds · Lizaru · Luke Cunningham · Maaray Guards (Gripe) · Supreme Commander Machia · Martin · Mask of Malice · Master of Amber · The Mechanic · Mezmo · Ming · Mister F · Moody · Mogra · Mohawk · Monkey Wretch · Morro · Mr. E · Muzzle · Nadakhan · Nails · Nineko · Nitro · No-Eyed Pete · Min-Droid · Miss Demeanor · Nindroid Drones · Nindroid Warriors · The Omega · Otto Pilot · The Overlord · Pitch · The Preeminent · Pyro Destroyers · Pyro Slayers · Pyro Whippers · Pyrrhus · Python Dynamite · Pythor · Quartet of Villains · Commander Raggmunk · Rattla · Re-Awakened · Red Visors (Red 27 · Red 29) · Red Vipers · Reflectra · Richie · Ritchie · Rivett · Rotten Rabbits · Samurai warrior · Sawyer · Scar the Skullbreaker · Scooter · Shadow Army · Shadow Wu · Six-Armed Warriors · Skip Vicious · Skreemers · Slackjaw · Skales · Skalidor · Sleven · Slithraa · Sly Vipers · Sneaky Snakes · Snake villain · Snappa · Snike · Captain Soto · Soul Archer · Spitta · Spyder · Sqiffy · Stalwart Dangerbuff · Stone Warriors · Stone Scouts · Stone Swordsmen · Sushimi · Sushimi's sushi chefs · Talon · Tanabrax · Tannin · Time Ninja · Toxic Vipers · Translucent Blue Viper · Translucent Orange Viper · Translucent Purple Vipers · Unagami · Ultra Violet · Vangelis · Vengestone Brutes · Vengestone Guards · Vengestone Warriors · Vermin · Vex · Wail · Warriors of Felis · Wooo · Wrayth · Viper Flyers · Master Yang · Yokai · Zoltar · Zugu Creatures Adam · Anacondrai serpent · Bahn · Balee · Bandit · Blue Dragon · Boreal · Chompy · The Chroma · Colossus · Crab monster · Crabby · Craglings (King Crag-Nor) · Dragon keeper · Dragonides · Empire Dragon · Fire Dragon (Core) · Fire Fang · Firstbourne · Fluffy · Geotomic Rock Monsters · Ghost Dragons · Gifting Goat · Great Devourer · Grief-Bringer · Guide Parrot · Henry · Ice Behemoth · Ice bird · Ice Serpent · Krag · Kuma · Large dragons · Legendary Dragon · Leviathans · Monster sushi · Mud monsters · Mystery Dust .
