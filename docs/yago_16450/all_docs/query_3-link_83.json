        "text": "There are four levels to play, each divided into three stages.\n\nYou start by learning the home row keys. Each stage builds on previous lessons, introducing new letters as you progress and giving you plenty of touch type practice. Youâll soon be touch typing like an expert! At the end of each level you can test your typing speed and get a fun reward.\n\nIn this level you will learn to type the letters x and z. You will also learn how to make capital letters and type three more keys: the apostrophe, slash and full stop.\n\nWhen you can do it well, touch typing is the fastest way to write. Many people quickly learn touch type faster than they can write with a pen. The important things to remember are:\n\nuse the correct fingers\n\nthere's no need to rush!\n\nfind a comfortable working position with support for your wrist and forearm\n\nYou should take a rest, and shake your hands and arms to relax your muscles if you get tired.\n\nIt's important not to look at your hands when you are learning to type. The best way to ensure that you don't look at your hands is to cover them up - you can make a simple box out of cardboard or wood to cover both the keys and your hands.\n\nYou will need headphones or speakers to enjoy the song and dance in each game."
