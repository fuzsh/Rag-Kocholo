        "text": "Thursday, August 22\n\nThank you, Blessed Apostle Saint Jude Thaddeus, for the promise of hope you hold out to all who believe, and inspire me to give this gift of hope to others\n\nas it has been given to me.\n\nAmen.\n\nWednesday, August 21\n\nGracious God,\n\nI don’t know what this day holds, but I know that you hold the day. It was you that laid the foundations of the Earth and therefore understand every part of it. I know that you keep the sun in the sky, the stars in place, and have created this Earth for me and all humanity to inhabit and enjoy.\n\nAmen.\n\nTuesday, August 20\n\nAlmighty God,\n\nIn your greatness, you humble yourself to show us what love really means. Help us learn from you in our humble service to one another. Do not let pride win over us, but let your Spirit work with us and in us so that we become your witnesses in spreading and sharing your love in all our words and deeds.\n\nAmen.\n\nMonday, August 19\n\nDear Lord,\n\nI seek your help today, and every day to weave my relationship with you into my heart, and soul. May I use all my mind and strength to spread your loving presence into every corner of my life. May the way I speak to others reflect your compassion; may the way I treat others reflect your boundless love, and may my thinking be transformed into hopeful action. I ask this through Jesus who shows me the way.\n\nAmen.\n\nSunday, August 18\n\nHelp me, Lord, to be compassionate like Mary, and be aware of the needs of those I encounter today. Like Mary, may I also turn to you for help and guidance on how to generously respond to those in need according to my abilities.\n\nAmen.\n\nSaturday, August 17\n\nEver-loving God,\n\nOur world is in need of your Peace. Fill the hearts of all peoples with honor for every human life. May your loving touch heal those who dwell in anger, pain and sorrow. May your Holy Spirit reconcile and unify strangers and neighbors.\n\nI, too, am in need of your Peace. Plant your words of healing and understanding within my heart. Give me strength to live peace, and speak peace, and be a peacemaker.\n\nI humbly ask this through your Son Jesus Christ, our Lord.\n\nAmen.\n\nFriday, August 16\n\nLoving God,\n\nWe give you thanks for the life of Philip Benizi, the Servite saint who placed his gifts at the service of others.\n\nHelp us to live our lives with his spirit of generosity. Like Philip, may we be your instruments of reconciliation and unity wherever we encounter conflict and strife.\n\nAs the steadfast service of Mary inspired Saint Philip, so too may we follow her footsteps as faithful and loving disciples of Jesus.\n\nWe ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nThursday, August 15\n\nGod our Father,\n\nAs we celebrate today the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven, call all your children to gather together to worship as our thanksgiving to you for this great feast of the Blessed among women. Her Assumption into your presence was your gift to her because of her perfect “Yes” to your will, as she freely and joyfully cooperated with your plan of salvation for all people when she accepted your offer to be the Mother of your Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. May we, too, say yes every day to your Holy Will, so as to be worthy of that Kingdom prepared by you for those worthy of your love and salvation. Grant all this through Christ our Lord.\n\nAmen.\n\nWednesday, August 14\n\nOh, generous God,\n\nYou have made us out of love and given us a free will to love you in return. Give me the grace today to be loving with my whole heart, by forgiving others as you have forgiven me. I only ask to be able to behave as your true creation.\n\nGive me the strength of character to act accordingly in my everyday interactions with respect, compassion, forgiveness, and mercy as your faithful follower. And to forgive others as you have forgiven me, and show the mercy you have shown to me. I need to think twice before responding to others without thinking. I want to act and be your messenger.\n\nAmen.\n\nTuesday, August 13\n\nGracious God,\n\nI pray for wisdom that is peaceable, gentle, and approachable, with lots of mercy and fairness to be shared with all. You said an unlimited supply of wisdom is available to me if I simply ask, so I pray for wisdom to know how to deal with the many people and situations that will cross my path.\n\nAmen.\n\nMonday, August 12\n\nDear Lord,\n\nWe pray for the constant protection and preservation of the beauty of your creation. Make us responsible and caring of the beauty of nature around us. May each of us, each day, little by little, take an initiative to get involved in the promotion of a clean and green environment. We ask all these prayers in Jesus’ Name.\n\nAmen.\n\nSunday, August 11\n\nMost holy Apostle, Saint Jude Thaddeus, friend of Jesus, I place myself in your care . Help me know that I need not face my troubles alone.\n\nPlease join me in my need, asking God to send me: consolation in my sorrow, courage in my fear, and healing in the midst of my suffering.\n\nAsk our loving Lord to fill me with the grace to accept whatever may lie ahead for me and my loved ones, and to strengthen my faith in God’s healing powers.\n\nThank you, Blessed Apostle Saint Jude Thaddeus, for the promise of hope you hold out to all who believe, and inspire me to give this gift of hope to others\n\nas it has been given to me.\n\nAmen.\n\nFriday, August 9\n\nGracious God,\n\nMay we extend your boundless hospitality to all who visit our sanctuary.\n\nMay we approach each person not as a mere visitor, but as a guest that we have prepared for and anxiously awaited their arrival.\n\nMay we encounter each and every Pilgrim as a brother or sister seeking you.\n\nMay our words, and actions, as well as the gardens, shrines, artwork, and chapels here surround them with your eternal message of hope, love and salvation.\n\nAmen.\n\nThursday, August 8\n\nDear God,\n\nThank you for another beautiful day. Thank you for no matter what the day brings, you are with us to guide and protect us. We pray for our families, friends, and co-workers, that they, too, may be reminded of the glory of this day. And we ask your blessing on those less fortunate than us. Keep them safe and give them hope for a better day.\n\nAmen.\n\nWednesday, August 7\n\nGracious and ever-loving God,\n\nWe ask your eternal blessing on the Chapel of Mary. May those seekers and pilgrims that visit our humble Chapel find peace, consolation, and perseverance.\n\nBless each of the Servite Priests and the Oblate Sisters of St. Martha who serve here.\n\nGathered, nourished and sent, may all who enter into this holy Chapel be prepared to love and serve you, O Lord, as well as our neighbor.\n\nAmen.\n\nTuesday, August 6\n\nAlmighty God,\n\nWe ask your help and guidance in our lives, to recommit ourselves so that we may remain faithful to you and to enter into new life that you have given us. Lead us everyday to the way of humility and openness to your will. We ask this through Christ, our Lord.\n\nAmen.\n\nMonday, August 5\n\nGracious God,\n\nWe are blessed to have this beautiful Sanctuary in the city.\n\nMay pilgrims and visitors feel welcomed as they are surrounded by the majesty of the tall cedars.\n\nMay the bird song, the rustling leaves, branches and the greeting of our staff allow all who visit to lay down their burdens here.\n\nMay they feel your loving mercy, and be inspired by the images of angels and saints to follow your Son Jesus more sincerely.\n\nAnd may Blessed Mary offer her humble encouragement as visitors pray, explore, seek and learn.\n\nAs our visitors leave this place may they be filled with the gift of compassion and hope.\n\nAmen.\n\nFriday, August 2\n\nA Prayer to Saint Jude\n\nMost holy Apostle, Saint Jude Thaddeus, friend of Jesus, I place myself in your care.

Grant us generosity and make our hearts charitable.\n\nWe ask this through Christ Jesus our Lord and Savior. Amen.\n\nTuesday, July 30\n\nSt. Joseph Prayer\n\nO Blessed Saint Joseph, who felt the worry and sorrow of a parent along with Blessed Mary, your spouse and the Mother of Jesus, when the child Jesus was lost in the Temple in Jerusalem: protect our dear children now and always.\n\nMay you, O Blessed Joseph, foster father of Jesus, be their special foster father with God and Mary in heaven. Let our children, like Jesus, grow healthily in age, wisdom, and grace before God and all creation!\n\nWe humbly ask this of you, Blessed Saint Joseph, foster father of Our Lord himself!\n\nAmen.\n\nMonday, July 29\n\nLord God, may all who come to you in worship experience peace and joy.

This we pray and ask you, in Jesus’ Name.\n\nAmen.\n\nSunday, July 28\n\nLoving God, we give you thanks for the life of Philip Benizi, the Servite saint who placed his gifts at the service of others.\n\nHelp us to live our lives with his spirit of generosity. Like Philip, may we be your instruments of reconciliation and unity wherever we encounter conflict and strife.\n\nAs the steadfast service of Mary inspired Saint Philip, so too may we follow her footsteps as faithful and loving disciples of Jesus.\n\nWe ask this through Christ our Lord.\n\nAmen.\n\nSaturday, July 27\n\nGracious God,\n\nThank you for the gift of music. The melodies are a language all their own.\n\nWhen words are added we can sing your praises, or express our sorrow, embrace your forgiveness, or discover your faithfulness.\n\nThank you for the gift of song writers, musicians, singers and choir directors; through their God given gifts they share – each in their own way – your hope, joy, peace and presence with the world.\n\nAmen.\n\nFriday, July 26\n\nSaints Joachim and Anne – the Parents of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n\nLord Jesus,\n\nAs we celebrate the memorial of your earthly grandparents, we ask you to bestow your special blessing to all our grandparents. Through your blessing, may they continue to be strong, healthy in mind, body and spirit, and enjoy their advance aged with happiness and experience the love of their family.

May Saints Joachim and Anne continue to intercede for them so their faith continues to grow stronger each and everyday. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for our grandparents and for your blessings upon them.\n\nAmen.\n\nThursday, July 25\n\nLord, when you looked to the crowds of people following you, eager to listen to your words, you turned to your disciples and said, “The harvest is ready, but the laborers are scarce. Ask the harvest master to send laborers to gather his harvest.” You call each one of us, according to our abilities, to work in your harvest. Plant the seeds of good will, kindness, faith, and grace within each one of us. Throughout this day and every day, may we bring these gifts to harvest in our lives.\n\nAmen.\n\nWednesday, July 24\n\nLord Jesus,\n\nIt is hard sometimes for us to pray. And even when we pray, there are still things in our hearts and in our lives that we need to fix. Attitudes and words that could our brothers and sisters; pride and jealousy; gossiping and unforgiving heart. Teach us all the time to allow ourselves to pray to God the Father, to ask for His love and mercy, and to change our hearts into your likeness. Teach us how to pray, as you taught your first disciples. Make us humble of heart, forgiving and praying for one another that we too may experience your love, mercy and forgiveness all the days of our life.\n\nAmen.\n\nTuesday, July 23\n\nGive me the grace today, Lord, of the practice of penance, leading me to a sincerity of heart to gain the holy things that lead me to eternal life.

Make us instruments of your healing presence today.\n\nAmen.\n\nSaturday, July, 20\n\nLoving God,\n\nBe close to all of us this day; remind us that you are beside us as we experience the good and the bad, the challenges and triumphs that come our way. As you comfort and encourage us in our joys and sorrows, help us to comfort and encourage those around us who are also in need of support.\n\nAmen.\n\nFriday, July 19\n\nContinue to bless us with true humility, Lord God. For only through humility true blessedness flows. May our little kindness never swell our pride. Make us eager to do good to others without counting the cost.\n\nAmen.\n\nThursday, July 18\n\nGod our Creator,\n\nThank you for this season of bright sun, long days, and the opportunity to spend time outdoors alone or with family and friends. Fruits and vegetables are ripe and ready to eat. Thank you for the bounty of the land, and for the gift of each day. Help us to be mindful of the gifts the earth provides us in every season, and may we share with one another the gifts you have given us.\n\nAmen.\n\nWednesday, July 17\n\nHelp me, Lord, to be compassionate like Mary, and be aware of the needs of those I encounter today.

May our actions be like salts that flavor the life of the people we meet today. Make our words also be a light to guide and strengthen them.\n\nGrant all this through Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nSaturday, July 13\n\nPrayer to Care for God’s Creation\n\nGod of all creation,\n\nHow splendid and majestic is the world you created. It reveals your glory; it teaches us about you.\n\nWhen you made us in your image, you gave us this command: care for the world and for all the creatures in it, for this is our common home.\n\nYet your holy creation cries out, for our home is “burdened and laid waste,” scorched and scarred. Come among us that we might remember our interdependence.\n\nLet us see the face of your Son in those who suffer from the destruction of our common home. Help us to be stewards who honor you in the world you have made for the good of all creation and for future generations.\n\nAmen.\n\nFriday, July 12\n\nGracious God,\n\nMay joy and peace fill our hearts. May we continue to grow closer to you every day of our life. We pray today that as we have received much love from you, may we, too, love more. May we care and respect all people. May we become the models of your love and grace. May the world become a better place for us to live through our way of life, through the love that we show to all people.\n\nAmen.\n\nThursday, July 11\n\nLord, life can be overwhelming at times: so many demands are made on our time, so many people or tasks vying for our attention. For this moment right now, help me to be still; help me to breathe more deeply; help me to listen to what you are saying to my heart. For just this moment, let me savor the silence and peacefulness you give me.\n\nAmen.\n\nWednesday, July 10\n\nAlmighty God,\n\nThank you for the beauty of nature that surrounds me. Help me pause to appreciate the gift of your creation this day: for the stately trees that dance in the light breeze, the squirrels that scramble across my path, the dogs that stop to inspect wherever their noses lead them, the crows that do not flit away as I walk by. As I reflect on these simple joys, help each one of us to do our part to protect your gift of this irreplaceable environment in which we live.\n\nAmen.\n\nTuesday, July 9\n\nSt. Joseph Prayer\n\nO Blessed Saint Joseph, who felt the worry and sorrow of a parent along with Blessed Mary, your spouse and the Mother of Jesus, when the child Jesus was lost in the Temple in Jerusalem: protect our dear children now and always.\n\nMay you, O Blessed Joseph, foster father of Jesus, be their special foster father with God and Mary in heaven. Let our children, like Jesus, grow healthily in age, wisdom, and grace before God and all creation.\n\nAmen.\n\nMonday, July 8\n\nHeavenly Father,\n\nPlant your peace in my heart. May your eternal peace enfold me like a blanket and infiltrate my thoughts, my words, and my actions.\n\nHelp me to be a person of peace; a person of hope; a person of mercy and forgiveness.\n\nAmen.\n\nSunday, July 7\n\nRose Prayer\n\nLittle Therese of the Child Jesus, please pick for me a rose from the heavenly gardens and send it to me as a message of love. O Little Flower of Jesus, ask God to grant the favors I now place with confidence in your hands. St. Therese, help me to always believe as you did in God’s great love for me, so that I might imitate your ‘Little Way’ each day.\n\nAmen\n\nSaturday, July 6\n\nGracious God,\n\nYour beloved Son showed his love for the sick by touching, healing, and forgiving them. Your servant St. Peregrine received your healing touch after he placed his life unreservedly in your hands. As we come to you seeking help for those who are sick, particularly those suffering from cancer and other life-threatening illnesses, we humbly ask that you hear the prayers we offer you in honor of St. Peregrine.\n\nAmen.\n\nFriday, July 5\n\nGlory to you, Lord God. We lift up our voices of praise and thank to you for this new day. Bless all our undertakings today. Sustain us in our convictions and desire to be responsible and accountable to each other as brothers and sisters. May we always seek what is good, right and holy in your sight. Grant all this through Christ, our brother and Lord.\n\nAmen.\n\nThursday, July 4\n\nA Prayer for Our Nation\n\nLord, our nation is blessed by your providence. Bless those who govern and all its citizens.\n\nGrant us the wisdom to work for the common good, that all living in this land may experience the joy of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nMay we thirst so deeply for peace that we passionately and diligently work for equal justice for all.\n\nGive us the resolve to uphold the dignity of all that we see each other as friends and neighbors, teachers and mentors, forever learning that we are more similar than different.\n\nFather, bless our land.\n\nAmen.\n\nWednesday, July 3\n\nBlessed are you, O God, creator of the universe, who has made all things good\n\nand given the earth for us to cultivate. Grant that we may always use created things gratefully and share your gift with those in need, out of love of Christ of Lord, who lives and reigns with you for ever and ever.\n\nAmen.\n\nTuesday, July 2\n\nGive me the grace, Lord, to be a faithful messenger of Your message. May I be a faithful disciple in whatever I say and whatever I do. Help me to be authentic in my teaching and preaching of your message.\n\nAmen.\n\nMonday, July 1\n\nLoving Father,\n\nWe thank you for this wonderful day. Please grant us the grace we need so that we may be able to do your holy will today. Grant us an open heart and a humble spirit. Keep us in your loving care and sustain us in all we do.\n\nAmen.\n\nSunday, June 30\n\nLord Jesus,\n\nAs I walk the path of life today, let my eyes be your eyes, sharing compassion, warmth and love. Let my hands be your hands, bringing healing with their touch. Let my ears be your ears, listening where there is need. Let my words be your words, bringing comfort joy and peace!\n\nAmen.\n\nSaturday, June 29\n\nLoving Father,\n\nBless those who will visit The Grotto today. Listen to the prayers of those who seek peace and strength. Restore their strength as they spend time at The Grotto, a place of prayer and peace. May the Sorrowful Mother console those who are in sorrow and lead them to Jesus. Please grant our prayers, in Jesus’ Name.\n\nAmen.\n\nFriday, June 28\n\nGracious God,\n\nYou have called my name and daily I try to follow. I listen to your words in Scripture. I seek you in the hustle and bustle of my day. You call me to come to you – to bring my worries, my regrets, my hopes and cares. I am tired, Lord.\n\nYou call me to come and sit with you a while – in a church, under a tree, or on a bench outdoors. Here I sit, Lord – tired, worried, burdened.\n\nI take a deep breath and exhale …\n\nSitting here, surrounded by the quiet, I can really listen. I can reflect and contemplate. With each breath I take in, and each beat of my heart, I feel invigorated, inspired, renewed.\n\nThank you for the ways that you create in me. Thank you for the gift of salvation through your Son, Jesus. And thank you for the inspiration that your Holy Spirit brings.\n\nAmen.\n\nThursday, June 27\n\nGracious God,\n\nThank you for another beautiful day. No matter what the day brings, we know that you are with us to guide and protect us. We pray for our families, friends, and co-workers, that they, too, may be reminded of the glory of this day. And we ask your blessing on those less fortunate than us. Keep them safe and give them hope for a better day.\n\nAmen.\n\nWednesday, June 26\n\nLord, life brings unexpected changes – some wonderful, some challenging. Whatever comes my way this day, help me to remember that I do not have to face it alone, for you are with me. Help me to not fear the changes; help me find the good; help me to see the changes as an opportunity to learn, to grow, to become a better person.\n\nAmen.\n\nTuesday, June 25\n\nOh, Lord God, give me the grace today to not pass by someone who needs my help. Sometimes I can get so tied up with tunnel vision in my life that I block out the needs of others around me. With your grace, I can examine my attitude about how I treat people who may be less fortunate than myself. I may not be able to care for everyone’s needs, but I ask you to help me see people through Jesus’ eyes.\n\nAmen.\n\nMonday, June 24\n\nLord, we thank you for this new week.

I ask this through Jesus, your Son.\n\nAmen.\n\nFriday, June 21\n\nGod, we ask for your blessing and protection as we travel this summer to visit family and friends across the nation and across the oceans.

Give them confidence and skill to bring us safely to our destinations.

Bring these pilgrims safely to us and guard them during their return home.\n\nAmen.\n\nThursday, June 20\n\nThe Prayer of St. Francis\n\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.\n\nO Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be loved, as to love;\n\nfor it is in giving that we receive, it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\n\nand it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.\n\nAmen.\n\nWednesday, June 19\n\nGod, our loving Father,we thank you for this beautiful day.

I ask this today through your Holy Spirt, Amen.\n\nSunday, June 16\n\nA Morning Prayer to Our Lady of Czestochowa\n\nHoly Mother of Czestochowa, Thou art full of grace, goodness and mercy.\n\nAs my morning offering, I dedicate to you my thoughts, words and actions, my soul and body.

Thus, I will be happy in this world, and in life to come.\n\nThis prayer I make, through Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, One God, forever and ever.
