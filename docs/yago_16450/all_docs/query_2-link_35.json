        "text": "The Naval Surface Warfare Center in Port Hueneme California has conducted environmental tests on The Masters Touch M1 corrosion inhibitor. The laboratory tests have shown the product performs very well in inhibiting corrosion on steel and aluminum plates/substrates. The Passive Counter Measures System (PCMS) is currently investigating if this product can be used to simplify and reduce the cost of repairs to primed or painted surfaces on Naval ships. Laboratory test conducted in the Q-fog accelerated weathering chamber showed steel panels coated with the M1 and scored with an X did not allow the corrosion to spread past where the coating was intentionally damaged. The test exposed the panel to 1000 hours of salt spray and elevated temperature which is equivalent to approximately 3 years of outdoor exposure.\n\nWe simply degreased and cleaned everything to be coated and sprayed three coats of M1 on everything. To date no corrosion or deterioration of the M1 is apparent. It is less expensive and easier to apply than epoxy paint and it would appear more corrosion resistant on top of it. We plan on using M1 on everything from here forward when we build our transmissions. Thanks for the suggestion and help in solving what has been one of our most plaguing problems.Transmission was coated with M1 on September 2009 and running test for 500 hours Military operation.\n\nWe are extremely impressed with the M-1 product as I have referred it to a large oil firm with platforms out in the Pacific Ocean. They are still in the testing process, but so far the product has exceeded expectations. Pro Coatings-USA has and will refer The Master’s Touch, M-1 to many other companies along with other products that have industrial and consumer value as well.\n\nCleaned easier and faster saving time. This is important as they are breaking down an entire rig and moving it to another location, so every minute gained is money saved. (One comment was I wonder how much faster the cleanup process would be if everything here was painted with this productother jobs."
