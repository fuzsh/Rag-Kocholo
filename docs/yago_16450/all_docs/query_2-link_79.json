        "text": "4/7/2019\n\nI have a 1999 F350 4 door truck. It's a huge truck that was used for hauling horses, hay, boats, dump runs, and camping. My dogs came with my everywhere and you could tell. It smelled like nervous dog and the German shorthair shedded everywhere. My truck was cared for but never detailed. The upholstery was only ever cleaned once before. Matt cleaned every nook and cranny of that bad boy. You cannot tell it ever had a dog in it after they were finished. The truck looks practically brand new! The upholstery looks gorgeous, the carpet came back to life and you can see yourself in the shiny, white paint! And they are just super nice guys too!!\n\nThank you, Matt and Lamar, for your meticulous attention to detail.\n\nI highly recommend this company for any detailing you want. You will get your money's worth.\n\n6/14/2019\n\nGota give Matt and his crew some major props, as they do great work! They recently detailed our 2005 SUV, which was waaaaaaaay overdue for a good cleaning! They spent over eight hours working on it making sure they cleaned every little nook and cranny to include getting miles/years of pine needles out from inside the wheel wells! They also did a great job removing all of our Labs yellow fur. They took a vehicle that looked like it had been road hard and hung up wet, to something that looked like it belonged on a showroom floor! If you need your car, truck, SUV, boat, etc. detailed, call Matt. OBTW, I also had Matt put a clear coat on my 19 Tacoma... it looks awesome, too! This is the second vehicle Matt had done for us and it will not be the last!\n\n9/19/2020\n\nImmaculate service at a great price. Hello! Where do you find that anymore?! The hubby took the brand new Tundra off-roading & scratched up both sides. Matt came out. Better than like nothing happened, it looked better than the day we bought it at the dealership! Honest, fair and full effort. Hire Matt, you won't be sorry."
