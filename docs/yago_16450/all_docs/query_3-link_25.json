        "text": "“In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.” (Hebrews 1:10)\n\nI love noticing the beauty and design of God’s creation. For years, I would not have considered myself to be a “nature” person at all. This only started changing around the summer of 2010 when I was suddenly awakened to the amazing natural beauty of flowers while taking a stroll through a park in London. Gradually, over the years, my appreciation of the natural world grew, and I have come to deeply appreciate the amazing shapes, patterns, colours, and design on display, and how these reveal so much about the character of God. I love that what God has made is not only so wonderfully and precisely functional, but flooded with aesthetic beauty, unimaginable variety, and so much wacky fun and joy as well. To me, this points to a Creator God of limitless imagination, One who loves seeing His purposes accomplished in myriads of different ways, and who wants us, created in His image, to similarly use our God-given minds and imaginations in creative ways to accomplish His purposes, bringing glory to Him and joy to others. The exquisite detail found in both the largest and the tiniest of His creations reminds me that if our God has designed the natural world with such care and precison, then He can surely be trusted with the details of our lives.\n\nThis is the landing page for a series of nature-themed pages within this blog. As I document here just a small selection of what I’m noticing, I pray that God will grant us all the eyes to see His divine fingerprints everywhere we look on this earth, and to praise Him for His creation that so beautifully declares His glory.\n\nStraight to photograph galleries and my nature blog at the bottom of this page … or keep reading.\n\nI was born in a city and have always lived in a city, and for a large part of my life, I would not have considered myself to be someone who was particularly interested in “nature”. But as the years have gone by, I’m increasingly finding myself seeking out gardens, woodlands, forest trails, coastal walks, and the like whenever I can. There’s nothing quite like peering up at the canopy of a majestic forest, or standing next to a waterfall that’s plummeting down a cliff face, or strolling in the midst of thousands of roses of every colour imaginable, or looking out at the breathtaking swathes of colour brushed across a sunset sky, or indeed just standing at my window at home watching the birds in the trees outside, to remind me that the most most awe-inspiring and well-designed things on this earth aren’t man-made at all.\n\nWhen we look around us at what God has created, we see not only wonderful precision and functionality, but also breathtaking beauty, amazing variety, and sometimes mind-bogglingly wonderful fun and joy as well. I absolutely love that this is the power and the heart of our God. To me, creation in all its extravagant glory is a stunning display of the limitless capacity, creativity, mercy, and blessings of our great and glorious Creator God. And all of creation, as described in Psalm 148, sings praise to the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth and everything in them.\n\nNumerous passages in the Bible point out that evidence for the existence of God is displayed all around us. For example, in the Old Testament, the Psalmist says:\n\n“The heavens declare the glory of God;\n\nthe skies proclaim the work of his hands.\n\nDay after day they pour forth speech;\n\nnight after night they display knowledge.\n\nThere is no speech or language\n\nwhere their voice is not heard.\n\nTheir voice goes out into all the earth,\n\ntheir words to the ends of the world.” (Psalm 19:1-4)\n\nAnd in the New Testament, the apostle Paul writes to the Romans, saying:\n\n“Since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made” (Romans 1:20)..\n\nIndeed, we need only to look at nature which is all around us – the perfectly formed shape of a flower, the breathtaking beauty of the morning and evening sky, the night stars twinkling at us from an unimaginable distance away, the steady rhythm of waves breaking on a beach, and (I would add) the wonderful functionality of the human body – to see that it’s not so hard to believe in the existence of a divine and almighty Creator.\n\nThis is what the Bible means when it says that creation “proclaims the work of [God’s] hands” or that God’s “eternal power and divine nature” can be understood from what has been made. It means that if we stop and take an honest look around us, it would be very hard to imagine that any of this could have come about apart from a Creator who intentionally and intelligently designed it all.\n\nI like the way that Mark Cahill put it in his book One Heartbeat Away (BDP Publishing, 2007):\n\nEvery time we look at something built by man – a house, for example – we know it had a builder, someone who assembled it. When we see something that has design, like a watch, we know it had a designer who planned it. When we see artwork, like a painting, we know there is an artist who painted it. When we observe order – say twenty Coke cups lined up in a row – we know there was an “orderer” who set them up that way. When we look around the universe at things not made by man, what do we see? We see creation, design, art, and order. So if everything man-made has a creator, designer, artist, or orderer behind it, why would we not think that there is a Creator, Designer, Artist, and Orderer behind the universe?” (p. 15-16)\n\nCahill continues a few pages later:\n\nI was talking with a man one day in downtown Atlanta and I asked him a question about spiritual matters. He replied that he was an atheist and that there was no way to prove there is a God.\n\nWe were standing among tall buildings so I pointed to one of the skyscrapers and said, “Prove to me that there was a builder for that building.” He answered, “That’s easy. The building itself is proof that there is a builder.”\n\nHe was 100 percent correct. We know that you don’t just gather some concrete, pipes, windows, paint, wires, etc., then turn around and look back to suddenly find a building. A building requires a builder.\n\nI said, “Exactly. The building is proof that there is a builder.” I then added, “The sun, the moon, the stars, the oceans, the sand, each unique snowflake, the three billion pieces of your DNA that are different from mine, are absolute proof that there had to be a Creator of this universe.” …\n\nJust because you can’t see, touch, taste, smell, or hear the builder of a skyscraper doesn’t mean that such a person doesn’t exist. You don’t need any amazing faith to believe there was a builder of a building you can see; you just need to look at the evidence and make an informed decision. And the best piece of evidence you could have is the work that builder left behind.\n\nThe same holds true for the God of this universe. The evidence left for us to look at is all the evidence we will ever need in order to know that our universe has a Creator.” (p. 18)\n\n[The introduction and chapter 1 of Mark Cahill’s book can be found here: http://audio.markcahill.org/Heartbeat.pdf]\n\nThe Bible makes clear that every single creature that inhabits the land, soars through the skies, or swims in the seas is created by God. Genesis, the first book in the Bible, tells us:\n\n“And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.” So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” … And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.” (Genesis 1:20-22,24-25)\n\nAs with everything else that God created, the animal kingdom points magnificently to God as a Master Artist. There are, for instance, at least 10,000 species of birds in the world, each with their own size, colours, patterning, habits, and bird calls. There are more than 30,000 species of fish, ranging from less than a centimetre in length to as much as 18 metres. There are slow animals like sloths and tortoises that move at around 0.3 km per hour, and fast animals like cheetahs that can reach speeds of 120 km per hour. If we just stop and consider the mindblowing array of living creatures there are on this planet, each with their own natural beauty and distinctive characteristics, and if we remember too that the Bible tells us that each one is cared for and provided for by God Himself (e.g. Job 38:39-41, Psalm 50:11, Psalm 147:9), we might perhaps just begin to catch a tiny glimpse of how infinitely awesome our Creator God is.\n\nIf we turn now to consider the internal workings of the human body, we see also compelling evidence for a Creator. Noel Gibson, for example, has pointed out that our bodies are a masterpiece:\n\n“When you hear, 24,000 strings vibrate. A grand piano has 240, and is a mechanism 1 million times larger than the human ear. You live, because your heart pumps 40 million times per year, and uses 400 million berri-like structures in the lungs for collecting oxygen and discharging impurities.” (Noel Gibson, Twenty Minutes to Decide!, quoted by Ross Tooley (1993) in We Cannot But Tell, p. 64.)\n\nPaul Brand and Philip Yancey, in their intriguing book Fearfully and Wonderfully Made: A Surgeon Looks at the Human and Spiritual Body (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1980), also talk about the wonders of the human body. In the Preface to the book, we read:\n\n“I have come to realize that every patient of mine, every newborn baby, in every cell of its body, has a basic knowledge of how to survive and how to heal, that exceeds anything that I shall ever know. That knowledge is the gift of God, who has made our bodies more perfectly than we could ever have devised.” (Dr Paul Brand, quoted by Philip Yancey in the Preface to Fearfully and Wonderfully Made, p. 14.).\n\nPhillip Bishop, professor of exercise physiology at the University of Alabama, in a thought-provoking start to his short article, Evidence of God in Human Physiology, asks:\n\n“What are you doing right now? If your first answer was, “nothing” you are badly mistaken. Right now while you sit quietly, a myriad of wonderful events are taking place necessary for your survival. Right now your heart is beating. If you’re in average physical condition, it beats between 60 and 70 times per minute, 93,000 times per day, 655,000 times per week, 34 million times per year, and 2.4 billion beats in the average lifetime. What’s so amazing is that, most of the time, it fuels itself, paces itself, repairs itself, and alters itself in response to lifestyle changes, with no conscious effort on your part. In addition to your heart, your liver is detoxifying your blood, your brain is storing away information, cells are being formed and cells destroyed, energy is being used and produced, and many other tasks vital to life and function all carry on in a wonderful, harmonious way.” (For more on how the wonders of the human body point to a Creator God, have a look at Bishop’s whole article.)\n\nI don’t know about you, but I find it difficult to imagine how anyone could take a genuine, honest look at themselves and come to any conclusion other than that Someone designed us and intentionally created our bodies to work the way they do. How is it possible to imagine that our eyes, our ears, our hands, our brains, our hearts, and everything else about us are the result of an accident or a chance occurrence? More than that, when I look at the people in my life, their personalities and everything that makes each person who they are, there is just no way that anyone could convince me that we are not divinely and beautifully created. As the Psalmist says in Psalm 139: 14: “I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made”.\n\nScientists and the academic-minded have been trying for years to come up with evidence for whether there was an intelligent designer to this universe, and I am grateful for the scientific advances which have provided supporting evidence that the Christian faith is very much grounded in reason and rationality. I myself went through a stage when I needed to know that Christianity can be grounded in scientific rationality, and I read whatever I could find on the subject, so I rejoice when I hear of evidence from the field of Physics, for instance, that points to the fact that SOMEONE must have designed the universe. Physicists are realising that too many factors are “just right” for it to be a coincidence or an accident. As Professor Robin Collins says: “scientists have discovered that just about everything about the basic structure of the universe is balanced on a razor’s edge for life to exist” (quoted in Lee Strobel’s The Case for a Creator (Zondervan, 2004, p. 160)). John O’Keefe, an astronomer at NASA, says: “If the Universe had not been made with the most exacting precision we could never have come into existence. It is my view that these circumstances indicate the universe was created for man to live in” (quoted in Louie Giglio and Matt Redman’s Indescribable: Encountering the Glory of God in the Beauty of the Universe (David C Cook, 2011, p.156).\n\nHere are some examples as food for thought:\n\nATMOSPHERE OF THE EARTH: “[The earth] has just the right atmosphere — for if oxygen levels decreased by even a few percent, animals would not be able to breathe. A few percent more, and all plant life would be burned up” (Matt Redman, Indescribable, p. 159).\n\nGRAVITY: Our force of gravity is precisely perfect for us. If we stretched a ruler all the way across the universe and imagined that it was broken up into little one-inch divisions, and if we imagined that the current force of gravity that we have is set at a particular point on that ruler, just moving that setting one inch along that ruler would increase the force of gravity such that we would all be crushed. (Based on an example from Lee Strobel’s The Case for a Creator, p. 161-162.)\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE: “If the electromagnetic force in atoms were weakened by a mere 4 percent, then the sun would immediately explode” (from “What does it mean that God speaks through creation?” by The Navigators).\n\nTHE PROPERTIES OF WATER: “The ocean is the world’s thermostat … It takes a large loss of heat for water to pass from liquid to ice, and for water to become steam quite an intake of energy is required. Hence the ocean is a cushion against the heat of the sun and the freezing blast of the winter. Unless the temperatures of the earth’s surface were modulated by the ocean and kept within certain limits, life would either be cooked to death or frozen to death” (Bernard Ramm, The Christian View of Science and Scripture, Eerdmans, 1954, p. 148, quoted in Paul E. Little, Know Why You Believe, Victor, 2003, pp. 21-22).\n\nI love the way that Matt Redman sums it up in the book Indescribable. Noting that the scientist Hugh Ross has identified “more than two dozen parameters in the makeup of the universe that if altered by only narrow amounts would make it impossible for physical life of any kind to exist” (p. 159), Redman writes:\n\n“[C]osmologists ask us to imagine a universe-creating machine with many dials — each representing one of these parameters. Every dial has a great number of settings — and a tiny change on any one dial would make conditions for life impossible. Astonishingly, every single one seems to be turned to the precise setting for life to exist. Amazing grace, found right in the heart of physics.” (p. 159)\n\nWhile all this scientific evidence that points in the same direction as the Bible is immensely useful, and I am grateful that it has helped people (like me) to come to a point where they can believe that trusting in the God of the Bible is entirely rational, and not utterly irrational, I have over the years come to realise that God provided for everyone. Quite apart from making available scientific evidence that explains why the Bible’s account of God’s creation should be believed, He also put in place enough visible evidence for anyone to see and believe that He is the divine Creator.\n\nThe Bible tells us that “God’s invisible qualities … have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made” (Romans 1:20) and that creation “proclaims the work of his hands” (Psalm 19). This means that God has provided for us, plainly, before our eyes, evidence that we need in order to believe that He is the divine Creator of this universe. He has left enough evidence of His divine nature for us to see, if only we care to take a moment to look at His creation, and if only we would take that next step of faith to believe in what it points to. As the Bible says in Hebrews 11:3, “By faith, we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command”.\n\nAnd so I pray that all of us will stop, take a good look around us, and reach the conclusion that creation really does declare the glory of God our Creator.\n\n.\n\n“You may find it hard to believe that God could make everything out of nothing, but the alternative is that nothing turned itself into everything. Which takes more faith to believe?” (Mark Cahill, One Heartbeat Away, BPD Publishing, 2007, p. 23)\n\nI share more photographs and reflections on nature and how creation declares the glory of God in these GALLERIES and my nature blog ALL NATURE SINGS:\n\nA prayer:\n\nHeavenly Father, I pray that You will tune our hearts and all our senses to the wonders of Your beautiful creation. May we not be so caught up with all the things we need to do each day that we fail to notice that Your glory truly is over all the earth (Psalm 57:11). Let faith arise as a result of our noticing and appreciation of what You have created, and lead us always to give to You the thanks and honour and worship that are due to You. We pray this in the name of Your Son, Jesus Christ, through whom all things have been made (John 1:3). Amen."
