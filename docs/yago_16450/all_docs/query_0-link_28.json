        "text": "After his release from a Hamburg prison, professional burglar Stephen agrees to mob boss MÃ¼llerâs proposal that he attempt to break into a highly fortified bank building with the help of circus artist Marco. Alas, during preparations for his final big coup, Stephen begins to harbour doubts about the reliability of his partner and his wifeâs faithfulness… One of the few Italian genre films set in Germany, THE MASTER TOUCH wins the viewer over with its technical precision, melancholy grandeur, nuanced characterisation and a spectacular car chase through Hamburgâs Reeperbahn, fish market and port.\n\nIn co-operation with Terza Visione â Festival of Italian Genre Film and in memory of recently departed cinema legends Kirk Douglas and Ennio Morricone.\n\nMichele Lupo, born in Corleone/Italy in 1932, died in Rome in 1989, entered the film business as an assistant editor and after a short time received offers as an assistant director. In this function he was involved in over a dozen films. From 1962, he began making his own films, at first mainly the then very popular sandal films, and from the mid-1960s increasingly also Italo-Western, crime films and comedies. Between 1978 and 1982, he made five films with Bud Spencer, after which he retired from the cinema.\n\nFilmography (selection): 1962 COLOSSUS OF THE ARENA, 1972 THE MASTER TOUCH, 1981 BUDDY GOES WEST"
