        "text": "At The Master’s Touch Jewelers, we love to work with you to create jewelry that, until now, only existed in your imagination, inspiration, and dreams.\n\nWhether it’s a ring, pendant, or other piece of fine jewelry, we can make something as unique as you are, right in front of your eyes!\n\nRepair your pieces. Restore them to former glory. Recycle the parts to make something new.\n\nGrandma’s old ring needs some tender loving care. But let’s say, even though you would like to wear it, it just looks a\n\nlittle to “out of style” for your taste.\n\nThis is where we remodel it, using the material and stones to create a new and modern design.\n\nAs a local family-owned custom design jewelry store, we specialize in Diamond bridal jewelry and unique gold and gemstone pieces. We can source or make just about anything you can dream up.\n\nIf you’d like to restore a piece or melt it down and make something new with the parts, we can help.\n\nIf you’re just looking for something new and don’t know exactly what, we’ve got a great selection of popular designs and unique semi-custom pieces.\n\nIn addition we are really very good at repair. Well loved jewelry often needs maintenance and repair. For almost 45 years, our “backroom” is a full workshop with equipment and Jewelers who are extremely skilled at their craft. Whether it’s fixing a broken chain, sizing a ring, replacing a missing stone or making a piece of jewelry from scratch we’ve got the experience to do it and do it right.\n\nWe take pride in running our business “the way things used to be”, with family values, top rated service and customer care coming before profits."
