        "text": "One year ago today… The anxiety levels were high and expected making a career change after 11.5 years at another company. The first 90 ways were filled with a rollercoaster of emotions: What did I do? Oh I can do this! Ah what in the world is an OLT or an ONT?! Wait internet comes from where?! Oh okay I can do this! Gordon Krell often told me keep drinking from the firehose and it’s all going to click and you’ll know more tomorrow than you do today. He helped me all the way and built my confidence through his years of experience and belief in me. I’m always learning but way more comfortable in my skin today. One year in and I love working for Calix. Culture, the people, our customers, and what we do provides professional satisfaction. Calix encourages our professional and personal development. You have to appreciate a company who makes that an effort. Thank you for finding me with this amazing opportunity, Nikki Vannelli. Our ISP/BSP customers are in such a unique position…follow the path of mobility and a race to unlimited (speed advertising) or build subscriber experiences and sustain your base without the race to unlimited (high speeds) for cheap. As we watch and experience the world of mobility as consumers, we see all of the add ons to enhance the subscriber experience and pull from competition. Today’s BSP/ISP get the opportunity to do that proactively now and build your business from the ground up without sacrifice while creating a “sticky” experience. Thank you for allowing me to tell the Calix story and have insights to your business journeys. I love the courage you’ve each had venturing into the unknown and facing these challenges head on. Year 2 loading….\n\nTo be the best version of myself. That's the goal for today. That was the goal yesterday. And that will be the goal again tomorrow. To be the best version of yourself, you have to transform yourself constantly. Until the day I am no longer breathing, that's my goal. Why.... Visiting a loved one who has passed - I realised that the graveyard houses the most talent and potential that was never realised. So my goal is to go to my grave, having unleashed and realised my full potential, or at least transformed myself enough to be close to the fullest of my potential. A rose plant has many parts to it. Its most prominent feature is its crown jewel, the rose itself. But before we see its bright colours, it starts its journey as a tiny bud. A perfectly formed and symmetrical rosebud must eventually destroy itself to blossom into that beautiful flower. A beautiful bright red rose that brings joy and happiness, but, more importantly, it blossoms to its fullest potential by contributing to the cycle of pollination, nature and life itself. To transform oneself is similar to the concept of competing with yourself or the past version of you and not everyone around you. Pushing myself to transform every day, I have learnt from my own experience that when I can elevate my performance and effectiveness in many ways, I am tapping into my Unique Being. There is that bigger-than-me aspect. However, regardless if you see it differently from how I have articulated it, the bottom line is that we, as humans, have this deep desire to elevate ourselves through transformation. Whether we compare it with someone else or with our past version, it ultimately then lifts the collective. Thank you, Ashkan Tashvir and co, for the deep dive into this discussion last night. So, will you bank your full potential at the graveyard or intentionally live it out today, tomorrow, next week, next month, next year and the years that follow?\n\n⛔️ Closing the BERNER Chapter: Unveiling Three Learnings As I prepare to embark on a new chapter after nearly three years with BERNER, it's time to share the invaluable lessons that have woven themselves into the fabric of my professional journey: 1️⃣ Embrace Change, Embrace Growth: Change is the only constant, and at BERNER, I've learned to dance with it. Whether adapting to industry shifts or embracing new methodologies, the ability to navigate change is the key to continuous growth. 2️⃣ Team Synergy Sparks Success: The symphony of collaboration at BERNER has taught me that success is a collective endeavor. It's not just about individual brilliance but the harmonious blend of diverse talents and perspectives that propels a team towards excellence. 3️⃣ Innovation Springs from Curiosity: Within the mundane routines, there's often hidden brilliance waiting to be illuminated. The habit of questioning, exploring, and seeking new solutions has become a compass guiding me through the dynamic landscape of the professional world. I'm filled with gratitude for the experiences and connections forged at BERNER. A heartfelt thank you to the smart-rebels who made this journey extraordinary - your brilliance and team spirit have been the guiding lights in my career path. 👏🏼\n\nGoodbye and Thank YOU: Today, I am closing one door to open another one: a new chapter in my life. 15 years ago, in 2008, I started redi-Group’s subsidiary in Greenville, SC. During all these years we managed a lot of interesting projects, some longer-term, some shorter-term projects. Supporting a variety of customers, OEMs and Tier suppliers, we experienced a lot of cultures, management styles, systems and processes. What all the projects had in common: You are only as good as your people are. My dream had always been to set up a company with the best people available, retaining them, developing them, ensuring long-term success. I believe I accomplished that. We have highly skilled, specialized people who master a variety of paradoxes with seemingly opposite but at the same time complementary traits and behaviors; people who are motivated, curious, flexible, tenacious, ready for the next adventure. Whether setting up a containment activity with highly skilled project managers, or managing and improving critical suppliers, we have mastered a lot of challenges. I have not only met wonderful redi-Group employees; I have also met a lot of people I interviewed, who turned into either valuable employees or customers. Some of the customers became friends. And, I finally found CHRISTOPH LEIPOLD, my successor. He is and will be a wonderful person to work with. Christoph will lead redi-Group LLC to further heights, to new adventures, to more success. Well, what would I take with me to a deserted island: People; people who can figure things out, people you can rely on, who are dedicated, motivated, curious, willing to go above and beyond, people you can also have fun with. My next chapter will be enjoying life but also focusing more on my passion, helping people maneuvering and navigating through a VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity) world, finding the right balance to be more fulfilled and successful in their work life which will certainly also impact their personal life. Thank you to all of you, colleagues and employees from the redi-Group family, customers, providers I worked with over the last 15 years! Yours, Grit\n\nHey everyone, I'm really excited to share a big update! I have always known that I want to run my own business helping people solve problems but honestly I was never sure what. About six months ago, a lot of free time 'became available' and I was able to start figuring things out, so I want to say a huge thank you to some people who’ve changed everything for me over the last 6 months. In my career I’ve done lots of different things, which I guess can look a little messy from the outside but I have always been passionately interested in people and why we do things. And whatever I was doing, Coaching, Operations, Communications, Recruitment or Change Management, the core of the role was a new approach to soak up on how to measure value, how we form relationships with things and how to change behaviours and habits. So, I’m fizzing to share that I’m building a small Design & Strategy agency that will help brands matter more: - Designing brands that weave the individuality of their brave leaders through research-backed strategies to create unique and relevant identities that speak fluently with their communities. - Delivering experiences that lace high-performance tools with character instantly recognised for devoted focus on what really matters to their audience and sharing their decisive values. I’ve got tonnes to work out still but I’m loving the ride, and contrary to what people tell you about going solo… I’m (so far) actually sleeping better than ever. I’d really appreciate any insight and feedback on what I’m up to, so please comment or send me a message. A really big thank you to the following legends who’ve helped me to build the confidence to take my first few steps: You Are Uncommon for looking at an empty portfolio and still giving me an opportunity to work with your brand. motus VFX for the opportunity to do some work in a brand new space where there aren't many case studies of success. brytr both for giving me a shot despite the limited work to my name and the validation you offered that I don’t look like I’m making this up as I go along. Mota for seeing value in what I’ve learnt in my indirect experiences and believing that I’d be able to apply what I not-so-long ago was studying. Sergei Golubev for reaching out to me at the most perfect moment and puttng the first wind in my sails. And finally, to my personal mascot / stress PA - photographed - who’s meant more to me than ever over the past 6 months. Cheering me up when things have got really tough, keeping me grounded. She has been paid handsomely in Crunchy Peanut Butter. I’ll share some more as I get stuff finished up. Thanks for the love & support so far!\n\nJust like today, it was a long weekend after national day weekend, 20 years ago that I walked into the office of YAMADA Consulting & Spire, as my first day of employment. What an amazing journey it has been so far. I have had the opportunity to work with the most amazing colleagues, clients and vendors. Special shoutout to Jeffrey BAHAR Leon Perera Saurabh Sharma John Yam who I feel that I have grown up with. Through the ups and downs, there have been so many heart-warming and heart-breaking moments, and looking back, my most profound lessons have all been about people. Here are 20 most important lessons that I learnt in the last 20 years: 1. Your reporting officer is the single largest contributing factor to the quality of your career. 2. 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people. Be the 20% 3. A person’s integrity is like their virginity. Once they lose it, they will never be the same again. 4. The thing about respect is that you have to give some to receive some. 5. The leader of the team defined the culture of the team. 6. Work can be hard, but there is no reason why you shouldn’t enjoy it. 7. Always be polite 8. Always be transparent 9. Always listen to feedback 10. Never pull a rank 11. Never lie to your team 12. Never ignore a complaint- no matter who it comes from 13. Never pretend to know everything 14. Never raise your voice 15. Never lower your standards 16. When working with your team- Delegate, empower, repeat! 17. Talk to everyone as if you can learn something from them 18. Clients want to work with the most reliable partners, not necessarily the most brilliant. Competence cannot make up for dishonesty or laziness 19. Don’t work with people you can’t trust-This goes for clients, vendors and employees 20. Focus on process and input metrics, the results will take care of themselves A big thank you to everyone who has been a part of my journey. You are the giants whose shoulders I stand on.\n\n6000!

In a world where it often is about how many followers or contacts you have, we should never forget the true value of \"real\" connections: It's all about quality, not quantity. Naturally, it might be necessary to kiss a lot of frogs on the way to dazzling opportunities and finding that prince. Behind many of these 6000, there's a face, a story, and a valuable contribution to my professional and personal growth. Among these contacts, there are at least 10 invaluable, hopefully lifelong connections. Probably 90% will never make an impact but on my life, but even if it's just 1%, that would be amazing. These 10 make the difference. Each contact has its value, but it's these special relationships that make the biggest difference. I'm excited about further growth and more valuable connections.
