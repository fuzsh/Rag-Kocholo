It serves as an invitation for introspection, urging readers to confront their personal obstacles. In honor of Ahab Just like the tide rolls on and off the shore, life pushes and pulls us, beckoning us deeper into ourselves. Somewhere underneath our fears and insecurities, past the conditioning of family, institutes, friends and culture, a message awaits us, wanting not only to be heard but responded to. Some are unable to recognize the voice reaching out to them. Others hear but do not answer. Oh, what limbo awaits those poor souls! The torment of a journey not begun, a destiny neglected. The weight of dust-covered dreams is a visible burden. Sunken shoulders, slouched spine, foggy eyes, all telltale signs. Please, beloved, don't be afraid of the storm approaching from the horizon. Worry not of the Leviathans lurking in the depths. Summon the Ahab in you and dive in to meet the monsters. You are only facing yourself. There is only your own fear to conquer. #Introspection #PersonalGrowth #awareness #Art #poetry #conditioning #compassion #fearandinsecurities\n\nDive into the core of our captivating book ILLUMINATIONS: ART EMBRACING AWARENESS with the poem \"Personal Mythologies\" by Jakub Strouhal. This enchanting literary piece explores the boundary between reality and imagination, where our essence and faculties intertwine. Immerse yourself in a unique perspective that encourages a fresh outlook.

Weâ€™ll meet in the wind Tell the sky to hold itself down Tell the trees to ascend The seas to keep cool The seasons to blend I reach for you when I reach for my pen Planting seeds in cement. It was all a dream in the end I guess thatâ€™s why we're falling asleep Filling the streets with confetti Our heads with legends of the Yeti Clean bedding for the upset My vision was real, the rest suspect. Stardust, wonder, and lust in bars blunted We chop it up like Paul Bunyan Lost in my own strange zone like Don Quixote So faded Flown straight over the cuckoo's nest The shoes do fit Make fools two step Refuse to slip My two loose lips picked a tulip loose Just to give you a gift once I do get through to you. Iâ€™m in the pocket like a gypsy whoâ€™ll pick your wallet You can see my patterns everywhere like Fibonacci Mephistopheles, in heaven offering angelic offspring a trip to hell and back for small fees. #ILLUMINATIONS #Art #Awareness #Literature #Imagination #Perspective #JakubStrouhal #Magazine #Explore #Creativity"
