        "text": "Wanting to celebrate the great Kirk Douglas' 100th Birthday over the weekend with viewing a film of his, I went with one that 1.) I had yet to see, and 2.) fit the vein of cinematic intake I've been traversing lately. My choice proved to be better than expected.\n\nAdmittedly, the film suffers from familiarity. Here's a heist film where the main protagonist promises the woman he loves that he'll hang up his profession after 'one last score'. There's also a young male protegee, learning the trade from the master, whose motivations are questionable. Well-known terrain to be sure, but luckily for the viewer, Director Michele Lupo has a few aces up his sleeve.\n\nOne obviously being Douglas, who plays…\n\nRIP Kirk Douglas\n\nKirk Douglas stars in this surprisingly entertaining Italian/German heist film, directed by Michele Lupo. Lupo made several Bud Spencer westerns, as well as other exploitation fare like Weekend Murders and the great Lee Van Cleef vehicle Escape from Death Row.\n\nDouglas gives it his all in his rare excursion into Eurotrash; he's not just cashing a check like some American Eurotrash regulars. Here he conspires with a trapeze artist named Marco (Giuliano Gemma, star of countless Italian films like Tenebre and A Pistol for Ringo) to pull off a complex, million dollar heist. Because who do you go to if you're looking for a trustworthy partner? Circus folk, of course.\n\nA significant portion of the movie is…\n\nKirk Douglas gets his West German crime on, as an aging burglar recently released from prison looking to make one last score before calling it a career. His long suffering girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan) objects, but when presented with a million dollar heist, Douglas starts putting a plan into action. All he needs is the assistance of a young acrobat (Giuliano Gemma)...\n\nWhat plays out is a Thomas Crown Affair by way of the Friends of Eddie Coyle. An inversion of the usual ensemble heist, less concerned with group dynamics, than a personal relationship outside the crime. Crime isn’t glamorous, and our protagonist is driven by desperation, even as he arrogantly believes that he is a mastermind twelve steps ahead of…\n\nThis is a real mixed bag. On one hand, parts of the heist were clever and genuinely suspenseful, and for a while the twist ending was really great (until it wasn't). In addition, Giuliano Gemma was born to play charming rogues, so all of his early scenes as Marco the oversized street kid are just dripping with charisma, and entirely wonderful. Also, HE'S IN THE CIRCUS! (I can't find any details about the making of the movie, so I'm just going to assume that, true to his stuntman roots, Gemma did all of his own trapeze stunts. I will be taking no questions on this.)\n\nOn the other hand, however, Anna, the only female character (played by the very beautiful…\n\nKirk Douglas stars in \"The Master Touch\" an Italian action flick set in Germany. Douglas is fresh out of prison and gets drawn into \"one last job\" by gangsters. This plot is tired for even the early 1970's but this is still an above average film of it's genre. Kirk Douglas career was obviously in a downturn from his past mega stardom but he doesn't let it show in his dedicated enjoyable performance. Nobody else in the cast is doing anything of interest so you got to give Douglas credit for not phoning it in.\n\nThis movie is rated PG so don't expect too much violence but the action sequences are outstanding. There's some great fist fights with dudes flying…\n\nThough the poster hilariously overpromises, THE MASTER TOUCH is a pretty nifty thriller. In many ways this film is pretty much one of the best examples of the kind of movies Italy was producing around this time.\n\nDouglas is a master thief who is looking for one last big score. When an opportunity to rob an insurance house whose safe is guarded with a nearly impenetrable security system, he sees a chance for a million bucks and a chance to outsmart the system.\n\nDouglas is solid but subdued, at least until the final moments. He carries the appropriate level of authority to hold the film together. He is paired with Gemma who brings a lot of humor an athletism to…"
