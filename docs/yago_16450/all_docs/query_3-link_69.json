        "text": "It is 2024, and we’ve all heard how AI can improve our email marketing efforts. But as we dive into generative AI tools like ChatGPT, it doesn’t take long to realize AI can yield lackluster results, inconsistent and off-brand content and campaigns that feel average.\n\nAs AI use in business grows, too many companies and solo entrepreneurs try to use it to replace jobs. They become obsessed with how it can create productivity. Yet, it’s important to recognize AI’s proper role — a technology that saves you time and grows the business by enhancing your work, not entirely replacing it.\n\nWith each new AI tool for email marketers, it is crucial the content and campaigns created with them maintain a personal touch and not diminish the brand experience.\n\nWhy making your email efforts impersonal is bad for business\n\nLet’s take a look at Chick-fil-A and McDonald’s. They are both fast food companies using AI technology during the food ordering process.\n\nMcDonald’s uses technology to reduce employee interaction. When you enter a McDonald’s, you’re greeted by a kiosk for placing your order, not an employee. In the drive-thru, the first question might be, “Did you use the app?”\n\nMcDonald’s encourages customers to interact less with their staff.\n\nIn contrast, Chick-fil-A equips employees with handheld devices and puts its people outside for face-to-face greetings. Customers can place their orders even without entering the restaurant. This approach enhances the customer experience with AI.\n\nAs you can see, one has used AI to make their process less personal, while the other created a much more enjoyable human-to-human experience. How does that translate to sales?\n\nChick-fil-A dominates over McDonald’s with average store sales of $9.3 million, compared to the Golden Arches’ $3.7 million. This is impressive, considering Chick-fil-A is only open six days a week compared to McDonald’s’s seven-day workweek.\n\nIn 2020, a report by experience management firm Walker predicted customer experience would overtake price and product as the key brand differentiator. The research seems to have come true. Just look at the example above.\n\nInstead of using AI solely in ways that benefit our companies, we need to use it to create a more enjoyable human experience through the content we create.\n\nHow to use AI in email marketing while ensuring a human experience\n\nGenerative AI\n\nWhen you think of AI in email marketing, you probably think of using it to write email content. Tools like ChatGPT have a lot of potential for this.\n\nFully written email campaigns.\n\nSubject line generation.\n\nRewriting drab prompts and templates.\n\nSummarizing bulk messages.\n\nSequence framing and outlines.\n\nBut the words in your emails reflect your brand’s identity. It’s important to use tools like ChatGPT to improve writing, not to do all of it for you.\n\nUse it to first brainstorm ideas, then outline and draft. After the draft, refine and edit without AI. At this stage, you have to focus on personalization and brand voice. When that draft is done you can run it through AI which can spot spelling and grammatical problems, format it and be ready for your email service provider.\n\nLet’s look at an example of a ChatGPT response. The prompt was to write a sales email for a new product in the pickleball industry.\n\nSubject Line: Discover the Game-Changer: Our New Pickleball Paddle!\n\nHi [Recipient’s Name],\n\nWe’re excited to introduce our latest innovation: the ProX Pickleball Paddle!

You be the judge!\n\nHi [Recipient’s Name],\n\nOkay! So we’ve been hinting for the last month or so and we’re finally ready to reveal our latest innovation: the ProX Pickleball Paddle!

But we must take what ChatGPT gives us and make it complete by editing.\n\nDig deeper: 3 ways email marketers should actually use AI\n\nAnalytical AI\n\nMarketers are under more pressure than ever — faster deadlines, stricter budgets and fewer resources. Fortunately, AI tools are helping engagement metrics and sales grow steadily.\n\nAnalytical AI tools within an email service provider can identify:\n\nYour most engaged customers.\n\nCustomers that need to be re-engaged.\n\nIdeal times to reach out to past customers and potential leads.\n\nThese are essential to growth in this modern, fast-paced/low budget era. Once identified, the AI sorts these customers and leads into email segments and can engage with personalized content.\n\nFor example, Black River Farm and Ranch uses AI segmentation to identify first-time campers and invite them on a personal tour of the campus.\n\nOn the customer service side, this ensures the customers get a personalized experience and feel great about their purchase right from the start. In return, this type of email helps with customer retention. After all, the best customer is a repeat customer.\n\nHow to humanize this email\n\nAfter AI has sorted these customers for you, ensure your content has some personalization.\n\nAdd the name of the session the camper is attending or the dates.\n\nConsider addressing the camper or camper’s guardians by name in the email.\n\nHere is another example from Business Insider. This email was sent to a paid subscriber who had canceled their subscription within the last seven days. They used AI to identify that customer and sent out a limited offer.\n\nHow to humanize this ‘last chance’ email\n\nThis is a great “buy-back” email. However, the brains behind this campaign could have gone just an extra inch (because who has the time or the budget to go the extra mile?) to ensure a sale by adding a bit of a personal touch to this email.\n\nEspecially for a large brand like this, a quick and simple personalization at the top of the email will go a long way in gaining more attention and bringing back customers.\n\nEven the least savvy consumer can tell this is a mass-produced email and possibly completely AI-generated.\n\nA quick personalization at the top of the email is suggested here.\n\n“FNAME! Business Insider has a deal just for you but today is the last day to save!”\n\nAnother suggestion might be:\n\n“FNAME! We know you canceled but we’d like to offer you something one last time.”\n\nThe email could go even further and offer reasons they believe the customer canceled:\n\n“Purse strings tight right now but still need Business Insider to be on point with business and tech? We get it, FNAME. Here’s a last chance offer to save 80% until the end of the day.”\n\n4 tips for using AI in your email marketing campaigns\n\n1. Use AI to produce ideas, not full emails\n\nIt can be tempting to insert a prompt into ChatGPT or Gemini and copy and paste its answer into your email newsletters and campaigns. However, doing so will result in generic content that receives almost no positive feedback from potential and current customers.\n\nInstead, AI can be used to generate ideas, outlines and rough drafts. Always edit and customize AI-generated content according to your company’s brand voice, emphasizing a human-to-human connection.\n\n2. Ensure relevance and personalize\n\nHave I mentioned how impersonal and generic AI-generated content can be? When creating campaigns or outlines with AI, don’t be afraid to differentiate from what the AI source is giving you. Keep your brand in mind and personalize it with names, images and other data about the reader.\n\nAlso, ensure it is relevant to your reader. Take what you’ve learned from analytical AI and decide what kind of messages, sales and stories need to be sent to each segment of your list.\n\nEven if you’ve entered all the information into your AI tool, it’s always a good idea to double-check to ensure your campaigns are relevant to the reader and personalized for the best experience.\n\nDig deeper: 3 keys for email marketing in 2024: AI, change, learn\n\n3. Fact-check\n\nAI might not always be right, especially with content creation. Fact-check what it gives you to ensure the information you send is 100% accurate.\n\n4. Use it to enhance existing strategies\n\nAI has made a complicated marketing strategy like email much easier in the last year alone. It’s an amazing tool, but beware! AI-created content should enhance, not replace, what you are already doing.\n\nFor example, if you’re writing a new launch campaign for a new product, instead of asking ChatGPT to write each email, ask it for five new hooks that would appeal to your ideal buyer. Or ask it for the top-performing launch emails of the previous year.\n\nAI-assisted, human-refined: The future of email marketing\n\nUsing AI in your email marketing efforts will create more effective campaigns and save you much creative time. However, it’s important to not computer-generate humans out of the whole experience. Customers still crave a human experience, so be sure to use AI to enhance what you’re already doing within your email marketing efforts, not completely replace it."
