        "text": "2023\n\nACCESS EXCESS | Amy Boone-McCreesh\n\nDecember 5, 2023 - March 1, 2024 | HUB Gallery\n\nVisit Artist's Website\n\nThrough a pastiche of urban environments and grandiose architecture, Boone-McCreesh visually examines what ‘good’ taste looks like by pulling at the widely accepted cultural agreements about visual taste as it relates to class. The way these ideas intermingle with formal elements like color, composition, and decoration are also examined. Maximal faux luxury designs and repetitive visual motifs, all immerse viewers in a world that is inspired by spaces as intimate as the domestic and as powerful as baroque estates. She plays with design elements alongside the banality of daily life as a way to suss out who has access to beauty and how this concept has played out over history. As class disparities and social hierarchies in the United States grow more complex, Boone-McCreesh looks to the world around her as a constant informant of gatekeeping and how it relates to access to luxury spaces, goods, and even personal comfort.\n\nMagnificare | Marguerita Hagan\n\nSeptember 22, 2023 - February 22, 2024 | Exhibition Cases\n\nVisit Artist's Website\n\nMarguerita Hagan is a ceramic sculptor based in Philadelphia. Her exhibition “Magnificare” sheds light on a multiplex of senses and dimensions from the eye, mind, and heart to sustainable actions. Each series in the exhibition honors and celebrates mutually thriving communities and environments. Her play with scale makes physically visible the micro jewels of the ocean and her tributaries. In a cohesive and diverse body of ceramics, the works illuminate interdependence and engagement while magnifying our awareness, reciprocal responsibility, and protection of each other and our planet.\n\nInvisible Bodies | Curated by The Border Gallery and Emireth Herrera Valdés\n\nOctober 21, 2023 - February 18, 2024 | Art Alley\n\nVisit The Border Gallery\n\nVisit Emireth Herrera Valdés\n\nInvisible Bodies examines the intersection of migration and labor, illuminating the often-overlooked narratives of those whose bodies remain hidden in the shadows of society. Curated by The Border Gallery and Emireth Herrera Valdés, this exhibition explores the resilience, determination, and the hierarchical structures related to immigration and race in the United States.\n\nFeaturing fifteen artists with socially engaged projects, paintings, sculptures, installations, and performances, Invisible Bodies illuminates the labor's demanding nature, its inadequate compensation, and undervaluation, while delving into the gendered and racialized dimensions of migrant bodies as non-citizen workers, crucial to constructing today's society. The gallery's green walls symbolize our support for an open immigration system, allowing immigrants to contribute to the nation's labor force.\n\nFeatured Artists: Abang-guard (Maureen Catbagan + Jevijoe Vitug), Bianca Abdi-Boragi, Magdalena Dukiewicz, Brendan Fernandes, Billy Gerard Frank, Zac Hacmon, Julia Justo, Jodie Lyn-Kee-Chow, Jamie Martinez, Zahra Nazari, Michael Pribich, Lina Puerta, Coralina Rodriguez Meyer, Luis Alvaro Sahagun, Manon Wada\n\nIngress | Piper Shepard\n\nAugust 7, 2023 – October 22, 2023 | HUB Gallery\n\nVisit Artist Website\n\nPiper Shepard’s intricately cut textiles conjure lace, wallpaper, or remnants of pattern to connect with memories and human history. Her gossamer, wall-sized textile sculptures suggest sacred spaces, and, upon closer inspection, the beauty of their surfaces reveals a mesmerizing variety of intimate, laborious handwork of employed techniques. She considers cloth a malleable and movable substance, a rich domain that is both fragile and enduring.\n\nAnacostia Portraits | Elena Volkova\n\nJune 8, 2023 – October 13, 2023 | Art Alley\n\nVisit Artist's Website\n\nAnacostia Portraits is a participatory art project using a historic photographic process to create a visual archive celebrating the people who make up the Anacostia region of the District of Columbia. In this revival of the 19th-century tintype, individuals with a connection to the community were invited to portrait sessions with photographer Elena Volkova at the Anacostia Arts Center. Each sitting produced two portraits, one for the participant and one for a final installation.\n\nVolkova sees Anacostia Portraits as a way for people to shape their own representations, and to encourage a dialogue between past and present. The tintype, or wet plate collodion process makes exposures on metal plates coated with wet silver nitrate. Like a Polaroid, each exposure produces a single image. However, a single tintype takes about 15 minutes to create. Volkova uses the forced slowness to collaborate with participants, learning enough about each person to reveal their internal stories in a final portrait.\n\nAnacostia Portraits is supported by a Corcoran Women’s Committee and ARCH Development Corporation grant.\n\nEveryone Wants to Be a Perpetual Motion Machine | Patrick Bell\n\nMay 26, 2023 – September 15, 2023 | Exhibition Cases\n\nVisit Artist's Website\n\nAn exhibition of ceramic sculptures by Patrick Bell, Everyone Wants to Be a Perpetual Motion Machine creates self-probing entities which materialize his relationship to health and the anxieties surrounding it. Fear of intimacy, the stigma surrounding medication, and sporadic pain referenced by palpating hands, oversized pills, and inflamed tissue inform his work. Often in the absence of a body, unresolved trauma and tension become actualized scenes of disorder, while moments of intimacy or romance become confused and distant.\n\nPatrick Bell was born in Reisterstown, Maryland, and grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He received his BFA in Ceramics with a Minor in Printmaking from Edinboro University in 2016 and subsequently spent two years studying Ceramics at Wichita State University in Kansas. Patrick then moved to Baltimore to continue teaching and making where he is currently the Lormina Salter Fellow at Baltimore Clayworks.\n\nCenter for Arts & Crafts Artists and Instructors Exhibition | Penn State\n\nMay 18, 2023 – September 15, 2023 | Exhibition Cases\n\nThe Penn State Center for Arts & Crafts’ (CFAC) artists and instructors will showcase their artwork in the first-floor Display Cases. This exhibition will feature artworks representing the range of art classes available at the CFAC.\n\nThe Center for Arts & Crafts has offered non-credit adult art classes to Penn State students, faculty, and staff during each of the university semesters and a children’s summer art camp for more than 40 years. The Center for Arts & Crafts is located in 3 Ritenour and has a ceramics studio in B8 HUB.\n\nUnsolicited Advice | Laura Marsh\n\nApril 20, 2023 – July 16, 2023 | HUB Gallery\n\nVisit Artist's Website\n\nIs it safe to say at one point in your life that you have both given and received unsolicited advice? How did that make you feel? These are the questions that Laura Marsh asks as a textile artist of humanitarian messages and social practice. The solo exhibition, Unsolicited Advice, is a phrase taken from a small banner included in the exhibition. Through textile paintings, banners, spheres, and installations, Marsh discusses larger societal issues through the use of fabric. She invites participants to sit on the spheres and provides spaces to contemplate larger text statements and interact with textiles.\n\nLaura Marsh (b.1982 Montrose, Pennsylvania) received her MFA from Yale University School of Art and a BFA from the Cleveland Institute of Art. Marsh has exhibited nationally at venues including The Whitney Museum of American Art, Jane Lombard Gallery, Printed Matter, Field Projects, Newman Popiashvili Gallery, Tilton Gallery in NY, Dotfiftyone Gallery, Locust Projects, and Deering Estate in Miami. In addition, she has been an artist in residence at Oolite Arts (Miami Beach, US), Mana Contemporary (Miami, US), and Siena Art Institute (Siena, Italy). She is currently represented by Dotfiftyone Gallery, Miami.\n\nVisual Arts Annual Graduate Research Exhibition | Penn State\n\nMarch 18, 2023 – April 1, 2023 | HUB Gallery\n\nFeaturing the work of the current Master of Fine Arts candidates, the Annual Graduate Research Exhibition includes several artists working in a wide variety of mediums. Candidates are challenged to effectively demonstrate the significance of their ideas and creative research to the general public. Individuals whose works and presentations are judged best will receive monetary awards.\n\nThe Annual Graduate Research Exhibition celebrates research in all its aspects as an essential and exciting part of graduate education at Penn State. Established in 1986, the Graduate Exhibition places special emphasis on communicating research and creative endeavor to a general audience and offers an opportunity for professional development by challenging graduate students to present their work in clear, comprehensible terms to people outside their fields.\n\nSticky Mirror | Sarah Sutton\n\nFebruary 4, 2023 – May 30, 2023 | Art Alley\n\nVisit Artist's Website\n\nThese paintings imagine in-between spaces, scalar fluidity, and what the artist calls psychic spaces, where the private and public realm collapse. Short-term comforts and long-term consequences collide, and histories and interspecies boundaries dissolve and reappear unexpectedly.\n\nHumans are not foregrounded but instead one small part, enmeshed and entangled in the web-like spaces. The title of this exhibition comes from Timothy Morton’s book, Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World and sticky mirrors alludes to the viscous relationship between humans and objects, environmental degradation, and its ‘stickiness’ to our bodies, despite our evolutionary blind spots.\n\n2022\n\nHARD CANDY TECTONICS\n\nNovember 14, 2022 - May 4, 2023 | Exhibition Cases\n\nWorks by Gracelee Lawrence\n\nCurated by Jessica Rommelt\n\nArtist Website\n\nGlimmering and seductive surfaces blend into sensual volumes in space that together form the plastic sublime that is Gracelee Lawrence's sculpture. Her approach to objects spins somewhere off the map between a traditional sculptural legacy (in the company of reclining nudes and ornate garden fountains) and a 21st-century DIY manufacturing approach that let's one artist print off extruded plastic components that fit elegantly together. Still, with a fierce rebel sensibility, Lawrence serves the most exquisite Lego Tetris figuration you've ever seen. These sculptures usually feel like femme beings that are at once naked and armored up. Here you may find the works conjuring a rogue cyborg disco, cumquat army, digital cherry mountain with the reclining gargoyle, oil spill harvest cake on hard candy tectonics.\n\nDREAMS | AYDO (A young Yu & Nicholas Oh)\n\nNovember 11, 2022 - March 5, 2023 | HUB Gallery\n\nVisit A young Yu Website\n\nVisit Nicholas Oh Website\n\nThrough performance-based film and site-specific installation, AYDO re-imagine Korean folklore and precolonial spiritual practices to reflect personal and Asian American perspectives. They are not faithful to historical canon and transgress older traditions, regenerating them within diasporic contexts through methods of disruption and transformation.\n\nDreams explores ancestral and personal dreams through sculptural and video installations. Ancestral dreams refer to the experiences of the artists' ancestors, which they recall and meditate on through spiritual ritual-based practices that center on themes of generational trauma, family, and diaspora.\n\nPremiere | Andrew Castañeda\n\nJuly 25, 2022 – Jan 29, 2023 | Art Alley\n\nARC presents Premiere, the inaugural exhibition of Andrew Castañeda’s recent photo and painting works. Organizing his work to mirror the structure of a day in TV programming, individual pieces from various ongoing series are exhibited among each other, just the way episodes of disparate tv shows run back to back every day. The range of the work presented mirrors the spectrum of television programming from documentary to cartoon, commercial break to made-for-tv movie.\n\nAndrew Castañeda grew up surfing and skateboarding in sunny southern California. Castañeda has work in two private collections: The American Museum of Ceramic Arts at Pomona, CA and the Kansas City Art Institute Teaching Collection. Castañeda earned his BFA in ceramics from the Kansas City Art Institute, his MFA from Penn State University, and is currently Harvard’s Artist in Resistance 2020-2021.\n\nFuture Return\n\nMay 20, 2022 - November 6, 2022 | Exhibition Cases\n\nCurated by Jeremy Dennis\n\nAn exhibition in two parts, Future Return curated by Jeremy Dennis brings together beadwork, woodcarving, photography, and Shinnecock written books to share Indigenous stories. Artist and curator Jeremy Dennis creates cinematic images and places of belonging that center BIPOC artists. From Dennis' artist statement, \"nowhere have Indigenous people been more poorly misrepresented than in American movies.\" Future Return brings together mediums of art where the creation is to continue their ancestors' tradition of storytelling and showcase the sanctity of their land. As racial divisions and tensions reach a nationwide fever pitch, it's more critical to Dennis than ever to offer a complex and compelling representation of Indigenous people.\n\nBLACK NIIGHT WHIITE LIIGHT | Sean Capone\n\nSeptember 10, 2022 – November 6, 2022 | HUB Gallery\n\nVisit the artist's website.\n\nBLACK NIIGHT WHIITE LIIGHT showcases digital animation works from two of Capone’s ongoing series, Avatar Poetics and Global Illuminations. In these videos, the artist utilizes a conspicuous overabundance of motion graphics techniques and visual effects tools (including motion capture, 3D character animation and generative design software) to construct an absurdist and hallucinatory electronic landscape —a landscape illuminated by pseudo-neon glows and scrolling media feeds, and populated by logorrheic talking heads, A.I. phantasms and shapeshifting cyberpunk poets. These chimerical characters earnestly struggle to communicate while maintaining linguistic and bodily coherence within the artifice of their screen-based existence — a condition Capone refers to as “the body horror of the uncanny valley.\"\n\nWool-hoo!!!\n\nOctober 17, 2022 - November 6, 2022 | Exhibition Cases\n\nWool-hoo!!! was a project from Introduction to Sculpture (ART030), a course offered by the School of Visual Arts and taught by Assistant Teaching Professor Mengqi Xu. Wool felting is a craft that involves repeatedly stabbing a needle into a piece of wool or continually rubbing wool fibers together with mild soap and warm water to form a firm, felted object. Anything made of wool will have a soft, warm, and cute feeling. However, in this project, students are encouraged to build an object usually considered the opposite of cute.\n\nMental Health in Higher Education\n\nMay 20 – October 30 | Exhibition Cases, HUB-Robeson Center\n\nCurated by Dr. Alexandra Allen and Kayley McDonald\n\nWorks by Dr. Alexandra Allen, Dr. William Doan, and Melissa Lesher\n\nMental Health in Higher Education highlights the complexities of mental health and neurodivergence of faculty members at Penn State. Intertwined with the artworks are stories from current students of how COVID19 has impacted their academic life and wellness. Addressing both student and faculty experiences, the exhibition celebrates the ways in which student and faculty process through art and communication.\n\nGenerous Helpings | Nikki Lau\n\nMay 27, 2022 – October 30, 2022 | Exhibition Cases, HUB-Robeson Center\n\nAs the unofficial 6th love language a meal can be a joyous moment in someone’s day. For those who are food insecure the effects of insufficient meals or nutrients have physical and economic ripple effects. Students experiencing food insecurity also experience many intertwined social issues including financial insecurity, housing insecurity, work or family obligations, and student loan debt. Artist and alumna Nikki Lau and creator of Little Lau Shop, produces intentionally hand-made ceramics of anthropomorphic food and creatures that have big and small emotions. In 2021 Lau began to create sculptural platters of food to fundraise for various food pantries. In this exhibition these platters will be for sale; 20% of sales will go to the Lions Pantry providing food to PSU students at no cost.\n\nOver & Over Again\n\nJuly 22, 2022 - September 4, 2022 | HUB Gallery\n\nThe first documented iterations of 3D printing trace back to the early 1980s, but the first practice of building through placing line on top of line is found in ceramic’s coil building technique as early as 6000 BC. Through new digital technologies artists and manufacturers can model objects in software programs. Then by using g-code, conducting test prints, and adjusting calibration settings they print objects by depositing layer on top of layer until the form is complete.\n\nOver & Over Again brings together 3D printed works by Penn State Faculty José Pinto Duarte, Tom Lauerman, Shadi Nazarian, and Rebecca Strzelec and Center for Innovative Materials Processing through Direct Digital Deposition (CIMP-3D). The works on view highlight their commitment to working in innovative technologies, encountering new possibilities, and reimagining objects. Curated by Dani Spewak.\n\nHappy Valley Animation Festival\n\nMay 10, 2022 – July 17, 2022 | HUB Gallery\n\nAn exhibition of animation reels from the second annual Happy Valley Animation Festival (HVAF 2022), a juried, international animation competition that seeks to promote the art of animation and showcase works by students, early career and practicing professional artists, designers, and filmmakers in three primary categories: Animated Films, Experimental Animated Works, and Animated Motion Graphics & Design.\n\nHVAF is a collaboration between organizers, volunteers, and academic partners. 2022 events are hosted by the Digital Arts and Media Design (DART) Program in the School of Visual Arts at Penn State.\n\nFor more information: visit: www.happyvalleyanimationfestival.org\n\nDesign for Life\n\nNovember 10, 2021 – January 26, 2022 | Art Alley\n\nDesign for Life is an exhibition that highlights the expanse of innovative, socially responsive and community-engaged design work developed within the Stuckeman School. The Design for Life initiative was introduced by interim director Patricia Kucker as a testament to the creative practice, research and expertise of students, Staff, and Faculty. Twenty-two projects that focus on issues such as social justice, affordable housing, community engagement, health and well-being, sustainability, climate change and more will be featured in the exhibition. Works within the exhibition will also be available to view online once the show opens via Issuu.\n\nAltar | Kiana Honarmand\n\nJune 25, 2021 - January 26, 2022 | Exhibition Cases\n\nHonarmand’s installation on the exhibition cases utilizes text from the poem Gift by Iranian feminist poet Forough Farrokhzad to pay homage to the history of hiding critical commentary in Persian poetry and visual arts. Employing politically-charged writings such as news articles, propaganda, or feminist poetry, the writings are subsequently transformed into patterns using the smooth curves of Persian calligraphy. While Persian text can be associated with fear and terror in the current political climate of the Western world. Honarmand is interested in creating a sense of “home” and familiarity for these members of the Penn State Community.\n\nLost Bird Project and Why Biodiversity Matters\n\nJune 25, 2021 - January 26, 2022 | Exhibition Cases\n\nAs the presenting sponsor, Shaver’s Creek Environmental Center has brought the Lost Bird Project to central Pennsylvania. Shaver’s Creek has been a national leader in environmental education, outdoor recreation, and conservation since 1976 by connecting people to people, and people to the natural world. Why Biodiversity Matters includes avian research and educational materials from Shaver’s Creek Environmental Center and Penn State’s Wildlife and Fisheries program. The Lost Bird Project sculptures visit Central Pennsylvania, Fall 2021–Summer 2022. Conceived by artist Todd McGrain, the project recognizes the tragedy of modern extinction by immortalizing the five most recently extinct North American birds: the Carolina Parakeet, Heath Hen, Great Auk, Labrador Duck, and Passenger Pigeon. These statues serve not only as dramatic reminders of the biodiversity lost due to human activity, but of our duty to prevent further extinction.\n\nRosemarie Fiore\n\nJune 23, 2021 - January 26, 2022 | HUB Gallery\n\nRosemarie Fiore converts popular technology such as lawn mowers, cars, waffle irons, floor polishers, pinball machines, fireworks and amusement park rides into painting machines. Works on display in the HUB Gallery were made with pyrotechnic drawing tools produced by the artist to make marks with smoke.\n\nWobbles, spinning on and off, in and out of control are drawn with Fiore’s singular, artist-designed, spirographic tools. These tools engage the entire body, or many people's bodies, to move from a fixed point. Chance and chaos are tandem forces in Fiore’s work, building on the surrealistic technique of fumage as well as performance artists such as Carolee Schneeman, who worked with the limits of the body and drawing. Fiore responds to the physics of the tools she has created and their limits, since each tube or carton, once ignited, has a limited amount of pigment or painting \"time\" within it.\n\nTrue Likeness\n\nFebruary 4, 2022 – March 20, 2022 | HUB Gallery & Art Alley\n\nPortraits serve as expressions of identity, popular taste, social standing, and as documents of who, when, and where. Representing one’s self in the best light or seeing others in understandable terms are motives behind why we record images of each other, whether for rituals, documentation of events, art making, or as expressions of status.\n\nTrue Likeness presents an exhibition of contemporary portraits from diverse makers in a variety of media including video, photography, painting collage, installation, sculpture, printmaking, and drawing. Artists, some familiar, others more on the fringe of the art world, hail from all over the United States. Their own identities, and those presented through their works, provide a snapshot of who we are as a country. As the exhibition took shape over the last two years, as overt and coded hate spech became congruent with one of the most divisive elections of our time, it became apparent that highlighting and celebrating diversity was paramount.\n\nThis exhibition was curated by Lia Newman and Tom Stanley. Heartfelt thanks to all of our interns, as well as to Russ White, Graham McKinney, & Stephanie Cash. Special thanks to project contributor Russ White, Graham McKinney, Stephanie Cash, Kayley McDonald, Grace Southern, Dani Spewak, Sarah Kipp, and Kelly Kutz.\n\nVisual Arts Annual Graduate Research Exhibition | Penn State\n\nMarch 25, 2022 - April 17, 2022 | HUB Gallery\n\nEstablished in 1986, the Graduate Research Exhibition hosted by the Graduate School places special emphasis on communicating research and creative endeavor to a general audience and offers an opportunity for professional development by challenging students to present their work to new audiences.\n\nThe Visual Arts option is designed for students required to create studio work as a part of their graduate degree program and gives candidates the opportunity to demonstrate the significance of their ideas and creative research to jurors from outside of their field who score the works and award prizes.\n\nFull Transparency | Graphic Design Capstone\n\nApril 22, 2022 – May 7, 2022 | HUB Gallery\n\nFull Transparency is Penn State Graphic Design’s Senior Capstone Event. The exhibition will give visitor's a view into one’s individual approach to design. Revealing the process from developing a concept to final execution will bring visitors into designers headspace and give them a peek behind the curtain.\n\nFRESH, emerging artists with micro works and macro dreams\n\nNovember 17, 2021 – May 17, 2022 | Exhibition Cases, HUB-Robeson Center\n\nHighlighting self-discovery and identity through painting, quilt making, and sculpture in order to create an open space for personal narratives, FRESH features works by Harrison Boden, Emily Furr, and Sydney Lee.\n\nFRESH invites viewers to look for what makes someone unique as an individual, and to celebrate each person's journey. This exhibition consciously focuses on work by emerging artists who are seeking their own voices through boldness and color.\n\nCurated by Alix Gaytan and Megan Gottfried\n\nLunchbox Moments | Amie Bantz\n\nJanuary 26, 2022 – May 15, 2022 | Exhibition Cases\n\nLunchbox moments are the formative occurrences in many Asian Americans’ lives where a traditional Asian meal is eaten at school or at home and the meal elicits some sort of reaction, whether it be positive or negative. “I have a lunchbox moment; my mom has a lunchbox moment; nearly all of my AAPI community members have a lunchbox moment,” said artist Amie Bantz. These stories make up a collective identity that is equal parts profound, beautiful, comical, and heartbreaking.\n\nIn order to share these stories and empower the AAPI community in light of recent attacks on Asian Americans in the U.S., Amie Bantz presents: Lunchbox Moments: Seek Understanding. Share Stories. Stop Hate. These boxes are a collection of narratives from members of the AAPI community and are a visual representation of storytelling showcasing the Asian-American experience. These stories empower marginalized voices by providing a platform to raise awareness. This project is presented in partnership with Adult Learner Programs & Services, Residence Life, and the Sustainability Institute.\n\nInside the Frames\n\nNovember 17, 2021 – May 17, 2022 | Exhibition Cases, HUB-Robeson Center\n\nInside the Frames tackles the intricacies of body image and disordered eating. Art history students Emily Tse and Sidan Chen co-created the exhibition out of their Curator’s Workshop course (ART 477 taught by Lindsey Landfried, Curator and Senior Gallery Manager, HUB-Robeson Galleries) to address the anxieties surrounding these intricacies, and to promote body positivity and acceptance. Works on view by artists Mengzi Xu, Megan Gottfried, Harrison Boden, Ronan Shaw, Shaobo Liu, and Jo Megas.\n\nCenter for Arts & Crafts Artists and Instructors Exhibition | Penn State\n\nJanuary 29, 2022 – May 24, 2022 | Exhibition Cases\n\nThe Penn State Center for Arts & Crafts’ (CFAC) artists and instructors will showcase their artwork in the first-floor Display Cases. This exhibition will feature artworks representing the range of art classes available at the CFAC.\n\nThe Center for Arts & Crafts has offered non-credit adult art classes to Penn State students, faculty, and staff during each of the university semesters and a children’s summer art camp for more than 40 years. The Center for Arts & Crafts is located in 3 Ritenour and has a ceramics studio in B8 HUB.\n\nScatter Terrain\n\nMarch 25, 2021 - July 17, 2022 | Art Alley\n\nView Scatter Terrain’s catalogue online\n\nThe term “scatter terrain,” borrowed from role-playing and war games, refers to miniature fragments of architecture, natural features, or small props that provide a visual aid for players. This exhibition presents pockets of “terrain” – peculiar landscapes, architectural gestures, intimate domestic corners – as a metaphorical means of escape from the pandemic and connection to those who are far away. What started as a call for disparate glimpses into distant lives and locations is now shifting toward a realization that our communal sense of place is still marked by a reckoning with an ailing world and an urgent need for new perspectives. Scatter Terrain was co-curated by Anthony Cervino and Shannon Egan, features 25 artists, and first premiered at Ejecta Projects.\n\n2021\n\nWind Spirits\n\nAugust 21 - November 7 | Art Alley\n\nReception: October 26 | 5 - 7 p.m.\n\nExhibition Booklet (PDF)\n\nWind Spirits is an exhibition including three artists that consider the power and delicacy of Earth’s avian creatures and the larger implications that duality poses for the natural world. Following the renovation of Art Alley this summer, this exhibition will be on view from August 21 through November 7, 2021, in Art Alley and throughout the Exhibition Cases. Works by Tatiana Arocha, Deirdre Murphy, & Rachel Sydlowski will be featured.\n\nWind Spirits invites viewers to consider and enrich their ecological and ancestral knowledge and to foreground interconnectivity and interdependence rather than ownership. This exhibition was designed in partnership with Penn State’s Shaver’s Creek Environmental Center. Shaver’s Creek is currently hosting The Lost Bird Project, five memorials to extinct North American Bird species. More information is on view in the exhibition cases across from Student Activities in the HUB-Robeson Center.\n\nC/O Commonwealth\n\nBenjamin Andrew, Center for Performing Arts, Climate Art and Action, Marissa Alise Baez, Dennis Redmoon Darkeem, Christina Dietz, Adam Farcus, Kiana Honarmand, Corinne Jones, Kate McGraw, Ann Tarantino, and Tiara Zhané\n\nMay 24 – July 25 | Art Alley\n\nClosing Reception and Gallery Talk | Thursday, July 22 | 4:30 p.m. | Art Alley\n\nThis juried exhibition invited artists to make site-responsive and socially engaged works of local relevance and international significance charged by the HUB-Robeson Galleries Student Advisory Council. The resulting sculptures, wall drawings, murals, and installations are in care of the five pillars of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership. Exploring labor, care economies, and the collective power and colonial history integral to the term commonwealth, these works recognize the term’s connection to exploitation by looking at generational wealth, land, ownership, and the on-going impacts of these systems on the climate.\n\nThe arts are fundamental to our humanity, to our University, and to our world. They inspire us to find understanding and beauty and help us to express our values and diversity across ethnicity, religion, and race.\n\nFrom critical conversations to writing, image-making, and any number of creative actions; C/O Commonwealth holds space for artworks and artists to use creative methods for examining unequitable structures shaping our lived realities and posits ways that we might come together.\n\nThank you to the artists, jurors, and HUB-Robeson Galleries advisory council members for their contributions to this exhibition.\n\nPenn State Center for Arts and Crafts Annual Artist and Instructor Exhibition\n\nFebruary 5 – June 20 | HUB-Robeson Center\n\nThe Penn State Center for Arts and Crafts’ (CFAC) artists and instructors will showcase their artwork in the first-floor Display Cases. This exhibition will feature artworks representing the range of art classes available at the CFAC.\n\nThe Center for Arts and Crafts has offered non-credit adult art classes to Penn State students, faculty, and staff during each of the university semesters and a children’s summer art camp for more than 40 years. The Center for Arts & Crafts is located in 3 Ritenour and has a ceramics studio in B8 HUB.\n\nHuman Expectations II\n\nDolores Furatado, Kris Grey, William J. O’Brien, Eun-Ha Paek, & Lilly Zuckerman\n\nNovember 6, 2020 - June 20, 2021 | HUB-Robeson Center & Online\n\nWorking with touch and play, the artists exhibiting in Human Expectations II search for expression and experience through material. Forms emerge from the artists’ own bodies creating monuments to life and desire. Sharing what living feels like with eyes closed, improvisations and intimate experiences become powerful and suggestive objects. Like a boulder on top of a hill – these works fill the imagination with narrative possibility. Works on view by William J. O’Brien, Dolores Furtado, Kris Grey, Eun-Ha Paek and Lilly Zuckerman.\n\nHappy Valley Animation Festival\n\nMay 21 – June 13, 2021 | HUB Gallery & Online\n\nAn exhibition of animation reels from the inaugural Happy Valley Animation Festival (HVAF), an open, international competition. HVAF seeks to promote the art of animation and showcase works by students, early career and practicing professional artists, designers, and filmakers. Categories of works include animated films, animated motion graphics and design, and experimental animated works.\n\nThis Happy Valley Animation Festival is a collaboration between organizers, volunteers, local community sponsors, and academic partners. Happy Valley Animation Festival 2021 events were hosted by the Animation Club at Penn State and the Digital Arts and Media Design Program in the School of Visual Arts at Penn State.\n\nDr. Bill Doan | The Anxiety Project\n\nJanuary 16 – March 14 | HUB Gallery\n\nA pandemic, nationwide protests and uprisings, a presidential election, and cascading challenges facing individuals and communities across the globe, many of us have struggled with our mental health. Despite the prevalence and normalcy of these feelings and experiences, stigma continues to follow mental illness.\n\nFor Dr. Doan, drawing performing and sharing have helped him – and others – cope. These artistic outlets are therapeutic and help to alleviate symptoms, enabling him to imagine his mental health, rather than to be defined by his mental illness. The Anxiety Project invite others to draw for their mental health too. He is a Professor of Theatre in the College of Arts and Director of the Arts and Design Research Incubator at The Pennsylvania State University. Doan served as the Penn State Laureate for 2019-2020.\n\nJae Won Lee & Kelly Salchow MacArthur | CARE. not convenience.\n\nAugust 2020 - January 2021 | HUB Gallery & Online\n\nPlastic. It is convenient and pervasive, lifesaving, and the root of suffering. It is so ingrained in our lives it is hard to imagine a world without it. This imagining lies at the heart of the exhibition CARE. not convenience. Created entirely with salvaged plastic, this collaboration between an artist, designer, and an environmental sciences researcher aspired to shed light on society’s dependence and careless overuse, as well as, thoughtless disposal of plastic. The primary material used for work creation was found and collected plastic bags. The extensive exploration of this petroleum-based material has led to methods of fusing sheets of plastic with heat and making art forms with functional design capabilities (such as wearable art and hanging space dividers) and attention to minimizing waste in processes of production. Text written and selected by Lissy Goralnik. This exhibition was selected by a jury of Penn State faculty, staff, and students.\n\nCarlos Rosales-Silva | Border Exchange\n\nAugust 24 – February 15 | Wall Case\n\nAn installation in the HUB-Robeson Center Wall Case, Rosales-Silvas exhibition Border Exchange pairs two of the artist’s paintings with a site-responsive wall painting. Rosales-Silva’s work exists in the space between borders and between classification. A meditation on the ever-expanding histories of Brown peoples in the United States, his abstract works consider the vernacular cultures of the American Southwest, the western art historical canon, and the political and cultural connections and disparities between them. Spoken and written Eurocentric language, as a system of knowledge, has been historically weaponized against Brown communities. Rosales-Silva believes it is important to adapt to, invoke, and reimagine the weapons of colonization, utilizing art-making to reconnect with and create innovative methods of non-western communication untethered from written or spoken language.\n\nHuman Expectations\n\nNatalia Arbelaez, Micaela Amateau Amato, Soojin Choi, & Malcolm Mobutu Smith\n\nAugust 24, 2020 – January 31, 2021 | HUB-Robeson Center & Online\n\nHuman Expectations is an exhibition of four artists working throughout the U.S. in ceramic, neon, and glass. Each artist approaches the form of the human head as a map or apparition – expressing systems of knowing, disruption, and social difference. Weighty, incisive, and unflinching these works connect deeply to the worlds of emotions, feelings, and embodied knowledge. Working from their interests, stories, and origins these artists consider the limitations and possibilities of human expectations – their ignorance, perceptual limitations, and potentially their magic. On view throughout the exhibition cases in the HUB-Robeson Center.\n\nWhen the Bough Breaks\n\nOrganized By Susanne Slavick\n\nJanuary 16, 2021 – May 9, 2021 | Art Alley\n\nFacing ongoing human conflict and impending climate catastrophe, the reality or representation of trees can offer solace and space—forth necessity of talking and listening. The works of these artists and accompanying poets embrace the tree —materially and conceptually—through figure and metaphor, analysis and allegory, and as record and reflection. Works by: Patricia Bellan-Gillen, Denise Burge, Zoë Charlton, Ellen Harvey, Alex Lukas, Clayton Merrell, Sarah Slavick, and Susanne Slavick.\n\n2020\n\nJae Won Lee & Kelly Salchow MacArthur | CARE. not convenience.\n\nAugust 24 - November 20 | HUB Gallery & Online\n\nPlastic. It is convenient and pervasive, lifesaving and the root of suffering. It is so ingrained in our lives it is hard to imagine a world without it. This imagining lies at the heart of the exhibition CARE. not convenience. Created entirely with salvaged plastic, this collaboration between an artist, designer, and an environmental sciences researcher aspired to shed light on society’s dependence and careless overuse, as well as, thoughtless disposal of plastic. The primary material used for work creation was found and collected plastic bags. The extensive exploration of this petroleum-based material has led to methods of fusing sheets of plastic with heat, and making art forms with functional design capabilities (such as wearable art and hanging space dividers) and attention to minimizing waste in processes of production. Text written and selected by Lissy Goralnik. This exhibition was selected by a jury of Penn State faculty, staff, and students.\n\nOn October 22 we hosted a student-led virtual online reception. This reception was in a Zoom webinar format, and the recording is available for viewing. The artist's guided us through a 360 tour, Q&A, and reflection of plastic use.\n\nHostile Terrain 94 | Undocumented Migration Project\n\nAugust 24 - November 20 | Art Alley\n\nA global call to action hosted by the Undocumented Migration Project and HUB-Robeson Galleries, Hostile Terrain 94 is a participatory art exhibition occurring in nearly 150 cities around the globe. Aiming to bear witness to and memorialize the thousands of lives claimed by the U.S./Mexico Border since the 1990s, the exhibition invites collaborators, citizens, and community members alike to write the identifying information known about these migrants and map where their lives were lost. Hostile Terrain 94 raises awareness about the human consequences of policies such as “Prevention Through Deterrence.” The Undocumented Migration Project (UMP) is an arts-education-research collective aiming to humanize the migrant experience between Latin America and the United States. UMP projects are collaborative public endeavors meant to inspire and engage participants to work towards positive social change.\n\nIlluminating Illusions | Penn State Museum Consortium\n\nFebruary 2020 - August 2020 | Display Cases and Online\n\nIs it real or an illusion? A natural phenomenon or clever design? This collaborative exhibition presented by members of the Penn State Museum Consortium explores various facets of illusions in science, art, literature and nature. The exhibition showcases a selection of objects and illusion examples that illustrate relevance to current day culture, scientific discovery, or both. Illuminating Illusions is a collaboration of Penn State University Museum Consortium Members\n\nview online\n\nJim Drain | Ideas! Ideas! Ideas!\n\nFebruary 15 - August 11 | Wall Case\n\nThis installation uses dazzle camouflage patterns to simultaneously mask and amplify the wall case. The patterns connect and disconnect optically as viewers approach the case. Both inviting and obfuscating, peering through the pattern we find pairs of static hand gestures nestled in fur along with a lone figure. The figure, perhaps Edvard Munchs’ screamer, stares into an endless dumb, numb, void. This playful, maximalist installation puts form to subconscious experiences.\n\nWomen Photojournalists of Washington\n\n2019 Juried Exhibition: Women Photo Journalists of Washington (WPOW)\n\nMarch 9 - August 8 | Art Alley\n\nThis exhibition features standout photography and multimedia pieces by members of WPOW from the past year. The show comes to Penn State from the Hillyer Center for the Arts in Washington D.C. in collaboration with the Bellisario College of Communications. Works were selected by Rachael Strecher, Director of Storytelling Grants and Fellowships at the National Geographic Society; Jehan Jillani, Picture & Visuals Editor at the Guardian US; Melina Mara, National Political Staff Photojournalist at The Washington Post.\n\nStill Here\n\nStill Here\n\nJanuary 21 ­– May 10 | HUB Gallery and Online\n\nFilms by Larry Achiampong, Adama Delphine Fawundu, Third Horizon (Jason Fitzroy Jeffer), Carlos Javier Ortiz, Cinthia Marcelle, Melo-X, Helina Metaferia, and Joiri Minaya\n\nStill Here explores stories of migration, displacement, and survival in films by eight artists that represent a spectrum of the African Diaspora. The works in this exhibition use moving images as conduit to highlight the rituals and traditions that persevere and evolve, despite the oppressive historical ripple effects of colonialism and the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Through practices and tools of survival such as migrating, defending, dancing, gathering, praying, and claiming agency over one’s body, the works in this exhibition demonstrate that black and brown bodies are not here for consumption of the white gaze, nor are they passive beings upon whom actions are done or inflicted. Instead, the film’s subjects investigate and enact strategies to deeply connect with parts of their personal and collective narratives that have been overlooked or erased by dominant Eurocentric historical accounts.\n\nCurated by Larry Ossei-Mensah, Dexter Wimberly and Kiara Ventura, Still Here was originally organized at the Museum of the African Diaspora, San Francisco from May 8 through August 11, 2019.\n\nDannielle Tegeder | Cosmologies\n\nNovember 20 - March 3 | Art Alley\n\nA wall drawing in several acts, Tegeder’s work at Penn State expands on her ever-evolving exploration of the systems around us. The first act of the wall drawing, for the HUB-Robeson Center, will chart the marks and symbols reflected in her past 20 years of painting practice. Inspired by steamfitter's drawings, flight routes, and electrical networks, her works map points of connectivity visible and invisible while building imagined spaces or plans for futuristic environments. In its second act, the chart of marks transforms into an imagined new system, enveloping the Woskob Family Gallery inside the Penn State Downtown Theatre Center in its unique visual language.\n\nGhosts\n\nOctober 3 - February 2 | Display Cases\n\nGhosts is an exhibition of works selected from the Ceramics Area’s collection of bisqueware, known as the Bisque Library. Bisqueware is clay that has been kiln fired once and has no chemically bonded water remaining in it. Clay can be fired a second time at a higher temperature for a glaze, or glass surface, that is often referred to as “finished.”Ghosts are a colloquial way to reference ceramics made during demonstrations and workshops that were never intended to be finished. Instead, they were made as an instructional tool to show students and publics the “how to” side of the artist’s practice. This exhibition is an invitation to explore the variety of forms and numerous approaches to handling clay. Notably, none of the artists are identified- the origins of these works may only be known by the maker themselves, or in the memory of a workshop attendee. As a library for the Ceramics Area, the pots are typically kept in open, available spaces for learners to interact with.\n\n2019\n\nClaire Ashley | Strewn, Hither and Thither\n\nNovember 11 – January 18 | HUB Gallery\n\nExploding the possibilities of painting, Ashley’s inflatable sculptures look for a space for paint to live and breath as tattooed skins on hybrid bodies. In this exhibition, kinetic boulders float and lumber throughout the gallery, irreverent and humorous. The works are both absurdist performances and spaces for play, each entangled with curiosities as numerous as expandable foam, aliens, cake frosting, wrinkled skin, and exhalation.\n\nA Meditation on this Age of Struggle and Strife | Rudy Shepherd\n\nAugust 5 – November 10 | Art Alley\n\nShepherd’s content is picked from the endless stream of news we are all flooded with on a day to day basis, stories of special poignance that tend to speak to a larger trend in the culture. On display in the space are nearly 100 faces and events made present and notorious in the news cycle from 2017 to last week. A Meditation on this Age of Struggle and Strifeplaces images next to one another: criminals, victims of crime, politicians, heroes, artists and Shepherd’s friends and family. Portraits of people whose names become familiar to those following the United States, that accumulate through Shepherd’s dedicated painting practice into a monumental grid of people side by side. For instance, Megan Rapinoe, Bree Newsome, Antwon Rose, Kamasi Washington, John McCain, and Lil Peep hang together and share space in the gallery alongside a limousine burned by the Black Bloc during the presidential inauguration (2017). Part of an ongoing body of work Shepherd began investigating the poignant, sensational, and often despair filled stories of major American news outlets. Spurred from the actions of the media that perpetrate prejudice, he began to examine the “dark side of human nature, that part of all of us that cause us to mistreat and distrust one another.”\n\nOsaze Was a Freedom Fighter | Curated by Bruxas Bruxas\n\nNovember 5 - November 7 | HUB Gallery\n\nOsaze Was a Freedom Fighter is an exhibition of works by student artists and activists. These individuals are a part of Bruxas Bruxas, a student organization founded by both artists and Ph.D. candidates in Art Education, Women, Gender, and Sexuality studies, and African American studies. Bruxas Bruxas works to address race, gender, oppression, community, and allyship through its arts praxis. These student leaders are using the gallery to create space for expression and response to the tragic incident in which State College police ended the life of a 29-year-old black man, Osaze Osagie, in the spring of 2019. The exhibition will, for three days, serve as a space for members of the Penn State community to remember Osagie and to advance civil discourse surrounding police responses resulting in fatality for people with mental disabilities and people of color.\n\nWe Never Left: Artists of Southeast Indian Tribes\n\nSeptember 18 – November 3 |HUB Gallery\n\nWe Never Left: Artist of the Southeast Indian Tribes celebrates contemporary artists descended from American Indians who, against all odds, remained in the Southeast. They are members of tribes who continue to live in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. This exhibition was organized by the Museum of Arts and Science, Daytona Beach, Florida and curated by Walter L. Meyer, Independent Curator. This iteration at Penn State has been supported by the Department of History and The College of Arts and Architecture.\n\nTheir highly diverse artwork reflects engagement with tradition-inspired techniques, cutting-edge technology, and pop culture, and addresses a variety of issues—cultural preservation, language revitalization, personal identity and expression, American history, community pride, and threats to homeland and the natural environment.\n\nWorks on view by Joshua Adams, “Doc” & Spencer Battiest, Hollis Chitto, Rany Chitto, Jessica Clark, Faren Sanders Crews, Peggy Fontenot, Jerry Gibson, Shan Goshorn, Sherrell Hendrickson, Luzene Hill, Ashley Minner, Benny Mitch, Jessica Osceola, Jean-Luc Pierite, Caroleen Sanders, Sarah Sense, Monique Verdin, and Fred Wilnoty.\n\nHot Lava\n\nLing Chun, Iva Haas, Bryan Hopkins, and Andrea Marquis\n\nMay 15 – September 30 | Display Cases\n\nWhether molten rock or child’s play, the artists in Hot Lava utilize the material specificities and chemical changes of clay and glaze to probe phenomenological possibilities. An exhibition in five acts, each artist’s solo presentation delves deeply into their work over time or in series. Sizzling hot forms act as playgrounds for steaming glazes while perforations, deformations, and transections disobey structure. These artists’ fantastical alchemy of the elemental melts, drools, and burns.\n\nHannah Epstein | Nittany Lion: Eco-Mascot\n\nJuly 3 – September 12 | HUB-Gallery\n\nEpstein, also known as Hanski, describes herself as “a feminist folklorist of the internet age” who in past works has created hooked rugs that depicted Internet memes and monsters. For the HUB Gallery, Epstein’s textiles envision the University’s sports mascot as an environmental crusader and supportive friend to the earth who is having a 90’s tabloid style meltdown. In one hooked rug, the Nittany Lion reads The Drowned World, J.G. Ballard’s climate fiction sci-fi novel, in another Hot Mama Earth sweats and cries as she faces the climate crisis.\n\nAs a trained folklorist, Epstein advocates for a deeper understanding of storytelling as a shared, connective activity, where artists can begin to code alternate realities into the social consciousness. Themes of \"play\" connect her multi-disciplinary practice as her work aims to turn passive voyeurs into active players. By employing game design techniques, she encourages a form of active critique- one that probes the rules structures governing all social interactions.\n\nit’s the new everything\n\nBrian Alfred, Arden Bendler Browning, Trisha Holt, and Phaan Howng\n\nMay 28 – July 21 | Art Alley\n\nIn the 40 years since Art in America announced TV as the next medium, or Andy Warhol that “it’s the new everything,” artists continue to confirm the prognosis of inside and outside as defunct categories in life and in landscape. In this exhibition, artists approach digital apertures and viewfinders as tools and points of view.\n\nZoë Charlton | The Domestic\n\nCurated by Shannon Egan\n\nApril 29 – June 25 | HUB Gallery\n\nArtist Zoë Charlton creates large-scale collages, drawings, and sculptural installations that explore the complexities of contemporary social and cultural stereotypes. Recurring imagery in Charlton's work --suburban houses, African masks, paper dolls, and lush landscapes--provides a new approach to issues and representations of black identity. \"The Domestic\" examines notions of care-taking across racial and class lines, the fragility and failings of a home, and the complications of gender and sexuality in relation to this intensely bodily work. This exhibition travels to Penn State from Gettysburg College’s Schmucker Gallery.\n\nTimely Warnings\n\nExhibition led by Sophia Krupsha\n\nMay 6 – May 19 | Art Alley\n\nOn view are drawings, photographs, sculptures, and paintings by students and faculty at Penn State University Park.\n\nWorks by Tracin Bauman, Joy Blazofsky, Jessica Farra, Dani Fruehan, Kaitlyn Innersy, Kayleigh Quinnan, Sophia Krupsha, Kaitlyn Innerst, Elizabeth Sickles, Melisas Leaym-Fernandez, and Steven Rubin.\n\nKrupsha, a rising junior in the Painting and Drawing concentration of the Bachelor of Fine Arts Program, approached the HUB-Robeson Galleries with the exhibition idea after seeing how common artworks addressing sexual assault are in her community. She began to ask the artists about their motivation for creating pieces such as those exhibited in this show and came across a disturbingly common shared experience of abuse amongst her peers.\n\n“As a survivor of sexual assault myself, I felt it necessary to understand what happened to me as a call for activism and not something that I should hide or be ashamed of. Time after time I have witnessed my peers suffer the same abuse only to be doubted and shamed into silence while their abuser goes unpunished and their stories go unheard. By curating this show I wanted to give that voice back to those affected by this issue, and call to attention how frequent these crimes are.”\n\nArtists were invited to submit through an Open Call in response to Krupsha’s exhibition idea with the goal of creating an environment that not only allows artists to share their stories but also responds to the actions Penn State has taken specifically to address the prevalence of sexual assault across all of it’s campuses.\n\nBRIAN GINIEWSKI\n\nDecember 3– May 10 | Display Case\n\nBrian is a ceramic artist from Philadelphia, PA who produces earthenware vessels that use a colorful drip glazing process to make his “drip pots”. Brian was a visiting Assistant professor of Ceramics at Penn State. Purchases from his case can be made during gallery hours, please visit the gallery offices in room 241 HUB-Robeson for more information.\n\nConstrained Surface | Ryoichi Kurokawa\n\nJanuary 4 – 20 | HUB Gallery\n\nKurokawa’s immersive installation deftly uses digital methods and available commercial technologies to create moments of surprise and wonder. The artist merges sensory inputs, inspired by synaesthesia, delivering a unison of light, color, sound, and movement that explores what can be experienced within the boundaries of a frame. A time-based sculptor, Kurokawa’s Constrained Surface is characteristic of the artists’ best-known works, audiovisual installations usually composed of multiple screens where abstract motifs suddenly appear from the dark and multiply or break away as if being microscopically dissected.\n\nLindsey Kircher\n\nDecember 11 – January 19 | Art Alley\n\nKircher is a senior Schreyer Honors Scholar pursuing her Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Drawing and Painting with minors in Spanish and Arts Entrepreneurship. Her work comes from a place of longing for an alternate reality to experiences of powerlessness as a young woman. In these works, the artist subverts situations of defeat or oppression reimagining these scenes as rituals of epic female mysticism, these women form a resilient coven, commanding us to acknowledge their presence and head their warnings asserting agency and control.\n\nState College Area School District Annual K-12 Exhibition\n\nJanuary 4 – 26 | Robeson Gallery\n\nFor nearly 20 years, the HUB-Robeson Galleries have hosted the State College Area School District Annual K-12 Exhibition. Each of the district’s art teachers selects up to 10 student artworks to be included, representing a diverse array of mediums, ideas, and talent as well as many hours of skilled and creative work. This annual exhibition provides our area’s young artists with the exciting opportunity to share their artwork with the community in a highly public place that honors their work as an effective path to learning and knowledge.\n\nRace and Revolution: Still Separate, Still Unequal\n\nJanuary 29 – March 1 | HUB Gallery, Art Alley, and Woskob Family Gallery\n\nRace and Revolution: Still Separate, Still Unequal is curated by Larry Ossei-Mensah and Katie Fuller. The exhibition explores ongoing racial and economic disparity in the U.S. public school system. First presented in New York City in June 2017, the exhibit features work by 15 artists, many of whom are teachers themselves.\n\nCSA PGH and Small Mall\n\nThe exhibition highlighting two projects of Casey Droege Cultural Productions (CDCP), CSA PGH and Small Mall. CSA PGH, Community Supported Art Pittsburgh, is part of a national artist-driven movement that commissions artists to produce edition-able works that are grouped and sold to the public as art shares. Small Mall is a concept store and experimental retail space featuring art and design objects from makers in the Pittsburgh region. Both are part of CDCP’s work to create relevant and accessible art experiences connecting Pittsburgh’s creative community to a national arts conversation while encouraging the growth of local arts economies and building diverse arts audiences.\n\nSustainable Studio Class (ART 297)\n\nWorks on view by a community of makers, involved in every aspect of the natural dyeing process from planting and harvesting to making and exhibiting creative and usable objects. Students have returned to the roots of the dye industry by learning about both ancient and modern production methods, combining art, science, and history with hands-on farm work. Beginning with growing the plans on the Penn State Student Farm and concluding with a semester’s research on dye-making, this exhibit is a selection of student work from throughout the class. This year’s crop included weld, woad, dyer’s coreopsis, marigolds, yarrow, black-eyed Susans, Japanese indigo, and Hopi Black Dye sunflowers.\n\nPlug In and Turn On\n\nIan Brill, Kevin Clancy, and students from Penn State's Stuckeman School\n\nFebruary 7 - March 31 | Robeson Gallery\n\nThis exhibit is a group exhibition of artists and architects work with sound, light, and space to create environmental atmospheres. These spaces, interventions, and objects consider the potential of futures on the human scale. Artists featured are Ian Brill, Kevin Clancy, and students from Penn State's Stuckeman School.\n\nSchool of Visual Arts Annual Graduate Research Exhibition\n\nMarch 22 – April 18 | HUB Gallery\n\nFeaturing the work of the current Master of Fine Arts candidates, the Annual Graduate Research Exhibition includes several artists working in a wide variety of mediums. Candidates are challenged to effectively demonstrate the significance of their ideas and creative research to the general public. Individuals whose works and presentations are judged best will receive monetary awards.\n\nThe Annual Graduate Research Exhibition celebrates research in all its aspects as an essential and exciting part of graduate education at Penn State. Established in 1986, the Graduate Exhibition places special emphasis on communicating research and creative endeavor to a general audience and offers an opportunity for professional development by challenging graduate students to present their work in clear, comprehensible terms to people outside their fields.\n\n2018\n\nRobeson Gallery\n\nJanuary 4 – 27, 2018\n\nThe State College Area School District is honored to bring forward some of the best work from their student artists, grades kindergarten through twelve. Many two- and three-dimensional media are represented as are many hours of skilled and creative work from children throughout our community. This annual exhibition provides the young artists an exciting opportunity to share their artwork with the community in a professional setting.\n\nDisplay Cases\n\nJanuary 15 – March 15, 2018\n\nAs a child Suzanne Nugent was infatuated by windup music boxes where opening the drawer causes an articulated figure, most commonly a ballerina or clown, to start joyfully dancing. As an adult, she discovered Victorian sand automation toys that instead of using a windup mechanism, work by flipping the box 180 degrees so that the sand runs down and directly animates the figures. Her love of these simple music box automata significantly influence her paper puppets, which she makes entirely by hand using acid-free watercolor paper.\n\nNugent’s interest in jewelry making is much more recent, beginning with buying a Shrinky Dink craft kit for her kids in early 2017. While her daughters were working on their own shrunken crafts, Nugent discovered that she could make serious pieces that she could wear herself. Since then she’s created numerous designs, incorporating her own drawings and experimenting with metallic foils and resin. Around the same time that she began making jewelry, Nugent was battling granulomatous mastitis, a rare breast autoimmune disease. The disease opened her eyes to the world of other autoimmune diseases which in turn inspired much of the blue and purple butterfly jewelry designs that honor thyroid and lupus diseases.\n\nDisplay Cases\n\nJanuary 15 – March 15, 2018\n\nMaria Lupo’s work is rooted in the ecological cycles of nature and one’s relationship to the natural world. The images evoke a mythopoetic relationship with nature that expresses places and creatures both real and imagined. Through the use of tactile, natural materials such as grass seed, spanish moss, topsoil, and feathers the artwork fuses ecology and mythology bearing witness to nature’s power as well as its vulnerability.\n\nLupo begins her process by searching through dollar stores, toy departments, and garage sales, a process that she likens to a treasure hunt. Searching through materials starts her organic and fluid artistic process, and as she finds just the right body and nose pairing she begins mixing her topsoil and developing a name, personality, and images for her mythical creature.\n\nMaria Lupo was born and raised in Newark, NJ and received her BFA from Rutgers University. As part of her studies at Rutgers University, Lupo began her sculptural studies in Cennina, Italy. She continued her studies in Sculpture at Hunter College, CUNY, receiving a Master’s of Fine Arts degree. In addition to her studies as a fine artist, Lupo has completed her Post-Masters Specialization in Art Therapy from Caldwell College and is a Registered Art Therapist, holding a second Masters Degree in Counseling Psychology. Currently, she is a Doctoral Candidate in Medical Humanities at Drew University.\n\nArt on the Move — Old Main\n\nJanuary 18 – June 18, 2018\n\n“I feel blessed to live in such a beautiful area, surrounded by mountains to explore, streams and rivers to fish, and an abundant source of inspiring landscape to paint. I hope to interpret my work, for others, that which moves me when I view the land.”\n\nNatural elements, such as the soothing sound of a waterfall, the smell of a field of freshly baled hay, or the feel of a rocky climb, trigger Jeanne McKinney’s desire to capture their spirit in a painted image. By working directly outdoors, she not only paints the landscape, but becomes a real part of the landscape thus allowing her to express a more authentic and honest interpretation.\n\nMcKinney begins her artistic process by developing several studies followed by a gestural drawing in nupastel with a turpenoid wash. A variety of soft pastels are applied loosely over the under paintings working from the general to the specific. She often works with a limited palette of pastels to bring cohesiveness to a painting.\n\nJeanne McKinney is a Penn State alumna and currently resides in the State College area. She is a member of several local and national professional artist groups and has studied painting workshops with numerous Juried Associate Members of the Pastel Society of America. McKinney has exhibited her paintings in juried national and regional exhibitions, and her work can be found locally at The State College Framing Company and Gallery, The Green Drake Gallery and Arts Center, and the Gallery Shop in Lemont, Pennsylvania.\n\nHUB Gallery\n\nJanuary 22 – March 1, 2018\n\nFor John McKaig, the simple act of slowing down and putting marks on a surface becomes a perfect blend of abstract and layered thought on one hand, and practical action on the other, in a way that connects him to the first primal human actions.\n\nBy using symbols and images and giving them a new context, McKaig transforms them into a series of personal symbols describing layers of different “worlds” in order to depict his shifting identity that comes with the passage of time, his reflection of his identity and existential meaning, and to relate his experience to memories of specific events that defined him. He also layers and re-contextualizes formal elements as part of his exploration of how queer theory informs his work and his life; McKaig rejects the dominant standards in life and in imagery, and hopes that his re-contextualization of objects alludes to his exploration of his queer identity. Very often, McKaig doesn’t begin with a complete plan as to how the many layers of his works will affect each other, but takes an approach similar to that common in improvisational jazz, where he attempts to make them function on individual levels as well as in conduction with the other components.\n\nThe nautical imagery and objects that are so prevalent in his works are McKaig’s way of exploring the idea of passage through life, the idea of always being either “outward or homeward bound,” as the nautical saying goes, and to explore the idea of escape towards a potentially invigorating but perilous situation, as happens in an active life. By incorporating theatrical elements he poetically gives emphasis or inserts misdirection, such as an element appearing both as a background and a significant component, in order to allude to a dual identity or different time relationships.\n\nDepicting recognizable objects, spaces, and figurative elements allows McKaig to maintain a straight-forward connection to the viewers’ experiences. Because of his disdain for irony and cynicism, he endeavors to make his work approachable, but with the hope and expectation that it should be observed carefully and with contemplation. To that end, McKaig goes where his ideas take him, pushing aside ideas of over-analysis or cynicism, and exploring how to communicate a thematic approach in his work, often shifting to different media in order to explore how the inherent qualities of that media can allow him to make the viewer understand a richer connection between all the images.\n\nArt Alley\n\nJanuary 22 – March 12, 2018\n\nElise Warfield’s painted scenes, rendered in a melange of painterly styles, are an amalgam of quotidian iconography held together by perspectives that don’t quite match. Set in a place that doesn’t shy away from being a lie, her paintings are slightly surreal but alluring enough that we might wish they were true. By filling her paintings with layered symbolism, Warfield creates an ever-elusive and constantly-transforming meaning, leaving nothing to grasp and creating a dizzying descent that provokes uneasy undercurrents beneath the idealistic suburban dream. This is a familiar place turned unpredictable: home doesn’t make sense anymore.\n\nElise Warfield is currently a senior at Penn State majoring in Drawing & Painting. She has been awarded the Margaret Griffen Schoenfelder Memorial Scholarship, the Margaret Ellen Gray Trustee Scholarship, and the William J. and Lois Kesterson Leight Scholarship. Warfield has shown her work in several solo and group exhibitions in the State College area and has been published in the winter issue of Studio Visit and the 2017 print edition of Kalliope.\n\nArt on the Move — North Halls Cultural Lounge\n\nJanuary 25 – April 27, 2018\n\nThere’s something fascinating about a group of friends having a conversation. The subtle flicks of fingers and matching rise and fall of voices, the undulation of the crowd. Lydia Walton draws those moments; the lounging, the talking, the tilt of a chair’s legs leaned too far away from the ground. She brings those people into her imagination, separates them from their flawed reality, and lets them spill onto the page, altered to fit a strange world of her design that features similarly altered busses, streets, buildings, and other everyday environments. Walton’s work seeks to explore pervasive themes in popular entertainment as well as the effect of popular media on social interaction.\n\nLydia Walton is currently a senior at Penn State majoring in Painting and Drawing.\n\nArt on the Move — Student Health Center\n\nJanuary 29 – May 2, 2018\n\nIn this series of paintings, Claire Picard uses her experience of growing up in a structured community to illustrate the struggles of childhood. Through her use of androgynous figures and conflicting environments, Picard explores the issues of authority, body image, gender and sexuality. Common scenes of childhood and uncanny experiences are used to create deceptively creepy paintings that leave viewers with an internal struggle.\n\nClaire Picard grew up New Canaan, Connecticut, where she started painting at a young age. Picard is an active member of the SOVA community and is currently double-majoring in Art Education and Painting and Drawing at Penn State. Presently, she is working on her Schreyer Honors Thesis investigating STEM curriculum. Picard will be hosting her first solo show in early January, involving a series of oil paintings and watercolor studies.\n\nArt on the Move — West Halls Cultural Lounge\n\nJanuary 31 – April 30, 2018\n\n—\n\nArt on the Move — Student Health Center\n\nMay 18 – September 14, 2018\n\nIn this series of paintings, Allison Sheppard focused on capturing familiar spaces; overlaying the real spaces of her childhood home with her memories of the space, focusing on what she remembers most.\n\nIn order to strengthen her personal connections to each painting, Sheppard built each frame and stretched each canvas herself. She then applies watered-down acrylic paint in layers and allows it to drip and behave how it naturally wants. In this process of building, stretching, and painting Sheppard lets go of her need to be pristine and perfect because memories themselves are often imperfect and rough.\n\nAllison Sheppard is currently a senior at Penn State majoring in Painting and Drawing.\n\nRobeson Gallery\n\nFebruary 27 – April 27, 2018\n\nThis juried exhibition celebrates the 50th Anniversary of the Art Alliance of Central Pennsylvania and showcases the work of our area’s many talented artists.

Their main office and classrooms are located in Ritenour Building at the corner of Pollock and Shortlidge Roads, and the Ceramics Studio is located in the HUB-Robeson Center.\n\nThe Center for Arts and Crafts offers a variety of non-credit adult art classes during Fall and Spring semesters, and children’s art camps in the summer. All classes are taught by Penn State University Art majors, Art Education majors, graduate students and professional artists.\n\nArt on the Move — Old Main\n\nMay 4 – September 21, 2018\n\nThrough abstraction of figure and space, Lindsey Kircher investigates the absurdity inherent to the social experiences of young adulthood and how she finds her place within them. Using simplified form as a tool, Kircher revisits memories and captures their generalized essence. Though these paintings are about her own life experiences, they access a greater exploration of human community and the individual's role within it.\n\nLindsey Kircher is a senior Penn State Schreyer Honors scholar pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and minors in Spanish and Arts Entrepreneurship.\n\nHUB Gallery\n\nMay 29 – July 28, 2018\n\nA→CHROMATIC represents a comprehensive overview of painter J. Harlan Ritchey’s artistic development and coincides with the 5-year anniversary of his introduction to the gallery world.\n\nThe subject matter of A→CHROMATIC can be divided into four broad genres: landscape, still life, floral, and abstract. Within each of these genres, Ritchey works to explore specific themes and emphasize the elements that he considers to be most conducive to those themes. In the landscape genre, those themes are a connection to perspective and place while the floral genre explores a connection to rhythm and color; the still life genre emphasizes a connection to composition and form, and the abstract genre’s theme focuses on a connection to pattern and theory. Each image carries a range of art-historical, cultural, and biographical influences but invites the viewer to arrive at their own aesthetic or critical judgments.\n\nJ. Harlan Ritchey received his BA in Filmmaking from Penn State in 1999, with Honors in Visual Arts. He is a self-taught artist and has for the past several years done fine art and illustration commissions for a range of local and national clients. Ritchey’s first public exhibition was in 2013, and in 2015 he began teaching art classes. He currently lives and works in State College, PA.\n\nRobeson Gallery\n\nJune 5 – August 24, 2018\n\nKindred methodologies in mark-making techniques and appreciation for agricultural spaces bring artists Jo Margolis and Kate McGraw into the fold of artistic collaboration and formal discussion. Exacting and rigorous, each artist employs their astute sense of agency by using simple tools to mark the surface of their chosen material - paper, stone, wood or wall – while consciously allowing for the drawn forms to grow organically. Over the course of many rigorous drawing sessions, these hallowed surfaces become enveloped with careful inscriptions, serving as documents of time – evocative of sacred texts, or illuminated manuscripts.\n\n“I am fascinated by the essence of calligraphic shapes and sacred texts. Some of my latest work focuses on forms that emerge, the softness of clarity until we know what it is becoming. There is something in unknowing that is both humbling and hopeful.”\n\n– Jo Margolis\n\nMargolis and McGraw find comradery and appreciation for agricultural life and their local landscapes of Southcentral Pennsylvania that inform their sense of place and home. As a farmer tends to the land, each artist toils over surfaces with pen, graphite, crayon or pencil in earnest cultivation. The direct action of drawing tools meeting surface is the performance and vehicle for manifestation. Experiencing the artistic process as meditative labor is an essential component to the artists’ work. Intentions transmute into textural surface planes, meandering departures and connections, and floating tapestries that consider the void in space, as well as the occupied.\n\n“My most recent work honors the infusion of light and spectrum as the vehicle for expansion and ascension. My studio, as it stands today, is a makeshift time machine and incubator space for off-site projects, installations and performances, paintings and drawings, sites and shiny objects.”\n\n– Kate McGraw\n\nMargolis and McGraw combine austere, monastic minimalism with the whimsical and enchanted to create atmospheres for contemplation and reflection, as well as metamorphosis and expansion. Both artists were born and raised in Southcentral Pennsylvania. Jo Margolis lives and works in Wellsville in York County and Kate McGraw lives and works in Boiling Springs, Cumberland County. Margolis earned her BFA and MFA from University of Pennsylvania. McGraw earned her BFA from Penn State and her MFA from Brooklyn College.\n\nArt Alley\n\nMay 14 – September 18, 2018\n\nDavid Moyer’s work begins with his interest in books and the written word, which drives him to look for ways to combine his creative imagery with text. His prints explore visual and literary ideas through drawings and black and white print media. Moyer typically employs the method of wood engraving, which is deeply rooted in the history of the book arts, though he does occasionally incorporate intaglio processes lithography.\n\nMoyer’s technique stems from his interest in the quality of line, where his ideas are conceived as black lines on a white ground thereby focusing on the graphic quality of wood engraving rather than on the tonal quality. His preference for black-line engraving is driven by his fondness for the German print tradition and the works of Albrecht Durer, Michael Wolgemut, Lucas Cranach, Hans Holbein, and Hans Baldung Grein.\n\nIn 1988 Moyer and his wife Gretchen founded Red Howler Press in order to print handmade, limited-edition fine press and artist books. All of the books from Red Howler Press carry a message — sometimes serious, sometimes playful — but it is primarily the visual imagery that is the primary communicator in these pressed works. Moyer’s Red Howler Press books are housed in numerous libraries across the United States, Canada, and Europe.\n\nCurrently, David Moyer is an Assistant Professor of Graphic Design at Penn College of Technology. He earned his MFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art and his BFA from the University of Delaware. Moyer has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and Internationally, and is a member of The Society of Wood Engravers, The Wood Engravers Network, and The Fine Press Book Association.\n\nHuman Figure Furniture | Keunho Peter Park\n\nHUB Gallery | August 29 – December 2, 2018 | Reception: October 18, 5–7pm\n\nPark's functional wood works elevate and celebrate the meaningful spaces in the home. In this selection of works made between 2012 and 2017, Park takes inspiration from the beauty of creature and human forms, emphasizing the important roles that functional objects, such as furniture or musical instruments, play in our lives.\n\nRachel Eng\n\nDisplay Cases | September 14 – November 12, 2018\n\nRachel Eng’s work collects and combines small, unmonumental, found, and created objects that aggregate or accumulate. For Eng, a raindrop, grain of sand, or microscopic bacterium when gathered together becoming noticeable and impacting. She makes and physically manifests biological and social relationships between the micro and macro with visual complexity.\n\nEng is an Assistant Professor at Dickinson College and a Penn State Alum (‘10). Her solo exhibition Even Out is on view at The Woskob Family Gallery through November 10th.\n\nOverlap: Life Tapestries | Curated by Vida Sabbaghi\n\nRobeson Gallery | September 17 – November 15, 2018 | Reception, Performance, and Panel: September 20, 5–8pm\n\nOverlap: Life Tapestries is a group exhibition of self-identified women of different social and professional backgrounds and generations. These artists find a commonality in imaginatively recreating the tapestry of their lives through their art while mapping the relationship between the personal and political.\n\nCollective | Penn State Painting Club\n\nArt Alley | September 27 – November 29, 2018 | Reception: October 18, 5–7pm\n\nA student-led exhibition, featuring the breadth and depth of artworks created by current members and recent graduates of the Penn State Painting Club. Founded in 2011, Painting Club provides creative community and collective-generated opportunities to its members, such as studio visits, lectures, field trips, peer critiques, pop-up shows, and faculty mentorship outside the classroom.\n\nEclectic Collections: Penn State Museums\n\nThe Penn State University Museum Consortium is a network of museum professionals committed to the unique and irreplaceable collections at a myriad of museums at University Park. This exhibit showcases a selection of items on loan from the Earth and Mineral Sciences Museum & Art Gallery, Eberly Family Special Collections Library, Ecosystem Science and Management Natural History Collection, Frost Entomological Museum, Matson Museum of Anthropology, Pasto Agricultural Museum, Palmer Museum of Art, All-Sports Museum, Radiation Science and Engineering Center, Woskob Family Gallery and the HUB-Robeson Galleries.\n\n2017\n\nRobeson Gallery\n\nJanuary 5 – January 28, 2017\n\nThe State College Area School District is honored to bring forward some of the best work from their student artists, grades kindergarten through twelve. Many two— and three—dimensional media are represented as are many hours of skilled and creative work from children throughout our community.\n\nArt Alley\n\nJanuary 13 – March 2, 2017\n\nHelen Maser’s work explores themes and ideas through the lens of Audre Lorde’s popular writings, The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House (1984). In using this framework of dismantling the master’s house, Maser uses art as a tool to speak about pressing issues and combat the patriarchy. For her, the “personal becomes political” as a form of resistance.\n\nThrough her development of memory, language, and facilitation of difficult content and conversations, Maser works in the gap of underrepresented and often silenced issues. By using imagery of self-portraiture, pipes, and sites of home improvement stores, her intertwining of rope, blurring of paint, and her resistant gaze counter not only her experiences, but reframe trauma and violence into empowerment and self-autonomy. In moments where representation turns into abstraction, she obtains liberty from the past and reclaims her own body.\n\nHelen Maser is originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and currently resides in State College where she is a student at Penn State working towards her Bachelor of Fine Arts in both Painting and Sculpture. Over the past four years, Maser has shown her work in several exhibitions in the State College area. She has also been awarded the Brian Bretzler Memorial Award in Visual Arts, and in 2016 was winner of Rough Intent, an exhibition juried by Richard Reinhart.\n\nHUB Gallery\n\nJanuary 19 – March 2, 2017\n\nArmed with her favorite pairs of scissors, a pair of 4” hair cutting scissors and fly-tying scissors with large finger holes, Rosenberg transforms paper and other easily-cut materials into intricate and versatile designs. In addition to being displayed as originals, her paper cuts have also been used as stencils, screen printed onto recycled clothing, projected as part of theatrical sets, and used as the design for the State College Women’s Resource Center’s holiday cards since the 1990s.\n\nRosenberg finds inspiration in the Lake Country where she grew up, her Finnish heritage, her travels, and the literature, music, and folk arts that she loves. While her cutting style is her own, it is more closely related to Mexican “papel picado” and Finnish and Inuit carving and printmaking than the traditional European “scherenschnitte” that is most commonly associated with paper cutting.\n\nRosenberg began to cut paper artistically in her 40’s. Making art from scissors and paper had already been familiar to her at a young age, due to her father’s job at a paper company and her affinity for cutting her own paper dolls. But it wasn’t until after her formal education; a degree in Music and English from St. Olaf College in Northfield Minnesota, a Masters of Education in Human Development from Penn State, and a partial degree in Theatre and additional classes in photography and printmaking, that she arrived back where she began — cutting paper.\n\nShe recalls, “When I began to carry paper and scissors in my purse, years ago, I realized that I had found my medium at last.”\n\nArt on the Move — West Halls Cultural Lounge\n\nFebruary 1 – May 5, 2017\n\nMisty Frederick-Ritz is a painter, jewelry maker, mixed media artist, and digital artist from State College, Pennsylvania. She has a passion for color and texture and loves spending time in her studio. She primarily works with acrylics, water colors, water soluble crayons, inks, polymer clay, beads and buttons, fabrics and fibers, and colored pencils. Frederick-Ritz’s recent works, painted in a style known as “contemporary symbolism,” best represent her as a creative and spiritual person. Frequently featuring a feminine archetype, her paintings are an “outer” representation of her “inner” self.\n\nFrederick-Ritz has shown her work in various locations in Central Pennsylvania and is a certified “Color of Woman” teacher. She offers individual and group classes on painting, art journaling, and mixed media and creates opportunities for Central Pennsylvania women and girls to come together in groups and workshops providing community, connection, thought-provoking discussions, and activities that foster personal growth & self-discovery. Her goal is to spark creativity in others and to provide a positive and encouraging environment to help others learn to express themselves through art and writing.\n\nRobeson Gallery\n\nFebruary 16 – April 28, 2017\n\nAaron Maybin is a retired professional football player turned artist. After retiring from the NFL in 2014, he turned his focus towards his talent for art. His paintings, photography, and writings focus on socially relevant themes and issues, including the struggle of African-Americans to be seen not just as equals but as human beings, deserving of respect and basic dignity. Maybin’s work is representative of that struggle and serves as a platform to start difficult conversations, with the hope that it can bring people from opposing sides of the spectrum together and spark important conversations that may otherwise not happen. “Art serves as a bridge between people of different backgrounds, religions, sexuality, and economic class. Such a tool is essential in the fight to break down the many social, cultural, and political barriers that divide us and bring us all to a place where we can find a true common ground in reason,” Maybin says.\n\nWhile his work focuses on themes and issues that may not be positive themselves, he always begins a new piece by questioning how the messages will positively affect viewers and the community. By keeping this positive focus, Maybin is able to use his work to advocate for the issues that are important to him: racial and economic equality, arts education, and programming in underprivileged communities. Larry “Poncho” Brown, Maybin’s artistic mentor, has described his vibrant depictions of inspirations, racial strife, and communal love, hope, and disappointment as “a mix of good technical ability, ‘hip-hop flair,’ and a probing desire to depict modern black consciousness.”\n\nAaron Maybin is a former All-American defensive end from Penn State, where he double-majored in Communications and Integrative Arts. He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills as 11th overall pick in the 2009 NFL draft and went on to play for the New York Jets and the Cincinnati Bengals before retiring from football in 2014. In 2009 he started Project Mayhem, a nonprofit foundation that provides personal and economic aid to underprivileged and at-risk youth so that they can excel beyond their current conditions.\n\nHUB Gallery\n\nMarch 24 – April 23, 2017\n\nThis juried exhibition displays the studio art portion of the Annual Graduate Research Exhibition, offering students the opportunity to display their work in a professional setting.

Despite this, he sensed a feeling of sadness and anticipation that the peace they were then experiencing was ephemeral and aimed to capture that feeling through his photography. Unfortunately, their fears about the fragility of peace were right. Much of what Shapiro saw, and some of the people he met, have been destroyed by the recent war. These photographs are a glimpse of his experience, reflecting the mixed emotions he felt then and the sadness he feels now for a rich and ancient civilization driven into despair and chaos.\n\nHUB Gallery\n\nMay 10 – June 18, 2017\n\nGang Meng, Cheng Shi, and Bingyan Xue are three Nanjing graphic designers who are all well-versed in contemporary Chinese poster design and are dedicated to modernizing traditional Chinese culture in graphic design. This exhibition features a selection of their recent and daring works, in which they experiment with the shape of Chinese characters and push the boundary of Chinese type design to embody the expressive, nostalgic, and impressionistic feelings of the characters.\n\nGang Meng is a Penn State visiting scholar from Nanjing Tech University, Jiangsu Province, China. He has published and lectured internationally in multi-disciplinary design including, but not limited to: visual communications, packaging, advertising, computer graphics, and designing modules. Meng focuses on culture-based design, user analysis, and modernization of traditional design and has participated in several research projects including: City Image Design, Corporation Image Design, and several other provincial and school level projects.\n\nArt on the Move – Old Main\n\nMay 12 – September 17, 2017\n\nFernanda Bonafini first began drawing mandalas as a way to relieve stress and balance emotions. Her first mandalas were drawn on black paper with gel pens and she later migrated to using black ink pens on white paper. More recently, she has begun working with heat transfer to add various colors of reflective foil to her original black ink mandalas.\n\nThe term mandala means “circle” in Sanskrit, however mandalas are much more than just circles to her; they also represent wholeness and inner peace. Even Ataraxiaowl, her chosen artistic name, synthesizes the message she wants to convey in her drawings, as Ataraxia means “a lucid state of robust tranquility and ongoing freedom from distress and worry,” while owl represents wisdom and the ability to navigate any darkness in life.\n\nBonafini draws inspiration from other contemporary mandala artists, her personal journey towards self-knowledge and self-awareness, and her affinity for geometry and symmetry. She hopes that her work can help others improve concentration, increase creativity, decrease anxiety and stress, and increase physical and emotional balance.\n\nFernanda Bonafini is currently a student at Penn State earning her Ph.D. in Curriculum and Instruction — Mathematics Education and a concurrent Masters degree in Applied Statistics.\n\nArt on the Move — Old Main\n\nMay 12, 2017 – January 17, 2018\n\nBeverly Klucher is a prolific oil painter whose primary focus is on costal scenes and landscapes. Her paintings have been exhibited extensively throughout the Eastern United States and sold to private & Corporate collectors. Many of her pastoral scenes are reflective of the Central Pennsylvania region, while many of her beach scenes are captured while on her annual trip to Cape Cod, Florida. Regardless of the scene, the fluidity of light combined with the spontaneity of her brush strokes depicts a sense of calm in the moment.\n\nAs the daughter of a Naval officer, Klucher was blessed with the opportunity to travel extensively as a child. She quickly realized that she could visually communicate her experiences with pencil and chalk. Her talent was obvious to those around her and soon Klucher realized the importance of pursuing her love of art.\n\nBeverly Klucher is a Fine Arts graduate of Pennsylvania State University and has completed further graduate work in Landscape Painting at Maryland Institute of Art. She and her husband currently reside in the State College area where they both appreciate the sweeping views of the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nArt Alley\n\nMay 19 – September 7, 2017\n\nAs we move through everyday life amidst political uncertainty and fear, we search for the broken parts to reveal where we went wrong. Miranda Holmes’ work enters into this conversation through the ambiguous nature of her paintings’ narratives as well as their underlying feelings of unsettledness. By using sickly high-key colors and foggy darks to poke fun at both the absurdity of our gaffes and the dread of our more cutting mistakes, Holmes’ work addresses the culpability of human actions. She creates a sense of ambiguity in her paintings by leaving out certain clues which allows the viewer to pass judgement on where the scene went wrong.\n\nProviding contrast to the underlying violence and irony are a variety of quieter moments, found in the form of fog-ridden trees, the glow of a campfire, or a muscular rock. These shifts between moments of clarity and hope to areas of obscurity and despair are representative of her reactions to the daily uncertainty Holmes faces as she struggles to make sense of the swift changes in her world.\n\nMiranda Holmes is a State College native and a recent graduate of Penn State, where she earned her BFA in Painting and Drawing. She has shown her work in several exhibitions in the State College area, including the HUB-Robeson Galleries’ Art on the Move program in 2016. She was awarded the Ellen Battell Stoeckel Fellowship to attend the Yale Summer School of Art in Norfolk, Connecticut in 2016.\n\nRobeson Gallery\n\nJune 11 – September 7, 2017\n\nFeaturing a variety of historical and novelty bicycles from the collection of Bob Swaim, artists Thomas Fainor, Ben Bowden, Kerry McLean, Eric Staller, and Tommmi Miller take the viewer on a two-wheeled tour of the art and history of bicycles.\n\nThomas Fainor, a wood and metal artist with a very strong mechanical nature and background, begins the historical aspect of The Art & History of Bicycles with his reproductions of a Hobby Horse and Boneshaker. These are followed chronologically by an unknown artist who created the Highwheeler, or Pennyfarthing, and an early Safety Bicycle, which was the precursor to bicycles as we know them today.\n\nBen Bowden, a British industrial designer, bridges the gap between art and history with his Bowden Spacelander. The Spacelander, when originally released in 1960, was initially considered commercially unsuccessful until the 1980s when a resurgence of interest in the Spacelander as a collectors item led two bicycle enthusiasts to purchase the rights to the name and began manufacturing reproductions.\n\nKerry McLean is most famous for his design, production, and use of monocycles, which are large, one-wheeled vehicles that the rider sits inside of. Accompanying the Human Powered Monocycle in this exhibit are two one-of-a-kid creations by McLean: a low-rider bicycle and a whole-body tricycle.\n\nEric Staller is an American artist who uses light and architecture in the creation of his works. He is considered to be one of the pioneers of the Art Car Movement with his 7-person Conference Bike and Love Bike Built for Two.\n\nTommmi Miller is an American artist from Indiana who creates artistically unique bicycles that are then used by performers. Even though Miller’s passion is for unicycles, evident in his Triple-Wheeled Unicycle, he has also created the Off-Centered Wheel Bicycle, a One-of-a-kind Tricycle, and Reverse Steering Kits for bicycles.\n\nBob Swaim’s collection of unique human-powered vehicles began with he first saw Tommmi Miller traveling in an old school bus to display his units at a bicycle convention in Iowa in the 1990s. Swaim’s first unique unit came from Miller, and his collection has since grown to include over 200 pieces from a variety of artists. Inspired by Miller, Swaim travels with his bikes in a 24-foot trailer to display subsets of his collection at various events, museums, and schools.\n\nHUB Gallery\n\nJune 30 – September 12, 2017\n\nAmanda McCavour works with stitch to create large-scale embroidered installations. By sewing into fabric that dissolves in water, she can build up stitched lines on a temporary surface. While sewing, she crosses the threads over themselves repeatedly so that after the fabric has dissolved, the thread drawing can hold itself together despite appearing as though it could easily unravel and fall apart at any moment.\n\nMcCavour is interested in thread’s assumed vulnerability, its ability to unravel, and its strength when sewn together. Her works explore embroidery’s duality: its structural possibility vs. its fragility and its subtle quality vs. its accumulative presence. Through experimentation and creation, she investigates line in the context of embroidery, drawing and installation, and uses stitch to explore connections to home, fibers of the body, and more formal considerations of thread’s accumulative presence.\n\nAmanda McCavour earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts from York University where she studied drawing and, in May 2014, completed her Master of Fine Arts in Fibers and Materials Studies at Tyler School of Art. She displays her work nationally and internationally, most recently in Ottawa, Virginia Beach, and Vancouver, and has recently completed residencies at Harbourfront Centre’s Textiles Studio in Toronto, Maison des Metiers D’art de Quebec in Quebec City, and the Klondike Institute of Art and Culture in Dawson City, Yukon. McCavour has received numerous awards and scholarships from The Canada Council for the Arts, The Handweavers and Spinners Guild of America, The Ontario Crafts Council, The Ontario Society of Artists, The Surface Design Association, and The Embroiderers Guild of America.\n\nFor more information on Amanda McCavour, visit her on Facebook or Instagram.\n\nArt on the Move — North Halls Cultural Lou"
