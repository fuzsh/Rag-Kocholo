Are you ready to take a walk on the full-bodied side? There are not a lot of full-bodied Daiginjos on the market, and that’s what makes this brew so special. It is very luxurious! Viscous, round, velvety, chewy, and vast, the fluid is one of those \"feel good stories\" in your palate. Look for tropical fruit flavors such as mango, papaya, sweet pear, strawberry, grape, honeydew, and touch of citrus. How in the world can rice and water taste like this fruit basket of flavors? That’s the magic of this sake, and the chewy body is the bonus. This brewery makes killer sake, and this premium full-bodied brew will soon become a cult classic. WORD: Luxurious WINE: Large Reds/Fat Whites BEER: Fruity Belgian Ales FOODS: Champagne fare, shellfish, sashimi and American sushi, fruit salads, pasta, and pates.\n\nPrefecture\n\nYamaguchi\n\nSMV\n\n-1\n\nAcidity\n\n1.5"
