        "text": "For all of Warren Micale’s adult life, buses have been a driving force in living his faith.\n\nHe first drove a school bus at age 20 in 1978 while attending Bible college. Throughout the years, driving a bus continued to be a way to make extra money while he pursued his pastoral calling.\n\n“After I left the last church I pastored, I supplemented my income by driving for tour buses while working for a mission,” Micale says. “And then I had a lot of churches and a lot of people who were trying to push me, saying hey, we’d love to have a bus company with high integrity and some Christian standards. And so we prayed a lot about it, and we ended up with our first bus.”\n\nIn 2000, the former minister transitioned from part-time driving to becoming a motorcoach operator with one used motorcoach. The success of Master’s Touch over the next 24 years is a testament to faith, growth and an unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nMicale had an 18-year tenure in pastoral service before he launched the company with the purchase of its first bus, a Van Hool T940. That experience has deeply influenced the company’s ethos, which emphasizes care, integrity and a personal touch.\n\n“When we started our company, the first bus was bought at ABC Companies,” said Micale. “They were the only people at the time who would finance the startup bus company, and so we just stayed with them. They treated us very well through the years.”\n\nGrowth through service\n\nMaster’s Touch is in Prescott Valley, Arizona, about 100 miles north of Phoenix. It has evolved from serving only local churches to partnering with institutions and offering comprehensive services to schools, churches, tours and more.\n\nThe inclusion of Micale’s wife, Debby, in the business and the acquisition of a maintenance and parking facility seven years ago underscores the company’s dedication to growth and self-reliance.\n\nThe business has expanded into the travel agency sector, offering personalized tour packages and managing several cruises annually to destinations like Alaska, Hawaii and the Panama Canal.\n\n“We do everything from day trips to multiday tours. We’ve been all the way up into Maine and the New England states for fall colors. We’ve done cruises,” said Micale. “We do pretty much everything.”\n\nThis evolution has not only scaled the company’s growth but also adapted it to changing customer needs, ensuring that every tour offers something new.\n\n“We’ve got a great relationship with the people who travel with us. We have many of them that have traveled many, many times, but several of them over 100 trips with us,” said Micale. “We always have full service with a hostess on board. We don’t charge our people for water or snacks or the guide.”\n\nThe company employs husband-and-wife teams as hosts and drivers on tours, ensuring a more personal experience.\n\nMaintaining ‘rolling billboards’\n\nMaster’s Touch prides itself on its safety record and attention to its fleet’s maintenance and appearance. It has a modern fleet of five coaches typically no more than three to four years old that receives meticulous care, including regular hand-waxing every six weeks and a stringent upkeep routine.\n\n“We have purchased 23 buses through the years because we’ve always tried to keep them within five years old,” Micale said.\n\n“Everything is fully detailed between every tour and when it comes off the road. It gets fully detailed before it rolls again. Our drivers keep it spotless on the road as well. It’s kind of a rolling billboard, so the nicer it looks, the more opportunities we get.”\n\nThe partnership with ABC Companies has been instrumental in the growth of Master’s Touch. Faced with the challenges of financing, especially during tough economic times such as the COVID-19 pandemic, ABC Companies provided unwavering support.\n\nThe preference for ABC’s Van Hool CX35 and CX45 models, noted for their parts consistency, and the specialized TX40 Tour coach reflects a choice for quality, reliability and long-term partnership.\n\n“We’ve just had a good relationship,” said Micale.\n\nFaithful to its mission\n\nAs Master’s Touch looks to the future, it remains dedicated to innovating while staying true to its roots. Whether it’s through the introduction of international tours and riverboat excursions or the evolution of tour itineraries to include unique experiences, the company is poised for continued growth.\n\nYet, at its core, Master’s Touch remains a family-run business that values its Christian foundation, evident in its dedication to service, community events and its message that faith and integrity have been key to overcoming challenges and achieving an impressive safety record.\n\n“We’ve actually turned down business,” Micale said. “We don’t do any bar trips or gambling trips or things of that nature. We turn that down because that’s not what we feel we’re here for. The name of your business also reflects that commitment. The master, God, has put his touch on this world, and we’re taking people out to see it.”\n\nWith that vision, Master’s Touch continues to navigate the road ahead.\n\n“Our attitude has always been it’s about the people, it’s not about the money,” Micale said, recalling the time a police officer asked to speak with him in a stern voice.\n\n“He said, ‘I want to thank you because since my dad passed away, my mother has not traveled because she’s never felt safe, and now she feels great traveling with you guys.’\n\n“We want people to feel safe and comfortable and know that people care about them when they’re traveling.”"
