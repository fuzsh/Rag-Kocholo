        "text": "COMBINED / DESCRIPTIVE TRANSCRIPT\n\nOn screen:\n\nThree people closely huddle together as a woman leads a conversation. A man and a woman each gently rest one hand on the lead woman’s hands, and their other hand on her leg. They nod their heads as they tap the lead woman’s legs. Outside the huddle, two hearing-sighted interpreters sit behind the Deafblind participants. Each interpreter rests one hand on a Deafblind person’s leg.\n\nHAYLEY BROADWAY:\n\nTouch is taboo in our society and in our culture. So we learn an attitude that we internalize from a very young age, “Look, don’t touch; look with your eyes, not your hands.” And as we grow up, those thoughts are really embedded deeply within us and we have to do a lot of work to kind of unlearn, relearn, and recenter, and then apply the norms that we feel right about, that do fit us as DeafBlind people, because hearing sighted norms do not.\n\nSide note:\n\nSoft piano music plays.\n\nA sketch in white on a black background of hands resting over each other.\n\nText on screen:\n\nA title: Protactile, a Language of Touch.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA signer points and taps on a woman’s thigh.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nOK, this is Rebecca.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn the huddle, Rebecca, in a black sweater, signs as the other two lightly rest and hover their hands over hers. As the man and woman actively listen, they tap Rebecca’s leg and nod their heads.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank you both…\n\nOn screen:\n\nRebecca touches the others’ chests.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\n…sincerely, for coming and sharing your time with me today. Today, I will be learning a whole new language. All the people I will be interviewing are DeafBlind.\n\nINTERPRETER:\n\nIt encapsulates Protactile.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nThe voices you hear are interpreters…\n\nINTERPRETER:\n\nIt is so rich and comes with so much more.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\n…and so this is a story that may unfold an unfamiliar way.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThree deafblind people stand, their hands resting and hovering on one anothers’. One woman leans her head closely to the man, then the woman.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nThese are the creators and teachers of Protactile (or PT) and they will be taking us inside their world: a world experienced and expressed wholly through touch.\n\nROBERTO CABRERA:\n\nOur biggest organ is our skin, so why don’t we use it?\n\nHAYLEY BROADWAY:\n\nWe are really touching something. What is its texture? What is its temperature? What is its shape? DeafBlind people typically get information last.\n\nROBERTO CABRERA:\n\nHow do we know that people even are around us? We don’t, if they don’t touch us.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn archival footage a woman rests her hand on the hand of another woman who is wearing dark glasses. Her other hand rests on a man’s hand as he fingerspells.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nHistorically, DeafBlind people have had to rely on others: interpreters and support service providers.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA sighted woman walks a deafblind man across the street.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nThey have traditionally communicated with American Sign Language (or ASL), or tactile sign language.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA woman signs in the air. Another signs into a partner’s palm.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nBut Protactile is completely different from anything that’s come before it.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA deafblind man and woman stand closely as they use protactile communication. Interpreters stand alongside, each resting a hand on a communicator’s arm. A fifth person observes, from outside this group.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nIt is a language created by the DeafBlind, for the DeafBlind.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThree people walk side by side along a river. The two on the outside use mobility canes with one hand and the inside person’s hand with the other. They stop and huddle to converse.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nHaving agency is at the center of Protactile. It allows for direct contact with people and their environment without someone in between. Protactile fosters group communication, deeper connection, and community.\n\nSide note:\n\nThey laugh.\n\nOn screen:\n\nRebecca, who has long brown hair and dark glasses, walks along a city sidewalk with a mobility cane.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nI am Rebecca Alexander and I have Usher syndrome. Usher syndrome is a rare genetic condition that is the leading cause of progressive combined deafness and blindness in the U.S. and around the world. Needless to say, I have a vested interest in learning this new language.\n\nOn screen:\n\nRebecca sits in a close triangle with a woman, Hailey, and a man, Roberto. Two interpreters sit just outside the triangle, their hands on the deafblind speakers’ legs.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nProtactile began in 2007, and like all languages, it has its own grammar and syntax. It’s communicated with the hands and articulated in contact space…\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn another group, an interpreter rests her hand on a man’s back, as two others sign on his back and shoulder.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\n…using the arms, shoulders, back, and legs. This patting here is called back channeling, the equivalent of nodding. A way of indicating “I am following.”\n\nOn screen:\n\nRebecca pats Hailey’s leg urgently. Roberto makes a scritching motion on Rebecca’s leg.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nProtactile can also provide background information like how many people are in the room, whether they’re sitting, standing, or even what’s on the television in the waiting room of a doctor’s office.\n\nText on screen:\n\nCreator Jelica Nuccio.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA woman with long hair greying at the temples sits with Rebecca.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nJelica Nuncio, a trailblazer and one of the creators of Protactile, served as my guide.\n\nText on screen:\n\nInterpreter Halene Anderson:\n\nJELICA NUNCIO:\n\nSo I’m gonna use our legs and first of all check in with you Rebecca to make sure that you’re comfortable. Are you comfortable with how we’re arranged? OK, so our torsos are a little far away, so we want to be close like this because we’re gonna be using our torsos and our arms and our legs when we’re talking in PT.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThey sit a foot apart.\n\nJELICA NUNCIO:\n\nSo we’re gonna really just focus on what we’re feeling between the two of us. You try to feel me as much you can Rebecca, OK? Don’t worry about leaning back and trying to see, OK? Just really try to feel my language because that’s what I’m expressing is all through touch.\n\nOn screen:\n\nJelica moves her hands as Rebecca holds hers over them. In a black and white photo, a dark-haired girl reaches into a pot of shellfish.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nJelica was born in Croatia, the only DeafBlind person in her family. She did not have language until her family moved to the U.S. and she learned American Sign Language. She received a master’s degree in public health and in 2007 became the first ever DeafBlind director of the DeafBlind Institute in Seattle.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA two-story office building.\n\nJELICA NUNCIO:\n\nHistorically, it’s been run by hearing/sighted folks, but when I got in as director, we switched to a new model. We couldn’t afford a huge budget for interpreters. So we had lots of different programs and projects that we are running and we thought, well, we’re going to do this ourselves, this works. We said we’re not going to be using hearing/sighted norms here. We’re not gonna be abiding by Deaf norms either and people said, “well then, what are we gonna do?” because we hadn’t been in communication directly historically and we established a PT Zone first and foremost there. And we said, anyone who comes into this space is not to be speaking in English. So there’s no auditory communication here and there’s no visual ASL happening either. Instead, when you come in, what you need to do is walk up to us and touch us.\n\nOn screen:\n\nA program title: Welcome. Protactile Language Interpreting National Eduation Program.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nAs Protactile developed and its benefits became clear, Jelica went on to found Tactile Communications, a learning and education center for DeafBlind people.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn a video, she demonstrates with a mannequin.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nShe also trains interpreters at the Protactile house…\n\nOn screen:\n\nA grey, two story house.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\n…the first and only of its kind in the world housed in Mommouth, Oregon near Western Oregon University.\n\nOn screen:\n\nJelica touches Rebecca’s face.\n\nJELICA NUNCIO:\n\nProtactile language has been researched since 2010 and there are many, many rules. And these aren’t arbitrary rules; these are rules that have arisen organically within the language.\n\nOn screen:\n\nRebecca nods.\n\nJELICA NUNCIO:\n\nIf you think about how a person may tactically access ASL, well, it’s akin to lip reading in that we would be missing 70 percent of the information because there’s no contact with our bodies; everything is up in airspace.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\n70 percent. Imagine receiving only one third of what someone is trying to convey to you.\n\nOn screen:\n\nTwo deafblind speakers give a presentation, resting and hovering their hands over the others’. Interpreters stand behind each speaker, their hands on the speakers’ backs.\n\nJELICA NUNCIO:\n\nSo instead, what we use in Protactile is a four-handed grammar. We’re articulating onto the body of our interlocutor…\n\nOn screen:\n\nJelica models Protacile as she touches Rebecca’s upper chest and arm while conversing.\n\nJELICA NUNCIO:\n\n…and now, more and more Protactile words are coming into their own. We’re not borrowing ASL words as much as we did in the beginning. ASL signs derive from a visual environment and we want to be articulating what we’re feeling. How something feels is very different than how something looks.\n\nOn screen:\n\nRebecca signs and speaks to the camera:\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nSo for example, ASL sign for dog. There’s two different signs: First, dog…\n\nOn screen:\n\nShe waves her fingers beside the ear.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\n…like, scratching the ear, second is dog.\n\nOn screen:\n\nShe extends her hand forward and makes a sign based on finger spelling.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nProtactile sign for dog is this…\n\nOn screen:\n\nHer middle and ring fingers touch her thumb, forming a snout. Index and pinkie fingers\n\nextend up like ears.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\n…because when you feel it, it feels like what the head of a dog feels like. This is the Protactile sign for dog.\n\nText on screen:\n\nEducators Hailey Broadway and Roberto Cabrera.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThey sit in a close triangle with Rebecca, each person resting a hand on another’s hand and leg.\n\nSide note:\n\nEuphoric music plays.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nJelica works closely with Hayley Broadway and Roberto Cabrera. We sat in circle to have this discussion. Protactile is especially groundbreaking because it allows DeafBlind people the opportunity to communicate in a group.\n\nOn screen:\n\nInterpreter Halene Anderson voices for Hailey, a woman with layered, shoulder-length hair and a blue blouse:\n\nHAYLEY BROADWAY:\n\nThe way that we’re set up here in this Protactile three-way allows us all to know not only that we’re all three in conversation with one another, but also where we each are in space and what each of us is experiencing at the same time. We’re all sharing at the knees, not the eyes and face, which is a hallmark of ASL, but the knees and the hands and the legs.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThey pat each others’ legs. Now, a photo of two preteen kids with glasses. They pose with dad and a puppy.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nHayley and her brother both have Usher syndrome and were raised by hearing parents who learned how to sign to communicate with them. She is a Protactile instructor for DeafBlind children and their families.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn another photo, three generations pose by a Christmas tree.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nRoberto is third-generation DeafBlind and a vocational rehabilitation counselor and teacher for people who are deaf and DeafBlind.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn an animated protactile chat, an interpreter backchannels by rolling his knuckles on others’ backs. Roberto traces a smile at the interpreter and laughs. Interpreter Tony Bonny voices for Roberto:\n\nROBERTO CABRERA:\n\nThe way we’re arranged is so that we can share information, we can have a natural, organic conversation. That’s why we’re established the way we are. And we set up information to be shared on a variety of sources. It could be on your forearm, it could be on your thigh, it could be on your shoulder. It really depends on how you want to express the information being shared and reciprocate that.\n\nText on screen:\n\nTouch can tell you a thousand words.\n\nOn screen:\n\nRebecca signs, as Roberto and Hailey rest their hands over hers.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nSo, you know, in the hearing world, there’s a saying that the eyes are the windows to the soul.\n\nOn screen:\n\nShe touches their chests.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nHow do you feel about touch the way that hearing people have that saying?\n\nROBERTO CABRERA:\n\nTouch will tell you a thousand words. I mean you look at a picture and that tells you a thousand words but really touch, it has energy, it has emotion. Everything is right here at our fingertips. I mean there is so much you can obtain. And our biggest organ on the human body is our skin, so why don’t we use it?\n\nSide note:\n\nThey tap their hands while communicating.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHailey nods emphatically, then signs:\n\nHAYLEY BROADWAY:\n\nWell, a hug is a way to come together and really feel warmth from another human being. But, you know, sometimes you get a hug from someone and they lean over awkwardly, their feet are really far away from you, they’re leaning kind of back or they give you an awkward pat. That conveys so much information. So, there’s a soul-to-soul connection that can happen through touch also.\n\nHAYLEY BROADWAY:\n\nTouch oftentimes is a fleeting sense for a lot of hearing/sighted people and what we want to do is broaden our tactile reach so we’re not just getting in touch with things and then disconnecting two seconds later. We’re really touching something. What is its texture? What is its temperature? What is its shape? So that we can really know those objects and then those can be encoded into Protactile language because they originate from a place of feeling.\n\nSide note:\n\nPiano music plays.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn a sketch, two hands move apart.\n\nText on screen:\n\n“Distantism.”\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER (VO):\n\nProtactile is more than a language; it’s a philosophy and a movement, the antidote to what DeafBlind historian, scholar, and poet John Lee Clark has termed distantism,\n\nROBERTO CABRERA:\n\nHow do we know that people even are around us? We don’t if they don’t touch us because everything is designed for visual and auditory modes. And that is distantism at its finest.\n\nHAYLEY BROADWAY:\n\nJohn Lee Clark talks about autonomy in that distantism context. For many, many years, DeafBlind people were raised with a lack of autonomy because any time they were in a family environment, going to the doctor, or going into school environments, things were done for us. And what that did was prevented us from getting first-hand experiences and figuring out our own sense of embodied experience in the world.\n\nJELICA NUNCIO:\n\nFor example, if we’re going to touch this pillow, we’re going to do it together. I’m not going to grab it and then hand it to you; You are going to be reaching with me in copresence. Copresence is an concept in Protactile movement because we have power imbalances that occur if we’re not in touch and sharing information directly.\n\nOn screen:\n\nRebecca pats Jelica’s thigh.\n\nJELICA NUNCIO:\n\nPeople will also sometimes do things for us and then say, “Here you go, I’m behaving in a way that’s empowering.” But, you know, we don’t need you to empower us; we have power.\n\nROBERTO CABRERA:\n\nAnd of course, people, they are not sure where to start with touching. Most people feel very nervous about this. But they can start with our shoulders. It is a very simple and safe place that is appropriate to touch. And just that one small cue is the first step away from distantism.\n\nText on screen:\n\nRelying on Touch.\n\nOn screen:\n\nRebecca, in a red blouse and grey jacket:\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nWhat happened the night that I was invited to dinner to the Protactile (or PT) house was a profound experience for me. They were having tacos that night and invited me to join. Cameras weren’t allowed and I said, “I gotta go.” And when I got there, it was completely dark, because of course; they don’t rely on vision or hearing to navigate.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAn animation, the door to the grey house opens to blackness.\n\nSide note:\n\nThe animated door creaks as it opens.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nAnd I realized that I could see absolutely nothing. I also realized that I was able to hear and being able to hear put me at a disadvantage if I was trying to learn a language that was based in touch. So I took my cochlear implants off and I joined them completely deaf and blind in this completely DeafBlind world. I was given a tour of the entire house based on touch and it was so interesting to experience the whole house not based on what it looked like, but what it felt like.\n\nOn screen:\n\nAn animated hand reaches forward in the darkness. A bottle appears.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nHaving to eat tacos with them and figure out how to make it all work and not be able to communicate what I needed by using my voice, nothing other than touch, well, how do you communicate when you have messy taco fingers? When I was getting ready to leave, my friend Lesley signed on my chest and it felt like she was tracing the shape of like a semicircle from my left shoulder to my right shoulder and I didn’t understand. So I asked her in tactile sign, what does that mean? And she was saying goodbye to me. She was telling me that she was smiling, that she was happy to have been with me, and because I couldn’t see her smiling, she was letting me know by…\n\nOn screen:\n\nTracing a curve across her chest.\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nIt was such a vulnerable and incredible experience, certainly not something I think a sighted/hearing person would ever think of or even feel comfortable with.\n\nOn screen:\n\nRebecca with Jelica and Roberto:\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\nLast question about, how you, you, respond to hearing/sighted people…\n\nOn screen:\n\nJelica and Roberto turn to an interpreter. Rebecca voices:\n\nREBECCA ALEXANDER:\n\n…hearing/sighted people who say when you teach a DeafBlind child to rely on their touch and to really develop their own form of communication, you ostracize them further from being able to participate with the rest of the world. What are your thoughts about this?\n\nOn screen:\n\nJelica turns to Rebecca and replies. Rebecca and Roberto hold their hands over Jelica’s.\n\nJELICA NUNCIO:\n\nSo, I think the key here isn’t just to think about the children need Protactile, but anyone in our world who wants to interact with people who are DeafBlind need Protactile. I mean sure, you could say that the world is hearing and sighted, but DeafBlind community is a minority community, as are many other communities and it’s not always on the backs of the minority communities to assimilate to hearing/sighted norms. We don’t want to think about the fact that the community is centered around DeafBlind people. It’s not; it’s a community centered around touch, around Protactile norms and anyone can adopt those Protactile norms. The families are adopting these norms, friends are adopting these norms so that we can all share in tactile space together.\n\nWe go to restaurants and they bring a cup to the table, they touch the cup to my hand or to the DeafBlind child’s hand instead of putting a cup on the table and not touching me. And I knock it right over because I don’t even know that it’s there. So again, Protactile’s for everyone. You don’t have to assimilate because the world isn’t a stationary place; that’s just decided upon by those in the majority. The world is an ecliptic place where we all can share and figure out how to share together in a modality that we can jointly connect in.\n\nOn screen:\n\nHailey and Roberto hug Rebecca. Both interpreters join in the group hug. Everyone smiles. Fade to black.\n\nText on screen:\n\nCredits:\n\nProduced and Directed by Mary McDonagh Murphy.\n\nProduced and Edited by Kerri Lee Green.\n\nSide note:\n\nLaughter roars from somewhere.\n\nOn screen:\n\nIn an outtake, Rebecca, Hailey, and Roberto place their hands on the film clapper.\n\nCREW 1:\n\nOK, now hit it.\n\nOn screen:\n\nThey clap the arm down together:\n\nCREW 2:\n\nDo it.\n\nText on screen:\n\nNarrator Rebecca Alexander.

everything is up in airspace.\n\nREBECCA (VO): 70 percent.\n\nImagine receiving only one third of what someone is trying to convey to you.\n\nJELICA: So instead, what we use in Protactile is a four-handed grammar.\n\nWe're articulating onto the body of our interlocutor, and now, more and more Protactile words are coming into their own.\n\nWe're not borrowing ASL words as much as we did in the beginning.\n\nASL signs derive from a visual environment and we want to be articulating what we're feeling.\n\nHow something feels is very different than how something looks.\n\nREBECCA: So for example, ASL sign for dog.\n\nThere's two different signs: first, dog like, scratching the ear, second is dog.\n\nProtactile sign for dog is this because when you feel it, it feels like what the head of a dog feels like.\n\nThis is the Protactile sign for dog.\n\n[euphoric music] REBECCA (VO): Jelica works closely with Hayley Broadway and Roberto Cabrera.\n\nWe sat in circle to have this discussion.\n\nProtactile is especially groundbreaking because it allows DeafBlind people the opportunity to communicate in a group.\n\nHAYLEY: The way that we're set up here in this Protactile three-way allows us all to know not only that we're all three in conversation with one another, but also where we each are in space and what each of us is experiencing at the same time.\n\nWe're all sharing at the knees, not the eyes and face, which is a hallmark of ASL, but the knees and the hands and the legs.\n\nREBECCA (VO): Hayley and her brother both have Usher syndrome and were raised by hearing parents who learned how to sign to communicate with them.\n\nShe is a Protactile instructor for DeafBlind children and their families.\n\nRoberto is third-generation DeafBlind and a vocational rehabilitation counselor and teacher for people who are deaf and DeafBlind.\n\nROBERTO: The way we're arranged is so that we can share information, we can have a natural, organic conversation.\n\nThat's why we're established the way we are.\n\nAnd we set up information to be shared on a variety of sources.\n\nIt could be on your forearm, it could be on your thigh, it could be on your shoulder.\n\nIt really depends on how you want to express the information being shared and reciprocate that.\n\n♪ ♪ REBECCA: So, you know, in the hearing world, there's a saying that the eyes are the windows to the soul.\n\nHow do you feel about touch the way that hearing people have that saying?\n\nROBERTO: Touch will tell you a thousand words.\n\nI mean you look at a picture and that tells you a thousand words but really touch, it has energy, it has emotion.\n\nEverything is right here at our fingertips.\n\nI mean there is so much you can obtain.\n\nAnd our biggest organ on the human body is our skin, so why don't we use it?\n\n[hands tapping] HAYLEY: Well, a hug is a way to come together and really feel warmth from another human being.\n\nBut, you know, sometimes you get a hug from someone and they lean over awkwardly, their feet are really far away from you, they're leaning kind of back or they give you an awkward pat.\n\nThat conveys so much information.\n\nSo, there's a soul-to-soul connection that can happen through touch also.\n\nTouch oftentimes is a fleeting sense for a lot of hearing/sighted people and what we want to do is broaden our tactile reach so we're not just getting in touch with things and then disconnecting two seconds later.\n\nWe're really touching something.\n\nWhat is its texture?\n\nWhat is its temperature?\n\nWhat is its shape?\n\nSo that we can really know those objects and then those can be encoded into Protactile language because they originate from a place of feeling.\n\n[piano music] REBECCA (VO): Protactile is more than a language; it's a philosophy and a movement, the antidote to what DeafBlind historian, scholar, and poet John Lee Clark has termed distantism, ROBERTO: How do we know that people even are around us?\n\nWe don't if they don't touch us because everything is designed for visual and auditory modes.\n\nAnd that is distantism at its finest.\n\nHAYLEY: John Lee Clark talks about autonomy in that distantism context.\n\nFor many, many years, DeafBlind people were raised with a lack of autonomy because any time they were in a family environment, going to the doctor, or going into school environments, things were done for us.\n\nAnd what that did was prevented us from getting first-hand experiences and figuring out our own sense of embodied experience in the world.\n\nJELICA: For example, if we're going to touch this pillow, we're going to do it together.\n\nI'm not going to grab it and then hand it to you; You are going to be reaching with me in copresence.\n\nCopresence is an concept in Protactile movement because we have power imbalances that occur if we're not in touch and sharing information directly.\n\nPeople will also sometimes do things for us and then say, \"Here you go, I'm behaving in a way that's empowering.\"\n\nBut, you know, we don't need you to empower us; we have power.\n\nROBERTO: And of course, people, they are not sure where to start with touching.\n\nMost people feel very nervous about this.\n\nBut they can start with our shoulders.\n\nIt is a very simple and safe place that is appropriate to touch.\n\nAnd just that one small cue is the first step away from distantism.\n\n♪ ♪ REBECCA: What happened the night that I was invited to dinner to the Protactile (or PT) house was a profound experience for me.\n\nThey were having tacos that night and invited me to join.\n\nCameras weren't allowed and I said, \"I gotta go.\"\n\nAnd when I got there, it was completely dark, because of course; they don't rely on vision or hearing to navigate.\n\n[door creaking] And I realized that I could see absolutely nothing.\n\nI also realized that I was able to hear and being able to hear put me at a disadvantage if I was trying to learn a language that was based in touch.\n\nSo I took my cochlear implants off and I joined them completely deaf and blind in this completely DeafBlind world.\n\nI was given a tour of the entire house based on touch and it was so interesting to experience the whole house not based on what it looked like, but what it felt like.\n\nHaving to eat tacos with them and figure out how to make it all work and not be able to communicate what I needed by using my voice, nothing other than touch, well, how do you communicate when you have messy taco fingers?\n\nWhen I was getting ready to leave, my friend Lesley signed on my chest and it felt like she was tracing the shape of like a semicircle from my left shoulder to my right shoulder and I didn't understand.\n\nSo I asked her in tactile sign, what does that mean?\n\nAnd she was saying goodbye to me.\n\nShe was telling me that she was smiling, that she was happy to have been with me, and because I couldn't see her smiling, she was letting me know by...\n\nIt was such a vulnerable and incredible experience, certainly not something I think a sighted/hearing person would ever think of or even feel comfortable with.\n\nLast question about, how you, you, respond to hearing/sighted people... hearing/sighted people who say when you teach a DeafBlind child to rely on their touch and to really develop their own form of communication, you ostracize them further from being able to participate with the rest of the world.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about this?\n\nJELICA: So, I think the key here isn't just to think about the children need Protactile, but anyone in our world who wants to interact with people who are DeafBlind need Protactile.\n\nI mean sure, you could say that the world is hearing and sighted, but DeafBlind community is a minority community, as are many other communities and it's not always on the backs of the minority communities to assimilate to hearing/sighted norms.\n\nWe don't want to think about the fact that the community is centered around DeafBlind people.\n\nIt's not; it's a community centered around touch, around Protactile norms and anyone can adopt those Protactile norms.\n\nThe families are adopting these norms, friends are adopting these norms so that we can all share in tactile space together.\n\nWe go to restaurants and they bring a cup to the table, they touch the cup to my hand or to the DeafBlind child's hand instead of putting a cup on the table and not touching me.\n\nAnd I knock it right over because I don't even know that it's there.\n\nSo again, Protactile's for everyone.\n\nYou don't have to assimilate because the world isn't a stationary place; that's just decided upon by those in the majority.\n\nThe world is an ecliptic place where we all can share and figure out how to share together in a modality that we can jointly connect in.\n\n[hands patting] [laughter] CREW 1: OK, now hit it.\n\nCREW 2: Do it.\n\n[clank] [laughter] ♪ ♪"
