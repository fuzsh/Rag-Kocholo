        "text": "Jam Along with Your Favorite Online Music Streamed from Your Smartphone\n\nGO:KEYS is a fun, easy-to-use keyboard that lets you play along with your favorite music—streamed wirelessly through its powerful onboard speakers. Just connect your smartphone via Bluetooth®, pick a song, and play along! And with sound quality that beats most standalone Bluetooth speakers, GO:KEYS is great for just listening to music too.\n\nGO:KEYS uses your smartphone to access free online musical content, so you’ll never run out of songs to play along with. You can also work with dedicated apps that teach you how to play the latest songs or classical pieces, or get vocal with some karaoke. And when you’re ready to start creating your own music, the built-in Loop Mix function lets you jam with over 500 pro-quality onboard sounds. Compact, portable, and battery-powered, GO:KEYS can be played wherever you get the urge. A world of music is waiting for you—start the journey with GO:KEYS!\n\nStandard Features\n\nPlay Along with Your Favorite Songs\n\nGO:KEYS is a fun, easy-to-use keyboard that lets you play along with your favorite music—streamed wirelessly through its powerful onboard speakers.\n\nStart Creating Cool Music with GO:KEYS\n\nAll music heard on this video was made by people trying the LOOP MIX function of the GO:KEYS.\n\nPlaying Along with a Smartphone\n\nCompact and battery powered, GO:KEYS lets you enjoy the magic of musical creativity everywhere you go.\n\nHave Fun With Music — No Experience Necessary\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun and inspiring way to start playing music, Roland’s GO:KEYS is the answer!\n\nConnect Wirelessly to Your Smartphone and Jam with Your Favorite Music\n\nThe Bluetooth functionality in GO:KEYS makes it simple to connect wirelessly with your smartphone or tablet and get more from your new keyboard. Call up favorite songs from your music library, and access unlimited free online music content from piano lessons to karaoke. Whatever you choose, you can play along as the audio streams wirelessly through the high-quality onboard speakers, or simply sit back and enjoy the music. With GO:KEYS and a smartphone, you’ve got everything you need to practice or perform. And when you’re ready to step up to more advanced music production, GO:KEYS is a perfect partner for MIDI recording in popular apps like GarageBand and many others.\n\nSet Up Fast and Save Space in Your Home\n\nA full-sized acoustic piano just isn’t feasible for many homes. But thanks to GO:KEYS’s compact and lightweight design, there’s nothing to stop you from creating music, even when space is at a premium. Switch on your keyboard, connect to your smartphone, and you’re ready to start playing, with no lengthy setup or untidy wiring. The onboard Bluetooth speakers are ideal for performance, but when you need to dial down the decibels for quieter play, GO:KEYS lets you plug in headphones and keep the fun rolling.\n\nPlay Music Anywhere with Battery Power and a Wireless Smartphone Connection\n\nWhen inspiration strikes, you’ll always be ready to react with GO:KEYS. It’s compact enough to throw in a carry bag, while six AA batteries supply all the power you need to play music anywhere, from camping trips to tour buses. And with no wires to slow you down, it’s fast and easy to use with content from your smartphone, so you can always work on your music, even when you’re on the move.\n\nEven Beginners Can Create Pro Music with Loop Mix\n\nNo musical knowledge? No problem with GO:KEYS. Even if you’re playing a keyboard for the first time, the Loop Mix function lets you start creating cool music right away. Unlike other keyboards that have accompaniment features that require chord basics, Loop Mix is a fresh approach that even beginners can enjoy. By triggering loop phrases using single keys, anyone can create polished songs in real time. Drums, bass, and other instruments are easy to add to the mix, and the performance pads let you manipulate sounds like a DJ by adjusting pitch, filtering, and more. And with the onboard recorder, you can capture it all for immediate playback and sharing.\n\nInspire Your Songwriting with Over 500 Pro-Quality Sounds\n\nEven without a smartphone, GO:KEYS is a versatile instrument in its own right, offering over 500 ready-to-play sounds derived from Roland’s acclaimed pro synthesizers. Use the intuitive category buttons to call up pianos, synths, strings, brass, and more, and then incorporate them into your Loop Mix jams and take your songs to the next level.\n\nCreate High-Quality Videos with Your Smartphone and GO:MIXER\n\nOnce you’ve written a great new song using Loop Mix, you’ll want to share it with the world. Recording videos with your smartphone is easy, but its built-in mic doesn’t always sound so good. By plugging your phone and GO:KEYS into Roland’s cool GO:MIXER, you can directly capture the keyboard’s great sound to your videos while you shoot. You can plug additional sources into GO:MIXER as well, such as a mic or another keyboard. With the combination of your smartphone, GO:KEYS, and GO:MIXER, there’s no simpler way to create pro-quality videos for sharing on social media.\n\nLearn more about GO:MIXER >>\n\nStandard Features\n\nOnboard high-quality Bluetooth speakers for wireless smartphone connection\n\nCompact and lightweight for playing anywhere, at home or outdoors\n\nFully wireless operation with battery power and Bluetooth connectivity\n\nOver 500 pro-quality sounds: pianos, synths, strings, bass, brass, and more\n\nLoop Mix function lets you build songs by simply playing notes on the keyboard\n\nManipulate the sounds of your loops with intuitive one-touch control\n\nBluetooth MIDI support for music production apps on your smartphone or tablet\n\nBuilt-in song recorder with USB backup\n\nPlay anytime with built-in speakers or headphones\n\nKeyboard\n\nNumber of Keys\n\n61 keys (Ivory Feel and Box-shape Keys with velocity)\n\nTouch Sensitivity\n\nKey Touch: 3 types, fixed touch\n\nSound Generator\n\nMaximum Polyphony\n\n128 voices\n\nParts\n\n16 parts (Keyboard play: 8 parts, LOOP MIX: 8 parts)\n\nMIDI Format\n\nConforms to GM2\n\nNumber of Tones\n\n554 tones\n\n*GM2 compatible sounds are included.\n\nEffects\n\nMulti-Effects / Chorus / Reverb\n\n*Only Reverb level is adjustable.\n\nMaster Tuning\n\n415.3 Hz–466.2 Hz (adjustable in increments of 0.1 Hz)\n\nTranspose\n\n-5–+6 (in semitones)\n\nOctave Shift\n\n-3–+3\n\nSampling Frequency\n\n44.1 kHz\n\nLoop Mix\n\nLoop Mix Set\n\n22 sets\n\nNumber of Patterns\n\n1,232 patterns (22 sets x 56 patterns)\n\nChord\n\nInteractive Chord function\n\nTempo\n\nQuarter note = 5–300\n\nPerformance Pad\n\nNumber of Pads\n\n10 (5 x 2)\n\nFunction\n\nBender: Pitch Bend / Modulation\n\nEffect: Roll / Filter\n\nRecorder\n\nSave Format\n\nStandard MIDI Files (Format 0)\n\nSong Storage\n\n99 songs (within the limits of Note Storage)\n\nNote Storage\n\nApprox. 30,000 notes\n\nTempo\n\nQuarter note = 5–300\n\nResolution\n\n96 ticks per quarter note\n\nBluetooth\n\nBluetooth Ver 4.2\n\nProfile Support: A2DP(Audio), GATT(MIDI over Bluetooth Low Energy)\n\nCodec: SBC (Support to the content protection of the SCMS-T method)\n\n*This function is not available for GO-61KL.\n\nOther\n\nDisplay\n\nCustom LCD (with backlit)\n\nAmplifier Power Output\n\n2.5 W x 2\n\nSpeakers\n\n12 x 6 cm (4-3/4 x 2-3/8 inches) x 2\n\nConnectors\n\nPHONES/OUTPUT jack: Stereo miniature phone type\n\nAUX IN jack: Stereo miniature phone type\n\nPEDAL jack: 1/4-inch phone type\n\nUSB COMPUTER port: USB Micro-B type (MIDI)\n\nDC IN jack\n\nPower Supply\n\nAC adaptor or Alkaline battery (AA, LR6) / Rechargeable Ni-MH battery (AA, HR6) x 6\n\n*Carbon-zinc batteries cannot be used.\n\nCurrent Draw\n\n1,000 mA\n\nBattery Life for Continuous Use\n\nRechargeable Ni-MH batteries (AA, HR6): Approximately 6 hours\n\nAlkaline batteries (AA, LR6): Approximately 4 hours\n\n*This figure will vary depending on the actual conditions of use.\n\nAccessories\n\nOwner's manual\n\nLeaflet \"USING THE UNIT SAFELY\"\n\nAC adaptor\n\n*Music rest not included.\n\nOptions (sold separately)\n\nKeyboard stand: KS-13\n\nPedal switch: DP series\n\nSize and Weight\n\nWidth\n\n877 mm\n\n34-9/16 inches\n\nDepth\n\n271 mm\n\n10-11/16 inches\n\nHeight\n\n82 mm\n\n3-1/4 inches\n\nWeight (excluding AC adaptor)\n\n3.9 kg\n\n8 lbs 10 oz\n\n<% for (var i=0,len=images.length; i <% } %>\n\nVideo Library\n\nGO:KEYS: Have Fun With Music - No Experience Necessary\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun and inspiring way to start playing music, Roland’s GO:KEYS is the answer!\n\nThe Complete Beginner’s Guide to Piano\n\nInterested in learning piano but don’t know where to begin?
