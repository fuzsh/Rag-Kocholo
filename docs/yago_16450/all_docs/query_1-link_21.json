        "text": "In a pasture in Kansas one early spring morn\n\nA horse quite unlike other horses was born.\n\nHis coat was coal black so they named the horse “Blackie,”\n\nAnd before very long folks found out he was wacky!\n\nMeet Blackie, the stubbornly motionless equine hero of Christopher Cerf and Paige Peterson’s delightful and touching biography-in-verse, Blackie, The Horse Who Stood Still.\n\nSee, most colts are frisky but Blackie was not.\n\nBlackie liked standing still! Yes, he liked it a lot!\n\n“What’s the hurry?” thought Blackie. “There’s so much to see\n\nStanding here in the shade of a juniper tree…..\n\nThis (mostly) true tale tells the heart-warming story of a horse who made standing stock-still a lifelong endeavor—while becoming a champion rodeo horse, a tourist favorite at Yosemite Park, a legendary environmental crusader, and the beloved mascot of one of America’s most beautiful towns, Tiburon, California, on the shores of San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe word quickly spread ‘bout the new horse in town\n\nAnd from all ‘round the county young kids headed down\n\nTo the pasture where Blackie could always be found\n\nStanding still, like a rock, on the same patch of ground.\n\nMagically illustrated by Peterson’s lyrical paintings, Blackie is destined to become a children’s classic in the tradition of Munro Leaf’s Ferdinand the Bull and Dr. Seuss’s The Lorax, The playful, clever, rhyming text will charm adults and children alike as it delivers an important message about appreciating and preserving the natural beauty around us.\n\n“What a beautiful place!” Blackie thought when they got there,\n\n“I simply can’t wait just to stand in one spot there\n\nAnd watch a gull soar, or a tree gently sway,\n\nOr the fog rolling in from the hills ‘cross the bay…\n\nAbout The Author\n\nChristopher Cerf is an author, composer-lyricist, record and television producer, editor, and cofounder and president of the educational television production company, Sirius Thinking, Ltd. Since its first season in 1970, Cerf has played a pivotal role in the creation and production of the \"Sesame Street\" television program, most notably as a regular contributor of music and lyrics.

Blackie stands still, knows the value of observation and reflection, of being in the world, not always acting upon it. Children innately know this, too. Parents, read with your children about this horse who will help you preserve in their up-bringing a necessary environment of calm.\"\n\n-Owen Lewis, M.D., Child Psychiatrist\n\n\"Blackie is a beautiful and touching story, told in rhyme by Chris Cerf and Paige Peterson. Unforgettable as the tale is, the artwork by Ms. Peterson is even more so. Long after you've read the book, you will remember the stunning pictures, illustrating the events of Blackie's life.

This charming book brought back wonderful memories of him standing as a living landmark in his pasture - a beacon signifying HOME - every day for our family. Can't wait to share it with our grown 'kids' and our nine grandchildren, too. What a lovely and touching gift 'Blackie' will be for all of us!!!\"\n\n-Drue and Arthur Gensler, Founders of GENSLER\n\n\"Paige Peterson's paintings remind me of the joy of art.

I think I'll read it to her anyway!\n\n-Ken Auletta\n\n\"Growing up on the Tiburon peninsula, Blackie the horse was part of my community. In their delightful book, Christopher Cerf and Paige Peterson not only recreate the true story of an amazing animal, they capture the magic that every child felt seeing Blackie's stoic silhouette in the pasture. It's a wonderful story about a special horse that helped define a community.\"\n\n-Kate Kelly, Newscaster, CBS-5 San Francisco\n\n\"This charming and sweet tale celebrates the life lived with deliberate tranquility -- a life that resists the enticements of bustle and business.

A brilliant little book that elegantly honors a horse who every reader will empathize with.\"\n\n-Douglas Leeds, President, American Theater Wing\n\n\"Blackie is such a perfect interweaving of Cerf's warm, unfussy lyricism and Peterson's simple, elegant, deep-and-wide paintings - the warm narrative playing lightly against a backdrop of bold colors and unexpected compositions of ears and eyes, shoes and sky. A totally charming naivete pervades the sweetness of the storytelling.\"\n\n-Fred Newman, Actor, \"A Prairie Home Companion\"\n\n\"I can't wait to read this book to my children. It's wonderfully heart-warming and lyrical, a beautifully rendered and lovingly told story for those of us not resigned to following the pack! Bravo!\"\n\n-Gavin Spanierman, Spanierman Gallery\n\n\"Blackie represents a wonderful coming together of Chris Cerf's lilting rhythm and rhyme and Paige Peterson's charming and touching illustrations. This tale should appeal to people of all ages, and reminds us once again that time passes so fast that we must force ourselves to slow down and smell the roses when we can. Blackie is a winner.\"\n\n-Jade Albert, Photographer\n\n\"With Blackie, Chris Cerf and Paige Peterson have written a beautiful book that brings a smile to my face and a tear to my eye. And make no mistake, while it has the look of a children's book, its message is right for all ages. I highly recommend Blackie for young and old alike.\"\n\n-Drew Casertano, Headmaster, Millbrook School\n\n\"A charming children’s book that can teach us all about the delight of simply standing still.\"\n\n-Eden Collinsworth, Author\n\n\"A great artist it seems to me captures not just a subject but a particularly telling moment in the subject's life. As Picasso said, 'I paint to find out what I think.' Discovering what Paige Peterson thinks is always interesting indeed.\"\n\n-Nancy Collins, Architectural Digest\n\n\"Paige Peterson and Chris Cerf have created a heartfelt classic illustrated story about a real life horse Blackie and his lifelong career of standing still. But it is so much more than that. In its sophistication, Blackie cannot be classified as strictly a children’s book. It is funny, it is goofy, it is intelligent and entertaining and it had me in tears. The rhyming text by Cerf and Peterson and the quirky paintings by Petersen combine to create a well spun tale that appeals to all ages can and starts a conversation about commitment and convictions in a manner that kids can understand and any parent would enjoy having with their children.\"\n\n-Frank Lupo, Painter\n\n\"I loved the book and plan to incorporate it into my lectures as a symbol of standing still and not trying to make things happen. The illustrations are spectacular–simple, clean, but evocative.\"\n\n-Allan J. Hamilton, MD, FACS, Professor of Neurosurgery\n\n\"The spirit of BLACKIE is forever summoned through the magical words of Christopher Cerf and enchanting illustrations of Paige Peterson.\"\n\n-Mindy Marin, Movie Producer\n\n\"It is amazing that someone as active as Paige Peterson can so ably depict the virtues of standing still. She is without question a multi-faceted and multi-talented person. Her sweet illustrations are a pleasing complement to Chris Cerf’s presentation of a simple but meaningful story. What many readers of Blackie: The Horse Who Stood Still may not know is that our energetic Paige is always moving in pursuit of support for the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. To put it simply and meaningfully, we are in awe of her talents and creativity.\"\n\n-Jon M. Huntsman, Founder, Huntsman Cancer Institute"
