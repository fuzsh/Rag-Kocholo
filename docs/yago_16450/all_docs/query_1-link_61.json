        "text": "Steinway Artists\n\nWithout them, a Steinway piano is silent. But together, the artist and piano create music — such beautiful music that most professional pianists choose to perform only on Steinway pianos.\n\nFor decades Steinway & Sons has cultivated special relationships with pianists from every genre. From classical pianists like Lang Lang, to jazz stars like Diana Krall, to pop icons like Billy Joel, to \"immortals\" like Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Arthur Rubinstein — more than 1,600 artists make the Steinway their own."
