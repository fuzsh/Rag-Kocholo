Then one day this St. Jude Hero had an epiphany.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nS2E2: Dean Troutman, supporter\n\nAge is just a number. In Dean Troutman’s case, that number is 90. The age at which he set out to walk 3600 miles, alone, to raise money and awareness for St. Jude. When things didn’t go according to plan, it looked like Troutman’s Trek would be cut short. But help came from unexpected quarters.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nS2E1: The Solomons, bereaved family and supporters\n\nNothing prepared the Solomons for the loss of their firstborn Joshua to inoperable brain cancer. They found strength and purpose and establishing a non-profit that gives annually to St. Jude’s brain tumor program, helping other families facing some of the same struggles they did.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nS2E3: Julie Wurl, supporter\n\nJulie Wurl worked at an adult oncology center, so she understood how cancer affects families. But listening to a Country Cares for St. Jude Kids Radiothon literally moved her to tears — and to hand-deliver a donation. It was only the beginning for her. Julie’s now the volunteer coordinator for radiothons throughout Wisconsin.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nS2E4: Lindsay Walter, supporter\n\nLindsay Walter wasn’t a St. Jude patient, but she could relate to part of what pediatric cancer patients face. She’s bald. Not because of the effects of cancer treatment, but a condition called alopecia. A wig covered her baldness but didn’t help her self-confidence. Then one day this St. Jude Hero had an epiphany.\n\nKindness\n\nWe're grateful for: The Velasquez family, who works to improve the health of a city that once saved their son\n\nPedro Velasquez’s treatment at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital was not easy; oncologists on the Memphis campus would spend two and a half years trying to eradicate the aggressive T-cell variation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia he had.\n\nKindness\n\nWe're grateful for: Bianca, a teen who raised money to help kids with cancer after St. Jude Children's Research Hospital treated her brother\n\nBianca's little brother Beckett was diagnosed with leukemia and treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital when he was 9. He was too young to know what that meant, but 13-year-old Bianca did.\n\nKindness\n\nWe’re grateful for: Lorenzo Sandlin, a bereaved father who led a community crusade for St. Jude\n\nLorenzo Sandlin arrived at O’Neal Elementary School in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, more than three decades ago with a passion for education and a love of “trying to help children better themselves.”\n\nKindness\n\nWe’re grateful for: Tina Marshall, who helps coordinate St. Jude Sunday of Hope campaigns\n\nTina Marshall is grateful for the example set by parents who went into the community to give back with their eight children in tow. Service was already part of her life when a chance meeting with a grieving father at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital truly connected her to the mission.\n\nKindness\n\nWe are grateful for: Shirley Krcmar who dedicates her life to the St. Jude cause\n\nWhen Danny Thomas took the stage in 1970 in St. Paul, Minnesota, Shirley Krcmar was in the crowd. Her trip for the Epsilon Sigma Alpha international council convention would change the course of her life.\n\nKindness\n\nWe're grateful for: Volunteer Henry Hanten who goes the distance for his favorite cause\n\nThere may be no limit to the lengths Henry Hanten would go to help the kids of St. Jude. But we know the number is north of 50,000 miles.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nAmy, childhood cancer survivor\n\nAmy was a sixth grader whose biggest worry in the world was the next day’s spelling test. Then she was diagnosed with leukemia. After successful treatment, she relapsed as a high schooler. But St. Jude didn’t just give her a second and third chance at life. It gave her a purpose\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nRyan, Brody’s dad\n\nWhen a child is sick, a parent’s instinct is to do something — anything — to help. That was especially true for Ryan, a first responder in his professional life. When his son, Brody, was diagnosed with leukemia, Ryan felt helpless. So he put his trust in St. Jude.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nJillian, Alexander’s mom\n\nWhen a child is diagnosed with cancer, the whole family’s life is upended. That’s how it was for Jillian when her son Alexander was treated at St. Jude for a cancerous brain tumor. She had to learn to release control. Only then could she master the minute-by-minute life of a cancer mom.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nBrittney, Ashtyn’s mom\n\nA pediatric cancer diagnosis is devastating, but in that moment families also have crucial decisions to make — including where to seek treatment. When Brittney and Kiara, moms to 5-year-old Ashtyn, couldn’t agree whether to stay home or uproot the family, they asked for a sign.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nQuinton, Quincy’s dad\n\nFor many patients, the toughest part of treatment is losing their hair. It’s that moment when they tell the world: I have cancer. But as Quincy braced for that side effect of chemotherapy, his dad, Quinton, found a way to make being bald not so bad, after all.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nJanine, Marina’s mom\n\nJanine felt scared and alone. Her 2-year-old daughter Marina had been diagnosed with retinoblastoma. But then mom felt the human touch of St. Jude, a place where healing comes with hope — and hugs. Suddenly, the fear left Janine and she could focus on what truly mattered.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nTekia, Dallas’ mom\n\nDallas has been through a lot, from the death of his father to the tumor on his back to the bullying he faced because of his condition. So St. Jude was more than a place for medical treatment. It was a place to feel safe, to find moments of joy — joy that Dallas radiates back to everyone he meets.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nNadine, Braxton’s mom\n\nBeing a mom isn’t easy in the best of times. So imagine all the usual roles and responsibilities, plus having a child with cancer. When Braxton was diagnosed with a brain tumor, Nadine found solace at St. Jude, where she found herself part of a whole new family.\n\nSt. Jude Soundbites\n\nRob, Ava’s dad\n\nYour life is good. No, your life is great. Then your daughter is diagnosed with medulloblastoma — brain cancer — and everything is different. When Rob’s daughter was treated at St. Jude, he didn’t just get Ava back.
