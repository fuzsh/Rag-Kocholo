        "text": "Difficulty: Average\n\nHave you ever wanted to abandon your chaotic life and move to the wilderness? That is exactly what Sam Gribley does when his dad gives him permission to leave his family's crowded New York City apartment and live on his great-grandfather's long unused hill farm, deep in the Catskill Mountains.\n\nThis is the story of Sam's survival and maturation during that long and wonderful year alone in the mountains. We meet Sam's peregrine falcon, Frightful, who has known only Sam as a parent figure since he captured her from her nest. Through his journal, Sam introduces us to Jesse Coon James and Baron Weasel, and his other wild animals friends. Sam steers clear of most people, except for visits from the mysterious Bando and trips to the local library to read up on roughing it.\n\nLearn how Sam makes a home in the giant hollowed-out hemlock tree, hunts with Frightful for meat, and discovers the delicious, and not-so-delicious wild plants that keep him alive during his adventure.\n\nBest of all, the last page of this book is not the end of the story! Jean Craighead George has given us two sequels: ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN (1990) and FRIGHTFUL'S MOUNTAIN (1999)."
