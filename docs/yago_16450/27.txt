âBob and Connie are astoundingly talented! They take the time to get to know you. The setting, lighting, poses, furniture and every aspect of the portrait are very personalized. Â They perfectly captured our personalities. Â The result is sublime. Beyond the gorgeous photography, they carefully allowed us to choose the frame, recommended the company to install it in our home, came to the installation, and supervised every detail from the moment we walked in their door until the portrait hung in our home. Â The portrait they created is a treasure that brings us pleasure every day. We receive compliments on it constantly, and we know that our family loves it. Â Thank you Bob and Connie!â

Masters Touch Highlights

1. We are Master Portrait Artists

We specialize in classical, timeless portraits in the style of the old masters. Through the years the expertise needed to create classic portraits has become rare. We appreciate the importance and value of the classical style and have many years of experience creating these heirloom portraits that withstand the test of time.

2. Lavish Hand Artistry

A Masters Touch portrait blends the realism of modern portrait techniques with the distinct richness of an oil painting. We use an old world technology to create an original piece of art for each client. Once your portrait has been printed to the highest standards, it is then turned over to one of our renowned artists. Each Masters Touch portrait (30" and larger) are enhanced with several layers of hand painted oil-based artistry and embellished with acrylic brushstrokes to bring out the most subtle details. One cannot help but notice how the artist carefully awakens each highlight of the portrait to its fullest beauty and granduer, rendering it similar to an exquisite oil painting.

3. Masterpiece Canvas Finish

The rich canvas finish of your Masters Touch portrait is unmistakable. After all artistry is applied to your portrait, it is then printed using a fine art process developed by world renowned printmaker Jack Duganne that results in the highest museum quality photographic reproduction available. Your portrait is created with fade-resistant archival inks, ensuring heirloom longevity.

4. Beautifully Finished Gold-Leaf Frames

Many so-called custom frames are simply 'chop and join' - premade frame sticks that consist of moulding pieces. The result is a flat generic finish with a visible line in the corners of the frame. A Masters Touch frame however, is built here in the United States by master craftsmen, in the old-fashioned artisan tradition. Each frame takes approximately 6 weeks to build from scratch, and are beautiful furniture-quality finished corner frames with a gold leaf finish. Decorative leafs are added to each corner to further add beauty and detail. Individuals who are connoisseurs of art wil immediately recognize your attention to detail in framing your portrait. Frames included at no additional charge on 30" and larger Masters Touch Portraits.

5. 22 Karat Gold Hand Engraved Nameplates

A 22 kt. gold nameplate is like a beautiful piece of jewelry for your frame, and one is included with each frame that we complete. This prestigious detail provides a finishing touch of authenticity to your portrait.

6. Extreme Protection

Though protective lacquer is applied throughout the creation of your portrait, when all artistry is done, a minimum of four more layers is administered. This step goes the extra mile in providing necessary UV protection as well as to help guard the portrait from damages caused by external sources. You may occasionally wish to clean your portrait with Windex and a soft cotton cloth. Note: Never try this on any portrait that is not protected like a Masters Touch portrait.

7. Lifetime Guarantee

When you commission a framed Masters Touch portrait, you not only get the best guarantee in the industry, but you also get an amazing insurance plan. Quite simply, we guarantee your portrait, down to every detail, against all damages. If your portrait is ever harmed in any way whether it be your fault or not, or if it fails to meet your highest standards of quality, we will replace it at no charge.
