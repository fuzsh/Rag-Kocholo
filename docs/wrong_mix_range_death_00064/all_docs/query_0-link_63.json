There are many families that were not written up this year but perhaps those sections can be taken up year after year until we have covered every one, so if your family is not listed herein please allow for another year. All copy was read by each family. The purpose of this is to reminisce a bit as we renew our memories. This Booklet was printed for the sole purpose of earning proceeds for the Utica Fun Day, June 14, 1986\n\nIndex\n\nPage - Family\n\n3 Bloom and McCain\n\n8 Burgett and Davis\n\n14 Clark\n\n18 Crain and Cudgell\n\n24 Dale and Jones\n\n28 Davis\n\n31 Dome and McDonnal\n\n37 Hawkins and Waltz\n\n42 Peterie and Hickman and Boston\n\n49 Hightower and Cosgrove\n\n53 Howerton\n\n59 Kent and Stamper\n\n66 Kohl and Perkins\n\n70 Romeiser\n\n79 Smith (Schmitt), Baltis, Dome,\n\nMounce and Harter\n\n88 Stone\n\n93 Taylor\n\n99 Williams\n\nBloom and McCain Families\n\nElnora Kerschnick married Frederick Bloom\n\nwhile both were residents of Danzig, Germany. In 1859 the Bloom family including Elnora's sister, Flora, and her husband, Uncle Shinogle and their two sons, Gus and Ferninand decided to travel to America. Their trip started from Danzig to Hamburg, Germany by train to board an ocean vessel. The ship sailing through the North Sea and English Channel was crossing the Atlantic Ocean to reach its destination. While enroute an epidemic of smallpox was experienced\n\nand the ship stopped at Crosse Isle to bury the Bloom's two year old daughter, Wilhemina, who had died while traveling. Elnora was quarantined after she contracted the disease. She and her husband were left behind until she was well enough to continue on and unite with the others of her kinfolk.\n\nThey reached Montreal, Canada at a later date and continued on by train to join their family in Detroit, Michigan. Elnora and Frederick took residency in Detroit but Flora and her family continued on South settling in Dawn, Missouri. At Dawn a third child, Tressie, was born to Flora.\n\nWhile Elnora and Frederick were in Detroit, a son, Frederick II was born, after a few years the couple decided to move to Dawn after corresponding with Elnora's sister. After arriving the senior Frederick Bloom was somewhat appointed in what he termed the \"wilderness\" and would have returned to Michigan if he would have had the fare.\n\nFrederick and Elnora raised four children, Frederick II, Mary Ella, Bertha A., and Jennie Caroline. This hard working family with thrifty management of Frederick working for the railroad and local orchards, raising produce for sale and by budgeting and laying aside a portion of all proceeds earned, the Blooms were able to purchase several parcels of land. They built the home that Ralph and Marie McCain now reside in. This was in 1900 and Mr. Bloom died in 1907 and Mrs. Bloom died in 1917. Both were very well respected for their sturdy independence\n\nin earning their livelihood and their honesty.\n\nGeorge and Anna McCain were the parents of Troy, Myrtle, Nelle, Edith and Roe. This family moved from Bloomington, Illinois where they had operated a livery stable. Upon coming to this area they purchased some bottom land and farmed. After a period of time the family moved to the Southern parts except for their son Troy.\n\nTroy McCain remained in Utica and married Jennie Caroline Bloom. Two children were born to them, Jennie Marie and Ralph. Troy like his father, was a farmer and worked at the local orchards.\n\nMarie and Ralph attended school in Utica. Marie attended Chillicothe High School for a few months to obtain proper credits for graduation.\n\nTroy McCain died of a sudden heart attack in his home when Ralph was only twenty-one years old. Ralph continued to farm the family land along with raising Polled China hogs and later registered Hereford cattle. Marie cared for the home and their widowed mother and their Uncle Fred Bloom until their deaths.\n\nRalph met Lois (Counts) through a mutual friend, Rev. Harold Garrett, who pastored the Utica Baptist Church while he was a student at William Jewell College. On June 27, 1961 Ralph and Lois were married by Rev. Garrett at Calvary Baptist Church in Kansas City, Missouri. She recalls on her wedding day she was at the church and was about to walk down the aisle in black patent leather shoes because she hid forgotten\n\nto bring her white ones. Her niece rushed home and arrived just as the bride was about to walk down the aisle.\n\nLois was the youngest of six children born to Frank And Lulu Counts, in Hensen, Missouri. The family moved from Farmington, Missouri in 1922 to Kansas City, Missouri. Frank was a carpenter. During the depression years all the\n\nmembers of the family worked and pooled their earnings. Lois recalled she began to baby-sit\n\nfor twenty-five cents a week at the age of nine years old. She loved children and decided early in life to become a teacher.\n\nLois graduated from Westport High in Kansas City. Her first job was as a file clerk at Kansas City Power and Light Company. During World War II she worked as a secretary at the North American Bomber Plant. She attended the State University of New York in Oswego, New York. She had gone to visit her sister who was then the secretary to the President of the college. Her sister later became a Children's Librarian,\n\nthen a Professor of English at the University.\n\nWhile Lois was in college she was very active in many fields; her favorite being editor of the college newspaper and writing the college news for the local newspaper. She developed an interest in writing human interest stories. Lois received her Bachelor's degree in 1949.\n\nShe returned to Kansas City to teach sixth grade at Martin School in the East Bottoms. It was a neighborhood neglected as far as recreational opportunities for the youth. She became involved with work in the Valley Memorial Baptist Chapel. Then she moved into a little house next to the school and opened it for programs for both young and old. Programs included all scouting programs, wisdom club for the elderly, nursery school, youth clubs, Gra-y clubs for boys, Bible classes, choir practice, and\n\nbasketball and baseball teams.\n\nWhen all was going well the home was vandalized, the calamity became a blessing in disguise because news in the Kansas City Star brought the problem to the attention of the Junior Chamber of Commerce who were looking for a project to undertake. S. R. Brunn of the construction company became interested in the work and volunteered his men and did the majority of the building of a large center. Lois\n\nworked in this area for twelve years and had a sponsor for the work when she left it.\n\nAfter her marriage she returned to Kansas City for a period of six months to help her mother care for her invalid father until his death.\n\nIn 1962 she became a teacher at Field School in Chillicothe and taught fourth through sixth grade until her retirement in 1982.\n\nLois talked about her parent's loyalty to their family and how they worked hard to give their children all of the advantages possible for those hard years of the depression. She recalls the fun they had while she was growing up and how her father taught her to clog dance and the old time jig.\n\nShe put on performances with this dancing in her high school musicals, during war years for the USO, the Bomber Plant noon shows, and in college musicals. She has also performed for the children at Field School.\n\nShe told of her brother, Frank, who died at the age of twenty-one as a result of rheumatic fever, he taught her much about courage, faith, and love. He had a tremendous affect on all members of his family and friends.\n\nShe loves to travel and likes people and civic work. She does slide presentations in the schools and nursing homes and works for her church. She, with the help of other members of the Utica Community Church have had a program for the children of Utica, called CLIA's for the last ten years.\n\nInteresting memorabilia related by Marie is the document that she has in her possession of her grandfather's naturalization papers of 1893, that was witnessed by H. A. Stone and C. J. Hicks, here in Livingston County. She has fond memories of her youthful years in Utica going to school. Many of those that attended with her are still residents of Utica, as of this writing.\n\nMarie laughed while being asked how Lois changed their lives when she and Ralph was married. Her reply was that Lois certainly has\n\nadded much interest to their lives.\n\nMarie does a lot of embroidery work has done and lots of quilting in the past. She still loves to care for her home and does some gardening and canning on a smaller scale that in years past.\n\nRalph is semi-retired but still farms some. He has some livestock. He is a real home-body and does enjoy people. He is always glad to\n\nwelcome \"the boys\" to a game of pool in his basement. His enjoyment is caring for his home and farm land.\n\nWhen he was in school he acted in many plays. He loves to listen to and tell funny stories.\n\nAll three of the McCains are dedicated Christians who are active in their church work. They are certainly a big part of the Utica History through their ancestry and living here all of their lives.\n\nBurgett and Davis Families\n\nJames and Eva Burgett moved from Illinois\n\nto the farming area in the bottoms around Dean Lake, by Grand River, in Chariton County in the early part of 1920. They with their six children farmed from six to seven hundred acres of the bottoms. In those years the farming was done by horses or mules and James and family would own up to thirty head of mules to farm with.\n\nThe children attended the Stephenson Rural School in their elementary grades and high school in Triplett, Missouri.\n\nIt was during these years that Richard and Mary Davis moved from Kentucky to the same area to live and became acquainted with the Burgett family. Richard worked on the levies with a dragline company that traveled doing this kind of construction work. He was an explosive man and was later killed when the dynamite set went off too quickly.\n\nIt was through this relationship that (Jay) Geraldine Burgett and Nathaniel S. (Sam) Davis met. The other children of the Burgetts are Herschel, Dorothy, Helen, Bertha Belle, and Wayne.\n\nHerschel passed away after a long term illness in 1984, leaving a wife and two daughters, four grandchildren, six great-great-grandchildren as of this writing.\n\nDorothy is married to Bob Copenhaver and they live in Independence, Missouri and have one son, Kenneth.\n\nHelen passed away in 1960.\n\nBertha Belle Whitehurst lives in De Soto, Kansas and she has two daughters, five grandchildren, and six great-great grandchildren\n\nas of this writing.\n\nWayne lives in California, he has three daughters.\n\nOf the Burgett family's children, Geraldine (Jay) is the only member left in Utica. She has two children, daughter Eva Boyd of Florida, who has three children, and her son Robert (Bob)\n\nDavis of Flint, Michigan, who has three children.\n\nIn their teen years, Jay and her sister Helen only got to attend two years of high school. Due to the family's financial problems from the flooding and the depression years the family were all needed to help with the farming and gardening in order to survive.\n\nSince Jay was not fond of housework and Helen did not like outside work the arrangement became that Jay was her father's right hand in the fieldwork. In her teens she would work in the fields from sunup to sundown behind a four hitch of mules that she harnessed, hooked up and cared for by herself and than would switch to another\n\nset when the time for resting was necessary.\n\nAfter meeting Sam, Jay remembers her first date, which was to a Dean Lake square dance. They borrowed her father's pickup and took her sister, Dorothy, along with them. The dance became somewhat rowdy but she and Sam did not leave. When they arrived hone late, Dorothy had to tattle all about everything that happened throughout the evening at the dance.\n\nJay's dad was not overly fond of Sam and believed him too old for Jay as she was still a teenager plus the fact that he did not really want her to be dating. After her eighteenth birthday, Jay and Sam ran off and were married. They went to live in Illinois and notified her parents of their marriage.\n\nDue to the severe floods and the decline in land values as well as the economic conditions the Burgetts were forced to move from their farm and to share crop in the Dawn and Ludlow areas. This was in 1935 and the years following were the opposite with severe drought conditions.\n\nAfter Sam and Jay were married for a very short time, Jay's father went to Illinois to move them back to help him farm. They lived in a trailer residence next door to her parents. Here Sam and James Burgett farmed and started a trucking business and a bond grew between them.\n\nDuring these years the drought took its toll on the farmers and the Burgetts moved again with their remaining family to a small farm\n\nto the Southwest of Utica and lived in a small farm house that has since been torn down. The property now as of this writing is owned by Marion and Sue Rose Harter.\n\nSam and the Burgetts continued to farm on a much smaller scale and operated their trucks.\n\nFor a short spell about this time, Sam and Jay along with the Burgetts went to Harrison, Arkansas to all work in the stave mill for a livelihood to sustain their living. It was here that daughter Eva was born to Sam and Jay. After a very short stay in Arkansas the Burgetts returned to Utica and the Davis family went to construction work near Quincy, Illinois. In 1941 while in Illinois their son Bob was born. Meanwhile the Burgett family had purchased the \"Sophie Bench\" farm that was close to the Brick plant. the property was that of orchards, grapes, and berries, well watered with springs\n\nand of fertile soil. Here the Burgetts became known as Poppy and Granny Burgett to the Utica residents.\n\nThe couple lived here until James Burgett died in 1963. The widowed mother was encouraged, by her remaining children, to move into the town of Utica to live. She sold the \"Bench\" farm and purchased the property, for her home, where Russell Searcy and wife now live and own. Eva Burgett passed away in 1975.\n\nWhen Bob was about three years old, the Davis family moved to Chillicothe and Sam became employed with Churchill Freight Lines, Inc. as a truck driver.\n\nIn 1902 Sam, Jay and the two children moved from Chillicothe to Utica and purchased the present home that Jay now lives in. The move was made to come to Utica to help Poppy Burgett farm but Mr. Burgett became ill and passed away the following year.\n\nThe Davis family continued to live in Utica to be near Jay's mother and Sam continued to drive for Churchills. He was one of their truckdrivers for twenty-eight years until his retirement in 1968. Sam passed away in 1972.\n\nWhile the family was living in Chillicothe,\n\nin 1952, Jay commenced her work at the Hedrick Medical Center. Except for a short period of time around 1962, Jay worked at the hospital until her retirement in 1982. She was an aide to the dietician, a nurses aide, and ward clerk during her employment there.\n\nIn 1974 she married Quentin E. Vandusen, who, she and Sam had known along with Quentin's wife in earlier years. The couples had been close acquaintances when all spouses were living. Quentin had moved to Chillicothe and was the production manager for Dr. Pepper Bottling Co. from which occupation he retired. After Quentin's\n\nretirement, Jay would take a leave of absence and the two of them did lots of traveling\n\nthroughout the United States.\n\nAfter Quentin's death, Jay continued to reside in her Utica home in between her many trips to visit her family and friends. Jay recalls that she never drove a car until in the 1960's. When on the farm she could handle those mules but her father never allowed her to drive the trucks or the car. After her marriage to Sam they did good to own a truck of which Sam was possessive. Now she goes and drives when and where she wants to.\n\nWhen asked about some of the highlights of her life since she has retired, Jay talked about her children and her grandchildren and of one trip to Tampa, Florida to see a granddaughter in the Specia1 Olympics of softball throw, relays, gymnastics, and swimming.\n\nJay's daughter, Eva married William D. Boyd and they live in Orange Park, Florida. Their three children are Susan, a schoolteacher, Steven, who is a C. P. A. and Lynn, who resides with her parents and is employed part-time. Eva is a part-time checker and William (Bill) is a produce manager.\n\nJay's son, Robert (Bob) is married to Pamela (Wiley) who he met while in the service in England. They have three children, Gavin who is a race horse jockey, Lynn is employed part-time, while attending college in St. Louis, Missouri. Todd is eleven years old. Bob has retired from\n\nthe U. S. Air Force as a Chief Master Sergeant and is currently employed as a communication person with an electronic data service.\n\nIn recalling some past experiences, Jay remembered the dust trenches that her father would have her or Sam or himself drag down every day around the fields to control the chinch bugs from moving into the crops, how much she and the families enjoyed all of the fruit, berries and grapes from her fathers last farm.\n\nWhen Jay was asked how her children felt about her remarriage after their father's death, she replied \"I think they were relieved from worrying about me by myself\".\n\nIn reminiscing about some cute things that she remembers of her children while they were young, she came up with these:\n\nHer daughter and her boyfriend went over to shoot their gun at her Grandfather Burgett's. In seeing what they thought was a block of cattle salt they shot and killed one of Grandfather's pet ducks. Afraid of confronting him of what they had done, they stewed and fretted until they told him. To their surprise he just smiled and said I guess we'll just eat duck\".\n\nAs for Bob, about twice a year Grandmother Burgett would go visit her relatives and Bob and his cousin Butch would offer to stay with Poppy Burgett but after about two days Bob would sneak to call his mother asking her to call back and say that she needed him at home for come reason. The boys always claimed that they needed to come home for awhile because Poppy's cooking was making them sick. Then Bob will recall that in his high school years it was said that \"Bob was the kind of boy that his mother did not want him to run around with\".\n\nThe house that Jay lives in has a history since the very beginning of Utica and has been sold but few times.\n\nThe original property was granted to Edward Mead from the U. S. Government in 1836 and sold to George Mead for $15.00 in 1837. In 1838 a coalition of partners was formed between the\n\nMeads, Roderick Matson, William Vanzant and Edwin Adriance. These were the original men that laid out and recorded Utica in the County records. When George Mead died in 1854 the estate was settled through probate from out of the St. Louis probate court. The purchasers were Hanson, Chadwick, and J. S. Hoy for $230.00, but later sold to John Hoy in 1855, to Richard Drum in 1856, and in 1873 to Susan Chadwick. In 1929 the Property was passed down to the heirs of F. M., L. M. and Cora Dome and sold to the First National Bank then taken over by the Peoples Trust and Savings Company when the bank closed out due to the depression years.\n\nIn 1931 R. T. and Mae Bell McCoy purchased the property for $500.00. The McCoys deeded to John Attterbury in 1935, then to Ernest Steven and on down through the years to Sam and Jay Davis in 1962.\n\nClark Families\n\nDelvern Lee Clark (Mike) and one brother were born to Veigh and Bessie Clark while his parents were farmers around Ludlow. Mike attended his early school years in the Ludlow area and finished his high school years and graduated from Breckenridge high school in the same building that still is active with school sessions as of this writing.\n\nIn 1940 Mike's parents purchased a Utica general merchandise store from Mike's aunt and uncle, Arvil and Grace McDonnal. As the new store owners moved to Utica they set up their residence in the house now owned by Jan Van Dusen. They operated the store but after one year the senior Clarks wanted to return to the farm so sold their business to Mike who in the meanwhile had met and married Mildred McCullly. The senior Clarks remained in the Ludlow area until their return to Utica after retirement. They then purchased the former home of Melvin McDonnal. The senior Clarks lived at this home until Veigh passed away in 1976 and Bessie was moved to Indian Hills home in 1984.\n\nMilldred Clark was the middle child of six brothers and three sisters. She was born to Webb and Gladys McCulley near Chula, Missouri. Her father was a tenant farmer around that area and moved to farm around Utica while Mildred was a young girl. Her father worked for Ira Hedrick and later Bill Stone as a tenant farmer. Mildred attended the rural country School of Maple Grove, located to the Southwest of Utica and her family lived in the two story dwelling owned and built by the Stone Family that is currently still in the Stone family. Her father passed away in 1966 but her mother\n\nis still living at the age of ninety-three years old and is a resident of Indian Hills Home.\n\nMildred and Mike met, while she was attending Utica High School (then in existence). On April 28, 1940, just a few weeks before her graduation, while the couple were on a date along with two of Mike's cousins, Mildred and Mike decided to get married that night from a whim\n\non the spur of the moment while in Trenton, Missouri.\n\nUpon returning that night the four kept this event a secret from both sets of parents until after the graduation and each had continued to live with their parents. After a short time\n\nwith this kind of an arrangement, Mike decided they must tell their secret and both sets of\n\nparents were told. Although the parents weren't elated over the situation, both sides accepted the fact that the two had made their decision.\n\nThe following year after Mike and Mildred set up housekeeping in a rental house, that is next door North to the one they now live in, they purchased his parents' general store.\n\nIn 1942 their only child, Edwin Lee (Butch), was born. The nickname \"Butch\" was given by Arolene (Jones) Crow who cared for the baby remarking \"isn't he a Butch\" Butch was only eight months old when Mike was drafted into the Navy leaving Mildred to care for Butch and run the store business.\n\nOn Mike's first leave to visit home, the Clarks decided to purchase their first home and bought the property from Mayme Stone which is the home of Ruth Davis as of this writing.\n\nAfter Mike's discharge the Clarks worked very hard and long hours at the business enterprise. They have seen lots of tough times and mastered each obstacle that presented itself to them.\n\nIn 1947 tragedy struck when Butch became badly burned from his clothing catching afire while he watched a trash fire. His father fought desperately to beat out the flames but even then both legs and thighs were badly burned so that much that Butch was unable to use his legs at all.\n\nLike the material his parents were made of and an extreme love and care given to him by his parents, his relatives as well as his little friends, his parents say he didn't miss out on a thing. By the fall of that year Butch was enrolled in the first grade with his friends pulling him to school in a coaster wagon and\n\nhelping him into the classrooms. The teachers reserved special places for him and special consideration given by all at playtimes.\n\nIn addition to his schoolwork, there was lots of skin grafting, prescribed continual rubbing and oil therapy to the damaged and healing areas that first year. Miraculously by February of his first year in school, Butch was gaining some use of his legs. With continued treatments and therapy over many years, Butch recovered the use of his legs and his legs was growing stronger. By the time he had reached his freshman year his determination, pain and suffering had paid off and he was playing football, baseball and basketball and reportedly well too.\n\nAfter completing his elementary grades at Utica he went to Chillicothe for his High School years. At that time a student could make their choice of surrounding high schools and because of the variety of sports at Chillicothe he chose to attend there due to the sports which included football.\n\nAfter his High School graduation, Butch continued his education and graduated from Missouri Valley College at Marshall, Missouri. While studying business management, Butch vowed many times that when he returned he would never, never and never go into the furniture business.\n\nIn 1965 Butch married Marilee Sue (Hill) and did go into the furniture business with his father. He and Marilee have two children, Camille and Travis and make their home in Chillicothe.\n\nIn 1966 Mike and Mildred purchased a much desired property where they live at now. At that time there was a large three story structure standing, that the Merrifields had lived in for years. The Clarks had that structure torn down to make room for the erecting of their brand new home.\n\nIn 1971 Mildred became employed as the postal clerk under Edgar Kohl, Postmaster and in 1980 she was appointed the Postmaster when Edgar retired. This is the same year that Mike retired from his furniture business with his son Butch\n\ncontinuing the family business. Mildred re\n\ntired as the Postmaster in April 1984.\n\nMike's hobbies are fishing, gardening, his yard and any type of ballgames. He will drive a long distance to see a game, especially if his grandson is playing. His special interests are his church and community activities, to be able to help when needed at the furniture store, and his family ties.\n\nMildred's hobbies are reading, bowling, golf and her social interests are her church work, civic affairs within Utica and her specialty is her grandchildren.\n\nSome interesting things found out while researching for this information were:\n\nThe amazing amount of credit business that the Clarks did: in the general store in Utica with very little of the accounts left unpaid; that Mike was the fabled \"Ice Man\" in Utica, delivering before daybreak in the mornings, before opening the store up. He was teased with all of the \"ice man jokes.\"\n\nAlthough Mike and Mildred spent most of their time at the store, Butch never lacked for care, but rather spent his time with them at the store, or with his grandparents.\n\nThe telephone at the store was used by many that did not have a telephone and there were not pay telephones in town.\n\nOther known facts are that they both have always been active in church work; that Mike is a big tease and that he was considered one of the best, in his day, in playing baseball, basketball or tennis but that all came to a stop when he married and purchased the store; that Mildred is a golf fiend does well too; that Butch once played hooky in high school and went to a Trenton track meet and his parents were told by the school before he returned home, that Marilee looked so young that her age was always in question at the movies; and the funny experience that Mildred remembers when a party kept trying to\n\nuse Easter Seals as postage stamps.\n\nThe Clarks feel that they have had a busy but good life, they do hope to remain in good heath and stay as active as possible.\n\nCrain and Gudgell Families\n\nJoseph A. Crain came from Kentucky after the\n\ncivil war in the latter part of the 1800s. He settled in the North area of Ludlow about one mile on the now blacktop from the four corners. He married Margaret Gudgell and the couple had ten children.\n\nAlbert C. Crain was the ninth child of the ten and was born in the farm house at Ludlow. Like his father before, Albert was a hired laborer working mostly for the local farmers around that area. He was well known for his ability as a fast corn husker.\n\nAlbert married Irene (Bland) from Chillicothe and the couple had nine children with four of the babies dying in their infancy. The surviving children are Margaret and Alberta now deceased, Ruth Nelson of Omaha, Nebraska, Charles of Chillicothe, and Earl of Kansas City.\n\nAlbert and Irene moved to Utica in 1909 and lived in a house (since torn down) very near the depot. The Crain family lived at this location until 1931 when they moved to Mooresville to live until 1955. Albert worked on the labor section with Burlington (CB&Q) railroad for forty-six years. Even though he certainly qualified as a foreman for all of those years, due to the unfortunate social structure befalling a black man he remained only considered as common labor.\n\nCharles A. Crain was born in the house near the Utica Depot and as a child growing up there recalls the many trains arriving in Utica. He remembers P. E. Bagley, the daytime station agent and Otis Smith, the nighttime agent. As a young boy, Charles was used as the message deliverer for the Western Union telegrams. He got to deliver around the local area for ten cents a delivery. He recalls the excitement of that much money, and he was only a little guy then.\n\nCharles went to the Attucks School in Utica, through the eight grade. His parents, sisters, and brothers were active in their local church and school activities.\n\nAt the age of thirteen, after his eighth grade graduation in 1931, he moved to Mooresville with his parents. During his high school years Charles lived with his mother's sister, Ruth Anderson and attended school in Chillicothe at Garrison High School. He worked for Hagar's Restaurant, across from the courthouse to the North, Adalines Dress Shop (now where Fletchells is), and did cleaning work at the Windmoor whenever his school time would permit him, to earn a living while attending school full time. In the summer months during vacations Charles would return to the surrounding areas of Utica and Mooresville and do odd jobs, farm work, or weed onions for his Uncle Floyd Gudgell or weed flowers for others. He remembers his uncle paying him ten cents a row for weeding the onions. It seemed like the rows were from \"here to town\" as he reminisced from his home on Conn Street in Chillicothe. The last year of high school he worked the summer cleaning rugs at Slifer's Cleaners (now Model Cleaners).\n\nAfter finishing high school and being unable to find a profitable full time job, Charles decided to sign with the C. C. C.. (Civilian Conservation Corp) Camp in 1937. He was sent to Delta, Missouri near the Missouri boothill.\n\nThe work at the camp was that of cleaning and maintaining levies and drainage ditches. One could only sign up on this State program for a two year period, and although Charles hated to leave, his term was up in 1939. During the time he was at the camp he became one of the overseers of a group of fifteen or so. Each group was given so much area to maintain during the daytime shift. Charles would divide his area by walking off a space for each of his men and himself and each person was responsible to service their own area assigned. By this method each man was working by himself and the job appeared to get done quicker with less goofing off.\n\nCharles returned to Chillicothe but after about one year of doing odd jobs and unable\n\nto find any steady work, at the age of twenty-three, he and three of his friends, Clifton Scott, Lester Williams and Bill Frazier went to join other friends who had gone previously to Los Angeles, California. They each struggled at finding work and Charles became employed by Pittsburg Water Heater Company. He worked for this company until his draft notice of March 1942.\n\nAll of his friends also received their notices and in order for all of the boys to leave together they returned to Chillicothe. The young men were sent to Fort Leavenworth to take their physicals and to be inducted.\n\nCharles was transferred to Tuskegee, Alabama from Fort McClellan to an all black army air force unit. From there he went to Scottfield, Illinois to a radio operator mechanic school and then to Tomah, Wisconsin to a control net systems school which was similar to todays radar. After a short stay at Selfridge Field, Michigan he was sent to Godman Field, Kentucky where he was a radio operator on a B-25 Bomber. When he\n\nwas discharged he was a staff sergeant with all of his time being within the United States, as the war ended before his group had finished their training to go overseas. He was not over elated about his service years and can remember just how long the time was, \"three years, eight months twenty days, and some minutes.\n\nCharles remembers quite well arriving home on the train in Chillicothe. It was on a Christmas Eve around dusk. He was met by his mother, and brother who had just been discharged also.\n\nHe took a job at the Utica brick plant for about a year and then was hired by Slifer's Cleaners once again as a cleaner and presser. He worked at Slifer's for twenty years and during this period he took side jobs, cleaning at Mart Drugs, North Missouri Lumber, a local-church and anything else including being a bellhop at the Strand Hotel, in order to earn a good living for his family.\n\nAt the age of thirty-one years, he married\n\nhis wife, Betty Jane (Parker) who had been a previous acquaintance before his service days. They have raised nine children, all being born in Chillicothe and all graduated from the Chillicothe High School. Their children are Pamela of Rochester, New York; Clarence of Los Angeles, California; Michael who is a preacher in Columbia, Missouri; Steven of Tulsa, Oklahoma; Shelly of Elgin, Illinois; Rodney of San ;Diego, California; Charles Jr. of Denver, Colorado, Marsha and Gregory both of Chillicothe, Missouri.\n\nIn l966, Charles took a position as custodian at Central School where he worked until his retirement in 1983. He still does some part-time filling in at the Chillicothe schools whenever needed.\n\nOther than one day a week on an outside job working for Lenora Lambert, Mrs. Crain has cared for her nine children and the housework plus raising big gardens and still finds time for her favorite hobby of fishing.\n\nBetty and Charles have lived on Conn Street for the past twenty-five years and are both in fair health. Both are devoted to their church work and feel that God has given them many blessings as they struggled throughout their lives to be Christians and raise a good family. Charles recalls his great blessing of a good wife and mother to their children.\n\nAs parents they have tried to teach their children to be independent; knowing how to work, tried to give them a basic education, and tried to instill in them the real values of life.\n\nTheir ambition for the future is to rest more and take life easier. As they try to fulfill these hopes they plan to travel more to visit their children and their fourteen grandchildren, all of whom they love very much. Since these children are scattered from one coast to the other they can always find a different area to travel through.\n\nCharles likes to fish, hunt, and most all types of sports. He remembers the more youthful years of playing on the basketball, baseball\n\nand track teams.\n\nHe could remember his grade school teachers while living in Utica and Mooresville areas and attending the Attucks School. Those he mentioned were Mrs. Saunders, Mrs. Jackson, Mrs. Rosemand, Mrs. Kinney, Mrs. Winfry, and Mrs. Green (no relation of Emma Green of Utica.) These were but a few of those teachers that have\n\ntaught over the past years at Attucks School.\n\nCharles was considered the cut-up of the school and if he got into trouble at school he could expect trouble at home.\n\nHe told of the great fun that the white and black children had playing together with their sleighs and sleds on snow and ice down \"Dietrich Hill\" (road between Harold Romeiser and Gary Sirois residences and the ice skating on the brick plant pond. The fond memories of John and May Lee who were respected by the whites and the blacks alike and livened up Utica with their hall above their restaurant with the many social events that took place there and the dances, music and other gatherings.\n\nHe remembered their first auto after Betty and Charles were married. It was a used 1946 Dodge. Both knew how to drive but Betty has never had a license or driven since licenses have been required.\n\nOne amusing remark made by Charles is when he remarked that his families had always been Methodists and Republicans. He said that no black man would ever admit publicly that he was anything but a Republican since that was the political party of Abraham Lincoln. Other black people would certainly look on or take harsh action on their people if they admitted they were a Democrat. That has all changed now and their people believe that in voting one should vote for the man best qualified regardless of his party.\n\nOne of the highpoints of Charles' life is being selected the first black person to serve on a jury in Livingston County, in 1968.\n\nAs he reminisced of some of his orneriness,\n\nhe talked about the times that his cousins from Ludlow stayed with the Crain family to go to school, Walter and Leon Frazier. At this time of his life all of his sisters had left home so the four boys left, including the cousins, had to take turns doing the morning dishes. While Walter and Earl were doing dishes Leon and Charles would be out in the outhouse taking their morning smoke and visa versa with the other two boys. One morning while Walter and Earl were taking their smoke, their mother looked out the window and saw all of the smoke coming out of the cracks. She washed their mouths out with P. & G. laundry soap and that\n\nstopped the morning smoking.\n\nThe old school bell would ring at 8:30 am and again at 9:00 am when time for school to begin. The boys always liked to go early to play but their mother would not let them go until the first bell rang. The boys would climb up on the roof of the home and ring an old bell that they kept hidden so that their mother would think it was the school bell and they would get to go earlier.\n\nAnother tie to the Utica area with Charles Crain was his Great Uncle and Aunt, John and Bertie Gudgell. John was the brother to his Grandmother Crain. John is well known by some of the older residents of Utica and the surrounding towns. He was an extremely popular and good carpenter. John is credited with building many of the homes\n\nin Utica and the vicinity around.\n\nHe was born in Ludlow and came to Utica with his family. The Gudgells made their home at one time in the house that Minnie Taylor lived in for a good number of years and later was completely remodeled by Bill Cole, Sr.\n\nJohn and Bertie left this home to move in with their Aunt Susan Smith to care for her until her death. Her property was passed on to the Gudgells where they lived until their death. They are buried in the Utica Cemetery. They had five children of which two are still living.\n\nDale and Jones Families\n\nThe Dale family was one of the earlier\n\nfamilies to locate in Utica after the plat had\n\nbeen laid out. Daniel J. Dale brought his young son, William, to the United States after\n\nhis wife died in England. On their journey across the ocean, while aboard the ship, Daniel met a young widow whose last name was Smith. She also had a young son. At a later time, after arriving in the United States the two\n\nwere married.\n\nWilliam Dale was born in England in 1843 and died in 1918 and is buried in the Utica Cemetery. After arriving with his father from their trip across, he migrated to the Braymer area, it is not known just when the family came to Utica but family history shows that William married Hannah Welker and they had six children. John Daniel Dale was born on February 23, 1867 and always told people that he was just one day younger than George Washington. His brothers and sisters were Mary, who married Will Lyons of Braymer, Elizabeth (Lizzie) who married Otto Neushafer of Utica, William who married Emma Creason, Maggie who married Otto Anderson and Otto who married Ruby (maiden name unknown). John Daniel married Minnie May Smith.\n\nLizzie and Otto Neushafer, Will and Emma Dale, and John and Minnie all lived in Utica.\n\nMary and Will were of Braymer and Otto and Ruby lived in St. Joseph, Missouri while Maggie and Otto moved to Oregon.\n\nMinnie May Smith was born in Utica in l869\n\nand was the daughter of Elias and Nancy Jane Smith. They were married on Christmas Day in1885 at Chillicothe, Missouri. The couple had four children that survived and several children that died in their infancy. The surviving children were Clyde, Clara May, Rollo, and Eunice Roxy. Roxy is still living in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nAfter the children of John and Minnie were raised and away from home the couple enjoyed\n\nspending their anniversary day alone, however their first Christmas together, all of their children and the children's families except for one person spent the day with them during his life, John Daniel operated a meat market in Utica, but in later years he farmed and worked a the fruit orchards picking apples. While working at the brick plant he worked six days a week. He liked his meat to eat and did his own butchering with the help of his family. He butchered several hogs and usually one beef\n\nevery year for the family's use.\n\nHe was a staunch Republican and there were many political discussions while sitting in John's front yard on Sunday afternoons. He smoked cigars but Minnie didn't let him smoke them in the house. John Daniel died in 1937 and Minnie May died the following spring in 1938.\n\nClara May (Dale), daughter of John Daniel and Minnie married Curtis Cyrus Thompson of Chillicothe. They lived south of Utica, in the Maple Grove District on a farm. On this farm their first child, John Alden, was born. The house burned and the family moved to temporary living quarters in a house nearby until the new house could be completed. In the temporary quarters a daughter, Helen May, was born. Finally, the new house was completed and the family moved into their new home. Here in the new home two more daughters were born.\n\nIn 1940 the family moved to a farm southeast of Nettleton the family moved to a farm Southeast of Nettleton, Missouri. When their son, John Alden married Erma (Douglas) they settled on a farm close to his parents.\n\nHope married Alvin W. Warner of Kansas City and had one daughter who died in her infancy, Hope resides in Independence, Missouri.\n\nMarion married Ted Satterlee of Utica and they had two children, Floyd Curtis and Roxy Ann. At a later date Marion married John Byler of Melbourne, Arkansas.\n\nHelen married Vincelle Rollin Jones of Chillicothe and they had four children, John Rollin, Barbara May, Dale Arthur, and Paul Everett.\n\nClara May and Curtis Cyrus passed away\n\nwhile living in the Nettleton area they are buried in the Utica Cemetery. Their son, John died at a later date, but his widow Erma still lives on their Nettleton farm. John and Erma had one son, John Alden, who lives in Hamilton and teaches at the Hamilton High School as of this writing.\n\nVincelle Jones came to Utica from Java, South Dakota when he was eighteen years old. After his marriage to Helen they spent the first few years of their married life in Kansas City. Vincelle was employed as a diesel mechanic for a Caterpillar business. While in Kansas City John Rollin was born. When John Rollin was three months old, Helen's mother passed away and Vincelle and the family moved to the farm at Nettleton to help Helen's father with the farm. At this time the brother, John, was in the Navy.\n\nWhile living on the farm their daughter Barbara May was born.\n\nAfter the discharge of John from the Navy and soon after the end of World War II, the Jones family left the farm and moved to Chillicothe as John was farming with his Father. Vincelle went to work with a Caterpillar business and while in Chillicothe their two other sons were born, Dale Arthur and Paul Everett. When Paul was six weeks old, Vincelle, Helen, and the family moved to Utica to the house where they now reside.\n\nVincelle worked for the Caterpillar company for twenty-six years until he retired in 1975. During this time Helen worked five years in the County Clerk's office while the children were in college.\n\nThe Jones family were always involved in school and church activities. Vincelle and Helen are charter members of the Community Baptist Church of Utica and are still very active. Helen has taught Sunday School and Bible School for many years as Vincelle is active in other areas in the church. Vincelle has served on the Green Township Road District for many years as well as the Utica Cemetery Committee. Both are involved in other civic\n\naffairs.\n\nTheir son John married Doris Jean (Bartholomew) of Fayette, Missouri. They have two daughters, Amy Elizabeth and Reba Janine. John works for the State of Missouri as an auditor in the Family Services Department. The family lives in Jefferson City, Missouri.\n\nTheir daughter, Barbara married Kenneth Leroy Branson of New Haven, Missouri. He is a Baptist minister and a school teacher. Barbara teaches school, as of this writing they have two children and the family resides in Waynesville, Missouri.\n\nTheir son Dale lives in Chillicothe and works for Mid-America Dairymen, Inc.\n\nTheir son Paul married Roberta Lottie (Pancoast) of Chillicothe and they live in Chillicothe. Paul works at Milbank's Mills in Chillicothe.\n\nIn recalling memories of her grandfather, Helen remembers when her dad would help butcher. Sometimes it would be on Thanksgiving Day and the families would all make a day of it together.\n\nThere was a small orchard on the farm where Helen lived and when gathering the apples each Fall would always ask his father-in-law what kinds of apples he wanted for the winter. John Daniel would reply that he wanted a barrel of some of the varieties and a half of barrel of other kinds.\n\nJohn Daniel built the house which J. C. Neal owns now, Helen can remember that there was only the porch swing and chairs were carried out of the house to sit on when other seating was needed out of doors, since there was no lawn furniture in those days.\n\nWhen the Thompson family would visit the grandparents occasionally at night, John Daniel would go downtown Utica to the Dome's Store and come back with a large sack of candy for the grandchildren and some bananas. He often would buy a whole stalk of bananas. Helen recalls that banana crates were used for a clothes hamper in the Thompson home.\n\nVincelle and Helen are both retired and do enjoy their golden years. They putter in their\n\ngarden, flowers and lawn. They enjoy their children and grandchildren.\n\nRuth Davis and Family\n\nRuth Davis was the second oldest child of\n\nsix children born to Ina and Ervin Crookshanks in Exeter, California. In her early years the Crookshanks moved to browning, Missouri where her father was a farmer in addition to an interest in the Crookshanks' bakery in Browning.\n\nAs a very young child, while visiting her grandparents' farm, Ruth lost her foot when she ran in front of her grandfather's mowing machine. Even at such an early age, Ruth was a strong hearted person and after the emergency care she received following the accident, by the following December she was fitted for an artificial limb and adjusted extremely well and has never considered her loss a handicap, nor does it appear to affect any of her many activities in the past or present.\n\nRuth attended her first year of school at Browning and the following years of schooling were at Springfield and her graduation from high school at Moberly.\n\nHer father pursued the occupation of a baker with shops at each place they moved. an item found in the news items of an old paper writes of the Crookshanks' families opened one of the first bakeries in Chillicothe, and it was located at First and Vine Streets. The bakery operation was owned by Ruth's father, two of her brothers and a grandfather. The store was of retail truck route and even shipping by railroad.\n\nBefore Ruth's graduation, her father purchased a farm located Southwest of Utica.\n\nWhile operating his bakery business in Moberly, he hired tenant farmers to care for the farm until he sold the bakery business and moved full time to farm.\n\nRuth recalled a phone call received by her father on April 2, 1933 that one of the tenant farmers, and the wife, and all of their five children were killed when their car was struck by a fast moving passenger train at the Miller Crossing Southwest of Utica.\n\nAfter completing her high school, Ruth met\n\nand married William (Pete) C. Davis and they moved to California near Los Angeles. In 1942 Pete went into construction work, during World War II, with the Navy CBs. Ruth came back to stay with her parents, on the farm, as her father was in poor health. Her sisters also came back to stay with their parents while their husbands were in the service.\n\nThe three sisters decided to care for all of the farming and cattle and hold the farm\n\nintact for their parents. They did all of the haying, feeding, planting, harvesting or whatever there was to do. Ruth recalls lots of help from their neighbors, and other experiences, some bad, or happy, or funny during this period of farming.\n\nWhen Pete returned, he and Ruth moved back to California and lived there until Pete's death, in January 1966, from an apparent heart attack while asleep. Before his death Pete was an x-ray technician inspecting seams in a boiler factory, and Ruth was a comtometer operator with U. S. Rubber for fourteen years.\n\nIt was during this time that the Davis's were fortunate to adopt two children Michael (Mike) at four years old, and Debra (Debi) eight months old, a brother and sister. there was a little sister, Glenda, in between but while the Davis's were in the legal process of adopting her she has given to another family. With the help of Ruth in later years, the three children were able to make contact with each other and they continue to keep in contact with each other.\n\nAfter the death of Pete, Ruth moved with her children back to stay with her widowed mother in Ludlow until she purchased the home in Utica where she is now living.\n\nThis home site was purchased from Mike and Mildred Clark and was formerly the site of the trinity Espicopal Church Parish in the year of 1859 and later sold to W. T. Stone, one of the earlier settlers of the Utica area.\n\nRuth became employed at the former IGA Grocery Store in Chillicothe and retired in 1977.\n\nRuth's children finished their high school\n\nat Southwest. Mike continued his education obtaining his Master's degree in business management while serving in the Navy Air Force. He married Jeanie Griffith of Dawn. They have two children. Mike's present occupation is in management in a restaurant chain and Jeanie is a lab technician, Mike and family live in the city of Carrollton, Texas.\n\nDebi received her Master's degree in elementary education and is now teaching in Columbia Missouri where she resides with her family. She married Jim Scanlon of Breckenridge, Missouri and they have two children. Jim is the head basketball coach in the school where he teaches.\n\nRuth was always involved in Church, school, civic, as well as family activities,\n\nretirement did not slow down Ruth's activities. It is said of those that know Ruth, \"one needs to make an appointment to catch Ruth.\" Some of her friends call her business \"gadding\" but Ruth calls it fun or worthwhile causes.\n\nOther than her children and their spouses, the grandchildren are her special joy. Ruth cherishes her close relationship with her family.\n\nAt the present her interests are shopping, Church activities, civic affairs and gadding, she is a voluntary taxi service. She enjoys all types of ball sports and specially\n\nwhen her grandson plays basketball.\n\nMike and Debi will probably always remember the sense of ESP that their parents seem to have when they misbehaved and were found out, the roast that was put in the oven every Sunday morn as the family went off to Church, the fact that if they did not attend Church, they could have no other activities that day and probably the worst was when the parents seemed to always agree with the teacher until there was proof otherwise.\n\nRuth's wishes for the future are good health, to continue to be able to drive her car, to be a part of her Church and most of all to be a loving mother and grandmother.\n\nTo sum up this story of Ruth, she is a survivor, bored with inactivity and is a jolly person and makes friends easily.\n\nDome and McDonnal Families\n\nLouise Florence Smith was one of four children born to Florence and Ernest Smith from the state of Illinois. At the birth of the youngest boy the mother passed away leaving the four children to be cared for. Grandfather Smith\n\ntook two of the children to raise and Louise Florence and her baby brother, Ray, came to live with their mother's sister, Josephine (Smith) and they owned the property at the top of what is now known as \"Stamper's Hill\" and it was here that Louise and Ray came to call home.\n\nThrough the financial support of their wealthy grandfather, Louise graduated from a business college in Galesburg, Illinois and Ray returned to Illinois after his high school years. While in Illinois Ray studied for a position with the Burlington Railroad.\n\nG. F. Drake was later widowed when Josephine succumbed to a bout with cancer.\n\nAt a later date he married Mattie (Stone). There was only one child born to G. F. Drake during the marriage and the child died at a young age. There were not any children from the marriage to Josephine. G. F. Drake did take some nieces and nephews under his wing as his own.\n\nFrancis Marion Dome was born in Elkhart, Indiana and in 1865 left Elkhart by covered wagon to come to Livingston County. He settled in Utica where he met and married Elizabeth (Baltis). Her family had been some of the earlier settlers of this vicinity. The couple had three sons and one daughter all born within Utica and all attending school here. The three sons grew up to become prominent citizens of\n\nUtica and the daughter never married.\n\nIn 1899 Charles and his brother Leonard opened up the Dome Brothers Grocery and were partners until 1929. The first building housing the store was located by the existing buildings of the post office and building to the North. When this building burned the store was moved to the site where the Fire Station is now and in later years before the fire station\n\nwas the Clark's General Store.\n\nThe Dome's competition was that of the Dietrich Brothers General Mercantile Store and it was located just up the street to the South on the Southeast corner of the property now owned by Gary Sirois.\n\nThe Dome Brothers operated the store until they sold it to one of their employees, Tom McCoy who became the Postmaster and operated the store for many years later.\n\nThe other Dome brother of Ralph Loomis is given his family history through the history of Smith, Baltis, Dome, Mounce, and Harter families.\n\nIn 1905 Charles Dome fell in love with Louise Florence Smith and they were married. Their children are Francis Marion II, Florence Elizabeth, and Charles Max.\n\nFrancis Marion Dome II married Mary Alice (Bradford) and they had one daughter Mary Marlene. Before his marriage, Francis attended the Chillicothe Business College and after that graduation he became employed by Montgomery Ward Co.\n\nwhen the first Ward's store was opened up in Chillicothe. During this employment he met and married Mary Alice Bradford. He later transferred to Pueblo, Colorado. After leaving Pueblo he moved his family to Brunswick, Missouri where he owned and operated his own Gambles Store. It was in these years that he became associated with the W. J. Small Firm and assumed full operation of his farm of one thousand acres. He continued this enterprise until his death, at the age of fifty-one. Mary Alice survived\n\nhim for one year.\n\nTheir daughter, Mary Marlene, graduated from Brunswick High School to go on to Christian College and from there to the University of Missouri to obtain her teachers degrees. She taught home economics at Brentwood High School in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1961 she married Dr. Tom J. Coy of Keytesville, Missouri. They now live in Nashville, Illinois where Dr. McCoy and two other associates operate their own\n\nclinic. The couple has three children, Megan Michelle, Thomas Bradford, and Monique Monce.\n\nCharles Max Dome married Mary Lee (Cramer) of the Maple Grove area. He was an enterprising person and started a bulk oil business and a Skelly Oil Service Station in Chillicothe. He was inducted into the service during World War II and was killed in action while on Luzon in 1945. The couple had no children, Mary Lee remained widowed for many years before she remarried to become Mary Lee Everett.\n\nFlorence Elizabeth Dome, like her brothers, was born in Utica and graduated from high school in Utica. After her graduation she attended two years at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri to obtain her associate degree in order to teach. She returned to this area and taught a sum of forty-three years in the Utica, Chillicothe,\n\nHamilton, and Kidder schools. During most of her teaching career she was a high school English and dramatics teacher. She has to her credit the directing of forty-eight plays. Before she retired she was contracted by the government to operate reading machines in the school system.\n\nDuring her first summers, except for one, she would attend college at Warrensburg until she received her bachelor's degree. The one summer she accepted the position of Postmaster operating out of her father's store. After one year of that she was happy to return for her degree. This was just prior to the purchase of the store by Tom McCoy.\n\nDuring these years of teaching she met Elmer McDonnal. Elmer's parents were Willard and Grace McDonnal. Willard and his family were residents of Utica and he was employed by the local orchards. The family resided in the former house that was located where Edgar Kohl has his home now, Elmer and Grace had four children that survived to adulthood. These four were Arnold, Howard, Elmer, and George.\n\nElmer was a few years older than Florence and was employed as a salesman for Monarch and Consolidated Foods, Florence was in her late thirties and not particularly interested in a steady beau. She was living with her parents and very career minded. She received her first phone\n\ncall from Elmer asking for a date to attend the movies in Trenton. She accepted not really caring if the date materialized or not and much against the wishes of her mother, since Elmer was older than Florence. After their first date in June the relationship grew until they were married in December of the same year.\n\nNot many people or her students recognized that the two were becoming serious since they both had new Chevrolets exactly alike. Little attention was paid when Elmer came to call because many thought that it was Florence's car parked in front of her house. Some students first realized that she was dating when the bus was following the couple home one evening from school in Chillicothe. She was teased a lot by her students from then until her marriage to Elmer.\n\nElmer and Florence moved. into a home that Elmer had built in Chillicothe. They lived there approximately four years before their move to Utica to live in the home of her parents.\n\nShe had a terrible dilemma as to what to do with all of the furniture that she had and that of her Mother's not wanting to part with any of it. She rented two rooms from the old hotel to store the unused pieces in but after a period of running back and forth shuffling what she wanted in her house and caring for all at two locations she made a decision to sort through and have an auction. This was good news to Elmer.\n\nAfter Elmer's retirement he took a part-time job as a salesman with Marts Drugs and remained employed part-time until about two months before his death.\n\nAfter Florence's retirement she remained in the home until about one year ago when she took residence in a residential care unit, although she still owns the old home place as of this writing.\n\nFlorence and Elmer did not have any children of their own but her niece, Marlene, was like her own.\n\nAs a child growing up in Utica, she recalls lots of fun and memories.\n\nSome of the memories appear to be funnier\n\nnow as Florence reminisces, Once there was a crowd of students gathered after school to observe a fight between her cousin, Evelyn Dome and Beulah Alexander. The fight was broken up after a severe struggle. The next morning, Florence was one of the students called into the office for watching the fight.\n\nWhen a teacher had given an assignment to a class of her students on one occasion a student, Vern Bagley, let out an oath for disapproval. There was quite a bit of controversy over the teacher's punishment of having Vern wash his mouth out with coconut oil shampoo.\n\nShe relates of the times that the students would lock their sixth grade teacher out of the classroom and another time when the teacher, B. B. Dowell left his classroom for a short time to visit his wife who was having a baby. While he was gone, instead of doing the assignment left for the students to do, they decided to play with the basketball in the classroom and it went out of the open window, down into the parking lot, in front of the car, just as Mr. Dowell drove into the school.\n\nThen there was the time that Florence and a bunch of her friends all smoked some cigars at a chivaree and how sick they all got.\n\nShe remembers when Lela Sherman and herself found Wilfred (Willie) Potts in the school library and talked him into letting them braid his long straight hair into many, many small pigtails. When the superintendent wandered in on the process, he asked what they were doing. They replied that they were starting a beauty shop. They were told to unbraid all of the pigtails and only reprimanded not to let it happen again.\n\nShe remembers all of the Dome relatives living close around each other in the homes that they either built, purchased from each other, or inherited.\n\nAfter becoming a teacher she had many funny experiences. One time she was playing basketball with the older boys out on the court.\n\nThe medal fastener on the overall suspenders of Leo Sissell cut her across her forehead deeply enough that she was compelled to take the rest of the day off to go have stitches made.\n\nOne time that stands out was when she had constantly scolded and warned her students against playing marbles for keeps and that she would not tolerate it. When she left the classroom on one occasion and returned later she found fourteen boys in the middle of the floor playing marbles \"for keeps.\" She contacted the superintendent of her intentions of punishment and was offered\n\nhis assistance but she insisted on administering all of the paddlings herself. When she was finished with all fourteen she was exhausted\n\nand said that she never ever gave anyone else a paddling during the rest of her teaching career.\n\nOne of the memories of her mother was how kind and thoughtful Mrs. Ira Hedrick was to her mother (Josephine Smith that raised her). She was such a caring person that she would ride most every day horseback to look after Aunt Josephine (Jo) during her illness. Mrs. Hedrick journeyed from the Hedrick farm (which is now a part of the Beetsma Farm) to and up \"Stamper Hill.\" Mrs. Hedrick was loved by everyone and\n\nalthough she was a woman of financial means she was most common to all of her friends and acquaintances. Louise Dome said \"Everyone should have known Ella Hedrick, for she was a very sweet person\"\n\nFlorence Elizabeth is still quite active in her new residence. She visits daily with all of her friends in the residential facility. She is involved in the craft programs, the exercise classes, and takes jaunts almost daily in the tour bus with the other residents. She has an extremely sharp mind, but then one does expect that of a school teacher. She never gets bored for the lack of something to do.\n\nAlthough Florence is not confined to a wheelchair she finds it the quickest and most comfortable mode of getting around as much and as fast as she wishes to travel about within the housing units.\n\nShe remains a very busy person.\n\nHoward and Madeline Hawkins\n\nHoward McMillen Hawkins was the fourth child\n\nborn to Walter Carl Hawkins and Susan Golda (McMillen) Hawkins. The other three children are Mary Fae, Hattie Mae, and Walter. Being the youngest, Walter's brothers and sisters were just the right age to spoil their baby brother.\n\nThe parents of Walter Carl Hawkins were Othello Smith Hawkins and Melissa Ann (Eliott) Hawkins. they had seven children. Othello and Melissa came to this area, South of Utica, in the early 1880s and purchased the farm that Howard Hawkins was later born at. Othello was a school teacher and also fought in the Civil War.\n\nThe parents of Susan Golda (McMillen) Hawkins were John Alfred McMillen and Susan Melvina (Stone) McMillen. John and Susan had ten children and raised their family one mile south of Utica where John farmed. Susan Melvina was the daughter of the earlier settlers, Judge John and Susannah Stone the only girl of eight children.\n\nMadeline Annabell Walz was the oldest of five children born to Herbert Martin Walz and Caroline Earnestine (Myers) Walz. The other children are Carolyn Ruby (Rawlins), Reta (Coleman), Robert Lee, and Fontelle Marilyn (Lemon).\n\nThe parents of Herbert Walz were George Walz and Anna (Osborn) Walz. Herbert was the seventh of nine children raised in Utica. George was a farmer and in later years operated a gas station and bus station at the Utica Junction.\n\nCaroline's parents were Harry (Hal) Myers and Emily Belle (Kerr) Myers. She had one brother and one sister who died in infancy. Hal Myers worked on the railroad, built a number of bridges in Livingston County and in later years operated a blacksmith shop in Utica, which was South of the now existing Masonic building .\n\nHoward Hawkins spent his boyhood on the\n\nfarm where he was born and where he still lives. He walked a mile and a half each day to attend the Maple Grove School and three miles each day to attend High School in Utica where he graduated. His last two years he was allowed to drive his parents 1927 Buick car to school, part of the time. The first car he can remember his parents owning is a Buick touring car. Life was great for Howard as he spent his boyhood going to school and doing a lot of fishing and hunting and riding ponies with his friends and relatives. He has attended lots of family reunions. Howard has always attended the Utica Baptist Church.\n\nMadeline was raised in Utica and there was always a new brother or sister to help care for. She was blessed with lots of relatives and her friends to play with. She enjoyed school at Utica and all of the different activities at school. Her father worked on the railroad and was away from home a good deal of the time. One of her favorite pastimes was going next door to Grandpa and Grannie Myers. All of her brothers and sisters were born in Utica. Madeline was enrolled in the nursery at the Utica Baptist Church when she was a baby and has regularly attended church since that time. The first car she can remember was her parents owning a Model A Ford.\n\nHoward and Madeline accepted Christ as their Lord and Savior at the same revival meeting, held at the Utica Baptist Church by Rev. Charles Foley and were both baptized on September 23, 1934. They have been members there since that time. Howard has served as a Sunday School superintendent, trustee, treasurer, song leader,\n\nand was ordained as a deacon on February 21, 1954. Madeline has taught Sunday School since she was fourteen years old, been a G. A. and training union leader and has served as the church clerk since June 1956.\n\nHoward and Madeline had their first date on September 11, 1937 and on December 21, 1938 they decided to elope and were married. They moved to the farm two and half miles South of Utica, where they now live and have lived all but one year of their married life. The one year was spent in Utica.\n\nThe first car they owned was a used 1933 Ford coupe and the first new vehicle they owned was a red 1952 one-half ton Dodge pick-up truck.\n\nDuring the first years of their marriage, life was quite different than the present. The farming was done with horses. Their first tractor purchased was a F-12 1937 Farmall (steel wheeled)in January 1940. Large gardens were raised, there was no electricity and the house was heated with wood which they cut. Cows were milked by hand to sell cream from and chickens were raised for the family's use and to sell in order to buy other necessities. There were no refrigerators and the way you kept food cool was to carry it back and forth to the cellar.\n\nHoward always worked with the threshing crews and Madeline would cook for about eighteen of the threshers when the crew was at their farm for threshing.\n\nTo supplement income, Howard would work at Central States Orchard Company, picking sorting apples each fall.\n\nThere were two daughters born to Howard and Madeline. Shirley Jean and Madalyn Karol. Both girls attended Maple Grove grade school and Chillicothe High School. While Shirley and Karol were growing up their home was always a busy place with the entertaining of lot of friends and relatives in the home, their regular attendance at the Utica Baptist Church and any other church activities, all school activities in both grade and high school, as well as the visiting of their relatives and grandparents. In\n\naddition the girls always found time for the playing of fishing, going ice skating and sled\n\nriding with their friends and family.\n\nShirley now lives in Lubbock, Texas and she has two children, Her daughter Ronda Kay is married to Garry Brandt, and the son, Todd Howard Thompson who is a senior at Southwest Baptist University at Bolivar and works as a\n\ncomputer programmer. He plans to be married to Judy Newbold of O'Fallon, Missouri during 1986. Ronda's husband, Garry, is a football coach and a teacher at Camdenton.\n\nKarol attended Central Missouri State University at Warrensburg for two and half\n\nyears after her high school graduation. She is married to Raymond Eugene Jones. Raymond is the Vice-President of Shelter Insurance Companies and they reside in Columbia, Missouri. They have one daughter, Andrea Rae who is fourteen and a freshman in high school.\n\nHoward and Madeline have always belonged and been active in the Democratic party during their married life. Howard served as Democrat Committee from Green Township for years. He has also served as Green Township Trustee and a member of the Township Board.\n\nBy the insistence of a very dear friend and a Democrat, Howard McDonnal, Madeline filed as a candidate for Green Township Collector and served in that office from l953 through 1959. She made collector settlements with the County Clerk, who at that time was H. Earl Barnes. One\n\nday as Madeline was making her settlement, he asked if she wanted to work part-time as a deputy county clerk which she accepted and from\n\nJune 1956 until March 16, 1959 she worked part-time. After then Mr. Barnes asked her to work as a full time deputy. She served as a deputy until Mr. Barnes resigned his position, due to poor health and Madeline was appointed by the Governor of Missouri as the Livingston County Clerk, on January 20, 1964. She has served at this position for the past twenty-two years and has filed for another term and is running unopposed. This part of Madeline's life has been very interesting. They have made many friends and its has been their pleasure to serve the residents of Livingston County.\n\nAs they look back over their lives, they feel that they have been well blessed and that reasoning due to the trusting in the Lord to care for them each day, which he has done and in doing so the lord\n\nhas made life a beautiful experience for both. They have thoroughly enjoyed their parents, grandparents, brothers, and sisters, their daughters, and grandchildren, all of their friends and their work.\n\nThey are devoted to their Church work and their worshiping of the Lord as their Savior, and feel an extra closeness to their Christian friends.\n\nSome interesting facts from the Hawkins' is that of the ten children of Susan Melvina (Stone) McMillen, one drowned in the Grand River at the age of fourteen, a son Drury Edwin. Church history shows that another daughter joined the Utica Baptist Church in 1898.\n\nOf the children of Othello and Melissa Hawkins two were a set of twins.\n\nAlthough at one time the relatives were many in the Utica area, as of this writing Madeline is the only one remaining in the local vicinity.\n\nBoston, Peterie, and Hickman Families\n\nIn the early 1900's O. Peterie married Ida\n\nMarie Boston. The parents of Ida Marie were residents of Utica and the Bostons were quite involved business wise. Mr. Boston operated a blacksmith shop in the small building still standing and now used as a mechanic garage across the street to the West of the present fire station, and a livery stable in that same vicinity was operated by the Bostons, they ran a butcher shop on the Southwest corner of the property now owned by Robert and Marge Searcy. The Boston family were busy people and hired quite a few employees.\n\nTo the marriage of O. Peterie and Ida Marie were born three children, daughter Leon married Ear Kit Carson (not the legendary figure) and Leon's daughter married a Tom Sawyer. The Peterie's son Dana O., and their daughter (Buck) Beatrice were the other two children.\n\nDue to a separation of O. Peterie and Ida Marie, the children remained with their father. Later O. Peterie met Mary Cobb, from the Chillicothe area and they were married. From this union three children were born to add to the household, Paul who died at an early age, Josephine who died in her infancy, and Adveline (Allie Hickman) who is the only surviving child of her mother from this marriage.\n\nMary Cobb at an early age married a man by the name of Ray Dusenberry at Odessa, Missouri. Most of that marriage was spent living in a covered wagon where she gave birth to three children, Forrest, Elmer, and Neva. It was when this marriage ended that Mary came back to this area around Chillicothe that O. Peterie met her. They were married in 1916. Her maiden name was Cobb.\n\nMary's son Forrest continued to live with them until he was married. At the age of nineteen he had a hunting accident and shot himself through the arm, which had to be amputated. Later, he married a woman that walked with a crutch because of a crippled hip. Even with these handicaps the pair, Forrest and wife Birdie, owned and operated a restaurant on Southwest\n\nBoulevard in Kansas City for many years,\n\nMr. Peterie was a brick mason, carpenter and an interior decorator in the Livingston County area in addition to farming on the side.\n\nWhen Allie was of a young, age Mr. Peterie and his family moved to the area South of Chillicothe known as \"Jim Town Bottoms\" where they resided in an original log cabin. This farm was located near the area now known as Roach Lake. Allie remembers ice-skating on the lake before the Roach Lake Club was formed.\n\nAllie attended McCreary rural school for seven years before her family moved into Chillicothe where Allie went to the eighth and ninth grades. When Allie's father became ill it became necessary for her to help earn her way through school, so she chose to go live with her half-brother, Dana, and his wife in North Kansas City. While living there she worked her way through the balance of her high school years and graduated from North Kansas City High School. During this time her parents remained in Chillicothe.\n\nAfter her graduation she attended one year of courses at the Trenton Junior College. Allie worked part-time at Brown Shoe Store while going to college and roomed at a boarding house with five other girls.\n\nCharles and Retta Hickman came to Livingston County by covered wagon, from the south. They had a baby boy who became very ill and died one night while they were camped on the Black River in South Missouri. After arriving in the County, the Hickmans first settled in the Grand River bottoms, South of Chillicothe in a place called\n\n\"Isril Flats.'' They had four boys, Earnest, James B., (Jim), Clarence, and Alfred, and two\n\ngirls, Ruth and Eva. The family was farming in these bottoms during the flood of 1909 and the Hickmans lost some of their livestock in that flood. The Hickman family moved to a farm North of Avalon where their children were raised.\n\nJames B.(Jim as those of Utica know him) attended the rural Greene School through the sixth grade and due to hard times he went to live with his Aunt Clara Moffitt at Desoto, Kansas. Here, he was able to finish the eighth grade. He helped his aunt, who owned a grocery store, by delivering groceries, ice, and coal. At the age of fourteen years he was driving the delivery truck to all points of delivery and through the Kansas City areas.\n\nAs a young adult Jim returned to Avalon to hire out as a farm laborer. Allie's and Jim's parents had been good friends for many years and it was this way that the two became interested in each other.\n\nWhile the two families were visiting one day, Jim asked Allie for a date. They went to Chillicothe on this date in Jim's Model T Ford car, to see a silent movie. Jim had purchased his Model T Ford for fifteen dollars and paid it off in monthly installments.\n\nAllie recalled many other dates with Jim on horseback or in a two seated high front buggy, when the roads were not passable for automobiles.\n\nThe two went steady for two years and were married at Chillicothe, by the Justice of the Peace. They had to obtain their marriage license in Trenton, as the man at the Chillicothe license bureau knew Allie and her age. She recalled her wedding day as a beautiful sunny day.\n\nThey returned that same day to the Hickman homeplace to set up housekeeping in the upstairs of the two story house, while Jim's sister, Eva and her husband Leon Newman and their daughter (now Marge Searcy) occupied the downstairs portion.\n\nAfter a few months, Jim rented a farm in the \"Low Land\" area North of Avalon for about two to three years. Here, their first daughter, Mary Louise was born on Allie's birthday. Times were hard and Jim moved his family South of Chillicothe and went to work on W. P. A. for about three months before obtaining a job with the railroad. They lived in the small house on the South side of old Highway 36 across from the present R. E. A. Office. Where the R. E. A. office now stands, Allie's parents, the Peteries, managed and operated a restaurant and service station before the present R. E. A. office was built. Nora Lucille was born to the Hickman's\n\nwhile living at this location.\n\nThe family then moved to a house Northwest of Central States Orchards in the Mooresville district for a very short period of time. They were able to move to Spring Town, North of Mooresville, and rent the house, all out buildings, and ten acres and the mineral springs that had been the location of the old scenic hotel in the years past. All of this was rented for twelve dollars per month. The family was excited over the pump in the house even though it took some getting use to the taste of the mineral water. James Richard was born here. During this move Jim changed employment to the Utica brick plant.\n\nWhen James was about four years old the Hickman's moved back to Chillicothe and purchased a two story dwelling near the Chillicothe Business College. Their last child, Linda Kay, was born while living here.\n\nThis was the era of World War II. Jim was unable to pass the service exam to enlist due to a heart, murmur. To be involved Jim went to Sunflower, Kansas to work in an explosive factory. Allie remained in Chillicothe with her family and rented a portion of the house for apartments to girls attending the business college. Marge Newman (Searcy later) stayed some with Allie and the family during these years. Marge was an only child and she really enjoyed the companionship of her cousins.\n\nAfter the war Jim returned to the Utica brick plant and in 1950 the Hickmans purchased the present home from Edgar Kohl. The house had been originally built by Joseph (Judge) and Mollie Bonderer.\n\nJim continued his employment at the brick plant until he was forced to retire due to his health in 1961. In addition to his employment full time, he operated the road maintainer for Green Township and continued on the maintainer and mowing of the roadsides for the Village of Utica even after his retirement. Jim passed away December 3, 1985, suddenly with an apparent heart attack.\n\nAfter moving to Utica, Allie has been employed by Union Bankers Insurance, National Bell\n\nHess, Gibsons, two nursing homes, and seven years at IGA Grocery before it closed in Chillicothe. She remains at their hone at the present.\n\nBefore the passing of Jim, he was the president of the Roach Lake Boat Club. The year of his retirement, he and Alllie moved out and bought a cabin to retire in at the Lake. They moved in the cabin for the fall and stayed through the winter but were flooded out in the Spring. They gave up the idea of full time retirement there and moved back to their home in Utica. Jim, did however, continue to care for the maintenance and remain the president of the club until his death.\n\nJim, enjoyed hunting, fishing, gardening and horse shoe pitching. He passed away as he had desired \"in a hurry with his boots on\"\n\nSince a tomb stone could not be erected until the ground had settled more, one grandson made a nice temporary wooden monument with Jim's famous slogan \"Have no fear J. B.'s here\" plus other loving words and beloved Grandpa as the epitaph.\n\nAllie enjoys fishing, outdoor activities, gardening, especially flowers, and sewing crafts. Her wishes for the future are to remain in good health, go when she wants to go and where she wants to go, continue to be able to drive her car, and be a help to any of her family when they need her.\n\nBoth Jim and Allie are proud of their nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. They hold a special love for their own children and their mates who are always there whenever they are needed.\n\nAllie recalled some memories worth mentioning. While living with her parents in the Jim Town Bottoms the home was flooded in and her father became ill. Just before he was to leave by boat to go to the car on higher ground and drive into the doctor's office, Allie decided to go out the front door and forgot the water. She was swept out into the flood water and carried down to be caught in the chicken fence.\n\nShe was very young and screaming loudly when her half sister heard her. Her father was able to rescue her safely.\n\nThe first car she remembers that her parents owned was a Willys with side-curtains to pull down in the winter.\n\nWhen O. Peterie, Allie's father, was married to Ida Marie Boston and they lived in Utica, Mr. Peterie and Tom McCoy helped move the brick plant equipment from Red Oak, Iowa to the present site, the two assembled all of the equipment by hand after moving it.\n\nJim's mother raised her granddaughter, Vera, after her mother passed away at childbirth. The baby Vera weighed less than two pounds and was premature Her grandmother kept the baby wrapped in cotton and olive oil and warmed on a pillow on the oven door and fed the baby with an eye dropper. The baby required this care for many months. Vera grew strong and has led a normal life. She has raised six of the seven children that she gave birth by her husband, James Jones, from the Dawn area. Vera (Hickman) Jones is now living in the Mooresville area.\n\nJim and his brothers plowed five acres while pulling a walking plow with a 1926 Dodge touring car.\n\nOther interesting facts connected with Allie's life is that Beatrice, her half-sister that they called Buck, left this area to go to Florida and there met her husband she married. This man was Frank Buck of the safaris and Northwest Mounties Movies. His first wife was Pearl of the famous \"Pearl and Frank Buck bring em back alive.\" Beatrice was his second wife.\n\nThe vacant area between the Hickman home and the two story tin building to the South, was the place that the Utica Opera House once stood. Jim from time to time had found some coins, silver dollars, and other relics from the past in this area.\n\nThe children of Jim and Allie will remember the many good times that the family did enjoy like the times each year that they went to\n\nMinnesota to fish at Star Light Lake.\n\nAllie remembers the many hours on the pontoon in South Missouri just fishing all day with their lunch aboard.\n\nSome of the funnier memories of the children while growing up were recalled; Louise fell out of the family car while traveling and was missed some distance later. She had not been hurt.\n\nLucille used to think that her elbows were given her to keep her from falling in while using the outside toilet.\n\nLinda was sobbing to her daddy after his return trying to tell why her mother had given her a spanking for not getting to the outside toilet earlier. Her reason was that \"How can I keep the door shut, hold my nose, and still pull down my underwear to go with just two hands?\"\n\nThe family had a very mean buck sheep that no one dared to go into the pasture with, but one day here came Jimmy (son James) up through the gate with his arm around that buck like they were buddies.\n\nThere were hard times but the joys of the love in a family and the togetherness is worth it all.\n\nHightower and Cosgrove Families\n\nWalter Lee Hightower came from Shelby County\n\nto Livingston County about the turn of the century as an employee of the Burlington Railroad. He married Bertie Lee (Frith) who came from the state of Kansas. They had six children and one of these being George Walter, the youngest of the six children. The couple and their family settled in the Mooresville community.\n\nBertie and her daughters worked in the old Mooresville telephone exchange for several years.\n\nGeorge Walter attended the schools in the Mooresville area of that time and later married Hazel Lucille (Gilliland).

Larry married Wilma (Garrison) of Chillicothe. They have two boys and they reside in Utica at the present.\n\nFay's occupation, other than some time farming was that of a carpenter and electrician.\n\nBarbara recalls that her friendship grew with Bill as they were school chums and neighbors. Bill was one grade ahead of her in school.\n\nThe friendship was further cultivated since the older children were permitted to walk home from school if they so desired. Bill, Barbara, and another neighbor girl, Sandra Brown, walked\n\nhome rather than ride the station wagon bus that was provided by the school.\n\nThe eighth grade year was the last year that Barbara went to Mooresville School. by this time the consolidated district to Southwest School had been formed and Bill and Barbara continued their high school years there.\n\nBy the time Barbara was a sophomore and Bill was a junior, they considered that they were going steady. The first date requested by Bill was while Barbara was in the garden picking peas. The event was a double date with all going to the movies in Chillicothe.\n\nIn the month of June after her graduation, the two were married at the Church of Christ in Chillicothe by Ralph Acree. Barbara's brother, Edward was the best man, and Bill's sister, Peggy was the brides maid.\n\nThe two first set up housekeeping in a rented house North of Mooresville.

They moved to Chillicothe for a short time and returned to purchase the house from Ralph and Marie McCain that they had previously rented.\n\nThe family remembers the excitement of modernizing the home with the help of Barbara's dad. They recall the wonderful neighbors they had and named those of Hazel Lemon, Ura Minnick, Mary Treon, and Tannessee Bryan. These women often dropped in to help Barbara dress her fryers or old hens, prepare her garden items for canning, or whatever seemed to be at hand. Their help was all volunteered and very much appreciated\n\nby the Hightowers.\n\nThe remarks were made while preparing this for this writing that the world and neighborhoods are much too caught up in a busy way to socialize and befriend each other in this manner much anymore.\n\nBill recalled working at the hog farm using the old Mooresville school building. He also worked for Barbara's uncle, Cecil Higgins,\n\nwho owned the R. C. Bottling Plant. He drove a feed truck delivering Morman Feed for Council\n\nFeeds and still later, Bill was employed by the Dr. Pepper Bottlers.
