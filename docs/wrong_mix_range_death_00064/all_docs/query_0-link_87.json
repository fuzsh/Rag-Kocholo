        "text": "Jane Keithley was one of the thousands of girls who were considered top tier beauties in their small towns, and were buoyed to think they might have a career in Hollywood. Of course Hollywood is a slightly more “difficult” town, with keen competition and many new faces appearing daily – most of them never achieve credited roles. Jane was lucky here – after some machinations to get her career off the ground, she actually got a big chance, playing the lead role in a Jack London adaptation. Sadly, the movie only showed that Jane’s future in movies was a shaky one. She married and retired not long after. Let’s learn more about her.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nJane Neave Keithley was born on April 12, 1908, in Kansas City, Missouri, to Herbert R. Keithley and Harriet Mabel Tinker. She was the youngest of five children – her siblings were Herbert Rudolph, born on May 27, 1897, Mary Madeline, born on November 18, 1898, Frank Tinker, born on April 14, 1900, and\n\nThe Keithley family were of Pennsylvania- Dutch ancestry. When they went west they established a home in Central Missouri, in Saline County. Jane’s father, Herbert, who was born and reared in Missouri, and lived for a time in New York City. He was an engineer and did much for the field of mechanical invention. He invented the copper rail union and the Keithley box car under-frame for railway cars.\n\nThe family moved to Michigan City, Indiana in 1918, where Jane graduated from high school. Jane grew up into a stunning petite blonde and won several local beauty contests. She entered the University of Chicago, but it seems life had other plans for her. As her beauty attracted attention everywhere, and she was often mistaken for an actress she decided that she might have an opportunity, so she hatched a long term plan on how to achieve her dream. Well aware that she needed some money before going to Tinsel town, she left the University of Chicago to enter the business world and became the secretary/stenographer to a Michigan City broker.\n\nOne day in 1928, Jane took a free ride to California with her grandmother on a chance of getting into pictures. Jane lived in Aloha Apartment Hotel and found employment in a bond house at Los Angeles, where she did secretarial work. In the meantime, she had no luck at the studios, even when an agent took an interest in her and tried to get her some roles. Jane was not deterred easily – still with a movie career in mind, she accepted a position as stenographer in the executive offices of the Paramount studios. She was at least close to the apex of the action now, working for a large studio. Her plan came to fruition very soon – after working there for about three months she was given a screen test, and as a result was given a small part in “Paramount On Parade”. Then came her big chance, when she was given a five-year contract at the Fox Film studios. And thus her career started!\n\nCAREER\n\nJane made her debut in Paramount on Parade, a typical musical extravaganza with no coherent story but with loads of music, dancers and intricate dance sequences. And the mega stars! All of the bigwig Paramount names are here – Jean Arthur, Gary Cooper, Clara Bow, Maurice Chevalier…\n\nThe Florodora Girl, Jane’s next feature, was a more intimate affair – But I mean only slightly more. A Gay 90s musical with the charming Marion Davies in the lead, as a Floradora girl who tries to woo a fancy young wealthy man. Their being shot before the production code worked its way in Hollywood, her hearty toddy (played by Lawrence Gray) is a less than desirable playboy, so you can guess their path to the stars in thorny indeed. Nice music, nice dancing sequences, and most people seem to really like Marion and find her very charming. I like Marion too and am always saddened how her career turned out. So much for having a wealthy benefactor who doesn’t know quite what to do with you!\n\nJane hit the female lead category with The Sea Wolf, adaptation of the Jack London classic. While the cinematography is very good and director more than solid, it’s the botched script and the lackluster actors that don’t quite click. Milton Sills is frightfully miscast as. And Jane.. Oh boy. It was obvious that Jane just didn’t have what it takes to become a major star. She comes out as wooden and not very warm, and in a town where there are 100 new actresses every day, not many get a second chance. Jane was, it seems, left behind.\n\nJane was back to musicals with Whoopee!, an Eddie Cantor vehicle considerably cut down from the original Broadway show. But what can I say, it’s a typical Cantor movie, anyone who loves Cantor and that 1920s humor style will love it. Cantor plays Henry Williams, a nervous hypochondriac who goes west looking for a cure for his myriad of ailments and get involved in trouble along the way. There are a few good supporting players (Ethel Shutta, Paul Gregory, Jack Rutherford). While not the bottom of the barrel, the movie didn’t age well at all, since, sadly, it’s a typical product of it’s time in relation to blackface and racial stereotypes.\n\nIMHO, the most interesting movie Jane appeared in was The Secret Call, a tightly made but sadly obscure political-crime movie. Peggy Shannon, a charismatic actress but also a tragic figure (died way too young), is very adept in the role of a woman who vows revenge after her father committed suicide, having been ruined by political boss William B. Davidson. Peggy’s character had to give up her socialite life to work for a living, and a year later is in charge of a telephone switchboard, and a few telephone operators, in an expensive hotel. And then the tables are turned when she hears something that can I always love the story that gives a female the central role and explores her complex emotional states. The story, made from a theater play, is brisk, fast paced and not a minute is wasted, the cast is good (Peggy, Richard Arlen, Ned Sparks). All in all, it’s not a A class picture but a very handy B class one, certainly worth a watch.\n\nJane’s last movie came in 1933, with Luxury Liner. A Grand Hotel-like look at a few passengers of a luxury liner (duh!). The movie has a really good B level cast (Alice White, Zita Johann, George Brent, Vivienne Osborne), and an overtly dramatical plot, but what did you expect? These kinds of assembled movies are worth watching for the drama, mostly, so this does hit the spot.\n\nThat was it from Jane!\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nJane didn’t make too much waves in the papers with her romantic life. After dating guys in Indiana and Chicago while studying/working there, during the making Sea Wolf, Jane fell in love with the director, Alfred Santell. Their was a stormy courtship, marked with ups and downs, but in the end love prevailed, and the eloped to Yuma, Arizona, in 1934. Jane gave up her career to raise a family with Alfred.\n\nSantell was quite a bit older than Jane, born on September 14, 1895. Here is his bio (taken from imdb):\n\nAmerican director, billed early in his career as’ Al’ Santell. A former architect (graduate of Los Angeles University) he began in the movie industry in 1914 as a general factotum at the Lubinville Studio in Philadelphia before working his way up the ladder to director/scenarist in which capacity he handled one- and two-reel short comedy subjects for Mack Sennett, Hal Roach and at Kalem. Following a brief spell in the army (1918-19) he advanced to supervising manager at Universal and was given his own comedy series (the “Alfred Santell Comedies”) which starred a trained chimp named Joe Martin! By 1923, he had progressed to feature film direction and signed a lengthy contract with First National. A renowned light comedy specialist, Santell made an assured transition to sound. In the course of the next 15 years he turned out a string of solid second features — as well as the occasional “A”-grade release — for 20th Century-Fox (1929-33), RKO (1934-35), Paramount (1936-42) and United Artists (1943-44).\n\nOne of his best talkies was an early entry into the “Dr. Kildare” cycle (that was before MGM picked up the option and made millions from the franchise !). This was Internes Can’t Take Money (1937), a slickly made box-office hit with Joel McCrea as the good doc and Barbara Stanwyck as an ex-convict mother. The New York Times critic described Santell’s direction as “a blend of [Alfred Hitchcock] suspense and American verve”. Other noteworthy highlights in his career include an early version of The Sea Wolf (1930) (starring Jane Keithley who later became Mrs. Santell), Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1932), Winterset (1936) (based on the play by Maxwell Anderson), Aloma of the South Seas (1941) and the biopic Jack London (1943). Santell retired in 1946 after directing a couple of B-movies for Republic.\n\nAlfred and Jane had four children: Barbara Jane, born on May 24, 1935, Linda Jane, born on June 22, 1936, Allen Alfred, born on September 2, 1938, and Evan Allen, born on December 16, 1939. Alfred was quite successful in the business as it seems, and the family employed two nurses, a cook and a butler.\n\nThe stormy moments of their courtship didn’t end with marriage – it seems that Alfred and Jane tiffed, separated, then made up, then tiffed again, then made up again and so the circle goes. They even separated for good in October 1942. It was almost game over, as Jane filed a divorce suit on the grounds of cruelty. Luckily, they reconciled in early 1943 and the suit was dropped.\n\nSadly, dark times were coming for the Santell family. Jane fell ill not long after the reconciliation. I could not find an exact cause of her illness, but the situation was not good and it only went from bad to worse.\n\nJane Santell died on September 13, 1944 in Los Angeles.\n\nHer widower Alfred died on June 19, 1981 in Los Angeles."
