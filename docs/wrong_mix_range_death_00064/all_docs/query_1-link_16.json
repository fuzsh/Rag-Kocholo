        "text": "(1911–37). American movie star Jean Harlow was a sex symbol of the 1930s who portrayed frankly sensuous characters. She developed considerably as an actress but died prematurely at the height of her career.\n\nHarlean Harlow Carpenter was born on March 3, 1911, in Kansas City, Missouri. At the age of 16 she left private school in Highland Park, Illinois, to marry and settle in Beverly Hills, California. In 1928 she embarked on an acting career, which caused her marriage to break up. Under the name Jean Harlow, she began playing small parts in short films, many of them silent comedies directed by Hal Roach. Her first screen credit was in a Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy comedy, Double Whoopee, in 1929. After making her talking-picture debut in a small role in The Saturday Night Kid (1929) with Clara Bow, Harlow was chosen by Howard Hughes to star in his Hell’s Angels (1930). She became an immediate sensation. A rapid succession of movies followed—among them Platinum Blonde (1931), Public Enemy (1931), and Red Dust (1932)—all designed to exploit Harlow’s worldly wise manner, her striking beauty, and her forthright sexuality."
