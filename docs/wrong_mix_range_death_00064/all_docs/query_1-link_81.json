THEY EXIST N O T O N LY AS\n\nartifacts, such as cemeteries and commemorative landmarks, but also as behaviors. They endure, in other words, as occasions for memory and invention. This book shows how the memories of some particular times and places have become embodied in and through performances. But it also sug‑ gests how memories torture themselves into forgetting by disguising their collaborative interdependence across imaginary borders of race, nation, and origin. The social processes of memory and forgetting, familiarly known as culture, may be carried o u t by a variety of performance events, from stage plays to sacred rites, from carnivals to the invisible rituals of everyday life. To perform in this sense means to bring forth, to make mani‑ fest, and to transmit. To perform also means, though often more secretly, to reinvent. This claim is especially relevant to the performances that flourish within the geohistorical matrix of the circum-Atlantic world. Bounded by Europe, Africa, and the Americas, North and South, this economic and cul‑ tural System entailed v a s t m o v e m e n t s of people and commodities to exper‑ imental destinations, the consequences of which continue to visit them‑ selves upon the material and human fabric of the cities inhabited by their successors.

At crucial stages of the research, I received valuable assistance from staff members at several libraries and archives: Fred Hoxie at the D’Arcy McNickle Center for the History of the American Indian at the Newberry Library; Russell Maylone at Northwestern University Special Collections; Jude Solomon at the His‑ toric N e w Orleans Collection; and the staff of the Amistad Research Cen‑ t e r at Tulane University, including Fred Stielow and Brenda B.

At Tulane’s Howard-Tilton Memorial Library, Bill Meneray and Courtney Page of Special Collections, Leon Miller, Helen Burkes, and Mary Leblanc of Manuscripts, Sylvia Metzinger of Rare Books, Joan Caldwell and Richard Campbell of the Louisiana Collection, and Bruce Raeburn, Alma Williams, and Diane Rose of the William Ransom Hogan Jazz Archive prO‑ vided many hours of expert guidance. They did so with unfailing profes‑ sionalism, even though the range of materials that I requested must have seemed eccentric at the very least.

But more often than not, they also propose to replace the recently departed by asking those remaining behind to enhance their per‑ formances. These performances then constitute rites of memory in honor of the artificially superannuated. I n t o the professional and social places they once occupied step the anxious survivors, who n o w feel obliged more or less to reinvent themselves, taking into a c c o u n t the roles played by their prede‑ cessors. As a lifelong theater person, I take a keen interest in the imposition of such histrionics on civilian life. They bring to mind theatrical t e r m s such ascasting and miscasting, script and improvisation, memory and imagina‑ tion. In addition to the ample opportunities for overwork that such policies often provide, they may also entail the demanding psychological obligations of double consciousness, the self-reflexive interaction of identity and role. The all‐too-familiar practice of downsizing by attrition, however, takes advantage of a much more powerful underlying phenomenon. Even when financial exigencies do n o t dictate retrenchment, a process goes on normally that is very much like the one that administrations impose in a pinch.

I have noticed. for instance, that when death or retirement removes a colleague from a c o m m u ‑ nity asinterdependent asan academic department, despite the conventional panegyrics attesting to the fact that he or she can never be replaced. o n e or more of the survivors will m o v e in to take over, overtly or covertly, the posi‑ tions vacated by the decedent. These positions will m o r e often prove to be the emotional and psychological nodal points within the human dynamics of the community, though they may encompass the intellectual ones as Well. Consciously or unconsciously, e v e n the big shoes will g e t filled, but rarely by the new person hired asa replacement. I am n o t the only o n e among my acquaintances to have remarked on this phenomenon. The speed at which roles can change hands prompted a r e c e n t retiree I know to define the S t a t u s of professor emeritus as“forgotten but n o t gone.” While savoring this witty inversion of the spurious immortality routinely granted by eulogiSts’ I have also been pondering its double meaning, the real functions of Social Conti‑ unity and cultural preservation that it suggests. As he was. fading aWay, my retiring colleague stumbled over the paradox of collective PerPetUation: memory isaprocess that depends crucially onforgetting. This book, in fact, takes up the three-Sided relationship of met-“Cry, p e r ‑ formance and substitution. In it I propose to examine h o w CUlture repro‑ duces and re‐creates itself by a process that can be best described by the word surrogation. In the life of a community, the process of surrogation does n o t begin or end but continues as actual or perceived v a c a n c t e s Occur in the network of relations that constitutes the social fabric. I n t o the cavities Cre ated by loss through death or other forms of departure, I hYPOthesize, S m ‑\n\nvivors attempt to fit satisfactory alternates. Because collective memoTy works selectively, imaginatively, and often perversely, surrogation rarely if ever succeeds. The process requires many trials and at least as many ErrorS. The fit cannot be exact. The intended substitute either c a n n o t fulfil] eXpe rations, creating a deficit, or actually exceeds them, creating a sul'PluS_ Thec. t o o the surrogate-elect may prove to bea divisive choice, one around Whey: factions polarize,or the prospective nominee may tap deep motives of p r e ‑ udice and fear, sothat even before the fact the unspoken possibility of his 011' her candidacy incites phobic anxiety. Finally, the very uncanniness of the process of surrogation, which tends to disturb the complacency of a11 thoughtful incumbents, may provoke many unbidden emOfiOHS, ranging from mildly incontinent sentimentalism to raging paranoia. As ambivalence deepens before the specter of inexorable antiquation, even the necessary\n\nH H I O R L M L ‘ J O R Y. . - \\ N I ) P E R F O R M A N C E\n\npreparations of the likely successors may alienate the affections of the officeholders‐all the m o r e powerfully when social or cultural differences exacerbate generational ones. At these times, improvised narratives of authenticity and priority may congeal into full-blown myths of legitimacy and origin. In the likely e v e n t that one or more of the above calamities occurs, selec‑ tive memory requires public enactments of forgetting, either to blur the obvious discontinuities, misalliances, and ruptures or, more desperately, to exaggerate them in order to mystify a previous Golden Age, n o w lapsed. In such dramas of sacrificial substitution, the derivation of the word personal‑ ity from mas/t eerily doubles that of tragedy from goat. I believe that the process of trying o u t various candidates in different situations‐the doomed search for originals by continuously auditioning stand-ins‐is the m o s t important of the many meanings that users intend when they say the word performance. Competing definitions do proliferate. In his etymological account, anthropologist Victor Turner traces performance to the Old French word parfoumir, meaning “to furnish forth,” “to complete,” or “to carry o u t thor‑ oughly” (From Ritualto Tlzeatre, r3). Ethnolinguist Richard Bauman, in his concise entry in the InternationalEncyclopedia of Communications, locates the meaning of performance in the actual execution of an action as opposed to its potential (3:262‐66), a meaning that operates in the theatrical performance of a script, in an automobile ’5performance on the test track, or in parole’s performance of langue. Theorist and director Richard Schechner, who has advanced the m o s t focused and at the same time the mosr widely applicable definition of performance, calls it \"restored behavior” or “twice-behaved behavior,” by which he actually means behavior that “is always subject to revision,” behavior that m u s t be reinvented the second time or “the nth time” because it cannot happen exactly the same way twice, even though in some instances the “constancy of transmission” across many generations may be “astonishing” (Between Theater and Anthropology, 36‐37; cf. Bau‑ man and Briggs; Hymes). These three definitions of performance‐‐that it carries o u t purposes thoroughly, that it actualizes a potential, or that it restores abehavior‐commonly assume that performance offers a substi‑ t u t e for something else that preexists it. Performance, in other words, stands in for an elusive entity that it is n o t but that it m u s t vainly aspire both to embody and to replace. Hence flourish the abiding yet vexed affinities between performance and memory, o u t of which blossom the m o s t florid\n\n4\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y.

I w a n t to contextualize its processes within a specific though very extensive historic and material continuum. The research strategies I favor emphasize the comparative approach to the tlie_ atrical, musical, and ritual traditions of many cultures. To that agenda, how‑ ever, I would add the qualification of historical contingency: first, the inter‑ cultural communication that certain performances enabled at specific times and places; and second, the internal cultural self-definition that these and other performances produced by making Visible the play of differenCe and identity within the larger ensemble of relations.\n\nCircum-Atlantic M e m o r y Both intercultural and internally self-referential occasions of Performance mark the connected places and times that constitute what I arn calling, as the geohistorical locale for my thesis about memory assubstitution, the cit-cum~ Atlantic world. Asit emerged from the revolutionized economies of the late seventeenth c e n t u r y, this world resembled avortex m Whmh commodities and cultural practices changed hamds many tilineSdThe molst revolutionary commodity in this economy was human fles , an n o t on y because s]ave labor produced huge quantities of the addictive substances (Sugar, Coffee, tobacco, and-‐‐most insidiouslywsugar and chocolatein combination) that transformed the world economy and financed the industrial revolufio (Mintz). The concept of acircum‐Atlantic world (as opposed to a transatn lantic one) insists on the centrality of the diasporic and gen0cidal historje_ of Africa and the Americas, North and South, in the creation of the culmrs of modernity. In this sense, a N e w World was n o t discovered in th: Caribbean, but one was truly invented there. Newness enacts a kind of S u r ‑ rogation‐in the invention of a new England or a n e w France O u r of the memories of the old‐but it also conceptually erases indigenouS Popula‑ tions, contributing to amentality conducive to the practical implemehtation of the American Holocaust (Stannard). While a great deal of the unspeak_ able violence instrumental to this creation may have been officially {Orgon ten, circum-Atlantic memory retains its consequences, one of which is that the unspeakable cannot be rendered forever inexpressible: the m o s t persis‑ t e n t mode of forgetting is memory imperfectly deferred.\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y. A N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\nFor this region‐centered conception, which locates the peoples of the Caribbean r i m at the heart of an oceanic interculture embodied through performance, I am indebted to Paul Gilroy’s formulation of the “Black Atlantic.” In three prescient books, “There Ain’t No Black in the Union jack”: The Cultural Politics of Race and Nation (I987), T/ze Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness (1993), and Small Acts: T[mug/m on the Politics of Black Culture: (1993), Gilroy expands the cultural horizons of modern history in a way that does n o t begin and end at national borders but charts its course along the dark currents of a world economy that slavery once propelled: “A n e w s t r u c t u r e of cultural exchange,” he writes, “has been built up across the imperial networks which once played host to the tri‑ angular trade of sugar, slaves and capital” (Union jack, 157). The idea of circum-Atlantic cultural exchange does n O t deny Eurocolonial initiatives their place in this history‐indeed,it m u s t newly reconsider and interrogate them‐but it regards the results of those initiatives as the insufficiently acknowledged cocreations of an oceanic interculture. This interculture shares in the contributions of many peoples along the Atlantic r i m ‐ f o r example, Bambara, Iroquois, Spanish, English, Aztec, Yoruba, and French. I argue in this book that the scope of the circum-Atlantic interculture may be discerned m o s t vividly by means of the performances, performance t r a ‑ ditions, and the representations of performance that it engendered. This is true, I think, because performances so often carry within them the memory\n\nof otherwise forgotten substitutions‐those that were rejected and, even more invisibly, those that have succeeded. The key to understanding how performances worked within a culture, recognizing that a fixed and unified culture exists only asa convenient but dangerous fiction, is to illuminate the process of surrogation asit operated between the participating cultures. The key, in other words, is to understand how circum‐Atlantic societies, confronted with revolutionary circum‑ stances for which few precedents existed, have invented themselves by per‑ forming their pasts in the presence of others. They could n o t perform them‑ selves, however, unless they also performed what and who they thought they were n o t . By defining themselves in opposition to others, they prO‑ duced mutual representations from encomiums to caricatures, sometimes in each another’s presence, at other times behind each other’s backs. In the very form of minstrelsy, for example, as Eric L o t t suggests in Love and leefi: Blackfizce Minstrelgy and the American Working Class (1993), there resides the deeply seated and potentially threatening possibility of involun‑\n\n5\n\n6\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y . A N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\ntary surrogation through the a c t of performance. \"Mimicry,\" writes H o m i K. Bhabha, “is at once resemblance and menace” (86). This is so because,\n\nas parody, performances propose possible candidates for succession. They raise the possibility of the replacement of the authors of the repre‑ sentations by those whom they imagined into existence as their definitive opposites. A number of important consequences ensue from this c u s t o m of self. definition by staging c o n t r a s t s with other races, cultures, and ethnicities. Identity and difference c o m e into play (and i n t o question) simultaneously and coextensively. The process of surrogation continues, but it does so in a climate of heightened anxiety that outsiders will somehow succeed in replacing the original peoples, or autochthons. This process is unstoppable even\n\nbecause candidates for surrogation m u s t be tested at the margins of a cul‑ t u r e to bolster the fiction that it has a core. That is why the surrogated dou‑ ble so often appears as alien to the culture that reproduces it and that it reproduces. That is why the relentless search for the purity of Origins is a voyage n o t of discovery but of erasure. The anxiety generated by the process of substitution justifies the C o m ‑ plicity of memory and forgetting. In the face of this anxiety~a mOmentary self-consciousness about surrogation that c o n s t i t u t e s What might Pass for reflexivity‐-‐the alien double may appear inimernory only to disappear That disappearance does n o t diminish its contribunonsto cultural definitior; and preservation; rather, it enables them. Without failures of memory to obscure the mixtures, blends, and provisional antitypes necessary to its Proa duction, for example, “whiteness,” one of the major scenic elements of Sev eral circum‐Atlantic performance traditions, could n o t exiSt even asPerjul. ‑ n o r could there flourish more narrowly defined, subordinate deSigns Such y, «Anglo-Saxon Liberty.” Even the immaculate “guardian angels” Who Sihas\n\nthe chorus of divine origin in James Thompson’s “Rule Britannia,” f example, must have recourse to a concept charged with high antithetic: seriousness to rhyme with “waves.” In Playing in t/ze Dark. W/‘itmes; a n d t/ze Literary Imagination (1992), Toni Morrison interprets the angelic Chorus exactly: “The concept of freedom did n o t emerge in a Vacuum. Nothing highlighted freedom‐if it did n o t in fact c r e a t e 1t‐like slavery” (38), On the one hand, forgetting, like miscegenation, is an opportunistic t a c ‑ tic of whiteness. As a Yoruba proverb puts it: “The white man who made the pencil also made the eraser.” On the other hand, the v a s t scale of the project of whiteness‐‐-and the scope of the contacts among cultures it r e q u i r e d ‑\n\nH I S T O R L M E M O R Y. \\ N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\nlimited the degree to which its foils could be eradicated from the memory of those who had the deepest motivation and the s u r e s t means to forget them. At the same time, however, it fostered complex and ingenious schemes to displace, refashion, and transfer those persistent memories into representa‑ tions m o r e amenable to those who m o s t frequently wielded the pencil and the eraser. In that sense, circum-Atlantic performance is a monumental study in the pleasures and t o r m e n t s of incomplete forgetting. But more obdurate questions persist: Whose forgetting? \\Vhose memory? Whose\n\nhistory?\n\nLocations and Bearings Because anything like what might be called coverage of the possible inclu‑ sions under the rubric of circum-Atlantic performance would bebeyond the imaginable scope of this volume (or many), I have settled here on the explo‑ ration of particular historical formations at specific times at t w o sites, L o n ‑\n\ndon and N e w Orleans. Though r e m o t e from one another in obvious respects‐antiquity, climate, and cuisine spring quickly to mind‐these places are n o t arbitrarily selected. As river-sited ports of entry linking inte‑ rior lines of communication to sea lanes, London and N e w Orleans have histories joined at a pivotal m o m e n t in the colonial rivalry of francophone and anglophone interests as they collided in the late seventeenth and eigh‑ teenth centuries in North America and the West Indies. Historians have stressed the importance of the conflict between Great Britain and France on sea and land‐the “whale” against the “elephant”‐in the forging of mod‑ e r n nation‐states and “Great Powers” (Colley, i, quoting Kennedy, 160). These European interests, however, were intimately connected with Amerindian and African ones. A significant body of recent historical and ethnohistorical research has reexamined those latter interests as dynamic and inventive (rather than inert) in the face of Eurocolonial expansion. My selective history of circum-Atlantic performance draws heavily on this ren‑ 0vated scholarship of e n c o u n t e r and exchange. The great Iroquois Confederacy, for instance‐a creation of centuries of Forest Diplomacy‐negotiated through brilliant intercultural perfor‑ mances the Covenant Chain 0f trade and military alliances that linked the fur-producing hinterlands of the vast Great Lakes region to the thinly held European enclaves of the eastern seaboard (Axtell; Dennis; Jennings, Iro‑ quOi‘“ Diplomacy; Richter). In “Culture Theory in Contemporary Ethnohis‑\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y. A N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\ntory” (1988), William S.Simmons describes these diplomatic and trade rela‑ tions as “ a n interaction and confrontation between a u t o n o m o u s social enti‑ ties, rather than asa one‐sided playing o u t of Eurocolonial myths of mani‑ fest destiny” (6). Iroquois played a significant and self-promoting role in the geometric proliferation of wealth centered in the triangular trade: c a r ‑ ryinga different cargo along each leg of the Atlantic triangle comprising the Americas (raw materials), Europe (manufactured goods), and Africa (human beings), the holds of merchant ships never had to cross blue W a t e r empty. The consequences of the ensuing material productions a r e incalcu‑ lable; the mother of hemispheric superstructural invention, they provide a common matrix for the diversified performance genres to which this book is devoted. Even for the largest system, however, heuristic opportunity, like God or the Devil, is in the details. O n e site of circum‐Atlantic memory that I p r o ‑ pose to excavate is located in London in 1710, during the performance-rich state visit to Queen Anne '5 c o u r t by four Iroquois “Kings.” AmOng other public exhibitions and entertainments, a staging of S i r William Davenam’5 operatic version of Shakespeare’s Mac-bet}: honored their embassy, a perfor‑ mance during which their hosts insisted that the Native Americans be placed in full view onstage (Bond, 3‐4). Such an imposition need n o t have been as alien or asintimidating as might be supposed. Experienced in Staging C 0 “ dolence Councils, those great intersocietal mourning and Peace rituals th ‑ mediated among Dutch, French, English, and diverse Algonquian a“d 11- at_ quoian interests, the Mohawks referred to themselves as anckwei «.th o People.” Assuch, they believed themselves descended from Deganaiigelal a\n\nthe semidivine peacemaker who, with the aid of Hiawatha, overcame Wit h craft and the cyclical violence of feuding clans to establish the Great Lea C ~ of Peace and Power. Thereafter the league existed to settle grievanCeS Cgue dole losses, and negotiate alliances through gift exchange and ritual Pérfom mance of speeches, songs, and dances (Richter, 30‐49). The Kings eameo to r‑ London to promote the Anglo-Iroquois invasion of French Canada in the interests of the fur trade, and they arrived at a decisive moment dUri“g the War of the Spanish Succession, when events were leading up to the T l‘eaties of Utrecht in 1713‐14‑ According to lee New Cambridge Modern History, the watershed Peace of Utrecht‐whereby Great Britain acquired the coveted Asiento the monopoly onthe slave trade in the Spanish West Indies‐“marks the pass‑ ing of the Mediterranean asthe centre of world trade and power rivalries\n\nH I S T O R Y. M F M O R Y. A N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\n[when] attention shifted to the Atlantic” (Bromley, 571). Alfred Thayer Mahan, summarizing the Wa r of the Spanish Succession in The Influence of Sea Power Upon Hirzogl (1890), the m o s t materially influential work of aca‑ demic theory written in the past century, describes its consequences: “Before that w a r England was one of the sea powers; after it she was the sea power, without any second” (225). In the festival panegyric th'na'sor-Forest (1713), a poetical celebration of the Peace of Utrecht, Alexander Pope imag‑ ined the glorious deforestation of rural England in the cause of maritime empire:\n\nThy Trees, fair Windsor! n o w shall leave their Woods, And Half thy Forests rush into my Floods, Bear Britain’s Thunder, and her Cross display, To the bright Regions of the rising Day. (Poems 1:189)\n\nTo the dancelike numbers of lVinalror-Forest, which record the embassy of the “Feather’d People,” I will r e t u r n in a later chapter on the representation of performances of e n c o u n t e r at the time of the Treaties of Utrecht. The geopolitical advantages w o n by Great Britain in this general peace and the supremacy that the Royal Navy had attained motivated the French to attempt to consolidate their position in North America, including strategic development of the territory bearing the name of Louis X I V. They did this in part by situating a fortified city in Louisiana near the mouth of the Mis‑ sissippi River, roughly equidistant along w a t e r r o u t e s between Canada and their island possessions in the West Indies, demarcating a great arc of Gal‑ lic entitlement arrayed to contest further trans-Appalachian expansion by the Anglo-Americans and the Real PeOple. We n o w know that success did n o t ultimately crown the French grand strategy. But in the meantime, contemporaneously with the apogee of the North American Covenant Chain, the French in colonial Louisiana relo‑ cated significant numbers of West Africans, principally Bambara, from one African regional interculture, Senegambia, into an area already possessing highly developed Amerindian performance cultures. Circumstances favored the reciprocal acculturation of Creoles of various lineages within a unique network of African, American, and European practices. These included mortuary rituals, carnival festivities, and a multitude of musical and dance forms that others would eventually describe (and appropriate) under the rubric of jazz. At the same time, the Africans brought with them\n\nIO\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y. A N D I ’ E R F ( ) R M . ‘ \\ N ( ‘ F\n\nvital necessities such as skilled agriculture: “The survival of French Louisiana,” writes Gwendolyn Midlo Hall in her magistcrial 4 m m , ” in ColonialLouisiana: The Development of Afio- Creole Culture in II“: Ely/[wan]; Century (1992), “was due n o t only to African labor but also to African tech‑ nology” (121). Under the superimpositions of slavery, as well as around its fringes beyond the margins of the aprie‘re (swamp), there flourished a pow‑ erful culture that reinvented Africa‐and ultimately America‐within the only apparently impermeable interstices of European forms. In that respect, Louisiana participated in the formation of the complex identities of [ h e c i r ‑ cum-Caribbean rim (Fiehrer), even asit negotiated its incremental assimi‑ lation into the hypothetical monoculture of Anglo North America, The other main site that I explore, then, is located in the records of the long “Americanization” (that is, Anglification and Africanization) of L a t i n N e w Orleans, a process that begins before the Louisiana Purchase in 180; and continues to be reenacted in the s t r e e t s of this performance.saturated city today (Carter; Hirsch and Logsdon). A principal public instrument of this reenactment remains Mardi Gras, nominally a French cultural residue which long ago was appropriated by so many competing interests of eth: nicity, nationality, class, race, religion, gender, and c a s t e that its meaning can be assessed appropriately only in relationship to other genres of Cir‑ cum-Atlantic and Caribbean performance (Kinser; Mitchell; M. Smith, Mardi Gras Indians). Through its complex hierarchy of ritualiZed m emory. Mardi Gras stages an annual spectacle of cultural surrogaticms’ in eluding the multilayered imbrication of carnivalesque license, Symbolic marches by descendants of Afro-Amerindian Maroons, and the discul‘sive claims of “Anglo-Saxon Liberty” as realized in float parades and debutante balls. The history of performance in N e w Orleans supports the wisdom of the exhortation that opens Hall’s account of African Louisiana; «I.NathTlal history, m u s t be transcended, and colonial history treated Within a l . context” (xii). g Obd]\n\nMaterials and Methods The various contributors to Question: of Evidence: Proof; Practice, and P suasz'on Across t/ze Dirczplz'nes (1991), a compendium of essays Original?‑ published in CriticalInquiry, explore the interdisciplinary dimensions of th: issues set forth in the editors’ introduction: “the configuratio“ of the facr‑ evidence distinction in different disciplines and historical moments”\n\nH I S T O R ‘ . M E M O R Y. A N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\n(Chandler, Davidson, and Harootunian. 2). By creating a category called “circum‐Atlantic performance” that intentionally c u t s across disciplinary boundaries and the conventional subcategories and periodizations within them, I have incurred an obligation to be explicit about the materials and methods‐the evidence‐‐I have used to imagine what that category entails. One important strategy of performance research today is to juxtapose living memory asrestored behavior against a historical archive of scripted records (Balme). In the epigraph at the head of this chapter from his History and Memory (1992), Jacques Le Goff sets o u t the variety of mnemonic materials‐speech, images, gestures‐that supplement or c o n t e s t the authority of “documents” in the historiographic tradition of the French annalzlrtes (xvii). Their v a s t projects‐for instance, histories of private life, histories of death, or histories of memory itself‐attend especially to those performative practices that maintain (and invent) human continuities, leav‑ ing their traces in diversified media, including the living bodies of the suc‑ cessive generations that sustain different social and cultural identities (Aries; Nora). Summarizing the fruits of research into the transmission of culture in societies distinguished by different modalities of communication, Le Goff identifies “three major interests” of those “without writing”: (1) myth, par‑ ticularly myths of origin; (2) genealogies, particularly of leading families; and (3) practical formulas of daily living and special Observances, particu‑ larly those “deeply imbued with religious magic” (58). While acknowledg‑ ing the preliminary usefulness of such formulations, typically organized under the portmanteau concept of orality, performance studies goes on to question the assumption that the “interests” Le Goff defines do n o t also manifest themselves in societies “with writing”‐and, for that matter, in those with print, electronic media, and mass communications (Conquer‑ good; Schechner, The Future of Ritual; Taussig). Performance studies com‑ plicates the familiar dichotomy between speech and writing with what Kenyan novelist and director Ngugi wa Thiong’o calls “orature.” Orature comprises a range of forms, which, though they may invest themselves var‑ iously in gesture, song, dance, processions, storytelling, proverbs, gossip, customs, rites, and rituals, are nevertheless produced alongside or within mediated literacies of various kinds and degrees. In other words, o r a t u r e goes beyond a schematized opposition of literacy and orality as t r a n s c e n ‑ dent categories; rather, it acknowledges that these modes of communication have produced one another interactively over time and that their historic\n\nll\n\n[2\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y. A N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\noperations may be usefully examined under the rubric of performance, Ngugi defines the power of orarure in collective memory aphoristically: “ H e is a s w e e t singer when everybody joins in. The s w e e t songs last longer, too” (61; cf. Finnegan; Okpewho; Zumthor).\n\nThe historical implications of the concept of o r a t u r e , though n o t neces‑ sarily under that name, have engaged the attention of scholars in a number of disciplines. In a r e c e n t study of the role of theatricaliry in the early c u ] ‑ tural history of the United States, for instance, Declaring Independence;jef‑ ferron, NaturalLanguage, andt/ze Culture of Performance (1993), jay Fliege!‑ man begins with the significant but long-neglected facr that the Declaration of Independence was just t h a t ‐ a script written to be spoken aloud as o r a ‑ t o r y. He goes on to document the elocutionary dimension of AngIO-Amer‑ ican self-invention, which Thomas Jefferson himself defined in comparison to the expressive speech of Native Americans, on the one hand, and Africans, on the other (98, ‘92)- Under the Cl?“ scrutiny 0f circum‑ Atlantic memory, no material event, Spoken or w r i t t e n , can remain “pure,\" despite Jefferson’s special pleading for the revival of Anglo~Sax0n as the primal tongue of essential law and liberty (Frantzen, 203‐7). That the chant of the Declaration of Independence calls on the spirits of Jefferson’s Anglo-Saxon ancestors to authorize his claims‐to inalienable rights, including the right to revolt against tyranny‐recalls the ritual of freedom described by C. L. R. James in lee Blackjacobz'ns: Toussaz'nt L ’Ou‑ venture and the San Domingo Revolution (1938): Carrying torches to light their way, the leaders of the revolt m e t in an open space in the thick forests of the Morne Rouge, a mountain O Ve r ‑ looking Le Cap. There Boukman gave the last instructions and, afte Voodoo incantations and the sucking of the blood of a Stuck pig, h: stimulated his followers by a prayer spoken in creole, which, like So much spoken on such occasions, has remained. “The god Who “Gated the sun which gives us light . . . orders us to revenge our Wmngs, H will direct our arms and aid us. Throw away the symbol 0f the g o d 0: the whites who has so often caused us to weep, and listen to the V0ice of liberty, which speaks in the hearts of us all.” (37)\n\nEndowed by their Creator with liberty, whose voice spoke thmugh them, the Haitians set about the task of altering and abolishing their gOVErnment with spoken words, which they then took the trouble to write down. Taking cognizance of the interdependence of o r a t u r e and literature, the\n\nl i l h l ’ O R L M E M O R Y. A N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\nmaterials of the present study are thematized under categories of those restored behaviors that function as vehicles of cultural transmission. Each category pairs a form of collective memory with the e n a c t m e n t s that embody it through performance: death and burials, violence and sacrifices, laws and (dis)obedience, commodification and auctions, origins and segre‑ gation. All of these may be written about, of course, but even the laws need n o t have been written down. They remain partially recorded in the litera‑ ture, but they are actually remembered and put into practice through o r a ‑ ture, a practice that may be prolonged, supplemented, or revised by printed and photographic representations of the performance e v e n t s . Although these thematic materials are broadly conceived in the ampli‑ tude of circum-Atlantic relations, my method is to study them at narrowly delimited sites. My observations of the street performances of Mardi Gras in N e w Orleans, for instance, have been accumulating since 1991. That was the last year in which the m o s t traditional of the old-line carnival “krewes” paraded: the passage of a new civil rights ordinance by the N e w Orleans City Council in December of that year gave the century-and-a-half‐old men’s clubs the choice of desegregating their membership or staying home (Flake; Vennman, “Boundary Face-Off”). The assertion of legal control over carnival by the City of N e w Orleans revived memories of the carnival krewes’ central role in planning and executing the armed overthrow of the racially integrated government of William Pitt Kellogg in 1874. Known to historians as “the Battle of Liberty Place,” this was in fact a bloody riot incited by a race-baiting elite. The ordinance controversy, played o u t for three years in the council chambers and the media as well as in the streets and running concurrently with the sudden political rise of Klansman David Duke, burst open a deep, suppurating sore that festers in local memory more poisonously than history can write. The method of observation that I employ takes its cue from “Walking in the City,” an essay included in the “Spatial Practices” section of Michel de Certeau’s Practice of Everyday Life (1984). \" To walk,” de Certeau notes, “is to lack a place” (103). But to walk is also to gain an experience of the cityscape that is conducive to mapping the emphases and contradictions of its Special memory (Boyer; Kirshenblatt-Gimblett). De Certeau looks for key points of articulation between human behavior and the built environ‑ ment, noting the “pedestrian speech acts\" uttered by authors “whose bodies follow the thicks and thins of an urban ‘text’ they write without being able to read i t ” (93). Quotidian “speech acts” offer a rich assortment of year‑\n\n'3\n\nI4\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y.

As Willie Pajaud, longtime trumpeter for the Eureka Brass Band, once put it: “I’d rather play a funeral than e a t a turkey dinner.\" Ani‑ mated by a “joyful noise,” supported in many instances by the testimony of deep, spirit-world faith, the dead seem to remain more closely present to the living in New Orleans than they doelsewhere‐and n o t only because they are traditionally interred in tombs above ground. Walking in the city makes this audible. Read in the c o n t e x t created by the sounds and sights of these restored behaviors, then, the documents concerning the London visit of the Iroquois Kings take onanew and different kind of life. In addition to the various per‑ formances they attended while in London‐a puppet show, a cockfight, a military review, a concert, aShakespearean tragedy‐the Native Americans created other events by their spectacular passages through the streets (Altick). They swept up those walking through the city in impromptu festi‑\n\n'5\n\n16\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y . A N D P E R F O R M A N F E\n\nvals: “When the four Indian Kings w e r e in this Country about :1Twelve‑ month ago,” Joseph Addison recalled, speaking through the persona of M r . Spectator, “I often mix’d with the Rabble and followed them a whole D a y together, being wonderfully struck with the Sight of every thing that is n e w or uncommon” (1:211). Addison’s ambiguous modifier‐who is being struck with n e w sights here? The Kings? The Rabble? M r. S p e c t a t o r ? ‑ stages What might be termed the “ethnographic surrealism” of this circum‑ Atlantic e v e n t (Clifford). O n e important reason why popular performance events entered into the records at this time in greater detail than is Usual for such ephemera is that the Kings attended a number of them, While their invited presence at others w a s heavily advertised to boost attendance. The daily repertoires of the t w o official theaters, D r u r y Lane and the Queen’s Theatre, Haymarket, are particularly worthy of attention in this regard. In addition to the performance of Macbeth at which the Kings w ere present, t w o other revivals held pointed circum-Atlantic interest: . t h n Dryden’s The Indian Emperour; o r, The Conquest of Mexico by [ h e SPaniard; (1665) and Thomas Southerne’s Oroonoko; o r, The Royal Slaw (16 94). At :1 time of institutional canonization of Shakespeare as the national 1) Get, how‑ ever, n o t all the relevant high-culture performances took place Onstage (G Taylor; Dobson). On the s a m e day that the Native Americgms departe . from England, the great Shakespearean a c t o r Thomas Betterton Was buried in Westminster Abbey. H i s passing held an epoch-marking meaning f (1 many, including Richard Steele, who published a eulogy in The Tat/er. B 01‑ terton’s fifty-year career spanned the reigns of Charles 11’ James etc William and Mary, and Queen Anne; and Steele remarks on the edif .II, spectacle of attending this “last Office” (2:422). The breadth of the adleng of this eulogy, which begins with “Men of Letters and Educaticm” a ress quickly enlarges to embrace all “Free-born People” (2:423), h' - the“ powers Steele once attributed to Betterton’s moving, speaking bOdy i n life but now invests in the stillness of his corpse. That is the POWer of sum‑ moning an imagined community into being. The hailing of the “Fr\n\nborn,” in their role as enthusiasts for enactments of “what is g r e a t ac: noble in Human Nature” by those who “speak justly, and move gracefulln» (2:422‐23), is piquantly juxtaposed to the critique of social and musicyal cacophony in the immediately preceding number of The Tatler, which ends with anunfavorable allusion to “the Stamping Dances of the West Indian: or Hottentats” (2:421). Steele’s account of Betterton’s funeral demonstrates the importance of\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y. A N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\nl e e Tatler and Spectator to the way in which I am trying to understand the role of performance in circum‐Atlantic memory. In Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (r983; rev. [991), Bene‑ dict Anderson stresses the role of printed media in the vernacular, particu‑ larly the newspaper, in the formation of modern national consciousness o u t of dynastic, feudal, and sacred communities (33‐36). Like the obsequies performed at tombs of the Unknown Soldier, which Anderson also high‑ lights (9), the burial of an actor, apractitioner of a despised profession, in the cathedral of English dynastic memory suggests a cultural use of m a r ‑ ginal identities to imagine a n e w kind of community. Attending such a rit‑ ual performance asa friend of the deceased, Steele the pioneering journal‑ ist grasped‐or created‐its significance asnational news. Steele and Addison characteristically turned local performances into print, for circulation among an expanding audience of readers, and then print into performances, for the edification of many more listeners who heard the papers read aloud in public places. The innovative effects of this form of o r a t u r e have been convincingly demonstrated on one side of the Atlantic by Michael G. Ketcham in Transparent Desigm: Reading, Perfor‑ mance, and Form in the Spectator Papers (1985) and on the other by Michael Warner in The Letters oft/1e Republic: Publication and the Public Sp/tere in Eighteenth‐Century America (1990). Reports of the authorial deaths of Addison and Steele would seem to have been exaggerated (McCrea). The‑ a t e r historians, however, attempting to r e c o n s t r u c t the acting of Betterton and others from accounts in lee Tatler and The Spectator, have excerpted and anthologized only the choice descriptive passages concerning the stage. To a historian who views theater in the c o n t e x t of many kinds of perfor‑ mance, such passages take on a more robust life when they are returned to their original place among the wonderful peripatetic observations of the various restored behaviors of Augustan London.\n\nThe Everlasting Club Addison and Steele report on walking in the city. By way of preliminary demonstration of my method, I will attempt here to make a similar kind of report on N e w Orleans. Fortunately for me, no one will ever be able to say for sure which of o u r hallucinations, theirs or mine, does the greatest injus‑ tice to the fabulous object of its incitement. In his paper for Wednesday, May 23, 1711 (No. 72), M r. Spectator con‑\n\n17\n\n[8\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y. A N D PERFORMANFI-L\n\ntinues his a c c o u n t of clubs, ancient and modern. Clubs, with their continu‑\n\nously renegotiated boundaries of exclusion, exemplify the smaller a t o m s of affiliation through which larger societies may be constructed. M r. Spectator reports on the “surprising” constitution of o n e London club in particular, “the EVERLASTING CLUB.” This venerable association n e v e r ceases to func‑ tion, day or night, weekdays or holidays, all the days of the year, “ n o Party presumingto rise till they are relieved by those who a r e in course to succeed them” (1:308‐9).

Originally known as the “The Tramps,” the working-class African Americans who founded Zulu took their inspiration from a staged minstrel number, “There Never Was and Never Will Bea King Like Me” (Kinser, 233). They parade on Mardi Gras morning, using the same r o u t e along St. Charles Avenue that Rex fol‑ lows an hour or so later. They wear grass skirts and blackface laid on thick over anunderlying layer of clown white circling the eyes and mouth. In addition to plastic beads, Zulu members throw decorated coconuts, for many parade goers the m o s t highly prized “throw” of Mardi Gras. Every year there is a n e w Rex and a new King Zulu, and every year they are sup‑ posed to look and a c t asthey always have.

Their silence intensified the imagery whereby they perfOrmed toga‑ pasts in one another’s faces, a cruel hyperbolic mirror, but Polarity didthelr constitute symmetry. Behind the gestic speech a c t s of Rex Stood n o t ambiguous tradition of the European carnivalesque, which might at l the appear to overthrow social authority momentarily (Bakhtin, Raéezm-J eaSt His World) but which also might just as well serve to conceal its ever mam! powerful reassertion under the mask of festivity (Le Roy Ladurie’ Camlzrel in Romans). Also behind Rex stood more than a century of white Suprem: cist entitlement, the residue of what I will be calling a genealogy of Peffor‑ mance. Behind King Zulu there stood something much m o r e complicated: a deconstruction of that white genealogy and the veiled assertion of a clan‑ destine countermemory in its stead.\n\nH I S T O R Y. M E M O R Y. A N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\nTo see how this semiotic t o u r de force works, the beholder m u s t first understand that the members of both everlasting clubs, Rex and Zulu, rep‑ r e s e n t whiteness and perform whiteface minstrelsy. Rex speaks for himself: of his 1992 parade, entitled “Voyages of Discovery” in honor of the quin‑ centennial year, the King of Carnival stated, “We would have had a black explorer, but we couldn't find any” (quoted in Vennman, “Boundary Face-Of ,” 76). Thus did Rex in his o w n way‐by performinga demean‑ ing comic stereotype of the white amnesiac‐honor the memory of the Haitian creole explorer, Jean-Baptiste Point Du Sable, in the city from which he m o s t probably departed to found Chicago (Bennett, 96‐101). B u t the question remains asto why Zulu has walked such a thin line between ridiculing and reinforcing the race-conscious imagery that Mardi Gras fes‑ tivities perpetually reinvoke. Walking between the t w o parades along the “neutral ground” of St. Charles Avenue, I thought the answer seemed plainly visible in the performance: Zulu seizes on the annual occasion of the great festive holiday of Eurocentric tradition to make ribald fun of white folks and the stupidity of their jury-rigged constructions of race (figures 1.4 and 1.5). As the parades collided, Zulu’s bone-wielding “Witch Doctor” evoked the legends of cannibalism that permeate a c c o u n t s of circum-Atlantic e n c o u n t e r s (Hulme, Jehlen), especially a s they relate t o the invention o f Africa (Mudimbe). This Africa is the dystopia of racist fantasy, valuable as an antitype to help the xenophobic European tribes exaggerate distinctions among themselves: “Africa,\" runs the tired old British slur on the French, “begins at Calais.” Introduced in the decade after Plexsy v. Ferguson, amid the triumph of Southern Redemption and its explosive mania about race, King Zulu t u r n s Rex n o t so much upside down as inside o u t . The white greasepaint under his blackface discloses an acute reflexivity in the way that Zulu, laughing behind the mask of apparent self-deprecation, repro‑ duces a kind of Africa by mocking absurd Eurocentric stereotypes of divine kingship. As whiteface minstrelsy, however, Zulu has layers within layers, and behind the visible mask of carnivalesque satire there is a practice of dis‑ ruptive humor that introduces another circum-Atlantic version of Africa. As a N e w Orleans social aid and pleasure club, Zulu participates in the t r a ‑ dition of Afrocentric mutual aid and burial societies dating from the colo‑ nial period, when people of African descent constituted the majority in New Orleans (as they do again today) and when, as slaves and free people\n\n2]\n\n22\n\nH I S T O R Y.

In After Africa (1983), for example, Roger Abrahams and John Szwecl discuss the African derivation of such popular performance genres ascheerleading, baton twirling, and broken‐field running in football, and in Abrahams’s classic Man‐of;Words in the West Indies: Performance and the Emergence of Creole Culture (1983), there is a persuasive account of the diasporic genesis of a particular kind of eloquence n o t unknown to Zulu maskers: “talking broad,” “talking sweet,” and “talking nonsense.” It is widely accepted that in New Orleans concentrated forms of African music and dance remained in the celebrated bamboulas of Congo Square and else‑ where until very late, with powerful, though undocumentable, conse‑ quences for the development of jazz (Kmen). Comparative studies such as John Nunley and Judith Bettelheim’s Caribbean Festival A m : Eac/z and Every B i t of Diflerence (1988) locate the festive traditions of N e w Orleans in\n\n24\n\nH I S T O R Y.

Scholarship along these lines tends to support my impression that in the sardonic laughter of K i n g Zulu there resonates a voice that c a n n o t be accounted for by the comparatively crude inversions of the European carnivalesque. I believe that through the sophisticated disguises of diasporic memory, the Janus-faced Trickster figure erupts at Mardi Gras in the Zulu parade, reinventingan African cultural pattern in its N e w Orleanian social c o n t e x t . Embodying the deconstructive spirit of Esu (Gates, T/ze Signifying M o n ‑ key, 31‐42), the Trickster t u r n s the tables on the powerful and emerges unscathed from the ensuing contretemps, confounding his adversary by dint of the dexterity with which he can reverse polarities: bad is good and white is black. In Domination and the Arm of Resistance (1990), James C Scott identifies such a “hidden transcript” as one of the “Arts of Political Disguise” exemplified by the Jamaican slave saying “Hitting a Straight lick with a crooked stick” (136‐82). The Trickster in his N e w Orleanian m a n i ‑ festation did n o t exist as such in Africa, but neither did “The T1‑amps’) .. “ . .

In his formation o u t of the linked SUrrogationscum‑ densely concentrated interculture, Zulu might very well have takenOE-a present form without Esu per se, but hecertainly could n o t eXist in the samls way today without Rex, nor, it must be emphaSized, could Rex eXist in th: same way without Zulu.\n\nThe meaning of the comic effect that Addison achieves in his aCCOunt of the Everlasting Club now comes into sharper focus.

Yet the illusion created by this fiction is so power‑ ful and evidently so enduringly persuasive that specialists of each intellec‑ tual generation since the publication of Genealogy ofMoralr have had to reinvent Friedrich Nietzsche’s caustic demolition of origins in order to make it their o w n .\n\nGenealogies of Performance As I hope my a c c o u n t of the impromptu concatenation of Rex and Zulu has suggested, genealogies of performance document‐and suspect‐the historical transmission and dissemination of cultural practices through col‑ lective representations. For this formulation, I am indebted to Jonathan\n\nArac’s definition, applying Nietzsche and Foucault, of a “critical geneal‑ ogy” that “aims to excavate the past that is necessary to a c c o u n t for how we got here and the past that is useful for conceiving alternatives to o u r pre‑ sent condition” (2). Genealogies of performance take from Foucault’s seminal essay in Hommage djean Hyppalite (1971) the assurance that dis‑ continuities rudely interrupt the succession of surrogates, who are them‑ selves the scions of a dubious bloodline that leads the genealogist back to the m o m e n t of apparent origin in order to discover what is and is n o t “behind things”: “not a timeless and essential secret, but the secret that they have no essence or that their essence was fabricated in a piecemeal fashion from alien forms. . . . What is found at the historical beginning of things is n o t the inviolable identity of their origin; it is the dissension of other things. It is disparity” (Foucault, “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,” 142). The practical experience of applying this principle suggests that it is far m o r e hortatory than nihilistic. Genealogies of performance attend n o t only to “the body,” as Foucault suggests, but also to bodies‐to the reciprocal reflections they make on one another’s surfaces as they foreground their capacities for interaction.\n\n25\n\n26\n\nH I S TO RY. M E M O R Y. A N D E’ERFORMANFI\n\nGenealogies of performance also attend to “counter-memories.\" ( ) r the di5‑ parities between history asit is discursively transmitted and memory asit is publicly enacted by the bodies that bear its consequences. In the chapters that follow I will be applying three principles that govern the practices of memory and show how genealogies of performance may be analyzed: kinesthetic imagination, vortices o f behavior, and displaced t r a n s m i s s i o n , Performance genealogies draw on the idea of expressive m o m a c m s as mnemonic reserves, including patterned movements made and remembered by bodies, residual movements retained implicitly in images or words ( o r in the silences between them), and imaginary movements dreamed in minds, n o t prior to language but constitutive of i t , a psychic rehearsal for Physical actions drawn from a repertoire that culture provrdes. This r e p e r t o i r e has been defined by the French historian Pierre N o r a as “true memory,” Which he finds in “gesrures and habits, in skills passed-down bylunspoken tradi‑ tions, in the body’s inherent self-knowledge,° in unstudied reflexes and “ ingrained memories” (13). N o r a develops the idea of places of memory” (lieux deme’moire), the artificial sites“ of the modern PI'Oduction of national ' m e n t s of memor- ” . and ethnic memory, 1n contrast to env1ron - 5 o f t r ad. ‘ y (\"Illeux de l t l o n a ] C u ] tu r es. me’moire), the largely oral and corporeal r e t e n t i o n Modernity is characterized asthe replfcemem 0f environments of m a s archives, m o movement n u m e n t s , and by Places 0 f memory, t such o m away from the of theme hiSIOry’ th .\n\nI}:\n\nreturned; no longer (lime life, n o t Yit deathz‘lil-{e‘shells 0“ [henslmre when sea of living memory has receded (l2) L i v m g mehmory r emains vari‑ ously resistant to this form of ‘forgetting, however, I rough the trans is‑ sion of gestureS, habitS, and Skills.

In this I am inspired by the work of dance historians on the transmisswntand transformation) of memory through movement. Taking together the Important Work of Mark Franko in Dance as Text: Ideologies 0f 1/” Baroque 3045’ ('993) and Susan Foster in Stag/mg Bodies: TIze Choreography of Narrative and Gender in the French Action Ballet (forthcoming), for instance, shows how ballet has dis_ seminated, transmitted, and contested social and even political attitudes\n\nH l fi l ' O R L M E M O R Y. A N D P E R F O R M A N C E\n\nfrom the seventeenth century onward. Foster particularly demonstrates how the dance can indeed be separated from the dancers asa transmittable form, a kinesthetic vocabulary, one that can m o v e up and down the social scale aswell asfrom one generation to the n e x t . She discloses the size of the stakes in such mz'leux de me’moire when she asks: “ D o n o t all records of human accomplishment document the motions of bodies?” The essays col‑ lected in jan Bremmer and Herman Roodenburg’s Cultural Hzlrtory of Ges‑ ( a r e (1992) tend to answer Foster in the affirmative. As a faculty of memory, the kinesthetic imagination exists interdepen‑ dently but by no means coextensively with other phenomena of social m e m ‑ ory: written records, spoken narratives, architectural monuments, built environments. Along with culturally specific affiliations such asfamily, reli‑ gion, and class, these forms constitute what Maurice Halbwachs calls “the social frameworks of memory” (38). The kinesthetic imagination, however, inhabits the realm of the virtual. Its truth is the truth of simulation, of fan‑ tasy, or of daydreams, but its effect on human action may have material c o n ‑ sequences of the m o s t tangible s o r t and of the widest scope. This faculty, which flourishes in that mental space where imagination and memory c o n ‑ verge, i s a way o f thinking through m o v e m e n t s ‐ a t once remembered and reinvented‐the otherwise unthinkable, just asdance is often said to bea way of expressing the unspeakable. The kinesthetic imagination exists to a high degree of concentration in performers, and its effects will be obvious in my a c c o u n t of the public reception of exemplary histrionics, such asthe mourning woman’s leap into the grave at her grandmother’s funeral in Ben‑ jamin Henry Latrobe ’5 a c c o u n t of a creole funeral (chapter 2.), Thomas Betterton’s acting of Shakespeare (chapter 3), the Mohawk Kiotseaeton’s handling of wampum strings at the Three Rivers treaty (chapter 4), Agnes Robertson’s transformative embodiment of the title role of D i o n Bouci‑ cault's The Octoroon (chapter 5), or the carnival tableaux of the Mistick Krewe of Comus (chapter 6). But it also operates in the performance of everyday life, consolidated by deeply ingrained habits and reinforced by paradigmatic systems of behavioral memory such as law and custom. Kinesthetic imagination is n o t only an impetus and method for the r e s t o r a ‑ tion of behavior but also a means of its imaginative expansion through those extensions of the range of bodily movements and puissances that technological invention and specialized social organization can provide. Technological invention (architectural innovation particularly) and social organization c r e a t e what N o r a calls “places” or sites of memory‐‑\n\n9\n\n7\n\n:8\n\nHISTORY. MEMORY.

New traditions may also be invented and others overturned. The paradox of the restoration of behavior resides in the phe‑ nomenon of repetition itself: no action or sequence of actions may be per‑ formed exactly the same way twice; they m U S t bereinvented or recreated at each appearance. In this improvisatorial behavioral space, memory reveals itself as imagination. The African-American tradition of “signifyin(g),” for instance, asexplained by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., with reference to Jelly Roll Morton’s stomp variation on Scott Joplin’s rag (63‐88), and applied as “repetition with revision” to Yoruba ritual by Margaret Thompson Drewal (4‐5), illuminates the theoretical and practical possibilities of restored behavior n o t merely asthe recapitulation but asthe transformation of expe‑ rience through the displacement of its cultural forms. Improvisation may even erupt into forms asostensibly conservative as rimal- In her study of the dynamism, play, and agency of Yoruba etutu, Drewal contests what she t e r m s “the dominant notion in scholarly discourse that ritual repetition is rigid, stereotypic, conventional, conseryative, invari‑ ant, uniform, redundant, predictable, and structurally static (Xiv). What She describes in the dynamic performance practices of Yorubaland comple‑ ments Renato Rosaldo’s general assertion in Culture and Truth: T/ze Remak‑\n\ning OfSOCial Anabrsis (i989; rev. 1993) that ritual most often resembles“ “a busy intersection” in or novel iunctures may occur. In l ' ' which ' unanticipated ' ‘ . u' . . cOntrast with the classic view,” Rosaldo writes, which posns culture as a self-contained whole made up of coherent patterns, culture can arguably be c0Ilceived asa more porous array of intersections where distinct processes crisscross from within and beyond its borders” (20). Theicharacteristically performative circum-Atlantic image of the busy intersection evokes what I am calling the behavioral vortex where cultural transmission may be a t r of a‑ detoured, deflected, or displaced.

Brunetta fumes and rages until a r e m n a n t of the dreaded brocade falls into her hands: she then appears at the “publick Ball in a plain black Silk Mantua, attended by abeautiful Negro Girl in a Pet‑ ticoat of the same Brocade with which Phillis was attired.” Phillis swoons. She then flees the ball in chagrined despair, to depart the West Indies forever on the n e x t ship home (1:344). Many things could be said about Addison’s misogynistic anecdote: that its semiosis of conspicuous consumption recapitulates the triangular trade in material goods and human flesh, for instance, or that w o m e n and their erotic o r n a m e n t s come to symbolize and embody the astonishing super‑ abundance created (and then maldistributed) by such circum‐Atlantic argosies. These possibilities, including the role of women’s clothed and unclothed bodies as commodified signifiers of abundance and fecundity, will be taken up elsewhere. For the moment, however, there is one salient point to consider: the tale ’5 meaning asgossip can flourish only in a partic‑ ular kind of world, one in which racial surrogation operates as a potent social threat. In their performance of everyday life, the transoceanic micropolitics of rival pulchritudes, Phillis and Brunetta require the s t r a t e ‑ gic availability of “a beautiful Negro Girl.” They need a cameo appearance from her to tip the balance and bring their hateful little revenge comedy to its mock-catastrophic end. To perform asprotagonists of gendered white‑ ness they m u s t rely on an unnamed black antagonist, who, like millions of indispensable actors in the dramas of the circum-Atlantic world, remains forgotten but n o t gone.\n\n3|\n\nThat which weremember is, more ofien than n o t , that which we would like to have 62:91,- or that w/u'c/x we [rope to be. ‐ RALPH ELLISON\n\nTHE l’OlGNANCY or\n\nRALPH ELLISON‘S ACCOUNT OF\n\nMEMORY RESIDES IN ITS\n\nidentification of amnesia asthe inspiration to imagine the future. Like per‑ formance, memory operates asboth quotation and invention, an improvisa‑ tion on borrowed themes, with claims on the future as well as the past. Where time is sculpted ascogently asit is through performance, a longing for clear beginnings (cognate to origins) accompanies an even more pro‑ nounced desire for the telos of perfect closure. From the heritage of tragic drama in the West, I believe, circum-Atlantic closures especially favor c a t ‑ astrophe, a word rife with kinesthetic imagination, which carries forward through time the memory of a movement, a “downward turning,” redolent of violence and fatality but also of agency and decision. Like catastrophe, with which it often coincides, the illusory scene of closure that Eurocentrists call memory (“what’s done is done”) incites emotions that t u r n toward the future, in aspiration no less than in dread (“God ’5 will be done”). The choreography of catastrophic closure‐Fortinbras arrives, Aeneas departs, Creon remains‐offers a way of imagining what m u s t come n e x t aswell as what has already happened. Under the seductive linearity of its influence, memory operates asan alternation between retrospection and anticipation that is itself, for better or worse, a work of art.\n\n34\n\nECHOES IN THE B O N E\n\nThis chapter borrows its title from An Echo in the Bone (1974). a play by the late Jamaican dramatist Dennis Scott. Scott uses the s t r u c t u r e of the Nine-Night Ceremony, which, through the ritual magic of the jamaican practice of obeah, welcomes the spirit of a deceased person back i n t o his or her home on the ninth night after death has occurred. Restoring the behav‑ iors pertaining to spirit-world t r a n c e and possession, the playwright shows how the voices of the dead may speak through the bodies of the living. He enlarges on the Ninth Night r e t u r n of one recently departed soul in order to populate the stage with spirits resurrected from the depths of c i r c u m ‑ Atlantic memory, including m a s t e r s and their human chattel on a slave ship off the coast of Africa in 1792, the traders and the traded in a slave aUCtion‑ eer’s office in 1820, a defiant band of Maroons, and the white and black inhabitants of a Jamaican Sugar plantation, past and present. Errol H i l l , in the epilogue to his path-breaking jamaican Stage, 16255‐1900: Profile ofa Colonial Theatre (1992), places AnEcho in the Bone in the complex hiStorical context of Caribbean performance traditions, including amateur and p r o ‑ fessional productions of Shakespeare in colonial Kingston and Afrocemric spirit-world rituals such asNine Night. Like Hamlez,.a particular favorite of Kingston audiences since the eighteenth c e n t u r y ( H i l l , peSSim), An Echo in the Bone dramatizes the cultural politics of memory, particularly ast hey are realized through communications between the living and the dead. It is precisely the politics of communicating With the dead that co nCern megenerally in the following chapters and m o s t urgently in the PreSen t One. Echoes in the bone refer n o t only to ahistory of forgetting but to a Sti‑ate of empowering the living through the performance of memory, In Mathis; History: Social Revolution in the Novel: of George Lamming (fOrthc Supriya Nair stresses the importance of obeah and vodun as I‘C'Sistawhine), m practices in the Caribbean: Haiti provides the obvious but far from example of an imagined diasporic community coalescing arOun the Sole d Spiritworld memories and performances (James); similar claims have be 6“ made for voodoo and hoodoo in N e w Orleans (Mulira), claims that recc, gnize the Ceremony of Souls n o t asnostalgia but ashidden agenda. If Fra m2 Fanon remained skeptical about the political edge of vodun (Wretchedof the Earth 55‐58), Lamming himself, in a passage illustrative of the circulatiOn of Cir: cum-Atlantic performance genres, evokes ShakesPeare ’s Hamlet to desc r i be the revolutionary potential of the spirit-world presence: “ I f that PreSErtce beno more than aghost, then it is like the ghost that haunted Hamlet, order‑ ing memory and imagination to define and do their duty” (125),\n\nE C H O E S I N THE B O N E\n\nIn c o n t r a s t to the linear narrative of catastrophe so powerfully present in Western tragic drama, however, spirit-world ceremonies, celebrations of the cycle of death and life, tend to place catastrophe in the past, asa grief to be expiated, and n o t necessarily in the future, as a singular fate yet to be endured. In this they closely resemble the great Condolence Councils of the Iroquois, the action of which culminates in a “Lifting Up of Minds,” t r a n s ‑ forming “dysphoria” into “euphoria” (Fenton, 19; Myerhoff; Radcliffe‑ Brown). An Eclto in tlze Bone ends n o t in the obligatory fifth-act carnage of revenge tragedy‐the die is cast, the cast m u s t die‐but in celebration: “Play,” a devotee tells the drummer, “for what [we] leave behind. Play for the r e s t of us.\" The playwright brings down the curtain only “ W/zen tlze stage is full oft/zeir celebration, somew/zere in the ritual” (136‐37). This affir‑ mation contests the closure of investing the future with the fatality of the past, a position more easily maintained by those whose communication with their a n c e s t o r s was continuous, dynamic, and intimate. However strange such relations may appear to some, in world-historical t e r m s they are a c t u ‑ ally quite normal. To educate the reader of Things FallApart (1958) to this fact, Chinua Achebe dramatizes the regularity of the ancestors’ return, n o t as supernumeraries to the apocalypse but as an annual board of visitors (62‐66). In such circumstances, memory circulates and migrates like gossip from location to location aswell asfrom generation to generation, growing or attenuating as it passes through the hands of those who possess it and those whom it possesses. As Achebe expresses the commonsense negotia‑ tion of propinquity and difference: “Spirits always addressed humans as ‘bodies’ ” (64). In the v o r t e x of the circum-Atlantic world since the late seventeenth cen‑ tury, the peculiarity of the development of European memory with regard to ancestral spirits is conspicuous. Later on in this chapter, I examine the n a t u r e of that peculiarity by reconstructing memorial performances of dif‑ ferent kinds at several apparently unconnected sites: the mythic evocation of England’s Mediterranean origins in Henry Purcell’s opera Dido and Aeneas (1689), the segregation of the dead from the living aspromulgated by urban planners in London (171]) and New Orleans (1721), the interactive adapta‑ tion of African burial practices under the French Code noir in Louisiana (after 1724), the “slave dances” of Congo Square (ca. 1820), and, briefly, the emergent secular sainthood of a gifted but derivative rhythm-and‐blues singer (ca. 1954). Before those performances can be addressed asif they do somehow in fact belong to the same world, however,I need to define agen‑\n\n35\n\n36\n\nECHOES IN THE B O N E\n\neral phenomenon of collective memory that functions in all of them: the effigy. The effigy is a contrivance that enables the processes regulating per‑ formance‐kinesthetic imagination, vortices of behavior, and displaced transmission‐to produce memory through surrogation. Moreover, the effigy operates in all the cultural constructions of e v e n t s and institutions that I define ascentral to circum-Atlantic memory: death and burials, v i o ‑ lence and sacrifices, commodification and auctions, laws and (dis)obedi‑ ence, origins and segregation.\n\nThe Effigy Normal usage employs the word efl'z‘gy asa n o u n meaning asculpted or pic‑ tured likeness. More particularly it can suggest acrudely fabricated image of a person, commonly one that is destroyed in his or her stead, asin hanging or burning in effigy. When effigy appears asa verb, though that usage is rare, it means to evoke an absence, to body something fOrth, especially something from a distant past (OED)- 51973.7.“ c o g n a t e t0 efi'z‘cienqy3 efli‑ cacy, eflérvescence, and eflémiflag’ through t h e \" mutual comKiCtion to i deas of producing, bringing forth, bringing out, and making.

No doubt that is why effigies figllre sef ut_ quently in the performance of death through mortuary rimalsfianzowfy the ambivalence assodated with the dead m u s t enter into any discussion of the relationship between memory, performance, and substitution, From the work of Emile Durkheim and Sir James Frazer on, the anthro‑ pological classics have given great weight to the revelatory meanings of funerary ceremonies and practices among diverse cultures. In his retrospec‑ tive preface to the 192.2 edition of TheGolden Bong/z, Frazer summarized the\n\nE C H O E S I N THE B O N E\n\nimportance of this subject to his entire project: “the fear of the human dead,” he w r o t e , n o t vegetation worship, was “the m o s t powerful force in the making of primitive religion” (vii). In Arnold van Gennep’s seminal formulation of death asa rite of passage, the binary distinction that creates t w o categories, dead and alive, simultaneously creates in its interstices a threefold process of living, dying, and being dead. The middle state (dying, or m o r e expressively, “passing”) is the less stable stage of transition between m o r e clearly defined conditions: it is called the “liminal” (literally, “threshold”) stage, and it tends to generate the m o s t intense experiences of ritual expectancy, activity, and meaning. As further developed by Victor Turner, the concept of liminaliry‐a state of berwixt-and-betweenness, a “subjunctive mood” in the grammar of communal activity‐characterizes as “social dramas” those behaviors in which normative categories are trans‑ gressed or suspended only to be reaffirmed by ritual processes of reincor‑ poration (Forest of Symbols, 94). Turner and others have hypothesized that celebrations of death function asrites of social renewal, especially when the decedents occupy positions to which intense collective attention is due, such asthose of leaders or kings. Digressing on the power of royal corpses in their survey of the anthropol‑ ogy of death, Richard Huntington and Peter Metcalf (to whom I am much indebted for the materials relating to mortuary ritual in this section) explain: “ I t seems that the m o s t powerful natural symbol for the continuity of any community, large or small, simple or complex, is, by a strange and dynamic paradox, to be found in the death of its leader, and in the representation of that striking event” (182). It is also in connection with the death of its leader or another similarly august luminary that a community is likely to construct an effigy, animate or inanimate. As the Mande proverb elegantly sums up: “ I t takes m o r e than death to make anancestor.” The rich anthropological literature on this subject includes such classics as Frazer’s account, revised by E. E. Evans-Pritchard, of ritual regicide among the Shilluk people of the Upper Nile (the Shilluks replaced the fail‑ ing body of their king with a wooden effigy until a successor could be named). It likewise includes parallel studies of the Dinkas of southern Sudan, who buried their Chieftain alive during what they took to be his final illness (Deng). These practices, which define asintolerable the decay of the body of the leader, resemble in certain respects the tribal customs of the French and the English, including the British policy of early recall of colo‑ nial civil servants (before they reached the age of fifty-five) so that the\n\n37\n\n38\n\nECHOES IN THE B O N E\n\nlocals would never see their European governors falling i n t o illness or decrepitude (Said, 42). Such practices derive from the venerable principle of divine kingship. They answer the need to symbolize the inviolate continuity of the body politic (Huntington and Metcalf, 121‐83). They do so by dra‑ matizing aduality, acore of preternatural durability invested within a shell of human vulnerability (Soyinka). This paradox of immortality amid phys‑ ical decay symbolically asserts the divinely authorized continuity of human institutions while recognizing their inherent fragility. It also discovers the profoundly ambivalent emotions human beings harbor for the dead, who once belonged among the living but who n o w inhabit some alien c o u n t r y whose citizens putrefy yet somehow endure. In English and French history particularly, this paradox finds expression in the strange doctrine of the “king's t w o bodies.” As documented and explicated by Ernst Kantorowicz, the legal fiction that the king had n o , o n e but t w o bodies‐the body natural and the body Pali‘iC‐dGVeloped o u t of medieval Christology (the corporeal duality of M a n and God) and into an increasingly pragmatic and secular principle of sovereign succesSiOn and legal continuity (Giesey; Kantorowicz). Tudor lawyers found it a Particu‑ larly useful way of holding Queen Elizabeth, for instance, to the grants of property made by Edward VI during his minority. They a r g u e d that whil the boy-king"
