(Once Retro Hugos have been presented for a given year, no future Worldcon may present Retro Hugos for that year.) The 1941 Worldcon did not present Hugo Awards. MidAmeriCon II elected to present Retro Hugo Awards for works first published in 1940 that would have been eligible for the 1941 Hugo Awards, had there been Awards presented in 1941."
