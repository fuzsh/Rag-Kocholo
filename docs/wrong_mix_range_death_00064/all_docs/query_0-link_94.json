        "text": "Month: July 2019\n\nSepia Sunday – Old-Time Swimmers\n\nStandard\n\n1917 Bathing Suit\n\nIt’s fun to see fashions like this bathing suit from the World War I era. My grandparents would have been 20 and 21 in 1917. That was the year they married before my grandfather went off to France for the war.\n\nI wasn’t even sure where they would have gone swimming at that time. Maybe in the river near Tyro, Kansas, the small town where they lived. Maybe there were farm ponds that the locals gathered to swim.\n\nAt that time, regular clothing for ladies was not showing any of the leg. That makes the bathing costume rather daring attire. It was worn with bloomers (lesson 312 in the dressmaking book).\n\n(My grandparents, Clarence and Ruth McGhee, from our family album)\n\nI inquired in the Tyro, Kansas Facebook group and members shared their family stories and photos from the good old days. Leila Dalke suggested Hamilton’s Pond as a popular place and Jim McGinnis mentioned Yo’s pond and the shale pit.\n\nGary Carnes remembered Rex Buster taking a group to Havanna Lake to swim. That was far enough away that they had to go by car. Most likely in 1917, people were swimming someplace close that could be reached on foot or by bicycle. There was no public swimming pool.\n\nPeggy Reed told this story, “after the brick plants were gone the great pit that was left was called the Brickyard Pond. It was a great place for swimming but was considered dangerous! I remember swimming there in my underwear and was spanked when I got home because my wet hair was a dead give- away. This was about 4th or 5th grade. It was located in the northeast part of Tyro. I think it was near the Smothermon’s place.\n\nGary Carnes added, “there were actually two pits, one was very deep. It was a great place to fish until the then owner stopped all access due to the danger. We kids would still slip in when we could.”\n\nThe inspiration photo from the Sepia Saturday blog. Check out the other bloggers who posted on this topic. I’m a day late, so mine is a Sepia Sunday post.\n\nEffie’s Mystery Man\n\nStandard\n\nA while back, I shared a painting by Effie Skaggs, my great-aunt. That one featured baby Effie sitting on the knee of my 3rd great-grandfather, Thomas Ellison. It seems that Effie was quite the painter but unfortunately, the family does not know who the subjects are in some of the portraits.\n\nNow, my challenge is to figure out who is the man in this painting.\n\nThis painting shows an intense, reasonably young man with dark hair. That hairline might be a help in identifying this mystery ancestor. Another clue is the tie which looks like the style from the 1860s where most of it is hidden by the shirt collar.\n\nLet’s round up some possibilities. I’d love for it to be a Martin or an Ellison, but we must also consider Skaggs and Osborn on her husband’s side of the family.\n\nEffie’s husband was:\n\nHenry Talbot Skaggs\n\nBIRTH – 14 SEP 1848 • Indiana\n\nDEATH – 25 DEC 1920 • Enterprise, Wallowa, Oregon\n\nI’m thinking it may be a generation older than Effie and Henry. So it could be one of these men below. I don’t have any photos of either of them to compare to this painting.\n\nHer father was:\n\nCharles Coleman MARTIN\n\nBIRTH – 26 JANUARY 1831 • Kentucky\n\nDEATH – 16 AUG 1886 • Madison, Greenwood County, Kansas\n\nHer father-in-law was:\n\nSolomon Skaggs\n\nBIRTH – 23 MAY 1822 • Lawrence County, Indiana, USA\n\nDEATH – 21 OCT 1864 • Alton, Madison, Illinois\n\nIt could even be an uncle of Effie’s or of her husband, Henry. That gives us these possibilities: Charles Coleman’s brothers are Thomas Claggett Martin, William Allen Martin, James Henry Martin. Solomon Skaggs’ brother was John Wesley Skaggs.\n\nNow, I do have a photo of Thomas Martin but he is older and with a white beard, not easily compared to Effie’s painting. My eye is drawn to his son, Hal Roach Martin, standing behind him. Look at the dark hair and the hairline but with the mustache, it is hard to see his mouth for comparison purposes.\n\nI’m still thinking that Henry/Hal Roach Martin (born in 1855) is the wrong generation for the painting. Consider this, could he be a good representation of what his father looked like twenty years earlier or maybe even his uncle, Charles Coleman Martin?\n\nPeople in the photo are Martha Ann, Elizabeth J, Henry Roach, Mary E, Laura Belle, front row: Milton T, Thomas Martin (bearded man), wife Mary Margaret Sullivan, Sadie L. photo from Merle Martin, sent to Gail Lee Martin.\n\nLooking at them side-by-side, I’m just not sure. The nose, hairline, and maybe even the ears look like a good match, but the subject in the photo has more angular cheekbones. I really would love to attach a name to this painting by Effie. It’s quite possible that it’s my direct ancestor, Charles Coleman Martin.\n\nIt would be great if the cousin who has the painting could find the photo that it may be based on and that it might have the name of the person written on the back. One can hope!\n\nReunion – 71 Years Ago\n\nStandard\n\nSeventy-one years ago in July, the McGhee family gathered for a reunion. Thank goodness, someone labeled the photos or I never would have figured out the people in this photo.\n\nEven with the names, I’m hard put to match them up. I’ll have to put our Facebook cousins group to work figuring out this one.\n\nThe casual pose captures the relaxed camaraderie of siblings and their offspring gathered together. Boards resting on barrels serve as tables with a checked table cloth to dress them up. The glass pitcher is probably filled with freshly-squeezed lemonade. The plate on the grass appears to have sandwiches on it. I’m sure there was fried chicken, potato salad, and baked beans too.\n\nThe women are wearing dresses and the men have slacks and long-sleeved shirts. This is probably Kansas and therefore quite hot in July. It was a more formal time and the attire is what was appropriate in that era for a special picnic with the extended family.\n\nChairs were brought out from the house and impromptu seating concocted as well. Blankets were spread on the ground under the shade of a big tree.\n\n1946 Reunion\n\nTwo years earlier, this 1946 reunion photo captures some of the McGhees. Neatly lined up, the names are more readily attachable to individuals. Left to right: Treva Mae Davidson, Viola McGhee (back), Frances McGhee, Nita Cleo Davidson, Melba McGhee (back), Viola Matilda Tower McGhee, Roy McGhee (back), Bertha McGhee.\n\nAlthough not as candid, it does give us a better view of people’s faces.\n\nLet this be a reminder to us as we gather with family this summer. Take lots of photos and label them with names and dates. Future generations will appreciate your effort.\n\nJesse’s Car Business\n\nStandard\n\nThe hint this week for Sepia Saturday showed some vintage cars parked outside a courthouse. I’ll show you the photo that it brought to mind first and at the end, the inspiration picture.\n\nAs you can see in my photo, the auto is parked outside an early service center called the Liberty Garage.\n\nWhat we know about this photo:\n\nThe Liberty Garage was in Morgan, Texas. Nowadays, you’d cruise down I-35W from Fort Worth, then across to Morgan in Bosque County. It’s 40 miles west of Waco.\n\nOnly 490 people live there now, and it was only slightly larger back in the 1920s. It peaked around 1900 at a population of 850 and started its downward slide after that.\n\nFrom our family letters, we can place the photo as being around 1919 to 1922.\n\nThe garage seems to have taken over an existing storefront and the canopy partly obscures the previous name. I’m wondering if that old name might have been “Orient?” The word under that is too long to be cafe or store, but none of my searches turned up a list of stores in long-ago Morgan.\n\nHow it relates to our family:\n\nOur great-aunt Bertha McGhee wrote, “There were six children still at home when Papa was killed. Elmer had died the year before and Clarence was married and Jesse was in Tex. with Aunt Alice’s family–working as a mechanic. Clarence and family lived on the oil lease where papa was killed and Roy was working with Papa at the time.” “Papa” (Samuel Newton McGhee) was killed October 28, 1922.\n\nAnother tidbit from Bertha, “Jesse went to Texas soon after he took the automotive course in K.C. In 1919, I think. I know he was there the summer of ’19 when Papa was gone those months having suffered amnesia after being beaten and robbed. I was 16 and Roy was the oldest one at home. Clarence had got home from Overseas and was working for Phillips in Okla. south of Caney–his first job with Phillips–if my memory is correct.”\n\nOur second cousin 1x removed, Helen Ruth Johnson wrote that her mother, Helen Newton Morris, and our Jesse McGhee had a couple of businesses together when he lived in Morgan, Texas; the first business was the Liberty Garage. Helen sent a Liberty Garage paper signed by Jesse, as well as a photo of the garage to my sister.\n\nHere’s the Sepia Saturday inspiration photo:\n\nFurther Photos of Jesse McGhee During This Time\n\nI turned to the 1920 census to see what kinds of businesses and workers there were in the town of Morgan. I previously had not found Jesse in 1920, but there he was in the household of S.L. and Minnie Leigon. He was noted as being a cousin and they misspelled his last name as McGheehee.\n\nHis age was 21 and his work was mechanic at Country Engine. So, it must have been after the January 1920 census that he and his cousin opened the Liberty Garage. He was not the only one working on cars. Three other men were listed as working at various garages.\n\nList of Businesses and Workers in Morgan, Texas in 1920\n\nGrain buyer\n\nReal estate\n\nKeeper – boarding house\n\nProprietor – hotel\n\nLineman – telephone\n\nFarmers (lots of farmers)\n\nSuperintendent – public school\n\nDentist\n\nCashier – bank\n\nAccountant – bank\n\n2 Physicians\n\nPlumber\n\nShoemaker\n\nTelegraph operator – railroad\n\nDruggist\n\n4 Baptist ministers\n\n3 Merchants – grocery store\n\nMerchant – dry goods\n\nMeat market\n\nLumber\n\nEditor – town paper\n\nPostmaster\n\nMail deliverer\n\nCook – restaurant\n\nWell driller\n\nElectrician – light company\n\nTailor shop\n\nCarpenter – house\n\nProprietor – garage\n\nDressmaker – at home\n\nSalesman – grocery\n\nTraveling salesman – grocery\n\nWasherwoman (there were a number of these. One was the wife of a Baptist minister)\n\nClerk – oil company\n\nCook – private family\n\nSalesman – dry goods\n\nProprietor – jewelry store\n\nOil company bookkeeper\n\nLaborer – public roads\n\nRetail merchant – drugs\n\nProprietor – furniture\n\nCook – hotel\n\nLaborer – waterworks\n\n3 Blacksmiths\n\nLaborers – cotton gin\n\nBarber\n\nThere were a few teachers for the public school (Adell Majors, Minnie and Bertha Starr) and three high school teachers (Gertrude Crow, Mattie Hall, Ana Harrell). Quite a few people worked for two railroads (the MK&T and the GC&SF). They included clerks, section hands,\n\nIndependence Day 1861\n\nStandard\n\nMy mother, Gail Lee Martin, wrote this story in 2006 for the Our Echo website. We are so lucky that she instilled in us an appreciation of our family’s heritage and that she worked so diligently to research and preserve it. I’ve added some vintage graphics and a newspaper clipping to her written account.\n\n1861 – Our Family’s Patriotic Heritage\n\nHave you ever wondered how the early settlers celebrated the 4th of July in Kansas for the first time after becoming a state? I traced my Mother’s family from Connecticut to Iowa, through Missouri to the Kansas territory in 1859. I always wondered how my great-grandparents, James and Almira Vining, celebrated that special occasion.\n\nThe Vining family settled on a small homestead near the Verdigris river three miles east of the tiny community of Madison Centre in April 1857. At that time the family consisted of James and his wife, Almira; their children: Henry, my grandfather, 21; Erastus, 19; Isreal, 15; Charles, 13; James Jr. 11; Franklin, 6 and their only daughter, three-year-old Jane. When Kansas became a state the four older boys had already enlisted to serve in the United States Calvary and were away fighting in the Civil War. With four sons in the service of their country, I’m sure the Vining family attended the patriotic ceremony that was held in their neighborhood that July.\n\nIn July 1861 Madison Centre was in Madison County twenty miles south of Emporia. The Emporia News, the only newspaper in that area at that time, reported the following:\n\nMadison Centre, Madison County\n\nMr. Editor: Early in the day, a number of citizens of this township assembled for the purpose of raising a Union flag, which was accomplished to the satisfaction of all present. The Declaration was then read by John J. Greenhalgh, in a loud, clear distinct tone. He did justice and honor to the memories of the great and good men who made it.” Then the news report went on to tell about the bountiful dinner everyone enjoyed. “The meal was furnished by the ladies of the community including roast mutton, roast and boiled chickens, chicken pies, cakes, tarts and other ’knicknacks’ too numerous to mention.”\n\nHow proud I am that my ancestors were there to observe the raising of the first Union flag in Madison Centre, Kansas.\n\nOur family still celebrates July 4th with lots of good home cooked food and a few fireworks, mostly sparklers. For many years we had family picnics at Peter Pan Park in Emporia on the 4th of July. We still remember the lovely rose garden and who could forget the funny antics of the monkeys on Monkey Island?\n\nMy husband’s grandmother, Marie Joy, always made a big heavy crock full of “thick fruit salad” because invariably the weather was hot and we didn’t have ice available on almost every corner as we do now. Grandma Joy would use twice the amount of Jell-O that the recipe called for then added lots of fruit with bananas and marshmallows until it was almost solid. But we loved it! Since we raised our own chickens, we always had big containers of fried chicken with all the pieces including the neck, liver, heart, gizzard, and the coveted wishbone. As a special treat, we sometimes had store-bought “pork & beans.”\n\nHigh flying flags always arouse my patriotism and I see them flying in so many different places. For instance, postage stamps through the years have been one way of showing patriotism for our country. I delight in sending my mail with stamps showing flags or eagles. Every year the postal department issues new designs. I recall one I especially liked. It had the flag flying briskly over the words, “I pledge allegiance …” I guess I thought flags could only fly briskly in Kansas."
