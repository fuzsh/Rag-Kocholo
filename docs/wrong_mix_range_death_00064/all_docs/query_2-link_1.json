        "meta_description": "harlowheaven on December 6, 2023: \"90 years ago in Harlow History, December 7, 1933: Harlow and her mother attend Hal Roach’s 20th anniversary banquet at his studio in Culver City, which was conveniently located just a hop and a skip from MGM (funnily enough, she was on suspension here). \n\nShe’s wearing a blue velvet gown with Rex rabbit fur sleeves, which are surprisingly extant and well-preserved in a private collection.\n\nSo many stars and Roach alumni alike were there, the event can best be summed up in the words of attendee Will Rogers:\n\n“It was a grand party, the biggest thing I ever saw. It would take me three columns to tell you who all was there. The list read like one of those ‘who’s delinquent on their income tax’.” \n\nRoach helped give a teenage Harlow a head start in shorts like LIBERTY (1929), notable for her billing as Harlean Carpenter, and DOUBLE WHOOPEE (1929), in which Laurel and Hardy’s antics famously result in her half-nakedness. The duo were among Harlow’s first comedic mentors; she credited them with helping instill her knack for comedic timing. \n\n“Stan and Babe realized my ignorance and did everything in their power to make me feel at home and at ease,” she recalled later, with a hint of characteristic self-doubt.\n\nHal Roach still remembered Harlow’s individuality when he discussed her with biographer David Stenn decades later, at age 99:\n\n“She was different. Her hair was an odd type, and she had a beautiful face and body. There was nobody like her.” \n\nSlides 1 & 2: Jean Bello, Hal Roach, and Jean Harlow.\n\nSlide 3: Hal Roach and Harlow holding hands—I always like to point out that sapphire brooch on Harlow, which was a favorite of hers for years. Love that her traveling beauty mark has migrated to her cheek.\n\nSlide 4: Harlow and a stable of mentors and comedy geniuses alike. From left to right: Hal Roach, Harold Lloyd, Harlow, Stan Laurel, Warren Stockes, and Oliver Hardy.\n\nSlide 5: Harlow and Louis B. Mayer, who she was obliged to pose with while explaining away her suspension. “You can’t fight with your friends, and Louis B. Mayer is the best friend any girl in the world could have.” \n\nSlide 6: Her dress as it appeared on display in Hollywood some years ago.\".",
