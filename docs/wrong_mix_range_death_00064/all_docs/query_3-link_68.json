        "text": "full name: Norman Myers Chaney\n\nprofessional nickname: Chubby\n\nborn Oct. 18, 1914, in Cambridge, MA\n\ndied May 29, 1936, in Baltimore, MA, of myocarditis\n\nSpecial note: It's long been published that Norman was born on Jan. 18, 1918, which would make him 11 years old when he joined Our Gang (despite the publicity at the time saying he was 9 years old). However, a member of thelittlerascals.net named \"rhapsody\" researched Norman's death certificate, which revealed that he was 21 years, 6 months, and 28 days old on the date of his death. This would mean that his birthdate was Nov. 1. 1914. The 1920 census states that he was 5 1/2 years old at the time, with a younger sister named Ruth. Interestingly, the 1930 census, taken after he joined Our Gang, states that he was only 11 years old with an OLDER sister named Ruth. I suspect that even the folks at Hal Roach Studios didn't know his actual age. After all, he was brought in to replace Joe Cobb, who was being aged out of the series. Norman was two years older than Joe, so being passed off as 11 would have made good sense. And indeed, his first contract states that he was 11 years old. The death certificate also gives his birthplace as Baltimore.\n\nBUT WAIT!!! There's actually more to this story! As revealed at the Norman \"Chubby\" Chaney tumblr page, the death certificate, which was filled out by Norman's maternal uncle, had the information wrong! We now have Norman's birth certificate, which states that he was born on Oct. 18, 1914, in Cambridge - not Nov. 1, 1914, in Baltimore. Now, of course, it's easy to see why his birthyear would be changed, but why change the month and day to Jan. 18? Well, if the birth certificate has the correct date, then it's easy to see how a typo can turn 10/18 into 1/18. Certainly easier than changing 11/1 into 1/18.\n\n1928\n\nIn the fall of this year, Norman won a nationwide contest conducted by Loew's Theatres, Inc. As The New York Times of May 31, 1936, described, the contest was held in 70 different cities, and Norman won out over nearly 2,000 entrants. Jack Roach, casting director for Hal Roach, offered to take him to Culver City to join Our Gang. Upon hearing this, Norman replied, \"Mister, are you just kidding me because I'm fat?\" The Times continues to explain that he was, at the time, in the fifth grade and made very good grades, except in deportment. As Norman said, \"That's low because I make the other kids laugh so easily.\"\n\n1929\n\nJudging by the amount of his first paycheck, Norman's first day as a salaried Our Gang kid was March 19th of this year, which was a Tuesday. However, the contract signed on April 18th was retroactively effective starting on March 18th, so perhaps somebody forgot that he didn't work that Monday. This was a short-term contract, due to expire on June 17, 1929. Norman started off at $100 a week.\n\nIt was director Bob McGowan who gave Norman the nickname \"Chubby.\"\n\nThe August 24th Motion Picture Herald reported the following: \"Norman 'Chubby' Chaney, no relation to Lon - is the new Rascal to join Hal Roach's gang and he hails from Baltimore, Md. Chubby was discovered a few months ago when a nation-wide contest was conducted by Loew's Theatres, Inc., to find child personalities for 'Our Gang.' Chubby Chaney was the only youngster selected from the contestants by Roach and McGowan to become a permanent member of 'Our Gang.' He was signed on a long term contract, after having been tried out in an 'Our Gang' talking comedy. The new Fatty is the first addition made to the Hal Roach Rascals since 1927. Chubby Chaney, 9 year old, wobbles the scales up to 106 pounds, and measures 47 inches in height. He has been enrolled in fifth grade studies in the Our Gang School by Fern Carter, teacher.\" So what does this get wrong? Well, for starters, Chubby was 14, and not 9. He was initially signed to a short-term contract, so the try-out period would have covered more than one film. And Mary Ann Jackson had joined the Gang in 1928.\n\nThe August 31st Motion Picture Herald reported that Chubby had been signed on July 27th. This is consistent with when his contract expired two years later.\n\nAccording to Dorothy DeBorba, Edgar Kennedy coached Chubby on making facial expressions, including Kennedy's signature \"slow burn.\"\n\n90.

He seems to have continued turning up for his weekly checks until June 20th, when he was given a lump sum to cover the rest of his contract period.\n\nOn June 6th, while Chubby was still under contract, he posed with the other Our Gang kids, including the recently retired Farina Hoskins and Mary Ann Jackson, for some photos with some visitors to the studio.\n\nOn October 31st, Chubby entertained at the \"Children's Hallowe'en Party\" thrown by Bullock's in Los Angeles. Also performing as part of the program were Shirley Jean Rickert and Betty Jane Graham.\n\nOn November 14th, Chubby was among the entertainment at the May Company's circus, which was presented on its roof garden in Los Angeles.\n\nOn December 11th and 12th, a new E.F. Smith public market had its grand opening on Figueroa Street in Los Angeles. Chubby was part of the entertainment on one of the two days, as was Shirley Jean Rickert. They were both said to be appearing \"courtesy of the Hal Roach studios,\" but neither was under contract with Roach at this point.\n\n103.

Chubby, recently of Our Gang, is already an old-timer; little Mickey Martin, who is the second number of the trio, is well known for his cleverness, and the small girl of the trio is tiny June Stewart, who has some good work to her credit and who is certain to make her mark in the series.\" It would appear that this series never got underway.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press of May 30, 1936, Chubby returned to Baltimore during 1932.\n\nMickey's Golden Rule (supporting role)\n\nJune 4, 1932 - Darmour/RKO - 2 reels - Mickey McGuire series\n\n©June 1, 1932. It isn't entirely clear that Chubby appeared in this short, but he did appear in the 1939 reissue short \"Mickey's Fair Play,\" which probably derived from this 1932 film.\n\n1933\n\nBy the beginning of this year, Chubby was doing a vaudeville act which consisted mainly of anecdotes about his movie activity. He performed at the Fox Theatre in Bakersfield on January 7th, in addition to being Master of Ceremonies at the Coconut Grove Ballroom in that city on the same date.\n\nOn January 27th and 28th , Chubby performed at the Fox Redondo theater in Redondo, CA, along with Wheezer, somebody named Anna Mae Jackson and \"others.\" On February 5th, the three of them, billed as Hal Roach's \"Our Gang,\" put in a personal appearance at the Santa Maria theater in Arroyo Grande, along with somebody named Shirley Jane. So either Mary Ann Jackson and Shirley Jean Rickert took part, but with inaccurate billing, or they recruited a couple of similarly-named girls, hoping the average theater-goer wouldn't notice the difference.\n\nChubby was doing his act in Baltimore by March 5th. On March 18th, while performing at a theater called Keith's in Baltimore, he was apparently heard over the radio on the local program WCBM Kiddies' Club.\n\nOn April 8th, Easter Sunday, The Hecht Co. department store in Washington, DC, presented Chubby in a mock-up of a movie studio, where he told stories of his film experiences.\n\nChubby's stage act continued at least until June 19th. On that day, he played the Capitol in Madison, WI, \"in an act hooked up with the Madison boys film to be made here this week.\" So, perhaps Chubby made a local film in Madison.\n\nThe November 2nd Evening Star of Washington, DC, reported that the Washington N.R.A. was to produce a talkie featuring Chubby Chaney. Entitled Let's Live, it was a comedy that apparently was supposed to also be educational, and would feature local children, in addition to Chubby.\n\n1935\n\nThe November 13th Titusville Herald reported the following: \"Norman Chaney, child movie star, is mysteriously ill in a Baltimore hospital with a glandular ailment which cut short his movie career two and a half years ago. Chaney, known as 'Chubby' in 'Our Gang' pictures, at 17 is four feet five inches tall and weighs 133 pounds. The ailment has impaired his walking.\" The hospital Chubby was staying in was Johns Hopkins. Prior to this, his weight had increased to almost 300 lbs., but the ailment eventually brought it down to 136 lbs.\n\n1936\n\nAfter failing to rally following an operation, Chubby died on May 29th of this year. Not surprisingly, it was reported that he died at the age of 17, but he was actually 21.\n\n1938\n\nOn May 29th of this year, columnist Joan Burke, reminiscing on stars who had passed away in recent years, included several Chubby Chaney quotes she had collected:\n\n\"I have a pony, but can't ride it, for when I get up on its back the poor thing actually cries.\"\n\n\"I am too short to ride a horse, so I can't ride anything at all.\"\n\n\"I have a dog which I love so much I feel that it is part of me.\"\n\n\"Some day I should like to play baseball like other boys, but I am so heavy that I can't run.\"\n\n1978\n\nRascal Dazzle (archival)\n\n1978 - King World/Picture Scores - 93 min. - documentary feature\n\n©1978.

The dates given are Saturdays, the last day of each week at the studio. The only exceptions would be Saturdays that were also holidays, in which case the Friday date is used for those weeks.\n\nIt was in March 1929 that we first encounter Chubby in the payroll ledgers.\n\nMar. 30, 1929 - 183.33 charged to prod. G23 (Small Talk)\n\nChubby was present for the entire time prod. G23 was being filmed, but did not appear in it. Judging by the amount, he must have started at the studio on March 19th. The rest of the Gang's salaries were being charged to prod. G22 (\"Saturday's Lesson\") during that week, but Chubby's salary was charged to prod. G23, and lumped with the following week's amount.\n\nApr. 6, 1929 - 100.00 charged to prod. G23\n\nApr. 13, 1929 - 100.00 charged to prod. G23\n\nOddly, it's only at this point that the studio datebook and payroll summary start listing Chubby among the contract players.\n\nApr. 20, 1929 - 100.00 - 33.33 charged to prod.

S25 (Sky Boy)\n\nThe ledgers are a little unclear about the non-Our Gang production Chubby worked in, with They Go Boom! being a possibility, but either way, Chubby's footage was cut. Strangely, the studio datebook and payroll summary indicate that he went without pay during this week.\n\nChubby did not receive any pay for the weeks ending August 3rd, 10th, 17th and 24th.\n\nAug. 31, 1929 - 50.00 charged to prod.

G2 was in an interim period for the first two weeks, then filming for two weeks, and then in another interim period for two weeks. Chubby didn't work in the film, so he was given the entire amount in one lump sum. This would mean his contract expired the week ending July 25th."
