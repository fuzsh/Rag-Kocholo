        "text": "(From Old Corral collection)\n\n(From the HAUNTED RANCH production still shown below.) Looking back on B westerns and serials - and Hollywood films in general - it was common to typecast performers based on their race, ethnicity, etc. This was a time of Hollywood stereotypes - for example, \"all Indians were vicious, rampaging savages\" and the \"U. S. Cavalry were good guys and always saved the day\".\n\nOne of the more familiar performers of this period was black actor Fred Toones. For most of his 30+ year film career, Toones used the screen name of \"Snowflake\", and his roles were generally that of a servant, porter, cook, etc. He appeared in various A and B grade films, including some westerns and cliffhangers, and most of his roles were unbilled/uncredited.\n\nLes Adams has Fred identified in about 180 sound films, and of that total, 54 are westerns and 7 are serials.\n\nIf you pay close attention, you may spot Toones in a couple Nat Levine produced cliffhangers, THE GALLOPING GHOST (Mascot, 1931) and THE HURRICANE EXPRESS (Mascot, 1932). In the mid 1930s, youngster Frankie Darro did a series for producer Maurice Conn (Conn Productions and Ambassador Pictures) and Frankie's adult helpers were Leroy Mason (billed as Roy Mason) followed by Kane Richmond. Ten films were released during 1935-1937 and Fred appeared in about half the entries. You can also spot him in some Charlie Chase shorts for producer Hal Roach. And Fred portrayed a janitor in the Laurel and Hardy WAY OUT WEST (Hal Roach/MGM, 1937).\n\nDuring the period 1936-1947, Toones worked in about 40 films at Republic Pictures, most of which were uncredited walk-on or bit parts. Examples: Fred was a train porter in Gene Autry's OH, SUSANNA! (Republic, 1936) and a cook in the Roy Rogers Trucolor adventure BELLS OF SAN ANGELO (Republic, 1947).\n\nFred's Republic film appearances in more detail: he did five with the Three Mesquiteers, two with Roy Rogers, two with John Wayne, one with Sunset Carson, nine with Don Barry, and eleven with Gene Autry. He got billing credit for his roles in a couple of great Republic serials, HAWK OF THE WILDERNESS (Republic, 1938) and DAREDEVILS OF THE RED CIRCLE (Republic, 1939).\n\nDirector William Witney's autobiography mentions that Toones ran the shoeshine stand at Republic studios.\n\nFred did a few westerns for other production companies - for example, in the Hopalong Cassidy adventure FOOL'S GOLD (United Artists, 1946), he plays a handy man / gardener - and got billing credit and had a fair amount of dialog.\n\nFred also shows up in A grade films - examples: he was \"Rufus\", the butler and cook to District Attorney Fred MacMurray in REMEMBER THE NIGHT (Paramount, 1940) which co-starred Barbara Stanwyck. And he's a bartender in the Preston Sturges directed THE PALM BEACH STORY (Paramount, 1942), which starred Claudette Colbert and Joel McCrea.\n\nThough his roles were often demeaning, Fred Toones was one of the prolific supporting players in B westerns and cliffhangers. As such, he deserves a biography on the Old Corral.\n\nHe died from a heart ailment on February 13, 1962 at the Los Angeles County General Hospital.\n\nFred 'Snowflake' Toones is Fred 'Buster' Hayes???\n\nThere is a February 12, 1942 article on Snowflake in The Robesonian newspaper, Lumberton, North Carolina. The article is lengthy and author Ray Pittman interviewed Snowflake. Pittman was also City Editor for the paper.\n\nThe headline reads: \"Lumberton's Only Actor, Snowflake, Tells How He Crashed The Movieland On Recent Visit To His Old Boss Here\"\n\nThere is no mention of his birth year or the name Toones (or any variation) anywhere in the article. Snowflake's real name was Fred 'Buster' Hayes and he was the adopted son of Moriah Munn of Raynham, NC (which is in Robeson County; The Robesonian newspaper is located in Lumberton, NC which is the County Seat of Robeson County). Prior to his movie career, Fred was a general handyman and chauffeur for Doctor E. L. Bowman. A few quotes from the article:\n\n\"There's one thing that bothers Buster ... wants to know what became of his folks, and especially his mother, Bernice Hayes, who hasn't been seen in these parts since after the birth of young Snowflake.\" (This is totally different than what Fred reported on his two marriage licenses - his father was Mark Toones and his mother's first name was Francis.)\n\n\"And if you want to see Lumberton's only movie actor on the screen, just watch for the new production 'Palm Beach Story' starring Claudette Colbert and Joel McCrea. Snowflake will be the big, scared bartender on the fast train. But we'll bet he gets in one good solid grin so you can recognize him.\"\n\nHere's the February 12, 1942 article on Snowflake in The Robesonian newspaper, Lumberton, North Carolina: https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-robesonian-article-and-interview-wit/131832252/\n\n(Courtesy of Les Adams)\n\nAbove is the pressbook cover for Jack Perrin's HAIR-TRIGGER CASEY (Berke-Perrin Prod./Atlantic, 1936). The faces on the right side, from top to bottom, are Ed Cassidy, Betty Mack and Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. While Fred gets his photo on that pressbook cover, his name is not listed.\n\nThis film was one of a quartet churned out by Perrin and William Berke under their Berke-Perrin 'Blue Ribbon' logo. This series was Perrin's last hurrah as a leading man. Six were planned but only four were completed and released. Fred appeared in three of the four - the above mentioned HAIR-TRIGGER CASEY along with WILDCAT SAUNDERS (Berke-Perrin Prod./Atlantic, 1936) and DESERT JUSTICE (Berke-Perrin Prod./Atlantic, 1936).\n\n(Courtesy of Belinda Kirkhuff)\n\nAbove is a still from the Don Barry THE TULSA KID (Republic, 1940).

Milt Kibbee's brother was Hollywood actor Guy Kibbee.\n\n(Courtesy of Minard Coons)\n\nAbove from L-to-R are Rex Lease, Fred Toones, Julie Duncan, John 'Dusty' King, and Max Terhune in a scene from HAUNTED RANCH (Monogram, 1943).\n\n(From Old Corral collection)\n\nAbove from L-to-R are John 'Dusty' King, Fred Toones, Charlie King, Rex Lease, Bud Osborne, Glenn Strange and Max Terhune in a lobby card from HAUNTED RANCH (Monogram, 1943), one of the Range Busters' adventures. The scene in this lobby card is just prior to the closing brawl ... then Fred Toones discovers the \"Little Brown Jug\" tune that must be played on the organ ... and playing the song opens a secret wall passage with the missing gold from the Denver Mint."
