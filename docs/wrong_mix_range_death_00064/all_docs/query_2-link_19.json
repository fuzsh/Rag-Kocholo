        "text": "This event is free and open to the public. The KSFF is underwritten by donations.\n\nThis program is subject to change:\n\nFriday, Feb. 27, 2015\n\nBegins: 7:00 p.m.\n\nOverture by Jon Mirsalis\n\nWelcome & Introductions by Denise Morrison, Film Historian\n\nDouble Feature:\n\nFeature: Grandma's Boy (1922) with Harold Lloyd, Anna Townsend and Mildred Davis\n\nDirected by Fred C. Newmeyer\n\nProduced by Hal Roach\n\nPosters of the period announce this as Harold Lloyd's first five- part feature; as such it is worth taking a look at this sweet comedy Lloyd did while he was still with Hal Roach's studio. Harold plays a timid young man who lives with his feisty grandma (Anna Townsend). He's frightened of his own shadow, really, and it's beginning to affect his relationship with the girl of his dreams (Mildred Davis). So Grandma tells Harold a story about his grandfather in the Civil War.\n\nLloyd told silent film historian Kevin Brownlow that this film was his favorite of all his films, perhaps because it had nothing to do with the thrill features that came after it. And it set a pattern for many Lloyd characterizations to come, from The Freshman to The Kid Brother, of a timid, cowardly young man who gets pushed around until something or someone forces him out of his shell and into bravery.\n\nCo-starring Mildred Davis, a young actress who had a brief career before marrying Lloyd in 1923 and retiring, and 77-year-old Anna Townsend as Grandma, who would have lived through the Civil War as a child to starring in a film—how far we have come! — 54 min\n\n— Music by Jon Mirsalis\n\n--Brief Break\n\nFeature: College (1927) with Buster Keaton\n\nDirected by James W. Horne\n\nIn the mid-1920s America was crazy about anything college: college slang, college football, college fashion, collegiate songs. Harold Lloyd had made his most successful movie, The Freshman, in 1925, and many of the studios followed suit with stories set in colleges. With Buster Keaton's career on a slight decline after The General (believe it or not), he needed a success, and a movie set in a college seemed like a sure bet. But what irony: the most athletic of all the silent clowns, Buster, would be playing a nerdy brainiac who knows nothing about sports, much to the disappointment of his girl. Now to win her away from the college jock (Goodwin), he must put his smarts to learning how to play the game—all of them.\n\nKeaton was at the peak of his skills as a filmmaker and comedian in 1927, but amazingly critics and audiences were lukewarm to him. Although he had his fans he always came in third in the box office race with Chaplin and Lloyd. Although College doesn't come high on Keaton's \"best films\" list it's got some great comedy and a spectacular finish. — 65 min.\n\n— Music by Marvin Faulwell and Bob Keckeisen\n\nOpening Titles by Marvin Faulwell\n\nWelcome & Introductions by Denise Morrison, Film Historian\n\nSpecial Documentary — 60 min\n\nShort: The Battle of the Century (1928) with Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy\n\nDirected by Clyde Bruckman\n\nThis film boasts a hilarious climactic pie fight that for many years was all that remained of this two reel Laurel and Hardy comedy. But as luck would have it, in 1979, the first reel was discovered. So now, put together with stills that make up the remaining lost footage, we have probably the most complete version of this short film we'll ever get. Unfortunately the still-missing footage involves that great character actor Eugene Pallette, but you can't have everything.\n\nThe story has fight manager Hardy taking out an insurance policy on his puny pugilist Laurel, then trying to arrange for an accident so that he can collect. Things do not go quite as he planned however—they never did for Oliver unfortunately.\n\nIt has been reported that the film used over 4,000 real custard and cream-filled pies for the big fight at the end. And it shows!\n\n— Music by Marvin Faulwell — 13 min.\n\nShort: A Movie Star (1916) with Mack Swain\n\nDirected by Mack Sennett\n\nThe irreverant comedy of Mack Sennett is on full display here in this two-reel comedy which makes fun of stardom and movie-going even in the early stages of the full blown idolotry we give stars today. Long time Sennett star Mack Swain stars as the movie star of the title; we see him head into the local movie house hoping to hear and see his film—and be seen by the audience, who will give him some love. But that's not exactly what he gets. We also see the film they are all watching, a western affair called \"Big-Hearted Jack\" that gives us insight into just what the audience is reacting to.\n\nMack Sennett made fun of everything—taking satirical aim at the world around him. It is no surprise then that Sennett helped introduce self-referential humor to screen comedy: films that poke fun at themselves, other movies, movie-making, and the other aspects surrounding the cinema experience.\n\nAdding to the fun is the least likely western hero you're ever going to want to meet: Mack Swain. Swain is probably best remembered today as Chaplin's partner in The Gold Rush, but he was an experienced vaudevillian by the time he came to Sennett's Keystone Studio in 1913.\n\n— Music by Marvin Faulwell — 20 min\n\nFeature: The Little Church Around the Corner (1923) with Claire Windsor\n\nKansas-born (and former Washburn student) Claire Windsor stars in this feature of a mining town and the people who inhabit it. It's a story about class conflict—the mine owners vs. the mine workers—and a story about redemption of the local minister, who grew up a poor miner's son but who was taken in by the owner and now has to decide whose side to be on. An explosion, an angry mob, and a miracle all bring his faith into focus.\n\nThis melodrama reflects the Victorian Era in which the story was written. And the scenes inside the mine are the most realistic you'll see in a silent film—maybe sound film too! It's a treat to show off the talents of Claire Windsor, born in Marvin, Kansas. So few of her films survive!\n\n— Music by Jeff Rapsis — 64 min.\n\n--Lunch Break\n\nAfternoon - starts at 1:00 p.m.\n\nOpening Titles by Jeff Rapsis\n\nWelcome & Introductions by Denise Morrison, Film Historian\n\nShort: All Wet (1924) with Charley Chase\n\nDirected by Leo McCarey\n\nThe great Charley Chase returns and yes, he's all wet. A very simple premise—a situation that builds up to a whole lot more—that's what usually sustained a Chase film. Charley, as \"Jimmy Jump,\" gets a telegram telling him to come to the train station to pick up something. But oh, he has such a hard time getting there!\n\nCharley Chase found his place at the Hal Roach Studio, where he originally went to be a director. But Roach thought he was best in front of the cameras, so he starred Chase in a series of short films with a character known as \"Jimmy Jump.\" Chase never struck out for feature film stardom like some of his contemporaries, but that makes him no less brilliant at what he did. If you haven't discovered Charley Chase, then you're in for a treat.\n\n— Music by Jeff Rapsis — 12 min.\n\nFeature: The Birth of a Nation (1915) directed by D.W. Griffith\n\nThis is the 100th anniversary of The Birth of a Nation, a film that still has the power to provoke debate and strong emotions just as strongly as it did when it opened in 1915. That is a powerful gift—rightly or wrongly—to stir the emotions of a nation, as if director D. W. Griffith was taking the bandage off the painful memories of the war itself and laying it bare for everyone to take a look. Many directors have that gift, but few can use it to open such raw wounds as the Civil War.\n\nGriffith determined to make a film of Thomas Dixon's novel, The Clansman, in 1914. He gathered his loyal crew and stock company of actors and created what he felt was a pretty true depiction of history, mixed in with a story of two families—one Northern, one Southern—and how they survived the war and coped with Reconstruction—through triumph and tragedy. If Griffith thought he was recreating history with which everyone would agree, imagine how shocked he was when the film sparked riots and was banned in over a dozen states—including Kansas.\n\nIt was a shocking film back then with its depiction of the Ku Klux Klan as protectors of a defiled South during Reconstruction, but by today's standards, the second half of the film, in particular, can be a painful thing to watch. The fact that it's a technically advanced film for 1915 and that its director was at the top of his game only adds to the frustration—you are drawn to the story while being distracted by the emotional turmoil and \"just wrongness\" of the depictions. — 193 min.\n\n• NOTICE: Viewer discretion advised: this film shows depictions of attempted rape, of a lynching, and scenes of racial stereotyping and violence •\n\n— First-half music by Jon Mirsalis\n\n--Intermission Break in feature\n\n— Second-half music by Marvin Faulwell and Bob Keckeisen\n\nFollowing the film we discussed the implications of The Birth of a Nation—on the film industry, on history—and attempted to answer the question, \"Why should we still be watching this movie?\" Panel Discussion was with Jon Mirsalis, Kevin Willmott, film history professor at The University of Kansas and film director. Moderator was Denise Morrison — 30 min.\n\n--Dinner Break\n\n5:15 p.m.: Supper Break — Program resuming at 7:30 p.m.\n\nEvening - starts at 7:30 p.m.\n\nOverture and Opening Titles by Jeff Rapsis\n\nIntroductions by Denise Morrison, Film Historian\n\nThe Max Linder Collection with Max Linder\n\nThis is a compilation of four very short comedies from the great Max Linder, France's silent film genius. His career runs roughly from 1905 to 1925 and, for the most part, he plays a dapper man-about-town who is constantly getting himself into trouble with the ladies and living life a little too large. His popularity grew, and he became one of the first international stars of cinema. Our films include A Skater's Debut (1905), Troubles of a Grasswidower (1912), Max and His Dog (1912) and Max Juggling for Love (1912).\n\nAll originated in France and show Max at the peak of his career.\n\n— Music by Jeff Rapsis — 25 min.\n\n--Brief Break\n\nFeature: The Sea Hawk (1924) with Milton Sills, Enid Bennett,\n\nLloyd Hughes, Wallace Beery\n\nDirected by Frank Lloyd\n\nWe're back on the high seas to finish out our festival with one of the most popular swashbucklers of the silent era (that didn't have Douglas Fairbanks in it!). Milton Sills stars as an English noble betrayed and shanghaied who gets his revenge by becoming a pirate king: \"The Hawk of the Sea.\" Great cast and exceptional sets, with full scale ships, and exciting battle scenes make this one not to be missed.\n\nAlthough this film has been shown a few times on TCM we've got a great print with a hand-painted scene and beautiful color tints. If you're thinking this is just an older version of the Errol Flynn 1940 film, think again. Very little of the original Rafael Sabatini novel survives the Flynn version so our silent epic is the real deal. The cast includes the beautiful Enid Bennett and the great Wallace Beery, who steals every scene in which he appears.\n\n— Music by Jon Mirsalis — 123 min.\n\nOur Cast:\n\nAbout Special Guest Jon Mirsalis:\n\nJon Mirsalis is a two-time President of the Society for Cinephiles and has provided piano or digital piano accompaniment for silent films for over 20 years. Mirsalis is the Kansas Silent Film Festival's \"go to\" guy when it comes to discovering if a classic silent film still exists in any form or not. He usually has this knowledge off the top of his head. He is especially interested in the films of Lon Chaney Sr. For the 19th annual KSFF event, Jon will be playing piano or digital piano scores for the feature films, Grandma's Boy, The Birth of A Nation (Part 1) and The Sea Hawk. All feature film prints will be coming from Jon's own collection. He will also be our guest speaker at the KSFF Cinema Dinner where he will speak about \"Silent Film Survival: How Bad Is It Really?\" and pepper his talk with images from \"lost\" or nearly \"lost\" films.\n\nAbout Special Guest Keven Willmott:\n\nKevin Willmott is an Associate Professor in the Film Studies Department of Kansas University. He is also one of the most prolific independent writers and filmmakers working today. His writings and films focus on the concept of our \"Living History\"—how the history of the past can shape our lives, outlooks and opinions of other peoples and cultures today.\n\nWillmott grew up in Junction City, KS, and attended Marymount College receiving his BA in Drama. After graduation, he returned home, working as a peace and civil rights activist, fighting for rights of the poor, creating two Catholic Worker shelters for the homeless and fighting for integration. He attended graduate studies at New York University, Tisch School of the Arts, receiving several writing awards and his M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing. Kevin will be part of our The Birth of a Nation panel discussion.\n\nAbout Denise Morrison:\n\nDenise Morrison is a film historian from Kansas City, Missouri, with a special focus on silent film. She is Director of Collections & Curatorial Services with Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, and has been involved with the Kansas Silent Film Festival since the beginning.
