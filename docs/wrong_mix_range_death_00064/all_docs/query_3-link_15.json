        "text": "It is not the kind of climax Hal Roach liked, which probably explains it's excision. Unless you saw the rushes, which seems unlikely, you are the only one around today who might possibly have seen this footage, because we don't have it.\n\nWe did a reconstruction using all the 35mm elements we could find, and there are some different versions of PARDON US extant, but not with this ending. We know it was shot, but there isn't even a perpetual inventory vault record that shows it was saved beyond the day somebody, and probably Roach himself, decided that ending was not going to be satisfactory.\n\nBud McDonald: No, I never saw that, and I can only vaguely remember what you are describing. We are talking about a long time ago.\n\nLaurel & Hardy were both nice men. Stan Laurel was the first person I knew with a British accent. He was certainly different than others, odd I thought, but fun to be around. The truth is, I wasn't that impressed. No one at that place was self-important. Everyone made you feel at ease. To begin with, anyone who had a job during the Depression was happy about it, and then to spend every day in an atmosphere like Hal Roach Studios, it was fun, it was games. Everyone was good to you. The greatest life experience any kid could have.\n\nQuestion: You made several films with Charley Chase. Did you know he had a severe problem with alcohol too?\n\nBud McDonald: I did not.\n\nI remember in the Charley Chase film called ONE OF THE SMITHS, as I said before, Cactus Mack and the Texas Rangers was the band that they had at the barn dance. I gained a great love for country music at that time because of them. Not long after that I got a job singing on an hour long radio program called JUVENILE REVIEW on KFWB. The \"WB\" was for Warner Bros. Still is. And Jane Withers was on that show.\n\nImmediately following us was a half-hour program down the hall. We kids would scoot down there to listen to the Sons of the Pioneers, with Bob Nolan, Tim Spencer, and Leonard Slye, before he changed his name to Roy Rogers. We kids loved to see them perform. They were wonderful musicians.\n\nComment: In 1935 Hal Roach directed another Thelma Todd short subject, again like SEAL SKINS without taking credit, entitled SLIGHTLY STATIC, which was set in a radio station and featured the Sons of the Pioneers, with Roy Rogers.\n\nBud McDonald: Many years later I ran into Bob Nolan playing with the Sons of the Pioneers in Las Vegas. It was a lounge show, and after it was over, people were crowding around talking to him. I told him, as a kid I'd been on KFWB the same year he was. He looked at me for a moment, and said, \"You're Buddy! I remember you.\" So I got a kick out of that.\n\nAnother radio show I did every afternoon when I wasn't at Hal Roach Studios was called MOLLY MALONE'S FAMILY, an early soap opera. I played the youngest son, Terry Malone.\n\nQuestion: What else can you recall about seeing Hal Roach around the lot? Did you ever visit his office for any reason?\n\nBud McDonald: No, I didn't. Hal Roach, as I remember him, he was the boss. We all knew he was the big boss. Bob McGowan was the director. Jack Roach was the one who paid us. Don Sandstrom was the assistant director. Art Lloyd, I think, was the cameraman, wasn't he? We were directly involved with them. But when Mr. Roach was around ... by the way we didn't call him Hal, he was Mr. Roach, you see, big respect. To distinguish Mr. Roach's brother, because naturally we couldn't call him by the same name, the brother was \"Mr. Jack,\" or sometimes \"Dr. Jack.\"\n\nComment: There had been a very popular Hal Roach feature film with Harold Lloyd by that name.\n\nBud McDonald: With Hal Roach, as a matter of common courtesy and respect, I think everyone addressed him as Mr. Roach, at least as far as I knew.\n\nQuestion: Were you afraid of him?\n\nBud McDonald: No. Just respected him.\n\nHe had a hands-on approach throughout the studio that people liked and respected him for. He might show up anywhere and just quietly watch something for a few minutes. You might see him, you might not. He did that. He didn't want or need to call attention to himself. Looked that way to me. Or he might take over somebody's job who was having trouble, or maybe take somebody away to solve a problem somewhere else. He was a decisive man; that was apparent even to a little kid. He was Mr. Roach, and he was the boss, and nobody could fool him.\n\nHe was impatient once directing one of the Thelma Todd pictures; they needed a prop-maker for something. He wasn't going to wait. He grabbed a hammer and some nails. While these other guys ran around trying to find the prop-maker, Roach did the job himself. Just did it. I can remember that happening like it was this morning.\n\nComment: I never did ask Roach about this, because I didn't get the pressbook for ON THE LOOSE till after he died, but it carries a story about how they needed a certain car for a scene on the studio's New York street in the backlot. The car had been ordered from a rental service in Hollywood, but didn't arrive in time. I can picture Roach losing his patience over this and saying, \"Well what the hell, here's the car keys, there's my car, use that.\" I think it was the scene where Thelma and Zasu get splashed and covered with mud when the car races through a puddle.\n\nBud McDonald: Right. Well, Roach owned the whole operation; he could and did do whatever he liked. This was before the unions got in, slowed everything down. But I think Hal Roach, his studios were special, he was special.\n\nQuestion: Apart from Our Gangers, who was the favorite adult that you remember from all the units then shooting at the Hal Roach Studios?\n\nBud McDonald: Jack Roach. All of us kids adored Jack Roach. I used to have some great photos with him. My youngest daughter has what's left of the scrapbooks. I had three scrapbooks with still photos from Roach's and other studios. My older brother went in the navy in World War II. And he was up in the Aleutian Islands. And he was bragging to these guys, \"My kid brother used to be in the Our Gang comedies.\"\n\nNobody believed him, and so he got my mother to send him these photo albums with the great shots I had showing Jack Roach, Bob McGowan, Laurel & Hardy, Charley Chase, Billy Gilbert, Thelma Todd, Miss Crabtree, Mickey Daniels, Mary Kornman, and the Gang. They got their fan tail blown off in battle and had to be towed back to the navy dry dock at Mare Island. He lost those priceless photographs.\n\nQuestion: Describe your average day at Hal Roach Studios.\n\nBud McDonald: We might get there at 7:30 in the morning. That is, my mother and me. The guard at the gate knew us and would wave us in. It wasn't much of a gate! We parked the car, went to the stage where they told us to report. Or maybe we'd shoot way out on the backlot, maybe we'd take the bus to the ranch. Maybe we'd do scenes, maybe we'd play while the crew worked out some problem with the sets or the cameras.\n\nAt lunch we'd go to the Our Gang Cafe. There you would see everybody else at the studio, and of course since it was open to the general public there would be a lot of \"looky-lous,\" the tourists, they'd come to see us and the other people they knew from the movies. People were polite. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were always gracious, so it wasn't a problem for anybody.\n\nDorothy DeBorba's mom and my mom got to be friends, and once in a while they'd take us across the railroad tracks that bordered the east side of the studio over to a diner that had real good fried chicken. But mostly we went to the Our Gang Cafe.\n\nAt some point every day we had classes. We had summer vacation like everybody else, but during the school year you had to perform well. The studio was always anxious to prove to the board of education that these kids were not being neglected and in fact were doing well. Actually the teaching was a little more stern and severe than in the L.A. public school system. In fact they crammed more schooling into us than you got in regular school.\n\nQuestion: So you think you received a good education?\n\nBud McDonald: Well, yes, as far as my education went. Eventually I got kicked out of Bell High School and went to Jacob August Riis High School in Los Angeles, a school for incorrigible boys.\n\nIf we were out on location, like at the studio ranch there on Robertson Boulevard, we got our lessons on the bus -- the Our Gang school bus. On the back of each seat we had a desk that folded up. The teacher, Mrs. Carter, sat where the bus driver would.\n\nQuestion: Why wouldn't they use the one-room schoolhouse there to teach the kids?\n\nBud McDonald: I don't think they could, because its converted purpose was then for filming. They had to be able to move around with their cameras and have access to everything without breaking down walls and doors. You take all these things for granted until you see how it's down. Lots of tricks.\n\nI saw my first camera trick on PUPS IS PUPS. We were acting out at the ranch and they've got a camera and a mirror and a miniature set showing a huge building, and they're all hooked up together. I guess it was what they call a glass shot or a matte shot or something. All I know is we did our scenes without those other buildings, but when we saw the rushes, there they were up on the screen! You couldn't tell the buildings were not real.\n\nQuestion: McGowan let you see the rushes?\n\nBud McDonald: Oh yeah. You looked at what you did, and the kids would kind of tease each other, playfully, saying, \"Look at Chubby,\" or whatever line we might fire off at the screen.\n\nIt was so amazing to me that you got paid to go off and play like this every day. The Hal Roach Studio was like an amusement park to me, and the ranch was like a great picnic place. I can remember seeing Hal Roach and Will Rogers practicing on the polo grounds they had out at the ranch, sort of a field below where the old buildings were, the barn and the schoolhouse and the storage places.\n\nLater on, after I was out of the movies, we got caught sneaking into the rodeo over at the Union Stock Yards in Vernon, in Los Angeles. Hal Roach and Will Rogers were there and Rogers was the one who stopped the guys from having us arrested. He recognized me and then they took us in their box with two other kids! Instead of going to jail we stayed there and watched the rodeo with these two big shots!\n\nA funny thing happened one day. We were supposed to work out at the ranch on an Our Gang. Down home, in the summer time, I went barefoot, like everyone else.\n\nComment: Sounds like a TOM SAWYER anecdote.\n\nBud McDonald: Well, we weren't so far removed from that time. One day I showed up at the studio barefoot. I didn't put any shoes on and my mother never noticed. She had to drive all the way back to Bell to get my shoes, and in the meantime they went and bought a new pair of shoes for me at the studio. They had to scuff 'em up real bad.\n\nFunny thing about the shoes -- watch the films with Farina. He had another pair of shoes on inside those big shoes he wore to make his feet look extra large.\n\nQuestion: What else do you recall about making PUPS IS PUPS? Because the Our Gangs you are in are really some of the key entries in the entire series.\n\nBud McDonald: They handed me a toothbrush and told me to brush the goat's teeth. I was scared to death of that god-damned goat. I had never been around a goat, and it really frightened me."
