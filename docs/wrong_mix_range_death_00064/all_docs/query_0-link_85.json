        "text": "Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Hal Holbrook was a true luminary of the American stage and screen. His career spanned six decades, enthralling audiences with his dynamic performances and commanding presence. Despite growing up in a difficult family situation where he was raised by his grandparents, Holbrook tapped into his natural talent for storytelling and turned adversity into a stepping stone, leading to an illustrious career that would make him an icon in the world of performing arts. Holbrook's breakthrough came in the form of a one-man show, Mark Twain Tonight!, which he created himself. The show was not only an innovative idea at the time but also became a testament to Holbrook's resilience and commitment to his craft. His portrayal of the famed writer earned him critical acclaim and a Tony Award, and later, an Emmy when it was televised. This performance was so influential that it introduced a new generation to Twain's work and later was recognized by the Library of Congress as a national treasure. Beyond the stage, Holbrook made his mark in film and television, earning numerous accolades throughout his career. He received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of \"Deep Throat\" in the political thriller All the President's Men. His work in television was equally remarkable, earning him five Primetime Emmy Awards out of twelve nominations. Notably, his role in The Bold Ones: The Senator is still celebrated for its raw and insightful depiction of politics. Though he passed away in 2021, Hal Holbrook's legacy lives on through his monumental body of work and the countless actors he has influenced.\n\nWilliam Hal Ashby (September 2, 1929 â€“ December 27, 1988) was an American film director and editor associated with the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking. Before his career as a director Ashby edited films for Norman Jewison, notably The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming (1966), which earned Ashby an Oscar nomination for Best Editing, and In the Heat of the Night (1967), which earned him his only Oscar for the same category. Ashby received a third Oscar nomination, this time for Best Director for Coming Home (1978). Other films directed by Ashby include The Landlord (1970), Harold and Maude (1971), The Last Detail (1973), Shampoo (1975), Bound for Glory (1976) and Being There (1979)."
