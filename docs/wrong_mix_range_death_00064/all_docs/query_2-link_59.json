        "text": "full name: George Robert Phillips McFarland\n\nfamily nickname: Sonny\n\nprofessional nickname: Spanky\n\nborn Oct. 2, 1928, in Dallas, TX\n\ndied June 30, 1993, in Grapevine, TX, of heart attack or aneurysm\n\nSpecial note: Reports of Spanky's middle name being Emmett are erroneous, as stated by his sister Amanda at cs.com.\n\n1930\n\nAccording to the Corsicana Daily Sun of Aug. 24, 1932, Spanky became an actor at the age of 18 months, which would place his entry into this field at around April of 1930. This could, however, be erroneous. Perhaps his modeling career started at this point, or perhaps it started later in the year, or sometime in 1931. Because of the uncertainty behind this matter, I'll cover his pre-Roach period in the 1931 section below, but it's possible that some of the activity took place in 1930.\n\n1931\n\nThe details of Spanky's pre-Our Gang modeling career vary depending on the source. According to the Sep. 30, 1984, Arizona Republic (which interviewed Spanky), Spanky's aunt had a friend who worked at an advertising agency in Dallas, so she introduced him to Spanky. This led to a few different jobs, the chronology of which seems to be lost to history. These included:\n\n1. Modeling toddlers' clothing for a Dallas department store, this according to The News and Observer of Raleigh on Sep. 18, 1985, which interviewed Spanky and placed the year as 1931. The Morning News of Wilmington, DE, on June 4, 1986, (having interviewed Spanky) stated that the ads were for the Neiman-Marcus Co. The Journal of Meriden, CT, on June 6, 1955, stated that he was 3 years old at the time, though based on the timing of his entry into Our Gang, this seems unlikely.\n\n2. Modeling for soft drink ads, according to The Journal of Meriden, CT, again stating that he was 3 at the time. Interviewed by Tommy Bond, Jr., in 1980, Spanky stated that these ads were for Dr. Pepper.\n\n3. Modeling for a Dallas baking company's posters and advertisements, according to the Jan. 28, 1936, Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Hubbard Keavy's syndicated column of Sep. 11, 1936, stated that Spanky posed for bread billboards and made advertising reels for the same bakery. The Sep. 30, 1984, Arizona Republic, which interviewed Spanky, stated that it was a bread commercial shown at Dallas theaters. The Associated Press on Nov. 9, 1986 (after interviewing Spanky), stated that Spanky appeared in newspaper advertisements for Mrs. Bear's Bread. In his 1989 appearance on \"The Pat Sajak Show,\" Spanky stated that he made an advertising film for Wonder Bread. Considering the early timing of the first references to this advertising film, I'm inclined to believe it once existed, so I've given it an entry in the filmography below.\n\nAt some point, Spanky's aunt sent an item or items to Hal Roach Studios with the idea of possibly getting him into the Our Gang series. It may have been a group of photos (according to The News and Observer of Sep. 18, 1985), a single photo (according to The Journal of June 6, 1955 and the Arizona Republic of Sep. 30, 1984) or a print of the advertising film (according to the Jan. 28, 1936, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the Sep, 11, 1936, Hubbard Keavy column, and Spanky himself on \"The Pat Sajak Show\").\n\nAccording to the Sep. 30, 1984, Arizona Republic, Roach then invited Spanky and his family out to California for a screen test. According to Maltin & Bann, this screen test was shot by James Horne, and according to Spanky himself, a portion of this was later included in his second Our Gang film, \"Spanky.\"\n\nThis led to the signing of a long-term contract, which, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram of Jan. 27, 1936, was signed on Nov. 1, 1931. Other sources place the signing on November 4th.\n\nThis is how Spanky's mother described it in an article for The Sacramento Bee on July 28, 1936: \"We lived in Dallas, Texas, until Spanky was 3 years old - in fact, both the children were born there. Then when Spank was 3 he posed for some advertising posters of a baking company, and later they made some commercial films of him. His aunt sent the films to Hal Roach. And it wasn't long until Roach sent for all of us to come to Hollywood.\"\n\nIn her column of December 26, 1933, Zoe Beckley offered another variation on Spanky's entry into movie stardom: \"He was fond of ice cream sodas which he managed with the deftness of a person thrice his age. The proprietor of Spanky's favorite soda shop asked permission to photograph him as an advertisement. Someone clipped the picture from the Journal (wasn't it?) and mailed it to a friend in Hollywood who promptly passed it on to a publicity man connected with the studio who in turn showed it to a director who nearly had a fit.\"\n\nIn an article he wrote himself for the Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine of Oct. 15, 1933, Robert McGowan wrote the following: \"In all my career I have never found a child easier to direct or more talented than baby Spanky is. I found him through the mail. His aunt had gotten him work in some local advertising films with a bread concern in Dallas, Tex., and she wrote me that the baby was talented and she would send a strip of film if I was interested. I wrote back that I would be glad to see it and she forwarded it. As soon as his little face flashed upon the screen, I saw that he was one in a million. He made an immediate success. He is the only child I have ever found through the mail, although I get dozens of letters every day requesting interviews or sending photos of kids.\"\n\nAccording to the payroll ledger, Spanky began work in the Our Gang series on November 4th, making $75 a week.\n\nThe November 5th edition of The Hollywood Reporter reported the following: \"Our Gang starts today for Roach on 'Free Eats,' with a new kid in the cast, Robert McFarland, who has been signed on a term contract.\" Robert was actually Spanky's dad, but the publication would improve their Spanky coverage going forward.\n\nOn November 10th, the Los Angeles Evening Express reported the following: \"The newest member, George Robert McFarland, to be known professionally as 'Sonny,' is age 3 years and hails from Dallas, Tex. He will start his career of being a 'nuisance' to the rest of the gang in 'Free Eats,' now in production.\" The film was about halfway finished at the time of this article, and in it, the young Mr. McFarland is called \"Spanky.\" So did the Evening Express get their wires crossed between his private and professional nicknames, or was the studio originally going to call him \"Sonny?\" Notably, the Mar. 6, 1932, Sunday American-Statesman of Austin, TX, mentions that a Dallas boy, \"Sonny McFarland,\" is in the latest Our Gang short, \"Free Eats.\" This, however, isn't too surprising since Texans would have already had some familiarity with him.\n\nThe way in which George \"Sonny\" McFarland became George \"Spanky\" McFarland is also a bit varied in its telling. Hubbard Keavy, writing in his syndicated column of Sep. 10, 1936, wrote: \"He got his nickname at his first interview with Roach. The producer has an inner-office dictagraph on his desk - a magic box through which he can communicate with all his executives. While Roach and Mrs. McFarland were engrossed in discussion of a screen career, Sonny launched an investigation of the strange device. Up went all the keys on the master station, and a chorus of responsive 'hellos' ensued. Agitated, Sonny's mother warned: ':Spankee, spankee, mustn't touch!' The warning was needed so frequently thereafter that 'Spanky' was inevitable.\" According to Maltin & Bann, it was H.M. Walker who came up with the nickname after hearing Spanky's mother say these words. According to the 9-year-old Spanky himself (speaking in 1938 to reporter M. Oakley Christoph of the Hartford Courant), he was given the nickname by a \"well-known west coast sports writer.\" This was corroborated several times by the much older Spanky. For instance, according to the Associated Press of Nov. 9, 1986 (after interviewing Spanky): \"It was at his first screen test that McFarland received his nickname. A reporter from the now defunct Los Angeles Examiner observed the youngster and dubbed him Spanky for reasons unknown.\" It should be noted that the nickname was in existence before it was ever attributed to the Our Gang kid.\n\nWith improved accuracy, the December 15th edition of The Hollywood Reporter reported the following: \"'Spanky' is the title of the next Our Gang comedy which goes into production at the Hal Roach studios next week. The picture, which is three weeks ahead of schedule, will feature the youngest and newest player to join the gang. George Robert Phillip McFarland is the three-year-old's name in real life, but on the screen he is to be called 'Spanky.' Hal Roach claims he will be the hit of the gang in a short time. Bob McGowan will direct.\" The only inaccuracy in this article is Spanky's second middle name, Phillip, which was actually Phillips.\n\nWonder Bread (appearance)\n\ncirca 1931 - 1 min. - theater advertisement\n\nSpanky identified this item both as a Wonder Bread advertisement and one for Mrs. Bear's Bread. Perhaps Mrs. Bear sold Wonder Bread. It was shown in theaters around the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\n1932\n\nSomewhere around April of this year, Spanky's salary was increased to $100 a week.\n\nOn May 13th, The Arcadia Tribune of Arcadia, CA, reported that Spanky had \"just returned from a personal appearance tour and visit to his home town in Texas.\"\n\nOn June 1st, Spanky attended a polo game in Santa Monica where he posed with Mary Pickford.\n\nOn August 8th, Spanky's salary was increased to $150 a week.\n\nAn August 18th letter to Spanky's father, Robert Emmett McFarland, from Hal Roach Studios, expressed an offer to pay him $50 a week from Aug. 8th to Nov. 8th, with an option to continue this arrangement thereafter. This was after Spanky's dad had stated that he was having trouble getting a decent job with all of the time he devoted to his son's film career.\n\nDuring August, Our Gang had an endorsement deal with J.C. Penney's Back To School promotion. Newspapers carried information about each Our Gang kid, with this to say about Spanky: \"Spanky (George McFarland) likes to shake hands with everyone. He is very polite, unspoiled, and seldom cries. A real boy, he dearly loves toy guns. He is nearly four years old, and was born in Dallas, Texas. He has brown hair and big brown eyes, is only 33 inches tall and weighs 30 pounds. He is very healthy, however, (always takes a two-hour nap after luncheon). He got into the movies through being photographed in a Dallas bread advertising campaign because of his health and charm.\"\n\nOn September 5th, the Venice Evening Vanguard reported the following: \"Temperament among film stars is known to have often been a stumbling block in picture making. Children have seldom, if ever, been accused of getting cocky and obstinate. Yet, it is recorded that when director Robert McGowan wanted Dickie Moore and four-year-old Spanky to enact a scene together in an Our Gang comedy, the latter stubbornly refused. Investigation by the director revealed that the kids had had a spat on the side-lines. No amount of coaxing by the director could change Spanky's mind. And for the first time in his twelve years of handling the Gang kids, the director was forced to use a 'double' for Spanky.\"\n\nSomewhere around November, due to cost-reductions at the Roach studio, Spanky's salary was reduced to $125 a week.\n\n112.

The photo shows Spanky visiting Patsy in the hospital.\n\nOn September 18th, several newspapers carried a photo of Spanky punching boxer Primo Carnera in the nose.\n\nOn October 21st, a loanout agreement was made between Roach and Paramount, allowing Spanky to work in the film \"Miss Fane's Baby Is Stolen.\"The contract called for him to be returned to the Roach studio by the morning of November 13th, though the payroll ledger seems to indicate that Spanky's involvement lasted from November 7th to 18th, so perhaps things were delayed for about a week. The deal cost Paramount $600, in addition to their covering Spanky's salary for two weeks.\n\nOn November 5th, The Charleston Daily Mail reported the following: \"When three principal members of 'Our Gang' - Spanky McFarland, Stymie Beard and Tommy Bond - were drafted for minor parts in a Charley Chase comedy, they seriously objected for two reasons. First, they asserted, they were stars in their own right. Second, the scene they were asked to work in was a school room. Their objections were overruled with the promise of a picnic with pony rides.\" This is in reference to \"The Cracked Iceman,\" which was filmed the previous month.\n\nOn November 22nd, The Minneapolis Star reported the following: \"Studio officials are holding their breath in fear that Baby Leroy will contract the whooping cough. The diminutive star was exposed to the disease when Spanky McFarland, fellow infant, broke out with the cough while working in the same picture. An attack at this time would cost the studio thousands of dollars, as Baby Leroy is just starting his part in the picture. Spanky, on the other hand, has just finished his.\"\n\nOn November 24th, Harrison Carroll reported the following in his syndicated column: \"Studio officials are in a state of jitters and thousands of dollars hang at stake until it is known whether Baby Leroy has contracted that familiar complaint of childhood, whooping cough. There is no doubt that Hollywood's highest paid baby actor was exposed to the disease. Spanky McFarland, a fellow player in 'Miss Fane's Baby is Stolen,' broke right into whoops on the set. But, by good fortune, Spanky was just finishing his part in the picture. Baby Leroy, on the other hand, works all the way through and has two more weeks before the camera. If he develops whooping cough, it will take the complaint six weeks to run its course. To suspend production for this time would cost Paramount thousands.\"\n\nOn November 30th, George Shaffer reported the following in his syndicated column: \"After ten days under observation for whooping cough, the physicians employed by his studio report Baby Leroy Winebrenner does not have the disease. Five-year-old Spanky McFarland was playing in the same film and Spanky is making whoopee coughee all over the place.\"\n\nOn December 4th, the Daily News of New York reported the following: \"The Los Angeles Board of Education has withdrawn for ninety days the acting permit of 5-year-old Spanky McFarland. The action is intended as a disciplinary measure, because of Spanky being permitted to play for one day in 'Miss Fane's Baby Is Stolen' at Paramount, although he had the whooping cough. An investigation was made after the nurse and doctor reported whooping cough, and a report turned in to the school offices noted that R.A. McFarland, Spanky's father, had said that Spanky was suffering merely from a bronchial cough. Three months movie layoff is supposed to serve notice on parents of other child actors to keep them under constant medical supervision so that no child's life or health can be endangered.\"\n\nOn December 5th, Harrison Carroll reported the following: \"Echoes of the Baby Leroy whooping cough scare are reverberating again in Hollywood. The Board of Education stirred them up when they sent out letters suspending 'Spanky' McFarland's acting permit for 90 days. The board charges lack of cooperation, and hints that 'Spanky' was known to have whooping cough when he did the last day's work on 'Miss Fane's Baby Is Stolen' and exposed Baby Leroy to the disease. All of which might be a small matter if it weren't for two things. Director Al Hall must have 'Spanky' for one more scene in the Paramount picture. And the Hal Roach studio, where the 5-year-old star is under contract, faces the loss of his services for three months. Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. R.E. McFarland, 'Spanky's' parents, come in for extra grief as their second child is starting to whoop it up.\"\n\nOn December 26th, Zoe Beckley's column described Spanky this way: \"He is the world's cutest kidlet. He is fair, fat and five. He is terribly smart, terribly manly, very much a reg'lar guy, and (as Jackie Coogan was at the same age) highly adverse to ladies who call him 'little man' or try to take him on their laps. He simply squirms out of reach, hastily thrusts his toy engine at them and starts a description of its virtues, possibilities and the amount of trackage he has built with boards and blocks he has begged from the stage carpenters.\"\n\nBy the end of this year, after more cost reductions, Spanky's salary was reduced to $100 a week.\n\n120.

Spanky's nickname isn't used in the dialogue, but he receives billing in the opening titles as \"Spanky.\"\n\n1934\n\nThe Los Angeles Times of January 1st of this year reported the following: \"Shortly after the first of the new year, a rejuvenated band of Hal Roach's 'rascals' will romp through 'Our Gang' comedies. With Baby 'Spanky' recuperating from a siege of whooping cough and with several new faces in the popular group, the gang will start off the year 1934 with a heavy production schedule.\"\n\nA news item from January 8th mentions a 20th anniversary party for Hal Roach Studios, which was to include Spanky on its guest list.\n\nOn January 11th, the Los Angeles Evening Post-Record reported the following: \"'Spanky' McFarland, 5-year-old hero of Hal Roach's 'Our Gang,' has entirely recuperated from a severe attack of whooping cough and will begin work next week in another of the popular kiddie comedies. Also in the cast will be 'Stymie,' the colored menace; 'Tommy' Bond, the crooner, and others of the favorite little 'rascals.'\" So it would appear that Spanky's 90-day suspension was lifted, as less than 60 days passed between \"Miss Fane's Baby Is Stolen\" and \"Hi'-Neighbor!\"\n\nOn February 22nd, Spanky's salary was increased to $200 a week.\n\nOn February 23rd, The Evening Sun of Baltimore, MD, reported that Spanky had previously been the youngest Hollywood star to have a stand-in. Not anymore, though, as Baby LeRoy, three years younger, now had two.\n\nOn May 27th, the following was reported: \"Youngest and oldest members of Hal Roach's screen comedy troupe got together Sunday to compare notes. Youngest was 'Spanky' McFarland, 5. Oldest was Irving S. Cobb, famous writer recently turned film comedian. His age is a matter of conjuncture(sic). 'Mister Cobb,' said 'Spanky,' 'you ought to get along in this business. You have an awfully funny face.' Cobb's reply to this one is not a matter of record.\"\n\nOn July 1st, it was reported that both Spanky McFarland and Scotty Beckett had stand-ins, both of which were dummies that were used when shots were being set up. Presumably, these were the same dummies seen in the latter part of \"For Pete's Sake!\"\n\nIt's been stated in certain places that Spanky appeared in the Laurel & Hardy feature \"Babes In Toyland,\" which began shooting in August. In the original version written by Hal Roach in November 1933, Spanky was included, but he's nowhere to be seen in the finished film. Also, the payroll ledger doesn't indicate that his salary was ever charged to this production.\n\nOn September 6th, The Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"The hero always get the worst of it. Director George Stevens testified to this yesterday. He saved Spanky McFarland from a nasty fall, but was badly hurt himself. Spanky was cavorting around on the set where Stevens is directing Wheeler and Woolsey in 'Kentucky Kernels' when the youngster stumbled over an electric cable. The director made a lunge for the child and knocked over a huge sun arc. He raised his arm to protect himself and the arc struck him a terrific blow. Stevens was hurried to the studio's emergency hospital for treatment and was unable to resume working for an hour.\"\n\nOn September 15th, the Stockton Evening and Sunday Record carried this story: \"While Spanky McFarland was working on the 'Kentucky Kernels' set at RKO-Radio, his mother rewarded him with a penny for each perfect line he spoke, and penalized him one cent for each mistake he made. Spanky missed thrice, and was sad-eyed until Bert Wheeler missed a line. Spanky brightened as he said: 'You're pretty bad, Bert, but I'm still two up on you!'\"\n\nThe October 4th issue of The Hollywood Reporter reported the following: \"The Hal Roach 'Our Gang' staged a double birthday party yesterday for 'Spanky' McFarland and 'Scotty' Beckett.\"\n\nOn October 17th, Spanky attended the world premiere of \"Kentucky Kernels\" at the Golden Gate Theatre in San Francisco. From the stage of the theatre was broadcast the latest installment of the NBC radio program Hollywood On-The-Air, which included Spanky among its guests.\n\nOn October 24th, George Shaffer wrote the following in his column: \"Spanky McFarland, 5 year old actor, was at San Francisco last week for personal appearances, and Horace Hight(sic), the master of ceremonies, thought he had the kid coached perfectly. On the first evening show Hight asked Spanky: 'How do you like pictures?' Said Spanky, 'I won't answer that.' This was not in the routine at all and Hight thought he'd give Spanky time to pick up the dialog again, asking, 'Why won't you answer that question?' 'Because you asked the same thing this afternoon,' said Spanky, and the audience gave the kid a great hand.\"\n\nOn November 9th, Spanky headlined a night of entertainment for the newsboys of the Los Angeles Evening Post-Record.\n\nAlso on November 9th, Spanky's salary was increased to $250 a week.\n\nMiss Fane's Baby Is Stolen (supporting role: Johnny Prentiss)\n\nJan. 12, 1934 - Paramount - 7 reels - Dorothea Wieck & Alice Brady feature\n\nFilmed in Nov./Dec. 1933. ©Jan. 10, 1934.

Filmed Oct. 1 to 9, 1934.\n\n1935\n\nThe Rexall Magazine of January of this year featured Spanky on the cover.\n\nOn February 14th, the Brooklyn Times Union (NY) reported the following: \"Undeterred by wholesale visions of damage suits for shattered windows, Comedy Producer Hal Roach blithely announces plans for the national mobilization of 1,000 juvenile 'Our Gang' baseball teams. With 1,000 dozen uniforms already manufactured, and with Master Spanky McFarland, 'Our Gang' star, as national honorary president, Hal Roach's army of diminutive ball players will go into action the major leagues' opening day.\" On February 22nd, The Montclair Times (NJ) carried the same story, but added: \"In the fall, if all goes well, an 'Our Gang' world series is a Hollywood possibility.\"\n\nOn February 24th, Screen & Radio Weekly of Detroit, MI, reported the following: \"Even 'Spanky' McFarland, youthful mischief maker of Hal Roach's 'Our Gang' comedies, insists on some member of his family working with him on the set. His father's and mother's nearness wasn't enough, and on his return from Paramount where he worked with Baby Le Roy in 'Mrs. Fain's Baby Is Stolen,' 'Spanky' hollered for a stand-in - 'like what the grown-up stars had.' So now younger brother Tommy takes 'Spanky's' place when the tedious job of getting lights set correctly begins. The only trouble is that now and then 'Spanky' and Tommy forget they're making pictures and engage in a real honest-to-gosh family free-for-all. But Spanky is the older, and, being a born leader, generally gets Tommy to do what he wants him to.\"\n\nOn February 25th, The Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Director Gus Meins took Spanky McFarland to Lake Arrowhead to do some sketching; Spanky, the director says, is becoming quite an artist.\"\n\nOn March 16th, it was announced that the Laurel & Hardy series had been terminated along with Laurel's contract. Due to start production on March 25th was a new series called \"The Hardy Family,\" featuring Oliver Hardy, Patsy Kelly and Spanky McFarland, with the first short to be entitled Their Night Out. It's been speculated that this was all a huge bluff on the part of Hal Roach, but a script was written for the film (given the production number of either E4 or E30), and a screen test was made with the three principles. All of this was rendered moot when Laurel came to terms with Roach on April 8th.\n\nOn May 23rd, a loanout agreement was drawn up for Spanky to appear in \"O'Shaugnessy's Boy,\" which was scheduled to start on May 27th. The contract required MGM to pay $1000 and return Spanky to the Roach studio by the morning of Monday, June 3rd.\n\nOn May 28th, the Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles reported the following: \"Gus Meins, who directs Our Gang comedies for Hal Roach, declares he believes Spanky McFarland, current star of Our Gang, will become one of the most famous of child stars of the screen, because of Spanky's natural talent as an actor.\"\n\nFor some reason, between May and October, Spanky was making a reduced salary, usually coming to $115.85 a week.\n\nOn June 17th, a loanout agreement was drawn up for Spanky to appear in \"Here Comes The Band,\" which was scheduled to start on June 18th. The loanout was not to exceed two days. MGM paid $500.\n\nOn July 5th, Shirley Spencer wrote the following in her Handwriting Reveals Character column: \"I have an unusual letter from an unusual screen star, 6-year-old Spanky McFarland! In spite of his age, Spanky has been entertaining us for years now as the hero in the 'Our Gang' comedies. We will next see him in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer picture 'O'Shaughnessy's Boy,' for this little veteran of the screen is being borrowed for that full-length picture. Yes, indeed, Master George Robert Phillips McFarland is growing up. He writes 'I go to school every day at the Hal Roach Studio.' This is his first year, and although he looked forward to attending school, at the close of his letter, he writes with some eagerness, 'one more week of school and then vacation. I am going to the beach and have a good time.' And he further proves he is a real boy by telling me of some of the jokes they play on the teacher!\n\n\"If it seems surprising that an active boy of six could sit down and write a long letter in a very legible hand, we must remember that the little stars in Hollywood have splendid teachers and special advantages. Spanky is unusually bright for his age. I was interested to see carefulness in detail in his writing, a characteristic not in evidence usually in the yet unformed scripts of children. Mistakes in spelling have been neatly erased and written over again, and a letter not formed correctly has been retouched carefully.\n\n\"The pen pressure is heavy and firm, portraying the same quality of sturdiness which he displays on the screen. Good judgment is shown in the spacing and margins. The left margin is much straighter than my own! Such sense of proportion as is shown by the salutation and closing, even if he were supervised at the time, shows that he is observant, learns quickly, and can keep his mind on what he is doing until it is finished. Children as a rule are easily distracted. The long letter Spanky undertook would require considerable concentration and patience. I was very touched by the very small signature. Spanky hasn't 'gone Hollywood!' He's a real boy.\"\n\nOn September 21st, Spanky, along with Alfalfa, Buckwheat, Darla and Scotty, hosted an event at the California Pacific International Exposition at Balboa Park in San Diego, in which droves of young kids could gain admission for only a nickel and meet their heroes. The kids were also scheduled to lead a parade of home-made cars.\n\nOn September 24th, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported: \"'Spanky' McFarland, of 'Our Gang' comedies, will model for the typical American boy Community Chest posters.\"\n\nOn October 7th, a loanout agreement was drawn up for Spanky to appear in \"Trail of the Lonesome Pine,\" which was scheduled to start on October 18th. The contract stipulated that Spanky was to be returned on the evening of November 9th.\n\nOn October 15th, \"The Voice of Hollywood\" column reported the following: \"'Spanky' McFarland, juvenile Our Gang star, will have a leading role in 'Alone, Alas,' Jimmy Savo's first feature length picture for Hal Roach, which will go into production soon at the Hal Roach studios. The youngster, who celebrated his seventh birthday last week, has been seen recently in 'O'Shaughnessy's Boy' and 'Here Comes the Band'.\" This film was soon retitled Three On A Bench, but was shelved after only a few days of filming.\n\nThe November issue of the magazine Stage did a serious piece on Spanky.\n\nIn early November, Spanky's salary was increased to $300 a week.\n\n132.

Part of it reads: \"Spanky McFarland, 6-year-old leading man of 'Our Gang,' actually does have a doll for a stand-in; it's just his size, and with movable arms and legs. Child welfare laws are strict about youngsters spending long hours under hot lights.\"\n\nIn Bess Stephenson's January 28th article about Spanky for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, she states: \"He was honored with a commission as special deputy sheriff recently by Sheriff Biscauliz of Los Angeles County - all in solemn recognition of his work as bandit catcher.\" Later in the article, she writes: \"He was model for the Los Angeles Community Chest drive posters and advertising for 1936.\"\n\nOn February 17th, the Stockton Evening and Sunday Record reported the following: \"Little Spanky McFarland lost a front tooth recently at Big Bear, California, in the midst of production of Walter Wanger's natural color film 'The Trail of the Lonesome Pine.' Spanky, however, will continue to work with Sylvia Sidney, Henry Fonda, Fred MacMurray and Fred Stone, and the lost tooth will not injure the production in any way. The child star had just completed a sequence of the picture. He will appear in the next sequence minus his tooth, the first time in screen history that a child actor has sacrificed his beauty for his art.\"\n\nOn March 7th, Spanky's contract was renewed for another year, with the start date of March 9th. His salary was again reduced to $250 a week. This is according to the Roach payroll ledger, so if the newspaper reports were accurate, then there must have been some other way Spanky was making money.\n\nOn March 25th, the Chicago Tribune reported the following from the previous day: \"George Robert Phillips McFarland, 7 years of age, attended by two grownups and two dogs, visited the court of Superior Judge Douglas Edmonds today and obtained approval of his $400 to $1,000 a week contract with Hal Roach movie studio. George Robert, Etc., is known to film audiences as Spanky McFarland, member of 'Our Gang.' If the successive options on his services are lifted during the six years of the contract, Spanky will draw $1,000 weekly when 13.\"\n\nOn Apr. 4th, the Stockton Daily Evening Record (CA) reported the following: \"'Spanky' McFarland, 7-year-old starlet of Hal Roach's 'Our Gang' comedies, will be featured in full-length productions as well as in screen shorts in the future, according to the terms of a new five-year contract for his services just awarded him by Roach. The famous little 'rascal' becomes one of the highest salaried juvenile picture players in Hollywood when the agreement goes into effect next week. Before starting his next production, 'Spanky,' together with other members of the 'Gang,' will make a personal appearance tour through the middle western states, it is announced.\"\n\nAlso on April 4th, Spanky, along with Alfalfa, Buckwheat, Darla, Harold Switzer, Pete the Pup and MC Joe Cobb, appeared at the Fox Arlington theater in Santa Barbara for afternoon and evening performances.\n\nOn April 8th, the Evening Vanguard of Venice, CA, reported the following: \"Culver City loses part of its population tonight when the members of 'Our Gang' leave on their private car for a personal appearance tour. They open in Duluth Sunday (Apr. 12th). Those going include Spanky McFarland, Darla Hood, 'Alfalfa' and Harold Switzer, Buckwheat Thomas, and Pete the dog. Joe Cobb the former fat boy will act as master of ceremonies. They will be accompanied by their parents, their teacher Mrs. Fern Carter, who has been the Gang teacher for fifteen years and Jack Sidney, company manager. All of the old-timers of the Gang who are in Southern California will be on hand to wish them luck including Johnny Downs, Mary Kornman, Farina and Mickey Daniels.\" On April 12th, The Davenport Democrat and Leader (IA) added that the kids would have their own special \"play-car\" on the train.\n\nOn April 9th, the Our Gang entourage stopped in Ogden, UT, on their way to the first stop in their personal appearance tour: Duluth.\n\nOn the evening of April 10th, the Our Gang entourage stopped briefly at the Union Station in Omaha, NB, where they took questions from reporters.\n\nOn April 12th, the Our Gang kids opened their personal appearance tour in Duluth, MN, where they performed for three days. As the Sayre Daily Headlight-Journal (OK) reported on Apr. 22nd: \"The group makes five appearances daily, in a vaudeville act of 23 minutes. During this short time each member of the cast makes three changes in costumes.\"\n\nAlso on April 12th, The Minneapolis Journal published an article about the kids' plans for the future, with this to say about Spanky: \"Little 'Spanky' McFarland may be the hero to the 'Gang' and to millions of other children now, but he plans to be a real hero in his own estimation. He's going to be the best G man in the world and capture the most notorious criminals.\"\n\nOn April 14th, Louella Parsons reported the following: \"Even Greta Garbo herself could not have brought a bigger crowd to the Duluth movie theater than the members of the Our Gang comedy troupe who are making a personal appearance. The Duluth youngsters were so delighted with Spanky McFarland, Darla Hood, Alfalfa Switzer, Billy (Buckwheat) Thomas and Fatty Joe Cobb, master of ceremonies, that they came to the theater early and stayed late. Hal Roach's celebrated infants will be gone most of the Summer on tour.\"\n\nOn April 17th, the Our Gang kids arrived in Minneapolis in the morning for a week's engagement at the Minnesota Theater. The act was described as mostly consisting of songs by the various kids. The Minneapolis Star said this about Spanky: \"He sings, dances, plays his ukelele and cuts up in his own hilarious manner.\"\n\nOn April 22nd, The Minneapolis Journal published a version of Merle Potter's column in which the various Our Gang kids filled in for him. This is what Spanky had to say: \"Ever since we've come here, everybody asks how we make pictures. Guess if I tell how it is done, everybody will read it and then nobody will ask me again. We make our pictures on a great big sound stage at Mr. Roach's studio. They fix up things they call sets - sometimes a whole yard and house, sometimes only part of a room and sometimes just a basement. Then they turn on a million lights and it's even brighter than the sun. While the 'juicers' (the fellows who fix the lights and carry a lot of swell tools they let us play with sometimes) are fixing the lights to chase away the shadows, we kids play or study our lessons and they put dummies that look like us in our places while the cameras are set. Afterwards the director tells us the story and about what we have to do. In 'Our Gang Follies of 1936,' I had to make believe I was a director and tell the rest of the Gang what to do. That was easy, because just before I told them what to do, the director told me and I acted just like he did. They take each scene lots of times - from far away, up close and sort of half-way between. That's so they'll be sure to have the best possible shot. And, boy, I sure get excited when I'm supposed to do something. Lots of times I even forget I'm in pictures and what the director told me to do and then they have to take all those scenes all over again. It sure is lots of fun being in plays.\"\n\nOn April 23rd, The Minneapolis Journal reported the following: \"Spanky McFarland of Our Gang is really doing a Laugh, Clown, Laugh in his Minneapolis appearance. He's suffered two major tragedies this week. First of all the Gang wasn't able to see the stockyards - and they all wanted to go to South St. Paul. Second, Spanky wasn't able to get a real automatic pistol which has been his ambition for a long time. Down at police headquarters the other day, Spanky took Chief Forestal aside, saying he wanted to talk 'confidentially.' In a back room, off the detective bureau, the young flicker star asked the chief if he 'didn't have a spare rod nobody wanted.' The chief cooled him off by displaying a real machine gun.\"\n\nIt appears that the Our Gang kids arrived in Chicago on April 24th and stayed until the end of the month. The Chicago Daily Tribune ran ads during the week for the Chicago State theater, which featured the kids in person. Oddly, one of these ads was for May 1st, but it's pretty clear that they were no longer in town on that date.\n\nOn May 1st, the Our Gang kids arrived in Detroit in the morning for a week's engagement at the Michigan Theatre. Spanky stayed in his hotel bed this evening with a cold, according to reports. Turned out it was the measles.\n\nOn May 4th in Detroit, the Associated Press reported the following: \"Measles invaded 'Our Gang,' child motion picture troupe making a personal appearance at a theater here, and three members were in quarantine today. 'Spanky' McFarland, the 7-year-old 'leading man,' has the disease, and Darla Hood, 4, and William (Buckwheat) Thomas Jr., 4, were quarantined for lack of immunity. The remainder of the cast, including the dog, Pete, will continue their performance.\"\n\nOn May 5th, The Detroit Free Press ran an ad for the Gang's Michigan theater engagement, mentioning Alfalfa, Harold, Pete, Buckwheat and Joe, but not Spanky or Darla.\n\nOn May 8th, Movienews of Chicago published an article on Our Gang, with this to say about Spanky: \"Take 'Spanky' McFarland, for instance. Spanky is only seven, and has certain outstanding characteristics as to form and spirit that dig into the ticklish spots of one's disposition when he is seen in the screen comedies. First, he's chubby and cuddly with a turned up nose. Second, he seems gosh-awful full of tricks for such a cherubic looking bit of humanity. But know Spanky off the screen and you'll find that he is just a normal youngster, having his good and bad days, who hates to do his 'rithmetic and doesn't mind telling you just how much he hates it, either. Furthermore, he isn't the least bit averse to using little tricks to keep him from studying too hard. In these characteristics, you wouldn't have a hard time finding dozens of doubles for Spanky on any playground. Of course, they won't be as chubby, but they'll dislike their arithmetic quite as much!\"\n\nThe May 16th edition of the Intelligencer Journal of Lancaster, PA, reported that, during the Gang's visit to Cleveland (their next stop after Detroit), Spanky took up some fishing at nearby Lake Royal. The United Press of May 25th, however, reported that Spanky went to Cleveland to visit an aunt while the rest of the kids stayed in Detroit to finish their engagement there.\n\nAround May (by the 17th at the latest), the Spanky McFarland Safety Club was launched. Children could sign a safety pledge card and be handed a button identifying themselves as members of the club. The pledge card read as follows:\n\nI promise Our Gang:\n\nI will not play on busy streets.\n\nI will not hitch on autos, cars or trucks.\n\nI will stop, look and listen before crossing a street.\n\nI will not take any foolish chances.\n\nI will always play safe and try to help other boys and girls to do the same.\n\nThe May 20th St. Louis Globe-Democrat reported that Spanky and his family was visiting relatives in St. Louis. The way they tell it is that the tour was cut short by Spanky's measles outbreak and that his family was stopping in St. Louis on their journey home.\n\nOn May 25th, Spanky was a guest of the St. Louis Cardinals, getting his photo taken with Dizzy Dean, and watching the home team beat the Chicago Cubs.\n\nOn May 26th, Spanky's family spent the day with an aunt in Kansas City before embarking on their journey home to California. While at the house, he signed autographs for the children who lived on the block.\n\nDuring this year, an ad for Royal Cherry Gelatin included an Our Gang comic strip. Among the characters was Spanky.\n\nOn July 16th, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"Because Spanky McFarland is smitten with June Lang, too, he innocently brought to light a real romance that is progressing at the Hal Roach studio. The fortunate young man in the case is Joe Rivkin, Roach's casting director. The other day Rivkin took Miss Lang to luncheon and invited Spanky and little Darla Hood, another member of the Our Gang comedy unit. Without Rivkin's knowledge Spanky dated Miss Lang and took her to Venice for the day. He didn't think Rivkin would find out but Rivkin did and he teases poor Spanky about it every time the youngster goes into his office.\" On August 10th, the Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles elaborated: \"But while Joe was joyous over the return (from New York) of his girl friend, there was some sorrow in the heart of his rival, 'Spanky' McFarland. 'Spanky,' aged 7, as broad as he is long, and now appearing in a full-length comedy called 'General Spanky' on the Roach lot, was in the doldrums. Joe told the child rolly-polly that June was in town. 'So what?' asked 'Spanky' with a belligerent glint in his eye. He had sent her five telegrams while she was away. 'I thought you'd like to know,' said Joe. Whether or not 'Spanky' did want to know remained a riddle. The Rivkin guy, it is learned, is regarded by the youthful 'Spanky' somewhat in the light of an undesirable rival. 'Spanky,' with his $1200-a-week income - 52 weeks out of the year - likes to entertain Miss Lang. 'Spanky' doesn't throw parties for the young woman on a small scale either. When he takes a girl out he 'shoots the works.' Sometimes he spends two dollars! That means she can ride on the roller coaster as many times as 'Spanky' wants to. 'But, she can't tell me about how swell Joe Rivkin is,' 'Spanky' admitted.\"\n\nDuring July, by the 19th in any event, the Spanky Bar came into existence. This was an ice milk bar made by McColl Ice Cream Co. that cost five cents, and it was directly associated with Our Gang and Hal Roach Studios. 3 bar bags could be sent in for a Spanky lapel button, 10 bar bags for an 8x11 photo of Spanky, and 12 bar bags for a Spanky cap.\n\nFrom July to September, filming took place for \"General Spanky,\" a feature film with Spanky as its star. During this stretch, he made $750 a week.\n\nOn July 18th, Hal Roach Studios held its 15th anniversary celebration of the Our Gang series. Needless to say, Spanky was in attendance.\n\nAlso on July 18th, The Paterson Morning Call (NJ) reported the following: \"Life is just one school after another to Spanky McFarland. 'Our Gang' was out of classes a month this spring with measles, and had to work overtime during what would have been vacation to catch up. Two days after they finished real school the gang went back into the classrooms to be 'bored with education' and Spanky is flaming.\"\n\nOn July 24th, the Redwood City Tribune carried a photo of Spanky with his new stand-in, Joe Strauch of Chicago.\n\nOn July 27th, the Associated Press reported the following on the Gang's arrival in Sacramento: \"Spanky McFarland, of Our Gang fame in Hollywood, called on Governor Meriam, sat on his knee and made himself at home generally in the chief executive's office for a quarter of an hour to-day. General Spanky arrived with a company which will start shooting scenes to-morrow on the sternwheeler Cherokee.\"\n\nOn July 28th, The Sacramento Bee (CA) reported the following: \"A lively, chubby normal boy of 7 years who likes to fish and to run and, best of all, to play-act - that is Spanky McFarland. Spanky began work on the Sacramento River to-day in the starring role of the Hal Roach comedy feature picture, General Spanky - during which he expects to get in a lot of fishing off the sides of the Cherokee, the stern wheeler to be used in the filming.\n\n\"The 7-year-old actor had a busy day after arriving in Sacramento. He had a conference with Governor Frank F. Merriam, posed for newspaper photographers and tried to be polite to inquisitive reporters when all his thoughts were on seeing the boat on which he is to work. He stepped from the elevator in the Hotel Senator, accompanied by his father and mother and his 6-year-old brother, Tommy.\n\n\"'Mommy, give me 50 cents for a lighter,' he began pleading with he same familiar lisp that adds to his motion picture charm, as soon as his father was out of hearing distance. The lighter was to be a birthday present. 'You'll break me, Spank,' laughed Mrs. McFarland. 'Can you get a lighter for 50 cents here?' Spanky already had investigated the situation. 'A good one,' he urged, 'and they fill her up with juice for nothing the first time.'\n\n\"Mrs. McFarland, whose attitude toward her talented son is just like any average mother's toward her child, produced the coin and away sped Spanky. 'He asks for $5 like it was a nickel,' she said.\"\n\nOn August 6th, Paul Harrison reported the following in his syndicated column: \"George Robert Phillips McFarland, who will be eight years old on Oct. 2, is climaxing his five years as a leading man by starring in a feature picture. He has the title role, too, for the flicker will be called 'General Spanky.' Spanky isn't sure that he wants to be called Spanky any longer. Sounds infantile and is, in fact, a relic of his earliest days with Hal Roach and the 'Our Gang' comedies. Mr. McFarland is a veteran now, and seems to be still in the ascendancy. His salary has been boosted from $750 to $1,250 a week. But Spanky still gets spanked occasionally. Sometimes for swearing. Adults around the Roach studio have been trained for years to avoid profanity, but the kid star has picked up an impressive vocabulary somewhere. His other most frequent offense is rough-housing with his brother in the living room when their parents have company. You see, he's an exhibitionist, as are most actors.\n\n\"His brother Tom is 5, doesn't look at all like George Robert Phillips McFarland, and is not in the movies. The four McFarlands, together with an off-white mongrel named Tiny, live in a four-story house on the summit of a Hollywood hill. Spanky ordinarily has little chance for recreation at home; gets up at 7:45 a.m., is brought from the studio at 5 p.m., and goes to bed about 8. Fortuitously, he still is small for his age; stands 42 1/2 inches and weighs 52 pounds. He has had measles and whooping cough, and now has slight attacks of asthma.\n\n\"Interviewers never get anywhere with Spanky. He'll shake hands politely enough, but after that he is about as garrulous as Garbo. This doesn't seem to be shyness; he's just bored. He has a vivid imagination, and to playmates and studio executives he spins the wildest yarns. He's independent and a shade sassy, but not temperamental. When a director calls him before the camera, Spanky invariably says, 'Ah, nuts!' When he is confident of his lines and ready for the camera to roll, he says 'Okay, Toots.'\n\n\"Once his father asked him if he'd like to see Clark Gable. Spanky asked, 'What's Clark Gable - a horse?' When he met Constance Bennett, the actress gushed a greeting and kissed him. Spanky reared back and made the most frightful face he could muster.\n\n\"Robert McGowan, the kid expert who was his first director, declared that 'Spanky is a natural - the first genius I've directed since Jackie Cooper.' Mrs. McFarland: 'I wouldn't say that Sonny (his parents always have called him Sonny) is a genius, or has a superior intelligence. He's all boy and has a wonderful personality. His personality is what has made him popular.' At the studio he works four hours a day, studies three, plays one. He gets good grades, especially in spelling and drawing. Most of his spare time is spent making sketches. Spanky still doesn't learn his lines by reading them from the script; a director teaches him line by line, and explains the scene. He can remember as many lines as the average adult actor, and almost never blows up. But he often fails to deliver the proper expression.\n\n\"He's an honorary deputy sheriff of Los Angeles County, and proud of it. Spaghetti is his grand passion, but he's permitted to have it only once a week. He has no set allowance for spending money, and his parents are investing practically all his salary in real estate and annuities. They have to mail about 1,000 pictures each month to Spanky's fans. His own favorite actor is Fred MacMurray. Spanky and Tom have a room of their own, with twin beds. The place is cluttered with plaster dolls of the kind people sometimes win at carnival concessions. That's how Spanky got them; to him they're trophies, not dolls.\"\n\nAn August press release stated that Spanky had recently signed a new 7-year contract. This, of course, provides another variation on the topic.\n\nOn August 15th, the Stockton Independent (CA) reported the following: \"'Spanky' McFarland working in his first starring feature comedy, 'General Spanky,' has been given the dressing room of Charley Chase, who was with Hal Roach for 17 years. The chubby little 'Our Gang' hero has the old favorite's picture on the wall.\"\n\nOn August 17th, the Screen Boys' Club met at the home of W.S. Van Dyke to elect its officials, with Spanky in attendance.\n\nOn September 12th, Ruth Love reported the following in her syndicated column: \"There's a new romance building in Hollywood today, but sh-h-h, it's supposed to be a deep, dark secret. Spanky McFarland, Hal Roach's chubby star, let the cat out of the bag when he finished up the feature comedy 'General Spanky.' He told his mother he wants to meet Shirley Temple, but he doesn't want it to be just a publicity stunt! Seems Spanky, although he's been in pictures for the past five years, has never met Shirley, but one of his playmates did. And now Spanky wants to be introduced, so arrangements are being made.\"\n\nOn September 14th, the want ads of the Los Angeles Times listed several businesses and individuals who endorsed an appeal to citizens to drive carefully during the back-to-school season. One of these was Spanky McFarland. These appeared several times at least until the 17th.\n\nOn September 18th, Movienews of Chicago, IL, ran the following article written by Spanky himself: \"I'm not just exactly sure what I want to be when I grow up. Most of the time I think I would like to be an aviator, but I've never been up in an airplane so I'm not certain. Those great big planes look pretty fine to me when they go up in the air. Lots of times my Mama and Daddy take me over to an airport so I can watch the big ships start out for New York City. The Skychief leaves Union Airport near Los Angeles and lands in New York City just fifteen hours and twenty-three minutes later.\n\n\"I got to talk to some of the chief pilots and you know they sure have done a lot of interesting things. None of them have ever been a movie actor and that sort of worries me sometimes. Captain Eddie Bellande has been a flier almost all his life. Captain Alston Parker was a pilot on the first Byrd expedition to the South Pole. He told me lots of interesting things about the trip down there and he sure had a swell time. I thought it was awful hot at the South Pole, but he says it's colder than blazes down there. Boy, was I surprised!\"\n\nOn September 23rd, The Bend Bulletin carried an ad for the Sunfreeze Spanky Bar. Unlike the July reference, it's described as an actual ice cream bar, and as chocolate nut-coated. Another company that manufactured the bar was Modern Maid. Also on September 23rd, the Imperial Valley Press of El Centro, CA, reported the following: \"A new ice cream concoction has been brought to Imperial Valley by Arden Farms. It is called the 'Spanky' Bar and it's the official bar of the famous juvenile movie stars of 'Our Gang' comedies. Purchasers of this new bar are eligible for membership in a new club to be known as the Sunfreze 'Our Gang' club. Membership cards will be issued to members, there will be membership buttons, beautiful red, white and blue caps and also autographed pictures of Spanky McFarland, the popular little comedian, for members in good standing.\"\n\nFrom a press release by Fred A. Purner: \"Producer Hal E. Roach has appointed Dr. Henry Dietrich, Los Angeles pediatrician, to supervise the diet and direct the health of the children who enact the 'Our Gang' film comedies. Spanky McFarland, Darla Hood, Alfalfa Switzer and Buckwheat Thomas, who recently were taken down with the measles in Detroit and had their personal appearance tour terminated, will undergo individual examinations with recommendations to be made for essentials in their health and well-being. 'Baby Patsy' May and 'Porky' Lee, other 'little rascals' of 'Our Gang', will be included and there will be periodical inspections and medical treatments with the consent and co-operation of the parents. A special pediatrician for child actors is something new in Hollywood. The 'Our Gang' members have had their own school room and teacher right at the Roach Studios during the fifteen years the various members have been appearing on the screen and they have their own playgrounds and recreation periods.\"\n\nOn September 29th, Louella Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Spanky McFarland and thirty kids will make merry on the Venice pier on account of it's Spank's eighth birthday.\"\n\nOn October 11th, the Los Angeles Times reported on Spanky's recent birthday celebration at the Venice Amusement Pier.\n\nOn October 23rd, Spanky attended Porky Lee's 3rd birthday party at the Our Gang Cafe.\n\nSpanky attended a game in which Rice College \"trounced\" George Washington university, or at least that's what was reported on November 1st. Rice DID beat Washington the previous day, October 31st, in Houston, so presumably this is where Spanky was that day, though the score was only 12-6.\n\nOn November 1st, Alma Whitaker reported that Spanky and Alfalfa were both half a grade ahead in school.\n\nDuring the making of \"Reunion In Rhythm\" in December, the Our Gang set was visited by Patience, Richard and Johnny Abbe, three young siblings who were gathering material for a book that would be published in 1937 called Of All Places!. This is what they said about Spanky: \"Spanky MacFarlane was expecting us. When we laid eyes on him and he laid eyes on us, a little colored boy who was sitting next to him also doing lessons with the schoolteacher said, 'There they are.' So Spanky came over to us and shook hands. Spanky is a little fat boy, eight years old. This is his history: He has been acting since he was two years old and now he is eight and he signed a seven year contract, so that will make him fifteen years old when he is through, if he is through by then. This will make him quite rich. He already has a big car. So he won't come off so badly in any case. He probably never thought he would come to this when he started in. His mother says he gets very bored when he is home not working, so I guess this is where he belongs. It is all what you get used to. He reads Big Little books, is an expert football player, is quite handsome in a fat way, and has no use for love. He has a brother who doesn't care to be in the movies, but he hangs around anyway. When he is not working he goes to school on the set anyway. His mother is not old. The reason why he got this name is because when he was young his mother kept saying, 'Now be careful or I'll spank you. Spanky, spanky, spanky.' So now he is and always will be Spanky until he changes it himself.\n\n\"Spanky could not understand why we are going to China in a fruit boat, so he asked us right away why we didn't go in a passenger steamer because of the comfort. So Mamma said a fruit boat stops at all the ports and you see the people and you are not in a hurry. But Spanky shook his head and didn't agree. He said it was more convenient in a passenger ship. And he certainly is not a sissy - by no means. I suppose that is why he's fat. He likes comfort.\"\n\nLater in the book, they write: \"Spanky won't stand for anyone babying around him. He could be very tough I imagine if anyone got fresh with him. I, Patience, am collecting autographs and when I asked Darla, Spanky looked over and sneered in quite a sneery way and said, 'Cut out the love and kisses.' When we asked little Baby Patsy what she was going to be Spanky said she didn't know how to think yet, so why ask her.\"\n\nOn December 20th, The Lincoln Star of Lincoln, NB, reported the following: \"'Spanky' McFarland, chubby favorite of the 'Our Gang' comedy series, donned a miniature uniform of the postal service on the Metro lot this week and helped tote packages and letters to other members of the troupe. 'Spank' probably figures this good deed will undo all the screen devilment he's been up to for the past year.\"\n\nOn December 23rd, Spanky assisted Santa Claus in handing out gifts to orphans at the annual Christmas party of the Los Angeles Press Club.\n\nAlso on December 23rd, Jimmie Fidler reported the following in his syndicated column: \"Hal Roach, despite his many years as producer of 'Our Gang' comedies, still has things to learn about kids. On the eve of commencing work on a full-length picture with the youngsters, Hal decided to reward them with a fine new dressing room bungalow. It was very swank; I am sure Jean Harlow or Joan Crawford would have grabbed the building with gusto. But not the kids. They stood glumly in a group, then went into a conference from which Spanky McFarland emerged as spokesman. 'Aw gee, Mr. Roach,' he complained, 'we don't want a bungalow. We want a clubhouse like we had in our last picture.' They got it; a rickety building that cost $40, while the $5,000 dressing quarters have apparently gone to waste.\"\n\n143.

This was announced over local radio station WBGN. It's apparent that Spanky's presence wasn't necessary, as he was informed of this via telegram.\n\nOn January 20th, Spanky was among dozens of civic leaders and entertainers who extended their congratulations to President Roosevelt on his second inauguration in an ad posted in The Los Angeles Times.\n\nOn January 22nd, The Altoona Tribune (PA) reported that Spanky had received so many badges, medals and honorary buttons that his mother bought him a trophy case. \"Here are just a few of his titles: American Legion Colonel in Hollywood Post; Texas Centennial Ranger; Honorary California State Highway Patrolman; Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff; Minneapolis Lieutenant of Police. The Hollywood Post made quite a ceremony at the national convention in Cleveland when they presented the commission and badge. Governor Allred of Spanky's home state of Texas sent by air mail a most imposing commission. In Sacramento, Governor Merriam of Calfornia and Highway Commissioner Engels were to the fore with a miniature highway badge. Spanky's main concern is that the badges and buttons are real. When he shows them to his playmates the question has been raised by them that perhaps after all they are tin and not regular. But when Spanky shows the commissions he stops them. Spanky has served as mascot for the national safety campaign; he has countless buttons and membership cards from clubs and associations, and he has his own birthday and 'Our Gang' clubs.\"\n\nOn February 9th, Spanky was among dozens of undersigned civic leaders who endorsed a traffic safety campaign published in The Los Angeles Times.\n\nOn February 16th, Henry Sutherland reported in his syndicated column that Spanky was recently signed to a new contract.\n\nOn February 19th, Jimmie Fidler included the following in his column: \"'Spanky' McFarland, 56-pound maestro of 'Our Gang' comedies, and Babe Hardy, Stan Laurel's 300-odd pound screen partner, happened to meet at the same Hollywood tailor shop for fittings. Each was trying on a dress suit. Young Spanky's eyes grew wider and wider as the tailor draped the necessary yards of material around the mountainlike Hardy. At length his awe demanded to be spoken, and he gasped: 'Gee, Mr. Hardy, was you ever a little feller, like me?'\"\n\nOn March 18th, Spanky's new contract was court-approved for the next year, in which his weekly salary would be $200. This according to the July 18, 1937, Chicago Tribune. It also says that the previous year's contract, which was apparently dissolved, was for a period of six years, in which he would make an ascending amount from $400 to $1,000.\n\nOn March 31st, the Hollywood Citizen-News reported that Spanky had attended the recent birthday party of Baby Patsy May, which was modified to includes presents for Alfalfa Switzer and Buckwheat Thomas, both of whose parties had been cancelled due to a wave of influenza.\n\nOn April 8th, Paul Harrison reported the following in his syndicated column: \"Spanky McFarland isn't washed up yet, though he's nearing the age when he'd rather be called George than 'Spanky.' Hal Roach has extended his contract a year, but for no more money.\"\n\nOn April 10th, Henry Sutherland reported the following in his syndicated column: \"Spanky McFarland, 9, is a business man who insists on keeping his books straight. On the major lot to pose for commercial stills, he interrupted a grownup conference to pay Mae West a dollar he borrowed to bet on a prize fight months ago.\"\n\nOn April 17th, an ad for the Bud Murray School for Stage, Screen & Radio appeared in the Hollywood Citizen-News, which included Spanky as among the Our Gang kids who had studied dancing there.\n\nOn May 6th, the Evening State Journal of Lincoln, NB, published an article on the recent annual sales convention at M-G-M, which was attended by the newspaper's own Barney Oldfield, the writer of the article. Also in attendance were Spanky, Alfalfa and Darla.\n\nOn May 20th, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported the following: \"They're exactly like any batch of neighborhood kids, except that Spanky McFarland is phenomenally good in arithmetic. I found them in school on the Hal Roach lot and Spanky's numbers were 100 per cent accurate. He is 8 years old now and in the third grade. He grows so slowly that the members of the Gang are shooting up ahead of him - but not in mentality. He is actually, as well as on the screen, quick to figure things out. He catches on to lessons so fast that other bright boys in the Gang (Alfalfa, for instance) holler 'Whoa!'\n\n\"The Roach publicity department is a little sensitive to questions about Spanky's size, because it has been suggested that hard work has dwarfed him. 'It isn't true,' they say, 'doctors examine the kids once a month. Spanky is as healthy a boy as you'd find anywhere in the country. He grows, but you don't notice it because he's so pudgy.' \"\n\nOn May 24th, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that the Our Gang kids would be starting their summer vacation in June, with Spanky coming out to Dallas to visit his grandmother. On June 11th, Movienews Weekly of Chicago, IL, reported that Spanky would be spending most of the summer with his grandmother.\n\nOn May 27th, Henry Sutherland included the following in his column: \"Said Constance Bennett to Spanky McFarland: 'You have to work hard if you want to be an actor.' Said Spanky McFarland to Constance Bennett: 'That's all right, then. I'm going to be a G-man.'\"\n\nOn June 20th, the Los Angeles Times reported that Freddie Bartholomew had recently thrown a party for Tommy Kelly at the MGM studio's executive bungalow. Spanky was among the hundred or so movie kids that attended.\n\nOn June 30th, the Hollywood Citizen-News reported on the recent birthday party of Fred Purner, Jr. Among the guests were all of the contract players of Our Gang, including Spanky.\n\nDuring this year, a comic book featuring the Our Gang kids called The Dandy debuted. Among the characters was Spanky.\n\nOn July 9th, The Morning Avalanche of Lubbock, TX, reported on the results of a theater survey taken in the city. Shirley Temple and Jane Withers tied with 15 votes each. The article doesn't mention how many votes their opposition got, but that Spanky beat out Freddie Bartholomew by more than six votes.\n\nOn July 17th, the Associated Press reported that Spanky's salary was now up to $250 a week. However, a July 22nd studio document listing the kids' salaries for \"Fishy Tales\" reveals that he was making $200 a week.\n\nAlso on July 17th, Spanky took part in a comedy baseball game played by various Hollywood stars for charity. As reported by Associated Press, \"the midget star, Spanky McFarland, rapped out one of the few real hits of the game.\" United Press elaborated: \"Vince Barnett, Hollywood's leading 'ribber,' would not permit Spanky to run bases. He wheeled him around in a perambulator as far as second base where Spanky revolted and got out to finish the base running.\"\n\nOn August 16th, The Detroit Free Press (MI) reported the following: \"With 'Spanky' McFarland, Darla Hood and 'Porky' Lee recovered from tonsil operations, Director Gordon Douglas is getting ready to start the new series of 'Our Gang' comedies in their seventeenth year.\" Looking over the shooting dates, it would seem that these operations took place in July.\n\nOn September 17th, the Associated Press reported the following: \"A guardian must be appointed to straighten out the tangle of claims to the salary of 'Spanky' McFarland, child film actor, Superior Judge Walter S. Gates has ruled today. Jack Edelstein obtained a judgment for $3,500 against 'Spanky's' father, Robert Emmett McFarland, and tried to attach the child's salary. 'Spanky's' mother also claimed the salary, as Judge Gates ordered a guardian appointed.\"\n\nOn October 7th, The St. Louis Star and Times reported on 57,599 questionnaires returned from St. Louis movie fans regarding their theater-going preferences, including favorite child stars. Results were divided between first run and neighborhood theaters. Spanky came in ninth place at first run theaters with 307 votes, and eighth place at neighborhood theaters with 397 votes. Not surprisingly, Shirley Temple took the prize with around ten thousand votes in each category. On November 6th, the Daily News of New York published slightly contradictory results, with Spanky receiving 690 overall votes, tying him with Judy Garland for 8th place.\n\nOn October 20th, the Portland Press Herald (ME) reported the following: \"Spanky McFarland is the leading man of the 'Our Gang' comedies and is the head man off the screen, too. Miss Fern Carter, who is the school teacher for the children and who has seen many 'Our Gang' children grow up, told us that Spanky is a very lovable child. He is nine and is in the fourth grade. The children go to school together. They are different ages and in different grades, but Miss Carter gives them individual attention and individual instruction. Miss Carter said that Spanky is very advanced for his age. He has a remarkable memory and will remember a lesson much better if it is given him orally.\"\n\nFrom a press release: \"Mr. and Mrs. R. E. McFarland and their sons Spanky and Tommy are entertaining members of the Our Gang comedy troupe and some of their younger friends at a Hallowe'en dinner Sunday evening. Grouped about a table illuminated with jack o'lanterns and decorated in orange and black will be Pat Ross, Penny Laws, Dickie Jones, Clark Flake, Darla Hood, Baby Patsy May, Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer, Billie 'Buckwheat' Thomas, Eugene 'Porky' Lee, Harold Switzer and their parents.\"\n\nOn November 17th, Spanky attended a luncheon at the Roach studio honoring Darla's 6th birthday.\n\nOn December 11th, the Our Gang kids were afternoon guests of the city of Hermosa Beach, CA, officially welcomed at a civic reception, as part of a Christmas extravaganza. They also took part in a subsequent parade. A press release from the Roach studio read as follows: \"Hermosa Beach welcomes 'Our Gang' today, when the famous Hal Roach screen youngsters will be guests at the beach city in a gala luncheon, parade, and theater party that has occasioned Mayor Al Schupner to declare a civic holiday for the affair. More than 2000 school children will take part in the festivities, which will honor the formation of an 'Our Gang' club to include youngsters from Hermosa, Manhattan, and Redondo Beach. A luncheon attended by 50 civic officials and dignitaries will be held this morning at 11:30 at the Hermosa Beach city hall. City Councilman, Harold Matthews, will preside. Following the luncheon, a parade headed by the forty-piece band of Redondo High School will take the famous screen youngsters and their escorts from the City Hall to the Fox Hermosa theater, where a special matinee showing will be held. Also taking part in the parade will be troops of Girl and Boy Scouts, and representatives from the Parent-Teacher Association. Spanky McFarland, Alfalfa Switzer, Darla Hood, Porky Lee, Buckwheat Thomas, and Baby Patsy of 'Our Gang,' will appear in person on the stage of the theater, to be introduced to the audience by their director, Gordon Douglas.\"\n\nOn December 19th, Spanky and Alfalfa served as mascots for the M-G-M Lions juvenile football team, which lost the game to the Sequoia Panthers.\n\n151.

Cohen wrote in his column: \"Spanky McFarland, the 'Our Gangster,' is leaving the coast shortly on a personal appearance tour.\"\n\nOn January 29th, Aleen Wetstein of The Pittsburgh Press wrote an article about a recent scenario written by Spanky called \"Betty's Strange Adventure.\" I'll leave out Wetstein's attempt at a humorous critique of Spanky's story, and simply reprint the story itself, which Wetstein included in her article in full: \"Once upon a time a little girl was walking in the woods one day and suddenly she heard a funny noise. She stopped and then she heard it again. Then she said, 'I wonder what that funny noise is?' Then a wolf ran out from behind a tall tree and jumped down in a very big hole. The little girl ran after him but when she reached the hole she found nothing but a few of the tracks he left so she started walking back home for it was getting late and supper must be getting cold and mother might be worried.\n\n\"When she reached home her mother was calling dinner. She opened the door and she was so hungry she ate so much that she had to go to bed to digest the food she ate. The next morning Betty got up and she ran down to breakfast and ate as fast as she could eat. Then she ran out of the door and ran to the big hole and found the wolf dead. The end!\"\n\nOn January 30th, Spanky, along with Alfalfa, served as a mascot for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Lions, a football team made up of juvenile stars, which played the Wilmar Tech Bengals on this date at the Union High School Stadium in El Monte, CA.\n\nOn January 31st, Louella Parsons reported the following in her sydicated column: \"Spanky McFarland, at the ripe old age of eight, retires from 'Our Gang' comedies. He has been with them since he was 18 months old but he is such a good little actor he's sure to land at some other studio.\" His retirement was actually forthcoming, and wasn't widely covered in the news until a month later.\n\nOn February 1st, a rough synopsis was written for the upcoming Our Gang film \"The Awful Tooth.\" Spanky was included in the synopsis, but not in the eventual film.\n\nOn February 6th, Spanky, along with other members of the Our Gang troupe, guested on the MBS radio program Thirty Minutes In Hollywood with George Jessel.\n\nOn February 10th, the Oakland Tribune reported that Spanky was doing a vaudeville tour in the east with Jack Pepper. Spanky's part in the act was to heckle Pepper from a stage box. It's fairly clear that Spanky was on a brief break from the Our Gang series and doing the same act that he and Pepper would do a couple of months later when Spanky temporarily retired from the series. Pepper had previously worked with Spanky in \"Bear Facts.\"\n\nOn February 25th, \"Came The Brawn\" reached its final day of shooting and Spanky left the Our Gang series for the next few months.\n\nOn February 28th, the Associated Press reported the following: \"George McFarland - better known as Spanky - who is going on 10, announced his retirement today. He is retiring from Hal Roach 'Our Gang' comedies, in which he has been one of the starring members for seven years. Spanky isn't quitting the screen. He'll play in feature films.\"\n\nOn March 1st, the United Press reported the following: \"Spanky McFarland retired today from Our Gang comedies because of old age - almost 9 years. After seven years with Hal Roach's gang, Spanky is 'in a groove,' his father explained. The boy will go on a ten-week personal appearance tour and then consider bids from three major studios.\" It was reported that Spanky's tour would include visits to Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and other cities. The family's journey towards the East Coast reportedly began on March 5th.\n\nOn March 6th, the Los Angeles Times reported that S. S. Van Keuren had staged a farewell luncheon for Spanky the previous week, attended by Gordon Douglas, Alfalfa, Darla, Buckwheat, Porky, Gary, and the parents of the various kids.\n\nOn March 11th, Spanky stopped in Claremore, OK, on his way to the east coast. On April 5th, the Associated Press reported the following out of Claremore, OK: \"Spanky McFarland doesn't want to be Spanky any more. He announced that as he stopped here on his way to the east. He wants to be called by his real name - George. The McFarlands stopped here for dinner 'just to see what Will Rogers' home town looks like.' \"\n\nOn March 12th and 13th, Spanky visited an aunt and uncle in University City, MO, on his journey eastward.\n\nOn March 13th, Spanky visited an aunt in Indianapolis, IN. As The Indianapolis News so accurately described it: \"Mr. and Mrs. George Sleeth had as their guests for the week-end, Mrs. Sleeth's sister, Mrs. R. E. McFarland, Mr. McFarland, and sons Frankie and Tommy, of Hollywood. Frankie is the 'Spanky McFarland' of Our Gang Comedies.\"\n\nOn March 16th, The Hartford Daily Courant (CT) reported the following: \"Last night this reporter saw first hand how maddening it is to want a dollar more than you want anything else in life and not know where or how to get it. Spanky McFarland of Hollywood is the 'fellow' who wanted that dollar. He had just arrived in Hartford for personal appearances at the State Theater from Thursday through Saturday, and despite everything he could do to the contrary his mother inadvertently left him not a minute for himself. The youngster wanted to buy her a birthday present, but he couldn't get a dollar and he couldn't get a minute alone.\n\n\"The youngster looks just as he has for years in our gang comedies. He weighs 68 pounds, he likes everything and characterically enough he showed us the 'child's menu' he had taken from the train for a souvenir. He was dressed in a sailor suit, he said it was a 'dress suit,' and wrapped in a Hollywood ulster topped with a sailor cap. Sparkling brown eyes and rosy cheeks complete the picture of this 9-years-old healthy little boy. His mother had to hurry him through the Bond lobby because he had started signing autographs. He drew pictures for the druggist to 'illustrate' more clearly the drink he wanted. '\"Dr. Pepper\" is what we call it in Hollywood,' he said.\"\n\nOn March 17th, Spanky began a four-day engagement at the State Theater in Hartford, CT. Also on this day, he was made \"Mayor For a Day\" in Hartford and deputy sheriff of Hartford County. Much of this was in connection with the Spanky Safety Club. Spanky was on the same bill with The Three Stooges, who gave him pointers on playing the trumpet.\n\nOn March 18th, The Hartford Daily Courant (CT) elaborated on Spanky's act: \"The act opens with Mr. Pepper singing a song about Broadway stars being lured to Hollywood. Then he introduces the youthful and chubby McFarland who sings a song, 'Hollywood Gone Broadway,' in which he tells how Hollywood actors are invading the vaudeville stage. With the able assistance of Mr. Pepper, 'Spanky' answers several questions and plays on a trumpet. While 'Spanky' goes backstage, Mr. Pepper sings and plays songs on the ukelele which are very well received.\"\n\nOn March 21st, The Hartford Daily Courant (CT) reported the following: \"Nathan Hurvitz...has become tutor to 'Spanky' McFarland, youthful member of Our Gang of motion picture fame, and his younger brother, Tommy, it was announced Friday (Mar. 18th). Hurvitz, a graduate of Weaver High School and Connecticut State College, will accompany the McFarland youngsters during their present tour of personal appearances which will extend until June. 'Spanky' and his brother have been having an unscheduled vacation from their studies, as the tutor who was to come from the West Coast to accompany them has been taken ill. It was while 'Spanky' was making a personal appearance at the State Theater that his parents met the Hartford man. Both youngsters will have three hours schooling a day, from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m., if possible, complying with the California school laws. Reading, writing and arithmetic is on their curriculum, as well as geography and government. Their new tutor has already entered upon his duties.\"\n\nOn March 24th, Spanky performed three shows at the Loew Poli Palace in Meriden, CT.\n\nOn April 15th, Spanky began an engagement at the Michigan Theater in Detroit. It was reported that Spanky included a trumpet version of \"Bei Mir Bist De Schoen\" in his act. On April 16th, Len G. Shaw of the Detroit Free Press opined: \"Paired with Jack Pepper, who does some good vocalizing on his own account, Spanky keeps up a running comment that is snappy, proves himself to be a real comedian and is in every way a distinct asset.\"\n\nOn April 17th, Spanky appeared on the MBS radio program Thirty Minutes In Hollywood with George Jessel.\n\nAn April 21st ad in the Detroit Free Press reveals that Spanky was still playing at the Michigan Theater in Detroit on this date. It must have been his final performance there, though, since he was in Chicago the following day.\n\nOn April 22nd, Spanky started an engagement at the Chicago Theater in Chicago, IL.\n\nIn her April 23rd syndicated column, Sheilah Graham reported the following: \"Spanky McFarland spent five of his seven years leading 'Our Gang' comedies for Hal Roach, with a concluding salary of $350. He is now on a personal appearance tour, getting $2000 weekly. Of this, Spanky receives $1 a week to spend. The rest comes to him via a $100,000 trust fund, payable at 21.\"\n\nOn April 27th, Spanky's engagement at the Chicago Theater was still ongoing.\n\nOn April 29th, Louella Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Speaking of youngsters, I was also interested to hear that Spanky McFarland, who outgrew the Our Gang comedies and went on (a) personal appearance tour, is due back in town to test for Sol Lesser's 'Peck's Bad Boy.'\"\n\nAlso on April 29th, The Charlotte News (NC) reported that Spanky had been in New York the previous week. \"Visiting drummers in the lobby of the Park Central Hotel had their hats knocked off last week, and were they peevish. A fat little boy was playing ball in the lobby, and it was 'Spanky' McFarland of 'Our Gang' comedies.\"\n\nOn May 15th, a gathering of honorary Texas Rangers took place to honor Gov. James V. Allred of Texas at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Reportedly, Spanky McFarland was among them, though this seems unlikely in light of his not having gotten home from his tour yet.\n\nOn May 16th, Louella Parsons reported the Spanky was to be among the boys in the upcoming production of \"Boys Town.\" This didn't end up happening.\n\nOn May 17th, Spanky stopped in El Paso, TX, while en route from New York to Los Angeles. If we count the weeks from March 5th (when he first left Los Angeles), then his ten-week tour fits pretty nicely within this timeframe.\n\nOn May 18th, the El Paso Herald-Post (TX) reported the following: \"Spanky McFarland is only nine years old but he can give autographs alongside the best of them. Spanky and his parents, Mr. and Mrs. R. E. McFarland, were in El Paso en route to Los Angeles where he is soon to go to work on new pictures. He was recognized while buying some new shoes. All kinds of pads were presented for his signature and Spanky turned them out with machinelike speed.\"\n\nOn July 10th, The Sunday Star of Washington, DC, reported that Spanky had left the Our Gang series because MGM was concerned that he had been in the series for so long that the public might think he was a dwarf.\n\nOn July 12th, Louella Parsons reported the following in her syndicated column: \"Funny thing, M-G-M hunted the town over for a leader for the Our Gang comedies and just could not find a youngster that would do. Just when they were ready to give up the whole idea, spunky Spanky McFarland returned to town from a personal appearance tour. Spanky, one of the cutest kids who ever came to Hollywood, graduated from Our Gang because he was supposed to be too big, but M-G-M, who will do these comedies in place of Hal Roach, grabbed him anyway for the first picture, which starts July 18th. It is my personal opinion the studio could not do better, for Spanky has what it takes in mischievous antics and cute personality.\" Spanky was initially contracted to make 12 Our Gang shorts, which would cover the entire 1938/39 film schedule.\n\nOn July 20th, shooting began for \"Aladdin's Lantern,\" marking Spanky's return to the Our Gang series.\n\nOn August 10th, the columnist known as Rambling Reporter reported the following: \"Pinto Cox, pint-size edition of Dad Ernie Cox, almost broke into the motion pictures at Moreno lake the other day, all on account of a very heated argument, amounting at times to violent demonstration, with Spanky McFarland of the 'Our Gang' comedies. Thus far RR hasn't been able to learn if the argument was over Pinto's freckles or Spanky's girth, nor who won.\"\n\nOn August 19th, Louella Parsons reported that Spanky had been added to the cast of \"Peck's Bad Boy With The Circus.\"\n\nOn August 24th, Spanky appeared on the KEHE radio program Listen Ladies starring George Jay.\n\nOn August 26th, the Richmond Times-Dispatch (VA) reported the following: \"Spanky McFarland, the present star of the series, has been with the crowd longer than any other child, because he hasn't grown for a long, long time. In fact, he's been there so long, that there is a rumor around Hollywood that the boy is 15 years old. That isn't true, he's nine, and has been in the comedies for six years.\"\n\nElsewhere, it says: \"Spanky chews gum, and parks it behind his ear between shots.\"\n\nOn October 13th, the Monrovia News-Post (of Monrovia, CA) reported that Spanky was slated to take part in the October 28th Junior Chamber of Commerce \"Musical Revue,\" \"providing he is not called for work that evening.\"\n\nThe October 30th issue of The Lincoln Star reported the following: \"Spanky McFarland has organized a football team of moppets known as the Small Fries. In the first game against the North Hollywood Giants (12 years and under), the Small Fries won in a sprint, 66 to 60. Tiz said both the seat of Spanky's pants and his tongue were dragging on the ground.\"\n\nOn November 27th, Louella Parsons reported the following: \"'Spanky' McFarland, the cute little fatty of 'Our Gang' kids, is training like mad to whittle himself down so he can make a test for the role of 'Tarzan Jr.' in the next Weissmuller opus...\"\n\nOn December 9th, Spanky, along with Jack Pepper, was on the program of a variety show held at the North Hollywood Recreation Center.\n\nOn December 13th, the Oakland Tribune reported the following: \"M-G-M has lifted the option of Spanky McFarland, who goes next into 'Our Gang Follies of 1939.' \"\n\n163.
