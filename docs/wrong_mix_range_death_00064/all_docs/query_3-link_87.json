I actually saw him once, when I was a kid, circa 1977. My dad took the whole family to see The Clancy Brothers, and Roach was the opening act. The venue was the Villanova University fieldhouse (then the home of the school's basketball team), which was packed.\n\nI'm sure the Clancys were great, but I was too young to appreciate them at the time. As for Roach, he told one-liners for half an hour or so, each one sillier than the next. I only remember one joke he told: He was sitting on a subway, and a man walked up to him and asked \"Are you reading that newspaper you're sitting on?\" Even at age 12 or so, I immediately thought \"He stole that joke from David Brenner!\" Brenner told the joke better (as a story, saying he had been repeatedly asked the question on subway rides), and gave it a punch line (he said \"Yes,\" got up, turned the page, and sat down again). Roach did it quicker - he just said the one line, then plowed on to the next joke. He kept it simple, for an audience that wanted it simple. That was his style, and it made him popular with a dedicated, if limited, audience for decades.\n\n> The teacher said to this boy, “What’s Gandhi’s first name?” He said,\n\n> “Goosey Goosey”.\n\nI had to read this joke a couple times before it made sense. I think it only works if you pronounce \"Gandhi\" with an Irish accent (rhyming it with \"candy\"). And even then...\n\n-Tim"
