        "text": "Renée Adorée\n\nBorn: Jeanne de la Fonte, September 30, 1898, in Lille, France\n\nDied: October 5, 1933, in Tujunga, California\n\nRenée Adorée was an exotic dancer film star from France, whose career found her playing second tier roles in M-G-M productions.\n\nBorn into a family of circus performers, Adorée was acting as a dancer with her parents from a very early age. The family was performing in Russia when the World War began, so they fled to England. Touring in the UK and Australia brought her much attention.\n\nIn 1919, she was cast in a Shubert musical revue which toured the U.S. before opening as Oh, What a Girl! on Broadway. The Shuberts put her in another touring show in 1920 called The Dancer. She broke into films by appearing in The Strongest in 1920, which had been based on a novel written by George Clemenceau, Prime Minister of France. She became a Fox contract player after this, playing opposite John Gilbert in an adaptation of (The Count of) Monte Cristo in 1922.\n\nAfter making a couple of films for Louis B. Mayer Productions, she became an M-G-M contract player, and was subsequently selected by director King Vidor to play the female lead in The Big Parade opposite John Gilbert, in 1925; it became one of the greatest commercial and artistic successes of the silent era. Her appearance in Howard Hughes' production of The Mating Call in 1928, became controversial due to Adorée's performing a nude swimming scene.\n\nAdorée was a \"guest of honor\" at the \"Midnite Matinee\" performances of both Sid Grauman's \"Broadway Nights\" Prologue and the film The Broadway Melody, on Saturday, March 16, 1929.\n\nAlthough she was a major star, she was beginning to slow down. She was diagnosed with tuberculosis. She made her final film (and only real sound picture) Call of the Flesh with Ramón Novarro in 1930, against doctor's orders. Upon completeting the picture, she was packed off to a sanitarium in Arizona, where she spent the next two years. Thought to be well enough to return to the cameras, she returned to Hollywood, but her condition relapsed. She died in the modest home she had created in Tujunga in 1933. Lou Alter\n\nBorn: June 18, 1902, in Haverhill, Massachusetts\n\nDied: November 5, 1980, in New York, New York\n\nSongwriter and pianist Louis Alter began playing piano in nickelodeons at the age of 13. The next year (!), he snagged a replacement gig as Kelly in the Broadway musical The Show of Wonders in 1916. While studying with Stuart Mason at Boston's New England Conservatory of Music, Alter wrote a few songs for the Broadway musical A la Carte, which flopped in 1927. In the meantime, he toured extensively with vaudeville star Nora Bayes from 1924 until her death in 1928. Alter got a couple of his songs into the Broadway revue Earl Calloll's Vanities, which ran for six months beginning in August 1928.\n\nBefore long, Alter was in Hollywood, where his songs found their places in films, beginning with his working on arrangements used in The Hollywood Revue of 1929. Sid Grauman asked Alter to appear onstage at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee of The Hollywood Revue of 1929 on Saturday, September 7, 1929. Alter shared the bill with Carlotta King, The Rounders , and Basil Rathbone.\n\nThat November, Joan Crawford warbled Alter's tune \"That Wonderful Something Is Love\" in her first talkie called Untamed. Alter kept himself busy: he contributed songs to the Broadway shows Sweet and Low (with Fanny Brice, George Jessel and Borrah Minevitch!) in 1930 and Ballyhoo of 1930 (featuring Chaz Chase as \"A Gourmand\" and W. C. Fields in December 1930; meanwhile, Alter was closely associated as piano accompanist to singers Beatrice Lille and Helen Morgan.\n\nDuring World War II, Alter was busy arranging shows on the West Coast while serving in the U.S. Army Air Forces. After the war, Alter continued to work in an assortment of films. He also composed some concert music.\n\nAlter's most famous song seems to be the title song for the M-G-M Technicolor short musical Manhattan Serenade, released in December 1929. The song has been used in a few films, from Broadway Rhythm (which played the Chinese in April 1944) to The Godfather (released in 1972). More recently, his song \"Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?,\" written for the 1947 musical New Orleans, has been appearing in a number of projects as well. Another popular tune of Alter's is \"You Turned the Tables on Me\" from the comedy Kiss Them for Me (played the Chinese in December 1957).\n\nAlter, who became a tried-and-true New Yorker, died of pneumonia in Manhattan at the age of 78. Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle\n\nBorn: March 24, 1887, in Smith Center, Kansas\n\nDied: June 29, 1933, in New York, New York\n\nRoscoe Arbuckle was a pioneer of the screen. Becoming a major draw in the nickelodeon days, he was embroiled in the first huge cinema scandal. Acquitted after three trials, it ruined his life.\n\nBorn (at 13 pounds!) in a very small town in Kansas, Roscoe's birth broke his mother Mary's health. With the family moving to Santa Ana in 1889, by the time Roscoe was eight, he managed to perform with the Frank Bacon company as it blew through town.\n\nRoscoe was 11 when his mother died. After his father refused to \"support\" him, Roscoe got odd jobs in a local hotel. After singing badly at an amateur talent show, he accidentally somersaulted into the orchestra pit; the crowd loved it and physical comedy became Arbuckle's bread-and-butter.\n\nNow an act in vaudeville, Sid Grauman had Arbuckle appear at his Unique Theatre in San Francisco sometime in 1904; they became great friends. After joining the Pantages vaudeville circuit, Arbuckle teamed up with Leon Errol, then toured all over America.\n\nAfter marriage to Minta Durfee in 1908, Arbuckle joined up with the Morosco Burbank stock company and toured China and Japan, returning in 1909. Arbuckle joined the Chicago-based Selig Polyscope Company to make short comedy films. Working out of their new Edendale studio in Los Angeles, Arbuckle's first film for them was a western drama entitled Ben's Kid. Despite his vaudeville props, Selig kept Arbuckle in minor roles.\n\nProducer Mack Sennett placed Arbuckle as a lead player in a series of his Keystone Cops comedies, beginning with the three-reel, Henry Lehrman-directed The Gangsters, released in May 1913. Right away Sennett teamed Arbuckle up with his biggest star, Mabel Normand; their first film together was The Waiter's Picnic, released in June 1913. By September, Arbuckle's movie nickname became part of the title: Fatty's Day Off.\n\nHaving proved successful, Arbuckle was hired away by the Paramount combine. Directing as well as creating the scenarios, Arbuckle's first Paramount film was The Butcher Boy with Buster Keaton, released in April 1917. He continued to make very popular two and three-reelers until The Garage, released in January 1920.\n\nAfter completing the five-reel comedy Crazy to Marry in August 1921, Arbuckle and some pals drove up to book some rooms at San Francisco's St. Francis Hotel (now known as the Westin St. Francis). After inviting some people over, a party began.\n\nInvited to the party was director Henry Lerhman's wife, a young actress named Virginia Rappe. She was found in a bedroom having a bad reaction to the alcohol served at the party due to her having chronic cystitus, a urinary tract infection. Examined by Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor on the night of the party, Rappe was given morphine for her pain, but was not hospitalized until two days later.\n\nIt was at the hospital that Rappe's friend, Bambina Maude Delmont, placed the blame for Rappe's condition on Roscoe Arbuckle's having raped her. Doctors examined Rappe at the time, but did not find evidence of rape. Rappe died the next day from peritonitis caused by a rupured bladder.\n\nDelmont told the police Arbuckle had raped Rappe, who then began an investigation. Rappe's manager, Al Semnacker, began describing Arbuckle's actions — but varied many details. Delmont was found to be extorting Arbuckle's defense team. William Randolph Hearst's style of yellow journalism sensationalized the events and gave so much exposure to the subsequent trial, that it became impossible for Arbuckle to receive a fair hearing at the bar of justice.\n\nArbuckle's first trial ended with a hung jury; it was declared a mistrial as did his second. His third trial began in March 1922. By this time, Arbuckle was public enemy number one; his films could not get playdates; he was not working on any new projects. The jury acquitted Arbuckle, deliberating for only six minutes. In November 1923, wife Minta Durfee divorced Arbuckle. He would remarry to Doris Deane in 1925.\n\nThe rest of the Arbuckle story is not very pretty. Unable to find work, Arbuckle turn to alcohol for solace. There is eveidence to suggest that Buster Keaton used him on some of his films during this timeframe.\n\nUsing the alias of William Goodrich, Arbuckle found work as a director (he had directed many of his short films), beginning with 1924's His First Car. \"Goodrich\" directed a number of two-reelers until he directed the Marion Davies feature The Red Mill in 1927 (was Hearst feeling remorseful?). He also directed the Eddie Cantor feature Special Delivery for Paramount that year.\n\nSidelined for the next two years, Arbuckle's second wife Doris filed for divorce on September 9, 1929. Perhaps in sympathy, Grauman invited his old pal to appear at the Chinese Theatre for the last \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" during the run of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, September 21, 1929. Also on that night's bill was the comedy song duo Van & Schenck with the \"M-G-M Baseball Team in person\" and Bessie Love, Anita Page, Jack Benny, Lew Cody, Laurel & Hardy, Charles King, Georges Carpentier, Mike Donlin , The Rounders and Pete Morrison, master of ceremonies — quite the stageful!\n\nAs William Goodrich, Arbuckle contued to directed short comedies for Educational Pictures up through 1932. After that, he appeared in four short films for Warner Bros. in 1932-33. Arbuckle married for the thrid time to Addie McPhail during this time.\n\nAfter signing a contract to appear in a feature film for Warners, Arbuckle suffered a fatal heart attack in his sleep. He was 46. Armida\n\nBorn: Armida Vendrell, May 29, 1911, in Aguascalientes, Mexico\n\nDied: October 23, 1989, in Victorville, California\n\nArmida was a popular star of vaudeville, who worked her way into the movies. Her Spanish father was a magician who went by the name of \"The Great Arnold.\" The Great Arnold took over a vaudeville house called the Princess Theatre across the border in Douglas, Arizona, and started showing films and doing his magic tricks, which is where Armida and her two sisters Lydia and Lola, leaned to sing, dance and hold an audience.\n\nWith another sister Delores, Armida performed at the Teatro Hidalgo on Main Street in downtown Los Angeles. She was offered a slot on the vaudeville circuit. Her performances led to her being taken on by Gus Edwards, who specialized in kiddie shows. Armida fit in, since she was only 4 foot 11 inches. After a grueling schedule in New York, Edwards moved to Hollywood to work at M-G-M; he featured Armida in an early sound color revue Gus Edwards' International Colortone Revue, released in April 1929. In May 1929, Armida headlined in a feature for the Tiffany Studio: Border Romance, with Don Terry.\n\nArmida appeared at the Chinese Theatre at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, September 14, 1929, where she shared the stage with her mentor Gus Edwards, Anita Page, Gwen Lee, Charles Kaley, Edward Lankow, Jack Stanley and Cecil Cunningham. By this time, Armida had signed a contract with Warner Bros.\n\nShe sang a duet with her sister Lola for a moment in the revue film Show of Shows released in December 1929; in Janaury 1930 General Crack was released. The John Barrymore film had Armida fourth billed as a gypsy whose unfaithfulness sets the plot in motion. She got to sing a song or two in Rin Tin Tin's first talkie On The Border in March 1930; she was among a bevy of Chinese Theatre Who's Who people like Raquel Torres and Myrna Loy, competeing for romance with Frank Fay in Under a Texas Moon, released in April 1930.\n\nTaking a break from Hollywood, Armida was featured on Broadway in the Sig Romberg show Nina Rosa in September 1930. She made a couple shorts in 1933, then came back to the Fox lot to sing in Under the Papas Moon with Warner Baxter (which played the Chinese in June 1935).\n\nArmida was on Broadway once more in the Gus Edwards production Broadway Sho-Window in April 1936, but the show flopped. By 1937, she was the female lead in the Gene Autry / Smiley Burnette cowboy musical Rootin' Tootin' Rhythm. At R-K-O, she got third billing in a B-western musical starring Harry Carey, Border Café, also released in 1937.\n\nThe war years saw her doing various numbers in odball musicals, like Universal's La Conga Nights, starring Hugh Herbert (1940) and Warners' Always in My Heart with Kay Francis (1942). She headlined in producer Jack Schwarz' Machine Gun Mama in 1944.\n\nArmida continued to work in films after World War II, such as playing a jungle tribe leader in Jungle Goddess with George Reeves; she has a small bit part in the Columbia serial Congo Bill starring Don McGuire in 1948. Her last film had her doing a dance number in Ryhthm Inn in 1951. She was 40.\n\nNothing is known of her life beyond her Hollywood years. She died of a heart attack in Victorville at the age of 78.\n\nGeorge K. Arthur\n\nBorn: Arthur George Brest, January 27, 1899 in Littlehampton, Sussex, England\n\nDied: May 30, 1985, in New York, New York\n\nGeorge K. Arthur was an English actor, who had been appearing in films since 1919, primarily in comedies.\n\nBorn into hardscrabble circumstances, George ran off to join the Bugle Corps at the outset of World War I, where he learned to entertain his fellow troops. After the war, he studied with Sir Frank Benson. Before long, he changed his name, and began appearing in small roles in the West End.\n\nWhen Arthur discovered that an American director was in London to make a film of H.G. Wells' Kipps (1921), he campaigned for the lead role of a store clerk who inherits a bundle and got it, making the film a success. Mae Marsh made a couple of films in England with Arthur, who began to envision himself as an American movie star.\n\nThe problem was that none of the Hollywood studios wanted the odd-looking fellow. Friend Charles Chaplin got him some work, which led to a meaty role in James Cruz's film Hollywood (1923). Arthur was signed to a five-year contract with Pat Powers, who was then beginning his \"Powers Studio\"; Arthur moved his entire family to Hollywood from England, then the Powers Studio folded. Arthur worked odd jobs to make ends meet, but the desire to show 'em was strong in this one.\n\nWith funds begged, borrowed or stolen, Arthur made a film from a script he had written, and got the fledgling Josef von Sternberg to direct it with himself as the star. The result, The Salvation Hunters (1925) was shown to Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, who arranged to have it released through United Artists. Von Sternberg was on his way, and Arthur was signed to a contract at M-G-M.\n\nArthur had supporting roles in a number of M-G-M silents, like Lights of Old Broadway (1925) with Marion Davies and Conrad Nagel, The Exquisite Sinner (1926) with Conrad Nagel and Renée Adorée, and Lovers? (1927) with Ramon Novarro.\n\nTeamed with Karl Dane, \"Dane and Arthur\" made a number of feature-length silent comedies: Rookies (1927), Circus Rookies (1928), Detectives (1928), Brotherly Love (1928), All at Sea (1929), and China Bound (1929). Sound put an end to this: Dane had a very thick Danish accent.\n\nArthur was billed as the \"Master of Cermonies\" at the \"Midnite Matinee\" on Saturday, March 30, 1929, along with Sid Grauman's Prologue \"Broadway Nights\" for the film The Broadway Melody. He also was in the cast of the all-star revival of Gus Edwards' School Days along with Fanny Brice, Benny Rubin, Charles King, Bert Wheeler, Tom Patricola, Polly Moran, Lola Lane, Louise Groody, Louise Dresser and Marie Dressler), at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" performance of The Hollywood Revue of 1929 at the Chinese on Saturday, July 6, 1929.\n\nNo longer able to make films, Dane and Arthur toured the vaudeville circuit for a while, and made shorts at Paramount and R-K-O. After the act broke up, Arthur was on his uppers; he opened a \"Grand Guignol\" theatre in Hollywood, which flopped, but 1935 was a busy year; Arthur produced a trio of short horror-themed plays on Broadway, called Grand Guignol Horror Plays, and co-wrote the book for the musical Provincetown Follies.\n\nNow a U.S. Citizen, Arthur joined the Army Air Corps during World War II. He entertained troops of course, but spent much of his time providing logistical support for the shows.\n\nArthur became a producer later on, winning (with Jack Clayton who produced and directed) the Oscar for live action 2-reel short in 1956 for film The Bespoke Overcoat. He continued to produces short films for television until he retired in 1959. He died in New York City at the age of 86. Charles Bickford\n\nBorn: January 1, 1891, in Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nDied: November 9, 1967, in Los Angeles, California\n\nCharles Bickford is one of the most unforgettable supporting players in Hollywood's history. Craggy and gruff, he played significant roles in a number of major films.\n\nBorn into a large family in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Charles was an unruly child, influenced by his ship captain maternal grandfather. At age nine, a trolley struck and killed his pet dog, so Charles attempted to shoot the driver; he was acquitted.\n\nLeaving home at age 15, Bickford drifted about the country, doing all sorts of manly things, including enlisting in the U. S. Navy during World War I. While there, a buddy goaded Bickford into auditioning for a burlesque company. He did, and started his showbiz career. He made his Broadway debut in the chorus of the musical The Baroness Fiddlesticks in late 1904. His most successful role was as a reporter in Chicago, with Francine Larrimore as Roxie Hart, in the 1926-1927 season. Bickford even co-wrote a play, a comedy call The Cyclone Lover, which played for 31 perfs in mid 1928.\n\nDirector Cecil B. De Mille is credited with plucking Bickford from the obscurity of Broadway, getting the actor to sign a contract at M-G-M. While appearing in De Mille's first talkie, Dynamite released in December, 1929, Bickford appeared onstage at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" late show of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, July 27, 1929. The show also included Jack Benny, and Raymond Hackett, with Benny's pal, Benny Rubin as master of ceremonies.\n\nWorking on Dynamite, however, was a raucous affair, with Bickford punching De Mille during an argument over how he should play his character. Despite playing Greta Garbo's lover in Anna Christie in 1930, Bickford constantly fought with M-G-M execs, so he quit his contract, and became a freelancer.\n\nWhile filming East of Java for Fox in 1935, Bickford was mauled by a lion, ending his chances of becoming a leading man. Character parts would be his specialty in countless westerns, but also in bigger films: in De Mille's The Plainsman in 1936, Of Mice and Men in 1939, De Mille's Reap the Wild Wind in 1942, The Song of Bernadette in 1943, Duel in the Sun in 1946, The Farmer's Daughter in 1947, Johnny Belina in 1948, A Star is Born in 1954, The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell in 1955, The Big Country in 1958, and The Unforgiven in 1960.\n\nBickford did a fair amount of television: Schlitz Playhouse over CBS, in 1953, 1954, and 1956, Climax! over CBS in 1957, and Wagon Train over NBC in 1958. By guest starring repeatedly on Playouse 90 on CBS, Bickford first etched a role he would become well-known for: playing the nurseyman father of the female lead (Piper Laurie) in Days of Wine and Roses, airing on October 2, 1958. Bickford would reprise the role when it came time for director Blake Edwards' film of the story, Days of Wine and Roses, where he played Lee Remick's father. The perfect role for Bickford.\n\nBickford published his autobiography, Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors in 1965. He died of pneumonia in 1967 at the age of 76.\n\nStewart Brady\n\nBorn: June, 1915, in Reno, Nevada\n\nDied: ?, in San Francisco, California\n\nBoy sorprano Stewart Brady was born to George and Margaret Brady, who were vaudevillians. Making appearances at the age of six, by his eighth year, he was studying with Catherine B. Swint in San Francisco. He could sing in five languages and could also play the piano.\n\nBrady made an apperance on Oakland radio station KGO in August of 1925. He was given the role of \"Youth\" in a performance of Meddelssohn's Elijah given in San Fransico with the San Francisco Symphony in 1926. He was championed by songwriter / performer Gus Edwards, who introduced the boy to Sid Grauman.\n\nStewart's account of his audition for Grauman during the rehearsals for the \"Glories of the Scriptures\" prologue mentions that Grauman asked the boy if he knew any religious songs. So before the entire cast and crew, he sang his favorite: \"Were You There (When They Crucified My Lord).\" Grauman thought it was too dour a number. He asked, \"Don't you have anything that's bright and cheery?\"\n\nSo Stewart and his mother went out and got the sheet music for \"The Holy City\" and he sang it for Grauman the next day — and was hired.\n\nHis appearance in Sid Grauman's Prologue \"Glories of Scriptures\" for the film King of Kings in 1927, was Brady's first engagement in Hollywood. A scout for Warner Bros. saw the lad at the Chinese and offered him a contract. He has been credited with participating in the Sid Grauman Prolgue for Noah's Ark, in November, 1928.\n\nBrady made a Vitaphone short, production number 2745, called Stewart Brady, The Song Bird, which was released in August of 1928, where he sang three numbers. According to Ron Hutchinson of The Vitaphone Project, the picture has survived, but the sound is currently missing.\n\nIn his later years, Brady settled in San Francisco and taught voice and piano. He became the vocal coach for the American Conservatory Theatre there as well. Interviewed late in life, Brady spoke of his appearances in the Grauman prologues as being the pivitol time in his life.\n\nFanny Brice as her Baby Snooks character. Unknown date.\n\nFanny Brice\n\nBorn: Fania Borach, October 29, 1891, in New York City, New York\n\nDied: May 29, 1951 in Hollywood, California\n\nFanny Brice was a very well-known Broadway star, famous for her singing and self-affacing comedy. She became popular nationwide with her Baby Snooks radio program.\n\nBorn into an immigrant family who owned a saloon in New York City, Brice quit school at age 17 to work in a burlesque show called The Girls from Happy Land Starring Sliding Billy Watson. After touring in a show called College Girl, she appeared in the Ziegfeld Follies in 1910 and 1911, and returned to the show in 1916 and 1917, and was in the Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic in 1919, and Ziegfeld Girls of 1920, March to May, 1920. She returned to star in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1920, but in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1921, she introduced two songs which will forever be associated with her: \"My Man\" and \"Second Hand Rose.\" Her recordings of these songs and others were big sellers. She starred in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1923 also.\n\nBrice would continue with the Ziegfeld brand for some time, after starring in Irving Berlin's Music Box Revue for producer Sam Harris in 1924.\n\nIn 1928, Brice made her first movie, a part-talkie for Warners' called My Man, but this film is now considered \"lost.\" In February, 1929, Brice was in the cast of Earl Carroll's first \"book\" musical, Fioretta. Carroll cast his girlfriend, Dorothy Knapp in the title role, although the critics all said she couldn't sing. It flopped.\n\nBrice was in Hollywood shooting Be Yourself! (released in February, 1930), when she appeared at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" late show of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, July 6, 1929. She was in a star-studded micro version of Gus Edward's School Days. The cast included Gus Edwards himself along with Benny Rubin, George K. Arthur, Charles King, Bert Wheeler, Tom Patricola, Polly Moran, Lola Lane, Louise Groody, Louise Dresser and Marie Dressler.\n\nBrice then returned to Broadway, starring in Sweet and Low in 1930, Billy Rose's Crazy Quilt in 1931, and the Zielgfeld Follies of 1934 and 1936, which ran for the entire year of 1936 at the Winter Garden Theatre.\n\nBut radio became Brice's medium, beginning with the Chase & Sanborn Hour on NBC, beginning in 1933. She then transformed the \"Baby Snooks\" sketch she had done in the Follies show, and rolled it into her radio show, first on The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air on CBS in 1936, then on the Good News show on NBC in late 1937, then on the Maxwell House Coffee Time on CBS in 1937, where her co-star was Frank Morgan. The Baby Shooks Show was launched on CBS in 1944, then moved to NBC in 1948. The show ran until 1951. Brice played Snooks on televiion only once in 1950, but she didn't like the way it came off.\n\nFanny Brice is one of a small group of performers who appeared as themselves in the M-G-M biopics of Florenz Ziegfeld, The Great Ziegfeld (which played the Chinese in November, 1936), and Ziegfeld Follies in 1946.\n\nIn 1939, the Fox musical Rose of Washington Square was based on her life — but without her permission. Brice sued for invasion of privacy and won, forcing the studio to make cuts of the songs she was famous for.\n\nBrice died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1951 at the age of 59. In 1964, a Broadway musical based on some of her life called Funny Girl opened with the unknown Barbra Streisand, which in turn became a popular film in 1968. A sequel was made called Funny Lady (which played the Chinese in March, 1975).\n\nLorraine, Bobbie and Patricia Brox in 1923.\n\nThe Brox Sisters\n\nLorayne (Eunice Brock) Brox\n\nBorn: November 11, 1900, in Riverton, Iowa\n\nDied: June 14, 1993, in Los Angeles, Cailfornia\n\nPatricia (Kathleen Brock) Brox\n\nBorn: June 14, 1904, in Union City, Indiana\n\nDied: August 27, 1988, in New York, New York\n\nBobbie (Josephine Brock) Brox\n\nBorn: November 28, 1902, in Memphis, Tennessee\n\nDied: May 2, 1999, in Glens Falls, New York\n\nThe Brox Sisters were an amazing singing / hamonizing singing trio. Cute and charming stage performers, once heard, never forgotten.\n\nBorn to a showbiz family, they were performing together in vaudeville by 1910 or so. Somehow, they formed a stong relationship with Irving Berlin, who wrote the song \"Everybody Step\" for them to sing in the first of his annual Music Box Revues in 1921. The Brox Sisters appeared in the Music Box Reviews of 1923, and 1924. They made many recordings of both Berlin songs and those of other Tin Pan Alley composers.\n\nContinuing to hitch their wagon to Berlin, the Sisters were on Broadway with the Marx Brothers in the second brief run of The Cocoanuts (music by Berlin) in May, 1927, then appeared in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927 (music by Berlin) from August, 1927, to January, 1928. Then, they embarked on a national tour of the The Cocoanuts with the Marx Brothers, Playing the Biltmore Theatre in Los Angeles in 1928.\n\nSid Grauman signed the Sisters up to appear in his Prologue \"The Tropics\" for the film White Shadows in the South Seas at the Chinese Theatre from August to October, 1928. Grauman also had them appear at the \"Midnight Matinee\" performance of both the prologue \"Broadway Nights\" and the film The Broadway Melody on Saturday, April 13, 1929.\n\nTheir incredible singing style, perky personalities, and Los Angeles location enabled the Brox Sisters to glide into the movies easily, making some Vitaphone Shorts before appearing in The Hollywood Revue of 1929, which played the Chinese in June, 1929. The Brox act played at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee performance of The Hollywood Revue of 1929, on Satuday, August 17, 1929, where they were featured in a stage show along with Joey Ray, Frank Richardson, The Rasch Ballet, Karl Dane, Bobby Dolan and Walter O'Keefe.\n\nThe Brox Sisters also appeared in King of Jazz with Paul Whiteman in 1930. The act broke up by the mid 30s.\n\nLorayne married jazz trumpeter Henry Busse in 1935. They lived together until his death in 1955. Lorayne then married Joseph D. Hall, who died in 1983. Lorayne died in 1993, at the age of 93.\n\nPatricia married a man named Gerstenzang. She died in 1988, at the age of 84.\n\nBobbie married her agent, William Perlberg in 1928, who later became a producer. They divorced in the 1960s. She married songwriter Jimmy Van Heusen in 1969, who passed away in 1990. Bobbie died in 1999 at the age of 96. Georges Carpentier\n\nBorn: January 12, 1894, in Liévin, France\n\nDied: October 28, 1975, in Paris, France\n\nGeorges Carpentier was a very well-known professional boxer from 1908 to 1926. He was in town to try and make it in American movies.\n\nBoxing since he was 14, Carpentier worked his way up through the weight classes, becoming the European champion in each one; welterweight in 1911, middleweight in 1912 and light heavyweight in 1913. In June that year, he beat Billy \"Bombardier\" Wells to become the heavyweight champion of Europe. The next year, he fought and won over Pat O'Keeffe and Ed \"Gunboat\" Smith to become the \"White Heavyweight Champion of the World.\"\n\nCharpentier was also a boxing referee, performing this role during the world title bout between Jack Johnson and Frank Moran in June 1914. Becoming a fighter pilot in the French Air Force during World War I, he was awarded the top military honors: the Croix de Guerre and the Médaille Millitaire.\n\nAfter defending his heavyweight title twice in 1919, Carpentier dopped down to the light heavyweight class and knocked out Battling Levinsky in the fourth round in Jersey City, New Jersey. In 1914 he squared off against heavyweight Jack Dempsey in boxing's first $1 million dollar purse in Jersey City. Carptentier was knocked out in the fourth. After that, he fought and lost against a Senegalese fighter named Battling Siki in 1922. He was now loosing his titles in many of the classes in which he had fought.\n\nWith his boxing career over, Carpentier did the only sensible thing — he bacame a song and dance man! Touring on the vaudeville curcuit in the US and England led Carpentier to dabble with films. In 1920 French director Felix Léonnec headlined the boxer in a eight part serial Le Trésor de Kériolet - The Treasury of Kériolet. 1920 also saw the release of The Wonder Man, made for the newly-formed British-based Robertson-Cole Company.\n\nNow a well-known vaudvillian, Carpentier appeared onstage at the Chinese at the final \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" during the run of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, September 21, 1929. He shared the stage with the comedy song duo Van & Schenck along with the \"M-G-M Baseball Team in person\" and Roscoe Arbuckle, Bessie Love, Anita Page, Laurel & Hardy, Charles King, Mike Donlin , The Rounders and Pete Morrison, master of ceremonies — quite the stageful! Carpentier sang the song \"If I Could Learn to Love\" in the Warner Bros. musical revue film Show of Shows, released in December 1929.\n\nWarner's gave Carpentier a supporting role in their musical comedy Hold Everything, released in March 1930. Carpentier returned to Europe, making one more film in 1930 before taking a few years off before making the French film Toboggan - AKA: Battling Geo, released in March 1934.\n\nGiving up on movie stardom, Carpentier opened a swanky bar in Paris called Chez Georges Carpentier. Despite having to change locations, he would keep this bar going until his death from a heart attack in 1975 at the age of 81. A sports arena in Paris is named after him, the Halle Georges Carpentier. Walter Catlett\n\nBorn: February 4, 1889, in San Francisco, California\n\nDied: November 14, 1960, in Woodland Hills, California\n\nWalter Catlett was a leading supporting player during the early sound period and beyond. His thin frame and sometimes twangy voice made him a perfect small-town sherrif, doctor, newspaperman, or shyster lawyer.\n\nBorn in San Francisco, Catlett ventured into showbiz via vaudeville. Making his Broadway debut in So Long Letty with Charlotte Greenwood in the 1916-17 season, he got a part in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1917, and introduced the Gershwin standard \"Oh, Lady Be Good!\" in Lady Be Good! with Adele and Fred Astaire in the 1924-25 season. His final Broadway credit is the Gershwin's Treasure Girl with Gertrude Lawrence and Clifton Webb in the 1928-29 season.\n\nHaving been making films out in Fort Lee, New Jersey, since 1924's feature Second Youth with Lunt and Fontanne, Catlett made the trek to Hollywood, to make films out where the action was.\n\nHe was shooting Married in Hollywood at Fox when he appeared at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" late show of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, July 13, 1929. Fittingly, he was the master of ceremonies during a performance \"dedicated to the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks,\" who were having their annual Convention in Los Angeles that year.\n\nCatlett had supporting parts in many films, standouts of which are: as Murphy in The Front Page (released in April, 1931), Bingy in Platinum Blonde (released in October, 1931), Bates in Rain (which world premiered at the Chinese in September, 1932), Barsad in A Tale of Two Cities (which played the Chinese in January, 1936), Morrow in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (released in April, 1936), Slocum in Bringing Up Baby (released in February, 1938), did the voice of J. Worthington Foulfellow in Pinocchio (released in February, 1940), as a theatre manager in Yankee Doodle Dandy (released in June, 1942), Joe Brooks in Dancing in the Dark (played the Chinese in February, 1950), Colonel Castine in The Inspector General (released in December, 1949), and Professor Quigley in Friendly Persuasion (released in November, 1956).\n\nCatlett died of a stroke at the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, California, in 1960 at the age of 71. Charlie Chase\n\nBorn: Charles Joseph Parrott, October 20, 1893, in Baltimore, Maryland\n\nDied: June 20, 1940, in Hollywood, California\n\nCharlie Chase was a very active performer on both sides of the camera, closely associated with Hal Roach.\n\nPerforming in vaudeville since he was a teen, Charlie made the trip to break into pictures out in Hollywood fairly early — he started at the Christie Film Company in 1912, then skipped along to Keystone, being directed by Mack Sennett and appearing with Charles Chaplin.\n\nChase was so good, that he was allowed to direct films with Chaplin impersonator Billy West; some of these films also featured Oliver Hardy.\n\nBy 1920, Charlie was working with Hal Roach, where he became instrumental in producing the first of the Our Gang comedies. He rose to head the entire Roach outfit (with the exception of Harold Lloyd). By 1923, he had had enough paper-pushing; Roach allowed him to do his own short comedies as Charlie Chase.\n\nExpanding from one-reelers, Chase did two-reelers, and the occasional trhee-reeler, working a good deal with director Leo McCarey. Some of his highpoint films are Mighty Like a Moose in 1926, Crazy Like a Fox in 1926, and Fluttering Hearts in 1927.\n\nChase was asked to play master of ceremonies with Hal Roach, and Gus Edwards at the \"Midnite Matinee\" on Saturday, June 8, 1929, along with Sid Grauman's Prologue \"Broadway Nights\" for the film The Broadway Melody. Young star Raquel Torres was the \"star guest of honor\" that evening.\n\nChase easily made the transition to sound, singing his own songs in short films, which became one of the key series (along with Laurel and Hardy and the Our Gang films) for the Hal Roach studio. Some of the better Chase shorts during this time include The Pip from Pittsburg in 1931, and On the Wrong Trek in 1936, which had bit parts for Laurel and Hardy. Chase had a part in the Laurel and Hardy feature Sons of the Desert in 1933.\n\nWith Roach concentrating on feature-length films, Chase attempted to do one which was to be called Bank Night, about Bank Night giveaways at a movie theatre, but due to problems selling it to movie theatres, it was edited down to a two-reeler and released as Neighborhood House in 1936. After that, he was let go from the Roach studio.\n\nChase went on to make 20 or more short films for Columbia with director Del Lord, and most of them co-starring Ann Doran: From Bad to Worse, The Wrong Miss Wright, The Big Squirt, all three in 1937, Many Sappy Returns in 1938, The Heckler, and South of the Boudoir, both in 1940.\n\nChase also directed shorts on the Columbia lot, including the famous Three Stooges short Violent is the Word for Curley in 1938.\n\nChase had worked a good deal with his younger brother James, who died of drug addiction in 1939. Chase, who had alcohol and depression problems of his own, felt responsible, becoming even more depressive than normal. Throwing himself into his work caught up to him; he suffered a fatal heart attack in June, 1940.\n\nHis final film, His Bridal Fright, was released in July, 1940. Lew Cody\n\nBorn: Louis Joseph Côté, February 22, 1884, in Waterville, Maine\n\nDied: May 31, 1934, in Beverly Hills, California\n\nLew Cody was an actor who made a career of playing men with \"bad intentions.\" Occasionally a romantic lead, Cody was vey busy in the silent era, and made the transition to sound.\n\nFrench Canadian on his father's side, the family moved to Berlin, New Hampshire, where they ran a drug store. Young Louis was a soda jerk. After deciding not to seek a degree in medicine at McGill University in Montreal, he appeared in a student play there and got the acting bug. Initially hooking up with a stock theatre company in North Carolina, Cody studied acting in New York in a school run by Stanhope Wheatcroft. By 1907, Cody made his Broadway debut in the musical The Hired Girl's Millions. While flirting with the movies, Cody also appeared on Broadway in the musical revue The Whirl of the World in the 1914 season.\n\nCody married actress Dorothy Dalton in 1910; they divorced after a year, then remarried in 1913. Divorcing once more in 1914, Cody moved to Los Angeles to make it in the movies. His first role was as the \"be mine or I'll evict you from your home\" heavy in the two-reeler Harp of Tara, released in January. After falling in with director / producer Thomas Ince, Cody got to play a college football star with the unlikely name of \"Bullet Dick\" Ames in The Mating, released in July 1915.\n\nBy playing the second-banana heavy or hero in over 30 films brought Cody to the attention of director Cecil B. DeMille, who cast him in a triangle with Elliot Dexter and Gloria Swanson in her first big hit Don't Change Your Husband in 1919. Despite this, stardom eluded him. Cody was working for Louis B. Mayer as the third or fourth-banana in 1924's Husbands and Lovers, but once M-G-M was formed in 1925, Cody was headlining in the rom-com Monte Carlo in 1926. Cody continued as a top star at Metro through the release of the silent comedy A Single Man in 1929. In September 1926, Cody impetuously proposed to and married Mabel Normand. They remained together until her death from tuberculosis in February 1930.\n\nCody appeared onstage at the Chinese at the final \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" during the run of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, September 21, 1929. He shared the stage with the comedy song duo Van & Schenck along with the \"M-G-M Baseball Team in person\" and Roscoe Arbuckle, Bessie Love, Anita Page, Laurel & Hardy, Charles King, Georges Carpentier , Mike Donlin , The Rounders and Pete Morrison, master of ceremonies — quite the stageful!\n\nCody's first sound film had him playing an alloholic laywer in the shipboard romance What a Widow!, with Gloria Swanson, released in September 1930. Cody was in the cast for director Josef von Sternberg's Dishonored with Marlene Dietrich in April 1931. Cody starred or co-starred in ten features in 1931, including A Woman of Experience with Helen Twelvetrees and the crime movie X Marks the Spot. He made nine more films in 1932, culminating with Under-Cover Man with George Raft.\n\nPlagued with heart troubles Cody slowed down in 1933, appearing in supporting roles in four films. In May 1934, Cody died in his sleep at his home in Beverly Hills at the age of 50. His last film was the Jack Oakie musical Shoot the Works, released posthumously in July 1934. Lester Cole\n\nBorn: June 19, 1904, in New York, New York\n\nDied: August 15, 1985, in San Francisco, California\n\nLester Cole is known for being one of the \"Hollywood Ten\" who were cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions about their political beliefs before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947.\n\nCole was the son of Polish immigrants in New York City. His father was a garment industry union organizer, and was raised in an atmosphere of socialism and politics from an early age.\n\nSomehow, Cole became interested in the theatre and the movies, becoming an assistant on Max Reinhardt's staging of The Miracle in 1924. Touring the country with it, the play stopped in Los Angeles to play the Shrine Auditorium. According to Cole, the producers had scheduled a last-minute rehearsal before an audience of Hollywood's elite to see if any big director would buy the film rights; to have his revenge, a furious Reinhardt turned the rehearsal over to a bewildered Cole, who got through it regardless.\n\nLater, a friend told Cole about the Chinese Theatre opening, so he went to see Grauman at his office at the Egyptian Theatre. Grauman had attended The Miracle rehearsal and liked the way Cole had handled the situation. Cole was hired to be Grauman's assistant director. Pay: $75 per week!\n\nCole worked on the prologues for King of Kings in 1927, and The Gaucho in 1928. When Cole told Grauman he was underpaying the Latino second-string performers in the \"Agrentine Nights\" prologue, relations between the two men became frosty, and after The Gaucho opened, Cole quit. He never saw Grauman again.\n\nBreaking into screenwriting in 1932 on If I Had a Million, Cole must have found working for the studios to be inequitable, because only one year later, he helped establish the first union of Hollywood writers, the Screen Writers Guild.\n\nIn 1934, Cole officially became a member of the American Communist Party, and susequently found himself being summond by HUAC. For his refusal to incriminate himself for his right of free association, he was fined $1,000 and spent 10 months in jail. When he got out, he found himself \"blacklisted,\" unable to find work at the studios.\n\nUndaunted, he wrote scripts anyway, having friends \"front\" for him. His most famous script was for the film Born Free, which was credited to his front, Gerald L. C. Copley. In 1981, he published Hollywood Red: The Autobiography of Lester Cole. He died of a heart attack in 1985. Lynn Cowan\n\nBorn: June 8, 1888, in Iowa Falls, Iowa\n\nDied: August 29, 1973, in Pensacola, Florida\n\nLynn Cowan was another all-round entertainer from the glory days of vaudeville and Tin Pan Alley. A composer as well as a performer, Cowan appeared in a number of films.\n\nCowan intended to become a civil engineer, graduating with his bachelor's degree from Iowa State College. The stage beckoned however, with Cowan teaming up with Bill Bailey to tour the vaudeville circuit. Somewhere along the line, he began to write music for songs, including \"Kisses\" and \"Just Give Me a Week in Paris in 1918 and \"Dream House\" in 1926.\n\nCowan found himself a small role in the John Ford directed The Fighting Heart, released in October, 1925, and dabbled in short films.\n\nCowan was riding high though, having contributed music and lyrics to the song \"Then I'll Know Why\" to the Chester Morris crime / musical (and Best Picture nominee) Alibi, released in April, 1929, and the songs \"I'm in Love with You,\" \"That New Step\" and \"Web of Love\" in what has to be the oddest early sound musical — starring Erich von Stroheim of all people — The Great Gabbo, to be released that September.\n\nit was during this time that Cowan was asked to play master of ceremonies onstage at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" late show of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, August 3, 1929. The stage show also included \"Guest of Honor\" Marion Harris, with Raquel Torres, Gwen Lee. and Josephine Dunn.\n\nIt appears that Cowan's stage personality got him a gig as M.C. at the St. Louis Fox Theatre, for which he composed the song \"Ain't Got the St. Louis Blues No More\" in 1930. His final film credit is in a bit part as a reporter in I'll Fix It with Jack Holt for Columbia in 1934.\n\nDuring World War II, Cowan became a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army Corps of Engineers, earning a Legion of Merit medal, which is pretty amazing, considering the guy was in his 60s. He spent some of his twilight years in Kauai, Hawaii, but died in Pensacola, Florida at the age of 85. Cecil Cunningham\n\nBorn: Edna Cecil Cunningham, August 2, 1888, in St. Louis, Missouri\n\nDied: April 17, 1959, in Woodland Hills, California\n\nCecil Cunningham was a multi-talented supporting player on Broadway and in the movies from the late 1920s to the 1960s.\n\nLearning to sing and perform at her local church, Cunningham started out with a job as a switchboard operator at a bank. After doing some modelling, she developed a comdy act which became successful in vaudeville.\n\nHer rise in showbiz combined a mixture of Broadway shows like The Greenwich Village Follies of 1919; singing on tour with the Boston Opera, and doing comedy at the Palace Theatre; anywhere her bubbly personality could boost a show.\n\nNewly arrived in Hollywood to work as a supporting \"Aunt\" in the Norma Shearer talkie Their Own Desire (which would be released in December), Cunningham appeared at the Chinese Theatre's \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, September 14, 1929. She shared the bill with Gus Edwards, Anita Page, Gwen Lee, Armida, Charles Kaley, Edward Lankow and Jack Stanley.\n\nCunningham went on to appear in almost 90 films, usually playing small roles. 1932 seems to have been a banner year for her; she played a \"Gambler Selling a Ring\" in Mata Hari (which played the Chinese in January), a \"Laundress\" in Love Me Tonight in August, a \"Woman Manager\" in Blonde Venus in September and \"Emily's Friend\" in If I Had a Million in November.\n\nShe had parts in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town in 1936, The Awful Truth in 1937, Kitty Foyle in 1940 and Du Barry was a Lady (which played the Chinese in July 1943).\n\nAfter World War II, Cunningham's career thinned considerably. She had some scenes in The Bride Goes Wild in 1948, but she was cut from the picture. She acted in only two television shows in the 1950s. Her final effort was a television movie of the Nativity story, Joyful Hour aired in syndication in December 1960.\n\nIn 1988, Cunningham died of heart disease at the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills. She was 70 years old. Karl Dane\n\nBorn: Rasmus Karl Therkelsen Gottlieb, October 12, 1886, in Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nDied: April 14, 1934, in Los Angeles, California\n\nKarl Dane was a key supporting player in the silent era, instantly recognizable for his great stature and goofy manner. He did not make it into the sound period.\n\nDane's father had built a toy theatre, which got Karl interested in performing. But acting doesn't pay the bills, so young Karl studied to become a machinist. He served in the Danish Army. By 1912, Dane had a wife and two children. In 1914, he was called up to serve in World War I.\n\nJoining many others seeking to escape war-torn Europe, Dane, with no money and no English, arrived at Ellis Island in 1916. He lived in Brooklyn and Lincoln, Nebraska, then moved back to New York, working as an auto mechanic for $3 per week.\n\nIn 1917, Dane found himself doing extra work at the Vitagraph studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, making $3 per day! Soon, he was playing German military types in films: My Four Years in Germany (1918), To Hell with the Kaiser! (1918), and The Great Victory, Wilson or the Kaiser? The Fall of the Hohenzollerns (1919).\n\nIn 1921, Dane married again, quit the movies, moved to Van Nuys and ran a chicken farm. Tragically, his wife Helen died in childbirth in 1923. Friends from the film biz rescued him from his doldrums, eventually landing him a role in King Vidor's whopping hit film The Big Parade in 1925, which starred John Gilbert and Renée Adorée. For the next several years, Dane was everywhere.\n\nHe had signifigant roles in La Boheme (1926), The Son of the Sheik (1926), The Scarlett Letter (1926), The Red Mill (1927). M-G-M teamed Dane up with George K. Arthur, and the pair made several successful comedies together: Rookies (1927), Circus Rookies (1928), Detectives (1928), Brotherly Love (1928), All at Sea (1929), and China Bound (1929).\n\nAfter Rookies, M-G-M put Dane under contract, but while filming The Trail of '98 (which played the Chinese in 1928), Dane broke his shoulder; his recovery was protracted and difficult.\n\nKarl Dane was asked to be an \"honored guest\" (along with Anita Page, Bessie Love, and Mary Doran) at the \"Midnite Matinee\" performances of both Sid Grauman's \"Broadway Nights\" Prologue and the film The Broadway Melody, on Saturday, May 11, 1929. He was also on the card at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" performance of The Hollywood Revue of 1929 on Saturday, August 17, 1929, with The Brox Sisters, Joey Ray, Frank Richardson, The Rasch Ballet, Bobby Dolan and Walter O'Keefe.\n\nBut there was another problem — Dane's thick Danish accent. Despite appearing in sound films like The Big House (1930), Billy the Kid (1930), and some short films, work for Dane slowed to a trickle. M-G-M broke his contract. Paramount sent him out on the vaudeville circuit with George Arthur, but it wasn't exactly a roaring success. Dane lost all of his money in a mining failure. He impulsively proposed to a telephone operator and married her, only to divorce her a few weeks later. Desparate, he bought into a hamburger stand in Westwood, but it too was a failure. While meeting a young lady for a movie date, Dane was pickpocketed and lost all of his money. When he was late for the date, the young woman went to Dane's apartment only to find that he had shot himself in the head.\n\nSince Dane had no realatives, actor Jean Hersholt stepped up and insisted M-G-M pay for Dane's funeral, which was immediately held. 50 people attended.\n\nMusic director Robert Emmett Dolan in 1947.\n\nBobby Dolan\n\nBorn: Robert Emmett \"Bobby\" Dolan, August 3, 1908, in Hartford, Connecticut\n\nDied: September 26, 1972, in Los Angeles, California\n\nRobert Emmett Dolan was a conductor, arranger and songwriter. He did a lot of work at Paramount in the 1930s and 40s.\n\nBorn the eldest of 12 children, Dolan learned piano at his mother's knee. He drifted into playing piano in showbiz, playing in dance bands, vaudeville and the like. Dolan was asked to play at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" performance of The Hollywood Revue of 1929 on Saturday, August 17, 1929, with The Brox Sisters, Joey Ray, Frank Richardson, The Rasch Ballet, Karl Dane and fellow Hartfordian Walter O'Keefe. with whom Dolan would write several songs, including songs for the Pathé comedy The Sophmore, released the following week. They would also collaborate on songs for the musical Red Hot Rhythm with Alan Hale, released in November, 1929. Both films were directed by Leo McCarey.\n\nAfter doing \"musical effects\" for Sweet Kitty Briars at Warners' in 1930, he and\n\nO'Keefe wrote a song included in Little Caesar (\"You, I Love But You) released in early 1931.\n\nDolan made his Broadway debut as the piano player in the show East Wind in 1931. He quickly became a reliable musical director on The Great White Way, working on Cole Porter's Leave it to Me! in the 1938 season. He also conducted all performances of the Kern/Hammerstein show Very Warm for May in the 1939 season.\n\nAfter working as musical director for Irving Berlin's Louisiana Purchase in 1940, Dolan accepted a job as musical direction man at Paramount, where his first assignment was Bing Crosby's Birth of the Blues in 1941. Big films Dolan worked on include Holiday Inn (1942), Going My Way (1944), Road to Utopia (1945), Road to Rio (1947), and The Great Gatsby (1949).\n\nIn 1945, Dolan wrote a nonsense song for the Fred MacMurray comedy Murder, He Says, called \"Honor Flysis,\" which has since become the theme for National Public Radio's All Things Considered program.\n\nWith Johnny Mercer on lyrics, Dolan did the music for Texas, Li'l Darlin' which ran for 293 perfs, from November, 1949 to September, 1950. He also wrote the music for Not for Children, which flopped in 1951.\n\nDolan returned to Hollywood to be the producer on White Christmas in 1954. He produced The Girl Rush with Roz Russell in 1955, and was the producer of the 28th Annual Academy Award broadcast in 1956. Dolan did the score for The Three Faces of Eve in 1957.\n\nDolan worked as musical director on a pair of Broadway shows in 1959, then, in 1964 and working with Johnny Mercer again, wrote the music for Foxy, starring Bert Lahr, which flopped. His last credit was being musical director for the show Coco, which opened in 1969. Also at this time, Dolan taught mucis at Columbia University in New York. He published a guide to his process as Music in Modern Media in 1967. Dolan suffered a heart attack while sleeping and died in 1972 at the age of 64. Mike Donlin\n\nBorn: May 30, 1878, in Peoria, Illinois\n\nDied: September 24, 1933, in Hollywood, California\n\nMike Donlin was a Major League Baseball player, who, as an outfielder and first baseman, played with the New York Giants as they won the World Series in 1905. After baseball, Donlin hung out in Hollywood.\n\nBorn in Peoria Illinois, Donlin's family moved to Erie Pennsylvania. When still a young boy, his father and mother were killed in a train accident. Forced to hustle for survival, Mike did a number of odd jobs until, at the age of 15, he got a job selling candy on a train bound for California. He never looked back.\n\nBeginning his baseball career in 1899 with the St. Louis Perfectos (later the Cardinals), Donlin got the nickname \"Turkey Mike\" because of the unique strut he used when approaching the plate.\n\nPlaying for thr Baltimore Orioles in 1901, then the Cincinnati Reds in 1902-1904, Donlin joined the New York Giants in 1904, and remained with the tearm until 1906, played for them again in 1908 and 1911. During the \"dead ball\" era with larger playing areas, home runs were more difficult. Over his career, Donlin had a batting average of .333, making him #28 of all time. He slugged 51 home runs, and had 543 runs batted in, changing his nickname from \"Turkey Mike\" to \"The Baseball Idol of Manhattan.\"\n\nAn overwhelmingly outgoing personality, flamboyant clothes and theatrical style atracted the attention of vaudeville comedian Mabel Hite, with the two marrying in 1906. The two of them toured in a baseball-themed play Stealing Home for several years. Mabel got Mike a part in the Broadway musical A Certain Party in 1911. Mabel (who penned some of the songs) was the star of the show. It flopped.\n\nDonlin played with the Boston Rustlers, then the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1912. In October of that year, Mabel died of intestinal cancer. Pittsburgh put Donlin on wavers and was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. Donlin refused to go. He was able to return to the New York Giants in 1914, but it wasn't the same. Despite getting married again to actress Rita Ross in October 1914, Donlin's alcohol use was getting the better of him; baseball was out, but acting was fun.\n\nDrinking pals with John Barrymore, Donlin used his entrée with the actor to get into pictures, first appearing in a supporting role in Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman, released in December 1917. After taking parts in a couple of films, Donlin headed for Broadway, where he had a part in the drama Smooth As Silk in 1921. The show closed after 50 perfs.\n\nDonlin was able to land roles in a number of films after returning from New York. He played third mate Flask to Barrymore's Ahab in The Sea Beast, releaed in January 1926; he played a Union General in Buster Keaton's masterpiece The General, released in December 1926.\n\nThese are decidedly small roles — walk-ons, really. But when it came to make a movie musical about baseball starring the comic songsters Van & Schenck called They Learned About Women, Donlin took a role. In order to plug the film and contribute to a baseball-themed show, Donlin appeared onstage at the Chinese at the final \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" during the run of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, September 21, 1929. He shared the stage with his They Learned stars Van & Schenck along with the \"M-G-M Baseball Team in person\" and Roscoe Arbuckle, Bessie Love, Anita Page, Laurel & Hardy, Charles King, The Rounders and Pete Morrison, master of ceremonies — quite the stageful!\n\nAfter this, Donlin returned to Broadway; he got a role in the drama This One Man in 1930 (with Paul Muni in the cast), but it flopped. Hollywood became his bread and butter, where he took quite a number of bit parts in films, notably Arrowsmith in 1931, Madison Square Garden, starring Jack Oakie, where he played a referee named Mike Donlin (!) and he played an inmate in 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (with Paul Muni) and She Done Him Wrong with Mae West all in 1932.\n\nIn 1933, Donlin died in his sleep from a fatal heart attack at the age of 55. His last film Swellhead with Wallace Ford was realeased posthumously in May 1935. Louise Dresser\n\nBorn: Louise Josephine Kerlin, October 17, 1878, in Evansville, Indiana\n\nDied: April 24, 1965, in Woodland Hills, California\n\nLouise Dresser was a well-known supporting player on Broadway and in films right from the start. With her large frame, warmth and personality, she played loving mothers, and wicked mothers-in-law with equal aplomb.\n\nLouise's father was a train conductor, who died when she was only 15 years-old. As a tribute to a songwriter she knew, she changed her last name to \"Dresser\" and went right out to make it in vaudeville as a singer.\n\nShe made her Broadway debut at the age of 28 in the musical revue About Town, running from August to December, 1906. She fared somewhat better in the musical The Girl Behind the Counter, playing the matron of a large department store, which ran for 282 perfs, from October, 1907 to June, 1908. She had a supporting role way down the card in the long-running hit look at the Jewish side of the garment industry, Potash and Perlmutter from August, 1913 to September, 1915 for 441 perfs. Her last Broadway apperance was in Rock-a-Bye Baby in 1918. (How could it miss? it had Alan Hale Sr. and Frank Morgan!!) It flopped.\n\nHer first film was The Glory of Clementina, in 1922. She co-starred with Edward Everett Horton in the silent version of Ruggles of Red Gap in 1923, and finally got to have the lead in the title role of The Goose Woman at Universal in 1925. Also that year, Dresser put the moves on Rudolph Valentino in The Eagle. Dresser was nominated as Best Actress Oscar for A Ship Comes In at the first Academy Awards in 1929 (she lost out to Janet Gaynor).\n\nSo Dresser was out in Hollywood making pictures when she appeared at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" late show of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, July 6, 1929. She was in a star-studded micro version of Gus Edward's School Days. The cast included Gus Edwards himself along with Fanny Brice, Benny Rubin, George K. Arthur, Charles King, Bert Wheeler, Tom Patricola, Polly Moran, Lola Lane, Louise Groody, and Marie Dressler.\n\nDresser was a very busy actor. She played Al Jolson's mom in Mammy in 1930, played Calamity Jane in Caught in 1931, played Janet Gaynor's mom in State Fair in 1933, and was in the cast in the role of Empress Elizabeth in Paramount's The Scarlett Empress in 1934. Her last film was Maids of Salem, playing Claudette Colbert's aunt, in 1937.\n\nA great and long-standing friend to Buster Keaton, Dressler appeared on the This is Your Life episode devoted to the comedian, broadcast over NBC on April 3, 1957.\n\nDresser retired from show business to have more time with her second husband, Jack Gardner, until his death in 1950. Alone now, she carried along for another 15 years before she died of an intestinal ailment in 1965, at the age of 86. The Duncan Sisters\n\nRosetta Duncan\n\nBorn: November 23, 1894, in Los Angeles, Cailfornia\n\nDied: December 4, 1959, in Berwyn, Illinois\n\nVivian Duncan\n\nBorn: June 17, 1897, in Los Angeles, Cailfornia\n\nDied: September 19, 1986, in Beverly Hills, California\n\nThe Duncan Sisters were sisters who became a success on the vaudeville circuit with an act they called \"Topsy and Eva.\"\n\nBorn to a violinist father turned salesman, the Duncan Sisters aimed for the stage at a very young age. Rattling about Los Angeles, the Duncans were featured in the 1911 edition of Gus Edwards' Kiddies Review. After their debut at the Los Angeles Pantages Theatre in 1914, they developed their act with Rosetta as the comic, with Vivian as a \"dumb blonde\" straightman, as it were. On the vaudeville circuit, they called themselves \"The Song and Patter Kids.\"\n\nThe duo made their Broadway debut as part of the huge cast of the musical revue Doing Our Bit starring Ed Wynn at the Winter Garden for 130 performances from October 1917 to February 1918. They had a solo song called \"I'm So Glad My Mamma Don't Know Where I'm At.\"\n\nBy May of 1919, the Duncans were in a Jerome Kern musical set in a girl's school \"Down South\" called She's a Good Fellow starring female impersonator Joseph Santley for 120 perfs. The show closed in August 1919. The Sisters had parts on Broadway in Tip Top, which ran for 246 perfs, from October 1920 to May 1921.\n\nAlthough the origins are contradictory, Duncans enjoyed their greatest success by lifting some characters from Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, starring in and writing the music and lyrics to the show they called Topsy and Eva, which opened in San Francisco in July 1923. Although Eva dies in the novel, the Duncan's resurrected her for \"further adventures,\" with Eva, a white girl played by Vivian, and Topsy a black girl played by Rosetta in blackface.\n\nThe Duncan's very much wanted to bring the show to Broadway, but had to tour with it first, in Los Angeles and Chicago. Finally bringing the show to Gotham, Topsy and Eva ran for 159 performances, from December 1924 to May 1925.\n\nThe film of Topsy and Eva was beset with troubles, budget overruns and a change of directors and studios (!). When it was finally premiered at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in July 1927, the Duncan Sisters appeared onstage at all performances in Sid's Prologue entitled \"Plantation Memories.\" One presumes that the Duncan Sisters gave it plently of slapstick, although accounts suggest that they both played it without blackface. The Topsy and Eva film, shorn of its music and dialog, flopped.\n\nSid Grauman asked the Duncan's to perform at at the Chinese at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" performance of The Hollywood Revue of 1929 on Saturday, August 24, 1929. By then, M-G-M had decided to place the Duncan Sisters in their own musical-revue style film, which they were in town to shoot; the Sam Wood directed It's a Great Life (even with Technicolor scenes and a script by Al Boasberg) flopped upon release in December 1929.\n\nA third staging of Topsy and Eva opened in Los Angeles in 1931. There was a revival in 1942 also. Some of their act was filmed for the short Surprise! released by Warner Bros. in July 1935. The Duncan Sisters became somewhat notorious for performing as children up into the 1950s, appearing on Liberace's television show in 1954.\n\nThere was a third Duncan Sister, named Evelyn, born in 1883; she was ten years older than Rosetta and Vivian, and so, she made her way into showbiz via a different (and obscure) path, and who is thought to have gotten her younger sisters the job in Doing Our Bit in 1917. She is credited with only one film, playing Virginia Thorne in the 1915 film of Ibsen's Peer Gynt, starring Cyril Maude in the title role.\n\nRosetta and Vivian apparently continued to write songs into the 1940s. Rosetta died in 1959 from injuries sustained in an automobile crash in Berwyn Illinois, outside of Chicago, at the age of 65. Vivian held on until Alzheimer's disease got the better of her in 1986 at the age of 89. Josephine Dunn\n\nBorn: Mary Josephine Dunn, May 1, 1906, in New York, New York\n\nDied: February 3, 1983, in Thousand Oaks, California\n\nJosephine Dunn was a supporting player in Hollywood from the late silent period and into the 1930s. Versitle in comedy as well as drama, Dunn had quite a ride.\n\nDunn found her way into the chorus of the Jerome Kern Broadway musical Dear Sir by late 1924. It only ran for two weeks. She would occasionally return to Broadway.\n\nSigned on with Paramount, Dunn made her film debut in Fascinating Youth, released in March, 1926, where she played the girl who Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers is supposed to marry. All the players in this film are billed as \"Paramount's Junior Stars.\"\n\nAfter a few bit parts, Dunn was given a supporting role again in Love's Greatest Mistake, released in February, 1927, with William Powell, but seems to have worked at all the studios, looking for a good fit.\n\nAt M-G-M, Dunn got second billing with William Haines in the comedy Excess Baggage, released in September, 1928, and did her first talkie at Warner Bros., where she got got third billing as the heart-breaker, below Al Jolson and Betty Bronson, in The Singing Fool, released in September, 1928. Returning to M-G-M, Dunn got to play the romantic interest role in the Karl Dane / George K. Arthur comedy All at Sea, released in February, 1929.\n\nDunn was also voted a WAMPAS \"Baby Star\" in 1929. From what we can tell, the \"Baby Stars\" who had contracts with M-G-M at the time were asked to participate in the \"Ambassador Fur Revue\" at the \"Midnight Matinee\" on Saturday, May 18, 1929, along with Sid Grauman's Prologue \"Broadway Nights\" for the film The Broadway Melody. The women who participated in this is speculative, but might have included Gwen Lee and Anita Page.\n\nDunn was probably at M-G-M shooting the William Haines comedy A Man's Man when she appeared onstage at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" late show of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, August 3, 1929. The stage show also included \"Guest of Honor\" Marion Harris, Raquel Torres, and Gwen Lee, with Lynn Cowan as master of ceremonies.\n\nDunn co-starred at Universal with Eddie Leonard in the musical Melody Lane, released in October, 1929, and was in the cast, along with Anita Page, in the Joan Crawford picture Our Modern Maidens, released in September, 1929. She rattled about the studios again in less than stallar films until she was cast in a supporting role in the Maurice Chevalier / Jeanette MacDonald musical, One Hour with You, released in March, 1932.\n\nDunn kept at the picture game, but she didn't even get on the poster for her last film, Birth of a Baby, released in 1938. Married, since 1935 to Carroll Case (who would become a film and television producer), Dunn died of cancer at the age of 76. Cliff \"Ukulele Ike\" Edwards\n\nBorn: June 14, 1895, in Hannibal, Missouri\n\nDied: July 17, 1971, in Hollywood, California\n\nCliff \"Ukulele Ike\" Edwards is the most famous ukulele player, who introduced the instrument to American audiences at the dawn of the sound age. A performer and songwriter, he made many influential recordings and films.\n\nLeaving home at the age of 14 to sing in the saloons of St. Louis, Cliff chose the ukulele because it was the cheapest instrument and was portable. In 1918, he popularized a song called \"Ja-Da\" on the vaudeville circuit. He was incorporated into the act of vaudeville headliner Joe Frisco, with whom he played the Palace in New York.\n\nBeginning a long recording career in 1919, hit records for Ukulele Ike included \"California, Here I Come,\" \"Yes Sir, That's My Baby.\" \"I'll See You in My Dreams,\" \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love,\" and \"Singin' in the Rain.\"\n\nEdwards appeared on Broadway in the shows The Mimic World in 1921; co-starred with Adele and Fred Astaire in the George and Ira Gershwin musical Lady, Be Good! in the 1924-1925 season; and performed in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927 in the 1927-1928 season.\n\nEdwards was playing the Los Angeles Orpheum Theatre when M-G-M executive Irving Thalberg caught his act, and signed him up to appear in The Hollywood Revue of 1929. He sang his hit tune \"Singin' in the Rain\" along with six other songs, including the wonderful \"Charlie, Ike and Gus\" with Charles King, and Gus Edwards, in the film.\n\nEdwards made an appearance with Rube Wolf, Polly Moran and Bobby Watson at the \"Midnight Matinee\" on Saturday, June 22, 1929, along with the film The Hollywood Revue of 1929.\n\n\"Ukulele Ike\" became a specialty player in films and appeared in many of them: Way Out West (released in August, 1930), Hell Divers (which played the Chinese in December, 1931), George White's 1935 Scandals (played the Chinese in May, 1935), Saratoga (played in July, 1937).\n\nEdwards even had a bit part in Gone with the Wind (released in December, 1939). He played the soldier in the hospital in Atlanta who tells Melanie and Scarlett about his family back home: \"Did I tell you about my brother Jeb, Ma'am?\" Unmistakeable voice.\n\nAfter playing the reporter Endicott in His Girl Friday released in January, 1940, Edwards climbed to even great heights, by providing the voice of Jiminy Cricket in the animated film Pinocchio, released in February, 1940. No one can forget his vocal for the song \"When You Wish Upon a Star.\"\n\nEdwards formed a backup band and did a short called Cliff Edwards and His Buckaroos, released in March, 1941. He then did the voice of the lead crow in Disney's Dumbo, released in October, 1941, where he sang \"When I See an Elephant Fly.\"\n\nDuring World War II, Edwards was featured in a number of \"B\" Western musicals with his Buckaroos, then voiced Jiminy Cricket again in Disney's Fun and Fancy Free, released in September, 1947. Edwards would provide the voice for this charming character up through the episode \"This Is Your Life Donald Duck\" on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color in March, 1960. He appeared on The Mickey Mouse Club show, and had his own show on CBS, The Cliff Edwards Show three afternoons a week on CBS in 1949.\n\nA profligate spender and continual smoker, Edwards had blown through all his money by divorcing each of his three wives. Felled by a cardiac arrest while living in a home for indigent actors, his body was claimed and buried by both the Actor's Fund America and the Motion Picture and Television Relief Fund. His grave marker at Valhalla Memorial Park in Burbank, California, was paid for by the Disney studio.\n\nGus Edwards\n\nBorn: Gustav Simon, August 18, 1879, in Hohensalza, Prussia (now Inowroclaw, Poland)\n\nDied: November 7, 1945, in Los Angeles, Cailfornia\n\nGus Edwards was a pereminent vaudevillian, songwriter, music publisher, producer, and eventually, musical movie star.\n\nMoving with his family to America in 1885, he got a singing job in showbiz as a young lad. He began as a \"song plugger\" at Koster and Bial's Music Hall in New York City. By age 17, he was touring with an act called The Newsboys Quintet. Despite not being able to make musical notation, he wrote a song with Tom Daly for May Irwin called \"All I Want is My Black Baby Back,\" and his songwriting career commenced. In this song, a \"Black Baby\" refers to a boyfriend stationed at Camp Black, which was on Long Island between March and September 1898, during the Spanish-American War. Oh.\n\nIt was while entertaining troops at Camp Black that Edwards met his longtime collaborator Will Cobb; the pair would write many songs together while Edwards traveled the vaudeville circuit with his own company. Several prominent performers Edwards has been credited with discovering include: Walter Winchell, George Jessel, Eddie Cantor, the Marx Brothers, Eleanor Powell, Ray Bolger, and the Lane Sisters. His reputation was such that an industry nickname for him was \"The Star Maker.\"\n\nEdwards even owned his own theatre in New York City: the Gus Edwards Music Hall in 1908. Edwards wrote the music for many Broadway shows. He wrote music for the first musical staging of The Wizard of Oz in 1903, and worked on the Ziegfeld Follies of 1907, 1909, and 1910. His most enduring composition is the music, with Will Cobb's lyric, of \"School Days\" which goes: \"School days, school days, good old golden rule days. . .\" This guy was everywhere. He even wrote a tune for The Jazz Singer in 1927 called \"If a Girl Like You Loved a Boy Like Me\" but didn't get any screen credit. Not a big deal.\n\nGus Edwards was lured out to Hollywood in order to write virtually all the music and to star in M-G-M's big musical The Hollywood Revue of 1929. While out on the coast, he made an appearance at the \"Midnite Matinee\" performances of both Sid Grauman's \"Broadway Nights\" Prologue and the film The Broadway Melody, on Saturday, March 9, 1929. Edwards was asked back to appear at the \"Midnite Matinee\" again on Saturday, June 8, 1929.\n\nWhen The Hollywood Review of 1929 played the Chinese, Gus Edwards appeared at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" late shows on Saturday nights twice: once on July 6, 1929 (where a star-studded micro version of School Days was performed by Edwards along with Fanny Brice, Benny Rubin, George K. Arthur, Charles King, Bert Wheeler, Tom Patricola, Polly Moran, Lola Lane, Louise Groody, Louise Dresser and Marie Dressler), and Edwards appeared again on Saturday, September 14, 1929.\n\nFinally, Edwards made his last appearance at the \"Hollywood Midnite Frolic\" which accompanied the film Rogue Song, on Saturday, February 1, 1930.\n\nEdwards had a radio program originating in Los Angeles over KFWB called School Days of the Air. While Edwards was still alive, Bing Crosby portrayed him (sort of) in a musical bio-(sort of) pic called The Star Maker in 1939. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.\n\nBorn: December 9, 1909, in New York, New York\n\nDied: May 7, 2000, in New York, New York\n\nDouglas Fairbanks, Jr. naturally followed his famous father into the picture business, made several good films during the 1930s, then became a talented naval officer during World War II.\n\nJunior was born to Douglas Fairbanks and his first wife Anna Beth Sully, when Doug was appearing on Broadway frequently. The marriage broke up in 1918, by which time, Fairbanks had become a huge star. Doug Jr. was raised by his mother in Paris and New York.\n\nGiven an acting contract at Paramount in 1923, he was only 14 when his first starring role became Stephen Steps Out. He became a supporting player, which was more suited for him, playing in Stella Dallas in 1925, and A Woman of Affairs in 1928.\n\nHe was cast in the the film Our Modern Maidens, and began dating its star, Joan Crawford; they appeared together at the \"Midnite Matinee\" for The Broadway Melody on Saturday, March 30, 1929, where he was a \"star guest\" along with Anita Stewart, and George Sidney. Fairbanks and Crawford married later that year in June.\n\nDoug Jr. went over to Warner Bros to star in The Dawn Patrol in 1930, and Little Caesar in 1931, He scored a coup by co-starring with Katherine Hepburn in Morning Glory on a loanout to R-K-O in 1933.\n\nMiffed at Warners' asking him to take a pay cut, Fairbanks spent the next couple of years working in England, where he became friends with Lord Mountbatten. Returning to Hollywood, he was put into The Prisoner of Zenda (which played the Chinese in 1937), and co-starred with Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen in the classic adventure film Gunga Din in 1939.\n\nAfter that, Fairbanks was shoved in one action film after another. When the U.S. entered World War II, Fairbanks immediately enlisted and was assigned to Mountbatten's Commando staff in England. He was later assigned to South America, then witnessed the disaster of the Convoy PQ17 in the North Atlantic.\n\nFairbanks became interested in Military deception, and was heavily involved in the Beach Jumper program, which divereted attention from defenders by staging misleading offensives. Fairbanks recieved several decorations for his service and remained on duty in the Reserves until 1954, retiring with the rank of Captain.\n\nReturning to Hollywood after the war, he found himself in That Lady in Ermine (which played the Chinese in 1948), but was dissatisfied with the result. He returned to England. Despite what could be seen as indifference to the picture business, he stayed with it, appearing in English films and television. He even toured in My Fair Lady in 1968, and appeared as a guest on The Love Boat with Ginger Rogers, which aired in November, 1979.\n\nHe published his autobiography: Salad Days in 1988, and wrote memiors of his military service, A Hell of a War in 1993.\n\nFanchon and Marco\n\nFanchon (Wolff) Simon\n\nBorn: September 14, 1892, in Los Angeles, Cailfornia\n\nDied: February 3, 1965, in Los Angeles, Cailfornia\n\nMarco Wolff\n\nBorn: April 21, 1894, in Los Angeles, Cailfornia\n\nDied: October 23, 1977, in Los Angeles, Cailfornia\n\nFanchon and Marco created a company which organized and toured stage presentations, called \"Ideas\" to deluxe movie houses around the country. Fanchon and Marco Ideas were showcased in many prominent theatres during both the silent era and into the sound era, where the economic advantage of mounting one unit and sending it around on the road, allowed the \"movie with stage show\" to continue, where other theatres dropped them. The idea behind the \"Ideas\" is more-or-less replicated in the film Footlight Parade from 1933.\n\nFanchon and Marco broke into showbiz on the vaudeville circuit by the time they were ten years old. Their act was as ballroom dancers with a finale of Marco playing the violin while Fanchon perched on his shoulders. By 1919, they had fashioned the Fanchon and Marco Revues, which then morphed into a dance troupe: The Sunkist Beauties, who went on a national tour in 1921, thereby giving F&M the notion of bicycling shows around the country.\n\nThe F&M \"Ideas\" were underway by 1923. With names such as \"The Box of Candy Idea\" or \"Mickey Mouse Idea\" or \"All at Sea Idea\" or \"Top O'the World Idea\" or \"Gems & Jams Idea\" these show names are frequently depicted in photos of theatre marquees during the silent and early sound eras.\n\nSome of the talents who appeared in F&M shows include Ann Miller, Betty Grable, Bing Crosby, Buddy Edsen, Cyd Charisse, Doris Day, Fred and Adele Astaire, Joan Crawford, Judy Garland (The Gumm Sisters), Mae West, Mary Martin, Myrna Loy, and Shirley Temple.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the F&M Studio in Hollywood (where the Home Depot is today) was where all of the costumes and scenery were made for all of the shows. The Fanchon & Marco curcuit was large indeed, spanning the entire country. If you were booked into an \"Idea,\" you could look forward to many grueling weeks on the road. The F&M Studio also contained a school.\n\nAfter their costume shop made the costumes for Sid Grauman's Prologue \"Broadway Nights\" for The Broadway Melody in 1929, Fanchon & Marco were brought in to provide stage shows at the Chinese when Grauman wasn't doing his own prologues: the \"Moorish Melodic Fantasy\" for the film Morocco in 1930, \"presented\" the show \"Rhapsodie in Black\" for the film Trader Horn in January of 1931, and an untitled \"Stage Show Supreme\" for the film Dirigible in April of that year.\n\nF&M operated a small chain of \"Southside Theatres\" in the Los Angeles Market, with their headquarters the Manchester Theatre downtown, but that was all done by 1950 or so. Frank Fay\n\nBorn: Francis Anthony Donner, November 17, 1891, in San Francisco, California\n\nDied: September 25, 1961, in Santa Monica, California\n\nFrank Fay was a successful comedian on the Broadway stage and in vaudeville. Born to an Irish family in San Francisco, Frank changed his name and lit out for the stage in 1918. He developed a natural delivery method, one which Jack Benny later admitted was an inspiration for his own stage persona. He bacame a very well-known vaudeville headliner, as well as appearing on Broadway — in 1922, he staged, starred, wrote the book and the lyrics for the musical revue Frank Fay's Fables. The huge show flopped.\n\nIn 1928, he met a fast-rising starlette named Barbara Stanwyck, who was just recovering from the tragic death of her lover, Rex Cherryman. Fay and Stanwyck married on August 26, 1928.\n\nFay must have been out in Hollywood to make his first film, The Show of Shows at Warner Bros., when he was asked to be the Master of Ceremonies at the \"Midnite Matinee\" performances of both Sid Grauman's \"Broadway Nights\" Prologue and the film The Broadway Melody, on Saturday, April 6, 1929. He was also recruited to vamp onstage when the people trying to attend the world premiere of Hell's Angels on Tuesday, May, 27, 1930 couldn't get to the theatre due to a huge traffic jam — Grauman's Prologue people were still trying to get it together and were grateful for the delay.\n\nFay had prominent roles in several films in 1930-31: Under a Texas Moon, The Matrimonial Bed, Bright Lights, and God's Gift to Women (all directed by Michael Curtiz) but somehow, film audiences weren't digging him onscreen.\n\nWarners' giving Fay his own production company might not have been the best idea: his next film, the prophetically-named A Fool's Advice from 1932, was such a bad title, they had to re-name it: Meet the Mayor, which is not exactly an improvement.\n\nSo Fay drifted in Hollywood while his wife Barabra Stanwyck was becoming a household name. Although the two divorced in 1935, and Frank didn't drown himself, their relationship is widely thought to have been the inspiration behind the film A Star is Born (which played the Chinese in 1937).\n\nIn 1944, Fay created the role of Elwood P. Dowd in the original Broadway production of Harvey, opposite Josephine Hull. Reports are that Fay had become an uncontrolable egomaniac, and had to be replaced by Joe E. Brown and others, like James Stewart and Bert Wheeler for a time.\n\nFay has susequently gone down in history as being a notorious, anti-semitc, pro-Hitler, HUAC-supporting, zealot. David Wark Griffith\n\nBorn: David Llewelyn Wark Griffith, January 22, 1875, in LaGrange, Kentucky\n\nDied: July 23, 1948, in Hollywood, California\n\nD. W. Griffith is one of the most important figures in film history. Making films from 1908, his wildly creative sense of what could be done in a movie made his name prominent when actors were not billed by name onscreen at all. He had stunning sucesses with the feature film format, but sometimes overeached.\n\nGriffith's father had been a colonel in the Confederate Army, and had been elected to the Kentucky state legislature, but this life of privilege ended when the man died when David was ten years old. The young lad worked odd jobs at age 14 to help support the family.\n\nWanting to be a playwright, he found more acceptance as an actor. In 1907, Griffith tried to sell a scenario to Edison producer Edwin S. Porter, who gave him a part in the short Rescued from an Eagle's Nest. The following year, 1908, Griffith bagan his association with the Biograph Company, and assumed directing command there, making 48 shorts in his first year alone. In 1910, his film In Old California was the first film to be shot in Hollywood, and from which Griffith would base all of his future operations.\n\nConvinced that audiences would be able to follow longer, more complex stories without suffering eyestrain, Griffith embraced the feature-length film, beginning with Judith of Belinda in 1914.\n\nResistance to longer films put Griffith on the path of becoming a renegade. Leaving Biograph, he went to work at Mutual, then Mutual-Reliance, then Triangle, which was a forerunner of the later United Artists. Griffith bet the farm on an adaptation of the novel The Clansman, filming The Birth of a Nation in 1915. The two-hour-fifteen minute film clearly demonstrated that a long story — no matter how incendiary — if told with skill, could find an audience. Nation made a ridiculously huge amount of money.\n\nHurt by criticism of Birth of a Nation, Griffith sought to answer his critics with his next film, Intolerance, in 1916. The three-hour film is a tour de force of cinematic techniques, interweaving four different storylines to demonstrate a single theme. But even today, the picture is too much of a good thing — the film failed to recoup its staggering $400,000 budget.\n\nGriffith, forced to pick up the pieces, worked at First-National, then Artcraft, and finally joining forces with Charles Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, to begin a new studio in 1919, United Artists, which would distribute the films each partner made. His first film for UA, Broken Blossoms, is considered Griffith's masterpiece, closely followed by Way Down East in 1920. These films are dramatically successful without the dubious morality of Birth of a Nation or the needless complexity of Intolerance. His relationship with UA ended in 1924, after Isn't Life Wonderful flopped. Several years of sparse activity followed.\n\nIt was during this time that Sid Grauman asked Griffith to participate in the dedication program of the Chinese Theatre on Wednesday, May 18, 1927. Griffith was introduced as the evening's Master of Ceremonies by fellow director Fred Niblo. Griffith introduced Will Hays and Mark Pickford, to begin the first program of Sid Grauman's Prologue \"Glories of the Scriptures\" for the film King of Kings.\n\nGriffith made a pair of talkies for United Artists, both of which flopped. Although other producers and directors offered assignments to Griffith, none of them amounted to anything much. He was presented with an Honorary Academy Award in 1936, and was made a Lifetime Member of the Director's Guild in 1938. Griffith had maintained a modest family seat in LaGrange, Kentucky, and lived there for many years. While visiting Hollywood in hopes of working on a project, he was found slumped over in a chair in the lobby of the Knickerbocker Hotel on July 23, 1948. He died on the way to the hospital.\n\nRaymond Hackett\n\nBorn: July 15, 1902, in New York, New York\n\nDied: July 7, 1958, in Hollywood, California\n\nRaymond Hackett was a child actor who made the transition to adult roles — sort of. He got along in the picture biz, but more-or-less retired in the early 1930s.\n\nRaymond's parents were the theatre troupers Maurice and Florence Hackett. Older brother Albert and Raymond were \"stage mothered\" into show business; once she had done that, she divorced her husband and began making films for Lubin Manufacturing Company with her new flame and co-star Arthur V. Johnson. Brother Albert went into writing for theatre and film, eventually partnering with his wife Francis Goodrich, and had a rather successful career, writing the scripts for The Thin Man in 1934, and and It's a Wonderful Life in 1946, among other things.\n\nRaymond, on the other hand, went into performance mode. He made his Broadway debut at the age of five in the play The Toymaker of Nuremberg in late 1907. His first film was A Matter of Business with stepfather Arthur V. Johnson for Lubin in 1912.\n\nHe continued to appear on Broadway and films on a fairly regular basis into his early 20s. He played Gloria Swanson's brother in The Love of Sunya in 1927, but the picture didn't do well for his career.\n\nIn June, 1929, a film Hackett was in opened; The Trail of Mary Dugan was a star vehicle for Norma Shearer, with Hackett playing her brother, trying to defend sis against a murder charge. Hackett appeared onstage at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" late show of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, July 27, 1929. The show also included Jack Benny, and Charles Bickford, with Benny's pal, Benny Rubin as master of ceremonies.\n\nAfter Mary Dugan, Hackett was cast in Madame X as — Ruth Chatterton's lawyer, defending her against a murder charge, all the while not knowing she's his mother! Lionel Barrymore directed.\n\nHe played brother to Robert Montgomery, who is trying to make it with Joan Crawford in Our Blushing Brides in July, 1930, and he seems to have done pretty well opposite Milton Sills in the first sound version of The Sea Wolf, released that September.\n\nBut after Seed at Universal in 1931, Hackett hung the Hollywood bag up. He married silent film star Blanche Sweet in 1935, and presumably, lived happily ever after with Sweet until his death in 1958 at the age of 56. Sweet remained a widow until her death in 1986.\n\nMarion Harris\n\nBorn: Mary Ellen Harris, April 4, 1896, probably in Indiana\n\nDied: April 23, 1944, in New York City, New York\n\nMarion Harris is widely considered to be the first white singer to popularize jazz and blues music.\n\nNothing is known of her childhood — not even where she grew up — but by 1914, at age 18, she was singing in the movie houses of Chicago; a good place to learn music, if there ever was one. Eventually, Vernon Castle introduced her to Irving Berlin, who put her in a show called Stop! Look! Listen! in 1915.\n\nHarris began recording for Victor Records in 1916, with a big success with the song \"I Ain't Got Nobody\" in 1917. Victor forebade her from singing the song \"St. Louis Blues,\" so she left and began recording for Columbia in 1920, where she had hits with — \"St. Louis Blues,\" and \"I'm Just Wild About Harry.\" In 1922, Harris jumped ship for Brunswick. While recording for them, her hits were \"Who's Sorry Now?,\" \"It Had to Be You,\" \"How Come You Do Me Like You Do?,\" \"Tea for Two,\" \"I'll See You in My Dreams,\" and \"The Man I Love.\"\n\nNaturally, a singer toured to sell records, so Marion did plenty of that, traveling all over the place. It wasn't until January, 1927, that Marion Harris made her one and only Broadway appearance, in a major role, in a musical called Yours Truly, with Leon Errol, running for 127 perfs. She made a short film at M-G-M called Marion Harris, Songbird of Jazz in 1928.\n\nWhile shooting her first film, Devil-May-Care at M-G-M, Harris appeared onstage as a \"Guest of Honor\" at the \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" late show of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, August 3, 1929. The stage show also included Raquel Torres, Gwen Lee, and Josephine Dunn, with Lynn Cowan as master of ceremonies.\n\nAfter Devil-May-Care was released in December, 1929, an illness of some sort prevented her from working in Hollywood. Harris didn't have a part in a film until the 1934 indie, Trouble Ahead (aka: Falling in Love), which was shot in England, where she played a café singer.\n\nContinuing to record for Victor again, Harris made appearances on radio, including The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour on NBC. She sang during a long engagement at the Café de Paris in London, England, and she sang on BBC radio. By 1936, she had married theatrical agent Leonard Urry. Their house was destroyed in a German air-raid in 1941. Hoping to find a cure for a neurological problem, Harris returned to New York, obtained treatment, and was discharged, only to die in a hotel fire in 1944. Will Hays\n\nBorn: November 5, 1879, in Sullivan, Indiana\n\nDied: March 7, 1954, in Sullivan, Indiana\n\nWill Hays, a successful Indiana layer, became the chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1918, and was the campaign manager for Warren G. Harding in 1920. As a reward, he was appointed Postmaster General of the United States in 1921.\n\nIt was not to be, however. In 1924, Hays was lured away from the Harding Cabinet in order to become president of the Motion PIcture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA), an industry trade association, who were looking for a way to avoid political action over the content of American-made films and the behavior of the people who made them. The MPPDA paid Hays an extravagant salary, and gave him all of the personal publicity anyone could ask for.\n\nHays sought to establish a nationwide standard of what could be shown in theatres without having individual states interfere with their own censorship boards, as had been done previously. It goes without saying that what could be presented in both the strictest state and also the most lienient state, was not too risqué.\n\nAt first, the code was an informal agreement, but without a formal code controlling content, producers continued to sneak racy content into their films. Prized today, these films are called \"Pre-Code\" films.\n\nIt was during this time that Sid Grauman asked Hays to participate in the dedication program of the Chinese Theatre on Wednesday, May 18, 1927. Master of Ceremonies D. W. Griffith introduced Hays from the stage, who then introduced Mary Pickford, who begin the first program of Sid Grauman's Prologue \"Glories of the Scriptures\" for the film King of Kings.\n\nThe addition of sound to the movies meant that they could be audibly offensive as well as visually. In 1934, Hays formally adopted a set of rules prohibiting just about everything, and set about insisting that all member producers submit their scripts for upcoming films for review by the MPPDA to insure that the \"Hays Code\" was adhered to. Completed films were reviewed for objectional content as well. If a film failed to receive the MPPDA's \"seal of approval,\" it would be impossible for that film to get theatres to play it, because just about all of the theatres in the country were owned by members of the MPPDA. There was also a list of performers who were \"unfit\" to appear in films.\n\nHayes retired in 1945, returning to Indiana, where he died in 1954. The MPPDA has morphed into today's MPAA, which oversees the current Rating Code Administration's system of G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17 ratings.\n\nCharles Kaley\n\nBorn: June 16, 1902, on Red Cloud, Nebraska\n\nDied: September 7, 1965, in Santa Clara County, California\n\nCharles Kaley is a bit of a mystery. A singer, piano player, violinist, and, we assume, dancer, Kaley shook off the dust of his native Nebraska and lit out for the big time.\n\nThe details of how this came about are lost to history, but we do know that he must have had something. in 1922, when bandleader Abe Lyman set up his \"California Orchestra\" at the Coconut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, he made the strapping 20-year-old was their featured male vocalist. When Lyman began recording for the Brunswick label, Kaley vocalized on a number of tracks, beginning with \"No, No, Nora\" released in August 1923.\n\nWe hear that Kaley was a star of the stage, and that could very well be true, but the record, so to speak, shows that he was kept very busy making records. Beginning in 1926, he did a lot of recordings for Columbia where he was the lead vocal with various bands, such as \"I Ain't Got Nobody\" with the Art Kahn Orchestra \"If I'd Only Believed in You\" with the Radiolites, he played piano and sang \"Baby Face,\" \"Blue Skies\" with The Knickerbockers, \"Muddy Water\" with Don Voorhees leading the Earl Carroll's Vanities Orchestra and \"Ain't She Sweet?\" with the Radiolites, to name only a few. He also wrote a song or two, including \"Strolling in the Moonlight\" in 1928 with Will Waldron and Marty Bloom. The sheet music shows Kaley holding a conductor's baton, but we do not know of any ensemble he formed or led.\n\nBut he was reknown none the less. When M-G-M announced that they would be making a talkie musical of the hit novel Lord Byron of Broadway, they thought they would have William Haines in the title role. Turned out that Haines couldn't sing very well, so they cast Kaley for the role.\n\nKaley was probably shooting the film when he appeared at the Chinese Theatre's \"Billion Dollar Midnite Matinee\" of The Hollywood Review of 1929 on Saturday, September 14, 1929, sharing the bill with Gus Edwards, Anita Page, Gwen Lee, Armida, Edward Lankow, Jack Stanley and Cecil Cunningham.\n\nWhen Lord Byron of Broadway (released in February 1930) came out, Kaley enjoyed a couple of hit records to go along with it: \"Should I?\" and \"A Bundle of Old Love Leters,\" both written by by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed. Kaley sings these songs in the film with fellow \"Who's Who\" members Cliff Edwards and Benny Rubin. Gwen Lee is in it too.\n\nThen something must have happened, because after making a couple of musical shorts in 1930, his recording career came to halt. He has what is called a \"small role\" in the Joe E. Brown starrer Bright Lights (1935) directed by Busby Berkeley.\n\nKaley's last film credit is his playing the bad guy in the Fred Scott western The Singing Buckaroo (1937). We presume that after this, he got out of the film biz.\n\nBut what he did after that — who knows? He died at the age of 63.\n\nArthur Kay\n\nBorn: January 16, 1881, in unknown location in Germany\n\nDied: December 19, 1969, in Hollywood, California\n\nA classically trained musician, Arthur Kay became well-known for adapting the classical repertory into the realm of operetta and musical comedy. Moving to America in the late 1910s, Kay found himself working in the theatres of Seattle, Washington. By later in 1920, Kay was conducting the popular Sunday morning classical concerts at Sid Grauman's Theatre in Los Angeles (later known as the Million Dollar). Kay was conducting and was musical director for the first show at the Music Box Theatre in Hollywood, Carter DeHaven's Fancies, on October 20, 1926.\n\nTwelve months later, we find Kay having taken over the Grauman's Chinese Symphony Orchestra from Constantin Bakaleinikoff during the last few weeks of the run of King of Kings.\n\nThis placed Kay in the perfect position to write the score and to conduct the Sid Grauman prologue and the film The Gaucho, which opened in late October 1927. Kay's score for this picture was used throughout the country. He was ingested by the Fox Film Corp. at the beginning of the talkie era and conducted the orchestra for The Fox Movietone Follies of 1929. Since everything was recorded at the same time, vocalists call to him by name in the film, and he shouts back (off screen). He was one of several arrangers working with Max Steiner on his score for Gone with the Wind in 1939.\n\nKay must have had a fine sense of humor. He was seen occasionally onscreen as conductors, most famously in Citizen Kane. For many years he was the voice of Gandy Goose in the long-running series of cartoons with that character for Terrytoons.\n\nIn 1946, Kay became involved with the Broadway show The Song of Norway, credited with writing additional lyrics for the show, along with being its musical director, arranger, and choral director. He would also do the orchestral and choral arrangements for the original Broadway production of Kismet in 1953.\n\nKay was accustomed to filling any role needed on a film. He composed scores for a number of films throughout the 1930s, then switched to arranging and musical direction in film and television until he retired in 1966. Lola Lane\n\nBorn: Dorothy Mullican, May 21, 1906, in Macy, Indiana\n\nDied: June 22, 1981, in Santa Barbara, California\n\nLola Lane was the oldest performer of the Lane Sisters, a talented group of sisters, who made separate paths to movie startdom in Hollywood. They all sang well and made lots of movies — especially the baby, Priscilla.\n\nBorn to dentist Lorenzo Muillican, all five daughters grew up in Indianola, Indiana, where they lived in a huge rooming house the family operated. Against her Methodist principles, mother Cora Bell encouraged all her daughters to sing and play instruments. "
