        "text": "Jean Harlow (born March 3, 1911, Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.—died June 7, 1937, Los Angeles, California) was an American actress who was the original “Blonde Bombshell.” Known initially for her striking beauty and forthright sexuality, Harlow developed considerably as an actress, but she died prematurely at the height of her career.\n\nThe daughter of a prosperous Kansas City dentist, Harlow moved to Los Angeles with her mother after her parents’ separation. She was educated at the Hollywood School for Girls and, after her mother relocated to Chicago, at Ferry Hall Seminary in Lake Forest, Illinois. However, she abruptly quit school when she eloped at age 16. She and her husband moved to Beverly Hills. Her marriage broke up in 1928 when, against her husband’s wishes, she embarked upon an acting career. While briefly under contract to comedy producer Hal Roach, she attracted considerable attention with a small but memorable role in the Laurel and Hardy two-reeler Double Whoopee (1929), in which her legendary legs were revealed for the first time on-screen. After making her talking-picture debut in the Clara Bow vehicle The Saturday Night Kid (1929), she caught the eye of industrialist and erstwhile film producer Howard Hughes, who hired her to replace Norwegian actress Greta Nissen in the revised talkie version of his silent aviation epic Hell’s Angels (1930). Though her performance was uneven, she created a mild sensation with the now-classic line “Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?”\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nAfter the release of Hell’s Angels, Hughes loaned Harlow out to other studios. She appeared in decorative but undemanding roles in such films as Warner Bros.’ The Public Enemy (1931) and Columbia’s Platinum Blonde (1931), after which Hughes sold her contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $60,000. It was not until she was cast in a role written by Anita Loos in Red-Headed Woman (1932) that MGM executives saw Harlow’s potential as a wisecracking comedian. Her popularity with filmgoers, critics, and colleagues alike grew with each successive film: Red Dust (1932), Dinner at Eight (1933), Hold Your Man (1933), and Bombshell (1933) were all box office smashes. Red Dust was one of the best of the movies in which Harlow starred with Clark Gable; the two also headlined in Hold Your Man, China Seas (1935), and Wife vs. Secretary (1936). After the censorious Motion Picture Production Code was strengthened in 1934, she counterbalanced the “racier” aspects of her screen image with a newly acquired sophistication and an appealing vulnerability. Her films from that period included Reckless (1935), Suzy (1936), and Libeled Lady (1936)."
