        "text": "George Reeves, Barry Nelson, DeForest Kelley and Betty White were Don Hanmer’s “co-stars” in his first film role.\n\nDon Hanmer (1918-2003)(1) was introduced to me by Ralph Senensky at our very first Dinosaur Club meeting. He had the voice and face of someone who entertained me countless times in the movies, and especially on television…but I just couldn’t place the name. I suppose that’s one of the hazards of being a character actor. He told me that it wasn’t a big deal to him when people didn’t know his name, and told a funny story about how he and some other actors met with a producer in the hope of landing a role in a major television movie; the producer, for some reason not recognizing him, said, “Thank you all for coming, but we’re looking for a Don Hanmer type”!\n\nDon acted in scores of scores of television shows, and a few movies [most notably as the butterfly trader in “Papillon” (1973)]. Years before he had acted under the direction of two other members of the club, directors Ralph Senensky and Lamont Johnson. Between the three of them not one question of mine about the golden age of television went unanswered.\n\nI haven’t been able to find any meaningfully biographical information on Don, but he told me he served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, appeared as an extra in both the stage and movie versions of Moss Hart’s “Winged Victory” (1944), and the following year had his first performance as an actor in “Time to Kill”(2) a 23 minute WWII U.S. Navy morale booster, with George Reeves, Barry Nelson, Jimmy Lydon, Don Taylor, and also in their first film roles, DeForest Kelley and Betty White. Don said it was filmed in a couple of days at the Motion Picture Unit U.S. Army Airforces, First Motion Picture Unit, dubbed “Fort Roach,” because it was located at the Hal Roach studios in Culver City, CA.\n\nAfter the war, Don joined the famed Actor’s Studio in New York, where he honed his craft, which soon turned into a busy career in live television. He also met and married his first wife, Marlon Brando’s sister, Jocelyn, with whom they had two sons.\n\nRalph Senensky(2) reminded me of two stories Don shared at one of our lunches…which Ralph articulated them far better than I.\n\nDon was a member of the famed Actors’ Studio. He told me of an incident years before in one of his classes. The assignment was to perform an activity using sense memory. Don chose to eat a banana. Seated in his chair in the classroom he pantomimed picking up a banana and slowly starting to peel it. At this moment Cloris Leachman arrived late. She quietly slipped in and took a seat directly behind Don and took a banana out of a sack for her late lunch. Don, engrossed in his pantomime suddenly looked up and said to Lee Strasberg, “I’m so into this, I can actually smell the banana.”\n\nAlso, on THE BULL ROARER, an episode of the television series BREAKING POINT, Don played a trainer at the Guide Dogs for The Blind school. The head of the school, Bill Johns, came to Hollywood from San Rafael and served as a technical advisor during our filming. He brought with him one of the trainers from San Rafael to help tend to their seeing eye dogs.. At one point I asked Bill if what Don as doing on film was correct. He responded that the only thing wrong with his performance was that since the dog trainers did a tremendous amount of walking as they first trained the dogs and then trained the blind people how to use the dogs, Don’s appearance was quite a bit more rotund than those of the San Rafael trainers!\n\n(1) http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0360168/\n\n(2) www.ralphsenensky.com\n\nFree downloads:\n\n“Time to Kill” (1945)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QShd6twB3Do\n\n“Tales of Tomorrow” (1952)\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/video/hulu/vi2662466073/\n\nVisit our website –\n\nwww.sprocketvault.com\n\nKeep up to date with our new Sprocket Vault releases by liking us on Facebook www.facebook.com/sprocketvault/\n\nAlso, be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLHjjG-o5Ny5BDykgVBzdrQ .\n\nIn his 80s he still had that amazing voice…\n\nOne of the members of our “club” was Lamont Johnson (1922-2010)(1)(2), who used his dynamic bass radio voice on network radio while still in his teens. He enjoyed a long and successful career as an actor (radio, stage, screen, television) and director (I can’t begin to list all of his credits).\n\nOne time we were talking about overcoming difficult situations, and he gave me three examples he experienced, one serious, and two humorous:\n\nLamont Johnson was a sickly and painfully shy child who was an invalid until age 10 because of suffering TB of his leg. He said his voice helped him get good parts in school plays, and that plus years of psychoanalysis, brought him out of his shell.\n\nLamont played Tarzan in “Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle”(3) on Mutual Radio in the early 1950s, which was sponsored by Post Cereals. On one occasion Post asked him to perform the Tarzan yell while saying the words “P-o-s-t R-a-i-s-i-n B-r-a-n,” a difficult job to do under any circumstances, but he had to do it live, and with only an hour to rehearse. He succeeded, and gave me a spot-on rendition 50 years after the fact…muted so as not to disturb the other restaurant patrons!\n\nLamont’s first feature film as a director was “A Covenant with Death” (1967)(4). The famous Mexican actor Emilio Fernández(5), notorious as a loose cannon on the set (and everywhere else), played the role of Ignacio. The evening before the first day of shooting Lamont was up late obsessing about his first effort for the big screen. Around 2:00 AM he got a phone call from the local police…Emilio was in jail; he got into a bar fight and knifed someone! Lamont rushed to the jail, where Emilio, still woozy, was in tears, “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, Mr. Johnson, for causing you this trouble!” Much to Lamont’s relief, the police brought the remorseful actor to the set in handcuffs, let him play his scenes. They put the cuffs on him and brought him back to jail…a scenario repeated until the filming ended.\n\nLamont was blacklisted during the McCarthy era, and throughout his life aligned himself with progressive causes. He told me he worked extensively as a director of made for television movies, because that medium, rather than the big screen, was much more receptive to portraying controversial subjects. Lamont wrote the screenplay as well as directed what he told me was his favorite TV movie, “The Execution of Private Slovik” (1974)(6), the story of the only American soldier executed (since the Civil War) for desertion during World War II.\n\nInto his 80s he never tired of answering my questions, and especially articulating his ideas for future movies dealing with social causes.\n\nWith that booming voice of his I would have been happy to listen if he simply read from the phone book.\n\n(1) http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=johnsonlamo\n\n(2) http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0425593/\n\n(3) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071477/\n\n(4) http://www.erbzine.com/mag23/2337.html\n\n(5) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061525/\n\n(6) http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0273477/\n\nContact kit@kitparker.com\n\nVisit our website to order DVDs –\n\nwww.sprocketvault.com\n\nKeep up to date with our new Sprocket Vault releases by liking us on Facebook www.facebook.com/sprocketvault/\n\nAlso, be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLHjjG-o5Ny5BDykgVBzdrQ .\n\nBurgess Meredith in “Printer’s Devil”\n\nI met Ralph Senensky through a mutual friend who knew we both collected movie posters. During our first meeting we talked mostly about posters although I knew Ralph directed television shows. That is until I remembered he directed my all-time favorite “Twilight Zone,” (“Printer’s Devil” (1963), starring Burgess Meredith) that episode really had an affect on me; still does. At that point I asked him to share his credits, and what a long list of classic shows from every conceivable genre; “Route 66” to “Star Trek”, “The Fugitive” to “The Bill Cosby Show,” “The Paper Chase” to “The Waltons,” and so many more.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784198/filmoseries#tt0060028\n\nRalph Senensky at home in Carmel, California\n\nI found Ralph to be a friendly, unpretentious, gentleman with a sense of humor and a memory as sharp as a tack. He answered my endless questions, like how he was able to produce such polished looking work under the budget and time constraints of TV, and which stars were easy (or hard) to work with.\n\nI especially found exciting his stories when he was in his early 30s and working in various capacities at CBS during the last half of the 1950s, the Golden Era of live television…the nights of programs like “Playhouse 90,” when there were no retakes…everything went out over the air as-is.\n\nAs our friendship developed we talked about all kinds of things, not just about showbiz.\n\nThe good news is that Ralph created an incredible blog. He talks about directing, writing, and everything connected with making prime-time television shows, often using film clips to illustrate his points. I especially found interesting pages of his marked up scripts with last minute changes that changed a scene from good to great.\n\nwww.senensky.com\n\nOne day Ralph mentioned three friends who had retired in the Monterey area, silent film actor and radio and film legend, True Boardman, stage and radio actor; director, Lamont Johnson; and prolific character actor, Don Hanmer. I suggested we all get together and have lunch and knew they would tell great show business stories…and I was certainly right! The five of us agreed to meet for lunch every other week, and I was in heaven…what a nice group of guys who checked their ego’s at the door. Our lunches lasted for a few years, and it is hard for me to describe how much I enjoyed them. Ralph referred to our group as “Hollywood expatriates,” but my wife called us, “The Dinosaur Club.”\n\nI’ll tell some stories about the other members of our “club” in future blogs.\n\nComplete List of Ralph Senensky’s Theatre and Television credits:\n\nTelevision:\n\n1955-1961\n\nAt the beginning of his television career Ralph worked at CBS in various production staff positions by day, and directed theatrical productions at night.\n\nARREST AND TRIAL (Ben Gazzara, Chuck Connors)\n\nMy Name Is Martin Burnham (James Whitmore, Nina Foch)\n\nFunny Man with a Monkey (Mickey Rooney, Mary Murphy)\n\nBANYON (Robert Forster, Joan Blondell, Richard Jaeckel)\n\nDead End\n\nThe Decent Thing to Do (Peter White)\n\nThe Graveyard Vote (Pat O’Brien, Tom Bosley)\n\nBARNABY JONES (Buddy Ebsen, Lee Merriwether)\n\nThe Murdering Class (Geraldine Brooks, Jerry Houser)\n\nTo Denise with Love and Murder (Bill Bixby)\n\nMurder Once Removed (Pamela Franklin, Robert Pine)\n\nTHE BIG VALLEY (Barbara Stanwyck, Linda Evans, Richard Long, Lee Majors, Peter Breck)\n\nBy Fires Unseen (Diane Baker)\n\nBIG BEND COUNTRY (James Keach)\n\n(One Hour Pilot)\n\nTHE BILL COSBY SHOW (Bill Cosby)\n\nGrowing, Growing, Grown\n\nBrotherly Love\n\nBlind Date (Cicely Tyson)\n\nChristmas Ballad (Rex Ingram)\n\nTHE BLUE KNIGHT (George Kennedy)\n\nTriple Threat (Michael O’Keefe)\n\nBLUE SKIES (Season Hubley, Tom Wopat, Pat Hingle, Alyson Croft, Kim Hauser, Danny Gerard)\n\nThe Visitor (Shawn Modrell)\n\nTHE BREAKING POINT (Paul Richards, Edward Franz)\n\nThe Bull Roarer (Ralph Meeker, Lou Antonio, Mariette Hartley)\n\nShadows of a Starless Night (Bradford Dillman)\n\nNever Trouble Trouble Till Trouble Troubles You (Diana Sands, Rex Ingram)\n\nCASABLANCA (David Soul, Scatman Crothers, Hector Elizondo, Ray Liotta)\n\nWho Am I Killing?
