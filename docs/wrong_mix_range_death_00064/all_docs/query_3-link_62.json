        "text": "There's one horse that I fondly remember - the black Morgan stallion named Rex who was billed as \"King of the Wild Horses\" and \"The Wonder Horse\".\n\nTrade publications and fan magazines had articles on the horse, including his registered name being \"Casey Jones\" and born 1915 in Texas.\n\nHis screen debut was the 1924 silent THE KING OF WILD HORSES for producer Hal Roach, and the hoss appeared in silents with Yakima Canutt, Jack Perrin, Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams, others. In the Jack Perrin silents at Universal beginning around 1927, Perrin was the hero and Rex was the \"hoss star\" ... and Rex got first billed over Perrin.\n\nThere's some interesting faces in those old silents. In NO MAN'S LAW (Hal Roach/Pathe, 1927), the brutish heavy with an eye patch is Oliver Hardy (of Laurel and Hardy fame) and he gets stomped to death by Rex at the end. In BLACK CYCLONE (Hal Roach/Pathe, 1925), the hero is a very young Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams, and there's some really great shots of he and Rex at full gallop (further proving that the polo playing Williams was one of Hollywood's premier riders).\n\n1930 trade publications reported that Rex was to be featured in a George O'Brien Fox film titled WYOMING WONDER. Then it was announced that John Wayne, who had just starred in Fox's THE BIG TRAIL (Fox, 1930), got the lead role. But that movie was never made.\n\nRex entertained us in serials THE VANISHING LEGION (Mascot, 1931), LAW OF THE WILD (Mascot, 1934), and THE ADVENTURES OF REX AND RINTY (Mascot, 1935), as well as features KING OF THE WILD HORSES (Columbia, 1933), STORMY (Universal, 1935), and KING OF THE SIERRAS (Grand National, 1938).\n\nRex was unique in that his name was often in the opening or closing film credits as well as the posters, pressbooks, etc. For example, in KING OF THE SIERRAS, Rex was billed last in the film credits, portraying a wild hoss named \"El Diablo\" (see screen captures on the left).\n\nThere are a couple of serials in which Rex is sometimes credited, but he didn't work in those films. Correction, he didn't work in one serial where he is often credited. He did appear in the other, along with several Rex look-alikes:\n\nRex was slated to do a fourth serial for Mascot, THE DEVIL HORSE (Mascot, 1932), but Mascot owner Nat Levine needed to do some budget pruning, so a black horse named \"Apache\" from horseman / trainer Tracy Layne was substituted. Some of you may remember a classic stunt scene in which Yakima Canutt hangs under a horse's neck and the animal tries to buck him off. That was filmed for the chapterplay THE DEVIL HORSE (Mascot, 1932), with Tracy Layne's \"Apache\" and Canutt doubling star Harry Carey, Sr.\n\nTracy Layne was also involved in the serial ROBINSON CRUSOE OF CLIPPER ISLAND (Republic, 1936). On page 30 in his Valley of the Cliffhangers (Jack Mathis Advertising, 1975), Republic expert Jack Mathis wrote that the real Rex did not work in that cliffhanger. Jack wrote: \"Rex, touted in publicity as \"King of the Wild Horses\", was played by Zane plus a double horse and, for a $35 daily package, owner Tracy Layne contracted for their services as well as his own in the bit part of Larkin, a Black Chamber decoder. Aside from the 11 days work guaranteed his animals ...\" (Based on my reviews of a decent DVD of the serial, Ye Old Corral webmaster has to disagree with old friend Jack Mathis on this. Toward the bottom of this webpage, you will find screen captures showing at least three different horses used in ROBINSON CRUSOE, one of which is Rex.)\n\nRex often ended the life of the movie villain. As mentioned above, Oliver Hardy was doomed by Rex in NO MAN'S LAW. Kindly old Lafe McKee occasionally stepped out of character and portrayed the brains heavy. In THE VANISHING LEGION serial, McKee is revealed as master villain \"the Voice\" and Rex dispatches him in Chapter 12 which is appropriately titled \"The Hoofs Of Horror\".\n\nWe do know that Jack \"Swede\" Lindell became Rex's trainer and he's occasionally listed in pressbooks and film credits. His full name was Jacob Walfred Lindell (1898 - 1952), was born in Sweden, and migrated to the United States when he was a teenager. Lindell initially settled in Texas but wound up training horses with a traveling circus. During a circus tour stop in California, he opted to remain there and got a job as a horse wrangler and trainer in early silent films. Below, you will find photos and more info on Jack Lindell.\n\nRex's last cinema adventure was the 1938 KING OF THE SIERRAS. Originally a M. H. Hoffman film project, it got lost during the mid 1935 merger of Hoffman's Liberty Company into the newly-formed Republic Pictures. A couple years later, it was resurrected by producer George A. Hirliman who added more footage (with different actors) and Grand National released it in 1938.\n\nAfter SIERRAS, Lee Doyle retired the horse, and scuttlebutt is that Rex died sometime in the mid 1940s on Doyle's ranch. If he was born circa 1915 and passed in the mid 1940s, his lifespan would have been about 30 years.\n\nWilliam Witney was a superb action and serial director at Republic Pictures and wrote about his days in Hollywood in the book In a Door, into a Fight, Out a Door, into a Chase: Moviemaking Remembered by The Guy at the Door (McFarland, 1996). Chapter 2 is titled \"Rex, King of the Wild Horses\" and includes remembrances of working for Nat Levine and Mascot, and filming THE LAW OF THE WILD (Mascot, 1934) with Rex. Some quotes from Witney:\n\n\"I was fascinated by the big horse called Rex. He was sixteen hands tall, a perfectly proportioned Morgan stallion.\"\n\n\"Swede Lindell, the trainer never left him alone unless he was locked into his own trailer.\"\n\n\"During a scene, the horse spun away from Lindell, knocking over a couple reflectors.\"\n\n\"Somebody yelled, 'Rex is loose!', and the crew scrambled for cover ...\"\n\n\"Rex took off after Ernie Adams ... a small man but a good athlete. He dove under a Buick touring car ...\"\n\n\"Rex dropped to his knees, turned his head sideways ... and tried to bite Ernie.\"\n\n\"I decided then and there that if Rex was loose, I wouldn't be standing with my back to a wall.\"\n\nAre there any reports on Rex's death? There's a couple tidbits, but no specific date on his passing:\n\nArizona's Little Hollywood: Sedona and Northern Arizona's Forgotten Film History 1923-1973 (Bar 225 Media, Ltd., 2010) by Joe McNeill is a wonderful, super researched book that documents the movies and filming done in Arizona. Rex's last years are covered on page 175 - excerpt: \"With the exception of stock footage appearances in more than a dozen B westerns into the 1950s, Sierras marked the end of the Movieland trail for the King of the Wild Horses. Doyle retired the aging Rex to his ranch near Flagstaff (Arizona), where he reportedly lived a well-earned peaceful existence until his death in the 1940s. Rex was buried in a horse cemetery on a hill behind the ranch house where Doyle lived ...\" (Sierras refers to Rex's final film, KING OF THE SIERRAS (Grand National, 1938; AKA BLACK STALLION).\n\nDoing further research in late 2020 - early 2021, I did find a photo and article on Doyle and Rex in the November 27, 1955 issue of the Arizona Republic newspaper, and the article indicates that Rex's lifespan was 24 years and died circa 1945 - excerpts: \"His own horse, Rex, 'King of the Wild Horses', was a movie personality for 20 of his 24 years.\" ; \"Rex, a brown stallion and a registered Morgan, has been dead 10 years, but his son sired a half dozen mares and stallions which are all potential movie stars.\" Link to that article: https://www.newspapers.com/clip/66866770/article-and-photo-on-lee-doyle-and/\n\nLee Doyle was 79 years of age when he passed away on October 19, 1960 at the Flaggstaff, Arizona Community Hospital.\n\nLinks\n\nAlthough some of the data is incomplete or inaccurate, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) has information on Rex, Jack Lindell, and 'Chick' Morrison. Note that there are two IMDb entries for Rex. A few corrections are needed and the two separate entries should be combined:\n\nRex: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1211065/\n\nJack Lindell: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0511521/\n\nCharles 'Chick' Morrison (1878 - 1924): https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607104/\n\nCarl Morrison : https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607096/\n\n3 minute \"Animal Celebrities\" home movie from Pathex in 1925 about Rin-Tin-Tin and Rex, the Wonder Horse.
