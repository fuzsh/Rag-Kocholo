        "text": "For a brief period in the 1970s, audiences were subject to a spate of disaster films featuring casts of stars. George Seaton’s Airport was followed by The Poseidon Adventure (Ronald Neame, 1972) and Earthquake (Mark Robson, 1974), and others, all huge box office hits. Arguably the best was The Towering Inferno, featuring a cast led by Newman and Steve McQueen, whose first appearance on film had been in Somebody Up There Likes Me. Newman plays architect Doug Roberts, creator of the 138-storey Glass Tower, while McQueen is fire chief Michael O’Halloran, called in to rescue guests trapped when faulty wiring causes catastrophe. The supporting cast of this quintessential weekend matinee includes the likes of Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, and Robert Wagner.\n\nScreening as part of the Paul Newman: American Icon season."
