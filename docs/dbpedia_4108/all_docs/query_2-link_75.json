        "text": "Here was a production so enormous that they had to double the duties of a normal production. Two studios put it together (20th Century and Warner Bros.), two directors were credited (one for talking scenes, one for action scenes), it's based on two novels smooshed together, and they very intricately and carefully designed it for two superstar leads (Steve McQueen and Paul Newman) to anchor the film. It's documented that McQueen only signed on if him and Newman had the exact same number of lines in the script. Even on the poster it's unsure who actually has top billing. McQueen's name comes first if you're reading left to right, but Newman's name is positioned higher if you're prone to read…\n\n“The Towering Inferno” is the original burning building and chill flick.\n\nThere’s plenty of fuel for the nearly three-hour fire: the flames feed off some of the biggest egos in the Hollywood of its era.\n\nWhat’s distinguishes “Inferno” from other disaster pictures of the 1970s isn’t that it’s necessarily a better film than the likes of “Airport” and “The Poseidon Adventure.” It’s just that everyone involved with it seemed to believe that they were making a masterpiece.\n\nThe sweet scent of hubris is layered like reams of smoke throughout “Inferno.”\n\nStars Paul Newman and Steve McQueen both insisted on equal top billing; and got it - by having their names listed diagonally.\n\nThe two macho stars both took it upon…\n\nMan, you don't see actors with faces like this anymore! Nothing says Easter Sunday quite like a 70's disaster movie starring Newman and McQueen. Watched this on the ITVX app so what was already a film that clocks in at 165 mins seems even longer with the same four adverts inserted every half an hour. Haven't seen this in forever and was surprised at how well it actually holds up the practical effects don't seem as dated as I feared they would - quite impressive actually when compared to today's overuse of CGI. Always a fun time to see a bunch of A-listers in what is essentially a b movie plot with Newman and McQueen not just battling for top…\n\n\"Architects.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's all our fault.\"\n\n\"Now, you know there's no sure way for us to fight a fire in anything over the seventh floor, but you guys just keep building 'em as high as you can.\"\n\n\"Hey, are you here to take me on, or the fire?\"\n\nAs election results continue to slowly roll in, I turn not to another political satire like The Candidate but rather to my favorite 70s disaster film, the ultimate icon of its genre, The Towering Inferno. 2 hours and 45 minutes of pure adrenaline, probably more effective horror than anything I watched in October. I've seen it so many times that I can practically quote the screenplay in my sleep, so in a…"
