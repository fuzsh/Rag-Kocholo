        "text": "The Towering Inferno | 1974\n\nThe Towering Inferno location: the entrance lobby: Hyatt Regency Hotel, Embarcadero Center, San Francisco\n\nHow to list the leads in this disaster epic? Steve McQueen and Paul Newman vied for top billing (supposedly even insisting on the same number of lines of dialogue each) and the film’s credits solve the problem with ‘diagonal’ billing: one name comes first if you read top-to-bottom, the other if you read left-to-right.\n\n20th Century Fox and Warner Brothers had both planned high-rise conflagration movies, based on two separate books, The Tower and The Glass Inferno. Avoiding a head-to-head, they decided to pool their resources and the result was The Towering Inferno.\n\nSet in San Francisco, the opening matte shot places the tower just about on the site where the Transamerica Pyramid now stands (five storeys of the doomed building were built on the lost at Fox’s Malibu Ranch).\n\nThe Towering Inferno location: the entrance to the doomed tower: Bank of America World Headquarters, California Street, San Francisco\n\nThe grand San Francisco entrance to the tower was actually the plaza entrance to the old Bank of America World Headquarters, now mundanely known by its address as 555 California Street at Kearny Street in the city’s Financial District. It was from the rooftop of the same building that psycho-killer Scorpio took potshots at SF citizens in Dirty Harry.\n\nThe Towering Inferno location: the entrance lobby: Hyatt Regency Hotel, Embarcadero Center, San Francisco\n\nThe lobby, though, with its glass elevators, is the Hyatt Regency San Francisco, 5 Embarcadero Center, a dizzying location seen also in Mel Brooks’ High Anxiety and sci-fi adventure Time After Time.\n\nThis being, at least in part, a Twentieth Century Fox movie, the computer controlled building surveillance centre was filmed in the basement of a Century City office building in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Towering Inferno location: the mansion of cheapskate electrician Simmons: Vallejo Street, Pacific Heights, San Francisco"
