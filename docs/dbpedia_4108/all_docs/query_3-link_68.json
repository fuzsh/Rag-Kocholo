        "text": "\"The Towering Inferno\" is a nearly three-hour suspense film for arsonists, firemen, movie-technology buffs, building inspectors, worry warts.The film, which opened yesterday at the National and Trans-Lux East Theaters, is a gigantic cautionary tale for people who want the worst to happen. It's this year's best end-of-the-world movie—the world in this case being represented by a 138-story, glass-and-steel San Francisco skyscraper that, on the night of its dedication, becomes history's biggest Roman candle. It doesn't burn down, just up.It's not a movie that bothers too much about the specifics of how it happened (something about cheap wiring). It's mainly concerned with what happens during the holocaust, that is with an almost interminable succession of rescue episodes involving lovers, frauds, villains, a little girl, a small cat, a mayor and his wife and other assorted characters whose life spans conform roughly to their billing: actors at the head of the cast live longest.Granting that end-of-the-world movies are not designed to test the intellect but, rather, to provide second-hand thrills of a visceral sort, \"The Towering Inferno\" must be everything its producer (Irwin Allen) and its two distribution companies (20th Century-Fox and Warner Bros., paired in a one-shot marriage-of-convenience to finance the film) could have possibly desired.The special effects are smashing, better than those in \"Earthquake\" even without the brain-bending Sen-surround effect of \"Earthquake.\" The technological work is old-fashioned Hollywood make-believe at its painstaking best.I have absolutely no idea which scenes of crematory horror were filmed in life-size studio mockups, in real locations or in miniatures — and I don't particularly want to know. The fun in a movie like this is in being fooled by the talents of the stuntmen, the production designers and especially by the editors, the men who fit all the pieces together without the seams showing.\"The Towering Inferno\" has an advantage over most movies of this sort in that it has a really classy cast. Though the actors are not required to do much except behave well according to type, their presence upgrades a secondary form of movie melodrama.They include Paul Newman (the architect), Faye Dunaway (the editor of a woman's magazine who goes through the entire fire in a dress so sheer but indestructible that it becomes an engineering feat in itself), Steve McQueen (the heroic fire chief), William Holden (the building's developer-builder), Richard Chamberlain (the man responsible for the faulty wiring who is also a cad to his wife, which may or may not be something to think about), Robert Vaughn (a United States Senator) and Robert Wagner (the building's public-relations man who gets somewhat more coverage than he dared hope for).Fred Astaire also shows up, benignly, as an old con artist out to bilk a rich, middle-aged woman played by Jennifer Jones, and O.J. Simpson is on hand as the building's security chief.Sterling Silliphant's screenplay, based on two different but similar novels (\"The Tower\" and \"The Glass Inferno\"), probably reads like a traffic control report, but it succeeds in presenting dozens of incidents without noticeable overlaps or collisions. The dialogue, especially at the beginning, is full of those portentous hints of things to come that make the audience giggle in nervous anticipation. \"You forget,\" someone says early on, \"the many modern safety devices we have today.\"John Guillermin directed the film, but it's difficult to know exactly what he might have done aside from suggesting a few line readings, perhaps. Movies like \"The Towering Inferno\" appear to have been less directed than physically constructed. This one is overwrought and silly in its personal drama, but the visual spectacle is first rate. You may not come out of the theater with any important ideas about American architecture or enterprise, but you will have had a vivid, completely safe nightmare.\n\nTHE TOWERING INFERNO, directed by John Guillermin; screenplay by Sterling Silliphant, based on the novels \"The Tower\" by Richard Martin Stern and \"The Glass Inferno\" by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson; produced by Irwin Allen; action sequences directed by Mr. Allen; director of photography, Fred Koanekamp; director of action-sequence photography, Joseph Biroc; editors, Harold F. Kress and Carl Kress; music, John Williams; distributed by 20th Century-Fox (domestic) and Warner Bros. (foreign). Running time: 160 minutes. At the National Theater, Broadway at 44th Street, and Trans-Lux East Theatre, Third Avenue at 58th Street. This film has been rated PG.Michael O'Hallorhan . . . . .
