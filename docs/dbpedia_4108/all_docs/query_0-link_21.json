Around 1967, a photograph of Blakely posed poolside in a black and white \"op art\" swimsuit was used by a local TV station, KELP-TV (now KVIA-TV), on its ID slide that ran during breaks between shows. Her blond \"California girl\" good looks were exactly what was in demand at the time, and she was easily able to secure sponsorship for a national modeling competition, which she won. The prize was a year's contract with the Ford Modeling Agency in New York. Her first appearance on a cover was for a hairstyle magazine.\n\nIn 1982, Blakely married media consultant and media crisis management expert Steve Jaffe, a former television producer.

She appeared in the 1974 films Report to the Commissioner and The Lords of Flatbush, then played the role of Iris Crawford in the 1975 gangster biopic Capone opposite Ben Gazzara.\n\nBlakely gained wide popularity and critical acclaim with her starring role in the 1976 television miniseries Rich Man, Poor Man. Her performance won that year's Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and earned a nominations for the Emmy Awards.

In 1981, she portrayed Eva Braun opposite Anthony Hopkins' Adolf Hitler in the television movie The Bunker.

In 1992 she starred with Barry Bostwick and E.G.Marshall in Russian Roulette.[3]\n\nBlakely was awarded the \"Best Actress\" award for her role in the film, \"Hungry Hearts\", from the 2002 California Independent Film Festival.\n\nBlakely shared the 2010 Best Female Performance Award-Short Film at the Beverly Hills Film Festival with Pauley Perrette, for their performances in \"To Comfort You\".\n\nThrough 2012, Blakely has continued to appear in guest star roles in numerous television series, and has starred in a number of short films and television films."
