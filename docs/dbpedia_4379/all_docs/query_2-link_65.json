Have an account? .\n\nTaylor Swift's biggest fans might not know about these popular songs that she wrote.\n\nShe helped write songs like \"This Is What You Came For\" and \"Beautiful Ghosts.\"\n\nSwift cowrote or was featured on a number of tracks including \"Safe and Sound\" and \"Both of Us.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor Swift wrote \"Better Man\" and sent it to the band Little Big Town.\n\nIn October of 2016, country band Little Big Town released their hit single \"Better Man,\" the first preview for the album \"Breaker.\" The song went on to garner critical acclaim, evening winning song of the year at the 2017 Country Music Awards.\n\nBut \"Better Man\" was originally written by Swift.\n\nKimberly Schlapman, one of Little Big Town's four members, told Taste of Country in 2016, \"She sent us the song … We were like, 'Wow! Taylor sent us a song. She's one of the best songwriters ever.'\"\n\nAccording to Schlapman, Swift thought the song would be great for the country group because of their four-part harmonies.\n\nFans today might be more aware of Swift's credit on the song now that she rerecorded it for herself on \"Red (Taylor's Version).\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiley Cyrus' \"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" was written by Swift.\n\nSwift may not have had her own show on Disney Channel, but her music served as a fan-favorite tune for \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\" (2009).\n\nAccording to the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, or ASCAP, Swift penned the song \"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home,\" performed by Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana in the film.\n\nSwift also made a cameo in the film and sang her song \"Crazier.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Best Days of Your Life\" was cowritten by Kellie Pickler and Swift.\n\nSwift and Kellie Pickler collaborated a few years back and cowrote the song \"Best Days of Your Life.\"\n\nPickler told The Boot, \"Taylor Swift and I actually wrote this song together while we were on tour with Brad Paisley. I had went through a really bad breakup a while back, so we wrote the song about the relationship that went sour.\"\n\nShe added, \"It's so funny, because Taylor always says that she has the 'Picture [to Burn]' song, and Carrie Underwood has 'Before He Cheats' ... and now 'Best Days of Your Life' — that's my kiss-off song!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwift also helped to write the song \"Babe\" for Sugarland.\n\nSwift worked with Train's Pat Monahan to cowrite the song \"Babe\" for the country band Sugarland.\n\nSugarland band member Jennifer Nettles told Billboard in 2018, \"[Taylor] reached out. We [have] obviously known each other for many years. When she was first getting started we had just had our first little EP out, called 'Premium Quality Tunes.'\"\n\nSwift is also featured on the track and in the song's music video.\n\n\"Babe\" is another track that Swift has since rerecorded for her own album, \"Red (Taylor's Version).\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwift collaborated with her then-boyfriend Calvin Harris to write \"This Is What You Came For.\"\n\nSwift hasn't just written country music — she also contributed to the hit single \"This Is What You Came For,\" performed by Calvin Harris and featuring Rihanna.\n\nAt first, fans were unsure whether or not Swift had actually written the song.\n\nIn July 2017, TMZ reported that Harris and Swift \"both knew the song would be a hit, but Taylor wrote it for Calvin and both agreed it was a bad idea to let the world know they collaborated as a couple ... it would overshadow the song.\"\n\nEventually, a representative for Swift confirmed with People that Swift wrote the song, stating, \"Taylor Swift wrote 'This Is What You Came For' under the pseudonym Nils Sjoberg.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe cowrote and performed on \"Both of Us\" with B.o.B.\n\nIn 2012, Swift pushed even more genre boundaries and collaborated with rapper B.o.B. to release \"Both of Us.\"\n\nPer Hip Hop DX, B.o.B. told B96's Julian On The Radio that his collaboration with Swift \"happened naturally.\"\n\nHe continued, \"It wasn't like the label was like, 'We need to get a Taylor Swift feature.' It was really like she hit me up and invited me to come on her set, and I couldn't make it because I wasn't in Atlanta at the time, but she actually arranged for me to come to Dallas and she brought me out and I played her the song, she liked it and it naturally happened.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwift helped to write Boys Like Girls' hit song \"Two Is Better Than One.\"\n\nRock band Boys Like Girls got the chance to collaborate with Swift for their 2009 release \"Two Is Better Than One.\" And she was prominently featured on the track.\n\nAccording to Billboard, the song helped to boost the band's already-successful summer and to display their \"softer side.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwift cowrote \"Safe and Sound\" with The Civil Wars for \"The Hunger Games\" soundtrack.\n\nSome fans might be familiar with Swift's contributions to \"The Hunger Games\" soundtrack, but if you're not also a fan of the franchise they might have slipped past you.\n\nSwift cowrote \"Safe and Sound\" with The Civil Wars, and she told MTV in 2012 that the song \"just ended up so organically coming together.\"\n\nShe continued, \"We wrote this song and recorded it one day. When we got the track back, I was so surprised by the restraint. He created this ethereal sound without making it this big battle anthem.\"\n\nThe group ended up winning a Grammy in 2013 for \"Safe and Sound.\"\n\nSwift's song \"Eyes Open\" was also featured on the movie's soundtrack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nTaylor Swift Music Miley Cyrus\n\nAdvertisement"
