        "text": "1890\n\nAlice Hamilton (1869-1970)\n\nAlice Hamilton was a doctor, worker advocate, peace ambassador, and the first female professor at Harvard Medical School. After studying at Fort Wayne College of Medicine, she lived in Hull House in Chicago, a place where immigrants were welcomed and supported. In her time there, she investigated typhus outbreaks. She also investigated the distribution of cocaine in the city while rehabilitating children affected, exposing the pharmacists distributing it, developing testing to tell the difference between synthetic and real drugs, and writing legislation to close loopholes in prosecution of distributors.\n\nHamilton became the top expert on lead poisoning in the US after investigating workplace safety for the US government. She’s considered to be one of the founding forces of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). After being invited to the International Congress on Occupational Accidents and Diseases in Brussels, she became concerned with political freedom in Europe and the rehabilitation of German citizens after World War I. As she became increasingly concerned about similarities she saw in the US under anti-communist McCarthyism views, she became outspoken enough for the FBI to open a profile on her. She was an educator, researcher, and activist well into her 80s. She lived to be 101.\n\nThe book, The Education of Alice Hamilton: From Fort Wayne to Harvard, was written by Dr. William “Bill” C. Ringenberg, Professor Emeritus of History at Taylor University; his son, Dr. Matthew C. Ringenberg, Chair and Associate Professor of Social Work at Valparaiso University; and Dr. Joseph Brain, Cecil and Phillip Drinker Professor of Environmental Physiology at the Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The book chronicles the Hamilton's life and work as one of America's earliest female scientists and scholars.\n\nThis bust of Hamilton is located in Euler Science Complex.\n\n1890\n\nBishop William Taylor (1821-1902)\n\nWith a zeal for preaching, a heart for the lost, and an entrepreneurial spirit, Bishop William Taylor from Rockbridge County, Virginia, was an evangelist, author, and missionary for more than 50 years who wholeheartedly believed in following God’s call—no matter the cost.\n\nIn 1843, he was admitted to the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Church. He started by ministering in California to the gold miners and frontiersmen, and eventually preaching around the world. He pioneered independent missions to Australia, India, Latin America, and Africa; and was the first American missionary bishop to Africa, a position for which he refused the accompanying $3,000 stipend. Taylor died in Palo Alto, California in 1902 after a lifetime of the Lord’s work. His grave overlooks the San Francisco Bay and his influence still echoes throughout the halls of Taylor University.\n\n1893\n\nThaddeus Reade (1846-1902)\n\nAs president from 1891-1902, Reade guided Taylor through the move from Fort Wayne to Upland in 1893, and he cultivated the campus' Christ-centered culture that still thrives today. He played a vital role in maintaining the financial stability of the school by personally funding all operations of the University. He made it his goal to make Taylor known for its students' dedication to Christ, and developed the foundation of Taylor’s Bible curriculum. In 1896 he published Samuel Morris (Prince Kaboo), a detailed biography of Samuel Morris’ incredible story, from which all profits not only provided Taylor the financial means to remain open, but also aided several hundred international students in attending and gaining an education at Taylor in the following years.\n\nReade—a loving and humorous, yet firm, man—died in 1902 at his sister’s home, located where Swallow Robin Hall stands today. His grave stands on Taylor’s campus as a monument to the man who kept Taylor going through very difficult times.\n\nReade Liberal Arts Center was constructed in his memory in 1966, and is one of the primary academic buildings on Taylor's campus today.\n\n1897\n\nBurt Ayres (1865-1958)\n\nBurt Ayres was a near-constant presence at Taylor in the first half of the 20th century. He served as dean and acting president multiple times, but he was, above all else, a teacher. He inspired a development of the life of the mind, diving deeply and with serious deliberation in the pursuit of truth.\n\nHis spirit of devotion and sacrifice inspired the school and served as the foundation of his life: a strong faith, deep trust in God, and an open hand held out to others.\n\nIn 1950, the Ayres Alumni Memorial Library was dedicated in his honor and his lifelong interest in Taylor's spiritual and educational achievements. Today, Ayres Hall houses Admissions, the President's Office, Psychology Department, and a classroom.\n\n1917\n\nSwallow Robin Hall, the oldest residence hall on campus, is designed by Samuel Plato (1882–1957), a notable African-American architect of the early 20th century. It has been extensively renovated since its construction, and it is the oldest and smallest of Taylor's eight residence halls.\n\nPlato began his work as an architect in Marion, Indiana, in 1902. During a period of time when the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana had record numbers of members, Plato successfully received critical acclaim for the homes, housing projects, churches, post offices, schools, banks, and other buildings he designed and constructed. He was the first African-American to be awarded a contract to build a US post office, eventually building 38 post offices across the country. At least eight of his buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places, including the J. Woodrow Wilson House, also known as the Hostess House, in Marion.\n\n2020\n\nLike the rest of the world, Taylor has to make significant changes to student life and academic calendars during the Covid-19 pandemic. When students return in the fall of 2020, creativity becomes the name of the game as everyone works hard to figure out what Taylor’s unique community culture would look like under pandemic conditions.\n\nThroughout the year, most classes continue as usual, although some adopt a hybrid in-person/virtual model. Some classes meet outside when the weather is warm.\n\nChapel maintains its Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule, with rotating groups divided by residence hall alternating attending chapel in Rediger Auditorium, Odle Gymnasium, or watching online.\n\nPictured above: the delayed commencement service for the class of 2020 on August 15, 2020."
