        "text": "PARIS – Anchoring the mixed 4 x 100m medley relay, Arkansas alum Anna Hopkin and the British team placed seventh in the final with a time of 3:44.31 at the La Defense Arena on Saturday.\n\nThe United States won the event in a world record time of 3:37.43, to just clip the previous record of 3:37.58 set by Great Britain in the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021. Hopkin anchored the British to Olympic gold that year and completed the world record performance.\n\nIn the Paris final, China finished second in an Asian record of 3:37.55 with Australia third in an Oceanic record of 3:38.76.\n\nGreat Britain swam with a foursome of Kathleen Dawson, James Wilby, Duncan Scott, and Hopkin, who split 53.02 on her freestyle leg.\n\nRacing in the 50m freestyle heats on Saturday, Hopkin advanced to the semifinal with a 24.72 in the prelims to tie for 15th place overall.\n\nIn the semifinal, Hopkin posted a time of 24.50 to finish fifth in her semifinal heat and placed 10th overall to secure one of two reserve spots in case someone doesn’t compete in the final."
