        "meta_description": "MicroRNAs are emerging as crucial regulators within the complex, dynamic environment of the synapse, and they offer a promising new avenue for the treatment of neurological disease. These small noncoding RNAs modify gene expression in several ways, including posttranscriptional modulation via binding to complementary and semicomplementary sites on target mRNAs. This rapid, finely tuned regulation of gene expression is essential to meet the dynamic demands of the synapse. Here, we provide a detailed review of the multifaceted world of synaptic microRNA regulation. We discuss the many mechanisms by which microRNAs regulate gene expression at the synapse, particularly in the context of neuronal plasticity. We also describe the various factors, such as age, sex, and neurological disease, that can influence microRNA expression and activity in neurons. In summary, microRNAs play a crucial role in the intricate and quickly changing functional requirements of the synapse, and context is essential in the study of microRNAs and their potential therapeutic applications.",
