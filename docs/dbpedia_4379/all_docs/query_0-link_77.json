        "text": "Taylor Swift's cancellation of three upcoming concerts in Vienna, Austria, following the foiling of an alleged terror plot comes five years after the singer penned an essay in which she shared that her \"biggest fear\" was an attack at her shows.\n\nSwift's Vienna, Austria, concerts on Aug. 8, 9 and 10 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion were canceled as of Aug. 7. Police announced earlier that day that two men had been arrested for allegedly planning terror attacks at major events in Vienna, including the \"Eras Tour.\"\n\nInitially, officials said the concerts would go on with additional security measures but later on Wednesday, news broke that the Vienna shows were being called off and ticket holders will be receiving refunds.\n\nTODAY.com reached out to Swift's team for comment but did not immediately hear back. The Instagram account @TaylorNation, which is affiliated with Swift's team, shared news of the cancellations but the pop star herself has not yet officially commented.\n\nWhat Swift previously wrote about fears surrounding keeping her fans safe at shows\n\nIn an essay the singer wrote for Elle in March 2019 after her \"Reputation\" tour ended, Swift opened up about her life in the spotlight. When writing about what her \"biggest fear\" is, she revealed that it was related to keeping her fans safe on tour.\n\n\"After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,\" she said. \"There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.\"\n\nA suicide bomber killed 22 people with an improvised explosive device on May 22, 2017, at Manchester Arena after an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. The Las Vegas shooting on October 1, 2017, saw more than 60 people killed when a gunman opened fire from a high-rise hotel on the crowd gathered below for the Route 91 Harvest music festival.\n\nIn her essay, Swift went on to say that her \"fear of violence has continued into my personal life.\"\n\nShe said she carries army-grade bandage dressing with her in case of gunshot or stab wounds and added that her experience with stalkers also caused her to \"start prepping for bad things.\"\n\n\"Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I’ve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity,\" she said. \"We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.\"\n\nSwift is currently on the international leg of the “Eras Tour.” She will next head to London for shows starting Aug. 15."
