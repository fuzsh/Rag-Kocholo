Turning to science, Diaz dedicates himself to creating technology that will make combat obsolete. Bankrolling the project is tycoon Henri Chimax (Jean Max). But, when World War II becomes imminent, Chimax sees an opportunity to bolster the French war effort -- and swipes Diaz's pacifist invention so it can be used by the army.\n\nExcerpt from MRQE located HERE\n\nIn the first third, Gance reprises his 1918 film of the same title, in the second third he carries the story forward, and the final third is something else again. Exploring the old Verdun battlefield in a thunderstorm, trench veteran Francen undergoes some unspecified transforming experience. Later, with world conflict about to break out again, he invokes the spirits of the war dead who, in an echo of the earlier picture, rise up and parade about reproachfully. A 'Universal Council' is convened, the war is called off, the dead return to their graves. Historically, these passages are an invaluable complement to Munich '38. As cinema, their unself-conscious absurdity and vulgarity (genuine disfigured veterans alongside extras in ghoul make-up) mark them as pure Gance.\n\nExcerpt from TimeOut located HERE\n\nImage : NOTE: The below Blu-ray captures were taken directly from the Blu-ray disc.\n\nThe 1938 version of Abel Gance's J'Accuse arrives on Blu-ray from Olive Films (you can see a review the 1919 version on Flicker Alley DVD HERE.) This is only single-layered and the presentation reflects the source used - with a few inconsistencies but density was not one of them. Actually, I found the weaknesses quite minor and I loved the thick, consistent grain. Vintage war footage is the most damaged (see below) but the rest of the feature looked impressive. Understandably, there is no real depth but this 1080P, in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, provides a strong presentation. Contrast is excellent and black levels are pitch. The Blu-ray is a fabulous way to see this amazing film in your home theater.\n\nThe BFI is dual-layered with a higher bitrate but most won't notice a demonstrative improvement. It does, marginally, look better in-motion and seems to export the grain more consistently when zoomed-in.\n\nCLICK EACH BLU-RAY CAPTURE TO SEE ALL IMAGES IN FULL 1920X1080 RESOLUTION\n\nAudio :\n\nAudio is transferred to a DTS-HD Master mono (original) track at 1835 kbps (24-bit). There is a score by Henri Verdun. The audio quality is, of course, at the mercy of the source - but the lossless rendering probably helped with any balance issues - improving depth in war-related aggression - and it sounded strong and fairly consistent to my ears. It is all predictably flat but very audible and supportive. There are optional English (yellow font - see samples) subtitles and m\n\ny Oppo has identified it as being a region 'A'-locked.\n\nBFI use a linear PCM 2.0 channel track - also 24-bit - and it sounds about the same to my ears. The score by Henri Verdun suits the film extremely well and the film's more aggressive audio requirements come through, probably, we produced. The BFI has optional English subtitles on their Region 'B'-locked Blu-ray disc.\n\nExtras :\n\nNo supplements - not even a trailer which is the bare-bones route that Olive are going with the majority of their releases.\n\nWhile the Olive provided nothing in the way of supplements, BFI add a new audio commentary by Paul Cuff giving important historical reference to the film and an analysis of Gance's work - highly educational. There is also a stills and special collections gallery and the package has a liner notes booklet with an illustrated booklet with full film credits, reviews and a new essay by Paul Cuff.\n\nOlive - Region 'A' - Blu-ray\n\nBFI - Region 'B' - Blu-ray\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nJ'Accuse is quite a bit different, and in many ways better, from Gance's 1919 version. A typically brilliant mis-en-scene from the director - this is a bona-fide masterpiece. It condemns war, and its effects, while floating tension and suspense throughout the narrative of another layer of the story. Wow. The bare-bones Olive Blu-ray provides a very pleasing HD presentation. The richness of the textures are impressive but the value here is primarily in the film. This is very strongly recommended!\n\nThe BFI Blu-ray eclipses the Olive in every area to varying degrees. It's the one to own and has our highest recommendation!"
