        "meta_description": "Flicker Alley was born out of a passion for cinematic history and a desire to bring filmmakers and films from out of the past to new audiences and renewed recognition. The company was founded in 2002 by Jeffery Masino who drew on a lifelong enthusiasm and fascination with silent film as well as classic, experimental and independent cinema. A goal of Flicker Alley is to contribute to the on-going interest in our film heritage through the creation of new, high-quality digital editions for broadcast, steaming and home video distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Flicker Alley brand has grown to enjoy national and international critical acclaim and is regularly featured in annual “Best Of” lists. The company is a three-time National Society of Film Critics Film Heritage Award recipient for publishing “rare early U.S. and foreign silent film” (2009, 2010, and 2011). The name “Flicker Alley” was the nickname of Cecil Court, London W.C.2., the business center of the British film industry during the silent film era.",
