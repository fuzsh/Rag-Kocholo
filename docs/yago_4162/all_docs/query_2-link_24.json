        "text": "Yesterday saw a rare screening of Kevin Brownlow's near-mythic five-and-a-half-hour reconstruction of Abel Gance's silent film Napoleon, a labour of love that has dominated more than 50 years of the historian's life, but has never been available on home video, and maybe never will be, due to ongoing and thorny contract wrangles with Francis Ford Coppola, who has his own version, which is incomplete, runs at the wrong speed and has a score written by his dad.\n\nBrownlow's version, by contrast, is scored by arguably the greatest of all silent film composers, Carl Davis, his collaborator on the legendary Thames Silents project in the 1980s, and the man responsible for two of the all-time great soundtracks: The Student Prince in…\n\nIn the early 1800s, Ludwig van Beethoven was writing his third symphony in honor of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was a paean to the (as Beethoven perceived him) military genius and liberator from Corsica, and it only became known as Eroica (as opposed to simply being named for Napoleon) in the wake of Napoleon's turn toward \"true imperialism\" after becoming officially the Emperor of France. Others alive at the time (and later, of course), viewed him as a tyrant, a villain. Before Hitler became a byword for evil, many Europeans used \"Napoleon\" as the point of comparison for all the evil of humanity. The truth of the matter is, as ever, in between the two, I am sure, but this film…\n\nA thick textbook on how to shoot a picture so much that it was just immediately scorched onto my brain. Most likely my favorite silent film, but it honestly feels disrespectful to limit it to only silent pictures because this is one of the best flicks, period. Images on top of images—there’s nothing better than that. There are so many great double exposures that make my eyes pop out like a Looney Toons character. You have some great double exposures in a particular storm sequence where we have the image of our scared passengers combined with the crashing waves. There’s another great storm sequence with just Napoleon on a boat attempting to sail in the storm, which is quite brilliant.…\n\nThe experience of watching an epic silent film like Napoleon for the first time is already a draining one in itself - something that I haven't felt coming towards me since I watched D. W. Griffith's Intolerance. Prior to having seen Napoleon, I had already experienced once Abel Gance through The Wheel although I was still unready for what I was set to experience again. Reportedly it was only the first of what was supposed to be a series of five films covering Napoleon and if it were the case, then such a journey would only be heavenly to all degrees from what I can only imagine. Even trying to write about something so ahead of its own time is…\n\nnietzsche says that monumental history -- the histories of genghis khan, jesus christ, mohammed, alexander, mao zedong, napoleon -- is the history which may “magnify the concept of man, giving it a more beautiful content\" and that one “learns from it that the greatness that once existed was in any event once possible and may thus be possible again\" -- a perennial greatness which is an inspirational reservoir for all models of greatness to come.\n\nthe presence of these figures always seems to supersede any historical details which may be known about them -- they do not exist for the historian's eye, but rather stride atop the course of history via their monumental stature in the same way that the…\n\nNapoleon is likely the most epic film ever made before the sweeping colour epics of Hollywood emerged. It is a grand crescendo of art and life. Everything about it is incredible as an achievement. It is a silent film of such epic proportions that you feel the weight of history, but it also has a personal intimacy that allows the film to meander on a romance for an hour. It is a wonder to behold, turning chaos into art and producing a film of emotion as well as a stunning technical showcase.\n\nNapoleon is heavy on foreshadowing. It is the depiction of a singular man, but every moment feels like it was destined. Napoleon is depicted a man who sought…"
