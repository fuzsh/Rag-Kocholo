        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Jane Wyman won an Oscar for her role as a deaf rape victim in the film \"Johnny Belinda\" and she will be remembered for her portrayal of a power-mad winery owner in TV's \"Falcon Crest.\"\n\nBut her greatest distinction may have been refusing to kiss and tell about her love life, most especially her marriage to Ronald Reagan.\n\nWyman died early Monday at her Palm Springs home, son Michael Reagan said. Wyman's age was listed as 93 in several reference books, but other sources, and the official family Web site, say she was 90.\n\n\"I have lost a loving mother, my children Cameron and Ashley have lost a loving grandmother, my wife Colleen has lost a loving friend she called Mom and Hollywood has lost the classiest lady to ever grace the silver screen,\" Reagan said in a statement.\n\nWyman's film career started in the 1930s and stretched from the \"Gold Diggers of 1937\" to 1969's \"How to Commit Marriage,\" co-starring Bob Hope and Jackie Gleason. From 1981 to 1990 she played Angela Channing, a Napa Valley vintner who maintained her grip with a steely will on CBS' \"Falcon Crest.\"\n\nHer marriage in 1940 to fellow Warner Bros. contract player Ronald Reagan was celebrated in the fan magazines as one of Hollywood's ideal unions. While he was in uniform during World War II, her career ascended, signaled by her 1946 Oscar nomination for \"The Yearling.\"\n\nShe and Reagan divorced in 1948, the year she won an Oscar for \"Johnny Belinda.\"\n\nWarner Bros. signed Wyman to a long-term contract in 1936, and the studio was notorious for typecasting its contract players.\n\nWyman suffered that fate. She recalled: \"For 10 years I was the wisecracking lady reporter who stormed the city desk snapping, 'Stop the presses! I've got a story that will break this town wide open!' \"\n\nIn 1937, Wyman married a manufacturer of children's clothes, Myron Futterman, in New Orleans. She divorced him in 1938, declaring she wanted children and he did not.\n\nThe actress became entranced by Reagan, a handsome former sportscaster who was a newcomer to the Warner lot. She finagled a date with him, and romance ensued.\n\nAfter returning from a personal appearance tour with columnist Louella Parsons, they were married on Jan. 26, 1940. The following year she gave birth to a daughter, Maureen. They later adopted a son, Michael. They also had a daughter who was born several months premature in June 1947 and died a day later.\n\nTheir daughter, Maureen, died of cancer in August 2001.\n\nWyman escaped B-pictures by persuading Jack Warner to loan her to Paramount for \"The Lost Weekend.\" The film won the Academy Award for 1945 and led to another loanout -- to MGM for \"The Yearling.\"\n\nAfter 40 films at Warner Bros., Wyman achieved her first acting challenge with \"Johnny Belinda.\"\n\nWhen Jack Warner saw a rough cut of the film, he ranted to the director: \"We invented talking pictures, and you make a picture about a deaf and dumb girl!\" He changed his attitude when \"Johnny Belinda\" received 12 Academy Award nominations and the Oscar for Jane Wyman."
