I hadn't heard that before. She was famous for the \"Wyman Weepies\" and made many tear-jerking films after Johnny Belinda, including Magnificent Obsession, All That Heaven Allows (one of my favourites), The Blue Veil (which was used in Falcon Crest), Miracle In The Rain and even Pollyanna is a bit of a weepy. She always did manage to do a range of film roles and did lots of light comedy in her 1950s and 1960s films and in her TV series The Jane Wyman Theatre, she took on a lot of different dramatic roles. I think was Falcon Crest did for her was allow her to play a more ruthless character who was a bit of a baddie which wasn't a role we had seen from her in her film career.\n\nReally?

They would have given another meaning to the film\n\nShe herself recognized the New York Times\n\n\"JAME WYMAN: 'I ALWAYS DID FOUR-HANDKERCHIEF ROLES. UNTIL NOW.'\"\n\nAnd to many on the street who said they remembered her so well, she was invariably mistaken for another actress, Jane Wyatt.\n\nShe was a good professional and a good actress but not a great star.\n\nThe proof is that although she had partners like Gregory Peck, Charton Heston and Rock Hudson, but when they were starting her career. She was never the partner of an established male star\n\nI don't know if you know this website. I think she's good even though she only talks about her movie career\n\njane-wyman.com\n\nThis domain may be for sale!\n\nJane was good doing the two step dance and not bad at singing but I can't visualise Angie doing either. She was just too busy meddling and telling others off, to have the time.\n\nShe was a great singer, I have a recording of her singing a duet with Danny Kaye and she is as good as any Hollywood actress, Judy Garland included.\n\nCan you imagine Angela in a showdown with Gustav Riebmann suddenly breaking into a song and shimmering around his office? It would have killed the credibility of the show even more than Bobby returning from the dead in Dallas.\n\nTalking of Dallas, Howard Keel managed to sing a verse of a song to Ellie and even though it was a light-hearted romantic moment, I didn't feel that worked either.\n\nShe was a great singer, I have a recording of her singing a duet with Danny Kaye and she is as good as any Hollywood actress, Judy Garland included.\n\nCan you imagine Angela in a showdown with Gustav Riebmann suddenly breaking into a song and shimmering around his office?

And comparing her to Judy is sacrilege.\n\nAs for singing, Richard used to hum on many occasions. Much to the concern of producer Victoria La Fortune, who indicated \"Okay, I have to license that piece of music,\" she described a typical challenge she was faced with when David spontaneously decided again to hum or sing in a scene.“What was he singing?!” She would wonder Occasionally, she later found out he had just made it up so legal clearance was not necessary!\n\nAnd she was very good. We have also seen him dance with Maggie at dinner on the beach or at night in Casablanca very romantic or even tap dance when Maggie has a problem with alcoholism.\n\nSo a romantic or lighthearted dance with Stavros would have been great.\n\nJane was good doing the two step dance and not bad at singing but I can't visualise Angie doing either. She was just too busy meddling and telling others off, to have the time.\n\nIt was very serious as the actress who dubbed it in Spanish commented.\n\nShe had a sense of humor but hurtful she Very rigid always obsessed by the script and the marks (which indicate the positions of the actors when they shoot)\n\nAnd as someone else commented she was \"a cold control freak with no sense of humor. She was a talented actress, but, apparently, not likable.\"\n\nMargaret Ladd commented that Jane was very distant. And she always stayed away from the other actors.\n\nThat's why we don't imagine her dancing with Peter.\n\nIn this scene where she pretends to be a flirt to make her ex-husband jealous, she looks very forced and unnatural.\n\nThe movie was a remark of a movie with Cary Grant and Irenne Dunne.\n\nVery recently I got complete seasons 4.5.6.7.8 and 9 of Falcon Crest\n\nIt surprises me that fans of Jane Wyman do not remember that in 5.10 Inconceivable affairs. The night before the wedding Angela and Peter dance together.\n\nANGELA\n\nIt's after midnight. What are you doing here, Peter?\n\nPETER\n\nIt is a tradition in my country for the bride and groom to have one last dance together before they are married.\n\nANGELA\n\nIn this country, it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride on the day of the wedding. Go back to your boat!\n\nShe turns and starts up the stairs. Peter moves closer.\n\nPETER\n\nIf you don't dance with me, Angela, my friend and I will sing all night.\n\nAttachments\n\nAngela Peter.jpg\n\nAnd to many on the street who said they remembered her so well, she was invariably mistaken for another actress, Jane Wyatt.\n\nWhat think Chris Pine, Chris Evans, Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth etc. or Dermot Mulroney and Dylan McDermott about that?\n\nIn the 1950s Jane Wyatt's film career was mostly dead. But she was the star of the TV show Father Knows Best (1954-60) - of course more people know someone from a hit TV show than from films. But I doubt many people remembered Wyatt a few years after her TV series was cancelled. That you use that as an argument against Wyman's status as a recognizable actress in the 1950s (or later) is ludicrous because Jane Wyatt's stardom was very limited.\n\nWhat think Chris Pine, Chris Evans, Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth etc. or Dermot Mulroney and Dylan McDermott about that?\n\nIn the 1950s Jane Wyatt's film career was mostly dead.

UNTIL NOW.'\n\nAs for what was still going on when Falcon Crest Michael Reagan told TJP\n\nBy the way, Jane Wyatt became super popular when she played Spock's mother in Star Trek. I also loved Star Trek\n\nAgain, this is nonsense. She was widely acknowledged in Hollywood as being a great singer. In Jane Wyman: A Biography by Joe Morella and Edward Epstein, they described a Hollywood party at which Judy Garland sang a song and no other actress was brave enough to follow her, other than Jane Wyman. After Jane finished singing, guests commented that she sang every bit as well as Ms Garland. Jane also released several records, mostly duets but also some solos, which entered the music charts.\n\nJudy had a life full of problems, alcohol, amphetamines, her weight-loss cures.\n\nThat they ruined her career and her voice.\n\nWhat year was the party? Some bad times of Judy\n\nAs for the comment, it would be gossip. Who said that all the guests, some.\n\nJudy had a life full of problems, alcohol, amphetamines, her weight-loss cures.\n\nThat they ruined her career and her voice.\n\nWhat year was the party?\n\nI can't be bothered to look it up because you seem more interested in denigrating Jane Wyman than you are in facts.\n\nEdit:\n\nOK, I've relented and looked it up, it was 1943. Here is a paragraph from the book:\n\nThe Reagans went to a party one night attended by Hope, his wife, Dolores, and others, including Judy Garland. Garland sang, and then Wyman sang, indicating no reluctance to be compared to the girl considered by her peers to be one of the most talented pop singers of her era. The comparison was very favourable for Wyman. Judy had been a regular on Hope’s radio program; when Hope heard Wyman sing, he invited her to do the program as well. Jane sang a novelty song on the Hope show, “Fuddy Duddy Watchmaker\", and did a comedy routine with Hope. As a result of her performance, radio offers started coming in and Warner Bros. realized Jane might have a career in that medium or, even more threatening, a lucrative contract offer from a rival studio. The events placed Jane in a good bargaining position when her seven-year contract expired, and Warners, of course, was anxious to renew.\n\nAs I said previously, your suggestion that Jane \"wasn't a great singer\", is total rubbish."
