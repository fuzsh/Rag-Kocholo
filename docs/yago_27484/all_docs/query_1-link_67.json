        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Jane Wyman, the Academy Award-winning actress whose long and distinguished film and television career was nearly overshadowed by her real-life role as the first wife of actor-turned-politician Ronald Reagan, died Monday. She gave her age as 90, but other biographical sources say she was 93.\n\nWyman died at her desert home in Rancho Mirage of age-related causes, said Virginia Zamboni, a longtime friend.\n\nWyman”s son, radio personality Michael Reagan, said in a statement Monday: “I have lost a loving mother, my children Cameron and Ashley have lost a loving grandmother, my wife Colleen has lost a loving friend she called Mom and Hollywood has lost the classiest lady to ever grace the silver screen.”\n\n”Johnny Belinda” Oscar|\n\nAfter arriving in Hollywood from St. Louis in the mid-1930s, Wyman learned her craft as a contract player before getting a crack at the major roles that would secure her reputation as a star. She won an Oscar playing a deaf-mute rape victim in 1948”s “Johnny Belinda” and was nominated for her performances in “The Yearling” (1946), “The Blue Veil” (1951) and “Magnificent Obsession” (1954).\n\nIn the 1950s, the early days of television, she staked out a career in that medium with her own half-hour dramatic anthology show. And years after her film career waned, she became familiar to millions more television viewers as the matriarch-you-love-to-hate in the long-running 1980s nighttime soap opera “Falcon Crest.”\n\nStill, hardly ever was Wyman”s name mentioned in print without also referring to the second of her three husbands.\n\nAt the time they met in 1938, Reagan was a fellow actor under contract with Warner Bros. After a well-publicized courtship, they wed on Jan. 26, 1940 .\n\nWyman bore the couple two daughters, one of whom died after a premature birth and the other, Maureen Reagan, who died of melanoma in 2001 at 60. They also adopted their son Michael before divorcing in 1948.\n\nReagan, who by then was married to Nancy Davis and had two more children, was the first American president to have been divorced. That bestowed on Wyman the dubious honor of being the first ex-wife of an American president.\n\nMuch to Wyman”s irritation, she was the subject of constant questioning about Reagan, despite her well-known refusal to speak of him because she considered it “bad taste to talk about ex-husbands and ex-wives.” She was known to get up and leave an interview if a writer brought up his name.\n\n“I made 86 films and 350 television shows,” she explained to Newsday in 1989. “I”ve been in this business 54 years.”\n\nRarely mentioned Reagan|\n\nRarely did she break her silence about her former husband, with the exception of a brief statement issued after his death on June 5, 2004: “America has lost a great president and a great, kind and gentle man.”\n\nShe met Reagan playing his girlfriend in “Brother Rat” in 1938 and appeared with him in the 1940 sequel, “Brother Rat and a Baby,” and two other films, “Tugboat Annie Sails Again” and “An Angel From Texas” (both 1940). They had uncredited bit parts playing themselves in “It”s a Great Feeling,” which was released after their separation.\n\nDuring divorce proceedings — Wyman, who under the laws then was obligated to give cause for their separation — said she didn”t share Reagan”s interest in politics and was bored by the constant talk about it. The divorce came at a time when her career was soaring and his was declining. She also had been linked with “Johnny Belinda” costar Lew Ayres, and it is unclear whether Reagan was referring to the film or to Ayres when he wryly commented at the time, “I think I”ll name ”Johnny Belinda” as co-respondent.””\n\nReagan”s 1990 autobiography, “An American Life,” mentions his marriage to Wyman only to say that it had produced “two wonderful children” but that it “didn”t work out.”\n\nOld Hollywood|\n\nWith her brown eyes, turned-up nose and signature dark hairdo — a pageboy with bangs — Wyman was a familiar face to millions of fans and a prominent member of Old Hollywood. Her co-stars ranged from Gregory Peck in “The Yearling” to the young Rock Hudson, whose first starring role was opposite Wyman in “Magnificent Obsession.” She also starred with Hudson in “All That Heaven Allows,” which was the inspiration for writer-director Todd Haynes” “Far From Heaven” in 2002.\n\nHer other starring roles included the 1953 screen version of Edna Ferber”s best-selling novel “So Big,” opposite Sterling Hayden, and “Miracle in the Rain,” a 1956 World War II love story with Van Johnson. She was the stern aunt won over by Hayley Mills in 1960”s “Pollyanna.”\n\nPlayed power broker|\n\nWyman”s last major film was with Bob Hope and Jackie Gleason in “How to Commit Marriage” in 1969. The remainder of her acting career was primarily in television, highlighted by her starring role on “Falcon Crest” on CBS. The role gave Wyman an opportunity to break away from her nice-girl image and play a female power broker intent on ruling over her family of winemakers at whatever cost.\n\nSarah Jane Mayfield Fulks was born in St. Joseph, Mo. Her father died when she was young, and she was raised by her mother, who had ambitions for her daughter to be in Hollywood. Wyman attended the University of Missouri and for a time was a radio singer under the name of Jane Durrell.\n\nWyman got her start in films in the chorus of a 1932 Busby Berkeley movie beside other then-unknowns including Betty Grable and Paulette Goddard.\n\nAfter a string of films in which she was “third from the right in the front row of the chorus,” she graduated to B movies playing, as Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper once said, “brassy dames whose most incisive piece of repartee was, ”Oh, yeah?”” She changed her name to Wyman when she went under contract at Warner Bros. in 1936.\n\nLike many actresses of the day, the light-haired Wyman at first bleached her hair Jean Harlow blond but eventually dyed it dark brown in order to be taken more seriously. She finally got noticed by Billy Wilder, who cast her opposite Ray Milland in the melodrama “The Lost Weekend” (1945), about a would-be writer on a boozy weekend in New York City. At last she had gotten the kind of role she had always wanted, and she didn”t waste her opportunity. The film won the Best Picture Oscar in 1946.\n\nHer next major role was as Orry Baxter, the stern mother in “The Yearling,” which earned her an Oscar nomination and completed her transformation into serious actress and leading lady.\n\n“Mother”s career consisted mostly of one depressingly serious part after another,” Maureen Reagan wryly wrote in her 1989 memoir, “First Father, First Daughter.”\n\nIn 1948, Wyman was cast in “Johnny Belinda” as a deaf-mute farm girl who is raped. To help her better play her character, she plugged her ears during filming, and at home she rarely spoke, preferring to use sign language, according to her son”s 1988 memoir, “On the Outside Looking In.”\n\n“I learned the all-important thing: A deaf person hears with her eyes, just as a blind person sees with his ears,” Wyman told Hopper.\n\nAlt hough not everyone liked the movie — film historian and essayist David Thomson has called it an “evasive, slick sob story” and “uncut corn” — her performance universally was praised. The New York Post called it “surpassingly beautiful in its slow, luminous awakening of joy and understanding,” and even Thomson said that Wyman”s performance and her “soulful, wide-eyed face” established her as a star of women”s pictures.\n\n(End optional trim)\n\nWyman was married to businessman Myron Futterman in the 1930s. After her divorce from Reagan, she twice married musician and vocal coach Fred Karger, divorcing him the final time in 1965.\n\nWhen not acting, Wyman painted, mostly landscapes. F or many years she was active in the Arthritis Foundation for which she served as a national chairwoman . In 1977, she became the second recipient of the Charles B. Harding award, the highest national award given by the Arthritis Foundation. The foundation”s Southern California chapter also created the Jane Wyman Humanitarian Award in her honor.\n\nWyman, a devout Catholic convert and supporter of the Catholic Church, also was a strong supporter of Hollywood”s Covenant House and Our Lady of Angels Monastery.\n\nSurvivors include her son, Michael Reagan, and three grandchildren."
