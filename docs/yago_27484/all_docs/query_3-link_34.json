Wyman next starred in \"Cheyenne\" and \"Magic Town.\" Her biggest critical success came in 1948, when she starred as deaf-mute rape victim Belinda MacDonald in \"Johnny Belinda,\" based on the eponymous stage play. A huge hit, the film earned Wyman the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nFurther Film Career\n\nFollowing her success with \"Johnny Belinda,\" Wyman starred in the comedies \"A Kiss in the Dark\" and \"The Lady Takes a Sailor,\" and then in Alfred Hitchcock's thriller \"Stage Fright.\" Her subsequent credits included \"The Glass Menagerie,\" \"Three Guys Named Mike,\" \"Here Comes the Groom,\" and \"The Blue Veil,\" which garnered Wyman her third Academy Award nomination. She went on to star in \"The Story of Will Rogers,\" \"Just for You,\" \"Let's Do it Again!,\" and \"So Big.\"\n\nReturning to Universal in 1954, Wyman had one of her greatest hits with Douglas Sirk's romantic melodrama \"Magnificent Obsession,\" in which she starred opposite Rock Hudson as a blinded widow. For her performance, she received her fourth and final Academy Award nomination. In 1955, Wyman and Hudson reunited with Sirk to play romantic partners in the director's \"All That Heaven Allows.\" After this, Wyman starred in \"Lucy Gallant,\" \"Miracle in the Rain,\" and \"Holiday for Lovers.\" She had her final decade on film in the 60s, appearing in \"Pollyanna,\" \"Bon Voyage!,\" and \"How to Commit Marriage.\"\n\nTelevision Career\n\nIn 1955, Wyman began her own television series, \"Jane Wyman Presents,\" which she hosted and often acted on. After the show ended in 1958, she made guest appearances on such series as \"Wagon Train,\" \"Startime,\" \"Checkmate,\" \"The Investigators,\" and \"Insight.\" In 1971, Wyman starred in the television film \"The Failing of Raymond\"; at the end of the decade, she starred in another television film, \"The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel.\" Wyman had her biggest and most famous television role from 1981 to 1990, when she starred as ruthless California matriarch Angela Channing on the primetime soap opera \"Falcon Crest.\" For her work on the series, she won a Golden Globe Award in 1984.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n\nWyman was married four times and divorced five times. Her first husband was salesman Ernest Wyman, whom she wed in 1933; they divorced two years later. Next, in 1937, Wyman married dress manufacturer Myron Futterman. The couple split after just three months and divorced in 1938. Wyman's most publicized marriage was to actor Ronald Reagan, to whom she was wed from 1940 to 1949. Together, they had three children named Maureen, Michael, and Christine, the lattermost of whom passed away shortly after her birth. Wyman's fourth and final husband was music director and composer Frederick Karger. The two married in 1952 and divorced in 1955; they later married again in 1961 before divorcing for a second time in 1965.\n\nWyman became something of a recluse during the later years of her life, and scarcely made public appearances due in part to her arthritis and diabetes. In September of 2007, she passed away at her home in Rancho Mirage, California at the age of 90."
