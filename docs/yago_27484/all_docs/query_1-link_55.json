        "text": "Jane Wyman (January 5, 1917 â€“ September 10, 2007) was an American actress. She began her film career in the 1930s, and was a prolific performer for two decades. She received an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Johnny Belinda (1948), and later achieved success during the 1980s for her leading role in the television series Falcon Crest.\n\nWyman was the first wife of Ronald Reagan, marrying him in 1940 and divorcing him in 1948, long before he became U.S. president or ran for any public office. To date, she is the only woman to have been an ex-wife of a U.S. president.\n\nWyman was born Sarah Jane Mayfield in St. Joseph, Missouri. Although her birthdate has been widely reported for many years as January 4, 1914, research by biographers and genealogists indicates that she was born on January 5, 1917. The most likely reason for the 1914 date is that she added to her age when beginning her career as a minor in order to work legally. She may have changed her January 5 birthdate to January 4 to coincide with that of her daughter Maureen Reagan. After Wyman's death, a release posted on her official website confirmed these details."
