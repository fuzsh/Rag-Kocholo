        "text": "One doesn’t often imagine Indiana as being a setting for a destination wedding, yet up until the 1940s, people flocked to Crown Point, Valparaiso, Jeffersonville and Lawrenceburg like they were going to Las Vegas for a quickie wedding.\n\nBut why Indiana?\n\nFrom 1915 to 1940, Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky had stringent marriage laws later known as \"gin marriage\" laws, which required a five-day waiting period between obtaining a license and the wedding. These laws came from the Prohibition Era fear that couples were getting married while under hazy alcoholic stupors.\n\nBut rather than sober up and contemplate marriage rationally, couples instead traveled to Indiana in droves to get hitched. Indiana marriage laws at the time were not only fuzzy, they were also virtually nonexistent.\n\nLonely heart: Woman in 1914 seeks 'Nice, Lovin' Husband' (who must meet 10 criteria)\n\nTowns were referred to as “Gretna Greens” in reference to the Scottish town near the English border, where young British couples would often run away to elope.\n\nA justice of the peace or “marrying squire” was available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and took all manner of payment from peaches, livestock and, of course, cash. Fees were typically $2, but an ornate marriage certificate could set a couple back about $15. And the justices never had to report their income from the fees to the state. Many of these marriage mills were a veritable one-stop shop, offering rings, flowers and clothes for sale at all hours of the day for those couples who opted for the spur-of-the-moment nuptials.\n\nNorthwest Indiana counties benefited from the close proximity to Chicago, where a quick trip by the rich and famous was almost routine. Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman married in Crown Point as did comedian Red Skelton, football star Red Grange and cowboy actor Tom Mix.\n\nThousands of onlookers gathered outside the offices of Judge Howard Kemp in 1923 to get a glimpse of silent film star Rudolph Valentino, who registered under the name Rudolph Gugliema (according to The Hammond Times), and his bride, Winifred Shaughnessy, known by her stage name as Natacha Rambova.\n\nThe famous couple had been married in Mexico in 1922. However, by California law, Valentino had not been divorced for a full year from his first wife, before wedding Shaughnessy. So, they made it legitimate in Indiana.\n\nAn estimated 175,000 couples traveled to Crown Point to exchange their \"I do’s\" and an estimated $300,000 was pumped into the local economy each year.\n\nFive miles north of Crown Point, Justice of the Peace Clarence Kitchell came up with the novel idea of a combination marrying parlor and filling station. His roadside sign read “Stop and Save Now. Legal Marriages. We Marry Others — Why Not You?”\n\nCivic groups and church leaders blamed the marriage mills for juvenile delinquency and welfare problems.\n\nThe marriage criteria for Indiana was simple; males had to be 21 and females 18. If they had parental consent, the males could marry at 18 and the females 16. Sobriety was mandatory. Judge Kemp had a unique method in determining the couple’s sobriety, “if a couple isn’t too drunk to walk upstairs,” he claimed, “they aren’t really drunk at all.”\n\nRetro Indy: Vintage life hacks your grandma might have used\n\nMeanwhile in Southern Indiana\n\nJeffersonville magistrates employed “touts” or “steerers” to hang around the courthouse or meet trains, boats and trolley cars running between Louisville and Jeffersonville. Each would tout the benefits and perks of their respective employer and steer them in for a no-strings-attached marriage ceremony.\n\nIn Lawrenceburg, a good Saturday was 30 weddings at $10 each. Prices rose after 5 p.m. \"Things get a little more complicated at night and you have to charge for all the trouble they put you to,\" Dearborn County Clerk Chester E. Guard told The Indianapolis Star.\n\nCapitalizing on the marriage mill business across the river, a Louisville jeweler penned a popular jingle:\n\nSquire Hause, the marrying magistrate of Jeffersonville, Indiana, would perform ceremonies from his bed because of illness and around the year 1900 concocted the idea of the runner system. The runner rode the ferry between Jeffersonville and Louisville spotting lovestruck couples and led them to Hause to be married.\n\nRetro Indy: That time a dancer and Indy's mayor went at it\n\n'The greatest single cause of divorce is marriage'\n\nIllinois flat-out condemned the Crown Point marriage mills.\n\nIn 1920, Cook County (Illinois) Judge Kickham Scanlan declared that one-third of applicants for divorce that came before him testified that they were married in Crown Point. When it came time to get an annulment or divorce, the young couples often admitted that they spent time in the local taverns before the wedding ceremony.\n\n\"How a great percentage of unhappily married couples start their marital career in the Indiana town,\" Scanlan said. \"I don't know that there is anything radically wrong with Crown Point, but there is no disputing the fact that its weddings usually result in divorces.\"\n\nChicago newspapers ran multiday series on the dangers of Indiana marriage mills and divorce rates. But they really focused on the association of these marriage mills with alcohol and venereal disease. People didn’t seem to be as embarrassed by the fact that they got married while intoxicated, but even a hint that “those kinds of people” might also have syphilis added a whole new level embarrassment to the mix.\n\nMarriage mills were dealt a damaging blow on Jan. 11, 1938, when the Indiana State Supreme Court upheld an 1852 statute forbidding county clerks to issue marriage licenses to women who are not residents of the county in which the license is issued. The banner headline on the Chicago Tribune trumpeted “KILL INDIANA MARRIAGE MILLS.” This move lead some clerks to take a \"So you live in this county? Wink-wink” attitude. But license applications plummeted dramatically.\n\nGov. Clifford Townsend made a further push for their abolishment when he stated, “Our state should not be a party to Gretna Green marriages.” In 1939, the General Assembly passed the Premarital Health Examination Law, which required a blood test for syphilis before a marriage license could be issued.\n\nTo slow the process, those results were mailed, but again, those quick-thinking clerks found ways to utilize “special delivery” for rapid-mail delivery. While “quickie marriages” dwindled, they didn’t stop until Gov. George Craig wanted a foolproof waiting period. On Jan. 1, 1958, a mandatory three-day waiting period following the drug test went into effect in Indiana. In 1964, Cassius Clay and 24-year-old Sonji Roi of Gary obtained a marriage license in Crown Point. The three-day waiting period was waived for the couple since they had the results of blood tests taken in Miami, Florida.\n\nCrown Point embraces its history as a marriage mill.\n\nOn the second Friday of every June, the Lake Court House Foundation holds a Marriage Mill ceremony that highlights Lake County’s history as the “Las Vegas of the Midwest.” The courthouse itself was saved from the wrecking ball in the 1970s and has been restored.\n\nCouples apply for the Marriage Mill ceremony, which is free, said Carrie Napoleon, managing director of the Lake Court House Foundation.\n\n\"We try and select a couple that captures or appreciates the spirit of the building and its history,\" she said. \"Once our selected couple is wed, the judge performs a vow renewal ceremony for any couple in the audience wishing to do so.”"
