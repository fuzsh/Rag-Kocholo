        "text": "Have a look at this Facts Verse video about the life and times of Jane, with Mr. President Ronald Reagan. 'Ups and downs we've had a few but here we go again.'\n\nMeredith Braxton meets Angela, in a park. Progress is expected on the nemesis of Falcon Crest, Richard. Meredith says, (a scene from season 6, 1986-’87):\n\n“Life has two choices Mrs. Channing. Slow seduction or a quick strike. I’m doing what I do best!”\n\nAngela: “Well, you’re quite a philosopher Miss. Braxton.”\n\nMeredith: “You’re quite something yourself Mrs. Channing.”\n\nAngela: “Don’t you ever forget it!”\n\nIt was Nancy Reagan who told about Jane's suicide attempt in her autograph\n\nRonald Reagan and Jane Wyman divorced due to Wyman's affair with a costar Lew Ayres, her partner in Belinda. After learning of the affair, Reagan was willing to accept her back from her, but the divorce proceeded at Wyman's request.\n\nRonald Reagan once boasted that he and Wyman would end their days together, but it didn't take long after the wedding vows were exchanged in 1940 for things to go awry. After testifying before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, Reagan returned home to find that Wyman had packed his belongings to her and placed them in her car.\n\nAfter Wyman had disclosed the details of her affair de ella with Lew Ayres, her costar de ella in “Johnny Belinda,” Reagan told the press that he knew his wife de ella needed to have a fling and he intended for her to have it. Despite his leniency and hope for reconciliation, the divorce came in 1948.\n\nShe filed for divorce in 1948, and it was granted in 1949. According to actress Patricia Neal, Reagan was deeply hurt.\n\n\"It was, you know, just terrible because I was so unhappy,\" she said in an interview. \"He was alone in an apartment. He was heartbroken. He really was, because he didn't want to divorce her. But Jane wanted it.\n\nRonald did better with Nancy\n\nRonald Reagan and Jane Wyman respected each other so much that they never discussed their marriage with others once they got divorced so anything you see written about it is likely to be pure speculation. The claim that Jane committed suicide was first made in the book Reagan: An American Journey by Bob Spitz but it was never substantiated. I think the video is based on the contents of the book.\n\nThe reasons for their divorce is disputed but the facts that are known include that Jane filed for divorce 3 months after their daughter Christine died. After losing their child, Jane was depressed and Ronnie offered her next to no support and instead spent most of his time at being the president of the Screen Actors Guild. Ronnie didn't want to get divorced but Jane wanted a more supportive husband.\n\nRonald Reagan and Jane Wyman respected each other so much that they never discussed their marriage with others once they got divorced so anything you see written about it is likely to be pure speculation.

Ronnie didn't want to get divorced but Jane wanted a more supportive husband.\n\nIn this 2010 video David talks about Falcon Crest, Jane Wyman Susan Sullivan. Of the last seasons how I turned down the role of Cary Edwing\n\nTwo darts even though he worked eight years with Jane he didn't even know her political ideas. A professional relationship\n\nHe himself comments that Nancy did take care of Ronald\n\nDavid is a Democrat so his comment about Nancy is not ideological.\n\nThis is the report from Hello on the last episode of Falcon Crest, Jane looks very happy shaking hands with Lance\n\nRichard turns his back on Jane. It is the last scene of the solos that they shot. In David's many interviews and poscards. He comments that he continues to have contact with him in the rest of the cast.\n\nThat is why Reagan was not harmed by the divorce, everyone understood it\n\nJane died 17 years after finishing Falcon Crest and never saw another cast member again.\n\nAttachments\n\nFalcon Crest last episode.jpeg\n\nAssuming he wasn't the President, I think she would have been happy for him but wouldn't really be to bothered either way as she had moved on from him and re-married and got divorced again.\n\nJane behaved very badly with Ronald. She put his suitcases in the car.She was seen with her partner in Belinda even though they were not divorced.\n\nHe had a very bad time with his divorce\n\nJane was very diva. In those years she had won an Oscar. she was the star\n\nThen he was governor of California for eight years and president of the United States for two terms.\n\nBy the way, apparently Jane was not very enthusiastic about Ronnie's political career.\n\nAs commented son Michael\n\n\"Michael says Jane Wyman resented his de ella and Maureen's involvement in their father's political campaigns. It was her practice de ella to read her will to them each year, and once she called them over to say she had deleted them from it.\n\n\"You're so close to them {the Reagans}, why don't you just have them put you in their will?\" she told them. \"He must be a billionaire by now.\"\n\nWhen he mentioned that to his father, he says Reagan \"shook his head sadly and said, 'You and Maureen are not in our will because I thought you were in your mother's.' \"\n\nWow Jane was just like Angela dishering her relatives\n\nJane herself acknowledged that if she was offered the role of Angela it was because Ronald was the president of the United States\n\nIn this report from the magazine Lecturas Jane says\n\nJANE WYMAN: \"I KNOW THE PRODUCERS HIRE ME BECAUSE I WAS MARRIED TO REAGAN\"\n\nThe actress, who now stars in the television series \"Falcon crest\", remained completely forgotten for thirteen years. Just when her ex-husband rose to the presidency of the United States, she again rained job offers.\n\nGentlemen please! You can save yourself more comments and assumptions... Do you believe me so stupid? I know that the producers of \"Faicon Crest\" hired not only the actress, but also the ex-wife of Ronald Reagan gan.,. I fully realize: I am sixty-eight years old, and I am no longer a girl. I shy away from the truth, it doesn't even scare me, but I'm not a newbie to television.\n\nThe script of the vintage years pilot of Falcon Crest is from February 1981. Ronald was elected in November 1980\n\nJane behaved very badly with Ronald.\n\nPeople remembered Jane because her husband was President.\n\nBy the way, apparently Jane was not very enthusiastic about Ronnie's political career.\n\nI know you just want to post negative things about Jane Wyman whenever you can but little of it is based in fact. Jane and Ronnie never talked about their divorce. In his autobiography all he said was that they got married, had wonderful children and got divorced. From memory, he only wrote 2 sentences about his marriage and Jane never discussed it in interviews either. Your stories about their divorce are just gossip and speculation.\n\nSimilarly Jane didn't talk about him while he was in the White House and later said something along the lines of her not being very political although she always thought of herself as a Republican and that Reagan was a very good president. I can't remember her exact words but that the the gist of what she said and was one of the few things she said about her ex-husband's presidency.\n\nA significant amount of people watching Falcon Crest, especially outside of the USA, didn't realise she was once married to Ronald Reagan. I was in junior school at the time and most of my friends had no idea that he was her ex-husband. I think more people now remembered her as an Oscar winning actress and for being on Falcon Crest than they do for her being the ex-Mrs Reagan.\n\nIn the 1970s she decided to come out of semi-retirement and wanted to do some TV work and got guest starring roles in several TV series, however she really wanted a regular role. She filmed at least 2 pilots for lead roles in TV series including Amanda Fallon and The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel . Amanda Fallon wasn't picked up as a series but the producers liked Jane and the character which prompted them to use Amanda Fallon again in the series The Bold Ones (which I discussed on another thread). The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel (which I also discussed on another thread) was being considered for a series while Jane was being considered for Falcon Crest but producers later decided to pass on the idea which freed her up to play Angela Channing. Most of this happened before 1980 when Reagan became President so that doesn't fit with the idea that she owed her TV career to being the ex-wife of Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe article says that Nolan Miller was Jane Wyman's fifth husband. This information is also on Wikipedia\n\nPlease find a link to a Wikipedia source to prove this nonsense.\n\nI think more people now remembered her as an Oscar winning actress and for being on Falcon Crest than they do for her being the ex-Mrs Reagan.\n\nAnd at that time a lot of her old films were shown regularly on TV. I've discovered her in the films by Douglas Sirk before Falcon Crest. I assume they were shown in a lot of countries around the world on TV. Before Reagan became President of the US no one in Europe cared about him or that he was Governor of California. Our news weren't dominated as much by US topics as they are today. To the people I knew President Reagan was the ex-husband of Jane Wyman. The majority of people in Europe disliked Reagan (and his wife) but not his ex-wife.\n\nPlease find a link to a Wikipedia source to prove this nonsense.\n\nYou’re right, it is nonsense. She never married Nolan Miller, it just more inaccuracies like a lot of the anti-Jane Wyman stuff posted on here.\n\nAnd at that time a lot of her old films were shown regularly on TV.

Before Reagan became President of the US no one in Europe cared about him or that he was Governor of California. Our news weren't dominated as much by US topics as they are today. To the people I knew President Reagan was the ex-husband of Jane Wyman. The majority of people in Europe disliked Reagan (and his wife) but not his ex-wife.\n\nIt was similar for me too. I was a fan of Jane Wyman long before Falcon Crest and long before I was aware of who was Ronald Reagan. Back when I was in junior school, every Monday late afternoon/early evening they used to show an old Hollywood film on BBC2 (a more minor TV channel in the UK) and one week they showed Johnny Belinda (1948) and I loved it and was completely captivated by Jane Wyman's performance. I instantly became a fan of hers and watched everything with her that they showed on TV. She was the reason why I was interested in watching Falcon Crest in the first place. If they put on a film with Nancy Davis (Ronnie's second wife) or even Ronnie himself, I wouldn't have been particularly interested.\n\nShe was the reason why I was interested in watching Falcon Crest in the first place.\n\nSame here. And of course Wyman's films with Douglas Sirk had a special resonance in Germany because he was actually born in Hamburg (as Hans Detlef Sierck). Film students to this day still study his work and they continue to be influential - as seen in Todd Haynes films, most recent in Carol (2015).\n\nGerman director Rainer Werner Fassbinder cited Sirk as his favourite director, e.g. the story and colourful cinematography in Lola (1981) clearly references to it. Mexican Director Guillermo del Toro even thanked Sirk in his speech at the 2018 Oscars!\n\nSirk's films have been quoted in films by directors such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder (whose Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is partly based on All That Heaven Allows) and, later, Quentin Tarantino, Todd Haynes, Pedro Almodóvar, Wong Kar-wai, David Lynch, John Waters and Lars von Trier.\n\nMore specifically, Almodóvar's vibrant use of color in 1988's Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown recalls the cinematography of Sirk's films of the 1950s, while Haynes' Far From Heaven was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical Sirk melodrama—in particular All That Heaven Allows. Tarantino paid homage to Sirk and his melodramatic style in Pulp Fiction, when character Vincent Vega, at a '50s-themed restaurant, orders the \"Douglas Sirk steak\" cooked \"bloody as hell\". Aki Kaurismäki alluded to Sirk as well; in his silent film, Juha, the villain's sport car is named \"Sierck\". Sirk was also one of the directors mentioned by Guillermo del Toro in his Oscar acceptance speech for Best Picture for The Shape of Water : \"Growing up in Mexico as a kid, I was a big admirer of foreign film. Foreign film, like E.T., William Wyler, or Douglas Sirk, or Frank Capra.\"\n\nPolyester (1981) directed by Waters was, according to Waters, informed by Sirk's Universal melodramas.\n\nObviously the cultural background doesn't grow by reading Spanish gossip magazines (or badly translated German Fan Club stories - that's like using the dubious sources from the conspiracy friends in the US politics forum where everything crazy from YT- and Twitter lunatics is believed but legitimate sources get discredited). It's a parallel world with alternative facts. So if you have no idea about how Wyman's accomplished work with Sirk (All That Heaven Allows stands out) has influenced Spain's most famous director you may believe that Wyman would degrade herself to say she was only cast because she was Reagan's ex-wife. Maybe as a joke but never seriously. The woman knew her worth.\n\nHow would Jane have felt if Ronnie had made an appearance in one or both of the Dynastys, as in The Colbys the 2nd.\n\nIn the same way how she felt after their divorce? He continued to work as an actor and no one cared.\n\n[...] badly translated German Fan Club stories [...]\n\nI want to clarify that many translated quotes from our falconcrest.org newsletters in this forum are apparently not in their original English wording, but oftentimes rephrased (which may result in misleading information) due to the obvious use of software-aided translations from Spanish and back to English. Hence, misunderstandings can occur.\n\nThe original language of our newsletters is English. The German version is the translated one (translated by native speakers). The information we share are not \"stories\", but facts based on production documents and information given from the cast, staff and crew. If we refer to rumors or gossip for a specific reason, we usually put this in the appropriate context to indicate why this particular information is shared. We pride ourselves in a high standard of journalistic integrity. Our Standards & Practices are here: https://falconcrest.org/english/master.php?path=show/episodes/ai/sp\n\nAs for the discussion about the reason for Jane having been cast...\n\nIt was, of course, primarily due to her respected previous work and her professionalism as an actress — although she was not the original choice for the rôle, as we discussed both in our \"Behind the Scenes\" section (https://falconcrest.org/english/master.php?path=show/episodes/ai/bts/tvy) and in the even more detailed newsletter about the changes from the original seasonal bibles to the final version, \"The Secret FALCON Files\" - Vol. 1 (https://falconcrest.org/english/master.php?path=show/episodes/ai/bts/secrets), which contains more names of actresses the producers discussed for the part.\n\nDespite Jane's incredible talent, it is needless to say that Lorimar, of course, also took advantage of her being the then-new U.S. president's ex-wife. The presidential election was on Nov 4, 1980. Negotiations with Jane occurred in early 1981, and her contract for \"The Vintage Years\" was drafted March 10, 1981 and only signed on March 12, 1981 on very short notice. That day was the second day of shooting already (shooting day 1 only included scenes without Angie).\n\nI think this is a quote made up by a journalist because The Vintage Years pilot was cast before Ronald Reagan became president.\n\nWe all make mistakes and your statement is not true\n\nReagan was elected on November 4, 1980.\n\nThe first draft of Vintaje Years is from December 1, 1980\n\nAnd I swear the position of him on January 20, 1981\n\nThe second draft of the script is on February 3, 1881.\n\nThe original pilot was entirely filmed in the Napa Valley between 03/11 and 03/23/1981.\n\nAnd it was NEVER shown on television, apparently I didn't like it because they were made\n\nLots of changes between Susan and Robert\n\nThe first episode that was exhibited in the United States was October 15, 1981. Reagan had been president of the United States for ten months.\n\nObviously the cultural background doesn't grow by reading Spanish gossip magazines (or badly translated German Fan Club stories - that's like using the dubious sources from the conspiracy friends in the US politics forum where everything crazy from YT- and Twitter lunatics is believed but legitimate sources get discredited). It's a parallel world with alternative facts. So if you have no idea about how Wyman's accomplished work with Sirk (All That Heaven Allows stands out) has influenced Spain's most famous director you may believe that Wyman would degrade herself to say she was only cast because she was Reagan's ex-wife. Maybe as a joke but never seriously. The woman knew her worth.\n\nYou see, you've read Time to Live, Time to Live: Conversations with Douglas Sirk (Cinema)\n\nBy the way excerto in the biography of Rock Hudson who speaks highly of Jane. She helped him a lot. He was an actor with little experience\n\nNeither Sirk nor Wilder nor Hitchcock (he speaks quite badly) Neither Kirk Douglas nor Chearton Heston name her\n\nA good actress, a great professional.\n\nHer former agent defined her well in the Vanity Fair interview. He was sorry to write a biography about her with this appropriate title.\n\nJane Wyman, Less than a Legend: A Memoir in Close-up."
