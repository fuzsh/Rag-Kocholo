        "text": "Jane Wyman Tribute, Lisa Rinna's \"Girls\" and More Short Cuts\n\nTurner Classic Movies will pay tribute to the late Jane Wyman on Friday with telecasts of seven of her films, including Johnny Belinda and The Lost Weekend. The marathon starts at 6 am/ET.... Lisa Rinna invites gals to show \"their girls\" some love by logging onto PlaytexFits.com, a \"virtual playground for bras and boobs\".... Barbara Walters premieres a weekly Sirius Satellite Radio call-in show Monday at 6 pm (Channel 102).... This year's Kennedy Center Honors, airing Dec. 26 on CBS, will salute the careers of Steve Martin, Diana Ross, Martin Scorsese, Brian Wilson and pianist Leon Fleisher....

She was very, very loyal, too.\" After a lonely childhood and rough start, the Missouri-born Wyman began a film career in the 1930s, perfecting the role of brassy, quick-talkingdames.
