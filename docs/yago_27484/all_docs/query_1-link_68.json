        "text": "SIMI VALLEY, Calif. | From quiet, tearful individuals to multigenerational families, more than 3,000 people passed by the casket of Nancy Reagan to pay their respects in the first day of a public viewing.\n\nRoy Dillard, who at 80 was typical of the age of most of the visitors, also brought two of his daughters and his 3-year-old great-granddaughter to honor the legacy of what he called \"the greatest president of my lifetime\" at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, where the former first lady lay in repose on Wednesday, the first of three days of mourning that conclude with Friday's funeral.\n\nIn memoriam: 2016 celebrity deaths\n\nRelated: Former first lady Nancy Reagan dies at 94 in California\n\nDillard's daughter Bobbie Eldridge said she admired how the first lady \"stood by her man, the great and beautiful love that they had and how she became his caretaker\" in old age.\n\nDillard's family had driven more than 100 miles from Bakersfield to the library in Simi Valley. Retired teacher Mary Ellen Gruendyke drove nearly as far from her Riverside home, and appeared with a colorful Ronald Reagan souvenir scarf around her neck.\n\n\"Ronald Reagan was one of the best presidents we've ever had,\" Gruendyke said, \"and I admired them both as a couple for their love story and the support they showed to each other.\"\n\nMany cited that love story as the thing most in their thoughts as they stood at the casket, including 52-year-old Daniel Blatt of West Hollywood, who left in tears after paying his respects.\n\n\"He wouldn't have been anything without her by his side,\" Blatt said.\n\nShuttles bused groups of mourners to take turns walking quietly in a circle around the casket covered in white roses and peonies - Mrs. Reagan's favorite flower.\n\nAnother day of public viewing comes Thursday.\n\nMrs. Reagan's two children, Patti Davis and Ronald Prescott Reagan, will be among the speakers at their mother's funeral on Friday, according to the Reagan Foundation.\n\nJames A. Baker, who served in President Reagan's administration, and former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw will also give remarks during the private ceremony officiated by the Rev. Stuart Kenworthy, vicar of Washington National Cathedral.\n\nWednesday began at a Santa Monica funeral home with a 45-mile motorcade that carried Nancy Reagan's casket down an empty freeway lined with saluting firefighters and mourners holding hands over their hearts in tribute.\n\nMrs. Reagan, who died Sunday at 94, will be laid to rest just inches from the president on a hillside tomb in the hills above Simi Valley, facing west toward the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAt the library, a military honor guard carried the casket between two identical towering portraits of the diminutive Mrs. Reagan wearing a long, red dress and then past a gurgling courtyard fountain. The casket was placed in a lobby behind a bronze statue of a smiling Ronald Reagan holding a cowboy hat.\n\nPatti Davis, dressed in black, was among about 20 family members and close friends who attended a short prayer service beside the closed casket.\n\n\"May angels surround her and saints release her to Jesus,\" Kenworthy said during a short eulogy.\n\nThe Rev. Donn Moomaw, the Reagan family's pastor, read from the 23rd Psalm, which begins, \"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\"\n\nAttendees included the children of Ronald Reagan's son Michael and Dennis Revell, the widower of the president's late daughter Maureen. Michael Reagan, the president's adopted son from his first marriage to Jane Wyman, is expected at Friday's funeral.\n\nAfter the prayers, Davis led mourners in taking turns to pay their respects, standing quietly by her mother's casket. The final one was Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman, Joanne Drake, who fought back tears.\n\nWhen the private service ended, House Speaker Paul Ryan bowed his head at the casket, made the sign of the cross and clasped his hands in prayer for about a minute."
