        "text": "\"She wore the same hairstyle for decades. It was ugly the whole time.\"\n\nWhat's the problem here?\n\nJane always looked very uptight and unpleasant to me, due in no small part to that hairdo.\n\nI forget which biography of Ronald Reagan's it was, but I recall reading that Jane was a nasty piece of work, informing him right after their wedding that she intended to have all of the affairs she pleased and he would need to get used to the idea, which blind-sided him.\n\nThe hair suited her--she looked like a total bitch, and likely was one.\n\n\"I forget which biography of Ronald Reagan's it was, but I recall reading that Jane was a nasty piece of work, informing him right after their wedding that she intended to have all of the affairs she pleased and he would need to get used to the idea, which blind-sided him.\"\n\nAnd Reagan actually COMMENTED on one of her affairs to Louella Parsons! \"Right now, Jane needs very much to have a fling and I intend to let her have it.\" It's odd that he would let himself be so humiliated.\n\nUnfortunately, people today are used to women (even in their 60s and 70s) wearing the hairstyle of Peggy Lipton in Mod Squad. Prior to the 90s (approx) , women over 40 almost never wore their hair down. They either cut it short or wore it up.\n\nIn the 50s, this hairstyle of Jane's went along with the New Look fashions. It was break from the long haired Lana Turner-Rita Hayworth style. YOu can still see yearbooks from the 50s where girls all had this hairstyle.\n\n[quote] Those two movies that Jane did with Rock Hudson seemed so implausible. Why would a strapping, handsome, young man be so enamoured with a matronly woman like that? Jane was not unattractive, but that hairdo and buttoned up fashion sense did not make her appealing.\n\nShe wasn't that much older than him, but her hairstyle made her seem like a frump old enough to be his mother.\n\nI wonder why she thought it was a good look.\n\n[quote]always looked very uptight and unpleasant to me, due in no small part to that hairdo.\n\nThe '50s hairstyles seemed to steer women toward asexuality, if not defeminization or to look like lesbians. Women's newly-fouhd freedoms during WWIi were a threat. I can't help but wonder if their shearing was part of returning women to their place by making them look like shit. Sophia Loren could wear a curly crop and be sensual and sexy. Probably didn't work out so well with the scores of charmless, potato-faced haus fraus.\n\nGen Z style is very anti-sexual. Fat girls and dykes trying to make themselves look as ugly as possible.\n\nI do believe, in contrast, that the '50s woman actually thought those severe crops made them look good. God knows why, but they did.\n\nIt's definitely weird that even supposedly sensual sex goddesses like Monroe and Loren spent most of their prime years with them.\n\nI personally much prefer the '40s Ginger Roger pompadour at the front, long in the back.\n\n[quote]Barbara Stanwyck cut her long hair in the late 1940s so maybe this new trend was a post-war event.\n\nYes it was a late-40s trend that continued into the 50s. Even Katharine Hepburn, who rarely had really short hair (and later wore her long hair in an old-fashioned top bun), had a short haircut in State Of The Union and a very short one in Adam's Rib. In both cases the style flattered her, but she didn't keep it.\n\nStanwyck resisted coloring her hair for many years, and had prematurely gray hair that didn't really show up in b&w.\n\nR105 Yes, but back then styles tended to be very uniform. Hemlines for ex. were all supposed to be so many inches high. Women used to measure with rulers. Things are completely different, now. I remember, as a kid, my friend and I used to laugh at a woman who wore her long hair in a braid pinned around her head, because any different style from what our moms and everyone else had (medium length, permed) was that unusual. Older women rarely dyed their hair - meaning, seniors. It was not done, in their day, so they didn't adapt. A lot of rigid styles dictated by fashion designers and Hollywood hairstylists.\n\nDoris Day looked much better with short hair, though. In her first couple of pictures, with long hair, she looked like a horse. Marilyn Monroe always looked good with shorter hair, also.\n\nStanwyck and Wyman were friends according to a soap magazine I read back in the 1980's when both were doing Primetime serials. Stanwyck was in the original sound version 'So Big\", and Jane appeared in the remake. Of the major stars of the golden era, Barbara, Jane and Irene Dunne where the three that could do pretty much any genre, although Barbara did a lot more westerns in any of the major female stars of that time. Barbara didn't have the singing voice of Jane or Irene, but she was a good dancer.\n\nR120, the Catholic star was Irene Dunne. Ann, Irene, Olivia De Havilland, and Louella Parsons attended the 1955 grand opening of the Hilton Istanbul Bosphorus and were invited to Jerusalem for a trek to the Holy Land. As the ladies were descending on a stopover in Lebanon, MGM tipped off the Lebanese press that their contract starlet, Ann, would be arriving. As they deplaned at 2am, the Lebanese press and photographers were there on the tarmac, snapping pics of Ann in her coiffed glory while Irene, Olivia, and Louella were makeup free and in curlers. Ann was whisked off to the hotel, leaving the three stranded. Hours later, a livid Irene rang up Ann, called her a little bitch several times, and told her she was no longer welcome to join them on their excursion.\n\n[quote]\"Wyman reportedly died in her sleep of natural causes. A member of the Dominican Order (as a lay tertiary) of the Catholic Church, she was buried in a nun's habit. She was interred at Forest Lawn Mortuary and Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.\"\n\nIt's amazing what an at least three time adulteress thinks she needs to do to get into the Kingdom of Heaven, just in case St. Peter doesn't accept blow jobs.\n\nI remember reading a story from a guy, just a regular working man who had to go on a set (I forget the circumstances, actually) and got to go in Jane's trailer and see her in a sexy dress - I think the movie was Just For You. The reason I'm putting this here is because I remember he said she was drop-dead gorgeous and sexy, one of the best looking women he ever saw in his life. He was a straight guy and I doubt he cared what her hair looked like.\n\nWyman was both a cute and a sexy chick, and always looked hot in a strapless gown or bathing suit. In some movies she was required to look virginal, dowdy, or matronly, like Johnny Belinda, Miracle In The Rain, or All That Heaven Allows, but it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see beyond the costuming. Her short hairstyle may seem out of style now, but was her signature at the time. and she actually became a much bigger star with it, it made her distinctive. All lost on people in 2021/22.\n\nR144 Only slightly related, I guess, but something I remember from Michael's book - as a young teen (I think) he slept on a sofa in the den while Patti and Ron Jr had their own rooms. One day builders came to put an additional room on the house and he assumed it was going to be a bedroom for him. It wasn't, it was an extra room for Nancy, and he continued to sleep on the sofa.\n\nI was just watching a movie on TCM with a pretty blonde in it. I wondered who it was and learned it was Jane Wyman at age 23. I was so shocked I started looking up photos of her, wondering why she later adopted that hideously ugly hair style. I came here to start a thread about it and searched to see if there was anything on her already. What a surprise to find this thread on the same topic, and started so recently, too.\n\nI read she was put in foster care at a young age. Who knows what that was like. I never thought she was attractive because of her hair. But instead, learned she was quite beautiful when younger.\n\nJane was a bottle bleach-blonde with dark brown eyes, I don't think it did much for her, and her acting career didn't take off until she went darker for The Lost Weekend. She went blonde again briefly for The Yearling, but that was about it until she was on TV and older.\n\nShe actually added rather than subtracted years to her real age so she could work in Hollywood on her own. For years it was thought that Jane was born in 1914, when she was born three years later in 1917. Ida Lupino did the same thing. She was born in 1918 but added five years to her age. She was only 15-16 when she started working in movies.\n\n[quote] Those -dos were pretty high maintenance, even if you had the requisite curls. Past the mid-60s, women didn't have time to sit under the blow dryer at the beauty parlor.\n\nThat's true for younger women but not for older women. Pat Nixon and Betty Ford kept their 60s bouffants, which required a lot of time at the hairstylist."
