Bad for Ronald and worse for Jane who was his mother\n\nAnd which part you don't understand? Maureen Reagan describes in hindsight it was better for her to be in school in New York than in California because in L.A. she would've felt isolated from the normal world (aside from a few friends). She obviously was spared the treatment Christina Crawford got and didn't end up as a drug-addict as so many other celebrity children who get neglected by busy parents in Hollywood. I just don't see the drama you are trying to depict.Â´I also dislike how you describe it as \"worse for Jane\" because it's clear to me that Jane Wyman was the so-called breadwinner in her marriage. Ronald was the one who should've spent more time with his daughter. But then you would argue it wasn't the time for a man to do that in the 1950s.\n\nIn the interview Maureen Reagan gives no impression of having had a bad childhood and she seemed to be in a good place. But somehow you manage again to turn a positive image into something terrible. It's not even common know gossip you spread, it's fabricated from sources in different languages you barely seem to understand and mixed in your mind as the \"truth\".\n\nAnd using Michael Reagan for your theories??? (The following quotes are from Wikipedia)\n\nIn 1981 the born-again Christian \"was accused of felony violations of California securities laws in court documents. The Los Angeles County District Attorney alleged that Reagan had baited investors into unlawful stock arrangements, and selling stocks despite the fact that he was not legally permitted to do so.\"\n\n\"The district attorney's office cleared Reagan of both charges later that year.\" Whom he may had to thank for that in 1981?!\n\n\"On September 20, 2012, Reagan, Tim Kelly and Jay Hoffman were sued by a fellow partner, for allegedly withholding the partner's interest in an e-mail business built around the Reagan.com domain name. In 2015, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury found Reagan liable for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty. Reagan and his business partners were ordered to pay $662,500 each in damages.\"\n\nIn April 2013, in a syndicated column, Reagan accused American churches of not fighting hard enough to block same-sex marriage. He wrote that, in regard to arguments supporting gay marriage, similar arguments could be used to support polygamy, bestiality, and murder. As he wrote: \"There is also a very slippery slope leading to other alternative relationships and the unconstitutionality of any law based on morality. Think about polygamy, bestiality, and perhaps even murder.\"\n\nMichael Reagan is the crazy one in the Reagan family. Most families have a crazy one. He is especially vile. He also called his half-brother Ron Jr. an \"embarrassment\"\n\nfor speculating in a memoir that their father suffered from Alzheimer's disease while president.\n\nwhich was actually credited to doctors and Ronald Reagan's political advisors and based on more facts than anything the criminal Michael Reagan relies on. So this is enough for me to discredit anything what Michael Reagan says about his parents. You're using a homophobic extreme right-wing Newsmax host for your agenda (BTW he started as a failure in school, was friends with a mafia guy in the mid 60s where his father was warned by the FBI - facts that are based on links to serious sources at the referred Wikipedia page) . Without his parents he would've spent most of his time in jail.\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words when a star was dedicated to Jane in Palm Spring We didn't see any Falcon Crest actors or Earl Hammer. Neither his son nor any of his three grandchildren\n\nYou know there are people who don't mind to walk the red carpet for the opening of a tin can with sardines and then there are people who would rather read a book about astronomy. The Palm Springs Walk of Stars - just look at the mummified faces from that event and you should get an idea about the \"importance\". Why should people like Earl Hamner Jr. turn up there? At a certain age you don't like to travel from place to place to honour someone who was close to you decades ago, you limit that to family and real friends, not former work colleagues. I've explained that already to you as you commented this Palm Springs thing five times before. I don't mind spam if the message is positive (Wes Parmalee...) and you brought some life to the FC threads with other aspects but this sticks out as unpleasant and repetitive for a few years now.\n\nWhen Leslie Jordan recently died he also got a star in Palm Springs afterwards: the only star in attendance with a recognizable name who worked with him was Cheyenne Jackson (and to some known is the writer Del Shores), none of his former Will & Grace co-stars were there, it means nothing. Jackson who was there has a connection to Palm Springs, that's the difference. That was only a few months after Jordan filmed his last scenes for the TV show he worked on. Not decades later as in Wyman's case. And no one would dispute Jordan's popularity among colleagues.

But I fear no logical argument about such circumstances reaches you.\n\nPoor Michael was abused as a child.\n\nWhen he graduated, his father did not recognize him and shook her hand introducing himself. I am Ronal Reagam.\n\nHow he didn't have a proper family life with Jane. He went to live with Nancy and Ronald. He didn't have a bed, he slept on the sofa\n\nThe Washington Post gave him credit because I can't do it myself.\n\nIn this article from the Washington Post, a publication without prestige, Michael talks about his book about his childhood and Ronald and Jane\n\nKept secret from his parents being sexually molested as a 7-year-old by a camp counselor, fearing that if he told his father he might lose what little time they had together. He says he \"hobbled through {his} early years on the crutches of adoption and sexual abuse,\" and even in 1987 when he attempted to tell Jane Wyman about the molestation, she had no time to listen.\n\nHe writes that when Reagan and Nancy Davis began their courtship, she represented to him \"all the motherly attributes I was seeing on television shows\" -- cheerful and affectionate in contrast to Jane Wyman's \"mood shifts.\"\n\nWas reminded by his father that he was \"beholden\" to Nancy Reagan, who had taken him in when Jane Wyman did not do the job. Michael went to live with Ronald and Nancy Reagan after a psychiatrist concluded that he needed to be in a family situation.\n\nMichael says Jane Wyman resented his and Maureen's involvement in their father's political campaigns. It was her practice to read her will to them each year, and once she called them over to say she had deleted them from it.\n\nYou're so close to them {the Reagans}, why don't you just have them put you in their will?\" she told them. \"He must be a multimillionaire by now.\"\n\nWhen he mentioned that to his father, he says Reagan \"shook his head sadly and said, 'You and Maureen are not in our will because I thought you were in your mother's.' \"\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words when a star was dedicated to Jane in Palm Spring We didn't see any Falcon Crest actors or Earl Hammer. Neither his son nor any of his three grandchildren\n\nIâve read Michaelâs book. He discloses how when he goes to live with his father he had to sleep on a couch. Patti didnât know Maureen was her 1/2 sister until she was 7 or 8. Complicated parental relationships on both sides. Michael always talks about how close Jane was with his wife. He had many problems with Nancy but then so did her own children. Jane wasnât mother of the year but she maintained adult relationships with her kids. As he grew older and his own children had their struggles he seems to have come to understand Jane better.\n\nWould you go the posthumous presentation of an award to a former colleague of some 30 years ago? I wouldnât. It seems ghoulish to me.\n\nYou see, you've read Time to Live, Time to Live: Conversations with Douglas Sirk (Cinema)\n\nBy the way excerto in the biography of Rock Hudson who speaks highly of Jane. She helped him a lot. He was an actor with little experience\n\nNeither Sirk nor Wilder nor Hitchcock (he speaks quite badly) Neither Kirk Douglas nor Chearton Heston name her\n\nA good actress, a great professional.\n\nHer former agent defined her well in the Vanity Fair interview. He was sorry to write a biography about her with this appropriate title.\n\nJane Wyman, Less than a Legend: A Memoir in Close-up.\n\nView attachment 45573\n\nThe key word is âformerâ and there never was a book. He was hurt she replaced him. His commission on her Falcon Crest salary must have been pretty lucrative.\n\nYou donât end up talking about everyone you work with. Her films with Heston and Douglas were not the most successful for them or her. She rarely spoke of either. Itâs not a conspiracy, just life.\n\nWilder reportedly wanted Katherine Hepburn or Barbara Stanwyck. Both are a decade older than Jane Wyman. Personally I donât see either of them as being particularly believable staying to support his character through his addiction. Jane in her TCM interview talks about how she was very dependent on his direction. It was the year after Double Indemnity, I bet Stanwyck by contrast was very assured. Not hard to surmise he preferred that.\n\nHitchcock has said he thought she didnât sustain the character and glamorized herself because of Dietrich. That doesnât come through if you watch the film. Wyman gives a very charming performance. The film is quite good but lacks tension and has the false flashback neither of which have anything to do with her performance. She liked him very much and attended his AFI tribute. They were both âpackagedâ for TV by MCA around the same time in the 50âs. She isnât a prototypical Hitchcock heroine and I donât think he ever was able to get past that.

Disgusting candidly. Wyman hadnât acted in almost 5 years when she accepted the role in The Incredible Journey of Dr Meg Laurel. It aired in January of 1979 to huge ratings. Nothing really came of it but then Aaron Spelling got her to do a couple spots on his shows. So she had started working again well before Reaganâs election though his campaign for the nomination would have been under way in 78 when âMeg Laurelâ was shooting. Iâm certain her former marriage didnât hurt her chances but she was obviously cast because of her ability and experience. To suggest anything else is absurd. For Stanwyck the role wouldnât have been a departure but for Jane Wyman it was something new. I remember pouring over the TV Guide for her old movies after the series started to see what she used to be like. Such an interesting career. Her story isnât like any of contemporaries.\n\nNot certain of the date of this interview with Michael Reagan but it was after Jane had passed but clearly prior to Nancy's passing in 2016. There is quite a bit about Jane if you follow the link at the bottom.\n\nTONY: Did they get along after the divorce?\n\nMICHAEL: You know, itâs interesting, I donât know if they did or not and I really didnât know if they did or not until my mom passed away and Iâm going through her things and found out she was a contributor to my fatherâs Presidential campaigns and there were thank you notes from my dad to my mom that she had thanking her for her support when he was President of the United States. I never knew that. I was looking at this stuff.\n\nTONY: So you thought there was a schism between them and there wasnât?\n\nMICHAEL: Well not a schism, but you know, itâs like, thereâs no reason to talk. And mom was one of the great classy ladies of Hollywood. You know, she had a rule and the rule was very simple because remember, she had âFalconâs Crestâ during the eighties.\n\nTONY: She had what?\n\nMICHAEL: She had Falconâs Crest, the television show during the eighties. So she was like the queen of the hop on television. And, she had a very strict rule âYou want to interview me fine, about the show, fine. The second you bring up the President of the United States, the interview is over.â They would try. She would just get up and walk away. And she did that and never said a word. She was offered â you can imagine how much money she was offered for a book because we lived in that day and age and never did anything, never said a word until the day we buried my dad and then she put out a statement, âThe world lost a wonderful, wonderful man.â And that was it. And so, really a classy, classy lady because so many others would have been right there, do a story, let me tell you the truth. Iâll tell you whatâs going on. And maybe thatâs how you learn more about Jane Wyman and find out why she has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame â hand prints and foot prints at Gormanâs Chinese.\n\nTONY: You know, I always thought she was classy about being silent like that, but then I often thought that maybe it was because she really canât stand him and is angry about it.\n\nMICHAEL: No, she was just â it was just something that was just the way she was, she just didnât talk; didnât talk about those kinds of things. That was in the past. And, I never knew. I knew that Nancy and she were not good friends â but I donât know any family where former wives and new wives really get along well, like on Desperate Housewives. But the fact that I was going through her things and actually find notes from my dad thanking her for her support. I jut went âwhew.â\n\nhttps://www.tonymedley.com/Articles/Michael_Reagan_One_on_One.htm\n\nNot certain of the date of this interview with Michael Reagan but it was after Jane had passed but clearly prior to Nancy's passing in 2016.

She was not interested in her grandchildren.\n\nMichael didn't have money to send his children to schoolhis mother tells him he works\n\nAnd if he don't succeed, don't your grandchildren go to a good school?\n\nTONY: Let me ask you about something, I have a niece that's adopted. You have three mother figures in your life, your birth mother, Jane Wyman, and Nancy. How do you juggle that?\n\nMICHAEL: Jane Wyman's my mom. It's really easy. Jane is my mom. I never knew my birth mother, Irene, but I'm closer to my birth sister, Terry.\n\nSimply put mom. No praise, she was loving, wonderful\n\nHe wrote some very nice words about Jane.
