Notes on Clarissa Ann Beatty

information from Larry Patrick Cornwell

She was baptized on Jul 7, 1833 in the First Presbyterian Church of Greenfield, in the northeast corner of Highland County, adjacent to Fayette County, Ohio. The record shows that she was the 163rd child baptized in that church. Her parents were shown as Alexander and Margaret Beaty. Her birth date was shown as Apr 28, 1833.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 1865 or 1866, they moved to Missouri, leaving their Brokaw and Lambert friends behind in Ohio. The Brokaws and Lambert families went to Illinois, and in 1867, proceeded on west to Newton, Jasper County, Iowa. When James Elder Kerr, Jr. died in 1874, the Brokaws and Lamberts prevailed upon Clarissa and family to move to Iowa to be with them. Opportunities were better in Iowa, and Iowa was not as far as Ohio for Clarissa and family to travel to begin a new life.

The 1880 Census for Newton Township, Jasper County, Iowa, page 58, reflects Clara Kerr, age 47, as head of household. Her birthplace was listed as Ohio, with both parents born in Ohio. Family members included James, 24, at college; William, 22, farm hand; Maggie, 19, at home; Emma, 17, school teach; Herbert, 14, at school; Eddie, 11, at school; and Millie, 9, at school. All the children were born in Ohio, with the exception of Eddie and Millie, who were born in Missouri.

Clarissa Ann Beatty's death certificate is on file in the state of Iowa, under the name Mrs. Clara Kerr, certificate number 90-96-156, showing date of death of May 17, 1896, place of death Ottumwa, Wapello Co., age 62, and cause of death, nervous prostration. Burial was in Newton on May 19, 1896.

Her obituary (which recorded her birth date as 1832, and marriage date as Aug 22) stated:

"Home at Last. Last Tuesday afternoon, there was tenderly laid to rest in Wittemberg cemetery all that was mortal of "Mother" Kerr, a woman greatly beloved among us, and one who had spent many years of her life here.

"Mrs. Kerr was born in Greenfield, Ohio, in 1832, her maiden name being Clara Beatty. There the days of her childhood and girlhood were spent. During those years when she was developing into womanhood, Dr. Crothers, one of the best ministers Ohio ever had, was the pastor of her home church. In early life she cast in her lot with God's people. All the years since have witnessed her faithful and consistent Christian life--as a young lady, afterwards as wife and mother.

"She was married August 22, 1852, in Ohio, to Mr. James E. Kerr. They moved to Missouri in 1865. There Mr. Kerr died February 12, 1874. Soon after his death, the family moved to Iowa. She lived in Newton until 1892, when she went out to Helena, Montana, to make her home with her daughters, Mrs. Maggie Harrah and Mrs. A. J. Craven.

"Last fall she came back to Iowa, to Ottumwa, where her son Will lived, thus to make a home for his children, who had been bereft of their mother. Soon after arriving in that city she took the grippe [influenza-like symptoms], from which she never recovered. Her illness was long and tedious, and a gradual wasting away. Through it all she was patient and uncomplaining, always evincing that sweet, loving spirit which was so characteristic of her. The end came last Sunday, in peace

"Her son Will, her daughter, Mrs. Mattie Gosslin and Mrs. McElroy came from Ottumwa with the body on Monday afternoon.

"The funeral was held on Tuesday afternoon at the Presbyterian church, of which she was a member for so many years, and the remains were interred in the Wittemburg cemetery.

"The pulpit and stands, as well as the casket, were covered with beautiful and choice flowers, filling the air with delicate perfume. Rev. David Brown, of New Sharon, gave the address which was based on the text in Psalms 17-15, the principal theme being the transforming power of the Christ life. It was a tender, beautiful tribute to the Christian character of Mrs. Kerr, which though quiet, was strong and sincere, 'shining more and more into the perfect day.' He was assisted by Rev. Rice. A quartet consisting of Mrs. Jennie Salmon, Miss Margaret Robinson, Messrs. Harry McMurry and James Dutton, with Miss Anna Tremains as organist, rendered the music.

"Mrs. Kerr had nine children, eight of whom are still living: C. L., of Manilla, Iowa; James A., of Fair Haven, Washington; Mrs. Margaret Harrah and Mrs. A.J. Craven, of Helena, Montana; S. Herbert, of Rolfe, Iowa; Ed. W., of Newton and Mrs. Mattie Gosslin, of Astoria, Oregon. Her youngest child, Esther, died in childhood. Left a widow with this large family to care for, who will be able to tell the story of, or fitly praise the noble woman who performed the task so ably, showered her love and life so generously through all those years?

"Four of her sons, Cal, Will, Herbert and Ed and one daughter, Mattie, were present at the funeral. Mrs. S. H. Kerr came with her husband. The others were too far away. John P. Beatty, of our city is Mrs. Kerr's brother. --Newton Journal."
