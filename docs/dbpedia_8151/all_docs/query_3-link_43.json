        "text": "From Focused Beginnings to Global Impact\n\nBeginning in 1908, Roger Babson, offered a correspondence course on how to sell bonds through the Babson Statistical Organization (BSO). This endeavor was an instant success and courses in economics, finance, and distribution followed. Babson saw the need for a private college that specialized in business education and in June 1919, in a special letter to clients of the BSO, Roger Babson announced the establishment of a school of business administration to provide not only practical but also ethical training for young men wishing to become business executives."
