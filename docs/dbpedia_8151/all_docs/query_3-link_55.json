        "text": "Gwinnett County was founded on December 15, 1818. The government was managed by an Interior Court until the first election for the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners was held January 1, 1873. Initially, five commissioners were elected, each serving a four-year term. The first elected commissioners were R.D. Winn, Burton Cloud, E.J. McDaniel, W.W. Parks, and D.M. Byrd.\n\nSince then, the Board of Commissioners has overseen county government policies, budgets, land use planning, zoning, and more. The Board's structure and hierarchy have changed over time. The timeline below illustrates the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners' history and chairmen, spanning from the current Board members all the way back to the inaugural elected commissioners.\n\nAs you journey through the timeline, you will find significant changes to the Board of Commissioners at two points in time. In 1968, the Board changed to its current structure of five elected members consisting of a chairman and four district commissioners with four-year terms that are staggered. The Chairman and Districts 1 and 3 are on one election cycle; Districts 2 and 4 are on another cycle two years later. On the timeline, D1-D4 commissioner titles denote the districts they represent, 1 through 4, respectively. In 1916, the Board of Commissioners was reduced from its original five-member structure to four commissioners, with each member serving a four-year term.\n\nAsterisks (*) after the names of various chairmen and commissioners indicate noteworthy changes during their term (resignations, special elections, etc.)."
