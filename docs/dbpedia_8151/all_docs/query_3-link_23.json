This marks the first time that scientists have spelled out the instructions for a complete animal which, like humans, has a nervous system, digests food, reproduces, and gets old, making it a very important organism in which to carry out studies that parallel human biology.\n\n1999\n\nThe new South Entry to the Clinical Center opened, thus facilitating construction on the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center on the north face of Building 10.\n\nA team of investigators led by an NIAID grantee discovered that a subspecies of chimpanzees native to west Africa are the origin of HIV-1, the virus responsible for the global AIDS pandemic.\n\nUnderlying vitamin D deficiency in postmenopausal women is associated with increased risk of hip fracture, according to a study supported by NIA and NCRR.\n\nNIDA, NIMH, and NINDS moved into the new Neuroscience Center office building on Executive Boulevard, which some have dubbed \"NIH North\".\n\nA meta-analysis study, led by an NICHD researcher, found that pregnant women infected with HIV could reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their infants by about 50 percent if they deliver by cesarean section before they go into labor and before their membranes rupture.\n\nNIH Director Dr. Harold Varmus convened the first meeting of the Director's Council of Public Representatives (COPR). The Council will provide advice and recommendations to, and consult with, the NIH Director regarding matters related to medical research, NIH's policies and programs, and public participation in NIH's activities. COPR was chartered in November 1998.\n\nOn June 9, President Bill Clinton unveiled the cornerstone for the new Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center, which initially will focus on accelerating the search for a vaccine against AIDS. Earlier, Dr. Varmus named Dr. Gary Nabel as the director of the new VRC, which currently exists as a \"center without walls\". The VRC is funded by NIAID and NCI and spear- headed by them and NIH's Office of AIDS Research.\n\nNLM's MEDLINE added the 10 millionth journal citation to its database.\n\nA joint Uganda — U.S. study, funded by NIAID, demonstrated a highly effective, affordable and practical strategy for preventing transmission of HIV from an infected mother to her newborn. A single-oral dose of the antiretroviral drug nevirapine given to the HIV-infected mother while in labor and another to her baby within three days of birth reduced the transmission rate by half compared with a similar short course of AZT.\n\nWomen with preeclampsia, a potentially fatal complication of pregnancy, were found to have an imbalance of two key chemical compounds that control blood pressure, prostacyclin and thromboxane, months before their symptoms appeared, according to NICHD scientists.\n\nNIDA celebrated its 25th anniversary.\n\nNIH announced its plan to establish a repository called PubMed Central for free electronic distribution of primary research reports in the life sciences. The new site would be integrated with NLM's widely used bibliographic site PubMed and is intended to be one of several repositories in an international system first proposed by NIH director Dr. Harold Varmus. PubMed Central would begin receiving, storing and distributing content — including peer — reviewed articles, preprints, and other screened reports from existing journals, new journals, and reputable scientific organizations — in January 2000.\n\nChildren born to mothers with untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy were found to score lower on IQ tests than children of healthy mothers suggesting that early detection and treatment of hypothyroidism in pregnant women may be a critical part of prenatal care, according to a study funded by NICHD and others.\n\nIn October 1999, NIH announced a major research program involving 10 laboratories, called the Mouse Genome Sequencing Network, to map and sequence the DNA in the mouse genome.\n\nA research effort led by NIAID scientists produced the first high-resolution genetic map of Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite, which is responsible for the death of more than two million people annually.\n\nScientists supported by NHGRI along with groups in England and Japan completed the first sequence of a human chromosome, chromosome 22. Genes on chromosome 22 have been implicated in immune system function, congenital heart disease, and several cancers including leukemia.\n\nThe National Toxicology Program, headquartered at NIEHS, announced that Federal regulatory agencies — FDA, OSHA, EPA and CPSC — would accept, for the first time, an alternative way to test chemicals for allergic contact dermatitis that could reduce by thousands the number of guinea pigs needed for such tests.\n\nAfter leading NIH for 6 years, Dr. Harold Varmus left to become the President and CEO of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\n2000\n\nOn January 1, Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, deputy director of NIH, became the acting director.\n\nScientists funded by NIDCR and NIAMS, along with an NCI scientist discovered that leptin, the product of the obesity gene, acts as a bone inhibitor by telling the brain to slow down the rate of bone formation, showing for the first time that the brain has a central role in controlling bone formation and density.\n\nA team including NCI scientists and grantees used microarray technology to show that the most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, is actually two distinct diseases, thus explaining why 40 percent of patients with this NHL can be cured through chemotherapy while others succumb to the disease. This is the first demonstration of a technology that promises to revolutionize cancer diagnosis as well as many other areas of research.\n\nThe NIEHS headquarters and laboratory Building 101 in Research Triangle Park, N.C., was renamed the Rall Building in honor of former NIEHS director, Dr. David Platt Rall.\n\nNLM received Vice President Al Gore's Hammer Award for a series of improvements in its information services, including making its popular MEDLINE database of journal article references and abstracts free and easier for the public to use.\n\nNIH launched the first phase of a consumer-friendly database, ClinicalTrials. gov, with information on more than 4,000 Federal and private medical studies involving patients and others at more than 47,000 locations nationwide. The new database may be reached at https://clinicaltrials.gov.\n\nCC and NIAID scientists demonstrated that the widely used herbal product St. John's wort could significantly compromise the effectiveness of a protease inhibitor often used to treat those infected with HIV.\n\nAn NIAID study showed that a nasal spray flu vaccine not only protected young children against the three strains of influenza for which the vaccine was designed to provide protection but also a flu strain not covered by the vaccine. It also protected the children against flu-related middle-ear infections.\n\nScientists supported by NHGRI and DOE along with the private company Celera completely sequenced the genome of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, which is used to study a host of biological questions related to aging, development, learning, memory and more.\n\nNIH's Office of Research on Minority Health and the Office of Research on Women's Health celebrated their tenth anniversaries.\n\nAn NHLBI-supported clinical trial showed that lowering the amount of salt for those who ate a \"usual\" American diet as well as those following the DASH diet — rich in vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy foods and low in saturated fat, total fat and cholesterol — lowered blood pressure correspondingly for both those with and without hypertension, including African Americans.\n\nNIGMS and the Indian Health Service announced plans to collaborate on a new program, Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH), designed to promote, develop and support centers that will link the Native American community with organizations that conduct health research.\n\nThe international Human Genome Project public consortium — funded by NIH, DOE, and others — assembled a working draft of the sequence of the human genome. The information from this project has been completely, immediately, and freely released to the world with no restrictions on its use.\n\nResearchers supported by NIGMS demonstrated that a simple and inexpensive change in basic surgical procedures — giving patients more oxygen during and immediately after surgery — can cut the rate of wound infections in half, thus saving millions of dollars in hospital costs by helping to prevent post-surgical wound infection, nausea and vomiting.\n\nA team of scientists funded by NIAID determined the complete sequence of the genome of the bacterium — Vibrio cholerae — that causes cholera.\n\n2001\n\nGrantees of NIAID and NHGRI and others sequenced the entire genome of a deadly strain of E. coli, a bacterium that is emerging as a major public health threat through contaminated ground beef, milk, fruits and vegetables. By comparing the sequence of this strain with that of harmless strains of E. coli, scientists may learn why only some forms cause disease and then find ways to prevent harmful strains from causing disease.\n\nA team of NHGRI and NCI scientists and others developed a new genetic test that can distinguish between two types of hereditary breast cancer — caused by BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations — and sporadic breast cancer. The new approach uses microarray (gene chip) technology to analyze the activity of more than 5300 genes at once. This advance should ultimately help physicians diagnose the cause of a woman's breast cancer and guide decisions about the most effective treatments.\n\nA team composed of scientists from NHGRI and NINDS, grantees of NHLBI and NIA, and others demonstrated that adult stem cells isolated from mouse bone marrow could become functioning heart muscle cells when injected into a damaged mouse heart. The new cells at least partially restored the heart's ability to pump blood.\n\nNIAID grantees completed sequencing the genome of Streptococcus pyogenes, a bacterium that causes a wide variety of human diseases including strep throat, scarlet fever, pneumonia, toxic shock syndrome, blood \"poisoning,\" acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, and the flesh-eating disease known as necrotizing fasciitis. This information should aid scientists in developing new ways to prevent and treat these diseases.\n\nScientists from NICHD developed and, along with an NIDDK scientist and others, tested the first vaccine capable of protecting children ages 2 to 5 against typhoid fever. Seemingly the most effective typhoid vaccine ever developed, it is also virtually free of side effects. About 16 million people worldwide develop typhoid each year, and 600,000 die from it, mainly in developing countries without adequate sewage and sanitation.\n\nUnder a CRADA with the drug company Novartis, NCI scientists found that a new drug known as Gleevec was effective against chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in patients for whom standard treatments had failed. (CML is a disease in which too many white blood cells are made in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside the large bones in the body.) NCI funded the lion's share of the basic research that led to the discovery and development by Novartis of Gleevec, the first anti-cancer drug specifically developed to target the molecular problem that causes a particular type of cancer.\n\nNHGRI scientists and others developed a method that combined microarray (gene chip) technology with a form of artificial intelligence. This enabled them to tell the difference between four childhood cancers that often look alike — neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Burkitt's lymphoma) and rhabdomyosarcoma. Because the treatments for these tumors are quite different, an accurate diagnosis can be critical for a child's survival. This study should help lead to the discovery of genes that are altered in these tumors and ultimately to the development of effective new treatments.\n\nGrantees of NHLBI and NIA found that human heart muscle cells can regenerate after a heart attack. This finding opens up the possibility of repairing heart muscle damage after a heart attack.\n\nAnimal studies by NIDA researchers found that craving for cocaine seems to increase, rather than decrease, in the days and months after drug use has stopped. This phenomenon helps explain why addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease.\n\nPeople at high risk for type 2 diabetes can sharply lower their chances of getting the disease by losing weight (5 percent to 7 percent of their body weight) and by getting 30 minutes of walking or other moderate exercise every day, according to the findings of a clinical trial sponsored by NIDDK.\n\nOn August 9, President Bush announced that Federal funds could be used to support research using existing lines of human embryonic stem cells that meet certain criteria. NIH then developed a registry of the known human embryonic stem cell lines so researchers could identify in their applications for funding which sources of stem cells they plan to use.\n\nAn NEI-sponsored clinical trial showed that people at high risk of developing advanced stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) significantly lowered that risk by taking a high-dose combination of zinc and the antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene. These nutrients are the first effective treatment to slow the progression of AMD, a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in Americans 65 years of age and older.\n\n2002\n\nNCRR-supported scientists were part of a team that cloned the world's first \"knockout\" pigs — ones with a particular gene removed. The gene they removed was for a molecule on the surface of the pig cells that the human immune system recognizes and attacks, leading to the failure of transplanted tissues or organs.\n\nA team of NICHD and other scientists developed the first vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus, a major cause of infection and death among hospital patients.\n\nPeople with elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood had nearly double the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), according to a team of scientists supported by NIA and NINDS. The findings, in a group of participants in NHLBI's long-running Framingham Study, are the first to tie homocysteine levels measured several years before with a later diagnosis of AD and the other dementias, providing some of the most powerful evidence yet of an association between high plasma homocysteine and later significant memory loss.\n\nNIAID released its Counter-Bioterrorism Research Agenda, a document describing an accelerated research plan for the most threatening agents of bioterrorism. The agenda outlines the research NIAID will undertake to help protect civilian populations from diseases such as smallpox, anthrax and plague should those who wish to do harm unleash them intentionally.\n\nResults of an NIAID study indicate that the existing U.S. supply of smallpox vaccine — 15.4 million doses — could successfully be diluted up to five times and retain its potency, effectively expanding the number of individuals it could protect from the contagious disease. The success of this study puts us one step closer to the goal of having enough vaccine for every American if needed to respond to a potential outbreak.\n\nDr. Elias Zerhouni became the 15th director of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe international Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium, jointly funded by NHGRI and several NIH institutes along with the Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom, announced that it had assembled and deposited into public databases an advanced draft sequence of the mouse genome, the genetic blueprint for the most important animal model in biomedical research. The sequence is freely available on the Internet.\n\nDr. Roderic I. Pettigrew was named the first director of NIH's new National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.\n\nResearchers used whole-genome sequencing technology and computational methods to genetically compare two important isolates of the anthrax bacterium: the well-known Ames strain and an isolate from the 2001 Florida anthrax attacks. These techniques will enable researchers to more accurately trace the origin of individual bacterial strains, determine if those strains have been genetically modified, and assess differences in their ability to cause disease or resist antibiotics. NIAID teamed with the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies to fund the research.\n\nNHLBI stopped early a major clinical trial of the risks and benefits of combined estrogen and progestin in healthy menopausal women due to an increased risk of invasive breast cancer. The large trial, a component of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), also found increases in coronary heart disease, stroke, and pulmonary embolism in study participants on estrogen plus progestin compared to women taking placebo pills. There were some benefits of estrogen plus progestin, including fewer cases of hip fractures and colon cancer, but on balance the harm was greater than the benefit.\n\nNIH licensed a new technology that allows physicians and researchers to make detailed, three-dimensional maps of nerve pathways in the brain, heart muscle fibers, and other soft tissues. The new imaging technology, called Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI), was invented by researchers now at NICHD.\n\nA new approach to cancer treatment that replaces a patient's immune system with cancer-fighting cells can lead to tumor shrinkage. NCI researchers demonstrated that immune cells, activated in the laboratory against patients' tumors and then administered to those patients, could attack cancer cells in the body. The experimental technique, known as adoptive transfer, has shown promising results in patients with metastatic melanoma who have not responded to standard treatment.\n\nNIAID-supported researchers proved conclusively that the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum became resistant to the anti-malarial drug chloroquine through mutations in a single parasite gene. This finding has potentially important implications for malaria treatment and control.\n\nAn international research consortium of NHGRI, other NIH components, and other countries launched a public-private effort to create the next generation map of the human genome. Called the International HapMap Project, this new venture is aimed at speeding the discovery of genes related to common illnesses such as asthma, cancer, diabetes and heart disease.\n\n2003\n\nThe International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, led in the United States by NHGRI and the Department of Energy, completed the Human Genome Project more than two years ahead of schedule and for a cost substantially less than the original estimates. The international effort to sequence the three billion DNA letters is considered by many to be one of the most ambitious scientific undertakings of all time. The first draft of the human sequence was completed in June 2000. Researchers have now produced a \"finished\" sequence, which covers about 99 percent of the human genome's gene-containing regions, and has been sequenced to an accuracy of 99.99 percent. All of the sequence data have been deposited into public databases and made freely available to scientists around the world, with no restrictions on their use or redistribution.\n\nThe complete genetic blueprint of Bacillus anthracis — the microbe that gained notoriety during the 2001 anthrax mail attacks — has been completed by NIAID-funded researchers. This bacterium, which can cause potentially fatal inhalational anthrax, differs very little from a common soil bacterium related to it. Scientists hope that the genetic differences between these two may reveal valuable clues to its vulnerabilities.\n\nNHLBI published new clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, detection, and treatment of high blood pressure — a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure. The guidelines define a new blood pressure category called \"prehypertension\" that includes about 22 percent of American adults, or about 45 million people. Americans' lifetime risk of developing hypertension is greater than previously thought, according to the new guidelines. Medications and lifestyle changes are both crucial parts of treatment.\n\nResearchers supported by NIMH found a gene called 5-HTT that influences whether people become depressed when faced with major life stresses such as relationship problems, financial difficulties and illness. The gene by itself does not cause depression, but it does affect how likely people are to get depressed when faced with major life stresses. Another study led by NIAAA researchers found that this same gene affects drinking habits in college students. These studies are major contributions toward understanding how a person's response to their environment is influenced by their genetic makeup.\n\nA team led by NIDCR and NICHD researchers discovered that \"baby\" teeth, the temporary teeth that children begin losing around their sixth birthday, contain a rich supply of stem cells in their dental pulp. The cells, named SHED, remain alive inside the tooth for a short time after it falls out of a child's mouth. This easily accessible source of stem cells could be readily harvested for research. Scientists hope they can learn to manipulate them to repair damaged teeth, induce the regeneration of bone, and treat neural injury or disease.\n\nResearchers supported by NICHD, NIGMS, NHLBI and NIDCR discovered how an embryo attaches to the wall of the uterus in what may be one of the earliest steps needed to establish a successful pregnancy. After an egg is fertilized, a specialized protein called L-selectin on the embryo surface binds to carbohydrates on the uterine wall. Scientists think that this interaction slows the embryo down to a complete stop so it can then attach to the wall of the uterus. The finding may lead to insights into infertility and early pregnancy loss.\n\nAn international research team funded by NINR found that filters made from old cotton saris cut the number of cholera cases in rural Bangladesh villages almost in half. Other inexpensive cloth should work just as well in other parts of the world where cholera is endemic. Cholera is a waterborne disease that causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, killing thousands of people around the world every year. This simple preventive measure has the potential to make a significant impact on a global health problem.\n\nNIH director Dr. Elias Zerhouni names five new institute directors: Dr. Ting-Kai Li at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; Dr. Thomas Insel at the National Institute of Mental Health; Dr. Nora Volkow at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Dr. Jeremy Berg at the National Institute of General Medical Sciences; Dr. Story Landis at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.\n\nPresident George W. Bush visits NIH on Feb. 3 to unveil Project BioShield, a $6 billion, 10-year effort to protect the public from various weapons of bioterrorism.\n\nThe FY 2003 appropriation for NIH completes a 5-year doubling of the NIH budget that began in 1998.\n\nConstruction begins on a new Perimeter Security System including a fence around the Bethesda campus.\n\nConstruction begins on the Bldg. 33 Complex, to include a parking garage and 150,000 gross square foot laboratory for work on infectious agents that might be used in bioterrorism.\n\nDr. Zerhouni announces the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research, a comprehensive plan whose purpose is to identify the major scientific opportunities and gaps in medical research that no single institute or center at NIH could tackle alone.\n\n2004\n\nNIH opens the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, a 240-bed successor to the NIH Clinical Center, which opened in 1953. It is the world's largest facility dedicated to clinical research. The 870,000-square-foot addition welcomed occupants of its research wings in fall 2004, and was to admit its first patients in early January 2005.\n\nThe NIH Roadmap for Medical Research, a coordinated effort to speed the results of bench research to the patient bedside, marks its first anniversary, which includes the award of 9 grants to the inaugural class of winners of the NIH Director's Pioneer Awards.\n\nNIH director Dr. Elias Zerhouni announces an NIH proposal to enhance public access to taxpayer-supported research by creating an online, searchable archive of all NIH-funded publications within 6 months of their appearance in journals.\n\nNIH proposes enhancements to its rules governing potential conflicts of interest on the part of employees, thereby resolving public and congressional concerns about the outside activities of NIH staff.\n\nNIH launches the Neuroscience Blueprint, a framework to enhance cooperative activities among 14 NIH Institutes and Centers that support research on the nervous system. The ultimate goal of the Blueprint is to accelerate neuroscience research to reduce the burden of nervous system disorders and maintain a healthy nervous system throughout life.\n\nThe Council of Public Representatives to the NIH director (COPR) holds a Public Trust Workshop aimed at increasing public participation in clinical research. COPR advocates building trust through community partnerships, building relationships with patients, building partnerships with community providers and building trust in both scientists and NIH scientific research.\n\nAn international clinical trial concluded that women should consider taking letrozole after 5 years of tamoxifen treatment to continue to reduce the risk of recurrence of breast cancer. This advance in breast cancer treatment will improve the outlook for many thousands of women. NCI supported the U.S. portion of the study, which offered one more example of the ability to interrupt the progression of a cancer using a drug that blocks a crucial metabolic pathway in the tumor cell.\n\nAs of July 2003, about 10 million American women were taking some form of hormone therapy, including approximately 6.7 million taking estrogen alone and 3.3 million taking estrogen plus progestin. A large, multi-center prevention study of estrogen-alone hormone therapy in healthy, postmenopausal women without a uterus, was stopped in February 2004 after researchers found that estrogen-alone had no effect on coronary heart disease risk, but increased the risk of stroke. The study, part of the NHLBI-sponsored Women's Health Initiative (WHI), also found that estrogen-alone therapy significantly increased the risk of deep vein thrombosis, had no significant effect on the risk of breast or colorectal cancer, and reduced the risk of hip and other fractures. In addition, among older women in the study, estrogen-alone therapy did not prevent cognitive decline.\n\nThe International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, led in the United States by the National Human Genome Research Institute and the Department of Energy, published its scientific description of the finished human genome sequence, reducing the estimated number of human protein-coding genes from 35,000 to only 20,000-25,000, a surprisingly low number for our species.\n\nAdding to a developing body of research examining a possible link between diabetes and cognitive decline, a long-term study supported by NIA found that diabetes mellitus was linked to a 65 percent increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). These results are among the first to examine how certain cognitive systems, including memory for words and events, the speed of processing information, and the ability to recognize spatial patterns, decline in people with diabetes, while others do not. Further research, some currently under way, will tell researchers whether therapies for diabetes may in fact play a role in lowering risk of AD or cognitive decline.\n\nFrom language to literature, from music to mathematics, a single protein, known as mBDNF, appears central to the formation of the long-term memories needed to learn these and all other disciplines. Most of what we accomplish as human beings depends on what we learn. This discovery, led by scientists at NICHD, brings the possibility of studying this protein system in people with learning and memory disorders and perhaps designing new medications that might help to compensate for these problems.\n\n2005\n\nPeople with type 1 diabetes can lower their risk of heart disease and stroke by about 50% by tightly controlling their blood glucose levels, according to a study supported by NIDDK and NCRR. The findings were based on a follow-up study of patients who took part more than a decade ago in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a major clinical study funded by NIDDK and other NIH components along with Genentech, Inc. Continuing studies will reveal whether the same applies to those with type 2 diabetes, the more prevalent form of the disease.\n\nNCI and NHGRI launched a comprehensive effort called The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to accelerate an understanding of the molecular basis of cancer using genome analysis technologies. A pilot project involves a few types of cancer chosen for their value in helping to determine the feasibility of a possible larger-scale project. The project will develop and test the complex science and technology framework needed to systematically identify and characterize genomic changes associated with cancer.\n\nAn international team supported by NHGRI published the genome sequence of the dog. Because of selective breeding over the past few centuries, modern dog breeds are a model of genetic diversity, from 6-pound Chihuahuas to 120-pound Great Danes, from high-energy Jack Russell Terriers to mild-mannered basset hounds, and from the herding instincts of Shetland sheepdogs to pointers pointing. However, selective breeding has also caused many dog breeds to be predisposed to genetic disorders including heart disease, cancer and blindness. In combination with the human genome, the dog genome sequence will help researchers identify genetic contributors to several diseases.\n\nPrince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, visited NIH on November 3 for a briefing on osteoporosis. The Duchess of Cornwall's interest in osteoporosis — her mother and grandmother died as a result of the disease — spurred the visit. Sponsored by NIAMS, the meeting explored opportunities to spread the messages of the Bone Health and Osteoporosis: A Surgeon General's Report.\n\nPresident George W. Bush made his fourth visit to NIH in less than 3 years on November 1 to announce the government's pandemic influenza preparations and response. His previous visit, on January 26, was for a 40-minute town hall-style meeting to emcee a discussion with five citizens on the topic \"Strengthening Health Care.\"\n\nNIH launched a new state-of-the-art way for applicants to submit their grant applications electronically. Beginning with the receipt date of Dec. 1, 2005, NIH is requiring all its SBIR/STTR grant applicants to electronically submit their competing grants. NIH plans to transition all of its competing grant programs from paper to electronic by May 2007.\n\nThe International HapMap Consortium, a public-private effort to chart patterns of genetic variation in the world's population, published the human haplotype map, or HapMap. With more than 1 million markers of genetic variation, the HapMap is a comprehensive catalog of human genetic variation showing \"neighborhoods\" of correlated genetic variation, or haplotypes, across the entire human genome. Researchers will be able to identify genetic contributions to common diseases far more efficiently using HapMap data than with traditional approaches.\n\nNIH launched a major new program, the Institutional Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) program, to encourage the development of clinical and translational science, so that new treatments can be developed more efficiently and delivered more quickly to patients.\n\nAn HIV/AIDS vaccine developed by scientists at NIAID's Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center moved into its second phase of clinical testing in October. This vaccine contains synthetic genes representing HIV subtypes found in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia that account about 85% of HIV infections worldwide.\n\nRates for new cases of kidney failure stabilized after 20 years of annual increases from 5 to 10%, according to research from NIDDK. Credit likely goes to clinical strategies proven in the 1990s to significantly delay or prevent kidney failure: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which lower protein in the urine and are thought to directly prevent injury to the kidneys' blood vessels; and careful control of diabetes and blood pressure. The launch of private and government programs to improve care and increase awareness, including NIDDK's National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP), likely also had an impact.\n\nThe nation's leading cancer organizations reported in October that Americans' risk of dying from cancer continues to decline and that the rate of new cancers is holding steady. Observed cancer death rates from all cancers combined dropped 1.1% per year from 1993 to 2002. NCI announced the results in the \"Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2002\" in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Cancer Society, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.\n\nNIH celebrated the second anniversary of progress guided by the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research in September. In fiscal year 2005, NIH funded $235 million in new and continuing NIH Roadmap projects. Key NIH Roadmap accomplishments include:\n\nThe establishment of advanced centers in nanomedicine.\n\nThe Molecular Libraries Screening Center Network began work in June 2005.\n\nResearch Teams of the Future awards were granted through fiscal year 2006 to fund 21 Exploratory Centers for Interdisciplinary Research throughout the country.\n\nThe launch of the Re-engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise.\n\nWithin a day of Katrina's passage, NIH director Dr. Elias Zerhouni convened the first in a series of emergency meetings at which clinical directors, nursing and administrative leaders rapidly hammered out ways NIH could help. In partnership with the American Association of Medical Colleges, NIH created and activated a telemedicine brain trust for specialty medical consultations over a telephone hotline. An advance team and medical team numbering about 50 people deployed temporarily to a field hospital in Mississippi. In addition, the Clinical Center made 100 beds of \"surge capacity\" available for patients who might need to be transferred from the affected areas, such as young cancer patients who would need specialized services.\n\nThe Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, which is supported in part by NHGRI, described its landmark analysis comparing the genome of the chimp (Pan troglodytes) with that of humans (Homo sapiens). The chimp sequence draft represents the first non-human primate genome. Our closest living relatives share 96% of our DNA sequence.\n\nDr. Zerhouni announced the latest and final regulations to prevent conflicts of interest at NIH on August 25. In the works since interim final regulations were published in February of 2004, the new revised standards became effective on August 31, when they appeared in the Federal Register.\n\nComputer models developed by the NIGMS-funded Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) research network found that a carefully chosen combination of public health measures, if implemented early, could stop the spread of an avian flu outbreak at its source. The researchers found that antiviral treatment is a critical component of a multi-pronged approach.\n\nAn international group of researchers working in more than 20 laboratories around the globe and funded in part by NIAID sequenced the genomes of three parasites that cause deadly insect-borne diseases: African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. Knowing the full genetic make-up of the three parasites might lead to better ways to treat or prevent the diseases they cause.\n\nThe Women's Health Study, a long-term clinical trial funded by NHLBI and NCI, found that vitamin E supplements don't protect healthy women against heart attacks and stroke. They also had no effect on the most common cancers in women or on total cancers.\n\nThe Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) completed its first 5-year phase and moved into its second. The PSI aims to figure out the three-dimensional shapes of proteins, with the long-term goal of being able to predict most protein structures from their DNA sequences. More than 1,100 protein structures were solved in the PSI's first phase, which was dedicated to figuring out how to process proteins and determine their three-dimensional structures more efficiently. Phase 2 is the production phase, in which thousands more protein structures will be solved and put into the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/), a public repository with powerful tools for processing protein structure information.\n\nNHGRI announced 13 more organisms that the Large-Scale Sequencing Research Network will target, including 9 mammals, as part of its ongoing effort to produce genomic data that will expand biological knowledge and improve human health.\n\nThe Edmond J. Safra Family Lodge opened its doors to guests on Wednesday, June 1. This new addition to the NIH campus offers a temporary residence for families and loved ones of adult patients who are receiving care at the NIH Clinical Center.\n\nUsing New Bioshield Authorities, NIAID awarded 10 grants and 2 contracts totaling approximately $27 million to fund development of new therapeutics and vaccines against some of the most deadly agents of bioterrorism including anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola virus, pneumonic plague, smallpox and tularemia. Project Bioshield, which was signed into law on July 21, gives federal agencies new tools to accelerate research on medical countermeasures to safeguard Americans against chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack.\n\nResearchers funded by NIH were asked to begin voluntarily submitting their manuscripts on May 2, 2005 to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication. \"Public access\" to peer-reviewed, NIH-funded research publications will enable health care providers, educators and scientists to more easily exchange and search for research results. The public will also have greater access to published material about the medical research their tax dollars support.\n\nThe Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a long-term, multi-center trial of antihypertensive therapies funded by NHLBI, found that diuretics work better than newer therapies in treating high blood pressure and reducing the risk of heart disease in both black and non-black patients. The large study, with 33,357 participants, concluded that diuretics should be the first therapy for most patients with high blood pressure.\n\nThree independent research teams supported by NEI found a gene, called complement factor H (CFH), that affects a person's risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in people over age 60. One team, which included NIH's own researchers, found that people with this variant of the CFH gene are more than seven times more likely to develop the disease.\n\nThe Heart Truth, a national awareness campaign about women's heart disease sponsored by NHLBI, hosted the Red Dress Collection 2005 Fashion Show at Olympus Fashion Week in New York City on February 4, National Wear Red Day. First Lady Laura Bush, the national ambassador for NHLBI's campaign, joined Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and NHLBI director Dr. Elizabeth Nabel at a press event at the Time Life building in New York to kick off the fashion show. Made possible by Johnson & Johnson, Celestial Seasonings and Swarovski, the show was hosted by actress Vanessa Williams and included 26 of America's most influential designers along with a star-studded cast of celebrity models. The fashion show brought to life the Red Dress, the national symbol for women and heart disease awareness. In a survey was conducted by Harris Interactive in January, 60% of all the women surveyed agree that the Red Dress makes them want to learn more about heart disease, 25% recalled the Red Dress as the national symbol for women and heart disease and 45% agreed that it would prompt them to talk to their doctor and/or get a check-up.\n\n2006\n\nNCI-funded research spanning nearly 2 decades helped lead to FDA approval for a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, a disease that claims the lives of nearly 4,000 women each year in the United States. It is the first cancer vaccine approved by the FDA.\n\nNHLBI's nearly half-century commitment to exploring innovative mechanical approaches for treating damaged hearts led to the development of the first totally implanted artificial heart, approved by FDA in September 2006.\n\nThe NIH Office of Technology Transfer announced that products and processes invented by NIH scientists generated close to $100 million in royalties in 2005, nearly double $56 million-plus earned by NIH inventions the previous year. The top royalty earner is the invention of a Taxol-coated stent, which helps more than half a million Americans each year avoid bypass surgery.\n\nOn May 2, NIH dedicated a new research facility for studying globally important infectious diseases. NIAID's new C.W. Bill Young Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases will house studies of naturally occurring infectious diseases, infectious agents that might be used for bioterrorism and potential vaccines.\n\nA multicenter research team, funded in part by NHGRI, completed the draft genome sequence of the rhesus macaque monkey and deposited the information into free public databases. The macaque is the second non-human primate, after the chimpanzee, to have its genome sequenced. Overall, the macaque shares about 92-95% of its genome sequence with humans. The genome sequence will facilitate research in neuroscience, behavioral biology, reproductive physiology, endocrinology, and cardiovascular studies.\n\nNIH announced the launch of the first clinical studies under the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network. The network unites more than 300 investigators at dozens of research centers nationwide to study more than 40 rare diseases, most of which are difficult to diagnose and treat because they are so poorly understood. The new initiative will help move discoveries more quickly to patients.\n\nAs part of the largest hypertension clinical trial conducted to date, researchers began a comprehensive outreach program to improve high blood pressure control nationwide. About 150 physicians in 34 states and Washington, DC, have completed training to educate other physicians in their communities. Their goal is to help doctors and patients prevent and better treat high blood pressure.\n\nThe drug misoprostol was shown to provide a safe, convenient, and inexpensive way to prevent postpartum hemorrhage, a major killer of women in developing countries. In a clinical study conducted in rural villages in India, women who received the drug after birth were less likely to have serious postpartum bleeding, and had significantly lower average blood loss, than women who received placebo. The study was funded by the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research, a public-private partnership between NICHD and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nLeading scientists and experts on women's health joined study participants for a 2-day conference at NIH. Attendees discussed the findings, public health impact, and future directions of the Women's Health Initiative — the largest and most comprehensive study of postmenopausal women's health ever conducted in the United States.\n\nThe NIH Pathway to Independence Award program introduced a new opportunity for promising postdoctoral scientists to receive both mentored and independent research support from the same award. Announced in January, the program answers a National Academy of Sciences call for new ways to help early-career scientific investigators progress from postdoctoral studies to running their own research programs.\n\nNIH created a plan for continuity of operations should a pandemic flu outbreak occur. The goal is to maintain critical operations and protect patients, visitors, and employees — as well as animals and ongoing research — in the event of widespread infectious disease or other emergencies.\n\nThe first comprehensive analysis of an animal's reaction to the 1918 influenza virus provided new insights into this deadly flu, which disproportionately killed young people at the prime of life. NIAID-funded scientists found that the 1918 virus triggers a hyperactive immune response that may be the key to its lethal effects. A deeper understanding of the 1918 virus will aid efforts to develop improved therapies against future influenza threats, including the H5N1 avian influenza virus.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed the National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006 by a vote of 414 to 2 on September 26; the U.S. Senate passed an amended version by unanimous consent on December 8. The House approved the Senate version by voice vote on December 9. The legislation — NIH's third omnibus reauthorization in history and first since 1993 — affirmed the importance of NIH and its vital role in advancing biomedical research to improve the health of the Nation.\n\nNIH Director Dr. Elias Zerhouni endorsed the conclusions of a National Academies report on women in science, which proposed that immediate, decisive action must be taken to maximize the potential of women scientists. The report found that women currently face barriers to hiring and promotion in research universities in many fields of science and engineering, which deprives the nation of an important source of talent and may reduce U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace.\n\nAn imaging molecule known as FDDNP binds to abnormal proteins in the brain and shows promise for enabling early and reliable diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The molecule was developed and tested by researchers supported in part by NIA, NCRR, and NIMH. When administered to patients before a brain scan, the molecule helps to distinguish among people who are healthy, those with Alzheimer's disease, and those with mild cognitive impairment, which sometimes progresses to Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThirteen recipients of the 2006 NIH Director's Pioneer Award — 5-Year, $2.5 million grants that support highly innovative research — were announced at the second annual Pioneer Award Symposium. Now in its third year, the award is a key component of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research.\n\nNIEHS-supported researchers announced that they had successfully sequenced the DNA of 15 mouse strains most commonly used in biomedical research. More than 8.3 million tiny genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered among the 15 genomes. The new data will help researchers better understand complex genetic traits, such as why some individuals are more susceptible to certain diseases, and how environmental agents influence the development of disease.\n\n2007\n\nPresident George W. Bush visited NIH on January 17, touring a cancer research laboratory and participating in a discussion on cancer prevention. It was his fifth visit to the NIH campus in the past 4 years. The president praised the agency's work, touting the new vaccine against cervical cancer. He was briefed on the Cancer Genome Atlas Project, a 3-year, $100 million collaboration between NCI and NHGRI to create a trove of molecular data describing the genomic changes that occur in all types of cancer.\n\nAn experimental vaccine — originally created and tested over the past 2 decades by NIAID scientists — appears safe and effective in preventing hepatitis E, a sometimes-deadly viral disease prevalent in developing countries. A clinical trial involving nearly 2,000 healthy adults in Nepal, where the virus is widespread, found that the vaccine was nearly 96% effective in preventing hepatitis E during a follow-up period of about 2 years.\n\nNINDS launched the new Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT) network, a nationwide clinical study that will look at emergency interventions for stroke, massive seizure, brain or spinal cord injury, and other major emergencies that affect the brain and nervous system. The long-term goal of the study, conducted in ambulances and hospitals across the country, is to improve medical care in the first minutes and hours after neurological emergencies occur.\n\nBy modifying only 4 genes in human skin cells, researchers supported by NCRR and NIGMS found that they could \"reprogram\" the cells to give them the characteristics of embryonic stem cells. This major advance could open doors to innovative therapies in the future, where people's own cells might be reprogrammed and used to repair their damaged tissues and organs.\n\nEUREKA, a new funding initiative to help researchers with original ideas, was launched by 5 institutes. EUREKA — exceptional, unconventional research enabling knowledge acceleration — awards seek to raise the profile of paradigm-shifting concepts that might otherwise get overlooked.\n\nA collaborative effort by 3 international research teams uncovered new clues about why some people develop type 2 diabetes and others don't. The NIH-funded research relied on a relatively new method, called a genome-wide association study (GWAS), which rapidly and cost effectively analyzes and compares genetic differences between people with and without specific illnesses. The scientists identified 4 new genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes.\n\nNIH Director Dr. Elias Zerhouni established an NIH-wide working group to address the issues that surround GWAS research, which holds tremendous promise for uncovering new and more effective methods for preventing, diagnosing, and treating disease. Because GWAS science is so new, policies for collecting, storing and using GWAS data have not yet been set. The new working group will gather feedback from the public, examine important issues, and draft an NIH policy.\n\nThe International HapMap Consortium, funded in part by NHGRI, published analyses of its second-generation map of human genetic variation. The revised map contains more than 3.1 million genetic variants — 3 times the number reported in the initial HapMap of 2005. The improved HapMap will help researchers find DNA variants that influence the risk of disease and other traits.\n\nNIH Director Dr. Elias Zerhouni met with nearly 200 members of the scientific community to hear comments on NIH peer review, the process of evaluating research grant applications. Over the last 60 years, peer review has been examined several times. The current effort to revitalize the process came as federal funding had receded, the number of experienced reviewers had dwindled, and grant application volume had increased in number and complexity.\n\nThe Human Microbiome Project, part the NIH's Roadmap for Medical Research, will explore the role of the trillions of microbes that live within or on the human body. The \"human microbiome\" is the collective genomes of all these organisms. By analyzing these genomes, the scientists hope to discover what microbial communities exist in different parts of the human body and explore how they change in health and disease.\n\nWith this year's NIH Director's Pioneer Awards and the inaugural class of NIH Director's New Innovator Awards, the agency made a major investment in the future of science, distributing 5-year grants totaling more than $105 million to 41 investigators. This is the first group of New Innovator Awards and the fourth group of Pioneer Awards. Both programs are part of an NIH Roadmap initiative that tests new approaches to supporting research.\n\nScientists identified a tiny, unchanging region on an AIDS virus protein that may be the key to neutralizing the virus. A multi-site research team, including scientists from NIAID and NCI, used X-ray crystallography to take detailed 3-D snapshots of an antibody grabbing onto this stable viral region, which HIV uses to latch onto and infect T cells. Discovery of this potential viral weak spot could have a profound impact on development of an AIDS vaccine.\n\nThe Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) consortium, funded by NCRR, added 12 more academic health centers to the 12 announced in 2006. When fully implemented in 2012, 60 institutions will be linked together to energize the discipline of clinical and translational science.\n\nIn a September 12 ceremony in the U.S. Capitol, NIH and NASA signed a memorandum of understanding that will help American scientists use the International Space Station to answer questions about human health and disease. NIH Director Dr. Elias Zerhouni and NASA Administrator Dr. Michael D. Griffin signed a pact to collaborate on space-related health research.\n\nNIH research was featured in a new TV series, \"Tomorrow's Medicine Today.\" NIH Director Dr. Elias Zerhouni served as guest-co-host of the discussion shows, taped at Montclair State University studios in New Jersey. Each episode featured interviews with NIH Institute or Center directors, who invited extramural scientists to present their research in lay terms for a general audience.\n\nThe NIH Council of Councils, a new advisory body to the NIH Director, convened for the first time on November 8. Created by the NIH Reform Act of 2006, the Council oversees Common Fund expenditures, which pay for broad, trans-NIH initiatives that need support no single institute or center could offer. Council members represent the advisory councils of all 27 Institutes and Centers plus 3 ad hoc representatives. Their mission is to advise the NIH Director about which cross-cutting initiatives to support.\n\nNIH's Public Trust Initiative launched its Partners in Research Program, a unique opportunity for scientists to team up with community organizations. Announced in fall 2007 and set to award grants in 2008, the 2-year pilot was fast-tracked. The goals of the partnerships are to better communicate research results and to make sure the health care needs and interests of the community are included in development of research programs.\n\nA draft environmental impact statement for expansion of the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) to accommodate Walter Reed Army Medical Center's move to Bethesda was released in mid-December 2007, launching a 45-day period for public comments. Between 2,500 and 4,000 workers are expected to be added to the existing NNMC and tenant staff of 7,500, and NNMC outpatient visits are expected to double to about 4,000 per weekday, which is expected to have a major impact on traffic congestion in the area.\n\n2008\n\nThrough legislation enacted by Congress, NICHD was renamed the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the institute's 45th anniversary celebration. In the early 1960s, Shriver persuaded her brother, President John F. Kennedy, to include the proposal for an NIH institute focusing on child health and human development in his first health message to Congress. NICHD was then established in 1963.\n\nTwo large NIH-funded clinical trials found that taking vitamin E, vitamin C, or selenium does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer or other cancers in older men, as some previous studies had suggested. The results highlight the fact that dietary supplements can sometimes seem beneficial in small observational studies, but large, carefully controlled trials are needed to test whether they really live up to their hoped-for benefits.\n\nNIH began a new process that provides the public with detailed funding information for 215 major areas. Called Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization (RCDC), the new process uses knowledge management and computerized, standardized tools to provide consistent and transparent NIH research funding information.\n\nOn May 19, NIH's Office of the Director, Office of Rare Diseases, Clinical Center, and NHGRI launched the Undiagnosed Diseases Program. A trans-NIH initiative, it will focus on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the Clinical Center by physicians across the nation.\n\nNIH-funded scientists identified genetic variations that put people at risk for several common and complex disorders, including breast cancer, gout, lung cancer, schizophrenia, glioblastoma, and blood cholesterol and lipid levels. Their successes relied on genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which scan the genomes of large numbers of people to find genetic variations associated with a particular disease.\n\nOn June 2, U.S. Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and Benjamin Cardin (D-MD), along with NIH Director Dr. Elias Zerhouni, visited NIH's newest research facility, the Biomedical Research Center (BRC) in Baltimore. The approximately 500,000-square-foot, 2-tower BRC is a leased building on the Johns Hopkins Bayview campus, where NIA and NIDA have long conducted intramural research in other facilities.\n\nThe NIH Gateway Center — the long-awaited \"front door\" to the Bethesda campus at Rockville Pike and South Drive near the Medical Center Metro station — ope"
