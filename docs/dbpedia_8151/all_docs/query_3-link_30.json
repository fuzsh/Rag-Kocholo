        "text": "John Dean (born October 14, 1938, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American lawyer who served as White House counsel (1970–73) during the administration of U.S. Pres. Richard M. Nixon and whose revelation of official participation in the Watergate scandal ultimately led to the resignation of the president and the imprisonment of Dean himself and other top aides.\n\nDean attended Colgate University (Hamilton, New York) and then the College of Wooster (Ohio), where he received a bachelor’s degree in 1961. He received a law degree from Georgetown University (Washington, D.C.) in 1965. He first joined a law firm in Washington, D.C., and then served in 1966–67 as chief minority (Republican) counsel to the House Judiciary Committee. A two-year tenure as associate director of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws preceded his accepting appointment in the Nixon administration as an associate deputy attorney general. In 1970 the president selected Dean as White House counsel.\n\nDean first came to national attention in 1972, when Nixon named him to head a special investigation into possible involvement of White House personnel in the Watergate case. As was later revealed, he refused to issue a proposed fictitious report denying a cover-up, and, when implications of White House involvement became stronger, Dean began telling federal investigators what he knew.\n\nNixon fired Dean on April 30, 1973. Two months later Dean testified publicly before the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, explaining in great detail how White House officials—including the president—had obstructed justice in order to mask their participation in the events following the June 17, 1972, break-in at the Watergate headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. Dean was convicted of obstruction of justice and served four months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal. He recounted his role in Watergate in Blind Ambition (1976) and Lost Honor (1982)."
