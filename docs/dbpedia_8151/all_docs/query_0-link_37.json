        "text": "OPINION\n\nBURCH, J.:\n\nIn the year 1893 John Ewing made his will. The fourth paragraph reads as follows:\n\n\"Fourth: I will and bequeath to my daughter, Mary A. Nesbitt, nee Ewing, and to the heirs of her body, the south half (1/2) of the northwest quarter (1/4) of section No. twenty-one (21), township thirteen (13), of range twenty-four (24), in Johnson county, Kansas.\"\n\nDevises using the same language were made to the testator's other children, four in number. Besides these the will contained four other devises, which were expressly stated to be \"free and clear of all entailment,\" thus clearly indicating the intention of the testator to create estates tail by the phraseology employed in paragraph 4 and those like it. In 1895 John Ewing died, leaving as his heirs the five children who were the beneficiaries of his will. The will was duly probated, the estate was administered and closed, and Mary A. Nesbitt entered into possession of the tract of land devised to her. In the year 1909 she died without having borne children and was survived by her husband, William J. Nesbitt, who continued in possession of the land. Soon after Mary A. Nesbitt's death her brothers and sisters commenced an action of ejectment, and for rents and profits, against William J. Nesbitt, claiming to be owners in fee simple. He answered claiming a one-fifth interest in the land and praying for partition. Judgment was rendered for the defendant and the plaintiffs appeal.\n\nThe will contained a residuary clause in which the testator gave to his children surviving him, share and share alike, \"all other property, goods, chattels, moneys, stocks, credits, and effects\" of which he might die seized. The defendant claims that his wife was the donee of an estate tail; that the donor retained a reversionary interest in fee simple expectant upon the estate tail; that if, by virtue of the residuary clause of the will, this reversion was not disposed of it descended, upon the death of the donor, to his heirs, one of whom was his daughter, Mary A. Nesbitt; and that upon her death the defendant, as her surviving husband, took her share of the fee, which was one-fifth. If, however, the residuary clause of the will was effectual to devise the reversion to the testator's children, Mary A. Nesbitt took a one-fifth interest which, upon her death, descended to the defendant. Under either theory the defendant's claim to a one-fifth interest in the land is valid if the law of this state recognizes estates tail as they existed under the common law of England at the time of the colonization of this country.\n\nUnder the early common law a grant to a man and the heirs of his body was a grant of a fee on condition that he had heirs of his body. The fee so granted was designated a conditional fee. If the donee had no heirs of his body, the condition was not performed and the land reverted to the donor. If heirs of the donee's body were born, the condition was regarded as performed and the donee was at liberty to make a conveyance which would bar him, his issue, and the donor's reversion. He could likewise charge the land with rents and encumbrances which would bind his issue, and the estate was forfeitable for his treason. If the condition were performed but the donee made no conveyance, the land descended, upon his death, to the specified issue, who were at liberty to convey. If they made no conveyance the land reverted to the donor. If the condition were performed but the issue died, and the donee then died without having made a conveyance, the land reverted to the donor. In order to bar the possibility of reverter to the donor and to restore the descent to its ordinary course under the common law, donees of conditional fees were in the habit of making conveyances as soon as issue was born and taking back warranty deeds. To stop this practice, which evaded the condition and defeated the intention of the donor, the nobility of the realm, who were desirous of perpetuating family possessions, procured the passage of the statute of Westminster II, known as the statute \"de donis conditionalibus.\" (13 Edw. I, c. 1, June 28, 1285.) This statute took away the power of alienation and declared that the will of the donor, plainly expressed, should be observed, and that tenements given to a man and the heirs of his body should go to his issue, if there were any, and if not should revert to the donor. The judges interpreted this statute to mean that the donee no longer took a conditional fee capable of being disposed of as soon as issue was born, but that he took a particular estate, denominated an estate tail, and that instead of a possibility of reverter only remaining in the donor, he had a reversion in fee simple expectant upon the failure of issue. Some of the social consequences of this statute are thus described by Blackstone:\n\n\"Children grew disobedient when they knew they could not be set aside: farmers were ousted of their leases made by tenants in tail; for, if such leases had been valid, then under color of long leases the issue might have been virtually disinherited; creditors were defrauded of their debts; for, if a tenant in tail could have charged his estate with their payment, he might also have defeated his issue, by mortgaging it for as much as it was worth; innumerable latent entails were produced to deprive purchasers of the lands they had fairly bought; of suits in consequence of which our ancient books are full: and treasons were encouraged, as estates-tail were not liable to forfeiture, longer than for the tenant's life. So that they were justly branded, as the source of new contentions, and mischiefs unknown to the common law; and almost universally considered as the common grievance of the realm. (2 Commentaries, *116.)\n\nNotwithstanding these mischiefs, the statute forms one of the fundamental institutes of the land law of England which three and a quarter centuries later was transplanted in the New World.\n\nBefore the settlement at Jamestown, in the fourth year of James I (1607), a number of statutes had been passed whereby the privileges attending estates tail were much abridged. They were made forfeitable for treason. (26 Henry VIII, c. 13.) Certain leases by the tenant in tail not prejudicial to the issue were allowed to be good in law. (32 Henry VIII, c. 28.) The statute of fines (4 Henry VII, c. 24) was construed to permit the tenant in tail and his heirs to be barred by levying a fine (32 Henry VIII, c. 36). Such estates were chargeable with the payment of certain debts due the king (33 Henry VIII, c. 39), and by construction of the statute, 43 Eliz. c. 4, an appointment to charitable uses by a tenant in tail was held to be good (2 Bl. Com. 117 et seq.). The most serious blow, however, to the evils fostered by estates tail under the statute de donis was struck by a bold piece of judicial legislation. In Taltarum's case, reported in Year Book, 12 Edw. IV, 19 (1472), the judges, upon consultation, held that a common recovery suffered by a tenant in tail accomplished the complete destruction of the estate tail. This mode of barring estates tail is thus described in 1 Washburn on Real Property, 6th ed., ยง 186:"
