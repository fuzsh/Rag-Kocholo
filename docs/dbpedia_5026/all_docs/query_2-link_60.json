        "text": "Description\n\nWe are happy to offer a classic style 5 panel custom US Navy destroyer DDG 121 USS Frank E Petersen Jr embroidered hat.\n\nFor an additional (and optional) charge of $7.00, our hats can be personalized with up to 2 lines of text of 14 characters each (including spaces), such as with a veteran’s last name and rate and rank on the first line, and years of service on the second line.\n\nOur DDG 121 USS Frank E Petersen Jr embroidered hat comes in two styles for your choosing. A traditional “high profile” flat bill snap back style (with an authentic green under visor on the bottom of the flat bill), or a modern “medium profile” curved bill velcro back “baseball cap” style. Both styles are “one size fits all”. Our hats are made of durable 100% cotton for breathability and comfort.\n\nGiven high embroidery demands on these “made to order” hats, please allow 4 weeks for shipment."
