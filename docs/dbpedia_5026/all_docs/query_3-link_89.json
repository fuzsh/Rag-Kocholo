        "text": "After arriving at the office at 8:30 am, I was dragged into a meeting with a very distressed colleague who wanted to speak to me immediately at 8:35. She was the Test Manager, and this was a new role for her, but having been the Test Manager myself previously, I was sure that whatever the issue, we would be able to deal with it. As we sat down in the room, the Test Manager looked at me and said, ‚ÄúI have a lump in my breast, I think it‚Äôs cancer, and I don‚Äôt know what to do,‚Äù and then burst into tears. After freezing for a couple of seconds, I tried my best to comfort her, indicating everything would be all right. After reading this story from Gordon Tredgold‚Äôs article 7 Things, I Wish I Knew Before I Became a Leader, it touched my inner core. When someone can share such sensitive and personal information with someone, it shows that the leader cares about their team and creates an environment of trust where everyone can be themselves at work. Great leaders have a genuine interest in others. They have a desire to build a relationship with their team, to know the people working with them, and to encourage everyone on their team to be the best they can be.\n\nMy heart is broken after reading this. Andy and Samie Hardman lost their 12 year-old son to suicide this past week. The same way I attempted to take my life nine years ago at the age of 14. Seven years later I built the confidence to share my story so others like Drayke would not feel alone or suffer in silence. We need to love‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry we let you down Drayke. Rest in Peace. üòûüôè ‚ÄúThere are amazing people still in this world and we‚Äôve felt that love so much from so many of you. I‚Äôve been wanting to share my feelings, but I've struggled to find the words. Now it's my time to be a voice of my hero my only son who was taken from us. Closing my eyes 51 hours after I began CPR in hopes of saving my sons life. Hearing the screams of his 16 year old sister who witnessed something no one should. This is my nightmare‚Ä¶.every moment I shut my eyes. While my son will never open his eyes in this life again. Leaning over my child performing CPR and feeling like I will not have the strength to continue as my arms weaken and burn from exhaustion. Fighting in the back of your mind that Drayke was already gone beneath the pressing of each downward motion. While the vomit he aspirates seeps from his precious little mouth. What would cause a 12 year old boy to lose so much hope in his heart that he would tie his hoodie around his neck to take his own life? One word‚Ä¶BULLYING!!! I woke this morning more angry than I have ever been in my life. Do I blame myself? Do I blame my sweet boys bully? I blame the system! I blame the fact that these bullies even exist! How is there this much hate in our world that we allow children to hurt other children? It‚Äôs simple‚Ä¶we do it to each other and they learn that its okay to feed their lack of confidence. They think it makes them cool. My son will never marry, never become a father. Shit, he‚Äôll never have a future of any kind. All because of one cowardly child. Why did this boy deserve to treat my son as if he wasn‚Äôt human? What happen in his and his cowardly following garbage friends to become an advocate of hate. Is it the parents? I don‚Äôt have the answers, but I do know THIS HAS TO STOP NOW!‚Äù #doitfordrake https://lnkd.in/dDZnHyVA Instagram: hard_man03"
