        "text": "If you’re an active servicemember or Veteran, you may qualify for a variety of financial scholarships and military grants that will help you pay for your tuition and related college expenses. Your spouse and/or children may also be eligible for assistance, or you may be eligible if your parent or spouse is a servicemember or Veteran, depending on the grant or scholarship’s criteria.\n\nVarious organizations make these types of military grants and scholarships available. For example, you may qualify for financial aid from federal government programs, like the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, or through nonprofit Veterans’ service organizations, such as the Pat Tillman Foundation. Financial aid may also be directly available through educational institutions, like the Opportunity Scholarship offered here at National University.\n\nThis guide to military grants and scholarships will help you find sources of financial aid for you and your family members, including federal aid programs, Veterans’ organizations, and more. Continue reading to learn about grants for military spouses, VA education benefits, ROTC scholarships, military scholarships for women, aid for military families and children, and other scholarship foundations and resources.\n\nFor additional information about paying for college as a Veteran or active service member, contact our admissions office or explore National University’s resources for military students.\n\nFinancial Aid the Government Offers for Military Service and Family Members\n\nThe federal government administers a variety of programs and grants that provide financial aid to eligible military students. For example, you may be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant or the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant.\n\nThese are just two examples of federal financial aid resources that are available for qualified students. Additional examples, which we’ll cover in more detail below, include Army, Air Force, Marine, and Navy ROTC scholarships; the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, or FSEOG; and various education benefits that are provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Education Benefits\n\nEducation benefits are available for qualified Veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA. For example, you can apply for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits through the VA’s online system. You may be eligible to be covered under the Post-9/11 GI Bill if you meet the criteria listed here, such as having an Honorable Discharge and earning, at minimum, a high school diploma or its equivalent. National University is a Yellow Ribbon school, which means assistance may be available to help pay for your tuition and fees beyond what’s covered by your Post-9/11 GI Bill.\n\nLearn more about how to use your GI Bill to your maximum advantage, or browse the answers to some FAQs about the GI Bill and VA.\n\nIraq and Afghanistan Service Grant\n\nYou may qualify for federal assistance if you are the child of a former servicemember who was killed while serving in the U.S. military in Iraq or Afghanistan following 9/11, provided you meet several additional criteria, such as being age 23 or younger at the time of the death. Below are two examples of federal grants that are available to qualified family members of Veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, including Pell Grants and other service grants.\n\nFederal Pell Grants — If the above description applies to you, you may be eligible for an Expected Family Contribution (EFC) of zero, which has the effect of enhancing your eligibility not only for federal Pell Grants, but also other forms of federal financial aid for students. Ask our admissions counselors about Pell Grants and how you qualify, or learn more about how Pell Grants work and who is eligible.\n\nIraq and Afghanistan Service Grants — If the above description applies to you, but you do not qualify for a Pell Grant due to your Expected Family Contribution, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants may offer an alternative source of federal assistance in the amount of up to $6,895 (for 2022 to 2023). Learn more about who qualifies for Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants, or find out how to apply.\n\nReserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) Scholarships\n\nArmy ROTC Scholarship Program — According to the official Army ROTC website, “High school students who apply for ROTC are eligible for scholarships covering up to the full cost of tuition, plus money for personal expenses and books.” That means you could be eligible to save up to $1,200 annually on books, $420 monthly on personal expenses, and 100% coverage for tuition and fees. Learn more about how you qualify here.\n\nNavy ROTC Scholarship Program — Partial and four-year scholarships are available through the Navy ROTC (NROTC). Learn more about the NROTC scholarship application process.\n\nAir Force ROTC Scholarship Program — The Air Force ROTC (AFROTC) program offers a variety of scholarships, including scholarships for high school students, current college students, and enlisted airmen.

The FSEOG provides anywhere between $100 and $4,000 to eligible students annually.\n\nLearn more about various government benefits for military Veterans and service members, from caregiver programs and services to dental care, healthcare, home loans, and mental health services.\n\nFinancial Aid Offered by Veterans Service Organizations\n\nFederal aid is a useful, but not the only, source of financial support for Veterans and servicemembers or their family members to help pay for college. In addition to government student aid programs, you may qualify for financial aid offered through various non-profit Veterans’ organizations, such as Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), American Veterans (AMVETS), the Spouse Tuition Assistance Program (STAP), or the Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation.\n\nContinue reading to learn more about the grants and scholarships that are available through these and other Veterans’ service organizations, including the Army Scholarship Foundation, Hope for the Warriors, the National Guard Educational Foundation (NGEF), and more.\n\nVeterans of Foreign Wars (VFW)\n\nThe VFW, or Veterans of Foreign Wars, describes itself as a “nonprofit Veterans service organization comprised of eligible Veterans and military service members from the active, guard, and reserve forces.” Along with a wide range of other programs and services that help to support Veterans, including assistance with VA claims and separation benefits, the VFW also offers both financial grants and student Veteran support.\n\nFor example, the Unmet Needs Program is a VFW grant that “provides… up to $1,500 to assist with basic life needs,” while the Help A Hero Scholarship awards up to $5,000 for eligible students.
