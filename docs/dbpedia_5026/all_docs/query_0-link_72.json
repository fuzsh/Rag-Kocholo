        "text": "Topeka native and military trailblazer Frank E. Petersen Jr. often used the phrase \"Into the Tiger's Jaw\" to convey courage and spirit in confronting danger and social injustice.\n\nThat was the title of Petersen's autobiography, published in 1998.\n\nNow \"Into the Tiger's Jaw\" is the motto of the guided missile cruiser that bears his name.\n\nCommissioning ceremonies will be at 9 a.m. Saturday in Charleston, S.C., for the USS Frank E. Petersen Jr., a guided missile destroyer that will be part of the Pacific Fleet.\n\nA free live stream broadcast of the commissioning will be available for viewing at bit.ly/TopPetersen.\n\nThe ship's 32 officers and 297 enlisted personnel are led by Commander Daniel Hancock.\n\nFrank E. Petersen Jr. was first Black aviator, Black general in Marines\n\nThe vessel is named after Petersen, who rose to the rank of lieutenant general and became the first Black aviator and the first Black general in Marine Corps history.\n\nPetersen also served combat tours in 1953 in Korea and in 1968 in Vietnam. He flew more than 350 combat missions and 4,000 military aircraft hours during those wars.\n\nPeterson was born in 1932 in Topeka. He graduated in 1949 from Topeka High School, enlisted in 1950 in the Navy, then left in 1952 to accept a commission as a second lieutenant and become a pilot in the Marine Corps.\n\nWhile training in Florida, Petersen was ejected from a public bus for refusing to sit in the back, according to an obituary published in the New York Times.\n\nMore: U.S. Navy accepts new destroyer. It's named for native Topekan Frank E. Petersen Jr.\n\nIn Hawaii, the obituary said, a landlord refused to rent a house to Petersen and his wife, then admitted to a subsequent prospect that he did so because they were Black.\n\nPeterson retired in 1988 from the Marines as a three-star general and the senior aviator on active duty in the U.S. military.\n\nPresident Obama put native Topekan Frank E. Petersen on Naval Academy board in 2010\n\nPresident Barack Obama appointed him in 2010 to the Board of Visitors to the U.S. Naval Academy, which monitors morale, instruction and other matters.\n\nPetersen died at age 83 in 2015 at his home in Maryland.\n\nThe Navy announced in 2016 that Petersen would be the namesake of an Arleigh-Burke Class destroyer, for which construction had begun that year at Pascagoula, Miss.\n\nMore: Trailblazing Black Topeka airmanâ€™s name misspelled on his honorary street\n\nThe ship's keel was laid in 2017. It was launched in 2018 and christened later that year.\n\nThe U.S. government last November accepted delivery of the ship.\n\nTim Hrenchir can be reached at threnchir@gannett.com or 785-213-5934."
