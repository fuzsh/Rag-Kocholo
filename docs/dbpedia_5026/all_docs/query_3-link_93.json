        "text": "The US Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, the future USS Frank E Petersen Jr (DDG 121), will be officially commissioned into service this week.\n\nA ceremony to mark the commissioning of the vessel will be held in Charleston, South Carolina on 14 May.\n\nLast month, the vessel already departed from Huntington Ingalls Industries’ (HII) Ingalls Shipbuilding division in Mississippi, US.\n\nFollowing the commissioning event, USS Frank E Petersen Jr will sail to its homeport at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii.\n\nNamed after the first Black aviator and late US Marine Corps (USMC) lieutenant general Frank E Petersen Jr, the ship was built by HII Ingalls Shipbuilding division.\n\nThe ship’s crew includes commanding officer commander Daniel Hancock and 32 officers, along with 297 enlisted personnel.\n\nThe 510ft-long Flight IIA destroyer DDG 121 has a 59ft beam and a 33ft navigational draft, with four General Electric LM 2500-30 gas turbines, providing it with a maximum speed of 30kt.\n\nThe US Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers are multi-mission vessels which can perform a range of operations, including maritime security and peacetime presence, as well as feature multi-threat surface, air and subsurface warfighting capabilities.\n\nThe vessels can respond to coastal and littoral offshore warfare situations along with the open-ocean conflict.\n\nThe ships can also operate both independently, as well as part of carrier strike groups (CSG), surface action groups (SAG) and expeditionary strike groups (ESG).\n\nHII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding division is also building other Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, including Jack H Lucas (DDG 125), Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG 123), Ted Stevens (DDG 128) and Jeremiah Denton (DDG 129)."
