ARI-UP:

PUNKY REGGAE QUEEN

Queen of the punky reggae party scene, the outernational superstar known as Ari-Up is an extraordinary and provocative artist. Her commanding stage presence and agile steppers dance moves are as unique as her distinctive crown of tumbling dreadlocks and the sexy, flamboyant fashions she designs and rocks on and off stage. Memorable and original, Ari's sound is as fresh and futuristic as her style.
