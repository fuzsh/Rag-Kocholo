        "text": "How to assign a vehicle to a client?\n\nThere are 2 ways to do this:\n\n1). You can go to Vehicles and open a vehicle. Then click on More and Assign Owner.\n\n2). When you create a JobCard for a vehicle and a client, the system will automatically assign that vehicle to the respective owner.\n\nHow to print my auto repair invoice?\n\nIn general, we strongly recommend sending digital invoices rather than paper invoices. You can easily do that with ARI’s sharing functions. However, for those who still need to print their invoices, open a JobCard, click on Invoice to preview the form, and then click on the Printer icon. Depending on what ARI system you’re using, your print quality may vary. We suggest printing from the mobile app whenever possible because the quality is much better.\n\nHow to add multiple taxes?\n\nARI supports up to 3 different tax types. Go to Profile/Sales Tax and set up the right tax types for your business. Make sure you Activate the valid ones. After that, create a new Invoice and you should see the appropriate taxes calculated. You can still edit your taxes straight from the invoice itself.\n\nHow to add a disclosure to my auto repair invoices?\n\nThere are various ways to add notes or disclosures to your invoices. If you want to do it for all your invoices, you can add a disclosure from Profile/Payment & Disclosure.\n\nIf, however, you want to add a note only to a particular invoice or estimate, then you can do it from inside the Invoice itself by pressing More/ My Warranties & Notes.\n\nHow to set up online payment?\n\nARI lets you connect your online payments account to the app so clients can pay their invoices online. We support the following Online Payment Processors:\n\nSquare\n\nPayPal\n\nStripe\n\n360 Payments\n\nOnce you’re connected to one of them – you can track your transactions in the respective app Dashboards or right inside the ARI Payments section.\n\nTo choose one of them as a default payment processor in ARI, you need to log in, go to ARI Settings and click on “Online Payment Setup”. Choose the option that fits your needs and read the instructions to complete your setup. If you get stuck, make sure you Contact the ARI support team!\n\nHow to make invoices start from a certain number?\n\nYour invoice numbers will increase automatically as you create new ones. However, if you’re coming from another auto repair invoicing app and want to continue your numbering, then all you have to do is change the invoice number of your last invoice.\n\nOpen an invoice, go to More/ Change Invoice Settings and edit the number value. Save everything and rest assured that your future invoices will continue from this value.\n\nHow to automatically update labor time according to time clocks?\n\nFirst of all, you need to make sure you have assigned the respective labor item to an employee. You can do that by opening a JobCard, navigate to the labor item, and then click in the expand button. Assign an employee to the job and you’ll be prompted to start a time Clock.\n\nTo close the time clock, you have to mark the item as Completed. This will stop the clock and also prompt you to update the labor time according to the time your mechanic has spent on the job.\n\nHow to add more users to my auto repair software account?\n\nGo to Profile and click on User Roles. You need to create first a role before you can add users. Roles define the level of access you want to give to your users. You can choose between Read/Write/View access levels for all major sections of ARI. This should give you a great level of control over what your auto shop employees can do inside the app\n\nOnce a role is set up go to Users and add a new user. Make sure you select the role you have just created, add the user info, and then Save. If this is the first time you create a user, the system will automatically add an Owner role to your account. This will be your role and you should never delete it from your User roles\n\nHow to set up online appointments?\n\nSimply go to Appointments and the system will prompt you to start the setup process. Make sure you follow the instructions by adding your email, setting up your shop’s working hours, holidays, service provided, etc. If set up right, the system will generate a unique link for your auto repair shop. Copy that link and send it to your clients. Through that link, you car owners will be able to book your services straight from the comfort of their onlione devices."
