        "text": "PUNK singer Ari Up – the stepdaughter of former Sex Pistol Johnny Rotten – has died at the age of 48.\n\nDreadlocked Ari, who led the punk-reggae girl band The Slits, is believed to have been fighting cancer.\n\nRotten, 54, has beenmarried to Ari’s mother Nora Forster – a 68-year-old German publishing heiress – for three decades.\n\nA statement on his website Johnlydon.com yesterday read: “John and Nora have asked us to let everyone know that Nora’s daughter Arianna (aka Ari Up) died today (Wednesday, October 20th) after a serious illness. She will be sadly missed.”\n\nMunich-born Ari – real name Arianna Forster – was just 14 when she formed The Slits. They became famed for tracks such as Typical Girls, Shoplifting and their cover of Heard It Through The\n\nGrapevine.\n\nThe front cover of The Slits debut album Cut – featuring Ari and her bandmates topless and smeared with mud – became an enduring punk image.\n\nIn the 80s, Ari moved with her husband and twins Pablo and Pedro to Indonesia and Belize, before settling in Jamaica."
