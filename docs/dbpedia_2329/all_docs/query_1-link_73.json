She is known as \"the hip-hop violinist\".\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nBen-Ari was born and raised in Tel Aviv District,[2] Israel. She grew up playing classical music;[3] she started training at age 5[4] and at age 12, she was presented with a violin by Isaac Stern.[5] During her mandatory military service, she served playing for the Israel Defense Forces Orchestra (IDF's Orchestra).[6] During her stint in the Israeli military, she heard an album by Charlie Parker and immediately fell in love with jazz; she later said \"My soul was sold.\"[7] Following her service, she moved from Israel to New York[8] in hopes of using her classical training on stage[3] and attended the Jazz department at The New School, but was expelled after two semesters due to poor attendance caused by Ben-Ari playing gigs to pay the rent.[5][7]\n\nShe released her first solo CD, Sahara, in 1999.[9]\n\nHer persistence earned her an appearance on BET's 106 & Park; the viewer response netted her a return visit a few weeks later. Her performances caught the eye of Jay-Z, who invited her to play as one of the headliners of New York radio station Hot 97's annual Summer Jam concert in 2001, where she netted a standing ovation.[5][6] Around the same time, a mutual friend introduced Ben-Ari to Wyclef Jean, who invited her to perform with him at his Carnegie Hall show, the first by a hip-hop artist at the venue.[10]\n\nIn 2003, she released her second CD Temple of Beautiful, and followed that up with a live CD the following year entitled Live at the Blue Note.[11]\n\nShe won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Song in 2005 as one of the co-writers of Kanye West's \"Jesus Walks\".[12] In 2005, she released her fourth CD and first to focus on hip-hop style, entitled The Hip-Hop Violinist.
