        "text": "Former Sex Pistols star John Lydon’s step-daughter Ari Up died of a “serious illness” Oct. 20. She was 48.\n\nUp, whose real name was Arianna Forster, was a member of the all-girl punk/reggae act The Slits.\n\nShe formed the band with Paloma Romero – better known as Palmolive – and Tessa Pollitt, with Viv Albertine also featured in the lineup. Up, who was born in Munich, was just 14 when she originally formed the group.\n\nNews of her death was announced on Lydon’s website. Better known as Johnny Rotten, he’s married to Up’s mother Nora Forster – a German publishing heiress – and they have been together for three decades.\n\n“John and Nora have asked us to let everyone know that Nora’s daughter Arianna (aka Ari-Up) died today (Wednesday, October 20th) after a serious illness. She will be sadly missed,” the online announcement said."
