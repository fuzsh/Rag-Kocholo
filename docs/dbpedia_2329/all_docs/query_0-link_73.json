        "text": "Typical Girls / Brink Style\n\nI Heard It Through The Grapevine / Liebe And Romanze\n\nDebut 12″ release from The Slits, less Palm Olive who had left to join The Raincoats by the time of this recording. Budgie from The Spitfire Boys came down from Liverpool and drummed on these sessions, and then stayed for a while.\n\nTwo killers and two, well, fillers. The top ranking tracks are ‘Typical Girls’ and ‘Grapevine’. These are sublime and should be played over and over. The other two tracks are unfortunately poorer than the previous two, but it is a high bar to reach the excellance of ‘Typical Girls’ and ‘Grapevine’!\n\nA picture of the girls to make up for the slight disappointment for the two fillers…\n\nTHIS POST HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD FROM ITS ORIGINAL POSTED DATE 26/04/08 DUE TO THE SAD PASSING OF ARI UP SOMETIME ON 20/10/10 AT THE YOUNG AGE OF 48.\n\nTHIS IS WHAT ARI UP HAD STATED ABOUT THE KILL YOUR PET PUPPY BLOG\n\nAri-Up Says:\n\nAugust 2nd, 2008 at 3:01 am\n\nHello – Ari from The Slits here – just wanted to drop a note to tell ya how impressive your site is.\n\nI just spent 2 hours reading an bringing back sum insane memories – your blog is spot on and one of the few sites on early punk that i just did not skim through. Me an my son just stumbled on to this site and glad we did!\n\nWith help from son – I know barely how to do a thing on computers – we are downloading lots of music I have not heard in years!\n\nThe Slits we soon be touring with Nina Hagen in Germany for a few gigs in the cumming months.\n\nCheers for your excellent blog\n\nAri\n\nHIGH PRAISE INDEED. BLESS HER AND THOSE SHE HAS LEFT BEHIND\n\nBelow is an orbitury written by Jon Savage for The Guardian newspaper\n\nWhen I saw the Slits in 1977, Ari Up would howl, scream and hitch up her clothes. No audience had ever seen a young woman behave like this on stage. And like the best punk rock, she had a gleeful desire to shock and outrage\n\nAri Up, whose death from cancer has just been announced, was an extremely powerful energy force – a trailblazer who embodied the punk spirit. As singer and co-writer in the Slits, she completely redefined what a woman in music could do and – in the ethos of the time – opened up possibilities that would be explored by herself and many others in the years to come.\n\nThe Slits erupted during their appearance at the Harlesden Coliseum in March 1977. Like many groups at that time, they were learning as they went along: the performance was chaotic and violent. But no one had seen young women behave like this on stage: enacting a flagrant parody of sexuality, at the same time seemingly tougher and more disturbing than the other (male) groups on the bill.\n\nI loved seeing them in 1977 and 1978. The shows became more coherent, but there was always this edge of chaos – which added to the excitement. Visually, drummer Palmolive was fantastic: standing up to play, beating the crap out of her set in thundering, tribal patterns. Bassist Tessa Pollitt stood stock still and watchful, while guitarist Viv Albertine prowled the stage like a tiger.\n\nUp front, Ari howled, screamed, toasted, crooned, skanked, hitched up her clothes, pulled at her bird’s nest hair, and generally behaved in a most un-lady-like fashion. She was confrontational in person and on stage, but her courage went hand-in-hand with a gleeful, teenage desire to shock and outrage that was a major impulse in punk.\n\nThe Slits found it difficult to assimilate within a conservative, male-dominated music industry. The songs became clearer, and when you listened, they were tuneful, witty and extremely sharp. One masterpiece was FM – recorded for a John Peel session in 1977 – which tackles the insidious psychic effects of the mass media. It ends with a radio sweep that includes Union Gap’s salacious Young Girl.\n\nBy the time the Slits recorded their first album in 1979, they were a completely different band from their thrash beginnings. Produced by Dennis Bovell, the reggae-infused Cut is justly celebrated as a landmark statement that includes strong songs such as Newtown, Shoplifting and, of course, Typical Girls – an enduring manifesto for young women who seek to reject the norm.\n\nPunk has now become so familiar that people forget its primal, revolutionary drive. For a brief period, everything had to be new. If it hadn’t been done before, do it: why not? What’s to stop you? Ari Up enacted this impulse on stage, on record, and in person into the 21st century. In any language, this was heroic, and I salute her for that: I’m sorry she’s gone."
