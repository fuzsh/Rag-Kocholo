        "text": "Spencer County is blessed to have ARI!\n\nDue to a fall, I broke several bones in my elbow and required surgery. The doctor told me I needed therapy and naturally, I chose ARI. I was a patient here before and I knew they would help me make a quick recovery. The therapists helped me to rebuild and strengthen the muscles in my arm and elbow. It was not an easy job but well worth the time. These therapists are so well educated, and they give you the tools you need to recover. Without their help I would not be able to use my elbow or turn my wrist. Spencer county is blessed to have ARI!\n\n- Linda W\n\nI am back to normal and my pain-free life!\n\nWhen I came into ARI I could barely move my right arm because I was in so much shoulder pain. I could not carry my toddler without getting tears in my eyes. It hurt to put shampoo in my hair. I had the privilege to work with all the staff and I will say I am so glad I came in despite the pandemic going on. I worked with several different therapists, but I enjoyed learning all the different techniques and new opinions on how to improve. I am so proud to say I am better and excited to go back to my life as normal. My family is so glad mom is back. Thank you, thank you, thank you ARI!!\n\n- Ashley B\n\nI would recommend ARI to anyone that needs physical therapy of any kind. Much Thanks!\n\nI came to ARI because of a balance problem after an automobile accident 4 years ago. Meghan worked with me on balance issues by showing me very helpful exercises with eye movements and working on my leg and hip strength. I can do these exercises easily at home.\n\n- Nancy B."
