        "text": "|Moment of Transparency?| It's not enough to just write a great book. I wish that were the case.

Let me share a tale that turns a simple oversight into a profound lesson. I discovered an amazing book and wanted to share it with my audience, but discovered that it lacked information about the author. Who should I tag? No last name, he is not on social media, nothing. A marketer's nightmare, right? If they wrote their last name, company info, website link, or any additional information on the first page of the book, people could share content about them online, and it could increase their sales— even without spending a single buck. Don't do this mistake. If you are selling - no matter what, in the 21st century it is very important to take care of your online presence. This book unfortunately wont be shared here as I can't find the author and tag him. 😂 Want to be visible in digital space? ➡️ Book a call with us. #MarketingMistakes #DigitalMarketing #SEOStrategy #ContentMarketing #SocialMediaMarketing #LearnFromMistakes #BookPromotion #MarketingLessons\n\nToday, while scrolling through my Kindle Unlimited account, I started brainstorming how to improve the positioning of one of my offers. 1.

It takes careful self-reflection, understanding your readers, and staying true to your book's central theme.
