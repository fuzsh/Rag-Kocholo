        "text": "Okay, so it‚Äôs been forever since I did one of these posts. I like throwing them up on the blog every now and then so when I spied this one, recently, I thought, well why the heck not!\n\nThe Pre-Amble\n\nThank and link the blogger who nominated you ‚úîÔ∏è ‚Äì not technically nominated, but tomasgrizzly put it on their blog and left nominations open to anyone. Thanks Tomas. üôÇ\n\nInclude the tag graphic in your post ‚úîÔ∏è\n\nAnswer the ten questions the blogger asked ‚úîÔ∏è\n\nNominate between five and ten bloggers (I think I‚Äôll do what Tomas did and leave it open)\n\nAsk your nominees ten book-related questions! ‚úîÔ∏è\n\nDon‚Äôt feel bound to these rules ‚úîÔ∏è\n\n(Most importantly) Have fun! ‚úîÔ∏è\n\nQuestions For Me To Answer\n\nDo you have any ‚Äúreading ritual‚Äù, such as a specific time, beverage, place?\n\nNot a specific ritual, as I don‚Äôt do it all the time. But when I‚Äôm choosing to have a good, solid reading session I like to get a cup of tea (made by my partner, because I can‚Äôt make a good cuppa to save my life!), a fuzzy blanket and either get in bed or curl up on my side of the sofa.\n\nHow do you choose what book to buy/read next?\n\nThe Gods of Reading slap me on the side of the head and pull me into bookstores‚Ä¶.\n\nOkay, actually I have a large collection of unread books and I will usually stand before the bookshelves, paralysed with decision, wasting oodles of time before reaching for a ‚Äúsafety‚Äù book that I have probably read 100s of times.\n\nOn other occasions, I already have like a list of books in my head and I just work my way through them. And if I start a series, I usually devour the whole thing before moving on.\n\nWhat is your preferred format (print/ebook/audio) and what led to this preference?\n\nPrint books, specifically paperback. My focus is too scattered for audiobooks, without the need to hold something and focus my eyes on it, I will always be ‚Äúdoing‚Äù something else and then 1 hour in realise I hadn‚Äôt paid attention to what was being said.\n\neBooks are okay, and I have a load of them but I am so sick of staring at screens ‚Äì computer screens, tablet screens, phone screens. One reason I like reading is to get me away from technology and devices.\n\nHardbacks are too heavy and I get frustrated at not being able to shift position or hold the book with one hand while drinking aforementioned tea.\n\nDo you have a ‚Äúguilty pleasure‚Äù book or genre?\n\nNot that I can think of.\n\nDo you remember at what age you‚Äôve read your first book (on your own)?\n\nCan‚Äôt remember the age, I remember the book (my partner even located an old copy years ago for me for nostalgia). It is called Ninety-Nine Dragons. I found it in the Infant School Library and took forever to read it (I struggled to learn to read when I was younger and was super behind everyone else in my year).\n\nWas there a book where you really liked some minor character ‚Äì and if yes, what was it?\n\nIn The Cruel Prince, Vivienne was Jude‚Äôs sister and was more of a side character (to me) yet I really liked her character and would have loved to have seen her more heavily-protrayed in the book.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the longest you‚Äôve been up reading a book because you just had to read ‚Äúone more chapter‚Äù?\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I would definitely stay up late to read. Then put the book down, kip for an hour, wake up read more. But for a solid reading session, probably stayed up until 3am at the latest. I like my sleep üòâ\n\nWhat do you consider the ideal length of a book?\n\nBetween 80,000 and 100,000 words. I love huge 200,000+ books and I love novellas, but yeah around 80 ‚Äì 100K words is definitely where most of my fave books fall. Meaty enough, without going on too long. lol\n\nHave you ever read a book just because it was popular?\n\nI suppose so. I was told I just ‚Äúhad to read‚Äù A Throne of Glass by Sarah J Maas by so many people. Hated it, thought it was awful. Characters just pissed me off. Never read any more of that series. I had, thankfully, already read A Court of Thorn and Roses series by the same author (loved it!).\n\nIf I had read A Throne of Glass before ACOTAR, I might never have given ACOTAR a chance.\n\nHave you read a book in a language other than your native? If yes, in how many languages?\n\nNope, I am only just learning another language (French‚Ä¶ what we learn in school doesn‚Äôt count if it doesn‚Äôt stick) but I doubt even if I became fluent that I would choose to read books in another language. Though I do love movies in other languages (yes, with subtitles!)\n\nTag!\n\nAs mentioned, rather than tagging people. I am just going to leave this for anyone who wants to play. If you do, the questions are below. If you don‚Äôt, no problem üôÇ\n\nQuestions For You To Answer\n\nDo you read books only once or do you sometimes read books multiple times?\n\nWhat is your favourite books series?\n\nIs there a spin-off of a book series you would love to see?\n\nDust cover jackets, love them or hate them?\n\nDo you lend your books to other people?\n\nWhat is the last book you read that really hit you, emotionally?\n\nWhat is your favourite book trope?\n\nHave you read any books that had more than one author?\n\nIs there a book that changed your life?\n\nDo you have any books that have been signed by the author?\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nHave fun, anyone who decides to answer these questions üôÇ\n\nHappy writing & stay safe\n\nI write articles on writing, marketing, blogging, organising, social media, books and some random stuff. I also create free printable resources. If you find my content helpful, entertaining and like what I do, consider supporting me on ko-fi (where you will also find extra content I post). All donations go to keeping my website running and helping me move towards publishing my novels."
