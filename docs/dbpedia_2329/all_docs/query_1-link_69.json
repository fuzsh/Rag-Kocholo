        "text": "Nora Forster, the wife of singer John Lydon, has died five years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe former Sex Pistols frontman was married to the German publishing heiress for 44 years. She was 80.\n\nIn recent years, he has spoken movingly about becoming a devoted carer for Forster as her illness took hold.\n\nHe also wrote a song for her which he tried to enter on behalf of Ireland for this year's Eurovision Song Contest, although it ultimately wasn't selected.\n\nLydon met Forster at Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren's punk boutique Sex in London in 1975, shortly before he shot to fame when the punk movement burst onto the national stage.\n\nShe was 14 years older than him and from a wealthy newspaper family, but had been working as a music promoter in Germany and then in London.\n\nHer daughter Ariane, from her first marriage to singer Frank Forster, became better known as Ari Up, the singer with punk band The Slits.\n\nAfter she died from breast cancer in 2010 at the age of 48, Forster and Lydon became legal guardians to her three children.\n\nLydon said he believed Forster showed the first signs of Alzheimer's after that. \"A real sadness filled her because that's an inexplicable pain for a mother to lose her daughter,\" he told The Times in 2021, external.\n\n\"From there on it was small issues like constantly losing keys and it builds up over time. It happened so gradually, so slowly, that by the time it becomes a definite it's impossible to trace it through.\"\n\nShe was formally diagnosed in 2018, and he became her full-time carer as her condition deteriorated.\n\nShe eventually found it difficult to recognise her husband. After Lydon appeared on the US version of TV show The Masked Singer in 2021, he told The Guardian, external: \"I wanted to see if she guessed, and she did.\n\n\"She said, 'Johnny, it's you!' It was one of the best experiences of my life: how rewarding to hear her talk that way and keep her from switching off.\"\n\nHe then wrote what he described as a \"pensive, personal yet universal love song\" about a holiday they had taken to Hawaii, because that was one memory that stood out in her mind.\n\n\"Remember me, I remember you,\" he sang in the chorus."
