        "text": "Statement on the Passing of Judge Kenton D. Jones\n\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals, Division One, with deepest sadness, acknowledges the passing of one of our retired Judges, Judge Kenton D. Jones.\n\nBefore joining our bench in 2013, Judge Jones had a distinguished judicial career. He served as Chino Valley Municipal Magistrate from August 2008 until October 2009. In 2009, he was appointed to the Yavapai County Superior Court, where he served until he was elevated to our court. Before becoming a judicial officer, Judge Jones was in private practice for more than 20 years. He was a proud graduate of the Arizona State University, College of Law. He also volunteered his time to the Yavapai Humane Society, the Yavapai County Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and the Frontier Rotary Club of Prescott.\n\nBefore beginning his legal education and career, Judge Jones received his bachelor’s degree from Northern Arizona University—Go Jacks! Before that, he received a degree from Yavapai College, which named him Alumni of the Year in 2013. That same year, the Yavapai County Bar Association awarded him the Honorable Jack L. Ogg Award for promoting a positive image of lawyers to the general public through his exemplary community service in activities outside of the legal profession.\n\nPerhaps most telling of Judge Jones’s commitment to our community and our country is his four years of service in the United States Navy as part of the Naval Security Group.\n\nJudge Jones retired too soon, and he left this world too soon after that. We extend our condolences to Judge Jones’s family and friends.\n\nChief Judge David B. Gass\n\nArizona Court of Appeals, Division One\n\nStatement on the Passing of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor\n\nThe Arizona Court of Appeals, Division One, with deepest sadness, acknowledges the passing of one our retired Judges, United States Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.\n\nJustice O’Connor is best known for being the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. But before President Ronald Reagan appointed Justice O’Connor to our nation’s highest court, she sat as a judge on our Court of Appeals. She was sworn in on December 4, 1979, and served from December 12, 1979, to September 22, 1981. Before that, Justice O’Connor sat on the Maricopa County Superior Court.\n\nJustice O’Connor’s ties to our Court run deep. She was the architect of Arizona’s Merit Selection Process, through which each of us has been appointed. Justice O’Connor’s first law clerk was gifted Phoenix lawyer Ruth V. McGregor, who later served as Chief Judge of our Court and ultimately as Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\nJustice O’Connor’s passing is a monumental loss to our nation, the federal judiciary, the State of Arizona, and Arizona’s judiciary. Her loss is personal to our Court because she was, and remains, one of our own. She will forever be an inspiration to all, especially those of us who have chosen to follow her lead and don judicial robes.\n\nWe extend our condolences to Justice O’Connor’s family and friends.\n\nChief Judge David B. Gass\n\nArizona Court of Appeal, Division One"
