KG\n\nMergelheide 56-60\n\nD-33758 Schloß Holte-Stukenbrock\n\nTelefon: +49 5207 994-0\n\nTelefax: +49 5207 994-297 / -298\n\nE-Mail: info@ari-armaturen.com\n\nFor questions and requests related to data protection, please contact:\n\nARI-data protection officer\n\nARI-Armaturen Albert Richter GmbH & Co. KG\n\nMergelheide 56-60\n\nD-33758 Schloss Holte-Stukenbrock\n\nPhone: +49 5207 994-0\n\nFax: +49 5207 994-297\n\nE-Mail: datenschutz.DE-SHS@ari-armaturen.com\n\nPersonal data and data processing\n\nPersonal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’). These are for example names, email addresses, IP-addresses or phone numbers. Otherwise, information that cannot be attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person is not personal data, such as the number of visitants of a website.\n\nData processing means any operation, which is performed on personal data whether or not by automated means (such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction).\n\nServer-Logfiles\n\nWhen you access our web pages, general information is automatically collected (so-called Server-Logfiles), i.e.\n\n• Type and version of the browser\n\n• Operating system\n\n• Referrer-URL\n\n• Hostname and IP-address\n\n• Time of retrieval and visited web pages\n\nThis data is not attributable to an identifiable person and this data will not be merged with other data sources. We reserve the right to check the Server-Logfiles retrospectively, when there are indications for an unlawful use or if we are obliged to do so by a prosecuting authority.\n\nCookies\n\nOur website contains Cookies. Cookies are little text files, which are stored locally in the temporary memory of your Internet browser. By use of the stored data (i.e. a Cookie-ID, IP-address, type and version of the browser used, operating system) your computer can be recognised when the website is called up again. Cookies are used to optimize the web page and for a user-friendly design, i.e. to make possible an easy navigation and to display the web page correctly. Most of the used Cookies are so-called “session-cookies” that are erased automatically after your visit. Other Cookies remain on your system until they are deleted. Cookies do not contain any personal data, so that the protection of the private sphere remains secure. Most Internet browsers are set to automatically accept Cookies. However, you can delete Cookies manually, disable Cookies from being saved or set your browser to tell you whenever Cookies are being sent. In this case, it may not be possible to use all of the functions of the website to the full extent. Your personal data will not be transferred to third parties or merged with other data sources without your consent.\n\nPrinciples and legal basis of the processing\n\nOur web pages can be used without providing any further personal data and without registration. Whenever personal data is collected, this happens on a legal basis, such as your consent or the processing being necessary for the reply to your request (or another provision of Art. 6 GDPR). If we use processors to carry out our contractual performances, the processors access to personal data happens only for these purposes. Through technical and organisational measures, we ensure compliance with laws and regulations and also commit our external processors to these provisions.\n\nFurthermore, we do not transfer or make available your personal data to third parties without your consent, except to comply with legal provisions or governmental or judicial authority orders. A transfer of personal data to third countries outside of the EU/EEA does not take place in general, except where expressly indicated hereunder. In addition, a data transfer outside of the EU / EEA only takes place, as far as specified below in the survey procedure and otherwise not.\n\nFunctions of our website:\n\nSSL-encryption\n\nAn SSL-encryption assures the data security in the internet by verifying the identity of servers and browsers. You can recognize a SSL-encryption by the change of the domain prefix from “http“to „https“. The SSL-encryption increases the data security significantly.\n\nContact form\n\nYou can contact us by email or by usage of our contact form for any sort of request including a request for our construction program “ARI-myValve”. In such event, information provided by the user is stored for the purpose of facilitating communications with the user. This information will not transferred to third parties.\n\nApplication form\n\nBy usage of the application form, or, where not applicable alternatively via email, you can electronically transmit job applications. Within our organisation, strictly only authorised employees who need to participate in the selection procedure have access to the applicant data, such as employees from the HR department, the corresponding managers from specialist divisions or works council or managers from our headquarters (ARI-Armaturen Albert Richter GmbH & Co. KG, Mergelheide 56-60, 33758 Schloss Holte-Stukenbrock, Germany). Your personal data will not be transferred to other persons or to third parties without your express consent.\n\nData protection cannot be ensured entirely when a non-encrypted email is used. We recommend that you encrypt at least the enclosures of your application email. You are generally free to use alternative ways of submission, i.e. via mail.\n\nNewsletter and newsletter-tracking\n\nYou can sign-in for our newsletter for regular customer information. We will send a confirmation email in order to check the authenticity of your email address. Furthermore, you can request an update-information concerning our construction program “ARI-myValve”. You have the right to withdraw the newsletter at any time. Your withdrawal does not affect the processing before the withdrawal.\n\nOur newsletter contains a \"tracking pixel“, also called \"count-pixel\". This is a technology, which will give us, by collecting Server-Logfiles (see above), information to analyse and optimize the respective newsletter campaign.\n\nGoogle Analytics\n\nOur website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA, hereinafter “Google”). By the use of Cookies (see above), the user behaviour is analysed in order to optimize the website (i.e. number of accesses to websites, average resting time, referral-URL, number of clicks, etc.) by using a “count-pixel\". Your use of the website is usually transferred to a Google server in the US and stored there. Due to the activation of IP-anonymization on our website, your IP address will be truncated by Google within Member States of the European Union or other parties adhering to the EEA Agreement. By its truncation, the personal reference of the IP address lapses. The transmission of the full IP address to a Google server in the US and its truncation there will only occur in exceptional cases. On behalf of the Controller, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other website and internet-related services to the website operator. It is understood that the IP address sent by your browser to Google Analytics cannot be merged with other Google data. You may refuse the use of Cookies for the future by selecting the appropriate setting on your browser, as well as erase cookies already set, but we must point out that the full functionality of our website may potentially be unavailable in this case. You can also prevent data generation via Cookies relating to your use of this website and the processing of this data by Google, by downloading an additional tool (browser plugin) via the following link: tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\n\nSee also:\n\n• The Google privacy policy www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/\n\n• The Google Analytics terms www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html\n\n• More information concerning Google Analytics www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/\n\nPrivacy notice for Leadinfo\n\nWe use the lead generation service provided by Leadinfo B.V., Rotterdam, The Netherlands, which recognizes visits of companies to our website based on IP addresses and shows us related publicly available information, such as company names or addresses. In addition, Leadinfo places two first-party cookies for providing transparency on how our visitors use our website and the tool processes domains from provided form inputs (e.g. “leadinfo.com”) to correlate IP addresses with companies and to enhance its services. For additional information, please visit www.leadinfo.com. On this page: www.leadinfo.com/en/opt-out you have an opt-out option. In the event of an opt-out, your data will no longer be used by Leadinfo.\n\nGoogle-Maps\n\nFor an easy findability of our site we have implemented a map extract into our website. This is realized by a plugin of the online-map service “Google Maps” (further details concerning Google, see above). By your call-up of a website containing Google Maps-components, Google gets access to your personal data (such as your IP address). It is understood that these personal data will not be merged with data of other Google services. The transfer to third parties through Google cannot be excluded. To prevent the execution of Google Maps, disable the scripting language „JavaScript“ in the settings of your browser. Please note, that no map services can be used then on ARI-websites. See also the Google privacy policy and terms of use: https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/help/terms_maps.html\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube is a video portal of the US company YouTube, LLC, (901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA; subsidiary of Google (see above), hereinafter „YouTube“). By the use of YouTube it is possible to upload, call up, review and comment videos. For a better presentation of our products and company, we have implemented YouTube videos into our website. By the demand of a website with a YouTube video, YouTube contents will automatically be retrieved. Thus, YouTube obtains knowledge about your visit of the website and other data (i.e. your IP address), not depending on whether you actually click on or watch a video or not. This collected data is merged with data from your logged-in YouTube user account and processed accordingly. You can avoid this, if you log out of your YouTube user account before visiting our website. See also:\n\nMore information concerning YouTube www.youtube.com/yt/about/de/\n\nThe YouTube privacy policy https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy\n\nPresence in social networks / social media\n\nWe operate various portals and online presences within the framework of social networks, also known as \"social media\". In this context, we process data of users in order to communicate directly with them or to offer information about us. Among other things, we use social networks to present our company via social plug-ins, feeds, shared content or links to our presence.\n\nUsually, user data within social networks is used for market research and advertising purposes and, if necessary, a user profile is created based on the respective usage behavior. The user profiles regularly used for personalized advertising. This is done by storing and using cookies on the user's system together with the user's IP address. This data includes information on the types of content that users view or interact with, or the actions they take, as well as information on the devices used by users (e.g. IP addresses, operating system, browser type, language settings, cookie data). In doing so, the user has his or her own influence on the corresponding user data through usage behavior (e.g., by rating, tagging, sharing, commenting, etc.).\n\nUser data may also be processed by portal operators outside the European Union. This may result in risks for users. For example, it may be more difficult to enforce users' rights.\n\nAs operators, we may be provided with statistical information about the use of our websites or presences. However, we do not know how the individual social media platform operators further use data for their own purposes, to what extent activities on the respective social media site are linked to individual users, how long this data is stored and whether data is passed on to third parties. This data may be transferred to countries outside the European Union. A more detailed explanation of the respective processing procedures and types, including opt-out options, can be found in the privacy statements of the respective social networks linked below.\n\nIf you are currently logged in to a social media platform as a user, a cookie with your individual identification is located on your device. This enables the respective social media platform to track that you have visited this page and how you have used it. This also applies to all other pages of the social media platform. Via buttons embedded in other websites, it is also possible to record your visits to these website pages and assign them to your profile on the social media platform. Based on this data, content or advertising can be offered adapted to you.\n\nIf you want to avoid the tracking of your activities during your login to a social network by means of cookies, you should log out of the respective social network and also set a permanent logout (the so-called \"stay logged in\" deactivated), delete the present cookies on your device and close and restart your browser. Without a login, however, access or interactive functions (like, comment, share, messages, etc.) may be no longer available to you.\n\nNotes on the individual social media services:\n\nMeta: social network; Service provider: Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. 4 Grand Canal Square Grand Canal Harbour Dublin 2 Irland (“Meta“ or “Facebook“ or “Instagram”) Website: https://www.instagram.com; Privacy policy: https://instagram.com/about/legal/privacy; https://www.facebook.com/policy.\n\nFacebook pages or Instagram profiles: as part of our use of Meta's social networks we are jointly responsible with Meta for the collection of data from visitors to our presences (so-called \"fan pages\"). Further reference is made to Facebook privacy policy as well as to the Instagram privacy policy. As explained in the Facebook privacy policy and Instagram privacy policy, Meta collects and uses information, among other things, to provide analytics to us to show how our fanpages are being used. We have entered into a special agreement with Meta (\"Page Insights Information\" https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum) which, inter alia, outlines Meta's security measures and in which Meta agrees to fulfill so-called data subject rights. The rights of users (in particular right to information, deletion, objection and complaint to the competent supervisory authority) are not restricted by our agreements with Meta.\n\nInsofar as Meta uses the data from visits to Facebook or Instagram pages for its own purposes, this can be found in the corresponding Meta data protection information, i.e. to what extent activities on the pages are assigned to individual users, how long Meta stores this data and whether data from a visit to the Facebook page is passed on to third parties. As far as this is not conclusively and clearly stated in the data protection information, further data processing by Meta cannot be excluded.\n\nLinkedIn: social network; Service provider: LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland; Website: https://www.linkedin.com; Privacy policy: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy; Standard Contractual Clauses - SCC (guarantee for the level of data protection when data-processing in third countries): https://legal.linkedin.com/dpa; Possibility of objection (Opt-Out): https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out; Data processing agreement: https://legal.linkedin.com/dpa.\n\nXing: Social network; Service provider: XING AG, Dammtorstraße 29-32, 20354 Hamburg, Germany; Website: https://www.xing.de; Datenschutzerklärung: https://privacy.xing.com/de/datenschutzerklaerung."
