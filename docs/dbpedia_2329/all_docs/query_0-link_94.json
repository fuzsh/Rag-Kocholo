The integration of NBS Chorus and Autodesk RevitÂ® allows users to develop their model and specification simultaneously, which greatly reduces the risk of information becoming out of sync and enables users to work smarter and more safely. Chorus also integrates with Autodesk 360, Common Data Environment.\n\nTHE STORY SO FAR\n\nINTELLIGENT SPECIFICATION WRITING\n\nInternational design practice Ryder Architecture was the first NBS customer to produce a specification using NBS Chorus, the cloud-based platform. Transitioning from Microsoft Word (their previous specification writing tool) to NBS Chorus has been a step change for Ryder, and has brought the process of specification writing into the 21st century.\n\nREAD THEIR STORY"
