Introduction\n\nScientific discoveries are emerging at an accelerated pace, presenting new frontiers for exploration and stimulating innovation and economic growth. The conduct of science and engineering is changing and evolving, in part, due to the expansion of networked cyberinfrastructure and new technologies, such as computational modeling, sensor networks and visualization environments. These enable observation, analysis and modeling of increasingly complex systems across multiple disciplines and scales. These technologies are making possible deeper understanding of phenomena in science and engineering; for example, helping to explain how networks of cells communicate, how simple human interactions yield complex, collective behavior, and how physical, chemical, biological and socio-economic processes interact to determine how the climate system evolves at global and regional scales.\n\nAs new scientific opportunities emerge, the Nation's research facility requirements also evolve and change. Based on a 2005 study, NSF estimates, academic institutions have at least $3.6 billion in deferred projects to repair and renovate science and engineering research space (FY 2005 Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities.) Renovations can be of many kinds, from updated wet labs and improved retractable roofs for telescopes to new telecommunications capabilities and network connections. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides $200 million for NSF to fund the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI-R²) Program, which is designed to support 21st century research and research training infrastructure in our Nation's academic institutions, independent non-profit research museums, independent non-profit research laboratories, and non-profit research consortia. This will enable the transformation of the science and engineering research enterprise at many institutions.\n\nII. Program Description\n\nThe purpose of this program is to enhance the Nation's existing research facilities so that they provide next-generation research infrastructure and facilitate the integration of researchers with shared resources such as remote instruments and research platforms, data repositories, and national computing facilities.\n\nThe program encompasses improvement(s) of research facilities, i.e., repair or renovation or, in exceptional cases, replacement of shared scientific and engineering research and research training space, and its underlying infrastructure. Underlying infrastructure may include:\n\nRoutine sustaining infrastructure (e.g., laboratory electrical and plumbing systems, etc.);\n\nSupporting equipment, i.e., basic durable components of a research facility that are integral to its operation (e.g., clean rooms, retractable roofs, etc.); and\n\nNetwork connectivity among research facilities, including circuit access or fiber deployment and the associated hardware and software.\n\nThe term \"research facilities\" refers to existing shared space where sponsored and/or unsponsored research activities and research training take place, either in \"bricks and mortar,\" mobile or virtual research space.\n\nThe intent of this program is to revitalize existing research facilities. Funding will be limited to facilities where research and research training activities focus on NSF-supported fields of science and engineering. ARI-R² provides support for improvement of physical space, the mechanical systems of buildings and fixed equipment that is built into and generic to the research facility, not free-standing equipment. It is not the intent of the ARI-R² Program to fund: 1) new construction; 2) faculty or student offices, classrooms, seminar or conference rooms or other space facilities not devoted to scientific, engineering or educational research; or 3) basic building requirements such as elevators, loading/delivery areas or restrooms. In addition, the program will not support acquisition/development/installation of specific research instrumentation for, or the operation and maintenance of, the research facilities.\n\nGoals: Consistent with NSF's mission to strengthen the U.S. science and engineering enterprise, the ARI-R² program's goals are to:\n\nUpdate existing research facilities at institutions of higher education (including graduate and undergraduate institutions, among which are included community colleges) and other non-profit research organizations (e.g., independent research museums, independent research laboratories, and research consortia) in order to support research that can address the challenges of the 21st century.\n\nEnable academic departments, disciplinary and cross-disciplinary units, or multi-organization consortia to renovate research facilities through the addition or augmentation of cyberinfrastructure, other than general-purpose computing systems or data storage systems, to create environments that enhance research and integrate research with education.\n\nImprove access to and increase use of next-generation research facilities for researchers, educators and students.\n\nAssist research organizations, including those that have historically received limited Federal research and development funds, to improve their science and engineering research environments.\n\nWeb-page: It is anticipated that a list of answers to frequently asked questions will be posted several weeks after the release of this solicitation. Proposing organizations are encouraged to check the OIA web-page, https://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=OIA, for a link to this list.\n\nIII. Award Information\n\nApproximately 100 awards ranging from a total of $250,000 to $2,000,000; approximately 6-10 awards ranging from a total of over $2 million to $5 million; approximately 3-5 awards ranging from a total of over $5 million to $10 million. The award duration for ARI-R² grants up to $2 million is up to three years; award duration for grants over $2 million up to $10 million is up to four years.\n\nIV. Eligibility Information\n\nOrganization Limit:\n\nProposals may only be submitted by the following:\n\nUniversities and two- and four-year colleges (including community colleges) accredited in, and having a campus located in, the United States, its territories and possessions. Distinct academic campuses (that award their own degrees, have independent administrative structures, admissions policies, alumni associations, etc.) within multi-campus systems qualify as separate institutions.\n\nIndependent non-profit research museums, independent non-profit research institutions and laboratories, and non-profit research consortia located in the United States, its territories and possessions. These organizations must have an independent administrative and financial structure. Non-profit research consortia must also have 501(c)(3) tax status. Any organization can collaborate in a consortium; however, only eligible organizations can receive NSF funds.\n\nOrganizations that may NOT receive funds include foreign organizations (e.g., foreign academic institutions, museums and laboratories); research arms of for-profit firms; and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs). Construction, engineering, architecture and other facility service divisions of for-profit firms that will carry out the work of renovation and repair may receive NSF funds as sub-awards. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 states that funds may not be used by any State or local government, or any private entity, for any casino or other gambling establishment, aquarium, zoo, golf course, or swimming pool.\n\nPI Limit:\n\nNone Specified\n\nLimit on Number of Proposals per Organization:\n\nOne (1), either as the lead organization or as a sub-awardee but not both. Sub-awards solely for the provision of a widely recognized commercial service, for example, architectural design, construction, or telecommunications services, are not subject to this restriction.\n\nCollaborative proposals are welcome.

Two documents are required for proposal submission. The first document is Standard Form (SF) 424C Budget Information - Construction Programs, which is to be submitted as a supplemental document to provide detailed construction and associated costs of the proposed project's repair, renovation, or in exceptional cases, replacement activities. SF424C can be accessed at https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/docs/sf424c.pdf. The second required document is the NSF budget described in the GPG. You will need to complete SF424C prior to completing the NSF budget form in FastLane. The only cost item listed in the NSF budget form 1030 should be \"Other Direct Costs\" which should be carried over from the SF424C form. If a non-zero amount is included in Line 11, column C, of SF424C, then a detailed description of these costs and the basis of their estimation should be included in the Budget Justification section. If a non-zero amount is included in Line 13, column C, of SF424C, then a detailed description of the basis of their estimation should be included in the Budget Justification section. For guidance on completing SF424C, see specific instructions below.\n\na. Eligible Project Costs. Eligible project costs are those total project costs properly and reasonably allocable to the renovation of the existing research facility based on percentage of time or space or combination thereof that the facility is used for research and research training. Eligible project costs may include: architecture and engineering services, surveys, testing, inspections, relocation, demolition, removal, construction, fixed equipment, and related construction management costs. These costs are limited to the repair, renovation, or in exceptional cases, replacement of the research facilities and may not include costs of upgrading basic building requirements (e.g., building elevators) or spaces not devoted to research (e.g., classrooms and personal offices). It is not the intent of this program to fund new construction. It is expected that the submitting organization has all preliminary line drawings and plans, together with the appropriate estimates of in-house or vendor cost. This program does not fund a) any research and research training activities, b) facility operation and/or maintenance costs, c) indirect costs, and d) salary costs of submission-eligible organizations' employees. (Sub-awards solely for the provision of a widely recognized commercial service, for example, architectural design, construction, or telecommunications services, are not subject to restriction d.) Proposers should include in their budgets sufficient contingency (i.e., escalation of cost plan) to address cost, schedule and performance risks and describe the procedures and criteria by which the expenditures of contingency funds will be authorized.\n\nb.

The Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) must electronically sign the proposal Cover Sheet to submit the required proposal certifications (see Chapter II, Section C of the Grant Proposal Guide for a listing of the certifications). The AOR must provide the required electronic certifications within five working days following the electronic submission of the proposal. Further instructions regarding this process are available on the FastLane Website at: https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/fastlane.jsp.\n\nVI. NSF Proposal Processing And Review Procedures\n\nProposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.\n\nA. NSF Merit Review Criteria\n\nAll NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.\n\nThe two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgements.\n\nWhat is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?\n\nHow important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?\n\nWhat are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?\n\nHow well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?\n\nExamples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf.\n\nMentoring activities provided to postdoctoral researchers supported on the project, as described in a one-page supplementary document, will be evaluated under the Broader Impacts criterion."
