        "text": "General Requirements\n\nIndiana does not have any one single, comprehensive business license. However, all businesses operating in Indiana are subject to regulatory requirements that may involve several state agencies. Businesses that are starting, expanding, hiring employees for the first time, changing ownership or organizational structure, or moving into Indiana will need to consider the areas listed in this section.\n\nIn addition to the general requirements, certain types of businesses will be subject to specific licensing or permitting requirements. Although the most common permits and licenses are mentioned in this document, it is always advisable to contact the State Information Center at 317-233-0800, 800-45-STATE to discuss the most current requirements for any individual business.\n\nBusiness Structure\n\nThe first decision you must make is what type of business organizational structure will best meet the business owner's goals. The organizational structure of a business entity will determine what must be done to officially \"form\" the entity, how taxes are paid, and many other details that will affect its day-today operation. The types of structure, formal and informal, and their corresponding filing requirements are outlined below.\n\nThere are financial and legal advantages and disadvantages to each type of business organization. Anyone unsure of which structure will be best for any business should attend a \"Starting a Business Workshop\" offered by one of the assistance providers listed in Section IV. Additionally, paid professional assistance may be needed.\n\nFormal Business Entities\n\nThese more formal business types require some filing with the Secretary of State, Corporations Division. It is strongly suggested that individuals consult an attorney before forming a formal business entity. All filings and Reports for formal business entities should be sent to:\n\nIndiana Secretary of State, Business Service Division\n\n302 W Washington Street, Room E018 | Indianapolis, IN 46204\n\n(317) 234-9768\n\nInformation Line & Front Desk Hours: 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday (except state holidays)\n\nCorporations\n\nDomestic Corporations: To form this most complicated type of business organization, Articles of Incorporation must be filed and shares of stock must be issued. Prospective shareholders exchange money, property, or both, for the corporation’s capital stock. A corporation can be formed for profit or non-profit purposes. Forming a corporation creates a specific legal entity, and only one corporation can use any specific name.\n\nCorporate names may be reserved for 120 days with the Secretary of State. According to Federal guidelines the profits of a corporation is taxed to the corporation when earned, and then is taxed to the shareholders when distributed as dividends. However, shareholders cannot deduct any loss of the corporation, because losses are deductible only at the corporate level, therefore not from their personal tax filings.\n\nS Corporations: An eligible domestic corporation can avoid double taxation (once to the corporation and again to the shareholders) by electing to be treated as an S corporation. This is a separate legal and taxable entity, and can have no more than 100 owners. Generally, an S Corp is exempt from federal income tax other than tax on certain capital gains and passive income. An additional requirement is a Federal Employer Identification (EIN). Further, according to federal guidelines, in order to obtain SCorporation status the federal form 2553 is required to be filed with the IRS.\n\nA Corporation doing business in a name other than the name listed on the Articles of Incorporation must file a Certificate of Assumed Business Name with the County Recorder and the Office of the Secretary of State.\n\nAll types of corporations, business corporations, professional corporations, C Corporations, and Subchapter S Corporations have essentially the same filing requirements. They may have different tax responsibilities, but they are still corporations. Professional corporations will be required to file a certificate of registration showing that the professional is licensed in Indiana.\n\nBy definition, corporations usually have employees, even if those employees own all of the stock. Therefore, forming a corporation will entail that you cover the issues outlined in Section I-C Additional Employer Responsibilities.\n\nForeign Corporations: If a business is already incorporated in another state and is \"doing business\" in Indiana as defined by the Indiana Code, then it must obtain a Certificate of Authority from the Secretary of State to do business in Indiana as a foreign corporation.\n\nAll Corporations: Beginning January 1, 1997, all domestic and foreign business entities except for nonprofit corporations and limited partnerships are required to file biennial reports. A business entity must file a biennial report two years after the initial corporation filing has been completed, even if no business is being conducted.\n\nThe report must be filed with the Secretary of State by the end of the month in which the entity was incorporated, every second year following the year of incorporation. (If incorporated in even year, the Report is filed every even year. If incorporated in odd year, the report is filed every odd year.) The filing fee for these biennial filings is $30.00. Non-profit corporations file annual reports with a $10.00 filing fee.\n\nUnincorporated Entities\n\nLimited Liability Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies, and Limited Partnerships are unincorporated entities, but they are still formally organized entities. A brief explanation of each type is listed below.\n\nLimited Liability Partnership: A hybrid form of a general partnership. In general, liabilities are limited.\n\nLimited Partnership: A form of partnership in which liabilities are limited to general partners, while limited partners’ liability is limited to their agreed investment in the business.\n\nLimited Liability Company: A limited liability company (LLC) is an entity formed under state law by filing articles of organization as n LLC. None of the member of an LLC are personally liable for its debts. AN LLC may be classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership, a corporation, or an entity dis-regarded as an entity separate from its owner by applying the rules in federal regulations section 301.7701.3.\n\nA Limited Liability Company must file (State Form 49459) from the Secretary of States Office to establish articles of organization. There are no specific forms to be filed to create the other entities listed, but certain information is required by law to be filed with the Secretary of State's Office. Forms for these entities are commonly created by attorneys. Limited Liability Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies are required to file biennial reports as described for corporations, but Limited Partnerships have no yearly filing requirements.\n\nLimited Liability Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies, and Limited Partnerships which are based outside of Indiana will need to file a Certificate of authority to do business in Indiana, similar to what foreign corporations file. (There is no established state form for this.) Likewise, is these entities are doing business in a name other than the one filed with the Secretary of State's Office, they will need to file a Certificate of Assumed Business Name with the Secretary of State and County Recorder as well.\n\nLess Formal Entities\n\nLess formal organizations do not require filings with state government to come into existence. If, however, the business name does not contain the owner's (owners') name(s), it must be recorded with the Recorder of the county in which the business is located. Registration of a business name does not protect the name from being used by another business. Form: Provided by County Recorder, created by an attorney, or use generic format shown in Appendix A.\n\nSole Proprietorship\n\nThis type of business entity has a single owner, with no exemptions he/she is liable for all debts incurred. The owner and the business is one single entity. The owner is personally liable for anything that happens with the business. Income and expenses of the business on their personal tax return. It is the simplest form of business organization to start and maintain. Its liabilities are the owner’s personal liabilities.\n\nFederal and State income taxes are reported on the proprietor's (owner's) individual income tax return as self-employment taxes. The profits of the business are taxed to the owner on his/her 1040 Schedule (federal) annually, and the income is taxed only once.\n\nGeneral Partnership\n\nPartnerships have two or more owners who both contribute money, labor and skills. The partners are jointly and severally liable for debts and share proportionately in profits. Income and expenses of the business are filed on the partnership return (Form IT-65), and income taxes are reported on individual tax returns. In general, partnerships function like sole proprietorships with more than one owner.\n\nA partnership must file and annual information return to report the income deductions, gains, loses, etc., from its operations, but it does not pay income tax. Instead, it passes through any profits or losses to its partners. Each partner includes his/her share of the partnership’s items on his/her federal tax return.\n\nNon-Profit Entities\n\nNon-Profit entities can be organized formally or informally, but it is important to know the tax-related requirements before setting up the entity. Otherwise, the company may have to dissolve itself and reorganize to comply with rules to obtain the tax status it needs to operate. Contact the Indiana Department of Revenue for state requirements to obtain a not-for-profit tax registration certificate and the IRS for federal requirements to obtain non-profit (commonly known as 501(c)(3)) status. The IRS publishes an information booklet entitled \"Tax Exempt Status For Your Organization\", publication #557 which is available upon request. Contact:\n\nInternal Revenue Service\n\n(800) 829-3676\n\nIndiana Department of Revenue, Compliance Division\n\n100 N Senate Ave. | Indianapolis, IN 46204\n\nEstablishing Tax Accounts\n\nFederal Tax Information\n\nAny business with employees must have an Employer Identification Number (EIN) which identifies the tax accounts of employers, corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies with more than one owner, estates, trusts and other entities. Under federal guidelines, you also need an EIN if you have a qualified retirement plan, operate your business as a corporation or partnership, or file employment taxes, or excise taxes.\n\nYou should have only one EIN. To obtain an EIN, call the Internal Revenue Service for Form SS-4. Complete the form, and then either mail the form to the IRS, or call to receive your number. Business owners may also be required to file self employment taxes quarterly. Contact the IRS for its publications 533 and 509 on self-employment taxes. If the business does not have employees and does not expect to have any, the IRS may not allow the business to obtain an EIN. In such a case, the business owner's social security number is used as the Federal Tax Identification Number.\n\nInternal Revenue Service\n\n(800) 829-4933 (EIN General Info)\n\n(800) 829-3676 (Form Info)\n\n(859) 669-5987 (Fax)\n\n(800) 829-1040 (General Information Number)\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/ (Enter EIN in Search Box)\n\nState Tax Information\n\nRegistration for Sales, Use, and Income Taxes\n\nHow to Register: A single application (Form BT-1) is used to register with the Indiana Department of Revenue for sales tax, withholding tax, food & beverage tax, county innkeeper tax, motor vehicle rental excise tax, and prepaid sales tax on gasoline. A separate application is required for each business location. There is a $25.00 non refundable application fee for a Retail Merchants Certificate. BT1/Business Tax Application: www.in.gov/dor (On line Services).\n\nSales Tax - Retail Merchants Certificate: Any individual or business entity engaged in the selling or transferring of tangible personal property is considered a retail merchant and is required to be registered as such (by filing Form BT-1) with the Indiana Department of Revenue. Registering as a retail merchant accomplishes what people commonly refer to as \"getting a tax ID number\" or \"getting a tax-exempt number.\" The information regarding sales and use taxes should be read carefully, keeping in mind that taxes cannot be avoided on items which will not be resold.\n\nOnce registered as a retail merchant, the Department of Revenue will assign a tax identification number and will issue the appropriate Sales Tax Returns (ST103). The Department will also determine the business' filing status based upon anticipated sales. For additional information regarding sales or use taxes, contact the main office listed here or see one of the regional offices listed in Appendix C.\n\nIndiana Department of Revenue\n\n100 N Senate Ave. | Indianapolis, IN 46204\n\n(317) 233-2240\n\nSales Tax Exemption Certificates: Any individual or business entity registered as a retail merchant may issue exemption certificates and purchase, tax exempt, any items being purchased for re-sale or items being incorporated into a final product (manufacturing) please include state form ST105. Registered retail merchants must assess Indiana sales tax on the sale of tangible personal property unless the buyer presents a valid exemption certificate to the seller. The exemption certificate must be legible, signed, and include the tax-exempt number of the buyer. You cannot use another business entity’s tax exempt number on their behalf.\n\nAny business or individual registered as a retail merchant may issue an exemption certificate and purchase tangible personal property exempt from sales tax when the property is:\n\npurchased for resale;\n\nincorporated into property being resold;\n\ndirectly used in the manufacturing of tangible personal property to be sold; or\n\notherwise exempt by statute.\n\nIndiana Use Tax: Under Indiana law, use tax is imposed upon the use, storage, or consumption of tangible personal property in Indiana where the property was acquired in a retail transaction and sales tax was not paid at the point of purchase. The Indiana use tax rate is 7% as of April 1, 2008. Indiana use tax does not apply to property purchased for re-sale, or for property exempted by statute.\n\nCommon examples of items subject to Indiana use tax include magazine subscriptions, office supplies, property used or consumed outside the scope of production, and property purchased from out of state vendors. Indiana use tax applies to all residents of Indiana and is not limited to business entities. Registered retail merchants must report and pay the use tax due on the ST-103, Indiana Sales Tax return. Business entities that are not retail merchants must report and pay the use tax due on the income tax return of the entity or on a ST-115. Individuals must report and pay the use tax due on their individual income tax return (IT-40). Forms: ST-103, ST-115, IT-40.\n\nWithholding Tax: Employers are considered to be withholding agents if they:\n\nmake payments of salaries, wages, tips, fees, bonuses, and commissions that are subject to Indiana state and/or county taxes, and\n\nare required by the Internal Revenue Code to withhold federal income tax on those types of payments.\n\nWithholding agents are required to register with the Indiana Department of Revenue (by filing Form BT-1: no fee required) and to withhold state income tax and county income tax, if applicable, from the income of all employees. Independent contractors are required to file quarterly estimated income tax payments. See Section I-C for more details regarding the difference between an employee and an independent contractor.\n\nOnce registered as a withholding agent, the Department of Revenue will issue WH-1s, the withholding tax returns, and will determine the filing status, based upon the anticipated monthly wages paid to Indiana employees. After a tax year ends, all Indiana withholding agents are required to complete and to file an annual reconciliation form, WH-3, by February 28 of the following year. For more information, contact:\n\nIndiana Department of Revenue\n\n100 N Senate Ave. | Indianapolis, IN 46204\n\nCorporate Income Tax: Except as otherwise provided, a corporation doing business in Indiana, other than a corporation defined as a taxpayer under IC 6-5.5-1-17, is subject to gross income tax, adjusted gross income tax, and supplemental net income tax. There are three types of corporate income tax returns in Indiana. They are:\n\nIT-20 Income Tax Return: Filed by a corporation doing business in Indiana, subject to gross income tax, adjusted gross income tax, and supplemental net income tax.\n\nIT-20S Income Tax Return: Filed by a corporation doing business in Indiana that qualifies as a Sub S Corporation per the Internal Revenue Code. This is an information return for the corporation. No tax is paid with this return; the shareholders report their share of the income on their individual income tax returns. The 1120S income tax return must be filed for federal purposes in order to file the IT-20S.\n\nIT-20SC Income Tax Return: Filed by a corporation doing business in Indiana that qualifies as a Sub S Corporation per the Internal Revenue Code, but elects to be treated as a special corporation in Indiana, paying adjusted gross income tax and supplemental net income tax with the return. In order to file the IT-20SC, the Federal Form 1120 must be filed with the IRS. For more information regarding corporate taxes, contact:\n\nIndiana Department of Revenue\n\nPO Box 7206 | Indianapolis, IN 46207-7206\n\n(317) 233-0129\n\nIndividual Income Tax: Individual taxes are paid by an individual operating an unincorporated business (an independent contractor or general partner). Estimated tax payments must be made by an individual who:\n\nreceives income from which Indiana adjusted gross income tax, county adjusted gross income tax, county income tax, or county economic income tax is not properly withheld; and has an annual income tax liability that is $1,000 as of January 1, 2008.\n\nEven if an individual does not meet these requirements, the individual may still make estimated installment payments to reduce the amount, which will be due when the annual individual adjusted gross income tax return (Form IT-40) is filed.\n\nInstallment payments may be made by using IT-40ES tax vouchers. The four installment payments are due on April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15 following the last month of the tax year. For more information regarding individual income tax, contact:\n\nIndiana Department of Revenue\n\n100 N Senate Ave. | Indianapolis, IN 46204\n\n(317) 232-2240 (Individual Income)\n\nProperty Taxes\n\nPersonal property taxes are levied against equipment used in the production of income or held as an investment; billboards; foundations for the equipment; and all other tangible property other than real property. Computer application software is considered an intangible asset and is not assessable. Inventory is no longer taxed.\n\nPersonal property values are assessed March 1 of every year and are self reported by property owners to assessors using prescribed state forms. The completed personal property return must be filed with the assessors no later than May 15. Taxes on the reported values are due in two installments - May 10 and November 10 - the following year.\n\nMajor exemptions include air and water pollution control equipment; property used for educational, scientific, literary, or charitable purposes; inventory located within an enterprise zone; certain property stored in a warehouse pending shipment out of state; and imports and exports stored in a Foreign Trade Zone. Keep in mind that some of these instances require the filing of specific forms to acquire the exemption. For more information, contact:\n\nDepartment of Local Government Finance, Assessment Division\n\n100 N Senate Ave. Room N1058 | Indianapolis, IN 46204\n\n(317) 232-3777\n\nAs of March 1, 2009, campers and recreational vehicles were no longer subject to personal property taxation. In 2010, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles began collecting excise tax on the recreational vehicle when license plates are purchased.\n\nAdditional Employer Responsibilities\n\nEmployment may be defined differently by laws regarding taxes, worker compensation, labor, and unemployment. Often, a worker's status as an employee is dependent on how much work is performed and how wages are paid. Some laws use tests involving the amount of control the payer has over how, where,and when the work is done. The IRS has Publication 15A, which outlines the criteria it uses to make the determination of whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.\n\nThe term \"independent contractor\" is used to refer to a business, a business owner with employees, or a self-employed business owner with no employees. This should not confuse the issue of employer responsibilities. If you have employees, you are responsible for them. If you are unsure of whether someone who performs services for you is an employee or independent contractor, consult each agency listed in this section to be sure of which definitions apply for which purposes.\n\nUnemployment Insurance\n\nEmployer Registration If you are an employer, you must register with DWD during the first quarter you are liable to pay premiums. You can register online using our online Uplink Employer Self Service program, at https://uplink.in.gov/ESS/ESSLogon.htm. The Uplink Employer Self Service System gives you immediate access to services and information online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nUplink Employer Self Service allows you to do the following online:\n\nRegister as a new employer\n\nReview and maintain unemployment insurance account information\n\nSubmit quarterly unemployment insurance contribution reports\n\nMake payments by e-check and credit card (certain fees apply)\n\nIf you are an employer with an existing SUTA account number be sure to check the ‘Yes’ option button on the first screen after clicking ‘New User’ on the Employer Self Service logon screen. To register an existing account, you will need your FEIN number, your SUTA number, and the total gross wages from your last quarter.\n\nYou may also register by completing State Form 2837 (Report to Determine Status), which is located at www.in.gov/dwd/2406.htm or call DWD at (800) 437-9136 and request the form be mailed to you.

If correct premiums are not paid on time interest and penalties will be charged. For detailed information please see our Employer Handbook (http://www.in.gov/dwd/2614.htm).\n\nWorker's Compensation\n\nAll Indiana employers must obtain worker's compensation from a private insurance carrier. If an injury to an employee occurs and results in more than one day away from work, the employer must electronically file an Indiana Worker's Compensation First Report of Employee Injury, Illness.\n\nCertification of Independent Contractor Status and Worker's Compensation Exemption: Independent contractors in the construction and building trade are required to apply to the Indiana Department of Revenue for certification of independent contractor status. Clearance must first be received from the Department of Revenue before the Worker's Compensation Board may process an application for exemption.\n\nThe independent contractor must certify that he or she has worker's compensation coverage for all employees in accordance with IC 22-3-2 through IC 22-3-6 and that the independent contractor desires to be exempt from being able to recover under the worker's compensation policy or self-insurance of an individual for whom the independent contractor will perform work only as an independent contractor. There is a seven (7) day waiting period before a certificate can be validated. The fee for each certificate is $20.\n\nDepartment of Revenue Titles & Licensing\n\nPO Box 6072 | Indianapolis, IN 46206-6072\n\n(317) 232-5977\n\nWorker's Compensation Board\n\n402 W.

IDEM encourages businesses planning a project to contact the agency to understand regulatory requirements and to help IDEM understand the project time frames. IDEM has permit review deadlines to provide efficient service within a reasonable time frame. These time frames vary depending on the type of permit, so early planning and coordination are essential. Failing to obtain the necessary permits can result in substantial fines. IDEM has developed an Internet based plain English environmental permit guide that can help your business or organization identify the types of permits or approvals you may need from IDEM. Contact:\n\nDepartment of Environmental Management\n\n100 North Senate Avenue/PO Box 6015\n\nIndianapolis, IN 46204\n\n(317) 232-8603 or (800) 451-6027\n\nThe Compliance and Technical Assistance Program provides assistance to businesses and communities to help them achieve regulatory compliance.

For more information contact the Office of Pollution Prevention and Technical Assistance (OPPTA), at (800) 988-7901 or visit the website at http://www.in.gov/idem/recycle\n\nAir Permits\n\nFederal regulations require air permits to construct and operate new facilities, and to modify existing facilities for any businesses that emit specific amounts of air pollutants (lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, etc.). Operations that do not exceed the specific amounts may still need to register with IDEM. Facilities that emit toxic pollutants, such as arsenic, asbestos, beryllium, benzene, mercury, vinyl chloride and coke oven emissions, may also need these permits. Demolition or renovation of buildings containing asbestos or removal of asbestos from buildings requires a permit. Worker certification in asbestos removal is also necessary.\n\nWater Permits\n\nWater permits are needed by facilities that discharge pollutants to surface water or discharge storm water to storm sewers or surface water. Such facilities include:\n\nwastewater treatment plants,\n\nindustrial wastewater facilities,\n\nfacilities that discharge storm water,\n\nfacilities with runoff associated with industrial activity, and\n\nstorm water runoff from activities such as landscaping or construction that affect at least five acres.\n\nSolid & Hazardous Waste Permits\n\nSolid Waste Permits: Construction, Operation and Modification Permits are needed by industries that build, operate or want to expand solid waste facilities. Disposal of solid waste at an industry-owned location also requires a solid waste permit. Solid waste facilities include:\n\nsanitary landfills,\n\nconstruction/demolition disposal sites,\n\nrestricted waste sites,\n\nsolid waste processing facilities and transfer stations,\n\nincinerators, and\n\ninfectious waste incinerators.\n\nSolid wastes that do not require a solid waste permit (but are regulated through water permits) are solid and dissolved material in domestic sewage, irrigation return flows, or industrial discharges. Manure and crop residue used, as fertilizer or soil conditioners are not regulated if applied where the waste was generated.\n\nSpecial Waste Permits: Disposal of special wastes requires prior approval from IDEM. These wastes include sludge, industrial process waste, pollution control waste, and contaminated soil, residue or debris resulting from the cleanup of a spill involving these wastes. Wastes that do not require approval from IDEM are coal ash, demolition and construction debris, and industrial or commercial waste similar to household waste (paper, cardboard, plastic, wood, metal scrap, etc.).\n\nHazardous Waste Permits: Businesses that generate or transport hazardous wastes must follow hazardous waste regulations. Businesses that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste require a permit. A solid waste is a hazardous waste if the waste is not excluded as a hazardous waste in the Code of Federal Regulations and meets the criteria of a hazardous waste.\n\nOther Permits\n\nUnderground Storage Tanks: Facilities with underground storage tanks containing a regulated petroleum product or hazardous waste substance must register the tanks with IDEM. Registration is not required for underground heating oil tanks.\n\nPublic Water Supply Program: Industries that supply water from their own sources (e.g., wells) to employees must do regular monitoring for all drinking water contaminants. IDEM has a standard monitoring framework for this program. However, no permit is required.\n\nWorking in Wetlands\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) are the principal agencies that regulate wetlands and administer various permit programs.\n\nThe Federal Clean Water Act requires a permit from the Corps of Engineers’ (COE) for dredging and filling in water bodies including wetlands. The EPA has developed guidelines for COE to use in evaluating dredge spoil disposal sites and has the authority to prohibit use of particular sites. IDEM reviews all the Corps of Engineers' Section 404 dredge-and-fill applications to ensure that the proposed activities will not adversely affect water quality. IDEM must issue a Section 401 Water Quality Certification before the federal permit or license can be granted. If wetlands are located along streams, rivers, and natural lakes, disturbances to these wetlands may also require a permit form the Department of Natural Resources. Both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers District Office and the DNR should be contacted regarding construction activities, such as filling, dredging, or draining in wetlands. For more information, contact:\n\nCorps of Engineers\n\nLouisville District - (502) 315-6733\n\nDetroit District - (313) 226-2218\n\nChicago District - (312) 846-5530\n\nIndiana Department of Environmental Management\n\n(317) 232-8603 or (800) 451-6027\n\nDepartment of Natural Resources | Division of Fish and Wildlife, Environmental Unit\n\n402 W. Washington Street, Room W273 | Indianapolis, IN 46204\n\n(317) 232-4080\n\nIsolated wetlands (those wetlands not regulated under the federal Clean Water Act) are regulated under Indiana's State Isolated Wetlands law. Impacts to isolated wetlands require State Isolated Wetland Permits from IDEM. Because the federal government's jurisdiction is different than the state's, IDEM must be contacted to determine which, if any, state authorization(s) is/are needed before an applicant may legally discharge pollutants (including fill materials) to wetlands, streams, rivers, lakes, and other waters of the state.\n\nFloodway (Flood Plain) Construction Permit: The Department of Natural Resources issues permits for construction, excavation, or filling in or on a floodway under the Flood Control Act which prohibits abodes or residences in or on a floodway. When construction activities are anticipated in or along streams and rivers the Division of Water should be contacted regarding permit requirements at the following address (Some DNR Dept. of Water Permits can now be submitted over the Internet, check out the following url for details).\n\nPermit Administration Section, Division of Water | Department of Natural Resources\n\n402 W.

Using Customer Self Service System (CS3), the state maintains a state wide data bank of qualified job seekers to meet the specialized needs of employers.\n\nEmployers may post jobs on-line through CS3 and access job seekers' work history and skills for any annual fee. Employers may also access prospective employees by submitting a job order to any local DWD office. (See Appendix D). Also, visit DWD's Internet site at http://www.in.gov/dwd.\n\nIndiana Department of Administration\n\nProcurement/Public Works: Any company, individual, partnership or corporation seeking to sell a product or service to the State of Indiana will need to obtain a Vendor Application (in or out of state). An out-of-state corporation will also need a Certificate of Authority from the Office of Secretary of State. For more information regarding sales to Indiana, contact:\n\nIndiana Department of Administration, Procurement Division\n\n402 W Washington Street Room W468 | Indianapolis, IN 46204\n\n(317) 234-3542\n\nhttp://www.in.gov/idoa/2464.htm (To register online to become a vendor)\n\nMinority & Women’s Business Enterprises Division: The Minority and Women's Business Enterprises Division (M/WBED) was created in order to ensure that Minority- and Women- owned businesses are given an equal opportunity to participate in the state purchasing process. The office is governed by the Governor's Commission on Minority and Women's Business Enterprises.\n\nEach year the Commission votes on contracting goals, which set the level of participation for minority and women-owned firms on state contracts. Their office reviews applications for certification, provides advocacy services and training opportunities and monitors state contracts for compliance.\n\nIn order to be certified as a Minority-owned or Women-owned Business, a minority or women (or both) must: Own 51% of the business, control the business enterprise and be a U.S. Citizen.\n\nThe Minority and Women's Business Enterprises Division provides advocacy services and training to its clients. Training opportunities and public outreach events are planned to keep the certified firms educated about the state purchasing process and contracting opportunities.\n\nThe M/WBED has Business Development Unit in which state contracts are randomly monitored to ensure that contract participation goals are being attained. In addition, they will investigate concerns that arise out of contract relationships. The Department of Administration has the authority to impose sanctions on contractors that are found in non-compliance. Their program actively promotes, monitors, and enforces the state's M/WBE participation goals.\n\nIf you feel that your firm would be eligible for certification, contact M/WBED office.\n\nMinority and Women's Business Enterprises Division\n\n402 W Washington Street Room W469 | Indianapolis, IN 46204\n\n(317) 232-3061\n\nAppendix A - Example of Business Name Registration Form\n\nFor persons (sole proprietorships, associations, or general partnerships) engaged in business under a name other than their own (DBA).
