        "text": "Ethics:\n\nHere at ARI, we approach archaeology from a perspective of ethical stewardship, responsibility, and equity. We believe that archaeological sites and cultural heritage are deserving of scientific research, empathy and preservation.\n\nInclusivity:\n\nHere at ARI we believe that all are welcome to learn and be involved in archaeology and we have made efforts towards this goal. All people from all backgrounds, ages, and professions are welcome to come join us at ARI in our journey to a brighter more informed future.\n\nAccessibility:\n\nWe do not use hard to understand jargon, the work we do is for everyone. We wish to make our research as accessible as possible and have projects in place to make it easier and easier to interact with archaeology. Our AR/VR project as well as our app and digital archive projects are all so that we can attract a bigger audience to archaeology and hopefully change the lives of all who come into contact with ARI.\n\nHealth & Safety:\n\nHere at ARI safety of our employees and visitors is our number one priority. We take steps starting with providing the proper tools and training to ensure the safety of everyone involved in our research, planning, and excavation activities.\n\nProfessional Development:\n\nLearning never stops. We expect employees and volunteers to continually learn and strive to be better. As an academic and educational institution we know that there are many ways to improve as both scholars and employees and we strive to do so. We will provide and take any and all opportunities to grow and better ourselves as scholars, employees and a company.\n\nThe Archaeological Research Institute (ARI) recognizes that the land we study and steward is the homeland of many peoples. We acknowledge the myaamia (Miami), Shawanwa (Shawnee), Peewaalia (Peoria), Kiikaapoi (Kickapoo) and the multitude of nations who call this their homelands.\n\nARI recognizes the violence inflicted upon the indigenous Nations of the Ohio Valley, including their forced removal following treaties such as Fort Finney and Greenville. ARI condemns the intentional destruction of their languages and cultures. ARI condemns the continuous discrimination against the living Native peoples throughout the United States.\n\nARI recognizes that these peoples are not of the past, but are vibrant living nations. ARI recognizes that Native Americans are a diverse, resilient people with a deep enduring history worth knowing. In that light ARI extends our respect to all Native peoples both past and present."
