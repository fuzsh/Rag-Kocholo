Their d but L.P. 'Cut' was produced by Dennis Bovell, (Janet Kay/The Pop Group/Madness) and released on Island records (1979). It is hailed as a unique, timeless relic, fusing Reggae, Punk, and World Music into a sound truly of their own making. Winning new fans over every year, it still sounds as innovative today as when first recorded, and inspired generations of women to pick up instruments and do it for themselves!\n\nThe Slits shared stages and tours with bands as diverse as The Clash, The Sex Pistols, Creation Rebel, Steel Pulse and jazz legend Don Cherry (to name a few). A biography - Typical Girls? The Story Of The Slits by Zoe Street Howe was published in the UK by Omnibus Press in July 2009, further stamping the band into the history of Punk. Remaining members Tessa Pollitt and Hollie Cook (daughter of Paul Cook, Sex Pistols) will be playing a special tribute dub reggae roots and dance-hall set. Hollie's new singles as a solo artist ( 'That Very Night' / 'Milk & Honey' and'Walking in The Sand') are available now (see her website below) and was produced by Prince Fatty. Her self titled d but album is released June 6th.\n\nAdrian Sherwood\n\nThe Slits last album Trapped Animal (2009) was produced by ONU Sounds Dub Guru, Adrian Sherwood. With a career spanning over 30years, Sherwood has worked with everyone from Lee Scratch Perry, Sly and Robbie, to Asian Dub foundation, Nine Inch Nails and many more. Adrian will also be there on the night playing a special set to honour the memory of The Slits fantastic front woman, along with other friends and fans of this phenomenal female role-model - Ari UP.\n\nMark Stewart\n\nMark Stewart started out in Bristol in 1978 as vocalist with the infamous militant gang of leftist musicians The Pop Group, whose dissonant sound spanned punk, free jazz, funk and dub reggae. The Pop Group played shows with The Slits sharing a drummer (Bruce Smith) and releasing a joint single, \"In The Beginning There was Rhythm\" / \"Where There's A Will\" (Y Records). Ari Up and Mark went on to be part of the New Age Steppers with Adrian Sherwood. Since The Pop Group Stewart has since made many genre breaking albums continually pushing music both solo and with The Maffia, Tackhead and New Age Steppers, as well as collaborating with artists such as Nine Inch Nails, Tricky, Chicks On Speed and many more. Mark will be selecting rewinding and DJ'ing a very special set of sounds in tribute to Ari.\n\nViv Albertine\n\nThe Slits Guitarist Viv Albertine began her career playing with the Flowers of Romance; which also featured Sid Vicious, (Sex Pistols ) and Keith Levene (Public Image) and future fellow Slit Palmolive. She then joined the Slits, bringing with her the trade mark angular guitar sound and feisty female attitude that was already awarding her a hefty reputation. So much so, Adrian Sherwood's dub-influenced collective, New Age Steppers snapped Viv up too. More recently Albertine released a four-song d but solo E.P. titled Flesh on Thurston Moore's (Sonic Youth) Ecstatic Peace! Label. And has been playing her new solo material live. Viv will be giving us a very special guest musical appearance and saying some special words about Ari.\n\nViso Nero\n\nTo open the evening is Bristol's own live electronics duo. V N have just released the Interstellar E.P (DubStep/Breaks/Beats) on ICG and toured the Netherlands with fellow Bristolian Zoon Van Snook to promote it, gaining radio play and coverage from BBC Bristol, Amsterdam FM & MerweRTV. They will be selecting a fine DJ set of old school Dub, Roots as well as rare Slits dub mixes, paying homage and fullest respect to Ari Up.\n\nV N along with Inner City Grit and Ari Up's close friends have helped to put together and curate the only tribute to Ari Up in the UK: A Punky Reggae Tribute to Ari Up\n\nTessa and Hollie will also be doing a DJ set and In-store appearance at Rise in Bristol, 4 - 6pm. The exclusive in-store appearance gives fans the chance to meet the two Slits, who will not only be DJ'ing but will be joined by Viv Albertine to offer you the chance to have your Slits related C.D's books and records signed. There will also be an alcohol license on the day giving the event a party vibe! This is the perfect warm up to the evenings main event.\n\nAt both events exclusive Slits t-shirts will be available, with all of the proceeds going towards The Breast Cancer Research Foundation.\n\nJoin our facebook event:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=199422410089474\n\nFor more info on the artists involved please visit the following sites:\n\nhttp://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_slits\n\nhttp://www.holliecook.com/\n\nhttp://www.adriansherwood.com\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/visonero\n\nhttp://www.innercitygritrecords.ithinkmusic.com http://www.thethunderbolt.net\n\nEntry requirements: — Read more — Read less"
