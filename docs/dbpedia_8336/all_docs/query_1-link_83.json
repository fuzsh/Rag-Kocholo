        "text": "Adam Rochman\n\nPartner & Vice President\n\nAdam Rochman is a Partner and the Vice President of Wildfire and Big Bowl Restaurants.\n\nAdam’s appreciation for food came at an early age. He recounts fondly, watching Jacques Pepin, Julia Child, and Martin Yan on Saturday afternoon television as a child. That appreciation for food grew to an interest in cooking, and soon after, recognition that working in the restaurant industry was what he wanted to do. Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago he was familiar with Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants and wanted to gain experience with the company to enhance his restaurant industry education.\n\nIn the spring of 1998 as a freshman at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, in the Hospitality Management program, Adam secured an internship at Shaw’s Seafood Grill in Deerfield. His experiences with Lettuce’s Internship program were the foundation for his career. He immediately felt welcomed into the Lettuce family and began to understand the organization’s culture that would later come to define his personal management style.\n\nUpon graduation in May of 2001, he returned home to Chicago. A meeting with Lettuce Partners, Bob Loeschorn and President of Wildfire, Howard Katz, proved to be a pivotal point in Adam’s life. He became a Manager at Wildfire Chicago and began to develop his own approach to management, taking on as much responsibility as he could. Two years later, he was asked to be part of the opening team for Wildfire’s fifth location in Schaumburg. He would spend the next three years in Schaumburg as an Assistant General Manager, mastering the practice of Wildfire systems and operations. In 2006, Adam was promoted to General Manager of Wildfire Glenview at the age of 26; it was a job that came with tremendous challenges and rewards. Over the next six years in Glenview, he created long-lasting relationships with hundreds of regular guests, while guiding a skilled, polished, and professional team.\n\nIn late 2012, Adam was promoted to Partner and Vice President of Wildfire Restaurants. Since then has been a divisional leader, instrumental in the growth and operations of all Wildfire and Big Bowl locations. In addition to food and beverage programs, operations, and guest experience, Adam's focus has been the further development of his management teams; guiding and teaching his managers, ensuring that as opportunities within the company become available, his managers are the strongest candidates for advancement.\n\nIn 2019 Lettuce Entertain You embarked upon a \"Digital Transformation\". The vision was to sunset aging technologies and replace them with best-in-class cloud-based solutions that would elevate the employee and guest experience for the near and long-term future of the organization. Serving as the overarching internal Project Manager, Adam worked with a small team to lead and support a cross-functional effort to evaluate, contract, design, configure, build, test, train and implement a significant portfolio of SaaS platforms. With the fundamental goal of improving the lives of Lettuce employees and the experience of our guests, the initiative led to updates to the Point of Sale System, Human Resources Information System, Time and Scheduling, Payroll, Enterprise Resource Planning, Online Ordering, Guest and Reservation Management, Applicant Tracking, and Benefits Administration.\n\nToday Adam works towards system optimization. Leveraging years of operational experience along with the subject matter expertise gained through system implementation, he looks to find ways to best use new technology, ensuring Lettuce is poised for growth. Adam is passionate about supporting restaurant operations and their operational leaders for the organization.\n\nAdam resides in the Lincoln Square neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago, and in his free time, he enjoys traveling, playing tennis, and following Cubs baseball.\n\nAmarit Dulyapaibul\n\nManaging Partner\n\nAmarit Dulyapaibul is a managing partner and oversees operations and development for the “San” brand of restaurants including four locations of Ramen-san, two locations of Sushi-san and The Omakase Room at Sushi-san.\n\nAt an early age, he began working at the restaurants his parents own and operate in downtown Chicago. Moving through the ranks, he started as a dishwasher, became a host, then a server and eventually transitioned to a manager role. Through this, Amarit has gained a tremendous amount of respect for all the hardworking individuals that devote their time to the industry.\n\nAfter graduating with a Master of Arts in Architecture from Tulane University, Amarit returned to Chicago to begin his career. Specializing in high-end residential design and construction, he developed his understanding of space, scale and atmosphere that would eventually prove instrumental in his success at Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants. After two years of design work, Amarit returned to hospitality.\n\nIn 2011, Amarit joined Lettuce as part of the team at Ben Pao. He spent time at several other concepts, including Foodlife and Foodease, to learn different styles of operations and management. Eventually, he came to work under the leadership of partners R.J., Jerrod, and Molly Melman at Paris Club Bistro & Bar and Studio Paris Nightclub.\n\nAmarit was promoted to General Manager of the 59 W. Hubbard building and oversaw the opening of Ramen-san in 2014, where he has consistently grown year-over-year revenues via delivery technologies and various strategic partnerships. In early 2016, Amarit helped open il Porcellino in the same building; in late 2017, he and the team opened nearby Sushi-san.\n\nToday, Amarit oversees operations and growth for the “San” brands, which includes Ramen-san Deluxe in Streeterville, Ramen-san in River North and Lincoln Park, and Ramen-san Whisky Bar in Fulton Market in addition to Sushi-san in River North and in the Willis Tower.\n\nAmarit and his partners opened The Omakase Room at Sushi-san, a unique omakase restaurant in Chicago's River North. Most recently, Amarit and his partners opened the fourth location of Ramen-san in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood.\n\nBorn and raised in the heart of Chicago, Amarit resides in downtown Chicago with his wife, Torie.\n\nBob Loeschorn\n\nVice President\n\nBob Loeschorn is Vice President of Big Bowl and Wildfire, two of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises’ most successful restaurant concepts, which have locations in Chicago, Oak Brook, Lincolnshire, Schaumburg, Glenview, Illinois, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, and McLean, VA.\n\nBob Loeschorn began his career with Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants in December 1986 as a manager of Lettuce’s Ed Debevic’s in Torrence, California. After opening the Beverly Hills Ed Debevic’s, Bob moved up the ranks quickly and was promoted to supervisor of the three Ed’s, located in Torrance, Beverly Hills and Phoenix, Arizona. In August of 1992, Bob assisted with the opening of Tucci Benucch in Minneapolis, Minnesota, followed by the Tucci opening in Seattle, Washington. In November of 1995, Bob relocated to Chicago to oversee the opening of Wildfire. As part of the development of Chicago’s Wildfire, he has acted as both the general manager and supervisor for the restaurant. Bob’s extensive commitment and dedication are evident in Wildfire’s success.\n\nLoeschorn has been in the restaurant business for 30 years beginning with his mom and dad’s motel and small New Hampshire restaurant. At age 19, his desire to explore led him to a Los Angeles catering company where Bob served guests ranging from Ronald Reagan to members of the L.A. Rams. Missing the restaurant atmosphere, Bob joined the staff at Los Angeles’ Victoria Station, where he held positions ranging from prep cook to regional kitchen manager and general manager in charge of west coast management training, over his 10 years of employment with Victoria Station. The restructuring of the company in November 1986 prompted Bob “to test the water outside of Victoria Station.” Bob has been with Lettuce ever since.\n\nBob, his wife Kimberly and their two children, Hannah and Charlie, reside in the Northern Suburbs of Chicago. In his spare time, he enjoys cycling, ice skating, skiing and traveling with his family.\n\nDon Carson\n\nRestaurateur\n\nThe restaurant business is in Don Carson’s blood. The son of legendary Chicago restaurateur Chris Carson, Don is also associated with one of the city’s other leading restaurant luminaries, Richard Melman.\n\nCarson, who oversaw operations at Don & Charlie’s eatery in Scottsdale, Arizona, is a Managing Partner in one of the nation’s leading restaurant organizations, Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants.\n\nCarson was raised in Rogers Park, on the North Side of Chicago. Growing up in a restaurant family, Carson remembers dining out three to four days a week as a young boy. While growing up eating, tasting and trying new food items, Carson learned to appreciate food that was prepared from scratch with no thought ever given to skimping on quality.\n\nAt the age of 10 Carson began his long career working at his father’s restaurants, opening and running various concepts for his father. In 1977, Carson teamed up with his mother, sister and two brothers and opened Carson’s Ribs in Skokie.\n\nIn 1982, Carson left Carson’s Ribs and joined Lettuce Entertain You. That Fall he and Rich Melman opened Don & Charlie’s in Scottsdale which soon became the hub of baseball during Spring Training. At Don & Charlie’s the goal was simple: Be the best you can be and always care for your guests. Nationally known for being synonymous with sports and hospitality, Don & Charlie’s enjoyed an almost 40 year run.\n\nGabino Sotelino\n\nChef Partner of Mon Ami Gabi and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!\n\nConsidered by many in the industry and the culinary community as one of the most respected leaders and owner/chefs in Chicago, it is no secret that the talent behind Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! and Mon Ami Gabi comes from Chef Gabino Sotelino, chef/partner of Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! and the four Mon Ami Gabi locations with Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants.\n\nA native of Spain, Sotelino was born to a Basque mother and a Galician father in Vigo, a city in northwestern Spain. At age nine, his family enrolled him in the San Francisco el Grande seminary in Madrid. His religious vocation lasted until he was 12 when he decided to leave and became a bellhop at the posh Hotel Ritz. After making enough detours through the kitchen, he landed a job on the cooking staff at age 14.\n\nFrom the Ritz, he moved to other top hotel kitchens throughout Europe including Plaza Athenee in Paris and Koons Hotel in Switzerland. He eventually joined Hilton International Hotels as part of a team opening hotels around the world including Hong Kong, London, Cairo, Istanbul, Tokyo, the Canary Islands as well as Montreal where he eventually stayed. After spending a year and a half working at the Montreal Exposition, Sotelino moved to the United States where he joined the Madison Hotel organization opening new hotels before becoming the executive chef at Capitol Hill Restaurants. His duties included service for special functions at the White House. Soon after, Le Perroquet called and his culinary contributions to the city of Chicago began.\n\nChicago embraced the talents of Sotelino upon his arrival in 1974 when he assumed the position and quickly established himself as the premier executive chef for the four-star restaurant Le Perroquet. In 1977, he met Richard Melman, Lettuce’s CEO and founder, who offered him a position as the chef for Lettuce's newly acquired restaurant, The Pump Room. Sotelino accepted and, as a master of his craft, soon turned the Pump Room into one of the finest restaurants in the Midwest.\n\nThe partnership between Sotelino and Melman flourished and they were soon planning the creation of Lettuce’s original fine dining restaurant, Ambria, which opened to rave reviews in 1980. In 1981, Gabino introduced Chicago to a true Parisian bistro with Un Grand Café (now Mon Ami Gabi, or “My Friend Gabino,”) a combination of Ambria’s quality cuisine with a more informal atmosphere.\n\nIn 1985, Melman gave Sotelino the opportunity to open another restaurant – Chicago’s first-ever tapas bar. Sotelino felt that the city of Chicago needed a taste of Spain in the restaurant scene, and he took great pride in representing the culture and gastronomy of his home to the people of Chicago. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has made tapas, the hot and cold appetizers of Spain, an integral element of Chicago’s dining scene.\n\nHaving garnered dozens of accolades since he opened Ambria in 1980, Sotelino’s Ambria was rated Chicago’s favorite restaurant by the 1998 Zagat guide. In 1997, Chef Sotelino was bestowed the Perrier-Jouet chef of the Midwest award by the James Beard Foundation, the most prestigious culinary award given in the United States. Gourmet magazine’s best restaurants in America listed Ambria as “one of the top tables in the Midwest” in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Gault Millau’s The Best of Chicago, called Sotelino “one of the most gifted chefs in the Midwest – and a lot of other towns as well,” and gave Ambria a rating of three toques. The Best of Chicago awarded only four restaurants with this honor, which was the highest given. Sotelino was also named “Chicago Chef of the Year” by the Chefs of America in 1990.\n\nWhile open, Ambria received a four-star ranking from Chicago Magazine, Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times. The American Automobile Association also rewarded Ambria the coveted five-diamond ranking. Ambria also swept first and second place honors in Zagat guides under food, service and ambiance categories for more than 12 consecutive years. Both Ambria and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba also made Chicago magazine’s list of Top 40 Restaurants Ever that the publication put together for its 40th anniversary issue in 2010.\n\nActive in community and industry affairs, Sotelino has been honored with some of the most prestigious awards. Sotelino was awarded the Medalla al Merito Nacional of Spain in 1990. It is the most distinguished award given by the king of Spain to a Spanish native living outside the country who has demonstrated outstanding service and contribution to his country. He has been honored with the Academie Culinaire de France, an award traditionally given to French national chefs for their outstanding contributions to the culinary arts of France-Sotelino was the first Spaniard to receive this prestigious French award. He is also a member of the Commanderie des Cordon Bleus de France, a select group of expert chefs chosen from around the world and is one of only three national chairpersons of the Grand Master Chefs Association. Sotelino has also held the highly regarded position of president of the Euro-Toques inc. USA Chapter.\n\nGeoff Alexander\n\nPresident and CEO of Wow Bao\n\nNine days after graduating from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1993, Geoff Alexander joined Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants.

Preparing food for holidays and celebrations year after year sparked her interest in cooking and enticed Janet to learn more about the culinary arts.\n\nJanet’s first job in a professional kitchen was as a dishwasher at a local catering company. She eagerly worked up to a cook position and continued growing with the company throughout high school and college. In 1993, Janet received a B.S. in Restaurant Management from the University of Illinois and her Culinary Arts degree from The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York in 1995.\n\nAfter school, Janet joined the team at Chicago’s iconic restaurant, Charlie Trotter’s. She spent most of her time in the pastry department, which led her to be the Assistant Pastry Chef at Danny Meyer’s Contemporary Indian Cuisine restaurant, Tabla, in New York City three years later. From there, Janet broadened her experience in other various positions including the Sous Chef at Café Lucy in Napa, Sous Chef and Executive Chef at Charlie Trotter’s, Trotter’s To-Go, and the Culinary Director at The Chopping Block in Chicago.\n\nIn July 2012, Janet joined Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants as the Executive Chef at Foodease in Water Tower Place, where she helped expand the concept through menu creation and operations. Three years later, Janet was influential in the opening of Beatrix Market in Streeterville, where she brought delicious, healthful, and homemade food to the restaurant. Beatrix Market now has four locations in Chicago as well as an airport location in Charlotte, North Carolina. Janet also oversees kitchen operations at RJ Grunts, Lettuce Entertain You’s original restaurant concept. Janet became a Partner in 2017 and then a Managing Partner in 2022.\n\nIn her free time, Janet enjoys cooking at home for family and friends, traveling with her husband, and watercolor painting.\n\nJeffrey Drazin\n\nManaging Partner\n\nJeffrey Drazin is a managing partner for the “San” brand of restaurants, including Ramen-San, Sushi-San and The Omakase Room. He also oversees operations for Il Porcellino, Bub City, Three Dots and a Dash, and R.J. Grunts. In addition to his work in the restaurants, Jeffrey is a Managing Partner for Windy City Smokeout. His love of bbq and country music makes this role one of his favorites.\n\nWithout a doubt, Jeffrey knew that he belonged in the hospitality industry. At age 16, he scooped ice cream at a Baskin-Robbins (where he learned there is no better flavor than Peanut Butter ‘n’ Chocolate), and during college, he worked at Ned Kelly’s steakhouse. There, Jeffrey discovered the different facets of restaurant life: He worked as a line and prep cook in the heat of the kitchen before eventually transitioning to the front of the house as a server. But it was his internship at Lettuce Entertain You’s restaurant Wildfire that made him realize restaurants are exactly where he was meant to be.\n\nAfter receiving his Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management from the University of Illinois in 2001, Jeffrey joined Lettuce as a manager at Wildfire in Minnesota. Under the leadership of the Wildfire partners, Jeffrey was mentored on how to run a successful restaurant. From there, he was part of the opening teams for three different Wildfires and landed as General Manager at the Lincolnshire location.\n\nIn 2014, Jeffrey moved to Lettuce’s Melman / Meers division of restaurants to oversee the 59 W. Hubbard building and, from there, he helped open il Porcellino, Sushi-San River North and Willis Tower, Ramen-San Fulton Market and Streeterville, Tallboy Taco and Lil’ Ba-Ba-Reeba. He enjoys opening new restaurants and is eager to continue to expand the “San” brand.\n\nUnder the guidance of partners R.J., Jerrod & Molly Melman as well as Chris Meers, Jeffrey has learned how to be a leader in the industry. He is very proud of his work in the division and is excited to continue training and developing his teams to create exceptional restaurants.\n\nJeffrey would not be where he is today without the love and support of his wonderful family and amazing wife, Allie. When not in the restaurants, Jeffrey enjoys spending time with his son, Emerson. He also loves traveling to far-off locations to explore new cultures and cuisines.\n\nJoe Decker\n\nVice President and Executive Chef of Wildfire\n\nJoe Decker is Vice President and Executive Chef of Wildfire. He currently oversees all Wildfire culinary operations in Chicago, Oak Brook, Glenview, Schaumburg, and Lincolnshire, IL, Minnesota, and Virginia locations. Joe was part of the initial team which developed the menu at the 1940’s-inspired dinner club. Signature dishes at Wildfire include Filet Medallion Trio, Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut, Wildfire Chopped Salad, Horseradish Crusted Filet Mignon, Roasted Prime Rib of Beef, and Cedar Planked Salmon. It prides itself on being ranked in the top five “Most Popular” restaurants in Chicago’s Zagat Guide.\n\nDecker, a Chicago native, got his start in the food business by volunteering to work for free at Ann’s Bakery in suburban Wilmette in exchange for learning the secrets of great baking.\n\nHis next stop was the Oakton Bakery in Skokie, where he confirmed the hunch that he loved the food business but disliked bakery hours. Decker continued his culinary education and added a few hours to his sleep by enrolling in Washburne Trade School, graduating in 1981.\n\nDecker pursued a career track that took him through some of the top restaurants in the country. He apprenticed at Jimmy’s Place in Chicago and went on to become sous chef at Cafe Provencal in Evanston, where he mastered French food preparation. “The roots of my cooking stem from Cafe Provencal. The rustic French cuisine: olive oil, tomatoes, garlic, and peppers. The transition is easy to make. Both cuisines utilize the finest ingredients, prepared simply.”\n\nThe next stops were Mallory’s, where he ran the kitchen, and Don Roth’s Restaurants. While with Roth’s, Decker took a cooking sabbatical to New Orleans, where he studied Cajun cooking at four famed restaurants — K-Paul’s, LeRuth’s, Commander’s Palace and Mr. B’s. From there, he embarked on the fate-determining trip to Europe.\n\nAfter traveling throughout Italy, Decker came back to the U.S. with the inspiration to re-create the rustic Italian cuisine with which he had fallen in love. He headed out to California to hone his country Italian cooking at Trattoria Primizia near San Jose. The restaurant was one of the first to feature thin-crust “designer” pizzas.\n\nLess than a year later, Decker auditioned before Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants’s Richard Melman. It was the late Marvin Magid who extended the invitation to Decker, stating, “You talk a big game, now I want to see if you can cook.” The twelve-course Italian feast Joe created was such a success that he was awarded the position of chef at Avanzare, Lettuce’s first Italian restaurant. He became Scoozi!’s head chef when it opened in 1986, creating its healthy country Italian cuisine.\n\nIn addition to Scoozi! and Avanzare, Decker has been instrumental in opening several other of Lettuce’s successful restaurants over the years including Twin City Grill in Minneapolis; Tucci Bennuch in Minneapolis; Tucchetti in Arizona; foodlife in Chicago; and Ben Pao in Chicago. He helped bring a version of the 87-year-old Miami Florida’s best-kept secret, Joe’s Stone Crab to Chicago and is a partner and helped open Chicago’s Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab.\n\nDecker continues to play an integral role in the Lettuce’s corporate and restaurant kitchens to develop the innovative food concepts that have made the company one of the nation’s leading independent restaurant groups. He has joined the Big Bowl team and oversees chefs and menu development. Decker enjoys the diversity of complex Asian cooking and the simplicity of American food.\n\nDecker is happily married to his wife, Kim and enjoys working out and cooking at home. His family loves attending sporting events, especially their two athletic sons’.\n\nJohn Buchanan\n\nFounding Partner and President of Lettuce Consulting Group and Senior Vice President of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises\n\nHe’ll tell you he’s never had a dull day in the restaurant business and Chicago-born John Buchanan is probably right. That’s largely because Buchanan, who began his career in the business as a dishwasher, has worked at more than two dozen Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants properties since joining the organization in 1978. When Rich Melman, Lettuce founder and Chairman of the Board, realized the need for a Human Resources Department, he selected Buchanan to head up the project. John was the original author of Lettuce’s Management Training Program.\n\nBuchanan held the position of Vice President of Training and Development at Lettuce for several years, but ultimately missed the excitement of operations. He went on to create several Lettuce concepts as well as participating in dozens of restaurant openings, being involved in all aspects of their creation.\n\nA psychology graduate of Northern Illinois University, Buchanan is a natural teacher and often lectures at Lettuce’s internal “Management University” on a variety of topics. His ability to teach and motivate has led to the position of President of Lettuce Consulting Group. Buchanan, who lists Benjamin Franklin, Clarence Darrow, and Houdini among his heroes, worked for a major steak house chain as well as Interstate United Corporation before joining Lettuce. His career at Lettuce began at Evanston’s Fritz, That’s It! in 1978.\n\nKelly Clancy\n\nManaging Partner\n\nKelly Clancy is the Managing Partner and Divisional Supervisor for The Oakville Grill & Cellar, 167 Events and RPM Restaurants, including RPM Italian (Chicago, Washington D.C. and Las Vegas), RPM Steak, Pizzeria Portofino, RPM Events and RPM Seafood.\n\nQuite literally growing up in restaurants, Kelly worked in her father’s restaurant answering phones, washing dishes, making pizzas and eventually managing during college.

Mervis grew up going to Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants. When he was a teenager, he started talking about what kind of restaurant he would open one day and thought of Merv's Bar & Grill. This idea gave him focus and a goal.\n\nAfter high school, Mervis decided on Washington University in St. Louis and graduated with a degree in Marketing and Spanish. Still, he often thought about the restaurant industry but planned to enter it through marketing. First though, traveling to Europe and experiencing the cultures and cuisines of many different countries was a priority. He spent the next six months traveling and eating his way through Western Europe and then landed in Madrid to teach English for the rest of the year. This experience of meeting new people and sharing stories and adventures helped solidify his dream of running a restaurant.\n\nIn 1999 he returned home and met Howard Katz, Ross Buter and the Wildfire division. He started his career as a Host in Lincolnshire and knew right away that the restaurant business was a perfect fit. In 2000, he was promoted to the management training program. His first memorable project was to revamp the martini list and make exciting new cocktails, like the martini flight and his dad's Bloody Mary recipe (both still signatures on the menu today).\n\nKatz and Buter pushed Mervis hard to learn and grow within the company. In 2002 they promoted him to a #2 manager and then encouraged him to experience the opening of the next Wildfire in Glenview in 2004. In 2006 he returned to Wildfire in Lincolnshire as the General Manager. Just one year later, Katz gave him the opportunity to open their newest location in McLean, VA.

His craft revolves around hyper-seasonal, local California ingredients, where foraging plays the main part in the flavor profiles that he creates in his kitchen.\n\nJacobson has always been one for good competition. Even before starring on two seasons of Bravo’s Top Chef and ultimately winning Top Chef Duels in 2014, he attended Pepperdine University in Malibu on a volleyball scholarship and made the U.S. National Volleyball Team.\n\nHis professional volleyball career took him to Belgium, Israel, and the Netherlands, where he discovered food could be exciting and inspiring. Jacobson then returned to L.A. where he ultimately decided that restaurants would be his next career path. He enrolled at the Le Cordon Bleu-affiliated College of Culinary Arts in Pasadena, graduating in 2004 and his first professional job was cooking at Axe, a highly regarded restaurant with an ingredient-driven California menu. From there, he went on to work throughout California at Campanile under Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton.\n\nAfter his first appearance on Top Chef in 2007, Jacobson accepted a position as executive chef at The Yard, a gastropub in Santa Monica, CA. The following year, Jacobson participated in the James Beard Celebrity Chef Tour and in 2012, he staged at the world-renowned Copenhagen restaurant Noma, working closely with acclaimed Chef René Redzepi. It was there he honed his skills and appreciation for every single ingredient—foraging for it, exploring it, and researching it. In July 2013, he became the executive chef at Girasol restaurant in Studio City, CA, and a year later was brought in as the first chef-in-residence at Intro in Chicago, IL which garnered three stars from the Chicago Tribune.\n\nJacobson is now the Chef Partner at Aba and Ēma, Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants, restaurant concepts focused on light, Mediterranean-style cooking. Aba recently opened its third location in Miami, FL with other locations in Austin, TX and Chicago, IL.\n\nCorey Milner\n\nPartner\n\nCorey has always had a passion for the restaurant industry. Starting as a dishwasher in high school at Mrs. Peters Chicken in Kansas City, he worked his way through the restaurant with several positions and received his first management job at J. Gilbert's Wood Fired Steaks. He then managed at Houston’s and J. Alexander’s. Working for J. Alexander’s Corey traveled to San Antonio, Houston, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, and finally Chicago.\n\nFinding himself eating at Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants locations on his days off, it was only natural that his next step was to join the Lettuce team. After an inspiring meeting with Executive Partner/President Chris Meers, Corey began his career with Lettuce in 2012 as the General Manager at Mon Ami Gabi.\n\nAfter 8 months at Mon Ami Gabi, Corey quickly proved himself as an integral part of the team and moved to Summer House Santa Monica and Stella Barra Pizzeria & Wine Bar in Chicago to open the restaurants as General Manager. “It was such an awesome learning experience,” said Corey. “From setting up contracts to choosing every detail like plates and napkins, it really taught me what it took to open a restaurant.”\n\nCorey opened Summer House and Stella Barra in Chicago in 2013, followed by a second location in North Bethesda in 2015. Working at the restaurants and spending time with Chris Meers has given Corey the skills to become an entrepreneur.\n\nOperating two of Lettuce’s fastest-growing and busiest brands, Corey is passionate about improving hospitality, staying up on food trends, building loyalty with his guests and most importantly, developing his team. “Building a restaurant from the ground up, we were able to put together a fantastic team. It’s been rewarding to cultivate the talent we’ve been given here at our restaurants, and see future leaders move up in the company,” said Corey.\n\nCorey became an Associate Partner in September 2017 after five years with Lettuce. Corey and his team look forward to expanding the Summer House brand to exciting new locations including at Disney Springs in Orlando and Las Vegas in fall 2023.\n\nMost recently, Corey and team opened a California wine country-inspired restaurant in Fulton Market District, The Oakville Grill & Cellar in April 2023.\n\nIf he is not at one of the restaurants, you will typically find him on the sidelines of one of his three children’s sporting events with his wife, Shauna.\n\nDana LaPointe\n\nPartner, Training and Development\n\nDana (Rosenblatt) LaPointe is a Partner and oversees training and development for the “San” brand of restaurants including Ramen-san, Sushi-san, The Omakase Room at Sushi-san, R.J.

Under his leadership, the restaurant was named one of the top ten restaurants of the year by critic James Ward and earned many national industry awards.\n\nDuring his time with the 95th restaurant, Chef DiGregorio gained the attention of Rich Melman of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises. In 1992, he became a part of the Lettuce Entertain You family. As Executive Chef Partner of local River North Maggiano’s, he brought to Chicago the Italian tradition of family-style dining and a greater appreciation of classic, American-Italian cuisine making the restaurant a legendary Chicago favorite.\n\nIn 2004, after taking a trip and dining throughout Italy with LEYE founder and Chairman Rich Melman, the team opened Osteria Via Stato in Chicago’s River North. Focusing on Italian dining that he experienced during his journey, the restaurant follows the Italian tradition of seasonal ingredients and local flavors. Osteria Via Stato’s simple and honest approach has made it a favorite mainstay for today’s epicureans—from neighborhood locals to award-winning chefs and winemakers throughout the world. In 2007, Chef DiGregorio and his team launched Pizzeria Via Stato, a Roman-style pizzeria featuring ingredient-driven tavern pizzas, salads, and small plates.\n\nChef DiGregorio continues to keep creativity and quality his top priorities for developing his ever-evolving, seasonally-driven menus.

Brennan had worked in kitchens while attending University of California at Santa Barbara, but with no other experience in the field, this top-tier restaurant gave him a full-time position just one month later. At this point, Brennan still did not consider pursuing a career as a chef until one night in the middle of service. He remembers having an epiphany that as a chef, he could take an ingredient and turn it into a moment of pure happiness for a guest. Years later, that remains Brennan’s favorite part of being a chef and he is influenced and motivated by the look that comes over guests when they taste something they love.\n\nOriginally from the San Francisco Bay area, Chef Brennan enjoyed cooking for his family and friends from an early age. Never attending formal culinary school, Brennan developed his style while living and working in Europe and all over the United States. Now Brennan is Partner and Chef for Summer House Santa Monica.\n\nBefore landing at Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants, Brennan worked at Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud in Dublin, Ireland, the famed Charlie Trotter’s in Chicago, and Aquavit in New York City, before honing his love and skill for baking at Payard Patisserie in New York City, where he became the head bread baker. After his time in New York, Brennan moved home to San Francisco to become Chef de Cuisine at Fifth Floor. Wanting to move back to Chicago, he took a job with the Park Hyatt on Michigan Avenue as the Chef de Cuisine at NoMI. He moved on to join the Lettuce family in 2008 on the opening team of L2O, where he would create their famed bread program and where he met Chef/Partner Jeff Mahin who was also from Northern California.\n\nThe two chefs started collaborating on side projects from the beginning, searching for a way to bring California-inspired cuisine to Chicago and serve the type of food that they enjoyed back home. In the meantime, Brennan started working at Petterino’s downtown where he noticed a small, underused space in the building, which he saw as an opportunity to team up with Mahin to create Do-Rite Donuts, a chef-driven doughnut concept that prepares small batches using seasonal ingredients. Brennan was then enlisted by Executive Partner and President of the Mon Ami Gabi Division, Chris Meers, to help out at Mon Ami Gabi and Café Ba-Ba-Reeba!, extending both restaurants’ bread programs, which put him in the right place to finally create his California-style concept with Mahin–Summer House Santa Monica on Halsted. In January 2015, he and Chef Mahin expanded Summer House Santa Monica to the Washington, D.C. market, opening Summer House in North Bethesda, MD. In February 2015, the now closed, Stella Barra Pizzeria & Wine Bar opened in North Bethesda, MD.\n\nBrennan now lives in Lincoln Park with his wife Sarah and their children, Henry and Harrison. When not working, he works on the couple’s 150-year-old vintage row house and enjoys traveling and dining with his family.\n\nGrant Waspi\n\nPartner & Director of Operations\n\nGrant Waspi is a Partner and Director of Operations at Lettuce Fly, LLC, the airport division of Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants.

Growing up in a small Midwestern town of only 1,800, Justin Diglia’s interest in hospitality didn’t stem from dining at splashy restaurants or eating the food of award-winning chefs. Rather, it was the time he spent in the kitchens of his Italian family members, learning first-hand, the art of heartfelt, soulful cooking, that initially inspired his culinary ambitions.\n\nRecognizing that food and hospitality had become his passion, Diglia decided to attend Sullivan University where he graduated with a double major in Culinary Arts and Business Administration. Following graduation, he took a position as Executive Sous Chef at Vincenzo’s, an old-world Italian restaurant located in Louisville, Kentucky. It was here that Justin honed his skills, fine-tuning his craft and mastering classic Italian and French techniques.\n\nEager to spread his wings in a bigger culinary city, Justin moved to Chicago in 2010. While he will admittedly say that the proximity to his Ohio hometown was an added bonus, it was the opportunity to join one of the most highly regarded restaurant groups in the country, Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants, that really sold him. Justin joined the team at Joe’s in 2010 as a Sous Chef, where his effusive goodwill and killer work ethic allowed him to quickly rise the ranks. Justin was named Executive Chef of Joe’s Chicago in the fall of 2016, Divisional Executive Chef in 2019, and in 2021, was named a Chef/Partner. He is responsible for overseeing the culinary teams and operations in each of Joe’s markets including Chicago, Washington D.C. and Las Vegas\n\nJustin is constantly inspired by his teams’ passion for excellence and credits the high standards of service and quality of product as reasons that set Joe’s apart from its competition.\n\nJustin currently resides in Chicago with his wife and two daughters. When he is not in the kitchen, he enjoys spending time with his two Shibu Inu’s, working out, and cheering for the Ohio State Buckeyes, Cincinnati Bengals and Cincinnati Reds.\n\nKaze Chan\n\nMaster Sushi Chef & Partner\n\nMaster Sushi Chef Kaze Chan began his culinary career at the age of 20 while simultaneously pursuing his degree in architecture. He apprenticed at Restaurant Suntory in Boston as Assistant Sushi Chef, and from there he continued his culinary training under official Japanese Sushi Master, Shozu Iwamoto.\n\nUpon graduation, Chan moved to Chicago where he was exposed to cuisines from around the world. New flavors and styles inspired him to incorporate global ingredients into his Japanese dishes. He furthered his career at premier establishments, including Sai Café, Mirai, Heat, Sushi Samba and Executive Chef / Partner of Kaze Sushi, where he refined his craft and continued to break the mold of Japanese cuisine.\n\nIn 2009, Chan was named Executive Sushi Chef / Partner at Macku Sushi. During this time, his innovative take on Japanese cuisine garnered high praise, being named one of the country’s best sushi restaurants by Travel + Leisure magazine and recommended by the Michelin Guide. From there, Chan joined Boka Restaurant Group’s Momotaro as Head Sushi Chef in 2014, where his passion for Japanese cuisine accompanied by his architectural background transformed each dish into a unique work of art.\n\nWith more than 20 years of experience in all facets of traditional and contemporary Japanese cuisine, Chan made the move to the renowned Chicago-based restaurant group, Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants. In December 2017, Chan and his Lettuce partners opened up Sushi-san in the heart of Chicago’s River North – a “not-your-typical sushi joint” that serves up made-to-order hand rolls, bincho-tan roasted meats and Hoshizaki blast-chilled Asahi beer in a raw industrial atmosphere.\n\nChan and the Sushi-san team opened the second Sushi-san in Chicago’s iconic Willis Tower in 2021. Most recently in February 2022, Chef Kaze Chan and his team opened The Omakase Room at Sushi-san, a unique 10-seat omakase experience hidden above Sushi-san River North where Chan showcases an 18-course menu with luxury ingredients. Chan flies fresh line-caught fish from Fukuoka, Japan twice a week to showcase the most exclusive and seasonal fish that can be found. The Omakase Room has been recognized among Chicago’s best dining experiences since opening.\n\nIn Chan’s time outside of the restaurant, he enjoys spending time with his wife and two kids, traveling, trying new fish, and exploring food culture all over the world.\n\nMark Sotelino\n\nPartner\n\nMark Sotelino is a Partner at Lettuce Entertain You and leads the operations and development of Chicago and Washington, D.C. based concepts including Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! in Lincoln Park, Lil’ Ba-Ba-Reeba! in River North, and Mon Ami Gabi locations in Lincoln Park, Bethesda, MD and Reston, VA. As the son of two European immigrants, Mark grew up in Chicago and was exposed to a diverse array of rich cultures and the city’s restaurant scene from the very beginning. Originally from Zurich, Switzerland, his mother traveled the world, exploring various career paths while feeding her hunger for new cultures and languages ( she is fluent in five). Mark’s father, Chef Partner Gabino Sotelino, is from rural Galicia, Spain. At 14 years old, he began to work and help support his family and thus discovered a passion for the culinary arts. Chef Sotelino trained in renowned kitchens across the world beginning in Spain, France, England, and Canada, and ultimately brought his career to the United States where he embarked on opportunities alongside Rich Melman at Lettuce Entertain You.\n\nMark and his sister, Cristina, grew up in the Spanish and French restaurants that their father, Chef Sotelino, helped create and grow with Lettuce Entertain You. While his sister showed an early passion for cooking and baking, Mark didn’t immediately gravitate toward the culinary and hospitality world. While Mark was studying journalism at DePaul University, he took a job as a host at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!, just a short walk from his dorm on campus. It was that experience that quickly unlocked his passion for food, wine, and service. During those early years, Mark acquired as many roles as the management team would give him. He took pride in learning all of the positions and representing his Spanish heritage. Seeing a clear fork in the road after his 21st birthday, Mark decided to dive head-first into hospitality management full-time. He started to train as a manager at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! while also going through a gauntlet of training across the dining rooms and kitchens of famed Lettuce restaurants including Mon Ami Gabi, Ambria, Shaw’s Crab House, Vong’s Thai Kitchen and R.J. Grunts. The insight and experience he gained from the leaders of these institutions were invaluable to his early career.\n\nIn 2000, Mark was on the opening team of Mon Ami Gabi in Oak Brook, IL as a manager, and two years later, he relocated to Washington D.C. to open Mon Ami Gabi in Bethesda, MD. Mark returned to Chicago in 2004 and worked as a manager at Scoozi, becoming the General Manager one year later.\n\nIn 2008, Mark was offered an opportunity to return to his restaurant roots as General Manager of Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!. He thrived in this role for nearly nine years before transitioning to Divisional Supervisor in 2017. During that time, he helped develop the Mon Ami Gabi locations in the Chicagoland area. By 2018, Mark was officially named a Partner with Lettuce Entertain You.\n\nMark’s career with Lettuce has spanned more than 25 years. His rich history and extensive knowledge have allowed him to build on his family’s legacy and develop the teams around him with great care and respect. While his number one passion is hospitality and restaurant development, Mark is happiest when he is exploring new places with his amazing partner, Rebecca. He also remains a lifelong basketball fan who continues to play organized hoops every chance he gets.\n\nMatt Mulvihill\n\nPartner\n\nMatt Mulvihill is a partner of Saranello’s, a restaurant by Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants.\n\nA native of Glenview, IL, Matt graduated from the University of Illinois-Champaign with a degree in restaurant management in 1987. He spent the following six years working for S & A Restaurant Corporation, and in 1993, he was hired by Lettuce to serve in management at Maggiano’s Little Italy. In 1996, Maggiano’s was sold to Brinker In"
