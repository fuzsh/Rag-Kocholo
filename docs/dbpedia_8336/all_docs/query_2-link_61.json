        "text": "Just how many cultures are represented at one elementary school? We think you'll be surprised. Take a look!\n\nAs enrollment at Sato Elementary School increases, we're adding another classroom space and other features as part of the 2022 Bond for students to comfortably learn for years to come. Take a look!\n\nSato Elementary just \"wrapped up\" a donation drive led by the student council. The drive collected supplies for the McKinney Vento Program, supporting BSD students experiencing housing instability.\n\nAfter a hiatus due to the pandemic, a longtime ACMA tradition of welcoming elementary students for a day of art and fun has returned! This week, students from Sato Elementary took a field trip to ACMA to get an introduction to the arts. Take a look."
