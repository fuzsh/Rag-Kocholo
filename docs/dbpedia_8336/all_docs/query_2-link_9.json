        "text": "Overview\n\nMany innovative products have had limited staying-power in the music instruments marketplace. As a means of advancing the discipline, the development of new musical tools might ideally untether itself from the mechanisms of sustaining a businessâthis is rarely possible. The musical instruments industry and specifically electric guitars (a roughly $1.5 billion a year market), though diverse and multifaceted, is shadowed by the scope of, for instance, the lipstick industry (a roughly $13 billion a year market)...not the entire makeup industry: just lipstick! That is to say: there is some money to be made in the musical instruments industry, but not as much as one might think relative to other industries. As an unfortunate consequence, most musicians can likely think of at least one musical inventionâan effect, an instrument, a component of an instrumentâthat was innovative, but, nonetheless, is no longer in production. The Parker Fly guitar is one of those innovations.\n\nParker Fly body modeled in CAD\n\nthe Fly Clone Project: a community\n\nMobile view of the Fly Clone website featuring a list of all Fly parts"
