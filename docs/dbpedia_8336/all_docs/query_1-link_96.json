        "text": "Rock 101 is one of School of Rock Aurora's top programs for kids and beginners. Students have one weekly group rehearsal where they learn to play classic rock songs that have been simplified for beginner musicians. Additionally, Rock 101 students in Aurora have a weekly private music lesson with an instructor who helps them learn the concepts and skills behind their performance songs.\n\nThe Performance Program at School of Rock Aurora is our hallmark music program, where tens of thousands of students enroll each year. It consists of a weekly group rehearsal where kids and teens learn by playing rock music's most iconic songs with a band composed of their peers. Students are assigned songs and parts that are tailored to them based on their age, experience and ability to learn new skills and concepts. Students then work through their parts in weekly private music lessons, refining the skills and concepts that those songs introduce. The goal of this curriculum is to prepare kids and teens for live performances. Every few months, School of Rock Aurora Performance Program students take the stage and play at local Aurora music venues in front of a live audience.\n\nAt School of Rock Aurora, our music program for children with no previous musical experience (typically ages 6 to 7-years-old) is called Rookies. Rookies students have one weekly group music lesson where they learn fundamentals like chords, rhythm and song structure. Kids get to learn and experiment with multiple instruments so they can later decide which one they ultimately want to continue pursuing in Rock 101.\n\nAt School of Rock Aurora our Little Wing music program for preschoolers and toddlers teaches students foundational music skills by playing games and participating in other interactive musical activities. Little Wing students have one weekly group music lesson in which they use classic rock songs to learn about rhythm, song structure, melody and dynamics through play.\n\nOur Songwriting program for kids and teens teaches the fundamentals of songwriting, arrangement and music theory, and helps students compose original works. At School of Rock Aurora, songwriting students receive one weekly private lesson where they learn concepts, technique and theory on an instrument of their choice. These principles are then applied in a weekly group lesson where students work together on songwriting exercises and lyrical workshops. Every few months, Songwriting students take the stage to perform or band together to record their original songs.\n\nThe School of Rock Aurora House Band music program gives students under 18 the opportunity to join a gigging band composed of fellow musicians from their school. These students perform additional live shows throughout the year. All students in the Performance Program have the opportunity to audition for a spot in School of Rock Aurora's House Band. Once selected, House Band members become leaders in their School of Rock community and perform live shows at CO rock venues throughout the year.\n\nThe School of Rock AllStars Tour takes the very best students from around the world and sends them on a nationwide summer tour across the United States. Less than 1% of School of Rock students are selected each year to represent School of Rock as an AllStar. All Performance Program students are eligible to audition for this prestigious program. The intensive audition process starts off with video submissions followed by live auditions. Once selected, AllStar students will have an authentic touring experience including traveling on a tour bus, doing tour publicity and starring in nightly performances at famous venues and festivals during a two-week tour.\n\nBeginner Guitar Lessons for Kids\n\nAt School of Rock Aurora, we offer beginner guitar lessons for kids. Our expert guitar instructors guide your child from start to finish with private instruction and weekly group band rehearsals. Every instructor at School of Rock Aurora is an experienced musician, and they emphasize foundational music theory and technique when teaching guitar lessons to kids. Unlike other Aurora guitar lessons and programs, School of Rock is designed to get students performing in a band.\n\nBeginner Guitar Lessons for Adults\n\nIt’s never too late to learn to play the guitar. Similar to our kids guitar lessons, School of Rock Aurora's beginner guitar lessons for adults utilizes a performance-based curriculum. Our experienced instructors teach adult students through popular rock songs, and teach students to play guitar in a way that’s challenging and fun. We believe the best way to learn is by doing, which is why we combine weekly private guitar lessons with group band rehearsals. At School of Rock Aurora, we teach beginner guitar lessons for adults in our Adult Program. This program gets students performing onstage at a local Aurora venue.\n\nIntermediate to Advanced Guitar Lessons\n\nAs students gain skills and experience, we move them along to more challenging programs at higher skill levels. Intermediate and advanced students take the skills they learned in beginner guitar lessons, and layer on more difficult techniques and concepts. School of Rock Aurora offers advanced guitar lessons for kids and adults that teach by playing challenging classic rock songs and emphasize playing the guitar in a real music venue. Our Aurora guitar teachers will work with each student to develop a custom learning plan.\n\nBeginner Drum Lessons for Kids\n\nSchool of Rock Aurora is the best option for anyone looking to learn the drums. Our beginner drum lessons get kids behind the drum kit and on their way to taking the stage. That’s why at School of Rock Aurora we combine private drum lessons for beginners with weekly band rehearsals—it prepares students to perform live. With years of experience teaching drums in Aurora, our drum instructors teach beginner drum students core techniques, including how to groove, play rudiments and more.\n\nBeginner Drum Lessons for Adults\n\nOur drum lessons for adults are designed to accommodate all skill levels. At School of Rock Aurora, our beginner drum lessons for adults are built for musicians with little to no experience. We teach adults using the same core performance-based education philosophy as our drum lessons for kids—performing with a band accelerates the learning process. Adult students will perform live at a venue in Aurora. Unlike other Aurora drum lessons for beginners, School of Rock combines private drum lessons with weekly band rehearsals so students are ready to play in front of real, live audiences.\n\nIntermediate to Advanced Drum Lessons\n\nMore experienced to advanced drum students need a drum lesson curriculum that builds upon foundational skills and continues to grow musical proficiency. That’s why at School of Rock Aurora, our drum lessons are customized for each student and his or her goals.
