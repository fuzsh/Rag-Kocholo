After high school, Guthro went to work in the hard rock mines of Alberta and it was during this time that he learned what diligence, tenacity, endurance, commitment, and perseverance looked like.\n\nUpon his return to Cape Breton, Guthro put these qualities to work with his passion for music. He performed in local pubs, and along with his wife, Kim, began organizing festivals and musical events. Guthro soon caught the attention of EMI Music Canada and was signed to the record label in 1998.\n\nGuthro performed to sold-out audiences in Canada, the United Kingdom, and across Europe. With nine East Coast Music Awards, three Canadian Radio Music Awards, SOCAN #1 Songwriter Award, host of the CBC Gemini award-winning ‘Songwriter’s Circle’, and Gold records in Canada and Denmark, his career made its mark. Along with his solo career, Guthro was also lead singer for 20 years in the Scottish Celtic Rock legendary band, Runrig, performing to concert audiences of more than 25,000 loyal fans.\n\nGuthro captivated global audiences with his honest, straight-to-the-heart, song-writing and live performances that were as engaging and personable as the man himself. Troubadour and story-teller, Guthro’s music got to the heart of the matter with his unique ability to connect with people.\n\nGuthro’s children, Jodi and Dylan, are proud to be carrying on the legacy of their father’s music and being a part of the East Coast music community.\n\nDenis Parker (Dr. Helen Creighton Lifetime Achievement Award)\n\nDenis Parker was a singer, songwriter, musician, and music industry giant for over 50 years. He grew up in London, England and was part of the British blues boom of the 1960’s. Before immigrating to Newfoundland in 1971, Parker recorded at London’s Abbey Road Studios for EMI/Harvest. The resulting two albums were later remastered and re-released worldwide on Cherry Red Records.\n\nHis latest release, in 2023, was a double CD featuring a new acoustic version of his classic song “Once Around The Harbour”, written in 1972 and first released on the vinyl album “TNT” in 1977. The second disc contains ten instrumental melodies to offer the meditative experience he once quipped.\n\nHe was also a music industry trailblazer, serving as the first ever Executive Director of the Music Industry Association of Newfoundland and Labrador from 1996 until 2014.

His work in creating programs, establishing funding grants for artists, and developing the talent of Newfoundland & Labrador garnered him the ECMA Industry Builder Award in 1999.\n\nAfter fifty years, a lifetime of gigs, and countless recordings, Parker never lost the fire and passion for his craft.
