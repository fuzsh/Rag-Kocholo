        "text": "NASHVILLE – Multi-platinum global entertainer Chris Young will headline Let Freedom Sing! Music City July 4th presented by Dr Pepper. The downtown event will present one of the country’s largest July 4th fireworks shows - which for the first time will include drone light elements by Sky Elements Drone Show - synchronized to live music from the GRAMMY-winning Nashville Symphony. Let Freedom Sing! will feature charitable partner PENCIL, and the free Amazon Family Fun Zone will return and include inflatables and live music. The concert and fireworks/drone show are free and open to the public. This is the first time for a fireworks show and drone show to be choreographed with a live musical performance.\n\nGRAMMY-nominated Young, who has 13 career No. 1 singles, will be joined on the Jack Daniel’s Broadway Stage by a multi-genre lineup that includes Yola, a six-time GRAMMY-nominated artist, songwriter, and actor, most notably in the musical drama ELVIS; Girl Named Tom, three siblings who won NBC’s The Voice in 2021; and Blessing Offor, a two-time GRAMMY Award nominee and GMA Dove Award winner.\n\nNashville-based artists Keesha Rainey will perform the National Anthem and Mike Parker will perform America the Beautiful.

These milestones and more landed the RCA Records Nashville artist among Billboard’s top country artists of the decade. Young’s ninth studio album, Young Love & Saturday Nights, was recently released March 22 on Sony Music Nashville. The project features 18 songs, 15 of which Chris had a hand in writing. He is the sole producer on three of the songs and shares co-producer credits with longtime creative partners Chris DeStefano and Corey Crowder. The album’s title track and current single leans into David Bowie’s “Rebel Rebel” signature guitar lick, making the legendary rocker a writer on the song. Named “one of his era’s finest traditionalists” by the Associated Press, Chris is an international ambassador for country music, performing to capacity crowds around the world.
