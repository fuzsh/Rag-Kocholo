        "text": "When it comes to baby shopping, the choices can sometimes feel a bit limited. While you have options like Target, Amazon, and a few pricey local boutiques, the variety can be slim. As an expecting mom, I am happy to hear that Babies R Us, which closed its brick-and-mortar stores in 2018, is making a comeback. They’re reopening as mini shops within Kohl’s locations nationwide.\n\nAccording to a Kohl’s news release, customers will soon be able to shop for baby products on Kohls.com and use the Babies R Us at Kohl’s registry to create and share their gift lists.\n\nKohl’s is excited about the new Babies R Us experience, noting that it will “introduce more new customers to Kohl’s, including younger customers who will be choosing Kohl’s for the first time.”\n\n“Evolving our assortment and bringing more relevant product to the millions of customers we serve is a core focus as we continue to deliver on Kohl’s broader growth strategy,” said Tom Kingsbury, Kohl’s chief executive officer, in the news release.\n\nBabies R Us started closing its stores in 2018 after its parent company, Toys R Us, filed for bankruptcy. WHP Global picked up both Babies R Us and Toys R Us in 2021.\n\nThe Babies R Us sections within Kohl’s will range from 750 to 2,500 square feet and will feature baby gear, activities, bath items, furniture, feeding, and safety products.\n\nKohl’s mentioned that these new spaces will “complement Kohl’s existing assortment of baby apparel” and will be positioned next to the new offerings, creating a “comprehensive baby shop for customers.”\n\nSome people took to Reddit to share their thoughts on the team-up. One person jokingly said, “Must be a lot more babies being produced now. I hear it’s on the upswing.” This person may have a point, it seems like a lot of people have been announcing their pregnancies lately. In the world of celebrities, Ronda Rousey, Brittany Mahomes, Margot Robbie, Katherine Schwarzenegger, Georgia May Jagger, Mandy Moore, Ashanti, Hailey Bieber, Cardi B, and many others are expecting.\n\nAnother person speculated, “I think everyone is trying to muscle into the stage of baby products because every other store keeps downsizing.”\n\nThis isn’t Kohl’s first rodeo with a store-in-a-store concept. They teamed up with beauty retailer Sephora in December 2020 to create a new beauty destination inside Kohl’s stores. Instead of a traditional department store beauty counter like you’d find at Nordstrom or Macy’s, Sephora shops now occupy about 2,500 square feet near the entrances of Kohl’s stores.\n\nKayla is the midday host on Detroit’s 105.1 The Bounce.
