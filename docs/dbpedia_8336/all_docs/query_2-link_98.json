        "text": "Rapidgrass music festival returned to Idaho Springs and drew hundreds of bluegrass fans from around the world to the ballfields on the east side of town for what many called a community event.\n\nLicense plates from Arizona, Texas, Kansas, California and more along the entrance to the bluegrass festival told a story of how widespread the festival’s reputation has reached in its 15 years. One person even traveled from Australia and asked to volunteer, according to festival organizers.\n\nHowever, organizers of the annual festival on Aug. 2 and 3 said once in Idaho Springs, you’re part of the community.\n\n“People come from all over the planet, volunteer their time or just pay to listen and partake of an amazing weekend,” Clear Creek Metropolitan Recreation District Director of Special Events Jenn Jordan-Truesdale said.\n\nAt least 12 bands, with names like Crossed Eyed Possom and Magoo played the two-day event with Artist at Large Tyler Grant filling in between band sets.\n\n“This year I finally convinced Mark (Morris) to hire me as an artist at large,” Grant said. “I’m thrilled to be here for the first time. It’s a beautiful setting, this field is a wonderful place to be playing music and the sound crew is top-notch.”\n\nMelissa Guthrie and daughter Nera Gomez of Elizabeth and friend Nichole Anderson from Castle Rock agreed it doesn’t get much better than enjoying bluegrass with family and friends.\n\n“This is what it’s all about, music, scenery and good friends,” Guthrie said.\n\nNearly two dozen festival goers set up camp in the adjacent ball field to stay and enjoy the two-day festival.\n\nFlower-adored hats circled the event thanks to the Marigold Flower Shop in Idaho Springs weaving floral patterns throughout the day on Saturday.\n\n“I think everybody here cares about coming together, I mean this is put on by the Rec Center because they understand this is mental health bringing everyone together listening to music,” Owner of Marigold Flower Shop Tara Worley said.\n\nEven the youngest, like 3-year-old Daisy Podosek and her sister 1-year-old Flynn from Lakewood, danced in the sun while their parents set up camp and shelter from the heat at the festival.\n\n“It’s just a great community event,” Brent Podosek said."
