        "text": "Aug. 10 – 11, 2024\n\nFree admission • Chicago lakefront\n\nStarting in the summer of 1959, the Chicago Air and Water Show has grown to be the largest and oldest free admission air and water exhibition in the United States. The spectacular two-day event draws an audience of over two million to the city’s stunning lakefront to see military and pilots perform astonishing stunts above the waters of Lake Michigan.\n\nFor more than 60 years, the multi-day show has taken to the skies above Lake Michigan, with North Avenue Beach as the center point. Make sure to arrive early to secure your spot and catch the spectacular demonstrations by aircrafts, boats, and diving and parachute teams. It’s a thrilling, bucket list experience — soak up the sun, breathe in the crisp lake breezes, and feel the rumble of jet engines soaring overhead.\n\nWhen is the Chicago Air and Water Show?\n\nThe Chicago Air and Water Show will take place on Saturday, Aug. 10 and Sunday, Aug. 11, 2024 from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day. There will also be a rehearsal on Friday, Aug. 9.\n\nTips for the Chicago Air and Water Show\n\nPlanning to go to the Chicago Air and Water Show? Here are a few things to know before you go.\n\nAccessibility: Audio description will be available for those who are blind/low vision during both days of the event.

The lakefront is accessible via the Red Line train at Chicago/State and Clark/Division. Extra buses will be running on the #73 North Avenue and #151 Sheridan routes. Learn more about CTA bus and train options. Limited parking is available.\n\nWhere to watch the Chicago Air and Water Show\n\nOn the beach\n\nThe prime viewing location for the Chicago Air and Water Show is near the water.

A little further north, grab a seat at Theater on the Lake’s waterfront patio. Or grab a seat at Castaway’s, a beach bar and grill with cool drinks, live music, and excellent views of the water and skyline.\n\nRooftop bars\n\nIf you prefer an elevated view, carve out a spot on a rooftop bar, like at The J. Parker atop Hotel Lincoln or Cindy’s at the Chicago Athletic Association. You can also see the show from iconic lakefront attraction Navy Pier and its many outdoor patios, like Offshore Rooftop (the largest rooftop bar in the world).\n\nLakefront boat cruises\n\nIf you’d rather get on the water yourself, hop aboard one of Chicago’s many lakefront boat cruises. There are a variety of tour boat companies that offer special cruises with incredible views of the Air and Water Show — enjoy a full buffet, bar, and unobstructed views with City Cruises or explore cruise options with Mercury Cruises, Wendella Boats, Shoreline Sightseeing Company, Seadog Cruises, Chicago’s First Lady.\n\nCheck out our full guide on where to watch the Chicago Air and Water Show.\n\nChicago Air & Water Show performers\n\nU.S Navy Blue Angels\n\nThe Blue Angels are the United States Navy’s flight demonstration squadron.
