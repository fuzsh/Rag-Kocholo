        "text": "For this week’s Song Lyric Sunday theme, Jim Adams has asked us to find a song that incorporates the Memphis Sound. That means we’re heading southwest from last week’s Nashville in north central Tennessee to Memphis in the southwestern corner of the state. I had to Google “the Memphis sound.” According to Wikipedia, “it is a shimmering, sultry style produced in the 1960s and 1970s at Stax Records and Hi Records in Memphis, Tennessee, featuring melodic unison horn lines, organ, guitar, bass, and a driving beat on the drums.”\n\nAs I was doing my research, the name Otis Redding came up a number of times and his rendition of “Try a Little Tenderness” got quite a few mentions. So that’s where I’m going.\n\n“Try a Little Tenderness” was written by Jimmy Campbell, Reg Connelly, and Harry M. Woods. It was first recorded on December 8, 1932, by the Ray Noble Orchestra, with vocals by Val Rosing. Other covers of the song were recorded by Bing Crosby (1933), Frank Sinatra (1946), and Aretha Franklin (1962).\n\nIt was Otis Redding who, in 1966, recorded the definitive soulful version of the song, complete with horns, organ, and an uninhibited vocal that builds in intensity as the song progresses. Redding was backed on his version by Booker T. & the MGs, and Stax staff producer Isaac Hayes worked on the arrangement. In early 1967, it peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. It has been named on a number of “best songs of all time” lists, including those from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It is in the 136th position on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 greatest songs of all time as of the list’s 2021 update.\n\nRedding did not want to record this song, but Stax Records executives and his friends wore him down with a constant barrage of requests. When he finally recorded it, he did it with a pleading vocal that he was “sure” would not be released. The ploy didn’t work. Redding’s version of “Try a Little Tenderness” became his signature song and the biggest-selling of the records released before his death on December 9, 1967. He was only 26 years old.\n\nHere are the lyrics to “Try a Little Tenderness.”\n\nOh, she may be weary\n\nThem young girls they do get weary\n\nWearing that same old shaggy dress, yeah-yeah\n\nBut when she gets weary\n\nTry a little tenderness, yeah-yeah\n\n(Oh my, not)\n\nYou know she's waiting\n\nJust anticipating\n\nFor things that she'll never, never, never, never possess, yeah-yeah\n\nBut while she's there waiting, and without them\n\nTry a little tenderness\n\n(That's all you gotta do)\n\nIt's not just sentimental, no, no, no\n\nShe has her grief and care, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nBut the soft words, they are spoke so gentle, yeah\n\nIt makes it easier\n\nEasier to bear, yeah\n\nYou won't regret it, no, no\n\nSome girls, they don't forget it\n\nLove is their own happiness, yeah\n\nBut it's all so easy\n\nAll you gotta do is try, try a little tenderness, yeah\n\nAll you gotta do is, man\n\nHold her where you want her\n\nSqueeze her, don't tease her\n\nNever leave her, get to her, try, try\n\nJust try a little tenderness, yeah-yeah-yeah\n\nYou got to rub her gentle, man\n\nDon't got, don't bruise her, no, no\n\nYou got to love her, tease her, don't squeeze her\n\nGot to try, now, now, now\n\nTry, try a little tenderness, yeah\n\nWatch her groove, you got to know what to do, man\n\nTake this advice\n\nFor this week’s Song Lyric Sunday theme, Jim Adams has given us “lean,” “sit,” and “stand.” My first inclination was to go with “Lean On Me,” from Bill Withers. And then I thought about “Stand By Me” from Ben E. King. But ultimately I decided on “(Sitting on) The Dock of the Bay” from Otis Redding.\n\nThe song was co-written by Otis Redding and Steve Cropper. Redding ended up sitting on a dock on the San Francisco Bay thanks to Bill Graham, who ran the Fillmore West Auditorium. Redding played three shows there in December 1966 and Graham gave Redding a choice: he could stay at a hotel, or at a boathouse in nearby Sausalito. Redding liked the outdoors, so he chose the boathouse. He started writing the lyrics to the song while sitting on that rented houseboat in Sausalito, and completed the lyrics with the help of Cropper, the guitarist for Booker T. & the M.G.’s.\n\nRedding died in a plane crash on December 10, 1967, a month before this song was released (January 8, 1968) and three days after he recorded it. After Redding’s death, Cropper mixed “Dock of the Bay” at Stax Studios. He added the sound of seagulls and waves crashing to the background, as Redding had requested, recalling the sounds he heard when he was staying on the houseboat.\n\nThe end of the song contains perhaps the most famous whistling in music history. It wasn’t planned, but when Redding started whistling at the end of the song, Cropper and Stax engineer Ronnie Capone heard it and knew it had to stay. Cropper said in an article, “Hey man, that’s great, leave that in there. It sure is a cool melody to go out with.”\n\n“(Sitting on) The Dock of the Bay” was released on Stax Records’ Volt label in 1968, becoming the first posthumous single to top the charts in the US.\n\nHere are the lyrics to the song.\n\nSittin’ in the mornin’ sun\n\nI’ll be sittin’ when the evenin’ comes\n\nWatching the ships roll in\n\nThen I watch ’em roll away again, yeah\n\nI’m sittin’ on the dock of the bay\n\nWatchin’ the tide roll away, ooh\n\nI’m just sittin’ on the dock of the bay\n\nWastin’ time\n\nI left my home in Georgia\n\nHeaded for the Frisco Bay\n\n‘Cause I’ve had nothin’ to live for\n\nIt look like nothin’s gonna come my way\n\nSo I’m just gon’ sitt on the dock of the bay\n\nWatchin’ the tide roll away, ooh\n\nI’m sittin’ on the dock of the bay\n\nWastin’ time\n\nLook like nothing’s gonna change\n\nEverything, still remains the same\n\nI can’t do what ten people tell me to do\n\nSo I guess I’ll remain the same, yes\n\nSittin’ here restin’ my bones\n\nAnd this loneliness won’t leave me alone, listen\n\nTwo thousand miles, I roam\n\nJust to make this dock my home\n\nNow I’m just gon’ sit, at the dock of the bay\n\nWatchin’ the tide roll away, ooh yeah\n\nSittin’ on the dock of the bay\n\nWastin’ time"
