INTRODUCTION The origin of the Holsinger family has not been determined but the first record found of Immigrants by that name is in 1731. Two men with their families, from the Palatinate in the Province of Hesse, Germany, came to America in that year. Rudolph signed his name by mark in the ship's register and it is spelled Holsinger. Jacob sign¬ ed his own name and it appears to be spelled Holtzinger. Rudolph was eight years older than Jacob and landed three weeks before him. There is nothing to indicate any relationship, however they did settle in the same section of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. All the descendants of Rudolph use \"s\" while some of the descendants of Jacob use \"s\"and others use \"tz\" in spelling their last name. Recent correspondence indicates that both spellings can be found in Germany today. Old American Records contain various spellings for the family name and frequently they seem to be used interchangeably. Spellings such as these are found- Holsinger, Halsinger, Holsenger, Holsonger, Holsiger, Holssinger, Holtzinger, Holtsinger, Haltzinger and Holzinger. The spelling Holtzinger appears in a 1783 census but not in the 1790 complete census. Although a Holsinger family coat-of-arms has appeared on the market, it is doubtful if it carries much significance. My brother has a letter dated August 17, 1956 from a Wilhelm Holzinger of 207 Schwarzwald Str., Freiburg (Brig), Germany written to Samuel J. Holsinger, then stationed in Germany. In this letter Wilhelm mentions some research he made into the Holzinger family in Germany but his records were lost during the war. In his letter, he indicated that the history of Holzingers goes back to an old Frankisch- Allemanish family which settled and lived in the Free City \"Weil der Stadt\", (today's n orthern pa rt of Wittemberg). According to documents, this dates back to the 13th or 14th century and he feels the present Holsingers with various spellings are descendants of this family. At the time of the Thirty Year War, (about 1633), three Holzinger families lived in Weil der Stadt, one of whom became the only Luther¬ an Mayor of the town. After the battle of Norlingen, they left for re¬ ligious reasons and settled in Merklingen, a Lutheran Community. The Church Records at Merklingen are well kept and include Holzinger records. Two other books contain material on the Holzinger family- \"Oberamt Leonberg\" published by \"Wurtt, Statistischen Lande - samt, Verlag von W. Rohlhammer in Struttgart\", and \"Wuttemberg Documentary book for nobility and crest, (Wurt. Adels und Wappen- buch). These books can be found in the larger libraries there. 7 X vO to O' X vO to 4» i IX C HH hH HH 1 VII 1 VI c 1 c H- • ►— * I—4 4 H-4 h— 4 vO 00 00 00 00 »— » vO O' 4^ H-4 00 4^ o O' tv 4^ O' i 1 1 1 i i H-4 H H-» I—4 h-4 I— 4 vO vO vO vO oo 00 on 4^ U> O O' to 00 O' vO tv »— 4 to ►— 4 H-* I—4 H- » h— 4 I—4 nO 00 00 00 ~o vO O' to vD oo o oo tv CV O' i 1 1 1 1 i H- » H-* H- 4 H-4 H- 4 I— 4 v£) vO vO 00 00 00 <ji 4^ tv 00 O' tv 1— • O' tv -V o H- 4 ►— 4 1— 4 H- 4 h-4 00 vO 00 00 H- 4 00 o -V to oo O' -J M to M i 1 i 1 -j i— * 1— » H- 4 1— • vO VD oo 00 4^ tv vO to vO on -V vO I— 4 H- 4 H-4 H-4 VD 00 00 00 O -J 4^ I—4 <1 tv tv -4 I— 4 H- 4 vO 00 oo tv v£> -j tv 4^ to I—4 »— 4 I—4 oo tv vO -vj -j -V -4 i 1 l 1— • >— 4 00 -V tv sO O' 4^ H-4 I—4 H- 4 H-4 00 00 00 00 00 to to o vO -V O' tv t 1 I i I—4 I—4 H-4 H-4 vO 00 00 oo I—4 nO to to 00 4^ H- 4 O' tv I t— • ~4 oo 4^ •-J 4^ O' -0 00 oo -V -V tv O P* M* O < to a p 3 K| O O CD 4 4 * 3 O K P *< -vj P to o to o H. ^ p TJ P K| O 4 ?r O o < n> a C-l o P* P -v 00 -4 oo CT I— p ►+» M rt O *~i O 4 to 4* vO O ^ “ n o' • P 2 \" H o - * O ° ~ O 2, S • ?l H* • E' <~> P S' ^ OQ £ ? f 8 p I— , 3 o' n» tr n» 4 to to o £. a p i—* (0 O O o r p . o p * a (A to to Co P 4 O to 4 3 p p 'C ^ 5d H- P O' CO 00 o -o ►“• T3 M* Jj- P ^ sO ° P « H ^ x w CO p on O P nT P H» ►!; 3 *< 3 t-h o § K, 3 p o 4 rt- d cr P M* to 3 4 OQ O O t P r § o p (A c+ fl) ►1 P* 4 to P (A Hh O P P CO t-n P 4 cf- w P* H fl> 3 4 OQ P O ££ - O o p' H* l— > P a •a £ f ?• M* P O n> o o P4 P O P w ft n rh M* o p to o ct M- o p to o cf O P to rt o cf (-*• O P to o> o cf H* p to fl> o cf M* o p cf P4 fl) P I—* !-•• fl (A cf P P Po f-* P cf to (0 cf to v o 4 cf to CO P^ P cf to (0 O hb> cr H* ►1 cf p4 (A o4 OQ fl) P fl) 4 P r+ H- O P (0 8 EARLY CONTEMPORARY HOLSINGER FAMILIES PREFACE Gathering material for this history was begun in 1937 as a hobby. At that time I had personal knowledge of less than a dozen families by the name Holsinger. My father had a record of a few more. With this nucleus and an urge to learn more about my family, the undertaking was started and has continued with increasing interest ever since. Contained in Section I of this book is a record of about 5400 descendants of Rudolph Holsinger. An estimated 1300 more have not been reported. Section II, if completed, would have a like number and the other Sec¬ tions in proportion. In compiling a record of this sort, it is evident that many years are necessary, many old records must be searched, many places vis¬ ited and many letters written. Even then it is possible only through the co-operation of those to whom letters are sent. Many branches still remain incomplete because we have not been able to locate records or persons with this information. We are Indebted to every cousin who supplied any data. My part was to collect it and assemble it in a sys¬ tematic order, a most fascinating hobby. Please pardon any errors that appear. Every effort has been made to keep them at a minimum. Althoughit is realized th at pi ctures would add tremendous interest to a history of this sort, the additional cost would make the price pro¬ hibitive. Special credit is due some who assisted in a large way in develop¬ ing certain sections. Lawrence W. Shultz of North Manchester for the Ulrich line, descen¬ dants of Catherine Holsinger. Clair P. Holsinger of New Enterprise, Pa. for the many families liv¬ ing in Morrison Cove. Mrs. Harry S. Holsinger of Lancaster, Pa. for research in Lancaster and York Counties. Frank E. Hess of Goshen, Ind. for part of Section VI. J. W. H olsinger of Berkeley, Calif, fo r descendants of Albert Holsinger. Charlotte Holsinger Bennett for Emanuel Holsinger family. Elizabeth Holsinger Beanblossom for Alexander Holsinger family. Frank L. Crone of Richmond, Va. for most of the Crone family of Section II. For the most part, this volume deals with the descendants of the immigrant Rudolph Holsinger, Section I. In contacting every Holsinger name th at could be found, several other Holsinger lines were discovered whose relationship to Rudolph has not been established. These lines have been partially developed and included in separate sections in the hope that some day actual relationship can be determined. Names of the following Holsingers are found in early records. Andreas Holsinger, Lancaster Co., Pa., 1735. Nothing further. Conrad Holsinger, Lancaster Co., Pa. 1790 Census. (Section II. ) George Holsinger, Franklin Co., Pa. 1790 Census. (Section I.) George John Holtsinger, Philadelphia Co. , Pa. 1735. Nothing further. Jacob Holsinger, Franklin Co., Pa. 1790 Census.

Philadelphia County was one of the original three in 1682. Lancaster County was formed from Center County in 1792. York County was formed from Lancaster County in 1749. Cumberland County was formed from Lancaster County in 1750. Franklin County was formed from Cumberland County in 1784. It is hoped that the publishing of this volume will not end the re¬ search into the Holsinger family. The author intends to keep adding to his file as new data is obtained. He will welcome any corrections or information on incomplete lines. The Baker line, descendants of Nancy Holsinger, No. 7, is entirely missing. This alone will make a small book. Perhaps, some day, someone will wish to fill this and other gaps to make a supplement. 10 GUIDE FOR EASY USE Individual biographies are grouped by generations beginning with the first recorded ancestor as number one. His children in chronologic¬ al order are the second generation and their children make up the third generation, etc. Each family is assigned a separate number followed by their lineal descent. The number of numbers in each se¬ ries is the same as the generation to which each belongs. For example, No. 473-87-19-4-2-1. 473 refers to the individuals biography number in the sixth generation, 87 is the biography number of his parents, 19 his grandparents and so on back to No. 1. Relationship between two individuals can quickly be determined by placing the one series of numbers above the other. 2191-466-85-19-4-2-1 2241-473-87-19-4-2-1 Here the first common ancestor is 19 of the fourth generation, 85 and 87 are brothers, 466 and 473 are first cousins and 2191 and 2241 are second cousins. When no great grandchildren are reported, each biography will include the write -up for the children and grandchildren, but when great grandchildren are reported, the children’s write-up will be continued in the next generation under their own biography number. A complete biography in cases where the items apply and are re¬ ported for both husband and wife, will include biography number with lineage; chronological position infamiiy; full name and commonly used name; name of parents with other ancestors; date and place of birth; education; occupation; hobbies and items of interest; military service; fraternal organizations; church affiliations; a ddress; date and place of death; place of burial; date, place, by whom and to whom married; ancestors of spouse and children in order of birth with dates. Data which applies to both husband and wife is given at the end of the write-up. In addition to commonly used abbreviations, the following abbre¬ viations and characters are used, ad- address b born bu buried (at), (in) ch children d died da daughter of grad graduate (d), (of), (from) L- Insufficient mailing address or last reported residence m married (to); m(l), m(2), if married more than once s son of ” commonly used name or nick -name in quotation marks Holsinger descendants in capital letters 2 of 3 means second child in a family of three children, etc. 11 Guide for easy use To avoid repetition, the name of the State is not given more than once in a write-up unless necessary. It applies until a different State is mentioned. In using the index, some difficulty may be experienced. The com¬ monly used name is used in the index when it is reported, otherwise the first name will appear in the index. If the name for which you are looking cannot be found, it may be recorded under the individual's other name. Double lineage occurs when cousins intermarry. Only one series will be used and a slight departure from the routine system may occur. *** Additional information in supplement. Data received too late to be included in regular order. 12 SECTION I RUDOLPH HOLSINGER Sailed in the Ship Britannia under Captain Michael Franklin Landed at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, September 21, 1731 Reproduction of his signature by mark appears in Pennsylvania German Pioneers 172 7-1808 by Strassburger and Hinke.

He was 44 years old and his wife Magdalena was 26. On page 41 of Vol. II is a reproduction of his sig¬ nature by mark, \"H\". They settled in Lancaster County, Pa. near Conestoga Creek. Record of one child has been found. HOLSINGER JACOB, b June 24, 1731; d Feb. 9, 1817; m Susanna Yeakel, 9 ch. No. 2. SECOND GENERATION No. 2-1 JACOB HOLSINGER, (s RUDOLPH and Magdalena HOLSINGER), b June 24, 1731 on board the ship Britania near Amsterdam, Holland, on the way to America and arrived at Philadelphia Sept. 21, 1731. About 1751 Jacob went to Franklin County, Pa. and hired himself to a Mr. Stoner, a large land owner. In the Waynesboro, Pa. Records, Feb. 1907 and 1919 the following paragraphs appear. \"The good peo¬ ple of the valley were at times molested by hostile tribes of Indians who -traveled this way, remaining for a shorter or longer time. At such times many of the settlers left here, not returning till the sav¬ ages departed. On one of these occasions, Mr. Stoner and family took a few of their belongings and moved to other parts. The balance of their property, suck as horses, cattle and household goods, they could not take. \" \"Young Holsinger volunteered to remain. Possibly thought he might save the valuable property. He did save it, as the sequel turned out. At night he slept in the mill with a gun by his side ready for any outbreak. During the day he stayed in the house frequently surrounded by Indians. By being clever to them, he gained their good will giving them a few minor presents and small pieces of silver coin and perhaps a little whiskey, for every mill in those days had a small distillery\". \"Some people p assing the place were less fortunate. He saw some men beaten by the redskins. One man died from his wounds. Just how much mischief they di d in the neighborhood young Holsinger didn't know, for he never left the place. Finally the savages left the place and the Stoners returned. Finding everything all right, Mr. Stoner generously gave Holsinger 180 acres of the best limestone land in Franklin County, SECTION I Second Generation 15 the two farms of George Foltz and Jacob Hess, just west of town. In 1872, Daniel Holsinger, the grandson of Jacob, sold 165 acres of that land for $ 17, 000. The balance was afterwards s old for nearly $3000. \" Four generations of \"Jacob Holsingers\" have lived on this farm. Jacob was a farmer. He died Feb. 9, 1817 near Waynesboro, Franklin Co., buried in the cemetery on the old Stoner farm near Waynesboro; married 1758 to Susanna Yeakel, (Jackel), born Dec. 6, 1740, died May 18, 1799.

Their descendants have sponsored a f und and have erect¬ ed a fence around this plot. They are now sponsoring a fund to erect an appropriate marker. Elizabeth Mack was a great granddaughter of Alexander Mack Sr. , co-founder of the German Baptist Brethren Church, now known as Dunkard or Church of the Brethren. Two of Elizabeth's sisters also married Holsingers- No. 6, and No. 11. Since many descendants of Rudolph Holsinger are members of the Church of the Brethren, it may be of interest to them to know that all with a lineage number containing the figure 4 or 6 in the third generation or 1 1 in the fourth are descen¬ dants of Alexander Mack.
