Harvard College Library) LETTERS OF MR. AND MRS. CHARLES KEAN RELATING TO THEIR AMERICAN TOURS LETTERS OF MR. AND MRS. CHARLES KEAN RELATING TO THEIR AMERICAN TOURS BY WILLIAM G. B. CARSON ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE No. 15 SAINT Louis, 1945 PRINTED IN THE U. S. A. TO MY SONS BRUCE AND WILLIAM KANSAS U1Y (llrtU.) fruoUU tJ'il ; r vj it PREFACE The following pages do not purport to present a definitive biography of Charles and Ellen Kean or a thorough study of their contributions to the development of the British and American stages. That task, if it is to be undertaken, must await the return of more normal times when it will be possible to assemble and examine the various manuscripts and other related material now scattered about this country, Great Britain, and probably Aus tralia. This study will, I believe, prove to be rewarding and significant, because the Keans, although not to be ranked among the greatest actors of our history, are entitled to recognition as among the most important artists of their day and as producers of exceptional brilliance, especially of the plays of Shakespeare. The fact that tastes have changed should not make us forget what they accomplished or the influence they exercised upon their own and succeeding generations in the theatre. All that I have attempted here is the presentation of corre spondence comprised in two considerable collections of their papers, together with a few other letters obtained from different sources. Those papers chosen relate to their various American tours, together with two or three others which present back ground material illustrative of their personal characteristics and of the conditions under which they worked. One of the collections is made up of letters written over a period of nearly thirty years by both Keans to Sol Smith, the St. Louis comedian and manager, now in the possession of the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis. The other is in my possession and includes many letters written both by and to the Keans which have not been used here because they have little or no bearing upon the purpose referred to above. I have, further more, very kindly been permitted to include a number of letters belonging to the Theatre Collection of the Harvard College Library, the Theatre Collection of the New York Public Library, and Mr. Maynard Morris.* * The following letters appeared in Glimpses of the Past, a publication of the Missouri Historical Society, Vol. V, Nos. 7-9, July-September, 1938: Ellen Kean to Sol Smith, May 4, 1865 ; Charles Kean to Sol Smith, 20 May, 1865; Charles Kean to Sol Smith, 29 May, 1865. Vll PREFACE Apparently the Keans' daughter, Mrs. Cosmo Gordon Logie, at one time planned to collect and publish her parents' correspon dence. There are among my papers printed copies, quite obviously proof sheets, of the first pages of two letters headed \"COPY OF PAPA'S LETTER\" and \"COPY OF MAMMA'S LETTER/' respectively. Moreover, some of the letters in the Harvard Collection bear com ments written on them by the recipients which seem to me to have been intended to assist someone in editing the documents. Others are undoubtedly Kean'$ drafts of letters of which he wished to preserve copies. But the great majority are clearly the originals themselves. (For instance, I am very sure that Mrs. Kean did not copy the lengthy epistles she indited to Miss Mari anne Skerrett.) Mrs. Logie, however, evidently died before com pleting her work, and her only son, if he outlived her at all, did so for only a very short time. Her death occurred on January 4, 1898, and on June 23, according to Mr. Percy J. Dobell of Tun- bridge Wells, the \"Library and Autographs of Charles Kean were sold at Messrs. Sotheby's.\" The work of editing these letters has presented some difficul ties. Under existing conditions it has been impossible to run to earth all clues. Furthermore, the handwriting of Mrs. Kean, especially when she was agitated, cannot always be deciphered. \"It is a bit odd/' wrote the late Otis Skinner, \"that the college- bred Charles should spell so badly. Ellen, too, might have been a little less sloppy ; she spent her life in constant association with the literature of classic plays. However, it's all very picturesque and charming.\" Several years have passed since I began to prepare these letters for publication, and during that time I have had the benefit of the assistance and co-operation of many people. Not all of this help can be cited here, but I must acknowledge my indebtedness to a few persons, notably: Mrs. Stella Drumm Atkinson and Mrs. Brenda Gieseker of the Missouri Historical Society, who aided me in the study of the manuscripts in the Society's possession ; Dr. William Van Lennep, Curator of the Theatre Collection of the Harvard College Library; Mr. George Freedley, Curator, and Mrs. Elizabeth P. Barrett, Assistant-in-Charge, of the Theatre Collection of the New York Public Library; Mrs. Richard F. viii PREFACE Jones, who unearthed for me much useful information in Lon don; Professors Walter Pritchard Eaton, Allardyce Nicoll, and James Flagg Bemis of Yale University; Mr. Percy J. Dobell of Tunbridge Wells, England; Mr. R. A. Austen-Leigh and Mr. Quickswood, Provost of Eton; Mr. A. S. Paterson, H. B. M. Consul in St. Louis; Mr. Horace F. Grimm, State Supervisor, Missouri State Historical Records Survey ; Professor William S. Clark of the University of Cincinnati ; Miss Katherine Anderson of the Library Association of Portland, Oregon; Miss Ethel L. Hutchins of the Public Library of Cincinnati ; and Mr. John Hall Jacobs of the New Orleans Public Library. Finally, as always, I am indebted to my wife for her invaluable counsel and assis tance. Without them, this could not be. William G. B. Carson St. Louis, August 5, 1944. ix INTRODUCTION Charles John Kean was the second and only surviving son of Edmund Kean, in Otis Skinner's phrase \"perhaps the greatest genius the English-speaking stage has ever known.\" His mother was the former Mary Chambers, an actress of but little talent and in herself of no importance. He was born on January 18, 1811, in Ireland, at Waterford, his mother's home town, in which his father happened to be playing at the time. The father \"was en gaged at a salary of five and twenty shillings a week, the leading member of a company playing now at Swansea, now at Car marthen, now at Haverfordwest, and thence crossing to Ireland. . . . He had suffered much from indigence and even the pangs of hunger/' 1 The glory which was to come was still three years away and as yet undreamed of by any except Edmund himself. From this penury there came relief at last. By sheer bravado Kean forced the recognition of his genius. Returning home from Drury Lane on the night of his triumph, the great man cried out jubilantly that his wife should have her carriage and that \"Charlie\" should go to Eton. In due time the promise was kept, and to Eton Charlie went in 1824, when he was thirteen years of age. There he took an active part in the school life and made many friends among his aristocratic classmates. The boy ex pected, naturally enough, to be the heir to a great fortune and looked forward to the same type of career as would fall to the lot of his well-born associates. His father preferred the Navy, his mother the church. 2 Unfortunately, however, swept off his feet by his success and the instability of his character, the elder Kean gave himself over to dissipation and folly, and began the rapid descent from the heights which was to bring his sensational career to a premature close six years later. It was soon no longer possible for Charles to continue at an expensive school. Whether inspired by social ambition or by jealous fear, his father was determined that he should not adopt the stage as a profession. So he induced a friend 3 to offer the boy 1 Button Cook, Hours with the Players (London, 1881), II, 233-234. 2 Ibid., II, 236. 3 J. Calcraft, \"a member of Parliament, and one of the most influential of the Drury Lane Committee of that day.\" [John William Cole, The Life and Theatrical Times of Charles K&an, F. S. A. (London, 1859), I, 145. The F. S. A. indicates \"Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.\"] 2 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES a place with the East India Company. This Charles agreed to accept provided that his father would increase Mrs. Kean's allow ance from 200 to 300 a year. 4 Such provision the actor could not or would not promise, and to his indignation his offer was re jected. The son's assertion that he would try his luck on the stage evoked an outburst of rage from his father. \"In the following July, when the Eton vacation came on, Charles Kean was in formed that his accounts were paid up, his allowance stopped, and that he was not to return.\" 5 At this juncture Yankee shrewdness played the part of fate. Stephen Price, the American lessee of Drury Lane Theatre, hav ing just quarreled with Edmund Kean and lost his services, saw a way in which to get revenge on his former star and also make some money in a sensational manner. He offered the youth his chance on the very stage which his father had just quit. Before accepting, the former insisted upon writing his father, and Price undertook to deliver the letter, but no answer was received. So Charles went ahead and signed an agreement to act for Price for three years, the salary to be 10 a week for the first year, 11 for the second and 12 for the third, provided always that he was successful. 6 Drury Lane was in 1827 one of the two leading theatres in London, the only two which were licensed to produce plays by Shakespeare. (One other, the Haymarket, was permitted to do so during certain months only. In 1843 this restriction was lifted by Parliament.) Charles Kean was at this time a youth of barely sixteen without any acting experience whatsoever. Yet he was not presented in a minor role. Like so many other young actors of his day, he made his debut as Young Norval in the Reverend Doctor Home's Douglas, one of the principal characters in the play. But Price made no mistake. He was interested, not in an artistic success for his protege, but in a pecuniary one for him self. And the house was full. The awkward boy was received with a roar of welcome from a huge audience composed largely of the curious, who had come to see what his father's son could do. They soon saw. It was very little. His performance, even when he had overcome his not unnatural stage fright, evidenced ^ Cook, op. tit., II, 237. 5 Cole, op. tit., I, 147. Ibid., I, 149. INTRODUCTION 3 considerable familiarity with his father's methods and manner isms, but pathetically little of his power. Throughout the eve ning the applause was diminuendo. The surprising thing is that anything else was expected and that the critics took the novice to task for not accomplishing the impossible. Yet he remained at Drury Lane throughout the season, reap pearing occasionally as Norval and attempting a few other roles. There could, however, be no disguising the fact that he had failed. But, if Charles Kean inherited nothing else from his father, he did inherit his unbreakable will and tenacity of pur pose. Moreover, he had his mother to support. So after some more rather fruitless attempts, he took to the provinces. There he sought experience, income, and relief from the great humilia tion he had endured. A reconciliation with his father having been effected, the two made in Glasgow on October 1, 1828, a joint appearance in the tragedy of Brutus by John Howard Payne. In 1829 he crossed over to Ireland for further appearances with his father. In London he tried his luck at the Haymarket as Reuben. Glenroy in Town and Country and Sir Edward Mortimer in The Iron Chest, the latter one of the most taxing roles in English melodrama. He also paid a disastrous visit to Holland. Then, during the summer of 1830 he sailed for America, the gold mine which has provided the old-age security of many a British player, opening in September at the Park Theatre in New York. In this country he remained until 1833, appearing in theatres as far west as New Orleans and Natchez, in the tragic roles associated with the name of Kean Richard III, Othello, Sir Giles Overreach, and others equally exacting. 7 Al though his youth and limitations, physical and otherwise, were not overlooked, he was warmly received and returned home with his pockets well lined. On March 25, 1833, not long after his return, occurred the last, fatal joint appearance with his father. This was in Othello at Covent Garden. The older man, playing the Moor to Charles' lago, collapsed on the stage and gasped to his son, \"O God, I am dying! Speak to them for me.\" On May 15 Edmund Kean died. By the exercise of sheer will-power plus unsparing study 7 William Bryan Gates, \"Performances of Shakespeare in Ante-Bellum Mississippi,\" The Journal of Mississippi History (January, 1943). 4 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES Charles Kean gradually compelled the public to recognize him. Five years after his mortifying debut he had 20,000, earned in his provincial engagements. 8 He became one of the outstand ing players of the day, accepted both in his own country and in the United States, to which he paid a not-too-satisfactory sec ond visit in 1839. A rather depressing account of this second tour is given by his official biographer, J. W. Cole. During the following September he appeared at the National Theatre in Church Street, New York, then under the management of Mr. J. Wallack. The house was crowded and enthusiastic, but after this auspicious com mencement clouds gathered rapidly, and a series of fatalities seemed to attend Charles Kean's second visit to the United States. When he began to act, he was suffering from an affection of the throat; exertion made his voice give way, and on the fourth night he entirely broke down. The theatre was soon after destroyed by fire. But that was not all. While he was playing in Boston, a counterweight fell from above the stage and killed a supernu merary standing near Kean, so near in fact that the star's clothing was spattered with blood. 9 After all these catastrophes, it is not surprising that he re turned to England. There, or rather in Ireland, he greatly strengthened his position by marrying the popular actress Ellen Tree, with whom he had frequently appeared in Great Britain and also in Germany. The ceremony was performed in Dublin while they were filling an engagement in that city. It is, I am sure, quite safe to say that this marriage was the most fortunate event in his life. In 1842 Ellen Tree had been for years an established favorite on the stages of England and America. Born in 1805, according to the Dictionary of National Biography, somewhere in Ireland, she was six years her husband's senior. The Dictionary identifies her father as \"a Mr. Tree of Lancaster Buildings, St. Martin's Lane, London.\" 10 According to Laurence Hutton, she was \"the daughter of a contemporary of Charles Lamb in the East India House\" and was born in London. 11 A phrase in one of her let- 8 Cook, op. tit., II, 244. 9 Cole, op. tit., I, 307-308. 10 Dictionary of National Biography (London, 1885), XXX, 265. 11 Macready and Forrest; and Their Contemporaries (in Actors and Actresses of Great Britain and the United States, edited by Brander Mat thews and Laurence Hutton) (New York, 1886), p. 100. INTRODUCTION 5 ters, in which she refers to the Irish as her husband's country men, would seem at least to suggest that they were not hers. 12 She was one of four sisters who occupied respected positions in the British theatre. One, Mrs. Quin, was a dancer. Maria, later Mrs. Bradshaw, was a singer and enjoyed the distinction of having created the title role in Payne's Clcuri, and so of being the first to sing \"Home Sweet Home,\" at least in public. 13 The third, to quote Hutton again, \"in a more humble, but not less reputable line, was popular in London and the provinces as a 'singing chambermaid' and soubrette for many years.\" 14 This was Anne, who married a Mr. Chapman, identified by the Dic tionary of National Biography as \"John Philip Chapman, pro prietor of the 'Sunday Times/ \" and by Erroll Sherson in his London's Lost Theatres of the Nineteenth Century as \"John Kemble Chapman,\" a theatrical producer of no great promi nence. 15 Whatever his correct name, by 1860 he had died and his children had become responsibilities of the Keans. J. W. Cole asserts in his biography of Kean that Ellen Tree made her debut in Edinburgh at the age of eighteen. 16 Inasmuch as this book was written, figuratively speaking, with Kean look ing over his shoulder, if not guiding his pen, the statement is probably correct. In 1823 she was the Olivia in a musical version of Twelfth Night produced at Covent Garden, her sister Maria being the Viola. The next two or three years found her in provincial theatres, notably at Bath. On September 23, 1826, as it happened almost a year to the day before her future hus band began his great adventure under Price, she appeared for the first time at Drury Lane, where she remained until 1829, when she transferred the scene of her activities back to Covent Garden. 17 There, among other parts, she played Eomeo to the Juliet of Fanny Kemble, who says in her memoirs that Miss Tree was the only Romeo she ever acted with who really looked the part. 18 In 1832 she was chosen to create the leading role, 12 Ellen Tree to Sol Smith, May 4, 1865.

Identified chiefly with comedy parts requiring the exercise of little power, Ellen Tree had not made a startlingly auspicious beginning. But, like Kean, she was blessed with tremendous self-confidence and a determination not to be stopped. She was not stopped. She steadily acquired more and more technical proficiency and so was enabled to display to the best advantage her extremely charming personality and was soon accepted in London as one of the foremost young actresses of the day, even in roles of a much more serious nature than those in which she had at first succeeded. In 1836 she for the first time invaded the United States, and such was her popularity that she was able, despite the grumbling of managers, to command exceptionally \"attractive\" terms. \"Her tour lasted nearly three years; she played in every important theatre in the country, and carried home with her 12,000 in cash, and the affection and esteem of the American people . . .\" 19 She covered the then settled portion of the country from New York to St. Louis, and from Buffalo to Mobile. \"Miss Ellen Tree's engagement, is concluded;\" wrote an unidentified lady from St. Louis in April, 1838; \"she captivated our citizens.\" But down in Mississippi the good people did not like her in tights. \"We are sorry to say that she was not, could not be, the lover Romeo . . . She is a lady . . . and an accomplished one . . . Romeo was a man . . . How can a woman know those masculine traits?\" Nevertheless, the writer did go on to say that \"Romeo was performed better than any other lady could do, and in some scenes we had forgot that one of the other sex was acting Romeo.\" 20 Ellen Tree never forgot her early Amer ican triumphs. She returned to England in the summer of 1839, and two and a half years later she married Kean. No match ever turned out more ideally. Throughout the twenty-six years they spent together they lived in mutual devotion, their happiness un- marred by any rift or scandal. When they were married, Ellen Tree was assuredly as great a name as Charles Ke<m, if not, in fact, a greater. But with the ceremony, or, rather, with the 19 Macready and Forrest; and Their Contemporaries, p. 101. 20 Mississippi Free Trader, March 9 and 11, 1839; Gates, op, tit., p. 6. Kean himself had played Romeo in the same town -in April, INTRODUCTION 7 public announcement a few days later, it was dropped like a stone to the bottom of the sea. From that day forward she was Mrs. Charles Kean or just Ellen Kean. A lady of stern Vic torian principles, she would have greeted with indignation any suggestion that she retain her maiden name. The change, moreover, was significant of her whole attitude toward her husband. She completely merged her interests and her life with his, though she might sub rosa rule the roost just as at home she carved the roast. Thereafter, except when she was ill or some unusual circumstance interfered, they seldom made anything but joint appearances, a custom which some times resulted in her playing such slight roles as the Queen in Richard II and the Chorus in Henri/ V. Among the American managers who had profited by Ellen Tree's tour of the United States was Sol Smith, junior member of the celebrated firm of Ludlow and Smith which for nearly twenty years dominated the stages of St. Louis and Mobile, and for a somewhat shorter period that of New Orleans as well. 21 Smith, who was a shrewd business man, did not forget the grati fying results of this first visit and in 1843 wrote Kean in an attempt to persuade him to bring his wife back to this country for a joint tour. To this suggestion the actor replied, express ing his regret that circumstances made such a visit impossible for the time being. Mrs. Kean was awaiting the birth of a child. The epistle, written in an old-fashioned script with many flourishes, is characterized by a rather courtly dignity and graciousness. 22 Kean was in 1843 only thirty-two years of age and had been on the stage but sixteen years ; yet already he was starting on the long process of retirement which was to con sume a full quarter of a century. It is possible that the reiterated warnings were intended to frighten hesitant managers, but I believe them to have been sincere. The Keans were undoubtedly a very domestic couple and they, I am sure, at least thought that 21 Noah M. Ludlow (1795-1886) and Solomon S. Smith (1801-1869) first entered into partnership in 1835. They operated theatres in St. Louis from that date (after 1837 in the handsome New St. Louis Theatre) until 1851. During the same period they operated various houses in Mobile. In 1840 they challenged the supremacy of James Caldwell in New Orleans, manag ing successively the New American and the New St. Charles. The firm was finally dissolved in 1853. 22 Charles Kean to Sol Smith, July 26, 1843. Letter in the possession of the Missouri Historical Society. 8 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES they wanted to retire to private life. This desire can scarcely have been diminished by the birth on September 18 of their daughter, Mary Maria, who proved to be their only child. The \"hope of again visiting the United States\" rather per functorily expressed by Kean in his letter to Smith amounted with his wife to a determination. Her associations with America had been especially pleasant and she was far too astute a busi ness woman to have forgotten the 12,000 she had carried home with her in 1839. So, obviously at her instigation he returned to the subject somewhat less than two years later. 23 This letter to Smith was composed five years before the Keans embarked on their long tenure of the Princess's Theatre in London with its elaborate Shakespearean revivals and French melodramas which marked the high tide of their careers. Yet again emphasis is laid on their prospective withdrawal from public life, his wife's being set for \"in a year or two.\" No print can give any suggestion of the vigor of the chirography with which he states almost defiantly that they cannot be induced to \"leave our Home, family, and all domestic happiness, together with the certainty of income in this Country, without a guarantee of one half the clear receipts in every Theatre w<e visited/' This \"half the re ceipts\" became a fetish with them and dominated all their busi ness negotiations during the remainder of their professional lives. 24 That the American tour was Mrs. Kean's project is made more than clear by the lady herself in a letter she wrote Smith from the Isle of Jersey on June 13. 25 She stated flatly that she had taken it \"utterly out of Mr. Kearis hands\" and instructed Smith to write to her. It is apparent from the tenor of this letter that years and success had in no way dulled the business acumen she had displayed before her marriage. Her insistence 23 Charles Kean to Sol Smith, April 1, 1845. Letter in the possession of the Missouri Historical Society. 24 In a letter dated \"Brighton/10 Sept. 1840\" and addressed to \"M. H. Simpson, Esqr./T.K./Birmingham\" Kean expresses indignation at being offered \"thirds and half . . . When, as you know, Bristol, Bath, Glasgow, Plymouth Exeter, can afford me a clear half of each nights receipts.\" Apparently he had been offered thirds on regular nights and half on his benefit night.

INTRODUCTION 9 upon the very best terms was scarcely less emphatic than her husband's. \"I was a Queen of Trumps when I was with you before I am a better actress now and I bring a King with me/' At the same time her resoluteness was inspired just as much by determination that their prestige should not be compromised as by the more material interest. If William Charles Macready, who in England was still Kean's most important rival, \"had half the House,\" she would see to it that they did too. The phrase was used to indicate half the gross receipts. This was a sore subject with Smith, as it was with all American managers. He frequently inveighed against what he considered the exorbi tant demands of stars, demands which, incidentally, were ulti mately to have much to do with the final collapse of the stock company system. Yet, after all, Mrs. Kean knew whereof she spoke when she said, as she did in this letter, that he was a good \"politician.\" Even so, he did not surrender at once. The Keans arrived in New York in August, 1845, and im mediately resumed negotiations with Ludlow and Smith, but the western managers were wary and endeavored to make better terms for themselves. 26 They preferred to deal with the visitors, not by long-distance correspondence, but through an agent, W. H. Chippendale, an English actor whom they had recently added to their company. Obviously, clear halves were not offered, and Kean, as his letters testify, was very angry. \"If Messrs. Smith & Ludlow would offer me half the receipts after one dollar per night!!! I would not accept them.\" 27 So a stalemate ensued. On September 1 the stars opened their engagement at the Park Theatre, New York, in Moore's The Gamester, an already outmoded tragedy to which they clung sentimentally throughout their careers. Professor Odell in his Annals of the Hew York Stage quotes The Spirit of the Times to the effect that they were greeted by a \"most densely crowded audience,\" which was \"en thusiastic in the extreme.\" He also found that Mrs. Kean elicited greater admiration than did her husband. 28 They stayed two 26 Mrs. John Drew in her memoirs calls the partners \"proverbially the closest pair in the profession/' Autobiographical Sketch of Mrs. John Drew (New York, 1899), p. 98. 2T It was the custom of managers to deduct a fixed sum for expenses before dividing the receipts with a star. 28 George G. D. Odell, Annals of the New York Stage (New York, 1927- ), V, 166. 10 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES weeks, appearing in Shakespearean comedies and also in plays by Kotzebue, Bulwer-Lytton, and Tobin. Then they moved on to Philadelphia. The news of their metropolitan successes was too much tor Ludlow and Smith, and they capitulated; but Kean wrote them triumphantly that they had waited too long. 29 He went on to Boston. But the thrifty New Englanders did not like the rais ing of the prices from the usual fifty cents to a dollar, and the management, forced to pay the inevitable clear halves, found itself so embarrassed that Kean generously returned his share of the receipts of the poorest night, Thanksgiving. 80 In the meantime, despite the fact that, as Professor Odell reveals, they were able to play four return engagements at the Park, Kean had begun to weaken about the South, and in October he wrote Smith in another vein. He would now consider coming after he had finished in Charleston and Savannah; in fact, he might even give up the latter city for an engagement of forty nights in the three towns under the firm's jurisdiction if satis factory terms were offered. 31 They were offered, and in due time the stars proceeded to New Orleans. The long-debated engagement finally came off in the spring of 1846, as in his recollections Smith notes, \"to fine business.\" 32 In the Crescent City it ran from March 2 to 21; in Mobile from March 23 to April 4; and in St. Louis (after an eight-night stopover in New Orleans) from April 25 to May II. 33 In his account Smith reveals that Kean himself, despite his vanity, entertained serious fears concerning his tour South and West. Mr. C. Kean was always nervous about the success of any engagement he and his wife were to play, and on this occasion, learning that the times were very bad at the South, his expectation of profit was very moderate- so moderate, indeed, that he offered to sell his share of their forty nights for $8000, which would be $200 per night.

INTRODUCTION 11 change for the better which had set in, that I was in favor of taking this risk, and I wrote to my partner at Mobile for his consent to the acceptance of the offer, which he refused. 3 * Ludlow also objected to Smith's assuming the risk personally on the ground that such an action would violate their articles of partnership (which Smith says \"had long since expired\" ). \"The result was this/' continues the latter; \"I was deprived of the opportunity of making $4000 clear money either for the firm or myself, while Kean pocketed the sum in addition to the amount he was willing to take as a certainty.\" In Mobile, according to Ludlow, the guest of honor indulged in a temperamental outburst on his opening night. The orchestra leader, accustomed to playing soft, sad music for death scenes, was suddenly inspired to furnish such an accompaniment for the death-throes of Beverly in The Gamester. But such a musical conclusion did not accord with Kean's conception, and upon the fall of the curtain he let fly his rage at the senior partner. 35 Smith, having suffered no such onslaught, had different impres sions to record. Of all the star actors and actresses I have had to deal with, Mr. and Mrs. Kean, separately and together, were the most agreeable and friendly. It was a positive pleasure to have them with us. They gave no trouble what ever, and all were anxious to do whatever they requested in the way of stage business. During their engagements they were so unassuming and kind in their demeanor that, were it not for the immense receipts they attracted, you would not have supposed, to see them, that they were any thing but the humblest members of the stock company. 36 The repertory of this extended season included the following works: Macbeth, Much Ado About Nothing, Hamlet, The Mer chant of Venice, As You Like It, Moore's The Gamester, Tal- fourd's Ion (with Mrs. Kean in the title role, that of a young boy, which had become one of her most admired characteriza tions), Tobin's The Honey Moon, Kotzebue's The Stranger, Knowles' The Hunchback, Bulwer-Lytton's The Lady of Lyons, Mrs. Centlivre's The Wonder, Bayley's Perfection, and Planche's The Follies of a Night. Most of these pieces were given, some of them more than once, in each of the three cities on the cir cuit. But Mobile did not see Romeo and Juliet, and St. Louis 34 Smith, op. tit., p. 199. 35 Ludlow, op. cit., p. 630. 3Q Smith, op. cit., p. 199. 12 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES missed The Hunchback and The Follies. The support offered them was certainly adequate, including such accomplished per formers as Eliza Riddle Field (in the South) , Mary Anne Farren (in St. Louis), Mary Vos Stuart (in the South), Tom Placide, George P. Farren, and Charles Webb, in addition to Ludlow and Smith themselves. 37 From among the hundreds of advertisements for quack medi cines, merchandise, dame schools, and other commodities, the notices of steamboat arrivals and departures, and the brief news items in the St. Louis Morning Republican it is possible to dig out a few laconic comments on the Keans' performances in the Mis souri city. The issue of Monday, April 27, reports that they were greeted by \"a brilliant and densely crowded audience\" and that \"overflowing houses\" are looked for. The next day the manage ment inserted the following notice. The Dress Circle and Parquette having been found inadequate to the number of persons who purchased tickets at one dollar each, on Saturday night, while a large portion of the second and third tiers of Boxes remained unoccupied, a part of the second tier has been partitioned off and connected with the Dress Circle in compliance with the wishes of the public. This same notice was run for several days. Incidentally, the price charged in the second and third tiers was only fifty cents. Probably the elite were a trifle uneasy about the company they might encounter in those exalted seats. Despite the strictness of Ludlow and Smith, theatre audiences in those days were by no means always decorous, even in such strictly supervised houses as those of this firm. On May 4 a brief article recorded the fact that Mrs. Kean's benefit, on the second Saturday of the engage ment, had been a \"real one.\" \"Rarely,\" it added, \"has a better house been seen here.\" For Kean's on Tuesday, there was, ac cording to the Wednesday Republican, \"a perfect jam. The rush for the boxes in the morning was so great that all were taken in a few minutes after the box-office opened.\" On the following Monday, May 11, they took their joint benefit, appearing in both The Merchant of Venice and The Wonder, rather a full evening, one would think, for both actors and audience. In a valedictory paragraph the editor paid his tribute. \"The genius of Mr. and 37 Ludlow, op. tit., pp. 628-642. Ludlow's recollections must be accepted with some reservations when it comes to casts, but most of these are corroborated by the press. INTRODUCTION 13 Mrs* KEAN is too well known and appreciated to need one word from us, and the succession of crowded audiences which have nightly assembled to witness their performances is the most solid and gratifying proof of their estimation by the St. Louis public.\" 38 Financially, as well as artistically, the engagements in all three cities had been extremely successful, and everyone involved had tangible reasons for being satisfied. So excellent had the busi ness been that the number of appearances had been increased to forty-two, not including the benefits, eight for the Keans and one for each of the partners. According to Smith's diary, the gross receipts amounted to $24,204.50. 39 Just how this sum was divided, it is impossible to say now because Smith's records fail to include the terms for the managers' benefits, though possibly the Keans contributed their services. If the figures he gives in his book (already quoted) are correct, the stars carried away about $12,000. He states that the $4000 he was prevented from making went to them in addition to the $8000 Kean had offered to accept. This $12,000 is of course considerably less than a clear half of the gross receipts, but, since these terms would scarcely apply to the Ludlow and Smith benefits, the discrepancy is easily explained. In a letter written some months later by James Bates, a fellow-manager, Smith is quoted as saying that his firm had made $100 a night, a total of about $5000. 40 Even if less than half the stars' profits, the sum was certainly not a contemptible return, especially in view of the current purchas ing power of the dollar. At all events, whatever the exact figures were, everybody, except perhaps Smith who could not forget how much he might have made, seems to have been happy. Comparatively too, the returns had been gratifying. Except during Holy Week in New Orleans, the Keans had done better than either Macready or Forrest, a nightly average of $666 to the former's $580 ; and in St. Louis, $486 to his $383. 41 On May 25 they opened at the Park a season which ran ss St. Louis Morning Republican, May 11, 1846. 39 Diary of Sol Smith in the possession of the Missouri Historical Society. 40 James Bates to Sol Smith, September 12, 1846.

Others followed in September and October. 42 They seemed to be always welcome and evidently concluded that the New Yorkers would always follow wherever they led. The previous January they had mounted a very elaborately staged production of Richard III which had run nightly for three weeks. Productions of this type were Kean's particular forte. To his passion for them and his exceptional skill in getting them up rather than to his acting are due his fame and his importance in theatrical history. He now determined to honor New York by undertaking for its benefit a venture of considerably greater difficulty and risk, notably a production in the grandest man ner of Shakespeare's seldom-acted King John. He resolved to overwhelm the city with an exhibition which in elaborateness and authenticity would exceed, not only anything it had ever seen, but also anything it could have imagined. While this was in preparation, however, he looked ahead and began to lay his plans for the campaign of 1847. These were to include another expedition to the West with stop-offs in Cin cinnati and Louisville. But he found to his great indignation that James M. Bates, the new proprietor of the theatres in those two cities, was adamant when it came to clear halves. He flatly refused to pay them and he was at no pains to say so in a tactful manner. 43 Charles and Ellen Kean were not accustomed to being treated with so little respect, and their anger was great. At first they declared that this contretemps would prevent their returning to Ludlow and Smith because, as Mrs. Kean wrote Smith, \"nothing less than $4000 would compensate for so long a journey, and there appear to be no other towns to make up for the loss of Louisville and Cincinnati.\" 44 Nor did conditions in New York maintain their rosy hue. The lavish presentation of King John of which so much had been expected, the first of their Shakespearean revivals mounted with a grandeur which was to dazzle London a few years later, was a failure. Kean had, he felt, cast his pearls before swine.

INTRODUCTION 15 duction at \"nearly $12,000,\" adding that this was \"an extraordi nary sum for days when the highest price of admission was one dollar,\" and when \"table board at the Astor House the last word in hotel elegance, could be had for seven dollars a week!\" \"The bill/' he goes on to say, \"proudly proclaimed that the scenery was painted on upwards of 15,000 square feet of can vas.\" The cast too was imposing. Of course, Kean himself played John, and his wife Constance. The Faulconbridge was George Vandenhoff, frequently a star in his own right, and the Arthur was Susan Denin. The Salisbury was none other than Frank Chanfrau, later to win enormous popularity as Mose in A Glance at New York, and \"Gentleman George\" Barrett, the John Drew of his day, must have been lost in the role of a Citizen of Angiers. 45 \"Well, what was the result of all this preparation and outlay?\" asks Vandenhoff in his Dramatic Reminiscences. \"The piece ran, with some difficulty, to moderate houses, the best of which did not reach 160, for three weeks ; and then, to Kean's great morti fication and disgust, was superseded by the VIENNOISE CHIL DREN (Enfans terribles! in Kean's eyes), who crammed the house to suffocation for the following month!\" 46 Under the circumstances Kean's disappointment and chagrin are quite comprehensible. He had seen so many performances of Shakespeare's masterpieces thrown together before any old pieces of stock scenery that happened to be lying around, negli gently rehearsed, and badly acted except by the stars, that the determination burned in him to give the plays of the master in a style that was in keeping with their greatness. True, the idea was not exclusively his. Macready had taken steps in the right direction. But he certainly intended to outdo the accom plishments of that gentleman. Ultimately he did so in London. Although he was unaware of the fact himself, he could not as an actor equal his rival, but as a producer he could excel him, and he did. During the next few days things clearly went further amiss, and a quarrel broke out between the stars and the management of the Park. Kean was of a painfully suspicious disposition, and 45 Odell, op. cit., V, 252 ff. 46 George Vandenhoff, Dramatic Reminiscences or Actors and Actresses in England and America (London, 1860), p. 221. 16 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES his inordinate vanity made him excessively sensitive to slights, both real and imagined. Moreover, the failure of King John to set the Hudson ablaze, together with his financial disappoint ment, must have aggravated his emotional condition. On Novem ber 23 he wrote Smith that Edmund Simpson had \"behaved extremely ill,\" and that he and his wife had decided to go to New Orleans in February or March, whichever Smith preferred, and then, after the usual round of the Ludlow and Smith theatres, to return to England. 47 Nothing was said of the $4000 profit stipulated by Mrs. Kean. As for Simpson, it is probable that Kean's anger was unjustified. After more than thirty-five years of management, the unfortunate man was struggling to keep the old theatre, now but a ghost of its former^ self, from utter ruin. The next year he was compelled to give up the struggle and the famous old playhouse passed its few remaining years in other hands. In July he himself died, friends declared, of a broken heart. In his Theatrical Management Smith records that the New Orleans and Mobile seasons were exceptionally prosperous. 48 Yet in this success Charles and Ellen Kean had little part. The wind was blowing in another direction. The truth is recorded in \"Old Sol's\" rather disjointed diary for the year 1847. On Monday, March 22, he jotted down these items: The Keans arrd. yesterday. Anderson played last night to a house of $510.50 The Keans opened this night Receipts only $408.25 Profit to L & S $4 12/lOOs So much for The Jealous Wife, Colman's comedy. Better things certainly were expected of Lovell's new play, The Wife's Secret, which had proved a hit in New York. Unfortunately, expectations were not realized. The receipts dropped to below $400. Smith's only comment is a rueful exclamation point! Ludlow says in his memoirs: \"This play was acted four nights during the engagement, and, I believe, was considered interest ing/' 49 Interesting it may have been, but profitable to the man agement it certainly was not. The returns for the ensuing per- 47 Charles Kean to Sol Smith, November 23, 1846. Letter in the posses sion of the Missouri Historical Society. *s p. 202. *9 Op. cit., p. 654. INTRODUCTION 17 formances were $426, $209 (rain), $390.25, and $340. Apropos of the last, Smith cries out, \"This won't do ! A loss tonight of $30 while they make $170.\" 50 He evidently figured his expenses at $200. On Sunday, the Keans, in accordance with their agreement,, did not play. So the theatre was turned over to the Ravel family, acrobats and pantomimists extraordinary, who brought $553.25 into the box office, of which $268 went to the managers. One can imagine Kean's emotions. 51 Before retiring for the night on March 29, Smith made the following mournful entry in his daily journal : \"Mrs. Kean very ill, but determined to act tonight. Her benefit yielded $481.25. The result of the engagement (so far) of Mr. & Mrs. Kean, is this : The Keans receive in 7 nights $1406. L. & S. receive above their expenses 0006 !\" The next evening the receipts from Ion were down again to $403. \"Mrs. Kean ordered by her Physician not to act any more at present. Unfortunate.\" On March 31 Kean himself took a benefit for $195.75! At the same time he inserted in the pro gram a notice to the effect that his wife, who had been \"laboring under severe indisposition,\" could not appear and had been for bidden by her \"medical adviser\" to act again. Sensible of the distress of the partners, Kean offered to make a compensation for \"necessarily cutting the engagement down to 7 nights,\" as Smith puts it in his book. The offer was declined. Nevertheless, he insisted upon returning $100 of the proceeds of his disastrous benefit, because of his wife's absence. 52 He also, according to Ludlow, played Don Felix in The Wonder when that comedy was given for Mrs. Farren. 53 After a rest of nearly three weeks, Mrs. Kean was, according to the Smith diary, pronounced well by her physician and made up her mind to resume her activities. But four days later, Smith had to make this final entry : \"Mrs. Kean gives up, & returns to Europe embarking from this port in the first vessel that sails.\" In his biography of the tragedian, Cole makes this comment upon the tour. 50 Diary of Sol Smith. si Ibid. 52 Smith, op* tit., p. 202. 53 Ludlow, op. tit., p. 654. 18 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES Throughout the Union their success was everywhere \"prodigious.\" By the close of the first year they realized and sent safely home a greater profit than had ever before been accomplished on the same prolific ground within the same time. 54 Of the failure of King John he speaks with ill-concealed irony. \"But our friends of the stars and stripes are utilitarians rather than antiquaries ; more inclined to look in advance than to turn over the pages of the past, or to pore into ancient chronicles, . . . The upshot was that the expenditure far exceeded the return, and the produce of the second year bore no comparison with that of the first.\" 55 Back in England, the Keans took up where they had left off and resumed the London careers they had interrupted for the American tour. In 1848 they were chosen by Queen Victoria to supervise the command performances given before the Court at Windsor Castle every Christmas, an honor which must have gratified them enormously and which they continued to enjoy for ten years. They now attained the summit of their joint careers when in 1850, together with the comedian Robert Keeley, Kean assumed the management of the Princess's Theatre in London. There, during the decade which followed, he and his wife, Keeley having withdrawn in 1851, presented the most lavish and spectacular productions of Shakespeare's plays the world had ever seen, with the possible exception of the ill-fated New York performances of King John. Neither effort nor ex pense was spared. \"In this little theatre,\" he said when the last curtain had fallen in 1859, \"where 200 is considered a large receipt and 250 an extraordinary one, I expended in one season alone little short of 50,000. I have given employment, i.e. weekly payment, to nearly 550 persons, and 10,000 has been expended on improvements and enlargements.\" 56 That the venture increased the size of the nest egg he was laying away against the long-promised retirement is, I think, more than dubious. Yet, highly as he valued pounds, shillings, and pence, even this fact could not destroy his satisfaction. He had achieved glories never approached by his predecessors, and he was firmly convinced that at last, thanks to him, justice had 54 Cole, op. dt., I, 343. 55 Ibid., p. 344. 56 Sherson, op. cit., p. 137. INTRODUCTION 19 been done to the world's supreme dramatist. Furthermore, he had won for himself a pre-eminence in British artistic and social life which to a man of his temperament was rich compensation for all his trials. There were skeptics whose appraisals of his achievements did not correspond with his own. The viewpoint of such critics, which has become ours to-day, he was never able to understand, and he took all unfavorable comments as personal slights in spired by animosity. His classical training and a naturally meticulous mind had left him with a passion for archaeological exactness; indeed, it amounted to an obsession. Painstaking research among the treasures of the British Museum and days spent plowing through the reports of countless antiquaries re sulted in a multiplicity of inconsequential details that we to-day find rather appalling. Nor was he satisfied with accomplishing these \"improvements.\" He was resolved that they must be under stood and appreciated as well as seen. Hence his printed pro grams were embellished with explanations of incredible length in which were cited, not only the minutiae of sets and costumes, but the authorities who vouched for their authenticity as welL Taking his archaeology so seriously, he was incensed when cavillers complained that he buried Shakespeare under ava lanches of scenery and, because of the time consumed in chang ing his ponderous sets, omitted pages and pages of the text. He prated much of the integrity of his text as spoken on his stage, and certainly nearly everything there spoken except in Richard III was Shakespeare, without alloy of inferior craftsmen; but so much of the original was not spoken that Kean was like a man who swore to speak the truth and nothing but the truth, blandly ignoring the fact that the whole truth was also required. 57 Yet what he accomplished did win general approval and served as a model for many successors, notably Sir Henry Irving. It is only within relatively recent years that there has been a com plete abandonment of his practices. 58 His ideals and his purposes are clearly set forth in a letter he wrote on September 10, 1856, to Colonel C. B. Phipps, Keeper 57 0dell, Shakespeare from Betterton to Irving (New York, 1920), II> 287. 58 The author distinctly remembers an admirable performance of Hamlet by the Sothern and Marlowe company about 1906 which started at 7:45 and ended about 12:15, and from which many scenes were omitted. 20 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES of the Privy Purse, with whom he had dealings in the staging of the Windsor theatricals. ... I have a much higher object in view than the mere profit which generally propels the managerial mind, for I cannot act in a commercial spirit I seek reputation I look for fame I trust to establish a name, not as the mere reflection of a parent's genius, but as emanating from myself, as having achieved something by perseverence, zeal, and energy, towards the elevation of an art of which I am proud and which I believe can, ought, and will be made a most valuable agent in national instruction. My opinion relates to the future, for the mark at which I aim, is, perhaps, at present, rather above the standard of the million, although I have no reason to complain of their support, but, I do< wish I could see more real sympathy more co-operation with my views on the part of the higher classes. It is true the Aristocracy visit the \"Princess's\", and express their admiration at the show, but they come with a kind of vague curiosity, unaccompanied with that respect and cordiality of feeling, which, I think, ought to wait on a great object, and which ever appears to actuate their appreciation of other branches of art. The Stage seems to be overlooked with comparative indifference, as an instrument of good while, on the contrary, how warm is the enthusiasm and patronage lavished on intelligent Architects, Sculp tors, and painters; with an earnest desire to improve the minds of the people, lectures are even sometimes delivered by members of the Aristocracy, on utilitarian subjects; I cannot, for my life, understand why a similar interest in the Drama the true Drama is not exhibited from the same influential quarters ; and, that in an age presumed to be enlightened and edu cational, that old and I may say vulgar prejudices, are not cast aside, and the Theatre acknowledged not simply as a vehicle for amusement but, as the Temple of the combined arts. The Stage might be rendered a most important machine, both in a political and social point of view: no one, I presume, will deny how necessary it is to guide into a wholesome channel, the minds of the middle classes, who are especially operated upon by theatrical exhibitions. If instruction can be blended with amusement, it surely must be advantageous and advisable, in due time, to use such in fluences for the benefit of the masses. 59 In recognition of his achievements Kean was given by his fellow-Etonians a testimonial banquet on July 20, 1859, as his final season at the Princess's was nearing its conclusion. The meeting was presided over by the Duke of Newcastle and one of the speakers was William E. Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Both the guest of honor and his wife (who sat with other ladies in a balcony) heard themselves praised with the utmost enthusiasm and sincerity. He was lauded, not only 59 Copies of this letter and of Phipps* to which it was a reply are in the possession of the author. INTRODUCTION 21 as a great actor and producer, but as one of the great archaeolo gists of the day as well. The Duke also referred feelingly to &n unusual feature of their management, \"the affectionate care which has been taken of those who are engaged there.\" They have watched over their interests; they have watched over their morality and their happiness. They have attended to their health ; they have made the Princess's more like a great domestic establishment than a public institution in which people have no care for those who serve them provided they fulfil the duties they have to perform. I say, then, honour to them, and especial honour to Mrs. Kean in setting so bright an example. (Loud cheers.) 60 Perhaps had the Keans been as successful financially as they were artistically and morally, they could have retired to private life as they had long wished to do or, at least, talked of doing. But they were by this time so accustomed to moving in aristo cratic and wealthy circles that they felt that they had to live on an appropriate scale of elegance. It was absolutely essential for the preservation of the prestige they both valued above al most everything else in the world. So retirement was for the present unthinkable. Once more, therefore, their thoughts turned to America, and five months after his withdrawal from the Princess's, Kean wrote his old friend Smith to inquire about transatlantic pros pects. 61 \"Old Sol\" was no longer in the theatrical business, hav ing retired in 1853, when, after eighteen years of inharmonious existence, the firm of Ludlow and Smith had been dissolved, and the junior partner, who had been admitted to the bar many years before, had turned to the law for a livelihood. In the spring of 1859 he had, with one of his sons, visited England and seen the Keans in Henry V, the last of their great revivals. Whether or not they had previously discussed the possibility of another American tour, I do not know, but Kean, despite the fact that his friend was now in a sense a layman, turned to him and enlisted his aid in the undertaking. To him in the corre- \"A Theatre,\" wrote Kean to Phipps on March 11, 1852, \"is an epitome of a kingdom. ...

Charles Kean to Sol Smith, December 29, 1859. Letter in the posses sion of the Missouri Historical Society. 22 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES spondence which followed he entrusted all negotiations with American managers. These negotiations, unfortunately, did not begin auspiciously. American managers, forgetful of past his tory, were not at all eager to engage the services of the former favorites. 62 The stars were no longer young, and it was quite conceivable that the American public, unmindful of their eminence on the other side of the Atlantic, might not find them \"attractive.\" Kean was forty-eight, his wife fifty-four. And neither one looked a day less, rather the reverse. Not in the best of health and aging prematurely, he had begun, as it were, to shrivel up, whereas she, fortified with more and more petticoats, was doing just the opposite. At home they had become veritable English institutions like Yorkshire puddings and Yule logs. No matter what they looked like, no matter what ridiculous figures they made in the youthful roles they persisted in playing, the British public still loyally flocked to see their performances. There was, however, not the slightest reason to take it for granted that American theatregoers, who had not laid eyes on them for more than a decade, would turn out in such numbers as to leave any thing for the management after the Keans had been paid their inevitable clear halves. Prospects, therefore, were distinctly bad when, after months of ominous rumblings, the Civil War broke forth and put a period to all the plans. Seeing nothing else to do, the Keans settled down to culti vating a little longer the familiar soil. According to their letters, the pounds were pouring into their waiting coffers. But these letters were partly camouflage. Had their income been as great as they wished American theatrical magnates to believe, they would assuredly not have embarked upon their next project. This was nothing less formidable than a tour of Australia. Only with the greatest possible reluctance can they have faced that undertaking, because it would entail, not only thousands of miles of travel, but also a long separation from their daughter, for they were convinced that she would be better off at home where she would have the benefits, social and intellectual, of London 62 Charles Kean to Sol Smith. Letters written throughout 1860 in the possession of the Missouri Historical Society. INTRODUCTION 23 society. 63 Nevertheless, so overwhelming was the desire to make more money than they thought they could accumulate at home that they decided they needs must go. Consequently, on July 6, 1863, they set out for the antipodes, and reached Melbourne during the latter part of September. Mary was left at home. James Cathcart and George Everett, two of Kean's standbys at the Princess's, were taken along to assure the stars adequate support and also to relieve them of some of the inevitable burden. 6 * Mrs. Kean's niece, \"Miss E. Chapman,\" familiarly known as \"Patty,\" went with them to play ingenue roles. It is possible that Mrs. Kean was accompanied by her personal maid, Jackson, but she is not mentioned in their correspondence during the Australian phase of the tour. Dr. Joy, who usually handled Kean's business affairs, was not in cluded in the party. However enjoyable their long voyage had been, once they landed in Australia, they did not find smooth sailing. They had been preceded there by the popular and talented Irish actor Barry Sullivan. 65 Apparently his friends looked upon them as hostile invaders and the Keans must have been chagrined to find themselves involved in a disagreeable popularity contest which led to very annoying newspaper publicity. \"The advent of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean has been spoken of lately by the Mel bourne Press in such a manner as to lead one to believe that it was quite a Victorian red letter day when they arrived. What ever might have been their position at home, and however much a portion of the Press has heralded their advent, it is now quite clear the whole affair is a mistake. Even the Melbourne Argus 'damns them with faint praise.' Punch was right when he pic tured the race for the championship with Barry Sullivan lead- 3 Mary Maria Kean was born September 18, 1843. She was married in 1876 to Dr. Cosmo Gordon Logie, who died ten years later.

With Everett there seems to have been no trouble. He acted as Kean's stage manager during the latter's last year on the stage.

In Melbourne they encountered an old friend, or perhaps more accurately, acquaintance. This was Joseph Jefferson, the already famous American comedian, who had played inconspicuous sup porting roles while they had been with Ludlow and Smith nearly twenty years before and who was now filling a series of engage ments in Australia. The episode is related by him in his Auto biography. 67 He first met Kean sitting dejectedly in St. Kilda Park, ruefully meditating upon what he considered the failure of the tour. It is significant that, although he was only fifty-two, he impressed Jefferson as a melancholy old man. I believe I can do no better than to introduce at this point the younger man's account of the old favorite's Australian debut. In a short paragraph it tells a great deal. Old Londoners who remembered young Charles Kean and Ellen Tree in the springtime of their lives were charmed to think that they would not only renew their acquaintance with these celebrated artists, but could take their children to see the favorite actors who had delighted their fathers and mothers in days gone by. The Keans on their opening night were welcomed with great warmth ; the audience rose from their seats and cheered them as they came upon the stage; old ladies and gentlemen waved their handker chiefs and stood up to applaud their former favorites as though they would have said, \"Welcome, welcome to our new home. Age has dimmed our eyes and wrinkled our brows, but, thank Heaven, it has not weakened our affection.\" This was all very cheering, but in the face of actualities there had ensued an embarrassing subsidence of their fervor. Those Australians who were seeing them for the first time were seeing them, not through the rose-tinted glasses of sentiment, but as they were, and they could not rouse themselves to the expected raptures. This fact was not lost upon the visitors, and they were hurt, especially Kean himself. His wife and Jefferson, knowing that he was unwell, sought to persuade him that the coolness of his audience was but the creation of his imagination, but for once he was not deceived. Yet still the old illusion refused to give up the ghost entirely. 66 Robert M. Sillard, Barry Sullivan and His Contemporaries (London, 1901), II, 68. C7 The Autobiography of Joseph Jefferson (New York, 1889), pp. 261-268. INTRODUCTION 25 From the Orient they were returning to America for the long- postponed farewell tour. As usual Kean was worried. He con sulted Jefferson as an authority fresh from the scene. Should they not open in The Gamester? Impulsively the young actor cried out, \"By no means!\" He then had to explain, and was compelled to admit that he be lieved, not only that The Gamester and The Wife's Secret were ready for the closet shelf, but that the Keans were a bit too mature to present themselves to a new generation in roles so unsuited to their years. Here again I turn to the Autobiography. \"And I believe you are quite right,\" said he; \"but my wife will have it that we are as young and as beautiful as ever. I believe that she would act Juliet now if I were fool enough to play Romeo with her.\" And here he had another good laugh. Back at the hotel, to Jefferson's tremendous embarrassment, the \"old\" actor repeated this conversation to his wife with his own embellishments. \"My dear,\" he announced, \"Mr. Jefferson thinks that it is high time for two such old fools as you and I to give up playing young parts and go into characters whose antiquity will be more suited to our dilapidated appearance.\" This exaggeration amused him, and he went out on the balcony to enjoy his cigar. \"During his absence,\" Jefferson writes, \"her cheerful manner altered, and it was plain to me that she had taken in the situation of their engagement more clearly than he had, for she said to me, with tears in her eyes, 'Thank you for keeping up his spirits ; he needs it.' \" 6S But they clung to The Gamester to the very end. On July 9, 1864, they sailed for California, which they prob ably felt was at a safe distance from the Civil War now drawing to a close. They reached San Francisco in time to open at Maguire's Opera House on October 8, putting up while there at the Occidental Hotel. They then at last inaugurated their actual farewell tour of the -United States, a tour which was to prove financially profitable, but otherwise one of the most un happy experiences of their long careers. When the Keans reached this country, they were tired. Furthermore, whether they knew it or not, his health was fail- Ibid., pp. 267-26S. 26 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES ing, and she had been painfully ill in Australia. 69 They had, moreover, undergone experiences which must inevitably have told upon their nerves. Under the circumstances it was natural that they were querulous and hypersensitive. They were in no mood to make allowances. The crude manners of many of the rough-and-ready Americans they encountered in California and Vancouver got under their skins, and they were ever on the look-out for slights. Nor can it be denied that they had grown snobbish. At home and in Australia they had been lionized by the elite; except in a few American cities they seem to have been for the most part socially ignored. Accustomed as they were to being accepted as among the mighty, they found what seemed to them like pointed neglect, very like lese-majeste. Moreover, they encountered much anti-British sentiment, a result of Civil War controversies and of Fenian agitation. Finally, the War had left the Americans also in a nervous frame of mind. The visitors apparently forgot that no people can emerge from so terrible an experience in a placid condition. Altogether, they were in no mood to enjoy their last visit to the United States. Their four months' stay in California was interrupted by a brief, but to them refreshing trip to Vancouver Island. Their spirits were sorely in need of this relief. To add to their other woes, James Cathcart was proving to be anything but a comfort and a support. He had taken to drinking, and Ellen Kean had been compelled to nurse him through an attack of delirium tremens on board ship. And Kean had other worries. He was tormented, too, by uncertainty concerning his future course of action. George Coppin, his Australian manager, who had ac companied him to America en route to England and was sup posed to be handling his business affairs, was now urging his employer to proceed forthwith to New York, but the situation was no more encouraging than it had been before the War. No one in the Eastern states was demonstrating the slightest interest in the farewell tour all feelers had been ignored and Kean dreaded taking the risk. 70 Whether Coppin was finally 69 Ellen Kean to \"My darling Mary\" from Prince of Wales Hotel, St. Kilda, no date. \"It is a painful tedious affair and a very expensive one but Gods will be done.\" Letter in the possession of the author. 70 Charles Kean to Mr. Coppin, January 23, 1865. Kean's copy in the possession of the author. INTRODUCTION 27 able to secure some commitments or he succeeded in persuading the actor to take a chance, the correspondence extant does not reveal, but to New York the party did go, stopping off en route to give readings in Panama and Jamaica, and reaching their destination in the early spring of 1865. No account of the Keans and their final American tour could be complete without a quotation from the memoirs of Clara Morris, the later renowned emotional actress, who was a mem ber of the stock company at Columbus, Ohio, and supported them during their engagement in that city. There is no space here to quote Miss Morris' encomiums upon Ellen Kean's playing of Queen Katherine in Henry VIII. Suffice it to say that in her opinion it was a great and moving performance. I draw merely upon her description of the couple themselves. That was the last visit to this country of Mr. and Mrs. Kean, and his memory was failing him grievously. He had with him two English actors, each of whom knew every line of all his parts, and their duty was, when on the stage or off, so long as Mr. Kean was before the house, to keep their eyes on him, and at the first sign of hesitancy on his part one of them gave him the needed word. Once or twice, when he seemed quite bewildered, Mr. Cathcart, turning his back on the audience, spoke Mr. Kean's entire speech, imitating his nasal tones to the life. But it was off the stage that the ancient couple were most delightful. Ellen and Charles were like a pair of old, old love-birds a little dull of eye, nor quite perfect in the preening of their somewhat rumpled plumage, but billing and cooing with all the persistency and satisfaction of their first caging. Their appearance upon the street provoked amusement sometimes even excitement. I often saw drivers of drays and wagons pull up their horses and stop in the crowded street to stare at them as they made their way to the theatre. Mrs. Kean lived inside of the most astonishing hoop woman ever carried. Its size, its weight, its tilting power were awful. En trances had to be cleared of all chairs or tables to accommodate Mrs. Kean's hoop. People scrambled or slid sideways about her on the stage, swearing mentally all the time, or a sudden gasp from the front row or a groan from Mr. Cathcart announced a tilt and a revelation of heelless slippers and dead-white stockings. . . . The Kean bonnet was the wonder of the town. It was a large coal-scuttle of white leghorn and at the back there was a sort of flounce of ribbon which she called her \"bonnet-cape\"; draped over it, she wore a great bright-green barege veil. But she was not half so funny as was her husband on the street. His short little person buttoned up tightly in a regular bottle-green \"Mantellini\" sort of overcoat, loaded with frogs of heavy cord, and lined, cuffed, and collared with fur of such remarkable color, quality, and marking as would have puzzled the most experienced student of natural history to name. . . . 28 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES As they came down the street together, Mrs. Kean, majestically towering over her lord and master, looked like an old-time frigate with every inch of canvas spread, while at her side Charles puffed and fretted like a small tugji Just after their arrival in New York, Fate intervened to cause them further trouble. President Lincoln was assassinated by an actor. In the resulting confusion, they, like other members of their profession, knew not where they stood ; yet they went ahead with their plans, and on April 26, when the theatres re opened, they began their season at the Broadway Theatre in a condensed version of Henry VIII, stopping at the fall of Wolsey (the final exit of Kean), and The Jealous Wife, in which they must have been rather absurd. Professor Odell has discovered that the tables were turned, that it was now Mrs. Kean who was received with unenthusiastic courtesy, and her husband who drew the plaudits, being hailed as one of the great tragedians of the day. He notes the absence of the patronizing tone in which Kean's performances had been discussed in what was supposed to be his heyday. Incredible as it may seem, \"the very mature Mrs. Kean elected to play the Fool\" to her husband's Lear. 72 For the financial results of this engagement, Professor Odell turns to T. Allston Brown and his A History of the New York Stage, The latter asserts that \"the seats were sold at auction, first choice being purchased by James H. Hackett,\" the well- known actor. \"One hundred and eighty-nine seats in all, and two private boxes were thus disposed of, to an aggregate of $3,546.50. . . . The receipts of the opening performance were $1,921.54. The largest house was on the 'Hamlet' night, when the receipts were $2,053.05. The total receipts of the eleven performances aggregated $17,554.39. Mr. Wood's share was $8,777.19. So triumphed the Keans.\" $8,777.19 is half of $17,554.39. So it was clear halves again. The Keans did tri umph. 73 As has been said above, the tour as a whole did not continue to be either so prosperous or so flattering. It lasted until mid- April, 1866, when they finally sailed away from America, never 71 Clara Morris, Life on the Stage (New York, 1901), pp. 164-165. 72 Odell, Annals, VII, 650-651.

Nor, it must be said, had they the slightest wish to return. They had travelled up and down the West Coast, and back and forth over the eastern half of the country, taking in, perhaps in addition to other cities, San Francisco, Portland, probably Virginia City, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Cleveland, Nashville, Louisville, Memphis, New Orleans, Mobile, Albany, and Boston. They had had many misadventures and humiliations. They had, they were convinced (probably with justice), been cheated of money to which they were entitled. His health was declining, and they were all exhausted, homesick, and irritable. After all their hard work and all the inconveniences and deprivations to which they had subjected themselves in order to accumulate a competency upon which to retire and spend their last years in domestic tranquillity, this consummation was denied them. According to his friend and associate, Fred Belton, he was suffering from diabetes; 74 and he had also a serious heart condition. 75 At fifty-five he was a worn-out old man. During the year which followed he continued to act, but with increasing difficulty. On May 28, 1867, he made in Liverpool in his great role of Louis XI his last appearance on the stage. After months of lingering he died on January 22, 1868, at his home in Queens- borough Terrace, Chelsea. Ellen Kean was desolated by his death. For nearly thirty years her life had revolved about his, and almost her every thought had been dedicated to his welfare and the gratification of his slightest whim. Belton asserts that he left her, as well as their daughter and their niece, well provided for. 76 But within a few years she seems to have found herself at times without the means to meet her wants. From a letter to Patty Chapman it would seem that she was not on the best of terms with her daughter. I am not well my dear and I am most unhappy I shall soon be free of every little debt and if I could only settle on you 100 a year I should pray 74 Fred Belton, Random Recollections of an Old Actor (London, 1880), p. 230. 75 DobelFs Catalogue of Autograph Letters &c., No. 66, June, 1927, lists \"a Doctor's Certificate, signed by H. W. Mainfold, Surgeon, 29 May, 1867,\" stating that Kean was suffering from a serious affection of the heart.

If, when he forbade his son the stage, Edmund Kean was actuated by fear that another of the name might eclipse his glory, his fears were groundless. Despite the maudlin raptures of his biographer, John William Cole, Charles Kean, if acting ability be the criterion, was never more than a star of the second magnitude. A vivid description of his appearance is given by the actor John Coleman. As to Kean's personnel, his face was merely redeemed from being posi tively ugly by the splendour of his eyes. His head was large and covered with a thatch of very coarse straight black hair, which he wore very long. His brow was majestic and imposing. His mouth and chin were firm and well cut; but his nose was of so irregular an order that I really do not know how to describe it. Although his figure scarcely approached the middle height, it was so muscular, so symmetrical, and so admirably bal anced that one ceased to wonder at his being captain of his crew at Eton. His neck was like a pillar of ivory, his chest was broad and expansive, his waist slender, while his legs well, they were more elegant than sturdy, with perhaps a slight suspicion of the parallelogram inherited from his father. Coleman goes on to quote Mrs. Kean on the subject. When my Charlie was a boy, he was the ugliest lad I ever met; but I could never see his ugly face for his beautiful gig lamps of eyes.\" To which he responded, \"And I could dever see yours, Delly, because of your beau tiful dose. 78 His voice wanted strength and beauty. He suffered from recurring attacks of bronchitis which wrought permanent in jury to his throat. His pronunciation has been called \"vicious,\" 77 Ellen Kean to Patty Chapman, Oct. 31, no year given. Letter in the possession of the author. Dr. Cosmo Gordon Logie (18207-1886) was Mrs. Kean's son-in-law, having married Mary Maria Kean on February 23, 1876. 78 John Coleman, Fifty Years of an Actor's Life (London, 1904), I, 188- 189. INTRODUCTION 31 no doubt because of his difficulties with certain consonants. Ellen Terry records that he always called Mrs. Kean \"Delly.\" 79 And Punch ironically thanked him for his antiquarian revelations concerning the dietary habits of the mediaeval Jews, declaring that he made Shylock cry out to the Duke of Venice, You take my life When you do take the beans whereby I live. 80 Yet Miss Terry pronounced his elocution beautiful. \"His voice was also of a wonderful quality soft and low, yet distinct and clear as a bell. When he played Richard II the magical charm of this organ was enough to keep the house spellbound/' In contradiction of this opinion (which must have been based on girlhood memories), we have that of George Henry Lewes. \"It [his voice] is harsh and rasping; so, indeed, was the voice of his father in its upper range (though less so), but in its lower range it was marvellously musical, and had tones of a searching pathos never heard since. Partly because of the voice which is inflexible, but mainly because of an insensibility to rhythmic modulation, Charles Kean cannot deliver a passage with musical effect.\" 81 There is no one living to-day who can arbitrate between these two authorities. The verdict upon the merit of an actor's work must of neces sity be subjective; it can never be final. An evidence of this fact is to be found in the disagreement between two such com petent authorities as Lewes and Miss Terry. In seeking to appraise the art of Charles Kean, the student to-day must end up somewhere between the unblushing eulogies of Cole and the venomous ridicule of personal enemies like Douglas Jerrold. 82 The truth almost certainly is that as an interpreter of the tragic heroes of Shakespeare, he fell short of greatness, but that in less sublime melodramatic roles such as Delavigne's Louis XI he was both unapproachable and unforgettable. In comedy he was beyond a doubt successful, whether the play was by Shake speare or by somebody else. \"Who can act Benedick?\" queried The Galaxy in 1868, a month after his death. \"Charles Kean, 79 Ellen Terry's Memoirs (New York, 1932), p. 13. 80 Macready and Forrest; and Their Contemporaries, p. 99. s 1 George Henry Lewes, On Actors and the Art of Acting (New York, 82 Douglas Jerrold (1803-1857), author of popular plays and contributor to Punch. His best known play is Black Eyed Susan. 32 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES a shrivelled old man of sixty [actually fifty-seven] , who looked no more like Benedick than a dried herring, gave us by sheer art the best Benedick of many a year.\" 83 One of the most interesting analyses of his acting is given us by Button Cook. His voice was strong, however; he was capable of feats of rapid enuncia tion, and he could indulge at times in a sort of passionate vociferousness that was highly effective if it occasionally degenerated into rant. ... He was far happier in his delivery of short sentences, sharp questions, or stinging replies. His face, plain of feature, was immobile of expression, although his heavy-lidded eyes were bright and penetrating. He was versed in all stage accomplishments, was adroit of attitude, fenced well, gestic ulated with address, making good use of his small and shapely hands. An air of refinement attended him, and for all his lack of comeliness he always wore the look of a gentleman. . . . Perhaps the main secret of his success lay in his earnestness of manner and his incisiveness of delivery, seconded by his special power of self-control. He had learnt the value of repose in acting, of repressing all excitement of attitude and gesture, and he imported into modern tragedy a sort of drawing-room air little known upon the English stage before his time. 84 This restraint had not always been characteristic of his work, asserts Lewes. He began by being a very bad actor; he has ended by forcing even such of his critics as have least sympathy with him to admit that in certain parts he is without a rival on our stage. . . . His career is a lesson. It shows what can and what cannot be done by courageous devotion and a burning desire to learn the resources of an art. The stamping, spluttering, ranting, tricky actor, who in his 'sallet days' excited so much mirth and so much blame, has become remarkable for the naturalness and forcible quiet ness with which he plays certain parts. He is still unhappily given to rant when he has to express strong emotion; but rant is the resource of incom petence in all actors of tragic characters; and it is only on occasions of excitement that he falls into this mistake. On other occasions he is calm and forcible. 85 One of the greatest handicaps from which he suffered through out his life was his inability to accept adverse criticism, at least of his professional efforts. Herman Vezin, one of his associates on the stage, records that he did admit quite readily that he was not the equal of his father \"There are no Keans nowadays. I mean Edmund Keans,\" he once said to his friend but that, 83 Macready and Forrest; and Their Contemporaries, p. 107. 84 Cook, op. cit., II, 252 ff. 85 Lewes, op. tit., pp. 22-23. INTRODUCTION 33 apparently, was as far as he would go. 86 So great was his \"in fantile vanity,\" as it has been termed, that any qualification of the most unrestrained panegyric or any failure to recognize his pre-eminence seldom failed to offend or anger him. Early evi dence of this weakness is found in a letter written him, it would seem, at the very beginning of his career by one of his Eton friends, possibly one of his tutors. This letter, which is ad dressed to \"Kean, Esqur. Junr., Drury Lane Theatre, London\" and dated \"Tuesday 2nd,\" is signed \"J. Bayley.\" 87 Inasmuch as Kean made his debut at Drury Lane on Monday, October 1, it seems probable in view of the contents that it was written the following day. It is, moreover, known that the very unflattering reviews in some of the newspapers excited and upset both Kean and his mother. On the other hand, the letter may have fol lowed one of the young actor's subsequent discouraging recep tions. .... Every one, on becoming a public character, must make up his mind to become the subject of public discussion. This consideration should have its proper weight among others that induced you to quit the private path of life. You have already achieved much by last Night's display, but you are far from having past the Rubicon if you expose so vulnerable a part to every contemptible foe. No one could read the Times paragraph without discovering a spirit of ill nature breathe thro' every part of it. I have just seen the Morning Chronicle, which contains a much more dispassionate critique. You have studied your profession with great effect; but you are aware that much remains to be done. . . . You have, as I before told you, only to persevere; not suffering yourself to be too much elated with ap plause or dispirited by censure; but to pursue diligently & steadily the path which you have chosen. For if your bosom reverberates with every flitting breath of praise or blame, you will exhaust over trifles that strength which should be kept for better purposes.* 8 The same note is sounded in a letter written him by his wife in 1863, when he was over fifty years of age. My dearest love. Nancy's letter this morning has made me very uneasy. I am sorry that you are upset just at the end of your time and I am sure (although she does not say so) that some unlucky talk has done it. Now I 86 Macready and Forrest; and Their Contemporaries, p. 106. 87 The identity of this man has not been established. He refers to- himself as a clergyman, and, according to Mr. R. A.

Be a good boy. . . , 89 The explanation of Kean's hypersensitivity lies in the province of the psychiatrist. It would, however, seem more than likely that it lay, at least in part, in the consciousness of his irregular origin and, perhaps, in a certain subconscious lack of confidence in his own powers. Edmund Kean was the illegitimate son of a disreputable young man of the same name and a young girl named Ann Carey who \"called herself, delicately enough, an itinerant actress and street hawker/' but who \"had the natural instincts, if not the commercial acumen, of an ordinary prosti tute/' 90 In his life of Edihund Kean, Giles Playfair quotes an article in Notes and Queries by someone describing himself as an old schoolfellow and friend of Charles, to the effect that his father was never sure which of two women was his mother. \"But the truth appears to be that Ann Carey was his real mother, and that Miss Tidswell was his aunt.\" 91 The writer claimed that in preparing his article he had used notes supplied by the younger Kean himself. The truth Charles seems never to have blinked, perhaps because he knew that to do so would have been futile. But he was a man of intense pride and was to a pronounced degree what we to-day call \"socially-minded.\" Ever since his days at Eton he had moved among the aristocracy and he re garded the upper classes as his own people. To a man of such 89 This is a portion of a long letter continued from day to day in April, 1863, chiefly about Fanny Kemble's readings.

INTRODUCTION 35 a temperament moving in such circles the facts of his birth must have been galling in the extreme. It is quite possible that herein lies the explanation of the lordly tone he often adopted in his correspondence despite a naturally warm and sympathetic heart. Charles Kean was not only an actor; he was also a business man, a shrewd and in the end a successful one. Fred Belton states that he was \"an immense man of business, and never missed a day or an opportunity of making money.\" 92 Yet he was also a man of no little generosity. He supported numerous pen sioners, including many of his wife's relatives, and responded readily to pleas for assistance. All in all, if not a great man, he was in his day at least an important one and so recognized by his contemporaries. And in the long list of memorable English actors his name commands a respected place. Both physically and artistically (at least until the last years of his life) Ellen Keari loomed larger than her husband. This fact, we may be sure, she took great care that he should not suspect. According to Coleman, even when \"approaching ma turity,\" she was in appearance decidedly pleasing. \"A well- shaped head was covered with a profusion of light brown hair ; delicately pencilled eyebrows surmounted large beautiful haze] eyes; while her well-cut ruddy lips set off to advantage two rows of dazzling white teeth; and, to crown all, her smile was sunshine and her voice music.\" 93 While a young woman she wore her hair in many ringlets ; in later life, after she had lost her maidenly figure, she parted it in the middle and plastered it down severely on either side of her forehead. \"Of imagination in its highest sense,\" according to the Dic tionary of National Biogr&phy,\" she was deficient, but she had genuine humour and provocative mirth. Westland Marston de clares that 'in sympathetic emotion, as distinguished from stern and turbulent passion, no feminine artist of the time surpassed her.' \" 94 As she grew older, she acquired greater tragic power ; although she, it would seem, employed histrionic methods now long since abandoned, acting definitely for \"points,\" there can be no question that she was able to give exceptionally moving 9 2 Op. cit. f p. 230. 93 Op. tit., 1, 188. ** D. N. ., XXX, 265. 36 WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY STUDIES performances. As evidence of this, we have the testimony of two of the most gifted actresses who followed her upon the stage, one English and one American, Ellen Terry and Clara Morris. Miss Terry, who received her early training while a juvenile member of the Princess's company, fortunately recorded in some detail her impressions of both her employers. What he owed to Mrs. Kean he would have been the first to confess. In many ways she was the leading spirit in the theatre; at least, a joint ruler, not a queen-consort. During the rehearsals Mr. Kean used to sit in the stalls with a loud-voiced dinner-bell by his side, and when anything went wrong on the stage, he would ring it ferociously, and everything would come to a stop, until Mrs. Kean, who always sat on the stage, had set right what was wrong. She was more formidable than beautiful to look at, but her wonderful fire and genius were none the less impressive because she wore a white handkerchief around her head and had a very beaky nose. How I admired and loved and feared her! Later on the fear was replaced by gratitude, for no woman ever gave herself more trouble to train a young actress than did Mrs. Kean. One more quotation from the same source: When I think of the costume in which she played Hermione, it seems marvellous to me that she could have produced the impression she did. . . . No matter what character Mrs. Kean was assuming, she always used to wear her hair drawn flat over her forehead and twisted round her ears in a kind of circular sweep. . . . and then the amount of petticoats she wore! Even as Hermione she was always bunched out by layer upon layer of petticoats, in defiance of the fact that classical parts should not be dressed in a superfluity of raiment. But if the petticoats were full of starch, the voice was full of pathos, and the dignity, simplicity, and womanliness of Mrs. Charles Kean's Hermione could not have been marred by a far more grotesque costume. 95 Miss Terry recognized that she had been fortunate in receiv ing her early training from this stern, but experienced, precep tor. For Ellen knew her business, and she knew it thoroughly, from the bottom up, not superficially. Furthermore, she re spected it so much that, not only was she willing to work herself unsparingly for its sake, but, what was perhaps more unusual, she was able to appraise the work of others when it was serious even when she did not like them personally. One of her con temporaries of whom she disapproved was Fanny Kemble. They had had no contact with each other after their girlhood when they acted together, and in the meantime Fanny had been mar- 95 Ellen Terry's Memoirs, pp. 13-14. INTRODUCTION 37 ried and divorced. Ellen Kean did not like \"disobedient wives.\" Of the real reasons underlying the Butler divorce she probably knew little or nothing, but it was Fanny, not Pierce Butler, of whom she expressed disapproval. Yet her professional perform ances she could criticize impartially. She might be shocked, but not too much so to be able to recognize artistic merit. In the spring of 1863 Fanny Kemble was back in London giving a series of her celebrated Shakespearean readings, and her former Romeo took her daughter to hear two of them. Charles Kean was out of town, and she wrote him accounts of what she had seen and heard. Monday night 11 o'clock 96 I write my impressions to night lest I should forget anything Fanny Kemble reads finely there is no mistake about it. 97 You know I always thought her handsome. She is looking very well. She is grown large with a tremendous bust. She wore a high white silk dress and her fine head was quite plain. Her lustrous eyes pearly teeth, and melodious voice give her a great charm. She must have been on her good behavior for she made a very low curtesy on entering and retiring. She was exceedingly nervous and commenced in a low modest tone \"I shall have the honor of reading, As you like it\" She soon warmed and read both Orlando and Adam beautifully She looked so like her Father at times that I found the tears in my eyes at the recollection of the fine old man. 98 She read Touchstone very well Audrey was certainly an imitation of Mrs. Keeley 99 and told well she could not do better. She read the banished Duke admirably and portions of Jaques exceedingly well especially \"A Fool, a fool, I met a fool i' the forest\" and the Lords speech upon the deer. She did not name the characters as she read them or very seldom. And I was right in my conjecture about 96 This is part of a letter written from day to day. That it and its sequel were written in 1863 there can be no doubt. The years during this period in which April 8 fell on Wednesday were 1857, 1863, and 1868. In the spring of 1857 Fanny Kemble was in America. By April, 1868, Kean was dead. Consequently, 1863 is the only year possible. 97 After separating from her husband in 1845, Fanny Kemble found her self under the necessity of earning her own living. This she at first did by returning to the stage. Although she was successful, her old distaste for acting persevered, and she gave it up to undertake the public reading of Shakespeare's plays. She was received with great enthusiasm and continued to appear in this manner until 1869. In 1863 she was fifty-three years old. 98 Charles Kemble (1775-1854), father of Fanny Kemble, and brother of John Philip Kemble and Mrs. Siddons.
