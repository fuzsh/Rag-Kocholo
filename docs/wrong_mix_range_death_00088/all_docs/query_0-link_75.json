I was born on October 31, 1994. My mother's names is Helen Lunzaga Leavell, born in the Philippines. My father's name is Lawrence Allen Leavell, born in Indianapolis in 1953. His father's name is Wilbur Cecil Leavell, Jr. My grand-mother's name is Ruth Ann Leavell.\n\nhttp://www.southbayriders.com/forums/showthread.php?t=123111&s=60a2e320b7b1581d71cc94849ffcfeab\n\nSOUTH BAY RIDERS FORUM\n\nRIP my Dad, Wilbur Cecil Bud Leavell 5/8/1928 - 6/18/2012\n\nThe following is a very long post but it is a worthy read.\n\n..For those that do not know, my Dad, Wilbur Cecil (Bud) Leavell, lived a very tough life. He was crippled in a car accident at age 13 with a shattered hip and severely disfigured face. The doctors initially did not believe he would survive. The accident was caused by a drunk driver and this is one of the reasons I do not drink alcohol.\n\n..Within 2 years, my Father had pushed himself until he was running cross country and competed in the State finals in his Senior year in High School. He showed his intense determination and will power very early.\n\n..My grandfather was permanently disabled in the same auto accident. Thus, Dad had to work to help support his family. My Grandfather had been a printer in the printer's union and at age 18 (1946), Dad entered that trade and continued that trade until his retirement in 1995. Dad always worked on everything. Printing presses, computers and cameras during the workday, cars, bicycles, building and maintaining our home, on the weekends and evenings. He rarely took something to some \"expert\" for repair. He would research it and figure out how to do it himself. Often, he would consult with experts for advice and more often than not, he would later teach THEM something about THEIR specialty that they did not know! ..In 2001, Dad suffered a severe stoke that left him paralyzed on the left side. The docs told us to expect him to die within 18 months. Dad's determination, ingenuity and work ethic had him walking with a walker in a little more than 12 months and making huge strides in speech therapy and more. He modified rehab equipment to fit his needs and help him excel at rehab. Dad always liked to \"teach\" (show up? thumb his nose at?...) the \"experts\" a few tricks and he taught many experts in rehab just how hard you could work and how far you could come back from a major stroke. Unfortunately, Dad suffered additional TIAs (mini strokes) that gradually took their toll and further taxed his strength. He still worked at rehab and staved off many debilitating effects but he could not stop the TIAs from happening.\n\n..December 2010, he became very ill with pneumonia and he almost died. He never recovered to the relative strength and mental vitality he had before the bout with pneumonia and the side effects. His health gradually declined over the last 18 months. He was very matter of fact about it and was not afraid of death. He discussed it openly and bravely and he and I made sure to never leave anything unsaid. I knew he loved me and was proud of me. He knew I felt the same about him and that I was so very thankful for all the things he taught me. I should mention that in all his endeavors and adventures, he included his children and we all learned many valuable life skills in these opportunities.\n\n..Just a short list of things I am thankful for my Dad's tutelage include (in no particular order):\n\nastronomy\n\nphotography\n\nmotor sports\n\nmechanics - from door locks to aircraft\n\nelectronics and electrical wiring\n\nreading\n\nnavigating - reading maps and a compass\n\nmotorcycle riding and repair\n\nalways seeking to learn more\n\ncarpentry\n\nplumbing\n\nroofing\n\nfinish carpentry\n\npainting\n\nwelding\n\ntree trimming\n\nHe even tried his hands at cooking. While his food preparation skills beyond the breakfast menu were edible, that is about all that be said but at least he did it. Besides, whats wrong with breakfast foods for lunch or dinner? No wonder Breakfast was his favorite meal! Luckily, my Mother and sisters augmented that portion of his repertoire to my benefit.\n\n..3 weeks ago he fell while transferring to his wheelchair. The fall fractured his hip. I knew this was bad news and soon as I heard it. His failing health had left him weaker by the day so I knew the resulting hospitalization/immobilization of a fractured hip would further accelerate his decline.\n\n..I spoke with him daily and planned my trip to come see him. He told me two weeks ago today that he had instructed the doctors to remove the IV, feeding tube and cease all life sustaining treatment. I knew then he was determined to make this the end. I also knew his determination would not fail. It never had!\n\n..His heath rapidly declined to the point where he could not eat. His \"gut\" had shut down and his kidneys and liver were following suit. When I arrived on Sunday 6/10, he was eating bits of ice chips and popsicles and even that refused to stay down. He eventually stopped even that.\n\n..He and I talked about his death. I was naive about what we were facing or I would have asked him many more questions to clarify exactly what he wanted. He had the appropriate advanced directives in place but those are minimized documents and need much more clarification as there are still many life-extending options left to the caregivers. He told me numerous times \"I just want to go to sleep and not wake up\"\n\n..Knowing what I know now that the \"palliative care\" that is supposed to keep the dying patient comfortable is inhumane BULL SHIT! In Ohio, they are unable to give enough pain meds while he was coherent to make him sleep and sleeping was the only time he was remotely comfortable. They refused to place him in a medically induced coma. I did not understand how to speak the code language of \"palliative care\". They are not allowed to tell you that \"if we give him more pain meds he will sleep\" they have to ask the family, the holder of the medical powers, if we THOUGHT he was uncomfortable and if we THOUGHT he was uncomfortable then they would give him more pain meds. Unfortunately, no matter how much we thought he was uncomfortable, they would not give him enough pain meds to fully knock him out so he could die in his unconscious state. In many other States, the patient/family is given control of a morphine pump that allows them to basically voluntarily OD. That option is not allowed in Ohio.\n\n..I won't go into specifics but seeing my Father's will power and strong heart fight each other and having my Mother witness it was entirely CRUEL TORTURE for everyone. I had not asked my father if the docs won't give you enough pain meds to put you out, do you want me to help you along. Again, not listing specific examples but if I had clarified his wishes on this point, he would not have suffered the end of life that he/we did suffer through.\n\n..I am sharing this life event with my friends as I urge them to:\n\n1) Try to accept that life is finite and plan accordingly, if not for your benefit then at least for your survivors' benefit.\n\n2) Discuss this openly and fully with your parents, siblings, children and anyone else that will either make your end of life decisions or that you will be required to make their end of life decisions.\n\n3) Make sure they FULLY understand your wishes and desires and if they can't or won't do what you want done, then appoint someone else that will.\n\n4) Document your end of life decisions.\n\n5) Make sure the care providers understand your end of life decisions.\n\n6) Urge legislatures to change the law to eliminate the needless limitations in end of life \"care\" that resulted in the torture my Father and Family just lived through.\n\n..Even in death my Father is STILL guiding and mentoring me! Love you Dad and always will!\n\n..The celebration of his life is being handled by Longs Funeral Home, 5528 Cleveland Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43231 614-891-1199\n\nThere will be a family calling/visitation at Longs on Friday June 22, 2012 from 6-8pm\n\nThere will be a funeral service on Saturday June 23, 2012 at 11am at the Morman Church at 307 Huber Village Blvd, Westerville, OH\n\n..If you wish to send flowers, please instead donate to your favorite animal shelter as that is a very worthy cause that my Father believed in and supported. If you wish to send flowers, please instead donate to your favorite animal shelter as that is a very worthy cause that my Father believed in and supported.\n\n.....iv.....DONALD EARL LEAVELL, born 21 Jan 1932 Indiana, died 02 Aug 2013 Roswell, Chaves, New Mexico, USA.\n\nhttp://www.lagronefuneralchapels.com/services.asp?page=odetail&id=29787&locid=11\n\n..Donald Earl Leavell, 81, of Roswell, died on August 2, 2013 at Eastern New Mexico Medical Center. A memorial service is scheduled for 2:00 P.M., on Tuesday, August 6, 2013 at Trinity United Methodist Church. Pastor Glenn Thyrion of Trinity United Methodist Church will officiate.\n\n..He was born on January 21, 1932 in Indianapolis, Indiana to Wilbur and Annie Mae Leavell, who have preceded him in death, as well as one brother, three sisters, one son: Jake Leavell and Roy Welborn.\n\n..Don got his education in Indianapolis where he later joined the United States Air Force at the ending of the Korean War. He and his first wife, Shirley and their family settled in Roswell. He was later employed as an Electronic Technician with FAA and was the Roswell Sector Field Office Chief. After retiring from the government, he worked part-time repairing bank equipment for many banks in Roswell. He also worked part-time for the Tom Madsen Truck Company.\n\n..Don received his pilots license at a young adult age. He spent some of his younger years raising homing pigeons. He would travel everywhere releasing them and waiting for them to return home.\n\n..He had many hobbies. He loved building remote control airplanes and flying them. He also loved motorcycles, enduros, races and riding with his family and friends.\n\n..He was a member of Trinity United Methodist Church and lots of different organizations in his younger and older years. He was a member of the Pecos Valley Amateur Radio Club. He enjoyed the annual tradition of Elk Hunting in Colorado. Don loved the mountains. He also really loved boxing on TV and surfed the channels constantly. Peg got used to it and finally started liking them (HAHA). The kids all learned they better not change the channel.\n\n..There was a softer side of Don. He loved his kids, grandkids and great-kids. They loved Paw Paws attention, as well. Most of all, well remember him as the guy who took time from this busy world to drop it and visit and to tell jokes for fun and laughter even though everyone had to drop everything when he arrived. He would always say, Oh well, everyone needs a break\n\n..He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Peggy; Sons: Keith Bud Leavell and wife Sharon of Arlington, Texas, Gene P. Leavell and wife Anne of Lubbock, Texas, and Bill Welborn of Belen, New Mexico; daughters: Donna Leavell of Roswell, Margie Stevens and husband Larry of Roswell, Beverly Kutzner and husband Randy of Snyder, Texas; Daughter-in-law: Juanita Leavell of San Diego, California; Sister-in-law: Ruth Ann Leavell of Ohio; Also 15 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren, as well as numerous nieces and nephews.\n\n1448.

J. H. Leavell wasn't there, as far as I could tell; but, I did find at least two other head stones and photographed them.

Leavell and his son...both born in South Carolina and both died in the Jewett, Texas area.\n\n.....On my way to the well site, I noticed several small cemeteries. Funny, I never even used to give them a passing thought and now, I wonder if some of my family might be in any of them. Well, my work should allow me time to explore and record anything I come up with. Maybe, if I don't find something for myself, I can help some one else.\n\n.....Oh, the lady I talked with, in Jewett, Texas is going to research the cemeteries in the county, for me. She says there is a book on each one.\n\n.....Try the picture again and if you still can't get it, I'll send it again...Here is another of Thaddeus Austell Weaver and Amanda C.
