        "text": "MEMPHIS -- Jim Stewart, the white Tennessee farm boy and fiddle player who co-founded Stax Records with his sister in a Black, inner-city Memphis neighborhood and helped build the soulful \"Memphis sound,\" has died at age 92.\n\nStewart died Monday surrounded by his family, the Stax Museum of American Soul Music announced in a news release. A cause of death was not disclosed and funeral plans were pending.\n\nStewart was co-founder of Stax Records in Memphis, where, during an era of racial strife, white musicians and producers worked alongside Black singers, songwriters and instrumentalists to create the \"Memphis sound\" embodied by Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, The Staple Singers and many others.\n\n\"There was so much talent here, under circumstances that were almost considered impossible in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1960, with the racial situation here,\" Stewart told The Associated Press during an interview in May 2013 -- his first in at least 15 years. \"It was a sanctuary for all of us to get away from the outside world.\"\n\nStax and its affiliated record labels released 300 albums and 800 singles between 1959-75, according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Stax fostered a raw sound born from Black church music, the blues and rock 'n' roll.\n\nBefore Stax went bankrupt in 1975, the recording studio in Memphis' \"Soulsville\" neighborhood produced lasting hits such as Otis Redding's \"Dock of the Bay,\" Eddie Floyd's \"Knock on Wood\" and Sam & Dave's \"Soul Man.\"\n\nStewart grew up on a farm in Middleton, Tenn., before moving to Memphis to attend Memphis State University and joining the Canyon Cowboys as a country music fiddler. He was recording country music in his wife's uncle's garage and working at a bank when he and his sister, Estelle Axton, founded the Satellite record label in 1957.\n\nIn 1961, after learning of a California label with the Satellite name, Stewart and Axton decided to combine the first two letters of their last names to create a new name, Stax. The pair moved the studio into an old movie theater on the corner of McLemore and College streets in Memphis.\n\nSoon, young musicians from the neighborhood started hanging around, helping Stax build a house band that included organist Booker T. Jones, guitarist Steve Cropper, bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson Jr. -- also known as Booker T. and the M.G.s.\n\nStewart said he turned Stax into a soul and R&B label after hearing Ray Charles sing \"What'd I Say.\"\n\n\"I had never heard anything like that before. It allowed me to expand from country into R&B, into jazz, into gospel, wrapped all in one. That's what Stax is,\" Stewart said.\n\nStax signed a distribution deal with Atlantic Records and brought in the songwriting team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter. Stewart also hired Al Bell as Stax's national sales director, and the label continued growing and producing more hits, such as \"Who's Making Love\" by Johnnie Taylor.\n\nIn 1968, Stewart, Axton and Bell sold Stax to Gulf & Western in exchange for stock.\n\nStewart and Bell repurchased the label in 1970. Stax saw a few more successes in the early 1970s, but cash flow started to slow down, bills stopped being paid and lawsuits were filed.\n\nStewart sold his share of Stax to Bell in 1972. Three creditors forced Stax into involuntary bankruptcy in 1975, marking the death of Stewart's brainchild.\n\n\"He was hurt,\" Axton told The Commercial Appeal for an August 1989 article.\n\nThe studio was torn down in 1989. Since then, Stax has been rebuilt and reborn in the form of a museum, music academy and charter school.\n\nStewart, who mostly stayed out of the public eye after Stax stopped making music, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nIn 2013, Stewart made a rare appearance at Stax, touring the museum before visiting with the teenage musicians who attended the Stax Music Academy. Stewart made a few other appearances at Stax after that, including in 2019 for a news conference to announce plans for the academy's 20th anniversary.\n\n\"The music is still alive and that's what's great about it,\" Stewart said during the 2013 tour. \"I'm very proud of what they have done.\""
