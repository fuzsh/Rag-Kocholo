        "text": "American musician (1947–2017)Template:SHORTDESC:American musician (1947–2017)\n\nGregory LeNoir Allman (December 8, 1947 – May 27, 2017) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He was known for performing in the Allman Brothers Band. Allman grew up with an interest in rhythm and blues music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with rock music, jazz, and country at times. He wrote several of the band's biggest songs, including \"Whipping Post\", \"Melissa\", and \"Midnight Rider\". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven studio albums. He was born and spent much of his childhood in Nashville, Tennessee, before relocating to Daytona Beach, Florida and then Richmond Hill, Georgia.\n\nHe and his brother, Duane Allman, formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 live album At Fillmore East. Shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, with Brothers and Sisters (1973) their most successful album. Allman began a solo career with Laid Back the same year, and was perhaps most famous for his marriage to pop star Cher for the rest of the decade. He had an unexpected late career hit with his cover of the song \"I'm No Angel\" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, Low Country Blues (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance abuse, which formed the basis of his memoir My Cross to Bear (2012). His final album, Southern Blood, was released posthumously on September 8, 2017.\n\nAllman performed with a Hammond organ and guitar, and was recognized for his soulful voice. For his work in music, Allman was referred to as a Southern rock pioneer[1] and received numerous awards, including one Grammy Award; he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. His distinctive voice placed him 70th in the Rolling Stone list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\".[2]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nGregory LeNoir Allman was born on December 8, 1947, at Saint Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee to Geraldine Robbins Allman (1917–2015) and Willis Turner Allman (1918–1949).Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The couple had met during World War II in Raleigh, North Carolina when Allman was on leave from the U.S. Army, and were later married. Their first child, Duane Allman, was born in Nashville in 1946. On December 26, 1949, Willis offered a hitchhiker a ride home and was subsequently shot and killed in Norfolk, Virginia.[3][4] Geraldine moved to Nashville with her two sons and never remarried.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Lacking money to support her children, she enrolled in college to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)—state laws at the time, according to her son, required students to live on-campus.[5]\n\nAs a result, Gregg and his older brother were sent to Castle Heights Military Academy in nearby Lebanon.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. A young Gregg interpreted these actions as evidence of his mother's dislike for him, though he later came to understand the reality: \"She was actually sacrificing everything she possibly could—she was working around the clock, getting by just by a hair, so as to not send us to an orphanage, which would have been a living hell.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. While his brother adapted to his surroundings with a defiant attitude, Allman felt largely depressed at the school. With little to do, he studied often and developed an interest in medicine—had he not gone into music, he hoped to become a dentist.[6] He was rarely hazed at Castle Heights as his brother protected him, but often suffered beatings from instructors when he received poor grades.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The brothers returned to Nashville upon their mother's graduation, and moved to Daytona Beach, Florida in 1959.[5] Allman would later recall two separate events in his life that led to his interest in music. In 1960, the two brothers attended a concert in Nashville with Jackie Wilson headlining alongside Otis Redding, B.B. King, and Patti LaBelle.[6] Allman was also exposed to music through Jimmy Banes, a mentally handicapped neighbor of his grandmother in Nashville, who introduced him to the guitar.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nGregg worked as a paper boy to afford a Silvertone guitar, which he purchased at a Sears when he saved up enough funds.[5] Like his brother, he was left-handed, but played the guitar right-handed. He and his brother often fought to play the instrument, though there was \"no question that music brought\" the two together.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. In Daytona, they joined a YMCA group called the Y Teens, their first experience performing music with others.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He and Duane returned to Castle Heights in their teen years, where they formed a band, the Misfits.[7] Despite this, he still felt \"lonesome and out of place\", and quit the academy.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He returned to Daytona Beach and pursued music further, and the duo formed another band, the Shufflers, in 1963.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He attended high school at Seabreeze High School, where he graduated in 1965.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. However, he grew undisciplined in his studies as his interests diverged: \"Between the women and the music, school wasn't a priority anymore.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nMusical beginnings[]\n\nFirst bands (1960–1968)[]\n\nThe two Allman brothers began meeting various musicians in the Daytona Beach area. They met a man named Floyd Miles, and they began to jam with his band, the Houserockers. \"I would just sit there and study Floyd ... I studied how he phrased his songs, how he got the words out, and how the other guys sang along with him\", he would later recall.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. They later formed their first \"real\" band, the Escorts, which performed a mix of top 40 and R&B music at clubs around town.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Duane, who took the lead vocal role on early demos, encouraged his younger brother to sing instead.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He and Duane often spent all of their money on records, as they attempted to learn songs from them. The group performed constantly as music became their entire focus; Allman missed his high school graduation because he was performing that evening.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. In his autobiography, Allman recalls listening to Nashville R&B station WLAC at night and discovering artists such as Muddy Waters, who later became central to his musical evolution.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He avoided being drafted into the Vietnam War by intentionally shooting himself in the foot.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nThe Escorts evolved into the Allman Joys, the brothers' first successful band. After a successful summer run locally, they hit the road in fall 1965 for a series of performances throughout the Southeast; their first show outside Daytona was at the Stork Club in Mobile, Alabama, where they were booked for 22 weeks straight.[8] Afterwards, they were booked at the Sahara Club in nearby Pensacola, Florida, for several weeks.[9] Allman later regarded Pensacola as \"a real turning point in my life\", as it was where he learned how to capture audiences and about stage presence.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He also received his first Vox keyboard there, and learned how to play it over the ensuing tour.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. By the following summer, they were able to book time at a studio in Nashville, where they recorded several songs, aided by a plethora of drugs. These recordings were later released as Early Allman in 1973, to Allman's dismay.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He soon grew tired of performing covers and began writing original compositions.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. They settled in St. Louis, Missouri for a time, where in the spring of 1967 they began performing alongside Johnny Sandlin and Paul Hornsby, among others, under various names. They considered disbanding, but Bill McEuen, manager of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, convinced the band to relocate to Los Angeles, giving them the funds to do so.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Script error: No such module \"Listen\". He arranged a recording contract with Liberty Records in June 1967,Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. and they began to record an album under the new name the Hour Glass, suggested by their producer, Dallas Smith. Recording was a difficult experience; \"the music had no life to it—it was poppy, preprogrammed shit\", Allman felt.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Though they considered themselves sellouts, they needed money to live.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. At concerts, they declined to play anything off their debut album, released that October, instead opting to play the blues.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Such gigs were sparse, however, as Liberty only allowed one performance per month.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. After some personnel changes, they recorded their second album, Power of Love, released in March 1968. It contained more original songs by Allman, though they still felt constricted by its process. The band broke up when Duane explicitly told off executives at Liberty. They threatened to freeze the band, so they would be unable to record for any other label for seven years.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Allman stayed behind to appease the label, giving them the rights to a solo album. The rest of the band mocked Allman, viewing him as too scared to leave and return to the South.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Meanwhile, Duane began doing session work at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where he began putting together a new band. He phoned his brother with the proposition of joining the new band—which would have two guitarists and two drummers. With his deal at Liberty fulfilled, he drove to Jacksonville, Florida, in March 1969 to jam with the new band.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He called the birth of the group \"one of the finer days in my life ... I was starting to feel like I belonged to something again.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band and mainstream success[]\n\nMain article: The Allman Brothers Band\n\nFormation, touring, and Duane's death (1969–1971)[]\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band moved to Macon, Georgia,Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. and forged a strong brotherhood, spending countless hours rehearsing, consuming psychedelic drugs, and hanging out in Rose Hill Cemetery, where they would write songs and more—\"I'd be lying if I said I didn't have my way with a lady or two down there\", said Allman.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. In addition to Gregg, the band included Duane and Dickey Betts on guitar, Berry Oakley on bass, and Jaimoe and Butch Trucks on drums.[10] The group remade blues numbers like \"Trouble No More\" and \"One Way Out\", in addition to improvising jams.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band's main songwriter, composing songs such as \"Whipping Post\" and \"Midnight Rider\".Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The group's self-titled debut album was released in November 1969 through Atco and Capricorn Records,[11] but suffered from poor sales.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The band played continuously in 1970, performing over 300 dates on the road,Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. which contributed to a larger following.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Their second record, Idlewild South,Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. was issued in September 1970, and also received a muted commercial response.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nTheir fortunes began to change over the course of 1971, where the band's average earnings doubled.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. \"We realized that the audience was a big part of what we did, which couldn't be duplicated in a studio. A lightbulb finally went off; we needed to make a live album\", said Gregg.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. At Fillmore East, recorded at the Fillmore East in New York, was released in July 1971.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. At Fillmore East peaked at number thirteen on Billboard's Top Pop Albums chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America that October, becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Although suddenly very wealthy and successful, much of the band and its entourage now struggled with addiction to numerous drugs; they all agreed to quit heroin, but cocaine remained a problem.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. His last conversation with Duane was an argument over cocaine: Gregg took some of his brother's supply, and later denied it when accused. In his memoir, My Cross to Bear, Gregg wrote: \"I have thought of that lie every day of my life ... told him that lie, and he told me that he was sorry and that he loved me.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nDuane was killed in a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971, in Macon.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. At his funeral, Gregg performed \"Melissa\", which was his brother's favorite song.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. \"I tried to play and I tried to sing, but I didn't do too much writing. In the days and weeks that followed, ... I wondered if I'd ever find the passion, the energy, the love of making music\", he remembered.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. As the band took some time apart to process their loss, At Fillmore East became a major success domestically. \"What we had been trying to do for all those years finally happened, and he was gone,\" Gregg remembered.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He later expanded upon his brother's passing in his memoir:\n\nTemplate:Blockquote\n\nMainstream success and fame (1972–1976)[]\n\nAfter Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. They completed their third studio album, Eat a Peach, that winter, which raised each member's spirits: \"The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing Eat a Peach\", said Allman.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Eat a Peach was released the following February, and it became the band's second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on Billboard's album chart.[10] \"We'd been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever\", Allman recalled.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The band purchased 432 acres of land in Juliette, Georgia, which became a group hangout.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Berry Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from the death of his friend,Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. and in November 1972 he too was killed in a motorcycle crash.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. \"Upset as I was, I kind of breathed a sigh of relief, because Berry's pain was finally over\", Allman said.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Script error: No such module \"Listen\". The band unanimously decided to carry on, and enlisted Lamar Williams on bass and Chuck Leavell on piano. The band began recording Brothers and Sisters, their follow-up album, and Betts became the group's de facto leader during the recording process.[12] Meanwhile, after some internal disagreements, Allman began recording a solo album, which he titled Laid Back. The sessions for both albums often overlapped and its creation caused tension within the rest of the band.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Both albums were released in late 1973, with Brothers and Sisters cementing the Allman Brothers' place among the biggest rock bands of the 1970s. \"Everything that we'd done before—the touring, the recording—culminated in that one album\", Allman recalled.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. \"Ramblin' Man\", Betts' country-infused number, rose to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and gave the band their biggest hit.[10] The group returned to touring, and played arenas and stadiums almost solely. Privately, the group was dealing with miscommunication and spiraling drug problems.[10]Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. In 1974, the band was regularly making $100,000 per show, and was renting the Starship, a customized Boeing 720B used by Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. \"When [we] got that goddamn plane, it was the beginning of the end\", said Allman.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nBand member relationships became increasingly frustrated, amplified by heavy drug and alcohol abuse.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. In January 1975, Allman began a relationship with pop star Cher—which made him more \"famous for being famous than for his music\", according to biographer Alan Paul.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The sessions that produced 1975's Win, Lose or Draw, the last album by the original Allman Brothers Band, were disjointed and inconsistent.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Upon its release, it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor; the band later remarked that they were \"embarrassed\" by the album.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Though their relationships were fraying, the Allman Brothers Band went on tour for some of the biggest crowds of their career.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Allman later pointed to a benefit for presidential candidate Jimmy Carter as the only real \"high point\" in an otherwise \"rough, rough tour\".Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The \"breaking point\" came when Allman testified in the trial of security man Scooter Herring, who was arrested and soon convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.[10] Bandmates considered Allman a \"snitch\", and he received death threats, leading to law-enforcement protection.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Herring received a 75-year prison sentence, but he only served eighteen months.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The band refused to communicate with Allman after the ordeal and finally broke up.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe continued playing together in Sea Level, Betts formed Great Southern, and Allman founded the Gregg Allman Band.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nMid-career and struggles[]\n\nMarriages, breakups, and music (1977–1981)[]\n\nAllman married Cher in June 1975, and the two lived in Hollywood during their years together as tabloid favorites.[3] Their marriage produced one son, Elijah Blue Allman, who was born in July 1976.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He recorded his second solo album, Playin' Up a Storm, with the Gregg Allman Band, and it was released in May 1977. He also worked on a collaborative album with Cher titled Two the Hard Way, which, upon its release, was a massive failure.[12] The couple went to Europe to tour in support of both albums,[13] though the crowd reception was mixed.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. With a combination of Allman Brothers fans and Cher fans, fights often broke out in venues, which led Cher to cancel the tour.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Turmoil began to overwhelm their relationship, and the two divorced in 1978.[14] Allman returned to Daytona Beach to stay with his mother, spending the majority of his time partying, chasing women, and touring with the Nighthawks, a blues band.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band reunited in 1978.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Allman remembered that each member had their own reasons for rejoining, though he surmised it was a combination of displeasure with how things ended, missing each other, and a need for money.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The band's reunion album, Enlightened Rogues, was released in February 1979 and was a mild commercial success.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Betts's lawyer, Steve Massarsky, began managing the group,Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. and led the band to sign with Arista, who pushed the band to \"modernize\" their sound.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Drugs remained a problem with the band, particularly for Betts and Allman.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The band again grew apart, replacing Jaimoe with new guitarist Dan Toler's brother Frankie.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The band considered their post-reunion albums—Reach for the Sky (1980) and Brothers of the Road (1981)—\"embarrassing\", and subsequently broke up in 1982. \"It was like a whole different band made those records ... In truth, though, I was just too drunk most of the time to care one way or the other\", Allman would recall.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nDowntime, a surprise hit, and another reformation (1982–1990)[]\n\nAllman spent much of the 1980s adrift and living in Sarasota, Florida with friends.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. His alcohol abuse was at one of its worst points, with Allman consuming \"a minimum of a fifth of vodka a day.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He felt the local police pursued him heavily; during this time, he was arrested and charged with a DUI.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. While he did not consider himself \"washed up\", he noted in his autobiography that he kept a \"fear of everybody forgetting about you.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Southern rock had faded from view and electronic music formed much of the pop music of the decade. \"There was hardly anybody playing live music, and those who did were doing it for not much money, in front of some die-hard old hippies in real small clubs\", he later recalled.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Nevertheless, he reformed the Gregg Allman Band and toured nationwide.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. At one point, he attempted to reconnect with his children, though, according to him, \"it just wasn't a good situation\".Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nBy 1986, having grown tired of financial instability, Allman approached Betts for a co-headlining tour, a sort-of Allman Brothers reunion.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. After recording several demos, Allman was offered a recording contract by Epic Records.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. His third solo release, I'm No Angel (1987), sold well; its title track became a surprise hit on radio. Allman released another solo album the following year, Just Before the Bullets Fly, though it did not sell as well as its predecessor. In the late 1980s, he moved to Los Angeles.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He married Danielle Galliano in what he dubbed midlife crisis.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The marriage began with Allman overdosing—\"so [it] started off with a bang\", he said.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He dabbled in acting for the first time, taking a small part in the film Rush Week (1989),Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. and his final role two years later in Rush. Allman greatly enjoyed the experience: \"It was a different facet of the entertainment industry, and I wanted to see how those people worked together.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The Allman Brothers Band celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 1989, and the band reunited once more for a summer tour, with Jaimoe again on drums.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. They featured guitarist Warren Haynes and pianist Johnny Neel, both from the Dickey Betts Band, and bassist Allen Woody.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The band returned to the studio with longtime producer Tom Dowd for 1990's Seven Turns, which was considered a return to form.[10]Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. \"Good Clean Fun\" and \"Seven Turns\" each became big hits on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The addition of Haynes and Woody had \"reenergized\" the ensemble.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nReforming the band and breaking addictions (1991–2000)[]\n\nThe newly reformed Allman Brothers began touring heavily,Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. which helped build a new fan base: \"We had to build a fan base all over again, but as word of mouth spread about how good the music was, more and more people took notice. It felt great, man, and that really helped the music\", Allman recalled.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Neel left the group and the band added percussionist Marc Quiñones, formerly of Spyro Gyra, the following year.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. They recorded two more studio albums—Shades of Two Worlds (1992) and Where It All Begins. In 1993 his youngest daughter Layla Brooklyn Allman was born while Gregg was living in Novato, California. When his relationship with Shelby Blackburn ended, Layla and Shelby moved back to Los Angeles. Allman's older daughter, Island, came to live with him in Novato, and despite early struggles, they eventually grew very close.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. \"Island is the love of my life, she really is\", he would later write.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could barely make it through his acceptance speech.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. He hired two in-home nurses that switched twelve-hour shifts to help him through the process.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He was immensely happy to finally quit alcohol, writing later in his autobiography: \"Did I get any positive anything out of all that? And you've got to admit to yourself, no, I didn't. You can see what happened and that by the grace of God, you finally quit before it killed you.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nFor much of the 1990s, Allman lived in Marin County, California, spending his free time with close friends and riding his motorcycle.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He recorded a fifth solo album, Searching for Simplicity, which was quietly released on 550 Music in 1997.[12] The album's title reflected his search \"for a more simple life\" following his rehabilitation from drugs and alcohol.[15] Despite positive developments in his personal life, relationships began declining in the band yet again.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov't Mule, feeling as though a break was imminent.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. The group recruited Oteil Burbridge of the Aquarium Rescue Unit to replace Woody on bass, and Jack Pearson on guitar.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Concerns arose over the increasing loudness of Allman Brothers shows, which were largely centered on Betts.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. \"It had ceased to be a band—everything had to be based around what Dickey was playing\", said Allman.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Pearson, struggling with tinnitus, left as a result.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Butch Trucks phoned his nephew, Derek Trucks, to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Anger boiled over within the group towards Betts, which led to all original members sending him a letter, informing him of their intentions to tour without him.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. All involved contended that the break was temporary, but Betts responded by hiring a lawyer and suing the group, which led to a permanent divorce.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. That August, Woody was found dead in a hotel room in New York,Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. which hit Allman particularly hard.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. In 2001, Haynes rejoined the band,Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. setting the stage for over a decade of stability within the group.\n\nLater life[]\n\nTouring and health problems (2000–2011)[]\n\nAllman moved to Richmond Hill, Georgia, in 2000, purchasing five acres on the Belfast River.[16] The last incarnation of the Allman Brothers Band was well-regarded among fans and the general public, and remained stable and productive.[10] The band released their final studio album, Hittin' the Note (2003), to critical acclaim.[17] Allman co-wrote many songs on the record with Haynes, and he regarded it as his favorite album by the group since their earliest days. The band continued to tour throughout the 2000s, remaining a top touring act, regularly attracting more than 20,000 fans.[10] The decade closed with a successful fortieth anniversary celebration at the Beacon Theater, where the band would hold residencies most years during their reunion.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. In 2014, the Allman Brothers Band performed their final concerts, as Haynes and Derek Trucks desired to depart the group.[18][19]\n\nAllman struggled with health problems during the last years of his life. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 2007, which he attributed to a dirty tattoo needle.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. By the next year, three tumors were discovered within his liver.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He went on a waiting list and after five months, he underwent a successful liver transplant in 2010.[20]\n\nIn 2011, Allman went public about his battle with hepatitis C. He headlined Merck and the American Liver Foundation's \"Tune In to Hep C Campaign\" to raise awareness and urge baby boomers to get tested and treated.[21] As part of Tune In to Hep C, The Allman Brothers Band headlined a hepatitis C fundraiser and awareness concert at the Beacon Theater in New York. The concert raised $250,000 to benefit the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable and the American Liver Foundation for education and awareness efforts.[22] The National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable in October 2017 created the Gregg Allman Hepatitis C Leadership Award – an annual award to posthumously honor Allman and others who work on behalf of people living with hepatitis C. Michael Lehman, Allman's longtime manager, accepted the award on his behalf.[23]\n\nAllman's seventh album, Low Country Blues, was produced by T-Bone Burnett. Upon its release in January 2011, it represented Allman's highest-ever chart peak in the U.S., debuting at number five.[24] He promoted the album heavily in Europe, until he had to cancel the rest of the trip due to an upper respiratory infection.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. This led to lung surgery later in 2011,[16] and rehab in 2012 for addiction following his treatments.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. That year, Allman released his memoir, My Cross to Bear, which was 30 years in the making.[25] In 2014, a tribute concert was held celebrating his career; it was later released as All My Friends: Celebrating the Songs & Voice of Gregg Allman.[26]\n\nFinal years and death (2012–2017)[]\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Allman Brothers, Allman kept busy performing music with his solo band, releasing the live album Gregg Allman Live: Back to Macon, GA in 2015.[27] In 2016, he received an honorary doctorate from Mercer University in Macon, presented by former President Jimmy Carter.[28] However, his health problems remained; he had atrial fibrillation, and though he kept it private, his liver cancer had returned. \"He kept it very private because he wanted to continue to play music until he couldn't\", his manager Michael Lehman said.[29] He attempted to keep a light schedule at the advice of doctors, who warned that too many performances might amplify his conditions.[26] His last concert took place in Atlanta at his own Laid Back Festival along with ZZ Top at Lakewood Amphitheatre on October 29, 2016[30] (the 45th anniversary of his brother's death), and he continued to cancel concerts citing \"serious health issues\".[29] He denied reports that he had entered hospice care, but was resting at home on doctor's orders.[31]\n\nAllman died at his home in Richmond Hill, Georgia, on May 27, 2017, due to complications from liver cancer[32][33] at the age of 69.[34] His funeral took place at Snow's Memorial Chapel in Macon on June 3, and was attended by once-estranged bandmate Dickey Betts, his ex-wife Cher, and former President Carter, among others. According to Rolling Stone, the mourners dressed casually in jeans per Allman's request, and \"hundreds of fans, many wearing Allman Brothers shirts and listening to the band's music, lined the route along the funeral procession.\"[35] He was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, beside his brother Duane, and fellow band member Berry Oakley.[36]\n\nBefore his death, Allman recorded his last album, Southern Blood, with producer Don Was at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The album was recorded with his then-current backing band.[37] The album was released on September 8, 2017,[38] and received critical acclaim.[39]\n\nIn My Cross to Bear, Allman reflected on his life and career:\n\nTemplate:Blockquote\n\nMusical style and songwriting[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Listen\". Allman's style was rooted in rhythm and blues music. He characterized his work with the Allman Brothers Band as \"playing some blues with some jazz mixed in.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. He was introduced to blues music through musician and childhood friend Floyd Miles,Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. who later toured with Allman as a part of his solo band.[40] He also gave him advice on how to sing from his stomach, as opposed to his chest. Allman was inspired by \"Little Milton\" Campbell, who \"inspired me all my life to get my voice crisper, get my diaphragm harder, use less air, and just spit it out. He taught me to be absolutely sure of every note you hit, and to hit it solid.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. After his death, many outlets credited Allman as among the greatest white blues vocalists of his time.[41] Many close to Allman disputed this, with son Devon Allman commenting, \"My dad didn't see color. ... I know people mean well when they say the best white blues singer, but I say take white off of there, because he was just one of the best ever. He just channeled so much feeling.\"[42] Jaimoe called the label \"straight bullshit. He's a great blues singer. A great singer, period.\"[43] An editorial published in the Roanoke Times questioned that while Allman could rightfully be considered a cultural appropriator, \"Is that not the nature of music, or art in general, that it borrows from different cultures to create something new?\"[44] Likewise, A Newsweek tribute to Allman noted that \"Ray Charles took grief for making a country and western album, too.\"[45]\n\nAs a songwriter, Allman wrote several famous songs, including \"Whipping Post\", \"Melissa\", and \"Midnight Rider\", which he dubbed the \"song I'm most proud of in my career\". He could be a very slow songwriter, writing only when inspiration struck. If the song was forced, he felt it could end up contrived. In My Cross to Bear, his 2012 memoir, he laid out his approach to songwriting: the first verse introduces a story, it is expounded upon in the second, and the third may serve as an epilogue.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Allman credited singer-songwriter John D. Loudermilk, whom he first met while touring with the Allman Joys, as an influence on his writing. \"[He] taught me to let the song come to me, not to force it, not to put down a word just because it might rhyme or fit. He taught me to let the feeling come from your heart and go to your head.\"Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. Allman received the Songwriter Award from the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in the last year of his life.[46]\n\nOn 28 October 2021, Sony Music Publishing announced it had signed a global agreement with Gregg Allman's estate to administer its catalog of songs. The deal covered many of Allman's compositions from his time as a member of the Allman Brothers Band, as well as songs written throughout his solo career.[47]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nAllman was married seven times:\n\nHe married Shelley Kay Jefts in 1971; they divorced the following year. They had a son, Devon.\n\nHe married Janice Blair in 1973; they divorced in 1974. She is pictured on the sleeve of Laid Back.\n\nHis most well-known relationship was with Cher, whom he married in 1975. They had a son, Elijah Blue, and divorced in 1978.\n\nHe wed Julie Bindas in 1979; they had a daughter, Delilah Island, and divorced in 1981.\n\nHe married Danielle Galliano in 1989; they divorced in 1994.\n\nHis longest marriage was to Stacey Fountain, from 2001 to 2008—\"seven out-of-sight years\", he remarked.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nIn 2012, he announced his engagement to Shannon Williams, who was 40 years his junior.[48] They were quietly married in February 2017.[49]\n\nIn My Cross to Bear, he writes that \"Every woman I've ever had a relationship with has loved me for who they thought I was\".Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found. At the time of its writing, he noted that he only spoke to two out of his then-six ex-wives, including Cher.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nAllman had five children, three with various wives and two with other women he had relationships with:\n\nson Michael Allman was born on July 3, 1966.

In his memoir, he stated: \"As long as you have spirituality, you're never alone. It's sort of like my mother said all those years ago: now I have my own kind of faith, just like other people. They take what they want of faith, and they leave the rest alone, and I do the same. That's the way it should be.\" He credited his sixth wife, Stacey Fountain, with helping him increase his faith.Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Footnotes/anchor_id_list' not found.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nMain article: Gregg Allman discography\n\nStudio\n\nLaid Back (1973)\n\nPlayin' Up a Storm (1977)\n\nTwo the Hard Way (1977) (with Cher)\n\nI'm No Angel (1987)\n\nJust Before the Bullets Fly (1988)\n\nSearching for Simplicity (1997)\n\nLow Country Blues (2011)\n\nSouthern Blood (2017)\n\nLive\n\nThe Gregg Allman Tour (1974)\n\nGregg Allman Live: Back to Macon, GA (2015)\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes Template:Tooltip 1989 Rush Week Cosmo Kincald 1991 Rush Will Gaines\n\nTelevision[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes Template:Tooltip 1975 Cher Himself 1990 Superboy Samuels Episode: \"Carnival\" 1992 Tales from the Crypt Toland Episode: \"On a Deadman's Chest\" 2000 Family Guy Himself Episode: \"Let's Go to the Hop\"\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of Hammond organ players\n\nMidnight Rider (film)\n\nReferences[]\n\nSources\n\nPage Template:Refbegin/styles.css has no content.\n\nFurther reading[]\n\nLua error in Module:Citation/CS1/Utilities at line 38: bad argument #1 to 'ipairs' (table expected, got nil).\n\n[]\n\nPage Module:Side box/styles.css has no content.\n\nOfficial website\n\nMichael Lehman, Gregg's Manager sits down with Ira Haberman of The Sound Podcast shortly after Gregg's passing\n\nGregg Allman at Find a Grave\n\nTemplate:Gregg Allman Template:The Allman Brothers Band Template:1995 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"
