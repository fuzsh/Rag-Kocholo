Loyd son of Ledford Thomas and Una Angel. Information sent to Fredwyn for book.\n\nRoberta, the daughter of Millard and Lydia Knuckles, was born on January 31, 1925, in Wasioto, Kentucky. Roberta always said that as a young girl she was a tomboy. She attended Bell County High School where she played the flute in the band. During her high school years, she was chosen as anattendant for the Mountain laurel Festival. On July 28, 1942, in Detroit, Michigan, Roberta married lloyd Mason Thomas. Della Knuckles Doan and Paris Doan were the witnesses. Roberta was 17 and lloyd was 22. They most likely eloped. The marriage certificate states that Roberta was 21. lloyd and Roberta had known each other for a long time. Lloyd worked in Millard Knuckles' store and also attended Bell County High School. In addition, Roberta's brothers, James Oscar and Brown Lee, were lloyd's good friends. lloyd and Oscar attended Sunday School together and enjoyed singing together. lloyd Thomas was born in Trace Fork, Kentucky, on May 23, 1920. His parents were Ledford Thomas and Una Angle. ( I am not sure if the spelling is Angle or Angel. In my Thomas family Bible, it is spelled Angle.) Ledford Thomas was a coal miner, a hard worker, and a good man. Una Angle deserted her husband and children when lloyd was a small child. lloyd was a Boy Scout, attended Sunday School faithfully, and loved to sing and to play baseball. After their marriage, lloyd and Roberta remained in Detroit. lloyd worked in a factory. Lloyd hadcontracted polio as a small child, which left him with a limp. Because ofthe limp, he was declared 4-F and was unable to join the military. Roberta also worked in a factory for a time. They were still living in Detroit when, on November 17, 1943, their daughter, Donna Lee, was born. Because Roberta had a respiratory condition that was not improving, on the advice of her doctor, in 1945, she and lloyd and Donna moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix was to be their home for many years to come. Not long after arriving in Phoenix, lloyd and Roberta found lodging at the Far West Auto Court. During WW II, there was a housing shortage in Phoenix. Eventually, they earned the trust of the owner and became the managers of Far West Auto Court. lloyd also began working at Reynolds Aluminum Company along with holding a part-time job at a dry cleaners. Lloyd worked for Reynolds Aluminum until he retired in 1980. His job title was tube tool repairman.\n\nIn time, Lloyd and Roberta were in a position to buy their first home. Since lloyd was very handy, he made all the improvements to their new home himself. In a few years, they sold this home, purchased another, fixed it up, sold it, purchased another, and so on. With each sale, they were able to make a modest profit. Roberta and Lloyd were always devoted and loving partners who worked together shoulder-to-shoulder. During this period, Roberta learned to sew and made many of her own clothes as well as Donna's.\n\nA by-product of buying, fixing up, and selling their homes was that Roberta became interested in selling real estate. She decided to become a licensed real estate agent and in time became a real estate broker. As it turned out, she was a natural-born sales person and was very successful. When she and\n\n'Lloyd-moved to Wickenburg (about 30 miles from Phoenix) in the 1970's, she opened her own real estate office which she called Desert Casas Realty.lloyd and Roberta were very devout Christians. They were members of Capital Christian Church(Disciples of Christ) in Phoenix for many years. Lloyd served as a deacon and was eventually elected tobe Chairman of the Board of Directors of the church. Lloyd also was the catcher on the church baseball team. (Donna was the team scorekeeper.) Roberta served as a Sunday School teacher and was the sponsor of one of the church youth groups. Donna was also very involved in church activities and youth groups. She held offices within her local church youth group as well as offices on the state youth group level. Donna also sang in the chOir, played the piano and organ in church, and taught a Sunday School class. Roberta Thomas passed away in Phoenix on S,!!ptember 1, 1980, at the age of 55. Her life was cut short by the respiratory condition she had bravely fought and endured since her youth. lloyd Mason Thomas passed away in Phoenix on March 21, 1990, at the age of 69. His passing was due to heart disease.\n\n[DI15840] Born feb. 14, 1927, in Pineville, Kentucky, Ruby passed away peacefully on Dec. 25, 2009, in Surprise, Arizona, at the age of 82.

In 1972, she graduated with high distinction from Glendale Community College with an Associate of Arts degree. In 1948, Ruby married her beloved husband Johnny, who was serving in the U.S. Army. Ruby was able\n\nto join Johnny when he was stationed in Japan in the «i»1950's «/i»and in France in the 1960's. Over the years, they were also stationed in San Francisco at the Presidio and in various locations in Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania. During several periods of her life, Ruby lived in Phoenix with her sister and brotherin- law, Roberta and Lloyd Thomas. In 1965, after the untimely passing of her husband, Ruby, along with her son Steve, relocated to Phoenix in order to be near her sister and brother-in-law.\n\nAfter settling in Phoenix, Ruby developed a serious interest in and expert knowledge of Native American arts and crafts. This expertise led to a very fulfilling career in the marketing and sale of Native American handicrafts. At various times in Phoenix, she worked for Godber's, Gilbert Ortega, and the Camelback Inn. In Yellowstone National Park, she worked for Hamilton Stores and for the Yellowstone Park Company. While with the Yellowstone Park Company, she served as a dorm supervisor, and she was promoted to gift shop manager. Ruby also worked at the Grand Teton Lodge and in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. An avid reader, Ruby read books on a wide range of topics. She especially liked louie L'amour and other western authors. Ruby enjoyed music, especially Country and Western, and had a large collection of LP's, cassette tapes, and CD's. John Denver was one of her favorites. Her favorite movies were Dances with Wolves and Lonesome Dove. She treasured her collection of stuffed animals. She loved the bears the best - especially one she called \"Gus the Grizzly.\" Ruby always enjoyed the o!!t-of-doors and had a deep love and appreciation of the beauty and grandeur of nature. She was an amatuer geologist and a rock hound. She enjoyed picnics and barbeques and was always ready for a hike. Ruby liked hiking the trails of the White Tank Mountains, and she was proud to have climbed to the summit of Squaw Peak. The photographs Ruby took over the years of landscapes in Arizona and Wyoming demonstrate her talent as a photographer. Ruby had a style of her own. She was usually seen wearing blue jeans, a casual shirt, a tooled leather cowboy belt or Concho belt, pieces of turquoise and silver Native American jewelry, and, now and then, even her cowboy boots. Ruby had a gentle, kind, unassuming manner and an amusing sense of humor. She was a loving Wife, mother, sister, and aunt as well as a valued friend. She will be greatly missed by her family and friends.\n\nA graveside memorial service will be held for Ruby at the Wickenburg Cemetery at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, Jqnuary 23, 2009.\n\n[NI15841] Moved to Michigan, living Burton MI in 2009\n\n[BI15841] Name: Charles C Knuckles\n\nDate of Birth: 18 Feb 1929\n\nCounty: Bell\n\nMother's name: Sylia Grace\n\nVolume Number: 107\n\nCertificate Number: 53263\n\nVolume Year: 1929\n\n[DI15841]\n\nSocial Security Death Index about Charles C Knuckles\n\nName: «tab»Charles C Knuckles «tab»\n\nBorn: «tab»18 Feb 1929\n\nDied: «tab»22 Jan 2012\n\nState (Year) SSN issued: «tab»Michigan (Before 1951)\n\n[NI15842] A Franklin Delano Knuckles married 1/5/1974 in Campbell Co, TN to Connie Elaine Maggard born 7/21/1950 and gave his date of birth 12/31/1940.

Robert NI CHOLS/NUCKLES (the father) is found with both surnames in court documen ts in Amherst County VA, whereas he is listed as NICHOLS in his will in 1826 in Mercer County KY. I put this down to illiteracy (both on the pa rt of Robert and those who wrote the documents). There is a series of la nd transfers in Amherst County VA, in which Robert and his wife Fanny (Whitten) buy out the inheritance of her sistersthe other daughters of Jeremi ah WHITTEN, in which Robert is called NUCKLES. However, his two marriage records in Amherst County list him as NICHOLS. I believe that this Robert NICHOLS/NUCKLES is a grandson of Howard CASH of Amherst County VA per Howard Cash's 1773 will in that county, in which he mentions a daughter Elizabeth NICKLAS.\n\nIn the name of God Amen. I Robert Nichols of the county of Mercer and state of Kentucky finding my days are drawing to a close but in my perfect senses, do make this my last will and Testament in manner following. I desire that all my first debts be paid for the purpose subject my whole Esta te both real and personal I give & bequeath to my wife Fanny Nicles my negro woman Susanah and one negroe named Chips & sixty acres of land includi ng my Dwelling house and other necessary buildings sentible thereto--the l and to be laid off suitable so as to give her timber sufficient to suppo rt the place. I give her two horses such as she may make choice of wi th as much of every kind of all my other stock as she may see proper to ke ep, as much household & kitchen furniture & farming utensils as she wish es to keep during her natural life.. I Devise to my son William Nicho ls on negroe boy named John & seventy acres of land including the place wh ere he now lives to be laid off in a manner most suitable so as not to int erfere with the other land I give to my other sons. I devise to my son Jer emiah Nichols one negroe boy named Powell, seventy-six acres of land inclu ding the place he settled & formerly lived on. I devise to my son Robert Nichols one negroe boy named Dick & seventy-six acres of land including t he place he now lives on. I devise to my son James Nichols one negroe gi rl named Sally and sixty-two acres of land adjoining his mother's land & at my wife decease he is to have the land I give to her. I desire th at my wife shall keep possesion of James's land and negroe until he is twe nty-one years of age, unless he gets married before. I further desire th at my son James shall have a horse, saddle & Bridle as near the value of t hat I gave my other sons as can be made so soon as he shall need them, all so one cow & calf, two sheep, one sow & pigs, two fat hogs equal to tho se given to my other sons, also one bed & furniture. I desire that the bal ance of my personal property shall be sold & equally divided amongst my ch ildren after so much shall be taken therefrom as will be sufficient to p ay for schooling James one year.
