        "text": "Profession: Singer-Songwriter and Producer\n\nBiography: Although his life and career were tragically cut short by his death in a plane crash in 1967, aged 26, Otis Redding is still regarded today as one of the most influential soul singers and songwriters.\n\nThe son of Georgian sharecroppers, Otis Redding's career was a mere five years, but in that time he was able to forge a new more natural stage persona distinct from the more polished Motown acts, and write such classic standards as \"Respect\" (a top ten hit for Aretha Franklin), \"These Arms of Mine\", and \"I've Been Loving You Too Long\". As a performer, his original songs, as well as covers such as his re-worked versions of \"Try A Little Tenderness\", \"Shake\", and \"Satisfaction\", are memorable.\n\nIn 1967, he was one of the star performers at the Monterey Pop Festival alongside Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. Just before his death he made a series of innovative recordings including \"Sittin' On the Dock of the Bay\" - a huge crossover hit that sold more than 2 million copies and became the first posthumous Billboard No.1 single.\n\nRedding has been inducted in to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1989); the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1994); and the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame (2017)\n\nIn 2008 Rolling Stone ranked Otis Redding as 8th on their list of Greatest Singers Of All Time.\n\nBorn: September 9, 1941\n\nBirthplace: Dawson, Georgia, USA\n\nGeneration: Silent Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Snake\n\nStar Sign: Virgo"
