Last, and certainly not least, I thank LaVonne Lee, my best friend and wife of over 30 years, who was by my side throughout this project, lending her support, clerical help, and editing, and even spending a great deal of time looking at microfilm for hard to find obituaries. Without her encouragement and support The Baseball Necrolog y would not be possible. It is to LaVonne that I dedicate this work.\n\nThe compilation of The Baseball Necrology required the assistance of too many people to list individually. I am fearful of leaving some out and also mindful of keeping the size of the book at a manageable level. They include librarians and sta› at state libraries, state historical societies, state university libraries, and local city and county libraries. They also include personnel in county courthouses, especially in California, cemetery caretakers all over the United States, and funeral directors all over the country as well. Please accept my sincerest statement of gratitude. Spending over six months a year for five years traveling to gather the information\n\nv\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS Acknowledgments v Introduction 1 The Necrology 5 Appendix: Ballplayers by Cemetery 445 Bibliography 517\n\nvii\n\nINTRODUCTION States from the ¡8th century to present. Each state has one, and in a few instances more than one, central repository, or newspaper morgue, of this microfilm. These are usually at a state library, a state historical library, a state university, or as in the case of Massachusetts, the Boston Public Library. Using various versions of the baseball encyclopedia as a guide, between ¡997 and 200¡, I visited each of these locations at least once, and some two or more times, gathering data for The Baseball Necrolog y. Supplementing the obituary research, I also used information from public records, cemetery records, many calls to cemetery caretakers and funeral directors and, occasionally, visits to local libraries — especially in Texas. Information in obituaries varies greatly from a single line that may only list the name of the decedent and the funeral director to pages of biographical information, some of which is of little interest for the purposes of The Baseball Necrolog y. Obituary information in large city newspapers is usually the most sparse, while those of smaller towns are more wordy. Consequently, the short descriptive entries in The Baseball Necrolog y vary according to what information was available. In a good many cases an obituary might give a blow-byblow description of the decedent’s baseball career, information that is not included in\n\nDuring a baseball player’s career as a player, everything he did is well documented. Every at bat — every hit — every pitch. This information is written about, talked about, hashed and rehashed, sometimes for years afterward. But the reflexes slow, the eyes grow dim, or the arm gets sore. The crowd quits cheering and the ballplayer’s days in the limelight are over. Unlike most other professions, the baseball player’s career is over at an age when most other careers are just beginning. Sometime between age 25 and age 45, usually in the early 30’s, the ballplayer is through as a performer, but he still has twenty to forty useful years ahead of him. What did the ballplayers of the past do with those twenty to forty years? The Baseball Necrolog y addresses this subject on more than 7600 now deceased baseball players, as well as other personalities in the game of baseball, giving their cause of death and the location of their final resting place. The vast majority of information contained in The Baseball Necrolog y came from newspaper obituaries. The United States Newspaper Project (USNP), a cooperative national e›ort among the states and the federal government, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, has located, cataloged and preserved on microfilm, newspapers published in the United 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Baseball Necrolog y, but little insight regarding what he did in the thirty years following his baseball days. A large portion of obituaries in the large cities of California, where over ¡¡ percent of the population of late ballplayers died, fit the category of having only single line entries. Fortunately, in California death records are available to the public at County Recorder o‡ces. Consequently, I visited most of California’s 58 county courthouses at least once, some of them twice, in order to gather the desired information. A special mention must also be made about my chosen home state of Texas. The central repository of newspapers in Texas is the Center for American History in Austin. Even though this library is one of the leading benefactors of funds from the USNP, it has one of the poorest collections of newspapers encountered on this project, not even having good coverage for some of the state’s major cities. This made it necessary to visit many local libraries throughout one of the largest states in order to do justice to the nearly 5 percent of ballplayers who died in Texas. In about ¡0 percent of the population of deceased major league ballplayers I was unable to locate an obituary of any sort, or any indication that the person ever lived or died. This could be for several reasons. A good many of them died in the Latin countries of North, Central and South America. Because of cultural and language barriers no attempt was made to research outside the United States. This is left for the research of some ambitious person in the future. Other reasons for missing obituaries are that a newspaper was not readily available in the location the person died, or because I didn’t have the correct death place or date. It could be that the person was at a location he wasn’t known when he died and that an obituary exists somewhere in another area, or that there just wasn’t an obituary printed. In some instances I was unable\n\n2\n\nto locate a newspaper for the time and place where the person died. A good many of the ballplayers listed in The Baseball Necrolog y played in only one season, some maybe in only a single game or just part of an inning. Even though such players may be somewhat obscure, the decision was made early in the course of my research to include every person who ever played in a major league game. The reason for this was twofold. First, where does one draw the line — be it more than one season — more than two seasons — more than a single game? Wherever the line was drawn, someone of some importance to someone would be left out, so all are included. Second, the major leagues are the utopia of baseball — the goal of every ballplayer who ever played the game. In order for that ballplayer to have made it to the major leagues he had to be pretty good and well known at some level, and therefore included in this history of deceased major league baseball players. There were many really good minor league players who never made it to the major leagues, but they are not included for the very reason that they did not ever play in the major leagues. Some people who have reviewed my manuscript have been critical of the fact that I do not indicate who the player played for. This is for many reasons. First, this is not a baseball book. It is a book about baseball players — what they did after their baseball playing days were over, cause of death, and where they are buried. What they did as baseball players is well documented in various versions of the Baseball Encyclopedia, and I strongly recommend that every true baseball fan own the latest version of this outstanding reference work. Also, the size of The Baseball Necrolog y has always been a major concern, and therefore including more baseball related information would only make it larger and more unwieldy. Finally, also size related, some of these ballplayers played for many teams during their\n\n3\n\ncareers — some for several teams in just a single season. The Baseball Necrolog y includes all of the following information I could locate for any deceased person who ever played in a major league baseball game, and also some other baseball personalities such as umpires, managers, owners, administrators, announcers, sportswriters and those who played in the Negro Leagues: Player — The number of years played in the major leagues and the primary position played. The number of years as a field manager (if applicable) Hall of Fame indication Date and place of birth Date and place of death Military Service, when found Obituary information about his afterbaseball career Cause of death Burial place In rare instances, an interesting piece of baseball trivia was found in an obituary\n\nIntroduction\n\nthat I have included, thinking that it could be lost if I didn’t capture it. If the number of years and primary position are excluded, it was because the person was a baseball personality and not a player. Some parts of the above information might be, and in a good many instances is, missing. If I couldn’t find it, I was unable to include it. The very sizeable appendix presents burial locations for all players and personalities for whom I could find information, arranged by state, then city and then cemetery. As with any research project of this size, there are errors. These may be clerical errors, errors of interpretation or errors of omission. The compiler has made every e›ort to keep these to a minimum, but they are there, and with the reader’s support they can be corrected in future editions. Please write in care of the publisher and let me know what needs to be corrected and what is the accurate information. If a reply is requested, please enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope.
