        "text": "September 9, 2018\n\nThis is the middle book in a trilogy – the first being, “Detroit ‘67” and the final, and forthcoming title, “Harlem ’69.” In, “Detroit ‘67” the book revolved around Motown and this volume centres on Stax, while also telling the story of a tumultuous year in Memphis.\n\nThe first of January saw the city of Memphis reluctantly negotiating the process of racial integration, but ridding themselves of segregation was to be a slow process and not helped by the new mayor, Henry Loeb. So contentious was Loeb’s election as mayor, that he was sworn in at his own home, after an acrimonious election. Loeb’s wealthy family owned a chain of launderettes in the city, while he promised to turn back the process of integration.\n\nWithout doubt, these entrenched views on segregation led to the events which caused riots in the city. Two garbage men, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, were forced to take shelter in the back of their truck when it rained (garbage men, being all black, were not allowed to sit at the side of the road, even to eat lunch). This policy of keeping out of sight, led to the two men perching on the back, when it malfunctioned and they were pulled, horribly, into the compactor, heads first. Their deaths led to a strike and Loeb, as former public works commissioner, was blamed.\n\nWith the city in turmoil, Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. came to the city to support the strikers. Their marching, wearing banners which stated simply, “I am a man,” was a powerful symbol and King was keen to add his weight to their protests. However, as Black Power was growing, King found that his ideas of peaceful protest was becoming unpopular with many – impatient and angry, they wanted change now. However, when King was assassinated, it seemed the end of an era and only highlighted the importance of the Civil Rights movement.\n\nThese political events unfold always with an eye on Stax, who also started the year in difficulties – having lost their star, Otis Redding, at the end of the previous year and split from Atlantic at the beginning of 1968. Stax was owned by Jim Stewart and his sister, Estelle Axton, who were white. Although those involved at the time attest that Stax was a place of unity and togetherness, the events of that year would test all those linked to the company. With rioting outside, those white workers, and musicians, felt suddenly afraid. There were voices of dissent, such as Al Bell, who brought a new ambition and self-confidence, as well as a desire for businesses to be owned by those who made the money, but never seemed to benefit from it.\n\nAuthor Stuart Cosgrove has, again, painted an excellent picture of the events and people involved with soul music in the place, and year, he has chosen. He paints a picture of grinding poverty, casual violence and mounting tension. We read of the Black Panthers, Black Power salutes at the Olympics, peaceful protests being hi-jacked by violent protestors, tragedy and of groups being infiltrated by the police. Through such momentous events, though, Cosgrove does not lose sight of the personal, nor of the music. We have acrimony between Aretha Franklin and Mahalia Jackson, downright aggression between unhappy duo, Sam and Dave and casual violence doled out at Stax. A fantastic read and I look forward to reading the last book in the trilogy.\n\nDecember 13, 2021\n\nThis is the second in a trilogy about soul music and the events unfolding in a US city in a particular year. Detroit 67 had me hooked but not so much this one. Memphis 68 felt less cohesive and, for me, less compelling. That isn’t to say the author hasn't done some incredible research and written a great piece of twentieth century musical and social history.\n\nMemphis was the home of Stax, and that music company and its artists are one half of the story, and the other half, events unfolding in Memphis in 1968. The year begins with the death of Stax’s biggest star, Otis Redding. Come April, the city was the location for the murder of civil rights leader Martin Luther King. He was there to support striking sanitation workers, an entirely African American workforce, who faced appalling working conditions.\n\nThe irony of Stax, which the author considers 'blacker’ than the ‘bubblegum pop ‘of Motown in Detroit, is that Stax was white owned and had mainly white musicians, whereas Motown was African American owned and the musicians were almost exclusively African American.\n\nIf you enjoy soul music and modern American history, it is well worth a read.\n\nJuly 18, 2018\n\nMemphis 68 is the middle book in Stuart’s soon to be completed trilogy of soul music. 1968 was a turbulent year in Memphis and the book delves into Martin Luther King , the Civil Rights battle and the Black Power Movement . However music and on particular Stax music is the pillar to this interesting and easily accessible book. Thank goodness for Spotify - I am listening to that soundtrack that underpins the book. I cannot wait until next Father’s Day when my son buys me Harlem 69 - the final part of the triptych,\n\nMay 18, 2022\n\nIt’s a risky thing to start this book after the events of late 1967, with the cover hinting that Otis will cast a long shadow over the events. But Cosgrove is a canny enough writer to know that by starting his story with the after effects of that awful shock, the even more horrifying events of April 1968 and the death of Martin Luther King feels like a chaotic howl of pain from an area just barely keeping it’s shit together after the Redding tragedy\n\nIt’s a more disparate story than the Detroit volume, because that could combine the tragedy of Florence Ballard and the controlled world of Berry Gordy as sort of mirror images of each other. This is more the story of a terrible moment of horror and the combined PTSD and fallout it had for all concerned for the rest of the year. Cosgrove is a better writer here and less prone to cliche, and is again very even handed (especially in the case of frequent scapegoat Johnny Baylor), albeit far more willing to point the finger at Jerry Wexler as the architect of Stax’s real decline than the other books have done\n\nIt’s also, again, fucking astonishing on a sociological level with a really fierce intellect and quiet anger simmering through the whole book. Cosgrove is a very clever man and a very astute one. He knows how to tell one hell of a story but never allows that to overwhelm the real story he wants to tell: that of the continued suppression of the black people of the United States and their fierce desire to articulate their rage and power and experiences through music\n\nJuly 31, 2022\n\nJesus this book is worrying tip-toeing as a not very covert far right wing apologist, especially when it comes to the police, who at this time were using sub machine guns water canons, dog attacks and rifles on black civil right protestors, the author never empathizes with their emotional pain instead his approach is cartoonishly mockery or dramatic savagery both dehumanizing, whilst casually acknowledging the presence of the national guard in the aftermath of Dr King’s murder where he describes the protest as ‘satanic rage’ and ‘wanton destruction’ while remaining objective in describing Dr King’s murderer, and the racist documented information surrounding it. Cosgrove insists on a convoluted circular reparative narrative that allows for the monolithic narrative of Black Power as a reductive racist criminal movement towards white people violent whilst omitting its roots and intentions in self empowerment and a dignity long denied them by systemic racism, this is illustrated by the sad death of the sanitation workers Echol Cole and Robert Walker and the omission of their families grief or anything of their lives, the dehumanising of black people as violent agitators. How this book won the Penderyn music book prize is beyond me I can only guess the mindset of the panel, or very few contenders.\n\nFebruary 5, 2021\n\nThe second of Stuart Cosgrove's Soul triology is another fascinating read. Each book focuses on a particular year in the life of a specific city and the record label it is indelibly linked with; in this case its a snapshot of a heady, tempestuous time for Stax, in Memphis, in a year when tensions over segregation threatened to spill over, a fatal plane crash ripped the heart out of the label, and the assassination of Martin Luther King did the same for the whole country. Like its predecessor, this book is filled with nuggets of information about the many characters, stars, background figures, charlatans, thugs, and visionaries, including the likes of Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes. A minor criticism in that a couple of these nuggets were repeated when a character re-entered the story in a later chapter, which was a little jarring, but minor editing oversights can't detract from the book's appeal.\n\nJune 22, 2018\n\nThe second book in Cosgrove’s ‘soul’ trilogy which tells the story of African-American social history in the 60s through its music & three key locations (Detroit, Memphis & Harlem).\n\nThis second volume broadly takes as its focus the Memphis based Stax record label and its artists. However death stalks the book. It opens in the closing weeks of 1967 with the plane crash into a frozen lake which killed Otis Redding & most of his band. It covers the assassination of Martin Luther King & the violence which follows it and ends with the shooting of a young couple as they are out Christmas shopping.\n\nIt’s lacks a bit of the focus of the previous book (Detroit ‘67) but as a study of an important time in Black American history it’s still an essential read.\n\nAugust 24, 2021\n\nI must admit that I started with the third book last year in this Soul Trilogy, and now moving on to the second. \"Memphis 68: The Tragedy of Southern Soul\" maintains the momentum of his other books, being well research and jam packed with fascinating music and social history snippets. Focusing on Memphis, Stax records and their many artists of note (Redding, Hayes, Cropper and Booker T for example), Cosgrove examines the music scene in the a year of racial tensions, labour disputes, and the Vietnam War. A great read for fans of Soul and music generally. I look forward to reading the first book in the series.\n\nApril 30, 2019\n\nThe second in Cosgrove’s Soul Trilogy suffers from some of the same criticisms I had of Detroit 67. There’s a tendency to repeat certain facts and incidents as well as occasionally circular writing. There are a couple of glaring errors and a lot of typos, but arguably that’s down to the need for a decent proofreader. The focal point of the book is the legendary Stax Records following the death of Otis Redding, and while this was genuinely interesting, it was the social history of the city that really stood out.\n\nMarch 28, 2018\n\nJust as it's predecessor Detroit 67 did, Cosgrove focuses on the seismic events that overwhelmed Memphis in 1968 to create a marvellous narrative around the music of the city and how that interacted with the wider world.\n\nEssential reading not only for fans of the music but also for those interested a more street-level view of Memphis.\n\nLooking forward immensely to the final part of this trilogy of books.\n\nApril 3, 2019\n\nThoroughly engrossing and enjoyable read and smack dab in the epicentre of my musical obsessions: MEMPHIS. I have records by most of the people he writes about, even the long-forgotten ones. But these are more than a music books: the real triumph of the trilogy is his skilfully placing music and musicians in the socio-political context of 1968, and still keeping it a great read. One less star than Detroit 67 as this one is a tad bittier. Harlem 69 next, can't wait!\n\nNovember 29, 2017\n\nSoul man\n\nA heady brew of soul , civil rights and politics ; cosgrove gives an insight into the most dramatic of years in one of America's most incendiary cities.\n\nIf I had one criticism I wish it has been longer and slightly more in depth in areas of particular interest to me.\n\nIll give no spoilers , but highly recommended.\n\nJanuary 28, 2019\n\nI enjoyed 68 Memphis as it helped amplify what I had learned after a visit to Memphis, the National Civil Rights Museum, which also included Stax Records, Sun Records, and Graceland along with two nights on Beale Street. The book is clear and direct without a lot of spin the book put you in the action of a unique period of American civil rights movement. Recommend the book.\n\nJuly 5, 2019\n\nThis book sweats soul.\n\nComing from detroit, Motown has always been my music. After reading this book and listening to the artists while reading, it was Stax where the real soul was coming from. An amazing read\n\nSeptember 14, 2020\n\nBrilliant snapshot of a city burning with hatred\n\nSuperb storytelling by a man steeped in the history of soul music. Unbelievable detail and plenty notes taken to compile a scorching Stax playlist\n\nSeptember 22, 2021\n\nThe 2nd book in the trilogy of soul music by Stuart Cosgrove the 1st was detroit 67 and the 2nd memphis 68 is another great read if you love soul and black history read this book now on to the final book harlem 69\n\nFebruary 21, 2018\n\nSuperb story of the converging events from Memphis 1968, from the Memphis invaders through to MLKs killing. I remain fascinated with the music, commentary and social history of soul music across the USA. Can’t wait for Harlem 69.\n\nJune 22, 2018\n\nanother fantastic read from mr cosgrove. really takes you to the heart of it and leaves no stone un-turned. bring on Harlem 69.\n\nSeptember 15, 2018\n\nCosgrove mixes music with history in a fascinating narrative that encompasses Otis Redding, the assassination of MLK, Elvis, and virtually all of Stax Records and the great artists in that universe.\n\nJune 6, 2020\n\nI loved this book. A perfect blend of social history and music history.\n\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nFascinating look into politics, music and civil rights history in Memphis.\n\nAugust 25, 2023\n\nGood overview of the decline of Stax Records . Not as heavily political as the previous book .\n\nSolid"
