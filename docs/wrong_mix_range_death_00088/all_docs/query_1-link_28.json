        "text": "Friends in Naples, FL- I'll be at the Irish Times Bar and Grill (just behind Flemings steakhouse at Vanderbilt and hwy 41) at 4 pm this Friday. LOVE to see you and catch up (and at my book signing on Saturday at the Waterside Shops Barnes and Noble from 11am-2pm...get your personally signed copyl!).\n\nFriends in Naples, FL: I'll be at the Waterside Shops Barnes and Noble bookstore for a book signing on SATURDAY, MARCH 23RD from 11am-2pm. Stop by and get your personally signed copy of my book!\n\nAs the great Quickdraw McGraw once said, \"HOOOOLD ON THAR!\" We had to move my King Curtis book signing to Saturday, March 23rd at 11a.m. at the Barnes and Noble bookstore at the Waterside Shops in Naples. Looking forward to seeing and visiting with everyone again, as well as talking about King Curtis!!\n\nWill you be in Naples, FL on March 16, 2024? I've arranged for a book signing at the Barnes and Noble bookstore at the Waterside Shops at 11 a.m.! Love to see you there and chat about King Curtis with you (as well as get you a signed copy of the book).\n\nHappy Heavenly 90th Birthday to one of the most underappreciated musical influences of his generation, King Curtis. Poised to launch into superstardom, we are all left to wonder what his global impact would have been had he not been murdered at the age of 37 in 1971. I'm grateful to all the musicians, producers and friends who talked to me over the last 20+ years to help get Curtis's story out. LONG LIVE THE KING.\n\nWhile interviewing the \"who's who\" of the Rock and Roll, soul, jazz and blues music worlds, I was only nervous once. Isaac Hayes. World philanthropist, music writer, performer, actor, voice of Chef on \"South Park.\" I saw him perform with the Cyrus Chestnut Quartet in Naples, FL in March 2002. At the \"meet and greet\" afterwards, he had me completely intimidated and couldn't have been nicer. A great moment. Shout out to friend Lance Provance for the photos.\n\nI just received the year-end newsletter from my publisher, the University of North Texas Press, and what do you know? My King Curtis biography, \"Soul Serenade: King Curtis and His Immortal Saxophone,\" is #2 on their Top Ten Best Sellers list for 2023! So thrilled to see that King Curtis's story is generating significant interest, he was incredibly talented and a major influence on musicians and producers of his era. Have you ordered your copy yet?!!?\n\nHere's a recent Amazon Prime commercial featuring King Curtis's raucous \"Memphis Soul Stew.\" Is there any wonder why I've devoted the last 22 years of my life to this man? Stunning. https://lnkd.in/gsd2c8Sr"
