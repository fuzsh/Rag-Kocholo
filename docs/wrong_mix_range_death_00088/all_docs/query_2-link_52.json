With every detail from the shape of the room, to the acoustical ceiling and walls, to the placement of the furniture and speakers, prepare for an educational audio experience like no other. Your moment of discovery awaits in The Central Station’s private listening studio.\n\n• Playlists •\n\nTune in\n\nExperience The Central Stations signal in the privacy of your guest room. With playlists curated by our own in house DJ’s, you’ll discover Memphis music coming through your own personal speaker. Take a moment to enjoy the sounds of the mid-south and learn the history and details behind some popular recordings as well as some other more obscure songs in Memphis history.\n\n• Music Curator •\n\nChad Weekley\n\nJONE$ has been DJing and crate digging since he could walk. Born downriver in New Orleans and raised just north of Memphis, he learned his trade from the greats that he considers his “Mount Rushmore” of the DJ scene: Dante Carfagna, Cut Chemist, DJ Shadow, Mr. Dibbs, and Eothen Alapatt With Carfagna and Luke Sexton, JONE$ cofounded the now-legendary Memphis label, committing over ten 45s and a full-length album to vinyl. Jone$ and Carfagna collaborated on the brilliant and mysterious 17-song black rock compilation Chains & Black Exhaust, which was released sans liner notes or track listing to critical acclaim in 2003. In 2017, JONE$ released a mixtape of 80’s sweet soul & funk on the Los Angeles record label Hobo Camp Records. Today, his number one gig is his family and leading The Central Station’s very own Memphis music experience."
