He is the master of Tintagel Castle (Din-Tagell) and is the husband of the ravishing Ygerna (Igraine, in other texts), whose charms were an irresistable temptation to King Uther. Gorlois was slain in combat at St. Dennis (Dimilioc), unsuccessfully defending his lands and wife against Uther's forces.\n\nGorlois (Gwrlais in Welsh) may have been a governor of Cerniw (Cornwall), the western portion of Dumnonia, under King Erbin. His historicity is confirmed by the evidence of place-names such as Carhurles (Caer-Wrlais) and Treworlas (Tre-Wrlais). Late pedigrees, attributed to Iolo Goch, suggest he was a descendant of Gerdan, a younger son of King Solor of Cernyw (Glywysing). It may either be through coincidence or confusion that Gorlois' ancestry stems from Cernyw (Glywysing), while he lived in Cerniw (Cornwall).\n\n”\n\nThe cited information was published in www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/bios/gorlois.html in 2000 The author/originator was David Nash Ford,.\n\nSource/Citation References (1)\n\nIndividual: Gwyr Llew Of Scotland\n\nEnglish Origins of New England Families, Vol. 1\n\nThe cited information was published by Gen.

These men and their families, were living in this area in \"pre-Emanuel\" days.\n\nIn December 1812, Emanuel County was created by the Georgia legislature, being taken from territories then embraced by Bulloch and Montgomery counties. Since then, Emanuel has been sliced several times to satisfy new county demands, furnishing land for Jenkins, Johnson, Toombs and Candler counties. \"\n\n”\n\nThe cited information was published by Part of the GAGenWeb & USGenWeb Projects in http://www.rootsweb.com/~gaemanue/brfhist.htm\n\nSource Notes\n\nMore than 250 years ago the Lower Creek Indians lived in the territory now known as Emanuel County. They hunted wild game for food and pelts; held their War and Green Corn dances; fished in the Ohoopee and Canoochee Rivers; roamed the forests; giving confirmation of their dwelling in arrowheads and other relics still found today. The Indians, though signing many treaties, were not driven out fully until 1837. These Indians generally lived more in peace than in war until the white man (Spaniards, French and English) came to \"the new world\".\n\nIt was this struggle, combined with a hope for economic enrichments for the sponsors, that served as the chief incentive for founding the colony of Georgia at Savannah by England's General James Oglethorpe in 1733. The colonists were to be citizen-soldiers, supply the mother country with natural resources while keeping the Spanish, the French and the Indians away from the better established colonies to the north. Contrary to many popular modern-day histories, Oglethorpe led a well-appointed body of militia-citizens onto the bluffs at Savannah. There were only a few \"prison debtors\" and none were dregs.\n\nEnticed by the possibility of owning their own land and a advantageous fur trade with the Indians, early Savannahians and migrants primarily from the Carolinas began to move westward and southward, settling frequently along water routes. By 1741, the Trustees considered it in the interest of good government to divide the young colony into two counties: Frederica and Savannah. The latter included settlements on the Savannah River and on both banks of the Great Ogeechee River. These two counties were subdivided into districts. This design continued until 1752 when the trustees relinquished the charter of Georgia, but their appointees remained in office until the Royal Governor arrived and Georgia became a Royal Province.\n\nThe most important act passed by the Provincial Legislature was a measure dividing the several districts into eight parishes for establishment of religious worship according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England.\n\nOn February 5, 1777, the parishes were replaced by counties, this being ratified by the first State Constitutional Convention in Savannah. The section of Georgia now know as Emanuel County became a part of Washington County. From Washington County, later on, was formed Montgomery County, with its county seat at one time located within five miles of what is now Swainsboro.\n\nThe first citizens of this area, as mentioned in Lucian Lamar Knight's Georgia Landmarks, included James Moore, William Stephens, Henry Durden (or Durdeno), George Rountree, Richard Edenfield, M. Thigpen, A. Gardener, N. Rowland, E. Sain, James Tapley, John Snell, James Hicks, William Phillips, J. Sutton, E. Lane, B. Johnston, John Wiggins, P. Newton, William Rowland, William Norris, J. Norris, S. Powell, John Rhiner, M. Cuhl, S. Kennedy, E. Coleman, D. E. Rich, E. Wilks, S. Williamson, B. Key and J. C. Sumner.\n\nThere were others of course, as indicated by the names of Revolutionary War soldiers whose wills or the administration of their estates are found in Emanuel County records. The list includes Jonathan Coleman, Abram S. Lane, John Clifton, David Edenfield, Ephriam Herrington, Joseph Sumner, Jacob Durden and Henry Brown. These men and their families, were living in this area in \"pre-Emanuel\" days.\n\nIn December 1812, Emanuel County was created by the Georgia legislature, being taken from territories then embraced by Bulloch and Montgomery counties. Since then, Emanuel has been sliced several times to satisfy new county demands, furnishing land for Jenkins, Johnson, Toombs and Candler counties.\n\nEmanuel was named for Governor David Emanuel, one of Georgia's earliest chief executives and a soldier of the Revolution, fighting under the command of his brother-in-law, General John Twiggs. He was a native of Pennsylvania, born in 1744, of German parents. He came to Georgia just before the Revolution and settled on Walnut Creek near Waynesboro, later moving to the head of Beaver Dam Creek.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Emanuel was captured while acting as a scout near McBean Creek. A British soldier was ordered to shoot him and promised his clothing. The story is told that Emanuel was almost naked when he escaped and made his way to friendly American forces.\n\nEmanuel was a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1789 and 1795. He served in both branches of the General Assembly, was three times president of the State Senate. In 1801, when Governor James Jackson resigned the governors office to become U. S. Senator, David Emanuel became governor by virtue of his position in the State Senate. Governor David Emanuel served the State of Georgia from March 3, 1801 until November 7, 1801 at which time Josiah Tattnall became Governor.\n\nGovernor Emanuel was a Presbyterian and is believed to be buried in Burke County, but efforts to locate his grave have failed.\n\nEmanuel County was created in December 10, 1812 through a bill introduced in November 1812 by State Senator Stephen Swain.\n\nOn November 18, 1814, an Act was approved by Governor Early designating a site for public buildings in Emanuel County. It was restricted to within one mile of the place pointed out by Jesse Mezzel as the center of the county and it was to be located on the highest hill within three miles of Steve Rich's horse lot near Modoc, where the first court in Emanuel County was allegedly held.\n\nThis hill, 317 feet high, is now the site of the Emanuel County Courthouse. Commissioners appointed to locate the county seat were Edward Lane, Francis Pugh, Needham Cox, Eli Whitdon, Euriah Anderson, Jesse Mezzle and Archibald Culbreath. The site agreed upon for the county seat was made permanent by an Act approved December 6, 1822, and the name of the town was to be Swainsboro, and was named for Senator Stephen Swain.\n\nThere were very few roads leading into Emanuel County before the Civil War so many travelers missed the beauty of this quaint place, therefore, very little of the history has been written on Emanuel County, even though Emanuel County is replete with historical data. The current county population is about 20,546 according to the 1990 census.\n\nMost of this history was taken from \"Emanuel Memories: 1776-1996\" Â©, published by The Forest Blade. This is an excellent research source. No comprehensive history of Emanuel County has been written and only a few attempts have been made to preserve the heritage.\n\nBack to Emanuel Co.\n\nPage Copyright Â© 2000-2005 Nancy Gay Crawford, Emanuel Co.

He had married her ca. 353. Her father was probably Flavius Eusebius, a former consul; the family came from Thessalonica. Her brothers were Flavius Eusebius and Flavius Hypatius, consuls in 359. She was well known for her beauty and her influence over her husband; like him, she was an advocate of the Arian heresy. Although it seems that Eusebia may have become close to Julian and convinced her husband to make Julian a Caesar, she allegedly caused Julian's wife Helen to have a number of miscarriages to prevent her from having offspring since she herself could not bear children.\n\nThe last traces of her influence were the raising of her two brothers to the consulship in 359 and the freeing of her family's possessions from taxation on 18 January 360. Soon afterward she died from a drug which she took as a remedy for her inability to bear children. After Eusebia's death, Constantius married a woman named Faustina at Antioch in 361; after his death she bore him a daughter, Flavia Maxima Faustina Constantia. When Procopius revolted in 365/6, in order to ensure the loyalty of his troops, he took Faustina and her daughter with him. Constantia later married the emperor Gratian ca. 374. She clearly died before her husband because he took another wife. She seems to have died no later than 383 because her remains arrived in Constantinople in August of that year.\n\n”\n\nThe cited information was published in http://awtc.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=harpist327&id=I00610\n\nSource/Citation References (1)\n\nIndividual: Eusebia\n\nAncestors of American Presidents\n\nThe cited information was sourced from Book published by New Eng Hist.

It was named after the traumatic shipwreck of the \"Third Supply\" bringing reinforcements to Virginia in 1609. The leaders of that expedition were shipwrecked in Bermuda and had to take their wrecked ship apart and build two smaller ships to finally get to Virginia. Bermuda Hundred was initially intended to include several \"hundreds\" upstream and downstream of the Appomattox River.The Bermuda settlements were attacked severely in 1622, when the natives abandoned their efforts at peaceful coexistence. Bermuda Hundred never gained prominence again until 1864 when a Union Army occupied it. The Federal troops came very close to capturing Petersburg and ending the Civil War, before being bottled up on the peninsula.\n\nTelephone:\n\nPhone: (804) 748-1000\n\nWebsite:\n\nwww.co.chesterfield.va.us/tourism/located.asp\n\n”\n\nThe cited information was sourced from Website / URL published in http://www.virginia.org/johnsmithtrail/jstsites.asp?loop=oxbow&siteNum=12&attrID=36941&noFlash=1\n\nSource/Citation References (1)\n\nIndividual: Katharine Banks (Royall Isham) (Bermuda Hundred Plantation) (By her second marriage, she is a direct ancestor of Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and Robert E.

During the siege, General Grant built his headquarters there. City Point also contains Appomattox Manor, the plantation home of Dr. Richard Eppes from 1851 to 1896. The house was located in the center of Dr. Eppes' plantations and served as the administrative center for plantation operations.\n\nThe following article was provided by Gail Brown.\n\nAs part of the overview and assessment of the City Point Unit, researchers have focused on the social relationships and the structured plantation landscape of the Eppes plantation. By focusing their attention on these aspects of the City Point Unit, University of Maryland researches revealed how Appomattox Manor and its grounds fit into the surrounding landscape before and after the Civil War. In order to study these relationships, researchers looked at the Eppes' journals in the collections of the Virginia Historical Society. Dr. Eppes kept daily journals;\n\n. . . taking note, besides my daily transactions, of every important event occurring on my estates. There will be from time introduced my opinions on different agricultural subjects. As I am engaged probably more extensively than any man in the State in improving my land, should I meet with success, it may be interesting to those who come after me, to see by what means I succeeded and in what way I erred profiting by my success & guarding against my errors (Eppes: 3 Sept. 1852).\n\nEppes not only recorded agricultural issues, but also his views on slavery, economic conditions, industry, and the approaching war. After the war and a break in his journals, Eppes continued to write about life in post-bellum Virginia. His concerns focused on his plantations and economic situation. He recorded how southern society changed after the war, and he addressed issues related to free African-Americans, depressed economic situations, agriculture, and northern military authority.\n\nBy reading these journals researchers can explore how Dr. Eppes structured his plantations in order to maintain authority over his natural resources and his slaves. Researchers examined his relationships with his slaves and the living conditions they faced. More importantly we were able to explore these same issues after the war. What makes these journals very interesting is that they provided Eppes' opinion about the effects the Civil War had on southern society, especially his plantation.\n\nThese journals provide a larger context for City Point. Not only can we see City Point as the Union military headquarters during the last year of the war, but we can now view the Civil War, and the Siege of Petersburg, as part of the larger frame of American history and see just how the Civil War came about, and how it affected a portion of American society. View of the Appomattox and James rivers from the rear of Appomattox Manor. The land on the right hand side is the Eppes Island plantation, and the land on the left is the Bermuda Hundreds plantation. From his position on this bluff, Dr. Eppes was able to keep his plantations, the rivers, and the river traffic in constant observance. This helped him in controlling his enslaved workers and the natural resources available on his plantations\n\nAs part of the cultural resource overview of the Petersburg National Battlefield City Point Unit, research was conducted on the structured landscape of the Eppes' plantations on whose land the City Point Unit now rests. The City Point Unit is most commonly known as the location of General Ulysses S. Grant's headquarters and the main Union Army supply depot during the Siege of Petersburg. City Point is also the location of Appomattox Manor (Figure 1), the plantation home of Dr. Richard Eppes. The lands that currently make up the City Point Unit served as ornamental gardens, service areas, and slave quarter locations for Dr. Eppes' home and plantation. Surrounding City Point were 2231 3/8 acres of land that made up the four plantations of Dr. Eppes' holdings: Bermuda Hundred, Eppes Island, Hopewell, and Appomattox.\n\nThough the City Point Unit is made up of only a small portion of the original plantation, it served as the command and control center for plantation operations. From his home Dr. Eppes began to structure and develop his plantations in a way which fit his ideal perceptions. As John Vlach observed, \"To mark their dominance over both nature and other men, planters acquired acreage, set out the boundaries of their holdings, had their fields cleared, selected building sites, and supervised the construction of dwellings and other structures. The design of a plantation estate was an expression of the owner's tastes, values, and attitudes\" (Vlach 1993: 1). Dr. Eppes was no exception.\n\nDaily journals kept by Dr. Eppes, located in the collections of the Virginia Historical Society, allow us the opportunity to explore his ideal structure and his recorded reality of the landscape. Throughout the journals, Eppes noted his land purchases, his reasons for purchasing the land, and his plans for utilizing the land. His notes on the landscape coupled with his notes on African-American slaves and freedmen on his plantations gave researchers the opportunity to examine how the structured landscape functioned with those living and working on it.\n\nDr. Eppes took over the daily management of his plantations in 1851. At that time he owned only two plantations (Eppes Island and Bermuda) and portions of a third at City Point. In 1854 he began to explore options for expanding his land holdings to the south of City Point, and in his journals Eppes stated his reason for purchasing new land,\n\nMy object in buying is to have surface for my surplus hands as I shall be overstocked in 8 or 10 years unless I extend which I must either do or sell, being loathe to do the latter I am compelled to do the former. This one of the evils attendant on slavery & there is no choice left ergo large farms a natural consequence where slavery exist (Eppes: Jan. 15, 1853).\n\nEppes thus directly tied his land purchasing patterns directly to the institution of slavery.\n\nIn his journals Dr. Eppes described his attempts at constructing his dominance over his landscape, those who worked for him, and the resources which allowed him to remain in the upper social class. Eppes constantly maintained his property boundaries with his neighbors, and made sure no violations of these boundaries occurred (Eppes: Dec. 27, 1852; Jan. 22, 1853; Jan. 22, 1859; July 11, 1859). After purchasing new property Eppes would have the new land surveyed and have its boundaries well marked (Eppes: Jan. 22-23, 1858; Feb. 11, 1859). Eppes would make sure that boundary markers in the forms of natural or man made features were left, and that his slaves, overseers, and neighbors were aware of their location (Eppes: Feb. 25, 1859). Eppes became upset if these markers were disturbed in any manner, even to the point of punishing slaves if they cut down a tree which served as a boundary marker (Eppes: Feb. 28, 1859). Throughout the journals, Eppes would make daily rounds through his various plantations to provide added security to his property, as well as, to check on work progress and to make sure everything was in order including his property boundaries. With his home situated in the center of his plantations, it was easy for Eppes to reach every corner of his plantation.\n\nShould I get it (proposed land purchase), my estates will then form a square N, E, W & S from my residence in short distances of each other (Eppes: Jan. 15, 1853).\n\nEppes' plantation management followed the rule of order. Included in his journals was a copy of the Southern Planter. In this publication it states,\n\nNo business of any kind can be successfully conducted without the aid of system and rule, and these are the more essentially necessary . . . A place for everything, and everything kept in its place. A rule for everything, and everything done according to the rule (Anon. 1852: 4).\n\nIt appears Eppes attempted to follow the journal's advice, as he managed his plantations by system and order (Eppes: Jan. 2, 1853). The journals show many instances of Dr. Eppes discovering things out of order during his daily rounds. Finding that his slaves, \"Were in the habit of scattering their hoes about the plantation,\" Eppes decided an inventory of equipment was needed on one plantation (Eppes: March 11, 1852). Incidents of trespassing were also noted by Eppes, when he came across hunters, fishermen or other trespassers on his property (Eppes: April 18, 1852; May 8, 1856).\n\nBy maintaining rigid order on his plantations and keeping a close watch on his property boundaries, Eppes was able to maintain a sense of authority over his land and workers. His system coupled with those plantation systems of his neighbors allowed the planters a means of keeping control over their property. They knew who was crossing plantation boundaries, and observed the movement and actions of those people on their plantations (Eppes: Nov. 12, 1851; April 18, 1852; Sept. 4, 1859; Jan. 20, 1860). This system of control, however, did not survive the Civil War.\n\nDr. Eppes returned to City Point in the summer of 1865 to find his landscape greatly affected by the military operations during the siege of Petersburg. He, however, quickly began to organize his plantations and start farming operations. Eppes attempted to reestablish his former way of managing his plantation based upon his landscape's structure in conjunction with his neighbors. With changed social and troubled economic situations, Eppes' old form of structure and plantation management did not succeed.\n\nEppes had to develop new forms of social control over his workers. No longer could he rely upon enslaved workers tied to the plantation. Freedmen were allowed to leave the plantation on their own free will, and could choose to live and work where they wanted. Eppes also had to find new ways of protecting his other plantation resources. With many of his former neighbors not returning or not attempting to resume their plantation operations, Eppes could not rely upon them to look for individuals crossing property boundaries. This lost network combined with poor economic conditions lead to a significant increase in the amount of theft from Dr. Eppes' plantations. Thefts including livestock, crops, and even a building were recorded by Eppes (Eppes: Nov. 5, 30, 1867; April 10, 1868; Jan. 25, 28, 1869; July 28, 1869; Nov. 27, 28, 1869). In order for him to diminish his losses and continue to make a profit, Eppes appeared to reduce the amount of land he directly observed. Eppes concentrated his efforts on his Island plantation, even living on that plantation at various times, while only visiting his family at City Point (Eppes: Dec. 20, 1869). Eppes proceeded to rent the remainder of his property to other farmers or tenets (Eppes: Oct. 7, 1869; Dec. 4, 1869; Aug. 8, 1870).\n\nDr. Eppes' home located at City Point remained the center of the Eppes family. However, its function within the plantation structure changed with new social and economic situations brought about by the Civil War. From acting as the administrative center for plantation operations before the war, to simply serving as the planter's home, the Civil War compelled Dr. Eppes to view the landscape around him differently and changed the function of his home at City Point.\n\nThe Eppes' journals give us an opening to explore the effects the Civil War had on the civilian population in and around City Point, Virginia. It gives us a glimpse at how the planter population, especially Dr. Eppes, reacted to the changing social conditions, and how they attempted to order the environment around them to fit their needs. By conducting this study it grants us the chance to place the City Point Unit into the larger historic context in which it belongs. City Point allows us an opportunity to view and explore the organization and actions of the Union Army during the last year of the Civil War, but it also does more. In addition City Point tells the story of the events leading up to the war and those that followed which affected the civilian population. Not only do Dr. Eppes' journals provide us with a view of his life and those of other planters, but also an insight of African-Americans, and middle class Euro-Americans. With his journals we can see the events surrounding the Civil War, and place the military actions at City Point and Petersburg in a larger historical context.\n\nBibliography:\n\n____________\n\n1852 Plantation and Farm, Instruction, Regulation, Record, Inventory\n\nand Account Book.

[Eutherius had long time been âDuke of Britainâ under his brother Ambrosius, Governor, King of Britain, and rival Roman Emperor 472 (Oct) to 473 (Mar), who died childless, and was succeeded by his brother. St. Gildas says that Ambrosius was the son of a Roman Emperor, and that he descended from the Roman âcaesarsâ.]\n\nSister of King Arthur of legend\n\nQueen Ygerna alias Igraine\n\n(Born c.AD 452)\n\n(Welsh: Eigr; Latin: Ygerna; English: Igraine)\n\nAccording to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Ygerna or Igraine (Eigr in Welsh) was the Duchess of Cornwall, ravishing wife of Gorlois and mother of King Arthur. After the death of Gorlois, she married Uther Pendragon, who, under false pretenses and aided by Merlin's trickery, had slept with her, impregnated her with Arthur and had been responsible for her husband's death. Chretien de Troyes claims that after Uther's death, Ygerna retired to a palace she had had built for herself known as the Chastel des Merveilles or \"Castle of Wonders\".\n\nShe was the daughter of Amlawdd Wledig (the Imperator), a member of a younger branch of the Royal House of Dumnonia. He was probably a nobleman of Ergyng, though he has also been attached to the North of Britain and Brittany. His family are central to the Mabinogion story of \"Culhwch and Olwen\". As well as Arthur, various sources have attributed Ygerna with several children by her first marriage: daughters Elaine, (Anna) Morgause and, perhaps mistakenly, Morgan; sons Gormant and, mistakenly, Cador.\n\n”\n\nThe cited information was published in http://awtc.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=harpist327&id=I06711\n\nSource/Citation References (1)\n\nIndividual: Ygerna Verch Amlawdd\n\nDescendants of Abimelech Sutton\n\n“Children of Mary Sutton and Elias Coleman are:\n\n50 i.
