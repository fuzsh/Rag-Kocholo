I was going through some old quarterlies \"Southern Roots & Shoots\" by the Delta Genealogical Society and found the following taken from \"The Walker County Georgia Messenger\" beginning Sept. 16, 1880.\n\nIssue December 15, 1887 Gordon Springs, Georgia\n\nThe saw mill at the ford of the creek below Rev. J.J.S. Calloway's is at w ork and I suppose doing a good business. Last Wednesday evening Mr. Frank Nuckolls, one of the hands, came very near getting killed. He was bearing off lumber when he finished sawing a log and had the trucks ready to m ove off. Mr. Nuckolls was pushing them when his foot slipped against t he saw and it running, the saw caught his boot and threw him against the o pening wheel, breaking his leg and sawing his foot pretty badly. I learned today that he is doing very well.\n\nIssue July 12, 1888 Gordon Springs, Georgia\n\nWe had a right good singing at Friendship yesterday, Sunday, conduct ed by L.W. Nuckolls. Mr Nuckolls said that the Friendship and Salem crowd had been behind in singing and he thought that we ought to redeem ourse lves, especially for order and attention.\n\n(Sent by Reita Childers NWK Member) 1/2004\n\n[HI2047] (Research):Reita Childers research\n\n3/8/2000\n\nMy Grandmother left a family record stating that her father was the son of Icy Nuckolls. No father is listed in the book. My granny was Four when Icy died. In all Cenus Records 1910- 1930 John and William are listed with the last name Nuckolls which they also used as their last name. In no documents can I find them using the last name Morris. Thier Brother Hugh's Last name was originally Norris (1900 Cenus living with Grandparents). Could it be that the marriage listing you have for a I. Nuckolls and William Norris May 26, 1890 in Walker County GA is Icy's Husband and the father of Hugh.\n\nA Nuckolls family came into the Historical Society today trying to find Iscy (he spelled it) Nuckolls. His grandfather was Hugh Nuckolls. My first thought since they were from Whit field Co. that it had to be a child of John Milton Nuckolls and one of his three wives children. got out my old family group records and found Sus an (Isaydee?) Nuckolls who married a William Morris and they had a son, Hugh Morris. In our book on page 298 very top of the page is Susan Icadonia Nuckolls d/o John M. Nuckolls and first wife, Nancy Bates.\n\nThe researcher said Isaydee has three boys Hugh, Willie (short for William) and Johnnie I suppost for John. He knew nothing about the Morris marriage, interesting! She could have married twice.\n\nAnyway just thought you would like to keep this on file somewhere. More research would have to be done to prove all this but I believe Susan Icadonia will be the Islaydee or Isy Nuckolls.\n\n[NI2048] pigeonforge2002@yahoo.com\n\nhi my name is shirley mcwhorter and lee nuckolls was my grandmother and I 'm trying to learn more about her,she married andrew mckeehan,her father a nd mother was John and Betty Nuckolls.can you help me with this? thank y ou for any help.Shirley mcwhorter\n\nName: Lee Mckeehan Death Date: 02 Dec 1951\n\nCounty of Death: Whitfield\n\nGender: F\n\nRace: W\n\nAge: 78 years\n\nCounty of Residence: Whitfld\n\nCertificate: 29725\n\n[NI2049] 1910 household has nephew Sam Houston age 18\n\n[NI2051] 1920 Census, wife name is Roseanna age 37\n\n1930 Census wife name is Nellie age 47\n\n1930 Census has George W Roland, stepson age 15 and Evelyn Rowland step dau age 12\n\n[DI2051] Name: John W Nuckolls\n\nDeath Date: 06 Jan 1936\n\nCounty of Death: Whitfield\n\nCertificate: 2554\n\n[NI2052] World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918\n\nBorn 5-6-1880 Res Rocky Face, Ga\n\nSelf Emp farmer\n\nWife Maggie, same address\n\nMed height, med build, Blue eyes, ___hair\n\nSinged James Alex Nuckolls, Whitfield Co, GA\n\n[NI2055] Never married.

The weather being ve ry hot made it impossible for the family to return his remains to Forsy th County. consequently, Alexander was buried across the road form his ho me place located on the Old Ringgold Rd. At night when mother nature sen ds her sweet cool winds racing down the valley floor and embraces the beau tiful iron works that surround Alexander's grave, strange whispering soun ds can be heard. Neighbors say, \"it's only Mr. Alexander who has co me to visit.\"\n\nPinckney and Mary Louisa (Nuckolls) Thornton had eight children, who are a ll listed within these pages.\n\nIt is not know when Pinckney and his family moved to Arkansas but in 187 0, they were living in the Mountain township in Montgomery Co. Arkansa s. Again, many of the family members left Georgia moving to Arkansas sett ling close to one another.\n\nIn Montgomery County, AR on January 4, 1893, Pinckney and Louisa convey ed property by Warranty Deed with Relinquishment of Dowers to George W.

Confedera te Regiment Infantry Army of Tennessee. Most Confederate soldiers were ne ither long term regulars nor draftees, but war time volunteers whose valu es remained rooted in their homes and communities from which they spra ng to defend and to which they desperately wanted to return.\n\nAfter several years of fighting, Thomas was captured by Union troops on Ju ly 3, 1864 near Kennesaw, GA. He was taken to the Provost Marshall Gener al July 12th in Nashville, Tennessee. By July 15th, he was received at Mi litary Prison, Louisville, KY ending up at Camp Douglas, IL. Thomas' brot her-in-law, William Calvin Ward, of Tunnel Hill did not survive this wretc hed prison camp, full of pestilence and hardship. Thomas was released fr om Camp Douglas May 19, 1865 after taking the Oath of Allegiance at whi ch time he was set free to return home to his family.\n\nWhile Thomas was away with the army, Milbrey was living in Tunnel Hill, G A. Winters had been brutal in North Georgia especially in 1863 and tim es were hard as a result of the fighting in and around Tunnel Hill. As t he Yankees swept through Tunnel Hill and Ringgold, Milbrey tried to save h er most valuable possessions. After all, her husband was away fighting a nd giving his all for the cause, she had to take matters into her won hand s. She loaded a wagon with her treasures took them deep into the hills bu rying them so the Yankees could not find them. Milbrey was report ed to be skilled in the art of horseback riding, one of her most treasur ed possession being a velvet side-saddle. She wrapped her saddle in quil ts along with other treasures and buried them deep in the red Georgia cl ay to keep all from harms way. Sadly, upon recovery the dirt and moistu re had taken its toll, all was destroyed.\n\nThomas Pascal Thronton, Sr., the third child of Thomas Pinckney and Mary L ouisa (Nuckolls) Thornton, after returning home, from the War of Rebellio n, went to work for the railroad as many did in those days. He was the ge neral car foreman for the old Western & Atlantic Railroad in Nashville, Te nnessee. After living in Tennessee for several years, Thomas and family r eturned to Tunnel Hill GA about 1875 and he continued working for the rail road. His son, Thomas Pascal Thornton, Jr., at the age of 16 entered t he service of the railroad as a car oiler under his father's supervisi on at Boyce Station, TN on the old Western & Atlantic Railroad, later t he Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis. Thomas Jr. worked on to become o ne of the most famous \"Wreck Masters\" in the south. He told of seeing b ad wrecks, human beings dead or suffering, giant locomotives twisted and m angled and somehow he was always able to bring order out of destructio n, to fulfill the railroad man's creed and clarion call \"Clear the main li ne!\"\n\nAfter Thomas Pascal Thornton Sr. first wife, Milbrey passed away, Thoma s, Sr. married his first cousin, Annie Graham.

He was born in Elbert Ga May 6 1829. His boyho od was spent in Columbus having prepared for college in one of her excelle nt private schools, and graduated at Athens in the A B Course and th en in the law course at Harvard. This training, coupled with a naturally s trong intellect placed him in the front rank of athe accomplished young m en of his day. He naturally took a prominent part in municipal affairs, a nd brought an untiring energy to bear for the promotion of the city's adva ncement. He was among the first volunteers at the call to arms in 186 0. He was long a councilman of the First Ward. His last effort at public s ervice was in the management of the Columbus Rome railroad. About this ti me his nervous system gave way and by degrees a paralysis has for six yea rs separated him from the public, and even his dearest friends could not h ave satisfactory intercourse with him. Few except the oldest citizens kn ew him, so long had he been separated, by his afflictions, from active bus iness. A good man has passed away, a warm-hearted friend and a cultivat ed gentleman. We sympathize very sincerely with those nearest and deare st to him, and especially with his bereaved companion, a noble examp le of a womn's untiring and tender devotion.\n\nColumbus Enquirer-Sun June 29, 1889\n\nThe funeral of Mr Thomas J Nuckolls took place from his late residen ce on upper Third Avenue at 4 o'clcok yesterday afternoon, and was very la rgely attended by prominent citizens.
