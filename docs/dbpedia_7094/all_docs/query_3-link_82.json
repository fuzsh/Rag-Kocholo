        "text": "FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA\n\nNICHOLAS, YATES AND BEACH JJ\n\nTHE COURT:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1 The appellant, Anchorage Capital Partners Pty Ltd, was incorporated in Australia in August 2007. In March 2008, it obtained a financial services licence allowing it to carry on a funds management business raising money to make what are sometimes referred to as “turnaround investments” in struggling businesses which it buys, fixes up, and then sells for profit.\n\n2 The first respondent, ACPA Pty Ltd, was incorporated in Australia in June 2011 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the second respondent. The second respondent was incorporated in June 2003 in the United States of America and is based in New York. It was originally known as Anchorage Advisors L.L.C. but changed its name on 12 October 2010 to Anchorage Capital Group L.L.C. Both respondents provide financial services, however, the activities of the first respondent appear to be ancillary to the funds management operations of the second respondent. The second respondent and its affiliates use a number of names in connection with their business operations including the name ANCHORAGE and the names ANCHORAGE CAPITAL and ANCHORAGE CAPITAL GROUP (collectively “the US ANCHORAGE names”). Another name that the second respondent also alleged it and its affiliates used is the name ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS although, as we later explain, there was no finding made by the primary judge in relation to such use.\n\n3 In May 2011 the appellant applied for, and subsequently obtained, registration of three trade marks consisting of the word marks ANCHORAGE, ANCHORAGE CAPITAL and ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS (collectively “the registered marks”) with the following registration numbers:\n\nTrade Mark\n\nNumber\n\nANCHORAGE\n\n1425924\n\nANCHORAGE CAPITAL\n\n1425929\n\nANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS\n\n1425921\n\n4 Each of the registered marks was registered under the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Act”) with effect from 26 May 2011 (“the date of registration”) in respect of services (“the registered services”) in class 36 described as follows:\n\nAcquisition for financial investment; administration of financial affairs; advisory services relating to financial investment; conducting of financial transactions; financial advisory services for companies; asset management; financial fund management; financial investment management services; financial transaction services; all the aforementioned services targeted towards special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance.\n\n5 It can be seen that each of the registered marks is registered in respect of various financial services “targeted toward special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance.” In its submissions the appellant referred to this as the “turnaround proviso”. That term is not a totally apt description of the relevant language, which is not a true proviso, and which does not include any reference to “turnaround”. Nevertheless, for convenience we have also used it in these reasons to refer to the qualification contained in the last three lines of the description of the registered services.\n\n6 In June 2011 the first respondent commenced business from premises located in the Suncorp Tower at 259 George Street, Sydney. It described itself on signage erected at Suncorp Tower as “ACPA a subsidiary of Anchorage Capital Group LLC”.\n\n7 In June 2013 the appellant moved its principle place of business from its premises at Bridge Street, Sydney to Suncorp Tower. In September 2013, after the appellant moved offices from Bridge Street to Suncorp Tower, the first respondent removed its signage at the appellant’s request.\n\n8 On 14 February 2014 the appellant filed its originating application seeking relief against the first and second respondents in respect of their alleged infringement of each of the registered marks, for passing off, and for misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s 18 of the Australian Consumer Law (“ACL”). On 22 April 2014 the respondents filed their cross-claim seeking an order for the cancellation of each of the registered marks. The defences raised by the appellant to the respondents’ cross-claim included an alleged estoppel which was said to preclude the respondents from seeking such an order.\n\n9 On 21 August 2015 the primary judge dismissed the appellant’s application: Anchorage Capital Partners Pty Limited v ACPA Pty Ltd (2015) 115 IPR 67 (“PJ-1”). References to paragraphs in the primary judge’s reasons are to those in PJ-1 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n10 A crucial finding made by the primary judge was that the appellant was not the owner of the ANCHORAGE or ANCHORAGE CAPITAL marks because the second respondent had used them in Australia in January 2007 before the appellant first used them.\n\n11 In a second judgment delivered on 17 December 2015 his Honour ordered that the ANCHORAGE and the ANCHORAGE CAPITAL marks be cancelled: Anchorage Capital Partners Pty Limited v ACPA Pty Limited (No 3) (2015) 331 ALR 512 (“PJ-2”). His Honour declined to order the cancellation of the ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS mark.\n\n12 On 9 March 2016 the primary judge delivered a third judgment in relation to the costs of the proceeding. The costs orders made by his Honour required the appellant to pay some of the respondents’ costs on an indemnity basis: Anchorage Capital Partners Pty Limited v ACPA Pty Limited (No 4) [2016] FCA 218 (“PJ-3”). His Honour ordered:\n\n1. The applicant is to pay the respondents’ costs on the cross-claim of defending the estoppel case on an indemnity basis.\n\n2. The applicant is to pay the respondents’ costs on both the application and the cross-claim on a party-party basis before 11am on 20 June 2014 other than the costs referred to in order 1.\n\n3. The applicant is to pay the respondents’ costs thereafter on an indemnity basis.\n\nGiven that the trial did not commence until 15 December 2014, the effect of the primary judge’s costs orders required the appellant to pay the respondents’ costs of the trial and preparation by the respondents in the months leading up to it, on an indemnity basis.\n\n13 In this appeal, the appellant contends that the primary judge should not have cancelled any of the registered marks and that his Honour should have found that each of them was infringed by the respondents. The appellant also contends that his Honour should not have required the appellant to pay any part of the respondents’ costs after 11am on 20 June 2014 on an indemnity basis.\n\n14 The respondents have filed a notice of contention upon which they rely together with a cross-appeal challenging the primary judge’s decision not to order the cancellation of the ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS mark and also postulating a slightly different costs order to that made by his Honour.\n\n15 The appellant does not challenge the primary judge’s rejection of the appellant’s estoppel defence or the primary judge’s rejection of the appellant’s case of passing off and for contravention of s 18 of the ACL. The appeal is therefore only concerned with the primary judge’s conclusions with respect to validity and infringement of the registered marks, whether those marks should have been cancelled, and costs.\n\n16 For completeness we should mention that his Honour was not satisfied that the second respondent had a sufficient reputation in its name in Australia as at the date of registration to establish that the use of any of the registered marks would be likely to deceive or cause confusion or that their use would be contrary to law (see ss 42(b), 60 and 88(2)(a) and (c) of the Act). His Honour’s findings with respect to these grounds for cancellation are not challenged by the respondents.\n\nTHE PRIMARY JUDGE’S REASONS\n\n17 The primary judge commenced his judgment with a paragraph which the appellant submitted contains some key findings with respect to the nature and scope the second respondent’s business. His Honour said at [1]:\n\n[1] … The applicant is called Anchorage Capital Partners Pty Ltd and is an Australian corporation. The second respondent is a Delaware limited liability corporation called Anchorage Capital Group LLC. Both of these firms have similar business models in that both raise money from professional investors which they then invest to make a profit. There are differences between them as to the kinds of investments they make and the manner in which they raise their funds. The applicant is involved in what its executives called the turnaround business which involves acquiring a controlling interest in a struggling business, fixing it up and then on-selling it at a profit. The second respondent by contrast, does not generally make that kind of investment. Rather, it acquires, broadly speaking, distressed debt or equity positions at a discount to their true value and then disposes of them at a profit when the true value is later realised. The applicant was at pains to distinguish the nature of these two kinds of business. I accept they are different.\n\n18 It is apparent that his Honour accepted that there were differences between the businesses carried on by the appellant and the second respondent. But it is important to recognise that his Honour was not at this early point in his reasons dealing with the scope of the registered services or making any finding as to whether the second respondent had ever offered to provide services in Australia that were the same services, or the same kind of services, as the registered services.\n\n19 The primary judge identified four issues related to ownership of the relevant marks. His Honour said at [32]-[33]:\n\n[32] It was not in dispute that the applicant would not be the owner of the ANCHORAGE marks if prior to the earlier of its first use of the marks in Australia another person in the course of trade in Australia used a mark which was substantially identical with the registered marks in relation to the same kinds of services for which the applicant’s marks were registered: The Shell Company of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407 at 423-424 [1963] ALR 634; (1963) 1B IPR 523 at 532 per Kitto J; Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd [No 2] (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 432; 56 ALR 193 at 204; 3 IPR 545 at 556 per Deane J (with whom Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ agreed).\n\n[33] The debate between the parties was fourfold: (a) whether there was an additional requirement that it should be shown that the earlier user of the mark was entitled to its exclusive use; (b) whether it was shown that the second respondent had used substantially identical marks to the ANCHORAGE marks in the course of trade; (c) whether it was open to the respondents to rely on use of substantially identical marks by other members of the second respondent’s group; and, (d) if so, whether such use was established.\n\n20 None of the four issues identified by the primary judge at [33] refers to the question whether the relevant use occurred in relation to the same kind of services in respect of which the registered marks were registered. In particular, the primary judge’s discussion of the issues does not include any reference to the turnaround proviso. Mr Darke SC, who appeared for the appellant (but who did not appear at the trial) told us that this issue was raised by the appellant before the primary judge, and we were taken to some written submissions and transcript that confirms this. But as with a number of other points raised by the appellant in its appeal, it is clear that the turnaround proviso received much less emphasis before the primary judge than it was given during the appeal.\n\n21 The primary judge held that the appellant was not the owner of either of the cancelled marks because the US ANCHORAGE names were used in Australia by the second respondent in electronic copies of a slide presentation (“the slide presentation”) attached to emails sent to potential institutional investors in Australia in January 2007. His Honour said at [36]:\n\n[36] … [T]he evidence shows that on 25 and 30 January 2007 (before the applicant commenced business) the second respondent sent potential institutional investors a presentation made up of slides entitled ‘ANCHORAGE CAPITAL GROUP’ with the words ‘ACP, ACC, & ASC FUNDS OVERVIEW’ by which it sought to solicit investments in some of its funds. Although the applicant disputed this, I am satisfied that this was sent on behalf of the second respondent (which was confusingly not then called Anchorage Capital Group LLC). Although the presentation was said to be provided by an entity then bearing that name it was expressed to be sent on behalf of Anchorage Capital Group LLC and that entity’s affiliates which included the second respondent (which, as I have said, was then known by another name). I accept that this was trademark use in the course of trade. The second respondent was seeking to provide its fund management services to investors using the US ANCHORAGE names.\n\n22 We should point out that the copies of the slide presentation reproduced in the appeal papers (Part C, Tab 40.11 and 40.13) were incomplete. A complete copy of the slide presentation was first made available to us at the commencement of the hearing of the appeal by Mr Darke SC. When in these reasons we refer to the slide presentation, we are referring to the complete document made up of 42 pages.\n\n23 The primary judge found at [39] that the US ANCHORAGE names included marks that were identical to the cancelled marks, ANCHORAGE and ANCHORAGE CAPITAL. Those findings were not challenged by the appellant. However, his Honour did not accept that any of the US ANCHORAGE names was identical or substantially identical to the third of the registered marks, ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS.\n\n24 His Honour concluded that the second respondent used the US ANCHORAGE names in relation to funds management services on two occasions in January 2007 and this was sufficient to establish that the appellant was not the owner of the ANCHORAGE and ANCHORAGE CAPITAL marks. The appellant challenges the primary judge’s finding that this use constituted trade mark use. Further, the appellant contends that the primary judge erred in holding (at least implicitly) that any such use occurred in relation to the same services, or services of the same kind, as the registered services.\n\n25 The second respondent also claimed to have used its trade marks in Australia at other times prior to 2007. However, the primary judge was not satisfied that any of these other uses amounted to trade mark use. His Honour said at [42]:\n\n[42] … there were a number of instances prior to 2007 in which various fund entities within the second respondent’s group used the US ANCHORAGE names in transactions in Australia. Often these were not related to negotiations to acquire interests (which were generally conducted by the second respondent) but were more closely tied to the settlement elements of the transactions. For the reasons I have already given, however, I do not think that any of these arrangements involved the use by these entities of the names as trademarks in the course of their trade. They were not attempting to distinguish their services from those of others using the names because they were not providing services by passively investing in Australian businesses. On the other hand, I do accept that the two presentations referred to above in relation to (b) also establish trademark use of the names by each of the entities on whose behalf they were sent (that is, all of the affiliates within the group) and not just the second respondent.\n\nHis Honour concluded that the second respondent and its affiliates used the second respondent’s marks as trade marks in Australia in relation to the provision of fund management services on 25 and 30 January 2007. It was on this basis that his Honour found that the appellant was not the owner of the ANCHORAGE or ANCHORAGE CAPITAL marks. His Honour said at [43]:\n\n[43] In those circumstances, I conclude that the second respondent and its affiliates used the US ANCHORAGE names in relation to the provision by them of funds management services on two occasions in January 2007 before the priority date and that this use was sufficient to mean that the applicant was not the owner of the ANCHORAGE and ANCHORAGE CAPITAL marks. The power to remove the marks from the register is enlivened under s 88(1)(a) of the Act. A corollary of this conclusion is that the second respondent was entitled to seek registration of the ANCHORAGE and ANCHORAGE CAPITAL names as trademarks. It was for that reason that I would have upheld the second respondent’s defence based on ss 122(1)(f) and 122(1)(fa) …\n\n26 Given the issues that arise in the appeal, it is important to note that the primary judge was satisfied that the second respondent used the US ANCHORAGE names in Australia in January 2007 “in relation to the provision by them of funds management services.” However, his Honour was not satisfied that there was any such use of any of the US ANCHORAGE names in Australia after the date of registration. It was on that basis that his Honour concluded that (apart from any other defences that might be available under s 122(1) of the Act) neither respondent infringed the registered marks within the meaning of s 120(1) of the Act. The appellant challenges the primary judge’s finding to this effect. It also contends that the primary judge failed to consider an infringement case founded on s 120(2) of the Act.\n\n27 In support of its argument before the primary judge that it should not be inferred that the second respondent intended to provide financial services in Australia in early 2007 and that any use of the US ANCHORAGE names in January 2007 did not constitute trade mark use, the appellant relied on s 911A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), relevant parts of which are set out later in these reasons. The appellant’s case before his Honour was, in effect, that the second respondent could not lawfully provide such services in circumstances where it did not hold an Australian financial services licence without contravening s 911A. His Honour rejected this argument for the reasons given at [47]:\n\n[47] … First, I do not accept that the fact that a business was acting illegally in some ways provides a defence to a claim relating to its trade marks. The use of the US ANCHORAGE names was not a breach of the Corporations Act. Secondly, the second respondent’s investment activities in Australia did not involve the conduct of a business here so that they cannot constitute the conduct of a financial services business even if they were providing a financial service.\n\n28 We will refer to the appellant’s argument based on s 911A in greater detail later in these reasons, but we should point out that this argument appears to have been given much greater attention by the appellant in the appeal than it was given before the primary judge. This may account for the brevity with which it was rejected by his Honour.\n\n29 The primary judge held that the power to cancel the ANCHORAGE and the ANCHORAGE CAPITAL marks was enlivened because the appellant was not the owner of those marks (see ss 58 and 88(2)(a) of the Act), and the appellant’s applications for registration of them could have been opposed on that ground.\n\n30 After publishing PJ-1, the primary judge heard further submissions in relation to the matter of the discretion to cancel, or not to cancel, the ANCHORAGE and ANCHORAGE CAPITAL marks. As we later explain, his Honour held that there was such a discretion but nevertheless decided that those marks should be cancelled.\n\n31 His Honour referred in PJ-2 to the High Court’s decision in Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd (2010) 240 CLR 590 at [22] in which reference was made to the “integrity” and “purity” of the Register and the concern of the trade marks legislation “… to ensure that the Register is maintained as an accurate record of marks that perform their statutory function to indicate the trade origins of the goods to which it is intended that they be applied.” His Honour said at PJ-2 [14]-[17]:\n\n[14] In its survey of the operation of the Act in Health World Ltd v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Ltd (2010) 240 CLR 590 the High Court observed (at 597 [22]):\n\n‘Secondly, the legislative scheme reveals a concern with the condition of the Register of Trade Marks. It is a concern that it have “integrity” and that it be “pure”. It is a “public mischief” if the Register is not pure, for there is “public interest in [its] purity”. The concern and the public interest, viewed from the angle of consumers, is to ensure that the Register is maintained as an accurate record of marks which perform their statutory function – to indicate the trade origins of the goods to which it is intended that they be applied.’\n\n(Footnotes omitted)\n\n[15] On its face, the fact that the register currently records that the applicant is the owner of the marks when this is not correct would appear to detract from the accuracy of the register and hence, presumably, its ‘purity’ and ‘integrity’. The applicant’s answer to this was that the existence of the discretion under s 88(1) not to cancel a mark’s registration meant that the Act did not in every case require an inaccurate entry to be removed.\n\n[16] No doubt this is correct, but it is no answer to the general observation that, absent good reason to the contrary, a public register should be accurate. It is therefore necessary to identify some reason why it would be a good idea for the register to remain inaccurate.\n\n[17] The applicant put forward ten matters as being relevant to the exercise of the discretion.\n\nThe primary judge then had regard to the 10 different considerations said by the appellant to be relevant to the exercise of the discretion not to order cancellation of the appellant’s trade mark registrations. We should say that we do not understand the appellant to suggest that his Honour did not address each of the 10 considerations that the appellant then relied upon.\n\n32 It is apparent from his Honour’s reasons that his exercise of the discretion to order cancellation of the appellant’s registered marks was principally based on a consideration of the public interest in ensuring that the Register is accurate.\n\n33 In support of his conclusion that none of the registered marks was infringed, the primary judge did not accept that either respondent used any of the US ANCHORAGE names in relation to the services in respect of which any of the registered marks was registered after the date of registration. His Honour said at [12]-[15]:\n\n[12] The applicant puts its case solely on s 120(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) (‘the Act’) (‘A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered’). In this case it is necessary that the applicant therefore establish that: (a) the signs used by the respondents were substantially identical or deceptively similar to the applicant’s trademarks; and (b) that the respondents used those signs ‘in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered’.\n\n[13] As to (a), I accept that the first respondent’s use of the US ANCHORAGE names was substantially identical or deceptively similar to all three registered [sic] of the ANCHORAGE marks. In particular: ANCHORAGE is identical to ANCHORAGE; Anchorage Capital Group LLC is deceptively similar both to ANCHORAGE CAPITAL and ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS. As to the ANCHORAGE email addresses, @anchoragecap.com is deceptively similar to ANCHORAGE CAPITAL but @acpa.anchoragecap.com is not. I do not accept that the first respondent’s use of ‘ACPA Pty Ltd a subsidiary of Anchorage Capital Group LLC’ was deceptively similar to any of the marks.\n\n[14] However, this is by the by. This is because, as to (b), I do not accept that either respondent has, since the priority date, used the US ANCHORAGE names ‘in relation to goods and services in respect of which the trade mark is registered’. Neither respondent is shown to have dealt with or provided any services in Australia after the priority date.\n\n[15] Consequently, no infringement under s 120(1) can be established against either respondent. They were not using the US ANCHORAGE names as trademarks to distinguish their services because they were not dealing with or providing services when they used the names. Their use was not trademark use – the US ANCHORAGE names were not being used as a badge of origin in the sense that they were not being used to indicate a connexion in the course of trade between the only service actually provided by the second respondent, that of funds management, and the second respondent: Coca-Cola Company v All-Fect Distributors Ltd (1999) 96 FCR 107 at 115 [19]. There is simply no evidence that either respondent provided any of their funds management services to anyone in Australia after the priority date. What they have done is trade in their own names. This is not trade mark use.\n\n34 The primary judge said that if he were to have concluded that the first respondent had used any of the registered marks or trade marks in relation to the services in respect of which they were registered, he would have accepted that the first respondent had a defence under s 122(1)(b)(i) of the Act on the basis that such use was use in good faith to indicate a characteristic of the first respondent’s services. The correctness of that conclusion is not challenged by the appellant.\n\n35 In relation to the second respondent, the primary judge concluded that it would have had a defence under s 122(1)(a)(i) of the Act on the ground that it had, in good faith, used its own name. His Honour was also satisfied that the second respondent would have had a defence under both s 122(1)(f) and s 122(1)(fa) on the ground that the second respondent is entitled to register the US ANCHORAGE names as trade marks. The appellant challenges the correctness of each of those conclusions.\n\n36 The primary judge said at [18] that he would have rejected the second respondent’s defences under s 124 of the Act on the basis that the second respondent had not continuously used the US Anchorage names. His rejection of this defence is consistent with his view that the second respondent used the US Anchorage names as trade marks in Australia in 2007 but that the evidence did not show that there had been any such use in later years. The respondents challenge the correctness of those findings.\n\nTHE GROUNDS OF APPEAL\n\n37 There are 18 grounds of appeal relating to the trade mark issues (including Ground 1 and Ground 5 both of which are expressed in general terms) which may be summarised as follows:\n\n(1) The primary judge erred in holding that the sending of the slide presentation on 25 and 30 January 2007 constituted use by the second respondent of the US ANCHORAGE names as trade marks in Australia in relation to services of the same kind as the registered services. (Ground 2)\n\n(2) The primary judge erred in holding that any trade mark use by the second respondent of the US ANCHORAGE names did not involve the conduct of a financial services business in Australia and that there was therefore no breach by the second respondent of s 911A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). (Ground 2A)\n\n(3) The primary judge erred in holding that it was open to the respondents to rely on use prior to the date of registration of the US ANCHORAGE names by any person other than the second respondent in seeking cancellation of the registered marks (Ground 3), that the second respondent and other members of its corporate group were the owners of the cancelled marks, and that the appellant was not the owner of the cancelled marks (Ground 4).\n\n(4) The primary judge erred in holding that the appellant bore the onus of demonstrating that the discretion to cancel should not be exercised, that the public interest favoured such cancellation and that, in the exercise of his discretion, he should order the cancellation of the cancelled marks. (Grounds 6-7)\n\n(5) The primary judge erred in holding that the respondents would be prejudiced by not cancelling the cancelled marks, that he also failed to have regard to other matters relevant to the exercise of the discretion, including his findings concerning the respondents’ own lack of reputation, and the lack of any likelihood that consumers would be confused or deceived by the appellant’s use of the cancelled marks. (Grounds 8-10)\n\n(6) The primary judge erred in failing to find that the respondents had infringed the registered marks under s 120(1) or s 120(2)(c) of the Act and in holding that the second respondent would also have been entitled to rely on the defences provided for in ss 122(1)(a), (f) and (fa) of the Act. (Grounds 11-17)\n\n(7) The primary judge erred in failing to find that any application by the second respondent for registration of any of the registered marks or the US ANCHORAGE names would be rejected pursuant to s 33(1) of the Act on the ground provided for in s 44(2), or refused pursuant to s 55(1) on the grounds provided by ss 44(2), 57 and 60. (Ground 18)\n\n38 There are also five further grounds of appeal (Grounds 19-23) relating to the appellant’s appeal against the primary judge’s indemnity costs order which we will address later in these reasons.\n\n39 Ground 3 of the notice of appeal was not pressed because, as the appellant accepted in a footnote to its written submissions in chief, if there was trade mark use in the slide presentation (which it denied) then this was trade mark use by the second respondent as well as the other members of its corporate group.\n\nTHE NOTICE OF CONTENTION\n\n40 The respondents seek to uphold the primary judge’s judgment on additional grounds which may be summarised as follows:\n\n(1) Given the primary judge’s findings on the issue of ownership, his Honour was required to cancel the cancelled marks because s 88(1)(a) of the Act does not confer any discretion not to do so when grounds for cancellation are made out. (Contention 1)\n\n(2) There was further use of the US ANCHORAGE names by the second respondent before the date of registration (“the additional prior use”) in addition to the prior use found by the primary judge based on the slide presentation. (Contention 2)\n\n(3) The primary judge’s finding that the second respondent did not infringe the registered marks be upheld on the ground that it made out its defence under s 124(1) of the Act on the basis of the additional prior use. (Contention 3a)\n\n(4) The primary judge’s alternative findings of non-infringement of the registered marks based on s 122(1)(f) and (fa) of the Act should be upheld on the ground of the additional prior use. (Contention 3b)\n\n(5) The primary judge’s finding that the first respondent did not infringe the registered marks be upheld on the additional ground that the first respondent’s defence pursuant to s 122(1)(a) of the Act was made out. (Contention 3c)\n\n(6) The respondents also seek to support the indemnity costs order made by the primary judge on the basis of a Calderbank offer to the appellant dated 18 June 2014. (Contention 4)\n\nDuring the hearing of the appeal the appellant made clear that it did not challenge the primary judge’s finding that the first respondent’s defence based on s 122(1)(a) of the Act was made out. It is therefore unnecessary for us to say anything further concerning Contention 3c.\n\nThe Grounds of Cross-Appeal\n\n41 As already mentioned, the respondents contend by way of cross-appeal that the primary judge erred by not ordering the cancellation of the third of the registered trade marks, ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS. They contend that his Honour should have found that the second respondent had also used the name ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS as a trade mark in the slide presentation (Ground 1) and that he should therefore have found that the second respondent was also the owner of that mark. They also contended by way of cross-appeal that his Honour erred by failing to hold that each of the US ANCHORAGE names was (contrary to his Honour’s finding at [39]) substantially identical to the ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS mark (Ground 2).\n\n42 The respondents also raised in their notice of cross-appeal some of the same matters raised in their notice of contention in relation to the cancelled marks in support of their further contention that the ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS mark should have been cancelled. In particular, they placed reliance on the additional prior use (Ground 3) to which we have briefly referred and also contended that if there is a discretion not to cancel the ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS mark, then it should be cancelled for essentially the reasons that the primary judge decided to order the cancellation of the cancelled marks (Ground 4).\n\n43 The final ground raised in the cross-appeal relates to the primary judge’s indemnity costs order (Ground 5).\n\nVALIDITY ISSUES\n\nOwnership\n\nBackground\n\n44 We will first consider the appellant’s challenge to his Honour’s order cancelling the ANCHORAGE mark and the ANCHORAGE CAPITAL mark. This aspect of the appeal concerns the law with respect to the statutory concept of trade mark ownership or (as it was called in the context of previous trade mark legislation) the statutory concept of trade mark “proprietorship”.\n\n45 Section 27(1) of the Act provides that a person may apply for the registration of a trade mark in respect of goods and/or services if the person claims to be the owner of the trade mark in various circumstances including, relevantly, if the person is using or intends to use the trade mark in relation to the goods or services. Section 58 provides that the registration of a trade mark may be opposed on the ground that the applicant is not the owner of the trade mark.\n\n46 Section 88(2) relevantly provides that the Court may order the cancellation of a registered trade mark on any of the grounds on which the registration of the trade mark could have been opposed under this Act. This was the source of the power exercised by the primary judge when ordering cancellation of the cancelled marks.\n\n47 The concept of ownership in the relevant statutory context was explained by Dixon J (as he then was) in Shell Co of Australia v Rohm & Haas Co (1949) 78 CLR 601 at 627:\n\nThe basis of a claim to proprietorship in a trade mark so far unused has been found in the combined effect of authorship of the mark, the intention to use it upon or in connection with the goods and the applying for registration.\n\n48 Authorship in this context does not require that the applicant for registration be the first to conceive of the mark. Rather, it refers to the applicant’s adoption of the mark with the intention of using it in Australia in relation to the goods or services with respect to which the applicant seeks to register the mark.\n\n49 Hence, ownership may be acquired by the act of applying for registration of a trade mark even though the applicant has not previously used the mark and the mark has already been used outside Australia by someone else. However, the applicant’s claim to ownership of the mark may be defeated if another person has previously used the mark, or a substantially identical mark, in Australia as a trade mark in relation to the same goods or services, or goods or services of the same kind, as those that are the subject of the application for registration.\n\nPrior Use\n\n50 It has been held that slight use of a mark in relation to the relevant goods or services may be sufficient to establish ownership for the purposes of s 58: Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 432; Malibu Boats West Inc v Catanese (2000) 180 ALR 119 at [28], Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd (2016) 121 IPR 150 at [112]-[119].\n\n51 In Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) (1984) 156 CLR 414 Deane J (with whom Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ agreed) said at 432-434:\n\nThe prior use of a trade mark which may suffice, at least if combined with local authorship, to establish that a person has acquired in Australia the statutory status of \"proprietor\" of the mark, is public use in Australia of the mark as a trade mark, that is to say, a use of the mark in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connexion in the course of trade between the goods with respect to which the mark is used and that person: see, generally, Shell Co. of Australia Ltd. v. Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd. [(1963) 109 CLR 407 at pp 423-424]; Re Registered Trade Mark “Yanx”; Ex parte Amalgamated Tobacco Corporation Ltd. [(1951) 82 CLR 199 at pp 204-205]; and the definition of \"trade mark\" in s. 6(1) of the Trade Marks Act. The requisite use of the mark need not be sufficient to establish a local reputation and there is authority to support the proposition that evidence of but slight use in Australia will suffice to protect a person who is the owner and user overseas of a mark which another is seeking to appropriate by registration under the Trade Marks Act. In such a case, the court “seizes upon a very small amount of use of the foreign mark in Australia to hold that it has become identified with and distinctive of the goods of the foreign trader in Australia”: see Seven Up Co. v. 0. T. Ltd. [(1947) 75 CLR 203 at p 211]; Aston v. Harlee Manufacturing Co. [(1960) 103 CLR 391 at p 400].\n\n…\n\nThe Court was referred to a large number of cases and to some administrative decisions in which consideration has been given to what constitutes a use or user of a trade mark for the purposes of the statutory notion of proprietorship of the mark before registration. The cases establish that it is not necessary that there be an actual dealing in goods bearing the trade mark before there can be a local use of the mark as a trade mark. It may suffice that imported goods which have not actually reached Australia have been offered for sale in Australia under the mark (Re Registered Trade Mark “Yanx”; Ex parte Amalgamated Tobacco Corporation Ltd. [(1951) 82 CLR 199 at pp 204-205] or that the mark has been used in an advertisement of the goods in the course of trade: Shell Co. of Australia v. Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd [(1963) 109 CLR 407 at p 422]. In such cases, however, it is possible to identify an actual trade or offer to trade in the goods bearing the mark or an existing intention to offer or supply goods bearing the mark in trade. In the present case, there was not, at any relevant time, any actual trade or offer to trade in goods bearing the mark in Australia or any existing intention to offer or supply such goods in trade. There was no local use of the mark as a trade mark at all; there were merely preliminary discussions and negotiations about whether the mark would be so used.\n\n52 The principles referred to by Deane J have been applied to protect the trade mark rights of the owners of foreign trade marks whose marks had not been the subject of any substantial use in Australia, in circumstances where the same or a substantially identical trade mark had been applied for in Australia by another person seeking to obtain some advantage from the registration of the foreign mark in his or her name. However, the application of these principles does not depend upon characterising the other person’s conduct as fraudulent or sharp or as involving some unconscientious misappropriation of the foreign trader’s trade mark. They may also have application in a case where a person is found to have adopted the foreign trader’s mark without any improper motive.\n\n53 The relevant question is whether another person is shown to have a better title to the trade mark than the applicant for registration by reason of that person having used the trade mark either before the earlier of the date the applicant first used the mark as a trade mark in Australia or the date the applicant filed his or her application for registration.\n\nTrade Mark Use\n\n54 Use of a mark as a trade mark involves use of the mark to distinguish the goods or services of the person using the mark from the goods or services of other persons or, as it is sometimes expressed, as a badge of origin indicating a connection in course of trade between the goods or services in relation to which the mark has been used and the person applying the mark: see Scandinavian Tobacco Group Eersel BV v Trojan Trading Company Pty Ltd (2016) 243 FCR 152 at [24]-[30] and the well-known authorities there referred to including E & J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Australia Pty Ltd (2010) 241 CLR 144 (“E&J Gallo”), Coca-Cola Company v All-Fect Distributors Ltd (1999) 96 FCR 107 and Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407. E&J Gallo concerned a claim for an order under s 101(2) of the Act for the removal of the trade mark BAREFOOT in respect of wines on grounds of non-use. In opposing that claim the registered owner relied upon its use of a mark that included the word BAREFOOT in combination with a device in the form of a bare foot. In relation to the concept of trade mark use, the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Bell JJ) said at [41]-[43]:\n\n[41] The concept of “use” of a trade mark which informs ss 92(4)(b), 100(1)(c) and 100(3)(a) of the Trade Marks Act must be understood in the context of s 17, which describes a trade mark as a sign used, or intended to be used, to “distinguish” the goods of one person from the goods of others.\n\n[42] Whilst that definition contains no express reference to the requirement, to be found in s 6(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1955 (Cth), that a trade mark indicate “a connexion in the course of trade” between the goods and the owner, the requirement that a trade mark “distinguish” goods encompasses the orthodox understanding that one function of a trade mark is to indicate the origin of “goods to which the mark is applied”. Distinguishing goods of a registered owner from the goods of others and indicating a connection in the course of trade between the goods and the registered owner are essential characteristics of a trade mark. There is nothing in the relevant Explanatory Memorandum to suggest that s 17 was to effect any change in the orthodox understanding of the function or essential characteristics of a trade mark.\n\n[43] In Coca-Cola Co v All-Fect Distributors Ltd a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia said:\n\n“Use ‘as a trade mark’ is use of the mark as a ‘badge of origin’ in the sense that it indicates a connection in the course of trade between goods and the person who applies the mark to the goods … That is the concept embodied in the definition of “trade mark” in s 17 – a sign used to distinguish goods dealt with in the course of trade by a person from goods so dealt with by someone else.”\n\nThat statement should be approved.\n\n(footnotes omitted)\n\n55 We would also refer to the decision in Woolworths Ltd v BP plc (2006) 154 FCR 97 in which the Full Court said at [77]:\n\n[77] Whether or not there has been use as a trade mark involves an understanding from an objective viewpoint of the purpose and nature of the use, considered in its context in the relevant trade. How the mark has been used may not involve a single or clear idea or message. The mark may be used for a number of purposes, or to a number of ends, but there will be use as a trade mark if one aspect of the use is to distinguish the goods or services provided by a person in the course of trade from the goods or services provided by any other persons, that is to say it must distinguish them in the sense of indicating origin …\n\n(citations omitted)\n\n56 For present purposes we would emphasise the following two related points that emerge from the authorities: first, whether or not the use of a mark constitutes trade mark use depends on the context in which such use occurs; secondly, a mark may be used as a trade mark even though it simultaneously performs a number of functions only one of which is to act as a badge of origin.\n\nSubstantially Identical\n\n57 The relevant test for determining substantial identity was discussed by Windeyer J in Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Australia) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407. His Honour said at 414:\n\nIn considering whether marks are substantially identical they should, I think, be compared side by side, their similarities and differences noted and the importance of these assessed having regard to the essential features of the registered mark and the total impression of resemblance or dissimilarity that emerges from the comparison. “The identification of an essential feature depends”, it has been said, “partly on the Court's own judgment and partly on the burden of the evidence that is placed before it”. Whether there is substantial identity is a question of fact.\n\n(citations omitted)\n\n58 In Carnival Cruise Lines Inc v Sitmar Cruises Ltd (1994) 120 ALR 495 (“Funship”) Gummow J noted at 513 that the phrase “substantially identical” as used in s 62 of the Trade Marks Act 1955 (Cth) (“the 1955 Act”) “… requires a total impression of similarity to emerge from a comparison between the two marks”: see also Colorado Group Ltd v Strandbags Group Pty Ltd (2007) 164 FCR 506 (“Colorado”) per Allsop J (as the Chief Justice then was) at [106]-[110].\n\n59 We have already referred to the facts in E&J Gallo. As we have mentioned, one of the issues that was considered by the High Court in that case was whether the word and device used by the registered owner was substantially identical to the registered mark BAREFOOT. The plurality referred at [20] to s 7(1) of the Act which provides as follows:\n\nIf the Registrar or a prescribed court, having regard to the circumstances of a particular case, thinks fit, the Registrar or the court may decide that a person has used a trade mark if it is established that the person has used the trade mark with additions or alterations that do not substantially affect the identity of the trade mark.\n\n60 The plurality later said at [69]:\n\n[69] … The addition of the device to the registered trade mark is not a feature which separately distinguishes the goods or substantially affects the identity of the registered trade mark because consumers are likely to identify the products sold under the registered trade mark with the device by reference to the word BAREFOOT. The device is an illustration of the word. The monopoly given by a registration of the word BAREFOOT alone is wide enough to include the word together with a device which does not substantially affect the identity of the trade mark in the word alone. So much is recognised by the terms of s 7(1), which speak of additions or alterations which “do not substantially affect the identity of the trade mark”. Except for a situation of honest concurrent use, another trader is likely to be precluded from registering the device alone while the registered trade mark remains on the Register. The device is an addition to the registered trade mark that does not substantially affect its identity. Accordingly, the use of the registered trade mark with the device constitutes use of the registered trade mark in accordance with s 7(1).\n\nServices of the Same Kind\n\n61 The authorities establish that a person’s ownership of a trade mark will usually extend not only to the goods or services in relation to which he or she has used or proposes to use, but also to other goods or services that are “of the same kind.” The expression “the same kind of thing” derives from the judgment of Holroyd J in Re Hicks Trade Mark (1897) 22 VLR 636 at 640. His Honour said at 640:\n\nIn order to substantiate his application to be placed on the register for this word he must have claimed to be the proprietor, and the word “proprietor” must be taken to mean the person entitled to the exclusive use of that name. If there is anyone else who would be interfered with by the registration of the word “Empress” in the exercise of a right which such person has already acquired to use the same word in application to the same kind of thing, then Hicks ought not to have been put on the register for that trade mark.\n\n62 As Kenny J explained in Colorado at [6]:\n\nThe owner of a mark does not have rights at large in relation to the mark. The effect of the 1995 Act, which, in this regard, is much the same as earlier trade mark legislation, is that a trade mark must be registered in respect of particular goods or services as set out in Sch 1 to the Trade Marks Regulations 1995 (Cth): see reg 3.1, 4.4 and Sch 1; also the 1995 Act, ss 19 and 27. Ownership by first use is therefore ownership (or proprietorship) in relation to the goods or classes of goods on which the mark has first been used. The owner’s right to registration in this circumstance is not limited to the identical goods or classes of goods but extends to goods or classes of goods “of the same kind”: see Jackson & Company v Napper (1886) 35 Ch D 162 at 178 and Re Hick’s Trade Mark; Ex parte Metters Bros (1897) 22 VLR 636 at 640.\n\n63 Her Honour said at [14]:\n\nAs we have seen, generally speaking, the prior public use in Australia of a mark as a trade mark – that is, the use of the mark in relation to goods or services in order to show a connection between the goods and the user of the mark – may support the user’s claim to be the “owner” of the mark for the purpose of s 27 of the 1995 Act: see Moorgate Tobacco Company Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd (No 2) (1984) 156 CLR 414 at 432 per Deane J (with whom Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ agreed). For this purpose, too, the owner’s right to registration extends to goods “of the same kind” as the goods that have already borne the mark: see Jackson v Napper 35 Ch D at 178 per Stirling J and Re Hick’s Trade Mark 22 VLR at 640 per Holroyd J. Authoritative discussions show that this extension to goods of the same kind is confined to goods that are essentially the same, though they may differ in size, shape and name. This point is emphasised in Jackson v Napper 35 Ch D 162 where Stirling J gave some attention to this question in considering the difference between an axe and a hatchet.\n\n64 As Allsop J also observed in Colorado at [89], there is a difficulty involved in fixing upon the proper frame of reference for the purpose of determining whether goods or services are of the same kind. Nevertheless, as his Honour also suggested at [89], the question whether goods or services are of the same kind must be addressed in a practical and common sense way and by asking whether the relevant goods or services are essentially the same.\n\nThe Appellant’s Submissions\n\nPower to cancel the registered trade marks\n\n65 We will first consider the appellant’s challenge to the primary judge’s order for cancelling the registration for the ANCHORAGE and the ANCHORAGE CAPITAL marks. In short, the appellant’s submissions (which fall into three groups) were that the second respondent could not be the owner of those marks because:\n\n· any trade mark use of the US ANCHORAGE names in the slide presentation was not use in relation to the registered services or services of the same kind as the registered services;\n\n· at the time the slide presentations were sent to Australia, the second respondent had no existing intention to offer to supply its services in Australia; and\n\n· the names ANCHORAGE and ANCHORAGE CAPITAL, while used in the slide presentation, were not used as trade marks.\n\n66 We will deal with each of these groups of submissions in turn.\n\nWas the second respondent’s use of the US ANCHORAGE names use in relation to the same kind of services?\n\nThe primary judge’s reasons\n\n67 We agree with the appellant that in considering the question of ownership the primary judge does not appear to have had regard to the turnaround proviso when determining whether the second respondent was the first to use the registered marks (or other substantially identical marks) in Australia in respect of the registered services. We should say, in fairness to the primary judge, that this issue appears to have received much more attention in the appeal than it did before the primary judge. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the issue was raised by the appellant at the trial and that it is a matter that is open to the appellant to raise in the appeal.\n\nThe registered services\n\n68 The starting point for the purpose of considering the appellant’s first submission is the description of the services in respect of which each of the relevant marks is registered.\n\n69 The description consists of a general description of a wide range of financial activities followed by qualifying words that we have referred to as the turnaround proviso. The effect of the qualifying words is that the registered services include, for example, financial investment management services or fund management services, but only if those services are “targeted towards special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance.”\n\n70 The evidence indicates that the turnaround proviso was introduced into the description of the registered services at the suggestion of an Examiner appointed by the Commissioner of Trade Marks in order to avoid rejection of the applications for registration on account of the existence of two other trade mark registrations. We should point out that it was not suggested by any party that the existence of these earlier trade mark registrations (which were not in evidence) had any bearing on the issues that arise in the case. Nor did the appellant submit that the fact that the Examiner suggested that the turnaround proviso be included in the description of the registered services should have any bearing on the determination of the issue now under consideration.\n\n71 It is convenient to break the description of the registered services down into its various components which cover the following services:\n\n(1) acquisition for financial investment targeted toward special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance;\n\n(2) administration of financial affairs targeted toward special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance;\n\n(3) advisory services relating to financial investment targeted toward special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance;\n\n(4) conduct of financial transactions targeted toward special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance;\n\n(5) financial advisory services for companies targeted toward special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance;\n\n(6) asset management targeted toward special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance;\n\n(7) financial fund management targeted toward special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance;\n\n(8) financial investment management services targeted toward special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance; and\n\n(9) financial transaction services targeted toward special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance.\n\nFor convenience we shall refer to these nine categories of services using the numbers we have given them.\n\nThe slide presentation\n\n72 The first slide presentation was sent by email to an Australian email address associated with a well-known public company (“Company X”) on 25 January 2007 in response to what is referred to as “your recent request”. The subject of the email is described as “Anchorage Presentation” and the attached slide presentation is referred to as “the Anchorage Overview Presentation”. A second slide presentation was sent by email to another company in Australia (“Company Y”) on 30 January 2007. Both emails were sent by Anchorage Advisors LLC (as the second respondent was then known) which is the company which later became the parent company of the first respondent.\n\n73 The slide presentation includes a cover page that includes a corporate mark consisting of a device and the words “ANCHORAGE CAPITAL GROUP – ACP, ACC & ASC FUNDS OVERVIEW”. On the next page under the heading “IMPORTANT STATEMENT” the following appears:\n\nThe enclosed materials are being provided by Anchorage Capital Group, L.L.C. and its affiliates (collectively “Anchorage”) for informational and discussion purposes only and do not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any current or future Anchorage fund. Any such offer or solicitation shall be made only pursuant to the confidential private placement memorandum of the relevant fund (the “Memorandum”), which describes risks related to an investment therein. The Memorandum, including the risk factors and potential conflicts of interest described therein, should be read carefully prior to investment. No offer to purchase interests will be made or accepted prior to receipt by the offeree of the Memorandum and the relevant subscription documents, all of which must be read in their entirety. The information contained herein should be treated in a confidential manner and may not be reproduced or used in whole or in part for any other purpose. Each person receiving the enclosed materials thereby agrees to return them promptly upon request. Certain information contained herein has been obtained from published sources prepared by other parties. While such sources are believed to be reliable, none of Anchorage, its general partners, its investment advisers, or their respective affiliates, assumes any responsibility for such information.\n\n74 The next page is headed “ANCHORAGE FUNDS”. It includes a description of four investment funds, the Anchorage Capital Partners Funds (“the ACP Funds”), the Anchorage Cross-Over Credit Funds and the Anchorage Short Credit Offshore Funds (“the Anchorage Funds”). In describing the investment philosophy of the Anchorage Funds the slide presentation states:\n\n· “Take what we view as limited risk until we believe asset class or sector dislocation occurs”;\n\n· “Pursue what we believe are best absolute risk-adjusted opportunities on both a long and short basis”;\n\n· “Seek to exploit valuation inefficiencies by applying fundamental credit and default analyses to a variety of markets”;\n\n· “Fundamental credit analysis drives the investment decision as compared to reliance on rating agencies, relative value or portfolio analytics”;\n\n· “Focus on situations that we believe are complete, misunderstood and/or under-followed”;\n\n· “Model-based portfolio tools assist portfolio management process but do not set rigid guidelines”.\n\nThe slide presentation also states:\n\n· “ACP Funds are global special-situations funds that invest across the capital structure on a long and short basis”.\n\n75 It is clear from the slide presentation that the ACP Funds seek higher risk-return opportunities than the other Anchorage Funds, including through “Equity Risk/Distressed” positions.\n\n76 The appellant submitted that the slide presentation showed that the second respondent was promoting investment services associated with the buying and selling of mispriced assets for profit. It submitted that these services are not of the same kind as the registered services because they do not involve identifying companies which have “turnaround” prospects, investing in them and working with the management of those companies to turn them around before selling them. The appellant submitted that the investment services described in the slide presentation were of a quite different character.\n\n77 The appellant’s submissions at times suggested that it was not permissible when deciding whether any of the US ANCHORAGE names were used in relation to services of the same kind as the registered services to look beyond the slide presentation for the purpose of deciding whether the services referred to in that document were the same as the registered services or services of the same kind. We do not think that is correct.\n\n78 In our view the court is entitled to look beyond the slide presentation for the purpose of determining what services were being offered to its recipients. For example, where the slide presentation describes the type of investments made by the ACP Funds, we consider it is permissible to look to other evidence for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and scope of its various activities. This is because the question that must be addressed is whether the US ANCHORAGE names were used by the second respondent in relation to the registered services or services of the same kind.\n\n79 The evidence includes copies of the second respondent’s letter to investors dated 27 March 2007 (“the 2006 Annual Investor Letter”) that includes a detailed description of “The Anchorage Funds” including the ACP Funds. Copies of the 2006 Annual Investor Letter were forwarded by the second respondent to a number of companies in Australia in September and October 2007.\n\n80 The 2006 Annual Investor Letter states at p 9:\n\nThe ACP Funds generated the majority of their returns in 2006 from Equity & Distressed investments. A number of our positions benefited from positive operational catalysts that helped the market recognize and value the underlying cash flow potential of our companies. These long positions subsequently experienced significant price appreciation. Such investments were consistent with our goal of finding Equity & Distressed investments with a particular emphasis on operational catalysts and cash flow expansion rather than multiple expansion …\n\nIn 2006, we continued to focus on long positions we believed were either under-followed or misunderstood. Many of the investment opportunities we found tended to be in companies with market capitalizations below $3 billion, as larger companies were generally better followed and better understood. Also, we were particularly active in sectors where we had a research emphasis for an extended period of time. Generally, we were active in these sectors when the sectors were distressed. As a result, we have strong insight into the companies that participate in these sectors, the professionals who provide banking and legal advice to the sector and the management teams who have run the underlying companies. In addition, given where we were in the economic and credit cycle, we focused on situations where a specific operational catalyst was expected to lead to a revaluation of the company in the near-term.\n\n81 The 2006 Annual Investor Letter shows that the ACP Funds focused on “Equity & Distressed Investments”. These are defined in an appendix to the document to mean investments that generally have “an equity like profile” and include “holdings of equity securities and distressed debt investments that generally have equity like risk …”. There is no doubt that this definition extends to holdings of either equity or debt in underperforming companies.\n\n82 It is apparent from this evidence that the second respondent was, at the time it sent the slide presentation in January 2007, engaged in the management of funds used to acquire investments that included debt or equity investments in special situations involving mismanaged or underperforming companies. What is less clear is whether it can be said that these activities were conducted in order to “help improve” the financial performance of those companies.\n\n83 There will be many situations in which investment by a fund manager in a mismanaged or underperforming company may help improve the financial position of the company. This could be true, for example, where the fund manager acquires securities issued by the company to raise funds for the purpose of increasing working capital, funding a restructure or reorganisation, or consolidating or retiring debt. In these situations the financial interests of the fund manager will frequently be aligned with the financial interests of the company because the return on investment will usually depend on the company achieving some improvement in its financial performance.\n\n84 The question in this case is whether the services referred to in the slide presentation are the same kind of services as the registered services. We are satisfied that the services described in the slide presentation included the same services or the same kind of services as categories of service (1), (6), (7) and (8) referred to above. There seems to be little or no difference between the character of the services provided by a fund manager who targets “special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies” and a fund manager who targets “special situations and mismanaged or underperforming companies to help improve their financial performance”.\n\n85 The fact that in some cases the fund manager makes an investment to help improve the financial performance of an underperforming company in which the fund manager invests does not change the essential character of the relevant service. Investments by fund managers in mismanaged or underperforming companies are often made in the expectation that some change in the circumstances, including the company’s financial performance, will generate a financial return for investors and (usually through the payment of management and performance fees) the fund manager. Further, such investments, particularly those involving re-capitalisation or refinancing, will often be made for the purpose of helping to improve the financial performance of the company.\n\n86 We reject the appellant’s first group of submissions.\n\nDid the second respondent intend to offer to supply its services in Australia?\n\n87 The present case concerns the use of service marks. As Gummow J observed in Funship at 509:\n\n[A] service will not exist before its supply. Thus, the use of a trade mark in relation to services may readily be understood as a use in and about the soliciting and conclusion of contracts for the supply thereafter of services.\n\n88 It was submitted that the primary judge erred in finding that the second respondent intended to supply services in Australia and that the evidence did not establish that the second respondent intended to supply or offer services in Australia until after May 2011. The submission focused on s 911A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) as it stood at the relevant time (“the Corporations Act”) and Class Order 3/824.\n\n89 Section 911A(1) of the Corporations Act provided that, subject to the section, a person who carries on a financial services business in this jurisdiction must hold an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of financial services. Section 911A(2) included numerous exceptions including, in subpara (h)(ii), if the person provides the service in circumstances covered by an exemption specified in writing by ASIC under that subparagraph and published in the Gazette.\n\n90 Section 911D of the Corporations Act provided that a financial service business is taken to be carried on in this jurisdiction if, in the course of carrying on the business, the person engages in conduct that is intended to induce people in this jurisdiction to use the financial services that person provides.\n\n91 There was an exemption under s 911A(2)(1) in the form of Class Order 3/824 (“the Class Order”) dated 26 September 2003 that was in force at all relevant times. The Class Order provided in para 1:\n\n(1) Under paragraph 911A(2)(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (the Act), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission exempts a person from the requirement to hold an Australian financial services licence for the provision of a financial service where all of the following apply:\n\n(a) the service is provided to wholesale clients only; and\n\n(b) but for section 911D of the Act, the person would not be carrying on a financial services business in this jurisdiction; and\n\n(c) the person does not hold an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the service.\n\n92 The appellant’s analysis of the relevant statutory provisions, the Class Order and the judgment in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Activesuper Pty Ltd (No 1) (2012) 92 ACSR 614 (“Activesuper”), were relied upon by it in support of the submission that the Court should not infer from the 25 January 2007 email or the slide presentation attached to it that the second respondent had an intention to supply investment services in Australia in circumstances where it would have been unlawful for it to do so by reason of s 911A(1). In essence, the appellant’s submission was that the Court should not infer that the second respondent had any intention of providing financial services in Australia in early 2007 because, were it to have done so, the second respondent would have contravened s 911A(1) of the Corporations Act.\n\n93 The appellant submitted that this Class Order would not apply to the second respondent if it was actually carrying on a financial business in Australia (ie. other than by reason of the deeming effect of s 911D). It also submitted that as at January 2007 the second respondent was actually carrying on a financial business in Australia.\n\n94 We accept the first but not the second of these propositions. The evidence does not support a finding that the second respondent was actually carrying on a financial services business in Australia in January 2007.\n\n95 The appellant relied on the following statement of Dodds-Streeton J in Activesuper at [47]:\n\nProvided that there are acts within Australia which are part of the company’s business, the company will be doing business in Australia (see Gebo Investments (Labuan) Ltd v Signatory Investments Pty Ltd (2005) 54 ACSR 111 at [41], citing Actiesselskabet Dampskib “Hercules” v Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co [1912] 1 KB 222) although the bulk of its business is conducted elsewhere (see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edwards [2004] QSC 344 at [39]) and it maintains no office in Australia (Bray v F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (2002) 118 FCR 1; 190 ALR 1; [2002] FCA 243 at [63]).\n\n96 There are a number of points to make in relation to Dodds-Streeton J’s decision.\n\n97Activesuper was an interlocutory decision, made after an ex parte hearing at which the applicant sought leave to serve a foreign corporation outside the jurisdiction. The paragraph in the judgment on which the appellant placed reliance must be read in the context of what was said by her Honour immediately before at [43]-[46]. In those paragraphs her Honour referred to other decisions including Hope v Council of the City of Bathurst (1980) 144 CLR 1 in which Mason J observed at 8 that the words “carrying on” in the expression “carrying on business” imply the repetition of acts. This is consistent with the view that a foreign company may engage in some commercial activity in the jurisdiction but still not carry on business in the jurisdiction. This view of the law is also reflected in the Revised Explanatory Memorandum to the Financial Services Reform Bill which included discussion concerning what became the definition of “financial services business” in s 761A (“a business of providing financial services”) and s 911A of the Corporations Act, which (as previously mentioned) provides that a person who “carries on a financial services business in the jurisdiction” must hold a relevant licence.\n\n98 The Revised Explanatory Memorandum stated at para 6.116:\n\nThe common law meaning of ‘carrying on a business’ encompassing elements of system, repetition and continuity suggests that one-off transactions relating to the provision of financial services and financial products are unlikely to be caught by this regime. So, for example, a one-off issue of securities would be unlikely to fall within the definition of ‘carrying on a financial services business’.\n\n99 Whether a company is carrying on business in Australia is a question of fact: Luckins (Receiver & Manager of Australian Trailways Pty Ltd) v Highway Motel (Carnarvon) Pty Ltd (1975) 133 CLR 164 at 186. While it is correct to say that a company may be found to carry on business in Australia even though it does not maintain an office in Australia or the bulk of its business is carried on outside Australia, it does not follow that such a company will be found to carry on business in Australia merely because it has engaged in a small number of isolated transactions. Each case will depend on its own facts.\n\n100 The evidence shows that the second respondent sent a copy of the slide presentation to Company X in January 2007 from which it may be inferred (as we discuss further below) that the second respondent was expressing its willingness to provide fund management services to Company X if the second respondent and Company X decided that they would proceed further. It is not suggested by the appellant that the second respondent entered into contracts or commercial arrangements with Company X as a result of this communication or that the second respondent had any premises, employees or agents, or any other presence, in Australia at that time.\n\n101 It may be that as a result of sending the slide presentation to Australia, the second respondent could be taken to have been carrying on a financial services business in Australia by reason of the operation of s 911A of the Corporations Act. Whether or not that is so is a matter on which it is unnecessary for us to express an opinion. However, even if the second respondent was to be taken as carrying on a financial services business, the Class Order would most likely have applied to it, relieving it of the need to hold an Australian financial services licence.\n\n102 Accordingly, we do not accept that s 911A of the Corporations Act is of any assistance in determining whether the second respondent intended to offer its fund management and investment services to either Company X or Company Y.\n\n103 The appellant also submitted that the evidence did not establish that the second respondent had an existing intention to offer to supply or supply any of the registered services in Australia. It submitted that any use made of the US ANCHORAGE names in the slide presentation was not trade mark use because there was no intention to supply or offer to supply any services. Reliance was placed on the passage in the judgment of Deane J in Moorgate at 434 to which we have referred. In that case his Honour held that the use made of the relevant mark occurred in the course of negotiations and discussions about whether the mark would be used in the course of trade. This was held not to constitute use of the mark as a trade mark.\n\n104 In essence, the appellant’s submission was that the primary judge drew an impermissible inference when finding at [36] that, at the time the slide presentation was sent to Australia in January 2007, the second respondent was seeking to provide its fund management services to investors.\n\n105 The High Court has recently reminded us that findings of fact by trial judges are not to be interfered with unless they are shown to be wrong: Robinson Helicopter Company Inc v McDermott (2016) 331 ALR 550 at [43]. Not only are we not convinced that the primary judge’s finding was wrong, we are satisfied that it was correct.\n\n106 In his first written statement (para 77) Mr Fitzpatrick stated that the slide presentation was sent to two companies from Australia in January 2007. In the cross-examination of Mr Fitzpatrick (T 346) it was put to him that in late January 2007 Anchorage Capital Group LLC was “delivering documents like that into the hands of potential investors …” [our emphasis]. The inference that the documents were sent to potential investors for the purpose of attracting investments in the Anchorage Funds is compelling.\n\n107 While it is true that the slide presentation contains a notice making it clear that the document is not to be construed as an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any of the Anchorage Funds, it would be a mistake to infer from this that the second respondent and its affiliates were not intending to encourage the potential investors to apply to purchase such an interest using a prescribed private placement memorandum of the kind identified in the notice.\n\n108 Mr Darke SC submitted that there were other “entirely plausible” explanations for sending the slide presentation to Australia. He submitted that it may have been sent for the purpose of seeing whether there was sufficient interest for the second respondent to provide its investment services in Australia. Were that the case one might expect to see a qualifying statement in the email advising that the second respondent was yet to decide whether to open its funds to investors from Australia. We do not consider Mr Darke’s alternative explanation to be particularly convincing and consider it much more likely that the slide presentation was sent to Australia to create a market for the second respondent’s services in Australia.\n\n109 The appellant further submitted that the primary judge should have drawn an inference adverse to the respondents arising out of their failure to elicit evidence from any witness, including Mr Fitzpatrick, directed to the question of whether the second respondent had an intention to supply its investment management services to investors in Australia. In support of this submission the appellant relied upon the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 (“Ferrcom”) in which Handley JA considered the application of the principles referred to in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 in circumstances where it may be inferred that a party refrains from examining a witness-in-chief on a particular topic for fear that it would have exposed facts unfavourable to that party.\n\n110 We were informed by Mr Dimitriadis SC, who appeared for the respondents, that this point was not raised by the appellant before the primary judge, a proposition that was not contradicted by Mr Darke SC in his submissions in reply. This would explain why the primary judge did not address the question whether any such inference should be drawn. But putting this point aside, we would not infer that the failure of the respondents to elicit additional evidence from Mr Fitzpatrick on the topic of the second respondent’s intentions was attributable to any fear on their part that such evidence would have exposed facts unfavourable to them.\n\n111 In the result, we are satisfied that the primary judge was correct to conclude that at the time the slide presentation was sent to Australia in January 2007, the second respondent intended to provide fund management services to companies in Australia. The fact that the second respondent would not make or accept any offer for investment in their funds before the potential investor was provided with and had read the private placement memorandum is not inconsistent with that conclusion.\n\n112 The question whether there has been trade mark use in Australia based on an offer to supply services by a foreign supplier does not depend on whether the foreign supplier made what may be regarded as either an offer or an invitation to treat in contract law. Concepts derived from the field of contract law are of little assistance in deciding whether there has been trade mark use in such cases. In particular, a finding of trade mark use may be open if the foreign supplier uses the mark so as to indicate his or her willingness to supply the relevant services conditionally or on terms to be agreed.\n\n113 We infer from the email and attached slide presentation that the second respondent was communicating its willingness to provide its funds management services to Company X and Company Y subject to preparation and completion of a private placement memorandum and on terms to be agreed. We do not think it matters that this was not an offer in the contractual sense or that it was conditional or qualified. Many financial services are advertised and promoted on the footing that the supplier is not required to provide them until various documents are completed and agreed. The use made of a mark in connection with such activities may still qualify as trade mark use sufficient to establish ownership provided the supplier is willing and able to provide the relevant services to persons with whom the supplier may choose to do business.\n\n114 The appellant advanced an alternative submission which was that, if the second respondent had intended to provide financial services in Australia in January 2007, then it could never have acquired ownership of any of the US ANCHORAGE names in Australia because it could not lawfully carry on the business in which it was using or proposing to use those marks. Put shortly, the appellant submitted that a person could not acquire ownership of a trade mark on the basis of an intention to provide services in Australia that the person could not lawfully provide.\n\n115 We do not accept the appellant’s alternative submission. It is sufficient to say that the submission wrongly assumes that the second respondent could not carry on the business of providing financial services in Australia. It was always open to the second respondent to obtain a financial services licence or to bring itself within the exemption provided by Class Order 03/1100 entitled “US SEC regulated financial service providers”. In fact it is common ground that it did this in 2009 when it executed a deed poll in favour of ASIC. It also ignores the fact that ownership of a trade mark can be acquired as a result of slight use that need not occur in the course of carrying on a business in Australia.\n\n116 We reject the appellant’s second group of submissions.\n\nWas there trade mark use?\n\n117 It was submitted by the appellant that the word “Anchorage” was not used in the slide presentation as a trade mark, but as a defined term in what the appellant’s written submissions characterised as “a legal document” to refer to Anchorage Capital Group LLC and its affiliates. The appellant also submitted that the term “Anchorage Capital” was not used in the slide presentation at all. We will deal with these two submissions in turn.\n\n118 As to the first submission, the slide presentation is not a legal document but a marketing and promotional document. The fact that the word “Anchorage” is used in the slide presentation as a defined term is not inconsistent with that word also functioning as a trade mark. It is true that in the section of the slide presentation headed “IMPORTANT STATEMENT” Anchorage Capital Group LLC and its affiliates (which included the second respondent) are collectively defined by the word “Anchorage”. However, a consideration of the slide presentation as a whole indicates that this word also functions as a badge of origin by indicating a connection in the course of trade between the investment services described in the slide presentation and the relevant corporate entities; see, for example, the page in the slide presentation headed “ANCHORAGE FUNDS” where the word “Anchorage” is used to indicate a relevant connection between the relevant corporate entities and the investment funds described on the same page. In our view the word “Anchorage” is used in the slide presentation as a trade mark. The accompanying email also refers to the “Anchorage Presentation” and the “Anchorage Overview Presentation”. The word “Anchorage” is clearly being used in this email as a trade mark.\n\n119 As to the second submission, the slide presentation also uses the composite term “Anchorage Capital Group”. The fact that the slide presentation may not use the words “Anchorage Capital” alone as a trade mark is immaterial because (as discussed further below) “Anchorage Capital Group” is in our opinion substantially identical to “Anchorage Capital”. To use the language of s 7(1) of the Act, the addition of the word “Group” to the mark ANCHORAGE CAPITAL, does not substantially affect its identity.\n\n120 We reject the appellant’s third group of submissions.\n\nThe additional prior use relied upon by the respondents\n\n121 The respondents relied upon what they submitted was evidence of other trade mark use by the second respondent or its affiliates of the US ANCHORAGE names in Australia in 2006 and 2007. These documents were reproduced in a folder provided to the Full Court entitled “Respondents’ Evidence of Prior Trade Mark Use” (“the Respondents’ Bundle”) that included 64 documents including the slide presentations of 25 January 2007 (Tab 27) and 30 January 2007 (Tab 28).\n\n122 The documents relied on by the respondents include copies of the slide presentation and the 2006 Annual Investor Letter sent to potential institutional investors by email on 14 September 2007 and 11 October 2007. We are satisfied that this is evidence of further use by the second respondent and its affiliates in September and October 2007. This is well before March 2008 when the appellant obtained its financial services licence and (we infer) first commenced using the ANCHORAGE and ANCHORAGE CAPITAL marks in relation to any financial or investment services. In any event, nothing turns on this given the findings made in relation to the slide presentations of 25 January 2007 and 30 January 2007.\n\n123 As to the other documents included in the Respondents’ Bundle, we are not persuaded that any of them reveal any additional trade mark use of the US ANCHORAGE names in relation to the registered services or services of the same kind as the registered services. Apart from those to which we have already referred, the documents included in the Respondents’ Bundle do not use the words ANCHORAGE, ANCHORAGE CAPITAL or ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS as a badge of origin for any service that the second respondent or its affiliates provided or was offering to provide in Australia. Rather, the documents record communications between the second respondent or its affiliates’ employees in the United States and persons in Australia in connection with potential investments in Australia by the Anchorage Funds. Unlike the slide presentations, these documents do not even faintly suggest that the second respondent or its affiliates were providing or offering to provide any service to the recipients or any other person in Australia.\n\n124 We do not consider that the other documents relied upon by the respondents provide any evidence of trade mark use in Australia in 2006 or 2007.\n\nAnchorage Capital Partners\n\n125 The second respondent advanced two contentions relevant to the issue of substantial identity in support of its cross-appeal with respect to the ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS mark.\n\n126 First, the second respondent contended that the primary judge made no reference to the fact that the slide presentation uses the words “Anchorage Capital Partners” in relation to the Anchorage Funds and that his Honour should have found that “Anchorage Capital Partners” was used as a trade mark in the slide presentation.\n\n127 Secondly, the second respondent contended that, contrary to the primary judge’s finding, the marks “ANCHORAGE CAPITAL” and “Anchorage Capital Group” are substantially identical to the “Anchorage Capital Partners” mark. It further contended that the appellant had made an admission to this effect in its statement of claim in the course of alleging infringement because the appellant pleaded that “Anchorage Capital” and “Anchorage Capital Group” are “substantially identical with and/or deceptively similar” to “Anchorage Capital Partners” and that this fact had been admitted by the respondents in their defence.\n\n128 In answer to the pleading point, the appellant raises two matters. First, it says that the relevant admission in the statement of claim left open a case that “Anchorage Capital”, “Anchorage Capital Group” and “Anchorage Capital Partners” were deceptively similar but not substantially identical. Secondly, it says that the relevant pleading, which is said to be the second respondent’s cross-claim, included an allegation to the effect that “Anchorage Capital”, “Anchorage Capital Group” and “Anchorage Capital Partners” were substantially identical but that this was answered with a non-admission in the appellant’s defence to cross-claim.\n\n129 It is apparent that the parties gave these pleading issues little if any attention before the primary judge. In particular, we accept the second respondent’s submission (which was not contradicted by the appellant) that the second respondent advanced a case before the primary judge based on its use of the name “Anchorage Capital Partners” in the slide presentation.\n\n130 As to the pleading point raised by the second respondent, and the appellant’s answer to it, we do not need to resolve either of them because, in our opinion, the name “Anchorage Capital” is substantially identical to the “ANCHORAGE CAPITAL PARTNERS” mark. The common feature of the name “Anchorage Capital” and the mark “Anchorage Capital Partners” are the words “Anchorage Capital”. The word “PARTNERS” makes a relatively unimportant contribution to the overall impression conveyed in a side by side comparison of the two marks. In our view the name “Anchorage Capital” and “Anchorage Capital Partners” are substantially identical.\n\n131 The appellant accepted that the name “Anchorage Capital Partners” was used in the slide presentation but submitted that it was not used as a trade mark. We do not accept that submission. Those words were used to identify the second respondent’s and its affiliates’ funds and served to distinguish those funds from funds established and managed by other fund managers. In our view the use of the name “Anchorage Capital Partners” in the slide presentation constituted trade mark use by the second respondent.\n\nDiscretion to Cancel\n\nBackground\n\n132 As we have mentioned, the primary judge approached the application for cancellation of the registered marks on the basis that, if a relevant ground for cancellation was established, the court had a discretion as to whether or not to order cancellation. For reasons we have explained, the primary judge ordered cancellation of two of the registered marks in respect of which he was satisfied a ground for cancellation had been established. The appellant says that even if grounds for cancellation were established, the primary judge should have declined to make any order for cancellation on discretionary grounds.\n\n133 Before the primary judge the respondents argued that, if grounds for cancellation were established, there was no discretion to refuse to make an order for cancellation. The respondents raised the same argument in their notice of contention. It is convenient to deal with this threshold issue before considering the appellant’s appeal against the primary judge’s decision not to refuse to make an order for cancellation on discretionary grounds.\n\nThe relevant statutory provisions\n\n134 Sections 87, 88 and 89 of the Act provide:\n\n87 Amendment or cancellation—loss of exclusive rights to use trade mark\n\n(1) If section 24 or 25 applies in relation to a registered trade mark, a prescribed court may, on the application of an aggrieved person or the Registrar, but subject to subsection (2) and section 89, order that the Register be rectified by:\n\n(a) cancelling the registration of the trade mark; or\n\n(b) removing or amending any entry in the Register relating to the trade mark;\n\nhaving regard to the effect of section 24 or 25 (as the case may be) on the right of the registered owner of the trade mark to use the trade mark, or any sign that is part of the trade mark, in relation to particular goods or services.\n\n(2) If section 24 or 25 applies in relation to the trade mark because the trade mark contains a sign that:\n\n(a) has become generally accepted within the relevant trade as the sign that describes or is the name of an article, substance or service; or\n\n(b) describes or is the name of:\n\n(i) an article or substance that was formerly exploited under a patent; or\n\n(ii) a service that was formerly provided as a patented process;\n\nthe court may decide not to make an order under subsection (1) and allow the trade mark to remain on the Register in respect of:\n\n(c) the article or substance or goods of the same description; or\n\n(d) the service or services of the same description;\n\nsubject to any condition or limitation that the court may impose.\n\n88 Amendment or cancellation—other specified grounds\n\n(1) Subject to subsection (2) and section 89, a prescribed court may, on the application of an aggrieved person or the Registrar, order that the Register be rectified by:\n\n(a) cancelling the registration of a trade mark; or\n\n(b) removing or amending an entry wrongly made or remaining on the Register; or\n\n(c) entering any condition or limitation affecting the registration of a trade mark that ought to be entered.\n\n(2) An application may be made on any of the following grounds, and on no other grounds:\n\n(a) any of the grounds on which the registration of the trade mark could have been opposed under this Act;\n\n(b) an amendment of the application for the registration of the trade mark was obtained as a result of fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation;\n\n(c) because of the circumstances applying at the time when the application for rectification is filed, the use of the trade mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion;\n\n(e) if the application is in respect of an entry in the Register—the entry was made, or has been previously amended, as a result of fraud, false suggestion or misrepresentation.\n\n89 Rectification may not be granted in certain cases if registered owner not at fault etc.\n\n(1) The court may decide not to grant an application for rectification made:\n\n(a) under section 87; or\n\n(b) on the ground that the trade mark is liable to deceive or confuse (a ground on which its registration could have been opposed, see paragraph 88(2)(a)); or\n\n(c) on the ground referred to in paragraph 88(2)(c);\n\nif the registered owner of the trade mark satisfies the court that the ground relied on by the applicant has not arisen through any act or fault of the registered owner.\n\n(2) In making a decision under subsection (1), the court:\n\n(a) must also take into account any matter that is prescribed; and\n\n(b) may take into account any other matter that the court considers relevant.\n\n(Notes omitted)\n\n135 Section 87 only applies in circumstances where either s 24 or s 25 applies in relation to a registered trade mark. Section 24 is concerned with situations in which a registered trade mark has become descriptive of an article, substance or service: see, for example, Re Daiquiri Rum Trade Mark [1969] RPC 600. Section 25 is concerned with situations in which a registered mark that is the only commonly known way to describe or identify an article or substance previously exploited under a patent that is no longer in force or a service previously exploited as a patented process. It is not necessary to refer to either s 24 or s 25 in any greater detail, but it is worth mentioning that s 56 of the 1955 Act contained analogous provisions.\n\nThe respondents’ submission\n\n136 The second respondent submitted that although the word “may” in s 88(1) is used in a facultative sense, that is to say, to confer authority to make an order for rectification in particular circumstances, it did not follow that once those circumstances are found to exist, it is open to the Court not to exercise that authority. According to the respondents’ submission, s 88(1) is part of a statutory scheme which establishes a discretion not to cancel a registered trade mark in some situations but not others.\n\n137 The different senses in which the word “may” can be used in a statutory provision that confers a power to take a step (eg. cancelling a licence or refunding an overpayment) were explained by Gleeson CJ and McHugh J in Samad v District Court of New South Wales (2002) 209 CLR 140 as follows at [32]-[34]:\n\n[32] When a statutory power is conferred by the use of words of permission, there may arise a question whether the effect is to impose an obligation, or, at least, an obligation that must be performed in certain circumstances. Even where it is plain that the intention of the legislature was permissive, questions may arise as to the nature of the considerations that the person in whom the power is confided may be entitled or bound to take into account in the exercise of the discretion conferred. Issues of this kind are to be resolved as a matter of statutory interpretation, having regard to the language of the statute, the context of the relevant provision, and the general scope and objects of the legislation [Ward v Williams (1955) 92 CLR 496 at 505, per Dixon CJ, Webb, Fullagar, Kitto and Taylor JJ].\n\n[33] As was pointed out in Ward v Williams [(1955) 92 CLR 496 at 506] there is a long history of legislative intervention in New South Wales “to restrain the development of the notion that permissive words may have a compulsive effect”. The current provision is s 9 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) which, except in so far as the contrary intention appears in an Act or instrument (s 5), provides that the word “may'”, if used to confer a power, indicates that the power may be exercised or not, at discretion.\n\n[34] An example of a statutory provision in which a contrary intention appeared may be seen in Finance Facilities Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [(1971) 127 CLR 106]. Section 46(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) provided that, if the Commissioner was satisfied that certain conditions as to non-payment of dividends were fulfilled, the Commissioner “may allow” a private company a rebate in its assessment. This Court held that, if the Commissioner was satisfied of the specified condition, then he was obliged to allow the rebate. The taxpayer had a right or entitlement. The context indicated that it was not intended that the Commissioner should have a discretionary power to defeat that right or entitlement. The word “may” conferred a power; and the statutory intention was that the power be exercised if the condition was fulfilled. That decision may be compared with Commissioner of State Revenue (Vict) v Royal Insurance Australia Ltd [(1994) 182 CLR 51], where this Court was divided on the question whether a provision empowering a revenue authority to refund overpaid duty conferred a discretion, or whether it merely gave authority to make a payment which had to be exercised in the circumstances indicated.\n\n138 In support of their submission the respondents relied upon the decision of Branson J in EOS Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd (1998) 42 IPR 277 (“EOS”) in which her Honour expressed the view that s 88(1) of the Act does not confer a discretion not to cancel a registered trade mark. The registered owner in that case sought to rely on equitable concepts of delay and acquiescence. Her Honour said at 286-287:\n\nIt is necessary to give consideration to the relevance, if any, of such equitable notions in the context of s 88(1) of the Act. Section 88 is concerned with the integrity of a public register, and not merely with the respective rights of parties inter se. In my view, s 88(1) does not itself give to a court a true discretion to order, or not to order, rectification of the register where a ground of rectification specified in s"
