        "text": "One of the biggest cruise ship upgrade projects completed in the final quarter of 2010 took place not in Europe or the Americas but in Singapore, at the Sembawang yard, where the former Ocean Village was transformed into Pacific Pearl for P&O Cruises Australia. The multi-million pound project highlights the growing capabilities of Sembawang in this field and follows the signing of a long-term agreement last October with the Carnival group, which is making the yard its regional centre for cruise refurbishment, repair and conversion activity.\n\nThe 63,000gt Ocean Village arrived at Sembawang on 18 November for a three week programme of works in the yard, designed to align the vessel to the requirements of the P&O Australia brand. The project was very much a multinational one, with detailed design planning starting in the UK, with close liaison between Carnival and London-Based SMC Design, while structural design and steel fabrication was focused on Singapore. The project also involved subcontractors from various parts of the world, including the UK, Scandinavia, America and Australasia.\n\nThe diversity of the project created a significant logistics challenge which Carnival and the yard had to manage. In all, some 240 shipping containers from all over the world were stacked at the yard with items for the refit at one stage.\n\nFor Sembawang, this was the second project undertaken recently for Carnival Australia, following on from the successful upgrade of Pacific Jewel (built in 1990 as Crown Princess) in November 2009. For Pacific Pearl, the yard was tasked with carrying out a wide range of works, including the replacement of lifeboats and tenders, the installation of four new tenders and davits, and the fabrication and installation of the new HQ teen centre on the main deck level. The new HQ unit weighed around 40 tonnes and was lifted onto the vessel during a docking at the yard.\n\nFitting this prefabricated unit involved complex HVAC and electrical works as well, which the team at Sembawang handled successfully. The new HQ complex covers 190m2 in total and features floor-to-ceiling windows with ‘stunning views, two giant screens – one for Playstations and one for films – 21 Playstations, a surround sound system, dance floor and custom made deck furniture.\n\nSembawang also gave the vessel a new look, repainting the exterior, using latest generation, environmentally friendly silicone paints, in P&O’s blue and white livery. Further technical work undertaken while the vessel was in dock included the fitting of a new more environmentally friendly reverse osmosis water maker and a new digital-control propulsion system.\n\nDuring Pacific Pearl’s stay in Singapore, much of the existing interior was ripped out and replaced, and one of the key contractors in this respect was Mivan of Northern Ireland. The company’s scope of work included the speciality restaurant, Salt Grill – the creation of Australian celebrity chef, Luke Mangan – the Waterfront Restaurant, Choc Café, and the Connexions and Oasis Bars.\n\nThe Waterfront Restaurant was the largest area within Mivan’s remit, with the inclusion of a wine tasting area as its centrepiece. According to the company, “We overcame challenging logistics across multiple areas of the ship to deliver a first class product for the client team.”\n\nThe interior design concept generally follows the pattern set by other ships in the P&O Australia fleet, building on the brand identity that has been established to serve the Australasian market, and which has been developed by SMC Design. All parts of the 11 passenger decks were given a complete overhaul, with new carpets and soft furnishings throughout, while the three-storey atrium was completely refitted and turned into an area combining various entertainment facilities, cafés, bars and retail units as well as a hotel style reception area for guests.\n\nOne area of the vessel that has undergone a particular transformation is the Dome lounge, which offers striking 270 degree ocean views. On Ocean Village, this part of a ship was something of a mix, housing the gym and a disco as well as a lounge. On Pacific Pearl, new carpeting, furniture and the use of timber materials have combined to create a friendlier, warmer environment. Pacific Pearl also boasts a new look theatre and casino area, and an Aqua HealthSpa Fitness centre.\n\nOutside on deck some important changes have been made, including the fitting of a new 7m wide, 4m high big screen – a first for P&O – as part of a total revamp of the poolside areas which also included the installation of new tiling and decking, and the addition of a ‘swim-up’ bar. The necessary equipment was also installed for a regular aerial circus display on deck.\n\nOverhaul of the ship’s cabins included the fitting of 900 flat panel TVs and local power sockets as well as higher quality bed linen, duvets and cushions, and WiFi accessibility. Extra berths have also been added to create more family-friendly cabins.\n\nOverall, more than 17,000 litres of paint were used to coat the ship’s interior and repaint its exterior, while 9,000m2 of new carpet and 3,000m2 of teak decking was laid. Extensive electrical upgrade work, including installing around 600 CCTV cameras and increasing the satellite bandwidth to allow passengers to access the Internet more effectively, required the installation of 30km of cabling.\n\nA team of 1,800 from around the world worked on the Pacific Pearl upgrade, which took a total of around 700,000 man hours to complete. After leaving Singapore, Pacific Pearl sailed to Auckland where it was re-launched on 21 December prior to embarking on its maiden cruise. This the first cruise ship of this size to be based in New Zealand.\n\nPacific Pearl: facts\n\nPacific Pearl was originally built as Sitmar Fair Majesty by Chantiers de l’Atlantique in 1988, before being purchased by P&O for Princess Cruises, being renamed Star Princess in 1989. Then in 1997 Star Princess was transferred to P&O Cruises and once again renamed as Arcadia, before becoming Ocean Village, when a brand of the same name was established by the Carnival group in 2003."
