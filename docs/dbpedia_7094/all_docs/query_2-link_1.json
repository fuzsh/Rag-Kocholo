Follow the wonderful career of these two ships after the newly formed Sitmar Cruises completely rebuilt and transformed them into sleek, elegant and luxurious 5 Star cruise ships in 1971 and 1972.\n\nYou will discover their remarkable history as well as the beginning of this new cruise company - “Sitmar Cruises” even though it is a company that has a long and a well-established history, having operated many ships and passenger liners as “Sitmar Lines.”\n\nIn this feature, I will also make mention of, complete with images, the greatly loved TSS Fairstar, ex HMTS Oxfordshire, as well as the 1984 built 46,000-ton SS Fairsky, which was the world’s very last steam passenger ship, as well as the 60,000-ton grand vision of the company owner Mr. Boris Vlasov, the M/V Sitmar FairMajesty of 1987/88, but in July 1988 P&O purchased Sitmar outright and Sitmar as we knew it, was no more!\n\nThis multi page feature offers some of the most amazing images and there are some that have not been seen for some forty-three years as they have been hidden and long forgotten!\n\nPlease click the main Image above (a Sitmar Cruises original poster) to enter the TSS Fairsea & Fairwind multi page feature!\n\nReuben Goossens.\n\nMaritime Historian.\n\nCommenced in the Passenger Shipping Industry in 1960.\n\nBrisbane, Australia.\n\n****************************************\n\nReturn to thessMaritime Main INDEX\n\nssMaritime.com & ssMaritime.net\n\nWhere the ships of the past make history & the 1914 built MV Doulos Story\n\nPlease Note: ssmaritime and associated sites are 100% non-commercial and the author seeks no funding or favours of any shape or form, never have and never will!\n\nPhotographs on ssmaritime and associate pages are by the author or from the author’s private collection.
