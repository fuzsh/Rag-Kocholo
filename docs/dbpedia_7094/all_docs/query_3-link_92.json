He is also an innovator who has set in train several projects that are helping transform the attitudes! of students and adults to learning. For example, he decided that parents might like to take classes at the school during the day, so he invited them to join his year 10 woodwork class .\n\nAlmost immediately, the mother of one of -his students came along with her sister. \"The women' called me ken'; the students called me slr'; Steven (the student) called the women 'mum' and 'aunty'; the other kids called them 'Bev and Shtai' and away we went,\" Mr Mann said. According to he of Mr Mann's colleagues, the scheme was an instant success. \"It was common to see secondary students helping the adults when Ken was other-. wise engaged, and the rapport that developed between students and adults was valuable to all concerned,\" he said .\n\nAnother of Ken Mann's ideas was to integrate a group of mentally handicapped teenagers into the Mount Clear programme.

They dress in 'the school uniform and travel hide-' pendently on the school bus system. Last year, too, Ken Mann devised a \"school experience-based curriculum\" to cater for students I who would not otherwise have returned school. By tailoring Midi md SYDNEY .\n\nAustralian pilots yesterday joined the campaign to have smoking banned on all parts of commercial aircraft including the flight deck. Captain Gary Reinke, a vice-president of the Pilots' Federation, said air-conditioning and pressur-isation machinery had failed or required increased servicing because it became clogged with nicotine tar. \"Most flight decks of airline and commuter aircraft have minimal air flow for pilot ventilation.\" Captain Reinke said. \"Any addition of smoke and soot increases the atmospheric density.\" Captain Reinke wants the ban to apply to flight crew as well as passengers. At present, crew are still allowed to puff away, although it is rarely done, according to the federation .\n\nThere is a growing number of voices now calling on the airlines to change their smoking policies. The Australian Medical Association recently appealed to Ansett and TAA to ban smoking and another group demonstrated at Sydney airport on the issue. But, the airlines show no sign of responding. When asked his reaction to the pilots' call, an Ansett spokesman, Mr Tony Hill, offered a polite \"no The TAA spokesman, Mr Mike Sutherland, said the airline's smoking policy was \"constantly under review and adjusted to the neeeds of each flight.\" a special programme to each student's needs, a group of students described as \"dejected and rejected\" were transformed into \"socially adept, optimistic young people, infinitely more aware of life's real For his work in helping change the nature and structure of schooling, Mr Mann has been nominated as 'the representative for the Central Highiands-Wim-mera region in the Teacher of the Year award.
