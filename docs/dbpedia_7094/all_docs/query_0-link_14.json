        "text": "Los Angeles may have The Oscars, but only Sydney has The CLIA’s. The who’s who of cruise gathered at The Star Event Centre for the industry’s night of nights on Saturday.\n\nThe 17th Annual Cruise Industry Awards or, as they’re affectionately known, “The CLIA’s”, saw nineteen awards presented across nine different categories catering to both Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWith new-to-the-market Norwegian Cruise Line enlisted as the Entertainment Sponsor, guests were privy to an exclusive performance by the cast of Burn The Floor, who were flown in especially from the Norwegian Jewel where they are currently performing aboard her repositioning cruise to Singapore.\n\nWeaving through the audience before breaking into a medley of toe-tapping hits to open the gala event, the cast returned as the feature entertainment later in the evening to wow guests with breathtaking choreography and glorious harmonies.\n\nMC for The CLIAs, Channel 7’s Natalie Barr, even tried a couple of shuffle hop steps in her intro for good measure, before leading the proceedings that highlighted the continual growth and innovation of the industry.\n\nIn a first for The CLIAs, New Zealand proved their might with nearly half of the submissions for those award categories open to nomination, coming from agents and agencies across the ditch.\n\nAll remaining categories were voted for by CLIA cruise lines each of whom carried the same voting weight to ensure fairness across the board.\n\nGuests were invited to get creative on Instagram, with headline sponsors Emirates and Dubai giving away a phenomenally luxe trip to Dubai worth $30,000. Guests also dug deep to support CLIA Charity Partner Mercy Ships’ work around the globe bringing free, world-class health care services to more than 70 countries.\n\nAmong the honourees at the awards was a true pioneer of cruising who was inducted into the CLIA Australasia Hall of Fame.\n\nTed Blamey, a Harvard alumn, has been in the industry for over 30 years with roles including Global President and CEO of Sitmar Cruises, CEO of Ansett Retail/Traveland and Chairman of the Sydney Ports Authority among many others. He was also instrumental in founding luxury cruise line Silversea Cruises.\n\nIn addition to recognising his fellow Australian cruise industry pioneers, many of whom were in attendance, he shared some sage advice.\n\n“Surround yourself with good people”.\n\nTed Blamey\n\nThe official proceedings were followed by an after party that saw guests party into the wee hours with a dessert buffet, more beverages and tunes courtesy of Traveltek.\n\nThe list of winners for The CLIAs 2018 were:\n\nNetwork Promotion of the Year, Australasia\n\nPhil Hoffman Travel – “Mega Cruise Sales Day”\n\nOutstanding Plan A Cruise Month Promotion\n\nMTA – Mobile Travel Agents – “Plan A Cruise Month”\n\nAgency Promotion of the Year, Australia\n\nClean Cruising – “Princess Cruises 2019 World Cruise”\n\nRising Star New Zealand\n\nSimon Matthews, Cruiseabout New Plymouth\n\nRising Star Australia\n\nKye Duffy, Our Vacation Centre\n\nBroker of the Year, New Zealand\n\nDenise Fowler, The Travel Brokers\n\nHome Based/Mobile Agent of the Year, Australia\n\nSarah Fenton, MTA – Mobile Travel Agents\n\nOnline Agency of the Year, New Zealand\n\nCruise Sale Finder New Zealand\n\nOnline Agency of the Year, Australia\n\nClean Cruising\n\nCruise Consultant of the Year, New Zealand\n\nMark Smith, Let’s Cruise\n\nCruise Consultant of the Year, Australia\n\nKathy Pavlidis, Cruiseabout Kew\n\nCruise Agency of the Year, New Zealand\n\nGold Winner – Bon Voyage Cruises & Travel\n\nSilver Winner – House of Travel Orewa\n\nBronze Winner – Pukekohe Travel\n\nCruise Agency of the Year, Australia\n\nGold Winner – Bicton Travel\n\nSilver Winner – Cruiseabout Kew\n\nBronze Winner – Phil Hoffman Travel\n\nREAD: The world’s first zero-emissions cruise ship is in the works\n\nREAD: U GET THE ROSE: U by Uniworld’s new bachie cruise\n\nDid you make the CLIAs on Saturday night?
