        "text": "Uniform Buttons\n\nP & O\n\nThis button often fools people (including myself). They assume the ‘rising sun’ above the anchor makes this an Australian Naval button.\n\nIn 1840 two shipping lines merged to form the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company under Royal Charter, (the peninsular in question being the Iberian Peninsular). They extended into leisure cruising in 1844. They entered the opium trade 1847 after the start of the Opium War. The first packet (i.e. carrying “packets” of mail) ship sailed to Australia in 1852, and the first passenger (primarily for passengers but also with cargo capacity) ship in 1932.\n\nStarting in 1969, there was a splitting of the P & O business into container and cruising operations. The leisure cruising subsidiary became P & O Cruises in 1977. The Australian operations were served by P & O Cruises Australia after the takeover of Sitmar Cruises for this purpose in 1988, which was divested in 2000 as P&O Princess Cruises and is now part of the Carnival Australia group. Due to divestments and takeovers, other parts of P & O became defunct as of 7th March 2006.\n\nhttp://www.pandosnco.co.uk/uniforms.html"
