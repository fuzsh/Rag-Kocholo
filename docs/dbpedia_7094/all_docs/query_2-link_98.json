The industry, which in the last 10 years has seen a doubling in demand for cruises, hopes to attract a share of the 95 percent of Americans who have never been on a cruise ship, but the changes have benefited current passengers as competition to fill the oversupply of cabins has kept fares down.\n\nBig is the operative word for most of the new arrivals. Royal Caribbean Cruise Line introduced the 74,000-ton, 2,282-passenger Sovereign of the Seas, by weight the largest cruise ship built so far, and the company has ordered two more ships of similar size.\n\nCarnival Cruises anticipates the arrival on Dec. 11 of the first of three larger ships for its fleet. The 2,600-passenger, 70,000-ton Fantasy, nearing completion in Finland, will make three- and four-night cruises to the Bahamas and is to be followed by two sister ships.\n\nCarnival purchased Holland America Line, adding such familiar ships as the Rotterdam, Noordam, Nieuw Amsterdam and the Westerdam to its complement. Following her season in Alaska, the Westerdam heads for a West German drydock, where the 42,092-ton, 670-foot ship will be made even larger. A 120-foot extension to her midsection will increase her weight to 52,000 tons and her capacity to 1,500 passengers. The Carnival purchase included Westours, a subsidiary, and three sail-assisted ships, which Holland America acquired from Windstar Sail Cruises. All three entities are to continue operating under separate names, and two more ships in the 60,000-ton range, each carrying 2,114 passengers, have been ordered.\n\nPrincess Cruises, which has acquired Sitmar Cruises, is awaiting delivery of the 62,000-ton, 1,470-passenger Star Princess, previously ordered by Sitmar as the FairMajesty. She makes her inaugural appearance in Fort Lauderdale on March 24.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
