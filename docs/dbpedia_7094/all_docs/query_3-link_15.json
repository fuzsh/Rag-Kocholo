        "text": "By Vicky Mayer | 17 Jul 2024\n\nLuxury five-star cruise line Crystal has announced the launch of two new ships\n\nAcclaimed cruise line Crystal has signed a deal with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to construct two ships. The first ship is set to be delivered in spring 2028 with the second ship to be announced at a later date. The line has also secured the option to build a third sister ship with delivery in 2032.\n\nWhat’s on board\n\nEach as-yet-unamed ship will host 690 guests and feature a promenade throughout their perimeter. This is similar to those on existing ships Crystal Serenity and Crystal Symphony. The new ships will feature all-suite cabins with private verandas including a single occupancy category, with veranda, designed for solo travellers. Look out too for the swanky deck-top pool too.\n\nFood for thought\n\nLike their sister ships, the new vessels will also feature Umi Uma, the only Nobu at sea, as well as the popular Beefbar.\n\nManfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, executive chairman of parent company A&K Travel Group, said: “This order is another milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family. This started with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea and now is flourishing again with Crystal.”\n\nCristina Levis, chief executive of A&K Travel Group, added: “Our aim is to continue setting a new standard in cruising. We aim to offer our guests an unmatched level of service and sophistication.”\n\nRead More"
