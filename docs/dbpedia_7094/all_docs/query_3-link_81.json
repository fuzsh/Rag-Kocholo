        "text": "Princess Cruises have just announced the name of their fourth Royal-class ship, the brand new ship will be called Sky Princess.\n\nThe forthcoming ship is scheduled to launch in October 2019, with a serious of Mediterranean cruises and will become the sister ship of Royal Princess, Regal Princess & Majestic Princess; the other three ships in her class.\n\nSimilarly to her sister ships, Sky Princess will hold 3,660 passengers. The vessel will include a number of signature elements that feature on Royal-class, such as:\n\n-A three-deck central Piazza-style atrium\n\n-Multiple dining, entertainment and retail venues\n\n-A top-deck outdoor “Movie Under the Stars” theatre\n\n-80% of all staterooms with balconies\n\n-The adults-only Sanctuary\n\n-Camp Discovery youth and teen centres\n\n-Dining venues including the Salty Dog Grill, Alfredo’s Pizzeria, Vines Wine Bar, Chef’s Table Lumiere and World Fresh Marketplace\n\nDetails of more new features & innovations onboard Sky Princess will be released soon.\n\nPrincess Cruises and Carnival Australia group president, Jan Swartz, said “Sky Princess continues a Princess Cruises legacy and honours one of our previous ships. When Princess merged with Sitmar Cruises in 1988, Sky Princess joined our fleet and sailed with us for 12 years. Now more than 30 years later, a new Sky Princess will join the fleet featuring our modern design platform and contemporary innovations, offered to exceed our guests’ expectations.”\n\nSky Princess’ maiden voyage will be a 7 day Mediterranean cruise from Athens to Barcelona on the 20th October 2019. This voyage will be followed by a 7-day cruise from Barcelona to Rome, which can be combined to form a 14 day Western Mediterranean & Adriatic Medley.\n\nSky Princess’ Mediterranean voyages will feature 10 departures on eight itineraries, sailing from Barcelona, Rome or Athens. These will be available to book from December 14th, 2017. Princess guests with Elite status will have the opportunity to secure their booking on December 13th, 2017.\n\nThe season will end in November 2018 with a 14 day Spanish Passage cruise from Barcelona to Fort Lauderdale, USA, which can again be combined with previous Mediterranean cruises to form 21 or 28-day sailings.\n\nPrincess has also confirmed a fifth Royal-class ship is under construction, similar to the other vessels in the class, which will launch in 2020.\n\n// END - About the Author ?>"
