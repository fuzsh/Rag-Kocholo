        "text": "In great news for Crystal fans, the ultra-luxury cruise line has ordered two new ships from Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri. The first will set sail in 2028!\n\nIt’s the latest action by new owner A&K Group (co-chaired by Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio and Geoffrey Kent) to keep the Crystal brand moving forward and elevate the experience in new, opulent ways.\n\nLast week, Crystal and Fincantieri signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to build two 690-passenger, 61,800-gross-ton ships. Crystal’s loyal past guests and new ones too will enjoy a host of amenities and innovative design features. (The photo above shows the exterior design. Photo by Crystal.)\n\nThe goal, says Crystal, is to deliver unparalleled comfort and indulgence. The announcement comes two years after A&K Travel Group acquired Crystal in 2022, marking a new chapter for the cruise line.\n\nTwo New Ships: Design Tidbits\n\nWho’s involved design-wise? Leading the design efforts are Studio Ibsen led by professor and architect Adriana Granato and Studio Gem headed by naval architect Giacomo Mortola and naval engineer Lorenzo Mortola. A&K Group has yet to appoint a third international design firm, but that’s planned.\n\nWhile work has just begun, look for the interior design to incorporate opulent marble, Italian fabrics and many natural materials. Crystal is seeking to create a sophisticated look that one might find in the most luxurious, high-end, private residential properties.\n\nTwo New Ships: A Standout Feature\n\nWhat’s snazzy about the two new Crystal ships? “One standout feature is expected to be the promenade that extends through each ship’s entire perimeter,” according to Shelby Steudle, president, Pavlus Travel.\n\n“We know that’s something beloved by our clients who sail on Crystal’s two existing ships, the 606-passenger Crystal Symphony and the 740-passenger Crystal Serenity,” says Steudle. After all, “there’s nothing better than to enjoy a leisurely stroll and enjoy stunning ocean views or glimpses of destinations on the horizon.”\n\nSeparately, culinary enthusiasts can indulge their palate with a variety of dining options. Yes, the line plans to offer the popular Umi Uma, the only Nobu restaurant at sea. In addition, cruisers will also find the recently announced Beefbar aboard both new ships.\n\nCrystal says it also will provide exclusive entertainment options as well as a Casino de Monte Carlo on both new ships. See our recent blog about that exciting casino announcement.\n\nFor gaming enthusiasts, it’s great to know that slot machines, roulette, poker and blackjack will return to Crystal’s ships later this year.\n\nNew Ships: Wellness, Families, Suites\n\nWellness and relaxation will be at the heart of the two new ships. Guests will find a comprehensive spa and state-of-the-art fitness center.\n\nAnother perk? Guests traveling with children will discover a dedicated spot for child-friendly activities and a safe space for the youngest travelers.\n\nSuite Spaces\n\nAs for the best “digs” aboard, guests likely can’t go wrong with any of them. That’s because Crystal tells The Meandering Traveler that the two new ships will offer “all-suite” accommodations with private verandas.\n\nIn addition, solo travelers will appreciate that the new ships will offer a single occupancy category suite with veranda.\n\nTwo New Ships: Crystal’s Perspective\n\n“This order is another milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family that started with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea and now is flourishing again with Crystal,” says Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, executive chairman of A&K Travel Group.\n\nMany Pavlus Travel customers remember Lefebvre d’Ovidio from his previous role as the executive chairman and former owner of Silversea Cruises. He’s now brought his skill set and knowledge in ultra-luxury cruising to Crystal and the results show.\n\nTwo New Ships: Option for a Third\n\nWhen can travelers expect to see the new ships? Look for the first ship to be delivered in spring 2028. As for the second ship, its construction and delivery timeline will be announced at a later date.\n\nUnder A&K Travel Group’s leadership, Crystal is focusing on enhancing its offerings both at sea and on shore and expanding its fleet. For example, the luxury line also secured one order option with Fincantieri.\n\nThen if that option is subsequently “exercised” by A&K Group, that third ship would arrive in 2032.\n\nOne factor is crystal clear. Based on recent developments, ultra-luxury Crystal is “making waves.”\n\nSo, for details about Crystal cruise itineraries throughout the world, visit this official website page.
