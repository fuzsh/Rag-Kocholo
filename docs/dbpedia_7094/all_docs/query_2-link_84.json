        "text": "THE IMMIGRANT SHIPS\n\nIn the heady years of the 20th century, millions sought better lives for themselves and their families in countries far-off from Europe. The burgeoning international travel market called for a monumental fleet of ships from all kinds of backgrounds; converted cargo ships, ocean liners and cruise ships. All of these carried countless hopeful families to new beginning from Australia to America and Canada; today they are fondly remembered.\n\nM/s Aurelia\n\nOriginally serving as a German cargo vessel during the Second World War, Aurelia was rebuilt by Italy’s COGEDAR line and served as a reliable immigrant liner between Europe and Australia.\n\nM/N Australia\n\nAustralia was the first of three sisters ships commissioned and built to capitalise on the growing post-war migrant trade to Australia for Italy’s Lloyd Triestino line. These virtually identical sisters were the first ships built post-war for the Italian line and were a remarkable step forward in modernising the fleet.\n\nSS AUSTRALIS\n\nSS Australis - formerly the SS America - is a ship with a legendary career and one fondly remembered by thousands. Over her extraordinary fifty-year-long career she served as an ocean liner, troop transport and cruise ship.\n\nSS Begoña\n\nOriginally ‘SS Vassar Victory’, a cargo vessel serving through World War Two (and later serving as Sitmar Lines’ ‘SS Castel Bianco’), Begoña earned a name for herself in peacetime after an important voyage to Australia from Greece in 1957 - bringing a shipload of brides to the country.\n\nSS Begoña’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nSS BRITANIS\n\nBritanis started life at Matson Lines’ ‘Monterey’, and Chandris added her to their fleet well after her sister Ellinis. Britanis began her career for Chandris on the immigrant run before converting to full-time cruise duties well into the 1990s.\n\nss cephée\n\nCephée began life as a German combination vessel carrying both cargo and passengers before being awarded to France’s Messageries Maritimes line as war reparations after 1918. She served in this configuration as an immigrant vessel carrying many families fleeing the beleaguered European continent to Australia in the 1920s.\n\nss cephée’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nrhms ellinis\n\nThe former Matson Lines vessel ‘Lurline’ was purchased and converted to serve the immigrant run to Australia. With a white hull and blue ribbon, this is how Ellinis looked when she first went to work for Chandris.\n\nt/n GALILEO GALILEI\n\nGalileo Galilei, along with her sister Guglielmo Marconi, was like a space-age leap for Lloyd-Triestino when the pair were introduced in the mid-1960s. Initially operating the Italy-Australia run, the two sister ships had long careers and, like so many others, became popular cruise ships in the later part of the century.\n\nt/n guglielmo marconi\n\nThe second of two famous and stylish sister ships, Marconi served only a relatively short 15-year career with Lloyd Triestino before begin sold and converted to full-time cruise ship with Costa Cruises. Renamed ‘Costa Riviera’, she was finally laid-up and scrapped in 2001.\n\nT/N GUGLIELMO MARCONI’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nSS GROOTE BEER\n\nGroote Beer began life as the US Victory ship 'Costa Rica Victory' before being purchased by the Dutch Government after the Second World War. She was rebuilt and employed as a very successful and beloved immigrant ship, carrying passengers to new and better lives from Europe to Australia and America.\n\nSS GROOTE BEER’S PAGe is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nrms mooltan\n\nMooltan and her sister Maloja were constructed just after the First World War and went on to capitalise on the growing ‘Tourist’ market of the 20s and 30s. The vessels made frequent voyages between Australia and Britain after serving as troopships in the Second World War, taking part in the ‘Ten-Pound Pom’ scheme in the 1950s.\n\nm/n neptunia\n\n‘Neptunia’ was one of three sisters ships commissioned and built to capitalise on the growing post-war migrant trade to Australia for Italy’s Lloyd Triestino line. These virtually identical sisters were the first ships built post-war for the Italian line and were a remarkable step forward in modernising the fleet.\n\nm/n neptunia’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nMS NELLY\n\nNelly was originally a C3 cargo vessel ‘Mormacmail’ before conversion to an aircraft carrier for the United States Navy in World War Two. As ‘Nelly’ the ship operated regular services from Europe to Australia and brought many migrant families - she was the first vessel to carry German migrants to Australia. She was eventually renamed ‘Seven Seas’ and served as a popular cruise ship.\n\nMS NELLY’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nSS NEW AUSTRALIA\n\nThis vessel was originally launched as the ‘Monarch of Bermuda’ and was a popular liner to that nation until she was gutted by a fire. The hulk was purhcased and rebuilt into the ‘New Australia’, operated by the Shaw-Savill Line until the late 1950s, playing a major role in the ‘Ten Pound Pom’ scheme. After this she was sold to the Greek line and renamed ‘Arkadia’.\n\nSS NEW AUSTRALIA’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nMS Oceania\n\n‘Oceania’ was one of three sisters ships commissioned and built to capitalise on the growing post-war migrant trade to Australia for Italy’s Lloyd Triestino line. These virtually identical sisters were the first ships built post-war for the Italian line and were a remarkable step forward in modernising the fleet.\n\nMS OCEANIA’S page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nRMS PRETORIA CASTLE\n\nPretoria Castle was one of Union Castle Lines’ sleek vessels operating regular services between Britain and South Africa. She was built by the famed shipyard Harland and Wolff in 1947 and had a 19-year long career with her original owners.\n\nRMS PRETORIA CASTLE’s page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nSS Strathaird\n\nStrathaird was one of the first two original ‘White Sisters’ along with Strathnaver. The vessel had a successful career spanning decades, being a popular liner and cruise ship in the 1930s before serving in the War as a troopship. Post-war she was modernised and resumed services between Australia and Britain.\n\nSS STRATHAIRD’S page is coming soon but prints are now available\n\nSS Stratheden\n\nCirca 1959\n\nOne of P&O’s most successful immigrant liners of the 50s and 60s, Stratheden was the largest of her running mates at the time.\n\ntSS STRATHNAVER\n\nStrathnaver was one of the first two original ‘White Sisters’ along with Strathaird. The vessel had a successful career spanning decades, being a popular liner and cruise ship in the 1930s before serving in the War as a troopship. Post-war she was modernised and resumed services between Australia and Britain.\n\ntsmv wanganella\n\nThe plucky little liner's pedigree was superb; she had been launched as 'Achimota' at Harland and Wolff, Belfast, in 1932 for Elder Dempster line but the company ran into post-crash financial troubles and could not take ownership. So it was that Melbourne-based Huddart Parker bought her and renamed her Wanganella.\n\ntsmv wanganella’s page is coming soon but prints are now available"
