        "text": "No sibling rivalry exists at Princess Cruises! Sun Princess eagerly anticipates the arrival of her new sister ship, Star Princess, to join the fleet as the third vessel adorned with this celestial name. As a Sphere-Class ship, Star Princess will boast remarkable features including the new Dome, offering unparalleled views in the Piazza, indulgent Signature Collection Suites, and many more enticing offerings. Seize the opportunity to be among the first to embark on the maiden voyage of Star Princess during her inaugural 2025 season in the Mediterranean and revel in all the extraordinary experiences she has to offer.\n\nSet to embark on its inaugural season of Mediterranean voyages in August 2025, Star Princess is currently being constructed at the Fincantieri shipyard in Italy. With a weight of 175,500 tonnes and a capacity to accommodate 4,300 guests, it joins Sun Princess as the largest ships ever built for Princess Cruises.\n\nStar Princess embodies Princess’ unique design, blending the brand’s heritage with a celebration of the sea’s enchantment, offering breathtaking outward views. Despite being 20 percent larger than any of the existing ships, Star Princess maintains the intimate ambiance that Princess is renowned for. The ship introduces several groundbreaking spaces, including The Dome, an innovative entertainment venue inspired by the terraces of Santorini, and a spectacular glass sphere adorning the elevated Piazza. The ship also features the extraordinary Princess Arena, a technologically advanced main theatre capable of hosting various innovative entertainment concepts, as well as a magnificent dining room located at the rear of the ship, offering unforgettable views of the wake.\n\nIn addition to these remarkable spaces, Star Princess boasts an array of spectacular features. Guests can indulge in an exciting array of new food and beverage concepts, explore the expanded casino, pamper themselves at the two-story Lotus Spa, and enjoy mesmerising entertainment headlined by Cirque Éloize. The accommodations have also been enhanced, offering luxurious staterooms and suites, including the new Reserve and Signature Collections.\n\nStar Princess also features the exclusive Princess Medallion service, which further solidifies Princess’ commitment to providing exceptional personalised experiences. As the second ship in the Princess fleet to be powered by LNG fuel technology, Star Princess also incorporates advanced sustainable innovations.\n\nOn August 4, 2025, Star Princess will set sail on its debut voyage – a remarkable nine-day roundtrip journey from Rome (Civitavecchia) exploring Italy and Greece. The itinerary includes captivating destinations such as Corfu, Kotor, Mykonos, Santorini, and Naples (for Capri and Pompeii). Following this inaugural voyage, Star Princess will offer a variety of 9- and 10-day cruises departing from Rome, Athens, or Trieste (Venice), featuring idyllic coastal ports. Bookings for Star Princess cruises will be available for sale alongside the larger Europe 2025 program starting from June 1, 2023.\n\nJohn Padgett, President of Princess Cruises, expressed admiration for Star Princess, emphasising its sleek and captivating design, spacious interiors, and its ability to provide remarkable views of the sea and sky, akin to the features that made Sun Princess inaugural bookings highly sought after. Padgett added that the ships were meticulously designed to provide guests with a sense of familiarity while offering a host of exceptional new experiences to discover and enjoy.\n\nPrincess’ first Star Princess ship, originally known as Sitmar Fair Majesty, was launched in 1988. Following the merger of Sitmar Cruises into Princess, it was renamed Star Princess in 1989 and christened by the legendary actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn. The second Star Princess was introduced in 2002 as the third Grand Class vessel, playing a pivotal role in the brand’s evolution by introducing popular offerings such as Anytime Dining, the industry’s first dining program that granted guests the freedom to dine whenever, wherever, and with whomever they desired."
