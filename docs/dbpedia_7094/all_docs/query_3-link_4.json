        "text": "Fincantieri and Crystal today announced the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for the construction of two state-of-the-art high-end cruise ships, plus an option for a third unit. The value of this agreement, subject to financing and other terms and conditions, is considered as important[1].\n\nThe new units will boast a gross tonnage of 61,800 tons and accommodate approximately 690 passengers. Developed by renowned international architectural firms, their interior designs will use the finest materials and the best craftsmanship. They will feature all-suite accommodations, with private verandas including a popular single occupancy category designed for single travelers. This commitment to comfort is complemented by one of the highest crew-to-passenger ratios in this segment, ensuring personalized service and attention to detail.\n\nThe delivery of the first vessel is scheduled in spring 2028, while further details regarding the second ship will be disclosed in due course.\n\nPierroberto Folgiero, CEO and Managing Director of Fincantieri, commented: “This order not only highlights the robust recovery of the cruise sector, in line with our Industrial Plan, but also reaffirms Fincantieri’s leadership, thanks to the operational excellence of our shipyards and the execution quality of our world-class supply chain. We are thrilled to partner with Crystal in our pursuit of innovation and excellence, under the guidance of a shipowner who has always been close to our Group, like Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio.\"\n\nManfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, Executive Chairman of A&K Travel Group said: “This order is another milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family that started with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea and now is flourishing again with Crystal. Our aim is to continue setting a new standard in cruising, offering our guests an unmatched level of service and sophistication.”"
