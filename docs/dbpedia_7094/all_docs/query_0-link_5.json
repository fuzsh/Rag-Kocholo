        "text": "CLIA in Australasia proudly sponsored and participated in the New Zealand Cruise Association Conference in Auckland this week. It was an opportunity for CLIA to highlight the strong global outlook and share exciting sentiment statistics specific to New Zealand. Among Kiwis who have cruised before, 81% plan to cruise again, with even higher enthusiasm among younger generations‚Äî86% of Millennial cruisers and 87% of Gen Z cruisers intend to return to the seas. Additionally, 74% of New Zealanders who have never cruised are open to trying it, a sentiment that outpaces international averages. However, New Zealand faces challenges with high costs and regulatory issues that need to be addressed. By coming together‚Äîgovernment, ports, destinations, and communities alike‚Äîwe can send a clear signal that New Zealand is open for business. If we unite, we can overcome these challenges and fully share in the global growth that cruising offers. Congratulations to Jacqui and the NZCA board for a successful conference and for kicking off the cruise conference season down under. #wearecruise Debbie Summers Tansy Tompkins\n\nCLIA Australasia Chair, Peter Little joined CLIA Cruise Line execs, Dave Humphreys, Lisa Teiotu, and Adam Radwanski, as well as ACA‚Äôs Jill Abel, on a panel at the recent Travel24 event in Sydney, to discuss what‚Äôs ahead for cruising over the next 24 months. In addition to highlighting the exciting opportunities ahead for cruising globally and in our region, Travel24 was also an opportunity to focus on some of the challenges facing our sector, and reinforce that cruise operations are often planned and booked several years in advance, and therefore it is critical that government work closely with industry to create an environment that delivers long-term regulatory certainty for cruising in this region. In our region, the cruise industry is worth more than $5.6 billion a year to communities around the coast, and cruise ships made almost 1,400 port calls around Australia in 2022-23, creating an economic impact that supports more than 18,000 Australian jobs. #wearecruise\n\nEden is already one of Australia‚Äôs great success stories when it comes to fostering cruise tourism, and the latest improvements announced by the NSW Government will allow this region to thrive into the future. These latest measures highlight the importance of taking a collaborative, long-term approach to developing cruise tourism. They are a sign of the success Eden has enjoyed through having close partnerships between the local community, local businesses, government, port operators and cruise lines. Cruise tourism generates more than $5.6 billion a year for the Australian economy and reaches many regional destinations and remote communities around our coasts. With careful planning and strategic investment in the future, we have the opportunity to deliver long-term benefits in ways that suit local communities and enhance their tourism economy. Announcing the expansion, NSW Transport Minister Jo Haylen said, ‚ÄúEden is already our state‚Äôs largest regional cruise port ‚Äì and we‚Äôre making it even better, lifting the cap on visits and increasing NSW‚Äôs already booming market share of Australia‚Äôs cruising industry. Investing in our regional ports is a no-brainer. We want people from all over the world to experience everything our stunning state has to offer and ensure we all reap the economic rewards.‚Äù Local Member for Bega Dr Michael Holland MP welcomed the news, ‚ÄúCruise visitors bring a new energy to the local community, and locals ‚Äì particularly our hard-working businesses ‚Äì love seeing passengers step onto our shores. We‚Äôre pleased to grow our capacity and maximise the number of people who can spend time in our region, which is unparallelled in its natural beauty, hospitality, tours and charm.‚Äù #WeAreCruise\n\nAsia is back as the world‚Äôs third largest source region for cruise passengers, behind the US and Western Europe. Cruise industry leaders are celebrating a powerful comeback in Asian markets as they gather for this week‚Äôs Asia Cruise Forum in Jeju, South Korea, has outlined the triple-digit growth shown in key countries across the region. In a state-of-the-industry address to the forum, I highlighted the remarkable resilience shown in Asian cruise markets, which grew by 195% in 2023. Key countries including Singapore, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam all recorded passenger levels above pre-pandemic levels, lifting the region‚Äôs overall total to more than 2.3 million passengers over the year. The Asia Cruise Forum is a crucial gathering for CLIA as it works to strengthen the collaborative efforts needed to drive growth in the Asian cruise market and internationally. The insights and partnerships formed during this forum are expected to contribute to the success and sustainability of the cruise industry in the region. It was also an opportunity to outline the strength of the cruise sector globally and the sustainability measures CLIA cruise lines are taking in pursuit of net-zero emissions by 2050.

Maria Deligianni stated: ‚ÄúSantorini is a beautiful location that is extremely popular, and we share the view expressed recently by Prime Minister Mitsotakis on the importance of responsible tourism management for the island. Mayor Zorzos has been clear with us from the beginning of this season about his intention to implement strictly the existing daily cap of 8.000 cruise visitors at 75% cruise capacity, and we are supportive of this position, recognizing the circumstances of Santorini. Whilst we believe that a holistic approach to address tourism flows is necessary, we are pleased to be the first to work with the Mayor of Santorini in this direction‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe are pleased that the Municipality of Thira discussed and agreed with CLIA the solutions for the sustainable operation of cruising in Santorini, aiming to protect the uniqueness of the destination, as well as the passenger experience.‚Äù | Nikolaos Zorzos, Mayor of Santorini. #CLIA recognises that cruise tourism management in Santorini is a top priority in Greece, as outlined in CLIA‚Äôs Action Plan for Greece launched last year. ü§ù Dialogue with ports and destinations is at the heart of #ResponsibleTourism. #wearecruise\n\nWelcoming Seabourn Pursuit to Darwin today, NT Minister for Tourism and Hospitality Joel Bowden, highlighted the positive impact of cruise tourism on the Territory's economy, delivering more visitors to the Top End who will tour the NT before and after their expedition, increasing demand and bookings for our hospitality, retail and accommodation sectors. ‚ÄúThis is a great outcome with cruise passengers here to dine in our cafes and restaurants, shop at local retailers and of course book tours. It‚Äôs also good news for local businesses that service the cruise sector\", Minister Bowden said. \"Darwin and the Top End of the NT has so much to offer whether its our authentic Aboriginal culture, military history or checking out our unique flora and fauna, the NT has something for everyone.\" This is a significant milestone for the Territory‚Äôs cruise industry with the addition of another ultraluxury expedition operator bringing high net worth passengers who will undertake pre and post cruise touring across the Territory. Turnaround passengers will also spend more in the NT given their extended stay and today‚Äôs arriving passengers will be a welcome boost for local tourism, retail and hospitality operators. A total of 103 cruise and expedition ships are expected to visit Darwin throughout the 2023-24 season, with a total passenger capacity of 60,000 people ‚Äì making it the Territory largest cruise ship season yet and injecting a massive $65 million into the economy, creating jobs and supporting local tour operators, retailers and the hospitality industry. #WeAreCruise Natalya Leahy Scott Lovett Samantha Palmer FIPAA Don Farrell Mikaela Wangmann Phillipa Harrison Dominic Mehling John Hart Joel Bowden Eva Lawler Peter Little Michael Mihajlov James Larsson MBA\n\nIn a historic ceremony honouring one of the oldest maritime traditions and symbolising deep respect, admiration, and enduring friendship with the Traditional Owners of the land, a bottle crafted from sugar and coated with sand from Ngula Jar Island was shattered against the bow of Seabourn Cruise Line‚Äôs Seabourn Pursuit this weekend. This remarkable event marked a significant milestone as the Wunambal Gaambera Traditional Owners named the ship, a first in maritime history. The day was a heartfelt celebration of Wunambal Gaambera Country and the Kimberley region, featuring a traditional welcome and smoking ceremony, ‚Äújim…®rri,‚Äù the ‚ÄúJunba‚Äù storytelling song and dance, and visits to ancient rock art sites. The naming ceremony, conducted in both Wunambal Gaambera language and English, included a blessing for all who will ever sail on board. Australia‚Äôs rich Indigenous culture is being celebrated in ways that provide extraordinary experiences for cruise visitors while at the same time creating opportunities for Traditional Owners. The Wunambal Gaambera partnership is a great example of how cruise tourism can be harnessed by remote communities around Australia‚Äôs coast. #wearecruise Peter Little Natalya Leahy James Larsson MBA Samantha Palmer FIPAA Phillipa Harrison Dominic Mehling Don Farrell Mikaela Wangmann Rita Saffioti MLA Roger Cook Rebecca Brown Stephanie Underwood Renata Lowe Jackie Crooks Philippa King Xavier Simonet"
