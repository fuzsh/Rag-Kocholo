        "text": "IT'S a steamy August day and hundreds of tourists swarm into the embarkation terminal at the port here. At least six gleaming white cruise ships are lined up, bow to stern, ready to leave. But the activity is most intense around one ship - Carnival Cruise Line's Jubilee, a sleek vessel draped with a banner proclaiming ''Carnival's Got the Fun!''\n\nThe passengers come from Queens, Des Moines, Detroit and Fresno and they have signed on for seven days of dining, drinking and dancing - a floating vacation. Carnival is the cruise line to the masses: the biggest, most profitable and fastest-growing line plying the Caribbean. With a lot of shrewd marketing and a little bit of luck, Carnival has shaken up the once-staid cruise ship industry and helped rewrite the rules for becoming successful at sea.\n\nIts success has also turned its founder, Ted Arison - a 64-year-old Israeli immigrant with a penchant for boom-and-bust ventures - and his three children into one of America's richest families. The Arisons, who live modestly in Miami, are less known than such celebrated American dynasties as the Tisches, the Marriotts and the Busches. But measured by the dollar value of their public holdings, the Arisons, with $1.5 billion worth of Carnival shares, are wealthier.\n\nBut the real question now facing the Arisons is how successful they - and Carnival Cruise - will be in maintaining, and increasing that wealth. Last year, the Arison family came into view when Carnival Cruise went public in an equity offering that raised nearly $400 million even as the family kept 80 percent control. Now Carnival is going on a spending spree and pumping money into a number of new ventures that will set the company's - and the family's - fate for decades to come.\n\n''We're at a crossroads,'' said Micky Arison, Ted's 39-year-old son and chief executive of Carnival Cruise. ''We've now got the ability to do so much because of the new capital. We've been cautious so far and there's no reason that should change. But we're interested in getting out there and doing things. Anything could happen.''\n\nCarnival made its mark by unabashedly promoting cruising for the common man with low-price air-and-sea packages, loads of shipboard activities and heavy national television advertising. In doing so, it has beaten its fancier rivals to become the cruise industry's biggest player.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
