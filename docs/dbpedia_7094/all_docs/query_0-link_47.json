More than 70 years later, P&O Cruises Australiaâ€™s fleet and itineraries have expanded considerably. The company now offers Australians the choice of three cruise ships sailing from Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Fremantle and Adelaide, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand to approximately 40 destinations in Australasia and the South Pacific.\n\nIn 2000, after various changes in the organisation of the P&O Group, the company de-merged all of its cruise ship operations. A new company was created, P&O Princess Cruises, which was independent of P&O and consisted of P&O Cruises, P&O Cruises Australia, Princess Cruises, AIDA Cruises and later A'Rosa Cruises and Ocean Village. Later in 2003, P&O Princess Cruises merged with Carnival Corporation to form Carnival Corporation & plc, the world's largest cruise company, with a portfolio of eleven cruise lines, including P&O Australia.\n\nIn 2008, Carnival Corporation & plc announced the closure of their United Kingdom-based Ocean Village brand. Coinciding with this closure, both Ocean Village ships were transferred to the fleet of P&O Cruises Australia. Ocean Village Two joined the P&O Australia fleet in December 2009 as Pacific Jewel. Ocean Village followed in late 2010 as \"Pacific Pearl\"\n\nIn December 2009, the Pacific Dawn was moved from Sydney to its new home port at Brisbane. This was done to allow the Pacific Jewel and after its acquisition the Pacific Pearl to be based in Sydney. The Pacific Sun was moved to Fremantle for part of the year to carry out Asia cruises prior to being sold in July 2019. In 2014, Carnival Corporation announced that the Statendam and Ryndam would be transferred from Holland America Line to the P&O Cruises Australia fleet in 2015 under the new names of Pacific Eden and Pacific Aria.\n\nCruise ships and itineraries:\n\nPacific Aria (formerly Holland America Line's Statendam, the ship joins P&O Cruises Australia in November 2015): UK registered, built 1993, 55,451 gross tons, 1,258 passengers, 557 crew members.\n\nItineraries: Australia; Vanuatu; Fiji; New Guinea, Pacific/South Pacific sailing out of Brisbane, Australia.
