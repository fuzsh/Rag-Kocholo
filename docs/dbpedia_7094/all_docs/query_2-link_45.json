        "text": "Passenger Capacity To Australia Tripled As CMA CGM Mozart and CMA CGM Rossini Join CMA CGM Bellini On London-Sydney Route\n\n04/04/2016\n\nThe only direct cargo-passenger service between Europe and Australia in recent months has been a single-ship service by the 10-passenger CMA CGM Bellini (above), but we now have good news for travellers to and from Australia. CMA CGM Bellini‘s sister ships CMA CGM Mozart and Rossini will now join this route, resulting in almost monthly sailings via Suez on CMA CGM’s North Europe Med Oceania (NEMO) Line. Port rotation is as follows:\n\nLondon Tilbury – Rotterdam – Hamburg – Le Havre – Fos sur Mer – Genoa – Damietta – Suez Canal – Pointe des Galets (Réunion) – Fremantle – Melbourne – Sydney – Adelaide – Singapore – Port Kelang – Chennai – Colombo – Cochin – Suez Canal – Damietta – Malta – Salerno – London Tilbury (91 day round trip).\n\nPassengers may also embark in the Mediterranean – Genoa to Sydney for example is 33 days compared to 44 days from London. The fastest transit is 25 days from Genoa to Fremantle. Fares are set at €110 per passenger per day in double or twin cabins, or €120/130 per day single.\n\nOn the return voyage the ships do not accept passengers between Port Kelang, Malaysia, and Damietta, Egypt, but passengers from Australia are able to transfer at Port Kelang to the French Asia Line 1 service, which offers a 22-day transit to Southampton, as opposed to 31 days to Tilbury on the NEMO route.\n\nPassenger sailings are scheduled by the CMA CGM Rossini, from London on April 7 and Genoa on April 19, by the CMA CGM Bellini, from London on May 5 and from Genoa on May 17, and by the CMA CGM Mozart, from London on May 19 and Genoa on May 31, with subsequent sailings for each ship every 13 weeks thereafter.\n\nService is also available on the MSC Australia route, but ships in this service are subject to last-minute withdrawals to be sent to other MSC routes. The section Australia to UK can be booked as a through voyage however. MSC rotation is:\n\nLondon Gateway – Antwerp – Le Havre – Fos sur Mer – La Spezia – Naples – Gioia Tauro – Suez Canal – Port Louis (Mauritius) – Pointe des Galets (Réunion) – Sydney – Melbourne – Adelaide – Fremantle – Singapore – Colombo – King Abdullah – Suez Canal – Valencia – London Gateway (91 day round trip)."
