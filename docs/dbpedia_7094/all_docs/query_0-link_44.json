Although the author has worked and been involved in the passenger shipping industry for well over 60 years, but due to his old age and poor health, he was forced to retire. Yet, he has completed well over 1,550 Classic Liners, Passenger-Cargo Liners as well as humble converted C3 converted Migrant Liners, which has transported countless thousands of folk to the new world, as well on vacations’. Amazingly; ssmaritime.com has received 7.57 billion visitors to date (Last update: January 24, 1922). I trust the features online will continue to provide Classic Liner and Ship enthusiasts both the information they are seeking, but more so provide a great deal of pleasure and relive many happy memories! Features online are 1 web-page to a huge 25 web-pages covering the life of a single ship.\n\nSite Index\n\nPlease Note: Email service to ssMaritime, is sadly no longer available, to the author’s old age and severe illness as well as being disabled, etc. So Sorry about this!\n\nMany new ships have been added over the recent years, thus I trust that you will enjoy the many maritime riches that are to be found on ssMaritime.com, and that you will return frequently! However, I as I have now retired and will not be adding anything new! Amazingly, I have on now written on well over 1,435 Classic Passenger Liners, Passenger-Cargo Liners, including a good number of humble Migrant ships, many of these being converted War-Time Victory Class ships, such as the type C3 & C4 Class Vessels. Some of these ships were rebuilt into rather humble Migrant Liners, whilst others became far more modern and even glamorous Migrant Liners, such as Flotta Lauro’s TSS Roma and Sydney, as well as Sitmar Lines TSS Fairsky, and these ships made significant inroads into maritime history. And it is my sincere hope, that through the pages of ssMaritime you may rediscover some wonderful memories, be it for past passengers and their relatives who may have sailed on these amazing ships, from days of old until their demise in the late 1970s to the 1990s. And not to forget the Classic Cruise Ships some of which are still sailing. But to the COVID-19 in recent times some of ships may now have been be sold to the breakers, unless buyers can be found for them. Sadly some good and much newer ships have been broken up already.\n\nShips listed below hail from countless countries from around the world, Britain, the Netherlands, France, USA, Germany, Scandinavia, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand and South America and so many other countries!\n\nI trust that you will enjoy reading and discovering the countless ships that I have online, for it has been a great joy bringing them all to you!\n\nBest wishes.\n\nDr. Reuben Goossens.\n\nMaritime Historian, Author, Lecturer & Cruise‘n’Ship Reviewer.\n\nCommenced in the Passenger Shipping & Cruise Industry in 1960.\n\nSite Index\n\nPlease Note: In a number of cases a ship may well have had various names during its lifetime and I may have, or in some cases - not have placed all these names on this index. Although I had been attempting to correct this, but sadly due to my illness, this has now halted and I will have missed some. Thus, should you happen to note a ship that has a missing link due to having another name and it is not listed, it may well be under its original name as built or under its most famous name, which may not be the one as built.\n\nLinks of special interest!\n\nSOLAS 2010 … Safety Of Life At Sea - Many have enquired regarding the new regulations that come in force in 2008 / 2010, will mean the decline of so many fine classic ships that are still with us today.

Yet, she and the Britannic tend to be the forgotten ships, which is due to the great tragedy that sadly befell the Titanic on April 14, 1912 that overshadowed both these two liners. However, sadly the HMHS Britannic never served as a passenger liner, only as a hospital ship during the war and she sadly became a casualty of war within a year.

Their “Midnight Sun Cruises” to Antarctica and the Falkland Islands in the 1970s, being close to their final days with Ybarra, were also outstanding! But, soon they were both sold. Head and read the full details and enjoy the many photographs!\n\nMS Cabo San Vicente … Dito.\n\nRMS Caledonia … The third built of an identical trio of liners, built to operate from Liverpool to India. This ship was built in 1948, being a good 10 years after her first sister, meaning she never had to serve in the war.
