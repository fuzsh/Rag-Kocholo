        "text": "I began my career in travel in 1982, starting at a small agency in Abbotsford, BC. I eventually moved to Vancouver, where I worked in the cruise department of a large agency., setting up and managing cruise groups. An opportunity to host a cruise group came up – and I fell in love with the sea.\n\nI sailed the world starting with Sitmar Cruises and then Princess Cruises. I enjoyed my nine years at sea and especially as a Shore Excursion Manager. Part of my job was to escort various tours and I discovered my strengths in communication with people of all ages and backgrounds, the ability to handle any situation that might arise, and a love of matching people with the right travel experience for them.\n\nHonestly and completely, my passion is cruising – I've sailed many times with a wide variety of lines, including Regent, Princess, Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Crystal, Cunard, Holland America, Paul Gauguin, Norwegian, Uniworld, Scenic and Viking. I love both Ocean Cruises and River Cruises and will continue to sail whenever I can."
