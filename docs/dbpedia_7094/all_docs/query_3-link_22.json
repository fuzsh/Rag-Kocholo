In the early 1990s, the Lefebvre family of Rome, former owners of Sitmar Cruises, conceived and organized a unique cruise company pledging to build and operate the highest quality ships in the ultra-luxury segment. The name \"Silversea\" was chosen because it connotes quality and luxury as well as capturing the romance and special sensations of the sea.\n\nSilversea launched its first ship, Silver Cloud in 1994, followed by Silver Wind in 1995, Silver Shadow in 2000 and the newest ship Silver Whisper in 2001. The fleet was purpose-built for the ultra-luxury market, establishing a new class of smaller, intimate vessels that could slip into more exotic ports off the beaten path. These elite vessels were specifically designed for fewer guests, more space and the highest levels of personalized service, delivered by Italian officers and European staff. All-ocean view suites, most with private veranda, and open seating dining options so guests dine when, where and with whom they desire, add to the very special ambiance created onboard. But what is also unique is that they incorporate the favorite amenities found on larger ships, such as an elaborate show lounge featuring nightly entertainment, casino, spa and state-of-the-art fitness facility."
