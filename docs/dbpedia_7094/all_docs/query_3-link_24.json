        "text": "The first trip Alan B. Buckelew ever took that could in any way be considered exotic was to the rural mountains of Vietnam in 1969. Buckelew, now 61, was then a young man who believed in doing what he perceived as his duty. Arriving in a country torn by war, he served with distinction as part of a U.S. Army reconnaissance unit, Fox Force, famous for the red scarves its members wore. Its job: to scout and engage the enemy for the much larger battalion to which it was attached. During the year he spent in Vietnam, Buckelew had several close brushes with death, earning a number of medals. Then, after returning home in the early 1970s, he studied history and business at UCLA, eventually going to work as a financial manager for Sitmar Cruises, an old Italian-based liner company that had transported refugees from Europe to Australia during World War II. In 1988, when Sitmar was acquired by what eventually became Carnival Corp. & PLC, the parent company of Princess Cruises, Buckelew stayed on. Over the years, he navigated his way through several high-level positions until being named Princess Cruises’ chief executive in 2007. Today, the former soldier takes lots of exotic trips for business and pleasure. One recent journey involved returning to Vietnam after an absence of 40 years. Buckelew wrote about the experience on the company’s blog, something of a departure for a man who describes himself as very private. The Business Journal caught up with him at his Santa Clarita office.\n\nQuestion: Have you always loved traveling?\n\nAnswer: Not really. My parents used to take us on car trips in the summer, and I used to go down to Mexico with my church every Thanksgiving to work at a mission. When I was 14, I saved enough money to take a bus back to Oklahoma to visit my grandparents. I also went to Canada with my parents as a youth, but never really did much exotic traveling.\n\nHow did you end up in Vietnam?\n\nI volunteered after my freshman year in college. I really didn’t know exactly where I wanted to go or what I wanted to do. To this day I can’t tell you all the factors that went into it, but I decided to join the other young men who were being called. To tell you the truth, I had mixed feelings about the war, but felt that it was as much my responsibility to be there as anyone’s.\n\nWhat did you find when you got there?\n\nI was assigned to a reconnaissance platoon of 18 to 25 men supporting a single battalion about a thousand strong. Our job was to help them find the enemy. We would go out looking for the enemy wherever intelligence suggested they might be and, if it was a small unit, engage them. We were in the central highlands, which meant that much of our time was spent in the mountains where it was physically taxing. We were a very stealthy unit, which led to our success. We weren’t in constant combat, but had regular firefights. It was extended periods of complete boredom, interrupted by the total terror of being shot at.\n\nDid you have any close calls?\n\nWe had lots of situations where the dirt was flying next to us from bullets being shot. Once the North Vietnamese attempted to overrun a position I was holding with two other men. That was pretty scary, because we weren’t used to fighting at night. We thought we were fighting just a few people but the next morning when the light came up we could see a dozen dead soldiers a few meters in front of us. I was more scared in the morning than I had been at night. One of the Bronze Stars I was awarded was for that fight.\n\nWhy the red scarves?\n\nBefore I joined, Fox Force had been working with a local South Vietnamese unit made up of indigenous people. They were atypical of the Vietnamese you saw on television at the time; they were much more primitive with the men wearing loin clothes and the women sarongs. It was our job to protect these people and our unit had worked with a group of them who wore red scarves as the only ceremonial piece to their uniform. We had distinguished ourselves with them, so they gave us their scarves as a way of saying thanks. The unit had worn them ever since.\n\nWhat was it like coming home?\n\nA lot of guys came directly home, but I was fortunate enough to go to Fort Carson, Colo., where I had a chance to decompress in a quasicivilian environment. Eventually I went back to UCLA, graduated from the business school in 1975 and joined Sitmar not too long afterwards. I had sent my resume to a number of search firms and got an interview right away. My major in business school had been international finance and here was an international cruise company looking for a financial manager to come in and develop a reporting system. It seemed like an interesting fit, so I gave it a go. It was a small business in a nascent industry, and I was very fortunate to get in on the ground floor.\n\nApparently the new job worked out.\n\nI fell in love with the cruise industry; it’s a fascinating business and I can’t imagine being involved in anything more vibrant. There’s always something new and I’m never bored.\n\nWhat do you actually do?\n\nWe have 17 ships calling on 110 countries. We’re moving people, goods and sometimes services globally and it all has to be on time. We are really in a lot of little businesses: We run our own boutiques on board; we do our own shows; create our own musicals and run our own programs. The ships are like our own little malls in which we run all the stores, food services, etc. It’s just a fascinating enterprise, and really a huge logistics business.\n\nDescribe your typical day.\n\nI spend about half my time in meetings, mostly having to do with planning and profits. The other half is spent on public relations and staff development, making sure that our culture is strong. The biggest chunk I try to allocate to thinking and planning. I generally get in around 7:30 or 8 a.m. and leave around 6 p.m. The nature of this business, though, is that it’s pretty much a 24-7 operation: We have ships all over the world and issues pop up everywhere that don’t respect our time zone or weekends. In our family albums of trips all over the world, there are lots of pictures of me with my BlackBerry or on my laptop. You never completely escape, though that is our tagline. Escape is for our consumers, not our employees.\n\nSpeaking of escape, do you travel much in your job?\n\nI’m generally gone about 90 days a year. Now that our girls are both out of college, my wife travels a lot with me on business trips. Sometimes it doesn’t work well because I’m tied up, but frequently she can wander around being a tourist and we have the mornings and evenings together. We also do lots of trips on our own, sometimes spinning them off of business trips. Recently, for instance, we had a business trip that took us to Venice and then I had to be in Rostock, Germany, so we spent five days in Berlin.\n\nWhere else have you been with your family?\n\nMy wife is half-French, so we travel to Europe a lot. We had a memorable trip around Cape Horn where the girls saw penguins. We’ve been to the South Pacific and Australia. Other than Vietnam, the most memorable cruise we’ve taken recently was to the Holy Land where we saw the pyramids and went to Jerusalem. It’s hard to overstate what it’s like to see the pyramids and walk through Jerusalem in the same week. One thing we haven’t done yet is an African safari.\n\nTell us about returning to Vietnam.\n\nMy family had never been to Asia, so last year I took them back. I was basically just a tourist there. We went to the museums and looked all around. It’s a very vibrant place; there’s lots of entrepreneurialism gong on and people seem happy. When I was in the war, Vietnamese women tended to wear more traditional clothing, like black slacks and tunics. Now everybody’s in Western garb. There was also lots of construction going on. Their economy is booming.\n\nWas it an emotional experience for you?\n\nIt was like completing a circle. It was important to go back and see what the place is like today because I needed to close that door. I think it would have been a lot more traumatic if not for the reunions I’d had with the guys. We’ve gotten it out of our systems by telling old war stories and reminiscing about how close we were to death; most of the trauma had already been flushed out. If I’d taken the trip 10 years earlier, I think a lot more would have come rushing back.\n\nHow did the reunions happen?\n\nOne of my fellow soldiers started connecting with us via the Internet in 1999 and the next year we got together in Albuquerque, N.M. One of the guys had brought slides and started telling stories and I said, “Jeez, I had forgotten about all that.” It was one story after another and I had buried all of it deep in the recesses of my mind. As the stories came back, it was a very cathartic experience. By the time we went home, I was emotionally drained. But the time was right; it had been 30 years since the war and we were ready. Now we get together every year. We go hunting in a little town in Arkansas – just the guys and not the wives – and we wear our red scarves.\n\nYou recently wrote about all this on your company blog, what prompted that?\n\nThe concept was to try and reinforce something that’s very important to the company: the fact that we go virtually everywhere that ships can go. Secondly, we wanted to use the blog to create a more human face for Princess Cruises. What we really wanted to do was build an emotional bridge between our customers and ourselves saying that we’re not just mechanical – it’s all about people. Every week we have a new employee write about the most memorable place they’ve ever been. We’re not trying to sell cruises, just communicate who we are in a more human and emotional way than traditional marketing can do.\n\nSpeaking of selling cruises how’s business?\n\n2009 was probably the worst year in our industry’s history. We knew that passengers were not going to pay as much as they had the year before, so we focused on filling our ships at a leveraged price. At the same time, we made a conscious effort to avoid cutting costs on anything that people could see. In fact, we made a few symbolic changes to make the product better by taking little things we used to charge for and making them free.\n\nCan you give us some examples?\n\nWe have specialty ice cream and little sandwiches we used to charge for that now are free. That sends a message to people that we’re a reliable partner who’s not going to change the product even though we didn’t get as much from them this time as last. At the same time, we challenged the company’s management to come up with cost savings because our revenues were down. They found all kinds of ways to operate smarter and more cheaply. While we couldn’t find anywhere near enough to offset it in 2009, prices have started bouncing back a little in 2010.\n\nHave you made any changes to your itinerary?\n\nWe still go all the places we used to, though we’re always looking for better ways to organize based on demand. We’ve reduced the number of cruises to Mexico because – though the violence there tends to be centered along the border and not at all at our ports further south – consumers are naturally hesitant and interest has dropped. We are also adding two ships to Alaska – one in 2013 and another in 2014 – as well as focusing more on Europe and the Caribbean.\n\nBesides traveling, how do you spend your free time?\n\nA lot of it, as I said, is on my BlackBerry. I also like to read, especially about history. I just finished three books: one on the Jacksonian period, a Lincoln biography and a book about Grant. I don’t golf or play tennis. I do go to the gym in the morning, and in the evening my wife likes to chat. Sometimes just doing nothing is really great, sort of decompressing and letting everything that’s happened in the last week file itself mentally in the right place.\n\nWas writing that blog part of your sorting process?\n\nYes, though it was a huge departure for me because it was putting a lot out on the web that I normally don’t share. I had to think about it a long time and didn’t sleep well for a few nights before it was launched. One thing I’ve learned is that there is an abundance of celebrity CEOs out there and that’s not something I’ve ever wanted to be.\n\nWhat kind of reaction did your entry get?\n\nThe response has been incredible. I’ve printed them all out so that I can read through them carefully. It was all very positive: “I loved your story, thank you for your service.” A lot of people welcomed me home. I must say that, even after 40 years, that meant a lot.\n\nAlan B.
