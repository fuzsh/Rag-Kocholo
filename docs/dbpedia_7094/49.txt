Welcome to the wonderful world of Sitmar Cruises a company that began after Sitmar Lines purchased two fine Cunard liners built in 1954 for the Australian service, but had to change direction and opted for the American luxury cruise market. Follow the wonderful career of these two ships after the newly formed Sitmar Cruises completely rebuilt and transformed them into sleek, elegant and luxurious 5 Star cruise ships in 1971 and 1972.

You will discover their remarkable history as well as the beginning of this new cruise company - “Sitmar Cruises” even though it is a company that has a long and a well-established history, having operated many ships and passenger liners as “Sitmar Lines.”

In this feature, I will also make mention of, complete with images, the greatly loved TSS Fairstar, ex HMTS Oxfordshire, as well as the 1984 built 46,000-ton SS Fairsky, which was the world’s very last steam passenger ship, as well as the 60,000-ton grand vision of the company owner Mr. Boris Vlasov, the M/V Sitmar FairMajesty of 1987/88, but in July 1988 P&O purchased Sitmar outright and Sitmar as we knew it, was no more!

This multi page feature offers some of the most amazing images and there are some that have not been seen for some forty-three years as they have been hidden and long forgotten!
