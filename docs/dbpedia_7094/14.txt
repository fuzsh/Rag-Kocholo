It'll be a sad day for many Australian cruisers with the departure of Pacific Jewel from the P&O Australia fleet. Many a good time has been spent on this grand liner - countless holiday memories and special occasions from Weddings, Anniversaries, Engagements, to Birthday and Sporting Celebrations. Imagine if her walls could talk!

Little do some people know that she's had an interesting past having been transferred, renamed, repositioned and refitted multiple times. She's also featured on the hit Australian soapie "Neighbours" back in 2010.

Those wanting to say goodbye can sail on her final P&O cruise on February 24th 2019, but for now let's have a look at her colourful past.

History

1989 - 2002

Pacific Jewel was originally built for Sitmar Cruises by the Italian shipbuilding group Fincantieri. Sitmar was the former owner of the popular Fairstar sailing out of Sydney. Sitmar was acquired by P&O Princess Cruises in 1988 and the still under construction ship ended up under P&O's control. Under P&O she was named "Crown Princess" and sailed on her maiden voyage on 8 July 1990.

In 2002, the ship was renamed "A'Rosa Blu" and transferred to A'Rosa Cruises, a new P&O brand aimed at the German market.

In 2003, following the acquisition of P&O by Carnival Corporation she was reassigned to the AIDA Cruises fleet. After a refit, she reentered service in 2004 as "AIDAblu".

2007 - 2009

Between 2007 and 2009, the ship was operated by Ocean Village (a subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises) as "Ocean Village Two". Following the shut down of the Ocean Village brand by owner Carnival she was transferred to P&O Australia's fleet and renamed "Pacific Jewel".
