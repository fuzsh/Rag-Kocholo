        "text": "Science Fiction Corpse Canonization\n\nTim Reluga\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nStarted September 2002\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn an interview with Kim Stanley Robinson I heard many months ago, he comments (in different words) that a love for science fiction literature may be an emergent property of some component of a cultureâs optimism for the future, and that this is why science fiction literature is so vibrant in some places and times and not others â he particularly mentions the rising popularity of SciFi in China at the time. I thought it was an interesting hypothesis. Today, though, I have to say, I think heâs right that science fiction is fundamentally optimistic, and that itâs less appealing to an audience without enthusiasm for the future. So, reader, I hope you find the list of stories below fruitful, and that they fire your optimism and enthusiasm as they once did mine.\n\nIn the mean time, check out the new contributed page on the cyberpunk subgenre.\n\nP.S. If you happen to be one of world-builders mentioned by name below, youâre awesome and helping us all make better sense of our world. I beg of your forgiveness and deference for this silly pastime of criticism.\n\nCanon\n\nThese are works of science fiction that I loved at the time and place wher I read them, from elementary school to the present. I list them without comment, so that they can speak for themselves.\n\nA Wrinkle in Time - Madeleine LâEngle\n\nJourney to the Center of the Earth - Jules Verne\n\nFlowers for Algernon - Daniel Keyes (1959)\n\nFarenheit 451 - Ray Bradbury\n\nThe Time Machine - H. G. Wells\n\nInvisible Man - H. G. Wells\n\nWar of the Worlds - H. G. Wells\n\n1984 - George Orwell\n\nJurassic Park - Michael Crichton\n\nThe Andromeda Strain - Michael Crichton\n\nDune - Frank Herbert\n\nEnderâs Game - Orson Scott Card\n\nHyperion, Fall of Hyperion - Dan Simmons\n\nThe Martian Chronicles - Ray Bradbury\n\nFrankenstein - Mary Shelley\n\nThe Diamond Age - Neal Stephenson\n\nLord of Light - Roger Zelazny\n\nSolaris - Stanislaw Lem\n\nSolaris - Stanislaw Lem\n\nParable of the Sower - Octavia Butler\n\nParable of the Talents - Octavia Butler\n\nSlan - A. E. Van Vogt\n\nThe doors of his face, the lamps of his mouth, and other stories - Roger Zelazny\n\nTransHuman Space - David Pulver\n\nStand on Zanzibar - John Brunner\n\nSpin - Robert Charles Wilson\n\nThe Space Merchants - Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth\n\nThe Windup Girl- Paolo Baciagalupi\n\nRoadside Picnic - Arkady and Boris Strugatsky\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nThe City and the Stars\n\nArthur C Clarke (1956). This is the best Clarke book Iâve read. Clarke creates a pointed picture of the far future, with his unique creative rigor that has aged much better than that of other authors. Still, the literalness of the telling weights it down. Perhaps I would prefer the more lyrical Against the fall of night. It is a story of deep optimism, but perhaps one with only a shallow grasp of the nature of life in the large, or else an unwillingness to apply that same creative rigor of science to ourselves.\n\nThe Bohr Maker\n\nLinda Nagata (1995). This is a mid-future setting, where the near-solar system has been colonized, citizens of wealthy nations have transcended and move between corporeal and digital existence at will, but most of earthâs human population continues to exist in poverty. Despite the technological advances, a conservationist political movement dominates governance, and further divergence from natural evolution of humans has been outlawed. This story tells of the events one outlawed non-sapient AI sets in motion. Rich in ideaâs like makers, ghosts, and solar colonization, this novel helped lay the foundation for transhuman concepts of the early 21st century.\n\nThe Difference Engine\n\nBruce Sterling and William Gibson (1991). World-building at its finest, giving birth to the steampunk genre. Alas, only 1/2 a story to go along with the world-building - some plot devices are much more offensive when than others when they fall short of their promises.\n\nThe Adolescence of P-1\n\nThomas J. Ryan (1977). This science-fiction story of AI-evolved-from-computer-virus is marvelous today for itâs depiction of state-of-the-art computing in the 1970âs, with mainframes, people reading assembly, and the rudimentariness of the concept of âoperating systemâ, among others. Itâs worth while for that alone, but you get the bonus of a well told, if recognizable-in-hindsight story to boot. Oddly, the limitations of technology at that time (such as an absence of sound-processing in computers) levels the playing field of man-vs-machine, making for a more believable conflict for me than almost all of the modern examples of the subgenre. The sense-of-place-and-time Ryan captures is also quite distinctive, both familiar and culturally distinct from today (though not all of the story-telling ages favorably). The 1985 Wonderworks presentation of the Canadian production of âHide and Seekâ, (parts 1, 2, 3, 4 ), is only very loosely based on the book, and better for a younger audience, as the book contains adult material.\n\nArslan\n\nM. J. Engh (1976). If you donât know who you are yet, this isnât the book to use as guidance. It is the most divisive work Iâve ever read, and an unmatched warning for any who can accommodate it.\n\nThe Quantum Thief\n\nHannu Rajaniemi (2010). The story on the threshold of the far future, builds a world with a surprising balance between the human and the posthuman. Itâs hard to write transhuman fiction and keep the science from bending over into fantasy and magic, but Rajaniemi shows it can be done. He tells his story a little like Ursala K Leguinâs Left hand of darkness with much richer technological entanglements. Things feel like they fall over the edge into fantasy too much for me at the end, but itâs a rich and thought-provoking story along the way.\n\nThe Martian\n\nAndy Weir (2014). A great contemporary hard-scifi frontier survival story.\n\nRoadside Picnic\n\nThe Strugatsky brothers (1971), translated from Russian. This is an excellent science fiction novel from 1970âs Russia, and a suitable companion work to Lemâs Solaris. Itâs one of those things thatâs embarrassing - I knew about the world long before I learned of the book. During my senior year of high school, I took a trip out to Oberlin college, which I was considering attending at the time. The one night I was there, the film âStalkerâ was showing on campus, and a Egyptian student was wandering the dorm halls recruiting people to attend with her. I had no idea what to expect but science fiction was always intriguing, so I went. It was a miserable 3 hours - I was under-dressed and cold, sitting in a hard wooden classroom chair, and instead of a special-effects ladened adventure, I got a tedious foreign film, low on dialog and devoid of action. And yet, it was still tense and compelling. To this day, scenes haunt my memory, including the finest rain-shower Iâve every seen on a movie screen. The style of the movie, forced into metaphorical rendition for by financial, technical, and artistic limitations, languished in a Zone of introspective psychological cinema for me, with little connection to emphatic science fiction. I find the book suffers none of these limitations - somehow, the text is much freer than the movie, and all those psychological moments take on tangible expression. I would love to see a new film adaptation - not one of our boom-fests or synthetic-world block-busters, but something subtle and close to the original Stalker. Just touched up so all that stress over âwhat if the next step is my doomâ-moments carry visceral weight. Anybody brave enough to put the slime, bug traps, and grinders on screen in a sunny meadow with blue skies?\n\nAnathem\n\nNeal Stephenson (2008). I breezed through the first 2/3rds of this book like nothing, really enjoying it. I think this is probably because of an unusual match between myself and the book. If you dislike philosophy, or think itâs a waste of time, you probably arenât going to enjoy this novel, and will find it dull. If you are math grad student, and are interested in the philosophy of science, no other novel does what this one does. But I didnât like everything about it. At some point, the book just seems to lose its aim, and while thereâs still fun stuff here and there, I lost interest. But no great criticism there - Hamlet and Huckleberry Finn have similar issues, and nobodyâs questioning their worth. For an antipodal point, one may investigate Lemâs satires, like âOddsâ.\n\nRed Mars\n\nKim Stanley Robinson (1993). First book of a trilogy of hard science imaginings on the classic topic of Mars. Our popular-fiction fascination with mars is long and hallowed, tracing through the works including âA Princess of Marsâ, âThe Martian Chroniclesâ, âStranger in a Strange Landâ, âWar of the Worldsâ. Robinson creates a work with great research and the feeling of authority, drawing on ideas and insights that, despite their clarity, remain outside the veins of common discourse, while touching on recurring scifi issues of utopianism and pantropy. A great deal of time is spent with specific characters and their points-of-view, so if you donât like the characters, itâs a haul to read, but still required.\n\nThe Listeners\n\nJames Gunn (1972). First contact novel comparable to Contact, Childhoodâs end, and His Masterâs voice. In this particular telling, Gunn is systematic, limiting himself to the ordinary science of the day, and addressing the roles of people and the implications for society in a careful and measured manner building on that period in American history. There is very little action in the story, and the aspirational style blunts the few tensions in the novel. Perhaps I would have preferred something with a hard-science edge, but it is a real-science utopian take on first contact, and for that I admire it. Gunn is better known for his excellent anthologies and teaching.\n\nMore than Human\n\nTheodore Sturgeon (1953). The beginning of this novella is beautiful written. Put with the rest of the book, itâs a well-told story, without the clutter of technology or pseudoscience, mildly triumphant but more emphatically disturbing in a depiction of human transcendence. Sturgeon tells the tale without the naivety of âChildhoodâs Endâ and with an impartial eye, leaving the judgments to the reader. I donât like the world he sees.\n\nVacuum Flowers\n\nMichael Swanick (1987). This is the story of the adventures of a young woman in a solar system colonized haphazardly by humans with malliable personalities. It doesnât carry the excitement of an epic and the characters are a little flat, but the ideas, with strong cyberpunk elements, are interesting. In particular, as a pre-internet publication investigating the broader implications of computer programming. The core premise is that individuals can voluntarily have their personalities reprogrammed, and can even buy personalities off the shelf. Interesting implications abound, but Swanick doesnât quite capture the internal passions and conflicts that something like this is sure to generate. Pay attention to changes in perspective within the third-person limited narration.\n\nCandle\n\nJohn Barnes (2000). This short adventure is set at the end of the 21st century, and recounts the War of the Memes and its aftermath from the perspectives of two old soldiers. How would daily life work in a human world dominated by a meme? How would it compare to an Orwellian world? Can a program really fix the human conflicts of a Brunnerian world? Can a massive emergent intelligence be stable, and if not, what kind of instabilities will appear? Slow at some points, with its back-woods setting, but also with surprises and some bite.\n\nStand on Zanzibar\n\nJohn Brunner (1968). Actually, despite being listed above as one of my favorites, this book deserves some comment. It appears to be an under appreciated classic, particularly at this point (2005) in history. Brunnerâs science was incremental, not prophetic. Todayâs high school students know more genetics. Television fades to the internet. But the scientific details have little importance. The bookâs strength is itâs societal breadth. The closest above work is 1984. But where Orwell gives evil an incarnation in Big Brother, Brunner depicts more clearly that evil is an intangible. There is no monolithic Sauron who is the fountain head of all evil. We can not blame some mythical source of tyranny. We alone, as individuals and as society, share responsibility for the suffering and tragedy we decry. And the questions raised by comparison to contemporary history are very interesting. Is terrorism an incarnation of the muckers Brunner predicts. How do we handle the challenge of species improvement? And what do we do with so many of us that we do not fit on Zanzibar? This is a good starting point for understanding of the world before jumping off into the battle for improvement, a good read for all college freshmen.\n\nBeggars and Choosers\n\nN. Kress (1994). Sequel to âBeggars in Spainâ. Kressâs hard scifi depiction of the near future is alien and uncomfortable despite her very human characters. A world where the choices of a few can redefine us all. The originality of this pair of short novels makes them essential reading for all scifi fans, and will likely place them in the cannons of many readers.\n\nCity\n\nC. D. Simak (1952). This is an interesting work, and namesake of our local book store. It didnât enthrall me, but it did hold my interest all the way to the end. City is a more process-oriented take on transcendence than Arthur C. Clarkâs. And Simak is more concerned with what we leave behind than where we go. The structure of 8 short stories works very well to convey the myth of âmanâ. Published in 1952, this workâs recent prehistory was WWII and the cold war. The future City sees is perceptibly colored in accordance, but is much more balanced and constructive than âCanticle for Leibowitzâ. Miller tells us of our doom along one path. Simak does not disagree, but points out that there are other paths and different people will choose different paths. My main objection was that the bookâs focus was a little too narrow given subsequent history, but Iâm being picky. It really is a good book.\n\nThe Book of the New Sun\n\nby Gene Wolfe (1980âs). A tetralogy including The Shadow of the Torturer, The Claw of the Concilliator, The Sword of the Lictor, The Citadel of the Autarch, and The Urth of the New Sun. This dying-earth(far-future, failing sun, science plus minor fantasy) work has a realized setting with strong medieval overtones. The style is similar to that of Zelazny, but the writing is very subtle in places, and went completely over my head in the first book. Much of the story lies in the narrator himself, and the story folds back on itself more than I yet understand. It almost certainly demands a second reading some day. As a unified work, it was a more satisfying if less spectacular saga than Tolkienâs. There are a few spectacular sequences in the tetralogy, 1 in the first book and 1 in the third book specifically, which richly blend emotion, drama, and adventure. The rest of the work is slow but seldom boring. In an otherwise solid work, I was troubled with the authorâs unnecessary employment of time-travel references in the final volume. The follow-up book has elements of worth, but can be skipped without much fuss.\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness\n\nby Ursula K. LeGuin. As the author says, less sci-fi, more thought experiment. Well written with some good imagery. Didnât fascinate me as I read it, mostly because it is a meditation on the human condition and tosses off some complex scientific issues hap-hazardly as background, but LeGuin does a good job with the task she set herself.\n\nHave space suit - will travel\n\nby Robert A. Heinlein. This is a very pure space adventure, colored (to its disadvantage) by standard 1950âs postwar attitudes and science. There is enough real science(and math!) to keep the work believable. The adventure is fun and well-written, holding itself together where weaker or more fantastic authors would have fallen apart. I think itâs a good book for a highschool freshman, but lacks meat for more seasoned readers.\n\nStartide Rising\n\nby David Brin - interesting idea of genetically engineered future but otherwise a standard if dramatic adventure piece. I have not read the originating novel, Sundiver, but have heard it lacks luster. The sequels(Infinityâs Shore,â¦) are improvements.\n\nThe Man in the High Castle\n\nby Philip K. Dick. Skitzoid alternate history. Too self-referential, perhaps.\n\nChildhoodâs End\n\nArthur C. Clarke. I donât buy transcendence, and some issues were resolved unsatisfactorily, but the story is well told.\n\nThe Crystal World\n\nJ. G. Ballard. The descriptions in this story are spectacular. In literature, there are parallels with The Heart of Darkness. But in the end, I couldnât identify with the protagonist. I wouldnât have guessed that before reading the story, though.\n\nThe Fifth Head of Cerberus\n\nGene Wolfe. This very well written. It consists of 3 intertwining novellaâs set on a pair of colony worlds. The stories are deep, with strong existentialist tones. I donât know what they mean. The illusions were too vague for me to grasp on a first reading. Even the significance of the title alludes me.\n\nSnow Crash\n\nby Neal Stephenson (1992). A real fun piece of pulp, but less refined than his more recent works. Probably would have been cooler if Iâd read it when I was 16.\n\nFoundation\n\n(first two only) - Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Relic\n\nExcellent pulp adventure. The sequel is lower quality, but still fun.\n\nRingworld\n\nLarry Niven. Good science, lousy story.\n\nRendezvous with Rama\n\nArthur C. Clarke. Good science, not much story.\n\nA Canticle for Leibowitz\n\nWalter M. Miller. This is a decent work, but the style of the subject matter presentation didnât move me. The horrors of nuclear war which drive this story are never related in moving emotional manner they deserve. Written near the dawn of the cold war(1959?), Canticle focuses on the deeper philosophical currents that had lead to the existence of a cold war. Its edge is tempered, however, by our existence in a post-coldwar world, where all that was prophesied by this work has not come to pass.\n\nGood Sci-Fi Short Stories\n\nToo many of these stories are hard to get a hold of.\n\nâBy the Waters of Babylonâ by Stephen Vincent Benet - amazing that this was written in 1937, before the atomic bomb.\n\nâThe Crystal Eggâ by H. G. Wells (not sure why I liked this so much the first time I read it)\n\nâThe Good Workâ by Theodore L. Thomas. (simple, well said, pertinent today still)\n\nâThe New Primeâ by Jack Vance\n\nâThe Dragon Mastersâ by Jack Vance (why didnât he make a book of this one?)\n\nâThis Moment of the Stormâ by Zelazny\n\nâWho Goes There?â by John W. Campbell (his only good story, legend has it)\n\nâThe Damned Thingâ by Ambrose Bierce\n\nâDear Pen Palâ by A. E. van Vogt\n\nâThe House of Ecstasyâ by Ralph Milne Farley\n\nâLuciferâ by Roger Zelazy\n\nâThe Last Menâ by Frank Belknap Long\n\nâGiant Killerâ by A. Bertram Chandler (an unforgettable story)\n\nâCall Me Joeâ by Poul Anderson. This 1957 story is clearly source material for seemingly contemporary pieces include Old Manâs War, Dollhouse, and Avatar. In Avatar, very few parts of the story feel original, and it turns out that the only parts that MIGHT feel original and innovative are actually near-exact parallels with this story, and the story handles them more interestingly! The internet knows but wikipedia has forgotten. The places where Avatar diverges from Andersonâs story? Well, they are swiped from the Strugatsky brothers who wrote the CLASSIC Roadside Picnic listed above. See this ethics discussion also.\n\nOther works of Science Fiction\n\n20,000 Leagues under the sea, by Jules Verne, 1870. A classic, unavoidable tale for every youth. My favorite version was the classics-illustrated version. But the original book had some of its own hilights. In particular, there is an interesting nascent tension in Verne between a rich natural world waiting for the intrepid harvester, and manâs exploitation destroying the very thing he values, like the Dugongâs of the Indian ocean. But the journey had lost much of its novelty at this point. The lengthy digressions on marine fauna (which I liked) are a reminder of a period were entertainment was harder to come by.\n\nThe water knife, by Paolo Bacigalupi (2015) is a rich depiction of the near-future of the Colorado river basin. The first half of the book was rich and involving, but the story loses its energy in the second half. With the exception of a few particular scenes, it feels like a safe story - all the bumps and bruises heal and everybody will have an exciting story tell over hot-coco. Bacigalupi has written a few kids books recently, which had some cool content but were really pale shadows compared to âWindup Girlâ and this story doesnât quite make it back to that high level.\n\nConsider Phlebas, by Ian Banks (1987) is a galactic-scale space opera. The vignettes are intended to shocking and forward-thinking, but suffer from too much of the starwars-future-syndrome - the book really feels like it was written in the 80âs and failing to see past the present into the future. Contrast with the much better âVacuum Flowersâ, âThe Urth of the New Sunâ, and âThe Uplift Warâ, all of which were written in the same year.\n\nStarship, by Brian Aldiss (1963) is an adventure where generations of a ships crew have been reduced to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle on their vast ship. Aldiss was may be near the truth with his depiction of human reversion to primitive behavior after a catastrophe, and the setting has some interesting components like hydroponic forests run amuk. But all the potential surprises are spoiled and revealed without the thrill of revelation. I keep waiting for something surprising, but it never arrived.\n\nThe Breach (2009) and Deep Sky (2011) by Patrick Lee. Dark scifi covert ops thrillers set close to the present day, but with some very interesting nuggets of speculative technology. The nuggets are sparse, so Leeâs not really living up to A. E. van Voitâs standards, but those nuggets offer many opportunities for interesting story telling. Mr.Â Lee does a good job keeping the stories moving and the reader off-balance. The stories are very rough at times. However, the stories seem to take the easy ways out - when things start to get complicated, pull a trick that simplifies everything back down. I did like the way he ends things, though.\n\nThe Last Colony (2008) by John Scalzi. A sequal to Ghost Brigades and Old Manâs War, this closes the cycle (well, almost). In this one, Scalzi reveals his positive outlook, and overconfidence in the preservation in the power of the individual. Here, he completely abandons plausibility in favor of the action-movie.\n\nGhost Brigades (2007) by John Scalzi. This is a second novel with the same setting of Old Manâs War. It pushes the technology presented there a little farther forward, allowing the cloning of both minds and bodies. Scalzi takes a topic with some very dark roots (the exploitation of clones as a counterpoint to the risk of individual freedoms) and turns it mundane, which is an accomplishment, I suppose. There are a few other interesting topics thrown in including whether a civilization can exist without culture or consciousness, the process of educating clones with accelerated development, and conflicts between humans and there engineered soldiers. There are a few moments of emotion and tragedy, but mostly, this book consists of a few interesting seeds of speculative scifi wrapped up in an action movie..\n\nA Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula LeGuin (1968). Not really a scifi story, but classic fantasy, - the first book in a magical Earth Sea story cycle like Middle Earth and Hogwarts. I found the novel disappointing, over all. The elaboration on the importance of names and language as a tool that gives us power over the world is enlightening. But the bookâs core premise is the shaping of a soul through introspection and self-knowledge, with shades of predestination, original sin, and Asian concepts of balance throughout. While introspection is sometimes a useful tool, and balance is as good a core tenant as any, I find the concepts of both predestination and original sin uninteresting.\n\nMission of Gravity by Hal Clement [Harry Stubbs] (1954). A hard-scifi study of teamwork between human and alien species. The tech-level feels 1950âs. Insignificant interpersonal conflict, generally positive outlook. Classified as an example of early hard-scifi, the journey-of-discovery sequence has some entertaining points but felt dated and never really resonated for me. Given my similar reactions to Red Mars, I guess I donât really like pure hard-scifi.\n\nPrincess of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs (1912). The first of 11 books. A magnificently creative adventure with a pragmatic take on the complexity of a dying world, Barsoom (aka Mars). Not intended as science fiction, perhaps, but avoids the fantastic so cleanly, that it can be none other than one of the great starting points of the genre.\n\nGateway, Volume 1 of the Heechee saga by Fredrick Pohl (1977?). Soft scifi focusing on human relationships, and without any serious speculation. Similarities to âSpace Merchantsâ, but with a more conventional setting. I thought it had allot of potential starting out, but flows off into only a moderately interesting direction while abandoning other avenues of development. Perhaps just a more mature work by Pohl or lacking the tension from a coauthor. Interestingly, it conforms to the other works of the 1970âs, in itâs exploration of the human condition with complete confidence in the permanence of that condition despite technological change. The passing depiction of violence against women left a bad taste in my mouth, but there are many similar examples from that period, and theirâs no reason to blame Mr.Â Pohl for reflecting his times.\n\nA Deepness in the Sky by Vernor Vinge (1999) Mid-future hard scifi prequel to âA Fire upon the Deepâ. In many respects, itâs standard fair - three intertwined stories, heroism, and a simplified moral spectrum. But in the telling, Vinge fills in Pham Nuwenâs history and reveals some important philosophical perspectives on galactic colonization and persistence of complex societies. Understanding these pieces puts âRainbowâs endâ in a better context.\n\nDarwinian by Robert Charles Wilson (1999) A brilliant aspiration that falls flat when the author couldnât figure out where to take the story? I lost interest on reading the first interlude, and hadnât recovered any when I finished. Iâd hoped for something the same quality as Spin but maybe I was looking in the wrong direction.\n\nA Fire upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge (1992) An adventure where most of the action occurs in a medieval setting. The depiction of powerful AI is the best part.\n\nHalting State by Charles Stross (2007). Told from the perspectives of three narrators from different corners of the near future, tangled together by plan and chance, this turns out to be a Bond-adventure where Jack Bauer is replaced by Jack-the-computer-geek. Starts with an interesting premise and has some interesting fun depictions of large online role-playing games of the future, but fails to finish strong or with any clear vision of the new world. The second-person narrative is initially jarring; I got used to it, but it was never satisfying.\n\nRainbows End by Vernor Vinge (2006). An exciting depiction of life in a networked world of wearable computers and a patchwork of medical revolutions. Useful, but ultimately limited in scope. However, it seems to be the most attractive and influential near-future work Iâve bumped into so far.\n\nOld Manâs War by John Scalzi (2005). Immortalist martial utopian propaganda, but very well written propaganda. Compare to Haldemanâs Forever War.\n\nIlium and Olympus by Dan Simmons (2003,2005). Not great sci-fi, but great fun to read. Simmons employs some standard tools in his depiction of a far-future solar setting, but does so expertly, and with great breadth. The characters stretched far beyond their initial selves in learning to deal with the world the author has created for them. The plot is crucially hinged on a few ideas that I think are fantasy, not science, but why let that get in the way of a great story.\n\nStranger in a Strange Land, by Robert Heinlein (1968?). An interesting premise that suffers from adolescent-male syndrome, and sacrifices science in favor of plot convenience. Maybe most enjoyed by teenage guys.\n\nOrbital Resonance by John Barnes (1991). Set on a orbital transfer ship, this is a coming-of-age story with a social engineering twist. Uncomfortable at times, but develops some original lines. But on those lines, there were some parts that were unconvincing.\n\nContact, by Carl Sagan (1985). The original story, upon which the movie of the same name is based. I saw the movie years before reading the story, and perhaps that took out some of the umph. Sagan focuses heavily on the emotional life of a 70âs contemporary protagonist. This is understandable, since Sagan was a scientist and public figure trying to bridge the gap into literature. He pullâs it off reasonably well too. But for me, this was a disappointment. I had high expectations for a depiction of the social and political complexities of a first-contact scenario. Yet the story kept turning in on Eli(the main character) when I kept wanting it to turn out on the world at large. Itâs a good story, and Iâm happy I read it. The depiction of a successful female scientist from a 60âs and 70âs perspective (many aspects of which probably still have contemporary significance) is interesting (though comparison to depictions of the same situation by female scientist-authors with first-hand experience of the period seems in order). Still, Iâm definitely looking for a better hard-scifi depiction of first contact from a global socio-economic perspective.\n\nTo Your Scattered Bodies Go, by Philip Jose Farmer (1971). The first book in the Riverworld Saga, this book introduces the reader to an afterlife where all of human history must live together and that the characters must learn to make their own. With a heavy dose of 60âs sensibilities, I found this one rather bland, with flat characters, but easy and fun to read.\n\nQueen of Angels, by Greg Bear (1990). This is a collage. The near-future nanotech setting has moments of brightness, but Bearâs narrative is one of individuals struggling with personal demons in an impersonal world. Iâd place it as a weaker work in the vain of Helliconia series and Left Hand.\n\nLimits of Vision, by Linda Nagata (2001). An appropriately named work. Nagata studies one scenario of how technology may escape its traditional frame and change the world. The author deserves credit for a near-future setting that may come to pass, and depicting the evolution of a very interesting form of post-human life. The depiction of the human characters is narrow, and has a utopian quality. The story is full of wonderful imaginings, while also cultivating a degree of mystery. One of my responses to this vision was a feeling that the scientific equation was left unbalanced (a detail that I might overlook usually, but here it feels like the author walks right up to these points before turning away). Limits departs in important and refreshing ways from the presentation styles of older authors like Blish and Miller, and its genre broadening efforts are worth while.\n\nThe Seedling Stars, by James Blish(1957). One of the earliest works focusing on pantropy, though the author credits Olaf Stapledon and predecessors. The book juxtaposes the conflicts of man vs.Â nature and Christian burning, and nicely closes the cycle. Some plot devises are far fetched (an all powerful port authority) if entertaining (particularly the microbial world). I still donât understand some authorsâ selective morality in the depiction of genocide, in this case, rotifer (see Conan Doyleâs Lost World also). Ultimately, the book relies on a romantic but failing premise similar to that of GATTACA - singularity of the human spirit. I think Simak was closer to the truth.\n\nA Case of Conscience, by James Blish. A work where science fiction is used as a crucible for the study of catholic faith. Not compelling from my philosophical perspective. A Canticle for Leibowitz and Childhoodâs End are of a related vain.\n\nBrightness Reef, Infinityâs shore, Heavenâs reach by David Brin\n\nBook of the Long Sun by Gene Wolfe,\n\nSphere by Michael Crichton, Harvest by R. Wilson, Footfall by Niven, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Nemisis, Prey\n\nThe Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham. Originally left off this list, as I found it fun pulp, but didnât really think it was noteworthy science fiction. But it appears on otherâs lists.\n\nThe Dying Earth, Araminta Station both by Jack Vance\n\nTau Zero by Poul Anderson (1970)\n\nThe Forever War by Haldeman (1974). This is mildly interesting, the main character is engaging, but I didnât think it was anything special. In context, though, it stands out from itâs contemporaries. While working from the same human perspective, the technological considerations of the setting were full of foresight and innovative.\n\nWorks mislabeled as Science Fiction\n\nHelliconia Spring by Brian Aldiss. This is an interesting tale, and finely written, but never caught my imagination (though the alternate biology is very interesting). While the theoretical setting is the far future, on a distant world, the actualized setting is bronze-age. I classify this work not as scifi but as lateralistâ¦contemporary protagonists in different but potentially real world. To its credit, I found myself surprisingly sympathetic to several of the main characters. Aldissâs novel enriched my understanding of this place and time, but never pointed the way forward.\n\nOn the Beach - Shute. Just because it is the end of the world does not mean it is science fiction.\n\nA Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurâs Court by Mark Twain.\n\nLest Darkness Fall. This is a romp, without serious introspection, and a pale shadow of Mark Twainâs Yankee. I wouldnât qualify either of these works as Science Fiction, though.\n\nLost race of Mars by Robert Silverberg and Leonard P. Kessler. Kids book. Kids book.\n\nResources\n\nIâve found several sites useful in pursuing this project. Many have disappeared from the web since I started this project, but Iâve found new ones to replace the old.\n\nSomnium, by revolutionary astronomer Johannes Kepler, may be the first hard science fiction story ever written. For me, learning of its existence implies a radical change in perspective on Kepler.\n\nDecember 2017 scifi reading list from the verge.com.\n\nThe Center for the Study of Science Fiction has a Basics library.\n\nThe Road to Science Fiction anthologies edited by James Gunn seem to be very useful starting points. I wish I could keep myself from reading the story prefaces.\n\nA timeline is a useful reference tool for placing works in context.\n\nScience fiction from the UKâs national short-story day.\n\nGuardian newspapaer has the stars of modern SF pick the best science fiction (2011)\n\nSlashdot occasionally discussed science fiction. This was an interesting forum motivated by the neglect of Brunnerâs work.\n\nA list of books having won one of the major Science Fiction awards (not updated since 2007):\n\nCluteâs classic science fiction\n\nRichard Daviesâs list of scifi essentials at Abe books, up to 2011.\n\nJames Harrisâs Classics of science fiction\n\n[SFReviews]((http://www.sfreviews.com/best.htm)\n\nhttp://www.adherents.com/lit/sf_lists.html\n\nEncyclopedia of Science Fiction\n\nNPRâs top 100 science fiction books, as of summer, 2011. The list has difficulty distinguishing works of science fiction from fantasy, which may just be a reflection of our current cultural grasp of science. (How the heck does âWatership Downâ, while a great book, make a list of science-fiction works?)\n\nBest Dystopian Books 2022-02-16\n\nHere are some links to contemporary scifi culture sites.\n\nIf, a historic science fiction magazine, is now available from the internet archive!\n\nA list of 19th century adventure, including some of the first scifi. http://hilobrow.com/2013/09/09/19th-c-adventure/\n\nThe Intergalactic Medicine Show http://www.intergalacticmedicineshow.com/\n\nClarkesworld http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/\n\nHugo Awards site: http://www.thehugoawards.org/\n\nAnsible: http://news.ansible.co.uk/\n\nLocus: http://www.locusmag.com/\n\nInterzone: http://ttapress.com/interzone/\n\nAnalog: http://www.analogsf.com/201011/index.shtml\n\nAsimov Science Fiction: http://www.asimovs.com/2010_09/index.shtml\n\nWeird Tales: http://www.weirdtales.net/\n\nLinda Nagataâs blog: http://hahvi.net/\n\nFredrick Pohlâs blog: http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/\n\nA Transhumanist reading list http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Art/book_index.html\n\nSciFi Crowsnest http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/index.php\n\nAmerican library association Reference and User Services Reading list http://www.ala.org/rusa/awards/readinglist\n\nScifi@Darkroastedblend - http://www.scifi.darkroastedblend.com/\n\nReading List\n\nWanted\n\nThe Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle) by Patrick Rothfuss\n\nThe Voices of Time by J.

This is maybe a little different during the current golden age, but weâll see.\n\nThe Expanse\n\nRick and Morty â surprisingly strong science fiction for a cartoon, but I hate the nihilism. Rickâs love for his family is far from a tolerable excuse for his actions.\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nPerson of interest (2011-2015) - AI meets Equalizer/A-Team. They do not seem to be too shy about the implications of their premise until the final season throws all that good world-building out and instead pulls a solution out of a hat. Skip the last season â it sucked, chickening out on everything that came before.\n\nWonderworks was a PBS TV series during the 1980âs, that did a little science fiction. I particularly remember âHide and Seekâ which was an AI story based on âThe adolescence of P-1â, and an incredibly compelling version of Ray Bradburyâs short story - âAll of Summer in a Dayâ, which still haunts my dreams.\n\nFirefly - A scifi show with maturity enough to stand on emotion rather than tech and war, hence cancelled after 1 season.\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation - old stand-by\n\nTerminator: Sarah Conner Chronicles - immensely popular while combat-driven, deserted like the Titanic when it slowed down enough to think about the nature of loyalty, sources of human conflict, and posthumanism.\n\nBabylon 5 - Saved by the British - greatest scifi TV epic of all time (though it may not have aged well since its creation).\n\nDollhouse - intense show, incredible cast with rare exception, too strange to draw an audience.\n\nCowboy Bebop - jazz noir anima\n\nTotal Recall 2070 - adult themes are not suitable for American audiences - see Dollhouse.\n\nBattlestar Galactica (2004) - a smart blond can save even a good show?\n\nCaprica - Donât try to make a show that considers unfamiliar cultural norms and is driven by social conflict. Nobody watches TV to experience the unfamiliar.\n\nThe 4400 - nobody has the patience to follow a good story arc to completion, so donât even try.\n\nStargate Universe - proof that apes are biased towards dualism.\n\nJourneyman - better than quantum leap, so cancelled after 1 season\n\nThe Outer Limits - only place that could tell compelling parables of failure on TV\n\nLost (great show, but not really scifi)\n\nStar Trek: Deep Space 9 - fun\n\nFringe (Season 1 only) - to save the show, they walked away from serious thought about the future.\n\nTrinity Blood - cool. The art could be better, and the deliveries are terribly flat, but that gives it a campy appeal.\n\nGene Wolfe (April, 2019) has passed away. I recommend âBook of the New Sunâ.\n\nUrsula Le Guin has died (January, 2018). Of her many works, I have only read âThe Left Hand of Darknessâ and âA wizard of earthseaâ. I should probably read more. Thanks, Ms.Â Le Guin.\n\nBrian Aldiss has died (August, 2017). His name appears several times below, for Helliconian spring, Starship, and Hothouse. Aldiss also wrote the short story on which the Kubrick/Spielberg epic fairy-tale movie âA.I.â was based. Go read something of his. Iâm going to look for âGreybeardâ, which I have been interested in for a long time, but never gotten to.\n\nMadeleine LâEngle, author of A Wrinkle in Time died September 6th, 2007. This is the book that introduces many readers to science fiction and fantasy. Until today, Iâd forgotten to add it to this list. I donât think I understood it when I read it. I have to go back and read it again, particularly in light of Simmonâs Olympus story line for some reason.\n\nWith great sadness, I learned of the deaths of two of my favorite authors: Octavia Butler (February 24th, 2006) and Stanislaw Lem (March 28th, 2006). Get their books from your library, read, and be thankful for what they shared with us before they died.\n\nKids bedtime"
