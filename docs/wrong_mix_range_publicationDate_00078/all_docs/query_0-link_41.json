        "text": "I’m sure it will come as no surprise to anyone reading this blog that I like books about literature, about literary history, and about literary criticism. So I was always going to be the target audience for Peter Kemp’s Retroland: A Reader’s Guide to the Dazzling Diversity of Modern Fiction. And I am glad I picked it up. I do have probably as much in the way of gripes and criticisms as I have praise for the book, but that is almost inevitable in a work like this. But in the main I found it an exhilarating romp through primarily English fiction since about 1970. That starting date is arbitrary, and not really explained, but it does give us a half-century of literature to consider, and I suppose it means Kemp gets in ahead of what is likely to be a rush of books in the next couple of years that will be looking back at the first quarter of this century, or perhaps starting in 1975 to compare the last quarter of last century with the first quarter of this, or even more expansively perhaps considering the century from 1925. I don’t know about you, but I’m already getting a vague sense that the 1920s are starting to crop up in books more frequently than I remember, though that could just be the direction my own interests take me.\n\nThe first thing to be said about Retroland is that the sub-head is irrelevant. There are a lot of novels covered in this volume, so it is diverse in that sense, but the book is not about diversity, it is not about the dazzle. Kemp has a theme, and the book focuses narrowly on how the fiction of the last half-century has stuck to that theme, explored it and played games with it. Which in a very real sense is the opposite of diversity.\n\nKemp’s theme is history, and his thesis is that the novelists (at least the British novelists) of the period have overwhelmingly turned to the past for their subject, their inspiration, or their model. Kemp’s focus on this is so narrow that any writer (by which I mean mainstream novelist, I will come later to discuss Kemp’s engagement, or lack of it, with genre fiction) who deals exclusively with the present (Ali Smith, Iain (no-M) Banks) does not appear in the book, which can rather skew the perspective. But okay, I will concede the point, since so many of the contemporary novelists that I return to again and again (Kate Atkinson, William Boyd, Sarah Perry, Graham Swift) do turn frequently, sometimes exclusively, to the past.\n\nThere is, of course, an issue here that I don’t think is adequately addressed in the book; two issues, in fact. The first is: what does it mean that so many contemporary writers have turned to the past in this way? Are they saying that today can only be thoroughly understood by examining yesterday? Are they saying that the ills of today have their source in the wrongs of yesterday? Or, by contrast, are they saying that the well-formed past holds up a mirror to the ill-fared present? I don’t know, but Kemp has so much ground to cover that he must perforce spend more time on the ways the past is addressed and not on why it is so addressed. But then there’s another issue that only occurred to me as I was writing this: is the past really a phenomenon peculiar to post-1970 fiction? Let’s face it, British writers (and something like 90% of the writers covered here are British) have been writing about the past since at least Walter Scott. Dickens was an historical novelist, so was Stevenson, so were heaven knows how many others. How many of the interwar crime novelists (Dorothy L. Sayers) infused their work with references to the Great War; or turned even further back (Josephine Tey)? So, are we talking about a mode that fell out of fashion only to become prominent again after 1970, or something that had always been there? The answer to that question would change our perspective on the works considered here, but I’m not sure the question is even asked.\n\nYet, although I was aware of these niggles, they didn’t bother me as I was reading the book, I was too caught up in the narrative. Now a book of this nature inevitably comes down to lists, and there are a lot of them spread through the book. When you are reading such lists your mind inevitably snags on the names that are missing, and these clearly indicate gaps in the author’s knowledge. In one list there is an allusion to Kate Atkinson’s Life After Life, but neither she nor the book are named anywhere in this volume; so he knows of the book but is not familiar enough with it, or anything else by Atkinson, to recognise how she fits within his thesis. In a chapter devoted to updatings of the story of Frankenstein there is no mention of Poor Things by Alasdair Gray, indeed Gray appears nowhere in the book which seems to me like a fatal shortcoming. But no one can read everything, be aware of everything, and Kemp covers a lot of ground, writers I like and writers I have never previously heard of. So yes, there are writers I would have thought central to the thesis that are absent, but that hardly undermines what the book does achieve.\n\nAnd the lists, let’s face it, are not the be-all-and-end-all of the book. Far more interesting and valuable are the longer, more considered, more detailed accounts of particular authors or works. I can hardly fault him here, for he takes us into the work of writers I rate highly (David Mitchell, Pat Barker, Peter Carey, Hilary Mantel, William Golding, Angela Carter, and a writer he returns to several times and who is, I feel, one of the very best novelists of the last half-century, Barry Unsworth) or whose work I’ve only dipped in to and feel I need to study more (J.L. Carr, Toni Morrison, Jim Crace, Sarah Moss). It’s a book that makes you excited about books, there’s a feast of stuff here I want to grab immediately and read all at once.\n\nNot that Kemp is uncritical; far from it. You can tell his favourites (Unsworth, A.S. Byatt), but he is not afraid to turn a sharp critical attention upon writers usually considered critical darlings. Salman Rushdie: “For an author who attaches such significance to storytelling, Rushdie is curiously inept at telling stories.” Jeanette Winterson: “Amid a jumble of researched scientific data that characters reel out, the basic lineaments of Mary Shelley’s Gothic fable — science over-reaching itself, hubris hideously punished, malformed loneliness tragically wreaking havoc — get peculiarly garbled.” Margaret Drabble: “This dismissal of psychological fiction and Freudian thinking comes strangely in a trilogy whose most pervasive character is a psychiatrist.” There are skewering one-liners all through the book which contribute immensely to its liveliness, the sense that some great novelists and some not-so-great novelists are producing work that we really should be paying attention to, and conversely that there are supposedly great novelists who should be paying more attention to their work.\n\nPeter Kemp is a reviewer for the Sunday Times and the author of books on Muriel Spark and H.G. Wells, a background which, you might think, might open him to writing that doesn’t follow a straightforwardly realist model. And it does, but not in the way you might think. The second of the five parts that make up this book concentrates on the fictions that show how an individual’s past shapes their present. One of the examples of this motif is the way childhood trauma, and particularly child abuse, are repeatedly shown to lie behind the darkness in a character. He presents several fictional examples of this, but as I was reading it I kept thinking how frequently I have seen this pattern in crime fiction, it is, for instance, a regular feature in John Banville’s Benjamin Black novels, and yet neither Black nor crime fiction more generally feature among his examples. Crime fiction does appear in the book, but usually in other forms, the historical crime fiction of C.J. Sansom, Steven Saylor, or Lindsey Davis, for example.\n\nUnexpectedly, science fiction fares better. But that is partly because so many otherwise mainstream novelists have ventured into the form. And where science fiction does appear it is usually from writers not normally identified as science fiction authors: Martin Amis, P.D. James, Kazuo Ishiguro, Angela Carter. He is never dismissive of sf, and it clearly forms part of his overall vision of literature, but you get a sense of unease when he ventures into the territory. He spends some time discussing Ronald Wright’s updating of The Time Machine, A Scientific Romance (and he is clearly besotted with Wells’s original), but his reading of the book felt slightly off to me. He is outside his comfort zone, but at least he is willing to give it a go.\n\nThere is, I am sure, no such thing as a perfect book about literature. Any such book depends upon the taste and interest of the author, and a reading list that can at best only be partial. Though I suspect that it is such partiality (in both senses of the word) that is what makes these books interesting to me. And this is a pretty good example of the form.\n\nA few years ago, John Banville wrote a bonkers and brilliant alternate history novel called The Infinities, which I reviewed here. It was a strange novel, apparently narrated by a minor god, and set primarily during the last day of a famous mathematician whose work has proved the existence of multiple realities.\n\nNow there is a sequel, The Singularities, set some time after the death of that mathematician, Adam Godley, but concerning the arrival of an American academic who has been commissioned to write Godley’s biography. It is a situation that seems particularly suited to the generally oblique approach of Banville’s storytelling, the prose consisting more of evasions and hesitations than it does of direct, straightforward statements. As when the biographer approaches his task:\n\nTake a breath and make a start, any start. It can’t be so difficult, if others do it all the time, and they do, apparently with the greatest ease, unless they’re pretending, which I know is perfectly possible, the world being what it is and the people in it being what they are. But still.\n\nBut we must remember that this writer is called Jaybey, a name that none too subtly incorporates the initials of the author, and it seems that the lesser god who may or may not have recounted Godley’s story in the previous volume has been replaced by the lesser god that is the author. And the authorial perspective, the looking down upon those who must obey the strictures of being written, is important to the shaping of this novel.\n\nAs I said in my review of The Infinities, Banville is on record as saying that all of his books are volumes in a single, over-arching novel. A claim that calls to mind the way some writers, like Asimov and Heinlein, attempted to tie together all of their work into a single if incoherent timeline. But Banville is suggesting something a little more subtle than that, the works belong not in the same timeline but in parallel, interconnected timelines, they belong within the same consciousness if not within the same reality. And that notion seems to be made concrete in this novel, because if Godley’s multiple realities are to be accepted, then there is access to the multiple realities of Banville’s other novels.\n\nThe story opens with a prisoner released from gaol: “he has come to the end of his sentence, but does that mean he has nothing more to say?” A former cellmate has arranged for him to have the loan of a hire car, which he takes under the name of Mordaunt, but we know this is not his name. I recognised him from the start, but Banville doesn’t believe in making things too plain so it is only late in the novel that his identity is confirmed as Freddie Montgomery, the murderer who told his story in The Book of Evidence (1989). In his borrowed car, Mordaunt is on his way to the west coast of Ireland, to the house where he was brought up. But that house is the home of the Godley family, and nobody there, or in the nearby town, has any memory of Montgomery or his parents ever living in the area. The two realities intersect (Montgomery/Mordaunt knows the house, he recognises it intimately) but they do not overlap.\n\nBut Montgomery is not the only refugee from earlier, seemingly unconnected Banville novels to wash up in this story. I found teasing echoes of Shroud (2002), and also, perhaps, of Eclipse (2000) which already intersects with Shroud, and maybe Ghosts (1993) which intersects with The Book of Evidence. There is even one fascinating interlude which contains allusions to Banville’s early historical science novels, Doctor Copernicus (1976), Kepler (1981), The Newton Letter (1982) and Mefisto (1986). Understand, none of this is explicit; we know that Mordaunt is Montgomery, but otherwise the links are allusive, sly, more suggestion than statement, because that is the way Banville writes. To be honest I kept waiting for Quirke to show up, but it’s not that kind of novel.\n\nAnd in the end, the multiple singularities that bring so many Banville characters together even if they don’t belong together, where does it leave us? Ah, it leaves us with the writer: “the steel tip advances along the line, with a tiny secret sound all of its own, scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch, and a the last makes a last stab, to mark a full, an infinitely full, stop.” The singularity is the black circle at the end of the text that takes us through the wormhole back, explicitly, or at least as explicitly as Banville ever can be, back to The Infinities.\n\nI first came across John Banville sometime in the mid-1970s when his novel Kepler came out. I bought the hardback, loved it (I reviewed a subsequent reprint of the book), and since then I have read just about everything he has written. There are few contemporary writers I keep up with as assiduously I do Banville (Graham Swift and William Boyd come to mind), but his work is incredibly various. The historical ones, (Kepler, Doctor Copernicus), were vivid and convincing; his novel based on Anthony Blunt, The Untouchable, is sharp and engaging; but others, such as his Booker Prize winner, The Sea, seem to me so etiolated that you have to fight your way through a fog of allusive prose to find out what didn’t happen.\n\nI have seen Banville speak a couple of times, once specifically on Georges Simenon. I can’t think of two more different writers than the author of The Sea and the author of Maigret, and yet there was an obvious connection between the two. So it was no great surprise that he started writing crime novels under the pseudonym Benjamin Black, starting with Christine Falls in 2006. The Black novels are hardly Simenonesque, the prose, while tighter than some of his John Banville novels, is still a lot looser, more elaborate, than you are likely to find in Simenon. But in these novels plot is to the fore, and they are indeed good plot-driven stories.\n\nMost, though by no means all, of the Benjamin Black novels feature an alcoholic Dublin pathologist, Quirke. And they are interconnected in the way that they use the crime as a way of digging into the abusive control of 1950s Dublin society by the Catholic Church, and the corruption of the political class sheltering behind the power of the Church. This is an impoverished, grey Dublin where the physical and sexual abuse of children in Church-run orphanages and schools is an accepted part of life. There are few if any characters in the Benjamin Black novels who are not in some way damaged by the very society they inhabit.\n\nBanville made no secret that he and Benjamin Black were one and the same. The books tended to declare on the cover: By John Banville writing as Benjamin Black. It was rather like the difference between Iain Banks and Iain M. Banks: the two names allowed the author to take different liberties with their writing.\n\nThen, a year ago, a new John Banville novel appeared: Snow. And it was a crime novel, indeed it was a very distinctive Benjamin Black novel, yet the name Black appeared nowhere on it. It was a crime novel set in 1950s Ireland, and though there is a new central character, the rather austere and lonely protestant, Detective Inspector Strafford, Quirke does get a passing mention. And it is a novel that features corruption in high places, and the malign influence of the Church.\n\nNow there is what is advertised as a new Strafford novel, April in Spain. Only Strafford doesn’t even appear until more than half way through the book, and even then mostly plays a supporting role. The central character is Quirke, and the story itself is a direct sequel, set four years later, to the third of the Benjamin Black Quirke novels, Elegy for April (2011). In that earlier novel, incest within the family of a prominent government minister results in a boy admitting to murdering his sister, April, and then committing suicide. Now, reluctantly on holiday in Spain with his new wife, Quirke encounters a doctor at the local hospital and recognizes her as April.\n\nQuirke immediately telephones his daughter, Phoebe, who had been a friend of April’s. Phoebe tells the Dublin police, who arrange that Detective Inspector Strafford should travel out to Spain with her to confirm the identification, and to try to discover why her brother had confessed to her murder. But Phoebe also tells April’s uncle, the cabinet minister, which is why a one-time associate of the Kray twins is also heading out to Spain with a gun.\n\nThis is not a novel in which mysteries are solved, which I suppose brings it closer to earlier John Banville novels. But truths are uncovered, political repercussions are felt, and there are tragedies. It is a gripping novel, I read it in a day which is something I haven’t done much of recently.\n\nCuriously, I notice that the John Banville Bibliography on Wikipedia does not list Snow, and counts April in Spain as a Benjamin Black novel, which it explicitly is not. Clearly some people are still confused by the identities of Banville and Black.\n\nWay back in the late-1970s (coincidentally, about the time I was myself starting, hesitantly and awkwardly, to write book reviews) Phil Stephenson-Payne persuaded the BSFA to run his personal review zine as a sort of adjunct to the BSFA’s own critical magazine, Vector. Even though it was published under the auspices of the BSFA, Stephenson-Payne still seemed to regard the tweely-named Paperback Parlour as his own personal fanzine. One copy reached me with a scrawled note asking to exchange it for a copy of my own fanzine at the time.\n\nAround the end of the decade, the BSFA seem to have decided to take the fanzine entirely in-house. Paperback Parlour acquired a new editor, Joseph Nicholas, and a new, more aggressive, title, Paperback Inferno (this was, remember, the heyday of the so-called KTF – Kill The Fuckers – school of fanzine reviewing). In that form, Paperback Inferno, first under Nicholas and later under Andy Sawyer, lasted well into the 1990s before it was reabsorbed into Vector.\n\nThe other day, sorting through some old boxes, I came across my stash of old Paperback Infernos. It was a curious and not always comfortable experience to leaf through them. There were a number of my reviews in there, of course, but fewer than I remember. And there are books I reviewed, and even authors, of whom I have no memory whatsoever – Joan Cox? Russell M. Griffin? – and even reviews of books I would have sworn, if asked, that I had never read.\n\nAt various times during the sporadic lifetime of this blog I have used it to republish old reviews of mine, specifically those that otherwise had no online existence. So the obvious question to ask myself when I rediscovered these ancient reviews was whether I should republish them here. And in the vast majority of cases the equally obvious answer was: no. Paperback Inferno was never a venue for the long and thoughtful consideration, most of the reviews were around 200-300 words, and to be honest have no lasting interest, even to me. But one or two longer pieces did appear, including the one I’ve republished below.\n\nPlease note, I make no great claims for this review as a review. There are places where I winced at how poorly written it is, the prose is often clumsy and the critical analysis I would do very differently were I to approach the same book today. And yet, from a personal historical point of view, it is interesting, to me at least.\n\nIt appeared in the August 1983 issue of Paperback Inferno, that is just over five years after my very first review was published in the January 1978 issue of Vector. In those five years, practically everything I wrote was around the 400-500 word mark, often less. But this review is over 1,100 words, twice the length of anything I had written to that point. Was I making a point, proving to myself that I could write at greater length? I don’t know. I have no memory of writing this review, and if asked I would have said it was some years after this that I started writing longer reviews. There are two clues I can draw from this review. The first is that I bought the book in hardback when it first appeared in 1976, and read it straight away. It was the book that introduced me to the work of John Banville, and I have been a devoted fan of his work ever since. I don’t know if there was a (belated) paperback edition in 1983, but the re-read I mention in the first sentence of the review would have been of the hardback. The second clue is that I make a repeated point of saying that the novel is not science fiction (looking back now I recall that at around this time, the late-70s and early-80s, there was a lot of mainstream historical fiction that dealt with scientific subjects, fiction about science if not science fiction, but curiously I make no mention of this in the review). It is, therefore, a very early iteration of my continued interest in the borderlands rather than the heartlands of science fiction. It is strange and oddly satisfying to see this theme, this interest, crop up so early in what I laughingly call my career. But that means it is not a review that is likely to have been commissioned; it is, therefore, something I wrote on spec, out of my enthusiasm for the book. Which may be why I felt called upon, and able, to go on at such length.\n\nThe book (have I not mentioned it up to now?) is Kepler by John Banville, one of my favourite novels by one of my favourite novelists. This review does not do it justice, just as it doesn’t really do me justice, but it is interesting to see how early the seeds were planted.\n\nA mischievous thought occurred to me as I was rereading Kepler: is it science fiction? It is, after all, fiction about science. Indeed, so central is the science that without it there would be to fiction. Yet I cannot see SF fans welcoming it to the hallowed ground of the ghetto. However, no one should miss this book simply because it doesn’t fit into some favoured pigeonhole.\n\nKepler is a book that defies categorisation. It is not, of course, science fiction. In SF, the “science” element provides the setting for the fiction; in Kepler, the science forms part of the plot, and even the characterisation. But nor does it conform to the usual pattern of an historical novel. It is, I suppose, a form of fictionalised biography, but though it gives a remarkably vivid portrait of Kepler, no one should turn to it expecting to find the facts of his life on neat and unambiguous display.\n\nIn fact, the overall success of the book is made up of a host of successes in many different areas. To attempt to pigeonhole it in any way would be impossible. One of the reasons I take such delight in it is that it crosses all borders with such insouciant ease and to such devastating effect. Banville, in other words, has written a fine novel about science; an atmospheric novel about a particularly dramatic period in history; a sharply perceptive novel of character – and they are all together in this one book.\n\nAt its heart, of course, is Johannes Kepler. It may seem an easy thing to take a real person and put him in a novel, but many good writers have come a cropper doing just that. The known facts about a person’s life and career, the imposed chronology of recorded events, can rob the author of the creative impetus necessary to bring the character to life. It is a measure of Banville’s achievement, therefore, that he has not only managed to breathe life into his Kepler but also made him one of the most vivid characters I have encountered in any novel.\n\nTruth to tell, I don’t think I would have liked to have known Banville’s Kepler: he is sickly, obsessive, self-centred, tactless, weak, obstinate, proud, brilliant; yet he commands our attention and sympathy throughout the book. He feels that anyone who does not support him has betrayed him, yet we are made to feel, too, that he deserved much more support than he got. He has an inflated sense of his own worth, boasting that he will solve the problem of the orbit of Mars in just seven days; yet when, seven years later, he does solve this tricky problem he not only reveals his true genius but also revolutionises our world-view. He is a mass of contradictions, but we are shown how the many facets of his character relate to each other and add up to one all too human man.\n\nBanville has a special ability to create character and is unstinting with it. Many of the secondary characters are nearly as vivid as Kepler himself: Barbara, his wife, who nags him and has no real comprehension of his work; his infuriating mother, who dabbles in witchcraft; and above all the gross, Falstaffian figure of Tycho Brahe. Nevertheless, it is Kepler himself who holds the book together, and it is through him that Banville manages what I consider to be the most remarkable achievement of the book: he makes clear the nature of Kepler’s discoveries and the scale of his achievement, he fits the discoveries into the pattern of contemporary belief, and he conveys the excitement of the discoveries.\n\nScience rarely fares well in the hands of novelists. Theory, and the patient sifting of minutiae that form such an important part of scientific method, do not make for great drama, and on the few occasions when they do appear in fiction they tend to be passed over quickly or else are just plain dull. That is not the case here. My knowledge of and interest in science is virtually non-existent, yet throughout the book I had no difficulty in understanding the development of Kepler’s ideas and found myself as excited as he at each new discovery.\n\nBanville is able to do this because by showing each step in the process in the context of contemporary belief he is able to set up a conflict. Right from the start, we are shown that the impulse driving Kepler to study the stars is a search for order and harmony in a world and a life that are far from orderly and harmonious. In this, Banville recreates with masterly brevity a very convincing picture of daily life in Europe at the time of the Thirty Years War. Kepler’s quest for harmony leads him to posit the idea that the intervals between the planets correspond to the sequence of regular shapes – triangle, square, pentagon, and so on. The neatness and elegance of this theory so entrances Kepler that his later and major discovery that the planets follow elliptical rather than circular paths conflicts dramatically with his earlier and favoured belief.\n\nThe whole is presented in a rich and pleasing prose that is absolutely littered with fresh and delightful metaphors. There is a studied disregard for chronology, sending the story off on flashback after flashback, and flashbacks within flashbacks, which enable the sense of the character to be conveyed far better than any mere record of events. There are even audacious little stylistic tricks that work surprisingly well, far better than they have any right to. Around the middle of the novel, Banville suddenly presents us with a series of letters from Kepler to a variety of correspondents covering some seven years. Then he balances this with a second series of letters, in reverse chronological order, from Kepler to those same correspondents. In each case it is obvious that. Kepler has received a letter in the interim, and the pairs of letters neatly present different sides of his character, by turns braggadocio and injured pride, confidence and uncertainty, anger and hurt. It is a remarkably effective device.\n\nOne other aspect of this diverse and hugely enjoyable novel should not be overlooked: its humour. There is a constant thread of comedy running through the book, in the situations, the characters, the dialogue, and in the occasional joke that Banville slips in. I particularly enjoyed the way, towards the end, he suddenly and very briefly introduces two Scandinavian relatives of Tycho Brahe, “Holger Rosenkrands the statesman’s son and the Norwegian Axel Gyldenstjern”, who invite Kepler to join them on their mission to England. Perhaps wisely, he declines.\n\nKepler is a novel that cannot be accurately or conveniently summed up in one slick phrase. But it is a novel that sets out to be many things and succeeds in just about all of them. I hold little hope for anyone who. cannot find something to enjoy in it.\n\nI’ve been neglecting this blog recently: too busy keeping up with too much reading for the Campbell Award. It’s frustrating, I’ve got a couple of biggish things in my mind to write here, and by the time the decks are clear enough to do so I’m sure the inspiration will have faded, or I’ll have forgotten why on earth I wanted to write about that.\n\nBut here’s a brief thought, as a place holder if nothing more.\n\nThe first episode of Civilizations has Simon Schama talking about the origins of human art, and eventually he comes down to something like: “This is art because it is beautiful!” It’s the sort of floundering generalization we all make at some time or other: art equals beauty, art is the creation of beauty, if it’s beautiful it must be art. And yes, some art, quite a lot of visual art, is beautiful. But not all. Some art is ugly, deliberately so; some art is making a point or telling a story, and whether or not it is beautiful is irrelevant to whether it is art; and our ideas about what constitutes beauty change in ways that our ideas of what constitutes art do not change.\n\nThe latest issue of The New York Review of Books has an interesting article by John Banville about Oscar Wilde. Inevitably it raises the idea that first came to prominence among the exquisites, the belle lettrists, the romantics of the late-Victorian age: Art for Art’s sake. It is a resonant phrase that was still current in my youth, and for all I know is still current in some artistic quarters today. It is, of course, an abdication; it is Walter Pater and the aesthetics, and their peers and descendants throwing up their arms in defeat and crying: we don’t know what art is and we don’t know what it’s for, but we know it should be for something. (Following Carlyle, the Victorians were great believers that everything should be for some social or moral good, a viewpoint we’ve still not shaken off.) So, art is its own purpose.\n\nBut that is surely missing the point. Art is many things. It is the glorious and tiny carved female head that Schama was looking at when he declared: this is beautiful and therefore this is art. It is the song I haltingly pick out on my guitar. It is the seering dystopian novel I am currently reading. It is the broad comedy of Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest. It is painting and scrimshaw and poetry and dance and film and theatre and prose and …\n\nAnd just as there is nothing that binds these various forms into a whole (they are certainly not all beautiful), so there is no one reason why we engage in creating or consuming these various arts. Yes, we might want to create beauty, or it is to exercise a skill, or to make a political point, or to express a spiritual belief, or to make money, or all of these or none of them.\n\nI said, long ago, that science fiction is indefinable because it is not one thing, though the various strands that make up science fiction are loosely linked by family resemblances. That is an idea I stole from Ludwig Wittgenstein who argued, in Philosophical Investigations, that sport is indefinable because it is not one thing, but various sports are loosely linked by family resemblances. And the same, surely, is true of art. We shouldn’t try and define art because it is indefinable, it is not one thing. A painting, such as Philip Evergood’s “Dance Marathon” from 1934, may have family resemblances to a film, such as Sydney Pollack’s They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? from 1969; but there are other things (not least the medium) that divide them.\n\nAnd this is a good thing. All these things, art and sport and science fiction, are the more interesting precisely because they are so malleable, so imprecise, so various. There are as many science fictions as there are readers and practitioners of the form; there are as many sports as there are sports people and spectators; there are as many arts as there are artists and writers and film makers and photographers and people who enjoy and appreciate and benefit from these paintings and stories and movies and pictures. That is why art is so important to us; because in all its multifarious forms it is never speaking to the many but to the one, to me. And it speaks in many languages. You and I may experience the same piece of art, and what it says to you cannot be precisely what it says to me.\n\nThat is why it is art. That is what art is for: not for its own sake, not for any quantifiable social benefit, not for any religious or political purpose, but because in art something expressed to the many speaks uniquely to me.\n\nThere is a congruence in the latest issue of the London Review of Books (4 January 2018) that I find interesting and instructive.\n\nIn the final paragraph of his review of Philip Pullman’s La Belle Sauvage, Colin Burrow remarks:\n\nA great work of fantasy involves testing and advancing the physical and moral laws of a new world; and a great part of the pleasure of reading a book set in an alternative world lies in seeing an author discovering a possibility that stretches the boundaries of the imagined world without wrecking its internal coherence. Writing a prequel to that kind of elastic imagining is exceptionally hard, because so many of the rules have already been invented and cannot be subjected to creative strain, let alone broken. (8)\n\nOn the facing page, almost exactly parallel to this passage, in a review of Mrs Osmond, John Banville’s sort-of sequel to The Portrait of a Lady by Henry James, Michael Wood says:\n\nBut the straightforward concept of a sequel tends to literalise the story that went before it, as if it were a solid historical structure rather than a fiction – that is, the reflection of a whole map of choices and inventions. (9)\n\nAnd there you have it, as neat an encapsulation as you could wish of the fact that prequels and sequels are bound by the same iron chains. An original work of fiction is an “elastic imagining”, a “map of choices and inventions”. But once those inventions are set in stone, the sequel or prequel is restricted in what creativity it can bring to the fiction. The prequel has to work towards a known end-point, within circumstances already established by the fiction which it approaches. A sequel has to continue from a known starting point, within circumstances already established by the fiction it is building upon. To change what is known, to reinvent those circumstances, would not necessarily damage the particular prequel or sequel, but it risks irreparable damage to the original.\n\nBut if you are working within those strictures, then you are voluntarily abandoning much of the invention that made the original work worthy of a prequel or sequel.\n\nThere are other links in this imprisoning chain that neither Burrow nor Wood specifically reference (though they are, perhaps, implicit in the bodies of their reviews): that what prompts a prequel or sequel in the first place is often a strange love affair between the readers and the original book. I love such-and-such a character. I love such-and-such a world. This is both the major reason why sequels and prequels get written, and the thing that most encumbers the author. Because it is necessary to retain and often to repeat what is loved, otherwise the whole exercise is futile. This is why the later volumes in some long-standing series read as though they are simply checklists: this is the point where character A is loveable, this is where character B repeats her catchphrase, this is where character C repeats his catchphrase, this is where character D proves she is secretly a goody, this is where character E saves the day again.\n\nThere remains a market for such works, because there is clearly an enthusiastic readership who like to be reminded of what they loved in previous volumes. I am not part of that market. In the main I find prequels and sequels creatively stultifying.\n\nI must be careful here: this is not intended as a blanket condemnation. Multi-volume works that were conceived and intended as a single work, such as Gene Wolfe’s The Book of the New Sun or, perhaps, John Crowley’s Aegypt (though I think here the original conception continued to change and grow over the 20 years of its execution), don’t fit the pattern. Here the invention of the first volume and the invention of the last volume are part of the same enterprise.\n\nNor am I saying that it is impossible to write a good sequel. The third volume of Dave Hutchinson’s Fractured Europe sequence, Europe in Winter, is, I think a better novel than the first volume, Europe in Autumn. Though at the same time I think Europe in Autumn, which was not intended to have any sequels when originally written, is the volume that contains the most invention, the most science-fictional creativity.\n\nThe trouble is that what I look for in science fiction is creativity, invention, novelty; what I see in the vast majority of sequels and prequels is the exact opposite of that, familiarity and repetition. What Colin Burrow and Michael Wood do, separately and in their congruence (which is, I’m sure, not entirely coincidental), is to point out that to take on a belated sequel or prequel is to voluntarily don a straightjacket, a set of limitations and restrictions laid out by the very cause of the sequel or prequel, the original work.\n\nAs it happens, both Burrow and Wood conclude that their respective subjects, Pullman and Banville, manage to avoid being entirely constricted by their chosen form. It can be done. But it is rare; rarer than the continuous churn of sequels and prequels might lead us to imagine. It is a hard thing to do successfully, it requires bravery, spirit, and probably more invention than the original. Which is why it should be the exception rather than the rule.\n\nAnd that is why I look with jaundiced and dubious eye on anything that proclaims itself the new addition to the X universe, the further adventures of Y, a long-awaited return to Z …\n\nWhy should I want to go there again when there are always new places, unknown places, awaiting my attention?"
