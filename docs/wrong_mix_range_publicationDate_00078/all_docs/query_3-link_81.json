Satellites on the ring are in geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO). Those in the dense web near the Earth are in low earth orbit (LEO). Scattered in between are satellites in medium earth orbits (MEO). The most prominant of these are the constellation of GPS satellites. The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is approximately nine times farther from the Earth than the ring of geosynchronous satellites.\n\nbinary systems\n\nCircular motion about the center of mass\n\nStill just a balance between centripetal and gravitational force, but slightly more complicated\n\nLagrange points\n\nThe three body problem. Lagrange libration points are the simplest solutions (sometimes called Lagrangian points or just Lagrange points).\n\nStill just a balance between centripetal and gravitational forces, but now more complicated\n\nThe five Lagrange points of the Earth-Sun system. Satellites in orbit at these locations remain fixed with respect to the Earth and Sun. This figure is not drawn to scale.\n\nL1 and L2 are approximately four times farther from the Earth than the Moon. L3 is a near the \"anti-Earth\" point.\n\nL4 and L5 are at the vertex of an equilateral triangle formed with the Earth and Sun. L4 leads the Earth and L5 follows.\n\nParaphrase needed: Objects can settle in an orbit around a Lagrange point. Orbits around the three collinear points, L1, L2, and L3, are unstable. They last but days before the object will break away. L1 and L2 last about 23 days. Objects orbiting around L4 and L5 are stable because of the Coriolis force.\n\nL1\n\nArtificial satellites between the Sun and Earth\n\nInternational Cometary Explorer (ICE), 1978.

Provides advanced warning of potentially adverse space weather events and monitors the environment of the Earth on a hemispheric scale. DSCOVR spent ten years locked in storage for dumb-assed political reasons. Originally known as Triana (in honor of Rodrigo de Triana, the first member of Columbus's crew to spot America). Derisively known as the \"GoreSat\" and a \"multimillion-dollar screen saver\" by political opponents of US Vice President Al Gore. (Al Gore was a proponent of DSCOVR during the time he was a presidential candidate.)\n\nLISA Pathfinder, 2015? LISA stands for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. Originally named Small Missions for Advanced Research in Technology 2 (SMART 2). The LISA Pathfinder mission is one component of the larger LISA project to look for low-frequency gravitational waves.\n\nKuafu Project (å¤¸ç¶è¨å), 2017? A Chinese space weather monitoring system composed of three satellites. Kuafu A will be placed at L1. Kuafu B1 and B2 will be placed in polar orbits. The project is named after Kua Fu (å¤¸ç¶), a giant in Chinese mythology who died trying to catch the Sun. Autotranslators translate Kua Fu (å¤¸ç¶) as \"braggadocio\" or \"boast father\".\n\nGlobal Sunshade.

STEREO A (for ahead) is approaching L4 and STEREO B (for behind) is approaching L5. STEREO is an acronym for Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory. We want to encourage good relations between the Sun and the Earth.\n\nSpitzer Space Telescope, 2013â2015. Was in an approximate L5 orbit (an Earth trailing orbit).\n\nEarth-Moon (as opposed to Sun-Earth)\n\nThe L4 and L5 points in the Earth-Moon system have been proposed as prime locations for large \"cities in space\". The most famous proponent of such proposals was the American physicist Gerard K. O'Neill (1927â1992) who wrote a popular book on the subject in 1977 filled with fantastic illustrations called The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space (paid link).\n\nCo-orbital states\n\nPrograde, orbiting in the same general direction as the planet\n\nThe body goes through a cycle of catching up and falling behind the planet. This makes it appear to change direction in the planet's frame of reference\n\nHorseshoe orbit\n\n3753 Cruithne oscillates back and forth between the Earth's L4 and L5 points (passing through L3 in the middle) once every 770 years. The orbit appears circular in the Sun's frame of reference but horseshoe shaped (or c-shaped) in the Earth's. Every 385 years it comes to within 15 million kilometers of Earth. The last time was 1900. The next will be 2285.\n\n2002 AA29, 2006 JY26, 2010 SO16, 2013 BS45\n\nTadpole orbit\n\nAn apparent orbit around L4 or L5. Elliptical when viewed from the Sun, but tadpole shaped (or comma shaped) when viewed from the Earth.\n\nWhen the orbits of two bodies have different eccentricities but similar periods (1:1 orbital resonance), the one on the more elliptical orbit appears to loop around the one with the more circular orbit\n\nQuasi-satellites\n\nVenus: 2002 VE68\n\nEarth: 2001 GO2, 2003 YN107, 2004 GU9, 2006 FV35, 2013 LX28, 2014 OL339, 2016 HO3\n\nNeptune: 2007 RW10\n\nPluto: 15810 Arawn\n\nRetrograde, orbiting in a direction opposite that of the planet\n\nTrisectrix (limaÃ§on). A type of roulette curve that crosses itself once resulting in a smaller, more elliptical loop inside a larger, more circular loop.\n\n2015 BZ509\n\nnoncircular orbits\n\nqualitative description of noncircular orbits\n\ncentripetal-gravitational forces don't balance\n\nuses\n\nMolniya orbit\n\nDeveloped for coverage of areas above 60Â° (?) latitude. Typically uses three satellites in an unusually elliptical orbit. Each satellite rotates into the farthest point from Earth, where it spends about 8 (?) hours. The satellite obeys Kepler's second law of planetary motion, so the speed at this point is low. If the period of the satellite is set just right, the satellite will appear relatively motionless during this period.\n\nHohmann transfer orbit, opportunities\n\nThe point in an orbit where the engines are fired becomes a point in a new orbit. The burn point is an intersection between the old and new orbits, a point of common tangency in most cases. The burn must occur where the current and desired orbits intersect.\n\nOrbital Mechanics I"
