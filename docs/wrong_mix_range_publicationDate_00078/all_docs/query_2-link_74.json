        "text": "It is, perhaps, a bit absurd to put a review of this book in my homepage, but I'm of the opinion that absurdity is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nCliff writes the first high-visibility book questioning the sanity of the panacea status being accorded the net in particular and computers in general. The book could have been half as long, but Cliff is interesting enough to listen to to keep me going through the chatty bits.\n\nWe who are used to enthusiastically embracing intriguing what-ifs from the marketers and advocates of high techiness need to think about this book long enough to get over any inclination to take Cliff's barbs personally. We have grown dangerously eager to accept a computerized solution to any problem as the logical course even when there are more appropriate low-tech solutions to the problem. And to accept incomplete or flawed computerized solutions as the only ones even when the job could be done better."
