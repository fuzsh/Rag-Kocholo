        "text": "Owing to the screen size of your device, you may obtain a better viewing experience by rotating your device a quarter-turn (to get the so-called “panorama” screen view).\n\n“‘What is the use of a book,’ thought Alice, ‘without pictures or conversations?’”\n\n– Alice in Wonderland,\n\nLewis Carroll\n\nAbout This List\n\nThis books-by-title page is not, nor is it meant to be, a list of every good science-fiction and fantasy book: it is a list of the science-fiction and fantasy books that I know and like. Omission of a given book may mean I didn’t think highly enough of it to include it—or it may simply mean that, even in two-thirds of a century of science-fiction and fantasy reading, I still haven’t gotten to that book (as I say in several places on this site, that is especially likely to be true of books from the last decade or two, when annual science-fiction and fantasy title-publication totals have been staggering).\n\n(I have now added a couple of other lists to try to minimize that gap: one is books yet unread here but by authors already in these lists, the other—working from what I hope to be reputable critical sources—books yet-unread here by authors not yet in these lists but recommended by those reliable—one hopes—other sources.)\n\nEach book title on the list below is a link to the availability listings for it at AbeBooks; every author name is a link to a page here about that author. Those author pages each contain the same list of the author’s books as do the books-by-author pages, plus a brief discussion of the author and of those books (warning: not all the discussions are in place yet, though all the pages—and book lists thereon—are). Those discussions are not profound analyses: they are meant to help you rank the authors and books on your personal “to-read” list.\n\nNote also that this list includes some books that are not on the actual main science-fiction & fantasy authors/books list—those extras are other books mentioned here and there on this site—books about authors here, books of speculative-fiction criticism, books about specfic art, books that are almost fantasies, and various other odds and ends. Every book referenced anywhere on this site is collected in the list below.\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nThe Actual List:\n\n(The listings are alphabetical by title, except that titles beginning with The, A, or An are listed by the next word in the title.)\n\nTitles beginning with a numeral:\n\n4 3 2 1 by Paul Auster [a “book on the Borderland”—nearly but not quite fantasy]\n\n4 Fantastic Novels by Daniel Pinkwater\n\n5 Novels by Daniel Pinkwater\n\n11/22/1963 by Stephen King [an unsampled work by an established author]\n\nThe 13-1/2 Lives of Captain Bluebear by Walter Moers\n\n25 Years in the Word Mines by Graham Joyce [an unsampled work by an established author]\n\n88 Names by Matt Ruff [an unsampled work by an established author]\n\n253 by Geoff Ryman [an unsampled work by an established author]\n\n334 by Thomas M.
