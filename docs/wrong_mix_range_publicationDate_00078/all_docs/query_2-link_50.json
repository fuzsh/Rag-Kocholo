        "text": "ROGER ZELAZNY\n\nTHE AMBER CHRONICLES\n\n- BOOK EIGHT -\n\nSIGN OF CHAOS\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nI felt vaguely uneasy, though I couldn't say why. It did not seem all that unusual to be drinking with a White Rabbit, a short guy who resembled Bertrand Russell, a grinning Cat, and my old friend Luke Raynard, who was singing Irish ballads while a peculiar landscape shifted from mural to reality at his back. Well, I was impressed by the huge blue Caterpillar smoking the hookah atop the giant mushroom because I know how hard it is to keep a water pipe lit. Still, that wasn't it. It was a convivial scene, and Luke was known to keep pretty strange company on occasion. So why should I feel uneasy?\n\nThe beer was good and there was even a free lunch. The demons tormenting the red-haired woman tied to the stake had been so shiny they'd. hurt to look at. Gone now, but the whole thing had, been beautiful. Everything was beautiful. When Luke sang of Galway Bay it had been so sparkling and lovely that I'd wanted to dive in and lose myself there. Sad, too.\n\nSomething to do with the feeling... Yes. Funny thought. When Luke sang a sad song I felt melancholy. When it was a happy one I was greatly cheered. There seemed an unusual amount of empathy in the air. No matter, I guess. The light. show was superb...\n\nI sipped my drink and watched Humpty teeter, there at the end of the bar. For a moment I tried to remember when I'd come into this place, but that cylinder wasn't hitting. It would come to me, eventually. Nice party....\n\nI watched and listens and tasted and felt, and it was all great. Anything that caught my attention was fascinating. Was there something I'd wanted to ask Luke? It seemed there was, but he was busy singing and I couldn't think of it now, anyway.\n\nWhat had I been doing before I'd come into this place? Trying to recall just didn't seem worth the effort either. Not when everything was so interesting right here and now.\n\nIt seemed that it might have been something important, though. Could that be why I felt uneasy? Might it be there was business I had left unfinished and should be getting back to?\n\nI turned to ask the Cat but he was fading again, still seeming vastly amused. It occurred to me then that I, too, could do that. Fade, I mean; and go someplace else. Was that how I had come here and how I might depart? Possibly. I put down my drink and rubbed my eyes and my temples. Things seemed to be swimming inside my head, too.\n\nI suddenly recalled a picture of me. On a giant card. A Trump. Yes. That was how I'd gotten here. Through the card...\n\nA hand fell upon my shoulder and I turned. It belonged to Luke, who grinned at me as he edged up to the bar for a refill.\n\n\"Great party, huh?\" he said.\n\n\"Yeah, great. How'd you find this place?\" I asked him.\n\nHe shrugged. \"I forget. Who cares?\"\n\nHe fumed away, a brief blizzard of crystals swirling between us. The Caterpillar exhaled a purple cloud. A blue moon was rising.\n\nWhat is wrong with this picture? I asked myself.\n\nI had a sudden feeling that my critical faculty had been shot off in the war, because I couldn't focus on the anomalies I felt must be present. I knew that I was caught up in the moment, but I couldn't see my way clear.\n\nI was caught up...\n\nI was caught...\n\nHow?\n\nWell... It had all started when I'd shaken my own hand. No. Wrong. That sounds like Zen and that's not how it was. The hand I shook emerged from the space occupied by the image of myself on the card that went away. Yes, that was it... After a fashion.\n\nI clenched my teeth. The music began again. There came a soft scraping sound near to my hand on the bar. When I looked I saw that my tankard had been refilled. Maybe I'd had too much already. Maybe that's what kept getting in the way of my thinking. I fumed away. I looked off to my left, past the place where the mural on the wall became the real landscape. Did that make me a part of the mural? I wondered suddenly.\n\nNo matter. If I couldn't think here... I began running... to the left. Something about this place was messing with my head, and it seemed impossible to consider the process while I was a part of it. I had to get away in order to think straight, to determine what was going on.\n\nI was across the bar and into that interface area where the painted rocks and trees became three-dimensional. I pumped my arms as I dug in. I head the wind without feeling it.\n\nNothing that lay before me seemed any nearer. I was moving, but Luke began singing again.\n\nI halted. I turned, slowly, because it sounded as if he were standing practically beside me. He was. I was only a few paces removed from the bar. Luke smiled and kept singing.\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked the Caterpillar. \"You're looped in Luke's loop,\" it replied. \"Come again?\" I said.\n\nIt blew a blue smoke ring, sighed softly, and said, \"Luke's locked in a loop and you're lost in the lyrics. 'That's all.\"\n\n\"How'd it happen?\" I asked.\n\n\"I have no idea,\" it replied.\n\n\"Uh, how does one get unlooped?\"\n\n\"Couldn't tell you that either.\"\n\nI turned to the Cat, who was coalescing about his grin once again.\n\n\"I don't suppose you'd know-\" I began.\n\n\"I saw him come in and I saw you come in later,\" said the Cat, smirking. \"And even for this place your arrivals were somewhat... unusual, leading me to conclude that at least one of you is associated with magic.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Your own comings and goings might give one pause,\" I observed.\n\n\"I keep my paws to myself,\" he replied. \"Which is more than Luke can say.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"He's caught in a contagious trap.\"\n\n\"How does it work?\" I asked.\n\nBut he was gone again, and this time the grin went too.\n\nContagious trap? That seemed to indicate that the problem was Luke's, and that I had been sucked into it in some fashion. This felt right, though it still gave me no idea as to what the problem was or what I might do about it.\n\nI reached for my tankard. If I couldn't solve my problem, I might as well enjoy it. As I took a slow sip I became aware of a strange pair of pale, burning eyes gazing into my own. I hadn't noticed them before, and the thing that made them strange was that they occupied a shadowy comer of the mural across the room from me that, and the fact that they were ,moving, drifting slowly to my left.\n\nIt was kind of fascinating, when I lost sight of the eyes but was still able to follow whatever it was from the swaying of grasses as it passed into the area toward which I had been headed earlier. And far, far off to my right, beyond Luke I now detected a slim gentleman in a dark jacket, palette and brush in hand, who was slowly extending the mural. I took another sip and returned my attention to the progress of whatever it was that had moved from flat reality to 3-D. A gunmetal snout protruded from between a rock and a shrub; the pale eyes blazed above it; blue saliva dripped from the dark muzzle and steamed upon the ground. It was either quite short or very crouched, and I couldn't make up my mind whether it was the entire crowd of us that it was studying or me in particular. I leaned to one side and caught Humpty by the belt or the necktie, whichever it was, just as he was about to slump to the side..\n\n\"Excuse me,\" I said. \"Could you tell me what sort of creature that is?\"\n\nI pointed just as it emerged-many-legged, long-tailed, dark-scaled, undulating, and fast. Its claws were red, and it raised its tail as it raced toward us.\n\nHumpty's bleary eyes moved toward my own, drifted past.\n\n\"I am not here, sir,\" he began, \"to remedy your zoological ignor- My God! It's-\"\n\nIt flashed across the distance, approaching rapidly. Would it reach a spot shortly where its cunning would become a treadmill operation, or had that effect only applied to me on trying to get away from this place?\n\nThe segments of its body slid from side to side, it hissed like a leaky pressure cooker, and steaming slaver marked its trail from the fiction of paint. Rather than slowing, its speed seemed to increase.\n\nMy left hand jerked forward of its own volition and a series of words rose unbidden to my lips. I spoke them just as the creature crossed the interface I had been unable to pierce earlier, rearing as it upset a vacant table and bunching its members as if about to spring.\n\n\"A Bandersnatch!\" someone cried.\n\n\"A frumious Bandersnatch! \" Humpty corrected.\n\nAs I spoke the final word and performed the ultimate gesture, the image of the Logrus swam before my inner vision. The dark creature, having just extended its foremost talons, suddenly drew them back, clutched with them against the upper left quadrant of its breast, rolled its eyes, emitted a soft moaning sound, exhaled heavily, collapsed, fell to the floor, and rolled over onto its back, its many feet extended upward into the air.\n\nThe Cat's grin appeared above the creature. The mouth moved.\n\n\"A dead frumious Bandersnatch,\" it stated.\n\nThe grin drifted toward me, the rest of the Cat occurring about it like an afterthought.\n\n\"That was a cardiac arrest spell, wasn't it?\" it inquired.\n\n\"I guess so,\" I said. \"It was sort of a reflex. Yeah, I remember now. I did still have that spell hanging around.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" it observed. \"I was sure that there was magic involved in this party.\"\n\nThe image of the Logrus which had appeared to me during the spell's operation had also served the purpose of switching on a small light in the musty attic of my mind. Sorcery. Of course.\n\nI, Merlin, son of Corwin, am a sorcerer, of a variety seldom encountered in the areas I have frequented in recent years. Lucas Raynard, also known as Prince Rinaldo of Kashfa, is himself a sorcerer, albeit of a style different than my own. And the Cat, who seemed somewhat sophisticated in these matters, could well have been correct in assessing our situation as the interior of a spell. Such a location is one of the few environments where my sensitivity and training would do little to inform me as to the nature of my predicament. This, because my faculties would also be caught up in the manifestation and subject to 'its forces, if the thing were at all self consistent. It struck me as something similar to color blindness. I could think of no way of telling for certain what was going on, without outside help.\n\nAs I mused over these matters, the King's horses and men arrived beyond the swinging doors at the front of the place. The men entered and fastened lines upon the carcass of the Bandersnatch. The horses dragged the thing off. Humpty had climbed down to visit the rest room while this was going on. Upon his return he discovered that he was unable to achieve his former position atop- the barstool. He shouted to the King's men to give him a hand, but they were busy guiding the defunct Bandersnatch among tables and they ignored him.\n\nLuke strolled up, smiling.\n\n\"So that was a Bandersnatch,\" he observed. \"I'd always wondered what they were like. Now, if we could just get a Jabberwock to stop by-\"\n\n\"Sh!\" cautioned the Cat. \"It must be off 'in the mural somewhere, and likely it's been listening. Don't stir it up! It may come whiffling through the tulgey wood after your ass. Remember the jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Don't go looking for troub-\"\n\nThe Cat cast a quick glance toward the wall and phased into and out of existence several times in quick succession. Ignoring this, Luke remarked, \"I was just thinking of the Tenniel illustration.\"\n\nThe Cat materialized at the far end of the bar, downed the Hatter's drink, and said, \"I hear the burbling, and eyes of flame are drifting to the left.\"\n\nI glanced at the mural, and I, too, saw the fiery eyes and heard a peculiar sound.\n\n\"It could be any of a number of things,\" Luke remarked.\n\nThe Cat moved to a rack behind the bar and reached high up on the wall to where a strange weapon hung, shimmering and shifting in shadow. He lowered the thing and slid it along the bar; it came to rest before Luke.\n\n\"Better have the Vorpal Sword in hand, that's all I can say.\"\n\nLuke laughed, but I stared fascinated at the device which looked as if it were made of moth wings and folded moonlight. .\n\nThen I heard the burbling again.\n\n\"Don't just stand there in uffish thought!\" said the Cat, draining Humpty's glass and vanishing again.\n\nStill chuckling, Luke held out his tankard for a refill. I stood there in uffish thought: The spell I had used to destroy the Bandersnatch had altered my thinking in a peculiar fashion. It seemed for a small moment in its aftermath that things were beginning to come clear in my head. I attributed this to the image of the Logrus which I had regarded briefly. And so I summoned it again.\n\nThe Sign rose before me, hovered. I held it there. I looked upon it. It seemed as if a cold wind began to blow through my mind. Drifting bits of memory were drawn together, assembled themselves into an entire fabric, were informed with understanding. Of course...\n\nThe burbling grew louder and I saw the shadow of the Jabberwock gliding among distant trees, eyes like landing lights, lots of sharp edges for biting and catching...\n\nAnd it didn't matter a bit. For I realized now what was going on, who was responsible, how and why.\n\nI bent over, leaning far forward, so that my knuckles just grazed the toe of my right boot.\n\n\"Luke,\" I said, \"we've got a problem.\"\n\nHe turned away from the bar and glanced down at me.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked.\n\nThose of the blood of Amber are capable of terrific exertions. We are also able to sustain some pretty awful beatings. So, among ourselves, these things tend to cancel out to some degree. Therefore, one must go about such matters just right if one is to attend to them at all...\n\nI brought my fist up off the floor with everything I had behind it, and I caught Luke on the side of the jaw with a blow that lifted him above the ground as it turned him and sent him sprawling across a table which collapsed, to continue sliding backward the length of the entire serving area where he finally came to a crumpled halt at the feet of the quiet Victorian-looking gentleman, who had dropped his paintbrush and stepped away quickly when Luke came skidding toward him. I raised my tankard with my left hand and poured its contents over my right fist, which felt as if I had just driven it against a mountainside. As I did this the lights grew dim and there was a moment of utter silence.\n\nThen I slammed the mug back onto the bartop. The entire place chose that moment in which to shudder, as if from an earth tremor. Two bottles fell from a shelf; a lamp swayed, the burbling grew fainter. I glanced to my left and saw that the eerie shadow of the Jabberwock had retreated somewhat within the tulgey wood. Not only that, the painted section of the prospect now extended a good deal farther into what had seemed normal space, and it looked to be continuing its advance in that direction, freezing that corner of the world into flat immobility. It became apparent from whiffle to whiffle that the Jabberwock was now moving away, to the left, hurrying ahead of the flatness. Tweedledum, Tweedledee, the Dodo, and the Frog began packing their instruments.\n\nI started across the bar toward Luke's sprawled form. The CaterpilIar was disassembling his hookah, and I saw that his mushroom was tilted at an odd angle. The White Rabbit beat it down a hole to the rear, and I head Humpty muttering curses as he swayed atop the bar stool he had just succeeded in mounting.\n\nI saluted the gentleman with the palette as I approached.\n\n\"Sorry to disturb you,'' I said. \"But believe me, this is for the better.\"\n\nI raised Luke's limp form and slung him over my shoulder. A flock of playing cards flew by me. I dew away from them in their rapid passage.\n\n\"Goodness! It's frightened the Jabberwock!\" the man remarked, looking past me.\n\n\"What has?\" I asked, not really certain that I wished to know.\n\n\"That,\" he answered, gesturing toward the front of the bar.\n\nI looked and I staggered back and I didn't blame the Jabberwock a bit.\n\nIt was a twelve-foot Fire Angel that had just enteredrusset-colored, with wings like stained-glass windowsand, along with intimations of mortality, it brought me recollections of a praying mantis, with a spiked collar and thornlike claws protruding through its short fur at every suggestion of an angle. One of these, in fact, caught on and unhinged a swinging door as it came inside. It was a Chaos beast, rare, deadly, and highly intelligent. I hadn't seen one in years, and I'd no desire to see one now; also, I'd no doubt that I was the reason it was here. For a moment I regretted having wasted my cardiac arrest spell on a mere Bandersnatch, until I recalled that Fire Angels have three hearts. I glanced quickly about as it spied me, gave voice to a brief hunting wail, and advanced.\n\n\"I'd like to have had some time to speak with you,\" I told the artist. \"I like your work. Unfortunately-\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"So long.\"\n\n\"Good luck. \"\n\nI stepped down into the rabbit hole and ran, bent far forward because of the low overhead. Luke made my passage particularly awkward, especially on the turns. I heard a scrabbling noise fat to the rear, with a repetition of the hunting wail. I was consoled; however, by the knowledge that the Fire Angel would. actually have to enlarge sections of the tunnel in order to get by. The bad news was that it was capable of doing it. The creatures are incredibly strong and virtually indestructible.\n\nI kept running till the floor dipped beneath my feet.\n\nThen I began falling. I reached out with my free hand to catch myself, but there was nothing to catch hold of. The bottom had fallen out. Good. That was the way I'd hoped and half expected it would be. Luke uttered a single soft moan but did not stir.\n\nWe fell. Down, down, down, like the man said. It was a well, and either it was very deep or we were falling very slowly. There was twilight all about us, and I could not discern die walls of the shaft. My head cleared a bit further, and I knew that it would continue to do so for as long as I kept control of one variable: Luke. High in the air overhead I heard the hunting wail once again. It was followed immediately by a strange burbling sound. Frakir began pulsing softly upon my wrist again, not really telling me anything I didn't already know. So I silenced her again.\n\nClearer yet. I began to remember... My assault on the Keep of the Four Worlds and my recovery of Luke's mother, Jasra. The attack of the werebeast. My odd visit with Vinta Bayle, who wasn't really what she seemed.\n\nMy dinner in Death Alley... The Dweller, San Francisco, the crystal cave... Clearer and clearer.\n\n...And louder and louder the hunting ,wail of the Fire Angel above me. It must have made it through the tunnel and be descending now. Unfortunately, it possessed wings, while all I could do was fall.\n\nI glanced upward. Couldn't make out its form, though. Things seemed darker up that way than down below. I hoped this was a sign that we were approaching something in the nature of a light at the end of the tunnel, as I couldn't think of any other way out. It was too dark to view a Trump or to distinguish enough of the passing scene to commence a shadow shift.\n\nI felt we were drifting now, rather than falling, at a rate that might permit us to land intact. Should it seem otherwise when we neared the bottom, then a possible means of further slowing our descent came to mind, an adaptation of one of the spells I still carried with me.\n\nHowever, these considerations were not worth much should we be eaten on the way down, a distinct possibility, unless of course our pursuer were not all that hungry, in which case it might only dismember us. Consequently, it might become necessary to try speeding up to stay ahead of the beast, which of course would cause us to smash when we hit.\n\nDecisions, decisions.\n\nLuke stirred slightly upon my shoulder. I hoped he wasn't about to come around, as I didn't have time to mess with a sleep-spell and I wasn't really in a good position to slug him again. That pretty much left Frakir.\n\nBut if he were borderline, then choking might serve to rouse him rather than send him back, and I did want him in decent shape. He knew too many things I didn't, things I now needed.\n\nWe passed through a slightly brighter area, and I was able to distinguish the walls of the shaft for the first time and to note that they were covered with graffiti in a language that I did not understand. I was reminded of a strange short story by Jamaica Kincaid, but it bore me no clues for deliverance. Immediately following our passage through that band of illumination, I distinguished a small spot of light far below. At almost the same moment' I heard the wail once again, this time very near.\n\nI looked up in time to behold the Fire Angel passing through the glow. But there was another shape close behind it, and it wore a vest and burbled. The Jabberwock was also on the way down, and it seemed to be making the best time of any of us. The question of its purpose was immediately prominent; as it gained, the circle of light grew and Luke stirred again. This question was quickly answered; however, as it caught up with the Fire Angel and attacked.\n\nThe whiffling, the wailing, and the burbling suddenly echoed down the shaft, along with hissing, scraping, and occasional snarls. The two beasts came together and tore at each other, eyes like dying suns, claws like bayonets, forming a hellish mandala in the pale light which now reached them from below. While this produced a round of activity too near at hand for me to feel entirely at ease, it did serve to slow them to the point where I felt I need not risk an ill-suited spell and an awkward maneuver to emerge from the tunnel in one piece.\n\n\"Argh!\" Luke remarked, turning suddenly within my grasp.\n\n\"I agree,\" I said. \"But lie still, will you? We're about to crash-\"\n\n\"-and burn,\" he stated, twisting his head upward to regard the combatant monsters, then downward when he realized that we were falling, too. \"What kind of trip is this?\"\n\n\"A bad one,\" I answered, and then it hit me: That was exactly what it was.\n\nThe opening was even larger now, and our velocity sufficient for a bearable landing. Our reaction to the spell that I called the Giant's Slap would probably slow us to a standstill or even propel us backward. Better to collect a few bruises than become a traffic obstruction at this point.\n\nA bad trip indeed. I was thinking of Random's words as we passed through the opening at a crazy angle, hit dirt, and rolled.\n\nWe had come to rest within a cave, near to its mouth. Tunnels ran off to the right and the left. The cave mouth was at my back. A quick glance showed it as opening upon a bright, possibly lush, and more than a little outof focus valley. Luke was sprawled unmoving beside me. I got to my feet immediately and caught hold of him beneath the armpits. I began dragging him back away from the dark opening from which we had just emerged. The sounds of the monstrous conflict were very near now.\n\nGood that Luke seemed unconscious again. His condition was bad enough for any Amberite, if my guess were correct. But for one of sorcerous ability it represented a highly dangerous wild card of a sort I'd never encountered before. I wasn't at all certain how I should deal with it.\n\nI dragged him toward the righthand tunnel because it was the smaller of the two and would theoretically be a bit easier to defend. We had barely achieved its shelter when the two beasts fell through the opening, clutching and tearing at each other. They commenced rolling about the floor of the cave, claws clicking, uttering hisses and whistles as they tore at each other. They seemed to have forgotten us entirely; and I continued our retreat until we were well back in the tunnel.\n\nI could only assume Random's guess to be correct. After all, he was a musician and he'd played all over Shadow. Also, I couldn't come up with anything better.\n\nI summoned the Sign of the Logrus. When I had it clear and had meshed my hands with it, I might have used it to strike at the fighting beasts. But they were paying me no heed whatsoever, and I'd no desire to attract their attention. Also, I'd no assurance that the equivalent of being hit by a two-by-four would have much effect on them. Besides, my order was ready, and filling it took precedence.\n\nSo I reached.\n\nIt took an interminable time. There was an extremely wide area of Shadow to pass though before I found what I was looking for. Then I had to do it again. And again. There were a number of things I wanted, and none of them near.\n\nIn the meantime, the combatants showed no sign of slackening, and their claws struck sparks from the cave's walls. They had cut each other in countless places and were now covered with dark gore. Luke had awakened during all of this, propped himself, and was staring fascinated at the colorful conflict. How long it might hold his attention I could not tell. It would be important for me to have him awake very soon now, and I was pleased that he had not started thinking of other matters yet.\n\nI was cheering, by the way, for the Jabberwock. It was just a nasty beast and need not have been homing in on me in particular when it was distracted by the arrival of its exotic nemesis. The Fire Angel had been playing an entirely different game. There was no reason for a Fire Angel to be stalking about this far from Chaos unless it had been sent: They're devilish hard to capture, harder to train, and dangerous to handle. So they represent a considerable expense and hazard. One does not invest in a Fire Angel lightly. Their main purpose in life is killing, and to my knowledge no one outside the Courts of Chaos has ever employed one: They've a vast array of sensessome of them, apparently, paranormal, and they can be used as Shadow bloodhounds. They don't wander through Shadow on their own, that I know of. But a Shadowwalker can be tracked, and Fire Angels seem to be able to follow a very cold trail once they've been imprinted with the victim's identity. Now, I had been trumped to that crazy bar, and I didn't know they could follow a Trump jump, but several other possibilities occurred to me - including someone's locating me, transporting the thing to my vicinity, and turning it loose to do its business. Whatever the means, though, the attempt had the mark of the Courts upon it. Hence, my quick conversion to Jabberwock fandom.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Luke asked me suddenly, and the walls of the cave faded for a moment and I heard a faint strain of music.\n\n\"It's tricky,\" I said. \"Listen, it's time for your medicine.\"\n\nI dumped out a palmful of the vitamin B12 tabs I had just brought in and uncapped the water bottle I had also summoned.\n\n\"What medicine?\" he asked as I passed them to him. \"Doctor's orders,\" I said. \"Get you back on your feet faster. \"\n\n\"Well, okay.\"\n\nHe threw all of them into his mouth and downed them with a single big drink.\n\n\"Now these.\"\n\nI opened the bottle of Thorazine. They were 200 milligrams each and I didn't know how many to give him, so I decided on three. I gave him some tryptophan, too, and some phenylalanine.\n\nHe stared at the pills. The walls faded again, the music returned. A cloud of blue smoke drifted past us. Suddenly the bar came into view, back to whatever passed for normal in that place. The upset tables had been righted, Humpty still teetered, the mural went on.\n\n\"Hey, the club!\" Luke exclaimed. \"We ought to head back. Looks like the party's just getting going.\"\n\n\"First, you take your medicine.\"\n\n\"What's it for?\"\n\n\"You got some bad shit somewhere. This is to let you down easy.\"\n\n\"I don't feel bad. In fact, I feel real good-\"\n\n\"Take it!\"\n\n\"Okay! Okay!\"\n\nHe tossed off the whole fistful.\n\nThe Jabberwock and the Fire Angel seemed to be fading now, and my latest exasperated gesture in the vicinity of the bartop had encountered some resistance, though the thing was not fully solid to me yet. Suddenly, then, I noticed the Cat, whose games with substantiality somehow at this point made it seem more real than anything else in the place.\n\n\"You coming or going?\" it asked.\n\nLuke began to rise. The light grew brighter, though more diffuse.\n\n\"Uh, Luke, look over there,\" I said, pointing\n\n\"Where?\" he asked, turning his head.\n\nI slugged him again.\n\nAs he collapsed, the bar began to fade. The walls of the cave phased back into focus. I heard the Cat's voice. \"Going...\" it said.\n\nThe noises returned full blast, only this time the dominant sound was a bagpipelike squeal. It was coming from the Jabberwock, who was pinned to the ground and being slashed at. I decided then to use the Fourth of July spell I had left over from my assault on the citadel. I raised my hands and spoke the words. I moved in front of Luke to block his view as I did so, and I looked away and squeezed my eyes shut as I said them. Even through closed eyes I could tell there followed a brilliant flash of light. I heard Luke say, ``Hey!\" but all other sounds ceased abruptly. When I looked again I saw that the two creatures lay as if stunned, unmoving, toward the far side of the small cave.\n\nI grabbed hold of Luke's hand and drew him up and over my shoulders in a fireman's carry. Then I advanced quickly into the cave, slipping only once on monster blood as I edged my way along the nearest wall, heading for the cave mouth. The creatures began to stir before I made it out, but their movements were more reflexive than directed. I paused at the opening where I beheld an enormous flower garden in full bloom. All of the flowers were at least as tall as myself, and a shifting breeze bore me an overpowering redolence.\n\nMoments later I heard a more decisive movement at my back and I turned. The Jabberwock was drawing itself to its feet. The Fire Angel was still crouched and was making small piping noises. The Jabberwock staggered back, spreading its wings, then suddenly turned, beat the air, and fled back up the high hole in the cleft at the rear of the cave. Not a bad idea, I decided, as I hurried out into the garden.\n\nHere the aromas were even stronger, the flowers, mostly in bloom, a fantastic canopy of colors as I noshed among them. I found myself panting after a short while, but I jogged on nevertheless. Luke was heavy, but I wanted to put as much distance as I could between ourselves and the cave. Considering how fast our pursuer could move, I wasn't sure there was sufficient time to fool with a Trump yet.\n\nAs I hurried along I began feeling somewhat woozy, and my extremities seemed extremely distant. It occurred to me immediately that the flower smells might be a bit narcotic. Great. That was all I needed, to get caught up in a drug high while trying to bring Luke back from one, I could make out a sill, slightly elevated clearing in the distance, though, and I headed for it. Hopefully, we could rest there for a bit while I regained my mental footing and decided what to do next. So far, I could detect no sounds of pursuit.\n\nRushing on, I could feel myself beginning to reel. My equilibrium was becoming impaired. I suddenly felt a fear of falling, almost akin to acrophobia. For it occurred to me that if I fell I might not be able to rise again, that I might succumb to a drugged sleep and be discovered and dispatched by the creature of Chaos while I dozed. Overhead, the colors of the flowers ran together, flowing and tangling like a mass of ribbons in a bright stream. I tried to control my breathing, to take in as little of the effluvia as possible. But this was difficult, as winded as I was becoming.\n\nBut I did not fall, though I collapsed beside Luke at the center of the clearing after I'd lowered him to the ground. He remained unconscious, a peaceful expression on his face. A wind swept our hillock from the direction of its far side, where nasty-looking, spiked plants of a nonflowering variety grew. Thus, I no longer smelled the seductive odors of the giant flower field, and after a time my head began to clear. On the other hand, I realized that this meant that our own scents were being borne back in the direction of the cave. Whether the Fire Angel could unmask them within the heady perfumes, I did not know, but providing it with even that much of an opportunity made me feel uncomfortable.\n\nYears ago, as an undergraduate, I had tried some LSD. It had scared me so badly that I'd never tried another hallucinogen since. It wasn't simply a bad trip. The stuff had affected my shadow-shifting ability. It is kind of a truism that Amberites can visit any place they can imagine, for everything is out there, somewhere; in Shadow. By combining our minds with motion we can tune for the shadow we desire. Unfortunately, I could not control what I was imagining. Also unfortunately, I was transported to those places. I panicked, and that only made it worse. I could easily have been destroyed, for I wandered through the objectified jungles of my subconscious and passed some time in places where the bad things dwell. After I came down I found my way back home, turned up whimpering on Julia's doorstep, and was a nervous wreck for days. Later, when I told Random about it, I learned that he had had some similar experiences. He had kept it to himself at first as a possible secret weapon against the rest of the family; but later, after they'd gotten back onto decent terms with each other, he had decided to share the information in the interest of survival. He was surprised to learn then that Benedict, Gerard, Fiona, and Bleys knew all about itthough their knowledge -had come from other hallucinogene and, strangely, only Fiona had ever considered its possibility as an in-family weapon. She'd shelved the notion, though, because of its unpredictability. This had been sometime back, however, and in the press of other business in recent years it had slipped his mind; it simply had not occurred to him that a new, arrival such as myself should perhaps be cautioned.\n\nLuke had told me that his attempted invasion of the Keep of the Four Words, by means of a glider-borne commando team, had been smashed. Since I had seen the broken gliders at various points within the walls during my own visit to that place, it was logical to assume that Luke had been captured. Therefore, it seemed a fairly strong assumption that the sorcerer Mask had done whatever had been done to him to bring him to this state. It would seem that this simply involved introducing a dose of a hallucinogen_to his prison fare and turning him loose to wander and look at the pretty lights. Fortunately, unlike myself, his mental travelings had involved nothing more threatening than the brighter aspects of Lewis Carroll. Maybe his heart was purer than mine. But the deal was weird any way you looked at it. Mask might have killed him or kept him in prison or added him to the coatrack collection. Instead, while what had been done was not without risk, it was something which would wear off eventually and leave him chastened but at liberty. It was more a slap on the wrist than a real piece of vengeance. This, for a member of the House which had previously held sway in the Keep and would doubtless like to do so again. Was Mask supremely confident? Or did he not really see Luke as much of a threat?\n\nAnd then there is the fact that our shadow-shifting abilities and our sorcerous abilities come from similar roots, the Pattern or the Logms. It had to be that messing with one also messed with the other. That would explain Luke's strange ability to summon me to him as by a massive Trump sending, when in actuality there was no Trump: His drug-enhanced abilities of visualization must have been so intense that the card's physical representation of me was unnecessary. And his skewed magical abilities would account for all of the preliminary byplay, all of the odd, reality-distorting experiences I'd had before he actually achieved contact. This meant that either of us could become very dangerous in certain drugged states. I'd have to remember that. I hoped he wouldn't wake up mad at me for hitting him, before I could talk to him a bit. On the other hand; the tranquilizer would hopefully keep him happy while the other stuff worked at detoxing him.\n\nI massaged a sore muscle in my left leg and rose to my feet. I caught hold of Luke beneath the armpits and dragged him about twenty paces farther along into the clearing. Then I sighed and returned to the spot where I had rested. There was not sufficient time to flee farther. And as the wailing increased in volume and the giant flowers swayed in a line heading directly toward meglimpses of a darker form becoming visible amid the stalks, I knew that with the Jabberwock fled the Fire Angel was back on the job, and since this confrontation seemed inevitable, this clearing was as good a place to meet it as any, and better than most.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nI unfastened the bright thing at my belt and began to unfold it. It made a series of clicking noises as I did so. I was hoping that I was making the best choice available to me rather than, say, a bad mistake.\n\nThe creature took longer than I'd thought to pass among the flowers. This could mean it was having trouble following my trail amid its exotic surroundings. I was hoping, though, that it meant it had been sufficiently injured in its encounter with the Jabberwock that it had lost something of its strength and speed.\n\nWhatever, the final stalks eventually swayed and were crushed. The angular creature lurched forward and halted a to stare at me with unblinking eyes. Frakir panicked, and I calmed her. This was a little out of her league. I had a Fire Fountain spell left, but I didn't even bother with it: I knew it wouldn't stop the thing, and it might make it behave unpredictably.\n\n\"I can show you the way back to Chaos,\" I shouted, \"if you're getting homesick!\"\n\nIt wailed softly and advanced. So much for sentimentality.\n\nIt came on slowly, oozing fluids from a dozen wounds. I wondered if it were still capable of noshing me or if its present pace were the best it could manage. Prudence dictated I assume the worst, so I tried to stay loose and ready to match anything it attempted.\n\nIt didn't rush, though. It just kept coming, like a small tank with appendages. I didn't know where its vital spots were located. Fire Angel anatomy had not been high on my list of interests back home. I gave myself a crash course, however, in the way of gross observation as it approached. Unfortunately, this gave me to believe that it kept everything important well protected. Too bad.\n\nI did not want to attack in case it was trying to sucker me into something. I was not aware of its combat tricks, and I did not care to expose myself unduly in order to learn them. Better to stay on the defense and let it make the first move; I told myself. But it just kept moving nearer and nearer. I knew that I'd be forced to do something soon, even if it were only to retreat...\n\nOne of those long, folded front appendages flashed out toward me, and I spun to the side and cut. Snicker-snack! The limb lay on the ground, still moving. So I kept moving, also. One-two, one-two! Snicker-snack!\n\nThe beast toppled slowly to its left, for I had removed all of the limbs on that side of its body.\n\nThen, overconfident, I passed too near in racing to round its head to reach the other side and repeat the performance while it was still traumatized and collapsing. Its other extensor flashed out. But I was too near and it was still toppling: Instead of catching me with its clawed extremity, it hit me with the equivalent of shin or forearm. The blow struck me across the chest and I was knocked backward.\n\nAs I scrambled away and drew my feet beneath me to rise, I heard Luke say, groggily, \"Now what's going on?\"\n\n\"Later,\" I called, without looking back.\n\nThen, \"Hey! You hit me!\" he added.\n\n\"All in good fun,\" I answered. \"Part of the cure,\" and I was up and moving again.\n\n\"Oh,\" I heard him say.\n\nThe thing was on its side now and that big limb struck wildly at me, several times. I avoided it and was able to gauge its range and striking angle.\n\nSnicker-snack. The limb fell to the ground and I moved in.\n\nI swung three blows which passed all the way through its head from different angles before I was able to sever it. It kept making clicking noises, though, and the torso kept pitching and scrabbling about on the remaining limbs.\n\nI don't know how many times I struck after that. I just kept at it until the creature was literally diced. Luke had begun shouting \"Ole!\" each time that I struck. I was perspiring somewhat by then, and I noticed that heat waves or something seemed to be causing my view of the distant flowers to ripple in a disturbing fashion. I felt foresighted as all hell, though, the Vorpal Sword I'd appropriated back in the bar had proved a fine weapon. I swung it through a high arc, which I'd noted seemed to cleanse it entirely, and then I began folding it back into its original compact form. It was as soft as flower,petals, and it still gave off a faint dusty glow...\n\n\"Bravo!\" said a familiar voice, and I fumed until I saw the smile followed by the Cat, who was tapping his paws lightly together. \"Callooh! Callay!\" he added. \"Well done, beamish boy!\"\n\nThe background wavering grew stronger, and the sky darkened. I heard Luke say \"Hey!\" and when I glanced back I saw him getting to his feet, moving forward. When I looked again I could see the bar forming at the Cat's back, and I caught a glimpse of the brass rail. My head began to swim.\n\n\"There's normally a deposit on the Vorpal Sword,\" the '' Cat was saying. \"But since you're returning it intact-\"\n\nLuke was beside me. I could hear music again, and he was humming along with it. Now it was the clearing, with its butchered Fire Angel, that seemed the superimposition, as the bar increased in solidity, taking on nuances of color and shading.\n\nBut the place seemed somehow smaller-the tables closer together, the music softer, the mural more compressed and its artist out of sight. Even the Caterpillar and his mushroom had retreated to a shadowy nook, and both seemed shrunken, the blue smoke less dense. I took this as a vaguely good sign, for if our presence there were a result of Luke's state of mind then perhaps the fixation was losing its hold on him.\n\n\"Luke?\" I said.\n\nHe moved up to the bar beside me.\n\n\"Yeah?\" he answered.\n\n\"You know you're on a trip, don't you?\"\n\n\"I don't... I'm not sure what you mean,\" he said.\n\n`'When Mask had you prisoner I think he slipped you some acid,\" I said. \"Is that possible?\"\n\n\"Who's Mask?\" he asked me.\n\n\"The new head honcho at the Keep.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean Sharu Garrul,\" he said. \"I do remember that he had on a blue mask.\"\n\nI saw no reason to go into an explanation as to why Mask wasn't Sharu. He'd probably forget, anyway. I just nodded and said, \"The boss.\"\n\n\"Well... yes, I guess he could have given me something,\" he replied. \"You mean that all this... ?\" He gestured toward the room at large.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Sure, it's real,\" I said. \"But we can transport ourselves into hallucinations. They're all real somewhere. Acid'll do it.\"\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" he said.\n\n\"I gave you some stuff to bring you down,\" I told him. \"But it may take a while.\"\n\nHe licked his lips and glanced about.\n\n\"Well, there's no hurry,\" he said. Then he smiled as a distant screaming began and the demons started in doing nasty things to the burning woman off in the mural. \"I kind of like it here.\"\n\nI placed the folded weapon back upon the bartop. Luke rapped on the surface beside it and called for another round of brews. I backed away, shaking my head.\n\n. \"I've got to go now,\" I told him. \"Someone's still after me, and he just came close.\"\n\n\"Animals don't count,\" Luke said.\n\n\"The one I just chopped up does,\" I answered. \"It was sent.\"\n\nI looked at the broken doors, wondering what might come through them next. Fire Angels have been known to hunt in pairs.\n\n\"But I've got to talk to you... ,\" I continued.\n\n\"Not now,\" he said, turning away.\n\n\"You know it's important.\"\n\n\"I can't think right,\" he answered.\n\nI supposed that had to be true, and there was no sense trying to drag him back to Amber or anywhere else. He'd just fade away and show up here again. His head would have to clear and his fixation dissipate before we could discuss mutual problems.\n\n\"You remember that your mother is a prisoner in Amber?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Call me when you've got your head together. We have to talk.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"I turned away and walked out the doors and into a bank of fog. In the distance I heard Luke begin singing again, some mournful ballad. Fog is almost as bad as complete darkness when it comes to shadow-shifting. If you can't see any referents while you're moving, there is no way to use the ability, that allows you to slip away. On the other hand, I just wanted to be alone for a time to think,\n\nNow my head was clear. If I couldn't see anybody in this stuff, nobody could see me either. And there were no sounds other than my own footfalls on a cobbled surface.\n\nSo what had I achieved? When I was awakened from a brief nap to attend Luke's unusual sending to Amber, I'd been dead tired following extraordinary exertions. I was transported into his presence, learned that he was tripping, fed him something I hoped would bring him off it sooner, hacked up a Fire Angel, and left Luke back where he had started.\n\nI'd gotten two things out of it, I mused, as I strolled through the cottony mist: I'd stalemated Luke in any designs he might still have upon Amber. He was now aware that his mother was our prisoner, and I couldn't see him bringing any direct action against us under the circumstances. Aside from the technical problems involved in transporting Luke and keeping him in one place, this was the reason I was willing to leave him as I just had. I'm sure Random would have preferred him unconscious in a cell in the basement, but I was certain he would settle for a defanged Luke at large; especially so, when it was likely that Luke would be getting in touch with us sooner or later regarding Jasra. I was willing to let him come down and come around in his own good time. I had problems of my own in the waiting room, like Ghostwheel, Mask, Vinta... and the new specter which had just taken a number and a seat.\n\nMaybe it had been Jasra who had been using the homing power of the blue stones to send assassins after me. She had the ability as well as a motive. It could also have been Mask, though, who I'd judge had the ability and who seemed to have a motive, though I didn't understand it. Jasra was out of the way now, however; and while I intended to have things out with Mask eventually, I believed that I had succeeded in detuning myself from the blue stones. I also believed that I might have scared Mask somewhat in our recent encounter at the Keep. Whatever, it was extremely unlikely that Mask or Jasra, whatever their powers, would have had access to a trained Fire Angel. No, there's only one place Fire Angels come from, and shadow-sorcerers aren't on the customer fist.\n\nA puff of wind parted the fog for a moment and I caught sight of dark buildings. Good. I shifted. The fog moved again almost immediately, and they were not buildings but dark rock formations. Another parting and a piece of dawn or evening sky came into view, a foam of bright stars spilled across it. Before too long a wind whipped the fog away and I saw that I walked in a high rocky place, the heavens a blaze of starry light bright enough to read by. I followed a dark trail leading off to the edge of the world...\n\nThe whole business with Luke, Jasra, Dalt, and Mask was somehow of a piece, completely understandable in some places and clouded in others. Given some time and legwork it would all hang together. Luke and Jasra seemed to be nullified now. Mask, an enigma of sorts; seemed to have it in for me personally but did not appear to represent any particular threat to Amber. Dalt, on the other hand, did, with his fancy new weaponry, but Random was aware of this situation and Benedict was back in town. So I was confident that everything possible was being done to deal with this.\n\nI stood at the edge of the world and looked down into a bottomless rift full of stars. My mountain did not seem to grace the surface of a planet. However, there was a bridge to my left, leading outward to a dark, star-occluding shape, another floating mountain, perhaps. I strolled over and stepped out onto the span. Problems involving atmosphere, gravitation, temperature, meant nothing here, where I could, in a sense, make up reality as I went along. I walked out onto the bridge, and for a moment the angle was right and I caught a glimpse of another bridge on the far side of the dark mass, leading off to some other darkness.\n\nI halted in the middle, able to see along it for a great distance in either direction. It seemed a safe and appropriate spot. I withdrew my packet of Trumps and riffled through them until I located one I hadn't used in a long, long time.\n\nI held it before me and put the others away, studying the blue eyes and the young, hard, slightly sharp features beneath a mass of pure white hair. He was dressed all in black, save for a bit of white collar and sleeve showing beneath the glossy tight-fitting jacket. He held three dark steel balls in his gloved hand.\n\nSometimes it's hard to reach all the way to Chaos, so I focused and extended, carefully, strongly. The contact came almost immediately. He was seated on a balcony beneath a crazily stippled sky, the Shifting Mountains sliding to his left. His feet were propped on a small floating table and he was reading a book. He lowered it and smiled faintly.\n\n\"Merlin,\" he said softly. \"You look tired.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"You look rested,\" I said.\n\n\"True,\" he answered, as he closed the book and set it on the table. Then, \"There is trouble?\" he asked.\n\n\"There is trouble, Mandor.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet.\n\n\"You wish to come through?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"If you have any Trumps handy for getting back, I'd rather you came to me.\"\n\nHe extended his hand.\n\n\"All right,\" he said.\n\nI reached forward, our hands clasped; he took a single step and stood beside me on the bridge. We embraced for a moment and then he turned and looked out and down into the rift.\n\n\"There is some danger here?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. I chose this place because it seems very safe.\" \"Scenic, too,\" he replied. \"What's been happening to you?\"\n\n\"For years I was merely a student, and then a designer of certain sorts of specialized machinery,\" I told him. \"Things were pretty uneventful until fairly recently. Then all hell broke loose, but most of it I understand, and much of it seems under control. That part's complicated and not really worth your concern.\"\n\nHe rested a hand on the bridge's side-piece: \"And the other part?\" he asked.\n\n\"My enemies up until this point had been from the environs of Amber. But suddenly, when it seemed that most of that business was on its way to being settled, someone put a Fire Angel on my trail. I succeeded in destroying it just a little while ago. I've no idea why, and it's certainly not an Amber trick.\"\n\nHe made a clicking noise with his lips as he turned away, paced a few steps, and turned back.\n\n\"You're right, of course,\" he said. \"I'd no idea it had come anywhere near this, or I'd have spoken with you some time ago. But let me differ with you as to orders of importance before I indulge in certain speculations on your behalf. I want to hear your entire story.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you are sometimes appallingly naive, little brother, and I do not yet trust your judgment as to what is truly important.\"\n\n\"I may starve to death before I finish,\" I answered. Smiling crookedly, my step-brother Mandor raised his arms. While Jurt and Despil are my half brothers, borne by my mother, Dara, to Prince Sawall the Rim Lord, Mandor was Sawall's son by an earlier marriage. Mandor is considerably older than I, and as a result he reminds me much of my relatives back in Amber. I'd always felt a bit of an outsider among the children of Dara and Sawall. In that Mandor was in a more stable sense, not part of that particular grouping either, we'd had something in common. But whatever the impulse behind his early attentions, we'd hit it off and become closer, I sometimes think, than full blood brothers. He had taught me a lot of practical things over the years, and we had had many good times together.\n\nThe air was distorted between us, and when Mandor lowered his arms a dinner table covered with embroidered white linen came into sudden view between us, soundlessly, followed a moment later by a pair of facing chairs. The table bore numerous covered dishes, fine china, crystal, silverware; there was even a gleaming ice bucket with a dark twisted bottle within it.\n\n\"I am impressed,\" I stated.\n\n\"I've devoted considerable time to gourmet magic in recent years,\" he said. \"Pray, be seated.\"\n\nWe made ourselves comfortable there on the bridge between two darknesses. I muttered appreciatively as I tasted, and it was some minutes before I could begin a summary of the events that had brought me to this place of starlight and silence.\n\nMandor listened to my entire tale without interruption, and when I'd finished he nodded and said, \"Would you care for another serving of dessert?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed. \"It's quite nice.\"\n\nWhen I glanced up a few moments later, I saw that he was smiling.\n\n\"What's funny?\" I asked.\n\n\"You,\" he replied. \"If you recall, I told you before you left for that place to be discriminating when it came to giving your trust.\"\n\n\"Well? I told no one my story. If you're going to lecture me on being friendly with Luke without learning his, I've already heard it.\"\n\n\"And what of Julia?\"\n\n\"What do you mean? She never learned...\"\n\n\"Exactly. And she seems like one you could have trusted. Instead, you turned her against you.\"\n\n\"All right! Maybe I used bad judgment there, too.\"\n\n\"You designed a remarkable machine, and it never occurred to you it might also become a potent weapon. Random saw that right away. So did Luke. You might have been saved from disaster on that front only by the fact that it became sentient and didn't care to be dictated to.\n\n\"You're right. I was more concerned with solving technical problems. I didn't think through all the consequences.\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"What am I going to do with you, Merlin? You take risks when you don't even know you're taking risks.\"\n\n\"I didn't tmst Vinta,\" I volunteered.\n\n\"I think you could have gotten more information out of her,\" he said; \"if you hadn't been so quick to save Luke, who already appeared to be out of danger. She seemed to be loosening up considerably at the end of your dialogue.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I should have called you.\"\n\n\"If you encounter her again, do it, and I'll deal with her.\"\n\nI stared. He seemed to mean it.\n\n\"You know what she is?\"\n\n\"I'll unriddle her,\" he said, swirling the bright orange beverage in his glass. \"But I've a proposal for you, elegant in its simplicity. I've a new country place, quite' secluded, with all the amenities. Why not return to the Courts with me rather than bouncing around from hazard to hazard? Lie low for a couple of years, enjoy the good life, catch up on your reading. I'll see that you're well protected. Let everything blow over, then go about your business in a more peaceful climate.\"\n\nI took a small sip of the fiery drink.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"What happened to those things you indicated earlier that you knew and I didn't?\"\n\n\"Hardly important, if you accept my offer. \"\n\n\"Even if I were to accept, I'd want to know.\"\n\n\"Bag of worms,\" he said.\n\n\"You listened to my story. I'll listen to yours.\"\n\nHe shrugged and leaned back in his chair, looked up at stars.\n\n\"Swayvill is dying,\" he said.\n\n\"He's been doing that for years.\"\n\n\"True, but he's gotten much worse. Some think it has, to do with the death curse of Eric of Amber. Whatever; I really believe he hasn't much longer.\"\n\n\"I begin to see...\"\n\n\"Yes, the struggle for the succession has become more intense. People have been falling over left and right poison, duels, assassinations, peculiar accidents, dubious suicides. A great number have also departed for points unknown. Or so it would seem.\"\n\n\"I understand, but I don't see where it concerns me.\"\n\n\"One time it would not have.\"\n\n\"But?\"\n\n\"You are not aware that Sawall adopted you, formally, after your departure?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes. I was never certain as to his exact motives. But you are a legitimate heir. You follow me but take precedente over Jurt and Despil.\"\n\n\"That would still leave me way in hell down on the list.\"\n\n\"True,\" he said slowly. \"Most of the interest lies at the top...\"\n\n\"You say 'most.' \"\n\n\"There are always exceptions,\" he answered. \"You must realize that a time such as this is also a fine occasion for the paying off of old debts. One death more or less hardly rouses an eyebrow the way it would have in more placid. times. Even in relatively high places.\"\n\nI shook my head as I met his eyes.\n\n\"It really doesn't make sense in my case,\" I said. He continued to stare untll I felt uncomfortable. \"Does it?\" I finally asked.\n\n\"WeIl...\" he said. \"Give it some thought.\"\n\nI did. And just as the notion came to me, Mandor nodded as if he viewed the contents of my mind. \"Jurt,\" he said, \"met the changing times with a mixture of delight and fear. He was constantly talking of the latest deaths and of the elegance and apparent ease with which some of them were accomplished. Hushed tones interspersed with a few giggles. His fear and his desire to increase his own capacity for mischief finally reached a point where they became greater than his other fear-\"\n\n\"The Logrus. . . .\"\n\n\"Yes. He finally tried the Logrus, and he made it through.\"\n\n\"He should be feeling very good about that. Proud. It was something he',d wanted for years.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Mandor answered. \"And I'm sure he felt a great number of other things as well.\"\n\n\"Freedom,\" I suggested. \"Power,\" and as I studied his half amused expression, I was forced to add, \"and the ability to play the game himself.\"\n\n\"There may be hope for you,\" he said. \"Now, would you care to carry that through to its logical conclusion?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I responded, thinking of Jurt's left ear as I floated away following my cut, a swarm of blood-bead: spreading about it. \"You think Jurt sent the Fire Angel.\"\n\n\"Most likely,\" he replied. \"But would you care to pursue that a little further?\"\n\nI thought of the broken branch piercing Jurt's eyeball as we wrestled in the glade...\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"He's after me. It could be a part of the succession game, because I'm slightly ahead of him; on that front, or just plain dislike and revenge, or both. \"\n\n\"It doesn't really matter which,\" Mandor said, \"in terms of results. But I was thinking of that crop-eared wolf that attacked you. Only had one eye, too, it seemed...\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"What does Jurt look like these days?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's grown about half the ear back. It's pretty ragged and ugly-looking. Generally, his hair covers it. The eyeball is regenerated, but he can't see out of it yet. He usually wears a patch.''\n\n\"That might explain recent developments,\" I said. \"Hell of a time for it, though, with everything else that's been going on. Muddies the waters considerably.\"\n\n\"It's one of the reasons I suggest you simply drop out; and let everything cool down. Too busy. With as many arrows as there seem to be in the air, one may well find your heart.\"\n\n\"I can take care of myself, Mandor.\"\n\n\"You could have fooled me.\"\n\nI shrugged, got up, walked over to the rail, and looked down at the stars.\n\nAfter a long while he called out to me, \"Have you got any better ideas?\" but I didn't answer him because I was thinking about that very matter. I was considering what Mandor had said about my tunnel' vision and lack of preparedness and had just about concluded that he was right, that in nearly everything that had happened to me: up to this point, with the exception of my going after Jasra, I had mainly been responding to circumstance. I had been far more acted upon than acting. Admittedly, it had all happened very quickly. But still, I had not formed any real plans for covering myself, learning about my enemies or striking back. It seemed that there were some things I might be doing...\n\n\"If there is that much to worry about,\" he said, \"you are probably better off playing it safe.\"\n\nHe was probably right, from the standpoints of reason, safety, caution. But he was strictly of the Courts, while I possessed an additional set of loyalties in which he did not participate. It was possible, if only through my connection with Luke, that I might be able to come up with some personal course of action that would further the security of Amber. So long as such a chance existed, I felt obliged to pursue matters. And beyond this, from a purely personal standpoint, my curiosity was too strong to permit me to walk away from the unanswered questions which abounded when I could be actively seeking some answers.\n\nAs I was considering how I might best phrase these matters in my reply to Mandor, I was again acted upon. I became aware of a faint feeling of inquiry, as of a cat scratching at the doors of my mind. It grew in force, thrusting aside other considerations, until I knew it as a Trump sending from some very distant place. I guessed that it might be from Random, anxious to discover what had transpired since my absence from Amber. So I made myself receptive, inviting the contact.\n\n\"Merlin, what's the matter?\" Mandor asked, and I raised my hand to indicate I was occupied. At that, I saw him place his napkin upon the tabletop and rise to his feet.\n\nMy vision cleared slowly and I beheld Fiona, looking stern, rocks at her back, a pale green sky above her.\n\n\"Merlin,\" she said. \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Far away,\" I answered. \"It's' a long story. What's going on? Where are you?\"\n\nShe smiled bleakly.\n\n\"Far away,\" she replied.\n\n\"We seem to have chosen very scenic spots,\" I observed. \"Did you pick the sky to complement your hair?\"\n\n\"Enough! \" she said. \"I did not call you to compare travel notes.\"\n\nAt that moment Mandor came up aside me and placed his hand upon my shoulder, which was hardly in keeping with his character; as it is considered a gauche thing to do when a Trump communication is obviously in progress on the order of intentionally picking up an extension phone and breaking in on someone's call. Nevertheless...\n\n\"My! My!\" he said. \"Will you please introduce me, Merlin?\"\n\n\"Who,\" Fiona asked, \"is that?\"\n\n\"This is my brother Mandor,\" I told her, \"of the House of Sawall in the Courts of Chaos. Mandor; this is my Aunt Fiona, Princess of Amber.\"\n\nMandor bowed.\n\n\"I have heard of you, Princess,\" he said. \"It is indeed a pleasure.\"\n\nHer eyes widened for a moment.\n\n\"I know of the house,\" she replied, \"but I'd no idea of Merlin's relationship with it. I am pleased to know you.\"\n\n\"I take it there's some problem, Fi?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, glancing at Mandor.\n\n\"I will retire,\" he said. \"Honored to have met you, Princess. I wish you lived a bit nearer the Rim.\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said. \"This does not involve any state secrets. You are an initiate of the Logrus?\"\n\n\"I am,\" he stated.\n\n\"...And I take it you two did not get together to fight a duel?\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" I answered.\n\n\"In that case, I would welcome his view of the problem, also. Are you willing to come to me, Mandor?\" He bowed again, which I thought was hamming it a bit.\n\n\"Anyplace, Madam,\" he responded.\n\nShe said, \"Come then,\" and she extended her left hand and I clasped it. Mandor reached out and touched her wrist. We stepped forward.\n\nWe stood before her in the rocky place. It was breezy and a bit chill there. From somewhere distant there came a muted roar, as of a muffled engine.\n\n\"Have you been in touch with anyone in Amber recently?\" I asked her.\n\n\"No,\" she stated.\n\n\"Your departure was somewhat abrupt.\"\n\n\"There were reasons.\"\n\n\"Such as your recognizing Luke?\"\n\n\"His identity is known to you now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And to the others?\"\n\n\"I told Random,\" I answered, \"and Flora.\"\n\n\"Then everyone knows,\" she said. \"I departed quickly and took Bleys with me because we had to be next on Luke's list. After all, I tried killing his father and almost succeeded. Bleys and I were Brand's closest relatives, and we'd turned against him.\"\n\nShe turned a penetrating gaze upon Mandor, who smiled.\n\n\"I understand,\" he stated, \"that right now Luke drinks with a Cat, a Dodo, a Caterpillar, and a White Rabbit. I also understand that with his mother a prisoner in Amber he is powerless against you.\"\n\nShe regarded me again.\n\n\"You have been busy,\" she said. \"I try.\"\n\n\"...So that it is probably safe for you to return,\" Mandor continued.\n\nShe smiled at him, then glanced at me.\n\n\"Your brother seems well informed,\" she observed.\n\n\"He's family, too,\" I said, \"and we've a lifelong habit of looking out for each other.\"\n\n\"His life or yours?\" she asked.\n\n\"Mine,\" I replied. \"He is my senior.\"\n\n\"What are a few centuries this way or that?\" Mandor offered.\n\n\"I thought I felt a certain maturity of spirit,\" she noted. \"I've a mind to trust you further than I'd intended.\"\n\n\"That's very sporting of you,\" he replied, \"and I treasure the sentiment...\"\n\n\"...But you'd rather I didn't overdo it?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"I've no intention of testing your loyalties to home and throne,\" she said, \"on such short acquaintance. It does concern both Amber and the Courts, but I see no conflict in the matter.\"\n\n\"I do not doubt your prudence. I merely wanted to make my position clear.\"\n\nShe turned back toward me.\n\n\"Merlin,\" she said then, \"I think you lied to me.\"\n\nI felt myself frowning as I tried to recall an occasion when I might have misled her about something. I shook my head.\n\n\"If I did,\" I told her, \"I don't remember.\"\n\n\"It was some years ago,\" she said, \"when I asked you to try walking your father's Pattern.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I answered, feeling myself blush and wondering whether it was apparent in this strange light.\n\n\"You took advantage of what I had told you about the Pattern's resistance,\" she continued. \"You pretended it was preventing you from setting your foot upon it. But there was no visible sign of the resistance, such as there was when I tried stepping onto it.\"\n\nShe looked at me, as if for confirmation. \"So?\" I said.\n\n\"So,\" she replied, \"it has become more important now than it was then, and I have to know: Were you faking it that day?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Once I took one step upon it,\" I explained, \"I'd have been committed to walking it. Who knows where it might have led me and what situation might have followed? I was near the end of my holiday and in a hurry to get back to school: I didn't have time for what might have turned into a lengthy expedition. Telling you there were difficulties seemed the most graceful way of begging off.\"\n\n\"I think there's more to it than that,\" she said.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I think Corwin told you something about it that the rest of us do not know, or that he left you a message. I believe you know more than you let on concerning the thing.\"\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\"Sorry, Fiona. I have no control over your suspicions,\" I said: \"Wish I could be of more help.\"\n\n\"You can,\" she replied.\n\n\"Tell me how.\"\n\n\"Come with me to the place of the new Pattern. I want you to walk it.\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"I've got a lot more pressing business,\" I told her,\"than satisfying your curiosity about something my dad did years ,ago.\"\n\n\"It's more than just curiosity,\" she said. \"I told you once before that I think it's what is behind the increased\" incidence of shadow storms.\"\n\n\"And I gave you a perfectly good reason for something; else being the cause. I believe it's an adjustment to they partial destruction and recreation of the old Pattern. \"\n\n\"Would you come this way?\" she asked, and she turned from me and began to climb.\n\nI glanced at Mandor, shrugged, and followed her. He came along.\n\nWe mounted toward a jagged screen of rock. She reached it first and made her way onto a lopsided ledge which ran partway along it. She traversed this until she came to a place where the rock wall had broken down into a wide V-shaped gap. She stood there with her back' to us then, the light from the green sky doing strange things to her hair.\n\nI came up beside her and followed the direction of her gaze. On a distant plain, far below us and to the left, a large black funnel spun like a top. It seemed the source of the roaring sound we had been hearing. The ground; appeared to be cracked beneath it. I stared for several minutes, but it did not change in form or position. Finally, I cleared my throat.\n\n\"Looks like a big tornado,\" I said, \"not going anyplace.\"\n\n\"That's why I want you to walk the new Pattern,\" she' told me. \"I think it's going to get us unless we get it first.\"\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nIf you had a choice between the ability to detect falsehood and the ability to discover truth, which one would you take? There was a time when I thought they were different ways of saying the same thing, but I no longer believe that. Most of my relatives, for example, are almost as good at seeing through subterfuge as they are at perpetrating it. I'm not at all sure, though, that they care much about truth: On the other hand, I'd always felt there was something noble, special, and honorable about seeking truth, a thing I'd attempted with Ghostwheel. Mandor had made me wonder, though. Had this made me a sucker for truth's opposite?\n\nOf course, it's not as cut and dried as all that. I know that it is not a pure either/or situation with the middle excluded, but is rather a statement of attitude. Still, I was suddenly willing to concede that I might have gone to an extreme, to the point of foolhardiness, and that I had let certain of my critical faculties doze for far too long.\n\nSo I wondered about Fiona's request.\n\n\"What makes it such a threat?\" I asked her.\n\n\"It is a shadow storm in the form of a tornado,\" she said.\n\n\"There have been such things before,\" I answered.\n\n\"True,\" she responded, \"but they tend to move through Shadow. This one does have extension through an area of Shadow, but it is totally stationary. It first appeared several days ago, and it has not altered in any way since then.''\n\n\"What's that come to in Amber-time?\" I asked.\n\n\"Half a day, perhaps. Why?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I don't know. Just curious,\" I said. \"I still don't see why it's a threat.\"\n\n\"I told you that such storms had proliferated since; Corwin drew the extra Pattern. Now they're changing in. character as well as frequency. That Pattern has to be understood soon.\"\n\nA moment's quick reflection showed me that whoever gained control of Dad's Pattern could become master of some terrible forces. Or mistress.\n\nSo, \"Supposing I walk it;\" I said. \"Then what? As I understand it from Dad's story, I'd just wind up in the middle, the same as with the Pattern back home. What's; to be learned from that?\"\n\nI studied her face for some display of emotion, but my' relatives tend to have too much control for such simple self betrayal.\n\n\"As I understand it,\" she said, \"Brand was able to trump in when Corwin was at the middle. \"\n\n\"That's the way I understand it, too.\"\n\n\"...So, when you reach.the center, I can come in on a Trump.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. Then there will be two of us standing at the middle of the Pattern.\"\n\n\"...And from there we will be in a position to go someplace we could not reach from any other point in existence.\"\n\n\"That being?\" I asked.\n\n\"The primal Pattern which lies behind it.\" \"You're sure there is one?\"\n\n\"There must be. It is in the nature of such a construct to be scribed at a more basic level of reality as well as the mundane.\"\n\n\"And our purpose in traveling to that place?\"\n\n\"That is where its secrets dwell; where its deepest magics might be learned.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I told her. \"Then what?\"\n\n\"Why, there we might learn how to undo the trouble the thing is causing,\" she answered.\n\n\"That's all?\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed.\n\n\"We will learn whatever we can, of course. Power is power, and represents a threat until it is understood.\"\n\nI nodded slowly.\n\n\"But right now there are a number of powers that are more pressing in the threat department,\" I said. \"That Pattern is going to have to wait its turn.\"\n\n\"Even if it may represent the forces you need to deal with your other problems?\" she asked.\n\n\"Even so,\" I said. \"It might turn into a lengthy enterprise, and I don't believe I have the time for that.\"\n\n\"But you don't know that .for certain.\"\n\n\"True. But once I set foot on it, there's no turning back.\"\n\nI did not add that I'd no intention of taking her to the primal Pattern, then leaving her there on her own. After all, she had tried her hand at king-making once. And if Brand had made it to the throne of Amber in those days, she would have been standing right behind him, no matter what she had to say about it now. I think she was about to ask me to deliver her to the primal Pattern then but realized that I'd already considered it and rejected it. Not wanting to lose face by asking and being refused, she returned to her original argument.\n\n\"I suggest you make time now,\" she said, \"if you do not wish to see worlds torn up about you.\"\n\n\"I didn't believe you the first time you told me that,\" I answered, \"and I don't believe you now. I still think the increased shadow-storm activity is probably an adjustment to the damage and repair of the original Pattern. I also think that if we mess around with a new Pattern we don't know anything about, we stand a chance of making things worse, not better-\"\n\n\"I don't want to mess around with it,\" she said. \"I want to study-\"\n\nThe Sign of the Logrus flashed between us suddenly. She must have seen it or felt it somehow, too, because she drew back at the same instant I did.\n\nI turned my head with sure knowledge as to what I would see.\n\nMandor had mounted the battlementlike wall of stone. He stood as still as if he were a part of it, his arm, upraised. I suppressed my first impulse, which was to shout to him to stop. He knew what he was doing. And I was certain that he would not pay me the slightest heed, anyway.\n\nI advanced to the notch in which he had taken his position, and I looked past him at the swirling thing on the cracked plain far below. Through the image of the Logrus, I felt the dark, awful rush of power that Suhuy had revealed to me in his final lesson. Mandor was calling upon it now and pouring it into the shadow-storm. Did he not realize that the force of Chaos he was unleashing must spread until it had run a terrible course? Could he not see that if the storm were indeed a manifestation of Chaos then he was turning it into a truly monstrous thing?\n\nIt grew larger. Its roaring increased in volume. It became frightening to watch it.\n\nFrom behind me, I heard Fiona gasp.\n\n\"I hope you know what you're doing,\" I called to him.\n\n\"We'll know in about a minute,\" he replied, lowering his arms.\n\nThe Sign of the Logrus winked out before me.\n\nWe watched the damned thing spin for some time, bigger and noisier.\n\nFinally, \"What have you proved?\" I asked him.\n\n\"That you have no patience,\" he answered.\n\nThere was nothing particularly instructive to the phenomenon, but I continued to watch it anyway:\n\nAbruptly, the sound became a stutter. The dark apparition jerked about' suddenly, shaking off bits of accumulated debris as it contracted. Soon it was restored to its former size, and it hit its earlier pitch and the sound grew steady once more.\n\n\"How did you do that?\" I asked him.\n\n\"I didn't,\" he said. \"It adjusted itself.\"\n\n\"It shouldn't have,\" Fiona stated.\n\n\"Exactly,\" he replied.\n\n\"You've lost me,\" I said.\n\n\"It should have gone roaring right on, stronger than ever, after he'd augmented it that way,\" Fiona said. \"But whatever is controlling it had other plans. So it was readjusted.\"\n\n\"...And it is a Chaos phenomenon,\" Mandor continued. \"You could see that in the way it drew upon Chaos when I provided the means. But that pushed it past some limit, and there was a correction. Someone is playing with the primal forces themselves out there. Who or what or why, I cannot say. But I think it's strong testimony that the Pattern isn't involved. Not with Chaos games. So Merlin is probably correct. I think that this business has its origin elsewhere.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Fiona conceded. \"All right. What does that leave us with?\"\n\n\"A mystery,\" he said. \"But hardly, I think, an imminent threat.\"\n\nA faint firefly of an idea flitted through my mind. It could easily be dead wrong, though that was not the reason I decided against sharing it. It led into an area of thought I could not explore in an instant, and I don't like giving away pieces of things like that.\n\nFiona was glaring at me now, but I maintained a bland expression. Abruptly then, seeing that her cause was fruitless, she decided to change the subject:\n\n\"You said that you left Luke under somewhat unusual circumstances. Just where is he now?\"\n\nThe last thing I wanted to do was to get her really mad at me. But I couldn't see fuming her loose on Luke in his present condition. For all I knew, she might actually be up to killing him, just as a form of life insurance. And I did not want Luke dead. I'd a feeling he might be undergoing something of a change of attitude, and I wanted to give him every break I could. We still owed each other a few, even though it was hard keeping score; and there is something to be said for old times' sake Considering what I'd judged his condition to be when I'd left him, it was going to be a while before he was in decent shape again. And then I had a number of things I wanted to talk to him about.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I said. \"He's my province at the moment.\"\n\n\"I believe I have some interest in the matter,\" she replied levelly.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, \"but I feel that mine is greater and that we may get in each other's ways.\"\n\n\"I can judge these things for myself,\" she said.\n\n\"Okay,\" I told her. \"He's on an acid trip. Any information you'd get out of him might be colorful, but it would also be highly disappointing.\"\n\n\"How did this happen?\" she asked.\n\n\"A wizard named Mask apparently slipped him some chemicals when he had him prisoner.\"\n\n\"Where was this? I've never heard of Mask.\"\n\n\"A place called the Keep of the Four Worlds,\" I told her.\n\n\"It's been a long time since I heard the Keep mentioned,\" she said. \"A sorcerer named Sharu Garrul used to hold it.\"\n\n\"He's a coatrack now,\" I stated.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Long story; but Mask has the place these days.\"\n\nShe stared at me, and I could tell she was just realizing that there was a lot she didn't know in the way of recent developments. I'd judge she was deciding which of several obvious questions to ask next when I decided to beat her to the punch while she was still off balance.\n\n\"So how's Bleys?\" I asked.\n\n\"He's much improved. I treated him myself and he's recovering quickly.\"\n\nI was about to ask her where he was, which I knew she would refuse to answer, and hopefully we would both smile when she saw what I was driving at: no address for Bleys, no address for Luke; we keep our secrets and stay friends.\n\n\"Hello!\" I heard Mandor say, and we both turned in the direction he was facing, back out through the notch.\n\nThe dark tornado-form had collapsed to half its former size, and even as we watched, it continued to diminish. It fell steadily in upon itself, shrinking and shrinking, and in about a half minute it was gone, completely.\n\nI could not suppress a smile, but Fiona did not even notice. She was looking at Mandor.\n\n\"Do you think it was because of what you did?\" she asked him.\n\n\"I have no way of knowing,\" he replied, \"but it may well be.\"\n\n\"But does it tell you anything?\" she said.\n\n\"Perhaps whoever was responsible did not like having me tinker with his experiment.\"\n\n\"You really believe there's an intelligence behind it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Someone from the Courts?\"\n\n\"It seems more likely than someone from your end of the world.\"\n\n\"I suppose so... ,\" she agreed. \"Have you any guesses as to the person's identity?\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"I understand,\" she said quickly. \"Your business is your business. But a general threat is everybody's business. That's what I was really getting at.\"\n\n\"True,\" he acknowledged. \"This is why I propose investigating it. I'm at loose ends at the moment. It might be amusing.\"\n\n\"It is awkward asking you to communicate your findings to me,\" she said, \"when I do not know what interests might be involved.\"\n\n\"I appreciate your position,\" he replied, \"but to the best of my knowledge the treaty provisions still hold and no one in the Courts is promoting any special designs against Amber. In fact... If you like, we might pursue the matter together, at least part of the way.\"\n\n\"I've got the time,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't,\" I injected quickly. \"I've some pressing business to attend to.\"\n\nMandor shifted his attention to me.\n\n\"About my offer...\" he said.\n\n\"I can't,\" I told him.\n\n\"Very well. Our conversation is not concluded, however. I'll be in touch later.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nFiona looked my way then, also.\n\n\"You will keep me posted on Luke's recovery, and his intentions,\" she stated.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Good day, then.\"\n\nMandor gave me a small half salute and I returned it.\n\nI began walking then, and as soon as I was out of sight I began shifting.\n\nI found my way to a rocky slope, where I halted and withdrew my Trump for Amber. I raised it, focused my awareness, and transported myself as soon as I felt my way through. I was hoping the main hall would be empty, but at this point I didn't really care that much.\n\nI came through near Jasra, who was holding an extra cloak over her outstretched left arm. I ducked out the doorway to my left into an empty corridor and made my way to the back stair. Several times I heard voices and I detoured to avoid the speakers. I was able to make it to my rooms without being discovered.\n\nThe only rest I had had in what seemed an age and a half had been a fifteen-minute nap before Luke's spaced-out sorcerous faculty had caused him to summon me to the Looking Glass Bar via a hallucinatory Trump. When? For all I knew, it could have been yesterday, which had been a very full day before that incident.\n\nI barred the door and staggered to the bed, flinging myself down upon it without even removing my boots. Sure, there were all sorts of things I should be doing, but I was in no condition for any of them. I'd returned home because I still felt safest in Amber; despite the fact that Luke had reached me here once.\n\nSomeone with a high-powered subconscious might have had a brilliantly revelatory dream following as much crap as I'd been through recently, and then have awakened with a wonderful series of insights and answers detailing appropriate courses of action. I didn't. I woke once, in a small panic, not knowing where I was. But I opened my eyes and satisfied myself on that count, then went back to sleep. Later, much later, it seemed, I returned by degrees, like some piece of flotsam being pushed higher and higher onto a beach by wave following wave, until finally I was there. I saw no reason for going any further until I realized that my feet hurt. Then I sat up and pulled my boots off, which might have been one of the six greatest pleasures in my life. I removed my socks in a hurry then and threw them into the corner of the room. Why doesn't anyone else in my line of work seem to get sore feet? I filled the basin and soaked them for a time, then resolved to go barefoot for the next few hours.\n\nFinally I rose, stripped, cleaned up, and put on a pair of Levi's and a purple flannel shirt of which I am fond. The hell with swords, daggers, and cloaks for a time. I opened the shutters and looked outside. It was dark. Because of clouds, I couldn't even guess from the stars whether it might be early evening, late night, or almost morning.\n\nIt was very quiet in the hall, and there were no sounds as I made my way down the back stair. The kitchen was deserted also, the big fires banked and smoldering low. I didn't want to stir things up beyond hanging a pot of water to warm for tea while I located some bread and fruit preserves. I turned up a jug of something like grapefruit juice, too, in one of the walk-in ice boxes.\n\nAs I sat warning my feet and working my way through the loaf, I began to feel uneasy. I was sipping my tea before I realized what it was. There seemed a great necessity that I be doing something, yet I had no idea what. Now I had something of a breather, and it felt strange. So I decided to start thinking again.\n\nBy the time I'd finished eating, I had a few small plans. The first thing I did was to make my way to the main hall, where I removed all of the hats and cloaks form Jasra and swept her off her feet. Later, as I was bearing her stiff form along the upstairs hallway in the direction of my room, a door opened partway and a bleary-eyed Droppa watched me go by.\n\n\"Hey, I'II take two!\" he tailed after me.\n\n\"Reminds me of any first wife,\" he added then, and closed the door.\n\nOnce I had her installed in my quarters, I drew up a chair and seated myself before her. Garishly clad as part of a savage joke, her hard sort of beauty was not really diminished. She had placed me in extreme peril on one occasion, and I had no desire to free her at a time like this for a possible repeat performance. But the spell that held her claimed my attention for more than one reason and I wanted to understand it fully.\n\nCarefully then, I began exploring the construct which held her. It was not overcomplicated, but I could see that tracing all of its byways was going to take a while. All right. I wasn't about to stop now. I pushed on ahead into the spell, taking mental notes as I went.\n\nI was busy for hours. After I had solved the spell, I decided to hang some more of my own, times being what they were. The castle came awake about me as I worked. I labored steadily as the day progressed, until everything was in place and I was satisfied with my work. I was also famished.\n\nI moved Jasra off into a corner, pulled on my boots, departed my quarters, and headed for the stair. In that it seemed about lunchtime I checked out the several dining rooms in which the family generally ate. But all of them were deserted and none of them were set up for a meal yet to come. Nor did any of them show signs of a meal having recently been dispatched.\n\nI suppose it was possible my time sense was, still skewed and I was much too late or too early; but it did seem that it had been daylight long enough to bring me into the vicinity of the proper hour. Nobody, however, seemed to be eating, so something had to be wrong with this assumption...\n\nThen I heard it, the faint click of cutlery upon plate. I headed in the apparent direction of the sound. Obviously, the meal was taking place in a less frequented setting than usual. I turned right, then left. Yes, they had decided to set up in a drawing room. No matter.\n\nI entered the room, whew Llewella was seated with Random's wife, Vialle, on the red divan, dinner laid on a low table before them. Michael, who worked in the kitchen, stood nearby behind a cart loaded with dishes. I cleared my throat.\n\n\"Merlin,\" Vialle announced with a sensitivity that always gives me a small chill, she being completely blind. \"How pleasant!''\n\n\"Hello,\" Llewella said. \"Come and join us. We're anxious to hear what you've been doing.\"\n\nI drew a chair up to the far side of the table and seated myself. Michael came over and laid a fresh setting before me. I thought about it quickly. Anything Vialle heard would doubtless get back to Random. So I gave them a somewhat edited version of recent events leaving out all references to Mandor, Fiona, and anything having to do with the Courts. It made for a considerably shorter story and let me get to my food sooner.\n\n\"Everybody's been so busy lately,\" Llewella remarked. when I'd finished talking. \"It almost makes me feel guilty.\"\n\nI studied the delicate green of her more-than-olive complexion; her full lips, her large catlike eyes.\n\n\"But not quite,\" she added.\n\n\"Where are they all, anyway?\" I asked.\n\n\"Gerard,\" she said, \"is down seeing to harbor fortifications, and Julian is in command of the army, which has now been equipped with some firearms and is set to defend the approaches to Kolvir.\".\n\n\"You mean Dalt has something in the field already? Coming this way?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No, it was a precautionary measure,\" she replied, \"because of that message from Luke. Dalt's force had not actually been sighted.\"\n\n\"Does anyone even know where he is?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" she answered, \"but we're expecting some intelligence on that soon.\" She shrugged. Then, \"Perhaps Julian already has it,\" she added.\n\n\"Why is Julian in command?\" I asked between nibbles. \"I'd have thought Benedict would take charge of something like this.\"\n\nLlewella looked away, glancing at Vialle, who seemed to feel the shifting of focus.\n\n\"Benedict and a small force of his men have escorted Random to Kashfa,\" Vialle said, softly.\n\n\"Kashfa?\" I said: \"Why would he want to do that? In fact, Dalt usually hangs out around Kashfa. The area could be dangerous right now.\"\n\nShe smiled faintly.\n\n\"That is why he wanted Benedict and his guard for escort,\" she said. \"They may even be the intelligence- gathering expedition themselves, though that's not their reason for going right now.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I said, \"why the trip should be necessary at all.\"\n\nShe took a sip of water.\n\n\"A sudden political upheaval,\" she replied: \"Some general had taken over in the absence of the queen and the crown prince: The general was just assassinated recently, and Random has succeeded in obtaining agreement for placing his own candidate, an older noblemanon the throne. \"\n\n\"How'd he do that?\"\n\n\"Everyone with an interest in the matter was even more interested in seeing Kashfa admitted to the Golden Circle of privileged trade status.\"\n\n\"So Random bought them off to see his own man in charge,\" I observed. \"Don't these Golden Circle treaties usually give us the right to move troops through a client kingdom's territory with very little in the way of preliminaries?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\nI suddenly recalled that tough-looking emissary of the Crown I'd met at Bloody Bill's, who had paid his tab in Kashfan currency. I decided I did not really want to know how close in point of time that was to the assassination that had made this recent arrangement possible. What struck me with more immediate force was the picture that now emerged: It looked as if Random had just blocked Jasra and Luke from recovering their usurped thronewhich, to be fair, I guess Jasra had usurped herself, years ago. With all that usurping going on, the equities of the thing were more than a little hazy to me. But if Random's ethics were no better than those which had gone before, they were certainly no worse. It looked now, though, as if any attempt on the part of Luke to regain his mother's throne would be met by a monarch who possessed a defense alliance with Amber. I suddenly felt willing to bet that the terms of the defense provisions of the alliance included Amber's assistance in internal troubles as well as help against outside aggressors.\n\nFascinating. It sounded as if Random were going to an awful lot of trouble to isolate Luke from his power base and any semblance of legitimacy as a head of state. I supposed the next step could be to get him outlawed as a pretender and a dangerous revolutionary, and to put a price on his head. Was Random overreacting? Luke didn't seem all that dangerous now, especially with his mother in our custody. On the other hand, I didn't really know how far Random intended to go: Was he just foreclosing all of the threatening options, or was he actually out to get Luke? The latter possibility bothered me in that Luke seemed on halfway good behavior at the moment and possibly in the throes of reconsidering his position. I did not want to see him needlessly thrown to the wolves as a result of overkill on Random's part.\n\nSo, \"I suppose this has a lot to do with Luke,\" I said. to Vialle.\n\nShe was silent for a moment, then replied, \"It was Dalt that he seemed concerned about.\"\n\nI shrugged mentally. It seemed that it would come down to the same thing in Random's mind, since he would see Dalt as the military force Luke would turn to to recover the throne. So I said, \"Oh,\" and went on eating.\n\nThere were no new facts to be had beyond this, and nothing to clarify Random's thinking any further, so we lapsed into small talk while I considered my position once again. It still came down to a feeling that urgent action was necessary and uncertainty as to what form it should take. My course was determined in an unexpected fashion sometime during dessert.\n\nA courtier named Randel, tall, thin, dark, and generally smiling, came into the room. I knew something was up because he was not smiling and he was moving faster than usual. He swept us with his gaze, fixed upon Vialle, advanced quickly and cleared his throat.\n\n\"M'lady Majesty... ?\" he began.\n\nVialle turned her head slightly in his direction:\n\n\"Yes, Randel?\" she said. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"The delegation from Begma has just arrived,\" he answered, \"and I find myself without instructions as to the nature of their welcome and any special arrangements that would be suitable.\"\n\n\"Oh dear'\" Vialle said; laying aside her fork. \"They weren't due until the day after tomorrow, when Random will be back. He's the one they'll be wanting to complain to. What have you done with them?\"\n\n\"I seated them in the Yellow Room,\" he replied, \"and told them I would go and announce their arrival.\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"How many of them are there?\"\n\n\"The prime minister, Orkuz,\" he said, \"his secretary, Nayda, who is also his daughter, and another daughter, Coral. There are also four servants, two men and two women.\"\n\n\"Go and inform the household staff, and be sure that appropriate quarters are made ready for them,\" she directed, \"and alert the kitchen. They may not have had lunch.\"\n\n\"Very good, Your Highness,\" he said, beginning to back away.\n\n\"...Then report to me in the Yellow Room, to let me know it's been done,\" she continued, \"and I'll give you additional instruictions at that time.\"\n\n\"Consider it done,\" he replied, and he hurried off.\n\n\"Merlin, Llewella,\" Vialle said, beginning to rise, \"come help me entertain them while arrangements are being made.\"\n\nI gulped my last bite of dessert and got to my feet: I did not really feel like talking to a diplomat and his party, but I was handy and it was one of life's little duties.\n\n\"Uh... What are they here for, anyway?\" I asked.\n\n\"Some sort of protest over what we've been doing in Kashfa,\" she replied. \"They've never been friendly with Kashfa, but I'm not sure now whether they're here to protest Kashfa's possible admission to the Golden Circle or whether they're upset about our interfering in Kashfa's domestic affairs. It could be they're afraid they'll lose business with such a close neighbor suddenly enjoying the same preferred trade status they have. Or it may be they had different plans for Kashfa's throne and we just foreclosed them. Maybe.both. Whatever... We can't tell them anything we don't know.\"\n\n\"I just wanted to know what subjects to avoid,\" I said.\n\n\"All of the above,'' she answered.\n\n\"I was wondering the same thing myself,\" Llewella said. \"I was also wondering, though, whether they might have any useful information on Dalt. Their intelligence service must keep a close eye on doings in and about Kashfa.\"\n\n\"Don't pursue that topic,\" Vialle said, moving toward the door. \"If they let something slip or want to give something away, fine. Bring it home. But don't show them you'd like to know.\"\n\nVialle took my arm and I guided her out, heading toward the Yellow Room. Llewella produced a small mirror from somewhere and inspected her features. Obviously pleased, she put it away, then remarked, \"Lucky you showed up, Merlin. An extra smiling face is always useful at times like this.\"\n\n\"Why don't I feel lucky?\" I said.\n\nWe made our way to the room where the prime minister and his daughters waited. Their servants had already retired to the kitchen for refreshments. The official party was still hungry, which says something about protocol, especially since it seemed to take a long while before some trays of provender could be attractively assembled. Orkuz was of medium stature and stocky, his black hair tastefully streaked, the lines on his broad face seeming to indicate that he did a lot more frowning than smiling, a practice in which he indulged most of the while that afternoon. Nayda's was a more pleasingly sculpted version of his face, and though she showed the same tendency toward corpulence, it was held firmly in check at an attractive level of roundedness. Also, she smiled a lot and she had pretty teeth. Coral, on the other hand, was taller than either her father or sister, slender, her hair a reddish brown. When she smiled it seemed less official. Also, there was something vaguely familiar about her. I wondered whether I had met her at some boring reception years before. If I had, though, I felt I might have remembered.\n\nAfter we had been introduced and wine had been poured, Orkuz made a brief comment to Vialle about \"recent distressing news\" concerning Kashfa. Llewella and I quickly moved to her side for moral support, but she simply said that such matters would have to be dealt with fully upon Random's return, and that for the moment she wished merely to see to their comfort. He was completely agreeable to this, even to the point of smiling. I had the impression he just wanted the purpose of his visit on the record immediately. Llewella quickly fumed the conversation to the matter of his journey, and he graciously allowed the subject to be changed. Politicians are wonderfully programmed.\n\nI learned later that the Begman ambassador wasn't even aware of his arrival, which would seem to indicate that Orkuz had come so quickly he had preceded any notification to their embassy. And he hadn't even bothered dropping in there, but had come straight to the palace and had a message sent over. I leanned this a little later, when he asked to have the message delivered. Feeling somewhat supernumerary to Llewella's and Vialle's graceful cascades of neutral talk, I dropped back a pace to plan my escape. I was not at all interested in whatever game was being set up.\n\nCoral backed off also and sighed. Then she glanced at me and smiled, surveyed the room quickly and came closer.\n\n\"I've always wanted to visit Amber,\" she said then.\n\n\"Is it the way you imagined it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes. So far. Of course, I haven't seen that much of it yet...\n\nI nodded, and we , withdrew a little farther from the others.\n\n\"Have I met you somewhere before?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" she said. \"I haven't traveled that much, and I don't believe you've been out our way. Have you?\"\n\n\"No, though I've grown curious about it recently.'\n\n\"I do know something of your background, though,\" she went on, \"just from general gossip. I know you're from the Courts of Chaos; and I know you went to school on that Shadow world you Amberites seem to visit so frequently. I've often wondered what it was like.\"\n\nI took the bait and I began telling her about school and my job, about a few places I'd visited and things I'd enjoyed doing. We made our way to a sofa across the room as I spoke, and we got more comfortable. Orkuz, Nayda, Llewella, and Vialle didn't seem to miss us, and if I had to be here I found talking with Coral more enjoyable ,than listening to them. Not to monopolize things, though, I asked her about herself.\n\nShe began telling me of a girlhood spent in and around Begma, of her fondness for the outdoors, of horses and of boating on the many lakes and rivers in that region, of books she had read, and of relatively innocent dabblings in magic. A member of the household staff came in just as she was getting around to a description"
