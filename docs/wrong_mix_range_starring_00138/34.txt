Lacey Chabert is starring in another Christmas film, this time for Netflix. The actor, best known for her roles in “Mean Girls,” “Party of Five” and over 30 Hallmark films, will lead “Hot Frosty” for the streamer.

The film will also star Dustin Milligan (“Schitt’s Creek,” “The People We Hate at the Wedding”), Joe Lo Truglio (“Brooklyn Nine-Nine”), Craig Robinson (“The Office”), Katy Mixon (“American Housewife”), Lauren Holly (“Dumb and Dumber”) and Chrishell Stause (“Selling Sunset”).

The film’s official logline reads, “Two years after losing her husband, Cathy magically brings a handsome snowman to life! Through his naïveté, the snowman helps Cathy to laugh, feel and love again, as the two fall for each other just in time for the holidays…and before he melts.”

Jerry Ciccoritti (“My Life with the Walter Boys,” “Schitt’s Creek”) will direct from a script by Russell Hainline (“The Santa Summit,” “In Merry Measure”).

Producers include Joel S. Rice (“Single All the Way,” “A Tourist’s Guide to Love”) and Michael Barbuto (“Never Too Late to Celebrate,” “Catch Me if You Claus”) for Muse Entertainment, while Aren Prupas and Jonas Prupas will executive produce.

“Hot Frosty” joins Netflix’s 2024 holiday slate, which includes the Lindsay Lohan starrer “Our Little Secret” and “Meet Me Next Christmas” starring Christina Milian.

Chabert is next set to star in Hallmark’s “The Christmas Quest” alongside Kristoffer Polaha, and in the channel’s unscripted series “Celebrations with Lacey Chabert,” in which Chabert and her team plan a surprise party to give back to folks who make an impact on their communities.
