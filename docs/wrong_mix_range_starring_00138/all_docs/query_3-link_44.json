        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: In its first foray into the unscripted programming space, Hallmark Media is launching an inspirational series hosted by Christmas movie favorite Lacey Chabert.\n\nCelebrations with Lacey Chabert will feature the actress as she surprises kids, families and adults who are making a positive impact in their communities by throwing them the celebration of a lifetime. Chabert will also executive produce the 10-episode series, which will debut late next year on Hallmark Media’s subscription streaming service.\n\nChabert will work with party planners, family members and volunteers to create one-of-a-kind events in three days.\n\n“We’re proud to announce our foray into the unscripted programming space,” said Lisa Hamilton Daly, executive VP programming, Hallmark Media. “The Hallmark brand lends itself to a wide array of opportunities to tell stories that bring inspiration, comfort, joy and happiness to our viewers, so tapping into this genre allows us to evolve and expand our programming footprint in incredibly rewarding ways.”\n\n“Lacey Chabert shares the same passion for celebrating everyday heroes as we do at Hallmark,” Hamilton Daly continued. “Lacey’s natural warmth and genuine nature make her a perfect fit for this series that is sure to leave our Hallmark audience feeling uplifted as they experience these heartwarming stories and spectacular events.”\n\n“As a lifelong DIY enthusiast, I fell in love with party planning while coming up with creative ways to bring my daughter’s birthday parties to life,” said Chabert. “I am so excited to lend my love of crafts to create joyous moments for deserving people. This is going to be an epic party as we celebrate real-life heroes, complete with ups and downs that only unscripted television can capture.”\n\nCelebrations with Lacey Chabert is produced by UnConventional Entertainment, a part of Sony Pictures Ent. Executive producers include UnConventional’s Gena McCarthy, Sony’s Eli Holzman and Aaron Saidman, as well as Chabert, Ashley Franklin and Jill Garelick-Aron.\n\nChabert, who currently stars in A Very Scottish Christmas for Hallmark Channel, is repped by Innovative Artists and Thruline Entertainment."
