        "text": "Lacey Chabert (Young Justice, Mean Girls) and Kristoffer Polaha (Jurassic World Dominion, Ringer), who starred in Hallmark favorites A Merry Scottish Christmas and A Biltmore Christmas, respectively, have joined forces for the network’s newest holiday film set and shot on location in Iceland.\n\nThe duo wrapped production on the adventure-romance The Christmas Quest, premiering later this year as part of Hallmark’s 15th annual Countdown to Christmas programming event. The film also marks Chabert’s 15th (!!!) Hallmark Christmas movie.\n\nThe story follows an archeologist (played by Chabert) and her ex-husband (Polaha), an expert in ancient Norse languages, who are “sent to Iceland at Christmastime to search for a legendary treasure,” per the official synopsis. “When others join in the hunt, the pair find themselves swept into a thrilling adventure as they race to keep it from falling into the wrong hands.”\n\nDustin Rikert (A Merry Scottish Christmas, Where Are You, Christmas?) directed a script penned by Marcy Holland (A Biltmore Christmas).\n\n“In the spirit of the best action-adventure romances, The Christmas Quest pairs Lacey Chabert and Kristoffer Polaha on a daring quest, with a unique holiday twist,” Samantha DiPippo, Senior Vice President of Development and Programming at Hallmark Media, said in a statement. “Lacey and Kristoffer are at their charming best together and are the perfect pair to take viewers on this journey.”\n\nThe Christmas Quest hails from Synthetic Cinema International, the company behind such Hallmark films as A Merry Scottish Christmas and A Biltmore Christmas, and Iceland’s Hero Productions."
