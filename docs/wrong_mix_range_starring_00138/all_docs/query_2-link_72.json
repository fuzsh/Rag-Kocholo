        "text": "You might recognise her from numerous movies on Hallmark, but Chabert has had long career. As of 2024, Lacey Chabert has a net worth of $5 million.\n\nIn the 1990s, she acted in many television commercials. For example, her first major appearance was for Burger King, through which she made $10,000.\n\nChabert has recently signed a 3-year deal with Hallmark movies valued at over $6.1 million. The reason why her wealth is so low is her lavish lifestyle and extravagant spending.\n\nLacey Chabert Net Worth 2024\n\nReal Estate Deals\n\nLacey Chabert was a close friend of Amanda Seyfried. On her advice, Chabert has tried her luck in real estate, buying her first property in 1998 for $82,000.\n\nIn the subsequent years, she has bought more such houses through multiple bank mortgages, and also financial help from her friend Ashley Judd.\n\nBut as her acting opportunities dried up in 2000s, she ended up selling off the properties at a loss of over $2 million.\n\nLuxury Lifestyle\n\nChabertâ€™s wealth is not where it should be despite her appearances in numerous films and television shows.\n\nOne reason for this is that Chabert has squandered millions of dollars on poker, Vegas trips, parties, and a lavish lifestyle.\n\nBusinesses\n\nIn 2021, Chabert has launched an apparel business by partnering with another celebrity Lana Rhoades. These two put in $1 million each as equity.\n\nThe clothing line is doing fine and is expected to generate over $3.7 million in revenues this year.\n\nKey Facts"
