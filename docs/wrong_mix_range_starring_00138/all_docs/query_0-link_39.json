        "text": "Get in, loser: we're going to the movies.\n\nThe official trailer for Paramount Pictures' \"Mean Girls\" has arrived, and it's showing off the updated take on Tina Fey's modern classic while paying homage to the original 2004 film.\n\nBased on the 12-time Tony-nominated Broadway production, \"Mean Girls\" arrives in theaters on January 12. Rene√© Rapp takes on the iconic character of head Plastic Regina George, reprising the role in which she made her Broadway debut.\n\nFey, who wrote the screenplay for the 2004 hit movie comedy and co-wrote the 2018 Broadway musical, also penned this screenplay and co-produced the film adaptation, which was directed by Arturo Perez Jr. and Samantha Jayne.\n\nAngourie Rice stars as Cady Heron, the new girl navigating life at North Shore High. \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" heartthrob Christopher Briney plays Cady's crush, Aaron Samuels, while Auli'i Cravalho is Regina's ex-bestie and Cady's new friend, Janice Ian.\n\nSet to Olivia Rodrigo's \"get him back,\" the trailer avoids spoiling the movie's musical moments, though we see there are new additions to the story, such as the inclusion of TikTok, a makeup malfunction at Homecoming, and fresh dialogue.\n\n\"You could be really hot if you changed, like, everything,\" Rapp's Regina tells Rice's Cady during her makeover.\n\nIt's not all new, however. Fey and Tim Meadows will again play Ms. Norbury and Principal Duvall, reprising their roles from the 2004 film. Joining them among the adult cast are Jenna Fischer, Busy Philipps and Jon Hamm.\n\nAshley Park, who originated the anxiety-ridden Gretchen Wieners in the 2018 Broadway production, will play North Shore High's French teacher. Is this a subtle nod to her supporting role on Netflix's \"Emily in Paris?\" Who can say? Nonetheless, how fetch."
