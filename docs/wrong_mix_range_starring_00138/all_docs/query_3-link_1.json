One of her first roles as a child actress was the part of Bianca Montgomery, the daughter of Erica Kane, on All My Children from 1992 to 1993. She gained further prominence for her portrayal of Claudia Salinger in the Fox television drama Party of Five (1994–2000).[3]\n\nIn film, she has appeared in Lost in Space (1998), Not Another Teen Movie (2001), and Daddy Day Care (2003); and had leading roles as Gretchen Wieners in Mean Girls (2004), Meg Cummings in Dirty Deeds (2005), Dana Mathis in the horror remake Black Christmas (2006), and Penelope in the animated film All I Want for Christmas Is You (2017).

She appeared on The Broadway Kids' first album The Broadway Kids Sing Broadway (1994), where she sang her own solos on such songs as \"The Girl I Mean to Be\" (from The Secret Garden) and \"Castle on a Cloud\" (from Les Misérables).[17] In 1994, she landed the role of Claudia Salinger on the Fox network teen/family drama series Party of Five. The show centered on the five Salinger siblings, who are orphaned after their parents are killed in a car accident caused by a drunk driver.[18] The show received positive reviews and ran for six seasons, from September 12, 1994 to May 3, 2000.[19][20] She won The Hollywood Reporter's annual YoungStar Award for Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Drama TV Series in both 1997 and 1998 for Party of Five, and was nominated three other times for her work in 1999 to 2000. The YoungStar awards honor the best film, TV, and music performances made exclusively by 6- to 18-year-olds.\n\nChabert made her big-screen debut starring as Penny Robinson in Lost in Space (1998).
