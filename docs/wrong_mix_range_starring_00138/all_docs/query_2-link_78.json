        "text": "If you're a fan of Hallmark's annual lineup of feel-good Christmas movies, then you'll likely recognize Lacey Chabert, the star of holiday films like A Royal Christmas, Matchmaker Santa, and the upcoming A Wish For Christmas.\n\nAfter starring in several of the channel's movies, the actress has become both a Hallmark staple and an expert on Christmas movies. \"They're like comfort food,\" Chabert told Entertainment Weekly. \"You know you're going to sit down, be uplifted, feel some emotions, and be left in a good mood.\"\n\nIn addition to explaining what it takes to create the ultimate Hallmark Christmas movie—stunning scenery, a romantic proclamation of love, and a sweet moment with Santa—the actress revealed some surprising tidbits about what really goes into making the films. Here's what every Hallmark Channel fan needs to know.\n\n1. The beautiful, snow-covered winter scenes aren't real. All of the snow and weather conditions are fake, which can make it really challenging for the actors. \"Typically, they are shot in the summer, and you're in coats, scarves, gloves, and cashmere, and it's 110 degrees outside,\" Chabert explained. \"You're sweating and trying to act cold. It's actually kind of a skill to act cold—to have the mannerisms of being cold when it's the complete opposite of how you behave when you're hot.\"\n\n2. All of Lacey's movies include something authentic from her own life. For instance, the actress wore the bridal gown from her real-life nuptials for the wedding scene in A Royal Christmas. And in this year's Hallmark movie, A Wish for Christmas, Chabert's unique touch is even more sentimental. \"This one I loved because I was pregnant—that's obviously very personal,\" she said. \"I'll always be able to show my daughter and tell her she was in mommy's belly.\"\n\n3. The cast members love Christmas—just as much as the fans. Chabert begins her annual holiday season celebrations the day after Halloween. \"I've decorated and I've been listening to Christmas music since Nov. 1,\" the actress said. \"Christmas is my favorite time of the year.\" The actress also revealed that she and Mariah Carey bonded on the set of A Christmas Melody because they are both obsessed with the holiday season.\n\nIf you love watching Hallmark's Christmas movies, read Chabert's full Entertainment Weekly interview, and check out the full lineup of Hallmark's holiday movies premiering this year."
