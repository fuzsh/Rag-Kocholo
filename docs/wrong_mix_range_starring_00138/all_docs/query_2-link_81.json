She finds herself in the whirlwind of high school politics and cliques, especially when she crosses paths with Regina George (Rachel McAdams), the queen bee of North Shore High School's most popular clique, The Plastics. As Cady navigates this new terrain, she becomes entangled in The Plastics' manipulative games. Tina Fey, who also wrote the screenplay, stars as Ms. Norbury, a teacher who provides guidance for Cady. Mean Girls was nominated for multiple awards and won a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Comedy.\n\n2\n\nElevator Girl\n\nLacey Chabert, Joey King, Priscilla Barnes\n\nReleased : 2010\n\nDirected by : Bradford May\n\nElevator Girl is a 2010 family film written by Jennifer Notas directed by Bradford May.\n\n3\n\nMatthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner, Michael Douglas\n\nReleased : 2009\n\nDirected by : Mark Waters\n\nCelebrity photographer Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey) lives life in the fast lane, committed to bachelorhood and simultaneous relationships with multiple women. On the eve of his brother's wedding, Connor receives a visit from the spirits of his jilted lovers, who take him on an odyssey through his many failed relationships to try to find out what made him such a cad -- and if there is any hope of Connor finding true love.\n\nWilliam Hurt, Mimi Rogers, Heather Graham\n\nReleased : 1998\n\nDirected by : Stephen Hopkins\n\nThe space family Robinson is on a journey to Alpha Prime in the hopes of establishing a colony there and thereby saving humanity from extinction. Their plans are foiled by the evil Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman) and they find themselves curiously enough, lost in space.\n\n5\n\nChyler Leigh, Chris Evans, Jaime Pressly\n\nReleased : 2001\n\nDirected by : Joel Gallen\n\nIn Not Another Teen Movie, a quintessential teen comedy, high schooler Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh), an artistically inclined outsider, becomes the object of a bet for popular jock, Jake Wyler (Chris Evans). The wager? To transform Janey into prom queen material. The movie takes a satirical spin on classic teen films, weaving together tropes and iconic scenes from beloved flicks of the '80s and '90s. Amidst the laughter, it subtly exposes clich√©s and stereotypes that pervade teen cinema. Yet beneath its comedic exterior, Not Another Teen Movie serves as a commentary on societal expectations and the pressures of fitting in.\n\n6\n\nMeg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer\n\nReleased : 1997\n\nDirected by : Don Bluth, Gary Goldman\n\nAnastasia, a historical drama with a dash of fantasy, traces the story of an amnesiac orphan named Anya (voiced by Meg Ryan). Set against the backdrop of post-revolutionary Russia, she embarks on a quest to discover her true identity. Dmitri (John Cusack), a con artist seeking reward money, claims that Anya is the long-lost Russian princess Anastasia. As they journey to Paris, they encounter Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd), a sorcerer determined to end the Romanov line. The film won an Annie Award for its captivating voice acting and engaging musical score."
