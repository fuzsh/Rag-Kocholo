When adapting Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur’s hit 1928 play The Front Page into this film, Hawks had the inspired idea of turning its star reporter character Hildy Johnson into a woman. The result is an immortal mix of hard-boiled newsroom setting and remarriage comedy, and Rosalind Russell as Hildy is a standout among cinema’s powerful women. She is matched in force only by her conniving but charismatic editor and ex-husband, Walter Burns (Cary Grant). Burns dangles the chance for Hildy to scoop her fellow reporters with the story of an impending execution to keep her from hopping the train that’s supposed to take her to Albany and a new life as a housewife married to bland insurance man Bruce Baldwin, played by Ralph Bellamy. You can see more of Bellamy in five more films that follow His Girl Friday this evening and into tomorrow morning: Carefree, the 1938 Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers-led musical comedy; The Man Who Lived Twice, a 1936 crime drama; Sunrise at Campobello (1960), featuring Bellamy as Franklin Roosevelt and Best Actress Oscar nominee Greer Garson as Eleanor Roosevelt; Parole Girl (1933), a romantic drama costarring Mae Clark; and Boy Meets Girl (1938), a screwball comedy led by James Cagney and Pat O’Brien.\n\nNFL Football: Seattle at Dallas\n\nPrime Video, 8:15pm Live\n\nGeno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks are at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, for a Thursday Night Football matchup against Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nChildren Ruin Everything: “Money”\n\nThe CW, 8:30pm\n\nAstrid (Meaghan Rath) and James (Aaron Abrams) try to get through the month without dipping beyond their budget.\n\nShrek the Halls\n\nNBC, 8:30pm\n\nMike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas reprise their voice roles from the hit Shrek feature films in this 2007 half-hour holiday special, whose story takes place between Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After.

Turner Classic Movies continues its tradition of airing this title during the holiday season today; the film will also re-air Dec. 18 and Dec. 24 during the network’s Classic Christmas Marathon.
