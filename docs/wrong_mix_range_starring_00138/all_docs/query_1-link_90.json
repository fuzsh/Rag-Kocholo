        "text": "I'm an unabashed, unapologetic fan of HM and Lifetime Christmas movies (Lifetime's obviously don't have the budget of HM).\n\nI get the same effect from them as I got when I saw \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" on the big screen. Not that I owe an accounting, but I'd have NEVER attended that movie of my own choice, but a Frau Friend begged me to go with her.\n\nI quickly ignored the actors and dialog, so caught up in the set design that incorporated, well 50 shades of grey in each shot. It was fun to spot it.\n\nThere is something therapeutic and soothing in the repeated plot, costumes, characters, and they employ actors who have, like everybody else, bills to pay.\n\nBut no, what offered that I already pay for on my cable service is enough for me.\n\nRecently I was scrolling through the TV listings and there was some Hallmark movie about a woman who has to go home and try to save her family cookie company - I think that was the plot.\n\nI had a thought that if Hallmark really wanted to make the fraus of America quiver, they would not only do these stupid movies... the cookie compnay, the Xmas shop in downtown, etc, they would actually offer the product on QVC.\n\n\"Those yummy cookies you saw on A Crumble Cookie Company Christmas recently can now be shipped to you! Let's review what we'll send you for just five easy payments of $8.52... wWith me is...\"\n\nAnd for more meta-marketing you could have the cooies shipped to a nearby Hallmark store...\n\nthank you R27... the possibilities are endless and I'm surprised Hallmark hasn't gone all in. Well, aybe they have... I haven't been in a Hallmark store (do they still exist) in years.\n\nThere should be cozy murder mystery books for those characters that they keep cranking out films. Aurora Teagarden, Mystery 101.\n\nCrossword books could include an actual puzzle which contains clues to the murderer...\n\nRecipes in that bakery series...\n\nThe podscast character... hell, start an actual podcast.\n\nBut the QVC tie-in? ka-ching baby, ka-fuckin-ching."
