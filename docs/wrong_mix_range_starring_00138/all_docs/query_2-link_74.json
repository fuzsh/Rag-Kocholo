        "text": "Lacey Chabert is known as the Queen of Hallmark, but her latest career move has fans worried that she might be leaving the network she’s called home for nearly two decades. Keep reading to see if Lacey Chabert is leaving Hallmark.\n\nChabert made her Hallmark debut in 2010 with a starring role in Elevator Girl. Since then, she has starred in over 30 movies for the network, including Christmas Waltz, Haul Out the Holly, A Merry Scottish Christmas and My Secret Valentine. She’s also appeared in two of the Hallmark Channel’s biggest franchises: The Wedding Veil and Crossword Mysteries.\n\nIn recent years, a handful of Hallmark stars have left the network, including Candace Cameron Bure, Danica McKellar and Cameron Mathison, among others. Fans are now worried that Chabert might be next, so here’s everything we know about the actress’ future at Hallmark.\n\nIs Lacey Chabert leaving Hallmark?\n\nIs Lacey Chabert leaving Hallmark? We don’t know for sure, but the actress’ upcoming new role has sparked speculation that she may be moving over to Netflix.\n\nOn May 13, our sister site Deadline reported that Chabert was tapped to star in a new Christmas film for the streaming giant titled Hot Frosty. She’ll be starring alongside Schitt’s Creek alum Dustin Milligan, Days of our Lives vet Chrishell Stause, The Office‘s Craig Robinson, Brooklyn 99‘s Joe Lo Truglio, Mike & Molly star Katy Mixon and NCIS alum Lauren Holly.\n\nAlthough it’s unclear what role Chabert will play, sources told the outlet that securing her was a huge get for Netflix given her dominance in the holiday space. In recent years, the streamer has significantly increased their focus on producing original Christmas movies. Falling for Christmas, A Christmas Prince, Single All The Way and A Castle for Christmas are just some of the many titles they’ve added to their holiday collection, making them a fierce competitor for Hallmark.\n\nDespite her new role, Chabert doesn’t appear to be leaving Hallmark anytime soon. Later this year, Chabert will star alongside Kristoffer Polaha in The Christmas Quest as part of Hallmark’s 2024 Countdown to Christmas lineup. She also has a new show coming out with the network titled Celebrations with Lacey Chabert, which will air in late 2024. The series marks Hallmark’s first-ever unscripted program and it will follow Chabert as she throws one-of-a-kind celebrations for kids, families and adults who are making a positive impact in their communities.\n\nAdditionally, Chabert hasn’t given any indication that she plans on leaving the network in the near future. Over the years, the Wedding Veil star has been vocal about her love of the Hallmark Channel. She’s even commended the network for allowing her to bring her daughter, Julia, on set.\n\n“She was just barely four months old when we filmed [Moonlight in Vermont],” Chabert said of her daughter during a 2017 appearance on the BUILD Series. “I was excited to get back to work, I love love love my job so much … but it was a little daunting.” She added: “I am lucky that my job allows me to bring her to set with me, which is really nice.”"
