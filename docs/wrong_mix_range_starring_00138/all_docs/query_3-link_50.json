        "text": "For almost 30 years now, Lacey Chabert has graced our television screens, literally grown up right in front of our very eyes. Today, Chabert’s on-screen legacy lives on with her much-admired romance films on Hallmark Channel, where (ironically) she is currently working on her 30th film with the popular network.\n\n“I think the thing that has become the most rewarding for me and being a part of these movies is when I meet people, the common thread is always Thanks for doing something that’s uplifting,” Chabert, 39, tells me at Forbes about the fan responses she receives surrounding her Hallmark projects. “Those movies helped me while I was recovering from surgery or going through a difficult time in life. At this point, I kind of consider it an honor to be a part of bringing some goodness into the world.”\n\nChabert’s latest project is a trilogy of films, the first film titled The Wedding Veil, which premieres this Saturday night on Hallmark Channel. The story is about a trio of best friends (co-starring fellow Hallmark familiar faces Alison Sweeney and Autumn Reeser) that stumble upon what they are told is a magical wedding veil that will bring true love to the person in possession of it. With The Wedding Veil centering around the love story for Chabert’s character Avery, the second film The Wedding Veil Unveiled will premiere February 12, followed by The Wedding Veil Legacy premiering a week later on February 19. Even though Chabert has been a Hallmark star since her debut on the network in 2010 with the film Elevator Girl, she is expanding her creative abilities on these projects more than ever as also an executive producer.\n\n“As I’ve gone on and done more and more, I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity Hallmark has given me. It’s a very unique place in our business where it’s female-driven stories and we have the opportunity as actors to put on different hats and be a producer. Having been in this business almost my whole life, it’s been a goal that has been realized to be on the other side of the storytelling. I’ve learned so much and I’ve been able to apply my 30+ years in this business to these movies. So, it has been a very, very rewarding experience and developing The Wedding Veil series was very exciting for us.”\n\nNow 12 years into her Hallmark debut, Chabert says she plans to continue to create many more projects with the network, while always striving to bring the most timely and meaningful content to our television screens throughout 2022.\n\n“My biggest motivation or desire in this coming year is to tell deeper stories. I take it seriously the responsibility that I try to make each movie better than the last. I put my whole heart into it. I mean, it keeps me up at night if I don’t feel like we’ve made the best possible movie we could have and I think the audience deserves that. I mean especially 2022 - we’ve all been through a lot and I think to be able to turn your TV on and know that you’re going to watch something that is just going to leave you with a good feeling is priceless.”\n\nThere is no arguing that Chabert has built a strong name for herself on the small screen throughout her life, including with her very young start on the daytime soap All My Children (1992-1993) and for six seasons as Claudia Salinger on the hit television series Party of Five (1994-2000). For many movie fans, however, it is hard to compare her memorable on-screen presence to the comedic role and performance she had on the big screen in 2004, playing popular high schooler Gretchen Wieners (forever coining the term “fetch”) in the timelessly beloved film Mean Girls.\n\n“People ask me a lot Do you get sick of people bringing up Mean Girls? No, it’s fun! You make a movie and you have no idea how people are going to respond to it. You hope it’s going to resonate with people and the fact that all these years later, it’s something people are still talking about and it’s become such a part of pop culture. I’m really grateful that I was in that movie.”\n\nWith her unforgettable one-liners (including “I don’t think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.”), I wondered where Chabert would hope that her character Gretchen would be these 18 years later in 2022.\n\n“Oh, she’s running the Toaster Strudel empire, obviously! I think that she and Jason worked it out, they got married - they were each other’s high school loves and they have lots of little babies.”\n\nIn a world where Hollywood reboots and sequels continue to be all the rage, I asked Chabert if Mean Girls writer Tina Fey approached her and her co-stars Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, and Amanda Seyfried today with a solid sequel script, would Chabert be interested in returning to her “fetch” ways or does she feel that her Gretchen days have come and gone?\n\n“No, sign me up. It would be the most fun to reunite with all the crew and I think to see where these characters have gone would be so much fun - the audience would love it.”\n\nAs I wrapped up my conversation with Chabert, I asked her if she could go back to the Lacey Chabert just beginning her Hollywood career as a child star in the early 1990s and give her advice after everything she has experienced and achieved up to now, what would she say to that little Chabert?\n\n“I would say don’t doubt yourself. I would say believe in yourself and there are no dumb questions and just to keep going. I think the things that when we’re younger, especially the things that make us different, I think sometimes we view as flaws or you want fit in and be like everyone else. I’ve come to realize that some of those things are actually my strengths. So, I would just give myself a good pep talk (laughs) and say you’re on the right course. Just stay the course!”"
