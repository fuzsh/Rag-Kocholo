But for me the most quotable film in the cinematic canon is Tina Fey’s 2004 masterpiece Mean Girls.\n\nWhere would marketing teams be without the slogan “On Wednesdays we wear pink”? Mariah Carey used the line “Why are you so obsessed with me” in her music, as did Hillary Clinton in a tweet aimed at a certain Donald. And what of “you can’t sit with us” and the sharpest of put-downs: “Stop trying to make fetch happen”? Timelessly sassy.\n\nMean Girls also launched the career of more than one A-lister. Rachel McAdams’ rise began thanks to her turn as the vicious queen bee"
