        "text": "Lacey Chabert is known as the “Queen of Hallmark,” and in real life, she has her very own king. Who is Lacey Chabert’s husband? Keep reading to find out.\n\nChabert has been acting since she was a child. She briefly starred on All My Children as the daughter of Erica Kane before later gaining prominence on Party of Five. In 2004, Chabert landed one of her most iconic roles: Gretchen Weiners in the teen comedy Mean Girls. Since joining the Hallmark network in 2010, however, she’s become notorious for her heartwarming TV movies. Chabert now has over 30 Hallmark movies under her belt, including popular series like The Wedding Veil and Crossword Mysteries, as well as countless Christmas movies.\n\nWhile appearing on The Tonight Show in November 2022, she explained why she enjoys making Hallmark movies so much: “I think now more than ever, like, we just need some goodness in the world.” She continued, “People sit down in their living rooms for two hours, they give you their time and they’re left feeling uplifted. It’s joyful, that’s why I love being a part of it.”\n\nChabert’s most recent movie, 2023’s A Merry Scottish Christmas, premiered on Hallmark on Nov. 18 and saw her reunite with her Party of Five co-star Scott Wolf. The pair, who also serve as executive producers, star as estranged siblings who travel to Scotland for Christmas to reconnect with their mother Jo (played by Fiona Bell). Speaking to Yahoo Entertainment earlier that month about the movie, Chabert told the outlet that she loves Christmas and feels so “honored if people are associating [her] with the holidays.”\n\nWhen she’s not making romance and Christmas movies, she’s living her own real-life Hallmark love story. So, who is Lacey Chabert’s husband? Find out below.\n\nWho is Lacey Chabert’s husband?\n\nWho is Lacey Chabert’s husband? The Christmas Waltz star is married to David Nedhar. Chabert is very private about her relationship, so much so that she didn’t reveal she had gotten married until six months after she and Nedhar tied the knot. The couple got married on Dec. 22, 2013, and Chabert announced the news on Twitter in January 2014, writing: “I’m starting off 2014 as a Mrs! Over the holidays, my best friend & love of my life…we became husband & wife! #soblessed #love.”\n\nThe actress later explained why she kept their wedding news a secret, telling People, “I didn’t want it to feel like an event … I wanted it to be personal. He’s not in the business and we like our privacy, and I just think relationships are hard enough without the opinion of strangers. So we try to keep it as personal and private as possible.” She also called their wedding “perfect chaos,” explaining that there were some hiccups but none of it mattered to her. “I was in the middle of shooting a movie, and we planned the entire thing in about six weeks. The caterer quit two days before, my sisters’ dresses didn’t arrive and one of my shoes broke – crazy stuff like that. It was just nuts, but it was perfect at the same time,” she said.\n\nThe couple’s engagement also didn’t go according to plan, as Chabert wanted to know about the proposal ahead of time so she could get a manicure. However, her husband had other plans in mind and completely surprised her. “So there I am, so shocked and surprised that I literally don’t know what’s going on until he’s on one knee actually saying the words ‘Will you marry me?’” Chabert explained in an interview with the Hallmark Channel’s Home & Family. “I called my sister and I was like ‘Why didn’t you give me a heads up?’ And she said, ‘This is one time in your life where I know it’s going to be so important to be surprised, there’s so few surprises in life and I really wanted you to have that.’” She added: “And I’m so glad she did.”\n\nChabert and Nedhar welcomed their daughter, Julia Mimi Bella, on Sept. 1, 2016. The actress has been candid about how becoming a mother has changed her priorities, and she has shared her gratitude for Hallmark in allowing her the flexibility she needs to balance both her career and motherhood. “Now, [Julia’s] the most important thing, and it’s not only about my marriage but also what works for the family and the baby,” Chabert said during a 2017 appearance on the BUILD Series. “I am lucky that my job allows me to bring her to set with me, which is really nice.” She also shared some insight on her family dynamic, adding: “I’ve learned to ask for help. I have a very supportive husband, a very supportive family, and I’ve learned to ask for help and you just kind of figure it out as you go and do your best.”\n\nAlthough Chabert never shares photos of Nedhar and keeps their relationship off social media, she does post cute photos of their daughter. On Julia’s 7th birthday in September 2023, the proud mom shared a throwback photo of Julia as a newborn along with a more recent photo, writing in the caption: “From 7 days old to 7 years old💜My baby turns 7 today 🎉Happy Birthday, Julia!!!! You light up our lives with your sparkly spirit. We love you more than words can describe.”"
