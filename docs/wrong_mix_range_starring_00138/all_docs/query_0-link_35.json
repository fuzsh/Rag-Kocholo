        "text": "The Hallmark Channel may have a primary group of talent they work with but they also employ a wide range of actors you will recognize from more than just TV movies. Hallmark actors and actresses have been in everything from blockbuster films and niche science fiction flicks while also adding a Hallmark movie or two to their filmography.\n\nThis list of Hallmark channel actors is ordered by how many Hallmark Channel movies each actor has been in. Actors like Candace Cameron Bure, Victor Webster, Paul Greene, and Lori Loughlin are regular Hallmark movie actors and actresses, working in multiple films over the years. Lacey Chabert is the hardest working Hallmark actress of them all, starring in 12 movies for the Hallmark Channel. Some actors may have been in more movies across both the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies and Mysteries, but when it comes to just Hallmark Channel movies, she has everyone beat.\n\nBigger stars who have been in only one Hallmark movie include Meghan Markle, Mariah Carey, James Patrick Stuart, Danny Glover, Jane Seymour, and Tom Skerritt. It's surprising what other big names have shown up in a seasonal or romantic Hallmark film."
