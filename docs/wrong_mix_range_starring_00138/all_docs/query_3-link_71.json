        "text": "I googled it and don't know how accurate, but Candace Cameron Bure earns approximately 1million per year. Alicia Witt (cannot stand her) is around $150K, Lacey Chabert was $350K and Danica McKeller was in the neighborhood of $300K as well. I didn't look up any others. I tend to like simple, sappy movies on occasion so I watch most of the Hallmark movies.\n\nBig salary gap between Alicia Witt and Danica McKeller and Lacey Chabert. perhaps is because McKeller and Chabert were child stars, and Alicia Witt...well I have not seen her in anything bur Hallmark movies.\n\nI seriously doubt Google has an accurate number for B-List actors' salaries. Who cares enough about them to dig into the details of their various contracts to factually find out how much they really make? And I seriously doubt these actresses are making $100,000 per Hallmark movie. I've read it can take an A-lister TV star a few seasons to negotiate that per episode on their TV series. If it was that easy to make that amount for several weeks of work on a very low budget cable channel, more A-Listers would do it during their summer hiatus.\n\nIt was previously a real stigma to be caught dead in a cheesy Hallmark movie - even for B-Listers, probably the only thing worse than starring in a commercial. A-Listers don't want a reputation for cheesiness, they want to be thought of as sexy and provocative. Yet, now, since it's become a new (old) trend for celebs to be commercials again, like George Clooney & Danny DeVito in the coffeemaker commercial, Hallmark has been able to get better B-List actresses and former A-Listers, like in the upcoming movie with Kristen Davis, Eric McCormack, Shirley MacLaine. (They are also advertising it as a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie instead, to show that they aren't going to be hiring that calibre for every movie.)\n\nAlso, Hallmark notoriously films in Vancouver, Canada, so they can make their low budget movies and TV series much cheaper by not paying the movie & TV crews the union rates they would have to pay if filmed in the U.S. I'm sure that goes for the actors too. Hallmark is advertising that they have 19 new original movies just this season, split on their two channels. That is a lot of movies to have cranked out for an 8 week season.\n\nAs for the big salary gap between Alicia Witt and Danica McKeller and Lacey Chabert, Danica and Lacey both do a lot of voiceover work as well as other TV shows. Danica also starred in one of Hallmark's new summer movies. So that reported salary is not just for ONE Hallmark movie.\n\nDanica: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005211/?ref_=nv_sr_1\n\nLacey: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000327/?ref_=tt_cl_t1\n\nThank God Alicia doesn't do voiceovers with her high, shrill voice. I was actually on the subway a couple weeks ago and heard someone who, very loudly sounded just like Alicia Witt. I actually had to peer around someone to see if it really was her. It wasn't. I couldn't believe that another person has that same exact voice. I guess this is why she's in so many Hallmark movies. There are people who sound like her in real life.\n\nThere are plenty of A-lister doing commercials these days.\n\nYes, I said that a sentence later.\n\nYou're a little off base here; product endorsement contracts are BIG business for celebrities of all kinds, and have pretty much always been.\n\nCars are a great example, but also consider athletes with sports equipment, actresses with cosmetics and fragrances - some of these deals are worth more than their acting jobs I'd imagine.\n\nNo, actors acting in commercials, not celebrity endorsements - an actual celebrity, acting as themselves - fell out of favor for a while. They did do commercials, but usually they were overseas commercials, especially in Japan, where it IS big business, but not here in the U.S.\n\nI think it was partly because of J.K. Simmons, who does all those Farmers Insurance commercials (as a CHARACTER and not as himself,) and winning an Emmy and Neil Patrick Harris later humming the Farmers Insurance tune during the Emmys, and Matthew McConaughey doing a Lincoln car commercial after winning his Oscar, that it became popular again for A-Listers to ACT in commercials again as characters. Also, all the commercials celebrities did overseas can be found online. So they might as well do them here.And the more they are tweeted, talked about and in the public eye is a good thing.\n\nHere are four articles about the fact that it used to be such a stigma, especially if you are of the baby boomer generation. For millennials, not so. If I'm off base, so are The Washington Post. NY Times & Chicago Tribune. So I'm in good company.\n\nThe Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news...and-why-a-listers-continue-to-show-up-in-ads/\n\n\"Gone are the days when appearing in an ad was seen as lame and selling out — such as when Brad Pitt and George Clooney would film commercials exclusively overseas so the U.S. audience would never see.\n\nNow, it’s just common sense in an increasingly competitive marketplace to stay in the public eye however possible. It’s an added bonus if the celebrity genuinely likes the brand.\n\n“I think that because of digital media and social media, people are not afraid of that stigma to be a sell-out anymore,” said Pete Favat, chief creative officer at ad agency Deutsch in Los Angeles. “It used to be that if you considered yourself an artist, you would never sell out for commercial purposes. But the world is getting used to it and celebrities are getting used to it.”\"\n\n​\n\nChicago Tribune: http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-movie-star-sellouts-0224-20160224-story.html\n\n\"[Amy] Schumer's campaign-themed ad, which premiered during the Super Bowl and has played almost nonstop ever since, is one of many signs that hawking consumer goods on TV isn't just for has-beens and B-listers anymore.\" [...]\n\nAnyone old enough to worry about \"selling out\" — and, yes, the term does date you — will be scratching his or her head.\n\nBut experts say that millennials, the 83 million Americans between 15 and 34 who are increasingly driving consumer and popular culture, are quite comfortable with big actors plugging products. [. . .]\n\nBig movie stars who wanted to be taken seriously steered clear of TV ads — in the U.S., at least. By the 1980s, Paul Newman was doing commercials in Japan. In the 1990s, stars including Brad Pitt, Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster appeared in Japanese ads, according to Japander.com, which defines a Japander as \"a western star who uses his or her fame to make large sums of money in a short time by advertising products in Japan that they would probably never use.\" The word can also be used as a verb.\n\nThere was a ripple of surprise — and discontent — when Brad Pitt filmed a lamentably goofy Chanel ad that aired in the U.S. in 2012, and YouTube comments sections suggest that some viewers still see a TV ad as a step down for a star.​\n\nNew York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/12/business/worldbusiness/12iht-adco.3132673.html\n\n\"At some point in the last five years, Hollywood snobbery toward commercials seemed to evaporate, leaving only a few actors holding out. About 20 percent of ads in the United States feature celebrities, up from closer to 10 percent only a decade ago. [...]\n\n\"That old stigma that celebrities were selling out by doing a commercial has gone by the wayside,\" said Linda Kaplan Thaler, chief executive and creative officer of Kaplan Thaler Group, an ad agency owned by Publicis Groupe. \"The days of Brad Pitt doing a commercial in Japan that he thought no one was going to see are gone.\" [...]\n\nAs recently as 2000, it was common for celebrities to negotiate contracts that prohibited commercials they made elsewhere from being aired in the United States. Many celebrities saw the TV spots as potentially harmful to their reputations back home. . . [...]\n\n\"I think these days it's acceptable,\" said Camille Hackney, senior vice president for brand partnership and commercial licensing at Atlantic Records, which is owned by the Warner Music Group. \"In the artist community, you're no longer vilified if you do it, and for consumers, it's something that they come to expect.\" \"​\n\nFrom IBTimes: http://www.ibtimes.com/why-matthew-...al-signals-cultural-shift-ideas-about-1707077\n\n\"For years, A-list Hollywood treated TV commercials with extreme caution. While many felt free to shill products abroad -- a phenomenon illustrated by Bill Murray's character in the 2003 \"Lost In Translation\" -- TV ads were thought to be beneath serious movie stars. But McConaughey's presence is the most brazen indication that there’s not much of a taboo left, signaling a change in the notion of celebrity and the growing cachet of TV. What's more, “selling out” means little to many young people who’ve grown up with the idea of the celebrity endorsement and the understanding of celebrities as brands.\n\nThere just isn't a stigma to doing TV, or commercials on TV, anymore.\"​"
