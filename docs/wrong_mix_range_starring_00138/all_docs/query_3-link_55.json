        "text": "I just finished watching one of the Hallmark movies that I had DVR'd. It was one of Lacey Chabert's movies called \"The Sweetest Christmas\".\n\nI really enjoyed the movie but as I was watching it I realized that she and the actor playing the role of her former high school boyfriend just didn't seem to have much chemistry together.\n\nI've watched almost all of her Hallmark movies and I feel that she has the most chemistry with Brennan Elliott. He's the actor who starred with her in \"All Of My Heart\".\n\nWatching them together I could almost believe that they are a real-life couple. I know they aren't of course.\n\nI also realize it might be Brennan because he seems to have chemistry with all of his female Hallmark Movie co-stars.\n\nI even enjoyed him with Brooke Shields in the Flower Shop Mysteries.\n\nSo my questions are; What Hallmark movie actor do you think has the best chemistry with Lacey Chabert and do you like Lacey and Brennan working together?\n\n@J Town Girl, I watch a lot of the Hallmark movies but don't pay much attention to the actor's real names. I know Candace Cameron Bure because I was a regular Full House viewer. It was Candace starring in Hallmark movies which drew me to the network. I know Lacy Chabert because she is in a lot of them and I've seen her on that Home and Family Show, but I'm a bit stumped with many of the other actor's names.\n\nMy favorite Lacy Chabert Christmas movie is the one where she has a pararell time experience that she is a stay-at-home mother of two when in reality she is a business exec who lives for her work and makes no time for relationships and family. Her new one about the gingerbread contest is a good one (The Sweetest Christmas)\n\nAs for the men they seem pretty generic like Ken dolls. Good looking good guys. Nothing wrong with that. We should all be so lucky!\n\n@Trix you were able to put into words almost exactly what I was thinking but wasn't able to formulate. Most of these actors are interchangeable and like you, the actresses I know are the ones who appeared in series that I watched faithfully years ago like Candace and Lacey. The men I sometimes recognize but couldn't tell you their names if someone was going to pay me.\n\n@J Town Girl I look forward to reading others' responses but unfortunately I don't have much to contribute to the conversation.\n\n\"And suddenly you just know it's time to start something newAnd trust the magic of Beginnings...\"\n\nI don't notice the guys so much or their names either but there was one that recently was on with her where towards the end, she was throwing snowballs at a guy I think outside a restaurant or party or something (it wasn't the prince one), and maybe it was her good acting but they made that very realistic.\n\nI was wondering if they really would turn out to be a couple.\n\nAnd of course I don't remember the name of him or the movie!🙄 🤔\n\n\"If you walk the footsteps of a stranger, you'll learn things you never knew. Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains? can you paint with all the colors of the wind?\"\n\nITA with you! It was a good movie, but the actor (& also the kid) were poor choices.\n\nI really like Lacey in Hallmark movies. I agree that the All of My Heart actor has great chemistry with her....perfect.\n\nAnother Hallmark actor that I really like, & is great with Lacey, is Paul Greene (they were in A Wish For Christmas). I pretty much like anything he's in."
