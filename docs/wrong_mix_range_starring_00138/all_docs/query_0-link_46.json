        "text": "See who will be reimagining Rachel McAdams as Regina George and Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron in a big-screen musical version of the 2004 classic.\n\nMean Girls is going musical. The beloved—and highly quotable—2004 teen movie is coming back to the big-screen, this time as an adaptation of the 2017 Mean Girls Broadway musical. Tina Fey, writer of both the film and the stage show’s book, and Tim Meadows will reprise their roles as teachers at North Shore High School. The original Plastics Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, Lacey Chabert alongside their homeschooled recruit Lindsay Lohan are also reportedly in talks to make cameos—should Paramount+ agree to their rumored terms. But the rest of the cast is full of fresh, fetch faces—all of whom you can meet below."
