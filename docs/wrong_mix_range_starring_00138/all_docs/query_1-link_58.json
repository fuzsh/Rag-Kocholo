        "text": "In February of 2015, the Hallmark Channel released the film All of My Heart starring Lacey Chabert and Brennan Elliott. Little did they know that this film would capture the hearts and minds of Hallmark viewers around the country.\n\nNot only was the movie a ratings success, but it was so popular, that fans began overwhelming Hallmark’s social media sites and started an online campaign asking for a sequel. Well, the fine folks at the Hallmark Channel have heard the fans loud and clear.\n\nOn Saturday, October 7th at 9/8c, Lacey and Brennan are back for the sequel All of My Heart: Inn Love. We had the opportunity to sit down with Lacey to talk about coming back for the sequel, working with Brennan Elliott again and what she’d like to say to the fans who made this project possible.\n\nPop Culture Principle – Why do you think the first movie All of My Heart resonated so much with the fans?\n\nLacey Chabert – The feedback I’ve received on social media has consistently been that the audience could relate to the characters and really cared about the relationship between Brian and Jenny. Our characters are seen struggling with very common issues that relationships endure and I think perhaps people could see their own life mirrored in aspects of the characters. The movie was also funny and had a lot of heart-no pun intended!\n\nPop Culture Principle – When did you find out that the fans were campaigning for a sequel to All of My Heart and how did that make you feel knowing they were campaigning for a sequel?\n\nLacey Chabert – Whenever I make a movie, my greatest hope is that the viewers will relate to the character in some way and also be emotionally touched by the journey. When I saw the passion on social media from the fans for there to be a sequel,\n\nI was touched. It thrills me that I was a part of something that brought joy to the audience. I really appreciate the outpouring of support to continue this story. I’m very thankful to Hallmark that they allowed us to do this again!\n\nPop Culture Principle – The sequel is called All of My Heart: Inn Love. Does the second film pick up right after the engagement from the first movie?\n\nLacey Chabert – This movie picks up a few months later. Brian and Jenny are engaged, and busy preparing to open the inn.\n\nPop Culture Principle – Can you tell us the basic plot for All of My Heart: Inn Love?\n\nLacey Chabert – Brian and Jenny are just about to open the inn and are met with some obstacles along the way. Some of these scenarios are very funny and some pose more serious problems. The movie follows the journey of them dealing with the chaos and also introduces the audience to some new and familiar faces. I was so happy that many of the wonderful actors from the first one were able to join us on this one.\n\nPop Culture Principle – Once again you star opposite Brennan Elliott. Was it easy for you to both slip back into your respective characters?\n\nLacey Chabert – This is our third movie together. Brennan has become a very good friend. He’s such a talented actor. We have so much fun on set and work hard to always bring these two characters to life in the most real way possible. I’m so grateful that he’s my partner in this story.\n\nPop Culture Principle – You and Brennan have such great chemistry on screen. Can you talk about what it’s like working with him again?\n\nLacey Chabert – Thank you! He’s great at improv. I know he’s always going to come up with something hilarious. We are a bit like our characters in real life so the dynamic between the two of us comes from an organic place. We trust and respect each other and I think that creates a safe space for creative collaboration.\n\nPop Culture Principle – Will some of our favorite characters from the first movie be in the sequel?\n\nLacey Chabert – Yes! I think the audience will enjoy that many of our friends from the first one are back for this one. I was so happy that these wonderful actors were able and willing to come hang out with us again. Three of us had babies around the same time so our lives had changed in very similar ways in the past two and a half years.\n\nPop Culture Principle – Probably the most important question we can ask you is are the goats going to be back?\n\nLacey Chabert – The baby goats are back! They are different goats than the ones from the first movie though. They wanted them to still be babies and the previous baby goats had grown up. Sorry previous baby goats! These goats are even tinier and were just about the cutest things ever.\n\nThey were only three weeks old and still nursing on their mama, who plays Gabby. Whenever the goats were on set everyone was so happy! They are just adorable and were literally bouncing around. It was hard for the crew to focus when they were around because everyone just wanted to play with them!\n\nPop Culture Principle – What can fans look forward to with All of My Heart: Inn Love?\n\nLacey Chabert – My hope is the fans will enjoy continuing to watch Brian and Jenny’s relationship develop. The love that the characters share really is the center of the story. The relationship isn’t perfect, but it’s real.\n\nPop Culture Principle – If this sequel is successful, would you like to see a third film or would you like to see this become a franchise for the Hallmark Channel?\n\nLacey Chabert – I would be happy to do more of these films. I love the setting. Personally I’m from a small town so I like that the movie takes place in a small town where there is a real sense of community. I really enjoy working with the entire team behind bringing the movie to life. I also think there are so many funny and touching stories that could be told with the backdrop of running the B & B. I hope we have the opportunity to tell those stories.\n\nPop Culture Principle – Any final thoughts?\n\nLacey Chabert – I just want to add another thank you to all the people who supported the movie. You are the biggest reason we had the chance to do this again, so thank you. I hope you enjoy watching it as much as we enjoyed making it!\n\nWe would like to thank the wonderfully talented Lacey Chabert for talking with us. Remember, All of My Heart: Inn Love airs on the Hallmark Channel on Saturday, October 7th at 9/8c.\n\n**All photos Copyright 2017 Crown Media United States LLC/Photographer: Kailey Schwerman/Sven Boecker**"
