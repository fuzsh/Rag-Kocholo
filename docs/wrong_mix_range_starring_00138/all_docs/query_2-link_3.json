        "text": "Lacey Chabert may be best known for her role as Gretchen Wieners in Mean Girls (you know, the one whose hair is full of secrets). But the actress has made quite the career for herself outside of the “Plastics.” Yep, we’re talking about all the Lacey Chabert Hallmark movies, and we’re breaking down each one for you, from Moonlight in Vermont to her Wedding Veil film series. (And as if this comprehensive list of Hallmark movies weren't enough, Chabert has separately done a number of films for the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries Channel.)\n\nFrom her first movie over ten years ago (!) to another two that are premiering as part of the 2023 Hallmark holiday movie lineup—here are the 30 (yes, you read that correctly) Hallmark movies starring Lacey Chabert, from oldest to newest.\n\nRuntime: 88 minutes\n\nWhat happens when two very different people—a successful lawyer whose career is moving fast and a free-spirited woman with a carefree approach to life—get stuck together in a broken elevator? You guessed it, instant sparks. But their separate worlds might just be too far apart for them to have a successful relationship.\n\nRuntime: 83 minutes\n\nBaker Melanie Hogan’s romantic holiday plans with her workaholic boyfriend don’t go according to plan when a chance meeting with a mysterious Santa strands her and her boyfriend’s best friend Dean together. As you can imagine, it’s not long before Melanie starts to see that the man of her dreams may not be her boyfriend after all. Plus she finds some Christmas spirit along the way.\n\nRuntime: 86 minutes\n\nWhen Gina loses her husband on Christmas Day, she soon finds a kindred spirit in another parent at her kids’ school, Michael, who lost his wife at the same time. While trying to help their children work through their grief, they end up getting closer and falling in love. But some skepticism from family and friends have the couple questioning their new relationship. Warning: This one pulls at some heart strings.\n\nRuntime: 85 minutes\n\nWhen a highly ambitious anchorwoman makes one wish to an office party Santa (we’re serious), she wakes up the next morning to find she is married to her college sweetheart (with two kids), and her world is turned upside down. Just a special reminder to be careful what you wish for.\n\n*Only currently available to stream in the U.K.*\n\nRuntime: 83 minutes\n\nA single mother moves back to her hometown to start a new life with her young daughter. When the young girl has a hard time adjusting, she seeks out the help of her music teacher to write a song that she will sing at the annual Christmas Variety Show. Soon enough, an unexpected relationship begins between mother and teacher. Oh, and did we mention Mariah Carey also stars?\n\nRuntime: 84 minutes\n\nSara Shaw is the type of woman who prefers to sit on the sidelines at work. But when her big idea for a Christmas initiative is stolen, she makes a wish to Santa that she’ll finally have the courage to stand up for herself. The only catch? She only has 48 hours to do so. Will Sara speak her mind before the clock runs out?\n\nRuntime: 85 minutes\n\nAfter fast-paced New York City real estate broker Fiona Rangely gets dumped by her boyfriend, she escapes to her family’s quaint Vermont inn for a few days to slow down and evaluate her life. But when her ex-boyfriend, Nate, shows up with his new girlfriend, Fiona devises a plan to win back his affection: Pretend the handsome head chef Derek is her new boyfriend. The fake relationship quickly turns into a real one. We saw that one coming.\n\nRuntime: 84 minutes\n\nYep, this is the sequel to the first All of My Heart. Newly engaged Brian and Jenny's plans to open their new inn don’t go so smoothly when a surprise storm hits. With funds running low, Brian agrees to return to Wall Street, while Jenny scrambles to keep the inn opening on time. In the process, they find themselves leading separate lives and begin to feel a strain on their relationship.\n\nRuntime: 85 minutes\n\nWhen struggling pastry chef Kylie Watson learns she’s made it to the finals of the American Gingerbread Competition, she thinks her competitive spirit has finally paid off and hopes the publicity will help her jumpstart her new café. But as these things movies go, the oven she’s supposed to use breaks down. Desperate, she reaches out to her ex-boyfriend, Nick, who runs his family’s pizzeria. Obviously feelings rekindle and things get complicated when Nick takes drastic steps to win her back.\n\nRuntime: 86 minutes\n\nAfter Kira inherits a wildlife reserve in South Africa, she travels there to meet the no-nonsense head ranger, Tom. She learns the reserve is in financial jeopardy and she might have to sell it to her uncle's competitor. But, Tom urges her to save it by taking her on a safari in hopes that she will fall in love (with the animals and him).\n\nRuntime: 84 minutes\n\nIn the third installment, Jenny and Brian are planning their incredibly romantic wedding. Emily’s country inn is filled to capacity with family and friends when a distant relative of Emily’s arrives and stakes a claim to the house. Of course, the couple’s relationship will be tested as the wedding day approaches and they struggle to keep the house that brought them together in the first place.\n\nRuntime: 82 minutes\n\nBased on the book of the same title by Melissa de la Cruz, the film follows Darcy, a woman who has always worked hard to prove herself and be successful on her own terms (AKA start her own company, rather than joining the family business). When returning to her hometown for Christmas, Darcy reconnects with an old rival, restaurant owner Luke, and they are forced to plan a charity event together. We’re going to bet Darcy and Luke discover some romantic feelings for one another.\n\nRuntime: 84 minutes\n\nNew York accountant Emma Colvin is heartbroken when her boyfriend leaves her before their planned romantic getaway to Belgium for Valentine’s Day. Convinced by a friend to go alone on the trip, Emma is introduced to renowned chocolatier Luc Simon, who is in the midst of a competition to create the most romantic chocolate in Belgium for the upcoming Belgian royal wedding. Once Emma gets involved, a budding romance develops and the trip turns out to be the adventure of a lifetime.\n\nRuntime: 86 minutes\n\nChabert plays an independent-minded American tour guide named Angela, who is fired from her job in Rome just before Christmas. Ouch. She unexpectedly crosses paths with an American executive named Oliver, who wants to buy a high-end Italian ceramics company. He hires Angela to be his tour guide around the city, as the owner of the ceramics company won’t sell it to him until he learns “the heart and soul of Rome.” We’re going to take a guess and say he earns the heart and soul of Angela as well.\n\nRuntime: 83 minutes\n\nChelsea Whitmore is a hard-working event planner in L.A. who inherits a house in Vail and decides to move there after getting looked over for yet another promotion. When she moves into the chalet that once belonged to her baker uncle, Grady, Chelsea realizes that the home needs a lot of love, so she hires local contractor Owen. Of course, sparks fly.\n\nRuntime: 83 minutes\n\nAvery thinks she's getting her picture-perfect Christmas wedding...until her fiancé calls things off a month before the planned nuptials. In an act of resilience, Avery decides to go through with the ballroom lessons that she signed up for in order to prepare for her wedding dance. Little does she know that her instructor, Roman, might be the answer to all her problems.\n\nRuntime: 84 minutes\n\nThe first in a series of Wedding Veil films follows three best friends—Avery, Tracy and Emma—who discover a vintage wedding veil that is believed to connect its wearer with the love of her life. All the while, Avery (who is a museum curator), has discovered a long-lost piece of art, of whose origins she tries to uncover, with the help of a new board member named Peter.\n\nRuntime: 84 minutes\n\nIn this follow-up to The Wedding Veil, Emma decides she is going to research the mysterious veil that is said to bring love to whoever wears it.

Meanwhile, Avery has a surprise she wants to share with Peter, but she can't seem to find the right time. Thank goodness she has her two best friends, Emma and Tracy, to offer her words of guidance.\n\nRuntime: 84 minutes\n\nIn the final installment of the Wedding Veil sequel trilogy, Tracy and Nick decide to go on their long-delayed honeymoon to Greece. However, when the pair reach a secluded island, they have to face the issues they've been having in their relationship, all the while deciding the fate of the veil that has been so important to all the couples.\n\nRuntime: 90 minutes\n\nThe other Lacey Chabert-starring holiday film premiering on Hallmark this coming season is a sequel to her hit 2022 film, Haul Out the Holly.
