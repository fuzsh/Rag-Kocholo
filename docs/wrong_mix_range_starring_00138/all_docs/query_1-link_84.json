From reality competition to docu-follow series, Hallmark+ will offer subscribers a wide array of new, engaging content. These fresh takes on beloved genres are uniquely Hallmark, with heart at their core and giving fans the opportunity to get to know some of their favorite Hallmark actors as themselves, giving back to the community and bringing incredibly moving, fun and heartfelt stories to the audience. The announcement was made today during Hallmark Media's session at the Summer 2024 Television Critics Association Press Tour in Pasadena, CA.\n\n\"We're always looking for new ways to expand our content and grow our audiences while staying true to the Hallmark brand that people know and love,\" noted Lisa Hamilton Daly, Executive Vice President, Programming, Hallmark Media. \"Our unscripted slate is inspiring, heartwarming and entertaining, with a fresh authenticity so true to Hallmark's DNA.\"\n\nHallmark's first-ever reality competition series, Finding Mr. Christmas, will follow 10 promising Hallmark \"hunks\" who live together and compete against one another for the lead role in an upcoming original holiday movie, premiering later this year during Countdown to Christmas on Hallmark Channel. From festive physical challenges to emotional acting scenes, co-creator, executive producer and host Jonathan Bennett will be Finding Mr. Christmas in this new, eight-episode competition series filled with heart, premiering this Fall on Hallmark+.\n\nHallmark continues to tell the world's stories about love and family in two upcoming unscripted series including the previously announced Celebrations with Lacey Chabert, premiering mid-September.

In each episode, we meet different hometown parents with a big problem - their successful adult child is living far away in a big city - and is still single. The couple gathers their neighbors and asks for help to find a match for their them to go out with. Now, the entire community is on the hunt to find the best three daters for the \"city single\" to go on dates with, in the hopes that they will fall in love, move back home and live happily ever after.\n\nBased on Keshet Broadcasting's International Emmy(R)-nominated original format entitled Dear Neighbors.

In each episode, one family invites him inside a once-glorious house that has either been inherited or holds special meaning to them but is long overdue for some TLC. Luke works with a talented team to seamlessly blend the past and the present, creating a beautiful, reimagined space that feels refreshed and welcoming, but maintains the heart, love, and charm that has been present inside its walls for decades.\n\nHome is Where the Heart Is is from Maven Creative Media with Nikki Ray Media as production partner.
