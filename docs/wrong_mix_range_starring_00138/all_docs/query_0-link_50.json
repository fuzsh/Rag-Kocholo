        "text": "Andrew Walker has cemented himself as one of Hallmark Media’s biggest stars after making his network debut in 2012.\n\nThe Canadian actor first left his mark on viewers that year with A Bride for Christmas alongside Arielle Kebbel. The twosome reunited on camera for 2015’s Bridal Wave, which launched Walker into an even bigger name on Hallmark Channel.\n\nIn the decade that’s followed, Walker has become a household name — especially when it comes to his holiday movies, including several projects with pal Nikki DeLoach. The twosome teamed up in 2022 to launch Hallmark Movies & Mysteries’ Curious Caterer Mysteries.\n\n“It’s exactly what I would hope for in my evolution [on] Hallmark. Being on Hallmark for 10 years now and [nearly] 26 movies later, or whatever it is that I’m in, it’s crazy,” Walker exclusively told Us Weekly in February 2023 after the second mystery film debuted. “This is exactly where I want to be.”\n\nScroll down to see for a complete guide — and unofficial ranking — of all of the Hallmark star’s TV movies:"
