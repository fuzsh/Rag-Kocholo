        "text": "Now you know that we love a Hallmark Christmas movie. What can we say? In a world where everything seems bleak, we like to get lost in a story that ultimately we know will have a happy ending.\n\nThe queen of Hallmark movies can be debated and at one point we would have said it was Danica McKellar, but since she’s now moved to an exclusive contract with GACTV, we’re going to put that title on Lacey Chabert.\n\nChabert, who we’ve loved since her days on Party of Five, has made close to 30 Hallmark Channel movies. Though we love her, have to admit we haven’t seen them all, but we have seen all 11 of her Christmas movies for the channel.\n\nThe actress was interviewed by Insider and talked about why she makes the movies.\n\n“I think that Hallmark has done a wonderful job of telling stories that everyone can relate to,” she said.\n\nWe’d have to agree. While last year we were ready to give up on the network, because of their lack of inclusion and diversity, the channel has made a commitment and attempt to bring more diversity to the channel. Chabert remarked that “And I think they continue to try harder and strive to do that even more.”\n\nWe love seeing Chabert on our screens so we’re thankful that she loves working with the channel."
