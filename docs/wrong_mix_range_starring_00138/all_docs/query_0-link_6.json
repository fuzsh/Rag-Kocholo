In June 2000, Variety reported that Antonucci would direct in his directorial debut on an traditional 2-D hand-drawn animated comedy crossover film based on the television series Ed, Edd n Eddy and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. It was once expected to be released in 2003 under the title The Eds' Meet the Imaginary Friends, Production began in July 2001.\n\nIn October 2002, Warner Bros. Feature Animation (Warner Bros. Pictures) and Cartoon Network revealed the film's new title to be The Ed, Edd n Eddy Movie, which would be produced by Antonucci, with Jono Howard, Sioui, and Vincent writing the film's screenplay. In May 2003, it was announced that Mike Kubat would be added as a story writer.\n\nCasting[]\n\nAnimation[]\n\nThe film was animated in-house by Cartoon Network Studios in Burbank, California and a.k.a. Cartoon in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nToon Boom Animation's Toon Boom Harmony software was used as the main software package for the production of the film. The character animators found some difficulty with this approach, and decided to use traditional paper and pencil drawings, which were then scanned into the computer systems, for The Ed, Edd n Eddy Movie. Pencil on paper animation sequences would be digitally inked-and-painted, enhanced and composited into backgrounds using Toon Boom Harmony.\n\nThe character animation was done on paper without going through the clean-up animation department, and scanned directly into Photoshop. Danny Antonucci explained that they went paperless for The Ed, Edd n Eddy Movie to help them introduce the 2D pipeline. The artwork was then enhanced to affect the appearance of painted strokes and fills, and combined with backgrounds, using Adobe After Effects.\n\nThe visual effects and backgrounds for the film were created digitally using Wacom Cintiq tablet displays. The backgrounds were painted digitally using Adobe Photoshop, and many of the architectural elements were based upon 3D models built in Alias|Wavefront, Autodesk, Blender, Marionette, Maya, Mental Images and Softimage 3D. Much of the clean-up animation, digital ink-and-paint, and compositing were outsourced to second-party companies around the world.\n\nThe film's animation were done all domestically and overseas at Rough Draft Korea in Seoul, South Korea, Ontario, Canada, with additional animation done at Rough Draft Feature Animation in Seoul, South Korea and Los Angeles, California, Don Bluth Feature Animation in New York City, New York, United States, A. Film Production in Copenhagen, Denmark, Yowza! Animation in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Character Builders, Inc. in Columbus, Fil-Cartoons in Manila, Philippines, Funbag Animation Studios in Ottawa, Heart of Texas Productions, Inc. in Austin, Texas, Kroyer Films, Inc. in Hollywood, California, and Mr. Big Cartoons in Sydney, Australia and additional CGI animation done at Blur Studio in Culver City, California, United States.\n\nRelease[]\n\nThe Ed, Edd n Eddy Movie was originally going to be released in 2003; however, in February of 2001, the date was changed to 2004.
