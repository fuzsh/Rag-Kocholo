        "text": "Well, folks, it looks like Jenna Bush Hager is trading a job on daytime television for her acting debut!\n\nIn late June, Hallmark fans learned the network teamed up with the Kansas City Chiefs for a holiday movie that will premiere during the Hallmark Channel's annual Countdown to Christmas programming event. Titled Holiday Touchdown: a Chiefs Love Story, the film will star Hunter King, Tyler Hynes and Ed Begley Jr. and follow the story of a Chiefs fan trying to win the team's \"Fan of the Year\" contest.\n\nWhile most of the project details are being kept under wraps, Jenna shocked her co-hosts on the July 11 episode of the Today show with epic news about the movie. As she appeared on the air in a Chiefs jersey (specifically tight end Travis Kelce's uniform) and a Santa hat, she announced she'll be making her acting debut in a top-secret role at some point in the movie.\n\n\"It‚Äôs Christmas in July ‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve got a hot script!\" she wrote on Instagram after the news was revealed on TV. \"Pumped that I get to be a part of Hallmark‚Äôs upcoming holiday movie ‚Äî a Chiefs love story üèàüé¨üíì.\"\n\nWhen folks learned Jenna would be involved in this partnership between Hallmark and the Chiefs, it didn't take long for comments to roll in with anticipation.\n\n\"You had me at Christmas in July! üôåüíö‚ô•Ô∏èüéÖüèª,\" one fan exclaimed. \"Can't wait, you go girl!\" another person wrote. \"Congrats Jenna! Welcome to Chiefs Kingdom! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüèà,\" a different follower added.\n\nAlthough Jenna couldn't detail exactly how she'll be featured in Holiday Touchdown: a Chiefs Love Story, she isn't the only famous face making their Hallmark debut. Deadline reported she'll be joined by actual members of the Kansas City Chiefs, including head coach Andy Reid, wide receiver Mecole Hardman Jr., running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire and other players.\n\n\"With Hallmark and the Kansas City Chiefs both homegrown, rooted in values, tradition and community, there is a special alchemy between these two iconic organizations,\" said Lisa Hamilton Daly, Executive Vice President, Programming, per Deadline. \"By blending the warmth of Hallmark storytelling with the excitement of professional football, we are thrilled to give audiences a front-row seat to this community‚Äôs spirit, rich traditions and passionate fans that define Kansas City, all wrapped up in the comforting and uplifting Hallmark way.\"\n\nWe better start brushing up on our football lingo so we're prepared for this new holiday feature!"
