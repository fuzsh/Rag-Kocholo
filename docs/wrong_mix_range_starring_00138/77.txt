The film’s official logline reads, “Two years after losing her husband, Cathy magically brings a handsome snowman to life! Through his naïveté, the snowman helps Cathy to laugh, feel and love again, as the two fall for each other just in time for the holidays…and before he melts.”

Jerry Ciccoritti (“My Life with the Walter Boys,” “Schitt’s Creek”) will direct from a script by Russell Hainline (“The Santa Summit,” “In Merry Measure”).

Producers include Joel S. Rice (“Single All the Way,” “A Tourist’s Guide to Love”) and Michael Barbuto (“Never Too Late to Celebrate,” “Catch Me if You Claus”) for Muse Entertainment, while Aren Prupas and Jonas Prupas will executive produce.

“Hot Frosty” joins Netflix’s 2024 holiday slate, which includes the Lindsay Lohan starrer “Our Little Secret” and “Meet Me Next Christmas” starring Christina Milian.
