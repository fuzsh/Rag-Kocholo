        "text": "After opening for Taylor Swift at The Eras Tour and conquering a legion of fans, Sabrina Carpenter has reached the top with her latest singles, Espresso and Please, Please, Please. A naturally talented and charismatic artist, she never fails to amaze the public with captivating melodies and breathtaking performances.\n\nHer iconic fashion choices and signature looks also play a big role in her notorious rise – in fact, she is the main inspiration behind the whole blush blindness trend!\n\nAs a long-time fan, I couldn’t be happier that Sabrina is finally being recognized for her awesome music. Everything about her songs, from lyrics to production, has always been outstanding, and she only keeps improving. With her upcoming album Short n’ Sweet set to be released soon – on August 23rd, more specifically –, I thought this would be a great moment to do some sort of retrospective of her previous work and see how her music has evolved so far.\n\nFor those who have just started following Sabrina, this is the perfect opportunity to get to know her better and discover some older gems that, despite not being so popular, are just as good as her most famous hits. And, if you’ve been a fan since Girl Meets World, like me, I hope this jogs your memory and makes you even more excited for the new album!\n\nImage Credit: Justin Higuchi from Wikimedia Commons\n\nEyes Wide Open – 2015\n\nMy favorite tracks: Can’t Blame a Girl for Trying, Too Young and Right Now\n\nSabrina Carpenter was only fourteen when the first single from her debut album was released, and, regardless of her young age, she delivered stunning vocals and showcased a great personality. With 12 official tracks, most of the songs on this album are about girly teenage experiences, like falling in love for the first time, dreaming about the future, and trying to make the most of the present moment.\n\nIf I had to describe Eyes Wide Open in one word, I would say underrated. Even though the lyrics might sound kind of naïve at first, I believe they are actually quite relatable to young girls and inspire a positive outlook on growing up and navigating change — take Too Young and White Flag as an example.\n\nSo, if you want to enjoy some music that is both fun and uplifting, as well as to learn more about the very beginning of Sabrina's musical career, I highly recommend giving Eyes Wide Open a listen!\n\nEVOLution – 2016\n\nMy favorite tracks: Run and Hide, Thumbs and Shadows\n\nIn her sophomore album, Sabrina shows us a different side of herself while experimenting with her voice and new sounds. Mainly a dance-pop record with some R&B influence, EVOLution songs masterfully showcase Sabrina’s growth both as an artist and as a person.\n\nChoosing my favorite tracks from this album was not an easy task: all of them are beautifully produced and very fun in their own ways, although, I have to admit, there are two or three songs that sound a bit more generic and that don’t really stand out to me — but it's just personal preference.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning about EVOLution (and one of my favorite aspects of it) is how it covers a new range of topics that clearly differ from those in Eyes Wide Open, which makes sense considering the album title and the “more mature” vibe it wants to explore.\n\nIn short, EVOLution can be seen as the beginning of Sabrina's evolution to the beloved pop star we know today. It is a feel-good album with some great tracks that are definitely worth listening.\n\nSingular: Act I – 2018\n\nMy favorite tracks: Almost Love, Paris, and Diamonds are Forever\n\nSingular: Act I, Sabrina’s third album, feels like the perfect epitome of whatever was going on with pop music in 2018, and I personally love how she adds her own twist to that. With some notable R&B and EDM influences, Singular: Act I is effortlessly chic, captivating, and empowering.\n\nHere, Sabrina starts to show us a bit more of her charming and unserious personality through bolder lyrics and melodies, as well as to reaffirm her artistic potential with powerful vocals and undeniable charisma. The mesmerizing visuals and aesthetics of the music videos from this era only add to its awesomeness, and represent the beginning of a greater focus on Sabrina’s visual identity and storytelling, which was fundamental for her rise. No wonder why it is a fan favorite!\n\nSingular: Act II - 2019\n\nMy favorite tracks: Pushing 20, I Can’t Stop Me and Looking at Me\n\nAlthough itmight sound like a smooth continuation of Singular: Act I at first, without any major changes in the album’s concept or style, Singular: Act II is, in Sabrina’s words, “Act I upside down, where Act I makes you feel comfortable with yourself and Act II makes you feel a little uncomfortable with yourself”. She also describes it as “a more vulnerable side of confidence”, because “there’s confidence in being vulnerable” — and I couldn’t agree more.\n\nWhile tracks such as “I Can’t Stop Me” and “Looking at Me” focus more on the “confident” side, with sassy, fun, and empowering messages, songs like “In My Bed” and “Exhale” explore heavier themes, such as anxiety, overthinking and the constant pressure from being in the public eye. Compared to Act I, Act II is more experimental, embracing honesty, vulnerability, and singularity in an exquisite way.\n\nemails i can’t send – 2022\n\nMy favorite tracks: The. Entire. Album.\n\nThemed around e-mails she sent to herself (or that she couldn't send at all), emails i can't send has a bit of everything: from upbeat dance-pop tunes (such as Read Your Mind and Feather) to personal, sincere, and introspective lyrics (as can be seen in opposite and decode, for example), in this album, Sabrina reclaims the narrative that almost destroyed her and gets the chance to tell her side of the story.\n\nI really tried to keep it serious about choosing my favorite tracks, but I simply couldn’t: emails i can’t send is, in my humble opinion, pop perfection. Sabrina excelled in absolutely every way here: her songwriting skills are stronger than ever, and the production does not disappoint. For me, that makes it a no-skip album.\n\nNo matter how much I try and write, emails i can’t send is simply too beautiful for words. If I were you, I would go listen to this masterpiece right now – just prepare yourself for an emotional rollercoaster beforehand!\n\nFinal thoughts"
