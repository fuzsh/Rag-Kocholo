Woessner’s book presents a rich, interdisciplinary exploration of the many texts, thinkers, and traditions that made this transformation possible—from the novels of Hamlin Garland, James Jones, and Walker Percy to the philosophies of Stanley Cavell, Martin Heidegger, and Søren Kierkegaard to road movies, Hollywood Westerns, and the comedies of Jean Renoir. Situating Malick’s filmmaking within recent intellectual and cultural history, Woessner highlights its lasting contributions to both American cinema and the life of the mind.\n\nTerrence Malick and the Examined Life suggests it is time for philosophy to be viewed not merely as an academic subject, overseen by experts, but also as a way of life, open to each and every moviegoer. A discussion about the book between Martin Woessner and Courtney Stephens will be followed by a screening of Arthur Penn's Western The Left Handed Gun.\n\nThursday, May 23 2024\n\nSTREETWISE\n\n(1984, dir. Martin Bell, 91min)\n\nIntroduced by Sam Sweet of All Night Menu in celebration of the release of Please Come Home: Back Pages of the L.A. Free Press 1966-1974!\n\nExpanded from a Life magazine exposé by Mary Ellen Mark and Cheryl McCall on the underside of America's then \"most livable city,\" Streetwise documents homeless and runaway teenagers in Seattle in the early 1980s. It orbits remarkably close to its young subjects, who ricochet between innocence and experience as they survive—hustling, scrounging, and creating alternate worlds for themselves. Free from the kind of moral intervention one might expect today, the film remains a devastatingly beautiful document of Rat, Tiny, Lillie, Munchkin and others: the young cast outs of a broken society. The screening will be paired with a brief talk by Sam Sweet, who will discuss his book Please Come Home, comprised of back pages from The Los Angeles Free Press. The first, and largest of the counterculture newspapers that sprouted in Los Angeles in the late 1960s, the paper grew in tandem with a generation of teenage runaways, who treated its back pages as a test plot for uncensored desires. In turn, desperate parents embedded messages among ads for marijuana seeds, group sex, and crash pads, hoping to be seen by the children who had abandoned them.\n\nThe following event is at Now Instant Image Hall!\n\nFriday, May 3 2024\n\nLETTER FROM SIBERIA + Eternal current events book release\n\n(1957, dir. Chris Marker, 61min)\n\nBefore making his first films in the 1950s, Chris Marker was a regular contributor to the Paris-based magazine Esprit from 1946 to 1952. Unbound by genre or form, Marker's pieces range from short stories, essays, poems, and reviews to fabricated reportage and invented news affairs, all gemmed with the hallmarks of his style: a blurring of reality and imagination, a wry sense of humor, a sustained political engagement, and, of course, a limitless curiosity for animal life. Eternal current events marks the first time these exemplary works are available in English, published in an adapted facsimile of the original periodical. In these short selections, what one encounters is less a past life before his turn toward cinema than a preamble to his celebrated body of work. Moving images did not replace Marker’s production as a writer but were incorporated into it. Before the “imaginary films” there were “imaginary current events”; before the travels through time in La Jetée there was a bulletin rethinking the psychogeography of the around-the-world trip; and before the musings on a Japanese temple consecrated to cats in Sans Soleil, there was a summary report on the theological implications of the 1952 Parisian Cat Fair. Marker did not just begin his career as a writer, he remained one throughout his life.\n\nSaturday, February 24, 2024\n\nPERSONAL ETHNOGRAPHIES\n\n(dir. Ross Lipman, 80 minutes,1997 - 2024)\n\nRoss Lipman in person and several featured artists in attendance!\n\nA rotating assemblage of video fragments, cine-poems, and portraits of figures from the Los Angeles underground and international film community, made and compiled by filmmaker and archivist Ross Lipman. Shot over the course of nearly three decades, the pieces derive from a range of sources: oral histories, abandoned projects, DVD featurettes, and event footage, as well as home movies. The earliest is a 16mm home movie from the groundbreaking Total Mobile Home Microcinema in 1995; the newest is a phone cam improv shot in filmmaker Craig Baldwin’s basement last November. Featured subjects include experimental film master and Canyon Cinema-founder Bruce Baillie in his last recorded interview; the cast of Charles Burnett’s Killer of Sheep reuniting at a defunct LA diner before the restoration premiere in 2007; the former dishwasher, rocket scientist, Vaudeville one-man band, and cult film legend Sid Laverents; as well as documentation from the Center for Land Use Interpretation, Smart Gals Speakeasy founder Christine Berry, and the Los Angeles sub-Cacophony Society. Individually these testimonies reveal a close-up glimpse of a person or scene; together, they paint a larger portrait of the lives of artists -- from their earliest stages to their culminations, as well as the in-between moments we all pass along the way.\n\nSpecial thanks to: UCLA Film & Television Archive, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Oral History Program, The Association of Moving Image Archivists, Milestone Films, and Kino Lorber.\n\nThursday, December 7, 2023\n\nCe gamin, là (1975, Dir: Renaud Victor, 96min)\n\nPresented and introduced by Perwana Nazif!\n\nAfter seeing his film Le Moindre Geste (1964-71), Renaud Victor, a self-taught filmmaker and part-time plumber, wrote to Fernand Deligny and visited him in Monoblet, in the rocky chaos of the Cevennes region in France. Victor wanted to make a film on the informal living community—the network—that Deligny wrote from and lived within: a collective, experimental community largely made up of nonverbal autistic children and “close presences” (présence proche), or nonprofessional (non-)educators who were former workers and artisans. Tentative in every sense, the network was neither located within the institutional psychotherapy movement nor anti-psychiatry, but ran counter to calcified ideological currents of pathology and cure. It was Deligny who set the condition for Ce gamin là: Victor was to live among the network in the rural Cevennes, which he did for three years. François Truffaut (Deligny’s interlocutor) guaranteed the financing of the film. And much like the network itself, and Deligny’s writings, Ce gamin là was collectively authored, rejecting the idea of a subject and/or object for the film, opting instead for sequences of gesture, visual spatialization, poetics, and abstractions. As Deligny states in the movie: “language disappeared as one may say of the sun.” The subject sets, and a clearing emerges where we are open to the possibility of other modes of collective autistic existence; a cleavage possible only in the effacement of self itself, and the possibility of ce gamin, là, That kid, there.\n\nThursday, July 27, 2023\n\nTOPOS (1985, Dir: Antoinetta Angelidi, 85min)\n\nLos Angeles premiere!\n\nVirtual Q&A with Angelidi and her daughter / film professor Rea Wallden, moderated by Emile Klein.\n\nApplying philosophers Hélène Cixous' écriture feminine and Luce Irigaray's sexual difference —proposals to forge pathways outside of literature and psychoanalysis' masculine sub-structures—Antoinetta Angelidi's Topos invites viewers to ask: when the eyes on women are women, how do death, birth, and sex find configurations outside the hold of received meaning? Feminist and avant-garde filmmaking both have their genesis in the spirit of revolution, and Topos (Land) is Greece's post-dictatorial molotov. Uncanny symbols shift out of time, aimed to ignite the image-bound unconscious. The spectral tableaux call to mind Paradjanov's Color of Pomegranates as if filtered through Marion Woodman's writings on the feminine psyche. But where Paradjanov uses poetic imagery to speak to a felt past, Angelidi explodes the poetics of the past. Who are the women of Balthus, Cranach, Pierro Della Francisca, or Paolo Ucello when liberated from their pygmalion frame? In Angelidis' painterly vision, the diorama's shift; light blossoms into acousmatic sound, or a snake’s biblical invitation. Upon its release in 1985, the film screened at the Pompidou, MoMA, the Locarno Film Festival, and was recognized by Cahiers du Cinéma, but somehow skipped Los Angeles.\n\nThursday May 18, 2023\n\nTHE BIRTH (1971, Dir: Michel Auder, 6min) and FAMILY CHRONICLES CHAPTER IIV (1973, dir: Michel Auder, 7min)\n\nVIVA VIVA (2004, Dir: Nick Nehez, 20 min)\n\nAlexandra Auder in Person!\n\nAn evening celebrating the release of Alexandra Auder’s new memoir Don't Call Me Home with video diaries and readings that span decades within a family of celebrated artists. Alexandra Auder was born in 1971 to the Warhol legend Viva and the artist Michel Auder. Collaborating with Viva, in his series Family Chronicles, Michel captured the family’s early years at the Chelsea Hotel, their travels through France, Morocco, and California, and his daughter’s own birth, which he often played for a young Alexandra on repeat on his video monitor. Auder’s new book picks up shortly after these “video memories” fade and her parents split. Following a handful of years on the road with her mother, in which she served as a devoted confidant, and sometimes a caretaker, she lands back at the Chelsea for the remainder of her adolescence, going on to act in films by her father, Jodie Foster, and Wim Wenders, before leaving for college. A mostly affectionate look at the charismatic, wildly beautiful, and supremely talented Viva (a writer and painter in addition to actress) Auder’s memoir also considers the strain of growing up in—and out of—her family of origin, and how her deep love for her mother can mingle with an all-consuming rage in the present. In Viva Viva, she and her husband, Nick Nehez, mine some of this conflict in their portrait of Viva in later years as she mounts an exhibition of her paintings.\n\nThe following event is at 2220 Arts + Archives!\n\nWednesday, April 19th, 2023\n\nMILESTONES (1975, Dir: Robert Kramer and John Douglas, 195m)\n\n7:00 pm doors, 7:30 pm film\n\nTickets $15. Purchase here.\n\nPresented with Mezzanine / introduction by Courtney Stephens and Kate Wolf\n\nRobert Kramer and John Douglas’s novel-like epic is one of the great films about the American Left, a trailblazing hybrid of documentary and fiction that captures the seismic changes experienced by radical young men and women who came of age with the Vietnam War. Wandering from Vermont to Utah, shot in verité-style 16mm with dozens of speaking roles, the film follows the filmmakers’ friends—mostly white, middle-class activists, militants, nomads and commune-dwellers—all of whom either play versions of themselves or craft separate personas (including the writer Grace Paley, co-director Douglas and producer David C. Stone) in scenes that are either clearly staged or all too real. Writing in Cahiers du Cinéma, critic Serge Daney called it the “anti-Nashville”; released the same year as Altman’s satire, the film is both less prescriptive and more introspective, capturing how the fervor of political ideas gives way to the unwieldy vagaries of language and personal experience.\n\nThursday, February 13, 2020\n\nDUET FOR CANNIBALS (1969, Dir: Susan Sontag, 105 min)\n\nRereleased by Metrograph Pictures! Tickets at door $8!\n\nDuet for Cannibals was Sontag’s feature film debut, commissioned by the Swedish production company Sandrews in the late in 1960s and produced at the height of her fame as an essayist and public intellectual who wrote often on cinema. A “superbly secco film,” in the words of Wayne Kostenbaum, modeled after the indeterminate plots of Godard, Bresson and Bergman, Duet centers on the quadrangular relationship formed between two couples: an arrogant, middle-aged Marxist philosopher named Bauer and his elegant young wife Francesca as well as an earnest student revolutionary, Tomas, and his lover, Ingrid. When Tomas is hired by Bauer to help him edit his memoirs, a series of erotic provocations and power plays ensue, veering into violence. Though some critics regarded the film harshly upon its release, Sontag continued to make movies including 1974's Promised Lands and Unguided Tour in 1983. Adam Nayman writes: \"Whatever we are to make (or not) of Duet For Cannibals, there is something in the way it invites our curiosity and scrutinizes our impulses that makes it a worthy companion to Sontag’s criticism. That she loved watching movies was undeniable; her achievement as a director was to make something that generates the uncanny feeling that the movie is watching us.\"\n\nSunday, January 19\n\nNATHALIE GRANGER (1973, dir. Marguerite Duras, 79 min)\n\nFrench novelist Marguerite Duras (Hiroshima Mon Amour) directs this elliptical, minimalist film about the domestic space of women, in which dull rituals mask an undercurrent of lurking violence. Jeanne Moreau and Lucia Bose costar as two friends who worry about the violent behavior of Bose's daughter, discuss the immigration status of their housekeeper, and contemplate news about escaped convicts as they do the morning dishes. A young Gerard Depardieu appears as a door-to-door salesman, mistaking their nonchalance as an invitation to linger. A precursor to the work of Chantal Ackerman and Claire Denis, Nathalie Granger is a landmark of women's cinema. \"...the ghost of Pinter's wit walks over the grave of the film.\" (Vincent Canby, The New York Times).\n\nThursday, Jan 9th\n\nUNAUTHORED GESTURES: Anonymity and the authorless in artists’ film and video.\n\nAn illustrated talk and screening presented by Mark Toscano\n\nA work of media art is typically received as a willfully and expressly authored creation—the evidence and intention of the artist theoretically resting behind every aspect of the work. But there is also a rich history of art in which chance, uncertainty, automation, the deliberately arbitrary, as well as other related impulses and forces are activated by artists to complicate authorship. This illustrated talk will examine different ways in which film and video artists have experimented with various modes of authorship— including non-authorship itself — to result in work that engages in a dialogue with anonymity. Originally presented in 2017 at the Elias Querejeta Zine Eskola in San Sebastian, the illustrated talk will run approximately 45 minutes, and will be followed by a screening of approximately 60 minutes, featuring work by Rebecca Baron & Doug Goodwin, James N. Kienitz Wilkins, Jen Proctor, Scott Stark, and more.\n\nThanks to the artists for generously letting me screen their work, and to Carlos Muguiro at EQZE for the original invitation to present this talk. - Mark Toscano\n\nThursday, April 25th\n\nVideo In Site: The Suburbs\n\nOrganized by artists Maura Brewer + Paul Pescador\n\nThe third in the citywide Video in Site series, originated at LACE, this night of short artist films explores the American suburb; its ennui and secret afflictions. The series revolves around the question of Los Angeles as it appears in digital space, where images of the city reverberate as they do in the movies, but differently. Translated, reconstructed, and synthesized back into the medium reflective of its origin, these films critique and celebrate the city’s identity zapped onto cell phones, lingering in Netflix queues and calling out from Youtube playlists, a landscape against which the artist glides. Expect locked doors, doppelgangers, teen trouble, pornstars, and beloved pets.

She meets an elusive, brooding man who seems to offer respite and enabled by Carrington’s own defiantly mysterious mythology, she descends into a world of obsession. Shot on a 1980s Camcorder that evokes home movies as well as underground horror films, and punctuated by appearances from a cast of UK cultural figures such as Marina Warner, Juliet Jacques, and Tom McCarthy, Female Human Animal is both document and fiction, a psychological thriller set within the contemporary art world, and an homage to the guiding feminist spirit of Carrington, who is featured, at 80, in an archival interview.\n\nThursday, February 21st\n\nSURREAL ESTATE [Sérail] (1976, Dir: Eduardo de Gregorio, 83 mins)\n\nRivette collaborator Eduardo de Gregorio directs this dream tale about a house-hunting English novelist who finds himself ensnared by two sexpot ghosts (or possible scam artists), blonde and brunette. The beguiling Bulle Ogier and Marie France Pisier, leading ladies of Celine and Julie Go Boating's film within a film, conspire with Leslie Caron to ensure our protagonist never figures out \"which side of the mirror\" he is on. De Gregorio, a one-time student of Borges and screenwriter on Celine and Julie, produced an unusual, belletristic body of work, with coordinates drawn from a 19th century literary mode, as Jonathan Rosenbaum notes, with according explorations of the Old Dark House. These houses, Rosenbaum writes, serve \"as time machines that are also thresholds into alternate realities, which in Borgesian terms might be described as alternate fictions.\"\n\n2018\n\nThursday, October 25\n\nCAN DIALECTICS BREAK BRICKS? (1973, Dir: René Vienet, 82 mins)\n\nPresented by and with an introduction by Tim Leanse!\n\nWith nothing less at stake than conquering alienation without alienated means, René Viénet’s Can Dialectics Break Bricks? (La dialectique peut-elle casser des briques?) infamously appropriates a kung-fu movie in it’s entirety, hilariously re-dubbing a completely new dialogue rife with edgy Marxist critique to transform the narrative of a stock martial arts flick into a story of proletarians struggling against capitalists and bureaucrats alike. Dialectics is perhaps the most fun and raucous film to emerge from the activity of the Situationist International – a cadre of radical intellectuals, artists, and political theoreticians active from 1958 to 1972. Created the year following the group’s dissolution, the film remains a classic and relatable example of détournment - the Situationist technique of re-purposing elements of an existing artwork or cultural product to create a wholly new work with a new, subversive meaning. With Dialectics, Viénet takes aim at a range of favorite Situationist targets – from commodity ideology to the French Communist Party – and agitates for a number of Situationist interests: sexual equality, radical subjectivity, and - of course - détournment itself! Indeed – from the outset – Dialectics touts itself as the “first entirely detourned film in the history of cinema!”\n\nSunday, July 8\n\nTHREE LIVES (1971, Dir: Kate Millett, 70 mins)\n\nA LITANY FOR SURVIVAL: THE LIFE AND WORK OF AUDRE LORD (1995, Dir: Ada Gray Griffin and Michelle Parkerson, 60min)\n\nA double feature of rare films of feminist foremothers and intimate language. Made with profits from the paperback sale of her enormously influential 1970 book of feminist literary criticism, Sexual Politics, Three Lives was Millet’s only venture into filmmaking (she was also a sculptor). The film was shot collaboratively with an all female crew and features a trio of frank, spirited accounts by woman of varying backgrounds (including Millet’s younger sister) of formative episodes and struggles for independence within their own lives. Critic Melissa Anderson writes, “Born of the then thriving personal-is-political impulse, Three Lives records a specific moment in another era yet still remains vital and absorbing today.”\n\nFollowed by A Litany For Survival, a tender portrait of poet, educator, activist, and black feminist Audre Lorde. Co-directed by a former student of Lorde’s and shot over eight years (by the artist Arthur Jafa), the film deals intimately with Lorde’s battle with breast cancer, her early forays into poetry and activism, and her influence on other writers such as Adrienne Rich and Sapphire. While the power and eloquence of Lorde’s self-expression made her an internationally recognized figure, she always maintained she didn't want to be mythologized. Rather she advocated for others to find their voices and she fought fearlessly to make sure they would be protected in doing so.\n\nThe following event is at Blum and Poe, for Acid-Free Art Book Fair!\n\nSaturday, May 3 @ 3pm\n\nText and the City Expanded\n\nLos Angeles is a textual city: signage, billboards, graffiti, and programmatic architecture are defining elements of its visual realm. Jubilant and provocative, bright, bold, and occasionally electrified, the signs of Los Angeles punctuate the city's wide open vistas; they are as much eccentricity as they are a capitalist necessity, vying for the attention of passing motorists. Through a combination of experimental films, documentaries, and archival surveys, this program will examine graphic design and advertorials in L.A.'s public sphere. A short documentary from the mid-1990s captures the phenom Angelyne a decade after her self-promotional billboards first made her famous. Home movies shot by visitors to L.A. from the 1920s onward record early neon, creative billboards (including an animatronic washerwoman with visible bloomers), and changing street sign design, as well as a graphic sphere that shifted with the decades. Thom Andersen’s recent Get Out of the Car, focuses on billboards, hand-drawn murals, and signage as a means of talking about the fragility of material culture in a city that seems quick to rewrite itself.\n\nThe following event is at California Institute of the Arts!\n\nThursday, April 19 @ 4:30pm\n\nText and the City\n\nLos Angeles is a textual city: signage, billboards, graffiti, and programmatic architecture are defining elements of its visual realm.

In films, there is the wind that blows and the wind that is produced by a wind machine. Computer images do not have two kinds of wind.” — Harun Farocki\n\nHarun Farocki’s four-part Parallel ​cycle ​deals with the image genre of computer animation. The series ​of short films, each around 10 minutes long, are comprised of imagery created within these simulated environments, and they revel in the strange physics found there. The Parallel films focus on the construction, visual landscape, ​and rules of computer-animated worlds, and raise questions about the inherent value of tangibility. How do the physics of simulation resemble or diverge from those of the real world? What is the nature of substance that is not a substance? –that is generated by the gaze that falls upon it? Drawing on ideas within the films, experimental filmmaker Courtney Stephens and artist-writer Jim Supanick will ​present readings, images, and live performance in playful response to Farocki’s Parallel cycle.\n\nThursday, March 22nd\n\nA History of Working Girls on Television\n\nCo-presented with the UCLA Film & Television Archive as part of their \"Working Girls: America's Career Women on Screen\" series, with support from Women in Film Los Angeles.\n\nIntroduction by visual history co-curators KJ Relth and Suki-Rose Simakis!\n\nChange into your comfy “walking to work before you put on pumps” sneakers and come with us on a journey through one of the most significant, prolific and underrated mediums to explore women within the workforce: The Great American TV Sitcom. From Mary Tyler Moore to Veep, TV has served as home to a diverse range of stories and voices often untold on film. The vastness of fillable airtime has fueled TV’s ability to break ground, take risks, and show women in the workplace in a new, more nuanced light. That’s not to say it’s been sunshine and candy, or that the sitcom has always been on the right side of history when it comes to workin’ women--but it’s all worth examining (both the good and the bad) when tracing the lines from where we’ve been to where we are now, on to where we would like to be in the future. We’ll take you on a visual tour through Women in the Workplace in the great American TV sitcom in the form of a video mix highlighting the triumphs and upsets traversed by our beloved female sitcom pioneers throughout the decades.\n\nThe following event will take place at The Hammer Museum!\n\nSaturday, March 31\n\nLOST LANDSCAPES OF NEW YORK (Dir: Rick Prelinger, 2017, 85min)\n\nRick Prelinger in person!\n\nSince 2006, film historian and archivist extraordinaire Rick Prelinger has presented 21 participatory urban history events to enthusiastic audiences in San Francisco, Detroit, Los Angeles, Oakland and at festivals throughout the world. For the first time, he is bringing his Lost Landscapes project to New York City. Lost Landscapes of New York mixes home movies by New Yorkers, tourists and semi-professional cinematographers with outtakes from feature films and background “process plates” picturing granular details of New York’s cityscape. The combination of intimate moments, memories from many New York neighborhoods, and a variety of rare cinematic perspectives forms a 21st-century city symphony whose soundtrack will be provided by the audience. Viewers will be invited to comment, to ask questions and to interact with one another as the screening unfolds.\n\nThursday, March 8\n\nBABY BOOM (Dir: Charles Shyer, 1987, 103min)\n\nCo-presented with the UCLA Film & Television Archive as part of their \"Working Girls: America's Career Women on Screen\" series, with support from Women in Film Los Angeles.\n\nDiane Keaton is J.C. Wiatt, aka The Tiger Lady, a high-power executive at a Manhattan consulting firm, angling to make partner, relishing in her sexy success. A quintessential 1980s yuppie, J.C. spends her time away from work, working, in a tastefully decorated Modernist apartment she shares with her equally successful \"significant other,\" an investment banker named Steven. Her job is imperiled however, when, out of the blue, she is named guardian of the one-year-old Elizabeth after the death of a distant relative. Initially reticent, J.C. soon takes to motherhood with professional gusto. But her boss warns she can't have it all. With a move to Vermont, a romance with the local veterinarian (a tenderhearted Sam Sheppard) and the launch of her new gourmet baby food business aimed at discriminating consumers like herself, she proves him wrong. Equal parts farce and fairy tale, the film showcases a dazzling performance by Keaton. Though her J.C. is spared failure or real hardship in the transition to booming entrepreneur, the story of a woman at odds with her own—and everyone else's—expectations for excellence in all things still seems relevant.\n\nSunday, February 4\n\nMARIA, PEASANT ELEGY [ Мария ](Dir: Alexander Sokurov, 1988, 41min)\n\nTHE LITTLE GIRL WHO SOLD THE SUN [LA PETITE VENDEUSE DE SOLEIL] (Dir: Djibril Diop Mambety, 1999, 45min)\n\nFrom Russia and Senegal respectively, Maria and The Little Girl Who Sold the Sun are two cine-novellas (each around 40 minutes) that depict the labor of a woman, framed against eternity, but also upon the chilled surface of the state. With Maria, Alexander Sukhorov documents the life of a robust, engaging farm worker in a rural peasant community, which he then returns to a decade later in the twilight of the Soviet Union. In The Girl Who Sold the Sun, Djibril Diop Mambety dramatizes the story of a girl with a bum leg, who wants to make money for her grandmother, and begins selling the government newspaper in a city of obstacles. Both films explore the limits of the body, challenging the idea of a work ethic wrought by ideology, and drawing portraits of private adversity in its place.\n\nThe following event will take place at Cinefamily!\n\nThursday, August 10\n\nZanzibar Opening Night / Rare Clips with Jackie Raynal\n\nJackie Raynal in person!\n\nAn almost-lost, eccentric period of French film history, the Zanzibar films mark a spurt of ingenuity borne of a revolutionary time, and are ripe for rediscovery. Film programmer, editor, and filmmaker Jackie Raynal joins us for an evening of rare clips and images that will take us on a tour through the Zanzibar moment. From Philippe Garrel and model-muse Zouzou to artist Danielle Pommereulle, the Zanzibar scene was a cast of characters as much as it was a film movement, and Raynal was at the center of it.\n\nThe following event will take place at Cinefamily!\n\nThursday, August 11\n\nTHE INNER SCAR (1972, dir. Philippe Garrel, 60 min)\n\nCHROMO SUD (1968, dir. Etienne O'Leary, 21 min)\n\nJackie Raynal in person!\n\nA film like no other, The Inner Scar (La cicatrice intérieure) is a seductive and mysteriously existential ramble through various barren landscapes, helmed by Velvet Underground chanteuse Nico (who provides songs for the film), Pierre Clementi, director Philippe Garrel himself (with whom she had a ten year relationship), and even Nico’s son. You’ll recognize the cover the 1970 album Desertshore as being plucked from this gorgeous, primal moan of a film.\n\nThough he only made three films, Etienne O’Leary’s work is an impactful feat of editing. Peripheral to the Zanzibar group, but an ideal companion, Chromo Sud is a pulsing, psychedelic drug fueled freakout in which shots from the barricades of May ‘68 protests become a single, layered, flashing, collage for 21 vital minutes.\n\nThe following event will take place at Cinefamily!\n\nSaturday, August 12\n\nAn evening with Jackie Raynal + DEUX FOIS (1968, dir. Jackie Raynal, 65min)\n\nJackie Raynal in person!\n\nWhile Jackie Raynal is best known as the former programmer of two of New York’s premiere art cinemas—the Carnegie Hall and the Bleecker Street—she began her career in film nearly forty years ago in Paris, where by 1964 she was the youngest film editor in France, editing for Éric Rohmer among others. Challenged by Zanzibar patroness Boissonnas to stop editing other people’s films and make her own, Raynal traveled to Barcelona, where she completed Deux Fois (translated as Two Times, or playfully, Twice Upon a Time) in a single week. One of the most enigmatic of the Zanzibar films, it is composed of a series of unconnected episodes, some of which are repeated. The film begins with a prologue in which Raynal (carefully made-up and fashionably dressed) is seated, head lowered and hands joined in prayer, before both her dinner and her film. While Deux Fois lays claim to the Surrealist legacy of Buñuel and Cocteau, it gained critical recognition as a pioneering work within the burgeoning feminist cinema.\n\n—Sally Shafto\n\nThe following event will take place at Pasadena's Laemmle Playhouse!\n\nJune 30-July 2\n\nTHE REAGAN SHOW (2017, & Sierra Pettengill & Pacho Velez, 74 min)\n\nFree tickets for evening shows / email Courtney!\n\nThe Reagan Show assembles archival materials from the Reagan Administration’s 1980s reign, tracking the public-relations battle behind the Cold War's tumultuous end, highlighting the key role that Reagan's use of film and video played in his presidency. Presenting original recordings, framed by montage, the film tracks Reagan through the end of the Cold War—with all its confusion, fear, humor and, above all, irony. The immersive, self-reflective approach invites viewers to look closely at—and question—the use of narrative in contemporary politics.\n\nThe following event will take place at AM-London, in London, UK!\n\nFriday, June 9\n\nThe Idea of North\n\nThe North has long eluded the Western imagination. Arctic landscapes are classically depicted as “blank” expanses of snow, ice, igloos and polar bears. As a result, the North is still today subject to European definitions, with typical narratives of conquest and romance, by men from the outside, attempting to surmount its crushing elements. To what extent has this elision, this opposition to complex representation, been a form of resistance? It may have helped, for example, when the Greenland Inuit expelled the colonizing Danish Vikings in the 14th Century. Or alternatively has this representational “white-out” also prevented the world from properly envisioning, and thus intervening in, the Arctic’s ongoing erasure?\n\nThis program explores the idea of the North: from home-movie footage of a trip to the North Pole in the late 1930s, to the evocation of a bad dream by Inuit filmmaker Mary Kunuk, to musician Glenn Gould’s reflective film essay ‘The Idea of North’ (1967) and more. The evening explores the desire to conjure life in landscapes that may at first seem blank or barren, and to recognise forms of aliveness that may at first resist imagination and perception.

With its earthquakes and mud slides, and its ability to rapidly remake itself, Los Angeles is a forgetful city; perhaps its only constant is its transformative potential.The evening will examine the city's habit of erasure, as well as forms of collective recall, through disaster footage, visualizations of local wind patterns, documentation of lost neighborhoods and landmarks, contemporary marketing schemes for \"historic downtown,\" a 16mm presentation of Thom Andersen's Get Out of the Car , with an introduction from Thom, and a dance and live sound performance that explores community erasure and its impact on the body.

Focusing on both enthusiastic, visionary visitors and faithful locals with encyclopedic knowledge of architecture and lore, the event will consider different approaches to navigating and sharing the complex geography and culture of Los Angeles. Featuring LA-centric selections from Huell Howser's down-home show California's Gold, the fun-loving postmodernity of Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles, Agnes Varda's search for urban authorship among the city's murals in Mur Murs, a live bus tour from LA's most erudite tourist outfit, Esotouric, plus much more--and of course, puppets!\n\nThe following event will take place at REDCAT\n\nMonday, May 1\n\nCruel Radiance: Moving Image Work by Paweł Wojtasik\n\nPaweł Wojtasik in person!\n\nPeering inside pig farms, sewage treatment plants, wrecking yards and autopsy rooms, Paweł Wojtasik’s short films and large-scale gallery installations are poetic explorations into the overlooked, seamy corners of our environment. Beautifully shot and meticulously edited, at once inviting and disturbing, Wojtasik’s unflinching documentary-style imagery reveals the largely hidden processes by which we dispose of material waste, human and otherwise. This screening is Wojtasik’s first major presentation in L.A. He has previously shown his work at the Whitney Biennial; BAMPFA; the Museum of the Moving Image; the New York, Ann Arbor, Berlin and Locarno film festivals; and art biennials from Cartagena to Shenzhen.

Largely made up of HIV-positive participants who refused to die without a fight, they took on the challenges public officials had ignored, raising awareness of the disease through a series of dramatic protests. More remarkably, they became recognized experts in virology, biology, and pharmaceutical chemistry. Their efforts would see them seize the reins of federal policy from the FDA and NIH, force the AIDS conversation into the 1992 presidential election, and lead the way to the discovery of effective AIDS drugs that saved countless lives.\n\nFirst-time director and award-winning journalist David France, who has been covering the AIDS crisis for 30 years, culls from a huge amount of archival footage — most of it shot by the protestors themselves. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary, How to Survive a Plague captures both the joy and terror of those days, and the epic day-by-day battles that finally made AIDS survival possible.\n\nThe film will be followed by a Q&A with longtime ACT UP member Maria Maggenti, who began attending meetings two weeks after the group’s inception when she was a student at NYU. Maggenti is also a filmmaker, whose films as writer/director are The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love, Puccini for Beginners and most recently, as screenwriter, Ry Russo Young’s Before I Fall.\n\nThis presentation of the film is part of bi-coastal effort to help fund Housing Works’ National Advocacy Trainings, which teach citizens to raise their voices at town hall meetings and with elected officials, to fight back against right-wing attacks on our health care. Please consider supporting their excellent work here.\n\nThe following event will take place at The Bob Baker Marionette Theater\n\nFriday, April 28 (8pm at BBMT)\n\nSubject: Los Angeles in the Streets\n\nThe second installment of a four part series; Subject: Los Angeles in the Streets is an evening of films and performances that will examine varying forms of public assembly and artistic intervention in a city so often associated with private lives and drive-thru culture. With an eye towards the history of political demonstrations, group euphoria, and roadside art, this event will look at Los Angeles as both a backdrop and breeding ground for impassioned and irreverent activism, as well as creative spectacles that go far beyond the tourist trade. The night re-envisions the city as a site of collective possibility.\n\nFeaturing shorts from LA Rebellion filmmakers, footage of Brown Beret organizing events, archival documentation of the first-ever march for gay rights down Hollywood Blvd, a long-gone mask pageant down Wilshire, Les Blank's coverage of the 1967 Love-In, and more. Plus protest songs sung by folksinger Emily Lacy, and of course, puppets!\n\nThe following event will take place at The Velaslavasay Panorama:\n\nThursday, April 20\n\nA Night with Paula Prentiss and Allison De Fren\n\nActress Paula Prentiss (The Stepford Wives, The Parallax View) and Professor / Filmmaker Allison De Fren will discuss the legacy and many readings of The Stepford Wives.\n\nIn the come-down years after the 1960s, many films explored a rising sense of dread that perhaps our lives, desires, and even our newfound freedoms, were not our own. The Stepford Wives (1975) based on the pulpy novel by Ira Levin, takes the dread genre to an upscale Connecticut suburb, where the women are uniformly compliant, sexy (in floral sundresses) and enjoy ironing. Katharine Ross plays the new wife moving to Stepford, and the tall, goosey, ever-witty Paula Prentiss plays Bobbie, her Virgil in the underworld of the robo-suburbs. Prentiss, fresh off her harrowing and memorable brief bit in The Parallax View, was never more vivid or witty than she is here, at play among the fembots. A 1970s white-privilege-feminism variant of a contemporary film like Get Out, The Stepford Wives remains a classic of the “men who build artificial women” genre, insouciantly funny-creepy (and, some might say, eerie-sexy) to this day. Pauline Kael felt that the film let women off the hook for participating in their own devaluing: “If women turn into replicas of the women in the commercials, they do it to themselves,” rejoining that “as a guilt-provoker for men, this picture may be peerless.”\n\n\"Replacement Parts\" is a series of screenings and conversations about face replacements, fembots, and those who build artificial companions. Featuring both narrative and documentary film as well shorts, animation, and \"theatrical interjections,\" the series is a collaboration between Veggie Cloud and the Velaslavasay Panorama and will take place at both locations this spring and summer.\n\nThe following event will take place at the Bob Baker Marionette Theater:\n\nFriday, April 14\n\nSUBJECT: LOS ANGELES AS EDEN\n\nProgrammed by Veggie Cloud with KJ Relth!\n\nSubject: Los Angeles as Eden is an evening that considers the persistent image of Southern California as an earthly paradise through archival film, commentary, slides, and marionette performances. From advertisements that marketed young Pasadena as the city where roses grew year round, to actual Utopian experiments, Los Angeles has been imagined as a temperate and florid promised land—despite its arch-opposite reputation as hell on earth. Highlights include early color nitrate footage of Hollywood’s storybook restaurants, an advertorial film urging Easterners to move to Santa Monica, home movies from Muscle Beach, and an exploration of Grandma Prisbrey’s beatific Bottle Village, punctuated by magical marionette performances.\n\nThursday, Mar 16\n\nSECONDS (1966, Dir: John Frankenheimer, 107min)\n\nPresented and introduced by KJ Relth!\n\n“I think he’d rather be nobody,” Doris Day once asserted of her frequent co-star Rock Hudson. During his 59 years of life, which included a much-publicized three-year marriage to secretary Phyllis Gates and more than 60 film roles, matinee heartthrob Hudson never publicly self-identified as gay—although endless posthumous assertions by friends and colleagues flew around after his death in 1985 from AIDS-related causes. Despite Hudson’s recurring presence in every conceivable fan mag and gossip rag in the 1950s and ’60s, a case could be made for his desire to lead a more private life—or at least a lifestyle divergent from the heteronormativity of the Nifty Fifties. After a string of frothy romantic comedies with Doris Day, Hudson, ready for a risk, embarked on the most demanding role of his career with John Frankenheimer’s 1966 ultramodern sci-fi film, Seconds. A dystopian morality play about a man seduced into a new life thanks to the “miracles” of plastic surgery, Seconds is not just a warning of the deceptive allure of rebirth, but also a chance at wish fulfillment for an actor desperate for a career—and a personal—face lift.\n\nBefore the screening, KJ Relth of the UCLA Film and Television Archive will delve into the previously unexplored parallels between Rock Hudson’s closeted public persona and his somewhat misbegotten role in Frankenheimer’s existential classic.\n\nThe following event will take place at Desert Poetry Gathering, Joshua Tree:\n\nSaturday, April 8\n\nMILESTONES (1975, Robert Kramer, 195 min)\n\n\"Milestones is a lilting, free-associative masterpiece that follows dozens of characters — including hippies, farmers, immigrants, Native Americans, and political activists — as they try to reconcile their ideals with the realities of American life. In intimate discussions of subjects from communal living to parenting, pregnancy to family, Vietnam to Cuba, city life to country life, and the workplace to the bedroom, the film's diverse protagonists negotiate jealousies, relationships, and the logistical challenges of their rapidly changing world.\"\n\nSunday, Feb 19\n\nBORN IN FLAMES (1983, Dir: Lizzie Borden, 90 min)\n\nPresented by Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal & T.I.N.A.\n\nLeftists are telling women, POC, and queers that their struggles are selfish, getting in the way of the true work of class revolution. Meanwhile, the fascist right is on the rise: in prisons and in politics. Welcome to Lizzie Borden's too-real, cinema-verite sci-fi, Born in Flames, set 10 years after the socialist revolution. A cadre of black lesbians (including the improvised contributions of non-actors Jeanne Satterfield and Borden's then girlfriend, Honey) are amassing a Women's Army, and inspired by legendary Black feminist Flo Kennedy, who plays (almost) herself, they're about to shift into armed struggle. In less than an hour and a half, with a soundtrack heavy on Red Crayola, Born in Flames manages to touch on the criminalization of dissent, police violence against black women, the co-optation of revolutionary rhetoric, and the role of the media and violence in activism. Trigger warning: brief depiction of sexual violence, police violence, and they're going to blow up the World Trade Center.\n\nThe following will take place at Art Los Angeles Contemporary!\n\nSunday, January 29, 3pm\n\nA Conversation with Roger Corman and Mary Woronov\n\nRoger Corman, Mary Woronov, and Ian Birnie in Person!\n\nRoger Corman is an icon of American independent cinema. Renowned for his speed, prolificacy, economy, and wild creativity, Corman infamously shot his 1960 film Little Shop of Horrors in just two days. At various points in his career, he directed up to nine movies a year. The fact that his work was made cheaply and was highly profitable allowed him to challenge the Hollywood mainstream with a range of inventive genre films encompassing horror, action, science fiction, biker and outlaw storylines, as well as forays into the drug culture, as with 1967’s The Trip. His renegade approach seemed the perfect way to capture the splintering of an American cultural gestalt, represented by the centrality of film studios and the star system, into the kaleidoscopic landscape of the 1960s and 70s. In this intimate conversation, Corman will discuss his work and long career with the actress, writer, and artist Mary Woronov, who’s appeared in many of his movies, and film programmer Ian Birnie.\n\nFollowed by a screening of the Corman-produced film DEATH RACE 2000 (1975, Dir: Paul Bartel, 80 min), starring Mary Woronov.\n\n***Please note is event will take place at Art Los Angeles Contemporary:\n\nThe Barker Hangar\n\n3021 Airport Avenue\n\nSanta Monica, CA 90405\n\nSaturday, January 28, two screenings, different venues:\n\n1:30 pm at Art Los Angeles Contemporary\n\n8:00 pm at Bob Baker Marionette Theater\n\nLOST LANDSCAPES OF L.A. (2016, Dir: Rick Prelinger, 80 min)\n\nRick Prelinger in person!\n\nRick Prelinger, founder of the Prelinger Archives, screens Lost Landscapes of L.A., a cultural history of greater Los Angeles made with footage from his vast archives. The archivist, writer, filmmaker, and UC Santa Cruz professor combines excerpts from largely unseen “ephemeral” sources—home movies, and studio-produced background “process plates”—into a richly detailed socio-topographical study of cityscape and myth that casts the contemporary terrain in a new light. Founded in 1983, Prelinger Archives is among the largest repositories of its kind in the world.\n\n***Please note these event will take place offsite:\n\n1:30pm at Art Los Angeles Contemporary:\n\nThe Barker Hangar\n\n3021 Airport Avenue\n\nSanta Monica, CA 90405\n\n8:00pm (doors at 8, show at 8:30) at Bob Baker Marionette Theater\n\n1345 W. First St.\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90026\n\nThursday, January 19\n\nFIRST ASSIGNMENT (2015, Dir: Danielle Adair, 61 min)\n\nWith artist Danielle Adair in person!\n\nUsing an experimental literature press as her credential, performer Danielle Adair embeds as “media” with US soldiers in eastern Afghanistan, following one female Intelligence officer in particular. The video unfolds through a series of vignettes, which take up the personas of different US war reporters, in an effort to discover how counterinsurgency is ‘performed’ abroad. Composed almost entirely of still imagery and audio recordings from Adair's time at bases in the US (Fort Irwin and Fort Hood) and away (Bagram, Eggers, Fenty, and Finley in Afghanistan), First Assignment refigures the media’s portrayal of war and the aesthetics of visual representation.\n\nBefore the screening, Adair will also give a brief of her findings at this summer’s DNC and RNC, which she covered as well, this time as a representative of a gossip blog. With their triads of police-press-and-protesters that rivaled any spectacle in the celebrity world, the conventions provide impetus for the Inauguration.\n\n2016\n\nThursday, October 27\n\nTHE RISE AND RISE OF MICHAEL RIMMER (1970, Dir: Kevin Billington, 94 min)\n\nPresented and introduced (via Skype) by film critic Violet Lucca!\n\nStraight out of the “Scenarios that used to be Outrageous Parody but are Now Real” file comes Kevin Billington’s The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer. Scripted by Billington, Peter Cook, John Cleese, and Graham Chapman, this darkly comic 1970 gem charts the sociopathic ascendancy of the titular ad man (Cook at peak cuteness) from assistant to the office of Primer Minister. Boasting cameos by Cleese, Chapman, Denholm Elliot, Ronnie Corbett, and Harold Pinter (as a TV anchor who monitors the “swingometer”), the film lampoons the commodification of 60s progressive movements, racism, polling, insufferable upper class British people who like horseback riding, and AM radio.\n\nSunday, October 23\n\nDON’T TOUCH THE WHITE WOMAN (1974, Dir: Marco Ferreri, 108 min)\n\nPresented and introduced by writer and director Matthew Wilder!\n\nComing off his surprise gross-out hit La Grande Bouffe—a sort of barf-bag riff on The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie—Marco Ferreri found that the world was his oyster. He planned to make a version of The Three Musketeers with the cream of the crop of European acting talent—too bad Richard Lester cut him off at the pass. Instead, Ferreri mounted Don’t Touch The White Woman, a MAD Magazine-style biopic of General George Armstrong Custer (a perfectly if atypically cast Marcello Mastroianni) that makes Robert Altman's Buffalo Bill and the Indians look like hidebound realism. With Catherine Deneuve as a dainty damsel in distress, and the casts of several Chabrol and Bunuel movies twirling their moustaches as cowboys and Indians, the film is Old Europe thumbing its nose at Nixon America—and maybe, via ESP, at First Term Trump?\n\nNIGHT AND FOG (1955, Dir: Alain Resnais, 32 min); LBJ (1968, Dir: Santiago Alvarez, 18 min); L’AMBASSADE (1973, Dir: Chris Marker, 21 min)\n\nThree political essay films explore dangerous leaders, the archaeology of a coup, and the horror of the commandeered state. Cuban director Santiago Alvarez (Memories of Underdevelopment) implicates Lyndon Johnson in multiple assassinations, and portrays him as a media-fashioned, deranged cowboy, in the 18-minute LBJ. Chris Marker responds to Pinochet's 1973 military coup with the unclassifiable L'ambassade, which purports to document a group of diplomats taking sanctuary in an embassy and waiting to flee the country. Alain Resnais’s masterpiece, Night and Fog, uses footage from the grounds of Auschwitz combined with stock footage to ask, \"who is responsible?\"\n\nNOTE: The following event is at Union Docs, NYC\n\nFriday, October 7\n\n\"Cunt Art was the First Art\"\n\nCunt Art was the First Art is an evening about the role “cunt” played in early feminist art and consciousness raising, touching on the role of female genitalia in popular culture today. Between 1968 and 1974, women artists attempted to reclaim a positive female identity by creating what they termed “cunt art.” The legacy of cunt art was absorbed by feminist sex education and sex-positive third wave feminism. The event will include a historical account of feminist cunt iconography by Sasha Archibald; a short film about labia typology, Labial Quintet, by Courtney Stephens; and a rare screening of Near the Big Chakra, a 1971 experimental film by Alice Anne Parker (née Anne Severson). This event was organized by Veggie Cloud, an arts space in Los Angeles, where it was originally presented in May 2015.\n\nNear the Big Chakra (Dir: Alice Anne Parker (née Anne Severson, 1971, 14min)\n\nDescribed by Agnès Varda as “a new approach to our femininity,” Near the Big Chakra is a 14-minute silent film comprising extreme close-ups of 37 women’s vulvas. Made in 1971 and screened internationally in the early 1970s, audiences’ reactions to the film—disgust, mockery, fist fights with the projectionist—made clear the degree to which Severson radically upends conventional imaging of female genitalia.\n\nLabial Quintet (Dir: Courtney Stephens, 2015, 11min)\n\nCreated specifically for the 2015 Cunt Art event at Veggie Cloud in Los Angeles, Labial Quintet was prompted by a claim made by a waxing aesthetician that there are five distinct varieties of labia shape. Browsing pornography, a live waxing session, surgical footage, and other visual “evidence,” the film explores the veracity of this claim, and what it means to typologize a body part.\n\nSeptember: 15-25: A Public Affair: Elizabeth Taylor in the 1960s\n\nSunday, September 25\n\nCLEOPATRA (1963, Dir: Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 192 min)\n\nPreceded by a sound piece by Wayne Koestenbaum made especially for the occasion\n\n\"Everything went wrong with Cleopatra. That is its charm. England's hairdressers struck, because Elizabeth Taylor insisted on importing Sydney Guilaroff to do her hair. The production company started to shoot Cleopatra before the film was cast, or the script was written, and had to scrap expensive footage. Elizabeth Taylor almost died, and the production shut down entirely, and started again, but in another country. Executives were fired. 20th Century Fox sued its stars. Elizabeth Taylor sued Fox. The film is the costliest, and the longest, ever made.\" —Wayne Koestenbaum\n\nThursday, September 22\n\nTHE SANDPIPER (1965, Dir: Vincente Minnelli, 117 min)\n\nPreceded by an Elizabeth Taylor slide show\n\nTaylor is an artist in Big Sur who takes care of wounded birds. A single mother and a free spirit, she is forced to send her son to a Christian school after he acts out. The conventional clergyman and headmaster (Richard Burton) tries to control her, but falls in love with her. Will he get her to conform? Will their love survive their differences?\n\nSunday, September 18\n\nBOOM! (1968, Dir: Joseph Losey, 110 min)\n\nIntroduced by Mayer Rus\n\nElizabeth Taylor is Flora 'Sissy' Goforth, an older, wealthy woman dying in a mansion on a secluded Mediterranean island. Into her life comes a mysterious man (Richard Burton). What follows is passion, fighting, drinking, and throwing things off the balcony into the ocean. Adapted from Tennessee Williams's play, The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore, the film also features Noël Coward as The Witch of Capri. John Waters describes Boom! as “beyond bad. It’s the other side of camp. It’s beautiful, atrocious, and it’s perfect.\"\n\nThursday, September 15\n\nWHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966, Dir: Mike Nichols, 131 min)\n\nIntroduced by Nikki Darling\n\n\"George, my husband... George, who is out somewhere there in the dark, who is good to me—whom I revile, who can keep learning the games we play as quickly as I can change them. Who can make me happy, and I do not wish to be happy. Yes, I do wish to be happy. George and Martha: Sad, sad, sad. Whom I will not forgive for having come to rest; for having seen me and having said: yes, this will do.\"\n\n—Elizabeth Taylor as Martha\n\nSunday, August 21\n\nFilm Archivist John Kostka on Small-Gauge \"Sinema\"\n\n+ a screening of RAOUL'S MASTERPIECE (1975, Dir: Zachary Strong)\n\nSince the earliest days of erotic cinema, small-gauge (8mm and 16mm) film has provided an important alternative means of production, offering cheaper and more clandestine alternatives for the creation and distribution of illicit work. While the early 1970s saw an unprecedented proliferation of hardcore filmmaking in the professional theatrical gauge of 35mm, small gauges continued to provide important ancillary markets. This screening pays tribute to these economical alternatives by showcasing trailers for a number of 16mm “storefront” productions (lower-budgeted sex films produced for 16mm micro cinemas), as well as the hour-long gay feature Raoul’s Masterpiece. All films and trailers will be projected from vintage 16mm prints. Discussion to follow.\n\nSunday, August 14\n\nPORN STAR PETS (2005, Dir: Margie Schnibbe, 52 min)\n\nA screening for people and pets! Bring your pet if they're friendly.\n\nThis documentary reveals the emotional lives of top porn stars by exploring their relationships with their pets. From Ron Jeremy's turtle, Cherry, to Taylor Wayne's terrier, Buddy, to Teri Weigel's menagerie of snakes, birds, and dogs, the human-animal connections shed light on the tender side of adult film personalities. Author Trinie Dalton writes: \"The film's oblique approach to getting to know its subjects is highly personal, and stylistically resembles Errol Morris's amazing early works, Gates of Heaven, and Vernon, Florida...These celebrities remind us of the healing power of animals, and their ability to cheer us up.\"\n\nPreceded by:\n\nDOG EAT DOG (2004, Dir: Charles Lum, 13 min)\n\nDog Eat Dog is the third installment of a trilogy depicting the antics of the IML Boys, a group of New York artists attending the 2003 International Mister Leather Contest in Chicago. Lively dog dedicated pop songs and three cameras recreate the immersive ambiance of this intense and overwhelming fetish convention experience. The inherent nature of performance in sexual identity is observed through the IML Boys' live participation in the first ‘sanctioned’ Puppy Party event at IML.\n\nFriday, July 29\n\n**at The Getty\n\n\"COLLECTION\"\n\nMuseum Lecture Hall\n\nThe Getty Center, Los Angeles\n\n6-9 FREE\n\nPOSSUM TROT: THE LIFE AND WORK OF CALVIN BLACK\n\nDirected by Allie Light and Irving Saraf\n\n1977, 16mm (digital presentation), 28 min\n\nPossum Trot tells the story of Calvin Black, a folk artist who lived in the Mojave Desert and created more than 80 life-size female dolls, each with its own personality, function, and costume. Black also built the \"Bird Cage Theater,\" where the dolls were orchestrated to perform and sing in voices recorded by the artist. The film documents the artist's legacy, while also using the medium of cinema to enable the dolls to move, sing, and come to life in the protected space of the theater, just as Black imagined.\n\nLIFE AT A SNAIL'S PACE\n\nDirected by Alexandra Gaulupeau\n\n2016, digital video, 23 min\n\nMarla Coppolino is the Snail Wrangler. This brief portrait follows her mission to bring awareness to the importance and beauty of land snails through education, niche commerce, and creative display. A trained malacologist and biological illustrator, Coppolino also works wrangling snails for photography and film shoots and makes her own snail art with a collection of antique and handmade miniatures: snails ride magic carpets in the sky, ooze out of teacups, and slide across tiny bottles of champagne.\n\nBOWERS CAVE\n\nDirected by Lee Anne Schmitt and Lee Lynch\n\n2010, 16mm (digital projection), 20 min\n\nIn 1884 two boys in Southern California discovered a cave of Chumash Indian artifacts in the San Martin Mountains on land that is now part of the Chiquita Canyon landfill, located in the small town of Castaic. Known as Bowers Cave, the cave was named after the amateur archeologist Stephen Bower, a notorious looter of Indian sites, who bought the artifacts from the boys, and then resold them for a profit, mostly to private collectors. This film loosely traces the history of the cave’s collection, meditating on the eradication of the Chumash culture, as well as a larger conflict between the metaphysical and the material.\n\nWILD WHEELS\n\nDirected by Harrod Blank\n\n1992, 16mm (digital presentation) 64 min\n\nDocumentarian Harrod Blank examines the obsession that drives him and others to modify automobiles and motorcycles into fanciful vehicular sculptures and canvases for eccentric collections. One car is morphed into an alligator; a motorcycle becomes a hamburger; and other vehicles are covered entirely with faucets, pennies, and buttons. The artists who have painstakingly created them are builders on the one hand, but they are also performers who cause us to consider the soul's carriage through the physical plane: each vehicle travels with specially anointed grace; each is a shrine.\n\nFriday, July 15 **at The Getty\n\n\"QUARRY\"\n\nMuseum Lecture Hall\n\nThe Getty Center, Los Angeles\n\n6-9 FREE\n\nQUARRY\n\nDirected by Richard P. Rogers\n\n1970, 16mm (digital presentation), 12 min\n\nThe first movie of acclaimed filmmaker Richard P. Rogers, Quarry captures the carousing and bathing rites of a group of teenagers at a swimming hole in Quincy, Massachusetts. Shot in 1967, and set to the strains of radio rock and casual conversation, the film contrasts a majestic portrait of a summer idyll with invocations of the looming threat of Vietnam.\n\nRUNDOWN\n\nDirected by Jane Crawford\n\n1994, video (digital presentation), 12min\n\nThis short video documents three pour projects from 1969 by Robert Smithson, including Asphalt Rundown, the artist’s first monumental land work, which was made in a quarry outside of Rome. In an interview included as voice-over, Smithson touches on the entropic nature of his work, as well wastelands, closed systems, Watergate, and geological time.\n\nCLAW\n\nDirected by Manfred Kirchheimer\n\n1968, 16mm (digital presentation), 30 min\n\nManhattan is the quarry in this elusive film poem. Stone gargoyles and goddesses—the adornments on old masoned buildings—watch as a huge mechanical claw dismantles other old structures to make way for the steel and glass skyscrapers of tomorrow’s city. The constant refrain of rock faces reminds us that stone is a material forged in nature rather than by industry, and suggests our shared vulnerability.\n\nRARE EARTH\n\nDirected by Elizabeth Knafo\n\n2014, digital video, 54 min\n\nRare Earth explores the re-opening of a historically toxic mine in the California desert, and the intensifying land rush for high-tech minerals across the world. The essay film is a portrait of the changing desert landscape, the legacy of treasure hunting in the American West, and the residents who grapple with the deepening impacts of industrial mining— all the more critical in our era of global climate change.\n\nThursday, July 7\n\nSCORE (1974, Dir: Radley Metzger, 90 min)\n\nPresented by Jennifer Stefanisko!\n\nSomewhere in Yugoslavia… in the early 70s… in a fabulous villa on the Riviera… a happily married, swinging couple make a bet to seduce a pair of naive newlyweds. Free love, costumes, games of seduction, clever dialogue and group sex ensue. Score is a softcore art house sex romp by erotic auteur cult director Radley Metzger (Camille 2000, The Lickerish Quartet, Therese and Isabelle). The film was originally based on an off-Broadway play and adapted as a stylish adult fairy tale with a great theme song and a Russ Meyer vibe, albeit more elegant and Euro. Score was celebrated as one of the first to depict male bisexuality, with a high production value and a release in both hard and soft-core versions.\n\nWe will be watching the hard core, which is just an additional eight minutes of graphic sex.\n\nThursday, June 30\n\nSEXUAL EMOTIONS OF A DONKEY [Emoções Sexuais de Um Jegue] (1986, Dir: Sady Baby and Renalto Alves, 73 min)\n\nAmong the most extreme and notorious, but rarely viewed, pornographic films ever made, Sexual Emotions of a Donkey was directed by Renalto Alves and Sady Baby, a well-known figure in the boca-de-lixo (trash mouth) genre of Brazilian cinema. The film is boundary-pushing even within the parameters of hardcore pornography. Filmed in Brazil in 1986, it is notable for its depiction of straight, gay, and trans sex, its outrageously arch use of Hollywood soundtrack music, and its inclusion of an HIV-positive prison-escapee protagonist (and a subsequent intercourse scene inside a coffin). Warning: this film is balls-out crazy, and also contains violence, disturbing HIV-phobic characterization, and hardcore sex. To paraphrase from another of Sady Baby's (no, not In the Heat of the Hole, but Orgy Bus) movies: “Working is for morons. If this country is fucked, then let’s fuck.\"\n\nBonus: the film will be live-translated by two Portuguese-speakers.\n\nThursday, June 23\n\nECSTASY OF THE ANGELS [Tenshi no kōkotsu] (1972, Dir: Kōji Wakamatsu, 89 min)\n\nPresented by Samantha Culp!\n\nIn the 1960s and 70s, Japan saw the rise of pinku eiga (\"pink films\"), erotically-charged movies made quickly, cheaply, and by young directors who were given an opportunity by the studios to experiment with the limits of film language and political messaging—as long as there was some kind of sex scene every 10 minutes. Arguably the most important filmmaker to emerge from this genre, and reshape it in the process, was the prolific and controversial Koji Wakamatsu (1936–2012). Eerily mirroring the crises of radical activism in early 1970s Japan, Wakamatsu's landmark Ecstasy of the Angels is a claustrophobic story of a young terrorist cell attempting revolution but unraveling into sexual ennui and violence.\n\nFriday, June 10\n\n**at the Getty Center\n\n\"TRAM\"\n\nMuseum Lecture Hall\n\nThe Getty Center, Los Angeles\n\n6-9 PM, FREE\n\n\"As a part of Friday Night Flights, \"a series of interdisciplinary happenings that bring together a range of Los Angeles-based artists to transform the Getty experience.\" Veggie Cloud will be presenting three separate evenings of programs based around elements of the Getty's infrastructure\"\n\nFUJI\n\nDirected by Robert Breer\n\n1974, 16mm (digital presentation), 9 min.\n\nA lush and atmospheric account of a train journey taken through Japan, Breer’s short film combines live action, rotoscoping, and his own line drawings.

More than an allegory of East meeting West, the documentary captures the simple scene in all its complexity, paying equal attention to both the workers and the curious European passengers watching them from onboard.\n\nMANAKAMANA\n\nDirected by Stephanie Spray and Pacho Velez\n\n2013, 35mm and DCP (digital presentation), 118 min.\n\nHigh above a jungle in Nepal, pilgrims make an ancient journey by cable car to a mountaintop temple. Filmed in long, airborne shots through the Himalayas, Manakamana, a 2013 prize-winner at the Locarno Film Festival, is equal parts ethnography, staged documentary, and science fiction.\n\nSpecial thanks to Pacho Velez and Brigid McCaffrey.\n\nThursday, May 26\n\nIN THE REALM OF THE SENSES (1976, Dir: Nagisa Oshima, 102 min)\n\nStill censored in Japan to this day, Oshima’s hardcore, erotic tour de force is based on a true story of amour fou between a Tokyo innkeeper and his employee, Sada Abe. Set in 1936, against a political backdrop of increasing imperialism and military control, the film follows the consuming sexual obsession of the two lovers to its violent, operatic climax.\n\nThursday, May 19\n\nJennifer Peterson on \"Bodies in Nature: Rediscovering Mid-Century Nudist Films\"\n\nCo-presented with lafilmforum!\n\nThis presentation will explore how nature was spatialized in nudist films of the 1950s and 60s such as Garden of Eden (Max Nosseck, 1954), Naked Venus (Edgar G. Ulmer, 1958), and Diary of a Nudist (Doris Wishman, 1961). These films were legally protected by a claim of “educational value,” and their slight narratives disavow sexual activity in favor of presentations of the naked human body as an embodiment of a “natural” and “healthy” lifestyle. Embodying a relentless male gaze, the films contain long sequences in which topless women stroll around, swim, and play volleyball. Through “tour of the camp” sequences, the films chart an itinerary in which the nudist camp becomes a utopian space located in the wilderness. By focusing on the spatialization of the natural settings surrounding these naked bodies, Peterson argues that the films actually produce heterotopic spaces in which female bodies and the feminine are “at home” in the refuge of nature. While nudist films certainly essentialize femininity, they can also be connected to countercultural ideologies of naturism, environmentalism, and the back-to-the-land movement that were becoming popularized in this era. Overturning the usual cinematic relationship between characters and setting, in nudist films landscape and figure participate in a more equal exchange.\n\nJennifer Peterson is the author of Education in the School of Dreams: Travelogues and Early Nonfiction Film (Duke University Press, 2013).

Staying with a friend of Chantal Akerman, she utters a long, intimate monologue. She is filmed in static shots which monitor her unspoken anguish and idleness, moving from one room to the next. The young woman, through the repetition of empty and haunting daily gestures, becomes a pure “existential” figure.\n\nAdapted and translated from the description in the Pompidou catalogue of 2004\n\nThursday, March 31\n\nFROM THE OTHER SIDE (2012, Dir: Chantal Akerman, 99 min)\n\nPresented as part of Chantal Akerman: Contre l’Oubli/Against Oblivion\n\n“A spare, painterly and scrupulously unsentimental look. Both eerily beautiful and filled with a quiet compassion.\" –Dave Kehr, The New York Times\n\nAgua Prieta and Douglas are two small towns planted on either side of the border between Mexico and the United States. Akerman alternately films these neighboring towns, so near and yet so far, separated by an insurmountable physical obstacle of barbed wire, gates and iron. Despite the danger, hundreds of Mexicans try to cross illegally every year. Exploring the border as a symbol of North-South divide and the ravages of globalization, Akerman nonetheless captures the desert, the horizon and the wide-open space – allowing audiences to make up their minds. After From the East and South, she concludes her documentary trilogy with a poignant, lyrical and provocative film.\n\nSunday, March 27\n\nCHICKEN RANCH (1983, Dir: Nick Broomfield, 85 min)\n\nPresented by Cinefamily as part of Underground USA: Indie Cinema of the 80s\n\nNick Broomfield's documentary on the legendary legal brothel Chicken Ranch offers a kind of social archaeology that is a time capsule of many things, including perspectives on sex work before \"sex work\" became an academic term of currency. The film digs into the backstories of the women, their social repartee, the conflicts between tiers within the brothel, and the handling of customer complaints. It serves as a document of the professionalization of sex in America at a time when mainstream feminism had not yet taken much of an interest.\n\nThursday, March 24th\n\nBELOW SEA LEVEL (2008, Dir: Gianfranco Rosi, 110 min)\n\nPresented by filmmaker Helki Frantzen\n\nWith unflinching intimacy, director Gianfranco Rosi documents the lives and makeshift living spaces of a group of squatters in Slab City, California—an abandoned military base in the Sonoran Desert, 200 miles southeast of Los Angeles and 20 feet below sea level. Winner of Best Documentary at the 2008 Venice Film Festival, the film offers a glimpse into a community who endures extreme conditions, living without water, electricity, or sewage, in what’s often called “The Last Free Place in America.”\n\nThursday, March 17\n\nSTRANGER WITH A CAMERA (2000, Dir: Elizabeth Barret, 62 min)\n\nPresented by artist Mackenzie Hoffman\n\nElizabeth Barret’s documentary revisits the 1967 murder of filmmaker Hugh O’Conner by a Kentucky landowner named Hobart Ison in the coal-mining heart of Appalachia’s “poverty belt.” By contrasting perspectives from locals and members of O'Connor's film crew, Barret weaves together the tale of a complexly motivated crime with an insightful exploration into the politics of representation. The film was a Grand Jury Prize Nominee in Documentary at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival and was produced by the historic Appalachian media center Appalshop, of which Barret was a student. “Stranger with a Camera is not a story,” Larry Daressa writes in Cineaste, “but an essay on the responsibilities of storytelling; not a straightforward chronicle or propagandistic rant but an expertly edited counterpoint of different perspectives around an elusive core. In the end, it is this tension between the always ambiguous image and Barret's attempts to describe it fairly which gives the film its integrity.”\n\nPreceded by:\n\nZORA NEALE HURSTON'S FIELDWORK FOOTAGE (1928, Dir: Zora Neale Hurston, 7 min).\n\nBefore writing much of the work for which she is most celebrated, novelist, poet and scholar Zora Neale Hurston traveled to the American South making 16mm recordings of African-American culture in Alabama and Florida. At the time she was then the sole African American among the Columbia University graduate students of Franz Boas, the nation's leading anthropologist. Hurston described her travels as \"formalized curiosity\" and \"poking and prying with a purpose\" leading Boas to worry that \"she is so much more artistic rather than scientific.\" Of the 15 reels Hurston shot during these travels, only 9 remain and have been preserved by the Library of Congress. Five sequences have been edited and released as ZORA NEALE HURSTON'S FIELDWORK FOOTAGE. These sequences include shots of school children playing, a river baptism, a logging camp and footage of octogenarian Cudjo Lewis, the final survivor from The Clotilde, the last arriving slave ship to America (in 1859). No titles accompany the film; score added and commissioned separately.\n\nThursday, February 18\n\nJACQUES RIVETTE, LE VEILLEUR [THE WATCHMAN] (Dir: Claire Denis, 1990, 125 min.)\n\nClaire Denis's portrait of fellow French director Jacques Rivette, who passed away last month at 87, follows the filmmaker through city streets, exhibitions, cafes, and conversation. The made-for-French-TV documentary couples explorations of Rivette's idiosyncratic Parisian geography with discussions of his process and filmography, led by Cahiers de Cinema critic Serge Daney. Travis Mackenzie Hoover writes in Slant that the film is a catalogue of \"Rivette's qualities, chief among which are his lonerish tendencies…he's private and withdrawn, and the film represents this by swallowing him up in the city or otherwise emphasizing his smallness…In the first part, ‘Day,’ it's largely performed via the wandering through the streets of Paris…in ‘Night,’ he's sitting on the top of a building, gazing over its railing or sitting in low light. The effect is to consider this person as a sort of transient with no home or country, wandering about or loitering in public space instead of staking out some personal terra firma.\"\n\nSaturday, February 13, 3PM at The Cinefamily*\n\nLOVE SOUNDS (Dir: Masha Tupitsyn, 2015, 245 min.)\n\nL.A. Theatrical Premiere! Co-presented with Penny-Ante and Cinefamily!\n\nIn Love Sounds, Masha Tupitsyn pieces together les mots d’amour from the films that constitute our understanding of romance. This 24-hour \"sound poem\" (Cinefamily presents the director’s four-hour cut) cycles through the arc of narrative romance (desire, fights, love, break-ups), with carefully chosen selections of audio clips from the most amour-driven of films, much like an aural version Christian Marclay's The Clock. Tupitsyn states that in the film “the love sounds we’re hearing require us not to listen in or on something, but to actively listen for and to…it’s not about a formal manipulation of language or a fetishizing of the sound-in-itself, as is the often the case with the lascivious, where the coop and the thrill is to hear what you are not supposed to hear—the secret, the hidden. Rather, it’s a process of understanding. Of making sense.…The act of listening is more important than the sound itself, the value is in the relation between.”\n\n*Please note this screening will take place AT CINEFAMILY: 611 N Fairfax Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90036. Tickets are $10 and available here:\n\nSunday, February 7\n\nL.A.X. (Dir: Fabrice Ziolkowski, 1980, 88 min.)\n\nPresented with Los Angeles Filmforum. Fabrice Ziolkowski in person!\n\nL.A.X. deals with slippery concepts of history, memory, and how their traces mark the landscape of Los Angeles. The black and white film is made up of thirty-five shots and its soundtrack contains excerpts from various texts concerning the history of the city and of Southern California. Critic Scott Foundas writes: “Fabrice Ziolkowski's brilliant essay film prowls its way from a bird's-eye view of the Southland in its urban-suburban splendor to the seamier street-level perspective more common to the city dweller. In the process, Ziolkowski's voyeuristic black-and-white camera lingers inquisitively over the Venice canals, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and other iconographic landmarks, while a roundelay of different narrators, reading the work of Halberstam, Godard, Chandler, et al., fill us in on the city's hidden (and often unsavory) history. The film's expansive timeline stretches from the days of Franciscan monks and Indian villages to the irrigating of the San Fernando Valley, the decay of downtown and the ongoing, trenchlike divisions between races and economic classes…on one level, a snapshot of Los Angeles at the moment the film was made (1980) and, on another, a record of the city at all moments in all times — past, present and yet to come. A clear influence on subsequent works ranging from Pat O'Neill's Water and Power to Thom Andersen's recent Los Angeles Plays Itself, the film is a seminal achievement in its own right and a valuable contribution to that canon of works about the great, tangledmyth of our improbable desert metropolis.”\n\nWednesday, February 3\n\nAFTER THE SKY FALLS (Dir: Eric Pollard, 2015, 30 min.)\n\n+ Scenes from various Jeremy Jones projects\n\nPresented and with a talk by Benjamin Weissman and Catherine Taft!\n\nBenjamin Weissman states: This movie is made by three skiers—Chris Benchetler, Pep Fujas, and Eric Pollard—who live in Mammoth and Tahoe. They call themselves Nimbus. They’re super respected pro cool guys who’ve been in the ripping biz for a decade; they all have signature skis from the best companies and actually design several models of skis. The footage I’ve seen is super killer pow in Japan with acrobatic tree jibbing and other wild things in incredible terrain. They’re humble geniuses. Notice the understated language of their promotional note: “Two years in the making, After the Sky Falls is not an epic portrayal of skiing, but rather an attempt to relate to and inspire everyday skiers. The film is not a dramatic narrative piece, nor an energy drink commercial. It's not meant to make the skiers in the film into heroes. It is simply a film that documents the Nimbus crew's approach to the sport and their focus on fun and creativity.”\n\n​Sunday, January 31\n\nMR FREEDOM (1969, Dir: William Klein)\n\n“Conceivably the most anti-American film ever made,” according to Jonathan Rosenbaum, Mr. Freedom is a pop-political lampoon of US foreign policy made by an American-born expatriate during the morass of the Vietnam War. Mr. Freedom himself is a football-padded superhero who jets off to Europe to save Switzerland from the commies, encountering figures like Red China Man, a giant balloon dragon. Ed Halter writes: “Mr. Freedom was Klein’s attempt to make an anti-war film that could attract the popcorn crowd, using the visual language of broad comedy, old-time serials, and the monster movie… Klein’s filmmaking participates in a larger interest among his fellow Parisians in exploring the use of Pop images towards political re-education.” When asked in a recent interview if he feels French after 60 years in Paris, Klein replied no, \"but I’m at home with the French. Hanging out with Americans: for me, that sucks.\"\n\nThursday, January 21\n\nSALAAM CINEMA (1995, Dir: Mohsen Makhmalbaf)\n\nPresented by Ahsen Nadeem\n\n+ Food inspired by the film by Chef Stiff Peaks!\n\nA film made to celebrate the birth of cinema's centennial. Director Mohsen Makhmalbaf places an advert in a local newspaper announcing an open audition. During the casting process, a riot ensues followed by a series of cruel and comic vignettes in which the director interrogates children, young men, and housewives all desperately hoping to land a role in his movie. A blend of documentary and staged fiction, the film is a wonderful examination on the power of cinema on the public imagination.\n\nThursday, Januray 14\n\nMEDIUM COOL (1969, Dir: Haskell Wexler)\n\nIntroduction by Medium Cool actor Peter Bonerz!\n\nThe first feature of renowned cinematographer and self-described radical Haskell Wexler (who died last month at 93), Medium Cool follows the story of a detached TV news cameraman whose outlook changes when he discovers his station has been leaking his footage to the FBI. The film famously weaves in documentation of many real events, including extensive coverage of protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Wexler and his crew were themselves tear-gassed by police during filming. “Sometimes the rehearsed, controlled thing seems more ‘real’ than the real thing,” Wexler told Roger Ebert when the movie was being released. “I honestly don't know what ‘real’ is. The summer of 1968 in Chicago was the most unreal thing that ever happened.”\n\nThursday, November 19\n\nJOAN OF ARC OF MONGOLIA (1989, Dir: Ulrike Ottinger)\n\nWhile traveling on the Trans-Siberian railroad, a train of Western voyageuses (and three yiddish chanteuses) is taken hostage by a band of Mongolian huntresses, who force the travelers to dismount and follow them into the steppe. From dining car meals featuring whole swans to rituals in the dirt, the film is full of the detritus of colonial travelogues. While on the one hand a travel fantasy, it is also a rigorous ethnography, and simultaneously a practical joke: Ulrike Ottinger's vision of pan-global female play, in the form of a permeable, elegant narrative.\n\nThursday, November 12\n\nDERSU UZALA (1975, Dir: Akira Kurosawa)\n\nA co-production between Japan and the USSR, Kurosawa tells the story of the friendship between a Tungus trapper and a group of Russian surveyors at the turn of the 20th century, as the trapper leads the men through the Siberian landscape he knows so well. Based on explorer Vladimir Arseniev’s account of charting the Russian-Manchurian border, critic Donald Richie writes: \"One of the most beautifully composed and photographed of Kurosawa’s films, Dersu Uzala visually illustrates its theme—in Arseniev’s words: 'Man is too small to face the vastness of nature.'\"\n\nMonday, November 2\n\nJEANNE DIELMAN, 23 QUAI DU COMMERCE-1080 Bruxelles (1975, Dir: Chantal Akerman)\n\nat CINEFAMILY (611 N. Fairfax, Los Angeles)\n\nWhen Chantal Akerman, who died this past month, presented Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce-1080 Bruxelles at the Cannes Film Festival in 1975, she was only 25 (she was 24 when she directed it). The film, which chronicles a few days in the life of Dielman: a single mother and widow, played by Delphine Seyrig, is now understood to be a behemoth in the history of feminist filmmaking.\n\nBrilliantly adopting the meditative long-takes of structuralist cinema found in the experimental, non-narrative works of directors such as Michael Snow, Akerman uses these techniques to examine the alienation of our housewife protagonist. In stunning wide shots and real time, we observe the repetitive choreographies of Jeanne’s life: peeling potatoes, sponging her body, turning tricks in the afternoon. But all that remains unvoiced cannot be outrun, and her perfectly executed daily routines start to falter. The timing falls off. A coil starts to glow.\n\nDeliberate and frugal, but also symphonic, Jeanne Dielman was made by a young woman but with all the gravity of an examined life, and raised many of the questions that remain prescient about the female voice, concealed labor, and the nature of care.\n\nIn light of Akerman’s recent passing, the film seems imbued with symmetry; the numbered hours in Jeanne’s day (never enough) echoes the finite works in an artist's’ life, and Jeanne’s quiet domestic rebellion predicts Akerman’s own cinematic one—an expansive, unflinching approach to the medium that would remain persistent throughout her work.\n\nFriday, September 25th\n\nFUTURE PERFECT: TIME CAPSULES IN REAGAN COUNTRY (2015, Dir: Daniel Tucker)\n\nDaniel Tucker in conversation with artist Rosten Woo to follow!\n\nCompleted ten years after Ronald Reagan’s death, Future Perfect grows out of an interest in the continued echoes of a speech he delivered at the 1976 Republican National Convention following the end of his Governorship in California. Reagan talked about the difficulty he found in writing a letter for a time capsule to be sealed in Los Angeles and opened one hundred years in the future. Using this idea as a departure, Tucker explores Reagan’s future-oriented, science-fiction imagination and rhetoric, with visits to Reagan-inspired monuments and time capsules throughout California, archival footage, and interviews with political strategists, local historians, and astronomers alike. A cocktail reception will precede the screening. Drinks generously provided by Material Vodka + thematic food available all night by chef Stiff Peaks.\n\nSunday, September 20th\n\nA GRIN WITHOUT A CAT (1977, Dir: Chris Marker)\n\n“Some think the third World War will be set off by a nuclear missile. For me, that's the way it will end. In the meantime, the figures of an intricate game are developing, a game whose de-coding will give historians of the future — if they are still around — a very hard time.\n\nA weird game. Its rules change as the match evolves. To start with, the super powers' rivalry transforms itself not only into a Holy Alliance of the Rich against the Poor, but also into a selective co-elimination of Revolutionary Vanguards, wherever bombs would endanger sources of raw materials. As well as into the manipulation of these vanguards to pursue goals that are not their own.\n\nDuring the last ten years, some groups of forces (often more instinctive than organized) have been trying to play the game themselves — even if they knocked over the pieces. Wherever they tried, they failed. Nevertheless, it's been their being that has the most profoundly transformed politics in our time. This film intends to show some of the steps of this transformation.\"\n\n- Chris Marker\n\nThursday, September 17th\n\nOUT OF THE PRESENT (1995, Dir: Andrei Ujica)\n\nEssentially a found-footage film, this documentary incorporates film shot by cosmonauts on Space Station Mir, (the first 35mm to actually be shot in zero gravity) with news and amateur footage shot during the tense final days of the USSR; visualizing the end of a republic from the perspective of outer space. The film features the aging space station as a tawdry temporary home, with cosmonauts drinking Coke and lighting candles - contrasting the physical dependency of space with the vulnerability of life in the big Soviet cities. Due to the political turmoil back home, one crew member; Anatoli Azabarski, ended up staying ten months in space. Having left a Soviet, he returned as a Russian. The film premiered at Rotterdam in 1996.\n\nThursday, August 27th\n\nTHE FILMS OF SAUL LEVINE II: DREAMS DRIVEN\n\nPresented by Matthew Doyle\n\nCo-presented by Los Angeles Filmforum\n\nSaul Levine in attendance!\n\nDREAM LOVER DREAM (DV, 2015, 12m)\n\nDRIVEN (BOSTON AFTER DARK): JOE GIBBONS (DV, 2002, 83m)\n\n“I am interested in how people speak and how they look when they are thinking about what to say. As someone who once couldn’t’t speak at all, I am driven as a film/video maker to be a medium for others speech.” – Saul Levine\n\nFor the past forty years, Saul Levine has been making films, programming MassArt—the longest running microcinema in the US—and teaching in Boston. Throughout his career he’s shown a total commitment to adventurous programming and alternative, underground cinema. In 2002, Levine started to experiment with video, embarking on the series “Driven (Boston After Dark).” He describes these 16 pieces as 80 minute long tapes, shot without stopping while driving around Boston at night, with the driver talking and driving while he shoots. Making its world premiere, Driven (Boston After Dark): Joe Gibbons, is a rare portrait of Levine’s longtime friend, the recently incarcerated artist Joe Gibbons. This video will be preceded by another world premiere of a shorter work, Dream Lover Dream, also shot in a car around Boston, but during the daytime. The screening will be followed by a Q+A session with artist Matthew Doyle.\n\n“Saul Levine is the foremost dissenting filmmaker in America. With 35 years of consistent production behind him, and no signs of fatigue, he can show us the shape of a life passionately and uncompromisingly devoted to filmmaking. His works are high-energy messages of friendship, records of sexual love and political activism that are radiated by humor, prophetic anger, loneliness, and, occasionally, repose. His incessant, chaotic outpouring of political energy seems less geared to a naïve notion of bettering the world than to a perpetual pressure to keep it from getting worse.” — P. Adams Sitney\n\nA program of Saul Levine’s film work will be presented on Super-8 after sunset at Chin’s Push on Wednesday, August 26th. Saul will be in attendance at both screenings.\n\nSunday, August 9th\n\nTHE GRATEFUL DEAD MOVIE (1977, Dir: Jerry Garcia & Leon Gast)\n\nPresented by David Kordansky\n\nWith an Introduction by David Kordansky and Stuart Krimko\n\nShot over the course of a five-night stand at San Francisco’s Winterland Ballroom in October of 1974 (and edited by Jerry Garcia for years afterward), this classic concert movie captures the Dead at a creative height—touring with their massive Wall of Sound PA system—and on the cusp of a long, turmoil-filled hiatus. Constructing the full live experience from ample footage of the audience as well as the band, the film also includes impromptu interviews with fans, backstage action, an epic, psychedelic animation sequence by Gary Gutierrez, and a look back at the Dead’s freewheeling early days on the Haight-Ashbury. A document of a specific time and place, but also of an entire culture.\n\nThursday, July 30\n\nAFTER TILLER (2013, Dir: Lana Wilson & Martha Shane)\n\nSince abortion provider George Tiller's assassination in 2009, only four doctors continue to openly provide third-trimester abortions in the United State. This important documentary, which premiered at Sundance, chronicles the relationship of these four doctors to their work, tackling ethics, medical procedures, and the fear of violence the doctors must live with. The film delicately explores a number of patient cases, offering a window into the circumstances and emotion that precede such procedures, with moments both arresting and unexpectedly thoughtful. A.O. Scott called it a \"partisan document in the culture wars. It could hardly be otherwise, since the film's subject, abortion, is one where common ground is elusive, if not philosophically untenable.\"\n\nThursday, July 23\n\nDIARY OF A PREGNANT WOMAN (1958, Dir: Agnes Varda); MOTHER LOVE (1960, Dir: Harry Harlow); JOYCE AT 34 (1972, Dir: Joyce Chopra)\n\nIntroductions by writer Sasha Archibald and filmmaker/cinema professor Irene Lusztig\n\nA trio of short films that explore “mother” from oblique perspectives. A pregnant travelogue shot on Paris's rue Mouffetard, Agnes Varda's Diary of a Pregnant Woman takes an embodied point of view to examine creaturely life in the metropolis. Mother Love documents psychologist Harry Harlow's famous rhesus monkey experiments, in which he substituted inanimate objects, such as wire statues and stuffed animals, for female primates in order to study how monkeys form attachments. Joyce Chopra records her own relationship to being both a filmmaker and a new mother in Joyce at 34, a little-seen classic that poses fundamental feminist questions, made on a dare from a friend.\n\nThursday, July 9\n\nTHE MOTHERHOOD ARCHIVES\n\nDirector Irene Lusztig in Person!\n\nArchival montage, science fiction, and an homage to 1970s feminist filmmaking are woven together to form The Motherhood Archives, a lyrical essay film excavating hidden histories of childbirth in the 20th century. The film is a recuperation of obsolete pasts, begun when director Irene Lusztig first found out she was pregnant six years ago, and started scavenging ebay for old educational film reels about birth, mothering, and pregnancy. Assembling an extraordinary archive of over 100 educational, industrial, and medical training films, Lusztig's project untangles the complex, sometimes surprising histories of maternal education. From the first use of anesthetic ether in the 19th century to the postmodern 21st century hospital birthing suite, the film is a meditation on the maternal body; a site of institutional control, ideological surveillance, medical knowledge, and nationalist state intervention.\n\nThursday, May 21\n\nEvent: CUNT ART WAS THE FIRST ART\n\nCunt Art was the First Art is an evening about the role “cunt” played in early feminist art and consciousness raising. Between 1968 and 1974, women artists attempted to reclaim a positive female identity by creating what they termed “cunt art.” The legacy of cunt art was absorbed by feminist sex education and sex-positive third wave feminism.\n\nCunt Art was the First Art will include a historical account of feminist cunt iconography by Sasha Archibald; a performance of a 1971 cunt cheer by Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal; a short film about labia particularity Labial Quintet, by Courtney Stephens; and a rare screening of Near the Big Chakra, a 1971 experimental film by Alice Anne Parker (née Anne Severson). Described by Agnès Varda as “a new approach to our femininity,” Near the Big Chakra is a 17-minute silent film comprising extreme close-ups of 37 women’s vulvas. Made in 1971 and screened internationally in the early 1970s, audiences' reactions to the film—disgust, mockery, fist fights with the projectionist—made clear the degree to which Severson radically upends conventional imaging of female genitalia.\n\nThursday, April 30\n\nWHERE IS THE FRIEND’S HOME? (1987, Dir: Abbas Kiarostami)\n\nPresented by Jed Lackritz\n\nImportant in establishing Kiarostami's reputation outside of Iran, this film tells the story of a schoolboy who accidentally takes home a classmate's notebook. He knows the classmate is already on thin ice at school and will be unduly punished, so the boy sets out in secret to return the notebook, enlisting the help of adults. The film explores loyalty, the realities of rural Iran, and the small hero.\n\nThursday, April 16\n\nBUGSY MALONE (1976, Dir: Alan Parker)\n\nPresented by Honey Bird\n\nWorking with a cast entirely under the age of 17, Alan Parker set out to make a gangster musical that had everything he loved about The Godfather, but could be watched by kids. Based on the exploits of prohibition gangsters like Al Capone and Bugs Moran, the film stars 13-year-old Jodie Foster, and introduced Scott Baio (shooting cream pies instead of bullets). It features a soundtrack by Paul Williams (Phantom of the Paradise and The Muppet Movie) and was nominated for the Golden Palm at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival. Scott Baio later described the production process as \"awesome.\"\n\nSunday, April 12\n\nPEPPERMINT SODA (1977, Dir: Diane Kurys)\n\nPresented by Hedi El Kholti\n\n\"The only thing more impressive than the wit and talent Diane Kurys demonstrates in her writing and direction of \"Peppermint Soda\" — an expert, utterly charming movie that miraculously happens to be her first — is Miss Kurys's memory. Here is a letter-perfect recollection of what it's like to be a 13-year-old, in this case a French schoolgirl, with skinny legs and a bossy sister and a mother who doesn't understand she may be ruining her daughter's life if she keeps on refusing to let the kid wear stockings.\"\n\n-Janet Maslin, The New York Times\n\nWinner of the Prix Louis Delluc in 1977 as France’s best film of the year, Peppermint Soda follows the lives of two teenage sisters, Anne and Frédérique, through a full school year in Paris in the early 1960s. Through vignette, and wit"
