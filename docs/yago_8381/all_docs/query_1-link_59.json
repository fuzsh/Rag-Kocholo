        "text": "The true story of the 1980s German musical duo Milli Vanilli could be seen by cynical observers to have begun as farce and ended as tragedy. But despite this fictionalized film’s arguably goofy direct-address narration — from the actors playing the duo — it takes its subjects and their convoluted, unfortunate circumstances seriously.\n\nThe movie, written and directed by Simon Verhoeven (the German director is the son of the filmmaker Michael Verhoeven, and no relation to the Dutch director Paul Verhoeven), depicts the difficult childhood of Rob Pilatus. He was adopted by a white German couple, and he is first seen as a boy whose Afro all the neighbors want to touch.\n\nThe film follows Rob as he takes up dancing and forms a breaking team with the Paris-born Fab Morvan. They develop an eye-catching longhaired, leather-clad look and are discovered by the producer Frank Farian, a Svengali who convinces them that they don’t need to actually sing to reach the top of the charts.\n\nThose events are consistently eyebrow raising, if not jaw dropping. The worm turns when a backing tape they use for lip-syncing glitches during an ostensibly live concert. Soon the duo is forced to face up to the fact that they were willing — albeit self-deceiving — patsies. In 1998, Pilatus died from a drug and alcohol overdose.\n\nThe lead actors — Elan Ben Ali is Morvan, Tijan Njie is Pilatus — bear uncanny resemblances to their real-life models and are better-than-capable performers. (Other cast members are put at a disadvantage by bad wigs.) Viewers who press play with intent to scoff may be surprised with how genuinely caught up they become.\n\nGirl You Know It’s True\n\nNot Rated. Running time: 2 hours 4 minutes. In theaters."
