        "text": "Whoopi Goldberg has a decades-long reputation for saying the unfiltered thing. Today, though, she is strictly business and cheerful, finishing off high tea in a London hotel room with the calm of a star who has done hundreds of identical interviews. She first interrupts my introductory preamble – “Well, ask me your questions” – then swerves almost anything personal.\n\nSoon, though, she starts to relax. She begins to cackle at her own jokes. She stops self-censoring her swearing, after initially leaving the consonants off “f**k” and silently mouthing “motherf***er” when talking about the police officer who murdered George Floyd.\n\nRacial violence comes up because Goldberg is promoting Till, a moving biopic from director Chinonye Chukwu about Mamie Till-Mobley, the mother of Emmett Till, which Goldberg both stars in and produced. If you don’t know the story, 14-year-old Till was kidnapped, tortured and killed, allegedly for whistling at a white woman in 1955 Mississippi. The two white, adult defendants were acquitted, though they later confessed.\n\nVisual proof of racial hatred connects Floyd and Till’s stories. Goldberg could not stomach watching the whole nine-minute video of Floyd’s death in 2020, but understands its importance.\n\n“I’m in my sixties now, but when I was a little girl, people used to say, ‘What’s the next thing gonna be? We’re gonna see people getting killed on television?’” People used to think that couldn’t happen, she adds, kissing her teeth. “And then… there it was.”\n\nTill-Mobley didn’t have mobile phone footage to bolster her son’s case, but let photographers publish images of her boy’s swollen corpse when it was found in the Tallahatchie River. As Goldberg puts it: “Mrs Till-Mobley said, ‘They’re never gonna believe it unless we show them.’”\n\nGoldberg remembers hearing Emmett Till’s name as a girl of seven or eight, when her mother was telling her older brother Clyde about him. “You know, in quiet tones. And it just went” – she swings a hand upwards – “woo, over my head.” She was a New Yorker, and the Jim Crow South felt like a foreign country.\n\nDecades later, as filmmaker and Till co-writer Keith Beauchamp struggled to find financial backing for this movie about Till-Mobley’s fight for justice, Goldberg joined the project. All in, she and her fellow producers spent more than 10 years trying to get the film made.\n\nNow, she hopes that Danielle Deadwyler, playing Till-Mobley, gets an Oscar. “I would love us to just get a nomination for our movie. That would make me happy. But Danielle? I mean… The Woman King was good. There’s a lot of good stuff out there. But can’t nobody touch this girl.” She smiles widely.\n\nI’d asked what critical acclaim might mean to Goldberg this far into her career – and she’d dodged me, deferring to Deadwyler’s storming performance instead. Goldberg’s early 90s success came from films such as Ghost, The Color Purple and the Sister Act series. By the late 2000s, she’d completed her “EGOT” (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony wins). Since then, live-action feature films haven’t earned her as much critical acknowledgment.\n\nI press again. What would it mean for her, specifically? “I get to say: ‘Yeah, I was part of making this happen.’ And that, of course, is very good for my little ego. But in my soul of soul, in my heart of hearts, I want [Deadwyler] to be the second woman of colour to get an Academy Award as lead.” As a dark-skinned Black woman, particularly.\n\nThe US has changed in Goldberg’s lifetime. But she doesn’t fool herself into thinking it is a post-racial society. “Systemic racism in America allowed people to think nothing of murdering a 14-year-old boy. Nothing. And dealing with black people as though they were nothing.” She coils her hands up in a fist, her gold-painted nails catching the light.\n\nHow much have things changed, in her view, since the 50s, then? She won’t be drawn again. “Listen, the beauty of this movie? That people start to recognise themselves. If you’re an LGBTQ person, [conservative lawmakers] are talking about you. If you’re a woman who wants the right to do whatever she needs to do with her body, they’re talking about you.”\n\nAs Republicans try to ban schools from teaching children about racism, a film like this becomes a tool. “People are trying to throw off history,” Goldberg says, frowning. “But we thought, ‘We’re gonna tell the story anyway.’”\n\nHollywood has slowly started to evolve as Goldberg has matured, too. She famously got the role of Deloris Van Cartier in Sister Act after Bette Midler declined it. “I kept explaining to people, ‘When [a white woman] gets her period, it’s red. When I get my period, it’s red. It’s a chick.’” She cracks herself up. “Or I’d get some guy’s role and I’d say, ‘Listen, there’s nothing he can do that I can’t, except stand up to pee.’”\n\nShe is landing her punchlines, but there is a subtext to Goldberg’s gags. The film business continues to prize youth and often Eurocentric beauty for female actors, with women producers and directors still feeling like an anomaly.\n\nGoldberg has always been a scene-stealer. Even with her smooth skin and high cheekbones, all intact at 67, she has never really been framed by the media as a looker. People often seem to talk around what Goldberg had to confront as she established herself, I begin.\n\n“Well, the truth is, I didn’t have to confront it. They did. Because I’ve been black the whole time” – a sharp “ha” punctuates the end of her sentence. “Wake up in the morning: Black. Go to bed at night: Black. You have to figure it out – I don’t,” she says, as though speaking to the white gatekeepers of the time. “People used to say, ‘Oh, it must’ve been very difficult…’ and no. I asked for what I wanted and I got the things they were willing to give me.”\n\nNow, she is asking for a third Sister Act movie. In 2017, The View, the chat show she moderates, “to be kind, did a 25th anniversary of Sister Act” on which Goldberg told viewers she’d be up for a third film. “Then the public blew up Disney’s phones and texts.” As of October, she’s seen a draft of a script. She hopes it gets over the line.\n\nHer publicist has said that discussion of The View is off limits, but Goldberg herself brings it up. Last February, she was suspended from the show for two weeks for comments she made on air about the Holocaust – that it was “not about race” but rather was “white-on-white” violence. She apologised. She then seemed to double down on her views in a newspaper interview last month. She apologised again, in a statement concluding: “I believe that the Holocaust was about race, and I am still as sorry now as I was then that I upset, hurt and angered people.”\n\nAfter we speak, Goldberg is whisked off to appear on The One Show, where she looks down the lens, asking Maggie Smith to reprise her Sister Act role. She delivers a line, almost word for word, that she’d told me: “Maggie, if you say you don’t want to do it, I won’t bug you. But if you say you’re willing to do it, I’ll do whatever you want me to do.”\n\nShe is so charming that a recycled soundbite sounds fresh. As an elder statesperson of the movie business, Goldberg has nothing left to prove. She understands the publicity game, and plays it impeccably.\n\nStill, at one point with me, she lowers her voice conspiratorially, before saying that the James Bond and Till producer Barbara Broccoli deserves far more respect from Hollywood.\n\nShe glances at the hotel loo, where a publicist is stationed as we talk. Smiling, that three-packs-a-day voice nearing a purr, Goldberg lands a simple kiss-off to the industry naysayers.\n\n“People want you to be mad or upset, and they say stuff to make you nutty. And I’m just not buying it any more. I’m too old for that.”"
