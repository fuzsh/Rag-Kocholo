        "text": "DULUTH — Youth ages 8-18 have been getting in touch with their inner apostle or inner mean girl for the past four weeks at the Duluth Playhouse.\n\nProductions of \"Godspell Jr.\" and \"Mean Girls: High School Version\" are set to run over the next two weekends. The students from grades 3-8 will first take the stage Aug. 9-11 with \"Godspell\" and teens in grades 9-12 will take over Aug. 16-18 with \"Mean Girls.\"\n\n\"These are really good ensemble shows,\" said Denise Ruemping, director of education and youth programming for the Playhouse. \"That's what we aim for, so that everybody can be involved in the show. And we do have large casts with something like 34 kids in 'Godspell' and 28 in 'Mean Girls.'\"\n\n\"Godspell Jr.\" is a classic musical by Stephen Schwartz that features an eclectic blend of songs from pop to vaudeville. The show opens with a motley crew of characters from various walks of life coming together, guided by a charismatic leader who teaches them about kindness, tolerance and friendship.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, \"Mean Girls\" is a musical based on the 2004 film of the same name by Tina Fey with songs by Nell Benjamin and Jeff Richmond. The show follows Cady Heron, a sheltered teenager exposed to high school social dynamics for the first time and encounters the infamous mean popular girl group \"The Plastics.\"\n\nThis is Ruemping's first summer with the program and she said she's been impressed with the talent she's seen from the students involved with both productions.\n\n\"These intensives are just that — intense,\" she said. \"We go from auditions to rehearsals to performances in just four weeks. And yet these are some of the most talented kids I've seen. Be prepared to be blown away. I would have killed to have a voice like some of them at their age.\"\n\nDuluth eighth graders Paisley Kern and Baker Anderson have participated in the summer intensive programs every year since they were in third grade. Paisley said she likes working with professionals in the theater world and meeting students from other schools.\n\n\"You get all these tips from experienced people and make new friends with different connections,\" Paisley said. \"It's cool getting to know all these people who have the same interests as me from different places.\"\n\nPaisley is a Lincoln Park Middle School student while Anderson goes to Marshall School. Both students said they appreciate having the time to focus on the show itself as they haven't had time during the school year to be involved with theater at their schools yet.\n\n\"It's a good chance if you want to do it but maybe don't want to do the full thing,\" Anderson said. \"It's a good way to experience theater, whether you're new to it or old to it.\"\n\nBoth students play apostles during the show and have numbers where their singing and dancing abilities will be showcased. They will dance together in \"All for the Best.\"\n\n\"It's a hard time crunch, but it always turns out amazing, no matter the time, which I think is pretty cool,\" Paisley said.\n\nReagan Kern and Bea Martin play characters against their types in \"Mean Girls.\" Reagan will take on the ultra-mean queen bee, Regina George, while Martin steps into the ultra-sarcastic foil, Janis Sarkisian.\n\n\"Playing Regina is the most fun I have ever had playing a role,\" Reagan said. \"She's so not like me and it's so cool to just discover something in me that doesn't usually come out. It's really fun to play such a mean character.\"\n\nMartin agreed. \"Yeah, I love Janis, too, because she's got so many layers and I feel like I discover new things every day playing her,\" she said. \"It's a very different role for me but it's fun to grow with her.\"\n\nReagan has been involved with the summer intensive program since she was 8. She said she keeps returning because it's where she started her theater journey.\n\n\"When you show up on that Monday in Week 1, you're always like, 'There's no way we can do this, pull this together in three, four weeks?'\" Reagan said. \"Then all of a sudden we're at the end of Week 3 and we have a show. We did it.\"\n\nMartin called the production process \"squished\" and \"challenging\" but fun. \"It makes you work harder and pushes you to do a lot in a shortened amount of time,\" she said."
