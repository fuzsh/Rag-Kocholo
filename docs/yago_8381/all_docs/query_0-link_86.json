        "text": "'I don't know about that!\"laughed Catherine Deneuve, when asked if she had consciously \"built\" a career. \"It's like life: meetings, choices, love, struggle. I didn't know what would happen when I became an actress. And if I had known, I wouldn't have done it.\"\n\nDeneuve is -- unthinkably -- turning 60 this year. It is hard to imagine what modern French cinema would have been like without her. The poised girlishness of Umbrellas of Cherbourg,the chilly sexual abandon of Belle de Jour,the tormented woman in the Nazi-occupied Paris of Dernier Métro,the lesbian vampire of The Hunger,the mature woman caught in the colonial nightmare of Indochine -- all of them leave indelible images. And the image is, of course, of the glacial majesty of Catherine Deneuve, whom Look magazine once called the most beautiful woman in the world.\n\nGenerally speaking, actresses who are also great beauties have retreated to a discreet distance when they reach Deneuve's age. But she is still making two or three films a year, and in spite of the presence of younger goddesses like Juliette Binoche, she is still the reigning symbol of French eroticism.\n\nConsider 8 Femmes ( 8 Women),the Hitchcockian murder-mystery spoof in which she stars and which explains her presence at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this month. The witty premise of the film is not only that it is a story of eight women, all of them related and suspected of murdering the family patriarch, but that director François Ozon persuaded eight of the biggest stars in French cinema to take the roles.\n\nAs New Yorker critic Anthony Lane put it, the film isn't so much about its story as about \"the arrival, from nowhere, of a vast, untamable horde of French actresses.\"\n\nAnd yet moody Isabelle Huppert, steamy Fanny Ardant, incandescently gorgeous Emmanuelle Béart are not here in Toronto to sell the film. Deneuve has come alone, presumably because her wattage is still easily greater than theirs.\n\nDuring the press conference (which preceded a one-on-one interview) she looked regally at ease while a battery of cameras blazed away. A couple of them near me had snazzy full-colour viewfinders displaying Deneuve's image as the photographers worked.\n\nIt was startling. While the woman on the dais 10 feet away looked handsome and yet visibly her age, the woman in the camera viewfinder was ageless and luminous. When she turned her head in reality, she looked confident but otherwise unremarkable.\n\nIn the viewfinder, however, each small movement produced an iconic image that could have gone directly onto a magazine cover. As she once said, talent is not enough for an actress; it's also important to have a \"special relationship with the camera. It's like a chemistry. It's unfair in a way.\"\n\nTwo hours later, in the privacy of her hotel room, she had once again returned to human dimensions.\n\nShe was even vulnerable, since she had somehow (she refused to say how), burned the inside of her right wrist, which was bound in transparent surgical tape. \"It happened yesterday. It's nothing,\" she said briskly, and directed the conversation back to 8 Women.\n\nThe project arose when Ozon, a young director with only two notable feature films behind him, had the audacity to propose that a very bad 40-year-old play (\"it's a stupid play, really,\" he had told the press) be rewritten as a cinematic vehicle in which famous actresses could have a memorable cat fight with each other. In Ozon's words, \"it's funnier to see Catherine Deneuve struggling with Isabelle Huppert than two actresses nobody has heard of.\"\n\nAs Ozon had hoped, the French press immediately filled up with speculation about the real catfights that would ensue on set when eight formidable female egos were brought together. \"And of course we were aware of this,\" Deneuve says. \"And we didn't know each other. I had only worked with Danielle Darrieux [the 87-year-old doyenne of French film who plays the mother of Deneuve's character] But all eight of us knew each other without knowing each other, through our films. And we wanted it to work. Everybody was saying, 'They will fight, those actresses. So we made sure that did not happen.' \"\n\nShe was hesitant enough to wait until the other seven accepted before signing on. And she liked the idea that Ozon meant to spoof the original play, which was a straight murder mystery. His most outrageous idea was that each of the eight women, for no reason whatever, would burst into song at a certain point in the movie.\n\n\"And of course,\" she adds, \"that took me back to Umbrellas of Cherbourg.\" This is Jacques Demy's famous 1964 film in which the entire screenplay was sung, like an opera. With Roman Polanski's Repulsion a year later, it imprinted Deneuve's image on a whole generation. \"And Umbrellas gave French filmmakers the freedom to mix music into movies any way they liked, without it having to make sense. So in a way, Umbrellas made a film like 8 Women possible.\"\n\nDeneuve is the least nostalgic of women. Her approach to talking about her career is crisp and analytical, with very little personal coyness or tossing of bouquets to directors and actors she has worked with in the past. Of the great Luis Bunuel, for example, who directed her in Belle de Jour,she says with a small smile, \"I was a young actress with an older director, which can be difficult. And he was a director who needed actors but didn't need to talk to them very much.\"\n\nOf Deneuve's 92 feature films, perhaps 15 of the greatest are remembered and rented and raved about today. But a surprising number of others were risky and experimental films for their time, and I was curious to see how she'd react to a question about one of them. So I asked her about Marco Ferreri's 1973 Don't Touch the White Woman,a Viet Nam-era satire of U.S. pretensions which was set in the Wild West of a century ago, but a Wild West which we see at the end is just a film set built inside a Paris stadium.\n\nShe had no trouble calling it to mind, perhaps because it also starred Marcello Mastroianni, with whom she had one of her two children (actress Chiara Mastroianni). \"I have the fondest memories of Don't Touch the White Woman. That was a crazy but very interesting film. Nowadays, a film like that is hard to make. Everything has to go on television now, you see, so there must always be a consensus. And many interesting things cannot command a consensus.\"\n\nShe would place 8 Women in the category of interesting things which did indeed command a consensus. Ozon had hoped at most for two or three stellar actresses to accept, but in the end all eight did. And this is interesting, because all eight of the characters turn out to be unsavoury creatures. They've all been seducing each other's husbands and boyfriends, two or three of them jump into bed with each other, and the youngest and apparently most innocent has concocted an enormous trap for all the others.\n\nAt one point Deneuve exchanges a steamy kiss with Fanny Ardant. Was that difficult? \"A kiss is always difficult in a film. You become a person then. You have to touch someone else. It's delicate. But I had no more apprehension about kissing Fanny Ardant than kissing an actor.\" She has spoken in similar clinical fashion about her love scenes with Susan Sarandon in The Hunger,although adding with mordant humour that when it became public that a body double had been used in the nude scene \"thousands of lesbians wept.\"\n\nHer indifference as to whether she is kissing a man or woman on camera has nothing to do with her personal sexuality (she is resolutely heterosexual), and everything to do with separating her personal self from the roles she plays. She often says that she has to \"protect\" her private self, and that her idea of acting has little to do with revealing herself personally.\n\n\"That is especially the case with 8 Women,\"she says. \"My character, Gaby, is easier to play when I imagine her as a little monster. All the women are monsters. The film is not a tribute to women, it's a tribute to actresses. In fact, I don't think it says anything truthful about women at all. At least, I hope not.\"\n\nDeneuve is obviously intelligent and highly composed. She's not mean toward anyone, but she seems to observe life from an amused distance. Asked whether she gave advice to the younger actresses in 8 Women,she feigned astonishment. \"I don't give advice to actors unless I'm asked. I don't even give advice to my two children, who are both actors.\"\n\nShe once said that she was offended the first time she was described as an \"ice princess,\" but that after a few years she decided the description suited her quite well. Similarly, she has decided she quite likes Gérard Depardieu's famous description of her as \"the man I always wanted to be.\"\n\n\"He loves the masculinity in me, as I love the femininity in him.\" She gazes intently at the interviewer. \"Or as you no doubt love the femininity in yourself!\"\n\nShe pauses a moment. \"Yes, I suppose in my films I incarnate femininity. But it's not a contradiction. The two [gender]qualities are complementary.\"\n\nWhich leads to the difficult question of how she has dealt with growing older. She replies that it was difficult for her, but from the time she was in her early 50s, \"I forced myself to be realistic about it.\"\n\nOne decision she made was that she will do much less acting in English \"because I haven't been offered interesting parts in American movies. There is an incredible refusal of growing old in American films. And they don't offer as interesting parts to European as American actors.\"\n\nBut this is no hardship, because the French cinema is very lively these days. \"It is still throwing up interesting young directors like François Ozon, who has even been described as subversive. And of course that is irresistible to me.\""
