        "text": "This post comes from Cynthia Pelayo, a horror novelist and poet who won the Bram Stoker Award for Best Poetry Collection in 2022. You can learn more about her on her website, or from her author bio at the end of this post.\n\nHorror is such a vast, dark sea of possibility, it can be hard to know where to start. As a horror author myself, I can definitely relate to struggling with scope! But after writing and contributing to various works of horror over the past decade ‚Äî including my short story collection Loter√≠a and poetry anthology Crime Scene ‚Äî I now have a much better understanding of horror than I once did.\n\nIn this post, I‚Äôll attempt to draw on that understanding (as well as some horror classics and personal favorites) to help you write a horror novel of your very own!\n\nWhat do we mean when we say ‚Äúhorror‚Äù?\n\nA few years back, I saw author Grady Hendrix conduct a presentation on his novel The Final Girl Support Group. He said something that stuck with me ‚Äî that he doesn‚Äôt think of horror as a genre in the traditional sense, but instead as more of a category, and then within that category there‚Äôs a huge variety of subgenres. These would include horror comedy, horror romance, sci-fi horror, adventure horror, and so on.\n\nIn other words, horror as a ‚Äúgenre‚Äù can run from quiet, cozy horror to dark, intense horror to truly graphic and extreme horror. So what really makes a novel a horror novel? Perhaps the most accurate definition would be: ‚Äúa work of fiction that creates a pervasive sense of fear.‚Äù\n\nIn his nonfiction book Writing In the Dark, Tim Waggoner says that ‚Äúhorror comes from a violation of what characters perceive to be reality.‚Äù Waggoner spends much of the book discussing this distortion, and how it can pertain to the rules of humanity, space and time, nature, society, and more.\n\nWaggoner emphasizes that the core of your horror concept should relate to this violation, because it‚Äôs what will allow you to frighten readers on a deeper level.\n\nComing up with your horror concept\n\nSo when planning the theme of your horror novel, ask yourself: how can I push the envelope on a certain set of perceived rules?\n\nAre you going to explore an everyday citizen‚Äôs descent into madness? Perhaps you‚Äôll take us on a vast landscape infested with otherworldly creatures? Will you take us on a journey of a haunted home, or a haunted person? Or will you push the boundaries of society altogether?\n\nThis is why horror can be so effective: it allows the writer so much flexibility to explore human existence, philosophical questions, what is good, what is evil, and more. All this while thrilling and entertaining readers with frightening ideas and vivid imagery!\n\nHow to write a horror novel: 5 key ingredients\n\nThere are many factors to consider when writing a horror novel. First off, I‚Äôll cover the basics ‚Äî prose and plot ‚Äî and how they play into the craft of horror writing. Then we‚Äôll get into the specifics of characters, setting, and other important ingredients to add to your witch‚Äôs brew of a novel.\n\nProse: pinpointing your style\n\nProse is the flow of words, the writing style, and what you often hear referred to as ‚Äúvoice‚Äù in a novel or other work of fiction. Many authors will tell you that when they began writing, they did so by replicating the voices ‚Äî prose styles ‚Äî of other authors.\n\nIn my own writing, I strive to conjure rich imagery and create narrative intensity with different stylistic ‚Äúlayers.‚Äù I‚Äôll often do this by incorporating my poetic voice into my prose, weaving in poetry to create a dream-like effect; this creates a disruption of the reality we are exploring in the story. I‚Äôll then move into sequences that are written much more straightforwardly, to punctuate the brutality or violence being explored.\n\nPlot: to outline or not to outline?\n\nHaving narrowed down your theme and premise, you can now think about the exact trajectory of your horror plot. What should happen at each stage of the story? Should you outline each suspenseful beat before you start writing, or should you have only a vague shape of the plot in your mind? In other words, will you be plotting or pantsing?\n\nMany writers outline; others do not. Some writers outline some novels, but for other novels ‚Äî maybe once they feel a bit more confident ‚Äî they allow the writing to unfold more organically. I will say that, in my experience, some people are reluctant to outline because then they feel as though ‚Äúthe story has already been told‚Äù and they‚Äôre no longer inspired to write it.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that there are many ways to outline ‚Äî and for your horror novel to pack sufficient punch, you‚Äôll probably want some form of outline to ensure you‚Äôre pacing your story effectively.\n\nIn that vein (vampire pun üßõ), you should have at least a few bullet points that serve as a road map pointing where you need to go to next. And even with this relatively flexible outline, don‚Äôt feel like you must follow it to the letter! If your characters decide to deviate from what was specified for them on the outline, you can simply adjust your approach as needed and continue going wherever your story takes you.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about characters, stakes, and setting to flesh out (zombie pun üßü) your horror novel even more.\n\nCharacters: the key figures in your cast\n\nEvery good novel, but especially every good horror novel, needs a solid protagonist and antagonist. We‚Äôll start with your horror protagonist: the main character whose actions and reactions to the events drive the plot.\n\nProtagonist ‚Äì they don‚Äôt need to be sympathetic\n\nOne of my main tips here is that in horror, unlike in other genres, the reader does not necessarily need to sympathize with the protagonist.\n\nThink about Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, or Jack Torrance in The Shining. Whether they start off evil, become corrupted over time, or have their true nature revealed in a plot twist, many horror protagonists are not only unlikable, but outright twisted and, well, horrifying.\n\nOf course, in a horror novel, the main character does not always have a happy ending. In fact, many horror writers will kill off their main character in the end, or (as mentioned) reveal that the main character was actually the villain the entire time.\n\nHorror novels offer a lot of flexibility when it comes to the classic rules of what a protagonist ‚Äúcan‚Äù and ‚Äúcannot‚Äù be. In fact, a non-traditional protagonist can be a great way of creating that sense of violation that Tim Waggoner talks about! Setting your main character up to seem like a hero, then pulling the rug out from under them, is a great way to unsettle and even disturb readers ‚Äî just as any great horror novel should.\n\nAntagonist ‚Äì can be a person, the landscape, or a supernatural force\n\nWhoever your protagonist is, remember that your antagonist (by definition) is meant to antagonize them. They are the primary obstacle to the protagonist and their goal ‚Äî and in horror specifically, I‚Äôve learned, this antagonism can take many forms.\n\nHorror is known for having both ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and ‚Äúsupernatural‚Äù antagonists (rather than human antagonists) in greater quantities than other genres. Basically, in horror, the antagonist is more likely to be a) the landscape, weather, or an animal, or b) a supernatural force like a ghostly or demonic presence.\n\nFor example, William Peter Blatty keeps it simple with The Exorcist: the antagonist is the Devil. Or think about Jeff VanderMeer‚Äôs Annihilation ‚Äî in this story, the landscape is the antagonist, and the characters have no idea how it will mutate or even destroy their bodies and minds.\n\nBut again, the key thing here is that the antagonist opposes your protagonist. So if you‚Äôve chosen to write an evil protagonist, your antagonist should either be a force for good‚Ä¶ or even more evil than the protagonist.\n\nPsychology and stakes: what‚Äôs at risk for the characters?\n\nNext up, let‚Äôs discuss character psychology and establishing realistic stakes for your story. For those just starting to write horror, it may be useful to read books which delve deeply into human psychology and motivation. Robert Bloch‚Äôs Psycho and Thomas Harris‚Äô The Silence of the Lambs are two great examples of this.\n\nIn both books, there‚Äôs a terrifying character (Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter respectively) for whom we nonetheless feel some sympathy ‚Äî Bates because of his vulnerability and unhealthy dependence on his mother, Lecter because he‚Äôs clearly very intelligent and because, despite his occasional reluctance, he does ultimately help the FBI catch other serial killers.\n\nThese are the kinds of psychological profiles you should strive for in your own horror story, for heroes and villains alike: they should be complex, flawed and vulnerable, and somewhat understandable even if their actions are monstrous.\n\nSpeaking of monstrous actions, I also want to talk about stakes, which are sort of the natural corollary of character motivations.\n\nOne book with fairly ‚Äúsimple‚Äù motivations and stakes, yet incredible impact, is Laurel Hightower‚Äôs Crossroads. This ‚Äúquiet horror‚Äù novella concerns a mother named Chris who has lost her son and is desperate to bring him back into her life ‚Äî through supernatural means if necessary.\n\nThis book illustrates how conflicting stakes can make for a more engaging story:\n\nIf Chris gives up trying to contact her son, she risks losing him forever.\n\nBut if she continues going to such unnatural lengths, she‚Äôs putting herself and those around her in danger.\n\nSetting: how does it emphasize the horror?\n\nFinally, let‚Äôs get into setting ‚Äî if you haven‚Äôt already thought about it in the context of setting-as-antagonist.\n\nHorror settings can vary from a single location (like a house, hotel, or even a single room) to an entire city, or outer space and beyond. Remember that your setting, even if it isn‚Äôt an outright ‚Äúantagonist,‚Äù should have certain elements which feel sinister to the reader‚Ä¶ and the way you describe your setting should ratchet up suspense and, ideally, tie into the plot.\n\nDan Simmons‚Äô The Terror, which takes place in the arctic ice fields during an 1845 expedition, is one particularly excellent example of an atmospheric setting. Readers can practically feel the biting cold and the edges of ice closing in on them, contributing to a sense of, well, chilling dread.\n\nOther factors to consider\n\nMood and atmosphere\n\nWhat do you want the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù of your book to be? While most horror novels could obviously be described as scary, there are countless ways to scare someone, so try to narrow down your goals before writing.\n\nBasically, what kind of fear do you want to instill in readers ‚Äî creeping dread, shocking horror (the literary equivalent of ‚Äújump scares‚Äù), visceral disgust, pure disorientation? Whatever it is, I‚Äôd recommend always keeping this ‚Äúmood‚Äù in mind as you‚Äôre writing, so you can continuously immerse readers in it.\n\nSuspense and tension\n\nRegardless of your intended ‚Äúmood,‚Äù you‚Äôll definitely want to build suspense and tension throughout your horror story.\n\nSuspense might be defined as ‚Äúthe anticipation of a future event or outcome,‚Äù while tension could be defined as ‚Äúthe stress and other emotions connected to that suspense.‚Äù You‚Äôll need both for effective horror writing ‚Äî whether through eerie foreshadowing or a menacing unreliable narrator, it‚Äôs vital that you generate this anticipation, stress, and fear that things will go wrong (and/or terror when they do).\n\nThe climax\n\nSpeaking of things going wrong, I lastly wanted to touch on what is perhaps the most important part of a horror novel: the climax.\n\nThe climax typically takes place at around the 90-98% mark ‚Äî depending on whether you want a bit of ‚Äúfalling action‚Äù for readers to recover, or if you just want to drop the mic and get out of there. It depends on the effect you‚Äôre after, but regardless of the amount of falling action, I would definitely suggest drawing out the climactic scene itself.\n\nFor example, think about Wendy and Danny escaping the Overlook Hotel in The Shining. They don‚Äôt just knock out Jack Torrance and escape in a matter of seconds. Instead, there‚Äôs a prolonged chase involving a croquet mallet (an axe in the film), sentient topiary animals, and a dangerously unstable boiler.\n\nAll this helps create that nail-biting tension we‚Äôve talked about ‚Äî and a feeling of huge relief when Wendy and Danny finally do escape.\n\nPro tip: the climax in a horror novel, especially in Stephen King, is often a battle or physical struggle. So if you‚Äôre stuck on what your climax should be, remember that you can‚Äôt go wrong with a good old-fashioned battle! And more more excellent advice on how to end your horror story, check out this great post by Peter Derk.\n\nIn conclusion: the nature of fear\n\nWriting horror, at least for me, brings back certain questions and ideas over and over. What is fear? What is scary to different people? How can that fear be harnessed and used not just to create an exciting story, but to make people reflect on its themes?\n\nOne of the most fascinating things about fear is how subjective it is. Some people are most frightened by things in reality ‚Äî darkness, disease, death ‚Äî while others find supernatural concepts scarier than anything in our world.\n\nUltimately, when writing a horror novel, I would strongly recommend trying to get to the heart of your own biggest fears. What do you find scary, and can you identify why? This is key to tapping into emotions that will work amazingly well on the page.\n\nThere are so many ways to write a horror story. But if you can let your own fears and imagination guide you ‚Äî balancing these things with a solid structure, well-rounded characters, and carefully formulated tension ‚Äî you‚Äôll be well on your way to success."
