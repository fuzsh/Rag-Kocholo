        "text": "I don't know about you guys, but to me, there's nothing better than totally humorless people trying to be funny, except really strange humorless people trying to be funny. This is like making a biopic of Jim Carrey and casting Juliette Binoche as Jim.\n\nReally an exceptionally bad film. It is a complete waste of time, and absolutely do not buy it, but it is very much worth renting and watching for ten minutes just because you simply won't believe your eyes. I'm glad I did it just for the experience. Your reaction will give you a new understanding of the word \"aghast\".\n\nReader's comment in yellow\n\nI was lucky (or unlucky) enough to see this truly odd film in a first-run theater in Nice the week it was released. Although my French wasnt nearly as fluent then, it was plenty good enough to recognize that I was witness to a marvelously surreal event. To make sure, I would occasionally glance at my fellow-patrons - yep, they were just as slack-jawed as I. (To no great surprise the audience numbered about 20 in this 500 seat theater - the film had been playing about four days and the word was very definitely out.)\n\nWhat drove me into the movie-house was probably the same impulse that made you pop it in your VCR - and I was just as disappointed to discover Deneuve stayed clad. After this apparent train-wreck of a movie was over I became mildly fascinated to discover how it came about. This is some of what I read/was told/remember.\n\nFerreri, coasting on the bounce from \"La Grande Bouffe\" could basically do what he wanted. One story is he complained to Mastroianni that he had nothing ready to film and Mastroianni said in effect Cmon, Marco, youll never have a chance like this again - you can take the worst piece of shit script out of your trunk and theyll let you do it! Ferreri confessed hed always wanted to do a Western and had an old unfinished script. Perfect, said Mastroianni but he couldnt be in it; he had about 5 pictures lined up and wouldnt have time to go to the US. So Ferreri said fuck it (or the Italian equivalent), well shoot it here. Whaddya mean, here? They were in cab passing through Les Halles. (You know, Les Halles? Of course you do. Pariss centuries old meat market district where we all used to go at 2 am in our black existential turtlenecks for onion soup and frîtes with the ouvriers )\n\nMastroianni: Whaddya mean youll shoot it here?? In the meat market??\n\nFerreri: Theyre tearing it down, theyre moving it all out to the suburbs. In two months none of these buildings will be standing..."
