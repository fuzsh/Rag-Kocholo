        "text": "Screen greats Carole Lombard (Supernatural) and Charles Laughton (Devil and the Deep) star in the gripping Pre-Code drama about forbidden love, White Woman. The world of a widowed nightclub performer (the luminous Lombard) changes drastically when she agrees to marry a wealthy plantation owner (the larger-than-life Laughton). As the two begin their domestic life together on his remote Malaysian estate, she realizes the extent of his cruel and jealous nature. She soon finds herself drawn to another man but must keep their love secret to avoid the wrath of her husband. Hollywood ace Stuart Walker (The Eagle and the Hawk) directs and Charles Bickford (The Plainsman), Kent Taylor (Iâ€™m No Angel) and Percy Kilbride (The Egg and I) co-star in White Woman, which barrels to a white-knuckle climax set deep within in the dark heart of the jungle."
