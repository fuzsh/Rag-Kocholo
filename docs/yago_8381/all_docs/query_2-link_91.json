        "text": "Semi-transgressive Italian filmmaker Marco Ferreri's late-career 1991 feature (aka La Carne) capitalizes on the stupendous anatomy of starlet Francesca Dellera, who is very close to a Jessica Rabbit come to life. Otherwise, it's a loosely-plotted dark comedy more in the vein of an obtuse Godard or Buñuel manifesto than it is erotic, despite some generously exposed skin. Dellera plays a voluptuous “bellissima” type, homeless after being expelled by her Indian love guru (and having had an abortion). She drifts into the arms of a lounge pianist (Sergio Castellitto) who is separated from his hated wife and living la vie boheme by a seaside artillery range. Their passionate idyll ends when the flaky heroine's attempt to leave triggers a grotesque act of violence. Presented in a remastered edition for this Blu-ray/DVD Combo release, extras include a behind-the-scenes featurette, an interview with Ferreri, Dellera, and Castellitto, and footage from the 1991 Cannes Film Festival premiere. A minor cult film from a lauded anarchic director, this is recommended. (C. Cassady)"
