General George A. Custer is attempting to repress the Indian resistance, but Buffalo Bill tries to steal the show…. A burlesque and anachronistic revisiting of the Battle of Little Bighorn transposed to the center of Paris and performed by a joyful cast lights the fuse of a glorious icon of American mythology. The political farce of the narrative collides with the real-life transformation of the modern capital, documenting the demolition of the ancient market of Les Halles. This parodic revenge Western film was shot against all odds; if La Grande Bouffe was Ferreri’s biggest success, Don’t Touch the White Woman! was his biggest commercial failure. 35mm print from Cinecittà.
