For the most part these women live and work in countries governed by complex political and social situations. Nineteen artists have been chosen by Francesco Bonami for the exhibition “Non toccare la donna bianca” (Don’t touch the white woman). The title is as provocative as the film directed by Marco Ferreri in 1976, which according to the curator “aims to be a reflection on how woman, as a historic subject, represents the symbol of diversity and liberation in our society”.

Their works, many of which are on show for the first time and created especially for the galleries at the Foundation in a setting designed by the Cliostraat group, range from painting, video, installations and photography. Alongside Shirin Neshat and Mona Hatoum, there are works by emerging artists such as African-American Senga Nengudi and Brazilian Valeska Soares. E.S.
