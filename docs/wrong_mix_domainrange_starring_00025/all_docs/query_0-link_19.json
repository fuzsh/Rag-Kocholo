        "text": "Movie Review: Sometimes Always Never (2018)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nThere are sometimes actors that embody a word so perfectly, they might as well be the textbook example of it. But when it comes to Bill Nighy, he straddles two particular words — elegant and odd. Even in his bolder roles (e.g., the aging rocker Billy Mack in “Love Actually”) Nighy never loses his poise,…\n\nMovie Review: Hope Gap (2019)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nHope Gap is one of those typical independent movies, where mood, atmosphere and setting dominates more than the narrative. There are no complaints here, because the film’s frequent dallying at these seaside locations and our watching the characters walk along the shoreline or climb up various rocky features is quite beautiful to look at. I…\n\nMovie Review: Pokémon Detective Pikachu (2019)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nPokémon Detective Pikachu is a film not unlike the Pokémon that populate it. On the surface it appears simple — a collection of seen-it-before neo-noir aesthetics, cute creatures, and a generic story, all tied together with a few charming leads. However, this is merely a façade. Before long it reveals itself to be a beast…\n\nMovie Review: The Limehouse Golem (2016)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nNo responses\n\nVictorian London has been an effective setting since virtually the beginning of cinema, perhaps unsurprisingly since it was during this period that moving pictures first appeared. From the first adaptation of “The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde” to Basil Rathbone’s incarnation of “Sherlock Holmes,” from Alfred Hitchcock’s “The Lodger” to Johnny Depp’s…\n\nMovie Review: The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2015)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n4 responses\n\nDespite the fact that all the characters’ stories were nicely tied up in bow by the end of “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,” “Shakespeare in Love” director John Madden has decided to return to the helm to treat viewers to the continuing adventures of the residents in The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. In this…\n\nMovie Review: I, Frankenstein (2014)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n11 responses\n\nIf Mary Shelley were alive today she would cry at the sight of I, Frankenstein, the latest movie that wrongly tries to make an action hero of a classic universal monster. Thankfully, though, she is dead, so turning over in her grave is the most we can expect to see from her. Adapted from a…\n\nMovie Trailer: I, Frankenstein (2014)\n\nMovie Trailers\n\n9 responses\n\nIf you thought Frankenstein’s monster was just some slow, plodding brute, then you need to watch the trailer for Lionsgate’s I, Frankenstein. Traveling the Earth through the centuries he’s bore witness to many events but never involved himself. That is until two clans — one of great gargoyle beasts and the other of demonlike creatures…"
