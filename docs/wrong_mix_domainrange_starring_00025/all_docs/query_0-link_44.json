        "text": "And when I say actor, I'm referring to all flavours of human beings.\n\nYou are also more than welcome to suggest a film that show's off their talent. Or you could break the role down to action, adventure, drama, comedy or such like.\n\nIn reply to JimR:\n\n> I was sort of joking but he did some good films. I always liked The Quiet Man but thats well out of your 50 year window .. I'm showing my age now I always rated Clint Eastwood as well\n\nClint is very entertaining but is he a great actor? I often feel he plays almost the same character in most of his films (certainly his Westerns). It depends on how 'finest' is defined. From the era when I was actually paying to see a film - Tom Hanks might be a contender (he's certainly had a good long innings).\n\nIn reply to Lankyman:\n\n100% agree. Clint only ever played Clint, but we loved him playing him. A wonderful screen actor, but not a contender for greatest actor of the last 50 imho.\n\nHe of course said it best himself, I have two looks, the one with the hat, and the one without the hat.\n\nIn reply to The Lemming:\n\n50 years is too short a period because Peter o' Toole is the best by far.....and the film which shows off his talent has got to be Lawrence of Arabia. The best film of all time.... mind you Sidney Poitier was good in TH of TN...as was Rod Steiger....all outside the qualifying time though.\n\nPost edited at 19:20\n\nIn reply to The Lemming:\n\nBit male so far. Women are actors too (formerly known as actresses).\n\niâ€™d nominate Meryl Streep, my two favourites being Sophie's Choice and Bridges of Madison County (and she made many more). Such a versatile actress who was brilliant with accents.\n\nPost edited at 20:01\n\nIn reply to The Lemming:\n\nFFS who recommended Keanu Reeves? Finest FILM actor of the last 50 years? ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ I kinda like him within his very limited range. But even as one of those sort of wooden actors who still manage somehow to be good the best is definitely Christopher Walken. If you want to go back further it's Robert Mitchum.\n\nPost edited at 21:11\n\nIn reply to The Lemming:\n\nAnother one to add, Olivia Colman really is superb. Hard to take and objective view as sheâ€™s so much of the moment right now, but sheâ€™s superb in everything she appears in.\n\nTyrannosaur is my favourite of hers. Absolutely incredible performance.\n\nIn reply to Removed User:\n\n> Shout out for Gary Oldman due to his ability to physically transform into a huge range of characters. Possibly not enough of a front man to make the grade though.\n\nHes one of those actors where I'm amazed at the roles hes played when I think back. I'm always a bit taken aback when I remember how much of a nasty bastard he played as the baddie in Leon.\n\nSimilar to Dustin Hoffman. When I remember he was Hook? No way!\n\nIn reply to The Lemming:\n\nThereâ€™s a â€˜greatest guitarist of all timeâ€™ thread which circulates most of the platforms constantly. If you use a strict metric of â€˜brillianceâ€™ (whatever that is), you get a shortlist which starts with Joe Pass and Wes Montgomery, maybe Django Reinhardt, definitely Eddie Van Halen, Jeff Beck, Alan Holdsworth, Pat Metheney, Steve Vai, Jimi Hendrixâ€¦the list goes on, and grows all the time, Guthrie Govan, the kid with the tattoos in Polyphiaâ€¦.etc.\n\nThen you run it through the filter of relevance, does anyone listen to them, because at the end of the day theyâ€™re entertainers. Rick Beatoâ€™s youtube channel often picks up the stats. In the grand scheme of things, hardly anyone listens to any of those players, exceptâ€¦for Eddie Van Halen. Out of that list, the only ones I actually listen to regularly are Jeff Beck, Pat Metheney, EVH plus the guys in Slayer, Megadeth, etc. I canâ€™t remember the last time I listened to Hendrix or my hero Rory Gallagher. So maybe the same applies to films? Looks like The Rock wasnâ€™t such a bad suggestion after all?ðŸ˜‚\n\nIn reply to paul_in_cumbria:\n\nThat's interesting, I listen to hendrix a bit still although once you know most of the hits I guess you don't listen to them as much as you think you do. A favourite of mine is richie blackmore and I've been listening to him more again since watching the recent Dio documentary. I really like Jeff beck but don't actually listen to him that much or Dave gilmour. I think by beatos metric brian may probably wins.\n\nFor actor I guess I'd go for Jack Nicholson, I really like Paul Giamatti but he doesn't seem to have done much recently.\n\nIn reply to philipivan:\n\nI love Paul Giamatti, but heâ€™s only ever been the lead once so Iâ€™m not sure if he qualifies due to that.\n\nOne of the best supporting actors in the business though, no doubt.\n\nIâ€™d say the same for Paddy Considine and Mark Strong.\n\nIn reply to The Lemming:\n\nThe late American Actor Brian Dennehy https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dennehy has to be a contender despite never making mega stardom. Many roles to pick there. OK this one's from a TV series not a film, but his portrayal of John Wayne Gacey practically had me shouting at the telly at the character he was so good an actor\n\nEdit: his personal life \"Vietnam\" thing was a bit odd, maybe that's why he never achieved real fame\n\nPost edited at 11:27\n\nIn reply to Blue Straggler:\n\nRight you are. Have only seen Sideways and thought that was his only lead but I stand corrected.\n\nPoint remains that heâ€™s rarely the lead thoughâ€¦\n\nSteve Buscemi is another one - wonderful character/supporting actor, but too rarely the lead to be considered for being the greatest.\n\nIn reply to AllanMac:\n\nApologies if I missed the nominations, but I can't see any mention of the John's?\n\nTuturro and Malkovich must be up there?\n\nAnyway, it's de Niro for me.\n\nFor the women, Diana Quick stole my heart for her portrayal of Julia Flyte in the old Granada TV classic, Brideshead Revisited, 1981. I remain faithful\n\nIn reply to Strife:\n\nBrilliant in Magnolia, funny as hell in Tropic Thunder. Heâ€™s undeniably a brilliant actor.\n\nFunny one though isnâ€™t he? Never really the critics or film bores favourite, probably as a lot of his films fall into that blockbuster category rather than chin stroking meaningful pieces.\n\nBut then if cinema is about getting bums on seats, entertaining people for a couple of hours and sending them home happy and turning a big profit (which I canâ€™t see why it shouldnâ€™t be) then Cruise is one of the best in the business. Iâ€™m just not sure that makes him the best actor? If it does, then weâ€™re back to the Dwayne Johnson argument!\n\nIn reply to Iamgregp:\n\n> Come now, this is UKC forum, the natural home of internet based pedants!\n\n> If you'd managed to spell one of her names incorrectly I might have let it slide, but misspelling both...\n\nHave you considered that I am dyslexic?\n\nOr would you rather make fun of my disability?\n\nBe careful when you play the pedant card.\n\nIn reply to JimR:\n\n> Surprised no one seems to have mentioned Tom Hanks. Got to be in contention\n\nSeveral already have further up the thread - yes, he is a fine actor. He seems to have had longevity without controversy (although I got the impression he wasn't a big fan of Ricky Gervais hosting the Golden Globes).\n\nIn reply to The Lemming:\n\n> Wonder why that would be?\n\n> BTW, Ricky has been booked again for the Awards Night.\n\nI wouldn't know. I get the impression that Hanks is just one of those people who would rather the image of Hollywood 'glamour' remained untarnished. When Gervais punctures the bubble with a savage dose of sarcasm and wit he's (obviously) upset. I haven't heard of any mud attaching to Hanks personally.\n\nIn reply to Lankyman:\n\nTom Hanks credits his relative low count of skeletons in the closet to the fact that his career started and grew so well because he predated the internet and social media era.\n\nIn one interview I saw, Tom said without the scrutiny of the internet and the ability to document failings for ever online, he was able to make mistakes as a younger person, and those mistakes would just fade with time. He recounted being at his most rebellious around his Money Pit film. Back then, he had the luxury of making mistakes in life and not have them documented on the internet to follow him around for ever.\n\nIn reply to johncoxmysteriously:\n\n> Good grief - isnâ€™t Viggo M the chap who played Aragorn in Lord of the Rings? If so, I donâ€™t think I could name a worse actor of the last 50 years. Probably I have the wrong man.\n\nHe is Aragorn but that's quite a damning indictment. He's done some good films although I certainly wouldn't rate him in the top flight. History of Violence was good. I haven't seen it but he was apparently good playing Rick Stanton (cave diver) in the recent Thirteen Lives.\n\nIn reply to The Lemming:\n\nThere are many talented and unknown actors who have graced the big and small screens over the last few decades. However, it is hard to choose just one who stands out as the most underrated and undiscovered talent. Some possible contenders include John Hawkes, who has delivered powerful and memorable performances in films such as Winter"
