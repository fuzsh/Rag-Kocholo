        "text": "A buddy cop comedy relies on the chemistry between the two lead actors. And the chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker is phenomenal in the first entry of the ‘Rush Hour’ franchise. As per usual in Jackie Chan films, the plot is neither here nor there, but the comedy hits almost every time. Sometimes it tries a little too hard…but that can be forgiven. Continue reading →\n\nHow do you adapt a video game? Not like this, not like this at all! I’m convinced this was another movie script rewritten with Super Mario Bros references. What in the holy hell does this film have in common with the video game? Of course, it’s quite hard to adapt a game that was basically about running to the right and jumping on enemy’s heads. But how did the writers come up with this plot? Continue reading →\n\nThere aren’t many films in recent memory that jog from absurdity to absurdity (and take it in their stride) like Detective Pikachu. It tries to balance film noir with Pokémon to a confusing, yet sometimes enthralling, degree. The word-building is exceptional. The majority of the Pokémon are brought to life just as Pokelovers (myself included here!) would imagine, full of life and vitality. Rime City is a wonderfully constructed world, with more imagination and eye-popping visuals than most big budget blockbusters and muster up.\n\nBut eye candy is not enough to distract you from the increasingly silly plot, which flies off twists and turns every ten minutes or so. There’s at least two or three films’ worth of material here (much like Batman vs Superman, actually). Most thought-provoking material pops up for a few minutes, only to be relegated by the next ludicrous revelation. Not only that, but the human characters are so much more duller than the Pokémon. Worth watching for the visuals…but not much else.\n\nHammy’s Rating: 2/5\n\nMemorable Scene\n\nCOLOSSAL TORTERRA\n\nMemorable Quote\n\n‘There’s magic that brought us together, and that magic is hope’\n\nRelated Reviews\n\nQuick Review : Super Mario Bros (1993)\n\nThis is the first (and last, so far) union of Steven Spielberg and Philip K. Dick…so it begs the question…how does Spielberg match up against Ridley Scott and Paul Verhoeven? The answer is…very well! Scott went for the more slow-paced, meditative adaption, Verhoeven went for the action-packed and ultraviolent adaptation…and Spielberg hovers somewhere in between. Of course, there’s no ultraviolence here, as it’s a summer blockbuster…and being a summer blockbuster, Minority Report seems confined by delivering action set-pieces and philosophical musings about justice and morality.\n\nIt’s not an easy task, is it? Tom Cruise does fine as the main character, but just like Arnie in Total Recall, you can’t escape the fact that it’s Tom Cruise, running about doing Tom Cruise-esque things. Total Recall dove in head-first with the absurdity of having Arnie as the leading man in a philosophical story (by making it ultraviolent and full of one liners). Tom Cruise can’t help being Tom Cruise, regardless of his acting quality. Still, the story is strong enough and the philosophical musings profound enough to deliver an exciting thriller that delivers on the action set pieces.\n\nHowever, my major gripe about Minority Report is that it’s about twenty minutes too long. By the two hour mark, you feel that the credits should be rolling…but there’s another twenty minutes left!\n\nHammy’s Rating: 3/5\n\nMemorable Scene\n\nAnderton and Leo Crow\n\nMemorable Quote\n\n‘Science has stolen most of our miracles’\n\nRelated Reviews\n\nClick here for my Quick Review of Total Recall (1990)\n\nSo much for Arnie being the last action hero! While that film set out to parody the action genre, ‘True Lies’ manages to top Arnie’s previous film in terms of ridiculous (yet riotously entertaining) action scenes). How about having Arnie ride a horse whilst chasing a terrorist riding a motorbike? How about having Arnie flying a Harrier jet to rescue his daughter? Including an inherent absurdity in the action scenes enables ‘Last Action Hero’ to parody action films without being an explicit parody. Continue reading →\n\nWhat happens when you put one of the best action hero actors together with one of the best action directors to make an action movie parody? You get this decidedly uneven, absurd kind of film that tries to have its cake and eat it. Arnie stars as Jack Slater in the film within a film. But in the film, Jack Slater is played by the movie version of Arnie… Continue reading →\n\nWell, we’re back to LA for this threequel, along with the now well-worn story. The only thing that stands out is a hammy outing from Thomas Ian Griffin as Terry Silver, the big villain of the piece, the man behind Cobra Kai! Honestly, his performance is so scenery-chewing that sometimes you forget the overall stupidity of the plot. Silver, an evil millionaire, wants revenge on Daniel-San for his actions in the original. Continue reading →\n\nHow can I review a film I’ve loved since I was a child? Simple answer: not critically! In my humble opinion, ‘The Karate Kid’ is an almost flawless film. It tells a timeless story very well, helping along by a heart-warming relationship between the two leads of Daniel-San and Mr. Miyagi. Daniel-San is the ultimate under-dog (yes, even more so than Rocky Balboa!), a foreigner in a foreign land. Continue reading →"
