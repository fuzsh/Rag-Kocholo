British actors Bill Nighy and Chris Geere have joined the cast of Legendary's Detective Pikachu, a live-action movie adaptation of the popular Pokemon video game franchise. It wasn't revealed who the actors will be playing in the upcoming movie, but it's clear there will be no shortage of talent.

Nighy boasts an impressive resume, but is probably most well-known for his role as the iconic musician Billy Mack in Love Actually. Other notable credits of his include Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Hot Fuzz, ​ and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1. As for Chris Geere, he can currently be seen playing Jimmy Shive-Overly in the FXX series You're the Worst, which will be airing its fifth and final season this year.

The two actors join an already star-studded cast that includes Ryan Reynolds as the voice of Pikachu and The Get Down's Justice Smith as Tim Goodman, a teenager whose father is kidnapped. Based off of the Great Detective Pikachu video game (initially only released in Japan but coming to the West in March), Goodman and Pikachu team up alongside Lucy, a "sassy journalist" played by Kathryn Newton (Big Little Lies), to help find the boy's missing father.

Detective Pikachu is being helmed by Rob Letterman (Goosebumps) who also helped write the script with Nicole Perlman. The film is due out in theaters on May 10, 2019.
