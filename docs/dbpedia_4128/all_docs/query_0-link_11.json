I “made” a “book”’ prior to this, that 1 called Skyrim I. It consisted of creatures and enemies from Skyrim, with google pictures and pure transcript from Skyrim wikis. It was more or like a pre-project for this insane project. I made this book for myself and as a fan of the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was the first game system 1 owned and grew up with. I am not a professional designer and 1 suck in english. That is one important factor because 1 used the cheap cut and paste on much of the information in the book. That beeing said. I did my very best to make this book with respect and for the people. The book is free as a download and you can share the book if you want. If you buy the book in paper form, the only money you pay is what the cost 1s to sell it through lulu.com. (1 get 10cent or something, just cause’ lulu.com wont let me sell 1t without taking some form of money). The book also took longer than 1 expected. Way longer. I went way overboard with the pictures in the book. Probably nearly 10.000 pictures, if not more.

Nintendo Entertainment System This is a short wikipedia introduction for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Following a series of arcade game successes 1n the early 1980s, Nintendo made plans to create a cartridge- based console called the Famicom. Masayuki Uemura designed the system. Original plans called for an advanced 16-bit system which would function as a full-fledged computer with a keyboard and floppy disk drive, but Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi rejected this and instead decided to go for a cheaper, more conventional cartridge-based game console as he felt that features such as keyboards and disks were intimi- dating to non-technophiles. A test model was constructed in October 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware, after which work began on programming tools. Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time, no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch. Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an NEC PC-8001 computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time. The code name for the project was “GameCom”, but Masayuki Uemura’s wife proposed the name “Fami- com”, arguing that “In Japan, ‘pasokon’ is used to mean a personal computer, but it is neither a home or personal computer. Perhaps we could say it is a family compu- ter.” Meanwhile, Hiroshi Yamauchi decided that the console should use a red and white theme after seeing a billboard for DX Antenna which used those colors. Original plans called for the Famicom’s cartridges to be the size of a cassette tape, but ultimately they ended up being twice as big. Careful design attention was paid to the cartridge connectors since loose and faulty connections often plagued arcade machines. As it necessitated taking 60 connection lines for the memory and expansion, Nintendo decided to produce their own connectors in-house rather than use ones from an outside supplier. Uemura added an eject lever to the cartridge slot which was not really necessary, but he felt that children could be entertained by pressing it. He also added a microphone to the second controller with the idea that it could be used to make players’ voices sound through the TV speaker. The Famicom was slow to gather momentum; a bad chip set caused the initial release of the system to crash. Following a product recall and a reissue with a new motherboard, the Famicom’s popularity soared, becom- ing the best-selling game console in Japan by the end of 1984. Encouraged by these successes, Nintendo soon turned its attention to the North American market. Nintendo entered into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari’s name as the name Nintendo Ad- vanced Video Gaming System. The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer Consumer Elec- tronics Show in June 1983. However, Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its Coleco Adam computer with Nintendo’s Donkey Kong game. This violation of Atari’s exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementa- tion of Nintendo’s game console marketing contract with Atari. Atari’s CEO Ray Kassar was fired the next month, so the deal went nowhere, and Nintendo decided to market its system on its own. Subsequent plans to market a Famicom console in North America featuring a keyboard, cassette data re- corder, wireless joystick controller and a special BASIC cartridge under the name “Nintendo Advanced Video System” likewise never materialized. By the beginning of 1985, the Famicom had sold more than 2.5 million units in Japan and Nintendo soon announced plans to release it in North America as the Advanced Video Entertainment System that same year. The American video game press was skeptical that the console could have any success in the region, with the March 1985 issue of Electronic Games magazine stating that “the videogame market in America has virtually disappeared” and that “this could be a miscalculation on Nintendo’s part.” . ree |! At June 1985’s Consumer Electronics Show, Nin- tendo unveiled the American version of its Fami- com. This is the system which would eventually be officially deployed as the Nintendo Entertainment System, or the colloquial “NES”. Nintendo seeded these first systems to limited American test markets starting in New York City on October 18, 1985, following up with a full-fledged North American release of the console in February of the following year. Nintendo released 18 launch titles. Some varieties of these launch games contained Famicom chips with an adapter inside the cartridge so they would play on North American consoles, which is why the title screen of “Gyromite” has the Famicom title “Robot Gyro” and the title screen of “Stack-Up” has the Famicom title “Robot Block”. The system’s launch represented not only a new product, but also a reframing of the severely damaged home video game market segment as a whole. The video game market crash of 1983 had occurred in significant part due to a lack of consumer and retailer confidence in video games, which had in turn been due partially to confusion and misrepresentation in the marketing of video games. Prior to the NES, the packaging of many video games presented bombastic artwork which exaggerated the graphics of the actual game. In terms of product identity, a single game such as Pac-Man would appear in many versions on many different game consoles and computers, with large variations in graphics, sound, and general quality between the versions. By stark contrast, Nintendo’s marketing strategy aimed to regain consumer and retailer confidence, by deliv- ering a singular platform whose technology was not in need of heavy exaggeration and whose qualities were clearly defined. To differentiate Nintendo’s new home platform from the early 1980s’ common perception of a beleaguered and frivolous video game market, the company freshened its product nomenclature and positioning, and it established a rigorous product approval and licensing policy. The overall system was referred to as an “Entertainment System” instead of a “video game system”, which was centered upon a machine called a “Control Deck” instead of a “console’’, and which featured software cartridges called “Game Paks” instead of “video games”. The 1ONES lockout chip system acted as a lock-and-key coupling of each Game Pak and Control Deck, deterring the copying or production of NES games which had not first achieved Nintendo’s licensed approval. The packaging of the launch lineup of NES games bore pictures of a very close represen- tation of the actual onscreen graphics of the game, which were of sufficiently recognizable quality on their own. Symbols on the launch games’ packaging clearly indicated the genre of the game, in order to reduce consumer confusion. A ‘seal of quality’ was printed on all appropriately licensed game and accessory pack- aging. The initial seal stated, “This seal is your assurance that Nintendo has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product”. This text was later changed to “Official Nintendo Seal of Quality”. Unlike with the Famicom, Nintendo of America marketed the console primarily to children, instituting a rather strict policy of censoring profanity, sexual, religious, or political content in games. The most famous case of this was Lucasfilm’s attempts to port Maniac Mansion (a game with a considerable amount of un- acceptable material) to the NES. NOA continued their censorship policy until 1994 with the advent of the Entertainment Software Rating Board system. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licens- ing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo’s platform. In 2009, the Nintendo Entertainment System was named the single greatest video game console in history by IGN, out of a field of 25. It was the second greatest console behind only the Sega Dreamcast in PC maga- zines “Top 10 video game consoles of all time”’. 11, Qe 5 CONTENT 1.

Later you can make personal milestones for yourself. Region codes. But first you need to decide what region code you want to collect. Do you want your own region games, games that was realesed in your country? If you live abroad from the US, the NES games are often more ce, expensive. As for example in the scandinavian countries the games are aes qoe NES-NOE somethimes three times more expensive than in the US. But the library is much smaller in these contries as well. Childhood memories Do you only want to collect the games you played and grew up with? This is also a good starting point as many collectors start with the games they knew and played growing up. Pictures from the region code Complete or loose on the back of a NES. Do you want the games complete or loose? This is an important factor, for if you start with a bunch of loose and later decide to start collecting boxed, the box and manual are often as expensive or more than the game itself. So, it's best to buy the game complete, than starting to fill in the missing items of the games your already own. Unlicenced games PAL A and PAL B NES boxes. Do you want to collect the unlicenced games? This can be a very fun, but sometimes an expensive task. NES hardware. Do you want to collect NES hardware? Something 1 want to start collect- ing. It looks like alot of fun. You should have alot of space if you want to start a collection of NES hardware. 5S screw. When Nintendo started making games and sold the first wave of licenses to 3rd party companies, the gray carts themselves had 5 screws and a flat top. After a year, they found a more efficient way to make the games, and easier to get into with the notches on the top. So the original 5 screw carts are often much rarer, some of them significantly so. Personal Milestones. Personal milestones are a great and fun way to get a feeling of completion when you are collecting. A milestone can be e.g.: -All the Capcom, konami games. -All the small boxes, early black label games. -All games featuring Mario -All games from a specific year. Or just collecting a set of number. Like 222 games or somethig, 1 don't know. Find your a personal milestone that works for you. 6 2.4. Factory sealed. Collecting sealed games has become big in the collector scene. Often people buy the games they like sealed because of sentimental value, but get bit by the collection bug and soon sit with a big collection on their hands. Other collectors may buy sealed games because of the skyrocketing value and hope to get a profit. But whatever the motives are, sealed games collecting are a dangerous and difficult task for the uninformed person. Many people are trying to take advantage of others, and will do their best to trick them. Before you start buying sealed games, you should do a little homework on the stuff. Join a forum read some facts and get a little educated. The guide that follows, made from the nice ebay seller skcin08 does a good job of explaining many of the dangerous tell-tale of sealed collecting. “by: skcin0&@ebay.com”’ This guide will explain some methods to detect if a NES game 1s factory sealed or has been resealed. Games for other systems (Sega, Sony, other Nintendo systems) were sealed 1n all sorts of various ways, so please keep in mind this guide is for NES only. As many as 95% of NES games have a seam in the shrinkwrap that runs horizontally across the back of the box. The seam 1s often called the “H seam” or “Horizontal seam’. This seam ALWAYS starts exactly half- way down the box. A box is 7 inches (17.8 cm) high, so the seam should start 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) down both sides of the box. If a game is missing this horizontal seam, it is not necessarily resealed. Many games released by LJN/Acclaim were sealed with a vertical overlapping seam. The licensed versions of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man released by Namco do not have any seam on the back. In addition, all unlicensed games were sealed in various different ways. If you have a licensed game that does not feature this horizontal seam, it could be resealed. Recently, resealers have started faking this seam, though it is hard to make a convincing fake. Check the spot where the “H seam” comes perpindicular with the vertical part of the seam. If the game is a legitimate factory seal, the seam usually slightly bends to the side and slightly overlaps itself. If the game has been resealed, chances are 1t was resealed with cheap equipment and will just come straight down making a perfect 90 degree angle. The horizontal seam on the Burgertime meets perpendicular with the vertical part making a 90 degree angle, because it has been resealed. However, on the Dr. Chaos below, the shrinkwrap slightly overlaps itself, because this game is a legitimately factory sealed. The only way to tell for sure if a game has been resealed with 100% accuracy, 1s to check the “hinge” part of the top flap. As soon as the top flap has been opened for the first time, a white line will form at the hinge area, which is especially easy to notice on darker boxed games. This white line 1s difficult to see in white boxed games such as Anticipation, but for a darker boxed game such as Dragon Warrior IV, it 1s especially easy to notice. When the top flap opens and closes, wear and tear will start to accumulate around the hinge area. The more often a game box is opened and closed, the more wear and tear will start to accumulate around the hinge area. Sometimes reseal- ers will take magic marker and color over the white line, making it harder to notice. Be sure to check closely under a bright light to look for slight discolorations and wear to make sure the white line hasn’t been colored over. The picture of 1942 has wear around the hinges on the top flap and is a reseal. 2.4. QT 17 Check the hang tab. The hangtab used to hang most NES games is a “D” style hang tab, measuring 2 inches wide and 1.75 inches high. Often times the part of the hang tab that is stuck to the shrink wrap is slightly discolored, yet oddly enough, the rest of the tab is usually still clear. This is because of the type of the plastic used and the age. If a game has a hang tab with these properties, it is likely legit. Sometimes the hang tabs fell off the games, or in some cases retailers applied their own different style hang tab, so it is important to know that the absence of a hang tab or a different style tab does not mean the game 1s a reseal. If the game is resealed the seller may know that it has been resealed, but don’t send him rude emails because he may not know they are resealed either. Often times, if a retailer in the early 90s had a game returned to them, they would simply reseal it and sell them as new. This 1s called a “vintage reseal”, and sometimes people resort to eBay simply to sell their old store stock and do not know their games are resealed. Always look out for the phrase “factory sealed’. Some dishonest sellers will simply say “sealed” in which case they would not be lying. Furthermore, sometimes if a seller 1s knowingly selling reseals, he will purposely post low-quality photos, or photos of weird angles of the game, so that you can’t easily tell that it’s been resealed. If you have any doubts, email the seller first. Their response usually says a lot about their credibility and character. If they give you a bad vibe, it is best to proceed with caution or stay away entirely. Price tags. Some legitimate factory sealed games have price tags on them, but resealers sometimes will add their own price tags onto the shrinkwrap. If the price tag looks old and discolored due to age, chances are it is a legit factory sealed game. Also, where is the price tag from? Generic white price guns can be purchased on eBay for around $15 shipped, but price tags from major retailers are not easy, and generally not worth the time, to reproduce. If a game has a price tag from a major retailer such as Toys R Us, Wal-Mart, K-Mart, etc., it is likely factory sealed. Check the seller’s feedback. Do they seem honest and legitimate? If they have 100s of positive feedback, they are likely not pulling a scam, but don’t let that mislead you. If they have any negative feedbacks, check them. Ifa negative feedback says something about resealing games, you should proceed with caution or not proceed at all. I hope this is common sense. If you have received a game that is a reseal, email the seller immediately and request a refund. Once again, the sellers response will say a lot about his character. If he will not allow you a refund, you can file a dispute with Paypal (if you paid with Paypal) as long as you file it within 45 days of the paypal payment. You will be required to send the item back and you will be responsible for return shipping charges. Make sure you purchase Delivery Confirmation to prove that you sent the item back, or Signature Confirmation if the origi- nal Paypal payment was $250 or more. I would not recommend leaving negative feedback unless the seller gives you a hard time and you are fairly certain he knew it was resealed when he sold it. One last thing I’d like to say is simply to use common sense. If something seems suspicious, proceed with caution. Don’t be afraid to bombard the seller with questions and request more photographs if unsure about the ones provided. Be smart about what you purchase. If you want to start a sealed collection or just curious, you should join one or both of these forums. They look like they have their shit together. sealedgameheaven.com The forum has game sale & trade boards, a sealed game databases from every console with information on seal types, styles & variants for both NTSC and PAL. Confirmation & evidence in relation to factory seals & reseals and what a game is worth. sealedvideogames.net The web-site has a blog about sealed videogames with rare and obscure listing posted all the time. A forum with community of many experienced collectors, sealed guides for every system for newbie collector to read, learn and discuss and an extensive database of sealed prices, based on confirmed actual sales. 8 2-4. Prototypes. A prototype is a version of a game from its development phase (typically an alpha or beta version) which was typically not meant to be released. Contrary to common internet belief, prototypes are often not a “beta”; beta versions are when the game 1s mostly complete, but is lacking the finishing polish (unfixed bugs or glitches, unpolished translation, etc.). In this way, most prototypes released are alpha or pre-alpha versions, when the game is still under active devel- opment and several features are not finalized. Prototypes usually end up on the internet by game testers, reviewers, or developers either directly by using a backup device, or indirectly by giving such test cartridges to friends where they eventually end up on eBay or simply dumped online. In some rare instances, prototypes end up being sold by pirates who mask it as the final version. Prototypes are very interesting because they often feature lots of content that was changed or removed in the final version without any trace. In many cases, they also feature debug modes of some kind. “terf.net” Games and equipment may become collectible by virtue of its unavailability. This includes games available only in prototype form, which may have left the company because of liquidation, theft, journalistic review, or other cause. Games that were not released to the public are still of interest to the gaming community, as their software can be copied and distributed over the Internet. Prototypes tend to decrease in value when their ROM is released publicly. Because these titles are not supposed to leave their respective companies, they can also be considered black market collectibles. Like sealed games, collecting prototypes can be a challenge, as people are making fakes to sell. It is possible to An EPROMs programmer and burn another game rom onto a regular cart, messing with the cart label and selling it as a prototype without much hassle. by: “nintendoplayer.com” The plastic Nintendo cartridges act like protective shells for the circuit boards inside. These circuit boards are called PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards). The data found inside of the majority of prototype carts is stored on memory chips on the PCB called EPROMs. “EPROM” stands for Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory. Game data found inside of nearly all regular, officially licensed Nintendo carts is stored not on EPROMs, but rather on memory chips on the PCB called Mask ROMs (or MROMs). “MROM” stands for Mask Read Only Memory. Unlike permanent MROMs, EPROMs were never meant to last for a very long time. They were temporary solutions for testing games or flashing them quickly to ship them out to gaming publications for previews and reviews before the mass-produced carts were manu- factured. To prevent the game data from erasing, EPROMs on prototypes are often covered with an adhesive sticker to help block out UV light. A sure way of visually differentiating an EPROM from an MROM is by seeing if there is a small square in the middle of the chip like the one on the right. This is called an EPROM window, and it’s made of quartz crystal that makes it reflective like a hologram. Exposing this window over time to a certain amount of UV light will gradually erase the game data stored on an EPROM. EPROM window 2.4. 19 EPROMSs can also be erased over several years without any direct exposure to UV light. Just how long it takes for the data to erase under normal temperate conditions, without sunlight or other UV light to progress the erasure, 1s unsure. The slow erasing of data without exposing the EPROM to UV light is what as known as bit rot. EPROMsS are not unique to prototypes alone; they can be found on some other games, as well. Several pirated and unlicensed games, like all three of the Panesian pornographic titles, use EPROMs. (This means that, one day, Panesian collectors will be left with nothing but their own self shame.) Test carts are examples of official, non-prototype Nintendo games using EPROMs. These were cartridges given to Nintendo Service Centers to help diagnose console and accessory problems. In rare cases, there have even been reports of EPROMs being spotted in some officially licensed and re- leased Nintendo carts. Nintendo compiled a list of all officially licensed NES titles, complete with release dates. Many prototypes are dated either on the label or on the inside. The further away the date is on the prototype from the release, the better your chances are of finding differences. Prototypes dated a month or two before release are most likely review copies sent to gaming publications and will be close to (if not identical) to the released game (although there could be a debug menu, invincibility, or level select capabilities). For the online market pricing of released game prototypes, those for the NES usually cost more than any other system. For prototypes of terrible games (i.e. Total Recall terrible), the price may be as low as $50. Prototypes of average, run-of-the-mill games generally go for between $75-$150. For prototypes of more popular or rarer games, prices vary at $150-$250+. Major first party Nin- tendo games can reach prices much higher. Like one of the the Legend of Zelda prototype, that came in a shock yellow game cart. According to the internet, the prototype sold on ebay for $55,000. Seeing an NES-TKEPROM board is very good confirmation of a proto- type’s authenticity as these type of boards are found only in prototypes. The majority of prototypes have one or two EPROMs (or sometimes more like, for example, one known prototype of The Legend of Zelda). These EPROMs require a special EPROM board for them to work. You cannot use EPROMs on a regular production board (at least, not with- out additional modification). -—-—--——=— = Se Se ee Official Nintendo TKEPROM Prototype Board with Official Nintendo Prototype Stickers You would be hard pressed to find any more proof of legitimacy than with an official Nintendo prototype label on a cartridge holding an official Nintendo prototype board with official Nintendo prototype EPROM stickers inside. Another common standard prototype label you might see is one that’s white (or discolored yellow by age) and reads “*USA VERSION* (FINAL/NTSC)” on the front label. NES-TKEPROM boards are not the only official Nintendo prototype PCBs. NES-UNEPROM PCB is an- other board found only in prototypes and is also a good way of authenticating a prototype. Prototypes in the NTSC format are most sought after, while those in the PAL format generally do not go for as much money. Reasens may be that most prototype collectors are located in the US and that NES games were sometimes released in North America months (or even years) 1n advance of the European release, thereby making differences in PAL format prototypes from the final games harder to come by. Prototypes will often have their cartridges cut out so you can see the PCBs inside. This was done mostly for EPROM that were socketed because the use of sockets can raise them up, making it difficult to close the cartridge. (Also, the cutting away of plastic allowed developers easy access to the EPROMs inside instead of having to unscrew the cart every time from the back.) Not all prototypes use special prototype boards like NES-TKEPROM or NES-UNEPROM. In some exam- ples, prototypes can come on regular PCBs without any modifications and without any EPROMs (this in- cludes prototypes of both released and unreleased games). This kind is the most problematic to try to authen- ticate because when you compare, say, the prototype PCB of a prototype with a copy of the same released PCB game, there’s really no visual difference between the two. Many prototypes have company-specific labels, here is a list of some examples to be on the look out for: °Acclaim Return To: Prototype °Activision Prototype Capcom Pre-Release Prototype (Back Label) Prototype (Front Label) ¢Hudson Soft Prototype LIN Preproduction Sample Sample Game Pak ti «Nintendo © ROMAN — USA Version ROM (FINAL/NTSC) ee “RARE a MPL E CES (Consumer Electronic Show) Test Sample *SUNSOFT Sample elaito Prototype elengen Unreleased Prototype (1) Unreleased Prototype (2) ¢Ultra/Konami Sample (NTSC) Sample (PAL) The biggest problem about collecting prototypes however, beyond the possibilities of fakes, are bit rot. It is real and something to certainly be concerned about. EPROMsSs are said to have a guaranteed minimum of ten years life. That’s a given. The survival rate after that can range from another ten to fifteen years and even longer. The problem is you’ll never know until bit rot occurs. There are no warning signs.

Collecting NES games on ep'yY for beginners by: “unknown@ebay.com” Collecting Nintendo Entertainment System games seems to be quite popular on ebay, whether it be from the nostalgia of their days of a children, or the value of such mere carts. At any given time, it 1s pretty easy to find the games you want, however, there are trends you must watch and tips on how to find deals and when to not bid. The first thing you must know is when to buy a game, and when not to buy a game as well as what games to buy. The first tip you need to know 1s to effectively utilize the “search title and description” feature, as it could save you tons of money. The first tip when starting your collection is BUY IN LOTS. Although the intial investment will be high, you will be saving money in the long term. Would you rather buy 100 games all at once for $200 with $30 or so shipping, or would you rather pick out 100 titles one-by-one paying an average of $3 to $4 per game and $6 to $7 per game afterwards? not to mention the hassle of dealing with hundreds of sellers rather than one? When the average ebayer is looking for a game, he or she only searches the title feature, but the key is to use “search title and description’. Often there will be times where the seller of the games won’t know what he has, or has failed to properly research their value and they will just clump a good game in a pile of bad games without thinking anything of it. Another tip is to search for misspellings of game titles - although rare, it could be possible a valuable game could slip through the cracks this way. Example: typing “Flinstones” 1n the search title and description instead of “Flintstones” , or “Casltevania” instead of “Castlevania” or “six” instead of “6” Sometimes there are “spikes” in a game price that you should avoid. Example: Flintstones IJ: Surprise at Dinosaur Peak gets overbid, and the price soars to $150 when it nor- mally costs $100. You should wait a few days to see how many other copies are placed on ebay within the next two weeks, because people are more tempted to sell their item when they can get the most out of it. The best bet 1s to check “Completed” auctions to see what the normal price over the last 30 days for the game is, however, some games only come on ebay once or twice every few months, and the earliest to get them 1s the best time. Examples: Panesian’s Bubble Bath Babes, Bandai’s Stadium Events, Myriad 6-1n-1 Collecting is a slow, painful process that doesn’t just happen in one day..or even one year (unless, of course, you’re bill gates) so the key point is the be patient. NES REGION CODES Nintendo was the first console maker to introduce regional locks to its consoles. Games for the Nintendo Entertainment System were locked through both physical and technical means. The NES also contained the LONES authentication chip; the chip was coded for one of three regions: NTSC (North America) PAL-A (United Kingdom and Italy) PAL-B (other European countries) A game’s region 1s recognized by the console using the LONES chip. If the chip inside the cartridge con- flicts with the chip inside the console, the game will not boot. The 1ONES chip also doubled as a form of DRM to prevent unlicensed or bootleg games to play on the NES.

As of December 31, 2013, Nintendo has sold over 669.36 million hardware units and 4.20 billion software units. Nintendo of America is also the majority owner of the Seattle Mariners Ma- jor League Baseball team. The exterior of Nintendo’s main The name Nintendo can be roughly translated from Japanese to English as headquarters in Kyoto, Japan “leave luck to heaven.” The Nintendo Entertainment System home video game console was launched in 1983 in Japan as Fam- ily Computer (abbreviated Famicom in Japan and NES in the rest of the world) alongside ports of its most popular arcade titles. In 1985, the NES launched in North America, and was accompanied by Super Mario Bros., one of the best-selling video games of all time. Nintendo Research & Development 1 R&D1 was Nintendo’s oldest development team. Its creation coincided with Nintendo’s entry into Successor Nintendo SPD the video games industry, and the original R&D 1 Founded 1970 was headed by Gunpei Yokoi. The developer has Headquarter Japan created several notable Nintendo series such as Employees 100+ Metroid, Ice Climber, Kid Icarus, and Wario Land. Nintendo R&D1 established a close relationship with hardware developer Intelligent Systems, and initially worked together on a couple of projects. There was previous misconception that Nintendo R&D1 members left to work at Intelligent Systems, but that is false. The development team has gradually been reduced with a couple of senior members retiring or joining other Nintendo affiliated companies like Creatures, most nota- bly Hirokazu Tanaka and Hirofumi Matsuoka. R&D1 developed the hugely successful Game Boy line, which was released in 1989. They developed some of the line’s most popular games, such as Super Mario Land, and created the character of Wario. Team Shikamaru was a small club within Nintendo R&D1 that was composed of Makoto Kano, Yoshio Sakamoto, and Toru Osawa. The group was responsible for designing characters and coming up with scripts for several games including Metroid, Kid Icarus, Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Kokeisha, Trade & Battle: Card Hero, and several others. 24 —_—_—_* 3.1. R&D2 was a team within Nintendo that developed Nintendo software and peripherals. R&D2 ported several of Research & Development M the Nintendo R&D1 and Nintendo R&D3 games over to the Famicom in the early 1980s. While Successor Nintendo Entertainment usually occupied in system operating software and Analysis and Development technical support, the team would come back to Founded |e early development in the 1990s where several new Headquarter Japan designers got their start at game development, the most famous being E1ji Aonuma who developed Marvelous: Treasure Island.

Absolute Entertainment was an American video Successor Skyworks Technologies game publishing company. Through its develop- Founded 1986 ment house, Imagineering, Absolute Entertainment | Founder Garry Kitchen produced titles for the Amiga, Atari, Sega Mega Defunct ees Drive and NES among others, as well as for the Headquarter Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, PC. United States After leaving his position as a video game developer and designer at Activision, Garry Kitchen founded the company in 1986 with his brother Dan Kitchen, along with David Crane, Alex Demeo, John Van Ryzin. The company’s headquarters was in Glen Rock, New Jersey, but later moved to another New Jersey bor- ough, Upper Saddle River. While the company was based in New Jersey, David Crane worked out of his home on the West Coast. The company’s name was chosen because it was alphabetically above Activision, implying that Absolute Entertainment was superior to Activision . It was the same strategy that Activision chose when the programmers left Atari. At Absolute Entertainment, Kitchen continued developing games for the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800, as he had done at Activision. However, the Nintendo Entertainment System had already displaced Atari’s domi- nance of the video game console market. Kitchen swiftly shifted his focus to the NES, and produced several landmark titles for the platform, beginning with A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia in 1989, and Battle Tank in 1990. Absolute Entertainment published at least 30 titles before dwindling sales from dimin- ishing product quality prompted Kitchen to shutter the company in 1995. Since Kitchen had already formed anew company with David Crane called Skyworks Technologies, some of the employees transitioned to the new company. Acclaim Entertainment Successor Acclaim Games Founded 1987 Founder Greg Fischbach Defunct 2004 Headquarter Glen Cove, New York, U.S. Website Acclaim.com Acclaim Entertainment was an American video game developer and publisher. It developed, published, marketed and distributed interactive entertainment software for a variety of hardware platforms. The name of the company was picked because it had to be alphabetically above the co-founder’s former place of employment, Activision, and also had to be alphabetically above Accolade (another company formed by ex-Activision employees). This was a common formula for picking names of new companies that were founded by ex-Activision employees (the founders of Activision used this formula when they left Atar1). After Acclaim Entertainment’s 2004 demise, the Acclaim brand and logotype were purchased by the unre- lated company Acclaim Games (defunct from August 26, 2010). Canadian video game publisher Throwback Entertainment acquired more than 150 titles from Acclaim’s video game library. In July 2010, We Go Inter- active Co., Ltd., based in Seoul, Korea, purchased all IP related with Re-Volt, RC Revenge Pro, RC De GO from Throwback Entertainment. During Acclaim’s decline towards bankruptcy, an executive Steve Perry, made several controversial business and marketing decisions. One example was a promise that a USD $10,000 (£5000) prize would be awarded to UK parents who would name their baby “Turok”, to promote the release of Turok: Evolution. Another was an attempt to buy advertising space on actual tombstones for a Shadowman game. 26 —_—_———_—_—_—_—_———-—-——-----~X—_—X—X—_—————_———_—_—_—_—_——_————————————--~7~*~*~*s 3.5. Activision ACTIVISION Type Subsidiary of Activision Blizzard Activision Publishing, Inc. is an American video Founder Greg Fischbach game publisher. It was the world’s first independ- ent developer and distributor of video games for gaming consoles. Its first products were cartridges on for the Atari 2600 video console system published Website Activision.com from July 1980 for the US market. Headquarter Santa Monica, California, United States Employees 6700 Before Activision, third-party developers did not exist. Software for video game consoles were published exclusively by makers of the systems for which the games were designed. For example, Atari was the only publisher of games for the Atari 2600. This was particularly galling to the developers of the games, as they received no financial rewards for games that sold well, and did not receive credit for their games. Atari programmers David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller, and Bob Whitehead met with Atari CEO Ray Kassar in May 1979 to demand that the company treat developers as record labels treated musicians, with royalties and their names on game boxes. Kaplan, who called the others “the best designers for the [2600] in the world’, recalled that Kassar called the four men “towel designers” and that “anyone can do a cartridge.” Crane, Miller, and Whitehead left Atari and founded Activision in October 1979 with former music industry executive Jim Levy and venture capitalist Richard Muchmore; Kaplan soon joined the company. The name “Activision” was decided upon so that the company would appear before Atari in the phone book. In December 2007, 1t was announced that Activision would merge with Vivendi Games, which owned fellow games developer and publisher Blizzard, and the merger would close in July 2008. The new company was called Activision Blizzard and is headed by Activision’s former CEO, Robert Kotick. The new company is estimated to be worth US$18.9 billion, ahead of Electronic Arts, which is valued at US$14.1 billion. ATLUS K.K. Atlus K.K.

Jack Bros. for the Virtual Boy, Revelations: Persona for the PlayStation, and Revelations: The Demon Slayer for the Game Boy Color were the first three games in the series to have a North American release, all in the 1990s. The American release of Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne in 2004 was the first main series video game to have an American release. Since then, the majority of the series has had an American release in addition to the Japanese, including Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3, Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army, and Shin Megami Tense: Strange Journey. Atlus USA also has published games under the loose moniker Marl Kingdom, beginning with the relatively unheard of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure, in 2000. 3.8. | Bandai Company, Limited Type Subsidiary of Namco Bandai Successor Namco Bandai Games Founded 1950 Headquarter Taito, Tokyo, Japan Website Bandai Japan Bandai US Bandai Company, Limited 1s a Japanese toy making and video game company, as well as the producer of a large number of plastic model kits. It 1s the world’s third-largest producer of toys (after Mattel and Hasbro). Some ex-Bandai group companies produce anime and tokusatsu programs. Bandai was founded in 1950. In the 1960s Bandai expanded to include export sales. Bandai’s racing car set, which first appeared in 1962, became a huge success. The 1970s continued to see Bandai expand, with Bandai Models being established in 1971. Although not their most profitable range, Bandai’s 1/48 scale AFV models dominated that segment of the model kit market. Bandai America Inc. was established as local US sales/marketing operation in 1978. Since the 1980s, Bandai has become the leading toy company of Japan, and to this day, has the main toy licenses in Japan to popular properties including Daikaiju, Ultraman, Super Robot, Kamen Rider, the Super Sentai and Power Rangers series (which they took part in creating), Gundam and many others. The management of Bandai and Sega discussed a merger in the late 1990s, but the merger was later can- celled, citing “cultural differences”’. During the late 1970s, Bandai sold the TV Jack console line: a series of pong based consoles. The last of the series was the Bandai Super Vision 8000 console released in 1979. It wasn’t a simple pong based console system but a cartridge system with an 8-bit NEC D780C (Z80 clone) as CPU. “S” Broderbund Broderbund Software, Inc.

Brederbund was purchased by Website broderbund.com The Learning Company in 1998. Broderbund was founded by brothers Doug and Gary Carlston in 1980 for the purpose of marketing Galac- tic Empire, a video game that Doug Carlston had created in 1979. Their sister, Cathy, joined the company a year later. Before founding the company, Doug was a lawyer and Gary had held a number of jobs, including teaching Swedish at an American college. Galactic Empire had many names taken from African languages; a group of merchants was named Broederbond, Afrikaans for “association of brothers’. To emphasize its fam- ily origin while avoiding a connection with the white-supremacist South African organization of the same name, the Carlstons altered the spelling when naming their company “Broderbund”. For a brief time, Brederbund was involved in the video game console market when it published a few games for the NES through its New Ventures Division. All of Broderbund’s games for the NES, including the port of its own franchises Lode Runner, Spelunker and Raid on Bungeling Bay, were developed by third-party Japanese companies. Brederbund published some titles that were produced by companies that didn’t have a North American subsidiary, such as Compile’s The Guardian Legend, Imagineer’s The Battle of Olympus, and Legacy of the Wizard, the fourth installment in Nihon Falcom’s Dragon Slayer series. Broderbund also developed and marketed an ill-fated motion sensitive NES controller device called the U-Force, which was operated without direct physical contact between the player and the device. 28 ———————————E—EOEOEOEOE—_—_—OO— 3.9.

Website capcom.com The original companies that spawned Capcom’s Japanese branch were I.R.M Corporation founded on May 30, 1979, as well as its subsidiary Japan Capsule Computers Co., Ltd., both of which were devoted to the manufacturing and distribution of electronic game machines. The two companies underwent a name change to Sambi Co., Ltd. in September 1981, while Capcom Co., Ltd. itself was first established on June 11, 1983, for the purpose of taking over the internal sales department. In January 1989, the old affiliate company Capcom Co., Ltd. merged with Sambi Co., Ltd., resulting in the current Japanese branch. The name Capcom 1s a portmanteau of “Capsule Computers’, a term coined by the company to describe the arcade machines it solely manufactured in its early years, designed to set them- selves apart from personal computers that were becoming widespread at that time. The word capsule alludes to how Capcom likened its game software to “a capsule packed to the brim with gaming fun’’, as well as to the company’s desire to protect its intellectual property with a hard outer shell, preventing illegal copies and inferior imitations. In recent years, Capcom has been criticized for controversial sales tactics, such as having to pay for addi- tional content which is already available within the game’s files, most notably in Street Fighter X Tekken. Capcom has defended the practice. Enix Corporation Successor Square Enix Founded 1975 Defunct 2003 Headquarter Tokyo, Japan Enix Corporation was a Japanese company that produced video games, anime and manga. The company was founded by Yasuhiro Fukushima as Eidansha Boshu Service Center and renamed Enix in 1982. Enix is perhaps best known for publishing the Dragon Quest series. Enix was founded by Japanese architect-turned-entrepreneur Yasuhiro Fukushima. The company initially published tabloids that advertised real estate. After a failed attempt to go nationwide in 1982, the newly renamed Enix began its foray into the gaming market by holding a personal computer game programming contest. One of the winners was the puzzle game Door Door by Koichi Nakamura, which would become one of the company’s better known home computer titles. The game was subsequently ported to the Nintendo Family Computer, but never saw any form of release outside of Japan. Nakamura would stay on board as one Enix’s key programmers. From 1983 to 1993, Enix published games for Japanese home computers including the NEC PC-8801, MSX, Sharp X68000, and FM-7. Beginning on the Famicom, Enix published the very successful Dragon Quest series, which, after the formation of Square Enix, had already sold over 35 million copies worldwide. Although the first few titles were developed by Chunsoft, other companies would also develop main install- ments, spin-offs, and remakes for the series including Heartbeat, ArtePiazza, and TOSE. The Dragon Quest franchise would carry over as one of Square Enix’s most important assets. Other notable franchises pub- lished by Enix include the acclaimed Star Ocean and Valkyrie Profile series by tri-Ace, both of which would also continue with Square Enix. 3.12. eeCOTee—s—‘<s~;S;72S SSS 29 GameTek was a video game publisher based in Successor —_ Take 2 Interactive North Miami Beach, Florida well known for pub- Defunct 1998 lishing video game adaptations of game shows in Headquarter North Miami Beach, Florida the early 1990s.

After establishing distribution for the game show titles, GameTek branched out by licensing European titles for the North American market, including Frontier: Elite II and The Humans. GameTek filed for bankruptcy in 1997 and closed in July 1998. Some of the company’s assets were acquired by Take 2 Interactive in 1997. HAL Laboratory, Inc.

Hudson Soft ceased to exist as a company on March 1, 2012 and was merged with Konami Digital Enter- tainment. Products and services will continue to be provided under the Hudson brand through Konami. The relation between Hudson Soft and Konami can be traced back as early as 1985, when Hudson ported Konami’s arcade game Pooyan to the Famicom. Moreover, Konami was a third party publisher for Hudson Soft’s PC Engine in Japan. But the acquisition process of Hudson Soft by Konami would only begin in 2001. Hudson had a long history of creating games for other publishers. The most notable of these were the Mario Party series, created for Nintendo. They developed the first eight console installments; however, Mario Party 9 was developed by Nintendo subsidiary Nd Cube, which consists of many former Hudson employees. ijn.

Lewis initially backed the company financially, but later sold his interest to a Chinese investor. In 1985, MCA, which had been actively acquiring companies 1n the mid-1980s, acquired LJN for around $67 million in an effort to retain more profits from the merchandising of its film properties. In 1989, MCA decided to sell LJN after years of losses Many of LJN’s titles (particularly the pre-Acclaim ones) did not disclose the developer, there is no video game that has been developed in-house by LJN. All of LJN’s video games were developed by external de- velopers. Most games made by LJN were movie tie-ins or based on an existing brand. Many of these games were not received very well and the LJN name holds a reputation as one of the least-acclaimed game pub- lishers of the pre-2000’s. The games spanned over a number of console generations. 3.17. i 3] Konami Corporation Haundc desloge af .

Konami is the fifth-largest gaming company in the world by revenue. Konami is also known for its password, the Konami Code, which traditionally gives many power-ups in its games. Although variants also exist, as in the Parodius series, and button naming can differ depending on the controller used, the classic Famicom or NES combination is: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A. Although use of this code in more recent Konami productions has been sparse.

One of the most recognizable features of Ocean games on the Commodore 64 was the Ocean Loader. Since this computer used cassettes as storage, loading a game could take several minutes. Ocean used a special loading system that displayed a picture based on the game and played music while the game was loading. The Ocean loader music is still popular by fans of chiptunes. Ocean was famous for often buying the rights to make video games from different arcade, movie and televi- sion franchises. Many license games combined several styles for example featuring platform action and car driving. The most well received license games by Ocean were RoboCop (1988), Batman The Movie (1989) and Robocop 3 (1992), which featured 3D graphics in 16-bit versions. Also the adventure game, Hook (1992) got positive reviews. The 1986 game Batman got a rating of 93% in Crash magazine. 40 re ee 3.18. Square Company, Limited Successor Square Enix Founded 1986 Founder Masashi Miyamoto Defunct 2003 Headquarter Tokyo, Japan The Square Company, Limited was a Japanese video game company. It merged with Enix in 2003 and became part of Square Enix. The company sometimes used Squaresoft as a brand name to refer to their games, and the term 1s occasionally used to refer to the company itself. Square was founded in Yokohama by Masashi Miyamoto after he graduated from Waseda, one of Japan’s top universities. Back then, Square was a computer game software division of Den-Yu-Sha, a power line con- struction company owned by Miyamoto’s father. While at the time game development was usually conduct- ed by only one programmer, Miyamoto believed that 1t would be more efficient to have graphic designers, programmers and professional story writers working together on common projects. Square’s first two titles were The Death Trap and its sequel Will: The Death Trap I, both designed by part-time employee Hironobu Sakaguchi and released on the NEC PC-8801. Square has also made other widely known games such as Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, Secret of Mana, Legend of Mana, Xenogears, Brave Fencer Musashi, Parasite Eve, Parasite Eve 2, Saga Frontier, Romanc- ing Saga, Vagrant Story, Kingdom Hearts, and Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars (done under the guidance of Shigeru Miyamoto). A merger between Square and its competitor Enix was in consideration since at least 2000; however, the financial failure of the movie Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within made Enix hesitant to join with a company which was losing money.

Sunsoft’s history in video games began in arcades with two video games released in 1978: Block Challenger and Block Perfect. They later had several arcade hits in the early 1980s such as Arabian, Ikki and Kangaroo. In the latter half of the 1980s Sunsoft began developing original games and technology for the home video game console market, with emphasis mostly on the NES. Sunsoft had gone international at that time, and it had the publishing might to secure major licenses of the day (such as Batman and The Addams Family). Outside Japan, the definite golden era for the company was the 8-bit NES, on which their games were wide- ly considered state of the art in graphical and aural prowess. Sunsoft was slow to transition to 16-bit con- soles, however, releasing several NES and Famicom titles that went unnoticed at launch, and have only been rediscovered by enthusiasts recently, such as: Ufouria (Hebereke), Mr. Gimmick (Gimmick!), and Journey to Silius (Raf World). Additionally, a number of Sega games, including Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone II and After Burner, have been ported for Nintendo consoles by Sunsoft. The games Sunsoft produced in the 16-bit era were no longer as polished or cutting-edge, the licenses were less prominent, and no new hit games ap- peared. Finally, in 1995, they heavily restructured in the face of bankruptcy, eventually resurfacing with a scant number of video games for the PlayStation such as Monster Seed and games for the Game Boy Color. 3.21. 33 TAITO Taito Corporation The Taito Corporation is a Japanese publisher of Founded 1953 video game software and arcade hardware and as Founder Michael Kogan of 2005, wholly owned by publisher Square Enix.

The company was founded in 1953 by a Russian Jewish businessman named Michael Kogan as Taito Trad- ing Company. Taito started out importing and distributing vending machines. Later, they began leasing jukeboxes and they eventually started to manufacture their own. They eventually began producing electro- mechanical arcade games in the 1960s. Taito introduced their first video arcade game in 1973. It was also this year that they changed their name from Taito Trading Company to Taito Corporation. In 1978 Toshihiro Nishikado, a designer at Taito, created Space Invaders which became the company’s most popular title ever and one of the most memorable games in arcade history, responsible for beginning the golden age of arcade video games. The game was published in the US by Midway. Due to the huge success of Space Invaders, Taito opened in 1979 an American division called Taito America Corporation in order to release games in North America.

A month later, on April 1981, Tehkan released in Japan its first arcade video game titled Pleiads (which was distributed in America by Centuri). When it was still called Tehkan, the company released arcade games such as Bomb Jack and Tehkan World Cup. On January 8, 1986, Tehkan officially changed its name to Tecmo Co, Ltd. On the 3 June 2008 Team Ninja head Tomonobu Itagaki resigned from the company and filed a 145 million yen ($1.3 million) lawsuit for “unpaid completion bonuses” and “emotional distress”. This was followed by another lawsuit filed on the 16th of June by two plaintiffs on behalf of Tecmo’s 300 employees for unpaid wages amounting to ¥8.3 million. On August 29, 2008 Square Enix made plans for a friendly takeover of Tecmo by purchasing shares at a 30 percent premium with a total bid of ¥22.3 billion. On September 4, 2008 Tecmo officially declined the takeover proposal. 34 S22: viTRA’ | PALCOM Ultra Software Corporation Former type Shell subsidiary of Konami Founded 1988 Defunct ee Headquarter Buffalo Grove, IL, USA Parent Konami Ultra Software Corporation was a shell corporation and publishing label created in 1988 as a sub- sidiary of Konami of America, in an effort to get around Nintendo of America’s strict licensing rules for the North American Konami release games for Nintendo consoles. One of these rules was that a third-party company could only publish up to five games per year for the NES in the US. This was hardly convenient for Konami, which had begun releasing more than ten games a year for both the Family Computer and Family Computer Disk System in Japan. With a greater library than they were allowed to localize, Konami formed the Ultra Games brand to extend their annual library to ten games a year. Ultra’s first game was the NES version of Metal Gear. At first, Ultra was dedicated to localizing Konami’s pre-existing software from Japan, but later they began publishing works from other companies as well. Some of Konami’s most notable games released under the Ultra label include Operation C (an original Game Boy installment of the Contra series), Snake’s Revenge and the first few Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games for the NES and Game Boy. After the North American launch of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo became less strict on the number of games third-parties could publish. As a result, Ultra Games began losing its purpose and Konami shortly dropped the label in 1992. In Europe, Konami established the Palcom Software Limited subsidiary for similar purposes.

It helped the career of many developers, including Westwood Studios (who developed Command & Con- quer Series and the PC port of Resident Evil) and Synergistic. Also, many workers for Shiny Entertainment, including David Perry, worked for Virgin before splitting off to create Earthworm Jim. Also among Virgin Interactive alumni are famed video game composer Tommy Tallarico, artist Doug Ten- Napel, designer David Bishop, animator Bill Kroyer, animator/artists Andy Luckey and Mike Dietz and programmer Andy Astor. In 1993 Virgin Interactive created the “Digicel” process, originally for an unpublished game called “Dyno- blaze” which was managed by Andy Luckey, Paul Schmiedeke and Bill Kroyer. Bill K. Key to developing the process were Dr. Stephen Clarke-Willson, David Perry, designer David Bishop, animator Bill Kroyer, animation producer Andy Luckey, technical director Paul Schmiedeke, animator Mike Dietz and program- mer Andy Astor. The technology was first released to the general public in Disney’s Aladdin for the Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis and subsequently on such projects as The Lion King video game. Active Enterprises Ltd. F os , zkctive ati _ Founder Vince Perri, Raul Gomila ase Active Enterprises Ltd. is a defunct American Headquarter Miami, Florida, United States video game developer headquartered in Miami, Florida which was active in the early 1990s. Active Enterprises was formed by Raul Gomila and Vince Perri in 1989, and was founded by the genesis of the idea behind Action 52, a collection of 52 original games on one cartridge which was developed and pub- lished internally and eventually released for the NES in 1991. The game was not licensed by Nintendo. Promising 52 “new and original exciting games”, Action 52 was initially sold for the comparatively high price of $199 USD, and was backed up by a promotional contest which offered a grand prize of $104,000. However, the title soon became notorious for the poor quality of its games and their numerous bugs and glitches, while the contest, which involved reaching a stage in the game Ooze became essentially unwinna- ble due to these same factors. Nonetheless, in 1993 Active Enterprises contracted Farsight Technologies to port Action 52 to the Sega Genesis and the SNES, and develop the sports game Sports 5. Only Action 52 for the Genesis was released out of these 3 games. Active Enterprises employed 4 college students who developed the original Action 52 NES game cartridge. They have kept a low profile until recently. In August 2012 one of the four original Action 52 develop- ers surfaced and surprised the gaming community with their find, their very own original boxed Action 52 NES Prototype cartridge, the only other Action 52 Prototype known to exist. Along with never before seen original Action 52 and Cheetahmen posters and artwork, they posted an eBay auction selling the items for a $97,000 Buy It Now option or Best Offer. The auction generated over 10,000 views and 50 offers. They have since created a blog documenting the auction, the prototype, and more importantly, their part in the development of the Action 52 NES cartridge.

Prior to the founding of American Game Cartridges, ShareData hired Richard C. Frick as Vice President of Product Development. Frick worked previously at Atar1 Games, and had some experience with their console game subsidiary, Tengen. Frick was acquainted with this strategy, and applied it at ShareData’s new compa- ny, American Game Cartridges. To defeat the NES’s lockout chip, called 1ONES, AGC licensed technology from Color Dreams. AGC also licensed two titles from arcade game manufacturer Exidy: Chiller (1986) and Death Race (1976), which they adapted to the NES in 1990. Chiller was AGC’s first game release, and was also ShareData’s first title for the NES. Death Race quickly followed, as did an original work called Shockwave (1990). Keeping with ShareData’s business model of producing low-cost video games, AGC attempted to undersell their competition by as much as 30%. However, debts mounted throughout 1991, and by the fourth quar- ter AGC’s creditors were trying to force the company into a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States’ Bankruptcy Code. American Game Cartridges planned several other game releases, including a conversion of Exidy’s Cross- bow (1983), but was unable to complete development. 36 9 Pam 3.26. e: ‘oe Color Dreams Successor Wisdom Tree Color Dreams was a company that developed Founded 1988 video games for the NES. Defunct 1991 While most companies that developed NES games obtained an official license from Nintendo to produce game cartridges, Color Dreams was unusual in that 1t developed NES games without an official license. To produce these unlicensed games, Color Dreams had to bypass the NES’s “lock out” chip (the IONES). The company successfully bypassed the system, developed a game (Baby Boomer), and released it in 1989. Sev- eral other titles followed in 1989 and 1990, including Captain Comic, Crystal Mines, and Robodemons. As aresult of its reputation for releasing poor games, Color Dreams formed the label Bunch Games in 1990. Bunch Games was meant to be a label that Color Dreams could use to release lower quality games so that its reputation would not be damaged further. In 1991, Color Dreams formed Wisdom Tree for the purpose of releasing Christianity-themed games. The Wisdom Tree label resulted in Color Dreams’ best selling titles, including Spiritual Warfare and Bible Adventures. While Wisdom Tree remains active today and 1s still sell- ing religious video games, Color Dreams quit the video game business in the mid 1990s. Wisdom Tree is no longer associated with Color Dreams. One Color Dreams project that was never released was a game based on the movie Hellraiser. The game car- tridge, or “Super Cartridge” as it was called at the time, contained an extra processor that modified the tiles in the cartridge RAM without alerting the NES processor. This allowed for enhanced graphic effects rarely seen on the NES, such as a fully animated background running without the lag usually found with such tricks. The project was eventually abandoned. Camerica = Founded 1988 Camerica was a company owned and operated by David J. Harding. It was a video game company that was notable for producing unlicensed NES games and hardware. Camerica created many early peripherals for the NES, such as Supersonic The Joystick, a wireless controller add-on. Nintendo sued Camerica and their USA distributor, Galoob Toy many times. Camerica and Galoob Toy prevailed every time. There were lawsuits in California, New York and Canada. Nintendo had to pay Galoob Toy US$15,000,000 in damages over one of those lawsuits. Since Camerica still lacked license to produce NES games, they had to create their own cartridges that would bypass Nintendo’s lock-out chip. Like the circuit used in Color Dreams cartridges, the Camerica lock- out defeat generated glitch pulses that froze the chip. The cartridges they made were shaped slightly differ- ently from Nintendo’s cartridges, though they still fit in the NES. The most notable difference however was in color; all Camerica cartridges were gold and later silver. They also featured a switch for play on European NES consoles. Camerica released the Codemasters-designed Game Genie in Canada and the UK. Thor Aackerlund was a spokesperson for the brand. Hacker International was a Japanese video game Founder Satoru Hagiwara company that developed and published games Parent Hacker International from 1990 to 2001 for the Nintendo Famicom (including Famicom Disk System), NEC PC Engine (including PC Engine CD), Sony PlaySta- tion (as Map Japan) consoles, and Windows PCs. The company was known for its play-for-porn approach to gaming, with such games as AV Pachi-Slot (Hot Slots) and Soap Panic (Bubble Bath Babes) featuring female nudity as a reward for skilful playing. These games were usually distributed through mail order and sold approximately 30,000 to 50,000 copies each. Many of their games were developed by Taiwanese companies and were released in non-pornographic form elsewhere in the world; however three were released in the United States for the NES with pornography intact (albeit sometimes modified to “Westernise” the girls’ features) by another Taiwanese company, Pan- esian. The Hacker name was first used by Satoru Hagiwara, an entrepreneur and former music producer, for a monthly PC magazine. Hacker International was founded by Hagiwara as an outlet for its writers’ ideas; its first product was the Hacker Junior, an upgrade for Famicom systems that provided composite video output and turbo controllers, for which they were sued by Nintendo and eventually settled out of court. The com- pany was also known for the Disk Hacker software which allowed users to copy Famicom Disk System disks using only an ordinary Disk System (as opposed to the official method of using Nintendo’s authorised Disk Writer units, which were placed only in game stores and charged 500 yen to copy a selected game to a customer’s disk). Several versions were released to combat successive anti-piracy measures introduced by Nintendo. None of Hacker’s games, with the exception of their 15 PlayStation titles, were licensed by the respective console manufacturers; Hiroshi Yamauchi personally opposed pornographic content in Famicom games, believing they would tarnish Nintendo’s reputation. When Tokuma Shoten’s Family Computer magazine published advertisements for Hacker’s games, it felt its relationship with Nintendo—which it relied on for preview materials—was so threatened that five of Tokuma’s top executives travelled to Nintendo to apolo- gise to Yamauchi in person. However, NEC was more tolerant of Hacker’s PC Engine releases (under the Games Express brand) and actually thanked Hacker for helping console sales. Hacker became a licensee for the PlayStation under the name Map Japan, releasing 15 games, but eventually closed in 2001 due to compe- tition from other publishers and Hagiwara’s own loss of interest in gaming. Sachen Founded 1988 Thin Chen Enterprise, also known as Sachen or in the original name Sheng Qian Enterprise Co., Ltd, was a Taiwanese company that developed sev- eral original games for the NES, Mega Drive and Game Boy. Headquarter Taipei, Taiwan Website sachen.com.tw (closed) All of Thin Chen’s games were produced without license from the console manufacturers (With the excep- tion of the Watara Supervision and Mega Duck); the company produced at least 70 unique games for the NES and Famicom and at least 32 for the Game Boy (albeit compiled into eight 4-in-1 cartridges), making it the most prolific unlicensed developer and publisher for both consoles by a considerable margin. The com- pany also produced its own NES hardware clones, such as the Q-Boy. 38 _-™__———_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—_—————————————————_™ 3.30. Tengen Founded 1987 Defunct 1994 Headquarter Milpitas, California, USA Tengen was a video game publisher and developer Parent Atari Games that was created by arcade game manufacturer Atari Games. Atari had been split into two distinct companies. Atari Corporation was responsible for computer and console games and hardware and owned the rights to the Atari brand for these domains. Atari Games was formed from Atari’s arcade division, and were able to use the Atari name on arcade releases but not on con- sole or computer games. When Atari Games wanted to enter the console-game market, 1t needed to create a new label that did not use the Atar1 name. The new subsidiary was dubbed Tengen, which in the Japanese nomenclature of the oriental game Go refers to the central point of the board (the word “Atari” comes from the same game). Tengen then made an agreement with Namco to bring some of their Family Computer games to the NES in North America before Namco opened its own North American branch (Namco Hom- etek) in 1990. Tengen also released games by Sunsoft (another developer without a North American branch). Tengen unsuccessfully tried to negotiate with Nintendo for a less restrictive license (Nintendo restricted their licensees to releasing only five games per year, and required their games to be NES-exclusive for two years). Nintendo refused, so in December 1987 Tengen agreed to the standard licensing terms. In 1988, Tengen re- leased its first and only three cartridges licensed through Nintendo—R.B.I. Baseball, Pac-Man and Gauntlet. Meanwhile, Tengen secretly worked to bypass Nintendo’s lock-out chip called 1ONES that gave it control over which games were published for the NE"
