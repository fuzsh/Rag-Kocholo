        "text": "Finished Bear With Me Complete Edition, consisting of the main story devided into 3 episodes and the later added prequel called Lost Robots.\n\nThe basic idea of the story is, that everything is told through the eyes of 10 year old Amber and her childish imagination. Every other character are her plushies, being alive and complex characters. They live in Paper City, what is literally a city Amber build out of paper for her toys.\n\nOn a stormy night, Amber wakes up from a nightmare, to learn her plushies fled out of Paper City to her house, cause a myserious red man is running rampage, and it seems, he's searching for Amber. On top of that, Amber's older brother Flint has gone missing. To search for him, she has to reunite with her old teddy Ted E. Bear. He's a grumpy retired detective, she used to solve cases with, until they parted ways.\n\nThe whole game is designed to invoke a detective-film-noir feeling. Graphics are a 2D comic/cartoon look in black/white and red. Ted is the absolute cliche detective, alcoholic, calling every woman doll, reciting deep flowery monologues in a dark voice. (Personally I found it quite exhausting.)\n\nEvery now and then comes a cutscene, consisting of photos pinned on a wall, with just Ted retelling what happened in the last minutes in his exaggerated detective-monologue style. Since you literally just played everything he tells, I thought it was somewhat redundant.\n\nThe gameplay is more on the simple side, with everything very limited and linear. There are even points where the game just outright tells you the solution to a riddle unasked for, what seemed very strange to me. When you have no confidence in people understanding your puzzle, just put up a sign with the solution on it next to it.\n\nAt other instances the puzzle feels like a useless obstacle. For example a character wants an item from me, to do something for me in return. Now in another PnC this would be its own questline. But here I already have said item with me and got it automatically during the intro cutscene. Those moments felt pointless and as if they had to cut out content or so.\n\nLeft-click on hotspots brings up icons for interaction. If you want to open the inventory, you have to click on the icon in the corner - no alternative like right-click or scroll wheel. And another pet peeve of mine: When you pick up a new item, a red light starts to circle around the inventory icon constantly until you open it again. I found it irritating and at times just opened the inventory for it to stop.\n\nYou can combine items with one another via drag'n'drop, but can't further look at them in the inventory. Amber's and Ted's comments when you try to use something tend to be not really helpful or specific most of the time. There was even one point where I needed to check a walkthrough, cause I was damn near sure I might have triggered a bug, since the more than obvious solution wouldn't work, without them giving any helpful hints, why they don't want to use it. When I had this a second time, at least I suspected a similar thing and could solve it on my own.\n\nBut to be fair, those were rare cases. Most of the time everything is quite easy, and due to the very limited options you have, just trying around a bit helps already.\n\nOn the other hand, there can be a bit too many hotspots. You can nearly look at everything. Every window, lamp or item lying around, with only a tiny amount being actually useful.\n\nChapter 1 takes only place in Amber's house, with very few rooms to go to. It's also the shortest episode, with just around 1,5 hours. You use some itmes here and there, but it is more dialogue driven and sometimes nearly plays itself.\n\nChapter 2 opens up a bit. It takes place in Paper City, with giving you a map and several places to go to. Yet it remains very linear and scripted, all locations remain very small.\n\nThere are some more puzzles and small riddles with more use of items. But still many dialogues playing on there own. Sometimes you mainly go somewhere to have a dialogue, maybe grab an item or two, and leave again. Length is around 2,5 hours.\n\nChapter 3 is still in the city, but feels even more linear than ever before. Items are rare and super limited, instead it goes more into puzzle and riddle solving. Like finding the right combination to open a door. Those weren't too hard, but I liked them. All the rest are dialogues again. It took me roughly 3 hours.\n\nObviously the story is meant to be the selling point. For me, this only worked in parts, though.\n\nThe voice acting is great and works well with all the characters. Many mysteries are build up and there are some unnatrual happenings in the beginning. It is also a huge talking point over and over, how children grow up and leave their old toys behind in the process. And at the same time how important a plushy can be for a child.\n\nAll of this kept me interested at first, but sadly is dropped in the long run. The stories outcome isn't bad, but I thought, something more complex would have been interesting and also more unique. In the end I thought, it is only one of many, with also the luxury of claiming, everything is shaped by Amber's imagination and so can be whatever.\n\nThe telling point of forgetting a tragic event and having to remember it just doesn't feel so new to me. I respect what they were telling, but I thought the idea of how things change because of the child growing up, they even reference every so often, would have been more unique and interesting.\n\nAt rare times you can make some sort of decision. There is one in the first chapter, that gets referenced some times in the second. Nothing big, but it seemed neat at least. But everything later on didn't have any noteworthy effect, what was a bit disappointing.\n\nDialogues can be quite exessive, as I mentioned before. Many things just happen automatically during them, with you just watching, and characters making a sudden heel turn all the time. We go to A, who works with B. So we go and talk to B, who then suddenly, just stops helping A somewhat out of the blue. Back with A, they have changed their mind in the meantime too, and give up their plan. Back and forth like this made the characters and story kinda shallow.\n\nIt's often mentioned that Amber is only 10 years old and at some occasions, they give her a very childish sense of humour because of that. But most of the time, she gives a much older impression with the way she acts and talks.\n\nThere are two endings, basically a good and a bad one, with the latter having a nice small \"twist\" in my eyes.\n\nWhat didn't work for me most of the time was the game's humour. There are many hidden easter eggs and references in the background. Like you can see a Yoshi egg lying around, or sometimes they make a joke during dialogues. Those were fine and I even liked to look for things in the background. What stood out were the 4th wall breaking jokes, that just didn't work with the general tone of the game.\n\nUsually the atmosphere is quite dark and grim, with even some pretty dark comments. And then, out of the blue, Ted suddenly makes the CSI Miami sunglasses meme. Or after a dialogue, they start to talk to someone off screen, as if they were filming a scene on set.\n\nThere is even one, I found a bit tasteless. During one of the cutscenes, when Ted retells the story, he gets interrupted by Amber in the sound booth, who calls it his diary thing. And when he complains, she leaves him with the words: \"Take your time Anne Frank.\"\n\nI mean, yeah Anne Frank got famous because of her diaries, sure. Retelling how she suffered through the holocaust. It left me with a weird feeling.\n\nThe prequel episode Lost Robots is mainly more of the same, with the same highs and lows as the main story. Here we play Flint, Amber's older brother, solving a case with Ted.\n\nI was kinda disappointed, that there is no improvement in the gameplay, given that it was developed later on. The story fell also flat on me once more. The case they are solving, didn't interest me much, and with the context form the main game, what happens in the real world felt like a sledgehammer to me.\n\nIt's clear form the beginning, that we are basically playing him right before his death, what I find a bit too on the nose. We already know his fate from the main game, it would be a bitter sweet experience even without being directly linked to his certain death. For example the case, they are solving, could be a light metaphor on his quarrel with Amber, and he overcomes his feeling of guilt etc this way, instead of it just being a talking point in the background. It could show how he comes to terms with himself through his imagination.\n\nInstead everything feels build to hit you with the most feels possible, when his death is foreshadowed at the end.\n\nThe length of this episode is around 2 hours.\n\nIn space no one can hear you click.\n\nI already had several encounters with the STASIS series. I played the free spin-off CAYNE and the demo for the sequel STASIS: Bonte Totem. And they left a very mixed impression on me. Gameplay flawed, writing bad, but the overall atmosphere is always pretty great. So despite my scepticism, I went and grabbed the first game, that started everything. And I got pretty much, what I expected.\n\nSTASIS is a bit the Resident Evil of Point'n'Click Adventures. It centers around Cayne, an evil corporation doing experiments in secret labs, where sooner or later shit hits the fan.\n\nJohn is awaken from stasis on board of a huge spaceship, that is basically a giant lab from Cayne, where something went horribly wrong. He doesn't know, how he got there and starts to make his way through the ship, searching for his family, coming across all the weird experiments, they did there.\n\nEverything is in isometric prespective, a bit uncommon for this genre. Interacting with hotspots is also slightly different. If you hover over one, a description turns up on the bottom of the screen, written in a detailed way, reminding me of a text adventure in the vein of \"tell, don't show\". A lot of stuff can be examined this way. If the cursor shows a handsymbol instead of an eye, you can actually click on it, so that John might do something there.\n\nIt's a bit strange at first, but one get used to it. The downside is, that those description not always tell you, what you really need to know to understand what you have to do there. It get worse through the fact, that John himself doesn't give any helpful comments at all. Often I wondered, what he's doing there, what is wrong with something and the like.\n\nArea and items are pretty limited, so some trying around can help at times. Yet I found myself stuck in few instances. Sometimes the game just went over my head.\n\nSome clues to riddles are pretty well hidden and don't even have to be a hotspot. They went under in the overall noise, were quite small or just some unrelated decoration in the background for me.\n\nA lot of stuff involves using terminals of all kinds. In close ups there is no indication on what is a hotspot, what leads to some clicking around. Some close ups are even just for you to look at, and clicking lets John walk around in the area in the background.\n\nDeath is an important part, there are several times where the enviroment will kill you. The game autosaves and gives you a checkpoint after you died, but I highly recommend to save manually every so often, cause those checkpoints can be a bit bad. For example it is not possible to skip dialogues, and dying can mean to have to sit through a scripted scene over and over.\n\nAs some sort of easter egg, you can also commit suicide, by using certain items on John. But remember to save before, cause there is no checkpoint then.\n\nIt was fun in a weird way to seek out all the possible deaths, although they aren't that spectacularly staged.\n\nThe backgrounds seem prerendered and very detailed. All the areas are very atmospheric and have an interesting look. Flickering lights and other stuff also keeps them from looking to still and dead. John himself stands out a tiny bit. And while his animation are plentyful (you can even see him pulling out the inventory), his movement often looks a bit wonky and doesn't always match the background (when climbing a latter e.g.).\n\nIt is not possible to zoom in and I found the camera a bit far away, everything tends to be quite small. This gives them the opportunity to display all the gross shit, without it looking too graphical, since everything is so tiny. But that also leads to me sometimes crawling into my monitor, to see stuff better for the general gameplay.\n\nThere are nearly no options. In a seperate exe in the game folder you can only make the most basic screen adjustments. Luckily they let you increase the text size, I found the normal one pretty small. But no sound options at all.\n\nI found the loading times too long, especially given the simple look and small areas. What does it load there? Sometimes it even loads before and after passages, that are usually meant to hide loading times (e.g. an elevator ride). But this mostly happens between bigger chapters, changing rooms on one area is usually pretty ok. Still it annoyed me a bit at times.\n\nNow comes the toughest part: The writing. Where do I even start?\n\nSTASIS is the epitome of a sledgehammer. A horror space opera featuring every cliche possible, delivered straight into your face.\n\nFor the main story, I missed a red threat. Instead of concentrating on one experiment, they just throw everything in there, you ever heard of somewhere. A handful of different experiments, all go wrong in a way, all with different subplots. It made many things feel meaningless, cause all of those stories are just there, without leading to anywhere. Apparently one worker was a spy. Or another woman was a bit crazy and made secret experiments of her own. Well, okay. They just die in the chaos that happend on the ship. Everything seems just there to be there.\n\nOur own character John stays quite bland. While he shows distress at times, at other moments he barely shows any reaction. This can be very weird when for example you read a report on a terminal that mentions his wife, and he gives no comment.\n\nBut the worst thing are the tons of badly written PDAs, you find throughout the ship, containing the diaries of the workers. And most of them read like the fanfic of a 12 year old, who wants to write something super edgy and cool.\n\nYou have a bunch of mad scientists and psychopaths. Or people with other weird issues. It is also often about who likes whom, and who bangs whom. Especially the sex theme got exhausting over time.\n\nWe discussed before how the series tends to feel slightly mysogonistic. Now given how everyone on the ship isn't the brightest candle on the cake and they have a bunch of bad written stereotypes, I'm not sure how much I'd call it mysogonistic overall. But it has def a problem with trash talking women.\n\nYou have a love triangle with a manipulative woman. Another one is judged for having too many partners. A man tells how his wife put his name into a death lottery to get payed upon his death. Just to give a few examples. Even when the male writer is himself a psychopath, the diaries give off a boys locker room vibe, where they go \"Women, am I rite, bro!?\" with a fist bump. Honestly, it made me feel a bit uncomfortable over time. And I have to question why they felt the need to put all of this in there to this amount, since it adds basically nothing at the end.\n\nIn general I found the quantity of the PDAs overweights the quality. You find so many, and most of them react to similar events. I mostly skimmed through them, since they feel often like pure filler, with nothing interesting to say.\n\nI can't even really connect to these people. They are long dead and I don't even know what they look like. They are just a name with some diary entries and that's it. And given how many people are thrown out like this, I couldn't even really remember the names, and who with whom.\n\nMy playthrough took me around 7 hours.\n\nThe main story didn't catch me, as well as the characters. And regarding the PDAs, I can only call the writing atrocious. But I can appreciate the thick atmosphere. It is a bit too much blatant in your face at times, with all its different horrors. But the areas look great and really atmospheric, with some really cool effects to spook you. That's what I like most about the series, and why despite all the gripes, I still see myself coming back to it for the sequel. Hopefully they chose a different tone for the PDAs there.\n\nIn space no one can hear you click.\n\nI already had several encounters with the STASIS series. I played the free spin-off CAYNE and the demo for the sequel STASIS: Bonte Totem. And they left a very mixed impression on me. Gameplay flawed, writing bad, but the overall atmosphere is always pretty great. So despite my scepticism, I went and grabbed the first game, that started everything. And I got pretty much, what I expected.\n\nSTASIS is a bit the Resident Evil of Point'n'Click Adventures. It centers around Cayne, an evil corporation doing experiments in secret labs, where sooner or later shit hits the fan.\n\nJohn is awaken from stasis on board of a huge spaceship, that is basically a giant lab from Cayne, where something went horribly wrong. He doesn't know, how he got there and starts to make his way through the ship, searching for his family, coming across all the weird experiments, they did there.\n\nEverything is in isometric prespective, a bit uncommon for this genre. Interacting with hotspots is also slightly different. If you hover over one, a description turns up on the bottom of the screen, written in a detailed way, reminding me of a text adventure in the vein of \"tell, don't show\". A lot of stuff can be examined this way. If the cursor shows a handsymbol instead of an eye, you can actually click on it, so that John might do something there.\n\nIt's a bit strange at first, but one get used to it. The downside is, that those description not always tell you, what you really need to know to understand what you have to do there. It get worse through the fact, that John himself doesn't give any helpful comments at all. Often I wondered, what he's doing there, what is wrong with something and the like.\n\nArea and items are pretty limited, so some trying around can help at times. Yet I found myself stuck in few instances. Sometimes the game just went over my head.\n\nSome clues to riddles are pretty well hidden and don't even have to be a hotspot. They went under in the overall noise, were quite small or just some unrelated decoration in the background for me.\n\nA lot of stuff involves using terminals of all kinds. In close ups there is no indication on what is a hotspot, what leads to some clicking around. Some close ups are even just for you to look at, and clicking lets John walk around in the area in the background.\n\nDeath is an important part, there are several times where the enviroment will kill you. The game autosaves and gives you a checkpoint after you died, but I highly recommend to save manually every so often, cause those checkpoints can be a bit bad. For example it is not possible to skip dialogues, and dying can mean to have to sit through a scripted scene over and over.\n\nAs some sort of easter egg, you can also commit suicide, by using certain items on John. But remember to save before, cause there is no checkpoint then.\n\nIt was fun in a weird way to seek out all the possible deaths, although they aren't that spectacularly staged.\n\nThe backgrounds seem prerendered and very detailed. All the areas are very atmospheric and have an interesting look. Flickering lights and other stuff also keeps them from looking to still and dead. John himself stands out a tiny bit. And while his animation are plentyful (you can even see him pulling out the inventory), his movement often looks a bit wonky and doesn't always match the background (when climbing a latter e.g.).\n\nIt is not possible to zoom in and I found the camera a bit far away, everything tends to be quite small. This gives them the opportunity to display all the gross shit, without it looking too graphical, since everything is so tiny. But that also leads to me sometimes crawling into my monitor, to see stuff better for the general gameplay.\n\nThere are nearly no options. In a seperate exe in the game folder you can only make the most basic screen adjustments. Luckily they let you increase the text size, I found the normal one pretty small. But no sound options at all.\n\nI found the loading times too long, especially given the simple look and small areas. What does it load there? Sometimes it even loads before and after passages, that are usually meant to hide loading times (e.g. an elevator ride). But this mostly happens between bigger chapters, changing rooms on one area is usually pretty ok. Still it annoyed me a bit at times.\n\nNow comes the toughest part: The writing. Where do I even start?\n\nSTASIS is the epitome of a sledgehammer. A horror space opera featuring every cliche possible, delivered straight into your face.\n\nFor the main story, I missed a red threat. Instead of concentrating on one experiment, they just throw everything in there, you ever heard of somewhere. A handful of different experiments, all go wrong in a way, all with different subplots. It made many things feel meaningless, cause all of those stories are just there, without leading to anywhere. Apparently one worker was a spy. Or another woman was a bit crazy and made secret experiments of her own. Well, okay. They just die in the chaos that happend on the ship. Everything seems just there to be there.\n\nOur own character John stays quite bland. While he shows distress at times, at other moments he barely shows any reaction. This can be very weird when for example you read a report on a terminal that mentions his wife, and he gives no comment.\n\nBut the worst thing are the tons of badly written PDAs, you find throughout the ship, containing the diaries of the workers. And most of them read like the fanfic of a 12 year old, who wants to write something super edgy and cool.\n\nYou have a bunch of mad scientists and psychopaths. Or people with other weird issues. It is also often about who likes whom, and who bangs whom. Especially the sex theme got exhausting over time.\n\nWe discussed before how the series tends to feel slightly mysogonistic. Now given how everyone on the ship isn't the brightest candle on the cake and they have a bunch of bad written stereotypes, I'm not sure how much I'd call it mysogonistic overall. But it has def a problem with trash talking women.\n\nYou have a love triangle with a manipulative woman. Another one is judged for having too many partners. A man tells how his wife put his name into a death lottery to get payed upon his death. Just to give a few examples. Even when the male writer is himself a psychopath, the diaries give off a boys locker room vibe, where they go \"Women, am I rite, bro!?\" with a fist bump. Honestly, it made me feel a bit uncomfortable over time. And I have to question why they felt the need to put all of this in there to this amount, since it adds basically nothing at the end.\n\nIn general I found the quantity of the PDAs overweights the quality. You find so many, and most of them react to similar events. I mostly skimmed through them, since they feel often like pure filler, with nothing interesting to say.\n\nI can't even really connect to these people. They are long dead and I don't even know what they look like. They are just a name with some diary entries and that's it. And given how many people are thrown out like this, I couldn't even really remember the names, and who with whom.\n\nMy playthrough took me around 7 hours.\n\nThe main story didn't catch me, as well as the characters. And regarding the PDAs, I can only call the writing atrocious. But I can appreciate the thick atmosphere. It is a bit too much blatant in your face at times, with all its different horrors. But the areas look great and really atmospheric, with some really cool effects to spook you. That's what I like most about the series, and why despite all the gripes, I still see myself coming back to it for the sequel. Hopefully they chose a different tone for the PDAs there.\n\nYeah I read up on the meanness around women with the first Stasis game which made me avoid it in the end when initially I was hyped about it during the kickstarter, but since you've played the whole series, is there more of it in the other entries?"
