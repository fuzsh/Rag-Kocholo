        "text": "This is the third and final game in the Adventure Game trilogy for the NES. This time the category is on the horror genre, which is cool as it's one of my favorite genres of all time which also believe it or not makes this game my favorite of the trilogy. It makes sense when you think about it as it's the perfect genre to go to next, the horror genre is full of mysteries in fact most to all horror stories begin with mystery as the protagonists and even, we are trying to figure out what in the heck is going on, and of course they have to figure it all out fast as their lives depend on it; just as yours does in this game.\n\nI'll admit when I heard about this game as a kid, I thought this game was based on the old 1950's supernatural movie \"The Uninvited\". Of course, it's not despite both having the same name (well the movie title starts with The but it was close) though the premise is almost similar as in the film it's about a brother and sister living in a haunted house and both investigating to lift its curse.\n\nIn this game both you and your sister have inherited a mansion but unfortunately, it's cursed by an evil force. This force has taken your sister and it's up to you to venture into the home to save her while at the same time surviving to do so. That's basically it in a nutshell, like most of these old adventure games they we're never known for a deep story much like with a \"Choose your Own Adventure\" book they were always about simply decision making and continuing to go along with the story until you get to the next situation and the set of choices with it.\n\nThis game like a lot of yesteryear adventure games operated on that same principle, but of course like with most adventure games their more to it as it's about observing and investigating. You kind of must poke and prod each area you come to as each may contain certain clues that will help you progress further in the game. Though you need to do it carefully just like in the \"Choose your Own Adventure\" books one wrong turn or decision will mean certain doom, but also don't take too much time as the evil forces won't wait for you to come to them.\n\nThe music is good, I wouldn't say it's on the most memorable list but it's good enough to evoke tension and that creepy feeling and really motivated you to keep even speed up your investigation as you felt your life along with your sister's depends on it.\n\nI really like the details of the digital images their well detailed in the usual form like the previous games which is fine by me as I wouldn't want it any other way. But also like the ghosts and monsters and the details on them. I'll admit as a kid this game scared me, despite being just images that showed up those images were downright creepy and spooky as you see the monsters and those hideous expressions they make and that text which just feeds your imagination as it tells you what is happening. Just the details of what was happening to my character just filled me with dread which made me glad this was a game, and I wasn't in this guy's shoes. Though felt bad because it meant I had to start all over in the game again.\n\nWhich gets at my next point, like all these adventure games their all or nothing as there are not checkpoints or saves. This may seem unfair but it's not as this game is short, at least once you know where all the clues are and where to go. Like all puzzles the game is simple but doesn't look or seem that way at first.\n\nThis game won't be for everyone as it really isn't, if you're into the adventure genre and even the survival horror genre and you're a retro enthusiast that is looking for another yesteryear adventure game this would be the right place to go. However, if you're into one genre but not the other, then this game isn't going to be for you.\n\nThis haunted house is worth a visit, if you dare.\n\nRating: 4 stars."
