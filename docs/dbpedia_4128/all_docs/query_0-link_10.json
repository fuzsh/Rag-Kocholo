In The Beginning . . . there were floppy disk drives. They were slow. Then came Winchester hard disks that plugged into a Macintosh™serial or floppy port. These offered increased storage but were still slow. And Then One Day. . . someone invented SCSI (Small Computer System Interface), a much faster inter- face than floppy or serial ports. And suddenly, hard disks were more than just lots of storage. They were fast. Hard disks became very popular. But a new problem arose. Disk crashes. Though infrequent, crashes were very traumatic. Thus It Came To Be . ♦ . tape backup was developed. And it was good. Data stored on a hard disk could now be \"backed up\" onto a tape cartridge and stored. In the eventuality of a crash, data could then be restored to the hard disk. The trauma was over. Tape backup was slow, however, and the engineers at AST Research could not rest. They labored to create a better hard disk/tape backup sys- tem. And, thus, after many months of toil they developed a 256K Cache and a Tape Motion Optimizer Algorithm. Innovations so unique, patents were applied for? An Unprecedented Advance... the Cache was a RAM buffer into which files could be moved for back- up to tape. The computer would then be freed up. Work could con- tinue while backup was occurring! And, yes, it was even user friendly. And, if the hard disk should need maintenance, the tape could be used like a floppy diskette — written to directly via the fast 256K RAM Cache. The system was complete! The AST-2000™ was born. \"Patents pending AST and the AST logo registered and AST-20C0 trademarks of AST Research. Inc Apple registered trademark of Apple Computer. Inc.

( , 5/964 . 630a Mac Bulletin Apple Sends out a Software Shoot ^ A year after Guy Kawasaki proposed its formation, and on the heels of his departure to start his own software com- pany, Apple Computer an- nounced plans to create a separate software company to publish programs for the Mac- intosh and the Apple II. The new venture, initially a subsid- iary of Apple, will market exist- ing Apple programs as well as develop new software and pub- lish third-party efforts- but none will have the Apple name on the label. Plans call for the software subsidiary to break off as an independent company, perhaps within its first year. In his announcement, Apple chairman and CEO John Scul- ley said the move was intended in part to enable other software developers for Apple machines “to participate in the market on a more equal footing.” In initial reactions, however, developers were not confident that the new structure would resolve the tension caused by Apple’s publishing programs that compete with third-party products. One developer said, “It’s better to compete against products that don’t say Apple on the label, but we’re still going to have to look at Apple as a competitor. Apple is not going to start this up and then let it fail; it’ll make use of Apple knowledge, money, experience, and most important, its dis- tribution network.” It’s not such bad news from the users’ standpoint. It proba- bly means that improvements to Apple’s staple software will finally be forthcoming, after a long period without upgrades. Juggler ► Last month we reported on Twitcher, the context-switch- ing Finder based on Andy Hertzfeld’s Servant. The word now is that its code name has changed to Juggler. Though it reportedly contains none of Hertzfeld’s code, it is said to re- main faithful to the concept- you can have several applica- tions open at once on your desktop. The new Finder will allow some tasks, such as print- ing, to go on in the background while you work in an applica- tion program. Full multitask- ing-the kind that lets you sort your mammoth database while you write the report to go with it-won’t be available with the next Finder. That breakthrough may be announced by the end of the year. Software Compatibility ► If you've tried to run Mac- Write on a Mac II, you may have experienced some problems. Reportedly, Apple is readying MacWrite 4.6 to remedy incom- patibility problems and to fix a few ancient bugs. Expect upgrades to appear for other applications as com- patibility problems come to light with the existing 2000- plus applications. To avoid some of the heartburn that ac- companied its last major hard- ware release in January 1986, Apple has initiated a rigorous program to test applications with the new r Mac SE and Mac II hardware and the accompany- ing system software. Apple has alerted developers that they'll have to go back to the drawing board if their products fail, but the incompatibility list has not been made public. Reportedly, fewer than 25 percent of tested applications have problems; most are the type that a pro- grammer could easily fix in a day or two. Until upgrades ap- pear, however, prepare for un- pleasant surprises with pro- grams that haven't been tuned to the new microprocessor. Another IBM Convert ^ Due to customer demand, Corporate Software, which dis- tributes programs directly to Fortune 1000 companies, has broken with its 3^2-year tradi- tion and added 51 Macintosh programs to its list of more than 400 IBM PC software titles. The distributor, based in Can- ton, Massachusetts, had been special-ordering Mac programs for its corporate customers; now they will order in bulk and offer discounts. “We finally reached the point where the demand reached critical mass,” said Mary Harrison, national manager of software sales. The titles include the full line of Microsoft products (well, almost full; Flight Simu- lator is conspicuously absent), plus Apple’s programs and a range of graphics, database management, communications, and word processing software, along with Living Videotext’s More, Borland’s Sidekick, and utilities such as John Mitchell’s Fedit Plus and FWB Software's trio of hard disk utilities. Kamerman Labs Still Going ► Joel Kamerman of Kamer- man Labs reports that the Mac- intosh side of his company’s business is healthy even though the firm filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code at the beginning of the year. The cause of the business problems, according to Kamerman, was isolated w r ith its IBM PC periph- erals. “Ever since w r e started shipping our Mac Cirrus drives, the company has been profit- able,” he said. To reassure cus- tomers who might be jittery about support for Kamerman’s compact Cirrus hard disks or tape drives, Kamerman ex- plained that the Cirrus drives are 80 percent owned by a sep- arate company. “Even if the creditors don’t accept our re- organization plan, the Mac products wall still be marketed and supported.” Dial-a-User-Group ► A few months ago w^e ran a Bulletin item about the meet- ing of user group leaders held in Dayton last April. The people in Dayton received so many calls — at all hours- from readers who wanted to know’ how to find a local user group, w r e figured we'd better publish the referral number again: 800/538-9696 ext. 500. (If you use a non-AT&T long-distance carrier, punch in your carrier code before dialing the phone number.)

ICOM will produce one more game for Mindscape to fulfill its contract but then will turn its full attention to marketing its own line of enter- tainment software, including role-playing games with high- resolution graphics and more games in the Macventure se- ries. The first title to look for is Helios, a science fiction adven- ture due out this fall. Gossip, developed by that notorious practitioner John Dvorak, is scheduled for release early next year. Both will be $49.95. 3-D in Color ► In the May issue, Mac- world ran a long article about recent developments in 3-D programs for the Mac. Now it appears that yet another gener- ation of 3-D graphics programs is already on the way, and the common denominator is color. Challenger Software of Homewood, Illinois, is adding color to its Mac3D program this summer, with color shad- ing from a palette of 256 colors selected from the 4096 avail- able on the Mac II. Chicago-based Enabling Technologies is working on a version of Pro3D that will take advantage of color on the Mac II-and the 68881 math copro- cessor. The new version im- proves on its predecessor in other ways, for example, dou- bling the number and refining control of the light sources and allowing users to save images in PostScript format so that they can be exported into programs like Cricket Draw. It's ex- pected out early next year. Also in 1988, Macromind, the Chicago-based developer of VideoWorks, plans to launch a 3-D wire-frame animation pro- gram that will accept input in 1GES format from existing products, such as Mac3D and Pro3D. The greater Chicago area is not the only source of 3-D inno- vation, however. San Diegos Silicon Beach Software, devel- oper of Super Paint, is prepar- ing a new three-dimensional graphics program due out at the end of the summer that in- cludes color, animation, flexible lighting effects, support of the 68020 microprocessor and the 68881 coprocessor, and the ability to accept text files cre- ated by other 3-D applications from micro to mainframe. ► By the time you read this, Microsoft will probably already be mailing version 3.01 of Microsoft Word to fix problems users reported in the early days after 3.0’s release. The new Mac l I-compat ible version - mailed free to registered users- in- cludes name stamping and al- lows unlimited fonts. ► For t he I i rst time, Apple Computer announced a stock dividend- 12 cents per share - for the first quarter of 1987. In addition, the stock was split two-for-one on May 15. Apple head John Sculley explained, “A stock split will lower the price of our stock, which has recently recorded new highs. These ac- tions should allow a broader group of investors to participate in our future.” The Waiting Game ► St ill holding out for an up- coming program? Here’s a status report on some long- awaited applications. Quark’s new page-layout program XPress shipped at the end of March, ahead of the new version of Aldus’s PageMaker, which started shipping at the end of April. Another desktop publishing offering, Target Soft- ware’s Scoop (a.k.a. Solo, a.k.a. SPUD) is due out this summer. Meanwhile, looking no worse for wear after being rejected by Letraset, Boston Publishing Sys- tems’ MacPublisher HI (for- merly Let ra Page) began ship- ping in April. The new version of the page-makeup program includes support for color on the Mac II and gray-scale text. The world is still waiting for AshtonTate’s high-end data- base manager, dBase Mac, which now may have to fight for its life if the Acius 4th Di- mension challenger beats it to dealers’ shelves. Remember hearing about Grey Paint long ago? The gray- scale graphics editing software for bit-mapped images, devel- oped by Fractal Software, was picked up by Letraset, revised significantly, and is scheduled for release late this summer as The Realist. Doug Clapp’s Word Tools grammar- and punctuation-re- pair program has shipped, ac- cording to Aegis Development of Santa Monica, California. On the other hand, Ann Arbor Software’s FullWrite Profes- sional is still under construc- tion, and Word Perfect hadn’t made it to the beta-test version at press time. Publishers will probably make an effort to present finished programs for sale at the Macworld Expo in Boston next month, but at this late date it looks as if some may be shown in demonstration-only editions. And Now, in Four Colors ► Adobe Systems’ Il- lustrator is a great tool, say professional graphic artists, but it won’t be a total solution until there’s some way to automate the drudgery of color separa- tions. In response, the Palo Alto company is preparing a desk accessory that breaks down an Illustrator image into the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black parts comprising a four-color printed image. Code-named Separator, the program can produce printer-ready negative film on the Linotronic 100 or 300 or positive images on any printer. Adobe has come up with settings that produce good results in print, but de- signers can also pick their own screen angles and percentages, scale and position artwork, and add registration and crop marks. SE Inside Drives ► According to sources, 85 percent of Macintosh SEs are sold with internal disk drives. But not all of them come from Apple. Rodime, which won’t confirm the word on the street that it’s Apple’s hard disk sup- plier, has begun to market a 50MB internal drive for the SE ($1595). The Pepper Pike, Ohio, company bases its iVi - inch drive on voice-coil technology, which makes it speedier (aver- age access time: 28 millisec- onds) than electromechanical drives that hunt for data track by track. It’s also more reli- able- the drive heads park au- tomatically when it stops. CMS Enhancements of Tustin, California, also makes a voice-coil internal drive for the SE, the 38.5MB Pro-40 ($1395), with an average access time of 29 milliseconds. □ Apple Stock Splits Microsoft to Fix Word 3.0 14 July 1987 Hold on to your desk. The Radius Accelerator™ is here. With the Accelerator on board your Macintosh, you can run graphics, word processing and other applications three to four times faster. Which makes it indispen- sible for serious desktop publishing. And, with an optional math co-processor, it blazes through float- ing point computations 50 to 100 times faster. On-screen performance accelerated. Not only does the Accelerator dramatically increase your Macintosh’s overall speed, it makes all on-screen activities virtually fly by. You’ll see sig- nificant speed increases when scrolling, designing and manipulating graphics, moving between documents, creating forms and working with a variety of fonts and styles. The Accelerator performs these remarkable feats with the aid of a 32 bit MC68020 microprocessor and a high speed hardware cache. Thanks to the cache, a technique borrowed from mainframe computer technology, there’s no need for additional memory. Which substantially reduces costs, board space and power requirements of the system. The Accelerator is available for the Macintosh 512 Enhanced, Plus and SE computers. Go much farther, much faster. Now that the Accelerator has arrived, you can go much farther in desktop publishing, much faster. But if you really want to go all the way, put the Accelerator together with the Radius Full Page Display™ This powerful combination gives you greater speed, a full-page display, and a much more productive desktop publishing system.

And little wonder. New MegaDrive from Jasmine gives you the power of a hard disk drive with the freedom of a floppy MegaDrive, the best of both worlds Macintosh Plus - Meg*! >nu Even though it gives you the best of both worlds, MegaDrive is unlike any hard disk or floppy drive you’ve ever seen before. The drive is vir- tually “crashless” and doesn’t require head clean- ing or maintenance. You can switch the 10 megabyte floppies between machines. Carr)' them in your pocket. Mail them.Throw them in a drawer. Each one is encased in 514\" hard plastic more durable than standard diskettes. The media itself is hard-sectored so you can reinitialize without losing data. MegaDrive and MegaFbppy are trademarks of Jasmine Technologies. Macintosh is a trademark licensed to Apple Computer, Inc. Product prices and specifications subject to change. Everyone wants it. Our music friends love MegaDrive because it only takes one MegaFloppy to hold a dozen floppies worth of electronic sampling. And MegaDrive performs many times faster than standard floppy drives, so you can experiment more easily with music and the Mac. But hear this: MegaDrive is so quiet even those with sensitive ears can barely hear it. Ifyou do desktop publishing you’ll definitely want a MegaDrive. Like a hard drive, it gives you the capacity you need for digitized images, artwork and whole projects. Unlike a hard drive, it keeps on growing, and growing and growing. Economically And when it’s time to take that 300-page manual to the typesetter or printer, you don’t need a series of floppies. Just one MegaFloppy: & Jasmine Technologies, Inc. 555 De Haro Street, San Francisco, CA 94107 ^ But let’s get down to business. Instead of mingling Smith with Jones on a hard drive, accountants can keep clients on separate MegaFloppy disks. Bankers can lock up the media at night without locking up drives. In departments that share a single drive, MegaDrive gives everyone their own 10MB domain. Your disk, and the information it contains, is yours alone. The same is now-’ possible in schools, hospitals and libraries where one drive serves many With MegaDrive, to each his own. Full SCSI speed and compatibility. MegaDrive hooks up to the Macintosh Small Computer Interface (SCSI) port just like a hard drive or can be daisy chained to other SCSI devices such as a Jasmine Direct Drive hard disk. Macintosh 512 Enhanced owners can upgrade to SCSI with Jasmine’s JasPort adapter for $129 without internal modifications or soldering. Price includes 30 day trial/ money back guarantee and full one year warranty Before you buy MegaDrive, consider this. Others offer a much shorter standard warranty on drives and force you to pay extra for a one year war- ranty At Jasmine we stand behind our drives. If for any reason you are not satisfied with the MegaDrive you may return it within 30 days for a full money back refund.

By raising the Mac 4 inches, providing 30° tilt, and 360° rotation, MacTilt provides the increased height and the I n business environments where operators spend long hours in front of their computer, the Mac’s small screen size and the low physical profile can cause physical discomfort and reduced productivity. A common solution to the low profile problem was to place the computer on top of a hard drive. This is no longer a solution for the Mac SE with its internal hard disk or the Mac Plus when used with a vertical hard drive or a file server. Phone books, shoe boxes, and other creative ideas have been tried to bring the Mac up to eye level, but with little success. adjustability needed to reduce glare, and to ease eye, neck and back strain. Mounting clips assure stability yet allow instant portability. MacTilt SE is designed especially for the .Mac SE. The original MacTilt fits the 128K, 512K, and the Mac Plus. It comes standard with a universal drive bracket and is available in platinum or beige.

But it could be a close race. The Apple desktop publishing system still has the lead, the edge, the technological chutzpah, and, oh yes, it still outperforms IBM’s desktop publishing system by about 200 Mac-years of product development. Maybe it’s because it’s IBM’s first time around. But whatever the reason, the turn- key PS/2 Model 30 desktop publishing sys- tem, which was announced on the same day Big Blue unveiled its next-generation Personal System/2 line of computers, is clearly a case of last year’s technology at to- morrow’s prices. In fact, if you squint at it hard enough, you’ll see that IBM’s desktop offering is vir- tually equivalent to that of a Mac-based sys- tem from nearly two years ago. I’m talking about a Mac Plus with a hard disk, Aldus’s PageMaker, and a Laser- Writer, compared with IBM’s Model 30 sys- tem (based on an 8086 microprocessor) with a hard disk, the PC version of Page- Maker, Microsoft Windows, and a Post- Script printer. Isn’t it curious that IBM has an- nounced a genuine “me-too” product after years of dismissing Apple’s approach to computer design as being some kind of technological affectation? The good news for Apple about IBM's entry into the desktop publishing world is that the Mac-based system stands out as a no-contest winner in terms of raw performance. Here are a few of the most obvious ad- vantages of the Mac system over that of IBM: Installation of the Mac desktop system is infinitely easier. It takes a full 15 minutes to install the PC PageMaker, copying five disks onto 1.5 megabytes of your hard disk. It takes less than a minute to transfer Mac PageMaker files to a hard disk or backup floppies. Windows on the IBM system limits file names to eight characters. And you still need to end files with the proper three- letter extension to open them easily from the MS-DOS Executive. Then you have to grapple with labyrinthine subdirectories. The Mac, on the other hand, has folders that you simply open and close. Screen quality, font selection, and print quality are all superior on the Mac system. Notably, Aldus’s PostScript driver for the PC PageMaker lacks the Mac Page- Maker’s smoothing algorithm that smooths the jagged edges in bit-mapped graphics. What else? I could go on and on. Per- haps the most glaring weakness of the IBM desktop system is that the controller for the PostScript printer goes into the com- puter, rather than being contained in the printer. What does that mean? It means that, if you want to hook up your IBM PS/2 30 to your laser printer, you will need to install the printer controller, which contains a PostScript processor and printer memory, so you can print out the various PostScript fonts that create beautiful text, and so you can use PageMaker. This is fine until you begin adding more computers to your system: the first computer will then have to become dedi- cated as a print server. In marked contrast, the intelligence of the Apple printer and all 1.5 megabytes of its memory are contained inside the Laser- Writer itself. It doesn’t matter how many Macs you hook up to one LaserWriter- they can all be configured equally into little work- group networks. So when you’re dealing with a work-group situation- like an edi- torial or design office or a production of- fice- it becomes a much cheaper proposi- tion to have a dozen Macs linked together to one printer.

Consumer Information Center Department TD, Pueblo, Colorado 81009 U.S. General Services Administration Remember the early speculation that IBM would take the desktop market away from Apple? It now appears that IBM is in- directly benefiting Apple, by forcing the desktop publishing market to grow, and by making the desktop concept more widely accepted throughout the corporate world. I don’t think there’s much doubt that IBM brought out its own desktop package to protect its existing customer base- those Fortune 1000-type companies that have nothing but IBM computers, from mainframes to minis to terminals and PCs. Big Blue should do very well in selling to this segment of the market. But since Apple has the definite tech- nological advantage over IBM in the desk- top field, I believe that some of the more adventuresome of even the IBM “lifers” might switch over to the Macintosh. So long as Apple continues to main- tain its edge in “usable-real-world-what- you-can-do-with-it-right-now” technology, it’ll be able to penetrate the IBM market. And as it penetrates enough of that market, it will be perceived as the number one al- ternative to Big Blue. For that matter, it’s not inconceivable that Apple will remain number one in desktop publishing. Apple could easily end up having about 60 percent of the desktop publishing market in contrast to IBM’s 20 percent, with the rest going to the clones. Be assured that Apple will not be con- tent to rest on its desktop laurels. It’s no se- cret that in the near future there will be a new multitasking operating system for the entire Macintosh line that will give Apple an even greater lead over IBM’s expanding desktop universe. And that’s all for the best. This com- petition between the two Companies is wonderful. It’s going to stimulate the devel- opment of better, cheaper, ahd more powerful products. It will keep pushing desktop publishing technology forward un- til it truly becomes publishing technology. So when you think about it, Apple and IBM are really not the dangerous adversar- ies that they’re made out to be. They are actually fellow travelers on the road to en- lightened personal computing. □ 22 July 1987 How to give your 512, Plus, or SE the hard disk performance of a Macintosh II. DataFrame highest performance drives. The new Macintosh 1 1 features a disk technology called 1 : 1 interleaving for highest performance. The DataFrame XP family of hard drives has delivered that same 1:1 performance, to any Macintosh , for over a year now. Who needs faster disk performance? Everyone. The faster the disk, the faster the Mac system. Faster program loading, faster operation, faster saves. You work faster, be- cause you wait less. That’s why Info World concluded DataFrame’s speed “shows just how good the Mac can be. 1 * “. . . leaves the others in the dust.” Info World compared. After measuring the DataFrame to be significantly faster than the Macintosh SE internal hard drive, they went on to compare DataFrame to the fast- est drive they’d seen for any computer. The result: “It left that pony in the dust, too.” Info World's conclusion: “the fastest drive we’ve tested.” Loaded with great SuperMac software — including SuperLaserSpool and DiskFit. Says MacWorld, “SuperLaserSpool is the most complete and well designed spooler available for the Mac.” And DiskFit earned the highest rating MacUscr ever awarded a backup program. Plus, True Portability. The same 1 : 1 interleave that makes Data- Frame so fast also makes it truly portable. Swap it between any Mac 1 1, SE, Plus, or 512 — with full Mac 1 1 disk performance. No other drive oilers this interchangeability. No reason to wait! Equipped with a DataFrame, your 512, Plus, or SE will outperform Apple’s new, hard- drive SE. And your Mac 1 1 will perform to its fullest potential. Visit your SuperMac dealer, and sec why over 25,000 DataFrame owners have moved into the fast lane with what MacWorld called the “Porsche among disk drives.” S u per M ac ' lech nology 295 N.

Letters A forum for Macworld readers Shareware Defined Let me try to clear up some confusion about shareware. Something that is in the public domain may be used, copied, and so on, by anyone, anytime, without restriction. Some of the software posted on electronic bulletin boards (including some of my stuff) is truly public domain. Most of it isn’t; most of it is copyrighted. Shareware (some- times called honor ware) is what most of us call copyrighted programs that an au- thor puts up on bulletin boards for others to download (usually with the stipulation that commercial distribution is forbidden), asking for payment from people who keep using the program. In the case of Other and DAKey, for example, I charge a $10 reg- istration fee. Someone who obtains the ini- tial trial copy on a $5 disk from a user group-or from me by sending a self- addressed mailer and a $5 handling fee- still needs to pay the $10 to become a reg- istered owner. Loftus Becker via CompuServe Oasis Revisited You recently mentioned my Finder replace- ment, Oasis, calling it public domain soft- ware, though it’s not. Currently there are two versions of Oasis available-version 1.3, which is shareware ( $15) available from most user groups and on-line information services, and version 1.4, which is available from me to registered owners only (send the shareware fee along with a disk and a self-addressed, stamped mailer). Version 1.3 allows you to configure up to 100 but- tons on the screen to allow launching that many applications or documents with a single click of the mouse. Version 1.4 sup- ports multiple volumes and adds a built-in disk and folder copier, along with other enhancements. Jan Huge) tides P.O Box 151 Maynard, MA 01754 More CAD Comparison As a professional CAD user of more than a dozen CAD packages on both the IBM and Macintosh computers, 1 question the con- clusions of “The CAD Comparison” in the November 1986 issue of Macworld. Key- comparison issues were not mentioned in the article. Specifically, MacDraft is a very powerful object-oriented graphics pro- gram, but it doesn’t support the object snap feature typical of most CAD applica- tions, and this severely limits its ability to create accurate layouts. MacDraft's zoom function does not satisfy the needs of power CAD users because it is not truly variable. And while EZ-Draft does have the best implementation of layers, the cur- rent version works slowly and suffers from an interface that is not Mac-like. Errors in the review' slight MGMSta- tion. It does have scroll and pan functions, an IGES translator, and it is very easy to learn and use. Professional design is my career. I use both IBM PCs and Macs and want the best tools at competitive prices. We shopped around and found MGMStation to be the most complete CAD package available at any price for the Mac. 1 calculate that I can Corrections After “Insights on Red Ryder” (April 1987) went to press, program author Scott Watson decided not to release the version he had discussed with us. Many of the article's tips are therefore moot, ex- cept to the few who downloaded the same version during the brief period Watson had it available on line. In fact, as the July issue went to press, version 10.0 still had not been released. The information phone number for Red Ryder is 314/523-2190. In “Macintosh II: Opening to the Future” in the April issue, the colors were swapped in the legend of the Mac II pro- cessing diagram (page 137): the red sec- tion shows NuBus, the blue section repre- sents 32-bit address and data. In the same issue, the Mac SE memory configu- ration diagram (page 142) contained some errors A corrected version of the diagram appears in this month's Letters.

And, the first truly portable 5 14\" system. One that lets you tote around 10,000 pages of data on a sleek cartridge about the size of a piece of bread. Translated, that’s 25 times the storage you get on one standard floppy. Yet unlike floppies, the Ibtem is no slouch for speed. It’s just as fast as a hard disk. In fact, your com- puter will think it’s a hard disk. You can even share it with co-workers. And its advanced Bernoulli aero- dynamics make it resist head crashing. If you’ve ever used hard disks, you know what a pain that can be. But the real beauty of Ibtem is that it fits per- fectly right under your Mac. No mess. No fuss. And no extra hardware to buy.

This claim is easy to make. And many users just assume that it’s true. But only Brainstorm,™ the Macintosh memory upgrade from Mac Doctor, delivers 1 to 4 mega- bytes of immediate expandabil- ity. And that’s a guarantee. When you check the fine print of most memory upgrades today, you’ll find some startling informa- tion: they’re not truly expandable! WHAT THE OTHERS WON’T TELL YOU OUTRIGHT Did you know that some '‘ex- pandable” memory upgrades require you to insert chips that don’t even exist? Or that others make you replace the entire up- grade with a new one? Maybe you’re familiar wit h upgrades that give you the mem- ory you need, but are so large they prevent you from adding an internal or external hard disk and other Mac accessories. These are not acceptable mem- ory’ upgrade situations to us at Mac Doctor, and they shouldn’t be to you either. Because now’ Brainstorm can deliver 1 memory, guaranteed expandability and a small enough size to accommo- date any accessory, all at a price within every Mac owner’s reach. EASY ENOUGH TO EXPAND YOURSELF Brainstorm is so easy to ex- pand that you can do it by your- self. You just exchange the plug- in memory module. No rebuild- ing of boards, no messing with the motherboard, and no down time waiting for your 1 memory upgrade to be expanded. Brainstorm gives you complete flexibility in upgrading from 1 to 2 or all 4 megabytes by simply exchanging the memory module. And even at 4 megabytes, Brainstorm doesn’t obstruct the 68000 CPU-it will accommodate your 1 internal hard disk as well as external drives that use clip-on many programs at once and switches betw r een them instantly. And Brainstorm’s RAM Cache loads a w’hole program into mem- ory at once. No more waiting to do your 1 job w’hile the disk drive disclaimer; it’s another Mac Doc- tor guarantee. Because in the rare event some software can’t ad- just to the higher RAM, you can switch ba ck to 512K at the click of a mouse with Brainstorm’s exclu- sive ROM Enhancer.™ SCSI ports. Brainstorm expands your memory, without penalizing you by subtracting space needed for accessories. Other upgrades simply can’t say tire same. INCLUDES PERFORMANCE SOFTWARE Most memory upgrade utility software will increase your 1 Mac’s performance to some extent. But Brainstorm not only comes with a full set of Performance Software- it also includes a com- plete User's Guide To Increased Mac Performance. Written in plain English, this user’s guide tells you how to take advantage of all the extra power that Brainstorm puts in your hands. Brainstorm’s Performance Software includes RAM disk, which runs applications 10 times fester 1 . And Switcher, w'hich rails spins endlessly every time you touch the mouse. NO FAN NEEDED ~ Even at 4 megabytes of RAM, Brainstorm runs cool. Its Pow’er- Saver and CMOS memory chips reduce memory energy consump- tion by over 50%, generating much less heat and eliminating the need for a fen. For example, a 2 meg Brainstorm runs as cool as a 128K Macintosh! 100% COMPATIBILITY WITHOUT EXCEPTION Use whatever Apple software and accessories you want with Brainstorm, because it’s fully compatible with both old and new Apple ROMs, the 400K and 800K disk drives, and all Mac and Mac Plus software. This is no idle premise with a GUARANTEES THE OTHERS CANT TOUCH Mac Doctor guarantees that Brainstorm will function without defect, or we will repair or re- place your Brainstorm free for one year.

Chipp Walters IDSA Houston, Texas A Second Opinion Ken D. Schuempe’s review of McCAD PCS in the February issue claims the pro- gram doesn’t offer the same level of sophis- tication as Wintek’s package. If by sophis- tication he means McCAD PCB doesn’t have an autorouter, then I agree. But if he means the ability to choose from a wide se- lection of options such as pad id/od, trace thickness, grids, and so on, then McCAD PCB is by far the more sophisticated and flexible product at less than half the price. I have been using both programs in my work since they were introduced, so I speak with a fair amount of hands-on experience.

Jim Zabielski Lakewood, Colorado Tlirning Back the Clock In the April 1987 issue, your response to Don Lund’s letter states that dBase Mac is limited to the Apple date scheme, which cannot handle dates earlier than January 1, 1904. In fact, our program is not con- strained to Apple’s poor choice of internal date representations. Rather, we use a long integer (32 bits) to represent the number of days since a much earlier date: January 1, 4713 B.C. The program can even show the day of the week for that date range, while taking into account the calendar changes that have taken place over the centuries. Michael D. Rossetti Asbton-Tate Glendale, California At press time Asbton-Tate bad still not shipped its long-awaited database man- ager, but when it does, the software's date handling ought to come in handy. Odesta's Helix also handles dates earlier than 1904. -Ed. Tlirning the Tables The comparison table that accompanied the December 1986 article “Writing Your Own Ticket” sold Microsoft Word version 1.05 a bit short. It does have soft hyphens (3€-hyphen), on-line help (select About MS Word on the Apple menu), and global change of fonts and type styles. The January chart comparing desktop publishing programs ought to say that ReadySetGo version 3.0 has a maximum font size of 250 points and that the program has soft hyphens. Robert Art Morgan Julian, California You're right about the soft hyphens in Word and RSG 3. 0 and Word’s on-line help. When we say global font and style change, however, we don't mean that you can select an entire document and change it all to the same new font or style. Rather, we mean the capability found in some new programs to go through a document and pick out, say, all text formatted in New York bold italic and change it to another font or style all at once. -Ed.

Until now, there were only 2 ways to buy the new Mac SET You could get it equipped with two 800K floppies. Or, with a floppy and a 20 meg internal drive. Those were your choices. We thought that was a little limit- ing. What about all the storage hungry people out tliere? People who want to outrun, outsmart and outdo the compe- tition? Well, here’s your answer. INTRODUCING THE 300 SE AND 450 SE. Before you buy your Mac SE, have your dealer replace one of its stan- dard 800K drives with our 30 meg drive (300 SE). That gives you 50% more storage. 50% more, that’s nothing to sneer at And all it will cost you is $100 over the regukir 20 meg SE price* Or if you want more storage, have our 45 meg drive (450 SE) instilled. Our drives come with shock absorbing mounts to manage the hustle and bustle of everyday use. And if you need to chain hard drives or tape drives, you can easily turn termination on or off. Plus, changing SCSI address is as easy as a push of a button. (Apple doesn’t offer any of these features.) So if you’re after die most storage a little money can buy talk to a Mirror Tech dealer.
