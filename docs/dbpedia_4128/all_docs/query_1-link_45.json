        "text": "From: davidn\n\n2009-05-20 12:57 am (UTC)\n\nThree in 24 hours! This place is practically buzzing.\n\nI actually made a post on exactly this subject a while ago, was encouraged to submit it here by kjorteo, and... never did. There seemed to be a time at some point in the early 90s when people who wrote games began to take advantage of increasing graphical ability and began to show you exactly how you died.\n\nI think that \"Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion\" was the first one that I played, and most of it wasn't too traumatic or anything, but I remember being very scared of the blade put at the start of the third level that would show you getting cut into toast-like slices if you fell down it. The later games had much bloodier deaths, but they were so over the top that they just became comical again.\n\n\"Another World\" was mentioned in the post's comments - that had varied death sequences in the sort of strange vector style of the game's artwork, but I hadn't realized before that it was a very early sort of prototype of what Fade to Black did with its full-motion video death sequences. (I remember the face-eating acid death at about 45 seconds used to terrify my youngest brother.) I'm also surprised to see it compared to Resident Evil 4 in the video comments there, because... I never thought of it like that before, but I can definitely see elements of its control scheme in there.\n\nAnd much more recently, the special Game Over sequence that you get for making a bad decision at a crucial time in Phoenix Wright: Justice for All is nothing short of heartbreaking... at least, it would be if it didn't go and ruin itself with the mega-Engrish \"The miracle never happen\".\n\nI'm going to let rakarr present Waxworks if he replies, because he showed it to me and it takes the idea to another level entirely.\n\nFinally, moving outside games but on to TV that was designed to be very game-like, the health indicator from Knightmare, which was a face that gradually broke away to form a skull, traumatized a lot of people around my age in Britain. I remember that the death bells and choir sounds combined with the last fragments of it breaking away on-screen were something to really hide behind the sofa from (hilarity of that particular death notwithstanding).\n\nFrom: ravenworks\n\n2009-05-20 01:46 am (UTC)\n\n.... Jeebus creebus that looks like a weird show.\n\nWhen you said \"Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion\", I immediately thought of another traumatizing haunted-mansion-related DOS game, that at first I assumed you were talking about -- but nope, mine was Nitemare 3D. Granted, it wasn't scary for the game over itself, so much as the process of getting there -- note how the main character's face gradually decomposes as you take damage... it was a really interesting game, with an engagingly \"believable\" environment (made out of terrible graphics, I can see in hindsight) -- but even though I only played it once at a friend's house, I can still clearly recall the horrible unsettling feeling I had watching this man's face gradually become destroyed.\n\nEdited at 2009-05-20 01:47 am (UTC)\n\nFrom: davidn\n\n2009-05-20 02:10 am (UTC)\n\nIt was! Certainly the only children's game show in which you could die. (And then get a withering remark for it before you're restored to life and sent home.) In later series the iconic skull was toned down to a walking figure that gradually became a skeleton, and then, ultimately... a cake.\n\nAnd I played Nitemare 3D (what an awkward title) a bit too, from a shareware CD, and I remember the decomposing face - rather similar to the original Knightmare health indicator, actually, seeing as the two are placed together like this! I was afraid of the Doom face for a slightly different reason - the way that seemingly at random (but actually for explicable if unlikely programmatic reasons)) it would turn into a shocked scream. I had to play with the HUD off (or a CD case blocking the relevant part of the screen, seeing as my 386 didn't work too well with it in full screen). Similarly, Blake Stone scared me a bit with its alternative health display - a heart rate monitor. I had to make sure to turn its sound off before playing.\n\nFrom: ravenworks\n\n2009-05-20 02:13 am (UTC)\n\nOh man, yeah... random, inexplicable (to the player) events in videogames. I guess that's a post on its own.... (hasn't it already been?)\n\nFrom: rakarr\n\n2009-05-20 11:39 am (UTC)\n\nWaxworks is a game I came across on YouTube rather than something I have played for myself, but as davidn has invoked my name I will swoop in and share it. This video chronicles what may be very close to all the possible deaths in the game, and although there are a few repeats with slight variations (especially towards the beginning) there are a great many unique and disturbingly detailed deaths, particularly toward the end. I would like to warn you that these really are gruesome, as well as very realistic for old computer art. Note how horrified, agonised or simply dead the character looks in most of these examples.\n\nThere is one game that I did play which scared me so much that I had to look away from it whenever I died: Arachnophobia on the Amiga. Spiders on their own are bad enough, especially when they make sharp noises when they leap at you and the protagonist's portrait shows him closer to death with each bite they deliver, but the game over screen, which shows him (or someone - given the state of the victim, it's hard to tell) dessicated, wide eyed and staring with webs and spiders all over him, was a little too much for my roughly 8-year-old mind. Unfortunately, I can't find an example.\n\nFrom: rakarr\n\n2009-05-20 12:03 pm (UTC)\n\nThere are two fairly important ones that I forgot to mention.\n\nShadow of the Beast Admidst a horde of 80s/90s titles that presented you with a skeleton or skull upon character death, this one stood out to me. I found the game itself somewhat creepy because I was quite young (you may notice a pattern of youthful masochism), but the game over screen, not despite its poignancy but because of it, really carried associations to me of lifelessness, desolation, loneliness, uncompleted goals, and darkness.\n\nShadowgate describes your unfortunate end(s) in despair-laden detail, and then you are greeted by a grinning reaper. This is the game that prompted my young self to really question whether we go to heaven when we die and in fact to ask my mother about it, which I imagine she found awkward. I was looking for reassurance, perhaps a return to innocence that I pretty much knew wouldn't be forthcoming. I guess, thinking back, that was a pretty important moment in my life. Traumatizing, indeed.\n\nFrom: kjorteo\n\n2009-05-20 06:28 pm (UTC)\n\nUm, I think both those links go to the Shadowgate clip.\n\nFrom: rakarr\n\n2009-05-21 07:34 am (UTC)\n\nWhoops. Here's the right one.\n\nFrom: kjorteo\n\n2009-05-21 07:26 pm (UTC)\n\nWow, that is indeed desolate. Not even a Game Over text or...anything, really. Even the composition--your skeleton is sort of off in the corner, and the majority of the space on the screen is empty save the background, leading me to expect some sort of Game Over text or something to appear over it eventually, but it just...never did. Actually, that's pretty artistic. Also, between that and the related videos, it becomes clear to me that you completely forgot to mention that this game apparently has the most amazing atmospheric music ever. I kind of want to play it now, though the actual gameplay footage in that second clip makes it look like a fairly average at best platformer, so maybe I won't...but it clearly has style to spare, that's for sure.\n\nFrom: rakarr\n\n2009-05-22 02:49 am (UTC)\n\nWell, I at once found it irrelevant to the game overs discussion and discernible from the the game over screen (once I managed to link the correct video, anyway), but it is an atmospheric game indeed. In combination with the slightly awkward controls, it was that very atmosphere that made me hesitant to play it in my youth (although it didn't stop me from playing other scary games, evidently). It just seemed pervasively desolate.\n\nIt didn't help that your health is represented by a heart rate which, if my memory serves me correctly, is supposed to rise rather than fall as you get hit and lead to your heart seizing or exploding or something. I don't know; it's been a while since I read the manual.\n\nFrom: kjorteo\n\n2009-05-20 06:27 pm (UTC)\n\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/arachnophobia/screenshots/gameShotId,156547/\n\nI'm not intimately familiar with this game, but that is indeed a creepy game-over screen. Anyway, helpful tip (which, as you can see from all the screenshot links, served me well in my last post): if you're looking for screenshots of something, step #1 should be to check MobyGames.\n\nFrom: davidn\n\n2009-05-21 01:14 am (UTC)\n\nAaagh! rakarr told me this morning that was traumatic, and I said that it sounded like it. Now I know beyond all doubt. Thanks a lot!\n\nFrom: rakarr\n\n2009-05-21 07:56 am (UTC)\n\nThanks for the advice. Wow, I didn't expect the picture to actually be that bad. I knew I had good reason for finding it scary as a child, but I thought that maybe my youthful brain had played it up. But no, it's still horrible. No wonder I couldn't look at it.\n\nOnce I was playing the game with my much older cousin and asked him to tell me when the game over screen had vanished so I could open my eyes. The fiend told me it was gone while it was, in fact, still there.\n\nFrom: kjorteo\n\n2009-05-20 01:09 am (UTC)\n\nUninvited had some good ones.\n\nFrom: kjorteo\n\n2009-05-20 01:09 am (UTC)\n\nAs did The Dagger of Amon Ra.\n\nFrom: kjorteo\n\n2009-05-20 01:40 am (UTC)\n\nAll right, I suppose a more elaborate explanation is in order than simply letting my icons do the talking....\n\nUninvited (and to a lesser extent, Deja Vu and Shadowgate, but Uninvited definitely takes the crown in this regard,) on top of the usual MacVenture tendency for death to come often and arbitrarily, had a nasty habit of showing an extreme close-up of whatever just killed you. My icon above is probably the worst example...very early on you run into a mysterious lady with her back turned. In true Shadowgate-style unfairness, interacting with her in absolutely any way at all or trying to leave the room through absolutely any exit except one made this happen.\n\ndavidn already mentioned Another World (or Out of This World, as my American self knows it) but it bears repeating--that game absolutely loved to show what happened when you failed in grisly detail.\n\nFrom: davidn\n\n2009-05-20 02:21 am (UTC)\n\nI've still only played Shadowgate out of those three, and the deaths were certainly frightening, mostly in the way that they were played up in the very morbid language that the game tended to use. You aren't just \"eaten by a shark\" - \"As you swim toward the skeleton, you feel the jaws of a shark grab you and pull you under. You curse yourself for using your body as bait!! Even before the life has escaped your body, the lake will be filled with your blood.\" But it was the music... the music! that got to me most of all. The more unnatural sound is (8-bit waves or early Adlib attempts at instruments), the scarier it can often be.\n\nOn the other hand, Shadowgate's protagonist was so eager that I became desensitized to death after a while and was just increasingly astonished by his stupidity. \"Aha! A well! Must... jump... INTO IT!\" And the classic result of looking at a window.\n\n\"With a cry you jump to your death!\"\n\n\"You flaming moron.\"\n\nFrom: kjorteo\n\n2009-05-20 02:24 am (UTC)\n\nShadowgate did have one thing going for it to unintentionally break the unrelenting horror of \"how many ways can we describe this moron literally killing himself with every random object in sight,\" and that's the fact that some of the descriptions are reused and applied to objects where they really shouldn't be applied. And by that I mean the sword and the sledgehammer. And by that I mean \"you plunge the hammer into your chest. Blood pours from the wound....\"\n\nFrom: wrathfulenglish\n\n2009-05-21 03:18 am (UTC)\n\nThe game over for Banjo-Kazooie is well-known for being unsettling. Banjo's fate is unknown, the evil Gruntilda is transformed into an unsettlingly attractive vamp, Mumbo seemingly turns on you, Tootie's a monster... and she blames you for her fate. But what made it especially bad was not the scene itself, but the fact that it was utterly unavoidable. Even if you just save and quit, you'd get that screen. The only way to banish it forever was to rescue Tooty, which would just give you the letters \"Game Over\" whenever you quit. I don't remember being frightened by it, exactly, but it did creep me out.\n\nOne that did traumatize me was the non-standard game over for Rayman 2. You get it if, after the aptly-named Cave of Bad Dreams level, you choose the treasure instead of the potion that can cure your friend, Clark. Which is automatically selected when you get to the cave. And if you're like me and love to mash A, you will accidentally select it. At which point, you're treated to a lovely scene of fat Rayman lounging on a beach while the world falls apart around him. I'm not sure why that creeped me out so much, but it scared me so badly I couldn't touch the game for six years. And even then, it was with heavy trepidation.\n\nAnd while it's recent? The instant death you get if you fall into lava wearing the Zora Tunic in LoZ: Twilight Princess. I can't find a clip of this, but.... yeeeuurg.\n\nFrom: crassadon\n\n2009-05-21 04:07 pm (UTC)\n\nBanjo-Kazooie's game over screen bothered me, too. What with it being such a large game, it's very unlikely one will complete it in one sitting, so the game over screen seemed cruel and unnecessary: I'm just taking a break! I'll be back to save the world tomorrow!\n\nFrom: zaodai\n\n2009-05-21 09:18 pm (UTC)\n\nMost Game Overs don't really bother me, but there's one that stands out from my youth, enough to make me never play the game again (despite the fact it's a staple of every gamer of my generation). Zelda 2, for the NES.\n\nI played it once at a friend's house, when I was maybe 5 or 6, and when you lose, a big (to me at the time) silhouette of Gannon comes up and there's this creepy laugh behind it. I know the laugh can't be nearly as creepy as my memory is telling me it is now, because the NES wasn't capable of sounds like that.\n\nBut at the time, it scared the living hell out of me. I didn't want to play it again, on the off chance I'd screw up and get laughed at by giant shadow Gannon again.\n\nFrom: zephyre_syx\n\n2009-05-23 10:42 pm (UTC)\n\nI was the kind of player that gets emotionally involved into the game, and all that cheesy stuff.\n\nNintendo Ultra Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It was the water stage, you have to go through the water to deactivate the bombs before the time runs out. My genius of a dad decided to find out what happen if he touches the seaweed. The instant death animation of the turtle being eaten alive was enough for me to let my dad play through the water level for now on.\n\nNintendo Joe and Mac at the man eating plant. I was like, \"cool, I alway wanted to play Joe and Mac.\" It was a long time, but electronic gaming monthly have convince me that the game is pretty damn awesome. Unfortunately, we don't own a snes, nor a genesis. But joy, it came out for the regular NES. I was finally enjoying beating up cavemans and dinosaurs with various of weapons.\n\n...Til the second stage. That's where I found out what happens if you jump too close to the man-eating plant. Joe would no matter if you didn't physically touch the plant would fall right on in, the plant tasting, chewing, and digesting, and vomit my skeletons for me to see.\n\nGauntlet II was a bit worse. The game actually tells you are about to die, and the heart throbbing noise playing in the background. And when you die, you turn into a skeleton. I had my parents sent the game back, I could not stand it.\n\nYep, any game with gruesome death I tend to avoid, because I get into the game character too much. Heck, I didn't like violent game back then, and was pretty glad that the ESRB guys came out. No more \"Suprise! Your head got torn off.\" =D\n\nEvery now and then today, I would remark and laugh at what would traumatize me like the hive for GBA, a isometric metroid/megaman. There's an infection that's try to take over and if you don't sterilize it on time, you turn into a monster. The first time I died she fell on her side and started to goop up and shift into some naked abominous being on four legs, then it flick it's head toward the screen and hissed. I was like \"wow, that was nicely disturbing\" as I giggle (and shuttered). I know mario galaxy would have got me frighting too whenever I fall into those black holes. The sound bellows as mario screams as he gets sucked in.\n\nFrom: wrathfulenglish\n\n2009-05-27 05:24 pm (UTC)\n\nOoooh! Someone else who's played Scurge: The Hive. That is one freaky non-standard game over. Thanks to the time limit, that game is actually pretty intense...\n\nFrom: davidn\n\n2009-05-25 11:53 am (UTC)\n\nI thought of another after making my recent post - in Descent, normally when you ran out of shields you'd just spin round a bit and explode, your powerups being scattered around the immediate area for you to collect again. But if you died while the reactor was exploding, or as a result of it, then there wouldn't be a level to send you back into - instead, it sent you on to the next one with this message:\n\nYou died in the mine. Your ship and its contents were incinerated.\n\nThanks."
