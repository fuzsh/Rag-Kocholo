        "text": "ROBERT JONES Twitter @rnicholasj This month Got lost in the PC Gamer magazine archive while digging out past issues. Was berated by Murray the Talking Skull. From the moment I started reading this grand old magazine back in the mid-1990s, I had no idea that it would go on to be the cultural touchstone it has become, nor that I would ever get the immense privilege to be editor of it. After all, PC Gamer has been here through it all. From Doom to Half-Life 2 to this year’s seminal Baldur’s Gate III, this magazine has always been there reporting on PC gaming’s biggest events and culture with authority as well as plenty of humor, too. As such, it is a huge personal honor to present this landmark celebration of 30 years of PC gaming. This is…\n\nThe Steam accounts of multiple game developers were recently compromised and used to update their games with malware. Fewer than 100 Steam users had the games installed when the malware was added, and they’ve been directly notified of the risk by email, according to Valve. The company confirmed details of the intrusion to PC Gamer. The updates potentially containing malware were “reverted and purged” within hours, and Valve advised any player with the games in question installed to run a full system scan with some decent anti-virus software. Although this attempt to use Steam to distribute malware wasn’t particularly effective, Valve has taken a major step to prevent it from happening again. From October 24, game developers are required to pass a two-factor authentication check before updating the default branch of a…\n\nWhen Gabe Amatangelo stepped into the director role for Cyberpunk 2077 in May 2021, morale among the team was low. The RPG had sold 13 million copies, yet was plagued with bugs and ran so poorly on older consoles it was pulled from sale on the PlayStation Store. CD Projekt’s stock price cratered. Cyberpunk’s former director had left CDPR after an investigation into workplace bullying. So when Amatangelo said yes to the job, that yes came with conditions. “Part of my conversation at the beginning with my boss and the board was: I believe in the team, I believe in this IP, but I want to do it right. And I’m going to need the support to do that,” says Amatangelo. “And they’re like, yes, you have the support.” From that…\n\nMusic captured Jason Graves at a young age, and never let him go. After becoming enamored with John Williams’s ET soundtrack, music became “an emotional touchpoint” for him. Singing lessons, piano lessons, and musicals were just the beginning; he’s been performing music in one way or another since elementary school. Graves went on to learn a variety of instruments, and in college majored in music. “I thought I was going to be an educator or a performer of some sort,” he says, “but I decided that what I really wanted to do was attempt to write the kind of music that emotionally charged me as a kid, and even now”. Thus he switched from general music study to composition. Today, Graves is an experienced composer, with an enviable CV that encompasses games,…\n\nIn 20 years of Call of Duty baton-passing, Modern Warfare 3 presents a unique opportunity for persnickety fans like myself: Sledgehammer has been entrusted a direct sequel to Infinity Ward’s Modern Warfare 2 reboot just a year after its release, with the same engine and full backwards compatibility with MW2’s guns and attachments. I imagine this is a pretty big deal for Sledgehammer. The Bay Area studio has spent a decade playing third fiddle to its more senior Infinity Ward and Treyarch collaborators, serving as a support studio when necessary and garnering a reputation as the “offbeat” CoD studio with Advanced Warfare (2014), WW2 (2017), and Vanguard (2021)—all entries that tried to reach beyond where CoD was, and either fell flat or didn’t make a significant mark in series canon. Simply…\n\nEver since FPS Dust 514’s 2013 debut and subsequent flaming out, a sizable segment of EVE Online fans have wanted one thing: Dust 2. The idea is something of a white whale for developer CCP: a first-person shooter that inhabits the same universe as its space MMO. EVE Vanguard is not Dust 2, however, because this time things have to be different. CCP is being extra cautious about how it frames Vanguard. This is a “module” of EVE Online being developed by CCP’s London studio in Unreal Engine 5, which will open its doors for a beta test in December 2023, and be asynchronously connected to EVE Online via a mechanic called corruption. The difference with Vanguard is that it’s designed on the core EVE Online principle of a sandbox experience where…"
