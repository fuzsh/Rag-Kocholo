        "text": "This was surprisingly a great experience! Like many others, I heard of this through the Beyond Shadowgate kickstarter. (I can't believe you're working on it!)\n\nI like how many of the puzzle elements played out (especially with the recorder, I thought that was neat) and forging the flame thrower definitely harkens back to when we first made The Staff of Ages. The music is something I can easily hear Kemco doing back in the day. Despite the short length, you can clearly see the passion you have for this genre and I can't wait to see what you do in the future, both in Beyond Shadowgate and your own original projects.\n\nI do have exactly just one complaint: The Deaths.\n\nMost of the deaths are read something like this:\n\n\"creature ate/attacked you, you died\"\n\nI personally found this a little boring or unsatisfying. The thing that made Shadowgate, Uninvited and even Deja Vu's deaths memorable weren't just how creatively dumb your character can bite the dust, but also how morbid and gruesome the details that were given.\n\nTo this day, I remember when I first read the Shark death in Shadowgate. Compare having to read\n\n\"Even before the life has escaped your body, the lake will be filled with your blood\"\n\nwith\n\n\"you touched the slime, it takes seconds to cover your body and you died painfully\"\n\nDid it dissolve me like the slime trap in Shadowgate?\n\nIs it a living creature that suffocated me?\n\nHow did it actually kill me? (Especially when I had to collect a sample of the damn thing to solve the plant puzzle)\n\nThe environment, the monsters and the item deaths were well thought out (I specifically found the teleporter death to be very creative), but the description of the deaths left a lot to be desired. Even the simplest of the many ridiculous deaths in Shadowgate explained that you couldn't survive, whether it was because you had broken every limb after you fell, or the glass shards from breaking the wrong mirror tore through you.\n\nThat being said, I cannot wait to see how the remake of this game improves. I very much look forward to more of your work in the future. Keep up the great work!\n\nComing from the \"Beyond Shadowgate\" kickstarter here. Glad to discover there is more adventure games to be played here!!!\n\nUnfortunately, I'm running on a Mac, and although it seems you support it for \"Infested\" (unlike \"Spectacle\"), it seems that at least for the latest macOS major release (macOS 13 Ventura) it doesn't work. When double-clicking it to launch it says \"The developer of this app needs to update it to work with this version of macOS.\".\n\nAvailable for testing to help you solve this! FYI I'm a Mac developer too so I won't shy away from any tech stuff you might throw at me.\n\nSeems others are having the same issue with Gamemaker Studio: https://forum.gamemaker.io/index.php?threads/steam-games-wont-launch-on-macos-13-ventura-but-do-work-on-macos-12-monterey.99348/\n\nSo, I must say -- I am playing through infested again and I think there is one very vital aspect that goes unnoticed quite a bit that I highly appreciate the effort put into.\n\nThe movement screen transitions actually adjust to where you're moving. Like when I moved from the viewing area to the door before the blood monster, move one showed a straight transition upwards and then it showed a leftward transition before releasing the player back to the interactive gaming screen. This is exactly how the character would have moved and it's a neat little \"polish\" so-to-speak :).\n\nI just had to share. Even the original 3 MacVentures didn't go to that level of attention to detail :). I may not have the exact screen-movement-direction nailed down, but just wanted to let ya know I see what you did there :D\n\nLet me start by saying, that I think this project is absolutely fantastic. It's fun and definitely brings back some nostalgia. I grew up in the 90's playing Shadowgate for NES and always found the MacVenture games to be amazing. I was always pretty disappointed that there were so few of them. I was working on a Shadowgate video for my channel and BAM! You popped up! \"Infested\" is such a great ride and it makes me so happy to see that people are making these style of games again. I was actually planning on learning how to code so I could create my own tribute to the genre.\n\nGrahfmetal, I greatly appreciate the work that your team has done and look forward to playing \"Spectacle\" next. Please, please, PLEASE, tell me you guys have another project you're currently working on because I'm so geeked on this first game, that you probably have a fanboy for life due to the incredible amount of respect I have for you guys.\n\n(By the way, loved the \"Lakmir\" and \"ICOM\" references. Top notch!)\n\nJeff, Jason and Orie — I just want say thank you for this fantastic game. I grew up playing Shadowgate, Uninvited, Deja Vu, as well as countless other point-and-click adventure games. Nothing has haunted me (in a lasting, good way) more than my experiences with Shadowgate. I stumbled upon INFESTED when checking on updates for some horror games I was following. I immediately downloaded and installed INFESTED when I saw the KEMCO influence. I don't like reading about a game's contents or reviews if I can help it — so what followed was a completely blind (no commentary) playthrough of the game:\n\nINFESTED absolutely nails tribute to those NES era games in design, graphics, audio and presentation. To top it all off, it takes place in a unique setting that those games never occupied — unless you include beyond a certain mirror). I felt that same horrifying dread from decades ago return as I stepped into new rooms, never sure when I was safe from harm. Lastly, the music is outstanding and completely nails the \"macabre whimsy\" that the NES-era games had. If INFESTED is any indication of quality, I know SPECTACLE is going to be quite an experience. I will be doing a blind playthrough of SPECTACLE soon.\n\nI have read every single comment on this page as of this post and it seems everyone shares the same sentiment. If I had any additional criticisms, it'd have to be the following:\n\nThe game's setting/atmosphere was so engrossing that the rare typos momentarily took me out of the experience. I'm sure you've moved onto SPECTACLE updates and other projects, but if you are interested, I'd be more than happy to do another thorough pass of INFESTED to grab all the typos I could find if you ever feel like correcting them.\n\nAs you can see in my blind playthrough above (at 12:50), I tossed the \"BLOOD PACK\" at the slime creature but then spent the entirety of my playthrough worrying if there was a hidden time limit. This is because of the one bit of text that says, \"It is very focused on the bloodpack, for the moment.\" The \"for the moment\" led me to believe that the slime creature was only temporarily distracted (\"How many screen transitions or actions can I take until it eats the blood and finds me or kills me when I pass it?\"), when in reality, it was in a permanent state of 'occupied until disturbed'. I felt like my time limit worries were justified because, in addition to the above, my suspension of disbelief could only stretch so far: This thing rips me apart and devours me whole — with that kind of ferocious hunger, a \"BLOOD PACK\" shouldn't last that long! It would have been really helpful if after tossing the \"BLOOD PACK\" at the slime creature that the text said something like, \"Satiated, it seems to have stopped moving. Better not get too close.\" (I wouldn't dare suggest an additional sprite of the slime creature with its eyes closed, though that would be amazing.) That way, if a player does any of the wrong things the game currently has programmed, it can 'wake up' per usual and attack the player when 'disturbed' from eating the \"BLOOD PACK\".\n\nAs you can see in my blind playthrough above (at 18:06), I end up tossing in \"CHEM.A\" before I even knew there was a mixture that would need to be made — I especially didn't know that there was a specific formula. To top it off, I didn't even know why I was putting \"CHEM.A\" in there, just that I thought I could maybe kill the man-eater plant in the vent that I found in the beginning. My point is, I hadn't even seen the actual roots in the Lab yet, nor that there was a sprinkler in there. I feel as though there isn't a logical reason that the player's character would think to dump chemicals in there so soon (and arguably even less-so for players themselves). I think it would be more effective if the player said, \"I think it's best not to mess with this yet,\" when attempting to OPEN or USE the nutrient injector — or at the very least, when they are trying to put things into it. Then, when the player investigates the \"SLIME SLIDE\" and the formula is revealed, they could then be able to USE the nutrient injector or put things into it. I know that this adds a few mandatory steps in order to complete the game but this would only affect speedrunners as a new player would need to find out the formula anyways. Ever since I put in that first \"CHEM.A\", I spent the entirety of my playthrough, up until I finally killed the plants, worrying if I had broken the game or created a \"walking dead\" scenario.\n\nI know these suggestions add a lot more work to the game (especially the last two), but they had a profound impact on the game's feel for me. While my criticisms take up more than half of my post, it's only because I wanted to be as descriptive and thorough as possible. This game is absolutely phenomenal, and like others have stated, I would gladly pay money for continued games of this genre & caliber.\n\nThank you for your hard work, dedication and passion. You've made such a phenomenal creation.\n\nThank you so much. It brought us so much reading your comment. It's so amazing meeting so many passionate Shadowgate fans on here. When I (Jeff) was younger I eagerly anticipated the 4th entry in the NES series and predicted it would be on a space station, but when it never came, I was sad that the sub-genre kinda died off. Cut to many years later and we decided lets make it ourselves for fun and take a nostalgic trip. We actually thought that only a handful of people would play it and we never thought we would get so many amazing messages from awesome people :D\n\nAs for the criticisms and suggestions; they're all spot on and excellent ideas. We LOVE receiving constructive criticism and feedback, it's made us want to revisit Infested for a while now in order to do some tweeking here and there, which we may yet still do. We actually considered reworking the Chemical puzzle so that you NEED to use a slime sample on the slide and microscope first before dumping any of the chemicals.\n\nThe blood pack \"...for the moment\" quote is actually something I never really thought of beyond \"This'll make the player sweat\". But I like the idea of it being satiated and stop moving unless you disturb it.\n\nAs for the typos; no need to do a pass, we've already done that, but we really appreciate the offer. That means a lot\n\nThanks again for your comment, it means the world to us to read stuff like this and hear about other fans of the sub genre. Also, thanks for the video, I'll be checking that out very shortly.\n\nHope you enjoy Spectacle, if you're a fan of Uninvited than there's a few treats in there for you :D\n\nI was really excited to check out this game. The description and comments led me to think it was a modern addition to the very niche menu-based point and click genre. But unfortunately, I was disappointed with what I found. The lack of an EAT verb (a staple of \"MacVentures\") soured my experience right from the start. And when I discovered I could not defeat the slime monster with the stethoscope (a classic trope), I knew this was a shallow attempt at recreating \"MacVenture\" games. I couldn't bring myself to play beyond that point.\n\njokes aside, this game was awesome, as literally every other person has pointed out :) excellent work. i look forward to spectacle's release!"
