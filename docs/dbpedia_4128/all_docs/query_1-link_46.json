        "text": "It’s that time of year again, ladies and gentlemen. Award Season. The time of year where we can look at the various industry events being put on by industry executives to pat the industry on the back and tell the industry it did such a good job.\n\nOkay, a bit cynical at the start here, let’s lighten the mood.\n\n2023 has been an outright excellent year for games this year. Now to immediately darken the mood, it’s been a terrible year for the industry as a whole, as companies see record profits and cut back on positions, cementing a chokehold over labor in anticipation for further unionization of the industry. That, and we’ve been seeing game studios moving towards the use of ‘AI’ machine learning to try to replace artists and voice actors, like with the NEXON-backed Embark Studios’ ‘The Finals’, in an attempt to squeeze even more profits and screw over more creators.\n\nSo to my fellows in 2024 and beyond: Make those votes count. Unionize. Don’t give those corpo bastards a goddamn inch, because you deserve every cent that you fight for. You are what gives them profit and fame, don’t you let them tell you otherwise. And if that means that titles have to release slower, or have to have less or rely less on realism and more on a cohesive art direction then go right ahead.\n\nBut as an outside observer, I can only give my outside thoughts to the struggle of the developers. If you want to hear more about how these cuts have truly hurt folks, and the ways that you can help, you can view these sources below, which help to highlight that plight better than I could articulate:\n\n* First, the website http://www.videogamelayoffs.com/ (the security certs on the site are not up to date, so be careful) has been tracking the news of layoffs, and are recent up to the 14th of December. Currently, around 9,000 people have lost jobs this year in the industry.\n\n* Paul Tassi, for Forbes (@PaulTassi on Twitter) has been tracking the Bungie Layoffs extensively.\n\n* Nicole Carpenter did an excellent piece for Polygon about how the layoffs are hurting the industry as a whole.\n\n* Rob Fahey wrote about the layoffs as compared to the billions made by the studios.\n\nMy mission here is to talk about their results, the craft they’ve created for the year, and damn has it been an excellent menu of creations to choose from. People talk about the ‘Best years of gaming’, the years that have the releases that defined the genres for decades to come, the ones that helped to set the trends that people walk in today, and though 2023 may not have had a lot of ‘genre-defining’ titles, it did have some excellent entries. And a lot of them!\n\nSo here I’ll endeavor to categorize my thoughts, giving each section it’s own due. The categories won’t exactly line up with other awards shows, as there might be some overlap, but I hope that it gives an informative look nevertheless.\n\nOnwards, to the first topic!\n\nThe Rise of the Indie-Like\n\nOne thing that I, and several others in the space, have noticed is that this year has shown a fairly interesting and alarming trend of a game being marketed as ‘Indie’, when in fact the game was being made with the budget that’d pay more in taxes than most people make in a year.\n\nOne of the largest examples is ‘Dave the Diver’. An excellent game in many ways: Colorful, with a rewarding gameplay loop and excellent soundtrack, a ton of things to collect, various regions to explore and a host of game modes underneath the hood that leaves you guessing and anticipating what they will come up with next. Mint Rocket, the South Korean team that developed it, is a bottom-up focused small developer studio that focuses on the experience first, placing a priority on enjoyment and creativity.\n\nWhich is what their press kit tells you, because Mint Rocket is owned by NEXON, one of the world’s largest developers. And when I mean ‘largest’, I mean NEXON are the people behind Dungeon & Fighter (DNF) and MapleStory, billion-dollar properties that are still making revenue to this day. And those are just the ones you might have heard of. They’re also the people backing ‘The Finals’, the AI-riddled team shooter I mentioned above. They are not short of money, but perhaps short of scruples.\n\nDave the Diver may have the appearance and trappings of an indie game, and may even market itself as one, but how can a game be considered ‘independent’ when it’s funded by a billion-dollar MMO giant like NEXON?\n\nBut this isn’t exactly a new thing for this year. Another excellent game that was called an ‘Indie’ game, though not nominated as such, is Hi-Fi Rush. An excellent action-rhythm game hybrid that puts you in control of Chai, a wannabe rocker with a robot arm smashing his way through an army of robots using the power of Rock and Roll. A powerful and distinct art style that pops out like a comic book or Saturday morning cartoon, a forgiving yet frantic combat system that doesn’t punish you for having that bad of a sense of rhythm but rewards you for excellent timing, and an incredible soundtrack that allows you to beat the ever-loving nonsense out of a mechanical monster while set to songs by The Prodigy and Nine Inch Nails. It fucking slaps, go play Hi-Fi Rush, it’s great.\n\nIt’s also by Bethesda and their subsidiary, Tango Gameworks. The same people that made the Evil Within series and Ghostwire: Tokyo. It was produced by video game legend Shinji Mikami. It’s about as far from an ‘indie’ title as you can get, despite everything about the game being as far from the realism-focused, heavy budget titles put out this year. But it has the same right to the title of ‘Indie’ as Dave the Diver does. If it can get a nomination due to being a subsidiary of a multi-billion gaming giant and if it doesn’t look like a AAA title, then what’s stopping Hi-Fi Rush?\n\nAnd as we look at the games up for nomination as “Best Indie Game”, we see even more of this. Cocoon, the winner for this years 2023 Indie Game of the Year award, is published by Annapurna Interactive, a game publisher that reaches out to smaller developers and offers them funding and expertise. But it is also spearheaded by Jeppe Carlsen, one of the lead developers of Limbo and Inside, who left Playdead Studios. When your game is headed by a company led by an industry veteran and published by a massive gaming house, can it still be considered ‘independent’? One could also ask this of Viewfinder, another nominee, published by Thunderful games, the publishers behind the successful ‘Steamworld’ series of games, as well as a host of other titles like Laika: Aged Through Blood, that could be considered for these awards.\n\nWhile these games are worth playing if they interest you, and I am not going to immediately discredit them as being bad because they are not ‘indie’, there is a question that should be asked about what defines the ‘indie-ness’ of a title whenever it involves a massive amount of publisher funding in order to get the title out the door. Especially when there are other games out there without those funding giants behind them that could be nominated in their place.\n\nWhich leads me in to:\n\nSquidRadio’s Indie Hits of the Year\n\nLike I said, these are going to be different. I think that highlighting one game above the others when it comes to the field of Indie games is a bit crass, given that Indie game development is often a collaborative affair. Sure, they may be competing in the market, but Indie developers have been, for the most part, an opening and helpful group of people even as I endeavor to create my own game.\n\nSo, in that spirit, I’m not going to do a ‘best of’ in the Indie category, but instead focus on the highlights of the year, the titles that I think you should check out. Of course, please check out the Game Awards nominees if they interest you. Dredge just released a DLC, Pizza Tower has an excellent modding community, and Venba is a beautiful experience. But also check out:\n\nBomb Rush Cyberfunk: You hear the term ‘love letter’ passed around in games a lot when it comes to titles that seek to reach into the past for inspiration, but few of them ever feel like a proper use of the term. Many of them see the trappings of what was one celebrated and great and try to emulate those trappings rather than doing them justice in the modern era, which makes it seem less like love for the series and more like the desire to reach the same sales figures.\n\nBomb Rush Cyberfunk, developed by Team Reptile, is not one of those examples.\n\nBRC, from the moment it starts off in a New Amsterdam police station to the last moments tagging and tricking between the skyscrapers of the city, feels like an honest celebration of it’s varied inspirations. The bright color palette and wild artistry of the city are clearly inspired by Jet Set Radio but also are far better designed to navigate and explore, while the free flowing trick system with the game’s three modes of transport calls back to the ‘extreme sports’ genre popularized by Tony Hawk while adding in boosters and tagging spots to force you to think about how you traverse and combo. By tying the scoring mechanic to the levels themselves (You build combo off of traversal techniques like corner grinds and wallrides, not by spamming tricks) the game leads you to look at the city in a new light, to discover the best routes to get those big numbers and unlock new dances, tags, areas and rivals.\n\nAnd while the story might be a bit thin (with some interesting twists here and there), the gameplay and soundtrack are less about a cinematic experience and more about the ‘vibes’. Going to your home base and hearing ‘Lightswitch’ by Skyblew playing as you explore is hard to describe, but the feeling is palpable. It’s something that needs to be experienced before it can be discussed.\n\nAdding it together makes for an engaging, intense ride through a vibrant city, backed by an amazing score filled with independent and established artists that help to nail the feel of the world.\n\nLunacid: When I was first made aware of Lunacid, it was mostly an idle curiosity (Huge thanks to Iron Pineapple and his Steam Dumpster Dive series for bringing this game to my attention) as I had never played the King’s Field games before. The closest I came was ‘Eternal Ring’, which I borrowed from a friend and only sorta remember. So going into Lunacid would be a first-time experience for me.\n\nAnd damn, what an experience it is.\n\nLunacid is a game that, while clearly inspired by King’s Field, stands on it’s own merits easily without any sort of nostalgia needed to enhance it. From the dreary and dark settings of the caves you awaken in, the game throws you in the deep end quickly. Hollow Basin and Wing’s Rest help to set the tone, but as you continue to venture out and explore, expanding your world map by map and fight by fight, the game shows an incredible desolate beauty throughout. And while it may take some time getting used to the first-person combat and the Lunacy mechanic inherent with spellcasting, even these flourishes help to build a world that is plagued by horrors both mundane and mystic, and makes the sense of accomplishment feel amazing.\n\nAnd as you progress and find new spells, you’ll notice that a lot of them are more about function than result. Creating rock bridges and walls may seem like defensive options, but then become traversal mechanics to allow you access to areas you couldn’t reach prior. Now those high spots don’t seem nearly as impossible to reach, leading you to creating new paths and solutions to encounters and exploration. It’s a game with a sense of personal and environmental discovery, lovingly crafted and animated to invoke an age long past.\n\nPseudoregalia: 3D platforming is, in some respects, an art form.\n\nIf you want to know what I mean, look up a speedrun of Mario 64, or The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Or look up videos on Mario Odyssey and the challenge mode they included, forcing you to master your movement in order to reach another player’s flags. The precision, control and focus required to pull off these movements can be frustrating, but feel amazing when brought together to make the impossible seem possible.\n\nPseudoregalia is a game built around that feeling. There is little story to focus on: You play as Sybil, finding yourself in a crumbling castle beset by monsters, and need to find a way out. With your Dream Breaker and your movement, explore and find the keys you need to open the door at the top of the high tower. Like I said, simple.\n\nBut it is in how the game manages that movement that Pseudoregalia shines. Exploring the castle leads you to finding new items, like the wallkick and long jump, that then create brand new methods for exploring and change how the game plays drastically. Once you get the long jump and discover that you keep momentum when you crouch at the end of the jump, you’ll be using it as your main method to gain and keep speed. The wallkick can preserve forward momentum or give you an extra burst of height, meaning that exploring with it now gives you even more things to test it on and see what works.\n\nThe game thrives on forcing you to traverse, giving you a new tool for traversal, then seeing how you use that tool to better explore the castle and find your way to the top, and those moments can feel so incredibly rewarding when you get the execution done right.\n\nRusted Moss: On the other hand, 2D platforming isn’t quite as artistic or challenging.\n\nWhile there can be incredible technical skill involved, the lack of depth can lead to a sense of repetition when it comes to navigation. It’s one of the reasons why Metroidvania-style games tend to have a problem when it comes to traversal: We have these solutions already. Dashing, double-jump, specific item for specific roadblock or barrier. It’s one of the downsides of the genre, but one of it’s deepest conventions, making it hard to find a solution without leaving the player feeling like they’ve been unduly hampered.\n\nRusted Moss goes ‘fuck that, you get a grapple hook and that’s it’ and they made one of the best traversal systems in a 2D platforming game in years.\n\nThe game uses this one grapple hook in an interesting way: by making it elastic and tying the physics of your character to it’s behavior, Rusted Moss then gives you reasons to experiment with it. What distance should I be when I fire it to start my swing? What happens if I catch a ledge while I am falling down, shooting me back upwards with the extra momentum? What would happen if I used my rocket launcher to apply momentum at the end of my swing or on my jump? What if I combine a rocket jump, reach max fall speed, then hook a ledge as I’m falling down?\n\nWhereas other games would develop their world around the growth of powers and the expanding moveset your character gains through exploration, Rusted Moss gives you the tool to start out and then adds to it later. But you always have that initial item, the solution to nearly every problem, and it makes traversal feel rewarding in a way that a lot of other 2D exploration games don’t. The first time I figured out that I could use my shotgun recoil to give myself a bit of boost at the end of a swing to help slingshot me across a death pit?\n\nBy giving you this open-ended tool with a specific ruleset, then building the world around that tool, Rusted Moss allows you to experiment and explore your movement in ways that a lot of other 2D games don’t by virtue of convention. What might, at first, seem like a limiting factor becomes an excuse to go and see what craziness you can perform while exploring a dying world.\n\nMy Friendly Neighborhood: I wrote a whole article HERE about why I love this game and why it needs more of a spotlight.\n\nLoddlenaut: Sometimes, you just want something cute. Relaxing, simple, easy, and not overstaying it’s welcome. And that’s Loddlenaut.\n\nYou are a planetary janitor, arriving down on GUP-14 to help clean up the polluted ocean left by the company that sent you, and bring back biodiversity. It’s a game that, if you are paying attention, has no real threat to you outside of your oxygen meter and your inventory size. And it’s adorable, the blobby simple color palette working well with the rounded, soft style. It’s a game that you play when you want to relax and do something nice for a change. And the Loddles are cute, and you can pet them.\n\nAmazing.\n\nFading Afternoon: What does life mean to a man who doesn’t live?\n\nFading Afternoon, a game by solo developer Yeo (‘The Friends of Ringo Ishikawa’, ‘Arrest of a Stone Buddha’) is a game about an old Yakuza fresh out of jail, going back to the old office of his sworn brother and finding a criminal life that is a shadow of what it once was. The times are changing, the money doesn’t come in like it used to, and every morning Seiji Murayama awakens, coughs up a little blood, and loses just a little more health. And you won’t get it back.\n\nThe clock is ticking. What does it mean to live when you don’t live long?\n\nYeo’s games all revolve around this central theme of what life means to the people who live it, and Fading Afternoon follows that tradition well. Whether you decide to spend your last days carving a bloody path of conquest to rebuild your sworn brother’s empire on the backs of your defeated rivals, or spend your days drinking and playing pool, or even going to find love and a life of peace with your final days, the choice ultimately rests with your actions.\n\nWhat does life mean? Whatever meaning you give it.\n\nWorld of Horror: Okay, this one is a bit cheating since it’s been ‘out’ for a while, but World of Horror had it’s 1.0 release this year and you owe it to yourself to check it out. Or at least go watch the release trailer.\n\nSome of the first games I ever played were the MacVenture series: Uninvited and Deja Vu on old Apple 2 computers my dad brought back and fixed up from the junkyard. Black and white, barely any music or sound effects, convoluted messes.\n\nBut what if they were kept like that, but improved in almost every way? And given inspiration from supernatural horror? You get one of the best bite-sized horror experiences out there.\n\n— — — -\n\nThe Season of Revival\n\nAnd there were a lot of these this year as far as remakes, remasters, re-imaginings, all sorts of things that you might not have experienced the first time that are new and fresh and probably different in a lot of ways than the last time you touched them.\n\nGames, as a medium, are in a strange place now. We’re in an era where our greatest works are getting up on age, and while we still remember them fondly, we want to improve them with modern comforts and innovations to bring them up to speed. And that, in some instances, is fine. In others it can be a bit strange (Looking at you, Last of Us) but it’s natural to want more from our past.\n\nSo this is a time to celebrate the return of old legends and the remastering of old favorites.\n\nArmored Core 6: When this got announced, I didn’t believe it at first.\n\n“When’s the new Armored Core” has been a bit of a running joke among the FromSoft fanbase, given how the studio shifted to focus on the Souls series of games and the various versions thereof (Bloodborne, Sekiro and Elden Ring, in varying amounts), while ignoring their flagship mecha action game since Verdict Day for about a decade. But then the trailer dropped.\n\nFuel the Fire. Let the Last Cinders Burn. And we’re so fucking back.\n\nArmored Core is, in many aspects, some of the truest examples of FromSoft’s developing prowess and philosophy. NPCs are faceless and only go by code-names, but are given such life and distinction through their performances and actions that they become their own stories. Combat is fast and brutal and, in FromSoft fashion, almost completely up to you to win or lose through your choices. You can choose wrong here, and the game will take no small effort in letting you know that you chose poorly, time and time and time again. But nothing is insurmountable, even when it literally towers over the mecha you’ve spent hours customizing to perfection, and triumph or even a complete thrashing feel amazing.\n\nFor me, nothing will top the feeling of my mecha dashing into the face of a warship, evading their lasers, then proceeding to destroy the bridge in a single strike as the enemy comms begin panicking at my presence, bewildered as to how a single pilot can cause so much destruction.\n\nAfter a decade of rest, Armored Core returned in bombastic fashion, and is still being played and experimented with today, both with an active modding scene and a strong PvP arena mode. And after winning the title for Best Action Game of the year, plus the reveal of games like Mecha-Break in the space, I imagine that Armored Core 6 is spearheading a revival of the mecha genre that we couldn’t imagine before.\n\nAlso, as I write this, the game has just announced the release of a new overhaul with expanded PvP and new parts for customization, meaning that there’s now more ways to make your mecha your own. So get back in the garage, get those parts balanced, and get back to work.\n\nResident Evil 4 Remake: Resident Evil 4 is one of those games that the term ‘genre-defining’ was made about. Serving as a severe departure from the fixed camera angles and slower, deliberate combat of the original series up to Code Veronica, Resident Evil 4 shaped how many games in and out of the horror genre handled themselves afterwards. Its fingerprint can be seen even in games today, and many of the conventions it made popular in 2004 are the cliches and tropes that people deride as simple in the landscape of gaming today. Even the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes took much of their inspiration from Resident Evil 4’s examples.\n\nSo when RE4 came back, it had to set itself apart. And it did a good job of it.\n\nRE4Remake is a game that thrives in the pressure scenario. While not ‘scary’ in a traditional sense, it builds fear and tension in the frantic pace of combat. Encounters in RE4 are pitched battles, demanding use of the terrain and a steady hand to keep enemies from surrounding and ending you in quick order. Learning to funnel your foes into long corridors, stretch them out and keep them from getting around you is paramount, and applying pressure and aggression to keep them off-balance rewards you with melee attacks that will send enemies scattering. And when combat is done, you are nervous. Wondering when the next encounter is going to pop out at you, keeping you on edge until you hear the enemy cursing your name and bringing you right back into the thick of it.\n\nThe game also brings back the modern Resident Evil convention of their bonus shop and unlock system, encouraging multiple playthroughs to gain those rewards and help you face the next level of challenge. It’s a good system that has worked for them since RE7, and it keeps going well for them now. And the RE Engine is on full display here, showing off Capcom’s flagship developer tools in exceptional fidelity.\n\nIt is as good as we all expected it to be, with Mercenaries mode and the ‘Separate Ways’ DLC ensuring that fans have a good amount of game to sink their teeth into for a long while.\n\nStar Ocean: The Second Story R: By the time I write this, I’ve collected all of the achievements across two separate playthroughs for the two main characters. I’ve beaten all three of the secret bosses, I’ve got my main party up to Level 255 and their endgame gear, and I’m still getting destroyed at the new Arena challenges. Whoever decided that one of the challenges should be a solo fight against the endgame superboss, or a twin fight against two of them? You are amazing, fuck you.\n\nStar Ocean 2 still stands as one of the best RPGs released on the Playstation, which was one of the best systems for RPGs to exist. This new version, made by the PSP remake developer Gemdrops (founded by former tri-ACE alum Yuichiro Kitao) takes everything amazing about Star Ocean 2 and improves it. The notably insanely deep crafting system? More items, new support items with new effects, more information given to you rather than hidden in the background and you can now craft in bulk. The combat? Reworked with a newer, faster system that benefits thinking more about your formation and positioning rather than mashing a button to win, and with a new ‘bonus’ system to give you more control over how you approach your fights, and the ‘Assault Formation’ that allows you to call in assists to help keep pressure on your foes to break their shields. The art? Sprites are remade as ‘3-D sprites’ that still have the same look as the PSX version but now are affected by lighting, on pre-made backgrounds that look incredible. If the original fights weren’t enough for you, there are now Raid fights on the main map with endgame gear and special items attached, meant to be fought in the post-game and still punishing even then. And the mini-map ensures you won’t get lost or miss a side-area again.\n\nI could talk all day about how they improved every aspect of the game while staying true to what Star Ocean is, and it’s amazing when you think about the level of detail involved. And, yes, the crafting system can still allow you to essentially break the game in half and turn it into a cakewalk by the end of the second continent, but that’s by design. That’s when Star Ocean is at its best.\n\nAnd I’m so happy to say it’s at its best here.\n\nSOME I DID NOT PLAY THIS YEAR Include the Super Mario RPG and the Dead Space remake, both games being example of faithful remakes that add small things to help improve the original experience without taking away from what made these things as impactful to begin with. Too many games this year.\n\n— — — -\n\nGame of the Year Contenders\n\nThis one is pure self indulgence.\n\nAlan Wake 2: I showed ‘WE SING’ to a family member of mine during a drive up for Thanksgiving. They don’t play a lot of games, so I wanted to get their opinion on one of the top ten moments in Alan Wake 2. And they were floored. Impressed, not just by the visuals or the music but by how well the scene is set and placed together, both from a narrative standpoint and from a visual one.\n\nI feel like that’s my entire take on Alan Wake 2. It is a game that does things I’ve never seen games do before, and the things that it has done before are done so well and unique to itself that they stand out proudly against the other examples of their kind. It is a game that surprised me in so many ways, large and small, that I want to shout about it at other people and dissect it in a group setting.\n\nI risk talking too much about it, as even smaller-seeming parts can be massive spoilers for later, but Alan Wake 2 is an impressive feat that is my current Game of the Year vote. An incredible trip from start to finish.\n\nI would also want to use this moment to say that this year, we lost both Lance Reddick and James McCaffrey, who worked with Remedy as part of their long, exceptional careers on screen and behind the microphone. Reddick being the face and voice of Mr. Hatch from Quantum Break, who became the inspiration for Mr. Door; and James McCaffrey being both Max Payne and Alex Casey from Alan Wake 2, the gritty world-worn detectives caught in worlds of darkness within and without.\n\nRest in Peace.\n\nTears of the Kingdom: There’s a certain joy to looking at a puzzle, going ‘Would this work?’, then testing something out to see if it does or not. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a game that is filled with these puzzles in nearly every interaction, and stands as a highlight to the current Nintendo development ethos of ‘Give the player as many choices as possible’.\n\nIn games, when you are presented with a problem in the form of traversal, or a puzzle, or an enemy, your choices will often narrow down to a certain list of specific actions that you can take to solve that specific problem. It’s rare to allow, for example, your attack moveset to allow you to pass over an obstacle or through a roadblock that normally would be solved by another set of skills. Though there are some instances of overlap, having this sort of segmented approach to gameplay is a sort of standard.\n\nTotK, however, is filled with instances where your attacks will be able to interact with the environment like with starting fires by striking flint, mining for resources, setting off explosives to cause an avalanche or starting an ancient device. Your building and traversal skills will also be turned to focus on combat, with parts and designs focused towards turning your creations into death machines. Being able to make a little killdozer and wipe out an enemy encampment without a sword swing is one of those things that the game not only encourages, but gives you a multitude of ways of making work.\n\nIt’s in that freedom of action that players come back to keep playing, even with the aging Switch hardware pushed to the limits by the scope of the game. To see how you can change and adapt and tackle the challenges the game presents to you. And it’s why the game has a devoted fanbase even this far after its release.\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3: I think that after five years of development, over $100 million in funding and a massive public beta test that basically gave them external QA that the testers paid for, I shouldn’t have a game that has massive bugs and glitches in the last act. Let alone have that game as a GOTY contender.\n\nBut that speaks to how well Baldur’s Gate 3 actually holds up. Larian has done an excellent job putting together a world and a cast that speaks with the people playing it, and rewards people for experimenting and testing the systems in all sorts of outlandish ways. Which, in a sense, is also the hallmark of a great DnD campaign: The ability for a player to experiment and discover how the world works, to push up against those boundaries and press against possibility.\n\nAnd that’s where BG3 shines: In how it gives you the chance to act and react in a dozen meaningful ways. The internet has already seen the video posted about the ten dozen ways to deal with the Goblin Camp quest, but one thing you might not have noticed is how other people chimed in with their own ways of handling it, my favorite being from Youtube creator Max0r:\n\nWhich, in a sense, is how the game came ahead and won the award: It does something we haven’t seen in the space in a long, long while, and it inspired discussion in what a game could be for months after its release. That’s a high mark for any sort of media.\n\nI won’t be reviewing Super Mario Wonder or Spider-Man 2, as I have not played them and would not want to seem biased.\n\nAND THE ONES I MISSED Are honestly too much to count. I could talk about how Starfield was a bland disappointment, how Lies of P was a fun diversion, how I got sucked into Fortnite, how I broke up with Destiny 2, how Street Fighter 6 helped my nephew be a better person, how Cyberpunk 2077 is an exceptional game even without the DLC, how Final Fantasy 14 is the best game I can’t bring myself to play, how Lethal Company is the funniest game of the year, how Horizon Forbidden West was somehow even worse than Starfield. I could go on and on and on about this year in games, but there are just too many to get to.\n\nWell, at least that means I got a lot of articles to work on.\n\n— — — — — — — -\n\nIn the Upcoming Year\n\nWe have a lot to look forward to, huh?\n\nWithin the first month, we have two new high-end fighting games with Tekken 8 and Under-Night 2, a massive RPGs with Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth which is quickly followed by Persona 3 Reload, and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (Which I know, I know, I still need to get that FF7R Article out), and an entire year worth of games after that, not to mention the DLCs for some of the games up above, like the FF16 Expansion, the Alan Wake 2 DLCs, and a rumored Starbound expansion.\n\nAnd I still have to catch up on 2023 stuff I missed. It’s a long year.\n\nBut to wrap back around to the start of this article, there is a lot going on in the industry that these releases threaten to overshadow. The creeping advances of machine learning being used to steal away jobs in order to release worse products for more money, like what we saw with The Finals this year, is only going to become more common unless we speak out about it. The continued bleeding in manpower throughout the industry will only spread until we support the people creating games coming together to protect themselves over the massive interests looking to squeeze them dry. We, as the people who play and enjoy the medium, owe it to the people who create these works of art to speak out. With our wallets, with our voices and with our assistance when we can.\n\nSo, yeah, we have a lot to look forward to. See you all in 2024.\n\nAnd so I wish you a Happy Holiday of your choosing, and a wonderful coming year. If you would like to hear more of my ramblings, feel free to look through my Medium, find me on Bluesky, Tumblr, Cohost and Twitter, or just reach out at realsquidradio@gmail.com if you have any questions or comments.\n\nBe safe and be happy."
