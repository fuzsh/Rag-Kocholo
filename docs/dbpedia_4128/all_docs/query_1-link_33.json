        "text": "It seems these days that I’m mostly of two minds when it comes to videogames on Kickstarter. Either, I’m insanely excited because games from my childhood are coming back (yay Leisure Suit Larry!). Or, I scratch my head and say, “So wait… what game is this that they are remaking?”\n\nYup. It’s a perfect opportunity for me to learn more about ancient gaming lore and possibly become familiar with a title that somehow, kind of shockingly, that I missed the first time around.\n\nShadowgate is one of those games. If you’re reading this article based on the headline, you know all about it.\n\nTo learn why it has such a passionate fan-base and how on Earth I could have missed it the first time, I recently spoke with Dave Marsh, founding of Zojoi, the developer, on their Kickstarter for a re-imagination of Shadowgate. (With just over 10 days to go, they’re more than $70,000 towards their goal of $120,000.)\n\nFor those who never had a chance to play the original Shadowgate – like me – how would you describe it?\n\nFirst and foremost, Shadowgate is a fantasy adventure game in that you move through the labyrinths of a living castle, confront devilish denizens, confound fiendish traps, find both mundane and preternatural objects and solve challenging puzzles.\n\nUnlike many other adventure games, Shadowgate is presented in first-person and seen through the players eyes and the puzzles are more story-driven (deciphering an ancient glyph or locating the proper artifact for the situation at hand) rather than placing the proper colored tiles in a row.\n\nYou were one of the earliest games to feature point-and-click—especially on the Mac. How early in the development process was that the design plan? Had you ever considered something else like a text parser?\n\nWell, Karl Roelofs (the co-designer) and I weren’t on board yet when ICOM created the first point and click game.\n\nWe started working on Shadowgate in 1985 and ICOM’s first title – Déjà vu: A Nightmare Comes True – had just been released when the black and white Mac hit the market. I do know that the development of the first two games was heavily programmer-driven. The goal was to really exploit this new windowed-based OS while, at the same time, creating games that allowed the most amount of freedom.\n\nThis meant that the player could do more than clicking and could use a command system (Examine, Open, Close, Use, Consume, etc.) to interact with literally everything in the game. It also gave players the ability to drag objects into their on-screen inventory and arrange them in any way they wanted.\n\nThis was a huge deal.\n\nRemember, the idea of using a mouse was a whole new experience at the time so the key was to make a game and UI that not only exploited that new feature but felt as intuitive as possible.\n\nYou recently brought some of your original Sherlock Holmes titles back as ports thanks to Kickstarter. But now you have a Kickstarter that’s a reimagined Shadowgate. What made you guys decide to remake it as opposed to port it? (Vice versa—why not reimagine the Sherlock Holmes games?)\n\nOver our career we had ported Shadowgate to no less than eleven different platforms and we weren’t really interested in doing another.\n\nInstead, we looked at the PC and Mac market as well as the newer tablet devices and thought a re-imagined, updated game would be well-received. We realized that we could now create the Shadowgate that we had always envisioned—relatively free of the delivery constraints of the past (e.g. floppies, cartridges).\n\nThis included adding full screen, immersive rooms and a complete game soundtrack and sound design. We also wanted to add a lot of new puzzles as well as re-visit every puzzle in the original game, ensuring that they held up over time.\n\nThat said, because we know that many fans love the original, we wanted to pay homage to the game and included many of the environments they remembered as well as offering an alternate score that was a fan favorite on the Nintendo version.\n\nAs for the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective mysteries, it would have been very tough to redesign them as they utilize video that could not be altered and are based on the design of an award-winning line of board games. We also wanted to present these mysteries to gamers who had played them on machines that couldn’t properly render the video large enough. Because of the new devices, were now able to offer full-screen 24fps video—something unheard of in the 90’s.\n\nTalk to me about the new interface you’re designing for the game and how it will work.\n\nThe new UI is really about allowing a more immersive experience. This means that the rooms that you are in are all full-screen – as compared to a small window in the original game – and include a complete atmospheric score and sound design as well as environment animations.\n\nTo complement this, the command system (that allows you to interact with the environments, objects and creatures) now comes up with a touch or click so it’s not obtrusive. The inventory that holds the items that you collect and a new mapping mode are now full screen as well and available with a single touch/click.\n\nThis design will also allow us to bring the game to smaller screens like smart phones.\n\nAre you considering building in a mode that actually would allow gamers to play Shadowgate as they originally did? (Sort of the way gamers could hit the back button on their XBOX 360 controller while playing Halo Anniversary and see the original graphics?)\n\nTo be honest, we have talked a good deal about offering a retro command system in the game but have only entertained brief discussions about a complete original game mode.\n\nWe’re a pretty small company and the effort and expense to develop all the original rooms and recode the game (on top of efforts to make this new re-imagined game) wouldn’t be insubstantial.\n\nYou’re more than halfway to your Kickstarter goal with more than 2 weeks left. What are you doing to get the word out?\n\nWe’re doing a ton of interviews and reaching out to a lot of gaming sites. We’ve got a great fan base and with their help, we’re working all the social media outlets to let them know what we are doing.\n\nWe’re also offering some amazing rewards that are unusual for a game campaign. Things like a 54 card Quests of Shadowgate card game designed by the creator of the Middle Earth Collectable Card game and a complete 72” Staff of Ages (the iconic weapon on the game.)\n\nAssuming you are successful again on Kickstarter, will you be looking to bring back other back catalogue games? Either as ports or re-imaginations?\n\nNo doubt the question I am asked most often!\n\nYes, that is really our goal. We re-acquired the rights to all of the “MacVenture” games which includes the Ace Harding detective mysteries (Déjà vu: A Nightmare Comes True and Déjà vu: Lost in Las Vegas) and the haunted house hit Uninvited.\n\nThankfully, Karl and I have also retained all of our later designs including Beyond Shadowgate (a massive sequel to the original) and The Awakening (a Victorian werewolf thriller.)\n\nObviously fans of Shadowgate are going to be very interested in this Kickstarter. What would you say to newbies to hopefully get them interested?\n\nShadowgate was really the grand-daddy of all fantasy adventure games and if you love games like Myst or Riven or some of the adventure/hidden puzzle games that are popular on tablets these days, you will love this game.\n\nAnd if you are a big fan of fantasy in general, you will appreciate the game as it is heavy on fantasy narrative and allows you to use an intuitive command-based system to interact with the world and solve quests.\n\nI would encourage folks to head over to the Kickstarter page and watch the promotion video as well as listen to the music, and view the artwork and update videos to get a sense of how cool this game is!\n\nWe’ve even put a hidden “Easter egg” URL in the promo video that sends you to… wait, now you wouldn’t want me to give that away would you?\n\nAnd finally—what do you want to say directly to the fans?\n\nReally, we have the best fans and I want to say thank you so much for supporting us all these years!\n\nIt seems that since I launched Zojoi, not a day goes by that I don’t get an email from someone who loved playing this game and can’t wait to see the new version.\n\nIt’s been a real blessing.\n\nWait one more. Here’s a fun one. What’s a game you played more than 15-20 years ago that YOU would love to see come back thanks to Kickstarter?\n\nRaven Software’s Heretic. Hands down.\n\nThe Doom-inspired, fantasy game was my favorite first-person shooter game and its multiplayer mode surely cost companies millions of hours of lost productivity. So. Much. Fun. I mean, seriously, who wouldn’t want to turn opponents into flying chickens before blowing them out of the sky with a missile from a Phoenix rod?"
