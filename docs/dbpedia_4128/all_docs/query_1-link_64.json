        "text": "This month, MacUser chooses the best products of 1985. We also play detective in Deja Vu: A Nightmare Comes True, find a way to cool your Mac, learn that Steve Jobs has resigned from Apple, and get insights from Andy Hertzfeld. Programmers are not forgotten, with a tasty alpha-beta soup and a comparison of BASIC, C, Pascal, and Forth.\n\nThis is A Macintosh History: a history of the early Apple Mac told through the pages of MacUser magazine. This post is based on the January 1986 issue. New to the series? Start at the beginning with Welcome to Macintosh (Oct ‚Äò85).\n\nShare your thoughts with @WillFlux on Mastodon or Twitter. If you like what I do, sponsor me. üôè\n\nJanuary 1986\n\nPick up your copy of MacUser January 1986 from the Internet Archive. Download 68K Mac software from Macintosh Garden and Macintosh Repository.\n\nCalling All ROMs\n\nOn page 9, Neil Shapiro takes on user interface consistency. It‚Äôs worth reading the whole thing, but here‚Äôs an extract:\n\nAccording to some people, writing programs for the Macintosh is similar to wearing a velvet, fashionably-cut and designer-styled straitjacket.\n\nIt all goes back to the design philosophy of the Mac Team and to Apple‚Äôs published tome Inside Macintosh. In this book, (which looks and weighs very much like a huge and wizardly incunabula that you might find on a dust-covered podium within the laboratory of an alchemist such as Hermes Trismegistus), Apple spells out just how a Macintosh program can and should run from the standpoint of the guy running the mouse.\n\nAfter all, one of the things that makes the Macintosh so intuitive to use is that you do not have to relearn how to do everything whenever you launch a new program. The Macintosh interface is a little bit of terra firma.\n\nYou can read the original Inside Macintosh thanks to VintageApple.org.\n\nLetter‚Äôs Page\n\nJohn Dvorak‚Äôs column, The Devil‚Äôs Advocate (October ‚Äò85), comes in for a lot of flack from readers. Here‚Äôs Shari Leventhal (Arlington, VA) on page 15:\n\nAs a woman, and a computer user since early 1979, I was deeply offended by much of the language in Mr. Dvorak‚Äôs piece, particularly the second paragraph in which he stated that ‚ÄúThe AT is man‚Äôs computer design by men for men.‚Äù\n\nI would like to ask Mr. Dvorak what the AT would have looked like had it been designed by women for women? Is his later analogy between the Macintosh and a Cuisinart supposed to give us a clue?\n\nIf Mr. Dvorak is implying that the Mac is a ‚Äúwimp‚Äôs‚Äù machine because it was designed without some sort of male focus, then he is sorely mistaken.\n\n512K Price Cut & MacBCool\n\nIn the news (page 19), Apple has trimmed the price of the 512K:\n\nApple officially slashed the price on its 512K Mac on October 2, dropping the price from $2,795 list to $2,499.\n\nMeanwhile, the MacBCool cools your Mac (at some cost in elegance). It wasn‚Äôt until the Macintosh SE that a compact Mac got a fan.\n\nThe MacBCool is an add-on device that fans cool air through the Mac‚Äôs convection cooling system, a boon to those who use their computers in confined areas or over extended periods of time.\n\nAndy Hertzfeld: Quotable Quotes\n\nAndy Hertzfeld speaking at the Princeton Mac Users Group (page 22) on&mldr;\n\nCopy-protection: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs reasonable for games. It‚Äôs absurd to put copy-protection on productivity software.‚Äù\n\nSoftware piracy: Most people with pirated software ‚ÄúNever would have bought it anyway, at any price. It‚Äôs hard for me to feel sorry for Lotus when they complain about the money they‚Äôre losing.‚Äù\n\nSoftware prices: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inevitable that the price of programs will come down as the installed user base gets larger.‚Äù\n\nDeveloping the Mac: ‚ÄúOur biggest mistake was not enough attention to the needs of a hard disk user&mldr; because of Lisa being the hard disk system.‚Äù\n\nLisa: ‚Äú&mldr;took a left turn into oblivion.‚Äù\n\nAmiga: ‚ÄúEvery program will have a different user interface &mldr; it [the machine] was poorly thought out.‚Äù\n\nGEM: ‚ÄúLike a Mac duplicated with a Bizarro Ray.‚Äù (Remember Superman comic books? The Bizarro Ray made imperfect, clumsy clones.)\n\nFuture of Apple: ‚Äú&mldr;in the short term, 3 or 4 years, is very good. After that, just another billion-dollar company.‚Äù Because&mldr;\n\nSteve Jobs: ‚Äú&mldr;with Steve gone, they have reactionaries instead of visionaries&mldr; the ‚Äônext Mac‚Äô won‚Äôt come from Apple.‚Äù\n\nSee also: Andy Hertzfeld on Switcher (Dec ‚Äò85).\n\nWhither Thou Goest?\n\nWest Coast Report (page 25) is also talking about Steve‚Äôs departure:\n\nSteve Jobs resigned his position as Chairman of the Board at Apple Computer and announced his plans to form a new company to make computers for universities. Five Apple staffers resigned their positions to join him.\n\nAnd intellectual property: would Lisa and Macintosh exist without Xerox PARC?\n\nApple must of course protect its interests and the interests of its shareholders. The industry is young enough that the distinction between what is and isn‚Äôt proprietary information is still somewhat unclear. But I can‚Äôt help thinking back a few years and wondering what would have happened with Lisa and Macintosh if it hadn‚Äôt been for people and ideas developed first at Xerox PARC.\n\nMeanwhile, amid renewed rumors of a takeover bid made and accepted, Apple announced several new products, including the long awaited external hard disk drive for the Mac.\n\nGiven Apple‚Äôs history, consensus was that the drive would be priced at $2495. Wonder of wonders and miracle of miracles, the Apple 20-megabyte external hard disk (I hope someone gives it a catchier, shorter name) has an announced price of $1,499.\n\nThis is a momentous occasion, an announcement of incredible importance. The hard disk is nice, but the price is phenomenal! It‚Äôs realistic, reasonable, responsible, affordable, and most of all, totally uncharacteristic.\n\nWe‚Äôll hear more about hard disks in A Hard Mac is Hard to Find (Feb ‚Äò86).\n\nThrough The Looking Glass\n\nThe Digital Antiquarian calls Through The Looking Glass ‚Äúthe Mac‚Äôs first great game‚Äù. Read MacUser‚Äôs quick review on page 33:\n\nSteve Capps, coauthor of the Finder, has, with a lot of help from Lewis Carroll, created an enchanting arcade game in the guise of a chessboard.\n\nThe game is quite playable, although a very quick mind and hand are needed to get a good score. It doesn‚Äôt quite offer enough variety to be a long-lasting attraction, but the first few times it is great.\n\nThe Editors‚Äô Choice Awards For 1985\n\nOn page 38, MacUser chooses its best programs of 1985. The award for best overall program of 1985 goes to:\n\nExcel from Microsoft for many, many reasons. Its spreadsheet routines are superb and totally outclass any spreadsheet running on any system. Couple the eye-widening graphics and charting capabilities to that spreadsheet and if your proposal doesn‚Äôt carry the day at the board meeting then you have no one to blame but yourself. It may be strange to quote Jack Tramiel in a Mac magazine but if, as he says, ‚Äúbusiness is war‚Äù then Excel is the best ammunition you can own.\n\nWe‚Äôve plenty of other Excel coverage, including MacUser‚Äôs review of Excel (Oct ‚Äò85) and a guide to creating Excel macros (Dec ‚Äò85).\n\nPrinting the Light Fantastic\n\nOn page 68, Richard Herbst digs into your printing options in early 1986:\n\nWould you rather buy a LaserWriter or a car? Both are expensive; but both take you places you‚Äôve never been.\n\nThis article will treat a relatively small number of printers. The emphasis is on alternatives to the LaserWriter and the ease with which widely different machines can be brought under the exquisite control of the Macintosh.\n\nThere are four basic types of computer printers: laser, thermal, impact and ink jet. Typesetting machines and plotters are in their own special categories and will be treated later.\n\nSee also: The LaserWriter Revealed (Feb ‚Äò86) and Plus the LaserWriter Plus (Mar ‚Äò86).\n\nDeja Vu: A Nightmare Comes True\n\nPage 88 finds Tracie Forman Hines in a strange situation:\n\nMy head cleared slowly. Through the haze I could vaguely make out my surroundings. I squinted, stretched, and found that my arm was sore and stiff, as if I had just gotten some sort of shot&mldr; Slowly my eyes came into focus and I found myself in the stall of a filthy men‚Äôs room john.\n\nDeja Vu: A Nightmare Comes True is one of the best things to happen to the Mac since the LaserWriter. Just when Mac-owning computer gamers were starting to envy their friends‚Äô huge collection of game libraries, along comes a game truly Mac in flavor, execution, and style.\n\nThe Digital Antiquarian has some fine words for Deja Vu too:\n\nIn the fall of 1985, when the first MacVenture debuted in the form of a two-fisted private-eye caper called D√©j√† Vu, it was an absolute stunner, the sort of thing that could stop people in their tracks when they stumbled across it running on an in-store computer.\n\nAs a relatively coherent work of fiction, it stands amongst the top tier of 1980s adventure games.\n\nICOM Simulations also created Uninvited (Sep ‚Äò86).\n\nAlpha-Beta Soup\n\nPart of the delight in reading early MacUser comes from the surprising diversity of topics. After a couple of game reviews, we come to page 98, where chess grandmaster David Levy shows you how to use an alpha-beta search algorithm.\n\nProgramming a computer to play chess and other two-player strategy games is a lot more difficult than mastering the game itself. It requires a thorough understanding of game principles and the ability to program carefully constructed algorithms which search all the possible moves, evaluate playing positions and make the right decisions.\n\nMany zero-sum (non-scoring) two-player games, such as chess, checkers, and reversi (Othello) can be represented in a computer program by a game tree.\n\nThe quality of a two-player game program is largely a function of the power and speed of its search algorithm. By incorporating techniques such as those described here, you can develop very capable and intelligent game programs.\n\nLearn more from the article‚Äôs bibliography and Alpha‚Äìbeta pruning (Wikipedia).\n\nThe Great Language Face-Off\n\nWhat was it like to program the Mac in the mid-80s? Turn to page 110:\n\nThere are almost as many opinions as to which programming language is best for the Mac as there are programmers. We asked some of the top programmers in each language to tell us, in their own words, what makes their own choice best for the types of programs they create.\n\nThere‚Äôs a handy table laying out your choices (page 112):\n\nSharon Aker on BASIC\n\nBASIC gives users independent volume control of the four sound channels; window-independent I/O; extensibility of the language (using machine language routines by name); interactive environmental commands; and Clipboard access.\n\nClipboard access is probably the most important of BASIC‚Äôs features, because it lets you import and export items to and from BASIC. You can program an intricate design of precise mathematical proportions and paste it into MacPaint; even better, you can draw something in MacPaint and use it in your BASIC program.\n\nRead the BASIC tutorial series (begins Nov ‚Äò85), ZBasic is Zmost (Dec ‚Äò86), and A Vote for MacBASIC (Jun ‚Äò86), which explains how BASIC could have been even better on the Macintosh.\n\nBob Perez On C\n\nFor programming the Mac on the Mac, assembly language and C are the only reasonable choices for commercial applications. Assembly language is fine if you think in hex and are willing to write 10 to 20 lines of code for each little step your program takes. But the beauty of C is its elegance and brevity. With short, easy-to-remember keywords like ‚Äúwhile‚Äù and ‚Äúdo‚Äù, you can create fast, powerful programs that look and act just as you‚Äôd imagine them. Once you‚Äôve learned the syntax (something you‚Äôll have to do with any language), C becomes an expressive language that you actually can think in.\n\nRead the C tutorial series (begins Mar ‚Äò86).\n\nRobert Woodhead On Pascal\n\nOver the years, I‚Äôve used just about every popular computer language, and while there are several that fit my criteria, my choice is Pascal. Pascal is a structured programming language. As opposed to free form languages like Forth, Pascal requires the programmer to follow a set of guidelines and rules that results in programs that are clean and readable. In return for this bit of regimentation, Pascal provides a bevy of features and conveniences that make a programmer‚Äôs life a little easier.\n\nRead the Pascal tutorial series (begins Jul ‚Äò86). For more up-to-date Pascal development on 68K Mac, check out Think Pascal 4.5.\n\nSteve Troughton-Smith has an introductory post on Lisa Pascal Development in Lisa Workshop (Tumblr) with source on GitHub LisaOSToolKitSample.\n\nNick Karp On Forth\n\nNo one language can have the tools needed for every application. Forth doesn‚Äôt try. Instead it has a minimal kernel which is extended as desired. Most of the Forth language is itself written in Forth, giving the programmer complete flexibility to customize the system.\n\nSource code, object code, and working environment are all extraordinarily compact. Whereas even mid-sized Microsoft BASIC or MacPascal programs are cumbersome or impossible on a 128K Mac, Forth works fine, leaving 55K of only slowly consumed programming space.\n\nYou can download MacForth, but sadly there‚Äôs no tutorial series in MacUser.\n\nzForth is a tiny, modern Forth written in ANSI C that compiles to around 4 KiB.\n\nMaxell Disk Advert\n\nFinally, on the back cover, we find an advert for a disk the Mac can‚Äôt digest:\n\nOther Features and Reviews\n\nIt‚Äôs Tax Time! - Use your Mac for tax records and returns (page 44)\n\nRethinking ThinkTank - ThinkTank 512 does outlines and more (page 52)\n\nMunch!Gobble!Crunch! - A review of Crunch, a new spreadsheet (page 60)\n\nMac¬∑ing Money - Making money using your Mac (page 74)\n\nTake Two Tablets - Graphics tablets reviewed (page 82)\n\nEx Mouse Ad Astra - Universe 2 game reviewed (page 94)\n\nBASIC: A Dip Into The ROM, Part 3 (page 104) - started Nov ‚Äò85\n\nMUG Line! - A guide to Mac User Groups (page 120)\n\nWhat‚Äôs Next?\n\nA Macintosh History 86.02 travels to February 1986, where Neil Shapiro talks slots, the Apple Hard Disk 20 arrives with HFS, and we create a function key with 68K assembler. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, we take on slime monsters in Rogue, put your Mac in touch with the world, look at free software, and find a desk designed specifically for the Mac."
