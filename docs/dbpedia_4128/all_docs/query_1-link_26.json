        "text": "In 2013 I wrote an excruciatingly long Tumblr post detailing nearly 40 ghoulish NES games perfect for the Halloween season. Now, 10 years later, I've decided to give it the Hollywood treatment and do a total reboot. I've broken the list down into categories and rewritten some entries, hopefully making for an easier reading experience.\n\nAlso new is the SPOOK-O-METER: a handy rating guide judging the total spook factor of each entry. (Caution: Spook-O-Meter does not represent quality of the game.)\n\nWithout further ado, please enjoy this ridiculously exhaustive and overwhelmingly large list of video games.\n\nMonster Party\n\nA boy named Mark is walking home from a baseball game when a monster named Bert falls from the sky and lands in front of him. Bert says his world is in danger and he needs Mark to help fight the monsters. Mark is reluctant but Bert grabs his hand and drags him off anywayâ¦ and then proceeds to magically fuse with him in the skyâ¦\n\nThe goal of the game is to traverse the levels, entering doors and fighting the monsters inside until you get a key that unlocks the exit at the end of the level. Mark has a short-ranged baseball bat that can reflect projectiles. However, by popping pills, he can briefly transform into Bert the dragon-man, who can fly and shoot lasers.\n\nBut the real stars of the show are the bosses. Each one is goofy, big, and unique, each greeting you with their own peculiar catchphrase before going on the attack. You'll face terrifying foes, such asâ¦ a kitten in a box! A cow-hurling minotaur that demands you \"mooove it!\" And a giant bouncing onion ring!\n\nDespite being developed in Japan, the game was curiously never released there. But that doesn't mean there weren't plans. \"Parody World: Monster Party\" was teased in magazines briefly before quietly disappearing. It was going to feature more blatant parodies of classic horror-adjascent movies such as The Little Shop of Horrors and Planet of the Apes. Fortunately, a prototype was found and released in 2014, finally allowing everyone to see this alternate take on the game.\n\nOverall, while I hesitate to call the game good, per se, the charm factor alone rockets it beyond the sum of its parts to where I can comfortably call it a must-play for the Halloween season.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nSplatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti\n\nItâs Splatterhouse, but in a cute SD style! Adorably chop up all the monsters that get in your way with a meat cleaver! Lots of horror movie parodies in here tooâ¦ even Michael Jacksonâs Thriller. And thereâs also a bunch of neat little secretsâ¦\n\nThis game was released only in Japan, if you couldnât tell by the subtitle. Thereâs a translation hack out there, but only the brief ending sequence has any Japanese text in it, so itâs not really necessary. The game was also officially included in the 2020 Namcot Collection.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nGhosts'n Goblins\n\nA port of Capcomâs (in)famously difficult arcade game. Youâre probably already familiar with it. Itâs a fairly early release and the programming feels pretty janky. Beating it is completely hopeless. You will become angry at the video game.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nGargoyle's Quest II\n\nThe sequel to Gargoyleâs Quest on the Game Boy. This Ghosts'n Goblins spinoff is a hybrid platformer/RPG. The game features your typical RPG style overworld, where you walk around and visit towns and talk to people and such.\n\nHowever, the game also has action-platformer sections, where you jump around and spit at monsters and fight bosses and stuff. Firebrand, the demon protagonist, has the fairly unique ability to cling to walls and briefly hover through the air, which are central mechanics of the platforming segments.\n\nThe RPG parts are mostly pretty fetch questyâ¦ find such-and-such item to access such-and-such place. But Firebrandâs walk speed abnormally quick, and there arenât any random encounters, so itâs not that tedious.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nCastlevania\n\nEveryoneâs familiar with these. Jump around a spooky castle and whip monsters to death in search of Dracula.\n\nPersonally, I think this first game is the most well-rounded of the original NES trilogy. Thereâs sort of a finesse in its simplicity and linearity, in comparison to its bigger scale sequels, y'know? It just feels like every inch of the game was deliberately thought out. Even the seemingly mundane parts.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nCastlevania II: Simon's Quest\n\nLike a number of NES sequels, Castlevania II completely shakes up the forumula established by the first, taking the series into a unique direction. Instead of a simple stage-based structure, the sequel offers a large, sprawling world from the outset.\n\nIt introduced a day/night system, where the baddies become tougher at night, and towns where you can buy items. It also introduced the infamous townsfolk who either offer sage advice, or outright lies. It turns out this wasnât even a translation error. They lied to you in the Japanese version too. So take whatever you hear with a grain of salt.\n\nCastlevania II is sort of the black sheep in the series, as usual for these kinds of off-beat sequels (see: Mario 2, Zelda 2). It certainly takes more patience to play than its more actiony, straight-forward brethren. It can be pretty obtuse at times and may require consulting a guide. The goofy, cryptic dialogue is certainly something to behold though.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nCastlevania III: Dracula's Curse\n\nCastlevania III brings the series back to its roots, focusing again on being a linear action game. However, it also expands on the original's scope, adding branching paths and new playable characters. Three potential partners can be recruited on your adventure—Alucard, who can transform into a bat; Grant, who can scale walls; and Sypha, who can use magic.\n\nThe Japanese version (Akumajou Densetsu) is considerably different, and generally considered superior to the western release. It uses the VRC6 sound chip to create a denser, more vibrant soundtrack beyond the power of the console hardware. The difficulty is also somewhat easier. There are a couple translation patches out there, but I'd recommend this one.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nAkumajou Special: Boku Dracula-kun\n\nThis goofy Castlevania parody spinoff stars Dracula's junior vampire sonâ¦? No, not Alucard, silly. It's none other than Dracula-kun!\n\nDespite its heritage, the game plays more like Mega Man. Your kid protagonist shoots projectiles and gains new abilities after completing stages. The first level is set in a parody of Castlevania's famous clock tower. Afterwards, it features absolutely nothing especially Castlevania related, or even anything particularly spooky. But there you go.\n\nWhile this game wasn't initially released in the west, its Game Boy follow-up was, under the name Kid Dracula. But a translation patch for this one is available. Itâs not absolutely necessary to play, but there is a fair bit of text, particularly for the bonus games. In 2019, Konami included an English version in Castlevania Anniversary Collection.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\n8 Eyes\n\nSpeaking of Castlevania, here's a blatant knockoff. You get a bird companion in this one though, which would surely make any Belmont jealous. It even includes a co-op mode where someone else can control your falcon friendâ¦! It's not especially Halloweeny, but it does have a vaguely spooky atmosphere to it.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nHoly Diver\n\nAnother heavily Castlevania influenced game. Yes, itâs named after the Dio song.\n\nYou play as a guy named Randy R. Crimson (yes, really). Power-walk around, blowing up monsters with the magic you shoot out of your hands, gaining new abilities as you complete levels. You can choose what magic ability you want to use in the pause menu and switch to it during the game with the Select button.\n\nItâs a very, very tough game. But itâs pretty well made and can be pretty enjoyable if youâre up to the challenge. At least it has unlimited continues. And as you could guess thereâs plenty of references to 80s metal music.\n\nThis is yet another game that didnât leave Japan, though there were plans for it. A translation patch is available, but the only Japanese text seems to be in the level names, so itâs not necessary. However, in 2019, Retro-Bit released an officially licensed reproduction cart in a big ol' collector's box.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nFrankenstein: The Monster Returns\n\nFrankenstein('s Monster) is an iconic staple of the Halloween monster squad. You donât play as Frank here though. Frank burns down a village and kidnaps some girl and you gotta walk right and hit monsters until whatever. Itâs not too hotâ¦ yet, it still has an indescribable something. This is a B movie aiming for greater heights.\n\nThe game is absurdly difficult. You can find fireball projectiles, but you lose them with a single hit. You can pick up alternate weapons, but they get knocked out of your hands constantly. You can use potions to refill your health with Select, but they're rare. Health also doesn't refill between stages, the game is stingy with continues, and you need to re-enter a password every time you game over.\n\nThere's a nonsensical storyline that runs throughout as you chat with bosses. Why is Frankenstein this all-powerful dimension-crossing demon wizard man that can apparently corrupt minds into doing his bidding? What did he want with that singular random girl anyways? Why does his entire existence in his own titular game feel like a last-minute addition? We just don't know.\n\nStill, the graphics are nice, and the atmosphere is on point. 5/5 spooks.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nMonster in My Pocket\n\nHereâs a great overlooked game from Konami, based off a toy line of small figurines (similar to M.U.S.C.L.E.). Itâs an action-platformer, and in this one you can play as either Dracula or Frankenstein. You can pick things up and throw them, and even double-jump. Plus it even has co-op!\n\nItâs neat seeing everyday environments from the perspective of these little toys. Reminds me a bit of Capcomâs Rescue Rangers games come to think of it.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nZombie Nation\n\nA giant severed head terrorizes America by flying around, destroying cities with his spit. That's you, the hero. You can also rescue civilians who go flying out of the buildings you obliterate, so he's not all bad I suppose.\n\nAlso heâs a samurai and fights the Statue of Liberty.\n\nZombie Nation is a horizontal shoot-em-up with great graphics and music. Gameplay is above average, but some may disagree. Your head is a pretty big target but it soaks up damage pretty good. Still a pretty tough game though.\n\nThe old internet rumor said that a request to make the character \"the great head of the samurai\" was taken a bit too literally. (Of course, that story is completely baseless, but amusing.) The Japanese version stars a giant tengu mask instead, but it still travels America blowing up cities, so it's not like that's much more sensible either.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nSweet Home\n\nHereâs an RPG from Capcom based off a horror movie (â¦or was the movie based on the game?). A team of documentarians enter a deceased womanâs mansion to get her last fresco on film. However, the womanâs soul still haunts the mansion and traps them inside. The team must then try to find a way to escape, unraveling the mysteries of the manor along the way.\n\nYou can control each character separately, or team up into groups. Each character has a unique item useful for solving puzzles and stuff. But if a character dies, theyâre dead for good. They cannot be revived.\n\nThis game wasnât released in the west and itâs pretty obvious why. It's a big RPG and things get gruesome. Itâs considered one of the earliest survival horror games and it was even an inspiration for Resident Evil. A very nice translation patch is available, and youâll certainly need it.\n\nAs for the movie, well, it's been languishing in purgatory since 1989. Apparently the producer did changes to it for its initial home release, thus the director disowned it as a result, and it's never been rereleased since. And also there was also a lawsuit he lost...? I dunno. Nevertheless, a high quality subtitled version is up on YouTube thanks to the efforts of Kineko Video.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nManiac Mansion\n\nSpeaking of mansions, hereâs a port of the classic point-and-click adventure game from Lucasarts. Itâs a very lighthearted and humorous tale of some teenagers who sneak into a mansion in an attempt to rescue the main characterâs girlfriend from a mad scientist. You can choose two kids to accompany the main character, each with their own unique attributes.\n\nThe developers went through a hell of a process trying to clean the game up for Nintendoâs ridiculously strict censorship policies, which has been documented by Douglas Crockford (who headed the NES conversion) here. Itâs an interesting read.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nManiac Mansion (Japanese version)\n\nFun fact: Jaleco made their own version of the game for Japan two years prior. Also, instead of using a battery save like the NES version, the Famicom version made you enter a password that was 104 characters long. The programmer even hid a couple special passwords apologizing about it. Translated, the password âApologyâ displays âSorry the password is so longâ and the password âManabu Shiratoâ displays âHonestly!â\n\nThereâs no translation patch or anything so I have no idea what Iâm doing and neither will you.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nShadowgate\n\nAnother port of a classic point-and-click computer game. You were given a quest to enter Castle Shadowgate to prevent a warlock from raising the Behemoth and destroying the world.\n\nThis one has lots of fun ways to get killed, complete with dramatic descriptions of how you died. Sort of like a choose-your-own-adventure book. And youâll be dying a lot. Very trial and error. Lots of charm though. Be sure to keep your torches lit!\n\nShadowgate is part of a series of point-and-click adventures developed by ICOM Simulations for Macintosh, which were given the âMacVentureâ label. Two other games in the series (which are unrelated story-wise), Deja Vu and Uninvited, were also ported to the NES. Which brings us toâ¦\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nUninvited\n\nSo you wake up after having wrecked your car and blacking out. Your sisterâs gone, and you assume she went into the big spooky mansion nearby for help. And your car blew up as soon as you stepped out. So I guess the only thing to do is sneak into the big spooky mansion then.\n\nThis one came out before Shadowgate, but I only mentioned that one earlier cause itâs more popular and well known. Unlike Shadowgate, which has more of a fantasy setting, Uninvited opts for a slightly more realistic, mundane setting. Though thereâs still plenty of sorcery shenanigans to go around.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nDr. Chaos\n\nDr. Chaos â Part sidescroller, part point-and-click adventure? This guyâs mad scientist brother was experimenting with âwarp zone technologyâ and it went awry and he went missing. So the brother goes into the mansion to find him and collect weapon pieces or something. The mansion is just DOORS EVERYWHERE and INVESTIGATE ROOMS and I donât know I donât have the patience for it.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nFriday the 13th\n\nWell, some people like it. Iâd even go as far as calling it a cult classic. Hell, in 2013, toy company NECA released a Comic-Con exclusive Jason figure that was based on his appearance in this game. And it was so successful, it kicked off a whole line of game-themed variants of action figures for other properties.\n\nFriday the 13th was developed by Atlus and published by the dreaded LJN. Thereâs a common misconception that LJN developed the games they published, but really they didnât! LJN was just a publisher and contracted development to various outside companies—usually Atlus or Rare. Those two were typically competent developersâ¦ but LJN didnât really care about quality and just wanted stuff on shelves, so their products suffered due to tight budgets and deadlines. Or something like that.\n\nAnyway, back to this game. Travel around camp and rescue the kids! Go into cabins and light fireplaces and fight off Jason! Pause the game frequently to look at the map so you know where you need to go and if youâre even moving in the right direction! (Remember: Right is always clockwise, Left is always counterclockwise.)\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street\n\nAnother LJN published title, this one developed by Rare. You gotta run around punching snakes and bats, go into buildings and collect all of Freddyâs bones to burn them. Thereâs even a day/night system, similar to Castlevania II. Actually itâs more of a night/nightmare system, but thatâs harder to explain. In the nightmare mode you can switch between different dream warriors which have more capabilities and stuff?\n\nThe game was originally going to have you playing as Freddy, trying to kill the teenagers. But Nintendo probably wasnât keen on that idea and made them change it.\n\nPerhaps the most shocking thing about this game is that it includes 4-player co-op, which was absolutely unthinkable for an NES platformer. It took Mario until the Wii to reach those heights. Nintendo thought it wasn't possible, but Rare said \"Hold my tea.\"\n\nHonestly, I donât think the game is as terrible as some people make it out to be. Maybe average at worst.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nBeetlejuice\n\nThis, on the other handâ¦\n\nHere we have yet another Rare/LJN outing. Itâs a platformer where you gotta occasionally step on colorful cockroaches to earn points buy âscaresâ which turn you into different forms or something. Itâs pretty wonky and lousy.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nThe Addams Family\n\nWell, they are creepy, kooky, mysterious, and spooky. A pretty basic platformer. Not too terrible I guess. This was largely a European computer release, so you know what to expect, but it also came to Nintendo platforms.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nThe Addams Family: Pugsleyâs Scavenger Hunt\n\nPugsleyâs gotta find a bunch of stupid shit. Thereâs not even any music.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nFester's Quest\n\nSunsoft is considered one of the top developers on the NES, but their road to that position was rocky to say the least. Known in America for classics like Blaster Master and Journey to Silius, Sunsoft is equally known in Japan for \"kusoge\" such as Atlantis no Nazo and Ikki. Stuck somewhere in between the poles is Fester's Quest.\n\nSee, while this game was developed in Japan by the talented Blaster Master team, it was actually designed by a couple rookies in America.\n\nFester's Quest is known for its extreme difficulty, mostly due to a few questionable decisions and oversights. For example, the game has no lives or continue system—not out of malice for America's children, but because the designers simply neglected to mention any. The problem was realized too late, but the marketing team tried turning lemons into lemonade by selling it as an advertised feature.\n\nThe European version did make some concessions with the difficulty though. Namely it lets you shoot through walls, so your wave beam doesn't get stopped a few inches in front of your face inside all the narrow corridors.\n\nFor more stories on the game's creation, check out Kid Fenrisâs interview with two of the gameâs lead creators.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nGremlins 2: The New Batch\n\nNow hereâs a quality Sunsoft title. Probably one of their more overlooked ones too.\n\nLike Festerâs Quest, itâs an overhead game. But you can move diagonally and jump, adding a platforming element. Gizmo attacks by throwing tomatoes a short range. Defeating enemies drops crystals, which can be picked up and used as currency at shops. And the difficulty is fairly light in comparison to Sunsoftâs other games, so all-in-all itâs a nice little accessible game.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nGhostbusters\n\nA port of David Crane's computer game. It's awful in every way imaginable.\n\nInstead, check out The Real Ghostbusters Remastered, an impressive hack that completely overhauls the game so it's not awful in every way imaginable!\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nGhostbusters II\n\nWell, itâs a lot better than the first one at least. Still not amazing, but at least youâre not driving around doing chores the whole game.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nNew Ghostbusters II\n\nForget that OLD Ghostbusters II. The NEW Ghostbusters II is where it's at. This one was developed by Kirby kings HAL Laboratory. Unfortunately, it only saw the light of day in Japan and Europe. There were plans for a US release, and a prototype of it has been leaked online, but ultimately it never came to be. The Game Boy version did get a US release though, minus the \"New\" in the title.\n\nYou pick two characters; one to control and one to follow you. Press one button to stop a ghost in the beam, press the other to get the other guy to suck it up with the vacuum. Catch all the ghosts in a level to clear it. It also has co-op!\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nBram Stokerâs Dracula\n\nAre you sick of Dracula yet? You better not be.\n\nA fairly straightforward action-platformer. The camera can be pretty erratic since it rises when you jump and lowers when you duck. There arenât many enemies to fight, so itâs more focused on platforming and trap avoiding. The music is a cacophonious mess. Remember to press Down while jumping to smash through the ground! Otherwise youâll get stuck within the first minute.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nGhoul School\n\nCool School High has been overrun with with ghosts and demons! So youâre this punk ass teen, patrolling the halls, whappinâ monsters with a bat. You can enter classrooms and find other items to use, like the SPINAL ZAP, and the DIGESTARAY, andâ¦ and a sandwich.\n\nA bunch of neat-looking monsters in here too. Bogleech did an interview with the gameâs creator, Scott Marshall, who talks about a bunch of cool concepts that unfortunately didnât make it into the game due to time and hardware constraints. Despite its cool ideas though, the game is bit undercooked.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nDracâs Night Out\n\nA stair climbing simulator starring Dracula. I donât know. This game was actually unreleased, but a prototype was dumped and released online a long time ago. You can also set traps or something. Be sure to pick up the ReebokÂ® Pumps to put some speed in your step!\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nThe Adventures of Dr. Franken\n\nYour girlfriend got chopped up to pieces and itâs your job to find her body parts and reassemble her. Got it? You got that? Good.\n\nThis game came out for the Game Boy and SNES, but the NES version was cancelled. Thankfully, a prototype for this one was also found and released. Itâs pretty clumsy and confusing.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nDevil World\n\nThis oneâs maybe more cute than spooky. Devil World is an early Pac-Man-esque game from Nintendoâ¦ really earlyâ¦ like 1984 early.\n\nEach round has two âlevel typesâ. Like Pac-Man, in the first part you gotta collect all the dots in the maze. But to pick them up, you need to first grab a cross, which disappears after a short time. This cross also allows you to shoot fireballs, which briefly turns enemies into fried eggs you can chomp. The second part of the round has you collecting bibles in the corner of the screen and bringing them to the red skull box in the center.\n\nAll the while, the Devil up there at the top of the screen is controlling the play field. The maze is larger than the screen and loops around on itself. The Devil makes the screen scroll in whichever direction he pleases. This keeps you boxed in and also adds the risk of getting squished between the walls.\n\nThis game came out in Japan and Europe (much later), but never made it to America, most likely due to its heavy religious themes. But itâs a nice little game (designed by Shigeru Miyamoto!) and also includes co-op.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nSeikima II: Akuma no Gayakushuu\n\nA game based on a famous Japanese metal band. Itâs not a sequel, the band is actually named Seikima II. Itâs a pretty basic action game where you gotta collect all the items in a stage I guess. Pretty charming though. But the music is really high pitched and hard on the ears, which isnât particularly good for a game about a music act.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\n\nI don't get this game. Nobody gets this game. What the hell is this game?\n\nFrom what I can gather, it first involves playing as Dr. Jekyll, a defenseless man who must walk from one end of the town to the other while being mobbed by townsfolk(?). Upon your innevitable death, you transform into Mr. Hyde, who walks from the opposite end of the town shooting monsters with his PSYCHO-WAVE(??). And if Hyde crosses the spot that Jekyll died, it's game over(???).\n\nThe Japanese version includes two additional levels, which were inexplicably removed from the US release. But can you really have too much of a good thing?\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nChiller\n\nHow do get a port of one of the most infamously gruesome and violent video games approved for a console with infamously strict censorship policies? The answer: You donât. This is an unlicensed port of the arcade light gun game and it ainât pretty. Sure is campy though. (And censored.)\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nRobodemons\n\nAn unlicensed game from Color Dreams, who brought us timeless classics such as Menace Beach and Raid 2020. This guy with a boomerang has to defeat an army of robot demons made by this fat demon guy named Kull. Heâs the the king of Hades. And probably not very nice.\n\nLevels are split into two different game types: a horizontal space shooter type part and a platformer part. The game has you traversing such spooky locations as THE LEVEL OF BONE and THE LEVEL OF FLESH, which is just an unreadable mess of body organs.\n\nItâs terrible. Really terrible. Like maybe the worst game on this list. (Okay, maybe not worse than Ghostbusters.)\n\nA year after releasing this demonic abomination, Color Dreams formed Wisdom Tree and exclusively made Christianity-themed games. Wisdom Tree somehow still exist to this day, lurking somewhere in the shadows.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nTaboo: The Sixth Sense\n\nOkay, this isnât particularly Halloweenish, or even a game at all. Itâs a tarrot card reader from Rare. The readings you get are kind of cryptic and incomprehensible. That can be pretty spooky though, right? The manual warns that it is not intended for children under the age of 14, so you know this is some serious shit. Also it may curse your life.\n\nSPOOK-O-METER:\n\nThese games are sort of related, but didnât quite make the cut for whatever arbitrary reason I decided. Usually they have a few typical horror/Halloweenish elements, but not quite enough to warrant listing. Or maybe theyâre lacking in a certain variety of horror. I donât know. Check 'em out for yourself.\n\nAbadox\n\nAlien 3\n\nDigital Devil Monogatari: Megami Tensei\n\nDigital Devil Monogatari: Megami Tensei II\n\nGetsu Fuuma Den\n\nJaws\n\nMetroid\n\nNinja Jajamaru-kun\n\nNinja Kid (aka GeGeGe no Kitaro)\n\nPhantom Fighter\n\nSwamp Thing\n\nWerewolf: The Last Warrior\n\nYoukai Douchuuki\n\nZombie Hunter\n\nHellraiser\n\nIâd also like to use this space to mention the unreleased Hellraiser game by Color Dreams (which surely would have made the list). Being it was from Color Dreams, it probably wouldnât have been too good. But whatâs interesting about it is the technology that was planned to be in the cartridge. Dubbed the âSuper Cartridgeâ, it contained an extra processor inside that would supposedly âdouble the processing powerâ of the NES using a bunch of trickery. The game was apparently going to play similarly to Wolfenstein 3D, somehow.\n\nDevelopment didnât get very far off the ground. According to an interview with Dan Lawton, one of the founders of Color Dreams: âThe hardware was done, and the artwork was 20% done, there was no programming. It was a 45 degree down angle view, with a maze of stone and walls and pits.â So, donât expect much in the way of a prototype.\n\nUltimately, the game would be too expensive to produce, and the market for it was too small, so the project was eventually canned.\n\nSplatter World\n\nAnother one currently lost to the ethers of time; Splatter World was set to be a Splatterhouse RPG molded in the goofy stylings of Wanpaku Graffiti. Scheduled for a March 1993 release, this newly discovered mystery game would've been one of the very last releases for the Famicom. It looked to have a bit of an EarthBound-y feel.\n\nThe game would've starred Rick and his girlfriend Jennifer as they traveled the horror world and met new friends, including a guitar-shredding Freddy parody named \"Grady\". The party members would be able to perform \"channeling\" by posessing themselves with the spirits of defeated enemies to launch powerful attacks. A \"zombie\" system also allowed members and even enemies to rise from the dead and keep fighting, with limited abilities. NPCs also would've reacted differently to you whether you were in zombie form.\n\nDespite the world of cancelled NES/Famicom games being a heavily documented field, this game's entire existence escaped notice until 2024 when a Japanese blogger discovered an obscure promotional tape with footage of the game. This tape was only sent to retailers with connections to Namco for in-store use only. Otherwise, the game was seemingly never even publicly announced to magazines or anything.\n\nBio Hazard\n\nHere's a Chinese bootleg version of Resident Evil released in 2003. It actually seems like a pretty decent conversion for a bootleg. Aside from the atrocious music and tendency to crash a lot. The battle system is based on Resident Evil Gaiden for the Game Boy Color and apparently has Zapper support? Also all the text is in Chinese. But a translation patch was released in 2014.\n\nKirby's Halloween Adventure\n\nAlright, I wouldn't typically include a ROM hack on this list, but this one's too good not to. Created by Kirb-Star in 2020, this hack gives a darker twist to the cutesy Kirby's Adventure. New enemies, new levels, and even new level themes spice up a familiar classic. The updated graphics are great, and straddle the line between cute and spooky very well. Download the patch and give it a spin!\n\nFinally, I wanna toss this one out there, just cuz. Itâs a public domain ROM made in 1999 by Memblers, a real OG of the NES homebrew scene. Basically it just displays this screen while a chiptune rendition of the Halloween movie theme plays. But if you press a button it changes to a different song and blood oozes down the screen. The ROM can be found under the name âHalloween Demoâ, or just âHalloweenâ. Neato.\n\nNES development sure has come a long way in the ~25 years since this demo was released. But it's always nice to step back and remember your roots.\n\nFinally, at long last, that's it. That's a list of over forty Halloween delights for the Nintendo Entertainment System to enjoy. Not all of them are winners, but not all the candies in your trick-or-treat bucket were winners either. Sometimes you got chocolate, sometimes you got a nasty butterscotch thing. But that's part of the fun of it all â¦ right?\n\nThanks for reading this big long thing. (Or just skipping to the end and reading this part.) I hope somebody out there found it inspirational or educational or entertaining. I put a lot of effort into creating it for Tumblr in 2013, and I also put a lot of time into \"remastering\" it for Neocities in 2023. Thanks to anybody who's bothered following me during those 10 years, and anyone who's bothered following me since. Even if it was just a moment. It's appreciated.\n\nBut what will 2033 hold? How about I finally compile a list of individual Halloweenish levels in NES games? Ha ha â¦ ha â¦ maybe not.\n\n~Happy Halloween~\n\nBACK | HOME"
