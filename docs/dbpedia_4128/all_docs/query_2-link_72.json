        "text": "Product: The Sims 4\n\nPlatform:PC\n\nWhich language are you playing the game in? English\n\nHow often does the bug occur? Often (50% - 99%)\n\nWhat is your current game version number? 1.89.214.1030 (PC)\n\nWhat expansions, game packs, and stuff packs do you have installed? Base game, Get Famous, Pets, Seasons, Cottage Living, Spa Day, Vampires, Parenthood, Tiny Living, Movie Hangout, Paranormal Stuff, Realm of Magic, Vintage Glamour, Dream Home Decorator\n\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? You don't have to do anything to get this bug - just have your Sims try to mind their own business! Everyone comes into their house uninvited!\n\nWhat happens when the bug occurs? NPCs will casually walk into my sims' house uninvited with no option to ask them to leave. Using the \"Disallow Neighbours\" option does nothing to stop them, nor does the \"Private Dwelling\" lot trait.\n\nWhat do you expect to see? Sims should only come into my Sims' house if they're invited in (or if they're Paparazzi or Vampires, or otherwise NPCs whose mechanics involve coming in uninvited, as opposed to random townies).\n\nHave you installed any customization with the game, e.g. Custom Content or Mods? Yes\n\nDid this issue appear after a specific patch or change you made to your system? Neutral/Not Sure\n\nâ€Œ\n\nI have tried several of my saved games and so far this has only occurred in the one new game file I've started since installing Spa Day, Get Famous, Movie Hangout, and Dream Home Decorator (they were bought as a bundle and installed at the same time). I have checked one of my oldest games to see if it happens but so far I haven't noticed it.\n\nAs previously said, random Townies, including pets, will march right in and grab food, watch TV, and generally entertain themselves. One of my sim has some celebrity points from posting to her social media but no official celebrity status so it's not paparazzi or vampires. \"Disallow Neighbours\" doesn't deter anyone, nor does the private dwelling trait.\n\nThe sims and pets coming in are not being invited by my own sims, in fact usually it's NPCs my sims don't know. As such there's no Goodbye/Ask to Leave/Send Home option. Just the introductions!\n\nThe only thing that works is locking the door completely, for anyone but my household, but then that prevents my sims' friends from coming over, and as soon as I unlock the door to let guests in, uninvited sims make a beeline for it. Literally locked the door as I saw Mortimer Goth walking up to it uninvited, later I unlocked it for my sim's friend to visit, and Mortimer literally ran into my house and started making popcorn as soon as I did! Not sure if that means townies hang around when I lock the door but a lot of them do come into my garden so I assume they do, so I might have to figure out a way to lock the gate as well.\n\nThought this was a fairly innocuous bug at first but I find myself spending more time trying to hunt down who's on my lot and force them to go home than actually doing what I want to be doing! The only way I have been able to send unwanted sims home is to download MCCC, and LittleMsSam's Lock/Unlock Doors For Chosen Sims mod, which lets you lock/unlock doors for NPCs. I think the latter has a limit of 20 so once I've got 20 unwanted guests blocked I suppose I'll have to use MCCC again to control the invaders and force them to go home. As this was happening before the mods, I don't believe either of them is causing the bug. I had no other mods beforehand, and I use no custom content.\n\nIn previous threads I've seen people say they experience this more in specific neighbourhoods, so for the record I'm playing in Newcrest (where I've played in other saved games and have not had this happening).\n\nI've found previous threads about this but I haven't found any solution, and this was apparently fixed in a previous patch from about a year ago.... but my game is up to date (according to Origin), so... the bug is back Any help super appreciated!"
