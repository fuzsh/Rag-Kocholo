        "text": "Description:\n\nIf you are looking for a dark show you have come to the right place! \"The Uninvited\" is our take on the classic Haunted Mansion show but with a twist. This show requires a full time cast to be the family in the house that does not see the spirits played by the battery. The real question in the end is who are the Uninvited?\n\n“The Uninvited” was originally the Independent World class Bronze Medalist at WGI Championships in 2017 performed by Pulse Percussion. This show was released for the 2018 indoor season.\n\n*Perusal score available upon request\n\nPermission to arrange and perform would need to be granted to purchase this show due to the inclusion of 2 copyrighted songs. There is an additional $360 publisher fee (approximate and subject to change) for the use of the songs, “If I Had a Heart” by Fever Ray and \"Uninvited\" by Alanis Morissette."
