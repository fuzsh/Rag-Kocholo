        "text": "I was reminiscing today about an old game I played, and actually really enjoyed, which is called War of The Ring. It is a LOTR game, and an RTS but in the vein of Warcraft 3, and not like the other LOTR RTS games like Battle for Middle Earth. And I just remembered it came in two different covers. I got the orc cover.\n\nI only played the single player, and I had a blast summoning balrogs, creating armies of invisible Harad soldiers, and also armies of invisible Elven archers. I remember being able to solo entire missions with only the hero unit (they were all pretty OP). Boromir could easily solo his siege of Osgiliath mission, and Aragorn had a kingsfoil self heal so he was pretty unstoppable. There was also a special power you could put on your heroes which up'ed their stats, and Aragorn was literally unkillable with it. You could just wade into whole armies and win, it was ridiculous.\n\nI also remember just hunkering down in the evil campaign and creating the ringwraiths, then attack moving with a big army. Good times.\n\nAnd yet, I never read or hear about anyone playing this game! It isn't an amazing game by any stretch, but it isn't awful. I don't think it had a lot of advertisement and publicity, and I think it deserves a little better, because it is a completely serviceable game.\n\nI can barely find any youtube videos for it either, like this game seems to be a rare piece of software, haha.\n\nDoes anyone know about this game???\n\nAlso, do you have your own game that seems to have come in under the radar, and stayed there?\n\nOdin Sphere. There's been some name dropping now and then because of the recent HD release. But in the 10 years since the original game I have yet to see anybody actually discuss the story, characters or the game(play) on any level of relevance (not to mention the beauty of the game, which is one of those 2D pseudo hand-drawn Vanillaware titles). I think it has a pretty good story, and told in a pretty clever way too, and some very interesting characters. But I guess because it came out in a time of generational upheaval - a PS2 game released in 2007 - it was mostly ignored.\n\nHawki said:\n\n-Golden Sun (very popular within its fanbase, very obscure outside it)\n\n-Marathon (completely overshadowed by Doom, and mostly forgotten)\n\n-Spyro the Dragon (though I guess being held hostage by Skylanders doesn't help)\n\nI would say Golden Sun and Spyro are pretty well known. At least, Golden Sun is always brought up in underrated games lists. Spyro was pretty popular during it's heyday.\n\nMarathon though, that is a great game. Definitely should be talked about more, it basically improved upon Doom in every way. I like Dooms aesthetic better though, there's nothing like mucking demonspawn.\n\nI could go for a Marathon remake by Bungie.\n\nThat and another Oni.\n\nGlongpre said:\n\nSilentpony said:\n\nChaos Gate. A damn good Warhammer 40k game.\n\nlmao, I feel like there are so many Warhammer games, but I have only heard about them within the last couple years. I thought it was starting to be used in videogames since Dawn of War, but there are tons of games going back a while. It really surprised me.\n\nI thought it was only becoming popular now, to use the Warhammer settings. But nope.\n\nIts funny. When I was 6 maybe 7 my parents took me to the Toronto plaza Games Workshop, because my dad was big into models(Trek and Wars mostly) and wanted to spark that in me too. He bought me a deck of Citadel Combat Cards, an old card game based off 40k. Still have it, BTW. And I was obsessed with the models on the cards. Love all of them.\n\nThen about a year my cousin introduced me to Warhammer 40k Chaos Gate and Final Liberation. And again, I was obsessed. I played every 40k computer game that came out. Obsessed. And I swear this is true, for nearly 6 years I played 40k games and this little card game, and never knew you could buy models or about the tabletop game! No one told me! And the interwebs wasn't really a thing, so I couldn't find out!\n\nThen one day, the same cousin, brought his Space Marine army over and convinced my dad to drive us to a local GW. And the rest, as they say, is plastic army bliss history.\n\nGlongpre said:\n\nI would say Golden Sun and Spyro are pretty well known. At least, Golden Sun is always brought up in underrated games lists. Spyro was pretty popular during it's heyday.\n\nSpyro's well known, but the criteria of the thread was \"never talked about\" rather than \"forgotten\" (there'd be a lot of overlap, but not 100% between those two categories). I included Spyro because I rarely see him talked about in isolation. He may be brought up as part of a discussion about Skylanders, but rarely in isolation.\n\nGlongpre said:\n\nMarathon though, that is a great game. Definitely should be talked about more, it basically improved upon Doom in every way. I like Dooms aesthetic better though, there's nothing like mucking demonspawn.\n\nI could go for a Marathon remake by Bungie.\n\nThat and another Oni.\n\nFor me, it's basically Doom having the better gameplay (or more enjoyable gameplay at least, even if Marathon did introduce a whole slew of mechanics), while Marathon has the better story. But yeah, I'd love a Marathon remake. I mean, Doom got one that, personal thoughts aside, did quite well.\n\nOH! There are SO many I want to talk about!!!!\n\nFor example the latest game I played is \"Love at First Sight\"\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/353330/?l=greek\n\nBut with all honesty, I find difficult to discuss the fetish I found in this title, because one of them is new to me\n\nLike, did you know there is Food and scars fetish? I am serious.\n\nPlay the game to see what I mean.\n\nBtw, the game is for ALL AGES, even if have these kind of subjects.\n\nStill weird though.\n\nHarbinger\n\nThis game is to my knowledge the only isometric sci-fi diablo-clone, and I never hear anyone..anywhere..talk about it.\n\nIt barely runs on win 8 so I'm dying for some similar stuff.\n\nLike, right now. Give! Me!\n\nLost Empire: Immortals\n\nIn terms of max stars (5000), this is by far the biggest (and most beautiful zoomed out 'verse) 4X game.\n\nIt had some problems out of the gate that still remains and some of the gameplay aspects are lacking.\n\nThough I firmly believe that if it had been received better and sold more I wouldn't even write this post since I'd be too busy playing Lost Empire III, the perfected sequel.\n\nA man can dream. ,)\n\nConquest: Frontier Wars\n\nNot quite an RTS, nor a 4X game. Still fun though.\n\nImagine a whole lot of small maps being connected via one or two wormholes to each-other.\n\nYou have to set up shop in everyone, defend the wormholes and build stations around the planets in order to amass enough materials to support a fleet to crush your opponents.\n\nFun!\n\nPerimeter: Emperors Testament\n\nThere was a time in my life that I played, and somewhat enjoyed RTS games. Shocker, I know.\n\nNot that many RTS games being released today, or even talked about but even when they were, this one went under the radar completely.\n\nStartopia\n\nThis one is a lot more talked about, or at least it used to be. Not so much today.\n\nI loved the camera controls and I'm always up for a building sim.\n\nIt needs a sequel!\n\nNobody seems to remember Vagrant Story at all, and that's just sad. I played the shit out of it when it came out in 2000; it had an evolving-weapon system (if you used a weapon to exclusively kill dragon-type enemies, it would become better and better against dragons, until you were able to just two- or three-shot even dragon-type bosses!), a legitimately tense atmosphere, and some of the best damn mindscrew and plot twists on the PS1. I just wish it could have been on the PS2 with voice acting and better graphics."
