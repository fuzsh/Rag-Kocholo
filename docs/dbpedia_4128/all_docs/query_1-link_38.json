Originally released between 1987-1991, each stand-alone adventure features the same mind-blowing puzzles, graphics and music that mesmerized generations of console gamers!\n\nNow is your chance to play \"Shadowgate™\", \"The Uninvited™\" and \"Déjà Vu™\" the way they were supposed to be played, with a controller in hand and worlds waiting to be explored! Set within the realms of fantasy, horror and film noir, these three fantastic stories are a must have for those who enjoy traditional adventure games made of tougher stuff.\n\nTo enhance your experience, the compilation features a new 8-bit style menu, beautifully composed chip tunes and the most outstanding 'old TV' effects you've ever seen.\n\nTizoc\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n23,792\n\nOman\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n#2\n\nThese titles will release on other platforms down the line too.\n\nThese are different to the PC versions on Steam right?\n\nWonder if we get some of the JP music a few of these games had.\n\nsrhltmr\n\nUser Requested Ban\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n1,294\n\nTexas\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n#3\n\nThree of my favorite NES games.\n\nHint for Shadowgate:\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nMarkMan\n\nArcade Stick Dev\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n403\n\nSan Diego, CA\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n#4\n\nThese titles will release on other platforms down the line too.\n\nThese are different to the PC versions on Steam right?\n\nWonder if we get some of the JP music a few of these games had.\n\nIt should be on the Xbox One marketplace now as well.\n\nTizoc\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n23,792\n\nOman\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n#5\n\nYeah and it's on Steam now.

But I do take issue with this:\n\nNow is your chance to play \"Shadowgate™\", \"The Uninvited™\" and \"Déjà Vu™\" the way they were supposed to be played, with a controller in hand and worlds waiting to be explored!\n\nThe games were originally on the Mac, and inherently designed around a point-and-click interface. I very much challenge \"The way they were supposed to be played\"!\n\nAlso, it seems weird to exclude Deja Vu II. There's four titles in the series, why make an incomplete compilation?\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n#23\n\n7€ for 3 emulated nes games, hmmm.

It's smacks of it being in this form because this form is what they can supply. I wonder if they don't have access to the Mac originals for whatever reason, and so were only able to port the NES versions.\n\nWonder what emulation base it's using.\n\nEdit: Fair's fair, it's also possible that they thought the modern audience wouldn't take to mono graphics!\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n#28\n\nOh wow.

Not to port beg but I assume there is no word on a Switch version?\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n#37\n\nBuying this ASAP. I need to sit down and actually re-play these (I always get to a specific point in Shadowgate).\n\nDeja Vu and Shadowgate used to creep me out so much as a kid in the late 80s. The music is simultaneously so good and anxiety fuel.\n\nNo Depth\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n18,919\n\nNov 1, 2017\n\n#38\n\nTrophies are interesting. Purely based on unique deaths, none for completing each individual game or reaching milestones. (Though I suppose some deaths require late game progression). Just a bit strange, but the port is nice so far.\n\nMy biggest wish was for a button keyed to alternate verbs. Like clicking x will always examine if no other verbs are highlighted, but contextually why not have square set to obvious interactions like open a door, or take a torch. Like right clicking in a Lucas game usually is preset to obvious interactions like talk. Just a way to avoid constantly dragging the cursor to obvious needed verbs.\n\nfiendcode\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n25,222\n\nNov 1, 2017\n\n#39\n\nVol. 2 could be the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective trilogy or maybe Beyond Shadowgate and Shadowgate 64.\n\nAlso, it seems weird to exclude Deja Vu II. There's four titles in the series, why make an incomplete compilation?\n\nThe NES port of Deja Vu II was canceled. Kemco did eventually release it bundled with the first game on GBC though.\n\nWell, outside of the original carts of course. Have they not been on virtual console?\n\nOnly Shadowgate, only on 3DS, and only in Japan. :/\n\nPilgrimzero\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n8,129\n\nNov 1, 2017\n\n#40\n\nDidn't a remake of Shadowgate come out a couple of years ago via Kickstarter?\n\nNov 1, 2017\n\n#41\n\nDidn't a remake of Shadowgate come out a couple of years ago via Kickstarter?\n\nYes, and it is fantastic.\n\nTempy\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,336\n\nNov 3, 2017\n\n#42\n\nThese games are good fun. I have the NES carts, but I should grab it on Steam as well.\n\nNov 3, 2017\n\n#43\n\nThese games are good fun. I have the NES carts, but I should grab it on Steam as well.\n\nDo it! The Steam version has full mouse support and plays like a dream.\n\nKainXVIII\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n5,336\n\nNov 3, 2017\n\n#44\n\nHmm it's on Steam too: http://store.steampowered.com/app/664850/8bit_Adventure_Anthology_Volume_I/\n\nI wonder if it has mouse support there. Probably not but would be nice.\n\nThere is also\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/343820/Dj_Vu_MacVenture_Series/\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/343810/The_Uninvited_MacVenture_Series/\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/343800/Shadowgate_MacVenture_Series/\n\nWith mouse support =) I wonder why we need so many rereleases of these games, they were no particularly good (in my opinion)\n\nGillianSeed79\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n2,509\n\nNov 3, 2017\n\n#45\n\nSweet will pick this up. Shadow gate NES is my jam. I don't like the Mac versions. The Shadow gate remake that came out a couple of years ago via kick starter was pretty good too. Weren't they working on a Shadow gate 64 remake?\n\nKainXVIII\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n5,336\n\nNov 3, 2017\n\n#46\n\nWeren't they working on a Shadow gate 64 remake?\n\nEnding of Shadowgate remake clearly hinted at Beyond Shadowgate.\n\nOyashiro-Sama\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n2,672\n\nNov 3, 2017\n\n#47\n\nI love Shadowgate. Bought this as soon as I saw it on the store.\n\nWhat would be in Vol. 2?\n\nmclem\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n13,888\n\nNov 3, 2017\n\n#48\n\nWith mouse support =) I wonder why we need so many rereleases of these games, they were no particularly good (in my opinion)\n\nI think a key thing is that due to the console releases, they're one of the few adventure series to span two very distinct audiences. It's a bit of a shame when I've been waiting and hoping for rereleases from the likes of Legend Entertainment or Magnetic Scrolls, though!\n\nNov 3, 2017\n\n#49\n\nI always wanted to play these games but never had the chance. This looks great! Thinking Steam is the way to go given there is mouse support."
