        "text": "Your name is Victor Kingston. You were chosen to conduct the ritual to summon the Formless Devourer to consume the evil that will soon come. Unfortunately, you were late to the summoning and now all hell has broken loose. In a last desperate attempt to save humanity, you grab your pack and head to the nearby forest to conduct the ritual once more. Activate powerful statues, hide wherever you can and most importantly, do NOT let them see you...\n\nWhat's the goal?\n\nYou must scour the forest in search of gears to unlock the ritual doors. Once all four of the Formless Statues have been activated, the ritual will be complete. This won't be a simple task. You must use your wit and resourcefulness to hide and evade the Uninvited whilst you explore the forest.\n\nNo forest is the same...\n\nThe map randomly generates every time you play, making each run feel a little different from the last. But your objective remains the same, complete the ritual.\n\nA short and mildly difficult one shot type horror game I made in two weeks to try and get my game dev groove going after a month long hiatus. Was a bit experimental with this one. While the game may be a bit difficult to play due to it's heavy emphasis on hiding and not getting caught, I do hope people will enjoy the learning curve and have some fun with it!"
