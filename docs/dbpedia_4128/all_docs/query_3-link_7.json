        "text": "The Uninvited is not a normal play…\n\nSet in 1874, The Uninvited immerses the audience in the lives of nine characters who live in, or orbit around, the Gallier House. It is six years after architect James Gallier Jr.’s death, and his wife, two of his daughters, and household staff members Charity and Rene are preparing for an evening of entertaining when a mob of young men passes by, seeking to re-segregate the integrated school next door. News of the mob and an uninvited guest disrupt the household and expose the race and class divisions embedded in the characters’ lives. The event is based on real-life incidents that took place in December 1874.\n\nOn January 10th, 2020, Goat in the Road and Hermann-Grima + Gallier Historic Houses opened The Uninvited to sold-out houses and critical acclaim. The show ran through Saturday, March 7th before closing due to COVID.\n\nProduction information…\n\nDirected by Chris Kaminstein & Kiyoko McCrae\n\nSet Design by Owen Ever\n\nCostume Design by Kaci Thomassie\n\nLighting Design by Joshua Courtney\n\nStage Manager: Kit Sternberger\n\nAsst. Stage. Manager: Mary Davis\n\nAsst. Costume Designer: Baylee Robertson\n\nFeaturing: Brian Egland, Shannon Flaherty, Darci Fulcher, Ian Hoch, Dylan Hunter, Tenaj Jackson, Grace Kennedy, April Louise (first six weeks), Jessica Lozano, and Constance Thompson (last two weeks).\n\nThe Uninvited was created by the lead artist team (Shannon Flaherty, Denise Frazier, Owen Ever, Chris Kaminstein, and Kiyoko McCrae) and the ensemble, as well as Abéo Tibbs."
