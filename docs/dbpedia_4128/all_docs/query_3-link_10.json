        "text": "Uninvited is a song written and recorded by Alanis Morissette for the soundtrack for City of Angels.\n\nIt was released as a single from the soundtrack, but was ultimately left off of her second international album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, due to the soundtrack album’s successful sales as a result of both this and Irish by Goo Goo Dolls.\n\nAfter the massive success of Jagged Little Pill, Alanis was considered one of the biggest music stars in the world. While many fans anxiously awaited a follow-up album – which would ultimately be Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie in November 1998 – Uninvited was chosen as the lead single from the City of Angels soundtrack prior to that.\n\nUninvited was released to American radio stations in March 1998 and was still receiving substantial radio airplay by the following August. The song was due for release on March 31, but was leaked on March 6. After KROQ, a popular station in Los Angeles, played the song, fans quickly recorded it and began to upload it to the internet. Though the Recording Industry Association of America would assist in taking down several websites that hosted the song, Warner Brothers was to release the entire soundtrack to radio before it became available in stores. A publicist for Warner Music Canada would later state that the measure was taken to stop radio stations from playing low-quality versions of the song downloaded from the internet.\n\nUpon its release, Uninvited received critical acclaim and became one of Alanis’ most successful songs. The song became Alanis’ fourth number-one single on Billboard’s Top 40 Mainstream chart. It also peaked at #4 on Billboard’s Hot 100 Airplay chart, #3 on Billboard’s Adult Top 40 Tracks chart and #26 on Billboard’s Modern Rock Tracks chart. According to Billboard, the song has sold more than 7 million singles.\n\nUninvited won two Grammys in 1999: for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song. It was also nominated for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. The song also won an ASCAP Film and Television Award for Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures and received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song-Motion Picture."
