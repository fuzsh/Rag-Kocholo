        "text": "The Uninvited, American horror film, released in 1944, that is considered a classic of the genre, noted for its serious and understated take on the traditional ghost story.\n\nWhile on vacation, siblings Roderick (played by Ray Milland) and Pamela Fitzgerald (Ruth Hussey) impulsively purchase a house on the English coast. Their infatuation with the home diminishes, however, after they begin to encounter numerous oddities, including strange noises and smells and unexplained chills. Stella Meredith (Gail Russell), a young woman who lived there as child, becomes convinced that the house is inhabited by the spirit of her mother, Mary Meredith, who died after falling off a cliff when Stella was three. The house, however, proves unsafe for Stella, who is nearly killed one night. Soon afterward, a second presence is revealed, that of Carmel, the mistress of Stella’s father. It is eventually discovered that Carmel is actually Stella’s mother and that her ghost has been protecting Stella from Mary. After Roderick confronts Mary’s ghost, it leaves, and the spirit of Carmel, no longer needed to safeguard Stella, also disappears.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
