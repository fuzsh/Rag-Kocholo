        "text": "I’ve been watching a ton of Star Trek lately. And by that, I mean none other than the original series that ran for three seasons from 1966 through 1969. Many hundreds of hours of movies and television have bore the Trek name since, of course, but for me, none can compare with those first bold forays of Captain Kirk and crew into creative territory where no man had gone before.\n\nWhat is it about the ’60s show that captivates me so? I’m certainly not old enough to have caught it during its first run, having to wait instead until the mid-’80s, well into its decades-long stint in syndication. Yet as soon as I laid eyes on that colossal planet killing robot bearing down on Kirk’s shuttlecraft in the gripping final act of The Doomsday Machine, I was hooked. The aesthetics are a definite plus, from cinematographer Gerald Finnerman’s liberal splashes of primary color lighting, to costumer William Ware Theiss’ constant assurance that the 23rd century will indeed glitter, to Alexander Courage’s unforgettable score (just try to imagine hand-to-hand combat on an alien planet without his “Ancient Battle” theme from the episode Amok Time starting up unprompted in your head). In addition to this legendary production design, the original Trek has a plucky, can-do spirit forced upon it by its famously tight budget. Kirk’s starship Enterprise was frequently held together by little more than cardboard and hope, yet it managed to symbolize an enduring dream of a better future for us all. Finally, there’s that element of old-fashioned theatricality, even camp. For all the new ground it broke, ’60s Trek was a series with one foot firmly in the past. Sure, it set out to deliver a whole new breed of serious televised science fiction for adults. In the process, however, it didn’t hesitate to draw heavily on such venerable traditions as the Hollywood Western and high seas romances à la Horatio Hornblower. A character like the positively Falstaffian outer space con man Harry Mudd, for example, would be right at home on the deck of a seventeenth century pirate ship or peddling snake oil out of the back of a covered wagon on the outskirts of some dusty frontier boom town. There’s something endlessly charming to me about this penchant to be earnestly forward-thinking and just as earnestly quaint in the very same breath.\n\nAnyway, aren’t I supposed to review games? Yes, and 1991 saw a total of three bearing the grandiose title of Star Trek: 25th Anniversary. All three are completely different products, as often happened back in the days when the gaming market embraced a motley mix of 8 and 16-bit consoles, handhelds, and mutually incompatible computer operating systems. The one I’ve chosen to focus on is Star Trek: 25th Anniversary for my beloved NES, a top-down adventure offering from a then up-and-coming studio by the name of Interplay. You may have also heard of their minor hits Fallout and Baldur’s Gate. Probably not, though. Oh, and the first one of you to remind me that we’re fast approaching the franchise’s 60th now gets a photon torpedo to the dome.\n\n25th Anniversary aims for authenticity by structuring itself much like a typical tv episode, beginning with a cold open that sees the Enterprise sucked through a mysterious hole in space and ejected on the other side of the galaxy with the dilithium crystals that power its warp drive engines nearly drained. The crew’s dilemma: How to refuel, navigate home, and close that obnoxious space hole. After this rather well-presented little scene, we’re treated to an admirable NES recreation of the show’s iconic opening credits sequence. The only real compromise is a text crawl in place of Shatner’s “Space…The final frontier…” monologue.\n\nThis downright reverent attention to detail is by far 25th Anniversary’s greatest asset. In the role of Captain Kirk, you’re free to look around a nicely drawn rendition of the Enterprise bridge, consulting with Spock, Doctor McCoy, Scotty, and the rest of the gang. Once it’s time to get off your butt and do some planetary exploration, you get to ride the turbolift down to the transporter room and beam down in all the style such admittedly modest hardware is capable of. The attempt to deliver a truly immersive classic Trek experience extends to the soundtrack, most of which is faithfully adapted from the show. Expect no shortage of callbacks to fan favorite episodes, too, on top of some other random references (someone on the design team was a big Led Zeppelin fan).\n\nUnfortunately, while 25th Anniversary succeeds in capturing the tone of its source material, it’s all in service to a half-baked adventure that abruptly peters out right when it seems to be hitting its stride. It’s almost as though Interplay’s mandate to recreate the show extended to its notoriously harsh production schedule that prevented many of the writers’ best ideas from ever reaching the screen.\n\nNo doubt the skeleton of a great Trek game is on display here. You can direct the Enterprise to visit a total of seventeen different planets. Only four have anything (and I mean anything) on them. There’s a basic ship-to-ship combat system. It gets used exactly once. You can add specialist crew members from the ship’s biology, geology, history, and security divisions to your away teams. Each specialist has one, perhaps two actual uses over the course of a playthrough. You don’t even get anything resembling a proper climax to your mission. The last thing you do is use an item on a generic NPC and bam: End credits. Every indication is that the team at Interplay only had the resources to slap together the bare minimum of walking and menu management needed to nudge an adventure game past the hour mark. It’s a shame, since a quest line worthy of this license, presentation, and interface could have been something really special. As it is, I’d rather spend that hour on any given episode of the series instead. Well, maybe not The Alternative Factor. I’m not that bored.\n\nTruly singular video games are rare beasts indeed. Most fall neatly into one or more popular genres, making it easy, perhaps too easy, to fall back on such tried-and-true shorthand as “It’s a lot like Super Mario Bros., except…” or “Think Metroid with Star Wars lightsabers.” Then, every once in a blue moon, you encounter an Ihatovo Monogatari and that routine approach goes straight out the window.\n\nIhatovo Monogatari (“The Stories of Ihatovo”) is less a traditional game and more a digital love letter to the late Kenji Miyazawa. Miyazawa (1896 – 1933) wore many hats during his short life: Agricultural scientist, teacher, musician, devout Buddhist, peace activist, and more. He’s best known by far, however, as one of Japan’s most cherished literary figures. Though all but forgotten in the wake of his untimely death, his body of poetry and children’s stories was rediscovered by the Japanese public at large in the 1980s, and has since inspired numerous comic and movie adaptations. Arguably the strangest product of the Miyazawa centennial renaissance was this 1993 game for the Super Famicom.\n\nNow, I say “game,” but I wouldn’t argue too strenuously if you insisted on calling it a visual novel or similar instead. Ihatovo Monogatari follows the journey of a nameless train traveler who makes an unplanned extended stop in the sleepy town of Ihatovo. Anyone familiar with Miyazawa’s oeuvre will recognize this as the fictionalized version of his home province of Iwate that served as the setting for many of his tales. Based on the look of the place and the Charlie Chaplin features screening at the local cinema, we can assume this is the 1920s or thereabouts, the period said tales were written. Moreover, Kenji Miyazawa himself exists in this Ihatovo! The overarching goal is to track down eight of his lost journals before you’ll finally be granted an audience with him. In a way, Ihatovo Monogatari reminds me of one of my favorite animated films, The Adventures of Mark Twain, in that it’s a grand celebration of a beloved author in which the writer in question interacts with his own creations.\n\nEach missing journal is associated with a famous Miyazawa work. You must essentially play through an abridged take on that same story to acquire it. These expeditions are referred to as chapters in-game, and are generally quick and painless to complete. Ihatovo Monogatari demands nothing resembling player skill, be it by way of quick reflexes or puzzle-solving acumen. Expect no stats here, no combat, no death or other fail states, and no real choices to give you pause. All that’s required of you is to sit back and watch these stories unfold from the inside. If I had to break down the “gameplay” here, I’d say that you stroll around a handful of rather small locations trying to discover the correct order to speak with various NPCs in until the current chapter ends. Do this nine times and you win.\n\nAlthough technically accurate, the above summary would be a pretty disingenuous way to gloss over Ihatovo Monogatari’s ample charm. Even as an American completely unfamiliar with all things Miyazawa, the whimsical, yet bracingly somber tone of this material immediately struck me as something special. Yes, this is a town where adorable talking cats staff an office building. It’s also one where the sad lot of one of these kitties in particular, the darling Stove Cat, had me so concerned that I tracked down and read the story he appeared in (“The Cat Office”) just to learn the little guy’s fate. Despite being meant for children, Miyazawa’s world is no saccharine Disneyesque one. His Buddhist beliefs are evident in the way these narratives don’t shy away from depicting the grim consequences of greed, jealousy, and wrath, or the bittersweet aftermath of self-sacrifice. Complimenting the thoughtful mood is Tsukasa Tawada’s serene, classical-inspired musical score. As far as I’m concerned, the main Ihatovo Town theme has a rightful place among the very best “peaceful village” tracks of the era.\n\nAs an aside, it strikes me as downright odd that something so arty was developed by Hector (aka Hect), a largely unremarkable peddler of sports and horse racing titles. If it wasn’t for their underrated Famicom action-platformer Moon Crystal, Ihatovo Monogatari would probably be the only legitimately interesting Hect project. My instincts tell me there’s a fascinating behind-the-scenes history here, and if a developer interview ever surfaces, I’ll be first in line to read it.\n\nAnyway, is Ihatovo Monogatari a game? A visual novel? One of those dreaded “walking simulators?” Frankly, I don’t care. All I need to know is that I discovered it on a blustery fall day, tucked in with a mug of strong tea and listening to the rain beat against my window pane as I lost myself in a captivating vision of a fairy tale 1920s Japan that never was. And when it was all over, I was still sat there, pondering what I’d witnessed. Whatever else you want to call this, it’s beautiful, powerful, and wholly unique. Heartfelt thanks go out to DDSTranslation, Tom, and FlashPV for the superb English language patch that made my experience possible.\n\nOctober is back! How excited am I? Well, I’m currently sitting next to my lit jack-‘o-lantern, sipping a pumpkin crème tea blend in my pumpkin pajamas. This isn’t just a month for me, folks, it’s an entire state of being. In keeping with the tradition around here, I’ll be bringing you another set of five spooky game reviews for five classic consoles, starting this week with Deadeus.\n\nThis 2019 Game Boy homebrew title is the brainchild of Welsh artist Adam Birch, better known online as -IZMA-, and also features music by Stuart Busby. Promotional material for Deadeus bills it as “authentic horror,” an enticing promise indeed. Nintendo’s iconic handheld was famous for many things, but scaring you wasn’t one of them. Unless you were keeping tabs on your AA battery expenditures, I suppose.\n\nLong-time readers may note that this is my first time covering a true homebrew release. I’ve looked at several ROM hacks before, fan-made games built on the foundation of popular releases like Castlevania or Super Mario Bros. 3. Deadeus, by contrast, was created from the ground up with a programming tool called GB Studio. Befitting this origin, it plays like nothing else on the system. Broadly speaking, it’s an adventure game. You assume the role of an average small town kid who awakens one morning from a nightmare in which a hideous being claiming to be a god promises to destroy the world in three day’s time. Not long after, it’s revealed that your school friends all experienced the exact same dream. Adults are initially dismissive, yet an aura of secrecy and unease shrouds the village. Something is obviously amiss. Who (or what) is Deadeus, and can anything be done to stave off the coming apocalypse?\n\nThe three day structure obviously recalls The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask. I don’t believe that’s a coincidence, although direct comparisons will only get you so far. For one thing, there’s no way to “turn back the clock” in Deadeus, other than to reload your latest save file or start a fresh one from scratch. Secondly, there’s no actual timer ticking away as you go about your investigation. Each day lasts until you choose to end it by returning home and climbing into bed. The main similarity lies in the way that solving the game’s riddles depends largely on you memorizing NPC schedules, since many key items and events are tied to the villagers’ locations and actions on specific days. Regardless of the path you take, you’ll typically reach one of the eleven possible endings in well under an hour. The Groundhog Day dynamic that manifests across multiple playthroughs was sufficient to keep me playing long enough to see them all. Around three solid hours, all told.\n\nDeadeus is almost exclusively a story-driven affair. Mechanically, it may be easier to define it in terms of what it doesn’t include than what it does. There’s no combat of any kind, no stats or character progression, and exploration is limited by the extremely compact design of the town itself. It thus falls on the unnerving atmosphere and unorthodox narrative to carry the entire production. Fortunately, they’re more than up to the task. -IZMA- struck green and grey gold in the juxtaposition of sprites and environments that wouldn’t look out of place in Link’s Awakening or Pokémon with shadowy cults, bloody murder, and a flesh-reaping eldritch god. Busby’s soundtrack is phenomenal as well, hitting notes of melancholy, despair, and creeping madness you’d never have otherwise associated with the innocuous plastic brick you play Tetris on. Does the whole of it make for a genuinely harrowing time? I wouldn’t go quite that far. Of course, one really shouldn’t expect a degree of immersive terror on par with the top Silent Hill entries from even the best indie Game Boy effort. Deadeus is pervasively creepy, however, and the way it forces you to put yourself in the lead character’s shoes and consider what atrocities and sacrifices might be justified to save the world certainly hooked me. Best of all, it lingers. The way all good horror should.\n\nIf any of this sounds promising to you, I encourage you to download the latest version directly from -IZMA- for use with emulators and flash cartridges. Sadly, the physical release by Incube8 Games appears to be mostly sold out as of this writing. Deadeus’ payload of bleak existential dread in a nostalgic 8-bit wrapper is a fine example of the potential for homebrew developers to grow an old system’s library in entirely new and fascinating directions.\n\nWhat do you get when you combine an action-platformer, a point-and-click adventure, and an overhead shooter with a long dormant ’80s manga little known in the West? One strange game, obviously. Specifically, you get Sega’s 1988 Master System exclusive Kujaku Ō (“Peacock King”), or SpellCaster, as it was retitled in North America.\n\nKujaku Ō is the brainchild of the late manga artist Makoto Ogino. Longtime readers of mine might recognize Ogino as the creative force behind Tōgi Ō: King Colossus, an unjustly obscure Mega Drive action RPG I covered a few years back. The series concerns Kujaku, a Buddhist monk who uses his incredible spiritual superpowers to battle all manner of demonic entities. That’s more or less what we have on the Master System, although Kujaku himself was renamed Kane and given a new sleeveless outfit in place of his usual monk’s robes.\n\nWhen it comes to detailing SpellCaster’s exact plot, I actually struggle. There’s certainly loads of it and it draws heavily on some of Japan’s oldest founding myths with a dash of sci-fi for good measure. I spotted references to the conflict between the Yamato and Kumaso, the Three Sacred Treasures, the Orochi, etc. Even as a mythology buff who knows more about this stuff than the average person, however, I was in the dark much of the time. The translation is stilted and error-ridden, motivations are muddled, seemingly important characters disappear without a trace…it’s a mess. Basically, Kujaku/Kane has to stop an evil god from awakening and trashing everything.\n\nThe first 95% of SpellCaster alternates between two primary gameplay modes, which I’ll call action and adventure. The action sequences take the form of a routine side-scrolling jump-and-shoot exercise. Kane moves along at a slow jog and can execute a floaty jump. His standard attack is a small magic fireball that can be charged up for a bit of extra damage. He also starts out equipped with a total of nine spells that draw on a limited stock of energy points to do things like unleash various elemental attacks, heal damage, create a protective energy shield, and allow Kane to fly for a brief time.\n\nEffective as these spells are, you may find yourself reluctant to use them unless it’s absolutely necessary. Whenever you want to cast one, you’ll need to pause the game and select it off a menu. No problem, right? Recall, though, that the Master System’s designers infamously placed its pause button on the console itself instead of on the controller. If you’re playing SpellCaster with this sort of authentic setup, as I was, you’ll find it gets annoying fast. If only Sega could have implemented a button combination that allowed you to call up the menu with the controller. I’d take potentially triggering it by accident in the heat of combat over the alternative any day.\n\nMoving on to adventure mode, this is where you’ll move between locations, chat up NPCs, pick up key items, and generally advance the story. What you won’t be doing is a lot of puzzle or problem-solving. Despite aping the appearance of a true menu-driven adventure title like Shadowgate, these segments can be more accurately described as a procession of interactive cut scenes. Check your logic and reasoning skills at the door, as simply examining everything, talking to everyone, and running through every option on the list will see you through.\n\nJust when you think you’ve got SpellCaster down pat, it presents you with a finale that could have come straight out of Capcom’s Legendary Wings. Kane takes to the air in order to dispatch a series of four mini-bosses on his way to the final showdown. Incidentally, one of the four is the demon king Bael, who’s depicted exactly as he is in the classic woodcut illustration from Collin de Plancy’s Dictionnaire Infernal. That’s the sort of quirky mythological detail that warms my weird little heart. Good show, Sega! Anyway, this entire vertical shooting section is surprisingly well done, considering that it occupies mere minutes of an hours-long runtime. If they’d spun it off into its very own release, it would have beaten out some existing Master System shooters.\n\nSpellCaster is a unique and complicated beast that sadly ends up being rather less than the sum of its parts. The side-scrolling bits are largely uninspired and can be awkward to control, owing both to Kane’s stiff movement and (on real hardware) the clunky menu system. The adventure scenes offer no real challenge, while the narrative packed into them lacks basic clarity. The shooting part is fun, but you can blow through it in four minutes or less. You are at least provided unlimited lives and a password system, so it’s not an overly frustrating playthrough.\n\nI wanted to love this one on account of its experimental structure and the fact that Sega clearly set out to do full justice to Ogino’s work. No expense was spared on the graphics here, making SpellCaster quite the technical showpiece. Put it side-by-side with the Kujaku Ō Famicom game that came out around the same time and there’s no comparison. Unfortunately, novelty and some damn fine 8-bit pixel art are only enough to warrant the most lukewarm of qualified recommendations from me. I remain hopeful for a genuinely good Kujaku Ō game and I’m interested to see how SpellCaster’s Genesis sequel, Mystic Defender, continues the legacy.\n\nMurder was the case that they gave me.\n\nSometimes it’s good to branch out a little. I’m normally pretty content with my platformers, run-and-guns, action RPGs, and shooters. Okay, so “absurdly content” is more like it. Of the over 130 games I’ve covered in detail prior to today’s subject, there’s been only a handful that didn’t center on real time action of some kind. The most recent of these outliers was Chunsoft and Enix’s groundbreaking console RPG Dragon Quest (aka Dragon Warrior). It was in that review almost a year ago now where I briefly touched on Dragon Quest lead designer Yuji Horii’s first major success: Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken (“The Portopia Serial Murder Case”), an adventure game first published for home computers in 1983 and later converted to the Famicom in 1985, where its popularity exploded. Since that initial mention, I’ve known I would take on Portopia itself at some point.\n\nWhy? Because it’s completely unknown here in the West despite being one of the most influential games to ever appear on Nintendo’s 8-bit machine. I’m not exaggerating, either. For an entire generation of Japanese gamers, Portopia was a Super Mario or Legend of Zelda magnitude revelation. Clones started popping up almost immediately and the Famicom library as a whole is packed to the gills with menu-driven adventure games, many of which share similar detective mystery themes. Nintendo themselves eventually got in on the act with their Famicom Tantei Club series and celebrity game designer Hideo Kojima credits Portopia as the inspiration for his own Snatcher and Policenauts.\n\nPre-Internet NES owners were largely oblivious to this trend, as none of these text-heavy titles were picked for localization in their day. The sole exception was Hudson Soft’s bizzaro fantasy epic Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom for some reason. The closest thing we had here in North America was the occasional port of a domestic computer adventure game like Maniac Mansion. It wasn’t until the era of the Nintendo DS that heavily Portopia-inspired properties such as Phoenix Wright and Jake Hunter (Tantei Jingūji Saburō) would find themselves a home outside Japan. I’m thankfully able to experience Portopia myself courtesy of DvD Translations.\n\nAs with the later Dragon Quest, Horii’s masterstroke here was to start with a genre that was already popular in the small world of early ’80s computing and adapt it for the Famicom owning millions. This involved making some clever tweaks to the user interface in order to ease the transition from a full keyboard to a two-button Famicom pad. The computer version’s text command line is gone entirely, replaced by a menu containing every valid command and a cursor to allow for interaction with people and objects in the game world via those commands. Anyone familiar with ICOM Simulations’ MacVenture titles (Déjà Vu, Uninvited, and Shadowgate) will know the routine. As an aside, actually seeing Portopia’s menu system in action makes me understand at long last what Konami was getting at with those strange first-person adventure segments in The Goonies II. They were consciously attempting to hybridize their first Goonies release with Portopia and doing it in a very tongue-in-cheek way. After thirty long years, beating up on helpless NPCs to progress in Goonies II (also necessary during some of Portopia’s interrogation scenes) finally makes some degree of sense! These bits still aren’t very fun, but at least I get them now. Hallelujah!\n\nIn case you’re wondering, the name “Portopia” itself comes from Port Island, a large man-made landmass in the Kobe harbor that was officially opened to the public with a massive festival called Portopia ’81. It was (and is) quite the tourist magnet and triumph of Japanese engineering, so it would have seemed like a cool place to set a mystery story around this time. In the game, the player assumes the role of a seasoned police detective dispatched to investigate the apparent suicide of Kouzou Yamakawa, a wealthy bank president found stabbed to death inside a locked room in his mansion. Of course, nothing is ever that open-and-shut in a tale like this and it doesn’t take you long to determine Yamakawa was actually the victim of foul play.\n\nNow, when I say the player assumes the lead role in Portopia, I mean it. The game’s silent protagonist goes entirely unseen and unnamed throughout. For all intents and purposes, it’s you on the case. I love this choice, myself. It’s inherently immersive and takes advantage of the interactive medium to present the mystery in a way that just wouldn’t work in a detective novel, where the central figure obviously needs to be described to the reader in some fashion. You’re provided a Watson to your Holmes in the form of your junior detective colleague Yasuhiko “Yasu” Mano. Yasu is mainly there to provide exposition about your surroundings and backstory on the murder victim and the suspects. There turns out to be quite a lot to for the two of you to mull over as you delve into the sordid details of the not-so-innocent victim’s murky past.\n\nThis is a classic whodunit in the Agatha Christie tradition with all the red herrings and surprise revelations this implies. As a mystery lover myself, I couldn’t help but notice it bears a striking resemblance to one Christie work in particular. I won’t say which one, just in case you also happen to be well-read in the genre. While a lot of its beats are familiar, Portopia’s storyline actually works as a mystery yarn. Its ultimate solution is fair and the journey is even peppered with those seemingly irrelevant little details and apparent throwaway lines that only assume greater importance in hindsight. I love that trick.\n\nSo far, we’ve established Portopia as a historically important release with a nifty plot. How is it as an adventure game? In a word, rough. Portopia leaves much to be desired aesthetically. The graphics are decidedly crude and unappealing and I’m not just saying that because it’s an old game. For my money, there’s actually a tremendous amount of graphic design skill that goes into making the pixel art for a game as primitive as Pac-Man or Donkey Kong truly timeless. In contrast, Portopia’s in-game art looks like I could have contributed to it, and that is most definitely not a compliment. As far as the soundtrack goes, all I can really say is I’d critique it if I could. Enix didn’t see fit to include so much as a quick jingle for the title or end screens, just a handful of basic Famicom sound effects dotting a vast sea of stony silence. Conflict between the game’s extensive script and the severely limited space on early Famicom ROM chips likely explains why we didn’t get any music, but I’d venture to say the graphics could have still been much better drawn if the necessary care had been taken.\n\nPortopia’s frequent game design sins also bear mentioning. While its mystery plot plays remarkably fair by literary standards, its puzzles chuck the point-and-click rulebook out the window with wicked abandon. Numerous plot-crucial bits of evidence are invisible, requiring the player to click small, seemingly empty areas of the screen more or less at random in order to progress. Even worse, one puzzle late in the game that involves finding a secret in a sprawling Wizardry style first-person maze is so cunningly oblique that it comes across as hateful. Suffice to say the method required to reveal said secret is completely unlike the ones used to investigate literally every other area and object in the game. As much as I generally advise against playing any game with a walkthrough by your side, Portopia’s more hair-pulling moments are so absurd one could easily argue it cheated first.\n\nCapping this all off, there’s no password or other save mechanism built into the game. It’s short enough that you can beat it in mere handful of minutes once you already know the steps necessary, but if you’re working it all out the first time, expect to devote hours to the task. I hope you’re good at taking down notes in the event you need to break your playthrough up into multiple sessions. In fact, old-school paper note taking is encouraged in general, since adventure games of this vintage weren’t known for their user-friendly in-game journal futures.\n\nWhat we’re left with here is a great game with no great gameplay in it. In a sea of simple early Famicom arcade ports, platformers, and puzzle games, Portopia was a watershed. A gritty murder mystery set in an authentic modern Japan! Real characters! Plot twists and shocking revelations! Unfortunately, precisely none of this initial thrill is reproducible now. There’s still a solid detective story to be had here if you feel like digging for it, but shoddy presentation and some egregiously unfair puzzles make the total package less of a whodunit and more of a whocares.\n\nThe morning sun has vanquished the horrible night.\n\nThree Japan-exclusive horror games in a row? Why not? ‘Tis the season, after all!\n\nThis is 1995’s Clock Tower from Human Entertainment, also known as Clock Tower: The First Fear when it was later re-released as an enhanced port for PlayStation, PC, and the Bandai WonderSwan of all things. Like many of Human’s other non-sports titles (Monster Party, Kabuki Quantum Fighter), Clock Tower is an odd duck. To my knowledge, it’s the only point-and-click adventure game developed for the Super Famicom. These sorts of games were typically confined to home computers with native mouse support, and while you would occasionally see one ported over to a game console, most famously the NES version of Manic Mansion, creating one from scratch for a Nintendo system must have been a hard sell. Weirdest of all in my book: This isn’t one of the several dozen games which support the Super Famicom mouse accessory that came out in 1992. Huh.\n\nWhile this original Clock Tower title has never been officially released outside Japan in any of its various incarnations, all of its sequels have. Clock Tower 2 for the PlayStation was rather confusingly retitled simply Clock Tower outside of Japan, but make no mistake: These are two distinct games. Thankfully, I’m able to enjoy the Super Famicom original thanks to a fan translated reproduction cartridge.\n\nIn Clock Tower, you play as Jennifer Simpson, a young girl who has just been adopted from a Norwegian orphanage by wealthy recluse Simon Barrows, along with three of her fellow orphans, Anne, Laura, and Lotte. Soon after arriving at the Barrows mansion, Mary, the woman escorting them, leaves to go fetch the master of the house. Noticing that Mary is taking an unusually long time to return, Jennifer volunteers to go find her. Before she can travel far, she hears screams from behind her and rushes back to the foyer only to find it dark and empty, her three friends having seemingly vanished into thin air. Jennifer is now left all alone in the cavernous old house, mystified as to who or what is stalking her and her companions.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice once you take control of Jennifer is that this is a true point-and-click game. You have no direct control over Jennifer’s movements and are limited to using an on-screen cursor to indicate where she should walk or run to and what objects she should interact with. You can also press the X button to cancel your last issued command and bring her to a standstill if you change your mind once she’s underway. You’ll have plenty of time to think it over while en route, too, because the second thing you’ll notice is how absurdly slow Jennifer moves. Despite being under mortal threat at all times, she shuffles down long hallways like she’s leisurely perusing the exhibits at an art gallery. If you need to take a quick bathroom break while playing, just have her climb a flight of stairs, which takes the better part of a full minute on its own. You can double tap the button to make her run, but this will rather perversely deplete her color-coded stress meter, basically this game’s version of health, even if she’s not running away from any specific danger.\n\nYou’ll want to keep her stress level at a minimum because it directly affects her ability to survive attacks by the mansion’s hostile residents. If Jennifer is under assault, her portrait in the lower left corner of the screen will flash, indicating “panic mode.” When this happens, mashing the action button as fast as possible can save her, provided her stress is not already in the red. Once the immediate threat has passed, you can lower the stress level by resting, which is triggered by standing still in a safe area for a period of time. Make sure to do this as needed, as there are no weapons or attacks available in Clock Tower. Other than panic mode, Jennifer’s only other form of defense is hiding from a pursuer. There are several hiding spots scattered throughout the mansion, but they’re not always guaranteed to work. If you successfully hide, your attacker will wander off and Jennifer will be free to do more exploring. If it doesn’t, it’s game over. Thankfully, you’re given unlimited continues and they automatically put you back in the room where you died, so progress is never lost. I suppose this is one less thing to worry about, although it can bleed away a little of the game’s all-important tension if you stop to think about it too much.\n\nMost of your play time is spent exploring the various rooms of the Barrows estate, collecting inventory items, and using them to solve puzzles, which will allow you to progress to new areas and advance the story. Actually, calling them “puzzles” might be a bit of a stretch in most cases. I know this is a difficult balance to strike for any game like this. Too much abstruseness and you end up with the sort of “moon logic” scenarios many adventure gamers utterly despise. Giving a granola bar to a rat to get a wallet, that sort of thing. I get that. I would argue Clock Tower swings the pendulum a bit too much in the opposite direction, though. Does a gap in the floor with a wooden plank standing right up against the wall alongside it really constitute a puzzle? Unfortunately, it’s par for the course here. There’s nothing in the way of thought demanded. If a door is locked, just keep looking around until you find the key in a box or sitting on a desk or what have you. Pesky insects in your way? Keep checking rooms until you happen on some bug spray. This is probably Clock Tower’s biggest missed opportunity for me. It has enough well-executed horror (pun very much intended) to still be worth your time, but some properly satisfying brainteasers would have made it much more of a total package as far as games in this genre go. Perhaps the designers were afraid of alienating a console audience who may not have had much exposure to similar titles?\n\nBetween the complaints about the gratuitously slow movement and shallow puzzles, it’s sounding like I’m a bit down on Clock Tower as a whole. Let’s correct for that a bit, because it really gets a lot of other things very right.\n\nFirst and foremost, the sheer sense of atmosphere is practically unmatched on the system. It’s right up there with Super Metroid in its ability to pull you into its world with a one-two punch of sumptuous locations and brilliant sound design. Every room of the mansion is packed with eerie detail and has its own unique identity. Furthermore, all this detail is never allowed to get in the way of the gameplay due to the smart decision to have the cursor change shape from an arrow to a box whenever it passes over an object you can interact with. Important scenes and objects are also illustrated with close-up shots so intricately rendered they almost look like digitized photographs. Music is saved only for important locations and circumstances. Most of the time you’ll all alone with the sounds of creaking doors, distant screams, and Jennifer’s footsteps, which is great way to emphasize that looming threats can strike from anywhere at any time and to lend them even more impact when they finally do.\n\nThen there’s your nemesis, the infamous “scissorman.” This deformed maniac has the uncanny ability to appear when and where you least expect him, eager to put an agonizing end to Jennifer’s exploration of the mansion courtesy of his giant pair of shears. He isn’t the only fiend you’re up against, but he’s easily the most persistent and memorable of them all. Evading this pint-sized unstoppable freak is half the fun of Clock Tower. Most of the remaining half is trying, usually in vain, to anticipate his next appearance. It really does feel like an interactive slasher movie.\n\nClock Tower also has a decent amount of replayability. This is welcome indeed, as it’s a very short experience. The first trip through will likely take you an hour or two, but once you know how the game is structured, you can get that down to a half hour easily on subsequent sessions. The game employs a few tricks to keep these replays interesting. Key items and even some rooms within the mansion will switch places randomly, the exact item you need to locate in order to open the way to the final part of the mansion can vary, and even some plot elements and story scenes might only appear on some playthroughs. There are also nine different endings to discover and the game will keep track of which ones you’ve already seen. It won’t tell you exactly which actions you’ll need to take and which events you’ll need to witness in order to achieve each ending, however, so experimentation is encouraged. These endings are short, but fairly varied. Depending on what actions you take, Jennifer could meet an untimely end, wind up a sole survivor, or successfully save some of her friends.\n\nViewed strictly as a game, Clock Tower is extremely limited. As an interactive horror experience, it’s not to be missed. The game’s director, Hifume Kono, makes no secret of the fact that his goal was to make a game based on his favorite scary movies, particularly those of Italian auteur Dario Argento. The plot and characters of Clock Tower borrow extensively from Argento’s 1985 film Phenomena, right down to the name and look of the lead character. Even the music in Clock Tower seems to have been inspired by the scores prog rock band Goblin contributed to several Argento films. Kono has also stated that the scissorman was inspired by the famous hedge clipper massacre scene in the 1981 slasher flick The Burning. This makes two references to The Burning in two consecutive game reviews for me. How weird is that?\n\nIf you have any love for slasher movies, adventure games, or gorgeous 16-bit pixel art, you need to make time for Clock Tower.\n\nThe Goonies ‘r’ good enough for the NES…barely.\n\nMost everyone who was a kid at the time would agree 1985’s The Goonies is a pretty great movie. It boasts slick Spielbergian production design, a classic Robert Louis Stevenson style adventure plot about hidden pirate treasure, and that rarest of things: An ensemble cast of child actors who didn’t suck. Plus Sloth. Sloth is the man. Considering I just got back from a vacation to Astoria, Oregon where I toured the shooting locations and even went out to the Cannon Beach overlook with a replica of the doubloon coin from the film to reenact one of the scenes…well, I guess you could say I’m a fan.\n\nSo when Konami released The Goonies II in 1987, I was all over it. Unlike a lot of others who played this one back when it came out, I wasn’t confused by the name. Many thought it was supposed to be based on an upcoming sequel to the movie, but I had actually played Konami’s earlier Goonies game in arcades before and the resemblance is unmistakable. These days, the existence of this original Goonies game for the Famicom and its limited arcade release in North America is common knowledge, but it was easy enough to overlook at the time. Of course, Konami had also released a third Goonies game for the MSX computer system in Japan, so I guess we should be thankful they didn’t call this The Goonies III and really mess with our heads.\n\nComing off The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, I was primed for more games that combined action with exploration and secret hunting. Goonies II fit the bill, and I spent countless hours bombing and hammering every nook and cranny of the Fratellis’ hideout looking for hidden passages and items. That’s why it’s really tough for me to overcome my nostalgic attachment to this game long enough to admit it’s actually pretty bad.\n\nThis time, the Fratellis (the family of crooks who pursued our heroes in the movie) are back and they’ve kidnapped all your fellow Goonies as well as Annie! Who’s Annie? The mermaid, of course. You remember her, right? Yeah, even before you’ve made it past the title screen, you’ve already been given your first hint of how downright weird this game can be. Brace yourself, because you ain’t seen nothing yet.\n\nStarting up the game, things seem fairly promising. A nifty chiptune version of the beloved “The Goonies ‘R’ Good Enough” song by Cyndi Lauper kicks in and you find yourself controlling Mikey Walsh in traditional side-scrolling platformer style. Your task is to explore the Fratellis’ maze-like hideout and rescue all six of your missing Goonie pals plus the inexplicable Annie. Everything looks and sounds decent by 1987 standards, Mikey controls pretty well, and his main weapon, a yo-yo, is fun to use. These action scenes aren’t exactly great, but you’re probably having an okay time battling snakes, spiders, and the occasional gangster.\n\nIt’s only when you step inside one of the numerous doors scattered around the hideout that things start to go south fast. Surprise! Goonies II is also a first person point-and-click adventure game like Déjà Vu or Shadowgate! A really half-baked and boring one. Using a menu of basic commands, you can move between screens, punch walls to reveal hidden items, and use a small selection of tools you find during your quest (a hammer to uncover secret doors, a candle to light up dark areas, and so on). This had the potential to be compelling stuff. Unlike in the similarly-structured games mentioned above, however, there are no true puzzles to solve, cool locations to see, or even entertaining text descriptions of your actions to read. Just the exact same plain square rooms, where you’ll be expected to robotically run down your list of commands trying each one before moving on. There’s nothing challenging or stimulating to be found in these portions of the game. You simply perform every possible action in a given room before moving on to the next. See a blank wall? Try the glasses. No result? Punch the wall. Still nothing? Try the hammer. Now do the exact same thing with every other wall in the game. Every. Other. Wall. Even when this repetitive and agonizingly slow process does actually result in finding a hidden passage or item, you don’t get the satisfaction of feeling clever or accomplished. What else were you going to do? Not hammer that wall?\n\nYou’ll occasionally meet with an NPC character in one of these rooms and they’re simultaneously one of the best and worst things about Goonies II. The best because they’re usually abject weirdos spouting hilarious badly-translated gibberish and the worst because they almost never do or say anything useful. There’s a surprising number of generic old people, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, an Eskimo named Eskimo, and a superhero called Konami Man (who later starred in Konami Wai Wai World on the Famicom), among others. At least Konami Man will heal you when you visit him, so he’s okay by me. The others will mostly do stuff like tell you the room you’re currently in that warps you to another part of the map is a warp zone (really!?) or declare “It’s fun to play The Goonies 2!” Brilliant.\n\nSo the first person segments are a wretched slog, but even the platforming segments have issues which become apparent as you play on. For starters, there’s absolutely no challenge to be found. Oh, there are plenty of ways to die. Enemies, bottomless pits, lava, all that stuff. There’s simply no incentive not to bite the dust constantly, since you can instantly continue from the same screen you lost your last life on as many times as you want. You lose any expendable items like keys and bombs you may be carrying, but these drop all the time from random enemies, so you’re constantly picking up more. Combine this with the fact that some of the late game foes can take a dozen or more yo-yo hits before they finally go down and you have a game where you’ll be sorely tempted to just plow right through enemies heedless of the damage sustained just to save time getting from point A to point B. Not exactly riveting stuff.\n\nHow about the bizarre map system? There’s actually two maps of the hideout, labeled as “front” and “back.” You transition between the two sides by passing through certain doors and reaching a given destination usually requires taking a specific series of doors, going back and forth between the two sides multiple times in the process. If all this sounds stupidly baffling and unintuitive in the abstract, I can assure you it’s just as bad in practice. I played Goonies II so much as a kid that I can still complete it without a map or a walkthrough by my side to this day, but unless you did the same, count on getting very lost very fast.\n\nDid I mention there are no bosses? Because there aren’t. Not one. And the last straw? The very worst thing of all? No Sloth.\n\nDespite it all, I still can’t make myself hate The Goonies II. It filled a void at a time when complex adventure style games were still few and far between on the NES. It’s got some great music and it’s very, very strange. It may even qualify as an influential title. I’ve always suspected Mike Jones, the hero of Nintendo’s later StarTropics games, was inspired by Konami’s take on Mikey Walsh. The names, the red hair/blue shirt combo, the yo-yos. Both of them even hail from right here in the great Pacific Northwest. If it’s some of kind of coincidence, it’s a wild one.\n\nKonami was doing a lot of experimenting with integrating RPG and adventure game elements into its platformers around this time. If you’re interested in what happened when they (mostly) succeeded at it, I’d say to check out Getsu Fūma Den. If you want a good Goonies game specifically, try the original for the Famicom. It has all the strengths of Goonies II’s action bits while also being much more accessible and challenging.\n\nBut The Goonies II? I feel like I’m babysitting, except I’m not getting paid."
