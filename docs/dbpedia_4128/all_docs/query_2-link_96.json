Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page.\n\nThese 38 Useful Things Will Be A Huge Help In Managing Your Daily Chaos\n\nNo matter how minor the inconvenience, you're on the brink of solving it.\n\n1. DEET-free mosquito-repelling bracelets so you're armed and ready to defeat the bloodsuckers that come for you on a daily (if not hourly) basis. These essential oil-infused bracelets come individually wrapped for each use.\n\nAmazon\n\nPromising review: \"I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and untouched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hypersensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive.\" —Tracey Agopian\n\nGet a 10-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in packs in 25 or 50).\n\n2. A hands-free portable phone charger that'll save you from a dreaded dead battery time and time again. Stick it right into your phone rather than carrying around a heavy brick-like device that weighs you down. It gives you one full iPhone battery per charge, so you'll never wanna leave home without it.\n\nPromising review: \"I used these several times for the past year, traveling for business and leisure. It is always a challenge to find an outlet at the airport since some airports do not offer a charging station. Using those types can also be a security risk. That's why I love using these portable chargers. They are lightweight and fit in my travel handbag/or small backpack pocket. The portable chargers take about 30–35 minutes to fully charge if dead. Once charged, they charge fast and hold a charge for many hours.\" —J\n\nGet it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in five colors).\n\n3. Washable sockless shoe liners because life is stressful enough without subjecting your feet to a sweaty pair of socks. If you're not a fan of stinky feet *or* slippery no-show socks, these are a great alternative to let your feet breathe!\n\nThe liners come with trimming guidelines so that you can cut the insert to your desired size.\n\nPromising review: \"I can't recommend these inserts enough! After a week of heavy use, they hardly smell. Pop them in the wash, and they are ready to go again! Super comfy and doesn't move around. So nice to have in shoes you don't feel like wearing socks with! Plus, so many fun patterns!\" —Vicky L. Parr\n\nGet it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in two sizes [fits women's sizes 6–13] and four styles).\n\n4. Catrice \"Instant Awake\" Under Eye Brightener to help liven up your tired eyes after a string of *especially* chaotic days. This lightweight formula delivers excellent coverage in just a few swipes! If you want dark circles and puffiness to go *POOF*, look no further!\n\nPromising review: \"I often fall for those cheap beauty recommendations, but they are often huge fails. Not this! I love this stuff. I don’t know how it works, but it’s amazing. I swipe an eye stick on, dab this stuff on, and I don’t look like I had five hours of sleep. Even on 'no makeup' days, I find myself still applying this. Love it!!\" —Jill Fulton\n\nGet it from Amazon for $6 (available in two shades).\n\n5. A versatile veggie chopper, aka your new trusty kitchen sidekick thanks to its endless usefulness. Chop onions *without* a face full of tears? I'm sold.\n\nPromising review: \"Makes life so much easier. I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more. This requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container.\" —Amazon Customer\n\nGet it from Amazon for$24.97+ (be sure to clip the $5 off coupon on the product page for this price; available in four sizes and three colors).\n\n6. And this time-saving fruit and veggie divider perfect for managing the tedious task of splitting snacks into bite-size goodies! Doing it by hand is only adding to your daily chaos, don't ya think? Plus, parents love it for prepping kids' snacks, especially because it's safe enough for them to use too!\n\nCheck out a TikTok of the fruit and veggie divider in action.\n\nPromising review: \"If you have toddlers, get it — especially if you're on the fence. I needed something for grapes, blueberries, blackberries, and other small fruits and veggies we go through so much. My breakfast was getting cold long before I was done cutting fruit for two toddlers. Most cutters only do one grape or berry, but this one can do several grapes and a small handful of blueberries. We will definitely be getting a lot of use out of it in this house.\" —Kindle Customer\n\nGet it from Amazon for $11.41.\n\n7. A waterproof car trash can when you wanna be proactive and get ahead of the stuff that stresses you out, like a filthy car covered in heaps of trash, for example.\n\nAmazon\n\nIt comes with 10 trash bags.\n\nPromising review: \"This thing is amazinnggg! If you are (by nature) kind of a mess and unorganized, this will help with that, even if just a little. I usually put all my small trash items in my side door 'pocket,' and it ends up spilling, and then my car becomes a huge trash can time and time again. This car trash can is so easy to install and use. Anytime I’m opening a pack of smokes or gum or unwrapping a straw, I just pop the wrapper or whatever it is right in the trash can, and it’s never to be seen again! It’s helped keep my car clean and free of trash, and if I could give it 10 stars, I would!!\" —Cody\n\nGet it from Amazon for $9.97+ (available in eight colors).\n\n8. And for outdoor trash, a garbage guard so you aren't greeted by an uninvited family of flies whenever you take out a trash bag. Stick it to the inside of your garbage can and it'll release an odorless vapor to prevent pests for up to a whopping four months!\n\nPromising review: \"Got an outdoor can, the kind the mechanical arm on the garbage truck picks up and tips over, with the lid opening by gravity. I placed this on the inside of the lid, near the hinge, to lessen the chances of it being scraped off during emptying and no flies/maggots! No apparent odor. It just seems to put a big hurt on the fly party that used to be my trash can (litter box contents, remnants of meat, etc.) \" —Michael E. Bradley\n\nGet it from Amazon for $9.84 (also available as a two-pack).\n\n9. A WD-40 pen that'll make you believe in miracles, especially if you've had the pleasure of using the leaky can version in your lifetime — the worst. Now you can easily fix annoying squeaky hinges *without* the mess.\n\nPromising review: \"I love WD-40 products and use them for everything. I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors. These small direct-point application pens are great. Keep one in the glove box, my kitchen 'junk' drawer, and the house toolbox.\" —BBP623\n\nGet a three-pack from Amazon for $18.78.\n\n10. Plus, a touch-up paint pen to help address those ugly scuff marks or scratches on the wall that seem to appear every other day. Fill it with your paint color and whip it out whenever you need to make a quick touchup.\n\nSlobproof is a woman-owned small business.\n\nPromising reviews: \"Works great, no mess! This was easy to use to touch up our son's bedroom corner walls.\" —Elizabeth\n\n\"Love this — absolutely perfect for touchin' up little spots that need touchin' up. I have several sets filled with different paints, and so far, they've stayed usable without the paint drying out. I rinse the brush really well after each use (latex paints) and recap it. It would be nice if the manufacturer put an area on the pen where you could easily label the paint info, but I use a permanent marker, and it works okay.\" —Hooked on AMZN!\n\nGet a two-pack from Amazon for $16.99.

I had hard, scaly water deposits on the glass surrounding our powder room faucet (one of those fancy, highfalutin modern-looking things). I've tried everything for 4 years to get this stuff off. One day, I thought, maybe I'll try my sponges. Took it all off super easily!!!! The faucet looks like new. My only rec is to spot-test your item first before using it because it will scratch certain surfaces if you scrub too aggressively (for example, it gets the burned-on, weird stuff off of the bottom of my fave Our Place pan, but I rubbed too hard in one spot and it took the color right off lol).\" —Hoarder\n\nGet an eight-pack from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in two sponge thicknesses).\n\n17.

He was practically giddy after we installed several of these on various kitchen appliances. It’s not just storage — but moving the appliance around from its storage location to the countertop is a nicer experience. He was seriously swinging around a food processor with one hand saying 'this is so much neater!' To each their own I suppose. For us normies, it does exactly what it’s supposed to. Easy to stick on, I like that it holds the plug neatly as well. I would love if it came in white, but the gray is a nice neutral.\" —Elizabeth L.\n\nGet a two-pack from Amazon for $10.95 (also available as a four-pack).\n\n28.

You slide them on and after a few minutes feel a tingling, mildly burning (in a good way) sensation. It doesn't quite numb your feet, but it relaxes them. I kept them on for 30 minutes and then toweled my feet off, and the tingling sensation slowly faded over the next 30 minutes.

Honestly, I was a little skeptical of the promise of these pads, but I bought them just to try them out. THEY WORKED AMAZINGLY WELL! Seriously. I have some stains that are 1.5–2 years old. I've tried everything to get them out. I put these pads on the stains (two to cover the spot), let them sit for about an hour, pulled them up, and the stain was gone. I truly couldn't believe it. The pad was yellow. Somehow, the old urine was soaked up into the pad. My carpet looks like new. I couldn't recommend these any higher for what I wanted and what I got.
