Uninvited is a haunted house "point-and-click" adventure game developed originally for the Macintosh by ICOM Simulations released in 1986 by Mindscape.

The game uses the MacVenture engine that was introduced in ICOM's prior game, Deja Vu: a Nightmare Comes True. It is the only MacVenture that takes place in the present day.
