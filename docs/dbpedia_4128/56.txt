Uninvited is a point and click adventure game where a driver sees a mysterious figure and swerves to avoid it, crashing the car and being knocked unconscious. The driver discovers that their sibling is missing. With a creepy old mansion being the only place that the sibling could be, the driver heads into it, and soon discovers that it was once owned by a wizard and has become infested with the undead.

It was originally created with the MacVenture engine. An unofficial text adventure version was created by Dave Griffith in Inform in 2019.
