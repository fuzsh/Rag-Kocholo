The automatic music box has a long and storied history. Music boxes gained popularity starting in the 1800’s. Automated machines became more and more popular as technology developed. Music boxes were known as status symbols of their day, because only the most affluent could afford to purchase one. They delighted royalty and wealthy families throughout Europe and the United States.

The cylinder music box was most popular from the 1840’s to the 1890’s. Handmade predominantly by the Swiss, these music boxes could play multiple songs on one cylinder. Some cylinder music boxes had interchangeable cylinders with different songs. Makers like Nicole Freres and Heller became famous for their unique music boxes.

By 1900, disc music boxes had effectively replaced cylinder music boxes in popularity. By this time, these mechanical wonders had evolved into works of art. Music boxes were made with ornate inlay, intricate designs, and even stained glass. The music box below is a beautiful example of a top quality coin-operated disc changer music box by Regina, dating from 1900.

The music box’s heyday ended with the rise of the phonograph, a revolutionary way to play recorded sound. As the cylinder and disc phonograph found intense popularity, music boxes became less and less popular. Some music box manufacturers merged with larger companies, while most went out of business. Other companies like Regina attempted to break into the phonograph industry but proved to be unsuccessful due to larger companies like Edison and Victor.

Today, antique music boxes are collected by enthusiasts around the globe. They are viewed as beautiful and stunning works of art. Most antique music boxes were built to last, and this is why they are so widely coveted by antique admirers today.
